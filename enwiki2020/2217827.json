    "text": "The North Luzon Expressway (NLE or NLEx), formerly known as the North Diversion Road and Manila North Expressway (MNEX), is a 4 to 8-lane limited- access toll expressway that connects Metro Manila to the provinces of the Central Luzon region in the Philippines. It is a component of Expressway 1 (E1) and Expressway 5 (E5) of the Philippine expressway network and Circumferential Road 5 (C-5) and Radial Road 8 (R-8) of Manila's arterial road network. It was built in the 1960s. The expressway begins in Quezon City at the Balintawak Interchange with EDSA as a continuation of A. Bonifacio Avenue. It then passes through Caloocan and Valenzuela in Metro Manila and the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga in Central Luzon. It currently ends in Mabalacat. The segment between Santa Rita Exit in Guiguinto and the Balintawak Interchange in Quezon City is a part of the new alignment of AH26. It also has an extension in the NLEX Harbor Link project between Navotas and Valenzuela (to extend up to Quezon City when fully completed) in Metro Manila, which connects the expressway to Port of Manila. The expressway's main segment from Quezon City to Mabalacat has a length of , while the NLEX Harbor Link project has a combined length of including Segment 8.2 (NLEX C5 Link), which is yet to be constructed. Originally controlled by the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC), operation and maintenance of the NLEx was transferred in 2005 to NLEX Corporation, a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (a former subsidiary of the Lopez Group of Companies until 2008). A major upgrade and rehabilitation was completed in February 2005 with road now having similar qualities to a modern French tollway and other entities. ==Route description== ===North Luzon Tollway/NLEX Main=== NLEX northbound, just north of Paso de Blas, Valenzuela The North Luzon Tollway (NLT) or NLEX Main cuts northwards from Manila to the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga. The expressway parallels MacArthur Highway from Quezon City to Mabalacat in Pampanga. It has 8 lanes from Balintawak Interchange to Balagtas Interchange, 6 lanes from Balagtas Interchange to San Fernando Exit, and 4 lanes from San Fernando to Santa Ines Exit. The expressways has bridges that cross seven rivers. Some portions of the expressway are lined with billboards, including its viaduct portion. Various high voltage overhead power lines, most notably the Hermosa\u2013Duhat\u2013Balintawak transmission line of National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) from Smart Connect Interchange to San Fernando Exit, utilize the significant portion of the expressway route as the densely populated areas hinder acquisition of dedicated right of way. ====Balintawak- Balagtas==== Southbound lane of NLEx through Barangays Lawang Bato and Lingunan in Valenzuela. Bocaue The expressway starts at Balintawak Interchange as a physical continuation of A. Bonifacio Avenue. A few meters after the cloverleaf is Quirino Highway, with a northbound left exit ascending into a flyover to the northeast. Past this exit, Reparo Road parallels the expressway from Quirino Highway to Eternal Gardens Memorial Park. The road approaches the Balintawak toll plaza, widening to 17 lanes only serving northbound traffic. The offices of NLEX Corporation is located near the toll plaza. A new toll plaza, opened in 2017, is built between the northbound and southbound lanes, servicing Class 1 vehicles (cars, jeepneys, and other light vehicles). The expressway reverts to four lanes, continues northward, crossing over Tullahan River through the Tullahan Bridge and below Gen. T. de Leon Street and passes the Smart Connect Interchange. It then passes through industrial areas and businesses within Valenzuela. The expressway's East Service Road starts paralleling the expressway before Paso de Blas Exit. The road continues on a straight route, with a Caltex service area located near the Lingunan overpass, until it enters Bulacan. It crosses Meycauayan River and after a few meters is the Meycauayan Exit to serve its town proper. Another service road named St. Francis Service Road runs beside the expressway's southbound lanes. It passes through residential areas and institutions within the municipality, intersects with Lias Road, and continues on a straight alignment. On Marilao, there is a Petron service area and after it are the Marilao River crossing and Marilao Exit. It enters Bocaue after Marilao Exit, where Ciudad de Victoria and the Philippine Arena lies to the east. The road turns eastward to serve Bocaue toll plaza, where the southbound lanes widens to 22 lanes with 4 from a parallel road making a grand total of 26 lanes, and on the middle of it is a newly built toll plaza and road. It turns westward, passes through Bocaue Exit, Santa Maria River, and Taal Bridge, and continues on a straight alignment until Balagtas Interchange. Before it are the Petron for southbound traffic and Shell for northbound traffic. Past the Shell service area are the Tabang Spur Road and Balagtas Interchange, which was opened on March 20, 2012. The former is the former terminus of the original segment of the expressway from 1967 to 1976 before it is extended north to Dau. ====Balagtas-San Fernando==== Candaba Viaduct The expressway narrows to three lanes per direction past Tabang Spur Road. It continues on a straight route, traversing paddy fields on the outskirts of Guiguinto, Malolos, and Pulilan. AH26 leaves NLEX at Santa Rita Exit, where it follows Maharlika Highway, also known as Cagayan Valley Road, to Baliuag and Cabanatuan. A few meters after Pulilan Exit is the Candaba Viaduct (officially known as Pulilan-Apalit Bridge). The bridge traverses rice paddies and swampland in the municipalities of Pulilan, Calumpit, Bulacan and Apalit, Pampanga, and crosses Pampanga River before the viaduct ends. The expressway continues again on a straight alignment, passing through Apalit, San Simon, Santo Tomas, and San Fernando, and crosses Abacan and San Fernando rivers. At the vicinity of San Fernando Exit are two major malls, SM City Pampanga and Robinsons Starmills Pampanga. ====San Fernando-Sta.Ines==== The 4-lane segment of NLEX in Pampanga An overpass at the SCTEX Exit, before the 2016 expansion After San Fernando Exit, the expressway narrows into two lanes, both northbound and southbound. It continues as a straight roadway, passing through the rural areas of Mexico, crossing Abacan and Quitangil rivers, and traversing the eastern parts of Angeles and Mabalacat. NLEX connects with Subic\u2013Clark\u2013Tarlac Expressway via Clark Spur Road before the main line terminates at Sta. Ines Interchange, with a toll plaza serving the exit. The segment between SCTEX and Sta. Ines Exit used to be a two-lane road but has since widened into four lanes with a grass median. ===Tabang Spur Road=== Tabang Spur Road Tabang Spur Road is a four-lane, spur road in Bulacan that branches off NLEX Main at Tabang Exit in Balagtas and terminates at a partial cloverleaf interchange with MacArthur Highway and Cagayan Valley Road at Guiguinto Exit in Guiguinto. It carried the final leg of NLEX (then the North Diversion Road) until the present route was extended to Pampanga. The road spurs off the main line at Tabang Exit in Balagtas. It then crosses the abandoned Philippine National Railways line to Cabanatuan, traverses Barangays Tuktukan, Tabe, and Malis in Guiguinto, and crosses the Guiguinto River. It then approaches the Tabang Toll Plaza, where the road expands to 12 lanes for both westbound and eastbound motorists. The operations and management offices of Tollways Management Corporation is located near the toll plaza. A Shell station is also found next to the offices, serving eastbound motorists. At the nearby unsignalized intersection past the toll plaza, it meets St. Francis Street, which serves as an alternate route to MacArthur Highway. It ends at the partial cloverleaf interchange with MacArthur Highway and Maharlika Highway and continues to the west towards Malolos as the former. Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link) of the NLEx looking west towards Smart Connect Interchange. ===NLEX Harbor Link=== The NLEX Harbor Link Project is the extension of North Luzon Expressway that runs currently from Mindanao Avenue in Valenzuela at the east to Radial Road 10 in Navotas at the west, where an access to the Port of Manila is found. It aims to connect with Port of Manila, while improving cargo movement between NLEX and Radial Road 10. It is divided into four segments, namely: Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link), 8.2 (C5 Link), 9 (Karuhatan Link), and 10 (Harbor Link). The entire project forms Expressway 5 (E5) of the Philippine expressway system. ====Segments 8.1 and 9==== Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link) is a four-lane, spur road that runs from the Smart Connect Interchange to Mindanao Avenue in Valenzuela. Lying on the ground level east of the interchange, it begins at the intersection with Mindanao Avenue in Barangay Ugong and then approaches the Mindanao toll plaza, widening to 6 lanes serving only westbound traffics. It terminates at the Smart Connect Interchange with NLEX Main and continues to the west as Segment 9 (Karuhatan Link). On the other hand, Segment 9 (Karuhatan Link) is a four-lane, spur road that runs from Smart Connect Interchange to MacArthur Highway in Barangay Karuhatan, Valenzuela City. It is the first segment of the NLEX Harbor Link project. It begins at the Smart Connect Interchange with NLEX Main, picking-up from where Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link) left off. Lying on the ground level west of the interchange, it then traverses Barangays Gen. T. De Leon, Parada, and Maysan, where two exits towards the last two barangays, respectively, are found. It then enters Barangay Karuhatan, where it approaches the Karuhatan Toll Plaza, widening to 6 lanes serving only eastbound vehicles, and Segment 10 (Harbor Link) and finally terminates at MacArthur Highway. Both Segments 8.1 and 9 are components of Circumferential Road 5 (C-5) of Manila's arterial road network. ====Segment 10==== Under- construction NLEX Segment 10 in Sangandaan, Caloocan NLEX Segment 10, the second phase of the NLEX Harbor Link project, is a four-lane, fully elevated expressway which connects with the Karuhatan Link (Segment 9) in Valenzuela to C-3 Road in Caloocan, where two ramps carry it to the west for another up to Radial Road 10 (R-10) in Navotas. It is designated to provide access between Port of Manila and northern Luzon. Most of the road utilizes the existing railway right of way through Caloocan, Malabon, and Valenzuela, with the road rising as high as to provide necessary clearance for the elevated Manila\u2013Clark Railway of the Philippine National Railways (PNR). NLEX Harbor Link begins at Karuhatan Exit with Segment 9 (Karuhatan Link) and MacArthur Highway. The section near the northern terminus traverses an industrial and residential area, which necessitated the demolition of numerous houses, buildings, and warehouses. It soon follows the railway right-of-way where it rises up to provide necessary ground clearance for the viaduct carrying the future Manila\u2013Clark Railway. It then crosses Tullahan River, where it enters Malabon. It then enters Caloocan, where past Samson Road and the PNR rolling stock shops in Caloocan, it shifts to the right of the railway right of way, which also required demolition of numerous houses and buildings, including a local wet market. An exit to C-3 Road could then be found before meeting the Caloocan Interchange, where the expressway veers west as the C3\u2013R10 spur alignment with connection to the future NLEX Connector (NLEX-SLEX Connector Road) that would run south towards Manila. The C3\u2013R10 spur alignment runs above C-3 Road, where a westbound exit ramp towards Dagat-Dagatan Avenue could be found. It then crosses the Navotas River and enters Navotas, where it veers southeast towards Radial Road 10 and ends at the Navotas Interchange, which provides access to the Port of Manila via Mel Lopez Boulevard. At the Navotas Interchange, the expressway has a possible future connection to the proposed NLEX\u2013CAVITEX Port Expressway Link or Harbor Link Port Access Mobility Facility towards Manila\u2013Cavite Expressway or Anda Circle, respectively. ==History== Balintawak Interchange in 1968 The original stretch of the expressway, from Balintawak Interchange up to Guiguinto Exit in Bulacan, was completed on August 4, 1968. It is a fully fenced limited-access highway that consisted of a four-lane rural divided roadway, nine twin bridges, one railroad overpass, seven underpasses, and three interchanges. Originally a project of the Department of Public Works and Highways, the completion of the major portion of the job fell on the Construction Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP, the precursor to PNCC) to pioneer the toll concept of funding infrastructure. It was carried out under the private financing scheme provided by Republic Act 3741. Additional work required by the government included the construction of the Balintawak \u2013 Novaliches Interchange Complex, the Tabang Interchange, and the approach road of the underpasses. In 1976, the NLT extension, consisting of of concrete road, was built as part of a highways program of the International Bank for Reconstruction Development (World Bank) linking major urban centers to the production centers in the north. The project features a 4-lane limited-access highway with a five-kilometer Candaba Viaduct, a construction innovation utilizing precast beam system, 6 interchanges, 12 bridges, and overpass/underpass structures.https://pncc.ph/projects_slex.htm In 1989, under the Corazon Aquino administration, the expressway was extended by another from its terminus at Dau Exit to Sta. Ines Exit in Mabalacat, Pampanga. A segment of NLEX in 1999, with a passing Partas bus From 2003 to February 2005, the expressway underwent a major rehabilitation. Works included the widening of the Balintawak\u2013Tabang segment from 6 to 8 lanes and the Tabang\u2013Sta. Rita segment from 4 to 6 lanes, asphalt overlay, and the demolition of old tollbooths. The main contractor of the rehabilitation work was Leighton Contractors (Australia) with Egis Projects, a company belonging to the French Groupe Egis as the main subcontractor for the toll, telecommunication and traffic management systems. To help maintain the safety and quality of the expressway, various rules are in effect, such as restricting the left lane to passing vehicles only and banning overloaded trucks. After the rehabilitation, the operation and maintenance of the expressway was transferred from the state-owned Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) to the Manila North Tollways Corporation (now NLEX Corporation). On June 5, 2010, the NLEx Segment 8.1 or the NLEX Mindanao Avenue Link was opened. The spur road is a part of the C-5 Road North Extension and is built to provide another entry point to the expressway from Metro Manila and decongest Balintawak Interchange. On March 18, 2015, NLEX Segment 9 or the NLEX Karuhatan Link was opened, providing continuation to Segment 8.1 that runs from the other side of the Smart Connect Interchange to MacArthur Highway. On February 28, 2019, the main stretch of NLEX Segment 10 or the NLEX Harbor Link, from Karuhatan to C-3 Road, was opened to traffic.On February 21, 2020, its C3\u2013R10 Section was partially opened up to its Malabon exit ramp; the remaining section to Radial Road 10 was opened on June 15, 2020. ==Future== ===Segment 8.2 (NLEX C5 Link)=== The NLEx Segment 8.2, also named NLEX C5 Link, will be a segment part of the NLEX Harbor Link Project that will connect the existing NLEx Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link) to Congressional Avenue, both present components of C-5, in Quezon City. The planned segment will at first run parallel to Republic Avenue before making a southward turn to Luzon Avenue after which it will then connect to Commonwealth Avenue Extension. The segment will include two interchanges in Mindanao and Regalado Avenues, a roundabout connection at Congressional Avenue, and three local road crossings at Quirino Highway, Sauyo Road, and Chestnut Avenue. ===NLEX Connector=== Plans for a construction of an elevated road to connect North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) has been bared long before the construction of NLEX Connector. The government reportedly accepted the unsolicited proposal from Metro Pacific Tollways Development Corporation (MPTDC) to build the road. MPTDC is a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation (MPTC), which runs NLEX. This would later be known as the NLEX Connector Road project, the elevated expressway which will have run over the Philippine National Railways tracks and terminating at the future interchange with Skyway Stage 3. It will be connected in the north to the existing Segment 10 (Harbor Link) in Caloocan. In the south, it will be linked to the Skyway Stage 3 near the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) campus in Santa Mesa, Manila. Once completed, the Connector Road will have four entry and exit points: C-3 Road in Caloocan, Espa\u00f1a in Sampaloc, Manila, and terminating through the Paco-Sta. Mesa Road in Santa Mesa, Manila. This project is targeted to be open to traffic by February 2022. Its construction will also take into consideration the upcoming parallel construction of the Main Line South of the Philippine National Railways as an elevated and electrified railway. Construction of the project is estimated to cost , but as an \"all-elevated\" or completely grade-separated structure, right-of-way acquisition shall be reduced to an estimated cost of only . It broke ground on February 28, at the same time NLEX Connector was inaugurated and opened to traffic, officially indicating that the NLEX Karuhatan Link and Segment 10 are mostly complete. ===NLEX Phase 3=== This will be a extension with three segments from NLEX Main, originally in San Simon, Pampanga, to Dinalupihan, Bataan, connecting to Subic\u2013Tipo Expressway (NLEx Segment 7). However, the plan did not push through. It would instead start somewhere between Apalit and San Fernando in Pampanga, then will cut across Guagua and end at Dinalupihan. Though the project will start tentatively from Apalit based on the concession, the new alignment has yet to be finalized. ==Technical specifications== *Name: North Luzon Expressway *Concession holder: NLEX Corporation *Operator: Tollways Management Corporation *Length: *Concession starting date: February 10, 2005 *Concession ending date: December 31, 2037 *Highway exits: 15 *Lanes: 8 lanes (4 lanes), 6 lanes (3 lanes), and 4 lanes (2 lanes) *Toll plazas: 6 *Rest and Service Areas: 10 *Minimum Height Clearance on Underpasses: ==Tolls== Bocaue Toll Plaza in Bulacan The tollway has two sections: an open section and a closed section. The open section charges a flat toll based on vehicle class and is employed to reduce the number of toll barriers (and associated bottlenecks) within Metro Manila. The closed section is distance-based, charging based on the class of vehicle and distance traveled. When the expressway was modernized, an electronic toll collection system was set up for Class 1 vehicles while prepaid magnetic cards were assigned to Class 2 and 3 vehicles to speed up transactions at toll booths. These have since been replaced by a unified ETC system operated by Easytrip. Also, with the government's thrust towards toll road interoperability, Autosweep of the San Miguel Corporation which operates SLEX, Skyway, STAR, NAIAX, and TPLEX has been accepted as a mode of payment in NLEX since March 2018. As of October 1, 2011, all tolls (as shown below) include the 12% Value-Added Tax (VAT). With the movement of the northernmost toll gate to Sta. Ines, the NLEX and SCTEX toll systems have been merged into one combined system, with tolls for all enclosed destinations listed. {| class=wikitable |- !Class !Open system (Balintawak\u2013Marilao) !Closed system (Bocaue\u2013Sta. Ines/SCTEX) |- |Class 1 (cars, motorcycles, SUVs, jeepneys) | |/km |- |Class 2 (buses, light trucks) | |/km |- |Class 3 (heavy trucks) | |/km |- |} ==Features== NLEX rumble strips approaching Balintawak Toll Barrier Steet lights at the middle of NLEX near the Santa Rita interchange in Guiguinto. *Street lights (Balintawak-San Fernando) *Variable message signs *Rumble strips *Emergency telephones (every 2 km in the Balintawak-Burol segment, every in the Burol-Sta. Ines segment) *Runaway truck ramp *Rest and service areas (privately owned and operated) *Closed-circuit television *Guard rails *Impact attenuators *Solid wall fence *Lighting arrestors *Car density sensors underneath road surface *Hidden speed guns *Electronic toll payment (class 1), prepaid account cards (class 2/3) *Much of the expressway has been built to U.S. Interstate highway standards, featuring eight lanes through Metro Manila. As it enters the more rural area north of Manila, the expressway narrows to 6 and then 4 lanes with a grass median to separate the two carriageways. **All signage is in English, and are nearly identical to the \"big green signs\" (BGS) on American expressway, including white lettering on a green background, with the exit tab in the upper-right corner (distance signs even employ a font similar\u2014if not identical\u2014to the Caltrans font; all other signs employ a different font). **Like expressways in most American states, the NLEx uses a distance-based sequencing for numbering interchanges. Being a metric country, though, the system is kilometer-log rather than mile-log\u2014exits numbered according to the distance (in kilometers) from Rizal Park in Manila, which is designated as \"Kilometer Zero\" in Luzon. ==Technical information== ===Lanes=== NLEX in San Simon, after the 2016 expansion project The NLEX has 8 lanes, 4 lanes in both directions from the Balintawak to Burol segment, 6 lanes with 3 lanes for both directions on the Burol to San Fernando segment and 4 lanes with 2 lanes for both directions on the Tabang Spur and San Fernando to Sta. Ines segment. Before the lane expansion project of 2016, there was even a part of the NLEX which consists of only 2 lanes, one for each direction. This segment is located after passing through the SCTEx Exit (Northbound) but has since been expanded into four lanes. ===Speed limit=== 100 km/h for cars and jeepneys, 80 km/h for trucks and buses, and 60 km/h is the minimum for all classes of vehicles. Speed limits are strictly enforced via CCTV cameras and speed guns, and speeders are usually identified as soon as they hit the tollbooth. ===Major upgrade=== San Fernando Toll Plaza in Pampanga, before the 2005 rehabilitation The upgrade consisted of rebuilding of roads and building new toll plazas. Launched in the beginning of 2003 and completed in February 2005, the roadway now has modern features explained above. ===Drainage enhancement program=== The entire stretch of the expressway underwent another rehabilitation regarding its drainage systems. The expressway is known to be flooded during the rainy season and the goal of the project is to fix the drainage systems within the road to prevent flooding. Within this period, certain lanes of the road were closed to the traffic. This in turn caused massive traffic jams along the road and the speed limit on the construction sites were reduced from 80/100 km/h to 60 km/h. The program started on February 12, 2007 and finished on October 7, 2007. ===Shareholder companies=== *Philippine National Construction Corporation *Metro Pacific Investments Corporation *Leighton Asia Limited *Egis Projects S.A of France ==Services== ===Emergency phones and parking bays=== Emergency telephone boxes are located throughout the whole length of the expressway. Parking bays (lay-bys) are also placed on regular intervals on the expressway, for use in emergency situations. ===Service areas=== North Luzon Expressway has seven service areas, mostly located on the closed toll section north of Bocaue. Each service station hosts a gas station, restaurants, and a convenience store, as well as ATMs and restrooms, car repair, and lubrication services. ==Exits== A toll barrier of the Santa Rita Exit Exit numbers are based on kilometer post. Exits begin at 10 because the NLEx is a logical continuation of A. Bonifacio Avenue. Rizal Park in Manila is designated as Kilometer Zero. ===North Luzon Tollway/NLEX Main=== ===Tabang Spur Road=== The west end of Tabang Spur Road at Guiguinto Exit ===NLEX Harbor Link=== C-3 Road Exit of NLEX Harbor Link beneath the under-construction Caloocan Interchange (2019) ===NLEX Connector=== ==In popular culture== *The expressway was featured in the music video to the song \"Toll Gate\" by the band Hale. *It was also featured in the movie Sa North Diversion Road in 2005, based on Tony Perez's stage play of the same name. It was created by Dennis Marasigan. *From June 6\u201317, 2007, On North Diversion Road, the play written by Tony Perez, was performed at The Arts House, Singapore, by young & W!LD, an actor training division of Singapore's W!LD RICE Theatre. ==See also== *North Luzon East Expressway *Central Luzon Link Expressway *Subic\u2013Clark\u2013Tarlac Expressway *Tarlac\u2013Pangasinan\u2013La Union Expressway *South Luzon Expressway *Skyway (Metro Manila) ==References== ==External links== *Manila North Tollways Corporation *NLEx-SCTEx Toll Table Rates Category:Toll roads in the Philippines Category:Roads in Metro Manila Category:Roads in Bulacan Category:Roads in Pampanga ",
