In 1950 two villages, T\u00e1pi\u00f3s\u00e1p and T\u00e1pi\u00f3s\u00fcly, amalgamated, but they separated in 1954. In 1970 they combined again to form S\u00fclys\u00e1p. ==Geography== S\u00fclys\u00e1p is in the Lower T\u00e1pi\u00f3 Valley of the G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 hills. In this picturesque location, surrounded by beautiful low hills and good terrain, the Lower T\u00e1pi\u00f3 and S\u00e1pi streams add to making the town a beauty spot. ==Communications== Primary route 31 serves the town by road. Express and stopping trains of the Hungarian State Railways serve the town on suburban line 120a (Budapest-\u00dajsz\u00e1sz-Szolnok) at the main station (S\u00fclys\u00e1p) and a smaller station halt (Sz\u0151l\u0151snyaral\u00f6). \"Sz\u0151l\u0151snyaral\u00f6\" is best translated as \"Vineyard retreat\"; the village was built as holiday homes for workers from Budapest. Over the years these holiday homes have been converted and extended and are used as main homes. The nearest airport is the main international airport for the capital, Budapest-Ferihegy. ==Economy== There are around 360 small and medium enterprises in the town, providing the livelihood of a large segment of the population. After the collapse of the collective farming system, the lands around S\u00fclys\u00e1p were privatized, and farmers became self-employed. The Agricultural Service Co-op was founded not long after, and currently leases almost half of the land from the owners, with a large number of members. Other companies employing significant numbers of people include Ebm. Hungary Ltd., J\u00e1sz-Plasztik Ltd., Dar\u00e1zs Ltd., and (Budapest Gas Works Co) Public Company. Local government services also employ many people. ==Landmarks== *The Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady, built in 1489 in Gothic style. *The S\u0151t\u00e9r Castle, built by the S\u0151t\u00e9r family of landed gentry in 1725. *The Grassalkovich shooting lodge, visited by S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. *The life-size statue of Saint Stephen on Saint Stephen Square. *The statue of the Holy Trinity. *The statue of Saint John of Nepomuk. *The House of Prayer of the Pentecostal Church. *The Italian memorial by the Fiume Studies Society, in remembrance of the 129 Italian citizens who died at T\u00e1pi\u00f3s\u00fcly (now part of S\u00fclysap) in the internment camp. *The statue of a girl holding a peacock. ==Gallery== File:M\u00f3ra Ferenc \u00c1ltal\u00e1nos Iskola S\u00fclys\u00e1p.jpg|alt=Photograph of Ferenc M\u00f3ra Primary School|Ferenc M\u00f3ra Primary School File:Sulysap all.jpg|alt=Photograph of S\u00fclys\u00e1p railway station|S\u00fclys\u00e1p railway station in May 2007 File:S\u00fclys\u00e1p station (\"allomas\") from the same angle as the existing image on WikiMedia Commons.JPG|alt=From the same angle as the previous photograph, six years later.
