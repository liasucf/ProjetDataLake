Nicknamed \"Buddy\", at age eight he got his first guitar and soon began performing live with his father's band, The Fremont River Rangers. Three years later, he appeared with his father live on local television station KDYL in Salt Lake City. When the family moved to Los Angeles, California in the early 1950s, he continued to perfect his musical skills, playing both the acoustic guitar and the steel guitar. He also began to do home recordings of himself playing rhythm guitar to a song. == The Lawrence Welk Show == Buddy Merrill joined The Lawrence Welk Show in 1955, the same year it first went national on ABC. On the Welk Show, he performed his guitar version of \"Blue Suede Shoes,\" a popular hit by Elvis Presley in 1956. (Retrieved from \"The Lawrence Show.\" PBS TV.

On his return to the Music Makers he was joined in the band's rhythm section with fellow guitarist Neil Levang. For the next twelve years the two would perform together on television. Merrill used a Fender Stratocaster guitar for many of his TV appearances. ==Accomplishments after Welk== In 1974, Merrill left the Welk orchestra to devote more time to writing music and recording for Accent Records.Profile, AccentRecords.com; accessed December 4, 2014.
