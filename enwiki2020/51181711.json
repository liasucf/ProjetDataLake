With its magnificent portraits of nineteenth century personages, its dramatic accounts of the making of mighty music, its subtleties, its humour, and its tragedy, it carries the reader through some of the most stirring periods in the careers of its principals Miss Richardson has taken infinite pains to ensure the fidelity of her portraits\"\"Wagner and Cosima\" by K.A., The Argus, 18 March 1939, p18 In a short review in The Sydney Morning Herald the reviewer points to the craft behind the work: \"Gleaning facts from a number of sources, listed at the back of the book, Miss Richardson has built up a vivid and moving romantic novel. The period, circa 1850, so close to our own in time, is far enough removed in outlook and habit of thought to appear remote. This factor, though not stressed, is subtly used in order to present the characters as something more than life size. An unusual and often subtle interpretation of some of the facts lends freshness and emphasis to incidents and situations which have already become more or less historically stereotyped. The dialogue has, except in moments of passion and excitement, that slight stiffness appropriate to the nineteenth century.\"\"A Grand Passion\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 25 February 1939, p20 == See also == * 1939 in Australian literature ==References== Category:1939 Australian novels Category:Novels by Henry Handel Richardson ",
