She studied journalism and audiovisual production, and made some appearances on radio and television. Due to censorship after the Cuban Revolution, she emigrated to Costa Rica with her husband and eldest daughter in 1961. She initially worked for Radio Monumetal's news program, and later joined Las Estrellas se re\u00fanen. She became the host of Teleclub, an educational television program which debuted on 8 February 1963. It was aimed at stay-at-home parents, with segments on cooking, sewing, health, nutrition, and beauty, as well as news. According to S\u00e1nchez, Teleclub succeeded because it met the need for a family-oriented program which Costa Rican television had been lacking. It was first broadcast on Canal 4, then moved to Teletica Canal 7, followed by Repretel Canal 6, Canal 2, Canal 4 until 2002, and Canal 13 until 2015. It is currently broadcast by Televisora de Costa Rica on Teletica XPERTV Canal 33. On 21 January 2002, the program was interrupted when S\u00e1nchez suffered a life-threatening heart attack. She recovered and returned to hosting on 2 May. As of 2010, more than 13,000 hours of Teleclub had been broadcast. ==Awards and recognition== In August 2005, In\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez was presented with a recognition from the government of Japan for her dissemination of Japanese culture through Teleclub segments on ikebana, origami, and cuisine.
