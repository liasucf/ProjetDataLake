    "text": "Debelah Laksh Morgan (born September 29, 1973) is an American singer and songwriter. Morgan is best known for her hit single \"Dance with Me\" off of her third studio album, which reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Early life and education== The owner of a five-octave vocal range, R&B; singer Debelah Morgan wrote her first song at the age of eight, soon after forming her own girl's choir and serving as their arranger. At 15, she was teaching gospel choir at the University of Arizona, that same year winning Miss Teen Black Arizona honors. Morgan then relocated to Los Angeles, taking home a silver medal in the NAACP international music competition. ==Career== She signed with Atlantic Records in 1994, and released her debut album Debelah which featured the singles \"Take It Easy\" and \"Free\" which had moderate success on the R&B; charts. A couple years later, she moved to VAZ/Motown Records and released her single \"Yesterday\" which was a Top30 R&B; hit, and landed on the Pop charts. However, while her second album It's Not Over was released in Japan and a few other international territories, it was shelved in the United States in 1998. A second single \"I Love You\" became a big hit in Japan. Two years later, she resigned with Atlantic Records and released her biggest single to date, \"Dance With Me\" which hit #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in addition to becoming a Top5 dance hit. Her third studio album Dance With Me soon followed in 2001 and peaked at #35 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Two additional singles (\"I Remember\" and \"Close to You\") were released from the album. Additionally, she contributed the song \"Why Did You Have to Be\" to the Osmosis Jones soundtrack and a cover of \"Do You Remember?\" to the Phil Collins tribute album, Urban Renewal. In 2005, she signed with the independent label RansomWear and released her fourth album Light at the End of the Tunnel (a gospel release) which was preceded by the single \"Just As I Am\". The album remains out of print and is not available on any digital services. Apart from \"Just As I Am\", none of the tracks have been found or leaked. In 2010, she released the live album Let the Worship in Champions Live 2 with her Las Vegas church, of which she is their worship leader. The following year, she was slated to have shot a pilot for a reality series with R&B; singers Shanice and Karyn White. In 2012 and 2013, she performed with the legendary R&B; group Rose Royce as their lead vocalist for a couple of shows. In 2015, she collaborated with Shanice and All-4-One on the track \"Go to Bed\" off the latter's album Twenty. ==Discography== === Albums === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Album information |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |align=\"left\"|Debelah *Released: June 14, 1994 *Label: Atlantic |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |align=\"left\"|It's Not Over *Released: September 15, 1998 *Label: VAZ / Motown |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |align=\"left\"|Dance with Me *Released: August 15, 2000 *Label: The DAS Label / Atlantic |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |align=\"left\"|Light at the End of the Tunnel *Released: 2005 *Label: Ransomwear Music |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
