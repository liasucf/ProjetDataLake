    "text": "The early 1990s marked the advent of online diary planners. On the face of it, it seems that people who must attend countless meetings are the ones who need online diary planners the most. However, actual trends show that those who are in the habit of recording and chronicling their activities all the time are the real takers and users of online diary planners. Such people may be executives, event managers, doctors, students, and people from various walks of life. Terminally ill patients have often taken to writing online diaries. Through the medium of such online diaries, they have kept millions of others in the know of their personal plans, thoughts, their medical treatment procedures, etc. Since all sorts of people have been using online diary planners since their advent in the 1990s, the demand for perfect online organizers and personal information managers (PIMS) has been growing steadily with time. Initially, web-based Filofax came into being to satisfy the organizing need of users. But such applications had their disadvantages. This forced users to turn to solutions like ACT!, Time and Chaos. As these too did not prove to be adequate, those in need of online diary planners started looking towards Microsoft Outlook. ==Online calendars: Upgraded online diary planners== Online calendars, a newer and upgraded version of online diary planners, soon appeared to replace the older online diary planners. The main difference between the newer online calendars and the older handheld computers and PIMS was that while the older devices stored all the appointments and meeting schedules of a person on their computer or handheld device, the newer calendar devices stored all information on the Internet. Hence, online calendars were automatically more accessible and less cumbersome as they could be accessed anytime, anywhere if users were in front of a PC, laptop or other machine connected to the Internet. Users did not need to carry them around as they had to carry the older versions because the older versions were not available on the Internet. Hence, diarists turned to Outlook. Right through the first half of the first decade of the 21st century, Outlook was considered to be an excellent application that could be synchronized with Pocket PCs. Further, the older versions required users to make backups of their data regularly, so they had to do that extra work. If they did not make a backup and their Psion, Palm or Pocket PC or other device crashed, they would be unable to recover any data. And if they did recover some data from the backup, to where would they restore it? To another Psion palmtop? Psion soon stopped producing palmtops. ===First generation online calendars=== However, some of the very first online calendars that were developed did not perform too well as online diary planners. Though they were impressive enough initially with their multifaceted social networking abilities, they could not manage to impress their users over a long period of time. They helped users to add appointments straightaway. Users did not need to sort through dropdown menus to choose meeting dates and times. That way, the online calendars functioned like secretaries. Users just had to key their meeting schedules into the application and the online diary planner would flash the data and remind them in time. But users soon began to be put off with these first-generation online calendars. They complained that they could view only one-month's appointments on the calendar. Which means if they wanted to schedule a conference over one month away, they would be unable to do so because the application allowed viewing a calendar only 30 days at a time. Also, if users set a meeting date that was far in the future, months from the date on which the details were entered, the online calendar would not show the details until and unless that month arrived. This disadvantage of the initially launched online calendars became a bane for most users. Then, there was the privacy issue. Such open calendars that intended users to connect with as many people as they could meant that others would be able to view the users\u2019 calendars. Moreover, these online diary planners were unable to warn their users if more than one appointment was made within the same time slot. In other words, they could not prevent double bookings. Further, many people found the idea of an online calendar weird because they felt that it is impossible to access the Internet everywhere! Most first-generation online calendars could not carve out a decent market for themselves and thus had to give way to calendars created by giants of the information technology industry such as Microsoft and Yahoo!. To add insult to injury, users also disliked the appearance and the look and feel of first-generation online calendars. ===Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo! Calendar=== However these shortcomings of the first-generation online calendars prompted most users to go back to tried and tested ways. So people began to use Microsoft Outlook and synchronize the same with portable contrivances. However, this concept did not work with everybody. The Outlook applications on PCs, Palm handheld computers, Psion palm tops or diaries on cell phones that had been around for quite some time could not, however, meet the expectations of users. Despite helping users to automate the conference management process to some extent, these contrivances lacked the ability to guard against the common problem of double-booking appointments and meetings. So the Yahoo! Calendar was visited once again. Yahoo! was popular from the last decade of the 20th century. Yahoo! always came with downloadable and compatible software that helped to keep the office computer, the Yahoo! calendar and the handheld online diary working in tandem. Yahoo enables synchronization with Lotus Organizer, Outlook, ACT, Outlook Express and Palm. But there was one hitch. The Yahoo! software had to be downloaded to the office PC if a user wanted to use it from their office. But downloading software from the Internet is discouraged and proscribed by many companies. Which meant that users could not use the Yahoo! calendar in many offices, but could use it in some. This is why the calendar began to experience a drop in popularity. This, and the Yahoo! design being not particularly eye-catching and that it did not work easily with all browsers, are the chief reasons why the Yahoo! calendar could not hold onto its number one position as the best and most user-friendly online calendar and diary planner. ===Google Calendar=== Google Calendar launched with a mix of unique and existing features. Users can synchronize their calendar with Microsoft Outlook, making use of the conventional meeting request procedure found in other calendaring systems. When accepted, the proposed date will show on the recipient's Google Calendar. A reminder for the event can be sent to the involved parties' Gmail account before the event begins. Google Calendar sends meeting alerts as SMS to users' cell phones and smartphones via the official apps. Users are also able to download public holidays and important dates from the public calendar gallery. Google Calendar permits users to drag and drop events and happenings from one calendar, such as Microsoft Outlook, to another. However, Google Calendar has several flaws. Firstly, to use it, users must have an active Google account. Secondly, the calendar may, at times, double-book users. ==Other online diary planners and calendars== Currently, the Internet is flooded with electronic diaries and online diary planners of various types and with various abilities.
