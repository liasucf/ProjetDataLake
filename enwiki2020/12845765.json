From Chopin's letters it is known that he used the name \"fantasy\" to show some sort of freedom from rules and give a Romantic expression. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin continued the tradition of a self-contained movement in his Fantaisie. This Fantaisie is one of Chopin's longest pieces, and is considered one of his greatest works. == Form == This work belongs to the Fantasy form, a composition free in form and inspiration. It begins with a solemn marching theme that eventually plunges into a passionate and virtuosic section, the transition marked poco a poco \u2026 doppio movimento, still with elements of marching, but more triumphant and positive in mood. About halfway through the piece occurs a slow and sombre chorale-like section in B major, before the previous section is restated. After a short, quiet and sweet statement followed by a final flourish the work ends in a plagal cadence in A-flat major, the relative key. This piece is 11-14 minutes long. == References == ==External links== * * Performance of Fantaisie in F minor by Cecile Licad from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in MP3 format Category:Compositions by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin Category:Compositions for solo piano Category:1841 compositions Chopin Category:Compositions in F minor ",
