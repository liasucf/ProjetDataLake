    "text": "Irina L\u0103z\u0103reanu (; born 8 June 1982) is a Romanian-Canadian model and folk singer. She was helped in her modelling career by supermodel Kate Moss, who chose her as the cover model for an issue of Vogue: Paris and who also made her the face of her clothing line Topshop. As a musician, she is closely associated with Pete Doherty, to whom she was engaged twice, but never married. Her debut album Some Place Along the Way was produced by Sean Lennon. == Early life == L\u0103z\u0103reanu was born in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, and at age 5, immigrated to Canada, settling into the Montreal suburb of Saint-Hubert, Quebec with her parents. At the age of 13, she moved to London to study ballet until she was derailed by a broken knee. She met Pete Doherty at the age of 15 whom she later dated briefly and was engaged to in 2007. == Modeling career == At age 17 L\u0103z\u0103reanu attended an open call and signed with Giovanni modelling agency in Montreal with the hopes that it would help pay rent. From then on she did the usual rounds of London and Paris, occasionally appearing in Barcelona, Australia and Madrid fashion weeks. She was chosen by acquaintance Kate Moss to model for the December/January 2005/2006 issue of Vogue: Paris, which Moss guest edited. Immediately after, she also appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia's January 2006 issue, photographed by Steven Meisel. L\u0103z\u0103reanu has since become an increasingly popular fashion model, breaking the record for most runway work in one season. She has modelled for many top designers, including Chanel, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, Anna Sui, Lanvin, Versace, and many more. She is affiliated with the modeling agencies The Society Management in New York City, Elite Model Management in Paris, Why Not Models in Milan, and Select Model Management in London. In March 2007, L\u0103z\u0103reanu was chosen by Kate Moss as the model for her new Topshop clothing range. == Personal style == L\u0103z\u0103reanu is known for her quirky, vintage-inspired style \u2013 which has arguably contributed to the rise of her modelling career. When asked about her style, L\u0103z\u0103reanu says: \"I\u2019m very influenced by the whole 1960s\u20131970s London era, not only in terms of my clothes but also in terms of the music I listen to, the movies I watch, the writers I read. Those influences probably translates into my personal style in an unconscious way.\" Michelle McCool of Cosmopolitan magazine writes that \"(Irina) has a great rock'n'roll vibe. It's all about the hair and her flatness. I love that she has no boobs.\" L\u0103z\u0103reanu is often described as having a distinctive look, as Emmanuelle Alt of Vogue Paris adds; \"On the runway, no matter what, she cannot be transformed. She always has her unique look and style.\" As a result of her striking features and rock'n'roll semblance, L\u0103z\u0103reanu has developed the status of 'official muse' to designers Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re and Karl Lagerfeld, with whom she shot the Chanel Cruise campaign. == Music career == L\u0103z\u0103reanu met musician Pete Doherty then a member of the Libertines, at a party in Shepherd's Bush while she was a ballet student. Doherty and L\u0103z\u0103reanu bonded over their shared interest in artists such as Oscar Wilde and Nina Simone. L\u0103z\u0103reanu became closely involved with Doherty's band Babyshambles and toured with them in 2004, although she has denied the widespread rumor that she served as their drummer. L\u0103z\u0103reanu reportedly helped Doherty write the song \"La Belle et la B\u00eate\" which featured Kate Moss on the Babyshambles' Down in Albion album. She recorded a folk album, entitled Some Place Along the Way, which musician Sean Lennon produced and collaborated on. It was to be released in late 2006 but was delayed until 2010. L\u0103z\u0103reanu has said that \"My music isn't commercial...I just want to learn from people and do the best I can do\" and cites Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen and Joan Baez as her musical influences. In February 2007 L\u0103z\u0103reanu announced that she will collaborate with Sean Lennon and Pete Doherty on a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Girl from the North Country\". In December 2007, during a special presentation for Chanel in London, L\u0103z\u0103reanu debuted four songs off her album, which acted as the soundtrack to the show. Sean Lennon accompanied her on guitar. In June 2010 L\u0103z\u0103reanu organized a benefit concert in NYC and was set to perform with Doherty, Lennon, Charlotte Kemp Muhl, and Adam Green. Doherty was, however, refused entry into the United States \u2013 despite having a visa. The band played without him. == Personal life == L\u0103z\u0103reanu has twice been briefly engaged to musician Pete Doherty, first for a period in 2004 following the break-up of his band The Libertines< and then for the second time in October 2007. == References == == External links == * * * * * Irina L\u0103z\u0103reanu profile at Teen Vogue Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian female models Category:Romanian female models Category:People from Cluj-Napoca Category:People from Longueuil Category:Romanian emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian people of Romanian descent Category:Naturalized citizens of Canada Category:Canadian expatriates in England Category:Romanian expatriates in England Category:Models from Montreal ",
