    "text": "Cullen () is a rural village in County Tipperary, Ireland. The centre of the village is located at a junction of two roads in south Tipperary. These roads lead to Monard, Lattin, the \"Rocky Road\" and Oola respectively. The most direct route to Cullen is by turning left in Oola village over the railway bridge (coming from Tipperary Town direction) and branching left (signposted for Cullen) after the bridge. The village is located approximately 2 miles along this road. Cullen comprises few amenities. It is home to two public houses (pubs) namely Paddy Dawson's \"Publick House\" and Quinlan's Bar. Cullen also contains a Church and a cemetery. Cullen/Lattin soccer pitch is the venue for the Cullen/Lattin soccer team. It is called this because the villages of Cullen and Lattin (approx. 4 miles from Cullen) are joined as one parish in the Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. ==Sport== The GAA affiliations of the joint parish is concentrated in the village of Lattin; the team called Lattin/Cullen (to differentiate with the soccer team Cullen/Lattin). Up the so-called \"Rocky Road\" there are glorious views of the natural landscape and farmlands. Also, there exists what is known as the \"Millennium Cross\", erected in 2000. Unlike Lattin and its lands, Cullen has a much more active shooting heritage and membership. Cullen is part of the shooting club known as \"E.L.C.O. Gun Club\" (Emly, Lattin, Cullen, Oola Gun club). This gun club is open for membership to residents and former residents of the lands within the E.L.C.O. area. ==Archaeology== Longstone Rath and the Golden Bog of Cullen are notable nearby historic sites. ==People== Nicky English, the former Tipperary hurler and manager, was born and raised in Cullen, living in what was a small shop run by his parents. ==See also== * List of towns and villages in Ireland ==References== Category:Towns and villages in County Tipperary Category:Articles on towns and villages in Ireland possibly missing Irish place names ",
