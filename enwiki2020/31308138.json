It is reported by the Muslim Scholar Ibn Hisham, that he told \u2018Abd al-Rahman: > Fight everyone in the way of God and kill those who disbelieve in God. Do > not be deceitful with spoils, do not be treacherous, nor mutilate,do not > kill children. This is God\u2019s ordinance and practice of his prophet among > you. > [Ibn Hisham, Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 672] \u2018Abd al-Rahman set out with 700 men on an expedition to Dumat al-Jandal, that is on the route to Khaybar, Fadak. The place was a great trading center; the inhabitants were mainly Christians and were ruled by a Christian king. Following the Islamic rule, on reaching Dumatul Jandal, \u2018Abd al-Rahman summoned the people of the tribe to embrace Islam within three days grace. During the 3 day period, Al-Asbagh, a Christian chief of Banu Kalb complied and many of his followers also followed suit. Other tribes also paid tribute (Jizya) to \u2018Abd al-Rahman. On agreement to pay Jizya tax regularly, they were allowed to keep their Christianity. Muhammad received the news through a Messenger, and then instructed \u2018Abd al-Rahman to marry Tamadhir, the daughter of the Christian chief, Al-Asbagh. So \u2018Abd al-Rahman married Tumadhir bint Asbagh, the daughter of the Christian king and brought this lady with him to Medina. ==References== Category:627 Category:Campaigns ordered by Muhammad ",
