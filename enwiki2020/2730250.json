    "text": "Chittaranjan Locomotive Works is a Government electric locomotive manufacturer based in India. It is located at Chittaranjan in Asansol Sadar subdivision with an ancillary unit in Dankuni. It is the largest locomotive production unit in the world with a record of 431 locomotives produced in the year 2019-20 . Almost all electric locomotives running on Indian Railways are manufactured at CLW. WAP-7 Loco AC coaching locomotive suitable for Hauling Mail/Express train and having 6000 HP, 140 km/h, 20.5 axle load, 6 axle, energy Generation features WAG-9H starting tractive effort of 51T, max speed 100 km/h, AC freight loco with crew friendly cab and energy regeneration features. thumb| WAG-9HC, max speed 100 km/h on 31 December 2018 == Introduction == \"Rolling Stock\", is obviously the most essential requirement of a railway system. Though the railway system was introduced in India over hundred years ago, no systematic and large scale efforts were made to establish indigenous industry for meeting in full these basic requirements of Railways. The Indian Railways have, therefore, all along been dependent on imports for meeting their requirements of coaches, wagons locomotives and their components. A small beginning was no doubt made in the direction of locomotive manufacture in the East Indian Railway Workshop at Jamalpurm 1885 and in the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway Workshop at Ajmer in 1896. The manufacture of locomotives in these workshops was, however, of a sporadic nature and it only formed a side activity of these two workshops, which were primarily repair workshops.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/58198/1/ec_01_32_1955.pdf page 8 It was not unnatural, therefore, that Indian public opinion should have continuously demanded that arrangements be made for the manufacture of locomotives required for India\u2019s needs in the country. The agitation became particularly strong after the First World War, when import of new locomotives became difficult and existing locomotives had either completely broken down through wear and tear involved during the war or were in a dismal state of disrepair. In the Legislative Assembly during the twenties of the present century, there was a furore of agitation by Indian leaders of all shades of opinion. No effective steps were, however, taken by the Railway authorities to enlarge the scope of locomotive manufacture at Jamalpur and Ajmer. Various practical difficulties were pointed out and reasons plausible and otherwise were advanced in favour of continuing the existing practice of importing locomotives from Britain. The conclusion could not be easily escaped that in this matter, as in many others, those in charge of the Railways at the time, were more interested in the welfare and prosperity of British industries, and preferred to extend the patronage of Indian Railways to British locomotive factories, rather than taking steps towards developing this industry in India.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/58198/1/ec_01_32_1955.pdf page 9 == Srinivasan Committee == Finally in July, 1939 a committee was appointed consisting of a Mechanical Engineer and Finance Officer, Mr. J. Humpherey and Mr. K. C. Srinivasan respectively to examine in detail the scheme of starting the manufacture of locomotives in some of the existing workshops in India and to report on the initial cost and financial implications of such a venture. The Committee, however, recommended that the manufacture of locomotives, despite the war and even because of it, should be taken up at once. steps were taken to implement the recommendations oif the Committee. During the war, the shortage of locomotives became more and more apparent. This only served to emphasise the urgency and the imperative necessity for India to become independent and self-sufficient in respect of locomotives and other equipment necessary for railway operation.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/58198/1/ec_01_32_1955.pdf page 10 \"It was not till 1945 that any serious consideration was even to the recommendations of the Srinivasan Committee. A provisional site at Chandmari in the then imdivided Bengal was selected. Not much progress could be made at this site, bec&use; of political changes leading to the partition of India. In 1947, the present site, where the Chittaranjan is located, was finally chosen\". == Location of the Project == ===Selection of site=== Chittaranjan is ideally located for an industrial undertaking of this nature. It is situated within 10 miles of West Bengal\u2019s rich coal belt and only 6 miles from the Maithan Dam of the Damodar Valley Corporation from where Hydro-Electric energy will be obtained. The Maithon reservoir will also provide a source of perennial water supply for the township and the workshop. The hilly nature of the country facilitates easy drainage, so important for the establishment of a clean, healthy township and the excellent climatic conditions are expected to ensure a high level of labour attendance and efficiency. Workshop and the colony are spread over an area of over 7 square miles.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/58198/1/ec_01_32_1955.pdf ===Township=== Chittaranjan has 5,070 residential quarters, 71 miles of road, 120 miles of piping for water supply and 100 miles of water borne sewage. Every single house has a minimum of two rooms, verandah and courtyai-d, electricity, continuous supply of filtered water, its own sanitary pi\u2019ivy and batii. E ach house in Chittaranjan has been provided with the basic facilities of a modem home. The township has been planned in separate colonies of composite self-sufficient units, each of which has its shopping centre, maternity clinic, school, playground, dispensary, park, social amenity and recreation centres. There are at present in Chittaranjen 5 dispensaries, 4 maternity and health centres. 7 basic schools, 4 community halls and 6 parks. The main hospital has 50 beds and is centrally situated to provide medical facilities for all residents of the township. Two high schools, one for boys and the other for girls, provide secondary education to the young inhabitants.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/58198/1/ec_01_32_1955.pdf ===Water supply=== The principal source of water supply at present is the AjaiRiver, a slender hill stream, wlilch passes around the township. As the river gets dried up during the three dry months of April, May and June, an artificial lake with a capacity of 360,000,000 gallons has been built by constructing a 1,600 ft. long and 40 ft. high dam across one of the main out- fall streams to tide over the summer months. At present, a sub-merged dam across the Ajai leads water through a sealed channel into an intake well and thence to the filter beds in the centre of the township with a capacity of 2 million gallons per day.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/58198/1/ec_01_32_1955.pdf ===Power Supply=== Electricity was first generated by a number of small portable plants. Subsequently, when the three 600 kW thermal standby sets were ready, energy was obtained from these, and in December, 1950, when the D.V.C. temporary packet sets at Kamardhubi were brought in, power was obtained from there at 11 kV 3-phase, 50-cycle A.C. Since January, 1952, power is being supplied from Sindri at 33 kV over D.V.C. grid. The Committee imderstand that of the three 600 K.W. thermal standby sets, one has been released to the N.E. Railway, Gorakhpur, and until the D.V.C. supply is guaranteed, it is not proposed to release the balance == Overview == Founded in 1950, the Indian Railway production unit is named after the Indian freedom-fighter Chittaranjan Das. The manufacturing unit was established at a place close to the Chittaranjan railway station. The township, which included the factory, of roadways, 43 schools, 9131 staff quarters, 8 clinics (including a 190-bed hospital) and 7 markets, was built at a cost of and had a population of over 80,000. The factory commenced the production of steam locomotives on 26 January 1950 (the date when India formally declared itself a Republic), in collaboration with the North British Locomotive Company. On 1 November 1950, Indian President Dr. Rajendra Prasad formally dedicated the first steam rail- engine produced by the company (a WG class locomotive bearing the registration number 8401) to the freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittranjan Das. The name of the nearby railway station Mihijam was also changed to Chittaranjan. Many of the specialized machinery required for steam locomotive manufacture was obtained from the Vulcan Foundry in England, previously a major supplier of locomotives to India, which at this time was moving from building steam locomotives to diesel. In the post-1968s, the factory began to manufacture diesel-hydraulic locomotives. The production of steam and diesel locomotives were discontinued in 1972 and 1993 respectively. The company has since been manufacturing only electric rail-engines. It is now the only government electric loco producing factory in India. The factory obtains its iron & steel from different steel plants of SAIL, RINL & MDN, and sometimes from private steel plants like TATA, Jamshespur or JINDAL STEEL etc. and hydel power from PGCIL and DVC (Maithan dam). The township under CLW is bordered by high boundaries and 3 main gates, and guarded by Railway Protection Force, Railway Protection Special Force and the West Bengal police. ==History== The planners of the nation with their prudence planned to set up a loco building factory in the eastern part of the country. In the late 1930s, a committee consisting of M/s Humphries and Shrinivasan was constituted to consider the possibility of establishing a locomotive manufacture unit and its economic facilities. The initial project at Chandmari, a place east to Kalyani in the state of West Bengal, could not mature due to partition, which inevitably necessitated a change of site. This present site at Chittaranjan was chosen after a fresh survey and for this the approval of Railway board was obtained in 1947. The Railway Board decided to locate the factory at Chittaranjan, near Mihijam. On the 9thof January 1948, survey of the proposed area was commenced. The rocky soil was an advantage in erecting foundations for heavy structural work and the undulating terrain solved the problem of drainage for the township while the schemes of the DVC which envisaged hydro-electric and thermal power stations in the vicinity assured adequate power availability for the enterprise.. The locoworks originally called Loco Building Works was initially established for production of 120 average sized steam locomotives with the capacity to manufacture 50 spare boilers. Production of steam loco commenced on 26th January, 1950. The first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad dedicated the first steam locomotive to the nation on 1st November, 1950 and on the same day the Loco Building Factory was rechristened and named after the great Patriot, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das and became Chittaranjan Locomotive Works. Apart from meeting the growing and varied needs of Indian Railways, CLW has been right from inception, adopting modern designs and upgrading technology, gradually enhancing the haulage capacities and speeds of locomotives. It is the only major Electric Locomotive manufacturer in the country. It is situated at the Border of West Bengal and Jharkhand and is at about 32 km from Asansol and 237 kms from Kolkata. The place where today CLW is situated was actually a collection of small villages. The locoworks with its ancillary workshops has a stores purchase office in Kolkata and inspection cells in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bangalore. The Workshop and the township is spread over an area of 18.34 Sq. Km. Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) started producing locomotives from the year 1950, the same year the township was formally established. The approximate value of the imported parts required for the manufacture of locomotives at the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works is Rs. 1,25,000 per locomotive in the year 1955.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/55867/1/lsd_01_09_30-03-1955.pdf page 27 Starting with steam engines, CLW now produces state-of-the-art Electrical engines capable of running at 160 km/h and upgradable up to 200 km/h. The production of Diesel Hydraulic Locomotives was taken up during 1968. After manufacturing 2351 Steam Locomotives of 5 types and 842 Diesel Hydraulic Locos of 7 types, production of steam and diesel hydraulic locos was discontinued from 1973-74 and 1993-94 respectively. The production of Electric Locomotives commenced in 1961. In the process, fifteen versions of electric locomotives were produced by CLW and the latest in that series is the freight locomotive WAG-9i and passenger locomotive WAP-7. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, commissioned the first 1500 V dc Locomotive named /LOKMANYA/ o\u00adn 14th October, 1961. The production of 25 kV AC DC loco commenced o\u00adn 16th November, 1963. The first Electric Loco turned out from CLW, christened as ?BIDHAN? was a Broad Gauge 25 kV A.C. freight Locomotive (WAG-1) of 2840 hp with maximum speed of 80 km/hr. Subsequently CLW gradually upgraded the horsepower of Electric Loco from 2840 hp to 6000 hp and maximum speed from 80 Km/h to 160 km/h. CLW also built 25 kV AC/1500 V DC, AC/DC Loco, WCAM-1 for hauling Mail / Express Trains from BRC to BCT o\u00adn W. Rly. CLW became the first production unit in the developing countries, second in Asia and fifth in the world to manufacture, state of the art, 3-phase GTO Thyristor controlled Electric Locomotive and the first indigenous 6000 hp freight electric loco WAG-9. This was christened as /NAVYUG/ and was turned out o\u00adn 14th November, 1998. During the year 2000-01 the first passenger version of three phase loco WAP-5 /NAVODIT/, with maximum service speed of 160 km/h and having a potential upto 200 km/h, was manufactured. Development of sources, indigenisation and cost reduction of three-phase loco have been the highest priority items. The cost of 3 phase loco has been drastically brought down from a high of Rs. 35 crores for imported locos to about Rs.13.5 crores. It is hoped that this will further be reduced, if the number of such locomotives manufactured by CLW is increased. Production of DC Traction Motors and Control Equipment commenced in April, 1967. Currently both DC & AC traction motors are being manufactured. Steel foundry was set up in 1962-63 for manufacture of cast steel loco parts. CLW has in house facilities for machining and assembly of wheel sets, fabrication and machining of bogies etc. The facilities include modern CNC machines, plasma-cutting machines, inert gas welding sets etc River Ajay flows past CLW along its northern side. Workshops, offices and quarters are spread over the whole are with ample space in between \u2013 surrounded by greenery and trees. There are several water bodies in CLW exhibiting a lush green environment which attract a large number of migratory birds every year. A variety of flora and fauna can be seen here all the year round. Long before others became environment conscious, CLW administration started planting trees, thus turning an arid area into a green o\u00adne. In 1996 alone 90,000 saplings were planted with the help of the Social Forestry Division of Government of West Bengal. In 2005 also 50,000 saplings have been planted with the help of same agency. The Administration is regularly educating the staff and encouraging them to preserve the environment. Recently, an immense amount of work has been done, with a view to conserve the Environment, as well as using of all the existing natural resources in an eco-friendly manner. The efforts have been recognized by the World Environment Foundation and the Golden Peacock award for Environment Management 2006, has been conferred o\u00adn 9th June 2006. CLW has complied fully with the provisions of the Industrial Safety Act, 1948. CLW in its safety policy aims to ensure 100% safety for all workers working in Chittaranjan Locomotive Works. CLW is the proud recipient of the Safety innovation award 2006. The award was conferred o\u00adn CLW o\u00adn 6th September, 2006 by the Safety and Quality forum of the Institute of Engineers (India). We repeated the illustrious performance in the year 2009 and CLW was again conferred the Safety innovation award o\u00adn 30.09.09. == Milestones of Chittaranjan Locomotive Works == {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" |+Timeline of C.L.W |1947 |September |Site for Chittaranjan Locomotive Works located. |- |1948 |March |Construction work started. |- |1948 |April |Workshop Set up |- |1950 |26 January |Production inaugurated by Smt.
