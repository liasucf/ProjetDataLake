Max Beloff, History Today. Retrieved 7 June 2015. Saul Dubow in H-Net noted the uneven quality of the chapters in volume III and also the difficulty of such an endeavour given the state of historiography of the British Empire and the impossibility of maintaining a triumphalist tone in the modern era. Dubow also felt that some of the authors had tended \"to 'play safe', awed perhaps by the monumental nature of the enterprise\".

Madhavi Kale of Bryn Mawr College, writing in Social History, also felt that the history took a traditional approach to the historiography of the empire and placed the English, and to a lesser extent the Scottish, Irish and Welsh at the centre of the account, rather than the subject peoples of the empire. Kale summed up her review of volumes III-V of the history by saying it represented \"a disturbingly revisionist project that seeks to neutralize ... the massive political and military brutality and repression\" of the empire.\"Reviews\", Madhavi Kale, Social History, Vol. 27, No. 2 (May, 2002), pp. 250-253. ==See also== *Historiography of the British Empire ==References== Category:1998 non-fiction books Category:1999 non- fiction books Category:Series of history books Category:Historiography of the British Empire Category:Oxford University Press books ",
