It was an important railway station on the line Adrianopol-Thessaloniki. Urlu joined Bulgaria during the First Balkan War and according to the Treaty of London (1913). The Treaty of \u0130stanbul (1913) returned it to Turkey, but in 1915, during World War I, Turkey ceded the area of Didymoteicho to its ally Bulgaria, and the town was renamed Kableshkovo. During the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) it was ceded to Greece and it received the present name. Its Bulgarian and Turkish population was exchanged with Greek refugees, mainly from today's Turkey. ==See also== *List of settlements in the Evros regional unit ==External links== *Thourio on GTP Travel Pages ==References== Category:Populated places in Evros (regional unit) ",
