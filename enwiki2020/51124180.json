He is the founder chairman of Anthropology Department of the University of Dhaka. Chowdhury was appointed the vice-chancellor of Green University of Bangladesh in February 2008 and Bangladesh Islami University in April 2014. ===Controversy=== On 1 August 2002, Chowdhury, along with proctor Nazrul Islam, resigned from the vice- chancellor position of the University of Dhaka following an assault into Shamsunnahar Hall, a female hall, by male police on July 23. The female students had been protesting the illegal stay of political activists in the university dormitories. Chowdhury faced criticism at that time for failing to take measures against the police assault. In August 2015, a trust fund, worth of 600,000 Taka, named \"Professor DR Anwarullah Chowdhury Trust Fund\" was established at Anthropology Department of the University of Dhaka. The trust fund was revoked within a month, following student protests against it. In February 2018, Chowdhury was appointed as a part-time teacher of the anthropology department. But he was relieved from the duty within a week. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1945 births Category:People from Feni District Category:University of Dhaka alumni Category:Delhi School of Economics alumni Category:University of Dhaka faculty Category:Bangladeshi academics Category:Ambassadors of Bangladesh to Bahrain Category:Vice- Chancellors of the University of Dhaka ",
