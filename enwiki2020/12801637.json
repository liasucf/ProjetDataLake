Studio Litho is owned by guitarist Stone Gossard. The band worked with producer Nick DiDia. The album was mixed by DiDia and Brendan O'Brien. The album featured a more polished sound compared with the band's debut album, Shame. ==Release== Interiors was met with poor sales, however the band saw its cult audience expand.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas and Torreano, Bradley. \"[ Brad]\". AllMusic. Retrieved on January 31, 2009. The lead single from Interiors, \"The Day Brings\", features Mike McCready from Pearl Jam on lead guitar. The album charted at number 30 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. A music video was made for the song \"The Day Brings\". Interiors was accompanied by a tour in the United States and Canada in 1997, as well as a small tour in Australia and New Zealand in 1998. ===Reception=== Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic awarded the album three stars. He wrote \"Given its title, it perhaps shouldn't come as a surprise that Interiors is an introspective collection, but its tempered sound is somewhat of a shock when considering the grunge background of the entire band.\" Erlewine compared the album's sound to 1970s soft rock, which contrasts Gossard's primary band Pearl Jam, whose sound is more reminiscent of 1970s hard rock. Tom Moon of Rolling Stone said that \"what's most notable about Interiors...is the pure pop focus of these nuanced compositions.\" ==Track listing== ;Japanese bonus tracks ==Personnel== ;Brad *Stone Gossard \u2013 guitars, painting *Regan Hagar \u2013 drums, package design *Shawn Smith \u2013 vocals, piano, organ *Jeremy Toback \u2013 bass guitar ;Additional musicians and production *Matt Bayles \u2013 recording *Brad \u2013 production *Nick DiDia \u2013 production, recording, mixing *Shelly Gossard \u2013 production coordination *Bashiri Johnson \u2013 percussion *Steve Marcusson \u2013 mastering *Mike McCready \u2013 additional guitar on \"The Day Brings\" *Lance Mercer, Fabienne Toback, Harry Wirth \u2013 photos *Brendan O'Brien \u2013 mixing, additional keyboards on \"I Don't Know\", additional guitar on \"Lift\", \"I Don't Know\", and \"Some Never Come Home\" *John Riegart, Tom Schick, Ryan Williams, Mike Wilson \u2013 assistance *Wendy Sutter \u2013 cello on \"Upon My Shoulders\" ==Chart positions== {|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" !
