    "text": "Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre is a meetings, conventions and exhibitions centre located at the junctions of Nicoll Highway, Raffles Boulevard and Temasek Boulevard in Singapore's Central Business District, next to Esplanade MRT station. It was officially opened on 30 August 1995 and it has a total of 42,000 square metres of space over multiple levels. The centre can hold events from 10 to 10,000 people and is directly accessible to various shopping, dining and hotel options. In October 2012, Suntec Convention Centre closed its doors to undergo a S$184 million modernisation programme and officially reopened in June 2013. The revamp focused on providing flexibility and functionality with the integration of advanced technology. Today, the centre's chefs can serve 10,000 meals daily, and the free high-speed WiFi within the centre allows 6,000 concurrent users at any time. The entrance at Suntec has also become a popular landmark for phototaking by tourists due to the installation of the world's largest HD Video Wall. ==Description of venue== Due to the intention of making its space flexible, the Centre has made its 42,000 m\u00b2 of event space customisable for events of varying scales. On Level 3, the space can be configured for group meetings or large exhibitions using the soundproofed operable wall systems. The system allows the space to be split into a maximum of 36 custom-made meeting rooms. Aside from hosting regular consumer exhibitions, the Centre's large multi-purpose exhibition halls on Level 4 can also be converted into settings for conferences, plenary sessions or ballrooms with a programmable LED lighting solution. The column- free exhibition space in the Level 6 auditoriums boasts high ceilings, heavy- duty floor loading capacity and rigging systems, making it an ideal venue for concerts, product launches, sporting events and other large-scale events. Currently, the Level 6 auditorium is used by City Harvest Church (which owns 39.2% of the building) for their services over the weekend, while it remains available for Suntec to market as event space during the week while Faith Community Baptist Church uses the Nicoll Rooms at Level 3 for their weekend English services through a lease. ==Hall capacity== The convention centre's level 4 and 6 have the following hall capacities. Level 4: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Level 4 of Suntec Convention Centre !Hall !Maximum Usable Floor Area (SQM) |- |Halls 401-402 |3,890 |- |Halls 401-406 |12,000 |- |Hall 403 |2,220 |- |Hall 404 |2,000 |- |Hall 405 |1,969 |- |Hall 406 |1,843 |} Level 6: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Level 6 of Suntec Convention Centre !Hall !Maximum Usable Floor Area (SQM) |- |Halls 601-602 |4,000 |- |Halls 601-604 |8,000 |- |Halls 601-605 |9,935 |- |Halls 603-604 |4,000 |- |Hall 606 |1,155 |} ==Key events== Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre has hosted numerous local and international events, from consumer/tradeshows to exhibitions and conferences. In August 2010, Suntec Singapore was a key venue for the Youth Olympic Games, hosting sports such as Boxing, Fencing, Handball, Judo, Taekwondo and Wrestling. Since then, the Centre has hosted other high- profile meetings, exhibitions and conventions. These events span across different industries such as dental (International Dental Exhibition and Meeting), health (World Confederation for Physical Therapy Congress) and information services (IFLA World Library and Information Congress) among others. In August 2019, Suntec Singapore will launch a knowledge-based online platform for its MICE customers and event organisers. Named Essential Virtual Assistant (EVA), the platform works like a search engine. Users can type in keyword(s) and a list of search results containing all the relevant information will appear. EVA will be available on Suntec Singapore's website. Due to the ban of large gatherings in view of COVID-19 pandemic, all events are suspended until further notice. These include GovernmentWare Conference & Exhibition, Tourism Industry Conference, Singapore Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE), COMEX, IT Show, CEE Show, The Tech Show, Cloud Expo Asia, Tech in Asia, Cards Asia and Baby Expo. In addition, Suntec Convention Centre is also temporarily closed until further notice. Mitigation measures do involve the hosting of election e-rallies and National Day Parade evening shows. ==Awards== The convention centre has received the following awards: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Award !Awarded by |- | rowspan=\"7\" |2019 |Business Eminence Award 2019 |Dun & Bradstreet |- |Best Convention Centre 2019 |9th Global Eventex Awards |- |Corporate Excellence Award 2019 |Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Awards |- |Friend of the Arts |National Arts Council |- |\u201cPassion Made Possible\u201d Unsung Hero Award 2019 - Sivakumaran Ramalinggam |Singapore Tourism Board & Northstar Meetings Group |- |NTUC Health Friends Award 2019: Silver |NTUC Health Co-operative Limited |- |Top 100 Asia's Best Employer Brand Awards 2019-2020 |Employer Branding Institute - India |- | rowspan=\"13\" |2018 |World's Leading Meetings & Conference Centre |World Travel Awards 2018 |- |Asia's Leading Meetings & Conference Centre |World Travel Awards 2018 |- |Best Homegrown Event - Sprout 2018 |The Marketing Events Awards 2018 |- |Digital Innovation Award |The Global Association of the Exhibition Industry (UFI) Awards 2018 |- |Human Resources Award |The Global Association of the Exhibition Industry (UFI) Awards 2018 |- |Best F&B;
