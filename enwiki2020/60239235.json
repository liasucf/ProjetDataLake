    "text": "All Together Now (also known with local varying titles in some countries broadcasting the format) is a reality television singing competition format created by British television production company Remarkable Television, a brand of Endemol Shine UK. ==History== The format began in 2018 with the British television series on BBC One; its first adaptation was the Brazilian series known as Canta Comigo followed by Danish and Australian editions under the title All Together Now and a Polish edition \u015apiewajmy razem. All Together Now. Many other countries have scheduled local editions including Colombia (Todos Juntos Ahora), France (Together, tous avec moi), Germany (Sing Mit Mir), Italy (All Together Now), Netherlands (All Together Now), Romania (C\u00e2nt\u0103 acum cu mine) and Russia (\u041d\u0443-\u043a\u0430, \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435). ==Format== In each episode, a range of singers take to the stage, but waiting to judge each performance is \u2018The 100\u2019 \u2013 a unique panel of one hundred music experts and performers from across the country. In the initial UK edition was hosted by Spice Girl, Geri Horner. The first British season consisted of six episodes: five heats and the final. ===The heats=== During each heat, performers try and outscore their competitors in order to earn a seat on the top three podium. Whenever a performer scores high enough for a podium place, the act in 3rd place is eliminated as a result. From each heat, two acts go through to the series final. Once all acts have sung, the 1st placed performer with the highest score automatically goes through. The acts in 2nd and 3rd sing off against one another and the winner of that sing off earns the second qualification spot. Prior to filming, all performers choose the song they want to sing. The 100 learn the words to all the songs before the show, but they don\u2019t know who is going to come out and sing said songs to them. Each song is approximately 90 seconds long, but importantly the 100 can only join in for the final 60 seconds as signified by a lighting change. This means that the 100 have the same amount of time to join in the singing for every act. ===Tie-breaks=== In the event of a tied score, the 100 review the full performances of both acts on monitors in studio. Each member of the 100 decides which act they prefer and votes by pressing their button. The act with the most votes takes their seat on the podium, meaning that the act with the fewer votes either drops down a podium place or exits the competition. In the event that the tiebreak vote is also tied, the host, as captain of the 100 has the casting vote. ===The sing-off=== For the sing-off at the end of the show, scores are reset to zero and the 2nd and 3rd placed acts perform a new song chosen from a given shortlist. In the event that both acts wish to sing the same song from that shortlist, the performer in 2nd place has priority. ===The final and the prize=== In the final, the ten finalists (the first placed performer and sing- off winner from each heat) perform again in front of The 100 with a new song. This time, all three acts who finish in the top three podium seats sing again and the act with the highest score after this final sing off wins the series and with it a cash prize. ==International versions== : Currently airing franchise : Franchise awaiting confirmation : Franchise with an upcoming season : Unknown status : Cancelled during development : Franchise no longer in production {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:18px; width:100%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12%;\"| Country/Region ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;\"| Name ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Network ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:08%;\"| Premiere ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Host(s) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:25%;\"| Winners ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:05%;\"| |- | style=\"background:#FCA9A9; text-align:left;\"| '''''' |All Together Now | Seven Network | October 7, 2018 | | | |- | rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#90EE90; text-align:left;\" | '''''' | rowspan=\"1\" | Canta Comigo | rowspan=\"4\" | RecordTV | rowspan=\"1\" | July 18, 2018 | | | rowspan=\"4\" | |- | rowspan=\"1\" | Canta Comigo Teen | rowspan=\"1\" | October 4, 2020 | | |- | Canta Comigo Especial | December 17, 2018 | | |- | rowspan=\"1\" | Canta Comigo All-Stars | rowspan=\"1\" | | |- | style=\"background:#90EE90; text-align:left;\"| '''''' |A Otro Nivel 3: Canta Conmigo | Caracol | February 5, 2020 | | | |- | style=\"background:lightblue; text-align:left;\"| '''''' |All Together Now: Danmark | Kanal 5 | August 18, 2018 | | | |- | style=\"background:#E0B0FF; text-align:left;\"| '''''' |All Together Now Suomi | Nelonen | October 24, 2020 | | | |- | style=\"background:lightblue; text-align:left;\"|'''''' |Together, tous avec moi | M6 W9 | April 30, 2019 | | | |- | style=\"background:#CCCCCC; text-align:left;\"| '''''' |Sing Mit Mir | RTL | | | | |- | style=\"background:lightblue; text-align:left;\"|'''''' |All Together Now | Canale 5 | May 16, 2019 | | | |- | style=\"background:lightblue; text-align:left;\"| '''''' |All Together Now | RTL4 | May 3, 2019 | | | |- | style=\"background:#E0B0FF; text-align:left;\"| '''''' |All Together Now Norge | TVNorge | January 8, 2019 | | | |- | style=\"background:#FCA9A9; text-align:left;\"| '''''' |\u015apiewajmy razem.
