    "text": "For Lovers Only is a 1995 covers/pop standards album by The Temptations for the Motown label, something of a sequel to their 1967 album The Temptations in a Mellow Mood. The album features the final recordings of Melvin Franklin, who fell ill during recording and died before the album's release. Franklin was replaced on the tracks he does not sing on by Parliament-Funkadelic's Ray Davis in his only album appearance with the group. The first single, \"Some Enchanted Evening\", reached #40 on the Urban Adult Contemporary charts. The album was also the final Temptations album for Ali-Ollie Woodson, who would be released from the group by Otis Williams in 1996, after having suffered several bouts of throat cancer. For Lovers Only was reissued in 2002 with a bonus track, a remix of \"Night & Day\" as included on the soundtrack to What Women Want. ==Track listing== #\"Some Enchanted Evening\" (Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II) (lead singer: Ali Woodson and Theo Peoples) #\"I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face\" (Alan J.
