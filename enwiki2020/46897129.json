The phrase may also be translated as \"Live and work for the benefit of all mankind.\"\"The Practice of Hongik Ingan: Lives of Queen Seondeok, Shin Saimdang, and Yi Yulgok\" by the Korean Spirit and Cultural Project, published by the Diamond Sutra Recitation Group, March 2011 The Korean Spirit and Cultural Promotion Project's blog describes Hongik Ingan as \"the original founding philosophy of Korea, which transcends the boundaries of ideology and religion.\" This philosophy is represented in the lives of Queen Seondeok, Shin Saimdang, and Shin Saimdang's son, Yi Yulgok, \"who were all distinguished by their self-discipline, reverence, compassion and\" devotion to duty in the face of hardships. Queen Seondeok of Silla, the first female monarch in Korean history ruled the Silla Kingdom from 632 to 647 C.E.ibid Shin Saimdang lived from 1504 C.E. to c. 1551 C.E. She grew up on her maternal grandparents' house without male siblings, relatively free from the patriarchial order of the society. Saimdang was a courtesy name meaning \"generosity\". That Saimdang has a courtesy name\u2014a privilege normally granted only to male aristocrats\u2014is a tribute to her efforts to overcome the limitations that society placed on women.ibid Yi Yulgok (1536 C.E. \u2013 1584 C.E) was a son of Shin Saimdang. He was a prodigy who made a significant contribution to Confucian thought.ibid ==References== Category:National symbols of South Korea Category:National mottos ",
