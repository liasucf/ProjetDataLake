    "text": "The Triple Crown Tournament was a cricket competition staged annually from 1993 to 2001 between the Home Nations; that is to say Ireland, Scotland, Wales and a team representing England. England were not represented by the professional English cricket team, but rather by an England Amateur XI in 1993 and 1994, by an England National Cricket Association XI in 1995 and 1996, and an England Cricket Board XI from 1997 onwards. Matches were one-day affairs, and were 55 overs a side in the first three tournaments, but 50 overs thereafter. Although internationals, they are considered minor matches, that is, games without the List A status granted to more important one-day competitions. The venue for the tournament rotated around the four competing nations, with England hosting the first competition.
