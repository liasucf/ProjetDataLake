Mr. Gas\u0131ml\u0131 is a member of the Board of Directors of Azerbaijan Press Council and World Azerbaijanis\u2019 Coordination Council. ==Scientific career== His name is associated with the study and research of several essential issues\u2013 Azerbaijan's International cultural relations (1946-1991), UN discussion of conditions in Southern Azerbaijan after the movement of Sayyed Ja\u2019far Pishevari, Political relations between Azerbaijan and Turkey (1920 - 1922), Foreign countries and Azerbaijan (1920 - 1922), The activities of Armenian armed \u201cvolunteer\u201d gangs during the First World War, The policies of the great powers towards Azerbaijan during the First World War (1914 - 1918), Diplomatic and political relations between Turkey and the USSR (1960-1991), Azerbaijan and foreign countries (1920 - 1945), The \u201cArmenian issue\u201d to \u201cArmenian genocide\u201d (1724 - 1920), The South Caucasus and Entente countries and Relations between Russia and Turkey (1920 - 1923). Musa Gasimli has worked in the archives and published many valuable articles in Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey, United States, Georgia, UN in Austria, OSCE in the Czech Republic and the UK. His first major research work was in relation to Azerbaijan's international and cultural relations during the period after World War II until the Soviet Union's collapse. It was a successful start to research the dynamics of international and cultural relations during this period. The results of the study were based on rich archives under the control of the Center during Soviet rule. This monograph which was published in Baku also was published at \u201cArtanudji\u201d press in Georgia. From 1992-1993 Musa Gasimli discussed conditions in Iranian Azerbaijan after the Sayyed Ja\u2019far Pishevari movement at the newly established UN General Assembly and in 1993 published his research paper, \"Azerbaijan in International Politics\", at \"Azernashr\" press. This was a first step in Azerbaijani History. Gasimli raised the essence of disputes relating to Soviets troops in Iran between two representatives originally from Azerbaijan: an envoy from the Soviet Union in the UN (A.Vishinski) and an envoy from Iran (originally from the Ordubad region in Azerbaijan) - Sayyed Hasan Tagizadeh. He also touched upon US and Soviet politics in Iranian Azerbaijan. The author writes that the West believes that the Cold War was started first in Europe, but in fact the crisis emerged from Iranian Azerbaijan. Musa Gasimli denotes in his article: \u201c...for many years in non-scientific theses, the concept that that the US and other Western countries were guilty for the Cold War dominated\u201d. Now the \u201ccold war\u201d has ended. The main guilty party of this war, the Soviet empire, collapsed and the West was victorious. The issue of Azerbaijan became one of the most controversial in the field of international relations and was the first seed into the cold war after the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u2019s speech in Fulton in March 1945 (page 24-25). This was a new concept in Azerbaijani and world history that was first introduced by Musa Gasimli. Later, other Azerbaijani historians under Musa Gasimli\u2019s supervision conducted research on this issue and developed the concept of the start of the Cold war crisis in Iranian Azerbaijan. Professor Jamil Hasanli says in his article \u201cSouth Azerbaijan: between Tehran \u2013 Baku \u2013 Moscow (1939 \u2013 1945)\u201d published in 1998, that Professor Musa Gasimli's book \u201cThe Issue of Azerbaijan in International Relations\u201d can be considered as one of the most successful steps during recent years\" (page 12-13). Also, Professor Musa Gasimli researched the diplomatic and political relations of Azerbaijan with other countries, including Turkey, and the period of Bolshevik occupation until the establishment of the Soviet Union. These years involved a short period of independence of Azerbaijan. The author researched the means of Bolshevik Russia that put an end to Azerbaijan's foreign policy and closed representative offices. Along with Baku, this research was published as a book in Turkey and Iran. Professor Musa Gasimli for the first time in his country studied the policy of great powers towards Azerbaijan during World War I. In relation to this he is the author of a three-volume monograph. He investigated the activities of armed Armenian \u201cvolunteer\u201d gangs in the South Caucasus. On this subject he gave a number of speeches in international scientific symposiums and those reports have been published. Musa Gasimli also studied Azerbaijan's struggle for independence and problems with foreign countries during 1920-1945, wrote a large-volume monograph and the study was published in Istanbul's \u201cKaknus\u201d Press in 2006. The book was one of the best-selling books at a book fair in Frankfurt, Germany. Gasimli also studied the diplomatic and political struggle for influence between Russia, Turkey and Entente countries in the South Caucasus from 1920-1923. The professor also published a monograph based on the most reliable materials and archives related to the period starting from the decree of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great, until Armenian SSR in 1920, regarding the placement of Armenians in Azerbaijani territories, the capture of land, creation of armed gangs, as well as large-scale massacres of civil Muslim and Turkish populations. The monograph was published in Azerbaijani, Russian, Turkish and English in different countries.SSCB T\u00fcrkiye \u0130li\u015fkileri 14 large scale monographs and also about 82 scientific articles involving subjects which had never before been researched in Azerbaijani history until that time were published in the US, Argentina, Turkey, Great Britain, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Moldova, Georgia, Iran, Cyprus, Czech Republic and other countries in English, Spanish, Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Persian and other languages.
