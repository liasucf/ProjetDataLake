A heavy > volume of fire from an enemy machine gun positioned on the left flank of the > squad inflicted several casualties on Corporal Smedley's unit. > Simultaneously, an enemy rifle grenade exploded nearby, wounding him in the > right foot and knocking him to the ground. Corporal Smedley disregarded this > serious injury and valiantly struggled to his feet, shouting words of > encouragement to his men.

Although his aggressive and singlehanded attack resulted in > the destruction of the machine gun, he was struck in the chest by enemy fire > and fell mortally wounded. Corporal Smedley's inspiring and courageous > actions, bold initiative, and selfless devotion to duty in the face of > certain death were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine > Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for > his country. /S/ RICHARD M. NIXON ==In Memory== Grave at Arlington National Cemetery ;The Larry E.
