Dean voices these dreams to his father who disapproves, however Dean's brother, Kelly, convinces their father to relent. Dean travels to Canada to try out for the Hamilton Mustangs where he demonstrates his offensive skills but displays a lack of physical toughness. Carl Racki, who is competing for a spot, engages him in a fight and quickly defeats him. Despite this, the Mustangs head coach, a former NHL All- Star, selects Dean for the team. Dean also begins a flirtation with the coach's daughter, Jessie. After his team mentor, Derek Sutton, is deliberately injured by Racki (now with a rival team), Dean returns home. His brother inspires him to keep playing, and his father teaches him some fighting skills. Dean returns to the team, ready to confront Racki in the final game of the Memorial Cup playoffs. The game ends with a game-winning goal by Dean with 3 seconds left. As time expires, he confronts and defeats Racki in a fight and is carried off the ice on the shoulders of his teammates. ==Cast== *Rob Lowe as Dean Youngblood *Patrick Swayze as Derek Sutton *Cynthia Gibb as Jessie Chadwick *Eric Nesterenko as Blane Youngblood. A 20 year NHL veteran, Nesterenko was also the film's hockey consultant. *Jim Youngs as Kelly Youngblood *Ed Lauter as Murray Chadwick, the Mustangs Coach *Keanu Reeves as Heaver, the Mustangs goalie.

Ted Reeve Arena was used as the setting for the interior of the Hamilton Mustangs home rink while Scarborough Gardens Arena was used for the setting of the arena's exterior. St Michaels College School arena was used as well. Several of the cast and crew had actual hockey experience and skills, though star Rob Lowe had to learn to skate, and both he and Patrick Swayze, a better skater, used doubles for many of their on-ice skating scenes. Director and writer Peter Markle was a former minor-pro and international player for the USA. Cinematographer Mark Irwin, a Canadian, wore skates and a helmet and devised a special rig for shooting hockey scenes on the ice. The film's hockey consultant Eric Nesterenko was a two decade NHL veteran who also appeared as the father of the film's lead character. Keanu Reeves played goalie growing up and in high school. George Finn, who played villain Carl Racki, was a former OHL enforcer. Many of the other team members were actual NCAA or junior hockey players, some of whom went on to significant NHL careers. Lowe later said he \"hated\" learning how to skate. \"I don't like any sport where you're already exhausted when you're done putting on the equipment. But that said, once I got the equipment on and was out on the ice, I loved that. I loved hitting people, being hit, skating. I love the exertion and competition, so that was all great. But it's a lot of work putting all of that shit on! Give me a surfboard and let me just paddle into the ocean.\" ==Reception== The film gained a mediocre reception, with critics finding the plot derivative. However, it became a popular VHS video rental and cable TV showing. ==See also== * List of American films of 1986 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1986 films Category:1986 romantic drama films Category:1980s sports drama films Category:1980s teen drama films Category:1980s teen romance films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American sports drama films Category:American teen drama films Category:American teen romance films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Ontario Category:Films shot in Hamilton, Ontario Category:Films shot in Minnesota Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:American ice hockey films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:United Artists films Category:Films directed by Peter Markle Category:1986 drama films ",
