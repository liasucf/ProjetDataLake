In 1098 he was sent to Constantinople with Hugh of Vermandois after the siege of Antioch, to seek assistance from the Byzantine emperor. He disappeared during a raid by the Seljuk Turks in Anatolia, and was presumably killed. While on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1106, Ida organized a search for her lost husband in Anatolia but to no avail. Ida's fate remains unknown. ==Notes== == Sources == * * Category:Countesses of Hainaut Category:11th-century births Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1139 deaths ",
