    "text": "AM is the second studio album by Spanish pop music artist Abraham Mateo. It was released on November 12, 2013, through Sony Music Spain. The album debuted at number six on the Spain's Top 100 albums chart and was listed for 52 weeks. It was certified Gold in Spain. AM was recorded in Madrid and Miami and represented a change in Mateo's music style: in addition to ballad songs, it also included pop and electropop music, and Spanglish lyrics. Mateo rose to popularity with AM's first single, \"Se\u00f1orita\", released in November 2012. The song, written by Herbie Crichlow and Thomas Troelsen, was listed for 40 weeks on the Spain's Top 50 singles chart, peaked on number three, and was certified Gold in Spain. The music video for \"Se\u00f1orita\" was the most trending music video of 2013 on YouTube Spain. The album's second single, \"Girlfriend\", written by Charlie Mason, Jani H\u00f6lli and Gabriel Warmby, was released early October 2013 and debuted within the top fifteen in Spain. The third and last single, \"L\u00e1nzalo\", written by his producer Jacobo Calder\u00f3n and Mateo himself, was released in March 2014 as a charity single, in support of UNICEF campaign for the children who suffer as a result of the Syrian conflict. The song debuted at number two on the Spain's Top 50 singles chart. ==Track listing== AM Special Edition includes a remix of \"Se\u00f1orita\" and an acoustic version of \"L\u00e1nzalo\" as Bonus Tracks.
