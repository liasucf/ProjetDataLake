The Albiones or Albioni were a Gallaecian people living the north coast of modern Spain in western Asturias and eastern Galicia mentioned by Pliny the Elder. They are generally included in maps of Roman Spain.Tabula Imperii Romani K-29, Porto: Conimbriga, Bracara, Lucus, Asturica, (Madrid, 1991) 20-21; Richard J.A. Talbert (ed.), Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, map 24, E1. The name Albiones is also attested on the \"stele of Nicer Clutosi\" found near Vegadeo, which has the inscription: :\u2627 NICER CLUTOSI (filius) C(astello) CARIACA PRINCIPIS ALBIONUM AN(norum) LXXV HI(c) S(itus) EST, which can be translated as \" Nicer, [son] of Clutoso from the house of Cariaca, prince of the Albions, [died aged] 75 years, lies here.\" L'Ann\u00e9e \u00e9pigraphique (1946), 121.
