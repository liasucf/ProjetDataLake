    "text": "Transit () is a 2006 film from Russian writer-director Aleksandr Rogozhkin, which was presented at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. Several of his past films have screened there, including Life with an Idiot and the Chechen war drama Check Point (Blokpost), for which he won the Best Director Prize in 1998. Transit is a story set on a secret military transit base in the remote Chukotka region, where planes from allied forces came in from Alaska, including quite a few with female pilots, which of course attracted the attention of the mostly male Russian crew at the base. ==Plot summary== A group of American pilots from Alaska ferry Airacobra fighter planes across the ocean on Lend-lease. The orderly course of life is disrupted when it becomes clear that the American pilots are attractive and charming young women. The feelings of the Russian young men collide with cultural and language barriers resulting in a host of awkward, funny, and sometimes tragic situations. ==Cast== *Aleksei Serebryakov as Captain Yurchenko *Daniil Strakhov as Captain Lisnevsky *Anastasiya Nemolyaeva as Irina Zareva *Svetlana Stroganova as Valentina *Yuri Itskov as Svist *Stepan Abramov as Fitil' *Gennady Alekseev as Wilson *Daniel Anderson as War Correspondent *Anna Marina Bensaud as Lieut.
