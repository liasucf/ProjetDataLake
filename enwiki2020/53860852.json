    "text": "22Kill is a suicide prevention non-profit organization that predominantly focuses on preventing United States military veterans from committing suicide. It is composed of multiple programs that were created through partnerships with other non-profit organizations such as Carry That Load. The organization uses the motto \"One Tribe, One Fight\", which reflects on the collective partnerships' goal to prevent veteran suicide and help veterans cope with issues that may lead to suicide. The organization's name was chosen to reflect on a 2012 statistic from the Veterans Affairs office, which stated that 22 veterans commit suicide on a daily basis. 22Kill raises awareness and empowers service member families through multiple programs and events such as the 22 Pushup Challenge and the Honor Rings program, which encourages people to wear a black band on their index finger in honor of veterans past and present. == History == Beginning as a social media campaign, 22Kill officially became a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization in July of 2015. In 2016, 22Kill's #22pushupchallenge went viral on social media and raised over half a million dollars. In 2017, the organization began offering mental wellness programs such as Stay The Course, Tribal Council, Forge, Wind Therapy, WATCH, and White Star Families. Today, the efforts of 22Kill are supported by the United Way of Tarrant County, the Perot Foundation, the Thomas M., Helen and John P. Ryan Foundation, Bell, and the Texas Veterans Commission Fund. == References == == External links == * Category:United States military support organizations ",
