Ricardo Caruso Lombardi was the manager who selected Antonini for his bow in senior football, with the midfielder starting a goalless draw at home to Godoy Cruz in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. He made a total of three appearances during 2016, as he did in the subsequent 2016\u201317 campaign; which ended with Sarmiento being relegated. He featured seven times in 2017\u201318 as the club reached the promotion play-off finals, though Antonini missed the season's end due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. ==Personal life== Antonini's brother, Juan, is a fellow professional footballer. They are nephews of former footballer Rub\u00e9n Piaggio. Their other uncle, along with their father, grandfather and cousins, played for regional clubs in the General Villegas area. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Sarmiento |2016 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||3||0 |- |2016\u201317 |3||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||4||0 |- |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |7||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||9||0 |- |2018\u201319 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !13!!0!!3!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!16!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Province Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Sarmiento footballers ",
