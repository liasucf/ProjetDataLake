    "text": "Oblique angle view of Kondratyuk from Apollo 15. NASA photo. Kondratyuk is a worn crater on the Moon's far side. It is located to the west-northwest of the large walled plain Fermi, and to the northeast of the crater Hilbert. To the north-northwest is Meitner, and to the northeast lies Langemak. This is an eroded crater formation with a rim that has been partly damaged by subsequent impacts. The small, sharp-rimmed satellite crater Kondratyuk A lies on the interior floor, along the northeast inner wall. In the southwest part of the floor is Kondratyuk Q. Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970,Kondratyuk, Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) Kondratyuk was called Crater 278.Lunar Farside Chart (LFC-1A), 2nd Edition October 1967 ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kondratyuk. In this case both satellite craters are within Kondratyuk itself. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Kondratyuk !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|A |align=\"center\"|14.2\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|115.5\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|25 km |- |align=\"center\"|Q |align=\"center\"|15.7\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|114.7\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|28 km |} ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
