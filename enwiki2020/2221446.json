The females are rather bigger and have more marked wings. These medium-sized butterflies have a bright brown-orange background with black dots and crossbands, and a line of submarginal triangular patches.DK \u2013 Pocket Nature Butterflies and Moths The forewings margin shows a rounded shape. The underside of the hindwings usually has small whitish-silvery spots, a black pupilled yellow spot and black lined submarginal lunules and veins in the basal area. Caterpillars have a dark basic colour with small, white spots and white thorns. This species is rather similar to the dark-green fritillary (Speyeria aglaja) and high brown fritillary (Fabriciana adippe),Bob Gibbons Pocket Guide to Butterflies but it is quite smaller, the silver centred brown spots are smaller and the postdiscal silver markings are not continuous. Seitz - A. niobe L. (69c). Above very similar to aglaja, at once recognized by the much more variegated under-side. The hindwing beneath is without the even verdigris shading in the basal half, the latter bearing distinct leathery- yellow patches, which are often centred, edged or shaded with brownish green. The nymotypical form has abundant silver-spots beneath, more than aglaja, as the distal band has no silver in aglaja, while it bears silvery centres in niobe.Seitz. A. in Seitz, A. ed.

It overwinters at the caterpillar stage in the egg shell. Adults fly from May to late August. The eggs are laid on the vegetation, near the host plants. The larvae hatch in March and mature in June. Caterpillars feed on Viola tricolor, Viola canina, Viola riviniana, Viola odorata, Viola hirta, Viola palustris and Plantago lanceolata. ==Gallery== File:Fabriciana niobe MHNT CUT 2013 3 24 Cahors dorsal.jpg|Dorsal view File:Fabriciana niobe MHNT CUT 2013 3 24 Cahors Ventral.jpg|Ventral view ==External links== * Paolo Mazzei, Daniel Morel, Raniero Panfili Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa * Lepidoptera and their ecology * Lepiforum.de ==References== Category:Fabriciana Category:Butterflies of Asia Category:Butterflies of Europe Category:Butterflies of China Category:Butterflies of India Category:Butterflies of Iran Category:Butterflies of Japan Category:Butterflies of Pakistan Category:Butterflies of Turkey Category:Butterflies described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
