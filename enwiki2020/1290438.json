    "text": "*Raid\u014d \"ride, journey\" is the reconstructed Proto-Germanic name of the r- rune of the Elder Futhark . The name is attested for the same rune in all three rune poems, Old Norwegian R\u00e6i\u00f0 Icelandic Rei\u00f0, Anglo-Saxon Rad, as well as for the corresponding letter of the Gothic alphabet \ud800\udf42 r, called raida. The shape of the rune may be directly derived from Latin R. {| class=\"wikitable\" | Rune Poem:Original poems and translation from the Rune Poem Page. | English Translation: |- | Old Norwegian R\u00e6i\u00f0 kve\u00f0a rossom v\u00e6sta; Reginn sl\u00f3 sv\u00e6r\u00f0et b\u00e6zta. | Riding is said to be the worst thing for horses; Reginn forged the finest sword. |- | Old Icelandic Rei\u00f0 er sitjandi s\u00e6la ok sn\u00fa\u00f0ig fer\u00f0 ok j\u00f3rs erfi\u00f0i. iter r\u00e6sir. | Riding is of sitting a blessing and swift journey and horses toiling |- | Anglo-Saxon Rad by\u00fe on recyde rinca geh\u01bfylcum sefte ond s\u01bfi\u00feh\u01bf\u00e6t, \u00f0am\u00f0e sitte\u00fe on ufan meare m\u00e6genheardum ofer milpa\u00feas. | Riding seems easy to every warrior while he is indoors and very courageous to him who traverses the high-roads on the back of a stout horse. |} == References == * ==External links== *Futhark (ancientscripts.com) *Runes around the North Sea and on the Continent AD 150-700 by J.
