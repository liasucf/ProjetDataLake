    "text": "The 2019\u201320 EIHL season was the 17th season of the Elite Ice Hockey League. The regular season commenced on 7 September 2019 and was due to end on 29 March 2020, with the playoffs following in April 2020. The reigning league champions were the Belfast Giants, who won the title on the final day of the regular season, in 2018\u201319. On 13 March 2020, two weekends before the regular season was due to end, league officials cancelled all remaining matches due to be held; this was as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. ==Teams== After having eleven teams for the 2018\u201319 season, the league reduced to ten for the 2019\u201320 season. This was due to the Milton Keynes Lightning \u2013 who had finished bottom of the league \u2013 returning to the National Ice Hockey League. For the first time since 2011\u201312, the league did not feature Conference splits. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! ! ! ! |- align=left | Belfast Giants || Belfast || SSE Arena Belfast ||align=center| 7,200 |- align=left | Cardiff Devils || Cardiff || Ice Arena Wales ||align=center| 3,088 |- align=left | Coventry Blaze || Coventry || Coventry Skydome ||align=center| 3,000 |- align=left | Dundee Stars || Dundee || Dundee Ice Arena ||align=center| 2,400 |- align=left | Fife Flyers || Kirkcaldy || Fife Ice Arena ||align=center| 3,525 |- align=left | Glasgow Clan || Glasgow || Braehead Arena ||align=center| 4,000 |- align=left | Guildford Flames || Guildford || Guildford Spectrum ||align=center| 2,001 |- align=left | Manchester Storm || Altrincham || Altrincham Ice Dome ||align=center| 2,351 |- align=left | Nottingham Panthers || Nottingham || National Ice Centre ||align=center| 7,500 |- align=left | Sheffield Steelers || Sheffield || FlyDSA Arena ||align=center| 8,500 |} ==League standings at time of cancellation== Each team was scheduled to play 54 games, playing each of the other nine teams six times: three times on home ice, and three times away from home. Points were awarded for each game, where two points are awarded for all victories, regardless of whether it was in regulation time or after overtime or game-winning shots. One point was awarded for losing in overtime or game- winning shots, and zero points for losing in regulation time. At the end of the regular season, the team that finished with the most points would normally be crowned the league champion. However, after the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the season, it was agreed the season would finish without a league winner; league leaders Cardiff Devils qualified for the 2020\u201321 Champions Hockey League. ==Statistics== ===Scoring leaders=== The following players led the league in points, at the conclusion of matches played on 8 March 2020.
