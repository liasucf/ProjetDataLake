The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other state roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state roads as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 7,350 vehicles and 450 commercial vehicles used the highway daily on the Lincoln Memorial Bridge. The peak traffic volumes were 10,270 vehicles and 1,070 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of SR 441 near its southern terminus. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== 441 Category:Transportation in Knox County, Indiana ",
