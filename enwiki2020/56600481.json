He was an advocate of the imperial antipopes of Victor IV, Paschalis III and Kalikst III, he represented the Polish Episcopate at the canonization celebrations of Charlemagne in 1165, led by Paschalis III. He died a martyr's death, murdered on the orders of the magnate, who lost a court dispute with him about the village of Karso (Szarsko?). He was worshiped by the faithful after death and placed in the lists of saints and blessed at the time, but due to his support for the anti-Pope his cult did not gain the recognition of the Church after the schism. In the older literature, his martyrdom is sometimes erroneously dated to 1172. Some contemporary historians identify him with Warner, Bishop of W\u0142oc\u0142awek, mentioned in the papal bull of Eugene III from 1148. This identification, however possible, is not supported by any positive source message. ==References== Category:Bishops of Pozna\u0144 Category:Year of birth unknown Category:12th-century births Category:1170 deaths Category:12th- century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Medieval Polish nobility Category:12th-century Polish people ",
