A veranda is often partly enclosed by a railing and frequently extends across the front and sides of the structure. Although the form verandah is correct and very common, some authorities prefer the version without an \"h\" (the Concise Oxford English Dictionary gives the \"h\" version as a variant and The Guardian Style Guide says \"veranda not verandah\"). The Guardian Style Guide == Architecture styles notable for verandas == ===Australia=== Winifred Rawson tending her son on the veranda of The Hollow, near Mackay, Queensland, ~1873 A heritage listed building in Hungary The veranda has featured quite prominently in Australian vernacular architecture and first became widespread in colonial buildings during the 1850s.

In fact, most houses constructed in the Southern United States before the advent of air conditioning were built with a covered front porch or veranda. Spanish Colonial architecture (as well as the \"Mission style\" revivalist version that became popular in the Western United States in the early 1900s) commonly incorporates verandas, both on the exterior of buildings and, in cases of buildings with courtyards, along the interior walls of courtyards. In some cases, homes were constructed with every room opening into a courtyard veranda, rather than interior corridors or direct connections to other rooms. ===India=== Being a warm, tropical country porches for houses was natural in India.
