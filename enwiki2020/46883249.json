It features uncredited vocals by Norwegian singer and songwriter Ina Wroldsen. The single received generally positive reviews, and was commercially successful, reaching the top-ten in 22 countries, including number two on the UK Singles Chart and number one in Australia, Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands and Russia. ==Background and composition== On 3 June 2015, Harris announced an upcoming collaboration with London-based production trio Disciples. The song leaked on 15 July 2015, two days prior to its official release. The song first materialised when London-based band Disciples and Norwegian singer-songwriter Ina Wroldsen co-wrote it in early 2014. They recorded the vocals of Wroldsen in one take for the demo. Two of the artists from Disciples who are published by Fly-Eye (Harris's publishing company) decided to send him the rough demonstration for feedback and pointers. Harris loved the track and eventually proposed collaborating on it together. Harris told radio KISS-FM that following the release of Motion, he wanted to do something else, something a bit different. He wanted a single out for the summer because it had been so long since it had happened. \"I missed the feeling of having a new song out in the summer.\" \"How Deep Is Your Love\" is a deep house song. Your EDM described it as an \"upbeat tune\", containing \"bass-y plucks and piano chords\". For Hayden Manders of Nylon, the track is influenced by 90s Euro house and compared it to Disclosure's music. ==Critical reception== Billboard called the song \"another dance club anthem from the reliable hitmaker.\" Hayden Manders of Nylon felt Harris returned to form thanks to \"How Deep Is Your Love\". Writing for Jezebel Jia Tolentino described it as a \"a straightforward, minimalist full-on heater with a contagious playfulness in its three main hooks\" and credited Disciples for \"the subtlety in this track\". Daniel Cha from Your EDM opined that the song is \"an ideal soundtrack to an oceanside drive\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote \"Calvin Harris is ready to soundtrack the rest of your summer with his new deep house banger.\" Time Nolan Feeney wrote: \"'How Deep Is Your Love' doesn\u2019t evoke the pummeling build-ups and synthesizer onslaughts of Rihanna's 'We Found Love' or Cheryl Cole's 'Call My Name'. Instead, [Harris] opts for some slow-burning house. If his next album sounds this fresh, the love will go pretty deep, actually.\" ==Commercial performance== \"How Deep Is Your Love\" entered at number seven on the UK Singles Chart, giving Harris his 19th top ten hit on the chart. The song eventually peaked at number two. The song debuted at number five on the US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs. It sold 41,000 downloads and captured two million U.S. streams (the bulk of which, 74 percent, came from Spotify) in its first week. It marked Harris' eighth top ten since the chart's launch, making it the most of any act (previously, he was tied with Zedd at seven each). Additionally, the song debuted at number four on Dance/Electronic Digital Songs and at number six on the Dance/Electronic Streaming Songs. On its tenth week, it has hit number three on both the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs and the Dance/Electronic Streaming Songs and reahced number two on the Dance/Electronic Digital Songs and the Dance Club Songs. The song also debuted on Dance/Mix Show Airplay at number 24. It eventually reached number one on the chart after 10 weeks, giving Harris his ninth number one on this chart. Since the chart began in 2003, only Rihanna has racked up more number ones (11 hits). The single also debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 60. and has since peaked at number 27.
