    "text": "Roberto Mancini (; born 27 November 1964) is an Italian football manager and former player who is the manager of the Italy national team. As a player, Mancini operated as a deep-lying forward, and was best known for his time at Sampdoria, where he played more than 550 matches, and helped the team win the Serie A league title, four Coppa Italia titles, and the European Cup Winners' Cup. He was capped 36 times for Italy, taking part at UEFA Euro 1988 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup, achieving semi-final finishes in both tournaments. In 1997, after 15 years at Sampdoria, Mancini left the club to join Lazio, where he won a further Scudetto, as well as the Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and two more Coppa Italia titles. As a player, Mancini would often give team talks at half-time. Towards the end of his playing career he became an assistant to Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson at Lazio. His first manager role was at a cash-stricken Fiorentina at only 35 years old. He won a Coppa Italia there, but left with the team facing bankruptcy. Months later he took over as manager at Lazio, where again he inherited financial constraints and was forced to lose a number of key players. With limited resources during his two-season tenure, he guided the club to another Coppa Italia. In 2004, Mancini was given the chance to manage a major club with more resources when he was offered the manager's job at Inter. During his first tenure at Inter, the club won three consecutive Serie A titles, an Inter club record, and an Italian record 17 consecutive league game victories stretching nearly half a season; Mancini became Inter's most successful manager in 30 years. Despite his domestic success, many pundits saw the repeated failure to win the coveted Champions League as the main reason for his dismissal in 2008. After being out of football for over a year, Mancini was appointed Manchester City manager in December 2009. Under his stewardship, he instilled a winning culture at the club, taking Manchester City from a mid-table club to the top level of English football, combining defensive solidity with attacking flair. In the 2010\u201311 season, his first full season at Manchester City, Mancini guided the club to Champions League football and the FA Cup, the club's first major trophy in 35 years. In the 2011\u201312 season, Mancini guided Manchester City to the club's first league title in 44 years in an enthralling last day of the season, winning 3\u20132, with two goals in injury time in what was called \"the best match of the best last day of the season in English football history.\" Under Mancini, City progressed to the 2013 FA Cup Final, but were defeated by the soon-to-be relegated Wigan Athletic 1\u20130. Mancini was sacked two days later, before took over at Turkish club Galatasaray in September 2013, winning the Turkish Cup in his only season at the club. Regarded as a cup specialist, Mancini has reached at least a semi-final of a major national cup competition in every season he has been a manager, from 2002 to 2014. He holds a number of records, including most consecutive Coppa Italia finals from 2004 to 2008, with Lazio once in 2004 and with Inter in the following four seasons. ==Early life== Mancini was born in the small town of Iesi, Marche on 27 November 1964, but then moved onto the mountain town of Roccadaspide and was raised by Aldo and Marianna Mancini along with his younger sister Stephanie. He had served as an altar boy in his youth. ==Club career== ===Sampdoria=== Mancini debuted in Serie A for Bologna in 1981. The following year, he was bought by Sampdoria, for \u00a32.2 million, whom he played for until 1997. With Sampdoria, he formed a dynamic strike partnership with Gianluca Vialli, which earned the pair the nickname The Goal Twins (\"I Gemelli del Gol\", in Italian). Together, they helped the club to its only league title in 1991, four Coppa Italias and a Cup Winners' Cup in 1990. He also appeared in the final of the 1991\u201392 European Cup against Barcelona. At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In David Platt's 1995 autobiography, Achieving the Goal, he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for Bari and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: \"I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani.\" Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to Juventus and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the Blucerchiati dressing room. As a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After Trevor Francis signed from Manchester City in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with Liam Brady, who was eight years older. Additionally, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. \"He is not an easy person, you know,\" Ver\u00f3n says. \"He has this complicated personality.\" ===Lazio=== With Lazio, Mancini won his second Scudetto and Cup Winners' Cup titles, as well as two more Coppa Italias. In the 1999\u201300 season, Lazio won the Scudetto and Coppa Italia, but Mancini failed to score in 20 matches and later announced his playing retirement. He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said, \"I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player. He was the coach, he was the kit man, he was the bus driver, everything. At Sampdoria he wanted to check that everything was in place before training. Sometimes I would have to tell him: 'Mancio, you have a game to play on Sunday, you will be exhausted if you have to control everything.' But he was like that.\"Sven Goran Eriksson: 'I liked city. they'll win the league \u2013 absolutely' \u2013 News & Comment \u2013 Football. The Independent (8 January 2011). Retrieved on 5 May 2012. ===Leicester City=== Joining Leicester City on loan in January 2001, Mancini made his Premier League debut against Arsenal at the age of 36, but failed to complete a full 90 minutes in his five appearances for the club. In early February, he was given leave of absence, citing personal reasons. He telephoned the club on 14 February, however, and informed them he would not be returning to England; he had been offered the manager's job at Fiorentina. Despite this, he cites his time at Leicester City as the period during which he fell in love with the English game, and which later prompted him to accept the job at Manchester City. ==International career== Despite success at club level, Mancini never became a regular for Italy. At the under-21 level, Mancini was part of the team which reached the semi-finals in the 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship and finished runners-up in 1986. He made his international senior squad debut at the age of 19, under Enzo Bearzot, on 26 May 1984, in a 2\u20130 away win against Canada in Toronto; he later won 36 caps, and scored four goals for his country. Mancini was a starting player at Euro 1988, where Italy reached the semi-finals; during the tournament, he scored a goal in a 1\u20131 draw against hosts West Germany, in the opening match of the tournament on 10 June. Mancini was also a non-playing member of Azeglio Vicini's Italian squad that finished in third place at the 1990 World Cup on home soil. He was kept out of the side by competition from Gianluca Vialli, Salvatore Schillaci, Andrea Carnevale and Roberto Baggio. Mancini's international career ended after a dispute with national team coach Arrigo Sacchi, when Mancini was upset because he would not be guaranteed a first team place at the 1994 World Cup. Fierce competition with other creative forwards for places in the starting line-up, such as Gianfranco Zola, Giuseppe Signori, Roberto Baggio and later Francesco Totti and Alessandro Del Piero, hindered his international opportunities, hastening his self-imposed exile from the Italian national team. ==Style of play== Mancini was a creative and technically gifted forward, who was frequently deployed as a supporting striker alongside a centre forward, or, on occasion, as an offensive playmaker in the attacking midfield position later on in his career. A classic number 10 with creativity and vision, as well as accurate passing and finishing ability, he was capable of assisting many goals as well as scoring them himself, due to his eye for the final pass; he was also known for his excellent technique in the air, which enabled him to execute spectacular volleys. An elegant and skilful player, Mancini was also renowned for his flair, ball control and dribbling ability, as well as his tactical intelligence. He frequently stood out because of this attribute, as well as due to his leadership. He was often a vocal presence on the football pitch, regularly organising and motivating his teammates, as well as discussing with opponents and arguing with referees. He was also highly regarded for his defensive work-rate off the ball. Mancini is regarded as one of the best Italian players of his generation, and as one of Italy's greatest ever number 10s. ==Managerial career== ===Early years=== Although Mancini had written a research pamphlet entitled \"Il Trequartista\", which examined the role of an attacking midfielder, he had not as yet attained the necessary coaching badges to become a manager. He therefore needed special dispensation from the Italian football authorities to take the post at Fiorentina, which was given on 4 March 2001. He was out on loan to Leicester City and returned after four matches to take the Fiorentina job on 26 February 2001. Fiorentina was plagued by financial problems and Mancini made occasional playing appearances himself. According to various sources, Mancini sometimes worked unpaid and even received death threats after key players such as Rui Costa and Francesco Toldo had to be sold. Despite this, Mancini managed to win the Coppa Italia before quitting on 11 January 2002, after just ten months in the job, with Fiorentina in the relegation zone of Serie A. Fiorentina were ultimately relegated in June 2002. On 9 May 2002, Mancini was appointed manager of Lazio. He was again restricted by financial considerations, having to sell key players such as Hern\u00e1n Crespo and Alessandro Nesta, and players were forced to take an 80 percent pay cut. In his first season with Lazio, however, the club reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. In 2003\u201304, Lazio won the Coppa Italia. Lazio finished fourth in 2003 and sixth in 2004. Before the start of the 2004\u201305 season, rumours circulated in the Italian press that Inter Milan had approached Mancini to fill the recently vacated managerial position at the club. Then, in July 2004, Lazio released Mancini from his contract and he joined Inter. ===Inter Milan=== Mancini pictured in 2004 as Inter manager. Mancini took over on 7 July 2004. Under Mancini, Inter soon won the club's first domestic trophy since 1989. Inter became the dominant team in Italy. In Mancini's first season, Inter won the Coppa Italia with a 3\u20130 victory over Roma at the San Siro. Inter finished third in 2003\u201304 Serie A and reached the Champions League quarter-finals only to be knocked out by city rivals A.C. Milan 3\u20130 on aggregate. In August 2005, Inter won the 2005 Supercoppa Italiana for the second time in their history with a 1\u20130 victory over Juventus. Inter again won the Coppa Italia and Italian Super Cup. Following the Calciopoli scandal, Juventus were stripped of the Scudetto title, which was handed to Inter instead. Inter achieved a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in Serie A, starting on 25 September 2006, with a 4\u20131 home win over Livorno and ending on 28 February 2007 after a 1\u20131 draw at home to Udinese. The run lasted for almost five months and is among the best in European league football history. Inter won a second successive league title with five games to spare and only losing one league game all season. Inter finished with a record-breaking 97 points. Mancini became the third coach in Inter history to win back-to-back league titles after Alfredo Foni; 1952\u201353 and 1953\u201354 and Helenio Herrera; 1964\u201365 and 1965\u201366). Inter also progressed to the Coppa Italia and Italian Super Cup for the third consecutive season, but were beaten in both finals by Roma. Once again, however, Inter struggled in Europe. In the Champions League, they were knocked out in the first knockout round by Valencia. At the end of the game, there was a mass brawl involving both sets of players. Mancini was not involved in the incident, but camera footage showed him attempting to block a camera's view before he was seen shrugging his shoulders and walking away. This was Mancini's fourth, and final, season in charge of Inter. His reputation continued to grow as he added a third consecutive Serie A title to his honours. Again he guided Inter to the Coppa Italia final, but lost for a second consecutive season to Roma, 2\u20131, at the Stadio Olimpico. Despite his successes, the inability to make any real progress in the Champions League displeased Inter owner Massimo Moratti. Inter were knocked out in the first knockout round of the Champions League by Liverpool. The first leg took place at Anfield, with defender Marco Materazzi being sent off in the 30th minute. Inter almost held out for a draw, but two late goals in the 85th and 90th minute by Liverpool damaged Inter's hopes of progressing. The return leg was at the San Siro, but again Mancini was not helped by the ill discipline of his players, with Nicol\u00e1s Burdisso being sent off in the 50th minute before Fernando Torres scored for Liverpool in the 64th minute to seal the tie 3\u20130 on aggregate. After being eliminated by Liverpool, Mancini wanted to leave after the season, but changed his mind the following day. In March 2008, amid rumours that he was to be sacked and replaced by Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at the end of the season, Mancini announced his intention to step down at the end of the 2007\u201308 season. He rescinded this decision a day later after meeting with Moratti. On 29 May 2008, however, Inter officially announced the sacking of Mancini. Moratti justified the sacking by pointing to Mancini's comments after the Liverpool defeat. He was replaced by Mourinho. ===Out of football=== Mancini was linked to the vacant Chelsea manager's position in May 2008 and then the same role at Notts County. On 30 October 2009, Mancini won compensation for his sacking by Inter. The contract settlement, however, meant Mancini was actually unemployable by any other club from May 2008 to October 2009. It was rumoured that Mancini was entitled to a \u20ac16 million pay-off, but in the end, he reportedly settled for \u20ac5 million. ===Manchester City=== ====2009\u201310==== On 19 December 2009, Mancini was publicly revealed to be taking over as manager of Manchester City on a three-and-a-half-year deal following the sacking of Mark Hughes. With wealthy Emirati owners who were willing to invest heavily in the team, Manchester City had become a club expectant of success. Having been appointed halfway through the season, Mancini's arrival had an immediate impact on City's form, with four consecutive wins. Mancini won his first Manchester Derby over Manchester United 2\u20131 in a League Cup semi-final first leg. United won the second-leg 3\u20131, however, and eliminated City from the competition. In April, City moved into fourth place in the Premier League. On 5 May, however, a single goal defeat at home to Tottenham Hotspur meant that City missed out on a Champions League spot. City finished the season in fifth place, their highest Premier League finish. There had been speculation that Mancini might lose his job if City failed to secure Champions League football, but chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak gave his support to Mancini. ====2010\u201311==== Mancini as Manchester City manager in 2010. Mancini spent heavily during summer transfer window. He signed German international defender J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng from Hamburger SV for approximately \u00a310.64 million, Spanish World Cup winner David Silva from Valencia for approximately \u00a324 million, Yaya Tour\u00e9 from Barcelona for around \u00a324 million and Aleksandar Kolarov from Lazio for approximately \u00a316 million. The 2010\u201311 Premier League season was marked by runs of mixed form. With a 2\u20130 win away at Wigan Athletic on 19 September 2010, City moved into fourth position in the league and did not drop out of the top four positions during the rest of the season. In October and November, the team struggled for form, which put some pressure on Mancini, with his tactics widely criticised following two consecutive 0\u20130 home draws with Manchester United and Birmingham City. A fine run of form in the weeks running up to Christmas, however, meant City occupied first place in the Premier League twice over the Christmas period. In the ten games before 15 January 2011, City won seven times, drew twice and lost only once as they moved into title contention, while also securing passage into the Round of 32 of the Europa League by finishing as the top team in Group A. As a result of his team's strong league form, Mancini was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month award for December. City's Premier League form tailed off again in the new year, with City jointly contesting the FA Cup and Europa League, and Mancini cited burnout for losing ground in the league title race. City were eventually eliminated from the Europa League by Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv in March, but his team replied strongly by winning eight out of the next ten matches, including an FA Cup semi-final victory at Wembley over local rivals Manchester United in April. A win over Tottenham in May guaranteed City the opportunity to play Champions League football the following season. This win was followed by City winning the FA Cup with a 1\u20130 victory over Stoke City in the following weekend's final at Wembley. This FA Cup triumph meant that Mancini joined five other City managers who had won major honours, and it ended the club's longest trophy drought in its history.Match report on Manchester City v Stoke City in the FA Cup final 14 May 2011 \u2013 Manchester City FC. Mcfc.co.uk (14 May 2011). Retrieved on 5 May 2012. Due to their late run of form, City finished third in the league ahead of Arsenal after a 2\u20130 win over Bolton Wanderers on the last day of the season, thereby avoiding the need to participate in play-off round fixtures in order to progress to the group stages of the following season's Champions League competition. Only goal difference separated City from achieving a second-place finish over Chelsea. ====2011\u201312==== The club were quieter in the closed season transfer window than in previous years, with the club's spending of approximately \u00a375 million more in line with the corresponding amounts spent by rivals Manchester United and Liverpool. \u00a360 million of this sum was used to purchase two players: Sergio Ag\u00fcero, for a club record fee, and Samir Nasri from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Arsenal respectively. Other players purchased during the summer included Ga\u00ebl Clichy and Stefan Savi\u0107, while Owen Hargreaves joined on a free transfer after having been released by Manchester United. City began the Premier League season very strongly, winning 12 of their first 14 matches and scoring an impressive 48 goals while only conceding 13. These results left City undefeated and five points clear at the top of the league over second-placed Manchester United by the beginning of December. A revitalised Edin D\u017eeko won the Premier League Player of the Month award for August 2011, and David Silva won the same award for September 2011. Many were impressed with the impact of Ag\u00fcero and Nasri, which had given City an exciting, attacking verve. Mancini was also responsible for inflicting United's worst loss since 1955 when his City side won 6\u20131 away at Old Trafford. He was named Premier League Manager of the Month as a result of City's strong form in the month of October. City maintained the lead in the Premier League over the next five months but struggled in the Champions League in a group that involved Bayern Munich, Napoli and Villarreal. City failed to progress, but finished third in the group with ten points, normally enough to guarantee qualification into the knock-out stages. Mancini (left), Samir Nasri and Sergio Ag\u00fcero with the Premier League trophy during Manchester City's victory parade, May 2012. A 3\u20132 loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup third round on 8 January 2012 was bittersweet. City had Vincent Kompany controversially sent-off in the sixth minute and United managed to create a 3\u20130 lead before half-time against a lacklustre and beleaguered City team. However, after numerous tactical changes from Mancini at half-time, City came out fighting with ten men, a renewed version of the team that had played in the first half. Two goals from Aleksandar Kolarov and Sergio Ag\u00fcero narrowed the deficit to just one goal. City were in the ascendency and continued to push for an equalising goal despite having only ten men, but failed to do so with the final whistle. Mancini later believed the match was a seminal moment in the development of his team, demonstrating that City were a better team than United. He believed that the match helped to carve out a fighting spirit that his team had previously lacked. City also progressed to the League Cup semi-final, maintaining Mancini's record of reaching a major competition semi-final in every season he has managed. City played Liverpool and conceded an away goal in the first leg with a penalty from Steven Gerrard. City went to Anfield and led twice with goals from Nigel de Jong and Edin D\u017eeko, but another penalty from Steven Gerrard and a goal from Craig Bellamy meant Liverpool won 3\u20132 on aggregate. On 13 May 2012, City clinched the Premier League title in a dramatic 3\u20132 win over Queens Park Rangers after originally being 2\u20131 down going into injury time. He became the second Italian manager to win a Premier League title after Carlo Ancelotti's Chelsea team in 2009\u201310. ====2012\u201313==== Mancini stated pre-season that Manchester City's long-term aim was to win the Champions League. Mancini declared that he envisaged less transfer activity in the summer, and was content with his attacking strikers. On 9 July 2012, City announced that Roberto Mancini had signed a new five-year deal, meaning that he was contracted with the club until summer 2017. City began the new season by participating in, and winning, the 2012 FA Community Shield against 2012 FA Cup winners Chelsea on 12 August 2012 at Villa Park. Manchester City won 3\u20132 on this occasion. On 21 November 2012, a 1\u20131 draw at home to Real Madrid saw Manchester City and Mancini exit the Champions League at the group stage for the second successive season. At the end of the calendar year of 2012, Manchester City were second in the Premier League, seven points behind local rivals Manchester United. In contrast to the 2011\u201312 league season, Mancini's team struggled to score sufficient goals and suffered some poor results in the second half of the season, such as a 3\u20131 loss to Southampton on 9 February 2013 (which Mancini described as the worst performance during his time in charge at City) and a 2\u20130 loss to Everton on 16 March. City's poor form led to United capturing the Premier League title on 22 April with a 3\u20130 win over Aston Villa with four games to spare. On 11 May, Manchester City lost to Wigan Athletic 1\u20130 in the 2013 FA Cup Final, with a late goal from Wigan's Ben Watson. On 14 May, Mancini was sacked as manager of Manchester City two days after City's loss to Wigan in the FA Cup Final. Speculation over Mancini's future had mounted for months beforehand; a question regarding then-M\u00e1laga manager Manuel Pellegrini possibly taking Mancini's job in February 2013 provoked an expletive response from Mancini during a press conference. Mancini's public criticism of backroom and playing staff, as well as his distant relationships, alienated the players and the club hierarchy during the last eight months of his tenure. On sacking Mancini, the club cited the need for a more \"holistic\" approach for the long-term future of the club, namely a manager passionate for developing players at youth level to create a \"one house football club,\" as City looked to open their new \u00a3100 million youth academy at the Etihad Campus in 2014. With Manchester City, Mancini achieved the fourth-best win percentage in Premier League history, behind only Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Alex Ferguson and Carlo Ancelotti. A week after his sacking, Mancini took out a full page advert in the Manchester Evening News to say farewell and thank the club's fans \u2013 an act that was reciprocated in the Gazzetta dello Sport by Manchester City supporters. ===Galatasaray=== Mancini managing Galatasaray in 2013 On 30 September 2013, Mancini signed a three-year contract with Turkish side Galatasaray, taking over from the previous coach Fatih Terim, who had left to take over as coach of the Turkish national team. In his first game in charge, on 2 October against Juventus in the 2013\u201314 Champions League, Galatasaray drew 2\u20132 with a late equaliser. After a convincing 3\u20131 victory at home against Copenhagen in the same competition, his Galatasaray side this time defeated reigning Italian champions Juventus 1\u20130 on the crucial matchday six to advance to the last 16 of the tournament, a feat he was unable to achieve with Manchester City over two seasons. Galatasaray there met Chelsea and were eliminated despite drawing the home leg 1\u20131. Under Mancini, Galatasaray won their first 12 2013\u201314 S\u00fcper Lig home matches, including a 6\u20130 victory over Bursaspor, the highest winning margin in the league as of game week 20. On 7 May, Galatasaray won 1\u20130 against Eski\u015fehirspor in the 2014 Turkish Cup Final with a late goal from Wesley Sneijder. On 11 June, Mancini left the club by mutual consent. It has been reported by the club's chairman and the spokesperson that the club's transfer policy and the overall budget of the upcoming season was the reason behind the dispute. This was also verified by Mancini: \"When I accepted the coaching post, Gala's aims were different.\" ===Return to Inter=== On 14 November 2014, Mancini agreed to a surprise return at his previous club Inter, replacing Walter Mazzarri at the helm of the Nerazzurri. His first game in charge was against rivals A.C. Milan in the Derby della Madonnina, which finished in a 1\u20131 draw, with the club's goal scored by Joel Obi. On 27 November 2014, Mancini's 50th birthday, Inter played the first European match of his second spell, a 2-1 home win over Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk to confirm that Inter would top the group with a game remaining. On 8 August 2016 Mancini left Inter on a mutual agreement. ===Zenit Saint Petersburg=== On 1 June 2017, Mancini was appointed as a manager of FC Zenit Saint Petersburg. On 13 May 2018, Mancini terminated his contract by mutual consent. ===Italy national team=== On 14 May 2018, it was announced that Mancini signed as manager of the Italy national team after taking over from caretaker manager, Luigi Di Biagio.Roberto Mancini: Italy appoint former Manchester City manager Mancini was appointed manager six months after Italy failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup under Gian Piero Ventura, after a play-off defeat to Sweden in November 2017\u2014the first time Italy had failed to qualify for the tournament since the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Mancini signed an incentive-based contract, which would run until 2020, however, would be given an automatic extension if Italy were to qualify for Euro 2020. On 28 May 2018, Italy won their first match under Mancini, a 2\u20131 victory in a friendly over Saudi Arabia. On 12 October 2019, Italy qualified for Euro 2020 with three matches to spare after a 2\u20130 home win over Greece. After qualification for Euro 2020, the clause in his contract was triggered, extending his contract to 2022. On 15 October, with a 5\u20130 away win over Liechtenstein, Italy won its ninth consecutive match under Mancini, equalling the record set by Vittorio Pozzo between 1938 and 1939. On 15 November, with a 3\u20130 away win against Bosnia and Herzegovina, he broke Pozzo's record, leading Italy to their tenth consecutive victory, and their record sixth consecutive away victory. The record was extended to 11 consecutive wins three days later with a 9\u20131 home win over Armenia; the result also saw Italy win all of their Euro 2020 qualifying matches in Group J, and set an unprecedented record of 10 victories in a single calendar year in 2019. ==Management style== Despite having been a support striker during his playing career, Mancini places great emphasis on building from the back, stressing the importance of not conceding a goal means the team will always have an opportunity to win, going as far to say, \"I like 1\u20130 wins. When you don't concede a goal and you have players like Edin D\u017eeko, Carlos Tevez or David Silva, you win 90%. I prefer we are boring for two to three matches and we win 1\u20130. If you watch teams that won titles, they conceded very few goals.\" Despite this, some argue Mancini is more of a \"defence first\" manager rather than a \"win first\" manager, a style that has been criticised by some in the British media. Others accepted that his pragmatic and cautious approach was what the team lacked, and that Mancini's style would ensure City could challenge for trophies regularly. Mancini in 2010 At Manchester City, Mancini had inherited a team from Mark Hughes, which while showing great prolificacy and potential in front of goal, had an insecure defence. Intensively coaching his defence enabled him to get his tenure at City off to a positive start. In Inter's 2007\u201308 Serie A-winning season, Inter conceded the fewest goals in the league with 26, 11 fewer than Juventus and Roma, and at City, his team gradually garnered a reputation as being well organised defensively and tough to break down. In Mancini's first full season in charge at City, they conceded 33 goals in the Premier League, the fewest along with Chelsea and 18 clean sheets, the highest in the 2010\u201311 Premier League season. Mancini's training methods have been criticised by some City players and especially by ex-Manchester City fitness coach Raymond Verheijen, who is a personal fitness coach for Craig Bellamy. During his time at City, Mancini tried to stamp his authority with rebellious players who were not performing well and has stated, \"If a top player is not happy then it's better to go.\" Mancini is known to use the media to alleviate the pressure from his players. Following City's defeat to Arsenal in the 2011\u201312 season, a deficit of eight points had been established between rivals Manchester United with only six matches left to play. After the Arsenal match, he believed the deficit was catchable. City, however, won the next match convincingly against West Bromwich Albion 4\u20130, but from then on Mancini maintained in post-match interviews that the title race was over. City won the next three matches, meaning a win against Manchester United would put them top of the league on goal difference. City beat United 1\u20130, with Mancini conceding the title race was back on \u2013 but that United were favourites with two matches to play. Mancini's unorthodox approach worked, and City won the league on goal difference with 89 points after six consecutive league wins in the final six matches. Mancini's players believed his approach alleviated pressure and helped City to win the last six league matches, which won the title on goal difference. Mancini stated afterwards that he always believed personally that City could win the title, but wanted his players to prove they could despite his public statements suggesting otherwise. == Controversy == There was much controversy surrounding Italy's UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match on 28 March 2015 against Bulgaria, as Italy head coach Antonio Conte called up Brazilian- born \u00c9der and Argentine-born Franco V\u00e1zquez. Both players hold an Italian citizenship as they have relatives that are Italian, allowing them to be eligible to play for Italy. Speaking at a Serie A meeting on 23 March 2015, Mancini said, \"The Italian national team should be Italian. An Italian player deserves to play for the national team while someone who wasn't born in Italy, even if they have relatives, I don't think they deserve to.\" Conte's response to the use of foreign-born players was, \"If Mauro Camoranesi [who was born in Argentina] was allowed to help Italy win the 2006 World Cup, then why can't \u00c9der and Franco V\u00e1zquez lead the Azzurri to glory in next year's European Championship?\" Following a heated exchange between Mancini and Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri in the final minutes of a Coppa Italia match on 20 January 2016, Mancini accused Sarri of being a homophobe. Sarri responded to the accusations by affirming that he wasn't a homophobe, and that \"what happens on the field, stays on the field\". Sarri was consequently fined \u20ac20,000 and banned for two Coppa Italia matches by Lega Serie A for \"directing extremely insulting epithets at the coach of the opposing team\". ==Personal life== Mancini is married to Federica, although reports in 2015 had stated they had been in the processes of separating. The couple have a daughter and two sons, Filippo and Andrea, who have both played in the Inter youth ranks, where Filippo has played ten minutes in a Coppa Italia match. Both of his sons have at one point been a part of Manchester City's under-21 youth team. Filippo trained with the club's youth/reserve team for several months during the 2007\u201308 season before Roberto was appointed as City's manager, while Andrea was signed by his father for the Elite Development Squad in November 2010 after being released from Bologna. Andrea was released at the end of the 2011\u201312 season. Mancini was estimated to have a personal wealth of \u00a319 million in 2011. Mancini has joked about watching the soap opera Coronation Street to help improve his English. Mancini has maintained a tradition of wearing a scarf of his club's colours. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|CupIncludes Supercoppa Italiana !colspan=\"2\"|EuropeIncludes UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup, Winners' Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |Bologna |1981\u201382 |30||9||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||9 |- |rowspan=\"16\"|Sampdoria |1982\u201383 |22||4||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||5 |- |1983\u201384 |30||8||8||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||38||10 |- |1984\u201385 |24||3||11||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||35||6 |- |1985\u201386 |23||6||11||4||4||2||38||12 |- |1986\u201387 |26||6||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||6 |- |1987\u201388 |30||5||13||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||43||8 |- |1988\u201389 |29||9||11||5||8||0||48||14 |- |1989\u201390 |31||11||4||2||9||2||44||15 |- |1990\u201391 |30||12||10||2||7||2||47||16 |- |1991\u201392 |29||6||7||3||9||4||45||13 |- |1992\u201393 |30||15||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||32||15 |- |1993\u201394 |30||12||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||12 |- |1994\u201395 |31||9||3||1||4||2||38||12 |- |1995\u201396 |26||11||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||28||12 |- |1996\u201397 |33||15||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||35||15 |- !Total !424!!132!!101!!27!!19!!12!!566!!168 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Lazio |1997\u201398 |34||5||8||1||10||3||52||9 |- |1998\u201399 |33||10||7||2||7||0||47||12 |- |1999\u20132000 |20||0||7||3||10||0||37||3 |- !Total !87!!15!!22!!6!!27!!3!!136!!24 |- |Leicester City |2000\u201301 |4||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career total !545!!156!!125!!33!!46!!15!!738!!201 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |colspan=\"3\"|Italy national team |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |1984||2||0 |- |1986||1||0 |- |1987||6||0 |- |1988||9||1 |- |1989||1||0 |- |1990||3||0 |- |1991||6||0 |- |1992||1||0 |- |1993||6||3 |- |1994||1||0 |- !Total||36||4 |} ===International goals=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
