It was created on 21 July 1776 for Robert Craggs-Nugent, 1st Viscount Clare, with remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to his son-in-law The 3rd Earl Temple and the heirs male of his body. Craggs-Nugent had already been made Baron Nugent, of Carlanstown in the County of Westmeath, and Viscount Clare, in the Peerage of Ireland on 19 January 1767. He died 13 October 1788, when the barony and viscountcy became extinct, and the earldom, under the terms of the special remainder, passed to his son-in-law, formerly known as Lord Temple, now The 1st Marquess of Buckingham. The earldom remained in his family until the death of The 5th Earl Nugent, also The 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, on 26 March 1889. See Viscount Cobham for further history of the title. The barony of Nugent was revived in 1800 in favour of his daughter, Mary, Marchioness of Buckingham.
