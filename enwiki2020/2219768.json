    "text": "Sally's Apizza is a pizzeria in the Wooster Square neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut. ==Fare== Sally's serves New Haven-style thin-crust apizza, which is baked in coal-fired brick pizza ovens. By default, a New Haven pizza is a \"plain\" pizza topped with only tomato sauce, and Parmesan. Sally's is a small restaurant, and often, patrons must wait in line, sometimes for hours. thumb ==History== The restaurant was purchased for $500 in 1938 by Filomena Consiglio, sister of Frank Pepe, who was the owner of Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, another Wooster Street pizza restaurant. Sal Consiglio, a son of Filomena, ran it until his death in May 1989. His wife Flo died in September 2012. While their children Richard and Robert still operate the restaurant, they sold it to an unnamed buyer in 2017. Since selling, the Consiglios are less involved in the making of the food. == Documentary == Sally's is one of three pizza restaurants featured in the documentary film Pizza A Love Story, directed by Gorman Bechard. The love story to New Haven's holy trinity of pizza restaurants, Pepe's, Sally's, and Modern, had its world premiere at IFFBoston in April 2019. The film was released on DVD and pay-per-view on September 29, 2020. In reviewing the film, Deborah Brown of The Swellesley Report called it \u201cAn important film of staggering genius that needed to be made.\u201d ==See also== * List of Italian restaurants ==References== * Reinhart, Peter (2003).
