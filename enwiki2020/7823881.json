His father Tobia and sister Inge were also Olympic alpine skiers.Carlo Senoner. sports-reference.com ==Biography== Carlo finished sixth in the slalom and fourth in the Alpine Combined at the FIS Alpine Skiing World Championships 1962. In the 1966 World Championshipes he finished 20th in the downhill race. In the slalom he was fourth in the first leg clocked in 53.72 seconds (2.39 seconds behind leading Bengt-Erik Grahn). In the second leg he was second clocked in 47.84 seconds but only 0.14 seconds behind Louis Jauffret, the eighth of the first run, and therefore it was enough to win \u2013 he was the first starter of the race and now he was the first after the race. At that time the procedure of a second leg was different to that of now-time. Not the 30th (or the 15th) clocked racer started the second leg but the racer with bib no 15 (or \u2013 if no 15 was out in the first run \u2013 that one who was next). Because Swedish racer Grahn had the no. 2 he was the last racer before Mr. Senoner. But Grahn didn't finish \u2013 when Carlo started, Guy P\u00e9rillat was leading; P\u00e9rillat was the second of the first leg (0.58 seconds ahead of Senoner \u2013 in the second leg P\u00e9rillat was clocked in 49.11 seconds, place 11), but Senoner could achieve 47.84 seconds, so he won with a margin of 0.69 seconds. ==References== ==External links== * Skier profile at Fis.com Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:People from S\u00eblva Category:Italian male alpine skiers Category:Alpine skiers at the 1960 Winter Olympics Category:Alpine skiers at the 1968 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic alpine skiers of Italy ",
