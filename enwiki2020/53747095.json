He received a BSc Degree in chemistry in 1970, an MSc Degree in organic chemistry in 1974, both from Bar-Ilan University and a PhD in organic chemistry in 1978, from the Weizmann Institute of Science. Between 1978 and 1981, he was a post doctoral fellow in the Department of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. == Professional career == HaCohen published over 120 scientific papers, registered 8 patents and edited 3 books. During his PhD studies he developed a method for dry ozonation, which enabled regioselective hydrxylation of tertiary carbon atoms of hydrocarbons, with a yield of 100%, in comparison to a few tenths of a percent, previously. As a postdoctoral fellow, he designed a new contrast agent for computed tomography of liver metastasis, made of iodinated starch particles, which enabled the detection of liver metastasis, smaller than 2 mm. During his career at BGU, he studied the biochemistry and developed the biotechnology of the production of several omega 6 and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, dihomogammalinolenic acid) from micro algae and was involved with the development of the biotechnology of the micro alga Haematococcus pluvialis, culminated in the establishment of a commercial facility in Ketura, Israel. == Academic and related positions == Between 1980 and 1981, . Hacohen had an appointment of assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School at Worcester, Massachusetts.
