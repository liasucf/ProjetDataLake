    "text": "Hamsterball is a video game developed by American studio Raptisoft Games, released on 8 February 2004 for Microsoft Windows. The TikGames PlayStation version was created on 25 March 2010. Similar to the arcade game Marble Madness, the goal is to complete a series of race courses in as short a time as possible while avoiding various obstacles. Instead of a marble, however, the player controls a hamster in a clear plastic exercise ball. A set amount of extra time is added to the player's clock at the beginning of each race; if time runs out, the game ends. Players can follow invisible paths hidden throughout the courses to unlock multiplayer combat arenas, in which the goal is to knock opponents' hamsters off the edge as many times as possible within a time limit. == Further reading == * Download Games Roundup * HamsterBall Review - IGN * Hamsterball Official Site - Play Hamsterball Online Game - Raptisoft == References == Category:2010 video games Category:Action video games Category:Fictional hamsters Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 3-only games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ",
