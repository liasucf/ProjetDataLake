    "text": "\"Say cheese\" is an English-language instruction used by photographers who want their subject or subjects to smile. By saying \"cheese\", most people form their mouths into what appears to be a smile-like shape. == History == In the late 19th century, different aesthetic and behavioral norms required keeping the mouth small, which led to photographers using \"say prunes\".http://techxplore.com/news/2015-11-cheese-style-curiosity-yearbook- photos.html ==In different languages and cultures== Perhaps because of strong Western influence, especially in the realm of photography, and perhaps because of increased numbers of Western visitors after photographic equipment became widely available, \"Say cheese\" has also entered into the Japanese language. However, \"say\" is almost always dropped from the phrase, resulting in simply being \"Cheese.\" This is usually in Japanese (and written in katakana) as \"chiizu\" (\u30c1\u30fc\u30ba). Other languages have adopted this method, albeit with different words that sound similar to cheese to get the desired effect of shaping the mouth to form a smile. *Argentina: \"whiskey\" (\"whiskey\", pronounced to end with an ee sound.) *Bulgaria: \"Zele\" (\"Cabbage\") *Brazil: \"Digam 'X'\" (\"Say 'X'\") (the name of the letter \"X\" in Portuguese (/\u0283is/) sounds a lot like the English word \"cheese\"). *Catalonia: \"Llu\u00eds\" (\"Lewis\") *China: \u8304\u5b50 (qie2zi), meaning \"eggplant\". The pronunciation of this word is notably similar to that of the English word \"cheese\". In Hong Kong, the phrase is \"\u4e00,\u4e8c,\u4e09\" (\"yat yi saam\") meaning \"1, 2, 3.\" *Colombia: \"whiskey\" (\"whiskey\", pronounced to end with an ee sound.) *Croatia: \"pti\u010dica\" (\"little bird\") *Czech Republic: \"s\u00fdr\" (\"cheese\") *Denmark: \"Sig appelsin\" (\"Say orange\") *Finland: \"Muikku\", a species of fish known in English as the vendace. *France and other French-speaking countries: \"ouistiti\" (\"marmoset\") *Germany: Food- related words like \"Spaghetti\", \"K\u00e4sekuchen\" (cheesecake), or \"Wurst\" are used, mainly to make children laugh for the picture. *Hungary: \"Itt rep\u00fcl a kis mad\u00e1r\" (\"Here flies the little bird\") \"cheese\" is also used, mostly by younger people. *India: \"paneer people also say hari\" (Hindi: \u092a\u0928\u0940\u0930) *Italy: \"d\u00ec cheese\" (\"say cheese\") *Morocco: \"Khbiz\" (\"bread\") *Iran: \"\u0633\u06cc\u0628\" (Saib), meaning \"Apple.\" *Israel: \"\u05ea\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5 \u05e6'\u05d9\u05d6\" (tagidu tshiz), meaning \"say cheese\". *Japan: \"Sei, No...\" (\"Ready, Set...\"). Also \u30c1\u30fc\u30ba (ch\u012bzu), meaning \"cheese\", is used. *Vietnam: \"2... 3... C\u01b0\u1eddi l\u00ean n\u00e0o!\" (\"2... 3... Smile!\"). And sometimes \"i..i..i....\" (pronounced like the name of the letter \"E\" in English). *Korea: \"kimchi\" *Most Latin American countries: \"Diga 'whiskey'\" (\"Say 'whiskey'\"). *Netherlands: \"Lach eens naar het vogeltje\" (\"Smile at the little bird\"). The English word \"cheese\" is also often used. *Nigeria: Many photographers prompt the subjects of their photographs to say \"cheese\" at the count of three *Portugal: \"Olha o passarinho\" (\"Look at the little bird\"). *Russia: The English word \"cheese\", or sometimes the Russian word \"\u0441\u044b\u0440\" (pronounced seer) which means \"cheese\". Also \"\u0421\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u044e\u043c\" (pronounced Skazhi izyum), meaning \"Say raisins\" (used as the title of a 1983 novel by Vasily Aksyonov). *Serbia: \"\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0430\" (\"Little bird\") which sounds like pteecheetsa *Slovakia: \"syr\" (\"cheese\") *Spain: \"di/decid patata\" (\"say potato\"). Also, \"mirar al pajarito\" (\"look at the birdie\"), intended to make people look directly at the camera. *Sweden: \"S\u00e4g omelett\" (\"Say omelette\") *Turkey: \"Peynir\" (\"cheese\") ==Footnotes== Category:Photography ",
