It features the singer and dancers performing the song in a basement. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1992\u201393) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia (ARIA Charts) |align=\"center\"|55 |- |align=\"left\"|Austria (\u00d63 Austria Top 40) |align=\"center\"|8 |- |align=\"left\"|Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) |align=\"center\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|Denmark (IFPI) |align=\"center\"|9 |- |align=\"left\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100 Singles) |align=\"center\"|7 |- |align=\"left\"|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|Germany (Media Control Charts) |align=\"center\"|5 |- |align=\"left\"|Ireland (IRMA) |align=\"center\"|4 |- |align=\"left\"|Israel (Israel Top-30) |align=\"center\"|14 |- |align=\"left\"|Italy (Hit Parade Italia) |align=\"center\"|19 |- |align=\"left\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) |align=\"center\"|8 |- |align=\"left\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100) |align=\"center\"|9 |- |align=\"left\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) |align=\"center\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss (Schweizer Hitparade) |align=\"center\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|11 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Music Week Dance Singles |align=\"center\"|3 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1993) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |align=\"center\"|79 |- |align=\"left\"|Germany (Official German Charts) |align=\"center\"|64 |- |align=\"left\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) |align=\"center\"|255 |- |align=\"left\"|Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) |align=\"center\"|38 |- |} ==References== Category:1992 singles Category:1992 songs Category:Felix (musician) songs Category:Number-one singles in Finland Category:Electro songs Category:Music videos directed by Lindy Heymann ",
