    "text": "Stanislav Shumovsky was a former Red Army Soldier and a Soviet spy who operated in the United States where he leaked aeronautical secrets back to his home country. == Biography == Stanislav worked at M.I.T. where he specialized in aeronautics. His brief was to transfer cutting edge aeronautical technology to the Soviet Union and to recruit American students as spies. Embedded into the United States as part of a 65 strong cohort of Soviet students who had come to America to attend prestigious universities, Stanislav arrived in New York in September 1931. His intelligence was used by the Soviet Union both during the Second World War and the Cold War. It is very possible that his intelligence was used to create the Tu-4, a Soviet clone of the B-29 Superfortress He reached such high esteem in the USA that he was invited to parties attended by Shirley Temple, and to the White House to meet then President Franklin D Roosevelt. He evaded detection his entire life because the FBI were preoccupied with Prohibition and the rise of Organised crime in the United States in the 1930s. Additionally, the FBI had not been involved in Counter Intelligence since the First World War because they did not expect there was enough espionage occurring in the USA. ==Discovery== Archives By- Fellow Svetlana Lokhova at Churchill College, Cambridge discovered the spy after reading documents and papers from the Mitrokhin Archive at Churchill College. In 2018 she published a book on Stanislav called 'The Spy Who Changed History'. He is believed to be a member of a wider Soviet programme aimed at technology transfer from the USA. ==Legacy== During the early Cold War, once either superpower could produce atom bombs, delivery of such bomb was of crucial importance. Since rocketry was still in its infancy and ICBMs had yet to be developed, long range bombers were the sole method of delivery. Shumovsky's espionage was an important part of providing a Soviet nuclear deterrent. ==Sources== * * * Category:Cold War espionage Category:Soviet people of Polish descent ",
