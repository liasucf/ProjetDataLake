    "text": "The Bryant-Lasater House is a historic house at 770 North Main Street in Mulberry, Arkansas. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, set on a foundation of molded concrete blocks, with a shallow-pitch pyramidal roof (pierced on each side by a hip-roof dormer), and a hip-roof porch extending across the front. A rear porch has been enclosed. Built c. 1900, the house is locally distinctive for its architecture, as a particularly large example of a pyramid-roofed house, and for its historical role as the home of a succession of locally prominent doctors, including Dr. O. J. Kirksey, who operated a maternity hospital in the house. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Crawford County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1900 Category:Houses in Crawford County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Crawford County, Arkansas ",
