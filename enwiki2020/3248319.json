Terms like \"exposition\" or \"exhibition\" were commonly used to indicate that the spectacles were authentic ethnographic examples of people from the true Wild West. Many of the performers were cowboys and Native Americans who had been involved in legendary battles and historic events before seeing their way of life change dramatically with the settlement of the American frontier. == References == == Bibliography == * Russell, Don, The Wild West: A History of the Wild West Shows, Fort Worth: Amon Carter Museum of Western Art, 1970.
