The album was partly recorded in their apartment in Paris, and partly at Propeller Studio in Oslo together with the producer Thomas Tofte. The record was released in 2012. \"Even Faster Still\" is a phrase from a self-hypnosis course. === Mr. Teenager and touring === In 2014 Level & Tyson released Mr. Teenager, a stand-alone single collaborating with Japanese noise musician Sakamoto Hiromichi. The collaboration was an initiative from Noir and S\u00e6ther after watching \"We Don\u2019t Care About Music Anyway\", a documentary about Japanese noise music. Level & Tyson visited USA for the first time at the Culture Collide festival in October 2014. The Huffington Post marked their San Francisco concert as \"refreshingly unique\", whilst Buzzbands LA said their LA-concert \"perhaps made rock music as intimate as it could get\". === Gruesome Twosome === The band released the first single Tied Up on 7 May 2015, followed by No Fun My Head on 4 September. CMJ premiered the second single a week early, announcing the track list and release date of the upcoming album. The album was scheduled to be released 25 September. == Discography == === Studio albums === * Even Faster Still (Das Kirurg/Tuba, 2012) * Gruesome Twosome (DIG!, 2015) === Singles === * Mr. Teenager feat.
