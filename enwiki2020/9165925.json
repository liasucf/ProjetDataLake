It is run at Down Royal over a distance of 1 mile 4 furlongs and 150 yards (2,551 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June. The event was established in 1936, and it was originally restricted to three-year-olds. For a period it was contested over 1 mile, 4 furlongs and 68 yards. It was opened to older horses in 1994, and increased in distance to 1 mile, 4 furlongs and 190 yards (2,588 metres). In 2014 it was restricted to three-year-olds again and reduced to 1 mile and 3 furlongs (2, 213 metres) before being increased to its present distance in 2015. The Ulster Derby is Northern Ireland's most valuable flat race. ==Records== Most successful horse: * no horse has won this race more than once Leading jockey since 1962 (4 wins): * Tommy Murphy \u2013 Dumbwaiter (1974), Caucasus (1975), Transworld (1977), Encyclopedia (1978) Leading trainer since 1962 (7 wins): * Vincent O'Brien \u2013 Onandaga (1969), Tantoul (1971), Dumbwaiter (1974), Caucasus (1975), Transworld (1977), Encyclopedia (1978), Baba Karam (1987) * Jim Bolger - Nordic Region (1990), Kirov Premiere (1993), Citizen Edward (2001,dd-ht), Wexford Town (2014), Stellar Mass (2016), Clongowes (2017), Change of Velocity (2018) ==Winners since 1988== * Weights given in stones and pounds. {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" !
