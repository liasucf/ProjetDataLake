    "text": "Jacques Dudon is a French just intonation composer and instrument builder. He is best known for developing a series of photosonic disk () instruments in the 1980s that produced sound from modulated light (a light source shines through painted glass discs; the resulting patterns of light are picked up by photo cells and converted into a voltage which can then be treated as a sound signal). right The production of synthetic sound in this manner has been used in \"optosonic\" instruments since the early 20th century (for example the Optophonic Piano). However Dudon's method is notable for the generation of tone which is produced by the overlapping of two or three discs, and the opportunities this design provides for timbral shifts by slowing one or more discs manually, thereby altering the waveform. In the 1970s, he created 150 water instruments called \"aquaphones\" (described in his pioneering book ), including a \"flutabullum\", a system of transforming flute sounds by recording them underwater). ==Aquavina== The aquavina was an experimental musical instrument created by Jacques Dudon.Hopkin, Bart (1996). Gravikords, Whirlies & Pyrophones: Experimental Musical Instruments, . Ellipsis Arts. . It was essentially a variant of the Appalachian dulcimer, but with a metal resonator body partially filled with water. The player would agitate the instrument while playing, resulting in a constant acoustic phasing effect within the instrument's harmonics. ==See also== *Hydraulophone ==References== ==External links== *Aquavina at Windworld.com *\"WaveLoom\", logiciel d'aide \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de disques photosoniques, recherche.ircam.fr Category:Living people Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:French musical instrument makers Category:French experimental musicians Category:French inventors Category:Experimental composers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Experimental string instruments Category:20th-century French musicians Category:20th-century French male musicians ",
