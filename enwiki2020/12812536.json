After Ingo lost the world championship in heavy weight boxing the drink was renamed Zingo in 1962. Originally Zingo was produced in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden by Pripps. Pripps was bought by Carlsberg in 2000 and they continue to manufacture Zingo. ==Sources== * Carlsberg Sweden * Swedish Wikipedia on Zingo ==See also== * Zingo-nostalgi!
