    "text": "The Arve () is a river in France, in the d\u00e9partement of Haute-Savoie, and (for a few kilometers) in Switzerland. It is a left tributary of the Rh\u00f4ne. It is long. Rising in the northern side of the Mont Blanc massif in the Alps, close to the Swiss border, it receives water from the many glaciers of the Chamonix valley (mainly the Mer de Glace) before flowing north-west into the Rh\u00f4ne on the west side of Geneva, where its much higher level of silt brings forth a striking contrast between the two rivers. The Arve flows through Chamonix, Sallanches, O\u00ebx, Cluses, Bonneville, Annemasse and Geneva. ==Gallery== Image:Rh\u00f4ne and Arve Junction.jpg|The Arve (right) meets the Rh\u00f4ne in Geneva Image:Arve \u00e0 Chamonix.jpg|The Arve in Chamonix ==References== Category:Rivers of Switzerland Category:Rivers of France Category:Rivers of Haute-Savoie Category:International rivers of Europe Category:Rivers of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne- Alpes Category:Rivers of the canton of Geneva Category:Rivers of the Alps ",
