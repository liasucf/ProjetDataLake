One of several rice bug species, it may be confused with Leptocorisa oratoria. == Pest status == Rice bugs can be a significant pest of the rice plant, as they feed-on developing (milk stage) grains: reducing crop quality and sometimes yield. Because attacks occur near to harvest, if farmers spray insecticides in an attempt to control outbreaks, they risk leaving harmful pesticide residues on the crop. ==References== ==External Links== * * Category:Alydidae Category:Hemiptera of Asia ",
