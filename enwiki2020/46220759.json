Prior to his term as Dean, he was already notable for having been an early president of the Manila Medical Society (now known as the Philippine Medical Association), and as the first editor in chief of the UST Journal of Medicine. == Service during World War II == Dr. Mencias had been appointed Dean of the College of Medicine at the University of Santo Tomas in 1936, and continued in that capacity when war broke out in December 1941 and when the Japanese forces firmed up their occupation of the Philippines in 1942. Throughout this time and the period of guerrilla resistance which followed, Dr. Mencias aided the resistance by secretly treating wounded guerillas and soldiers, both Filipino and American. == Personal life == Bonifacio Lopez Mencias was born on May 14, 1888, in Villasis, Pangasinan. He graduated from Colegio de San Juan de Letran and was an active alumnus who once served on the 1939 Alumni Board. He was married to Barbara Sacro of Batac, Ilocos Norte, and had six children: Rosario, Eleno, Pilar, Margarita, Bernardita, and Ramon. He bought a parcel of land in San Juan, Rizal, in the 1930s, on the corner of P. Guevarra and A. Luna streets, and raised his family there. == Disappearance and presumed death == When the Japanese Kempeitai (military police) arrested a nephew of Dr. Mencias' who they suspected of being involved with the guerillas, they found Dr. Mencias' identification card in his possession.

Ramos, who served as UST's University Registrar from 1930 to 1980 recounts in his book detailing the history of UST: > \"The UST community laments Dean Mencias' demise especially because of the > way he died. He was a devoted administrator... Those of us who knew him and > had the opportunity to work with him at the University will always remember > him as a kind and simple man, deeply religious; and above all, he was never > found wanting in the conduct of his public relations.\" Luna Mencias Street, a national road traversing the boundaries of and connecting the cities of San Juan and Mandaluyong in Metro Manila, is partly named after Dr. Mencias. The street had originally been named A Luna Street, after General Antonio Luna of the Philippine revolution. After the second world war, it was renamed in honor of Dr. Mencias. == References == Category:1888 births Category:1940s deaths Category:Filipino epidemiologists Category:Filipino people of World War II Category:Forced disappearances in the Philippines Category:People executed by Japanese occupation forces Category:People from Pangasinan Category:People from San Juan, Metro Manila Category:Colegio de San Juan de Letran alumni Category:20th-century Filipino medical doctors Category:Filipino military doctors ",
