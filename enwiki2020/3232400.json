A satire of Catholic teachings on reproduction that forbid masturbation and contraception, the song was released on the album Monty Python Sings and was nominated for a BAFTA Music Award for Best Original Song in a Film in 1983. Andr\u00e9 Jacquemin and David Howman wrote the music and Michael Palin and Terry Jones wrote the lyrics and performed the song, which is hailed as one of the Pythons' great sketches. Viewing Python as the \u201cgreat originator\u201d of combining provocative humour and high-quality original music, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane regarded the song as his favourite Python number, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s so beautifully written, it\u2019s musically and lyrically legit, the orchestrations are fantastic, the choreography and the presentation are very, very complex \u2013 it\u2019s treated seriously.\u201d ==Content and production== The song is a satire of Catholic teachings on reproduction that forbid masturbation and contraception by artificial means. The sketch, called \"The Third World\", is about a Catholic Yorkshire worker played by Michael Palin, with his wife played by director Terry Jones. They have sixty- three children, who are about to be sold for scientific experimentation purposes because their parents can no longer afford to care for such a large family with the local mill being closed. When their children ask why they should not use any form of birth control, or why the father cannot perform self-castration, their father explains that this is against God's wishes, and breaks into song, the chorus of which is: The stern Protestant couple (Palin and Jones at the 2014 Python reunion) comment disapprovingly on the Catholic Church forbidding contraception while the Catholic couple next door (and their 63 children) sing \u201cEvery Sperm is Sacred\u201d The production in The Meaning of Life was filmed in Colne, Lancashire, and Burnley, Lancashire, and choreographed by Arlene Phillips to a storyboard by Jones. The hearty and cheerful nature of the musical number is counterpointed as the children are marched off to their fate as the song ends, singing a dour rendition of the chorus as their middle-aged Protestant neighbours (played by Graham Chapman and Eric Idle) comment on the teachings of the Catholic Church. They add that they have two children, which is the exact number of times they have had sex in their marriage. The grounds of Cartwright Hall art gallery in Bradford, West Yorkshire, was used as a location for the singing and dancing nurses. The song is a style pastiche of the song \"Consider Yourself\", from the musical Oliver! by Lionel Bart. Later, Jones denied that it was explicitly written to make fun of the genre of musical comedy: Every Sperm is Sacred' is not a parody of these things, it just is those things, it's a musical song, it's a hymn, it's a Lionel Bart-style musical, but it's not making fun of a Lionel Bart-style musical.\" The song was performed at Monty Python Live (Mostly), with Idle singing Palin's part. It also has the Protestant married couple with Palin playing the Protestant husband. ==Influence== ===Sexuality and reproduction=== The phrase \"every sperm is sacred\" has become almost proverbial in the field of animal and human sexuality and reproduction. This extends to such areas as cloning, where the song is used to criticize anti- cloning activists who argue that every embryo or fertilized egg is sacred. P. 82. Abortion-rights activists have sung the song outside abortion clinics to ridicule their opponents, legal scholars have alluded to it in discussions of women's reproductive rights, and it is used generally to do what has been described as \"[exposing] the absurdity of the anti-choice argument when taken to its extreme\". ===Religion=== The religious import of the sketch is significant, and is reflected in the widely dispersed usage of the phrase. In the book Monty Python and Philosophy, the argument is teased out to reach a broader (still humorous) conclusion: \"The Pythons ask us to consider the consequences of the belief that God cares about our reproductive practices and sees everything. If so, then he watches our sexual activities. ...Christians must concede that all things considered, this [watching people have sex] is one of God's less onerous activities.\" Philip Jenkins discusses the sketch as an important sign of a growing willingness in the popular media of the 1970s and 1980s to criticize the Catholic Church, saying that \"Catholic attitudes toward sex and contraception are ruthlessly parodied\" in the song, proving that \"Catholicism was available as a legitimate subject of serious fiction.\" Richard Dawkins, in his The God Delusion, cites the song for that reason, the illustration of the \"surreal idiocy\" of some pro-religion, anti-abortion arguments. ===Masturbation=== It is sometimes difficult to separate the comic from the serious application of the phrase, and two recent publications on the penis use it for precisely that purpose, Talking Cock, by Richard Herring, and Dick: A User's Guide. In both cases, the sketch is used to ridicule those who condemn masturbation, and sex for any purpose other than procreation. ==Reverse censorship== According to the interview with Palin on the DVD extras, he said \"at the end of my sock\" in the original scene, with the word \"cock\" being overdubbed later. This was done because the scene featured numerous underage children and the Pythons were already concerned they were \"pushing the limit\". By modern-day child safety standards, Monty Python's skit involving children would constitute a clear breach in ethical standards. Years later, several of the child actors stated they had no idea what they were singing about. ==See also== * Humor about Catholicism ==References== ==External links== * Every Sperm is Sacred - Monty Python's The Meaning of Life - Official Monty Python channel on YouTube.
