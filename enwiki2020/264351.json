    "text": "\"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" is a 1979 song by the English band Tubeway Army. Taken from their album Replicas, it was released as a single in May 1979 and reached number one in the UK Singles Chart, staying there for four weeks. It was written and produced by Gary Numan, the band's frontman and lead vocalist. ==Music and production== \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" features three different sections: a recurring \"verse\" with a synth riff in C and B flat, a recurring section with spoken word over slow arpeggiated seventh chords, and an instrumental break in F. The instrumentation is quite minimal: there is a conventional drum and bass guitar backing track, some additional heavily flanged guitar (particularly in the instrumental break), subdued vocals and, most prominently, Minimoog and Polymoog synthesisers. These synth parts include portamento background lines. Numan stumbled upon synthesisers by accident. While intending to record a punk album, he noticed a Minimoog synthesiser that had been left in the studio.BBC documentary: Synth Britannia. In a 2014 interview with The Guardian, Numan commented on the song's lyrics; ==B-side== The B-side of the single was a more rock-oriented number, \"We Are So Fragile\". It was performed on Numan's 1979 \"Touring Principle\" series of concerts and appears on the album Living Ornaments '79. The song was covered by bis on the compilation album Random. ==Reception== Despite being over five minutes long and possessing, in the words of its composer, \"no recognisable hook-line whatsoever\", the single topped the UK charts. Whilst the track's distinctive sound stood out at the time, sales also benefited from the record company's use of a picture disc and Numan's striking, \"robotic\" performance on the TV shows The Old Grey Whistle Test and Top of the Pops. \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" has been a mainstay of Numan's concerts since its release and appears on all ten of his official live recordings to date. A semi-acoustic version appeared on the 2006 Jagged tour set list. Writing for Smash Hits in 1979, Cliff White described the song as \"a dark, threatening wall of synthesised sound\" which \"throbbed ominously behind a gloomy song of paranoia and loneliness\". White went on to say it was \"gripping stuff, but cheerful it isn't\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Tubeway Army * Gary Numan \u2013 Minimoog and Polymoog synthesizers, guitar, vocals * Paul Gardiner \u2013 bass guitar * Jess Lidyard \u2013 drums Production * Gary Numan \u2013 production ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1979) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report) |12 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1979) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |7 |} ===Certifications=== ==Sampling and cover versions== The song was sampled by Richard X in a song titled \"We Don't Give a Damn About Our Friends\" as a mashup with vocals from Adina Howard's \"Freak like Me\", which the Sugababes then recorded under the latter title and achieved a number one UK hit in 2002 (Numan considered this track to be better than \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\").
