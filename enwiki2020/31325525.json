General Philemon Dickinson (1739-1809) bought it in July 1776, as a rural retreat along the Delaware River, and named it \"The Hermitage.\" He lived here with his wife Mary Cadwalader and children, Mary and Samuel.W. Jay Mills, Historic Houses of New Jersey (1902) The frame house was torn down about 1905, but a much larger stone-and-stucco addition built in 1784 still stands. The addition was extensively remodeled in the Italianate style in the mid-19th century. During his partial term as U.S. Senator from New Jersey (1790\u201393), Dickinson hosted First Lady Martha Washington as a houseguest (May 17\u201319, 1791).Tobias Lear to George Washington, May 15 & 22, 1791, The Papers of George Washington, Presidential Series, vol. 8, Dorothy Twohig, ed.

President John Adams was frequently entertained during the summer of 1798, when yellow fever in Philadelphia caused the federal government to evacuate to Trenton, although he lodged at a nearby hotel. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton were reportedly guests, along with Frenchmen General Rochambeau, Joseph Bonaparte, and Louis Philippe (later King of France).Mills File:Residence of General Philemon Dickinson, Trenton, New Jersey (NYPL b12349181-420041).jpg|House as shown in an 1820 publication In the early-20th century, the street grid was expanded around the house (note that the building sits at an angle to Colonial Avenue).
