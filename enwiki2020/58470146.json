She spent three years in Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago where she began writing poetry at age 11 at the suggestion of a librarian. Gatwood's continued interest in poetry stemmed from her use of the art form as an outlet for her emotions; in an interview she explained, \"teenagers have a lot of feelings and thoughts, but are often told that there's no space for those things to exist. But spoken word is the exact opposite. The more you can express, the better.\" While still in high school, Gatwood lead a collection of women who reported a local bakery to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for sexual harassment and won a settlement of over $10,000. Gatwood graduated from the Pratt Institute's fiction program in 2015. ==Career== Gatwood is a poet, writer, activist, speaker, and educator on topics that include sexual assault prevention and recovery. Gatwood was a finalist at Brave New Voices, Women of the World and the National Poetry Slam. Her performances have been featured on HBO, Huffington Post, MTV, VH1, and BBC among others. Her work has been featured in Muzzle Magazine, The Winter Tangerine Review, Poetry City U.S.A., Tinderbox Poetry Journal, and The Missouri Review. Gatwood and fellow poet Megan Falley created an interactive show called Speak Like a Girl, a traveling poetry show that focuses on gender issues, body image, growing up and other topics. The pair has performed \"Speak Like a Girl\" in cities across the United States, including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Detroit.
