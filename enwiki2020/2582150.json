The club was founded September 19, 1937 and is also known as \"Bianco-Blu\" (English: white and blues). Though they have never won the league championship, the club has not been relegated to the Swiss League since being promoted in 1985, the same year that saw the arrival of Dale McCourt. The team plays its home games in the 6,500-seat Valascia. The 2020/21 season will be their final year in the current arena as they are scheduled to move in the Nuova Valascia prior to the 2021/22 season. ==History== The fans in 2014 Ambr\u00ec and Piotta are two very small villages in the municipality of Quinto, located in the northern part of the valley Leventina canton Ticino, with a combined population of 500 people. Ambr\u00ec- Piotta has more than 40 fan clubs all over Europe. For major events, like the derby against southern rivals HC Lugano, the fans compose a choreography. When Ambr\u00ec wins a game, fans rejoice to the valley anthem La Montanara. The team on the ice in 2014 Since 1959, they have called their self-owned Valascia as their home. Standing 1,000 meters above sea level, it is an open-ended facility with 2,000 seats and additional standing room space for 5,000. Facing financial strains the team raised roughly 5 million Swiss Francs in the summer of 2013. The donations given to HC Ambri-Piotta came from both large and small donations, many of which were given via SMS. The efforts of the team and its fans have secured the right to play in the National League. ==Honours== ===Domestic=== National League * Runners-up (1): 1998\u201399 Swiss Cup * Winners (1): 1962 ===International=== IIHF Continental Cup * Winners (2): 1998\u201399, 1999\u20132000 IIHF Super Cup * Winners (1): 1999 * Runners-up (1): 2000 ==Players== ===Current roster=== ===NHL alumni=== * Richard Park * Marco Baron * Andy Bathgate * Paul DiPietro * Hnat Domenichelli * Pauli Jaks * Kim Johnsson * Valeri Kamensky * Larry Kwong * Andreas Lilja * Ryan Malone * Dale McCourt * Oleg Petrov * Robert Petrovicky * Leif Rohlin * Jean-Guy Trudel * Erik Westrum * Matt Duchene * Max Pacioretty * Cory Schneider * Maxim Noreau * Scottie Upshall * Dominik Kubalik ==References== ==External links== * Official site of Hockey Club Ambr\u00ec-Piotta * Ambr\u00ec-Piotta fan site Category:Ice hockey teams in Switzerland ",
