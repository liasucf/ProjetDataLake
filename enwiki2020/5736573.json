    "text": "Levormeloxifene (; developmental code names 6720-CDRI, NNC-460020) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) which was being developed as an alternative to estrogen replacement therapy for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal bone loss but did not complete development and hence was never marketed. The development was stopped because of a high incidence of gynecological side effects during clinical trials. Levormeloxifene is the levorotatory enantiomer of ormeloxifene, which, in contrast, has been marketed, though rather as a hormonal contraceptive. ==See also== * List of selective estrogen receptor modulators ==References== ==External links== * Levormeloxifene - AdisInsight Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Chromenes Category:Ethers Category:Pyrrolidines Category:Selective estrogen receptor modulators ",
