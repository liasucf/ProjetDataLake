He was appointed as premier by King Carol II after the assassination of his predecessor Armand C\u0103linescu by the nationalist Iron Guard, and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. His first noted measures included the public display of the bodies of C\u0103linescu's assassins (who had been killed by orders from Horia Sima) and the arbitrary arrest and execution without trial of at least three Iron Guard members in each county. He was replaced as premier by Constantin Argetoianu. Immediately after the establishment of the Iron Guard's National Legionary State, Arge\u015fanu himself was imprisoned without trial in the Jilava prison, and ultimately killed there during the Jilava Massacre by members of the Iron Guard on the same night together with 63 other political prisoners, in retaliation for the violence he had endorsed. Arge\u015fanu was married to the pianist Manya Botez. ==Gallery== File:Argeseanu.jpg|Gheorghe Arge\u015fanu in the 1910s ==References== *http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/Gheorghe_Arge%C5%9Feanu Category:1883 births Category:1940 deaths Category:People from Caracal, Romania Category:Prime Ministers of Romania Category:Romanian Ministers of Defence Category:Romanian Land Forces generals Category:Romanian military attach\u00e9s Category:Romanian military personnel of World War I Category:Romanian people of World War II Category:World War II political leaders Category:Romanian people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners who died in Romanian detention Category:People assassinated by the Romanian Iron Guard Category:Prisoners murdered in custody Category:People murdered in Romania Category:Burials at Ghencea Cemetery ",
