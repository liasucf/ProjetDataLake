    "text": "The following article outlines the awards and nominations received by Kenyan afro-pop band Sauti Sol. Formed in 2005, the band has since grown to become one of the most successful musical acts in Africa, gaining considerable attention, praise and recognition for their work. While neither their debut studio album Mwanzo nor any of its songs were nominated for any awards, the group received a nomination for Best African Newcomer at the 2010 African Music Awards. They received their first major accolade the same year, winning Best Group at the Museke Online Africa Music Awards. In 2011, Sauti Sol was named Best Fusion Artist/Group of the Year at the Kisima Music Awards, while the music video for the song \"Coming Home\" from their second studio album Sol Filosofia won Best Music Video. The following 3 years saw them pick up a further 6 awards, most notably winning Best African Act at the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards, becoming the first Kenyan musicians to receive the award. In 2015, the release of their third studio album Live and Die in Afrika saw the group receive continued recognition. The song \"Sura Yako\" was nominated for 9 awards, winning Most Downloaded Single, Most Downloaded Afro-Pop Single and Most Downloaded Song at the Mdundo Music Awards, while its music video won YouTube Video of the Year at the Pulse Music Video Awards. The song \"Nerea\", featuring the duo Amos and Josh, also received numerous nominations, winning Best Collaboration of the Year at the Pulse Music Video Awards. The group was also nominated for Best International Act: Africa at the BET Awards, but lost out to Ghanaian musician Stonebwoy. ==Abryanz Style and Fashion Awards== {| class =\"wikitable\" |- !
