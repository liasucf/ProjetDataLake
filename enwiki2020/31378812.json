PRS was started by the Maharaja of Cochin in the year 1941 as a camp or shelter for beggars. In the last decade there is a remarkable improvement in the overall functioning of PRS and the local and even international community is closely associating with various programmes. PRS is successful in psychiatric rehabilitation of many inmates and sending back to their homes. The objective of the Settlement was to accommodate destitutes, wanderers and beggars but as time passes only the psychiatric patients remain in the institution and rest of the inmates are either sent to their own homes or states they belong. That's how, the institution is well known as a psychiatric setting. Constant efforts are made by the officials to relocate the psychiatric patients with help of volunteers and government officials. == References == Category:Orphanages in India Category:Buildings and structures in Ernakulam district Category:1941 establishments in India Category:Non-profit organisations based in India Category:Charities based in India ",
