It was part of the Fosen region along the coast. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Roan. Other villages included Bessaker, Brandsfjord, and Hofstad. A large wind park is located on the mountain plateau just southeast of Bessaker. At the time of its dissolution in 2020, the municipality was the 248th largest by area out of the 422 municipalities in Norway. Roan was the 399th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 953.

On 1 January 2018, the municipality switched from the old S\u00f8r- Tr\u00f8ndelag county to the new Tr\u00f8ndelag county. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring municipalities of Roan and \u00c5fjord merged into one large municipality called \u00c5fjord. ===Name=== The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Roan farm where the first Roan Church was built. The name is probably derived from the Old Norse word r\u00f3\u00f0a which means \"pole\" a reference to a mountain peak behind the farm. ===Coat of arms=== The coat of arms was granted on 22 May 1987. The arms show three silver terns on a blue background. Terns, a very watchful and energetic bird, are intended to symbolize the local inhabitants and the coast with the vast bird life in the area. ===Churches=== The Church of Norway had one parish () within the municipality of Roan. It is part of the Fosen prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ style=\"font- size:medium\"|Churches in Roan !Parish ()!!Church Name!!Location of the Church!!Year Built |- |Roan||Roan Church||Roan||1702 |} ==Geography== View of the highest point in Roan municipality View of the Skj\u00f8rafjorden along the Roan coast Roan was located on the Fosen peninsula between the municipalities of \u00c5fjord (to the south) and Osen (to the north), with Namdalseid to the east. Roan also included a number of islands in the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Three major fjords cut into the landscape: the Brandsfjorden in the north, Bersfjorden in the central part, and the Skj\u00f8rafjorden in the south. The Kaura lighthouse was located on a small island in the mouth of the Brandsfjorden. The Hellfjorden is a small fjord arm that branches off the main Brandsfjorden. The landscape was very hilly, with bare mountaintops reaching above sea level. The highest mountain is the tall D\u00e5apma on the border with Namdalseid. ==Government== All municipalities in Norway, including Roan, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor. The municipality falls under the Fosen District Court and the Frostating Court of Appeal. ===Municipal council=== The municipal council () of Roan is made up of 17 representatives that are elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows: ==Population== Almost all the inhabitants lived along the coast or in the Hofstaddalen valley. The islands were all generally uninhabited with few exceptions. The island of Brands\u00f8ya, which has a bridge connecting it to the mainland, has some inhabitants.
