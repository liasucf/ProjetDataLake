His father was the proprietor of the loan bank in Buren and Tiel. He moved to Amsterdam, where he completed his Master\u2019s in silversmithing in 1792. That same year Bonebakker married Elisabeth du Pr\u00e9 (1760-1811). Seven daughters and a son, Jacques Antoine Bonebakker (1798-1868), were born from this marriage. Bonebakker partnered up with Diederik Lodewijk Bennewitz to take over a well-known Dutch gold, silver and jewellery shop in 1802, the Peirolet brothers\u2019 business. Initially under the brothers Peirolet, Bennewitz & Bonebakker name and later as Bennewitz & Bonebakker. He remarried in 1818, this time with Wijnanda Lucretia Tijdeman (1770-1826). He became a member of the Royal Academy of Visual Arts around 1820. === Bennewitz & Bonebakker === Bennewitz was tasked with managing the workshop within the Bennewitz and Bonebakker company. Bonebakker took responsibility for the business side of things. Although he was registered as a silversmith, Adrianus Bonebakker is not known to have produced any of his own work, according to the Dutch Institute for Art History. The work was outsourced to gold and silversmiths like T.G. Bentvelt, J.A. de Haas, A.H. Pape, D.W. Rethmeyer, H.P. La Ruelle and J.H. Stellingwerff. Prestigious assignments during this period included, for example, the ones commissioned by the City of Amsterdam to produce the so- called city keys. These keys to the City of Amsterdam were produced in 1806 to be offered to King Lodewijk Napoleon as he entered the city. Circumstances dictated this didn\u2019t actually happen until 1808. The same set of keys were used in 1813 during King Willem I\u2019s entry. A second set of keys to Amsterdam were produced in 1811 and handed to Napoleon Bonaparte on 9th October of that year. Both sets were made by Bennewitz. The second set wasn\u2019t paid for by Amsterdam until four years later. The original keys now form part of the Amsterdam Museum\u2019s collection. The company was commissioned by the City of Amsterdam to produce Prince Willem (later King Willem II) and Anna Paulowna\u2019s wedding gift in 1816. This gift consisted of a 419-piece dinner service, an important part of which can still be admired in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. === As Bonebakker & Zoon === The partners decided to part company in 1821 for business reasons, after which Bennewitz launched the Bennewitz & Zonen company and Bonebakker and his son continued under the As Bonebakker & Zoon name. The company was commissioned by King Willem II to make the royal crown in 1840. The maker of this crown, which to this day is still being used during coronation ceremonies, was Theodorus Gerardus Bentvelt. The company still exists today, under the Bonebakker name.
