Santa Caterina with octagona dome and unfinished facade. ==History== The church was commissioned by the Dominican order, and dedicated to St Catherine of Siena. A sumptuous church, modelled after the Pantheon of Rome was designed originally by Giovanni Del Fantasia; however, after construction began in 1720, progress was slow and interrupted, and thus a new design was ordered in 1729 from Alessandro Saller, then Giovanni Masini, and finally Giuseppe Ruggieri. While the church was consecrated finally in 1753, the facade still remains unfinished. The lantern tower was completed in 1869 by Dario Giacomelli. The dome rises 63 meters to the lantern. Interior decoration, including the frescoes of the Evangelists in the cupola, were added in the 19th century by Cesare Maffei. Other paintings depict St Dominic receives the Rosary and Three Mysteries of the Madonna. In 1785, the Dominican order was suppressed in Tuscany, and the church was granted to the Confraternity of Saints Cosmas and Damian. In 1808, Napoleonic forces suppressed the church and converted it into a prison. It was reconsecrated in 1822, and reverted to Dominicans control only in 1871. Above the main door is a canvas depicting the Coronation of Mary by Giorgio Vasari. That painting was once in the Vatican and only acquired for the church in the 19th century. The large chapel, to the right of the entrance, is dedicated to St Catherine of Siena, and houses a wooden statue of the saint carved by Cesare Tarrini, and frescoes depicting the Glory of St Thomas Acquinas by Giuseppe Maria Terreni.Guida storica ed artistica della citt\u00e0 e dei dintorni di Livorno, by Giuseppe Piombanti Forni Editore, Bologna 1903, pages 203-206.

It is flanked by canvases by Lorenzo Grottanelli, depicting St Catherine exhorts Gregory XI to return to Rome, and a Procession in Siena dedicated to St Catherine.
