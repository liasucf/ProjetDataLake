The station has been laid deep underground due to problems with water isolation during its construction. It consists of a central hall with rows of columns near the platforms. The columns are covered with glazed tiles, consisting of rows of different coloured tiles. The entrance to the station is located on the corner of the Prospekt Peremohy (Victory Avenue) and the Dovzhenko Street. ==External links== * Kyivsky Metropoliten \u2014 Station description and photographs * Metropoliten.kiev.ua \u2014 Station description and photographs * mirmetro.net - photos and description.
