Bobylev attended the Maple Leafs 2017 training camp the following summer before he was reassigned to AHL affiliate, the Toronto Marlies, in order to partake in another training camp. He returned to Russia at the conclusion of the Marlies training camp, joining Salavat Yulaev Ufa in a trade from Spartak and signing a three-year contract to begin the 2017-18 season. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
