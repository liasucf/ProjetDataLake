    "text": "Jesus Manuel Rojas Diaz (born December 26, 1986 in Caguas, Puerto Rico) is a Puerto Rican boxer who is the former WBA (Regular) featherweight champion. ==Professional career== After turning professional in 2006 Rojas amassed a record of 25-1-2-1 in 11 years before challenging and beating Dominican Claudio Marrero for the interim WBA featherweight title. In July 2018 the World Boxing Association announced that Rojas has been upgraded to 'Regular champion' and that he will be making his first defense against Mexican American boxer Joseph Diaz. Diaz however, came into the fight overweight, missing the required weight limit by 0.6 pounds. According to WBA rules, this meant that Rojas gets to keep his title regardless of the outcome of the fight. Diaz would end up handing Rojas his first defeat in 10 years, by a 12-round unanimous decision. In a fight deemed an early \"fight of the year\" candidate, Rojas was defending his WBA title against Chinese star and WBA #2 at featherweight Can Xu. Xu would end up edging out Rojas through a highly controversial unanimous decision. The official scorecards, 118-110, 117-111, and 116-112 were in wide favor of Xu, even though the punch output from Rojas aluded the fight was much closer than that. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |32 |Loss |26\u20133\u20132 |align=left| Xu Can | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |31 |Loss |26\u20132\u20132 |align=left| Joseph Diaz | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |30 |Win |26\u20131\u20132 |align=left| Claudio Marrero | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |29 |Win |25\u20131\u20132 |align=left| Abraham Lopez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |28 |Win |24\u20131\u20132 |align=left| Jesus A Valdez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |27 |Win |23\u20131\u20132 |align=left| Kiun Evans | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |26 |Draw |22\u20131\u20132 |align=left| Jorge Lara | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |25 |Win |22\u20131\u20131 |align=left| Braulio Santos | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |24 |Win |21\u20131\u20131 |align=left| Jose Angel Beranza | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |23 |Win |20\u20131\u20131 |align=left| Juan Carlos Pena | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |22 |Win |19\u20131\u20131 |align=left| Juan Jose Beltran | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |21 |style=\"background:#DDD\"| |18\u20131\u20131 |align=left| Jorge Arce | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |20 |Draw |18\u20131\u20131 |align=left| Jose Luis Araiza | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |19 |Win |18\u20131 |align=left| Miguelo Tavarez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |18 |Win |17\u20131 |align=left| Isaac Hidalgo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |17 |Win |16\u20131 |align=left| Reynaldo Lopez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |16 |Win |15\u20131 |align=left| Luis Angel Paneto | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |15 |Win |14\u20131 |align=left| Richard Pitt | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |14 |Loss |13\u20131 |align=left| Jose Angel Beranza | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |align=left| Anyetei Laryea | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |align=left| Alex Baba | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |align=left| Andres Ledesma | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |align=left| Carlos Diaz | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |align=left| Baladan Trevizo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |align=left| Torrence Daniels | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |align=left| Ricardo Blackman | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |align=left| Enrique Quevedo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |align=left| Ubaldo Olivencia | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |align=left| Arturo Colon | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |align=left| Jose Gonzalez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |align=left| Jose Gonzalez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |align=left| Christopher Sanchez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |} ==See also== *List of featherweight boxing champions ==References== ==External links== * *Jesus Rojas - Profile, News Archive & Current Rankings at Box.Live Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Super-bantamweight boxers Category:Featherweight boxers Category:World featherweight boxing champions Category:World Boxing Association champions Category:Puerto Rican male boxers Category:People from Caguas, Puerto Rico ",
