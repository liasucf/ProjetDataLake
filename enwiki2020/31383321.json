    "text": "The IEEE Pioneer Award in Nanotechnology is given by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Nanotechnology Council for research in nanotechnology. The main considerations for judging include distinction in long-term technical achievements, leadership, innovation, breadth, and impact on nanotechnology and engineering, recognizing individuals whose technical achievements go beyond the borders of a particular technical society. Nominees must be at least 10 years beyond their terminal degree. One or two Pioneer Awards are given each year; when two are awarded, there may be one for academics, and one for industry or government. The award consists of honorarium and a commemorative plaque. == Recipients == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year ! !Awardee !Institution !Scope of work |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2007 | |Mark Reed |Yale University |Molecular scale electronics |- | |Pallab Bhattacharya |University of Michigan |Quantum dot optoelectronic devices |- |2008 | |Sajeev John |University of Toronto |Photonic crystals |- |2009 | |Susumu Noda |Kyoto University |Photonic crystals and nanophotonics |- |2010 | |Phaedon Avouris |IBM T.J.
