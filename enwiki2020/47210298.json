    "text": "Fribourg & Treyer snuff 34 Haymarket Fribourg & Treyer was a British snuff manufacturer and retailer. It was founded by Mr Fribourg in 1720 at 34 Haymarket, London. They were famous for retailing Turkish tobacco. The business became Fribourg & Treyer, after the German-born Gottlieb Treyer married Mrs Martha Evans whose family had already entered into the business. They sold cigars and snuff and (from at least as early as 1852) cigarettes. In 1912 33 Haymarket was added to the premises when Burberry's relocated. Customers included David Garrick, King George IV, and Beau Brummell. The business closed in 1981. However, 34 Haymarket is a Grade II* listed building and the intact facade still exists. Nowadays, Wilsons of Sharrow, based in Sheffield, produces snuff under the F&T; brand. ==References== Category:Companies based in the City of Westminster Category:British companies established in 1720 Category:Tobacco companies of the United Kingdom Category:1720 establishments in England Category:1981 disestablishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 1981 ",
