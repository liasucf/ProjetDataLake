The oldest houses in the row were built in 1834. The row of houses was controversial in the history of urban planning in Reykjav\u00edk, as there heated disputes in the 1970s as to whether the row should be demolished or protected and restored. The row of houses was given heritage preservation status in 1979. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Reykjav\u00edk ",
