He is known for his work in sculpture and as a character artist in the various paint mediums, Cont\u00e9 crayon, pastel, and free-form sketch. ==Biography== He was born in Wetumka, Hughes County, Oklahoma, on July 17, 1910. When he was still a child, the family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he discovered his talent for art. He studied at the Minneapolis School of Arts (now known as the Minneapolis College of Art and Design). He worked as a Works Progress Administration artist for the Federal Art Project and taught art at the Harlem Community Art Center in New York City, where he was a noted contemporary, friend and partner of another famous African-American artist, Charles Alston, with whom he ran the Alston-Bannarn Harlem Art Workshop in Harlem/NYC, NY. He was intimately associated with the \"Harlem Renaissance\" of the 1930s, being considered as one of the movement's preeminent contributors. Although he is primarily known for his work in sculpture, he was equally skilled as a figurist and character artist in the various paint mediums, Cont\u00e9 crayon, pastel, free-form sketch, etc. In 1941, he returned to Minnesota and entered a piece of sculpture in the Minnesota State Fair sculpture competition, where he was awarded the first prize. The much-honored artist had won a painting prize at the fair a decade earlier as well, representing one of the earliest achievements by an African-American artist in that state's history.
