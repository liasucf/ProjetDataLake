She took part in a notable single-ship action in 1806. The Navy sold her in 1810. She then became a merchantman trading with the Mediterranean. She was lost c.1813. ==Capture== Haasje was a Dutch naval brig that captured on 2 August 1803 and sent into Saint Helena. She was 30 hours out of the Cape of Good Hope with dispatches for Batavia (Dutch East Indies) when she encountered the British. Captain-Lieutenant J. Ysbrands, her commander, initially refused to let Carolines boats come alongside and it was only after Caroline had fired at Hassje that she struck. By the time the British boarded Ysbrands had succeeded in throwing her dispatches overboard. She had been carrying eighteen 12-pounder carronades but had had to leave all but six at the Cape. ==Royal Navy service== In June 1804 the Royal Navy purchased Haasje and took her into service as the fireship HMS Phosphorus. She underwent fitting at Woolwich between 17 June and 11 September. Lieutenant John Heslop commissioned her in October, and Lieutenant William Tremlatt replaced him in January 1805. In August Lieutenant William J. Hughes assumed command. Lieutenant L.J. Reslop commanded Phosporus in 1805\u20131806. On 2 July 1806 Lieutenant William James Hughes assumed command. At daybreak on 14 August 1806 Phosphorus was eight leagues south of the Isle of Wight on her way to join the Channel fleet. She encountered a French privateer lugger pierced for 16 guns, mounting 12 guns, and full of men. The two vessels exchanged fire, resulting in one of Phosphoruss carronades being out of action. The Frenchman ran alongside at ten minutes past five and 70\u201380 men attempted to board. Phosphoruss 24 officers and men repelled the attack; after 45 minutes the lugger made sail and sailed off. Hughes attempted to give chase but could not catch up and so went into the Downs. Hughes and seven of his crew were wounded, one severely and one mortally. Later reports gave the lugger's name as Elize. His exploit earned Hughes the attention of the Duke of Kent and a letter of approbation from the Lords of the Admiralty. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded him a sword worth \u00a3100, and also \u00a3100 in money. Lastly, he received promotion to the rank of Commander on 25 September 1806. In 1807 Lieutenant R. D. Lancaster replaced Hughes. Phosphorus, , and shared in the prize money for the Danish ship , which they took on 19 August 1807, early in the Gunboat War between Britain and Denmark. Phosphorus shared with the hired armed cutter Active in the proceeds of the detention on 28 August of the Danish vessel Ferneijelsen. ===Disposal=== The \"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\" offered Phosphorus, lying at Sheerness, for sale on 24 March 1810. She sold on that day. ==Merchantman== Phosphorus became a merchantman. She first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) and the Register of Shipping (RS) in the 1811 volumes.
