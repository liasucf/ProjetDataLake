    "text": "The MV Agusta Superveloce is a retro racer styled motorcycle to produced by the Italian motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta in 2020. It is described by MV Agusta as \"a modern interpretation of the iconic stylistic concept of the MV Agusta. A fusion of vintage and contemporary ensures that the future incorporates the memories of good times gone by\". ==Background== Based on the F3 800, the Superveloce was first exhibited as a concept at the 2018 EICMA Show in Milan where it was awarded \"Most Beautiful Bike of the Show\u201d. MV Agusta were invited to exhibit the machine at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, where it won first prize in the \u201cConcept Bike: New Design and Prototype category presented by Independent Manufacturers and Designers\u201d class. Using the social network platform Instagram, MV Agusta announced on 19 May 2019 that the Superveloce would go into production in 2020. On 29 May they announced that pre-orders were being taken for the 300 Serie Oro production run, and by 26 June all 300, had been reserved. The first units were expected to go into production in March 2020. At the November 2019 EICMA Show two versions of the machine were unveiled: the limited edition Superveloce 800 Serie Oro which was almost indistinguishable from the concept bike and the full production Superveloce 800. MV Agusta also announced that production of the Superveloce had begun. ==Overview== Using the F3 800 Supersport as the base, MV design director, Adrian Morton, sought to give a modern take on the iconic MV three-cylinder GP machines of the 1960s and 70s as ridden to world championships by riders Giacomo Agostini and Phil Read. The livery of shock pearl red and Agostini silver reflects that classic era. An exclusive merchandising line will be available; including backpacks, jackets and helmets. ===Engine=== The 799 cc engine, originally designed by Ezio Mascheroni and first fitted to the F3, uses a DOHC inline three-cylinder layout with four valves per cylinder. A counter-rotating (reverse) crankshaft is used, which counteracts the centripetal forces of the wheels allowing the bike to turn faster. The bore and stroke are 79 mm and 54.3 mm. ===Electronics=== The machine uses a number of advanced technologies in the state of the art engine and vehicle control electronics; including ride by wire, multi-maps and traction control. A TFT dashboard is fitted, which has dedicated graphs and new functions. Headlight and tail light are large round items, adding to the retro-look, and are powered by LEDs. The headlight is an advanced twin-function full LED poly-ellipsoidal with a daytime running light. ===Cycle parts=== The tubular steel/aluminium frame is the same as the F3 800 as are the Marzocchi forks and Brembo brakes. A new rear sub-frame is fitted that allows changing the bike from a single seat to a dual seat if required. ==Model variants== ===Superveloce 800 Serie Oro=== The Superveloce 800 Serie Oro was the first of the model line to be announced and was limited to 300 units, all of which were reserved before production started. The bike uses carbon fibre for the bodywork, including the fairing, which reflects the style of the Ago era and has a yellow tinted screen. The lightweight bodywork contributes to the 381 lb (173 kg) dry weight. New six-spoke wheels are fitted. The machine uses a SC Projects 3-into-1-into-3 exhausts, two pipes exiting on the right and one on the left. This configuration is the same as on the classic MV GP machines. The exhaust boosts power to 153 bhp (115 kW). A leather strap is used to secure the petrol tank to the frame front and rear, and features a machined filler cap. ===Superveloce 800=== To bring the cost of the machine down, the full-production Superveloce 800 uses thermoplastic bodywork rather than the carbon fibre of the Serie Oro. Tank and wheels are from the F3. An exhaust similar to the F3 is used, with three overlapping pipes on the right side. As well as the \"Ago\" red and silver livery, a black/dark grey finish is available. Although developing the same 148 bhp (109 kW) as the F3, a different exhaust and revised engine mapping of the ECU give the machine better mid-range power. ==References== ==External links== * MV Agusta Official Website * * * Superveloce 800 Serie Oro Category:Sport bikes Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2020 ",
