    "text": "Monaco was represented by French singer Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, with the self-penned song '\"L'amour s'en va\", at the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 23 March in London. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster TMC. Some months earlier Hardy had broken onto the French music scene with the big hit \"Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles\" and came into the contest with a burgeoning reputation both for her great musical talent and up-to-the-minute trendy appearance, which would see her go on to become one of France's most influential and iconic musicians of the 1960s. As was also the case with Nana Mouskouri in the same contest, Hardy's Eurovision performance is credited with putting her unique style before a huge international audience. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Hardy performed 15th in the running order, following Belgium and preceding Luxembourg. Each national jury awarded 5-4-3-2-1 to their top five songs, and at the close \"L'amour s'en va\" had picked up 25 points (5 from France and Germany, 4 from Sweden, 3 from Italy, 2 from Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and 1 from Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia), placing Monaco joint 5th (with France) of the 16 entries. The Monegasque jury awarded its 5 points to Italy.ESC History - Monaco 1963 ==See also== *Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1963 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1963 Category:Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1963 in Monaco Category:Monaco stubs ",
