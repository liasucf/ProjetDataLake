The major features of the facility include: * Two training ovals, including one big enough to replicate every AFL ground and a GPS program that shows instantly where goal posts and markings can be moved to replicate other stadium dimensions * Indoor training centre with half a football oval marked across six basketball courts (also available for community use) * Aquatic recovery, hydrotherapy and pools area, an altitude chamber with sleeping area for players and an indoor running track * Club function centre and a retail outlet * Dedicated football department housing offices for the club's AFL/AFLW coaches and staff The Dockers moved into the facility in February 2017. == Awards == * Community Facility of the Year Award \u2014 2018 Parks and Leisure Australia Awards ==See also== * Cockburn Central == References == ==External links== * Official website * Cockburn ARC at fremantlefc.com.au Category:Fremantle Football Club Category:City of Cockburn Category:1895 establishments in Australia ",
