It is maintained by the Regional Arts & Culture Council. ==Description and history== Plaque for the sculpture Daddy Long Legs (2006) was designed by Mel Katz and installed along the Portland Transit Mall at the intersection of Southwest 6th Avenue and Stark in downtown Portland. Laser cutting was completed by BBC Steel in Canby, masking was executed by Aztec Sign and Graphics, and painting was done by Dura Industries, both based in Portland, respectively. The aluminum sculpture is flat but appears dimensional due to its painted interior shapes. The artist named the work Daddy Long Legs because of its \"elongated black shapes and welded base plates\", which are reminiscent of pant legs. ==Reception== The sculpture has been called \"colorful and modern\" and has been included in at least one published walking tour of Portland. ==See also== * 2006 in art ==References== ==External links== * Daddy Long Legs at the Public Art Archive Category:2006 establishments in Oregon Category:2006 sculptures Category:Aluminum sculptures in Oregon Category:Outdoor sculptures in Portland, Oregon Category:Sculptures on the MAX Green Line Category:Southwest Portland, Oregon ",
