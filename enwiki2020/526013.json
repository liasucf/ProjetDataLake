    "text": "The Karakash or Black Jade River, also spelled Karakax (, , \u049a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u049b\u0430\u0448 \u0414\u04d9\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0438), is a river in the Xinjiang autonomous region of the People's Republic of China that originates in the disputed Aksai Chin region administered by China. It passes through the historical settlement of Xaidulla (Shahidulla or Saitula) and passes by Khotan (Hotan) before joining the Tarim River. The lower course of the river is known as the Hotan River. == Course == The river begins above about northeast of Galwan Kangri peak in the disputed Aksai Chin region administered by China. It flows north to Sumnal (15,540 ft), then turns sharply eastwards (skirting just north of the Soda Plains of Aksai Chin) until just beyond Palong Karpo, when it turns sharply northwestwards, and crosses into Xinjiang proper. It flows past the towns of Sumgal, Fotash, Gulbashem, until it reaches Xaidulla (Shahidulla). The river then turns sharply northeastwards again near Xaidulla, and, after passing through Ali Nazar crosses the Kunlun mountain range near the Suget or Sanju Pass. It passes by east of Khotan, running parallel to the Yurungkash River, which it joins near Koxlax (some 200 km north of Khotan, ). From there it continues north as the Hotan River, which flows into the Tarim River. == History == The Karakash River is famous for its white and greenish jade (nephrite) carried as river boulders and pebbles toward Khotan, as does the nearby Yurungkash (or 'White Jade') River. This river jade originates from eroded mountain deposits of which the most famous one is near Gulbashen, in southwestern Xinjiang (formerly Chinese Turkestan). The Karakash Valley was also a caravan road for the north\u2013south trade between Yarkand (China) and Leh over the Karakoram Pass in Leh District of Ladakh. ==See also== *Keriya River * List of rivers in China *List of rivers in Asia *Indian subcontinent *Hindutash *Geography of Ladakh Category:Rivers of Xinjiang Category:Geography of Ladakh Category:Sites along the Silk Road Category:Aksai Chin ",
