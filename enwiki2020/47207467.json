    "text": "Goblins' Club is the fifty-fourth release and twenty-fourth main studio album by Tangerine Dream. Although sonically a counterweight to The Dream Mixes, it is usually considered the first album in the Millennium/TDI Years era due to the switch from Miramar, despite TDI not yet being the band's label. An Australian version lacked the track \"Elf June and the Midnight Patrol,\" co- written by Linda Spa, replacing it with \"Fort Worth Runway One\" by Edgar Froese. A 2004 re-release included both, but edited the final two tracks to fit on the disc. Goblins' Club marks the final appearance of Linda Spa as a regular group member until returning for Jeanne d'Arc (2005) ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ; Tangerine Dream * Edgar Froese * Jerome Froese * Linda Spa ;Guest musicians * Gerald Gradwohl * Mark Hornby ==Single== \"Towards The Evening Star\" was released as a promo CD. ==Remix== \"Towards The Evening Star\" was released in 1997 as a two track CD with a remix by The Orb. ==References== Category:1996 albums Category:Sequel Records albums Category:Tangerine Dream albums ",
