It was designated as a federal heritage site in 1990. == History == The station was built in 1924 to replace the original 1872 structure which served as the Trois-Rivier\u00e8s stop along the route connecting Qu\u00e9bec City and Montr\u00e9al via the North Shore of the St. Lawrence River. The station was acquired by Via Rail Canada in December 1985. In 1987 it became an intermodal station serving intercity bus traffic as well as trains. Passenger train service to Trois-Rivier\u00e8s ceased as a result of the 1990 Via Rail cuts, and bus service to the station ceased in 1998. The station is now owned by the City of Trois-Rivier\u00e8s and is used for purposes unrelated to transportation. ==References== == External links == * * Category:Transport in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Category:Buildings and structures in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Category:Railway stations in Mauricie Category:Designated Heritage Railway Stations in Quebec Category:Heritage sites in Mauricie Category:Disused railway stations in Canada Category:Railway stations in Canada opened in 1924 Category:Railway stations closed in 1990 Category:Railway stations in Quebec Category:1924 establishments in Quebec ",
