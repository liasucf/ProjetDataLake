    "text": "Fabian Lorenz Kowalik (April 22, 1908 in Falls City, Texas \u2013 August 14, 1954 in Karnes City, Texas), was a professional baseball pitcher. He played in the Major League Baseball from 1932 to 1936 for the Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Philadelphia Phillies, and Boston Bees. He pitched for the Cubs in the 1935 World Series, despite only playing 20 regular season games. His sole appearance came in Game 2, pitching 4\u2153 innings and giving up one unearned run, as well as scoring a single in the 7th inning. After getting married in February 1936, Kowalik arrived at spring training for the 1936 season out of shape. After recording an 0-2 record in six games, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on the 21st of May. His season didn't improve - Kowalik posted an 1-5 record and an ERA of 5.38 in twenty-two games. Placed on waivers, Kowalik was picked up by the Atlanta Braves on the 6th of September, and played his last MLB game against his old team, the Phillies, on the 27th of September. Replacing Hal Lee in left field, Kowalik hit an RBI single in a 4-3 loss. Kowalik played in the minors from 1937 to 1940, retiring due to persistent arm injuries and lack of form. ==References== ==External links== Category:1908 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Boston Bees players Category:People from Karnes County, Texas Category:People from Karnes City, Texas ",
