The underlying reason for the tax was to inflict financial ruin on the minority non-Muslim citizens of the country,\"In reality, the idea was to reduce the influence of the minority non-Turkish citizens to the country's affairs.\" end their prominence in the country's economy\"These quotations reveal that the real reason for the Wealth Tax was the elimination of non- Muslims from the economy.\"\"However, the underlying reason was the elimination of minorities from the economy, and the replacement of the non-Muslim bourgeoisie by its Turkish counterpart.\"\"... an attempt was being made by means of the Wealth Tax to eliminate the minorities who occupied an important place in Turkey's commercial life.\"\"The first visible attempt in order to remove minorities from economic life was the implementation of 'Wealth Tax' in 1942 which was accepted in the National Assembly with the claim of balancing and distributing properties of minorities. The actual aim behind the scenes was to impoverish the non-Muslim minorities and eliminate them from the competition in the national economy. Instead, the RPP government tried to create a new wealthy Turkish Muslim bourgeoisie.\"\"With the introduction of the Varlik Vergisi (capital tax) in 1942, which aimed to confiscate the property and assets of non-Muslims, an attempt was made to bring the national economy also under the control of Muslim citizens.\"\"The aim was to destroy the economic and cultural base of these minorities, loot their properties and means of livelihood, and, at the same time \"turkify\" the economy of Turkey.\"\"That tax was instrumental in transferring the control of the market from the non-Muslim groups to the Muslims.\"\"Varlik Vergisi is commonly translated as \"Capital Tax\" or \"Wealth Tax\" we might, however, consider an alternate translation of varlik as \"presence\" which focuses attention on the devaluation- both financial and political of minority presence during this time\"\"... We will use it to eliminate the foreigners who control the market and hand the Turkish market over the Turks.\" \"The foreigners to be eliminated\" referred primarily to the non-Muslims citizens of Turkey.\" and transfer the assets of non-Muslims to the Muslim bourgeoisie.\u015eakir Din\u00e7\u015fahin, Stephen Goodwin, \"Towards an Encompassing Perspective on Nationalism: The Case of Jews in Turkey during Second World War, 1939-1945\" It was a discriminatory measure which taxed non-Muslims up to ten times heavier and resulted to a significant amount of wealth and property to be transferred to Muslims. It was the last enforcement of the jizya tax on non-Muslims in Turkish history, and the only such application after the establishment of the constitutionally secular Turkish Republic in 1923; breaching the articles regarding secularism and citizen equality in the Turkish Constitution. ==Background== Faz\u0131l Ahmet Ayka\u00e7, one of the proposers of the Varl\u0131k Vergisi. Ne\u015fet \u00d6zercan, one of the opposers of the tax. Non-Muslims auctioning off their furniture to pay for the tax.The bill for the one-off tax was proposed by the \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu government, and the act was adopted by the Turkish parliament on November 11, 1942. It was imposed on the fixed assets, such as landed estates, building owners, real estate brokers, businesses, and industrial enterprises of all citizens, but especially targeted the minorities. Those who suffered most severely were non-Muslims like the Jews, Greeks, Armenians, and Levantines,\"Those mmainly afflicted were the Greeks, Jews, Armenians, and, to some extent, foreign-passport Levantine families.\" who controlled a large portion of the economy, though it was the Armenians who were most heavily taxed. The tax was supposed to be paid by all citizens of Turkey, but inordinately higher rates were imposed on the country's non-Muslim inhabitants, in an arbitrary and predatory way. Because those forced to pay the bulk of the taxes were exclusively non-Muslims, the law was perceived by the public as a \"jizya - gavur tax\" against them.\"They were almost exclusively non-Muslims. The law was thus perceived by the public as a \"punitive measure\" against non-Muslims.\".\" These taxes led to the destruction of the remaining non-Muslim merchant class in Turkey,\"But in its application it differentiated between Muslim and non-Muslim taxpayers, and levied far heavier taxes on non- Muslims, leading to the destruction of the remaining non-Muslim merchant class in Turkey.\"\"Further, the Varlik Vergisi, an excessive tax instituted during World War II, pilfered small Jewish (and other minority) businesses to the point of bankruptcy\"\"Due to the law, most non-Muslim merchants sold their properties and vanished from the markets.\" the lives and finances of many non- Muslim families were ruined.\"As a consequence of Varl\u0131k Vergisi and the labour camps, the lives and finances of many non-Muslim families were ruined.\"\"..., by the time that tax was abolished the major Greek, Armenian and Jewish merchant figures were shaken and dislocated.\" The taxes were very high, some times higher than a person's entire wealth. In addition, the law was also applied to the many poor non-Muslims such as drivers, workers and even beggars, whereas their Muslim counterparts were not obliged to pay any tax.\"The law was also applied to the many poor non-Muslims (numbering 26,000) such as drivers, workers and even beggars, whereas their Muslim counterparts were not obliged to pay any tax.\" The Varl\u0131k Vergisi resulted in a number of suicides of ethnic minority citizens in Istanbul.\"The Varl\u0131k resulted in a number of suicides of ethnic minority citizens in Istanbul, indeed, I saw one myself.

Officially, the tax was devised to fill the state treasury that would have been needed had Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union invaded the country. However, the main reason for the tax was to nationalize the Turkish economy by reducing minority populations' influence and control over the country's trade, finance, and industries. The tax could not be challenged in court. Non-Muslims had to pay their taxes within 15 days in cash.\"In addition, the non-Muslims were required to pay their taxes in cash within 15 days.\" Many people who could not pay the taxes borrowed money from relatives and friends, also sold their properties at public auctions or sold their businesses to gather some money to pay.\"The property of individuals who could not raise their assessments was sold at public auctions,...\"\"..as a result they had to sell their businesses or property to Muslim businessmen at low prices to cover the bill.\" People who were unable to pay were sent to labor camps in eastern Anatolia.\"..., and those unable to pay were packed off to a camp at Askale, near Erzerum - an area cooler than Moscow in the winter - where they were put to work breaking stones.\"\"The Askale victims were later sent south to a camp in the Tigris Valley.\"\"..., and if the sale failed to produce the required amount, the owners were sent to forced labor camps run by the Ministry of Public Works.\"\"Those unable to pay had to work off their debt in labour camps in Askale, in eastern Turkey.\" Workers were paid for their service but half of their wages were set-off for their debts. Because of the hard plowing work elder obligors conspired with young villagers from A\u015fkale to make them work instead and they paid villagers daily wages in return.\"Ya\u015fl\u0131lar, Kop ge\u00e7idinde kar temizleme i\u015finin a\u011f\u0131rl\u0131\u011f\u0131ndan dolay\u0131 A\u015fkaleli k\u00f6yl\u00fclerden baz\u0131lar\u0131 ile anla\u015farak kendi yerlerine gen\u00e7leri \u00e7al\u0131\u015fmaya g\u00f6ndermi\u015fler, bunun kar\u015f\u0131l\u0131\u011f\u0131nda da onlara g\u00fcnl\u00fck \u00f6deme yapm\u0131\u015flard\u0131r.\" Five thousand were sent there and all were non-Muslims,\"Out of 40,000 tax debtors, about 5,000 were sent to these camps, and all of these were members of non- Muslim communities.\" since the Muslim taxpayers who failed to pay received lighter sentences.\"Muslims taxpayers who failed to pay in full received lighter sentences.\" Also, there were easiness for payments and tax discounts for the Muslims taxpayers. Although the law stipulated that people over fifty- five years old were exempt from labor service, elderly men, even sick people were sent there.\"Although the law stipulated that people over fifty-five years old were exempt from labor service, seventy-five and eighty year old men and even sick people were dragged to the train station and deported.\" Twenty-one of the people who were sent to the labor camps died there\"Twenty-one people died in these camps.\" and the Turkish government usurped their wealth and sold it to Turkish Muslims at extremely low prices, paving the way to the creation of some of the contemporary Turkish conglomerates.\"Unfortunately, 21 people died in these camps and the government usurped their wealth and sold it to Turkish Muslims at low prices.\" The state also confiscated the property of the taxed person's close relatives (including parents, parents-in-law, children, and siblings) and sold it to settle the tax amount, even if the person had been forced into labor service.\"The law empowered the state to confiscate the property of the taxed person's closed relatives (including parents, parents- in-law, children, and siblings) and to sell it to settle the tax amount, even if the person had been forced into labor service.\" Foreign-passport residents in Turkey who gave in a tax return or owned a business were forced to pay a huge capital levy on supposed wealth too. However, none of them were ruined or committed suicide. The tax was not based on any reality, but just on a whim of the authorities.\"No foreign-passport residents in Turkey were ruined or committed suicide. However, every foreigner who gave in a tax-return, or owned a business, was forced to pay a huge capital levy on supposed wealth. The tax was not based on any reality, but just on a whim of the Authorities.\" This provoked the intervention of foreign embassies and consulates on behalf of their nationals.\"This provoked the intervention of foreign embassies and consulates on behalf of their nationals.\" Taxpayers were classified into four separate lists, the \"M\" list, for Muslims, the \"G\", for non-Muslims (Gayrimuslim), the \"E\", for Foreigners (Ecnebi) and the \"D\" for converts (D\u00f6nme).\"Taxpayers were classified into two separate lists, the M list, for Muslims, the G, for non-Muslims (Gayrimuslim). Later, two other categories were added, E, for Foreigners (Ecnebi) and the D for converts (D\u00f6nme), i.e., members of the Sabetaist sect of Jewish converts to Islam.\" The rigidly- enforced, discriminatory law did not yield the results the government had hoped for. Companies increased the prices of their products sharply to recoup their losses, creating a spiral of inflation that ruined low-income consumers. However, according to official information, the Turkish government collected 324 million liras (at a time when 1 US dollar was equivalent to 1.20 Turkish lira) through the confiscation of non-Muslim assets. This amount would be equivalent to more than $4 billion today. According to Faik \u00d6kte, the director of finance for the province of Istanbul at the time of the Varl\u0131k Vergisi, the Turkish government collected 289,256,246 liras from non-Muslim minorities, 34,226,764 liras from d\u00f6nme and 25,600,409 liras from Muslims. According to T.C. Resmi Gazete, the official journal of Turkey that publishes the new legislation and other official announcements, the Varl\u0131k Vergisi (Law #4305) was not applied to any particular ethnic or religious communities.http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/anayasa/anayasa_2011.pdf MADDE 10- Herkes, dil, \u0131rk, renk, cinsiyet, siyas\u00ee d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnce, felsef\u00ee inan\u00e7, din, mezhep ve benzeri sebeplerle ay\u0131r\u0131m g\u00f6zetilmeksizin kanun \u00f6n\u00fcnde e\u015fittir. Tax tariffs were determined one by one for every business sector. According to the T.C. Resmi Gazete, the tax tariff of 4.94% was for the large-scale farmers, and not limited to any particular religious community. It was also indicated that the tariff for the large-scale farmers could not exceed 5%.http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/arsiv/5255.pdf Madde 2B) B\u00fcy\u00fck \u00e7ift\u00e7iler (B\u00fcy\u00fck \u00e7ift\u00e7iden maksat, i\u015finin idaresine ve v\u00fcsatine halel getirmeksizin bu m\u00fckellefiyeti ifa edebilecekleri bu kanunda yaz\u0131l\u0131 komisyonlarca tesbit edilenlerdir)' .

During the period, the Turkish press allegedly had \"anti-minority\" articles and reports.\"One or two weeks after the Wealth Tax lists were displayed, the attitude of the press began to harden further. The \"anti-minority\" attitude of the news reporting and leading articles that appeared to the press became more pronounced. In particular, during the process of levying distress and sending taxpayers to Askale, anti-minority sentiment reached its zenith.\"\"The newspapers depicted individual black marketers or suspected \"usurers\" as \"parasites of the Turkish people\"; those explicitly named were always non- Muslims.\"\"Although the smear campaign was directed against non-Muslim minorities in general, it was mostly Jews who were specifically targeted by articles and caricatures, which employed stereotypical anti-Semitic tropes. ==Repeal and aftermath== The law could not sustain relentless international criticism. Under pressure from the United Kingdom and the United States, it was repealed on 15 March 1944.\"The Wealth Tax was withdrawn in March 1944, under the pressure of criticism from Britain and the United States\" After the abolition of the law, the minority citizens who were at the labour camps were sent back to their homes.\"Minority citizens still in the camps were sent back to their homes.\" The Turkish government promised to give back the paid taxes to non-Muslims, but this did not happen.\"Although the RPP government promised to give back the paid taxes to non-Muslims, it did not happen.\" The opposition Democratic Party (DP) capitalized on its unpopularity in the general election of 1950, which was the first democratic general election in the Turkish Republic, thereby achieving a landslide victory against the Republican People's Party (CHP). These taxes brought about a permanent demographic change within the minority population. Many people of the minorities, especially the Greek minority, felt that there was no future for them in Turkey and they left their ancestral homes and became refugees in Greece. On the other hand, some, especially from the Jewish community had managed to secrete assets abroad and they were able to restart a reduced and hesitant life in Turkey.\"The Varl\u0131k Vergisi brought about a permanent demographic change within the minority population. Many (especially the Greek minority) felt that there was no future for them in Turkey, and they left their ancestral homes and became refugees in Greece. On the other hand, some, especially within the Jewish community had managed to secrete assets abroad and they were able to re-start a reduced and hesitant life in Turkey, being careful to abstain from displaying any sign of affluence.\" The tax also resulted in state confiscation of much minority property in Istanbul, \"Turkifying\" not only the economy but also the landscape.\"The tax resulted in state confiscation of much minority property in Istanbul, Turkifying not only the city's economy but also its landscape\". The 1935 Census records non-Muslims as 1.98% of the population; by 1945, this had fallen to 1.54%. In addition, the Varl\u0131k Vergisi once more demonstrated that being Muslim constituted a significant part of the definition of citizenship in Turkey.\"The Wealth Tax once more demonstrated that being Muslim constituted a significant part of the definition of citizenship in Turkey.\" The Varl\u0131k Vergisi in the way it was dealt with by the Turkish Press exemplifies the close relations between the Executive and the Press, in Turkey.\"The Capital Tax in the way it was dealt with by the Turkish Press exemplifies exactly the close relations between these two Powers, the Executive and the Press, in World War II Turkey.\" Furthermore, the tax made small businesses to close or sell their properties and stock to large operators, leaving the market under the control of big business interests. In 1951, Faik \u00d6kte published his memoirs. There he confessed that the tax had been applied in discriminatory way against the non-Mulsims. The Turkish press condemned him for publishing this and declared him \"traitor to the homeland\". Years after the introduction of the Varl\u0131k Vergisi, the political elite of Turkey had difficulties coming to terms with the subject. The historical novel Salk\u0131m Han\u0131m'\u0131n Taneleri (variously translated as Mrs. Salk\u0131m's Diamonds/Pearls/Beads/Necklace), written by Turkish author Yilmaz Karakoyunlu, recounts stories and witnesses of the non-Muslims during the Varl\u0131k Vergisi. The novel was soon turned into a film of the same name, Mrs. Salk\u0131m's Diamonds. Members of parliament, such as Ahmet \u00c7akar (MHP), were outraged at the screening. ==See also== *Taxation of the Jews in Europe for other types of taxes imposed on the Jews *Jizya *Dhimmi *Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey *Istanbul pogrom (1955) *Mrs. Salk\u0131m's Diamonds (movie) *Racism in Turkey *The Twenty Classes *\u0130brahim S\u00fcreyya Yi\u011fit ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * Category:Anti- Armenianism in Turkey Category:Antisemitism in Turkey Category:Discrimination in Turkey Category:Greeks in Turkey Category:History of the Republic of Turkey Category:Taxation in Turkey Category:Turkish words and phrases Category:1942 in Turkey Category:Economic history of Turkey Category:Persecution of Christians in Turkey ",
