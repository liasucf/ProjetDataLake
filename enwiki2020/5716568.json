According to the PEK Report, results of the evaluation were inconclusive, and in June 2005, the five complementary therapies under evaluation - anthroposophical medicine, homeopathy, neural therapy, phytotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine (more precisely, traditional Chinese herbal therapy) - were removed from the list of services covered by the compulsory health insurance scheme (KLV). ==Summary of the PEK Report== The complete text of the 24 April 2005 version of the \"Programm Evaluation Komplement\u00e4rmedizin\" Report, (also referred to as PEK, \"Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine\" and \"Complementary Medicine Evaluation Programme\"), is available from the Swiss Parliament websiteComplete text of the official PEK report.

(In German and French.)

These five services were only eligible for reimbursement if they were provided by physicians who had the relevant proficiency certificates, issued by the Swiss Medical Association (FMH). The decision on whether these complementary methods would be retained within the basic health insurance scheme was to be based on their efficacy, appropriateness and cost-effectiveness being demonstrated. To this end, the Complementary Medicine Evaluation Programme (PEK) was carried out from 1998 to 2005. ===Design of the PEK=== A basic procedure was defined, comprising two parts. In Part 1 (evaluation of the provision of complementary medicine for patients in Switzerland), empirical studies were to be carried out, permitting conclusions as to: :a) how prevalent the five therapies are in Switzerland, :b) which physicians offer these therapies, :c) which patients have recourse to them, :d) what results are achieved with these treatments, and :e) what impact these therapies have on costs. For points b), c), and e), comparisons were made with conventional medicine. On account of methodological and time- related problems, however, point d) could not be evaluated. In Part 2 (literature analysis), the literature available internationally on efficacy, appropriateness (here primarily defined in terms of safety and utilization) and cost-effectiveness was to be systematically compiled and reviewed. ===Outcomes=== Part 1 was carried out by a team from the Panmedion Foundation, a pro-CAM think tank. The results were not published in the peer-reviewed literature but an expanded version was separately published an translation as \"Homeopathy in Healthcare: Effectiveness, Appropriateness, Safety, Costs\".

The terms-of-reference for the PEK study stated that the results of the study would determine which complementary medicines, if any, would continue to be supported by the national insurance program in Switzerland. However, before the study was completed and the final draft report reviewed by the international Review Board, the government announced that it would withdraw support for all complementary approaches to medicine.Unipublic Zurich University.
