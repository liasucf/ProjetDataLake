    "text": "Greg Smith (born 1970) is an American interdisciplinary artist based in Brooklyn, New York whose practice consists of installation art, sculpture, and video. ==Early life and education== Smith was born in DeKalb, Illinois in 1970. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Amherst College in 1993, a Doctor of Philosophy in Physics from Harvard University in 2000, and a Master of Fine Arts from Hunter College in 2005. ==Career and work== Greg Smith stages exhibitions that often include a combination of installation art, sculpture, and video. John Yau, in an article for Hyperallergic, described Smith as \u201can absurdist inventor, a performer attracted to risk, a scientist (he did get a PhD in Physics from Harvard, by the way), an analytical storyteller who refuses to settle for easy parodies, and, perhaps most importantly, an artist who is too self-respectful to take shortcuts or feints.\u201d Reviews of his work have also appeared in The New York Times, New York Magazine, Paper, The Brooklyn Rail, Hyperallergic, and Studio International. Smith has exhibited widely with solo shows at the Museum of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg; the McNay Art Museum, San Antonio; Cress Gallery of Art at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga; and the Faulconer Gallery at Grinnell College, Iowa. He has also participated in group exhibitions at national institutions such as the John Michael Kohler Arts Center, Sheboygan; Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; Weatherspoon Art Museum, Greensboro; and, the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art in Peekskill, New York. Screenings of the artist's video works have been held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and Galapagos Art Space in Brooklyn, New York. Greg Smith is represented by Susan Inglett Gallery, NYC. ==References== ==External links== *\u201cGreg Smith- John Simone Guggenheim Fellow Profile\" Category:1976 births Category:Artists from New York City Category:People from DeKalb, Illinois Category:Amherst College alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Hunter College alumni Category:Interdisciplinary artists Category:Living people ",
