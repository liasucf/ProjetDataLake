His real surname was Italian and too hard to pronounce, so he took a stage name, Cravat, from a character in a play he had seen and liked.http://www.tinacuccia.com/nickcravat.html ==Career== Cravat and Burt Lancaster met as youngsters at a summer camp in New York and became lifelong friends. They created an acrobatic act called Lang and Cravat in the early 1930s, and joined the Kay Brothers circus in Florida. The pair worked at various circuses and in vaudeville. In 1939, Lancaster suffered a hand injury that ended their act. They would later reunite.

He played a mute character in several films such as The Flame and the Arrow, The Crimson Pirate, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier (1955), and the TV series The Count of Monte Cristo, mostly because his thick Brooklyn accent would have been out of place. He also played the \"gremlin\" on the wing of an airplane in the 1963 Twilight Zone episode \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\". ==Personal life== Cravat's first wife, Arlene, died in the 1950s He had two daughters from his second and final marriage, Marcelina \"Marcy\" Cravat-Overway and Christina \"Tina\" Cravat, who also goes by the name Tina Cuccia.
