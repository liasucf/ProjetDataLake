Based on a true story of the Sino-Japanese war involving Japanese war hero Kojir\u014d Nishizumi, it served as propaganda, instructing its audience in the correct way to endure loss without despair. To make the film, Yoshimura toured the actual battlefields in China. ==Reception== Cinema theorist Kate Taylor-Jones suggests that along with films like Mud and Soldiers and Chocolate and Soldiers, The Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi provided \"a vision of the noble, obedient and honourable Japanese army fighting to defend the emperor and Japan.\" ==References== Category:1940 films Category:Japanese war films Category:Japanese propaganda films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:1940s war films Category:Japanese black-and-white films ",
