    "text": "Cantonese Internet Slang () is an informal language originating from Internet forums, chat rooms, and other social platforms.

Cantonese Internet Slang is prevalent among young Cantonese speakers and offers a reflection of the youth culture of Hong Kong. ==Advantages== * Save time and ease communication * Able to type faster with shorter sentences or letters * Helps create a sense of identity or bonding in online communities * Becomes a medium for expressing their own ideas and an indication of memberships among Cantonese-speakers ==Disadvantages== * Negatively affect Hong Kong students' usage of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure in Chinese composition * Students believe that it is acceptable to make serious grammatical errors and use informal Chinese vocabulary in formal writing. * Student Chinese compositions are often filled with casual phrases and slang from Internet forums. ==Characteristics== * Code-switching :The Cantonese-English code-switching is the insertion of isolated English words into a Cantonese Chinese syntactic frame. It can save time by adding a shorter English word or expression into a Cantonese Chinese sentence without distorting the original meaning. * Abbreviations :Abbreviation is the shortened form of a word used for saving time, enhancing playfulness and acting more like speech. People can share the same codes of language and thus it fosters a sense of peer-group feeling. * Rebus Writing :Symbols or words are used to represent another word that is similar in sound, regardless of the original meaning of the symbols.
