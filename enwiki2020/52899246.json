    "text": "Pit-os is a mountainous barangay located in the north-western part of Cebu City bordering Pulangbato to the northwest and southwest, Bacayan to the southeast, Cabangahan, Consolacion in the east and Agsungot to the north. In this area, the Butuanon River forms most boundaries between barangays such as those between Bacayan and San Jose, and Pit-os and Pulangbato although there is a small part of Pit-os in which the border goes across the Butuanon River and cuts off Pulangbato which covers most of the lower portion of Metropolis subdivision and curves back to the Butuanon River. The border here between Pulangbato is formed by a small hill within Metropolis. ==Infrastructure== ===Transportation=== Pit-os is the northern terminus for 3 jeepney routes. Although one route continues on to Guba, most Cebu City routes that go this far north terminate here. It is served by the 62C, 62B, 13H and 24D routes with one jeepney on each route every 5\u20136 minutes. ===Roads=== A. Mi\u00f1oza Street, the main road in this area, is a heavily congested two lane road. There are plans to widen it into a 4 lane road but due to the constrained space, only a few short sections have been widened and are currently used for parking purposes due to the road not being repainted. A few meters from the centre of the barangay is an unnamed road which leads to Consolacion which is meant to be used as an alternate route is desolate except for the residents using it due to the steepness of the road and notoriety for accidents on the uphill curve leading to A. Mi\u00f1oza Street. ==Education== The barangay is served by the Pit-os Elementary School and the Pit-os National High School which has both day and night classes. There are also 2 private schools in Pit-os, the Cebu International School and SCI. == References == ==External links== * , www.cebucity.gov.ph, 30 April 2015 * , nap.psa.gov.ph Category:Barangays of Cebu Category:Cebu City ",
