    "text": "Sultan Bahu (; also spelled Bahoo; ca 1630\u20131691) was a Sufi mystic, poet, and scholar active during the Mughal empire mostly in the Punjab region (present- day Pakistan). He belonged to Qadiri Sufi order, and founded the mystic tradition known as Sarwari Qadiri. Little is known about Bahu's life, other than what is written in a hagiography called Manaqib-i Sultani, which was written by one of Bahu's descendants seven generations after Bahu's own time. Sultan Bahu's father was Bayazid Muhammad, who was an Army Officer in the Mughal Army. Sultan Bahu was born in Shorekot, Jhang, in the current Punjab Province of Pakistan. He belonged to Awan Tribe. More than forty books on Sufism are attributed to him (mostly written in Persian), largely dealing with specialised aspects of Islam and Islamic mysticism. He lived during the reigns of Mughal emperors Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb in the 17th century. However, it was his Punjabi poetry which had popular appeal and earned him lasting fame. His verses are sung in many genres of Sufi music, including qawwali and kafi, and tradition has established a unique style of singing his couplets. ==Education== Sultan Bahu's first teacher was his mother, Mai Rasti. She pushed him to seek spiritual guidance from Shah Habib Gilani. Around 1668, Sultan Bahu moved to Delhi for further training under the guidance of Syed Abdul Rehman Jilani Dehlvi, a notable Sufi saint of the Qadiriyya order, and thereafter returned to Punjab where he spent the rest of his life. ==Literary works== The exact number of books written by Sultan Bahu is not known, but it is assumed to be at least one hundred. Forty of them are on Sufism and Islamic mysticism. Most of his writings are in the Persian language except Abyat-e- Bahoo which is written in Punjabi verse.Sultan Hamid Ali,\"Manaqib-i Sultani\" Malik Chanan Din Publishers (Regd) Lahore Pakistan 1956 Only the following books written by Sultan Bahu can be found today: * Abyat e Bahu (1967) * Risala e Ruhi * Sultan ul Waham * Nur ul Huda * Aql e Baidar * Mahq ul Faqr * Aurang e Shahi * Jami ul Israr * Taufiq e Hidiyat * Kalid Tauheed * Ain ul Faqr * Israr e Qadri (1908)Sultan Bahu books on Rekhta.org website Retrieved 18 May 2020 * Kaleed e Jannat * Muhqam ul Faqr * Majalis un Nabi * Muftah ul Arifeen * Hujjat ul Israr * Kashf ul Israar * Mahabat ul Israr * Ganj ul Israr * Fazl ul Liqa * Dewaan e Bahu == Spiritual lineage == In his writings, Sultan Bahu refers to Abdul Qadir Jilani as his spiritual master, even though Jilani died long before the birth of Sultan Bahu. However, most Sufis maintain that Abdul Qadir Jilani plays a special role in the mystic world and that all orders and saints are forever indebted to him in some way either directly or indirectly. While acknowledging that he is a follower of Jilani's Qadiriyya tradition, Sultan Bahu initiated an offshoot of his own which he named Sarwari Qadiri. The Awan tribe of Pakistan claim he belonged to the Alvi Awan tribe.Encyclopaedia of Untouchables Ancient, Medieval and Modern - Raj Kumar - Google BooksUrs of Sultan Bahu begins The News International (newspaper), Published 2 September 2019, Retrieved 18 May 2020 Bahu's Sarwari Qadiri tradition (or Sufi order) is similar in its overall philosophy to the Qadiri order. Unlike many other Sufi orders, the Sarwari Qadiri tradition does not prescribe a specific dress code, ascetic practices, breathing exercises, etc. Instead, it focuses on practicing mental exercises, an important one, being the visualisation of the word \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 (Allah, God) as written on one's own heart. According to tradition, the lineage reaches Sultan Bahu as follows: # Muhammad # Ali ibn Abi Talib # Hasan al Basri # Habib al Ajami # Dawud Tai # Maruf Karkhi # Sirri Saqti # Junaid Baghdadi # Abu Bakr Shibli # Abdul Aziz bin Hars bin Asad Yemeni Tamimi # Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi # Mohammad Yousaf Abu al-Farah Tartusi # Abu-al-Hassan Ali Bin Mohammad Qureshi Hankari # Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi # Abdul Qadir Jilani # Abdul Razzaq Jilani # Abdul Jabbar Jilani # Syed Mohammad Sadiq Yahya # Najm-ud-Din Burhan Puri # Abdul Fattah # Abdul Sattar # Abdul Baqqa # Abdul Jaleel #Syed Abdul Rehman Jilani Dehlvi # Sultan Bahu The Sultan Bahu tradition is still practiced to this day by Sultan Bahu's successors. ==Shrine== Shrine of Sultan Bahu near Jhang, Pakistan The shrine of Sultan Bahu is located in Garh Maharaja, Punjab. It was originally built on Bahu's gravesite until the Chenab River changed its course causing the need to relocate twice and as witnessed by those present at the time of relocation, claimed that his body was, in fact, still intact at the time. It is a popular Sufi shrine, and the annual Urs festival commemorating his death is celebrated there with great fervor on the first Thursday of Jumada al-Thani month. People come from far-off places to join the celebrations.Book Name: Tareekh-e-Jhang, Author: Iqbal Zuberi, Publisher: Jhang Adibi Academy, Jhang Sadar, Pakistan, First Edition, Date: 2002 Sultan Bahu also used to hold an annual Urs to commemorate the martyrs of Karbala from the 1st to the 10th day of the month of Muharram. This tradition continues to this day and every year, thousands of pilgrims visit the shrine during the first 10 days of Muharram. ==See also== *List of famous Sufis *Sufism in Pakistan ==References== Category:Indian Sufi saints Category:Sufi poets Category:1630 births Category:1691 deaths Category:Persian-language poets Category:Punjabi-language poets Category:Punjabi Sufi saints Category:17th-century Indian poets Category:17th-century Islamic religious leaders Category:17th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Sufi shrines in Pakistan Category:Mystic poets ",
