    "text": "\"Abraham, Martin and John\" is a 1968 song written by Dick Holler and first recorded by Dion. It is a tribute to the memory of four assassinated Americans, all icons of social change: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy. It was written in response to the assassination of King and that of Robert Kennedy in April and June 1968, respectively. ==Lyrics== Each of the first three verses features one of the men named in the song's title, for example: :Anybody here, seen my old friend Abraham? :Can you tell me where he's gone? :He freed a lot of people, but it seems the good, they die young :You know I just looked around and he's gone After a bridge, the fourth and final verse mentions Robert \"Bobby\" Kennedy, and ends with a description of him walking over a hill with the other three men. ==Dion recording== The original version, recorded by Dion, featured a gentle folk rock production from Phil Gernhard and arrangement from John Abbott. The feeling of the song is set with a gentle English horn and violin opening then featuring harp flourishes at multiple points, including the instrumental conclusion. The song also features a flugelhorn, an electric organ, bass, and drums. Dion felt during post production that the song needed more depth and added a track featuring him playing classical guitar notably at the bridge, lead ins, and the close. Although it was quite unlike the rock sound that Dion had become famous for in the early 1960s, and even more unlike Holler and Gernhard's previous collaboration in the 1966 novelty smash \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\", \"Abraham, Martin and John\" nonetheless was a major American hit single in late 1968. It reached #4 on the U.S. pop singles chart and was awarded an RIAA gold record for selling a million copies. In Canada, it topped the charts, reaching #1 in the RPM 100 on November 25, 1968. In 2001 this recording would be ranked number 248 on the RIAA's Songs of the Century list. The record was also popular with adult listeners, reaching #8 on Billboard's Easy Listening survey. The personnel on the original recording included Vinnie Bell and Ralph Casale on guitar, Nick DeCaro on organ, David Robinson on drums, Gloria Agostini on harp, and George Marge on oboe and English horn. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1968\u201369) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Canada RPM 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand (Listener) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|12 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-2002 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard R&B; | style=\"text-align:center;\"|32 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1968) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|91 |- |US (Joel Whitburn's Pop Annual) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|43 |} ==Later recordings and performances== * Smokey Robinson & the Miracles recorded a version that became an American Top 40 single in 1969, reaching #33Whitburn, Joel The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, Billboard Books, New York, 1992, p. 317 while reaching #16 on the US R&B; chartsWhitburn, Joel, The Billboard Book of TOP 40 R&B; and Hip Hop Hits, Billboard Books, New York 2006, p. 400 * Marvin Gaye recorded a version that became a top-ten hit (#9) in the United Kingdom in 1970 (Gaye's version was never released in the U.S. as a single but was featured on his 1970 album, That's the Way Love Is, and was one of his first experiments with social messages in his music which would culminate in his 1971 album, What's Going On.) * Moms Mabley, best known as a comedian, performed a completely serious version that hit the U.S. Top 40, reaching #35 in 1969Whitburn, Joel, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, Billboard Books, New York, 1992 p. 287 and #18 on the R&B; chartsWhitburn, Joel, The Billboard Book of Top 40 R&B; and Hip Hop Hits, Billboard Books, New York, 2006, p. 363 * Ray Charles recorded his version of the song on his 1972 album A Message from the People. * Marillion released two versions in 1999.
