It is housed in the former Palais des beaux-arts de Li\u00e8ge, built in the Parc de la Boverie for the Li\u00e8ge International in 1905. The building previously housed the prints and drawings collections (1952-1980) of the city's Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts and the Walloon art collections of the city's Acad\u00e9mie royale des beaux-arts (1970s-1980), before becoming the Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne (later known as the Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain or MMAC) from 1980 to 2011. MMAC was merged with the prints, drawings and Walloon collections in 2011 to form a new single collection known as the 'mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts'. ==Sources== *http://www.laboverie.com/ == References == Boverie Boverie ",
