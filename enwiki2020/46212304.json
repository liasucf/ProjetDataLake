    "text": "The Bahmani family, also Bahmani-Qajar is an aristocratic Persian family belonging to one of the princely families of the Qajar dynasty, the ruling house that reigned Iran 1785\u20131925. The founder is Bahman Mirza Qajar (1810\u20131884), younger brother of Mohammad Shah Qajar and formerly prince regent and governor of Azerbaijan 1841\u20131848. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the family was divided into a Russian branch, serving the Tsar, and recognised in 1886 with the titles of Prince Persidskii and Princess Persidskaya styled \"His Serene Highness\" in the Russian Empire by the Tsar. As well as into a Persian branch in Tehran at the Shah's court, holding the traditional Persian title of shahzadeh (\"prince\").Adenin Remy: Almanach de Bruxelles: \"The Qajar Dynasty\" (internet 2015). Bahman Mirza used for himself and his mature sons the more familiar style of navvab (\"highness\"). Many of Bahman Mirza's male offspring were high-ranking officers in the Imperial Russian Army and stayed in the Tsar's service until the October Revolution at Tiflis, Shusha, Ganja and Baku. Many of them served in the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic during the short independence from Russia 1918\u20131920. With the Soviets coming to power and annexing Azerbaijan, many of Bahman Mirza's sons were executed or fled to Iran. ==Historic background== The royal rule of succession of the Qajar dynasty is male primogeniture by a Qajar princess. This special addition means that not automatically the eldest son succeeded his father but the eldest son born by a Qajar princess. All other sons are legitimate but morganatic and have no right to succeed.Heribert Busse: History of Persia during the Qajar Rule, p. 106.This order was set as legal act with the constitution of 1906 with the supplement of the mother's Iranian descent. This fact caused in the first half of the 19th century troubles within the fruitful imperial family. The eldest princes, often powerful governors and their father's favorites did not automatically accept their younger brothers or nephews superior status. Bahman Mirza was the 4th son of Abbas Mirza by his cousin and chief wife Aisha, daughter of Mohammad Khan Qajar Davalu. Abbas Mirza was the 4th son and designated heir apparent of Fath Ali Shah by his chief wife and queen Assiyeh I, daughter of Fath Ali Khan Qajar Davalu. When Abbas Mirza died 1833 before Fath Ali Shah, his eldest son Mohammad Mirza became the new crown prince and Bahman Mirza was the next younger brother. Mohammad Shah suffering from grave illness was a weak monarch, hence Bahman Mirza as well as the foreign powers Great Britain and Russia insisted in his regal rights although Mohammad Shah had already an infant son by a Qajar mother, who was proclaimed crown prince in 1835, had still a bad health but was meant to be next ruler as Nasir al-Din Shah. Thus, Bahman Mirza wanted to execute the office of acting vicegerent of Azerbaijan, viceroy for his brother and regent for his infant nephew. In 1847 Bahman Mirza fell out of royal favor due to political intrigues at court and went in 1848 into exile to Russia. He first moved to Tiflis and in 1853 to Karabakh. The family lived there at Shusha where they hold real estates and a large summer palace. Many family members served at the Russian imperial court of Sankt Peterburg and became popular figures in the later Republic of Azerbaijan. In 1872 one of Bahman Mirza's sons arranged with his cousin Nasser al-Din Shah and the family was rehabilitated in Iran and invited to return to Tehran. Bahman Mirza refused to go back but some of his children did. Hence, the family was divided into a Russian branch, serving the Tsar, and recognised in 1886 with the titles of Prince Persidskii and Princess Persidskaya styled \u201cHis or Her Illustrious Highness\u201c in the Russian Empire by the Tsar. As well as into a Persian branch in Tehran at the Shah's court, holding the traditional Persian title of shahzadeh (\u201cprince\u201d). Bahman Mirza used for himself and his mature sons the more familiar style of navvab (\u201chighness\u201d). The Bahmani children and grandchildren were sent to European schools and got the best education. And many of Bahman Mirza's male offspring were high- ranking officers in the Imperial Russian Army and stayed in the Tsar's service until the October Revolution at Tiflis, Shusha, Ganja and Baku. Many of them served in the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic during the short independence from Russia 1918\u20131920. With the Soviets coming to power and annexing Azerbaijan, many of Bahman Mirza's sons were executed or fled to Iran. Bahman Mirza issued 61 children - 31 sons and 30 daughters, only 50 survived infancy. So he became the father of the Bahmani-Qajars with the lines of the Qajars of Azerbaijan named Bahmanov, Bahmanoglu and Ghajar as well as the Bahman and Bahmani family in Iran. While his daughters, who often had been taken part in many charity events married into all famous families of Azerbaijan like the Akhundov, Badalbeili, Vezirov, Tagiev, Shahtakhtinski, Beglarbegov, Mehmandarov, Abbasovo, Muradov and Mirzov families.Genghis Kadjar: Kadjars, p. 94 f. ==Coat of arms== The family coat of arms based on the old Persian Lion and Sun emblem, the royal symbol since the Seljuq time in the 13th century. In 1785 Agha Mohammad Khan adopted the emblem and under Fath Ali Shah in 1803 it became symbol of the land as well as of royal house, with a crouching lion. In 1871 the current version was published.
