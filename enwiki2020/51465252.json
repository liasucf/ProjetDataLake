Observations on the jaw of a fossil mammiferous animal found in the Stonesfield Slate. Zoological Journal of London 3, 408\u2013412 ==Discovery== Phascolotherium was one of the first mammals described from Mesozoic-aged rocks. It is only known from single lower jaws and some isolated teeth. Buckland showed the fossil jaws of Stonesfield to the exceptional comparative anatomist, Georges Cuvier, who incorrectly identified them as marsupials, based on the similarity of the bones to modern marsupials. Blainville also attributed the fossil to his newly erected genus, Amphitherium.Kermack, KA. 1988 British Mesozoic mammal sites. Special Papers in Palaeontology, 40:85-93 More than one specimen was given to Buckland, and one of these lower jaws was lost, but found again in 1827 by William Broderip, and thought by Charles Lyell to be evidence that mammals dated from the earliest times without having changed. However, Britain's most esteemed, comparative anatomist Richard Owen later recognized the Stonesfield fossils as being distinct from opossums and from another mammal found in the same rocks, named Amphitherium. The new genus Phascolotherium was given to \"D.\" bucklandi.Owen, R. 1838. On the jaws of the Thylacotherium prevostii (Valenciennes) from Stonesfield.
