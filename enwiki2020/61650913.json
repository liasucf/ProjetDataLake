In 1721/1722 he was admitted as master Louwerensius Gieles in the craft of bell cutters.Piron, Acad\u00e9mie Royale: Biographie nationale, pp. 255\u2013257, 261 He was a member of the Saint Luke Guild in Antwerp.Philippe F\u00e9lix Rombouts, Th\u00e9odore Fran\u00e7ois Xavier van Lerius, 'Historic Archives of the Saint Luke Guild in Antwerp, Volume 2, pp. 628, 632, 725\u2013726 Two of his sons, Josephus Gillis (Antwerp 1724 \u2013 Antwerp 1773) and Jean-Baptiste Gillis (Antwerp 1717 \u2013 1752) also became sculptors. A third, Herman Gillis (Antwerp 1733 \u2013 Antwerp 1791) became a painter and director of the academy in Leuven. ==Major works== His most important works in marble and ceramic have been sent to Holland. A work by him is the Madonna and Child on the corner of the Lange Klarenstraat and the Meir in Antwerp. The late Baroque statue was made for the boarding school of the Jesuits on the Sint-Jacobsmarkt. It initially consisted of a group of three figures. This statue was previously attributed to Pieter (I) Verbruggen (Antwerp 1615 \u2013 Antwerp 1686). The Madonna was restored at the end of 2013. She was relocated at the end of December 2014. An additional angel head was applied during the restoration. Another work by him is in the Sint- Jacob church in Antwerp. It is a statue made in 1740 of St. Johannes Nepomucenus.J.M.
