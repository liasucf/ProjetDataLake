    "text": "Ladyvette is a 1950s style Italian music band. It is formed by three actresses and singers: Sugar (Teresa Federico), Pepper (Valentina Ruggeri) and Honey (Francesca Nerozzi). Teresa Federico is also the author of all the original songs\u2019 lyrics and of some of the scores together with Roberto Gori., who is responsible for arrangements and original compositions. Roberto Gori is a pianist and composer, winner of the \u201cDisco D\u2019oro\u201d award in 1996 and the \u201cNino Rota\u201d award in 2016. Since the very beginning Ladyvette are accompanied, in addition to Roberto Gori at the piano, by Riccardo Colasante (drums), Alberto Antonucci (doublebass) and Gian Piero Lo Piccolo (sax and clarinet). Ladyvette is a swing band who combines vocal activities with comedy, both in original and in reinterpreted songs, and in their sketches. ==History== In 2012 Valentina Ruggeri had the idea of forming the band. Since the very beginning her idea was to put together swing music and women\u2019s world. She immediately include in the group Teresa Federico and Vera Dragone, both of them being actresses and singers. Valentina Ruggeri had the initial idea of rearranging well known italian pop music hits from the 80s and 90s (such as Marco Masini, Max Pezzali, Ambra Angiolini...) with a swing mood. It was Teresa Federico\u2019s idea to involve Roberto Gori in the project. He is both a composer and an arranger, therefore, with his help, Ladyvette started editing their first original songs, facing women\u2019s role in different social contexts. Their first single \u201cTapa Tapa\u201d plays around obsession of women on body hairs. First step the Ladyvette\u2019s swoop to Festival del Cinema in Venice happened only two months after the group was formed where the three actresses pretended to be three well known divas: invited by Matteo Garrone to the opening gala of the festival. From the very beginning they proposed themselves on the Italian music scene as singers, but also as authors and entertainers. Their first concert was held in December at the Micca Club, in Rome. In 2014 Ladyvette started a partnership with stylist Vivien of Holloway, who was their official stylist until 2016. From 2014 they performed in many jazz clubs in Rome, such as Cotton Club, Casa del Jazz and Alexander Platz, but also at the Libreria del Cinema, as a partnership with director Giuseppe Piccioni, at the Kino and at the Roma Vintage Festival. In June 2013, they were invited to the Summer Jamboree festival in Senigallia, Italy. ===Team change=== In 2016 after four years of collaboration, Vera Dragone (Cherry) was replaced by Francesca Nerozzi (Honey). As a new member of the trio, Francesca has brought new motivations and thanks also to her experience as a former classic dancer, she focused her job on the trio\u2019s choreographies. ===From television to cinema to theatre=== After two years of live music, Ladyvette meets Gigi Marzullo and Renzo Arbore introducing to them Ladyvette\u2019s project. Within a few weeks, the trio becomes regular guest of \u201cSettenote\u201d, Gigi Marzullo\u2019s late show on music, aired by RaiUno. In 2014 that same year, they also shot as main characters a commercial for Algida, directed by D. Gentile and they participated to the shooting of the film \u201cRadio Cortile\u201d, directed by F. Bonelli. In the same year casting director Claudia Marotti shows some of Ladyvette\u2019s videos to television director Monica Vullo. In 2015 director Monica Vullo cast them as actresses and singers in the television series \u201cIl Paradiso delle Signore\u201d (Produced by Aurora Film, Rai Uno). Then, in 2016, their television activity continued, with appearances in the first season of the TV series is \u201cIl Paradiso delle Signore\u201d, where they also work at part of the original soundtrack edited by Rai Com, winner of Colonne Sonore Prize 2016 as best soundtrack of a television show. That same year they also participated to many television shows like Telethon, Affari Tuoi, Uno Mattina, all aired by Rai Uno. They also appeared in Renzo Arbore\u2019s show \u201cQuelli dello Swing\u201d, aired by Rai Due, with Gege\u2019 Telesforo, Piji Siciliani, Max Paiella, Lillo & Greg. In particular they start a collaboration with Lillo Petrolo helping Teresa Federico writing a theatre show named \u201cLe Dive dello Swing\u201d, staged at Brancaccino Theatre, in Rome, directed by Massimiliano Vado with artistic direction of Lillo Petrolo. This artistic and personal friendship also ends up in Lillo Petrolo special appearance in Ladyvette\u2019s single \u201cTutti quanti voglion fare swing\u201d, featuring Lillo Petrolo showing Lindy Hop dancers'style adopted in Italy. ===International concerts=== In October 2014, they performed at the Ronnie Scott\u2019s Bar in London followed by a short tour in the UK.
