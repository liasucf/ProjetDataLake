N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena was born in 1815 at Keauhou Bay, South Kona, island of Hawai\u02bbi. Her parents were Kamehameha I and Ke\u014dp\u016bolani, the Queen consort. She had two older brothers, hiapo (first born) Liholiho, and Kauikeaouli, who later became Kings Kamehameha II and III. N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena was the sacred muli loa (last born) child, and was trained for the immense kuleana (privilege and responsibility) that would accompany someone of such high birth.Kamakau S.M. Ke Aupuni M\u014d\u02bb\u012b. Kamehameha Schools Press 2001 pa\u02bb\u016b and holding a royal k\u0101hili in 1825. In 1825, the ship returned with the bodies of King Kamehameha II and the Queen Kam\u0101malu, who had died on a trip to London. Ship's artist Robert Dampier painted a portrait of the ten-year-old princess, dressed in a red feather cloak for the state funeral. N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena was in love with her brother Kamehameha IIIHaley, James L., Captive Paradise: A History of Hawaii p. 78, 2014, and the chiefs strongly encouraged their marriage, but the missionaries were opposed to the union, calling it incest and therefore a sin. The practice of marriage between siblings in the royal family was considered a way of keeping the bloodlines pure in ancient Hawaii. N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena's own maternal grandparents were half sister and brother. The missionary culture at the time meant that many people, including N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena, practiced both Hawaiian and Christian beliefs. She practiced cultural traditions such as hula, but also drank rum just as the missionaries did. However, she showed rebellion and distaste for many Christian tasks. She would interrupt church services and openly defy missionary teachings. Although she and many others were fragmented on beliefs, she never fully converted. On her death bed, missionary wives tried to urge her to repent for her sins. She was eventually betrothed to William Pitt Leleiohoku I, the son of William Pitt Kalanimoku, Prime Minister of Hawaii. Kamehameha III tried to delay the wedding by insisting Leleiohoku be educated first. Leleiohoku and N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena were married November 25, 1835 by William Richards at Waine\u02bbe Church. == Death == On September 17, 1836 N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena gave birth to a child. Kamehameha III announced that the child would be the heir to the throne because he believed it to be his, but the child lived for only a few hours. N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena never recovered physically or emotionally from the birth of her child. British physician Thomas Charles Byde Rooke, the husband of High Chiefess Grace Kama\u02bbiku\u02bbi, examined her but was unable to determine the cause of the illness. He called upon Dr. Ruschenberger, a visiting surgeon, to assist him. N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena died three and half months after giving birth, near Hale Uluhe, the home of her brother, Kamehameha III. Although tradition holds that N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena died on , the actual date of her death is described in the notes of the visiting American naturalist John Kirk Townsend as having been . Townsend wrote on January 3, 1837 that he met with the King and found him \"suffering great distress of mind on account of the extreme illness of his favorite and only sister, the princess Harieta Nahienaena\" and \"While we were yet conversing with the king, a messenger came to say that she was worse, and desired to see him.\" A few days later, on January 6, 1837, he wrote \"Yesterday the Princess Harieta died. Scarcely was the circumstance known in the town, when it was announced to all by the most terrific and distressing crying and wailing amongst all ranks and classes of people.\" Later that month, on January 27, 1837, Townsend paid his respects at the princess's casket and described the plaque upon it as saying \"Harieta Nahienaena, aged 22 years, died on the 30th of December, in the year of our Lord, 1836\" and then goes on to say \"This appears like a contradiction. It is stated on the coffin plate, that the princess died on the 30th of December, when it did not actually occur until the 5th of January. This is accounted for, by the peculiar, and in some measure, reasonable doctrine of the Sandwich Islanders, that a person experiences two deaths; one of the mind, and another of the body. Now the mind of the princess died, i.e., became deranged, on the 30th of December, although her body did not die until the 5th of January.\"Townsend, John Kirk. Narrative of a Journey Across the Rocky Mountains, to the Columbia River, and a Visit to the Sandwich Islands, Chili, &c.; Perkins & Marvin Publishers, Merrihew & Thompson Printers 1839 After nearly five weeks of intense grieving, the princess's body was brought in procession to Kawaiaha\u02bbo Church for funeral services. The procession was led by traditional warriors and k\u0101huna la\u02bbau lapa\u02bbau (healers).Ke Kumu. 15 February 1837. Honolulu On April 12, 1837 her body was brought aboard the ship Don Qixote (purchased and renamed Kai Ke\u014dp\u016bolani by her brother), to the sacred resting place called Moku\u02bbula in L\u0101hain\u0101, Maui to be buried next to her mother Ke\u014dp\u016bolani. Her death had a sobering effect on her brother, King Kamehameha III. == Ancestry == == See also == * N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena's Pa\u02bb\u016b == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * * N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena, Feathers, and Gender Category:Royalty of the Hawaiian Kingdom Category:Hawaiian princesses Category:House of Kamehameha Category:1815 births Category:1836 deaths Category:Heirs to the Hawaiian throne Category:Converts to Christianity from pagan religions Category:Burials at Waiola Church ",
