    "text": "Today! is an album by jazz flautist Herbie Mann released on the Atlantic label featuring performances recorded in 1966. accessed March 30, 2011 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states \"Flutist Herbie Mann has always had wide interests in music. For this...LP he is joined by three brass, vibraphonist Dave Pike, bassist Earl May, drummer Bruno Carr and percussionist Patato Valdes (with arrangements by Oliver Nelson) for a wide-ranging program that includes two Beatles songs, a selection from Burt Bacharach and two ancient pieces by Duke Ellington (\"Creole Love Call\" and \"The Mooche\"). In general Mann plays quite well but there is little memorable about this generally commercial effort. \".Dryden, K.
