    "text": "All Saints' Church is a redundant Anglican church in the hamlet of Little Somborne, Hampshire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is situated some southeast of Stockbridge, to the east of the A3057 road. ==History== All Saints has its origin in the Anglo-Saxon era, and it is recorded in the Domesday book. The original church had a nave and a chancel, but in 1170 the chancel was removed, the nave was extended towards the east, and a very small chancel was added at the east end. The chancel was removed during the 17th century, the chancel arch was filled in with a wall and a window was inserted. ==Architecture== The church is constructed in flint rubble with stone dressings. The walls have been rendered and colourwashed. The roof is tiled. Its plan is simple, consisting of a nave and a chancel in a single range, with a weatherboarded bellcote at the west end. At the east end, within the former chancel arch, is a three-light square-headed window, and above this are two lancet windows. In the north wall of the chancel is a 12th-century single-light window. To the west of this is a blocked door dating from the same period. Also in the north wall is a Anglo-Saxon pilaster strip made in Binstead stone from the Isle of Wight. In the south wall of the chancel is a 13th-century lancet window. To the west of this are two single-light square-headed windows. Between these is a Norman round-headed doorway. The west window dates from the 14th century and has two lights with trefoil heads, and there is a quatrefoil window above it. The plaster has been stripped from the interior of the walls, and the floor has been partly removed and replaced by flags. To the south of the chancel arch is a small round-headed niche. The font dates from the 19th century. ==External features== In the churchyard is the grave of Thomas Sopwith, the pioneer aviator, who developed the Sopwith Camel, and died in 1989. ==See also== *List of churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust in South East England ==References== ==External links== *Detailed architectural description *Photographs of the exterior and interior *More photographs Category:Grade II* listed churches in Hampshire Category:Church of England church buildings in Hampshire Category:Churches with elements of Anglo-Saxon work Category:English churches with Norman architecture Category:Churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust Category:Former Church of England church buildings ",
