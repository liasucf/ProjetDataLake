At age 11, he won \"best in costume\" while dressed as Chaplin in a local fair. As his prize, he was employed as a barker at a circus. Soon, he was featured in the circus as a magician's assistant, and he learned to perform magic tricks as well. Canuplin was noticed by the bodabil producer Lou Salvador, Sr. and hired as a Chaplin impersonator. He gained fame performing his Chaplin act and various magic tricks on the Manila bodabil circuit, appearing alongside stars such as Patsy and Bayani Casimiro. He also ventured into such films as Tinig ng Pag-ibig (1940), Luksang Bituin (1941) and Princesa Urduja (1942). One of his most notable roles was as the court jester in the 1941 LVN Pictures production of Ibong Adarna. In many of his films, Canuplin would appear in his Chaplin guise, wordless as was the silent film star. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, film production was halted and Canuplin returned as a headliner in bodabil. He performed at the Life, Capitol and The Avenue theaters. After the war, he appeared in several other films until the 1950s. Canuplin ended his entertainment career at the bodabil circuit where he remained until its waning years in the sixties. His last years were spent in relative obscurity in Tondo, though still recognized by his peers. After his death, the playwright Manny Pambid wrote a play, Canuplin, on the bodabil star's rise and fall. It was staged by the Philippine Educational Theater Association in May 1980. ==Filmography== * 1930 \u2013 Collegian Love * 1940 - Tinig ng Pag-ibig * 1941 - Luksang Bituin * 1941 - Kung kita'y kapiling * 1942 - Princesa Urduja * 1947 - Dalawang Anino * 1948 - Waling-Waling * 1950 - Tubig na Hinugasan * 1955 - Salamangkero * 1961 - Operetang Sampay Bakod * 1977 - Burlesk Queen ==Notes== ==External links== * ==References== * Category:1904 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Impressionists (entertainers) Category:People from Tondo, Manila Category:20th-century Filipino male actors Category:Filipino magicians ",
