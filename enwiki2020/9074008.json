It can reach a maximum length of and can vary considerably in color. Adults are bearded with a number of tassels below the jaw. They inhabit reef slopes from only 1 to 35 meters. When in shallow waters, swimmers may accidentally tread on them which may cause painful injury from the venomous spines. The Tassled scorpionfish has unique vibrant orange colors and markings that allow it to camouflage itself well in between the rocky reefs. Its well-camouflaged skin enables it to hide and wait for prey to pass by to strick it.
