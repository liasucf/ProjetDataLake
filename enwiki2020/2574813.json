    "text": "''L\u00e4ther'' (, or \"Leather\") is the sixty-fifth official album by Frank Zappa, released posthumously as a triple album on Rykodisc in 1996. ==Overview== The recordings for the album were originally delivered to Warner Bros. in 1977. Contractual obligations stipulated that Zappa deliver four albums for release on DiscReet Records, which eventually resulted in much of the material on L\u00e4ther being released on four separate albums: Zappa in New York (1977), Studio Tan (1978), Sleep Dirt (1979), and Orchestral Favorites (1979), only the first of which was produced with Zappa's oversight. Zappa had planned to include much of the material from these albums as a quadruple box set titled L\u00e4ther, but Warner Bros. refused to release it in this format. However, Zappa had broadcast a test pressing over the radio in 1977, encouraging listeners to make tape recordings of it; these bootlegs circulated for years before the album's official release.Slaven, 2003, Electric Don Quixote, p. 248. Gail Zappa has confirmed that the stereo masters for the planned original album were located while producing the 1996 version. While the released official CD version of L\u00e4ther is reportedly identical to the test pressings for the original quadruple album, four bonus tracks were added to the 1996 release, and the title of the song \"One More Time for the World\" was changed to \"The Ocean is the Ultimate Solution\", the title under which the same song appears on the album Sleep Dirt. The album does not include \"Baby Snakes\", a song which was originally planned for the album. A version of the song served as the title of the film (Baby Snakes) from the same era. ==Background and release history== Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve.Miles (2004). Frank Zappa, p. 250. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of- court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.Miles, 2004, Frank Zappa, p. 253; pp. 258\u2013259. In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared the material for L\u00e4ther as an intended four-LP project. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it.Lowe, 2006, The Words and Music of Frank Zappa, p. 131.Miles, 2004, Frank Zappa, p. 267. ===Test pressings and separate releases=== Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc. to release L\u00e4ther in its original configuration, and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material.Miles, 2004, Frank Zappa, p. 261. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast L\u00e4ther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. After Warner Bros. censored Zappa in New York to remove references to Angel guitarist Punky Meadows, and demanding four additional albums, a lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued Studio Tan, Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites. === CD issues === Despite officially acquiring the rights to the material in the 1980s, Frank Zappa chose to release the four previously released albums on CD in 1991 with their original artwork. The four albums were each altered or remixed in some way. * Zappa in New York was released on CD in November 1991 in its uncensored form, remixed entirely and supplemented with the addition of previously unheard bonus tracks. The original vinyl mix version of the album featuring the original track list was eventually made available on CD in 2019 as part of a 40th anniversary 5-disc box set featuring over 3 hours of bonus live performances. * Studio Tan was released on CD in October of the same year with the track \"the Adventures of Greggery Peccary\" entirely remixed. When the CD was reissued in 2012, the complete original vinyl mix of the entire album was used. * Sleep Dirt was released on CD for the first time in September 1991 and featured a new overdubbed drum track along with vocals by singer Thana Harris portraying a character named \"Drakma: Queen of Cosmic Greed\" that Zappa had created in 1972 for a stage musical that never materialized. In 2012, when Sleep Dirt album was reissued, the original instrumental vinyl mix was used. * Orchestral Favorites was digitally transferred for CD with a reversed stereo orientation, switching the left and right channels. This mix has been used for all subsequent reissues, until the 40th anniversary edition, which used the original mix. In 1995, Rykodisc reissued Zappa's entire catalog. None of the four albums related to L\u00e4ther were altered from the original CD issues, though new digital transfers were made. One year later, L\u00e4ther was released officially for the first time through the Rykodisc label as a triple album with four bonus tracks. The 2012 reissue omits the bonus tracks. == Music and lyrics == L\u00e4ther encapsulates various aspects of Zappa's musical styles \u2014 rock, orchestral works, complex instrumental pieces, and Zappa's distorted guitar solos, assembled in a seemingly random way. == Release and reception == The official version of L\u00e4ther was released posthumously in September 1996. It remains debated whether Zappa had conceived the material as a four-LP set from the beginning, or only when approaching Phonogram;Watson, 2005, Frank Zappa. The Complete Guide to His Music, p. 49. In the liner notes to the 1996 release, however, Gail Zappa states that \"As originally conceived by Frank, L\u00e4ther was always a 4-record box set.\" Along with most of Zappa's material, a \"mini-LP\" CD edition was also released by Rykodisc in Japan, with the artwork reformatted to resemble the packaging of a vinyl album. In December 2012, the album was reissued with different packaging that better reflected the intended album cover. Allmusic writer Richie Unterberger praised the album, but wrote that it would \"appeal far more to the Zappa cultist than the general listener, though the Zappa cult \u2013 which has been craving L\u00e4ther in its original format for years \u2013 is a pretty wide fan base in and of itself.\" == Track listing == == Personnel == ; Disc One, Track 1 * Frank Zappa \u2013 percussion * George Duke \u2013 keyboards * Bruce Fowler \u2013 all brass * James \"Bird Legs\" Youman \u2013 bass * Ruth Underwood \u2013 percussion * Chester Thompson \u2013 drums ; Disc One, Track 2; Disc Two, Track 7 & 10 * Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar * Dave Parlato \u2013 bass * Terry Bozzio \u2013 drums * Emil Richards \u2013 percussion * Orchestra conducted by Michael Zearott ; Disc One, Track 3 (Part One) * Frank Zappa \u2013 vocal * George Duke \u2013 keyboards ; Disc One, Track 3 (Part Two) * Frank Zappa \u2013 lead guitar * Andre Lewis \u2013 keyboards * Roy Estrada \u2013 bass * Terry Bozzio \u2013 drums ; Disc One, Track 4, 7 & 8; Disc Three Track 6 * Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar, vocals * Ray White \u2013 guitar, vocals * Eddie Jobson \u2013 violin, keyboards * Patrick O'Hearn \u2013 bass * Terry Bozzio \u2013 drums, vocals ; Disc One, Track 5 * Frank Zappa \u2013 all guitars, bass * Jim Gordon \u2013 drums ; Disc One, Track 6 * Frank Zappa \u2013 lead guitar, vocals * George Duke \u2013 keyboards * Tom Fowler \u2013 bass * Ralph Humphrey \u2013 drums * Ricky Lancelotti \u2013 vocals ; Disc One, Track 9; Disc Two, Track 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8; Disc Three, Track 2 * Frank Zappa \u2013 lead guitar, vocals * Ray White \u2013 rhythm guitar, vocals * Eddie Jobson \u2013 violin, keyboards, vocals * Patrick O'Hearn \u2013 bass, vocals * Terry Bozzio \u2013 drums, vocals * Ruth Underwood \u2013 percussion, synthesizer * David Samuels \u2013 timpani, vibes * Randy Brecker \u2013 trumpet * Michael Brecker \u2013 tenor sax, flute * Lou Marini \u2013 alto sax, flute * Ronnie Cuber \u2013 baritone sax, clarinet * Tom Malone \u2013 trombone, trumpet, piccolo * Don Pardo \u2013 sophisticated narration ; Disc One, Track 10 * Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar, vocals * Davey Moire \u2013 vocals * Eddie Jobson \u2013 keyboards, yodeling * Max Bennett \u2013 bass * Paul Humphrey \u2013 drums * Don Brewer \u2013 bongos ; Disc One, Track 11; Disc Three, Track 4 * Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar, vocals * George Duke \u2013 keyboards * Bruce Fowler \u2013 trombone * Tom Fowler \u2013 bass * Chester Thompson \u2013 drums ; Disc One, Track 12; Disc Three, Track 8 * Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar * George Duke \u2013 keyboards * James \"Bird Legs\" Youman \u2013 bass * Ruth Underwood \u2013 percussion * Chester Thompson \u2013 drums ; Disc Two, Track 5 & 9 * Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar * George Duke \u2013 keyboards * Patrick O'Hearn \u2013 bass * Ruth Underwood \u2013 percussion * Chester Thompson \u2013 drums ; Disc Three, Track 1 * Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar, keyboards * Dave Parlato \u2013 bass * Terry Bozzio \u2013 drums ; Disc Three, Track 3 * Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar, synthesizer * Patrick O'Hearn \u2013 bass * Terry Bozzio \u2013 drums ; Disc Three, Track 5 * Frank Zappa \u2013 percussion * George Duke \u2013 keyboards * Bruce Fowler \u2013 all brass * James \"Bird Legs\" Youman \u2013 bass * Ruth Underwood \u2013 percussion * Chad Wackerman \u2013 drum overdubs ; Production credits * Digital Mastering & EQ \u2013 Spencer Chrislu * Transfer Engineers \u2013 David Dondorf, Spencer Chrislu * Vaultmeisterment \u2013 Joe Travers * Bonues Section Assembly, Edits & Mastering \u2013 Spencer Chrislu * Cover Concept \u2013 Dweezil Zappa * Forward Motion \u2013 Gail Zappa * Deep-dish Descriptions \u2013 Simon Prentis * Cover Execution & Layout Design \u2013 Steven Jurgensmeyer == References == Category:1996 albums Category:Albums published posthumously Category:Frank Zappa albums Category:Rykodisc albums ",
