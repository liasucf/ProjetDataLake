    "text": "\u00c9mile Aillaud (18 January 1902 in Mexico City \u2013 29 December 1988 in Paris)History of Art- Aillaud Emile all-art.org was a French architect. His design can be found after World War II in France, such as Les Courtili\u00e8res in Pantin (1955\u201356, 1957\u201360), Wiesberg at Forbach (1959, 1961 ff.) and La Grande Borne at Grigny (1964\u201371), are representative of the attempts to compensate for the uniformity which resulted from extensively industrialized constructional methods (principally heavy construction employing prefabricated reinforced-concrete panels) by adopting more individualizing urban planning strategies. This is chiefly achieved in the overall arrangement of the building masses, reduced to smooth abstract forms, in curved serpentine compositions; through the integration of works of art; and finally through the careful handling of public spaces, at times eccentrically shaped and colourfully treated. The residents are thereby given an impetus to identify with their environment. ==References== ==Bibliography== *\u00c9mile Aillaud, Desordre apparent, ordre cach\u00e9, Librarie Artheme Fayard, Paris, 1975. *\u00c9mile Aillaud, Chanteloup les Vignes, Librarie Artheme Fayard, Paris, 1978. *Gerald Gassiot-Talabot, Alain Devy, La Grande Borne, Librarie Hachette, Paris, 1972. ==External links== * * http://eras.free.fr/html/archi/aillaud.html Category:1902 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV alumni Category:20th-century French architects Category:Mexican people of French descent Category:Mexican architects Category:Artists from Mexico City ",
