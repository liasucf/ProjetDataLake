    "text": "Upside-down cake An upside-down cake is a cake that is baked in a single pan with its toppings at the bottom of the pan, hence \"upside-down\". Then, when removed from the oven, the upside-down preparation is de-panned onto a serving plate, thus righting it, and serving it right-side up. Usually chopped or sliced fruits \u2014 such as apples, cherries, peaches, or pineapples \u2014 butter, and sugar are placed on the bottom of the pan before the batter is poured in, so that they form a baked-on topping after the cake is inverted. A simple cottage pudding cake batter may be used.Cottage Pudding Proves Equally at Home in an Apartment or Fine Mansion, Detroit Free Press, Detroit, Michigan. 13 Feb 1934, Page 10, Traditional upside-down preparations include the American pineapple upside-down cake, the French Tarte Tatin, and the Brazilian or Portuguese bolo de anan\u00e1s (also known as bolo de abacaxi). ==See also== * Pineapple cake ==References== ==External links== * Category:Cakes Category:Pineapple dishes ",
