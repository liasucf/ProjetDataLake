    "text": "Kenyon A. Joyce was a major general in the United States Army. He commanded the 1st Cavalry Division and later IX Corps in World War II. Joyce was a prominent cavalry officer in the early outset of the war and was a mentor to a young George S. Patton. He later appointed Dwight Eisenhower as a chief of staff and is considered to have played a strong role in his development. He had initially sought to promote Eisenhower to command of a division, but Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall favored him for staff postings. Joyce reached retirement age from the U.S. Army in 1943, at which point Eisenhower, by then a prominent officer in the European Theater, appointed him to the Allied Control Council for Italy. Joyce died in January 1960, and a funeral service was held at Fort Myer. == See also == * List of commanders of 1st Cavalry Division (United States) ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * Category:United States Army officers ",
