Contee Family Coat of Arms ==Ancestry== Contee was the son of Alexander Contee (1693\u20131740) and Jane Brooke (1702\u20131779). Jane was the daughter of Col. Thomas Brooke, Jr., Hon. (1660\u20131730) of \"Brookefield\", President of Maryland and his second wife, Barbara Dent (1676\u20131754). Col. Thomas Brooke, Jr., was the son of Maj. Thomas Brooke, Sr., Esq. (1632\u20131676), of \"Brookefield\", and Eleanor (Hatton) Darnall (1642\u20131745), who married secondly Col. Henry Darnall, Sr. (1645\u20131711). Alexander was the son of Dr. Peter Contee (d. 1714), of Barnstaple, Devonshire, England, and his first wife Catherine. Peter immigrated in about 1703 and resided in Charles County, before taking up permanent residence in Prince George's County. Peter was a surgeon, and married secondly, Francis (?) Hopkins. Francis was the widow of Capt. William Hopkins (d. 1702). Peter was the son of Adolphe de Conti and his wife Grace. Adolphe was a Huguenot who immigrated to England from France during the reign of Louis XIII, King of France (1601\u20131643). The motto under his Arms in Guild Hall, London is, \"pour dieu et mon roi\" (\"for God and my king\"). Alexander, was born in April 1693, in Barnstaple, Devonshire, England. He immigrated around 1703, and resided in Charles County about 1720. He joined his uncle, Col. John Contee (d. 1708), who though married twice, had no children, and whose will provided liberally for Alexander. Alexander was a prosperous merchant at Nottingham Prince George's Co., Clerk of the Court; and from 1720 to 1724, member of the Lower House of the General Assembly. He was a vestryman of St. Paul's Parish. He married about 1720, Jane Brooke. Jane inherited a portion of \"Brookefield\", her father's estate. \"Brookefield\", also known as \"The Valley\", and was located near Nottingham in Prince George's County. At the time of his death on December 24, 1740, Alexander had amassed at least of land, and his estate was valued at 1,613.2.11 pounds sterling, plus 3,827.19.8 pounds current money. This included 32 slaves, 2 servants, books, and clerk's writing equipment. Alexander's will contained a heraldic shield only, with a chevron on which are charges and beasts in dexter, middle and sinister chief and middle base. The arms of the Conte of Montulle, Normandy, contain a chevron and three mullets described as \"Azure chevron or between three mullets or\". The Contees came to Maryland from England, but they were of French descent Huguenots, who emigrated to Barnstable, in Devonshire, to escape the religious persecutions which culminated in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The name originally de Conti, appears among the French nobility from a very early date. As far back as 1375, Isabella, dame de Conti, married Colard de Mailly. Their great granddaughter married in 1551, Louis I, Prince de Conde, a cadet of the Bourbons who ascended the French throne in the person of Henry IV, King of France and Navare (1553\u20131610). The second son of this latter marriage, Francois de Bourbon, was Prince de Conti, but had no issue and the title was revived from Armand de Bourbon, a cadet of the great Conde but expired for lack of male issue. The Vicomte de Conti arms are identical with those of the Rochelle family and also with those of the Marquis de Graviers, Comte de Noirant (of Normandy) and Baron de Conti (of Orange). ==See also== * Colonial families of Maryland ==References== Category:People from Nottingham, Maryland Category:Members of the Maryland House of Delegates Category:Maryland militiamen in the American Revolution Category:People from Maryland in the War of 1812 Category:Fendall family Category:People of colonial Maryland Category:People of Maryland in the American Revolution Category:American planters Category:1729 births Category:1811 deaths Category:18th-century American politicians Category:American slave owners ",
