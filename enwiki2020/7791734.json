    "text": "Future) Graffiti in Haxo station Haxo Haxo () is a ghost station on the Paris M\u00e9tro. It lies on an unused connecting branch between lines 3bis and 7bis.Haxo on fr.Wikipedia == History == The station is situated on a line which was constructed in the 1920s between Porte des Lilas (line 3bis) and Pr\u00e9-Saint-Gervais (line 7bis). A single track was built linking Place des F\u00eates to Porte des Lilas, known as la voie des F\u00eates, with one intermediate station, Haxo. For traffic in the other direction, another track was constructed linking Porte des Lilas to Pr\u00e9 Saint-Gervais, with no intermediate station, called la voie navette. Consequently, Haxo would have been a single- direction station with only one platform, like Mirabeau. However, despite the network owners, the City of Paris, having delivered the necessary infrastructure, the railway operator, Compagnie du chemin de fer m\u00e9tropolitain de Paris, did not consider a service to be sufficiently profitable. Service trains have never called at Haxo, and no access to street level was ever constructed. Occasional special enthusiast trains call at Haxo for photography, and the station was also used to demonstrate the MF 88 rolling stock to the press in 1993 (the \"1993\" sign can be seen on some pictures, more than 10 years later). == Future == A study is being undertaken into the merger of Paris M\u00e9tro Lines 3bis and 7bis, using the existing currently un-trafficked infrastructure between the two lines, and therefore might finally open Haxo for passenger use. The combined lines would run from Ch\u00e2teau-Landon to Gambetta. At the moment, the voie navette is blocked near Pr\u00e9 Saint-Gervais by an additional maintenance facility for the MF 88 rolling stock, due to their high failure rates. Therefore, the line merger would first require the MF 88 trains to be replaced by MF 67 units, which would be cascaded from other lines after the arrival of the MF 2000 equipment. ==Station layout== {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|Street Level (no entrance) |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=500 colspan=2 valign=top| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=10 valign=top|Platform |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Inbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=400|\u2190 No regular service |- |Outbound | No regular service \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |} *Note: Line 7bis does not pass through here on its way to Pr\u00e9 Saint-Gervais; it uses an outer track next to the side platform which is not visible from the platform. == See also == *North End tube station \u2013 never- opened station on the London Underground. *Porte Molitor \u2013 never-opened station on the Paris M\u00e9tro. *Kymlinge \u2013 never-opened station on the Stockholm Metro. == References == == External links == * Description and photos of Haxo *Photo of Haxo at flickr.com (accessed 5 November 2006) *Description of Haxo station at Breakintoparis.com *Account of visit to Haxo Station at Sleepycity.com *Haxo, a dead end station Category:Paris M\u00e9tro stations in the 19th arrondissement of Paris Category:Paris M\u00e9tro line 3bis Category:Paris M\u00e9tro line 7bis Category:Ghost stations of the Paris M\u00e9tro Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1921 ",
