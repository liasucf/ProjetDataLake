    "text": "The Milford Branch was a railroad line in Massachusetts. The line formerly ran from Milford to Framingham, traveling through Holliston and Sherborn, connecting to the Boston Subdivision in Framingham and the Milford Secondary in Milford. The line was originally part of the Boston and Albany Railroad, and the end of the line was later abandoned under Penn Central, before the rest of the line was abandoned by Conrail.http://www.abandonedrails.com/Milford_Branch Although the line passes through Sherborn and terminates in Framingham, the majority of the line lies in Holliston. ==Recent history== In recent years, the track bed in Milford and Holliston was converted to a rail trail. The trail is part of the Upper Charles Rail Trail system. The trail will be extended into Sherborn until it reaches the Holliston Industrial Track, a defunct railroad with old tracks.http://www.uppercharlestrail.org/ ==References== ==External links== Category:Rail infrastructure in Massachusetts Category:Transportation in Worcester County, Massachusetts Category:Transportation in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Rail trails in Massachusetts Category:Boston and Albany Railroad lines ",
