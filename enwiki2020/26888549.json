    "text": "Prince Ren\u00e9 of Bourbon-Parma (17 October 1894 \u2013 30 July 1962) was the seventh surviving son of Robert I, Duke of Parma, and his second wife, Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal. In 1921, he married Princess Margaret of Denmark. They had four children including Queen Anne of Romania, the wife of Michael I, former King of Romania. ==Early life== Prince Ren\u00e9 of Bourbon-Parma was the nineteenth child among the twenty four children of the last reigning Duke of Parma, Robert I (1848\u20131907). Prince Rene's mother was Duke Robert's second wife, Princess Maria Antonia, a daughter of the exiled King Miguel I of Portugal. By his father's first and second marriages, Rene had seventeen siblings who survived childhood. Two of the most famous included Empress Zita of Austria and Prince Felix, the consort of Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. Prince Rene was born in Schwarzau am Steinfeld. He was raised in Austria. Educated at the Theresianum in Vienna, he graduated from a military academy and served at the Imperial and Royal armed forces as a cavalry officer. During World War I, Ren\u00e9's brothers, Princes Sixtus and Xavier decided to fight for the cause of the allies, while Ren\u00e9 and his brothers, Elias, Duke of Parma and Felix fought on the opposite side joining the Austrian Army and the cause of the central powers. Their sister, Zita, was married to Archduke Charles of Austria, who became the Austrian Emperor on November 21, 1916. At the fall of Habsburg monarchy in 1918, Prince Ren\u00e9 moved to France. ==Marriage and children== On 9 June 1921, Prince Ren\u00e9 married Princess Margaret of Denmark in Copenhagen. She was a daughter of Prince Valdemar of Denmark (himself a younger son of Christian IX of Denmark) by his wife Princess Marie of Orl\u00e9ans. Though her father was a Lutheran, Margaret had been raised in her mother's Catholic faith.Finestone, p. 199. Her parents had agreed before the marriage that all their sons would be raised as Lutherans, their father's religion, and that all their daughters would be raised as Roman Catholics. The couple had four children: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" !width=\"18%\"|Name!! width=\"14%\"|Birth!! width=\"14%\"|Death!! width=\"62%\"|Notes |- | Prince Jacques of Bourbon-Parma || 9 June 1922 || || married 1947 to Countess Birgitte Alexandra Maria af Holstein-Ledreborg (1922\u20132009); had issue |- | Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma || ||1 August 2016 (aged 92) || married king Michael I of Romania; had issue |- | Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma || || 7 July 2018 (aged 92) || married 1st, Princess Yolande de Broglie-Revel, 5 children; married 2nd, Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, no acknowledged issue |- | Prince Andr\u00e9 of Bourbon-Parma || 6 March 1928 || || married 1960 to Marina Gacry; had issue.

A few weeks before the birth of their first child, Ren\u00e9 and his wife traveled to Paris for a few weeks in order to ensure he was born on French soil. The birth was witnessed by Ren\u00e9's three brothers. Although Prince Ren\u00e9's father had been very wealthy, Ren\u00e9's own personal fortune was not large. Nevertheless, he enjoyed a comfortable existence with his wife and their children. They lived in a large villa in Saint-Maurice, Val-de-Marne. The family's prosperity was reduced during financial crisis in the 1920s and 1930s. ==Later life == At the outbreak of World War II, Prince Ren\u00e9 tried to join the French Army, unable to do it, he traveled to Finland, where he volunteered for service with the Finnish army. He received a mission from the commander-in-chief, Field Marshal Baron Mannerheim, to acquire support for Finland from France and Italy, a task more suitable for him than fighting. His three eldest children joined the allied effort. His sons, Jacques and Michel, fought in Europe and the Far east. His daughter, Anne, trained as a mechanic in Morocco. Ren\u00e9's wife, Princess Margaret, fled from the Nazis in 1939 and escaped to Spain. From there she went to Portugal and then to the United States. In September 1944, Prince Ren\u00e9 witnessed the liberation of Luxembourg, where his brother, Prince Felix, was the consort of Grand Duchess Charlotte. After the war ended, Prince Ren\u00e9 settled with his wife in Denmark. In 1947, they took their daughter, Anne, to the wedding of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, both of whom, like Princess Margaret, were direct descendants of Christian IX of Denmark. At the wedding, Princess Anne met her future husband King Michael I of Romania. In 1953, Prince Ren\u00e9 was halted by irate motorists for driving while intoxicated, according to a police statement. As a result, Frederick IX of Denmark forbade Ren\u00e9 from driving an automobile in Denmark for a year. Frederick apparently told Ren\u00e9 to find someone else to drive him if the Prince desired to travel somewhere within the year. In 1964, Ren\u00e9's eldest son, Prince Jacques, was killed. He was a motor sport enthusiast, and died in a traffic accident on a highway in Denmark. Ren\u00e9 himself died on 30 July 1962 at the age of 67. ==Titles, styles and honours == ;Titles and styles *17 October 1894 \u2013 30 July 1962: His Royal Highness Prince Ren\u00e9 of Bourbon-Parma. ;Honours *: 60px Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Louis for Civil Merit. *: 60px Knight of the Order of the Elephant (09/06/1921). ==Ancestry == ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== * A photograph of Prince Ren\u00e9, his wife, and two of their children Category:1894 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from Neunkirchen District, Austria Category:House of Bourbon- Parma Category:Princes of Bourbon-Parma Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I ",
