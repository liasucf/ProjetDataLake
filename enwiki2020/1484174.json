It is situated across the water from the Long Beach Convention Center, Shoreline Village, and the Queen Mary Hotel and Attraction. The Aquarium sees 1.5 million visitors a year and has a total staff of about 1,875 people, including more than 1,500 volunteers and about 375 employees. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit aquarium. The Aquarium is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). ==Exhibits== The Aquarium features a collection of over 11,000 animals representing over 500 different species in exhibits ranging in size and capacity from about 5,000 to 350,000 gallons. Exhibits introduce the inhabitants and seascapes of the Pacific, while also focusing on specific conservation messages associated with each region. The Pacific Ocean is the focus of three major permanent galleries, sunny Southern California and Baja, the frigid waters of the Northern Pacific and the colorful reefs of the Tropical Pacific.

The first exhibit is the three-story Blue Cavern tank, which houses animals that live in the waters surrounding nearby Catalina Island. Next is the Amber Forest exhibit, which replicates a Giant kelp forest with Garibaldi, California scorpionfish, and other representative organisms. The Gulf of California exhibit houses Cortez rainbow wrasse, Mexican lookdowns, Porcupine fish, and others. Other areas of the gallery include the Seal and Sea Lion Habitat, Ray Touch Pool, and Shorebird Sanctuary. ===Northern Pacific Gallery=== The Northern Pacific Gallery focuses on organisms from the Bering Sea. Exhibits include the Sea Otter Habitat, home to southern sea otters; the giant Pacific octopus tank; and Diving Birds, where puffins and auklets live. Other species on display include Japanese spider crabs, jellyfish, and sea anemones. ===Tropical Pacific Gallery=== The Tropical Pacific Gallery exhibits animals off the coast of the islands of Palau and has the aquarium's largest tank, the Tropical Reef Habitat. This tank houses olive ridley sea turtles, zebra sharks, and many other species. Elsewhere in the Gallery are big-belly seahorses, leafy seadragons, weedy seadragons, and sea kraits. ===Explorer's Cove=== Three Rainbow Lorikeets at the Aquarium The Aquarium's main outdoor area, Explorer's Cove, encompasses the Shark Lagoon and Lorikeet Forest. ====Shark Lagoon==== This exhibit area houses over 150 sharks and rays. The main tank houses larger spec rays, whitetip reef sharks, nurse sharks, and sand tiger sharks, while the more docile Bamboo and epaulette sharks live in the three touch pools. ====Lorikeet Forest==== The Lorikeet Forest walk-through aviary covers and houses five subspecies of rainbow lorikeet as well as the violet-necked lory. Guests may feed them small amounts of nectar for a fee. ===June Keyes Penguin Habitat=== This exhibit for the Magellanic penguin opened in May, 2012. An underwater crawl-in space allows guests to view the penguins from within the tank. ===Other attractions=== In spring 2010, the Aquarium opened a new Earth- Friendly Garden on its front lawn. The garden features California native and drought-resistant plants, as well as a very efficient irrigation system, to show part of the solution to Southern California's ongoing water shortage problems. ==Activities== Activities of the Aquarium of the Pacific employees and volunteers extend far beyond exhibits. The diverse marine science and conservation ventures include: breeding and conservation programs for endangered marine animals and habitats; housing of unreleasable seals, sea lions, and sea otters from local care centers and marine parks; beach and habitat cleanups; a variety of green business practices; and continuing efforts to educate visitors on the importance the ocean, its threats, and conservation, including the hazards of marine pollution, over-harvesting, habitat destruction and global climate change. One example is a trashion festival with works by Marina DeBris educating about ocean pollution. The Aquarium of the Pacific is also home to many cultural events throughout the year, such as the Pacific Islander Festival in the summer, the Moompetam Festival in the fall, special treats for the animals at Christmas, the Festival of Human Abilities in January, and the African Heritage Festival in February. ==Architecture== The Aquarium architecture is inspired by the towering, breaking waves of the Pacific and mirrors the fluid and dynamic temper of the ocean. Kajima International, developers of the world's most critically acclaimed and technologically advanced aquariums, was the developer of the Aquarium of the Pacific and architects included the Los Angeles office of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassanbaum and Esherick Homsey Dodge and Davis of San Francisco. Construction was a joint venture of Turner Construction Company and Kajima International. On June 20, 1998, construction was completed and the Aquarium opened to the public. ==Gallery== File:Exquisitur.jpg|Entrance to tropical gallery, designed to replicate a tropical coral reef lagoon File:Plasticbystander.jpg|California sea lion during training session File:Topofbigtrop.jpg|Top of 350,000 gallon tropical habitat, viewable only during behind the scenes tours ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Aquaria in California Category:Museums in Long Beach, California ",
