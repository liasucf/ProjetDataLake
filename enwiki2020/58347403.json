    "text": "Pedro V Ntivila a Nkanga was a ruler of the throne of the Kingdom of Kongo and a member of the Kimpanzu house. He ruled Kongo from 1763 to 1764, after he overthrew Sebasti\u00e3o I, when Pedro refused to relinquish the Kimpanzu claims to the throne.History Files: Kingdom of Kongo (http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsAfrica/AfricaAngola.htm) This overthrow resulted in the breakdown of the rotating houses system put in place by Pedro IV. His reign was short lived however, and after he was in turn overthrown by \u00c1lvaro XI, he was removed from the official records, evidenced by the ascension of the official Pedro V in 1859. It is most likely due to the fact that he claimed the throne at the same time as \u00c1lvaro IX, though he kept his claim on the throne even after his removal.Thronton, John. 2000. \u201cMbanza Kongo/Sao Salvador: Kongo's Holy City\u201d in Africa's Urban Past (eds.)
