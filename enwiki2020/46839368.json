    "text": "The fifth season of the American television sitcom New Girl premiered on January 5, 2016, on Fox in its new time slot of 8:00pm (Eastern). The show briefly aired back-to-back on April 19 before airing the final six episodes, beginning April 26, at 8:00 and 9:00 pm respectively. Developed by Elizabeth Meriwether under the working title Chicks & Dicks, the series revolves around offbeat teacher Jess (Zooey Deschanel) after her moving into an LA loft with three men, Nick (Jake Johnson), Schmidt (Max Greenfield), and Winston (Lamorne Morris); Jess's best friend Cece (Hannah Simone) also appears regularly. The show combines comedy and drama elements as the characters, who are in their early thirties, deal with maturing relationships and career choices. ==Production== On March 31, 2015, New Girl was renewed for a fifth season. The show remained in production after wrapping season four in order to get a jump on season 5 ahead of Deschanel's maternity leave. Deschanel was absent in 6 episodes of the fifth season. The onscreen reason for her absence was that her character was sequestered for jury duty. John Cho was the first guest announced after New Girl was renewed for season 5. Fred Armisen, Stephen Rannazzisi and Ally Maki all signed up to guest star this season. Megan Fox was cast in the role of Reagan and temporarily filled in for Zooey Deschanel after she pre-taped her episodes last spring before taking a maternity leave. This did not premiere in the Fall but instead January 2016, with what Fox states to be \"its first-ever season of virtually uninterrupted originals.\" Damon Wayans, Jr. made his return for a two episode arc this season. ==Cast and characters== ===Main cast=== * Zooey Deschanel as Jessica \"Jess\" Day * Jake Johnson as Nick Miller * Max Greenfield as Schmidt * Lamorne Morris as Winston Bishop * Hannah Simone as Cece ===Special guest cast=== * Damon Wayans Jr. as Coach ===Recurring cast=== * Megan Fox as Reagan * Curtis Armstrong as Principal Foster * Steve Agee as Outside Dave * Meaghan Rath as May * Peter Gallagher as Gavin * David Walton as Sam * Nasim Pedrad as Aly Nelson * Nelson Franklin as Robby * Fred Melamed as J.
