    "text": "The Frank J. Selke Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League forward who demonstrates the most skill in the defensive component of the game. The winner is selected by a poll of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association following the regular season. Named after Frank J. Selke, former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens, the trophy has been awarded 35 times to 23 different players since the 1977\u201378 NHL season. The current holder is Sean Couturier of the Philadelphia Flyers. ==History== The trophy was first awarded at the end of the 1977\u201378 NHL season. It was named after Frank J. Selke, former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens. The Selke Trophy was the fifth and last of the major NHL awards to be introduced that have been named after General Managers and owners of the Original Six teams, the other awards being the Art Ross Trophy, James Norris Memorial Trophy, Conn Smythe Trophy, and Jack Adams Award. The first recipient was Bob Gainey of the Canadiens, who won the trophy the first four years it was given, and along with Bruin Patrice Bergeron, won it more times than any other player. Guy Carbonneau, Jere Lehtinen and Pavel Datsyuk are tied for the second-most wins, with three apiece. The Montreal Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings have won the trophy the most times, with 7 awards apiece. The team with the greatest number of unique winners are the Red Wings with 4\u2014Sergei Fedorov (twice), Steve Yzerman, Kris Draper, and Datsyuk (three times)\u2014all coming since 1994. There has been only one instance in which a Selke Trophy winner was also awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy for Most Valuable Player when Sergei Fedorov captured both trophies during the 1993\u201394 NHL season. There has not been an instance in which the Art Ross Trophy winner has been awarded the Selke Trophy, though Fedorov finished second in regular season scoring in 1994, while Hart Trophy winner and Art Ross Trophy runner-up Joe Sakic finished second in Selke voting in 2001. The most points scored in a Selke-winning season is 127 by Doug Gilmour in the 1992\u201393 NHL season.https://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/share.cgi?id=/Mr4yp == Winners == Jere Lehtinen, three-time winner Pavel Datsyuk, three-time winner Patrice Bergeron, four-time winner {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Positions key | C || Centre | RW || Right Wing | LW || Left Wing |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Season !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Winner !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Team !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Position !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Win # |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Montreal Canadiens | LW | 1 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Montreal Canadiens | LW | 2 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Montreal Canadiens | LW | 3 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Montreal Canadiens | LW | 4 |- | | | Boston Bruins | C | 1 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Philadelphia Flyers | C | 1 |- | | | Washington Capitals | C | 1 |- | | | Buffalo Sabres | LW | 1 |- | | | Chicago Blackhawks | C | 1 |- | | | Philadelphia Flyers | C | 1 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Montreal Canadiens | C | 1 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Montreal Canadiens | C | 2 |- | | | St. Louis Blues | C | 1 |- | | | Chicago Blackhawks | RW | 1 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Montreal Canadiens | C | 3 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Toronto Maple Leafs | C | 1 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Detroit Red Wings | C | 1 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Pittsburgh Penguins | C | 1 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Detroit Red Wings | C | 2 |- | | | Buffalo Sabres | C | 1 |- | | | Dallas Stars | RW | 1 |- | | | Dallas Stars | RW | 2 |-bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\" | | | Detroit Red Wings | C | 1 |- | | | New Jersey Devils | C | 1 |- | | | New York Islanders | C | 2 |- | | | Dallas Stars | RW | 3 |- | | | Detroit Red Wings | C | 1 |- | | colspan=\"4\"| |- | | | Carolina Hurricanes | C | 1 |- | | | Carolina Hurricanes | C | 2 |- bgcolor=\"#FFFFcc\" | | | Detroit Red Wings | C | 1 |- bgcolor=\"#FFFFcc\" | | | Detroit Red Wings | C | 2 |- bgcolor=\"#FFFFcc\" | | | Detroit Red Wings | C | 3 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | Vancouver Canucks | C | 1 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | Boston Bruins | C | 1 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | Chicago Blackhawks | C | 1 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | Boston Bruins | C | 2 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | Boston Bruins | C | 3 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | Los Angeles Kings | C | 1 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | Boston Bruins | C | 4 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | Los Angeles Kings | C | 2 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | St. Louis Blues | C | 1 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | | | Philadelphia Flyers | C | 1 |} ==See also== *List of National Hockey League awards *List of NHL players *List of NHL statistical leaders *Two-way forward ==References== ;General *Frank J.
