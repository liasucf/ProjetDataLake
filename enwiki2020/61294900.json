    "text": "The bibliography of John Ashbery includes poetry, literary criticism, art criticism, journalism, drama, fiction, and translations of verse and prose. His most significant body of work is in poetry, having published numerous poetry collections, book-length poems, and limited edition chapbooks. In his capacity as a journalist and art critic, he contributed to magazines like New York and Newsweek. He served for a time as the editor of Art and Literature: an International Review and as executive editor of Art News. In drama and fiction, he wrote five plays and cowrote the novel A Nest of Ninnies with James Schuyler. Beyond his original works, he translated verse and prose from French. Many of his works of poetry, prose, drama, and translations have been compiled in volumes of collected writings. ==Books== ===Verse=== Ashbery published 26 books of poetry (not including his limited edition books, listed below). Most of them are poetry collections, which typically contain a mix of new and previously published poems. Flow Chart and Girls on the Run are book- length long poems. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"100%\" |- ! style=\"width: 2em\"| Year ! style=\"width: 20em\"| Title ! style=\"width: 20em\"| Publisher ! style=\"width: 10em\"| First editioncatalog no. ! class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\"| 1956 | | | style=\"text- align: center\"| | Yale Series of Younger Poets, volume 52.
