    "text": "Fictional colleges are found in many modern novels, films, and other works of fiction, probably because they allow the author greater licence for invention and a reduced risk of being accused of libel or slander, as might happen if the author depicted unsavory events as occurring at a real-life institution. Below is a list of some of the fictional colleges of the University of Oxford. ==His Dark Materials== Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials novels feature a number of fictional Oxford colleges: *Cardinal's College *Foxe College *Gabriel College *Jordan College *Queen Philippa's College *St Michael's College *St Scholastica's College *St Sophia's College *Wordsworth College *Wykeham College ==Inspector Morse== The Inspector Morse series of books by Colin Dexter is predominantly set within Oxford and its environs, including the University. Consequently, many fictional colleges are named. The derived television series, Inspector Morse, Lewis and Endeavour, continue this practice.
