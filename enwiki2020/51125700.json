    "text": "The Sideways Trilogy is a series of three comedic wine themed novels by Rex Pickett which include Sideways, which was the basis of a 2004 film directed by Alexander Payne, Vertical and Sideways 3 Chile. ==Overview== The trilogy spans approximately eight years in the life of its main protagonist, a writer named Miles. At the beginning of Sideways, Miles is a mostly unsuccessful screenwriter and functioning alcoholic who is taking his best friend Jack, a successful TV director, on a trip to California's wine country the week before the latter's wedding. Vertical takes place seven years later, during which time Miles has found literary success with the publication of a novel based on the adventures he and Jack experienced in the trilogy's preceding installment. Jack, on the other hand, has seen his fortunes decline following a divorce and an increasing alcohol problem. Sideways 3 Chile picks up about one year later, and features Miles taking a trip to Chile to research an article for a wine magazine. ==Novels== * Sideways (2004) * Vertical (2010) * Sideways 3 Chile (2015) ==Stage and musical adaptions== In 2019 it was announced that Sideways was scheduled to adapted for a Broadway musical. A play adapted by author Rex Pickett from the Sideways novel was produced at multiple theaters in the United States and the United Kingdom, including at the La Jolla Playhouse.
