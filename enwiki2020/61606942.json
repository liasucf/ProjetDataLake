    "text": "Henry David Janowitz (1915-2008) was professor emeritus of gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He is known for his contributions into inflammatory bowel diseases and being a leader in the Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis research. ==Early life and education== Janowitz was born in a Jewish household to Rose and Sam Janowitz on March 13, 1915 in Paterson, New Jersey. The sociologist Morris Janowitz was his younger brother. After graduating from Eastside High School at the age of 16, Janowitz entered Columbia College from which he graduate with honors and a membership into Phi Beta Kappa. His major there was biology but his undergraduate was history of philosophy.Kirsner, Joseph B. \"Friedenwald Presentation to Henry David Janowitz, M.D.\", Gastroenterology, 87(4). . Retrieved September 30, 2019. \"Henry David Janowitz was born March 23, 1915, in Paterson, New Jersey.... His high school was Eastside in Paterson, one of those remarkable public institutions that are in such short supply today, where he was introduced to classical learning.\" Because he was uncertain whether to pursue medicine or philosophy, he sought an advice from his mentor and professor, Dr. Irwin Edman. Edman suggested to him to become a physician, and so he did. After graduating from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1939 with Alpha Omega Alpha honor, Janowitz did a two-year fellowship in clinical pathology. ==War== In 1942 he joined the US Army as a medic in World War II and until 1946 served as such at its Medical Corps. While serving at an Arkansas-based Army hospital, Janowitz became acquainted with Thomas Urmy, a gastroenterologist from Boston. After learning preceptorship in gastroenterology from this man, the next three years became very fruitful for Janowitz, who during those years served as gastroenterologist in France and Germany, and was eventually sent home with a rank of a major. ==Career== ===Early career=== Following the war, he resumed his studying, earning a Master's degree in physiology from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1947, at the age of 32, Janowitz became a CUCPS resident. Between 1948 and 1950 he worked towards master's degree in physiology at Andrew Conway Ivy's Department of Clinical Science at the University of Illinois. There, under mentorship of professor Morton I. Grossman, he laid out foundations in gastrointestinal physiology and became known as Dr. Grossman's oldest living student. Since gastrin and cholecystokinin were already discovered by that time, Dr. Janowitz focused his study onto physiology of gastric organs and autonomic nervous system. Upon completion of his thesis in 1950, Janowitz returned to the Gastrointestinal Physiology Laboratory as full time researcher. While at the lab, he worked under Franklin Hollander, who at that time was a renowned gastroenterologist after publishing his investigations into gastrointestinal electrolyte metabolism. ===Later career=== Janowitz became a private practitioner in 1952 and worked closely with Burrill Bernard Crohn at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, New York. While there, he also worked with David Dreiling and contributed to the study of peptic ulcer and inflammatory bowel diseases. In 1958, Janowitz was asked to create a Division of Gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai Hospital. While leading that group, he trained over 100 residents and fellows among which were Bernard Wolf and Richard Marshak. ==Editorial work== Prof. Janowitz served on many editorial boards, including Journal of Chronic Diseases (now known as Journal of Clinical Epidemiology), the American Journal of Physiology and was a contributor to Gastroenterology Clinics. He also was known for the resurrection of the American Journal of Digestive Diseases which existed from 1956 to 1966. He was a member of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and served as Committee chairman with the American Gastroenterological Association and on the National Scientific Advisory Board of the National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis. ==Death and legacy== Janowitz died on August 19, 2008 and was survived by his wife, Adeline R. Tintner, and two children Anne and Mary Janowitz. ==Honors== *Member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation (1956) ==References== Category:1915 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American gastroenterologists Category:Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alumni Category:Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai faculty Category:Eastside High School (Paterson, New Jersey) alumni Category:People from Paterson, New Jersey Category:Members of the American Society for Clinical Investigation Category:Jewish American scientists ",
