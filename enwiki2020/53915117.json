    "text": "Vinyllithium is an organolithium compound with the formula LiC2H3. A colorless or white solid, it is encountered mainly as a solution in tetrahydrofuran (THF). It is a reagent in synthesis of organic compounds.. ==Preparation and structure== Solutions of vinyllithium are prepared by lithium-halogen exchange reactions. A halide-free route entails reaction of tetravinyltin with butyllithium: :Sn(CH=CH2)4 \\+ 4 BuLi \u2192 SnBu4 \\+ 4 LiCH=CH2 The reaction of ethylene and lithium affords vinyl lithium and lithium hydride, together with other organolithium compounds, Like most organolithium compounds, vinyllithium crystallizes from THF as a cluster compound as a cubane-type cluster. Structure of [LiC2H3(THF)]4. ==Reactions== Vinyllithium is used to install vinyl groups on metal-based reagents, being a precursor to vinylsilanes, vinylcuprates, and vinylstannanes. It adds to ketones compounds to give allylic alcohols. Vinylmagnesium bromide is often used in place of vinyllithium. ==References== Category:Organolithium compounds Category:Vinyl compounds ",
