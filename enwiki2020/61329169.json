    "text": "El Gato del R\u00edo (\"The River Cat\") is a sculpture by Colombian artist Hernando Tejada. The sculpture was inaugurated on July 3, 1996 and is located on the side of the Cali River in Cali, Colombia. Over time, it has turned into a famous landmark of the city along with the monument to Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar and Cristo Rey. Today the area near the sculpture has turned into a park with cat sculptures by several artists known as the Parque El Gato De Tejada or the \"Cat Park\". == History == In 1996, a plan was created to beautify the banks of the Cali River on the city\u2019s north side. For this project, Tejada donated this sculpture to the city. The sculpture was created in bronze in the studio of Rafael Franco in Bogot\u00e1. To transport the sculpture to the city, the roof of the studio had to be removed. El Gato del R\u00edo was inaugurated on July 3, 1996, which is celebrated as the independence day in Cali. The monument was situated on the Avenida del R\u00edo in an area with high foot traffic. Below the sculpture is a plaque that reads: > El gato del r\u00edo Escultura en bronce elaborada por el maestro Hernando Tejada > Bajo el auspicio del gobernador del Valle del Cauca Germ\u00e1n Villegas Villegas > y el alcalde de Santiago de Cali Mauricio Guzm\u00e1n Cuevas Santiago de Cali > Julio 3 de 1996 ===Las novias del gato=== One of the river cat's girlfriends. In 2006, the city planned a revitalization project for the area, which included adding new sculptures near El Gato del R\u00edo by other artists. The project consisted of adding 15 new cat sculptures of the same size and shape but painted by different Colombian artists. These new cat sculptures became known as las novies del gato (\"the cat's girlfriends\"). Famous Colombian artists contributed cats, including Maripaz Jaramillo, Roberto Molano, Diego Pombo, Cecilia Coronel, Pedro Alc\u00e1ntara, and Omar Rayo. Today, there are more than 15 cat sculptures exhibited and some of these have been distributed throughout the city. ==See also== * La Tertulia Museum * The Cristo Rey == References == Category:1996 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures in Cali Category:Bronze sculptures in Colombia ",
