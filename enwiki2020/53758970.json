He speaks from a point of experience and expresses the hardship that occurs for those who leave their home countries before, during, and after migration. East 110th Street, his best known work, is a book of poetry that uses English, Spanish, and Spanglish to express emotions of the everyday. The poems' subject matter ranges from tributes to other important Latino American writers to scenes of East Harlem. Many of his poems use wordplay in conjunction with mixed language and Spanglish, which creates a sense of confusion for the reader and demonstrates the complexity and layers of the lifestyle that many in the community live. He also makes use of pattern poems which forces the reader to visualize and read the poem in the intended tone and with the intended timing. He uses his pattern poems to emphasize the space that cannot necessarily be filled between English and Spanish: the words that don't translate and the experiences that are unique to immigrants and especially, Puerto Ricans in New York. == References == Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:University at Buffalo alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:Fordham University alumni Category:People from Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico Category:20th-century Puerto Rican poets Category:21st- century Puerto Rican poets Category:People from Harlem Category:Writers from the Bronx ",
