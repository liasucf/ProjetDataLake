    "text": "Phenanthrene is a likely carcinogenic compound that poses a large toxicity risk to exposed living organisms. It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-which are a large group of organic compounds occurring in groups of two or more. Phenanthrene occurs naturally and also is a man-made chemical. Commonly, humans are exposed to phenanthrene through inhalation of cigarette smoke but there are many routes of exposure. Evidence, proven through animal studies, shows that phenanthrene is a potential carcinogen . It appears as a colorless, crystal-like solid but can also look yellow. Phenanthrene is used to make dyes, plastics and pesticides, explosives and drugs. It has also been used to make bile acids, cholesterol and steroids. The compound with a phenanthrene skeleton and nitrogens at the 4 and 5 positions is known as phenanthroline. ==Chemistry== Phenanthrene is nearly insoluble in water but is soluble in most low polarity organic solvents such as toluene, carbon tetrachloride, ether, chloroform, acetic acid and benzene. The Bardhan\u2013Sengupta phenanthrene synthesis is a classic way to make phenanthrenes. :Bardhan\u2013Senguptam phenanthrene synthesis This process involves electrophilic aromatic substitution using a tethered cyclohexanol group using diphosphorus pentoxide, which closes the central ring onto an existing aromatic ring. Dehydrogenation using selenium converts the other rings into aromatic ones as well. The aromatization of six-membered rings by selenium is not clearly understood, but it does produce H2Se. Phenanthrene can also be obtained photochemically from certain diarylethenes. Reactions of phenanthrene typically occur at the 9 and 10 positions, including: * Organic oxidation to phenanthrenequinone with chromic acidOrganic Syntheses, Coll.

Vol. 2, p.482 (1943); Vol. 16, p.63 (1936) Link. * Ozonolysis to diphenylaldehydeOrganic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 5, p.489 (1973); Vol. 41, p.41 (1961) Link. ===Canonical forms=== Phenanthrene is more stable than its linear isomer anthracene. A classic and well established explanation is based on Clar's rule. A novel theory invokes so-called stabilizing hydrogen-hydrogen bonds between the C4 and C5 hydrogen atoms. == Natural occurrences == Ravatite is a natural mineral consisting of phenanthrene.Ravatite Mineral Data It is found in small amounts among a few coal burning sites. Ravatite represents a small group of organic minerals. === In plants === ==See also== * Chrysene == References == == External links == * Phenanthrene at scorecard.org Category:Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ",
