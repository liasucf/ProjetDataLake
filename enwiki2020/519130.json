    "text": "The list of regions of Canada is a summary of geographical areas on a hierarchy that ranges from national (groups of provinces and territories) at the top to local regions and sub-regions of provinces at the bottom. Administrative regions that rank below a province and above a municipality are also included if they have a comprehensive range of functions compared to the limited functions of specialized government agencies. Some provinces and groups of provinces are also quasi-administrative regions at the federal level for purposes such as representation in the Senate of Canada. However regional municipalities (or regional districts in British Columbia) are included with local municipalities in the article List of municipalities in Canada. ==National regions== The Provinces and territories are sometimes grouped into regions, listed here from west to east by province, followed by the three territories. Seats in the Senate are equally divided among four regions: the West, Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes, with special status for Newfoundland and Labrador as well as for the three territories of Northern Canada ('the North'). This is the only regional scheme that has any legal status or function. Regional representation on the Supreme Court of Canada is governed more by convention than by law. Quebec is the only region with a legally guaranteed quota of three judges on the bench. The other regions are usually represented by three judges from Ontario, two from Western Canada (typically but not formally one from British Columbia and one from the Prairie Provinces) and one from Atlantic Canada. The three territories do not have any separate representation on the Supreme Court. Statistics Canada uses the six-region model for the Geographical Regions of Canada. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada uses the five-region model, while seven regions are commonly used for polling. The various models are derived from the three- region scheme by progressively subdividing the western and eastern regions (the northern region is the same for all models) into smaller and smaller units consisting of provinces or groups of provinces. If the models are not treated as mutually exclusive, eight distinct national regions can be identified when the three western regions of the seven region scheme are combined with the two Atlantic regions of the Senate method and the Ontario, Quebec, and Northern regions common to both schemes. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !scope=\"col\"|All provinces and territories !scope=\"col\"|Senate divisions !scope=\"col\"|Seven-region modelUsed, for example, by EKOS Research polling, Harris-Decima polling . !scope=\"col\"|Six-region model !scope=\"col\"|Five-region modelImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

However, the geographic or cultural features that characterize this type of region can sometimes lead to the relevant provinces or territories being seen as regional groups like British Columbia-Yukon and Alberta-Northwest Territories. ===Linguistic=== *French Canada, centred in Quebec but with scattered populations in Manitoba, Ontario, and the Maritime provinces *English Canada, sometimes known as the Rest of Canada, with Quebec usually excluded despite the presence of scattered English speaking populations in the southern part of the province *Inuit Nunangat, a large region of northern Canada populated mainly by the Inuit, the majority of whom do not claim either English or French as their first language ===Primary, secondary, and local geographic=== *Arctic Archipelago, a large group of Canadian islands in the Arctic Ocean that lies partly in Nunavut, partly in the Northwest Territories, and one, Herschel Island, that is part of Yukon.Flora of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago Parnassia kotzebuei Flora of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago Astragalus eucosmusArctic Archipelago **Arctic Cordillera, a very long, broken chain of mountain ranges extending along the northeastern flank of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from Ellesmere Island to the northernmost part of the Labrador Peninsula in northern Labrador and northern Quebec *Canadian Cordillera which links most of British Columbia and Yukon with some smaller adjacent areas of Alberta and the Northwest Territories to form a single region of mountains and plateaus **Taiga Cordillera that includes much of Northern Yukon Territory and an adjacent area of the Northwest Territories **Boreal Cordillera that links northwestern British Columbia with Southern Yukon **Pacific Maritime Cordillera that includes the west coast of British Columbia and the southwest corner of Yukon **Montane Cordillera that includes the central and southern interior of British Columbia and the Rocky Mountains that extend partly into Alberta *Interior Plains of western Canada, which extend from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Canada-US border east of the Canadian Cordillera and west of the Canadian Shield;

The geographic regions are largely unofficial and therefore somewhat open to interpretation. In some cases, the primary regions are separated by identifiable transition zones, particularly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario. The largest provinces can be divided into a number of primary geographic regions of comparatively large size (e.g. southern Ontario), and subdivided into a greater number of smaller secondary regions (e.g. southwestern Ontario). The primary and secondary regions in Ontario are mainly non-administrative in nature. However, they tend to be defined as geographic groupings of counties, regional municipalities, and territorial districts, so that the regions are defined by a system or collection of borders that have local administrative importance. In other large provinces, the primary and secondary geographic regions are defined more strictly by topographical and ecological boundaries. In geographically diverse provinces, the secondary regions can be further subdivided into numerous local regions and even sub-regions. British Columbia has a much greater number of local regions and sub-regions than the other provinces and territories due to its mountainous terrain where almost every populated lake, sound, and river valley, and every populated cape and cluster of small islands can claim a distinct geographical identity. At the other extreme, Prince Edward Island is not divided into any widely recognized geographic regions or sub-regions because of its very small size and lack of large rivers or rugged terrain. New Brunswick's small size renders it dividable into local geographic regions only. Several provinces and territories also have supra-municipal administrative regions. Their borders mostly do not harmonize with the geographic regions, so they are not considered subdivisions or groupings of the latter. ===Alberta=== ==== Primary, secondary, and local geographic regions ==== *Northern Alberta (forests that lie mostly north of the North Saskatchewan River) **Alberta Taiga Plains **Alberta Taiga Shield **Alberta Boreal Plain ***Peace River Country (Alberta portion) **Alberta Boreal Shield *Alberta Mountain forests *Southern Alberta (geographic) **Alberta Parkland **Alberta Prairie **Cypress Hills (Alberta portion) ==== Quasi-administrative or demographic regions ==== These regions are not officially considered subdivisions of the larger primary natural regions. *Northern Alberta *Central Alberta **Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor *Southern Alberta *Alberta's Rockies *Calgary Metropolitan Region *Edmonton Metropolitan Region === British Columbia === ==== Primary, secondary, and local geographic regions and subregions ==== *British Columbia Interior **North Interior Taiga Plains **North Interior Boreal Plains/Peace River Country **North Interior Boreal Cordillera ***Atlin District ***Stikine Country **Central Interior Montane Cordillera ***Nechako ***Bulkley ***Omineca\u2013Prince George ***Robson Valley ***Cariboo ****Interlakes ****Fraser Canyon ***Chilcotin **South Interior Montane Cordillera ***Kootenays ****West Kootenay *****Kootenay Lake *****Slocan *****Arrow Lakes ****East Kootenay *****Elk Valley *****Columbia Valley ****Columbia Country *****Big Bend Country ***Okanagan ***Boundary ***Similkameen ***Thompson ****Nicola ****Bonaparte ****Wells Gray\u2013Clearwater ***Shuswap ***Fraser Canyon (overlaps Lillooet Country) ****Bridge River Country *Lower Mainland **Greater Vancouver **Fraser Valley *British Columbia Coast/Pacific Maritime Cordillera **South Coast ***Sea-to-Sky Corridor ***Lillooet Country (overlaps Frazer Canyon region and Sea-to-Sky corridor) ****Pemberton Valley ****Gates Valley ***Sunshine Coast **Central Coast ***Queen Charlotte Strait ***Bella Coola Valley **North Coast ***Haida Gwaii (formerly Queen Charlotte Islands) ***Skeena ***Nass ***Stewart Country *Vancouver Island **South Island ***Greater Victoria ****Saanich Peninsula ****Western Communities ****Juan de Fuca region ***South Central Island (included with an extended Central Island region for some administrative purposes) ****Cowichan Valley ****Chemainus Valley **Central Island ***East Central Island ****East Central Coast (Ladysmith\u2013Nanaimo\u2013Parksville) ****Comox Valley ***West Central Island ****Nootka Sound ****Clayoquot Sound ****Barkley Sound ****Alberni Valley **North Island ***Northwest Island ****Kyuquot Sound ****Quatsino Sound ****Cape Scott ***Northeast Island ****Queen Charlotte Strait ****Johnstone Strait **Gulf Islands ***Southern Gulf Islands ***Northern Gulf Islands === Manitoba === ==== Primary and secondary geographic regions ==== *Northern Manitoba (forests mostly north of the Saskatchewan River and east of Lake Winnipeg) **Hudson Bay Lowlands (Manitoba portion) **Manitoba Taiga Shield **Manitoba Boreal Shield. *Central Manitoba **Interlake (Manitoba Boreal Plain) **Manitoba Parkland *Southern Manitoba (eastern part of Palliser's Triangle) **Central Plains **Eastman **Westman **Winnipeg Capital Region (administrative) **Pembina Valley === New Brunswick === ==== Local geographic regions ==== *Acadian Peninsula *North Shore *Gulf Shore *Fundy Shore *Fundy Isles *Kennebecasis River Valley *Republic of Madawaska *Miramichi Valley *Saint John Valley *Tantramar *Greater Shediac *Greater Moncton *Greater Saint John *Greater Fredericton === Newfoundland and Labrador === ==== Primary, secondary, and local geographic regions ==== *Labrador **Labrador Arctic Cordillera **Labrador Taiga Shield ***Labrador West ***Nunatsiavut **Labrador Boreal Shield *Newfoundland **Avalon Peninsula **Burin Peninsula **Bonavista Peninsula **South Coast **West Coast ***Bay of Islands ***Bay St. George ***Bay St. George South ***Port au Port Peninsula **Great Northern Peninsula **Northeast Coast === Northwest Territories === ==== Primary and secondary geographic regions ==== *Arctic Archipelago (N.W.T. portion) *N.W.T.
