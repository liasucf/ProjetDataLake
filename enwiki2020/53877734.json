    "text": "Jonathan Simms (1984 \u2013 5 March 2011) was a man from Belfast, Northern Ireland, who contracted the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in his late teens. His life expectancy post-diagnosis was given as being only one year which is the same as other young people who were diagnosed in the same age bracket. However, due to an experimental treatment (of pentosan polysulfate), he lived for another ten years after diagnosis, although his higher functions were severely limited. ==Life and diagnosis== Simms was born in Belfast in 1984 and was, by all accounts, an athletic teenager who excelled at football and had undergone trials with the Northern Ireland International squad. He initially displayed symptoms between May and September 2001 of a disease which was consistent with either multiple sclerosis or vCJD. The doctor who first examined him, Dr. Mark McClean, later said: > It was either multiple sclerosis or variant C.J.D.; I told them that I > thought it was M.S., because I hoped to God that's what it was. From diagnosis to death (depending on a varying number of circumstances), patients with vCJD are given a life-expectancy of between six months and two years. Simms was given a year to live, however, two years after diagnosis he was the first person with vCJD to be treated with an experimental drug that was known to slow the onset of similar diseases in animals.Rachael Farber, a 21-year old woman from Liverpool was given a drug called Quinacrine to see if this would slow the effects of the disease. Quinacrine was previously used on humans, but for other diseases such as malaria. At the start of her treatment she was bed-ridden, but within three months she was able to walk and swim unaided. However, the treatment was having a profound side effect on her liver and the drug was withdrawn. Farber died as a result of vCJD at the end of 2001. ==Treatment== In December 2002, Simms' parents won a legal battle in the High Court in the United Kingdom for their son to receive an experimental drugThe drug has already been used to relieve cystitis and bladder pain, but in this instance was untested on humans via a direct route into the brain called pentosan polysulphate (PPS). The legal challenge centred around the fact that whilst the drug had been shown to decelerate the onset of the disease in animals, it had not been tested on humans. Eventually, Dame Butler- Sloss ruled in the family's favour stating: The medical community's objection to the use of the drug was that it has traditionally been indicated for its anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory properties, which meant using it in high doses on Simms ran the risk of haemorrhage. This was also clouded by the fact that an effective dose and lethal dose were very close to each other when tested on animals, so there was an inherent risk of killing Simms just by administering the drug. The family were forced to go back to court when the UK ruling was found to have no validity in Northern Ireland, but in January 2003, the High Court in Northern Ireland ruled in favour of the treatment. Whilst the High Court ruling allowed the administering of the drug, the NHS were not legally bound to be the framework by which it was given to Simms. After the ruling, a neurosurgeon was found who would undertake the procedure(s), but the NHS trust that he worked for would not allow it. Because the molecules of PPS are so large, there was no way that an intravenous or pill ingestion would work as the drug would not be able to pass safely between the bloodstream and the brain. Eventually a method of delivery was established with a catheter that went up his body from his stomach directly into his brain. Injections were then administered by this shunt straight to the folds in the patient's brain. By September 2003, it was reported by his primary care team that he had regained the ability to swallow, his body weight had stabilized and returned to normal and that his anxiety levels had decreased. His family were critical that when they first wanted to apply the drug in March 2002, Simms was able to walk and talk for himself. By the time the case had been heard by the courts system, 8 months had elapsed and Simms' condition had deteriorated. In 2007, the treatment appeared to have stabilized Simms and it was announced that he was no longer terminally ill (although the Marie Curie hospice he was due to stay in stated that he no longer fitted their criteria as far back as December 2004). Don Simms (Jonathan's father) said that his son was aware of his surroundings and sometimes \"made attempts at vocalization, and on occasion, we can make out the words\". By 2004, PPS had also been administered to 12 people who also had vCJD, There was one death, some who continued deteriorating and six patients where the disease appeared to have stabilized. ==Death== In the latter stages of his illness, Simms needed intensive care. He was cared for by his family at their home in the Highfield Estate of West Belfast. Simms died on 5 March 2011, almost ten years after his first diagnosis. He was buried on 10 March 2011 at Carnmoney Cemetery just outside north Belfast. ==Notes== ==References== Category:People from Belfast Category:1984 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Medical controversies in Ireland Category:Deaths from Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease ",
