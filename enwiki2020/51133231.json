    "text": "The Serenity of Suffering is the twelfth studio album by American nu metal band Korn. It was released on October 21, 2016. According to guitarist Brian Welch, it is \"heavier than anyone's heard us in a long time\" and it contains their most intense vocals and music in recent times. ==Background== The band began working on their follow up to The Paradigm Shift in 2015, with Head claiming that it would be \"heavier than anyone's heard [us] in a long time\". It's the first album to feature significant songwriting contributions from Head since he rejoined the band in 2013. The song \"Take Me\" was originally written by Jonathan Davis for his debut solo album, but after hearing it, the rest of Korn re-wrote the track and decided to include it on The Serenity of Suffering. The artwork includes the stuffed toy from Korn's fourth album, Issues, and was created by Ron English. == Commercial performance == The Serenity of Suffering debuted at number 4 on the US Billboard 200 with 57,000 units, 55,000 of which were pure album sales. As of December 2017, the album has sold 133,000 copies in the US. == Reception == The Serenity of Suffering received an approval rating of 67/100 on review aggregator website Metacritic based on nine reviews, indicating a \"generally favorable\" response from critics. AllMusic wrote: \"Without pandering to career-peak nostalgia, Korn deftly execute all the hallmarks that have come to define their sound\", calling it \"one of their best albums\". Metal Hammer wrote: \"The Serenity of Suffering is like a selection box of Korn's defining moments.\" A less favorable review came from Rolling Stone, writing: \"Suffering is heavy enough to stand proudly in the Korn kanon, but not daring enough to be much else.\" == Track listing == == Personnel == Korn * Jonathan Davis \u2013 lead vocals * James \"Munky\" Shaffer \u2013 rhythm and lead guitars, backing vocals * Brian \"Head\" Welch \u2013 lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals * Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu \u2013 bass * Ray Luzier \u2013 drums Additional musicians * Corey Taylor \u2013 guest vocals on \"A Different World\" * Zac Baird \u2013 keyboards on \"Take Me\" * Jules Venturini \u2013 programming * Nick \"Sluggo\" Suddarth \u2013 programming * Rick Norris \u2013 additional programming * C-Minus \u2013 turntables on \"Insane\", \"A Different World\", \"Next in Line\", and \"Calling Me Too Soon\" Production * Nick Raskulinecz \u2013 producer * Josh Wilbur \u2013 mixing, mastering * Nathan Yarborough \u2013 engineering * Chris Collier \u2013 additional engineering * Paul Suarez \u2013 assistant mix engineering * Justin Warfield \u2013 additional vocal arrangement * Dave Rath - A&R; * Ron English \u2013 illustrations * Virgilio Tzaj \u2013 art direction, design == Charts == === Weekly charts === {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 42 |- |- |- |- |- |} === Year-end charts === {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) | 45 |} == References == == External links == * The Serenity of Suffering at Korn.com Category:2016 albums Category:Korn albums Category:Roadrunner Records albums Category:Albums produced by Nick Raskulinecz ",
