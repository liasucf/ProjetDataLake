    "text": "\"Teeth \" is a song by Australian pop rock band 5 Seconds of Summer, released on 21 August 2019 as the second single from the band's fourth studio album Calm. It is also included on the third season soundtrack of the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why. The track was written by band members Luke Hemmings and Ashton Irwin with Ali Tamposi. Irwin, Hemmings, and Andrew Watt produced the song. It features guitar from Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and its music video was released the same day. Similarly to the band's previous single \"Easier\", an alternate \"Live from the Vault\" version of the song was released. \"Teeth \u2013 Live from the Vault\" was released on 29 October 2019 and was accompanied by a video directed by Thibaut Duverneix. At the APRA Music Awards of 2020, \"Teeth\" was nominated for Song of the Year. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2020, \"Teeth\" was nominated for Song of the Year. ==Promotion== The song was announced on the band's social media on 16 August 2019, along with a 15-second teaser that Alternative Press called \"ominous\". The song was used as the official theme song for WWE Survivor Series 2019 in addition to appearing in ESPN's 2019 Saturday Night Football season. ==Critical reception== Billboard wrote that the song \"sees the group venturing even further into the industrial sounds and themes the band began to explore with previous release 'Easier'\". Rolling Stone described the song as \"industrial pop\" and noted that it \"culls from the same well of brooding, ominous industrial rock and nu-metal that inspired their Nine Inch Nails-inspired 'Easier.'\" ==Music video== The music video, directed by Thibaut Duverneix, was also released on 21 August 2019. It features the band \"subjected to an experiment-gone-wrong resulting in each member's personal hellscape\". The video was called \"dark\" and \"creepy\" by Rolling Stone. It starts with the 4 members in what seems to be like a dentist's office. In their dreams, the members attempt to escape their hellscape and succeed. Luke is in a foggy room, Ashton is in a room where the walls are made of linen blown by a big fan, Calum tries to pull a big brick using chains, and Michael climbs a tall ladder. As of September 2020 the music video has over 52 million views. == Live performances == The song was performed live for the first time on 11 September 2019 as part of the band's stripped back show at 97.1 AMP Radio's SoCal Honda Sound Stage Pop Up. The next day, on 12 September 2019, it was performed on The Late Late Show with James Corden. The song was also performed live on A Little Late with Lilly Singh and was part of the band's setlist for the World War Joy Tour. On 7 October 2019, the song was performed on ESPN Monday Night Football Genesis Halftime Show, with the accompanying performance video being released the same day. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019\u20132020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia Digital Song Sales (Billboard) | 10 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|Canada Digital Song Sales (Billboard) | 10 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Estonia (Eesti Ekspress) | 40 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Israel (Media Forest) | 27 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (LAIPA) | 26 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 18 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Singapore (RIAS) | 18 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|US Digital Song Sales (Billboard) | 13 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 85 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Venezuela Anglo (Record Report) | 25 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Artist (ARIA) | 15 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) | 49 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 881 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | 21 August 2019 | | rowspan=\"2\"| Interscope | |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | 17 September 2019 | rowspan=\"2\"| Contemporary hit radio | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy | 18 October 2019 | Universal | |} ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:5 Seconds of Summer songs Category:Industrial songs Category:Songs written by Ali Tamposi Category:Songs written by Andrew Watt (musician) Category:Songs written by Bernard Sumner Category:Songs written by Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers Category:Songs written by Gillian Gilbert Category:Songs written by Louis Bell Category:Songs written by Peter Hook Category:Songs written by Ryan Tedder Category:Songs written by Stephen Morris (musician) ",
