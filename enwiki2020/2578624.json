    "text": "Quinoa is not a grass. Its seeds have been eaten for 6,000 years. A pseudocereal is one of any non-grasses that are used in much the same way as cereals (true cereals are grasses). Their seed can be ground into flour and otherwise used as cereals. Examples of pseudocereals are amaranth (Love-lies- bleeding, red amaranth, Prince-of-Wales-feather), quinoa, and buckwheat. == Common pseudocereals == * Amaranth (Love-lies-bleeding, Red amaranth, Prince- of-Wales-feather) * Breadnut * Buckwheat * Chia * Cockscomb (also called quail grass or soko) * Pitseed Goosefoot * Ca\u00f1ahua * Quinoa * Wattleseed (also called acacia seed) ==Production== The following table shows the annual production of some pseudocereals in 1961,1961 is the earliest year for which FAO statistics are available. 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 ranked by 2013 production. {| valign=\"top\" | class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=2 | Grain ! colspan=5 nowrap | Worldwide production (millions of metric tons) ! rowspan=2 | Notes |- ! 1961 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 |- | Buckwheat | align=\"center\" | 2.5 | align=\"center\" | 1.4 | align=\"center\" | 2.3 | align=\"center\" | 2.3 | align=\"center\" | 2.5 | A pseudocereal in the family Polygonaceae that is used in Eurasia and to a minor degree the United States and Brazil.
