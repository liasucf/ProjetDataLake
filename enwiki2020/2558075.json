    "text": "The GE Dash 8-32B (also classified as B32-8 or D8-32B by some railroad companies) is a 4-axle road switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems between 1984 and 1989. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives. A total of 49 examples of the Dash 8-32B model were built for North American railroads. The model is a 12-cylinder version of the (16 cylinder) Dash 8-40B and is powered by GE's 7FDL engine. The first units built for the Burlington Northern Railroad were labelled by GE as B32-8, while later units built for Norfolk Southern followed GE's practice after 1987 of spelling \"Dash 8\" in the model name. The GE Dash 8-32BWH (or B32-8WH) is a variant built with Head End Power (HEP) and a wide cab for Amtrak service. In 2013, Norfolk Southern donated B32-8 number 3563 to the Lake Shore Railway Historical Society of North East, Pennsylvania. Then, in May 2017, the Everett Railroad purchased Dash 8-32B number 561 (formerly 3561) from Norfolk Southern. As of June 2016, all units still on the roster are pending disposition. == Original owners == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#c0c090;\" | Railroad ! style=\"background:#c0c090;\" | Quantity ! style=\"background:#c0c090;\" | Road numbers ! style=\"background:#c0c090;\" | Notes |- |Burlington Northern Railroad |3 |5497-5499 |Returned to GE |- |General Electric (demonstrator/testbed) |1 |832 |- |Norfolk Southern |45 |3522-3566 |Units were renumbered to the 500 series in September and October 2013. 3563 was retired after an engine failure, and was donated to the Lake Shore Railway Historical Society. 561 (ex-3561) was sold to the Everett Railroad, and delivered by NS Local CB-10 on May 25th, 2017. |} ==See also== *List of GE locomotives == References == * * * Dash 8-32B Category:B-B locomotives Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of the United States Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1984 Category:Freight locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States ",
