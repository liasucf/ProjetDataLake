    "text": "Vanderlei Luxemburgo da Silva (born 10 May 1952), known as Vanderlei Luxemburgo, is a Brazilian football manager and former player. A left wingback, Luxemburgo represented Flamengo, Internacional and Botafogo before retiring in 1980. He subsequently became a manager, and led Palmeiras, Corinthians, Cruzeiro and Santos to S\u00e9rie A titles, winning the tournament five times, a record total. In 2005 he worked at Real Madrid, but was dismissed in December of that year. His surname is after revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg. ==Playing career== Born in Nova Igua\u00e7u, Rio de Janeiro, Luxemburgo played the most of his youth football for Botafogo, but made his senior debut with Flamengo in 1972; at the club, he was mainly a backup to J\u00fanior. He left Fla in 1978 to Internacional, but remained at the club for just one year before returning to his first team Botafogo. He retired in 1980, aged 28, due to a knee injury. ==Coaching career== ===Early career=== Before being a first team manager, Luxemburgo spent the rest of the 1980 campaign with Ant\u00f4nio Lopes' Olaria, but not being officially under contract with the club. He was also Lopes' assistant at America-RJ (1981) and Vasco da Gama (1981\u201382). Luxemburgo's first managerial experience occurred in 1983, with Campo Grande; he only lasted eight matches at the club, being sacked after altercations with the board. In the same year, he also managed Rio Branco-ES, winning the Campeonato Capixaba with the side. In 1984, after managing Friburguense, Luxemburgo then moved abroad to Saudi Arabia's Al-Ittihad; initially Joubert's assistant, he was in subsequently charge of the club. He was at the helm of Democrata-GV in the following year, but only lasted three months. Luxemburgo subsequently rejoined Lopes' staff at Fluminense in 1986, where he acted as manager of the under-20 squad. In the following year, he replaced Pinheiro in charge of America-RJ. Another stint in the Middle East following, being again assistant of Joubert at Al-Shabab. Luxemburgo returned to Brazil in October 1988, after being invited to manage Bragantino. At the club, he gained notoriety after winning the 1990 Campeonato Paulista. He subsequently worked at Flamengo, Guarani and Ponte Preta before being hired by Palmeiras in 1993; he led the latter club to both the state and league championships in 1993 and 1994. When Luxemburgo left in 1995 for Flamengo, Palmeiras' performance was visibly affected, and when he came back in 1996 (after a short period at Paran\u00e1), the team won the S\u00e3o Paulo State championship again. After a brief stint at Santos, in 1998 he went to Corinthians and won the league that year. He left the club in the following year, to join the Brazilian national team. Luxemburgo coached Brazil after the 1998 FIFA World Cup until the end of 2000 Olympics. Most notably, he is known for centering his play around Rivaldo. In 1999 the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o won the Copa Am\u00e9rica undefeated. However, he is also remembered for the disastrous performance at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, where Brazil lost 1\u20132 in overtime to gold medal winners Cameroon despite having a two men advantage in that game. He was often blamed at this tournament for leaving out Rom\u00e1rio, who had gone on national television, pleading his case to play in the tournament. In 2001, he went back to Corinthians and won yet another State Championship. In 2003, he led Cruzeiro Esporte Clube to win the Brazilian National League. Even more impressively, the club won two of the three competitions (the Campeonato Mineiro and the Copa do Brasil) without losing a single match. The following year he led Santos to win the Brazilian Championship. Luxemburgo also stirred up controversy by having a one-way transmission device on a forward of his club team during a match. He claimed that the Cameroon match inspired him to create a device in order to tell his players where and when to attack. The CBF ruled days later that such electronic devices were illegal, but did not penalize him for using it in that match. ===Real Madrid=== Luxemburgo was hired as Real Madrid's coach from Santos in the second half of the 2004/2005 season when Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n was dismissed from the job. He led Real Madrid to seven consecutive league wins, putting them back in the title race but ended up losing it four points behind FC Barcelona. In the following season, Real Madrid started brightly. However, the introduction of a new formation (the Magic Rectangle, a 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 formation), combined with multiple injury issues and poor performances began Luxemburgo's downfall. Calls for him to resign were intensified after a humiliating 0\u20133 home defeat to long-time rivals, Barcelona. He was sacked on 5 December 2005, Real Madrid announced Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Caro would be his successor. ===Santos=== Luxemburgo signed, for the third time, a contract with Santos, leading the club to the 2006 S\u00e3o Paulo State Championship and in fourth place of the S\u00e9rie A. He continued with Santos in 2007 and won the S\u00e3o Paulo State Championship again. He also saw Santos through the semi-finals of the 2007 Copa Libertadores, winning all the matches in the group stage and eliminating strong teams, such as Caracas in the round of 16 and Am\u00e9rica in the quarter-finals, before losing to Gr\u00eamio in the semis. Later Luxemburgo finished second in the S\u00e9rie A. In both years, 2006 and 2007, he led Santos to a Copa Libertadores berth. ===Palmeiras return=== At the end of 2007, Luxemburgo left Santos. He signed with Palmeiras in 2008, and won the S\u00e3o Paulo State Championship for the third consecutive time. With Palmeiras he was eliminated from the Sudamericana by Argentinos Juniors and from the Brazilian Cup by Sport Recife the eventual champions. In the 2008 S\u00e9rie A he reached fourth place with Palmeiras in a very competitive season, earning the club a spot in the Libertadores. Luxemburgo remained with Palmeiras in 2009. He managed the team to a successful campaign in the S\u00e3o Paulo State Championship but lost to Santos in the semi-finals. In the Copa Libertadores he conquered a place in the Round of 16 by defeating Colo-Colo 1\u20130 in Santiago, with Cleiton Xavier scoring a last minute long-range goal in the angle of Colo-Colo's goalkeeper. Palmeiras defeated Sport Recife on penalties in the Round of 16, but were eliminated by an away goal from Nacional from Uruguay drawing both matches, by 1\u20131 at home and 0\u20130 away. In the 2009 S\u00e9rie A Luxemburgo started well in the competition, but after an incident involving young striker Keirrison, Luxemburgo was dismissed from Palmeiras in the seventh round of the competition. ===Santos return=== Luxemburgo in 2010 He was re-signed as Head Coach of Santos after a one and a half-year absence on 17 July 2009 and on 7 December 2009 the coach quit Santos, finishing 12th in the league, to sign with Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro. === Return of Flamengo / Gr\u00eamio === On 5 October 2010, Vanderlei Luxemburgo was named as a new head coach of Flamengo, and managed the club until February 2012.
