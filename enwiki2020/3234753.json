At the time, eleven of the constituency's twenty-one councillors were Conservatives followed by the Liberal Democrats who had ten, whereas analysis by Rallings and Thrasher indicated that had the Sefton Central constituency existed in 2005, the result would have been: Labour 45.6%, Conservative 33.6%, LibDem 19.2%, giving a Labour majority of 4,950. Some Conservative campaign billboard posters for the Tory candidate Deborah Jones had been defaced during the 2010 election, as had been the case during the 2005 election in Crosby.Sefton Central Tory candidate billboards defaced BBC News website, April 30, 2010. Accessed 30 December 2011 The Labour Party candidate's majority was 3,862 suggesting a moderate two-party swing. The area covered by this seat and its immediate predecessor Crosby was historically a strong area for the Conservatives. However, since Labour gained that seat in the 1997 election, they have held it with fairly comfortable margins for 20 years. In 2015, an 8.1% swing to Labour saw them take the area with their biggest ever majority of 11,846 votes (24.2%), in accordance with the significant swing to Labour in Merseyside compared to 2010; this margin was surpassed in 2017, as Labour won more than 60% of the vote in the seat and a majority of over 30% for the first time. This suggests that since 2010, Sefton Central has changed from a key marginal between the major parties to a Labour safe seat. ==Constituency profile== The constituency consists of Census Output Areas of a local government district with: a working population whose income is close to the national average and which has close to average reliance on social housing.
