    "text": "Karn\u00f6ffel is a trick-taking card game which probably came from the upper- German language area in Europe in the first quarter of the 15th century. It first appeared listed in a municipal ordinance of N\u00f6rdlingen, Bavaria, in 1426 among the games that could be lawfully played at the annual city f\u00eate. This makes the game the oldest identifiable European card game in the history of playing cards with a continuous tradition of play down to the present day. == Karn\u00f6ffel == The earliest substantial reference to Karn\u00f6ffel is a poem by Meissner, written in or before 1450. In medieval times, the word also meant inguinal hernia.von Leyden, Rudolf. (1978). Karn\u00f6ffel: Das Kartenspiel der Landsknechte. Vienna. Karn\u00f6ffel had a suit in which some cards had a higher priority than cards in other suits, which indicates that it might be a possible precursor to the trump suit of Tarot. Karn\u00f6ffel utilizes a deck of 48 cards, Aces having been removed from German and Swiss playing cards during the 14th or early 15th century. The original game was played with German-suited cards; its present-day descendants are played with Swiss-suited (Kaiserspiel) or French-suited cards (Kn\u00fcffeln, Styrivolt, Brus/Br\u00e4us). One derivative of the game using Swiss-suited cards still played around Stans and in the Engelberg valley in the canton of Nidwalden in Switzerland under the name Kaisern, Kaiserspiel or Kaiserjass, though it is not related to Jass.Kaiserspiel Card Game - Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, pg:139 It is a five-card partnership game of which each deal is won by the first side to win three tricks. Other living descendants, using 48 French- suited cards, are Kn\u00fcffeln, played in Frisia in north Germany, and Styrivolt, played in the Faroe Islands. == Rules == The game was played with a 48-card pack with the following card ranking: :King, Ober, Unter, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (Deuce) === Players === It was played by four players in two teams of two; the partners sitting opposite one another. === Card powers === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#FFEBAD\"| No. ! style=\"background:#FFEBAD\"| * ! style=\"background:#FFEBAD\"| Card ! style=\"background:#FFEBAD\"| Description ! style=\"background:#FFEBAD\" width=\"150\"| Name ! style=\"background:#FFEBAD\" width=\"150\"| Translation |- ! 1 | T | Trump Unter | beats all cards | Karn\u00f6ffel | |- !

The first card is placed face up in front of the respective player, the remaining four cards stay face down. *The lowest of the face up cards determines the trump suit for this deal. If 2 cards have the same rank, the first to be dealt decides the trump suit. Thereafter the players pick their cards up. *The player left of the dealer leads to the first trick; the other players play in clockwise order. *There is no requirement to follow suit. The player with the highest card of the led suit or the highest trump wins the trick and leads to the next. *This continues until one team has taken three tricks and so won the deal. *Players may talk to one another during the game; mutual support is actually encouraged. *The player who led to the first trick becomes the next dealer. == References == == Literature == * Dummett, Michael (1978).
