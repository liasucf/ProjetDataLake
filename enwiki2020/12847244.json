    "text": "Iversen () is a Danish-Norwegian patronymic surname meaning \"son of Iver\", from the Old Norse personal name \u00cdvarr. The Old Norse personal name is composed of the two elements: either \u00edv meaning \"yew tree\", \"bow\" or Ing (an old Germanic God); and the element ar meaning \"warrior\" or \"spear\". Scandinavian immigrants to English-speaking countries often changed the spelling to Iverson in order to accommodate English orthographic rules. ==People== *Baard Iversen (1836\u20131920), Norwegian businessperson and politician *Berthel Michael Iversen (1906\u20131976), Danish architect in Malaysia *Bjarne Iversen (1912\u20131999), Norwegian cross country skier *Bj\u00f8rn Iversen (born 1953), Norwegian politician for the Labour Party *Duke Iversen (1920\u20132011), American football player *Egil Monn-Iversen (1928\u20132017), Norwegian composer *Egil Iversen, Norwegian orienteering competitor *Felix Iversen (1887\u20131973), Finnish mathematician and pacifist *Ivar Iversen (1914\u20132012), Norwegian sprint canoer *Jan Iversen (1916\u20131999), Norwegian politician for the Christian Democratic Party *Johannes Iversen (1904\u20131972), Danish palaeoecologist and plant ecologist *Jon Iversen (1889\u20131964), Danish actor and director *J\u00f8rgen Iversen Dyppel (1638\u20131683), Danish governor of St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies *Julius Iversen (1823\u20131900), Russian phalerist (scholar of medals) *Leif Iversen (1911\u20131989), Norwegian politician for the Conservative Party *Kristen Iversen, American author *Kr\u00e6sten Iversen (1886\u20131955), Danish artist *Niels Kristian Iversen (born 1982), Danish motorcycle speedway rider *Odd Iversen (1945\u20132014), Norwegian soccer player *Ole Iversen (1884\u20131953), Norwegian gymnast, 1908 Summer Olympics *Ragnvald Iversen (1882\u20131960), Norwegian linguist *Steffen Iversen (born 1976), Norwegian football player *Sverre Iversen (1879-1967),Norwegian trade unionist, civil servant and politician *Trond Iversen (born 1976), Norwegian cross country skier *Turid Iversen (born 1934), Norwegian politician for the Conservative Party ==See also== *Ivarson (disambiguation) * ==References== Category:Danish-language surnames Category:Norwegian-language surnames Category:Patronymic surnames ",
