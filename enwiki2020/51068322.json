He was being interviewed by Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy at the British Soap Awards 2016. He said that the episode would only feature the characters of Ste, Harry and Tony; a special constructed episode dubbed a \"three hander\". This was the show's second \"three hander\" stylised episode, the first airing in 2011, which focused on the characters of Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper), Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan). Richardson had revealed that the three-hander would feature his character, going cold turkey. Richardson had stated, \"We were filming for four days, mainly in Tony's flat, and I had to show Ste in a frantic comedown state, so it was pretty exhausting.\" Richardson said in an interview with What's on TV, \"It\u2019s very exciting and intense. We filmed a special episode with just Ste, his boyfriend, Harry [Parry Glasspool] and friend Tony [Nick Pickard] and it was so powerful. I made myself feel poorly for real. It\u2019s unlike any episode of Hollyoaks you\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s a bit of a nod to the film Trainspotting. Harry and Tony are trying to fight for Ste\u2019s life. They lock him in the flat to try and stop him getting more drugs and the comedown is horrific. The audience goes through it all with Ste.\" In an interview with Radio Times, Richardson was worried about the topic being controversial for the show's timeslot, he said \"I am scared. I'm thinking that there might be reshoots because it's too extreme. I've literally gone for it\". ==Reception== \"Episode 4429\" appeared in an article published via Digital Spy. It compiled ten unmissable soap storylines airing the week the episode was broadcast. Their reporter, Kilkelly, warned that viewers could expect harrowing scenes in the episode. Richardson received a considerable amount of praise via the social networking website Twitter. His performance mostly drew an emotional reaction from viewers conversing on the platform. Duncan Lindsay of Metro said \"Hollyoaks is often regarded as the underdog of the soap world \u2013 without much justification \u2013 but continually proves that it can deliver high octane and powerful drama as well as its rivals. The three hander on E4, led by emotive performances from Kieron Richardson, has shown, once more, that it deserves far more credit.\" Lindsay went on to say \"the episode flew by and left us gripped from start to finish.\" While he added \"The effective episode has revealed that Hollyoaks deserves the credit it gets but also highlights that living in the shadows of its equally strong counterparts remains the biggest injustice in the soap world.\" Lindsay had earlier stated \"With secrets from the past coming out, big decisions made and Ste at an all time low, it\u2019s an unmissable visit to Hollyoaks that will answer the following questions. Will Ste come out the other side? Will Harry stand by him? Will the truth about Cameron\u2019s involvement come out?\" Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy stated \"Bravo to Hollyoaks trio Kieron Richardson, Nick Pickard and Parry Glasspool, who pulled some of their most powerful performances out of the bag in their special episode tonight (July 13).\" Carl Greenwood of Daily Mirror stated \"Hollyoaks has made history with its first three-hander episode.\" Greenwood also reported that \"fans praise 'incredible' Kieron Richardson after emotionally powerful performance moves them to tears.\" He also stated, \"Actor Kieron Richardson knocked his performance out of the park as Ste as he veered from begging for help and viciously attacking his loved ones for trying to keep him from getting his next fix.\" The episode has been described as \"a very emotional and hardhitting episode [sic].\" A reporter for Attitude said that \"Things get even darker for 'Starry' in tonight's special episode of the Channel 4 soap.\" Inside Soap included the episode in their \"pick of the day\" feature, with their writer describing \"very disturbing scenes\" and branding it an unmissable episode. They wrote about the episode \"It\u2019s a very special episode of Hollyoaks tonight, with only three actors involved. Tony and Harry spend a night trying to help Ste through his drug withdrawal \u2013 so prepare yourselves for some very disturbing scenes as Ste lashes out at the people who love him. You really mustn\u2019t miss this!\" Rachel McGrath of Huffington Post wrote \"In one of the most emotionally-charged scenes, Ste - spurred on by desperation to feed his habit - attacked Harry, which brought back memories of the violence he put his ex Amy Barnes through.\" ==References== Category:Hollyoaks Category:Hollyoaks episodes Category:2016 British television episodes Category:Three-handers Category:Soap opera episodes Category:Television episodes about drugs ",
