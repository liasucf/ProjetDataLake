It was known as Baxter County Airport until 2005. It changed its name back to Baxter County Airport due to confusion with the close proximity of Ozark, Arkansas and Ozark, Missouri, both of which have airports. The airport used to be served by Lone Star Airlines, which operated services to Dallas-Fort Worth International in the mid-1990s. This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011\u20132015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility.
