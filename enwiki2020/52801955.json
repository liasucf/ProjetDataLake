    "text": "Weightlifting was part of the 2001 National Games of China held in Guangdong. Men competed in eight and women in seven weight classes. The competition program at the National Games mirrors that of the Olympic Games as only medals for the total achieved are awarded, but not for individual lifts in either the snatch or clean and jerk. Likewise an athlete failing to register a snatch result cannot advance to the clean and jerk. ==Medal summary== ===Men=== {| |- |56 kg |Zhang Xiangxiang Fujian ||295 kg |Lan Shizhang Guangxi ||287.5 kg |Wang Xiaowen Hunan ||285 kg |- |62 kg |Su Feixiang Guangdong ||327.5 kg |Le Maosheng Hunan ||325 kg |Shi Zhiyong Fujian ||325 kg |- |69 kg |Zhang Guozheng Yunnan ||352.5 kg |Wan Jianhui Fujian ||340 kg |Liu Huayong Hunan ||337.5 kg |- |77 kg |Li Hongli Guangdong ||370 kg |Zhan Xugang Zhejiang ||365 kg |Xu Qiang Shandong ||340 kg |- |85 kg |Yuan Aijun Jiangsu ||385 kg |Jiang Hairong Guangdong ||365 kg |Ruan Junfa Jiangxi ||357.5 kg |- |94 kg |Qin Guang Jiangxi ||387.5 kg |Tao Yueqiang Anhui ||367.5 kg |Geng Deli Jilin ||365 kg |- |105 kg |Cui Wenhua Jiangsu ||395 kg |Zhang Chongxi Yunnan ||380 kg |Ma Yanfei Hebei ||375 kg |- |105+ kg |Han Wenliang Jilin ||425 kg |Dong Feng Liaoning ||420 kg |Jiang Kai Tianjin ||412.5 kg |} ===Women=== {| |- |48 kg |Wang Mingjuan Hunan ||210 kg |Li Zhuo Liaoning ||202.5 kg |Liu Xiuhua Guangdong ||202.5 kg |- |53 kg |Yang Xia Hunan ||222.5 kg |Han Lijuan PLA ||220 kg |Wang Jingjing Unaffiliated ||217.5 kg |- |58 kg |Song Zhijuan PLA ||250 kg |Li Xuejiu Shanghai ||242.5 kg |Chen Yanqing Jiangsu ||242.5 kg |- |63 kg |Yan Xiaoli Shandong ||257.5 kg |Xiong Meiying Jiangxi ||257.5 kg |Diao Weiwei Finance ||252.5 kg |- |69 kg |Liu Chunhong Shandong ||277.5 kg |Liu Haixia Jilin ||270 kg |Liu Dongping Jiangsu ||262.5 kg |- |75 kg |Sun Ruiping Guangdong ||265 kg |Zhang Ning Anhui ||262.5 kg |Lin Hua Shanghai ||262.5 kg |- |75+ kg |Tang Gonghong Shandong ||312.5 kg |Ding Meiyuan Liaoning ||300 kg |Liu Linqing Anhui ||292.5 kg |} ==Medal table== ==References== *Archived results of the 2001 Games Category:2001 in weightlifting Category:2001 in Chinese sport 2001 ",
