The Republic of Ireland national football team played their first international association football match on 28 May 1924 as the Irish Free State, defeating Bulgaria 1\u20130 at the 1924 Summer Olympics. The Irish Free State side was established following the partition of the country in 1921. Prior to this a unified Irish team had represented the whole of Ireland in international football. As of January 2018, eight Irish international players have scored a hat-trick (three goals) or more in a game. The first player to achieve the feat was Ned Brooks on 16 June 1924 against the United States. Two players have scored four goals during a match, Paddy Moore against Belgium in 1934, the only match which Ireland have failed to win when one of their players has scored a hat-trick, and Don Givens against Turkey in 1975. Other than Brooks, three players have scored a single hat-trick for Ireland, John Joe Flood in 1929, David Kelly on his international debut in 1987 and David Connolly in 1997. Don Givens is also one of three players to have scored more than one hat-trick for Ireland, the others being John Aldridge and Robbie Keane. Keane is the most recent player to have scored a hat-trick for the Republic of Ireland, in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Gibraltar on 11 October 2014. The hat-trick was also Keane's third at the international level, making him the record holder for the most hat-tricks scored for the side. The Republic of Ireland have conceded nine hat-tricks during their history, the first being scored by Karl-Erik Palm\u00e9r in a 1950 FIFA World Cup qualification match on 13 November 1949 against Sweden. No player has ever scored more than three goals against Ireland in a single match. Christian Eriksen of Denmark is the most recent player to score a hat-trick against the Republic of Ireland, in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match. ==Hat-tricks for the Republic of Ireland== ;Key {| class=\"wikitable\" |bgcolor=\"gold\"|More than a hat-trick scored * |} ;Table Wartime internationals, not regarded as official matches, are not included in the list.
