Front plate must be 450 mm long and 100 mm wide. Back plate must be 520 mm long and 110 mm wide, or 275 mm long and 200 mm wide in case it has two lines.http://attt.com.tn/page.php?code_menu=58&code;_p=6 On most vehicles, front plates are larger than what is required, having the legal dimensions of the back plate, which is tolerated by the police. == Series dates == Each series of vehicle registration refers to a year and hence its age. However, there is no rule and this depends on how many vehicles have been registered in a specific year. For example, series can last more than a whole year if less than 9999 vehicles are registered. But since in Tunisia an average of 50,000 new vehicles are registered each year, five series of number plates are issued. Late 140 series or early 141 series are expected by the end of 2009. * 2008: 136, 135, 134, 133, 132 and 131. * 2009: 140, 139, 138, 137, 136 ==References== ==External links== * Tunisia on worldlicenseplates.com Tunisia Category:Transport in Tunisia Category:Tunisia transport-related lists ",
