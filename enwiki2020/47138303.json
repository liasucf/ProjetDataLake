In February 2015, Allan was loaned to Dunfermline Athletic, making eight appearances before returning from his loan at the end of March 2015. In August 2015, Allan was loaned to Forfar Athletic until the end of the 2015\u201316 season, however his loan was cut short when he had to have a bone cyst removed from his thoracic spine. In August 2016, Allan once again returned to a Scottish League One club on loan, this time with West Lothian side Livingston. After making just three appearances as a substitute and with further appearances likely being restricted, Allan returned to Hibernian at the start of October 2016. On 31 January 2017, Allan moved out on loan, this time to Scottish League Two side Edinburgh City. Allan subsequently re-joined Edinburgh City on a six-month development loan deal on 6 July 2017. Allan was released by Hibernian in May 2019. He then signed a contract with Raith Rovers on 2 July 2019. Berwick Rangers announced the signing of Allan on 14 September 2020. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Scottish Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Hibernian |2014\u201315 |Scottish Championship |1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2015\u201316 |Scottish Championship |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearances in the Scottish Challenge Cup||0||1||0 |- |2016\u201317 |Scottish Championship |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014 |- |2017\u201318 |Scottish Premiership |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014 |- |2018\u201319 |Scottish Premiership |6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !7!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!8!!0 |- |Dunfermline Athletic (loan) |2014\u201315 |Scottish League One |8||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||0 |- |Forfar Athletic (loan) |2015\u201316 |Scottish League One |7||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||1 |- |Livingston (loan) |2016\u201317 |Scottish League One |3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||4||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Edinburgh City (loan) |2016\u201317 |Scottish League Two |14||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||4 |- |2017\u201318 |Scottish League Two |11||1||1||0||3||0||1||0||16||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !25!!5!!1!!0!!3!!0!!1!!0!!30!!5 |- | rowspan=\"2\"| Hibernian Under-20s |- |colspan=\"2\"|2018\u201319 |colspan=\"6\"|\u2014||1||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career Total !50!!6!!1!!0!!4!!0!!4!!0!!59!!6 |} ==References== Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Galashiels Category:Sportspeople from the Scottish Borders Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Hibernian F.C. players Category:Dunfermline Athletic F.C. players Category:Forfar Athletic F.C. players Category:Livingston F.C. players Category:Edinburgh City F.C. players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Raith Rovers F.C. players ",
