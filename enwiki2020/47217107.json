Leo (Louis Cheung) is the owner and popular fitness instructor of \"See See Fitness\", his long-time girlfriend Wan Si Si (Priscilla Wong) manages all the staff, clerical, legal and accounting work for his business which puts him at ease to concentrate on his clients. Though Leo feels their relationship is steady, Si Si often feels insecure and neglected by Leo since they have been together for so long and she has no legal status. While witnessing an employee going through a nasty divorce, Si Si fears that Leo will leave her one-day and secretly has her lawyer draw up documents so she can have half of Leo's business without him knowing. After being reminded by a friend, Leo realizes all the support Si Si has given him without him knowing and shows his appreciation. Feeling at ease, Si Si shreds her lawyer's documents. Anson (Owen Cheung) has just returned to Hong Kong after studying yoga in India. He wants to work as a yoga instructor at \"See See Fitness\", but his family eagerly wants him to take over their dry seafood business. His first day at the family shop, he uses his allergic reaction to the shop's pet cat as an excuse on why he can't be at the shop. His father Lun Bak Fuen (Evergreen Mak), knowing Anson set up the cat to go near him gives him a year and half to pursue his interest, but makes Anson promise that after the year and half have past he must take over the family business since the shop's cat will past its life expectancy by then and there won't be any excuses why Anson can't be at the shop.
