    "text": "Elections in Morocco are held on a national level for the legislature. Parliament has two chambers. The Assembly of Representatives of Morocco (Somalis AL-Nuwab/Assembl\u00e9e des R\u00e9presentants) has 325 members elected for a five-year term, 295 elected in multi-seat constituencies and 30 in national lists consisting only of women. The Assembly of Councillors (Majlis al- Mustasharin) has 120 members, elected for a six-year term, elected by local councils (162 seats), professional chambers (91 seats) and wage-earners (27 seats). Morocco has had a multi-party system since independence in 1955, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. Since Morocco considers Western Sahara as part of its territory and administers large parts of it, the elections are also held there. ==Voters== Voters are Morrocan citizens aged 18 and registered on the electoral lists. That being said, not all Moroccan citizens can vote, only Morrocan citizens living in Morocco are able to do so. ==2006 fraud affair== On October 2006, as many as 67 people were arrested for election fraud allegations related to the September 8, 2006 polls. 17 MPs among 67 held for election fraud in Morocco Among them there were 17 lawmakers (12 from the Assembly of Councillors and 5 from the Assembly of Representatives). It was the first time the Moroccan government made such arrests. ==Latest elections== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em left 1em auto; text-align:right;\" | |align=\"left\"|Party |align=\"left\"|Seats |align=\"left\"|Seats % |align=\"left\"|Seat change |align=\"left\"|Votes |align=\"left\"|Votes % |- |bgcolor=#0000FF | |align=\"left\"| Justice and Development Party||80||X||align=\"center\"| 34|||| |- |bgcolor=#FF00FF | |align=\"left\"|Istiqlal Party||45||X||align=\"center\"| 7|||| |- |bgcolor=#2B65EC | |align=\"left\"| National rally of independents||38||X||align=\"center\"| 1|||| |- |bgcolor=#000080 | |align=\"left\"| Authenticity and Modernity Party||33||X||align=\"center\"| 33|||| |- |bgcolor=#FF00000| |align=\"left\"| Socialist Union of Popular Forces||29||X||align=\"center\"| 9|||| |- |bgcolor=#808000 | |align=\"left\"| Popular movement||22||X||align=\"center\"| 19|||| |- |bgcolor=#FF66000 | |align=\"left\"| Constitutional Union||15||X||align=\"center\"| 12|||| |- |bgcolor=#00FFF | |align=\"left\"| Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS)||11||X||align=\"center\"| 6|||| |- |bgcolor=#FF555 | |align=\"left\"| Labour party||2||X||align=\"center\"| 3|||| |- |bgcolor=#FFFF00 | |align=\"left\"| Party of Renewal and Equity||2||X||align=\"center\"| 2|||| |- |bgcolor=#916F6F | |align=\"left\"| Democratic and Social Movement (MDS)||2||X||align=\"center\"| 7|||| |- |bgcolor=#00FF00 | |align=\"left\"| Environment and Development Party||2||X||align=\"center\"| 3|||| |- |bgcolor=#FF2A2A | |align=\"left\"| Al Ahd ||2||X||align=\"center\"| 12|||| |- |bgcolor=#C83737 | |align=\"left\"| Front of Democratic Forces||1||X||align=\"center\"| 8|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Action Party (PA)||1||X||align=\"center\"| 1|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Union and Democracy Party (PUD)||1||X||align=\"center\"| 1|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Party of Liberty and Social Justice (PLJS)||1||X||align=\"center\"| 1|||| |- |bgcolor=#008000 | |align=\"left\"| Green Left Party ||1||X||align=\"center\"| 1|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Socialist Party (PS)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Moroccan Union for Democracy (UMD)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Citizens' Forces (PFC)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Party of Renaissance and Virtue (PRV)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| National Congress Party (PCNI)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Moroccan Liberal Party (PLM)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Social Centre Party (PCS)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Reform and Development Party (PRD)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| National Democratic Party||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Party of Hope (PE)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Democratic Society Party (PSD)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Democratic Independence Party (PDI)||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Independents||X||X||align=\"center\"|X|||| |- |bgcolor=#E3DBDB | |align=\"left\"| Total (turnout 45%)||288/395||73%|||||| |- |} source: ==See also== *Elections in Western Sahara *Electoral calendar *Electoral system ==External links== *Adam Carr's Election Archive ==References and sources== ",
