    "text": "The South Finegayan Latte Stone Park is a small public park and archaeological site at 74 Golden Shower Lane in Dededo, Guam. Located in the United States Navy housing area known as Finegayan, it encompasses the remains of a latte stone house site, which are the only remnants of a once-extensive Chamorro village in the area. Radiocarbon dating and other evidence place the occupation period at this site at c. 1700, and for only a relatively short period of time (about 100 years). The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Guam ==References== Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Guam Category:Protected areas established in 1975 Category:1975 establishments in Guam ",
