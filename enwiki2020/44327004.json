The company was formed in 1992 by Tony Andrews and John Newsham. It is known as an \"industry standard\" designer and manufacturer of high quality loudspeaker systems for venues like dance clubs or festivals. Funktion-One Systems are notably in use at Berghain (Berlin), Sisyphos (Berlin), Space (Ibiza), Jaeger (Oslo), Cocoric\u00f2 (Riccione), Cielo (New York), Hot Mass (Pittsburgh), The Block (Salt Lake City), \u00c9cole Priv\u00e9e (Montreal), Smartbar (Chicago), Studio 50/80 (Trier), Colosseum (Jakarta), Shelter (Amsterdam) and De School (Amsterdam), some of the most renowned clubs worldwide. ==History== The company was formed in 1992 by Tony Andrews and John Newsham, following their departure from Turbosound - a company focused on sound systems for music festivals they had started in 1978. Following eight years of research and development, Funktion-One completed its first major project - designing and installing a sound system for the Millennium Dome's Central Show. Since then the company has built a reputation in audio around the world. According to Andrews, the company's name spells \"funktion\" with a \"k\" as a reference to 1970s funk music. Funktion-One equipment, installed by Sound Investment Audio, is in use at many music venues in the United States. ==Notable projects== 2000: Millennium Dome, London, England Funktion-One were chosen to provide the sound system for the Millennium Dome's Central Show. This was the first official installation of a Funktion-One system - and the debut of the company's Resolution Series of speakers. 2002-2014: Space, Ibiza Funktion- One's relationship with Space began in 2002, following a recommendation from We Love... promoter Darren Hughes. After an initial installation on the club's Terrace, Funktion-One systems were gradually introduced to five of the venue's six rooms - including the 2,000-capacity main space, known as La Discoteca. 2003: Cielo, New York, USA Cielo nightclub marked the first US sound installation by Funktion-One. Located in the Meatpacking District of Downtown New York, on opening, the main room featured an AX88 double 8\" passive loud speakers, Infra Bass Sub Enclosures and F218 double 18\" subwoofers. 2004: Berghain, Berlin, Germany Berghain is one of the company's biggest club installs in the world, and the first in Berlin. At its launch, the sound system comprised four Funktion-One Dance Stacks (consisting of a DS210, a DS215 and three F218), one Double Infrahorn (consisting of two Infrabass, one Doublehorn Extension), and two Resolution 2 for monitoring. The system was installed by Benedikt Koch of Funktion-One Germany, who has stated that - as one of the most powerful club systems in the world - it operates at only 10 to 20 percent of its full capacity. 2018: Volgograd Arena World Cup Stadium Funktion-One Russia supplied and installed a permanent state of the art sound system for Volgograd Arena \u2014 one of the Russian World Cup 2018 stadia. Working closely with the Funktion-One design team in the UK, the company specified a system that features 638 Funktion-One loudspeakers and 50 MC2 Audio amplifiers. == Products == \u2022 Resolution Series (introduced 2000) \u2022 Dance Stack (introduced 2002) \\- originally designed for Maze nightclub in Miami \u2022 Evolution Series (introduced 2015) \u2022 Vero (introduced 2016) - a large format touring sound system ==References== Category:British companies established in 1992 Category:1992 establishments in England Category:Companies based in Surrey Category:Loudspeaker manufacturers Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United Kingdom ",
