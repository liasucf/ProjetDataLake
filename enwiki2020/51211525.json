    "text": "James Hendren (17 July 1885 \u2013 17 June 1915) was a Scottish professional football centre forward who made over 120 appearances in the Scottish League for Hibernian. He also played for Nithsdale Wanderers, Kilmarnock and Cowdenbeath. == Personal life == Hendren worked as a miner in Ayrshire and later emigrated to the USA. He returned to Scotland to resume his football career and he enlisted as a driver in the Army Service Corps after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Hendren was allowed to delay his enlistment, as his wife had just given birth to their second child. Just over a month after his final appearance for Hibernian, Hendren died of acute pneumonia at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh on 17 June 1915. His great- nephew is former Hibernian and Celtic footballer Pat Stanton. == Honours == * Cowdenbeath Hall of Fame == Career statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |Scottish Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |Kilmarnock |1904\u201305 |Scottish First Division |4 |0 |0 |0 |4 |0 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Cowdenbeath |1910\u201311 | rowspan=\"2\" |Scottish Second Division |15 |5 |5 |0 |20 |5 |- |1911\u201312 |3 |0 |0 |0 |3 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !18 !5 !5 !0 !23 !5 |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Hibernian |1911\u201312 | rowspan=\"4\" |Scottish First Division |23 |3 |0 |0 |23 |3 |- |1912\u201313 |32 |18 |5 |2 |37 |20 |- |1913\u201314 |32 |18 |7 |1 |39 |19 |- |1914\u201315 |36 |14 |0 |0 |36 |14 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !123 !53 !12 !3 !135 !56 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !145 !58 !17 !3 !162 !61 |} ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1915 deaths Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Nithsdale Wanderers F.C. players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Cowdenbeath F.C. players Category:Hibernian F.C. players Category:Sportspeople from Fife Category:Scottish expatriates in the United States Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Scottish miners Category:Scottish people of Irish descent Category:Royal Army Service Corps soldiers ",
