The Polish embassy occupies a purpose-built building of modernist design, incorporating Polish national motifs which is sited on a special diplomatic compound just outside Moscow's 'Garden Ring'. The compound is, in accordance with diplomatic protocol, considered part of the territory of the Polish Republic; for this reason the ambassador's residence as well as apartments for a number of other diplomatic staff are located there, alongside the chancery and consular buildings. In 2005, the embassy has been the location of at least one protest against the policies of the Polish government. The embassy served as the primary target for groups wishing to express their disagreement with the directives of the late president Lech Kaczy\u0144ski. The current ambassador of Poland to Russia is W\u0142odzimierz Marciniak. The previous ambassador, Katarzyna Pe\u0142czy\u0144ska-Na\u0142\u0119cz, presented her credentials to president Vladimir Putin at an official reception in the Moscow Kremlin on 19 November 2014.
