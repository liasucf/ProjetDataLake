    "text": "Kirk James Hinrich ( born January 2, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player. He has also been a member of the USA National Team. Growing up in Sioux City, Iowa, Hinrich was exposed to basketball at an early age. His father, Jim, coached him from the third grade through high school. As a high school senior, Hinrich was named the 1999 Co-Iowa Mr. Basketball, along with future college teammate and roommate Nick Collison. Hinrich originally committed to play basketball at Iowa State but when the coach at the time, Tim Floyd, took the head coaching position for the NBA's Chicago Bulls, Hinrich changed his mind and decided to attend the University of Kansas. Hinrich helped Kansas to consecutive Final Fours in 2002 and 2003, his junior and senior seasons. He was drafted by the Chicago Bulls with the seventh pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, where he earned the nickname \"Captain Kirk\". Hinrich is the Bulls' all-time leader in three-point field goals.Chicago Bulls Career Leaders Retrieved February 19, 2010 After seven seasons with the Bulls, he had short stints with the Washington Wizards and Atlanta Hawks before returning to the Bulls in 2012. In 2016, he was traded back to the Atlanta Hawks. ==Early life== Hinrich was born to Jim and Nancy Hinrich of Sioux City, Iowa. His father played basketball at Briar Cliff College and later became a coach for Sioux City West High School. When Hinrich was about seven years old, Jim Hinrich visited Ray Nacke, his old college coach, and asked if Kirk could enroll in Nacke's summer camp for fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. Despite Nacke's hesitations, Hinrich was allowed to attend the camp, and played well against the older children. After just two years, Hinrich advanced to Nacke's camp for young teenagers, and excelled there, as well. Hinrich also played football at the quarterback position, and baseball as a pitcher. However, basketball was Hinrich's passion. His role model was Seattle SuperSonics star Gary Payton, a player known for his strong defense. With his father as coach, Hinrich's basketball team at Sioux City West High School achieved an 82\u20139 record over four years, and won the Iowa state championship when Hinrich was a senior. When he graduated, Hinrich was West High's all-time leader in points, steals, and assists. ==College career== As a freshman with the University of Kansas Jayhawks, Hinrich tallied 123 assists and received the Clyde Lovellette Most Improved Player Award. The next year, he ranked eighth in the nation in assists per game (6.9), led his team in steals, and set a Kansas Jayhawks record with a .505 three-point shooting mark. Hinrich was also voted onto the Associated Press All-Big 12 Second Team and earned All Third Team status from the NCAA coaches. In his fourth and final season at Kansas, Hinrich, along with power forward Nick Collison, led the Jayhawks to the Final Four, and was voted onto the All-Big 12 Second Team by coaches and the media. He led his team in free throw shooting and three-point shooting, contributed 5.0 assists per game and received Kansas' Ted Owens Defensive Player Award. Kansas lost to Syracuse in the championship Game but Hinrich was named the Midwest Region's Most Outstanding Player. He ranked second on his team in scoring and led it in three-pointers, while also contributing 3.5 assists per game, 3.9 rebounds per game and 1.9 steals a game. Following the season, he was named a third-team All-American by the Associated Press. On March 1, 2009, Kansas retired Hinrich's number 10 jersey and raised it to the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse. Hinrich's was just the 25th jersey to be retired by Kansas and is an honor reserved for the highest caliber of player, which includes names like Wilt Chamberlain and Paul Pierce. Hinrich was quoted as saying: ==Professional career== ===Chicago Bulls (2003\u20132010)=== ====2003 draft==== Hinrich was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 2003 NBA draft with the seventh overall pick, resulting in mild surprise because he had been expected to be a mid to late first-round draft pick. Some doubted that his college game would translate successfully to the professional league, in part because he played shooting guard for his final two years in college and was considered too small to play that position professionally. Hinrich's high selection in the draft is credited to a good workout in front of NBA team scouts. The Bulls needed a point guard, as Jay Williams was severely injured in a motorcycle accident. After being picked by the Bulls, Hinrich said he knew they had a need at point guard: ====2003\u201304 season==== Hinrich suffered an acute viral infection shortly before the beginning of his first season, requiring months to fully recover. However, he played well after his recovery, showing a continued good grasp of fundamental skills, solid playmaking, leadership, and a surprising defensive intensity. He solidified his position as the Bulls' starting point guard and was named to the NBA's 2004 All-Rookie first team. He held the distinction for being the only rookie during that season to record a triple- double, with 11 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists versus the Golden State Warriors on February 28, 2004. During this same season, Hinrich's shot accuracy inside the three-point line (38.6 percent on field goals) was actually poorer than from behind it (39.0 percent on three-pointers). Hinrich was named to the NBA's \"Got Milk? All-Rookie First Team\" along with Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Bosh. He was also awarded the Bulls' Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award or Player of the Year award (POY) for the 2003\u201304 season. ====2004\u201305 season==== In his second year, Hinrich's field goal percentage went up to .397, a marginal improvement. Hinrich is known for his intense on-court demeanor; he was involved in a minor scuffle between the Bulls and the Washington Wizards in the preseason of his second year in the league, for which he was fined $10,000. On a drive to the basket, then Wizards player Larry Hughes head butted Hinrich out of bounds, which prompted Bulls players Antonio Davis and Eddy Curry to get into a small fight with Wizards center Brendan Haywood. Hughes, Haywood, Curry and Davis were all suspended at least one game by the NBA. The Bulls later met the Wizards in the first round of the playoffs and the possible start of a rivalry was born. Though he began his second year as the team's starting point guard, he was moved to the shooting guard spot nine games into the season due to the team's 0\u20139 start. Ben Gordon was moved to the bench, as the Bulls' sixth man. The player who took over the starting point guard spot was rookie Chris Duhon. After this move was made, the Bulls started to gain team chemistry and the starting line- up was geared more towards defense, with Gordon coming off the bench to spark the team's scoring. The Bulls then made a run throughout the rest of the season to finish 47\u201335, becoming the first team ever to start off 0\u20139 and reach the playoffs, where they earned the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference. After winning the first two games of their series with the Washington Wizards, they lost the next four, including a last-second loss at home in game 5, and were eliminated. During the off-season the Bulls exercised the fourth-year option on Hinrich's contract, making him signed through the 2006\u201307 season. Hinrich improved in virtually every statistical category in 2004\u201305, including scoring (15.8 ppg), shooting (just under 40 percent from the field), rebounding (3.9 rpg) and defense (122 steals). ====2005\u201306 season==== In his third year in the NBA, Hinrich's field-goal percentage went up to 41%, although his three-point shooting accuracy fell to 35%. His career free throw shooting average is 80.5%, making him one of the better free throw shooters on the Bulls. The team traded away Antonio Davis and Eddy Curry in the off-season and the team struggled until making a late-season run to gain the seventh seed in the playoffs where they faced the eventual champs, the Miami Heat, in the first round. It was in the third game of the series that the Heat's James Posey shoulder tackled Hinrich, as he ran the fastbreak. Hinrich ended the 2005\u201306 season averaging a career high 15.9 ppg, a team-high 6.4 apg, and 3.6 rpg, while shooting a career high 41.8% from the field and a then career high 81.5% from the free throw line. He was the only member of the Chicago Bulls to average more than one steal per game in the 2005\u201306 campaign. Hinrich received a multi-year contract extension on October 31, 2006, which was the deadline for the deal. (Otherwise Hinrich would have become a restricted free agent). Bulls GM John Paxson was quoted as saying, ====2006\u201307 season==== Hinrich improved his stats in shooting and scoring during the 2006\u201307 season, his fourth in the NBA, with career highs in field goal, 3-point field goal, and free throw shooting percentage, as well as a career high 16.6 ppg. However, Hinrich's assists average was the lowest of his career and he also grabbed the fewest rebounds per game of his career. In a game against the Miami Heat, Dwyane Wade injured his wrist while being defended by Hinrich. Heat coach Pat Riley suggested that Hinrich injured Dwyane Wade's wrist on purpose. Hinrich was then played a recording of what Riley said; his response was candid, as he responded by saying When Hinrich's teammate Ben Gordon heard Riley's comments, he came to his defense stating \"I heard him saying something about Kirk. Posey's was way more blatant. I don't think Kirk did anything. He was just playing aggressive defense. Kirk didn't do anything dirty. I don't appreciate him taking shots at our guys.\" Sports Illustrated columnist Chris Mannix called Riley's comments \"on the border of hypocrisy\" while maintaining that Hinrich's grab of Wade's wrist, while illegal, was not a dirty play. \"For starters, the play itself hardly qualifies as dirty. That was not the word Riley chose, but it was certainly what he insinuated. Illegal, yes. But dirty?\" \"Hinrich had no intention of hurting Wade. He didn't grab his wrist and twist it. He didn't chop down on it with his other hand.\" He went on to describe plays like that commonplace in the NBA, while calling Posey's foul on Hinrich during the 2006 playoffs dirty. \"Dirty was the cheap shot that James Posey delivered to Hinrich when he leveled the guard with a body check during last season's playoffs.\" Riley later had a different view on his comments; the next time the Bulls and Heat played Riley was questioned about the comments he made by a reporter. During the Bulls' first game of the 2007 playoffs against the Miami Heat, Hinrich threw his mouthpiece into the stands after being assessed a charging foul. Hinrich received a technical foul for his actions as well as a $25,000 fine. Technically Hinrich should have been ejected from the game but he was allowed to stay in. Bulls coach Scott Skiles was quoted as saying \"What Kirk did the other (day), that's supposed to be an automatic ejection. They didn't see it. Hopefully, nothing like that happens again.\" The Bulls went on to sweep the Heat, before being eliminated in 6 games by the Detroit Pistons. Hinrich was named to the NBA's All Defensive second team in the 06\u201307 season. Hinrich received 7 first team votes and 4 second team votes, for a total of 18 points. Hinrich joined teammate Ben Wallace on the 06\u201307 All Defensive second team. ====2007\u201308 season==== In the season, Hinrich's numbers dropped across the board, averaging then-career lows in points (11.5), assists (6.0), rebounds (3.3), and minutes played (31.7). He only appeared in 75 games and started 72 of them due to minor injuries. The Bulls missed the playoffs in the 2007\u201308 season finishing with a dismal 33\u201349 season. Hinrich scored a career-high 38 points in a win over the Indiana Pacers on January 23, 2008. ====2008\u201309 season==== Due to the arrival of number one pick Derrick Rose, Hinrich was relegated to a backup role at the point guard position for the 2008\u20132009 season. Injuries also held him to just 51 games played on the season, with only 4 starts. During the 2009 NBA Playoffs Hinrich averaged 30.0 minutes per game, 2.9 assists per game, 1.7 steals per game and 12.6 points per game. The Bulls lost to the Celtics in the first round of the playoffs in a thrilling seven-game series. ====2009\u201310 season==== On February 20, 2010 in a game against the Philadelphia 76ers, Hinrich became the Bulls' all-time leader in three-point field goals, surpassing Ben Gordon's record of 770.Bulls rout 76ers 122\u201390 On April 13, 2010, Hinrich produced a season high 30 points in a 101\u201393 win over the Boston Celtics. Hinrich finished the season averaging 10.9 points per game, 4.5 assists per game, and 1.2 steals per game as the Bulls made the final 8th seed spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. In the playoffs, Hinrich averaged 12.4 points and 4 assists per game, but the Bulls lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.http://www.nba.com/playerfile/kirk_hinrich/index.html ===Washington Wizards (2010\u20132011)=== Kirk Hinrich during his tenure with the Wizards, November 2010 On July 8, 2010, Hinrich was traded to the Washington Wizards along with draft rights to forward Kevin Seraphin in exchange for draft rights to Vladimir Veremeenko. Hinrich began to wear glasses during gameplay during his tenure with the Wizards after learning from Wizards optometrist Keith Smithson that he could lose sight in his left eye if he was hit. In his short tenure with the Wizards, he averaged 11.1 points, 4.4 assists and 2.2 rebounds per game. ===Atlanta Hawks (2011\u20132012)=== On February 23, 2011, Hinrich was traded to the Atlanta Hawks along with Hilton Armstrong in exchange for Mike Bibby, Jordan Crawford, Maurice Evans and a first-round pick in the 2011 NBA draft. At the end of the 2010\u201311 season, the Hawks made the playoffs as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. In Game 6 of the first round against the Orlando Magic, Hinrich injured his hamstring and subsequently missed the entire second round of the playoffs in which the Hawks ended up losing to Hinrich's former team, the Chicago Bulls. Hinrich missed the first eighteen games of the 2011\u201312 NBA season after undergoing left shoulder surgery. During the season, Hinrich averaged career lows in points per game at 6.6, assists per game at 2.8, and minutes per game at 25.8. ===Return to Chicago (2012\u20132016)=== On July 23, 2012, Hinrich signed a two-year contract to return to the Chicago Bulls. In the absence of point guard Derrick Rose, Kirk began the 2012\u201313 season as the Bulls' starting point guard. Hinrich struggled with various injuries throughout the campaign, including an elbow infection and a stress reaction in his foot, shooting just 38% from the field. He finished the year averaging 7.7 points, 5.2 assists, 2.6 rebounds, and 1.1 steals in 29 minutes per game. On April 27, 2013, Hinrich played an excellent game in Game 4 of Round 1 of the 2013 NBA Playoffs vs. the Nets, scoring 18 points and dishing out 14 assists in 60 minutes of the action as the Bulls defeated the Nets 142-134 in triple overtime to give the Bulls a 3-1 series lead. However, Hinrich missed the rest of the postseason after rupturing his calf in the second quarter of that game. The Bulls were eliminated in the second round by the Miami Heat. Hinrich started the 2013\u201314 season as a bench player backing up Derrick Rose, but when Rose suffered a torn meniscus ending his season just 10 games in, Hinrich again became the starter. While he struggled to start the year, shooting just 36.4% from the field and 28% on 3 pointers, he improved immensely following the All-Star Break, shooting 42.8% from the field and 43.7% from 3 for the remainder of the season. He also enjoyed a much healthier regular season campaign, with his 73 games played being his most since the 2009\u201310 season. His 9.1 points per game average was also his highest since the 2010\u201311 season. On July 21, 2014, Hinrich re-signed with the BullsBULLS RE- SIGN KIRK HINRICH to a reported two-year, $5.6 million contract.Bulls To Re- Sign Kirk Hinrich On June 29, 2015, Hinrich exercised his player option with the Bulls for the 2015\u201316 season. ===Return to Atlanta (2016)=== On February 18, 2016, Hinrich was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team trade involving the Bulls and the Utah Jazz. ==International career== In July 2006, Hinrich was officially named to the U.S. national basketball team that would compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. He was initially invited to participate in February 2006, but declined due to the pressure of making a decision in the midst of a competitive NBA season with the Chicago Bulls. After his 2005\u201306 season ended, however, Hinrich changed his mind and accepted a spot on the team's roster. Hinrich said of the incident: The roster first fielded more than 20 players, but it was soon cut down to 15 players, among which was Hinrich. When the final roster was announced, Hinrich was chosen as one of the 12 players set to compete in the FIBA World Championship in Japan. After Hinrich learned of his grandfather's death, he briefly left the US training camp in Las Vegas early in the morning of July 25 and returned to his hometown of Sioux City, Iowa. Hinrich started an exhibition game against Lithuania on August 13, 2006 and scored 10 points and 2 steals in a US win. After the game, Hinrich was asked about starting the game. He responded, \"We're playing in groups right now. I know when I get my time, I just try to make the best of it, make sure our team is successful. It's one of those deals when you play in groups in spurts like that, it's a little bit tougher. But, you don't hold back and give it everything you got because you know you'll be rested a lot.\" In the FIBA world Championship semi-final, Team USA played against the Greece national team. With 2:41 to play in the game, Hinrich connected on a three-point shot to bring the US within 5 points, but was then called for an unsportsmanlike foul on Greece center Sofoklis Schortsanitis. With 45 seconds left, he knocked down another three-pointer to pull the US within four. Hinrich was then fouled out when he intentionally hit a Greek player to stop the shot clock. Despite the US effort, the Greek sealed the deal with free throws and won 101\u201395. The US team then played against the Argentinian team for the bronze medal. In the game, Hinrich played against his former Bulls' teammate Andr\u00e9s Nocioni. The US went on to win 96\u201381, and took home the bronze medal. Hinrich dropped out of the U.S. training camp for the FIBA Americas Championship in 2007, citing personal reasons. The Chicago Tribune reported that Hinrich dropped out of his commitment to the US national team so that he could focus on his wedding, and to \"hitting the weights\" hard. In April 2008, Hinrich revealed that he would not play for Team USA in the Beijing Olympics since his wife was expecting a baby. He said of the Olympics, \"It wasn't like I was upset about anything. It just wasn't working out for me.\" ==Personal life== Hinrich was engaged to Jill Fisher in 2006. He married her on July 7, 2007. His wife gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Kenzie, in 2008. Hinrich's wife gave birth to their second daughter, Kyla, in September 2011. On September 12, 2014, Hinrich's wife gave birth to twins, a boy, Kolton, and a girl, Kinley, for a total of four children.Kirk Hinrich, Bulls remain a perfect fit During his NBA career, Hinrich lived in Bannockburn, Illinois.Where the Chicago Bulls Go to Sleep | Dream Town Retrieved February 25, 2017. Upon retiring from the NBA in 2017, Hinrich and his family moved to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where Hinrich was hired at Sanford Power as a lead basketball specialist.http://www.argusleader.com/story/sports/2017/11/01/former-nba- veteran-kirk-hinrich-joins-sanford-power/821475001/ ==NBA career statistics== ===Regular season=== |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 76 || 66 || 35.6 || .386 || .390 || .804 || 3.4 || 6.8 || 1.3 || .3 || 12.0 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 77 || 77 || 36.4 || .397 || .355 || .792 || 3.9 || 6.4 || 1.6 || .3 || 15.7 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 81 || 81 || 36.5 || .418 || .370 || .815 || 3.6 || 6.3 || 1.2 || .3 || 15.9 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 80 || 80 || 35.5 || .448 || .415 || .835 || 3.4 || 6.3 || 1.3 || .3 || 16.6 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 75 || 72 || 31.7 || .414 || .350 || .831 || 3.3 || 6.0 || 1.2 || .3 || 11.5 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 51 || 4 || 26.3 || .437 || .408 || .791 || 2.4 || 3.9 || 1.3 || .4 || 9.9 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 74 || 53 || 33.5 || .409 || .371 || .752 || 3.5 || 4.5 || 1.1 || .3 || 10.9 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Washington | 48 || 29 || 30.6 || .452 || .384 || .876 || 2.7 || 4.4 || 1.2 || .2 || 11.1 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Atlanta | 24 || 22 || 28.6 || .432 || .421 || .667 || 2.2 || 3.3 || .8 || .3 || 8.6 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Atlanta | 48 || 31 || 25.8 || .414 || .346 || .781 || 2.1 || 2.8 || .8 || .2 || 6.6 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 60 || 60 || 29.4 || .377 || .390 || .714 || 2.6 || 5.2 || 1.1 || .4 || 7.7 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 73 || 61 || 29.0 || .393 || .351 || .760 || 2.6 || 3.9 || 1.1 || .4 || 9.1 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 66 || 22 || 24.4 || .373 || .345 || .700 || 1.8 || 2.2 || .7 || .2 || 5.7 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 35 || 7 || 15.9 || .398 || .411 || .938 || 1.7 || 1.7 || .4 || .0 || 3.8 |- | align=\"left\" | | align=\"left\" | Atlanta | 11 || 0 || 6.9 || .182 || .167 || .000 || 1.1 || 1.3 || .2 || .1 || .5 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 879 || 665 || 30.7 || .411 || .375 || .800 || 2.9 || 4.9 || 1.1 || .3 || 10.9 ===Playoffs=== |- | align=\"left\" | 2005 | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 6 || 6 || 35.5 || .450 || .515 || .690 || 3.7 || 5.8 || 2.0 || .7 || 21.2 |- | align=\"left\" | 2006 | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 6 || 6 || 39.0 || .415 || .346 || .857 || 3.3 || 7.7 || 1.3 || .3 || 20.5 |- | align=\"left\" | 2007 | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 10 || 10 || 36.2 || .376 || .302 || .769 || 4.2 || 7.5 || .9 || .3 || 12.1 |- | align=\"left\" | 2009 | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 7 || 0 || 30.0 || .468 || .433 || .680 || 2.7 || 2.9 || 1.7 || .4 || 12.6 |- | align=\"left\" | 2010 | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 5 || 5 || 39.2 || .423 || .500 || .714 || 4.4 || 4.0 || 1.4 || .0 || 12.4 |- | align=\"left\" | 2011 | align=\"left\" | Atlanta | 6 || 6 || 28.8 || .500 || .421 || 1.000 || 2.3 || 2.7 || 1.2 || .3 || 10.2 |- | align=\"left\" | 2012 | align=\"left\" | Atlanta | 6 || 4 || 23.5 || .433 || .375 || 1.000 || 2.0 || 1.0 || .7 || .0 || 5.7 |- | align=\"left\" | 2013 | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 4 || 4 || 40.5 || .432 || .364 || .643 || 2.8 || 5.8 || 2.0 || .3 || 11.3 |- | align=\"left\" | 2014 | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 5 || 5 || 33.4 || .411 || .368 || .500 || 3.0 || 4.4 || .8 || .2 || 11.0 |- | align=\"left\" | 2015 | align=\"left\" | Chicago | 10 || 0 || 12.6 || .474 || .600 || .667 || .5 || 1.1 || .3 || .1 || 2.6 |- | align=\"left\" | 2016 | align=\"left\" | Atlanta | 6 || 0 || 4.5 || .286 || .333 || .000 || .7 || .5 || .0 || .0 || .8 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 71 || 46 || 28.3 || .428 || .407 || .744 || 2.6 || 3.9 || 1.0 || .2 || 10.5 ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *Prospect Profile Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:All- American college men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Atlanta Hawks players Category:Basketball players at the 2002 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players at the 2003 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from Iowa Category:Chicago Bulls draft picks Category:Chicago Bulls players Category:Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball players Category:People from Bannockburn, Illinois Category:Point guards Category:Shooting guards Category:Sportspeople from Sioux City, Iowa Category:United States men's national basketball team players Category:Washington Wizards players Category:2006 FIBA World Championship players ",
