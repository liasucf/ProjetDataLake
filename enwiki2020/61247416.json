    "text": "On November 3, 2020 El Paso County will elect the mayor of El Paso, Texas, four members of city council (districts 2, 3, 4, and 7), two county commissioners, county sheriff, state senator, and five state representatives. El Pasoans will also be voting for members of the House of Representatives of the United States from the 16th and 23rd districts of Texas, district attorney (which also represents Hudspeth and Culberson counties), United States senator, and president of the United States. The city elections (for mayor and council) are non-partisan, and therefore have no primary election. However, if no candidate wins a majority there will be a run-off election. ==Mayor== ===Candidates=== * Veronica Carbajal, attorney with Texas RioGrande Legal Aidhttps://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/03/veronica- carbajal-carlos-gallinar-join-el-paso-2020-mayoral-race/3858537002/ * Carlos Gallinar, former El Paso city government and former EPISD officialhttps://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/03/veronica- carbajal-carlos-gallinar-join-el-paso-2020-mayoral-race/3858537002/ * Oscar Leeser, former mayorhttps://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2019/03/07/el-paso- mayor-dee-margo-announces-2020-run-after-leeser-joins-race * Dee Margo, incumbent mayor and former member of the Texas House of Representativeshttps://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2019/03/07/el-paso- mayor-dee-margo-announces-2020-run-after-leeser-joins-race ===Potential candidates=== * Cassandra Hernandez-Brown, city representative http://thelionstarblog.blogspot.com/2019/07/bursting-bubbles.html ===First round results=== ==City council elections== ===District 2=== District 2 incumbent Alexsandra Annello is eligible for re-election. ====Candidates==== ===District 3=== District 3 incumbent Cassandra Hernandez-Brown is eligible for re-election. ====Candidates==== ===District 4=== District 4 incumbent Sam Morgan is eligible for re-election. * Wesley Lawrence * Dorthy M \"Sissy\" Byrd * Joe Molinar * Shawn Nixon ===District 7=== District 7 incumbent Henry Rivera is eligible for re-election. ====Candidates==== Former El Paso Times journalist Aaron J.
