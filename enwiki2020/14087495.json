    "text": "Mnata Mnata was the second of the seven Bohemian mythical princes between the (also mythical) founder of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty P\u0159emysl, the Ploughman and the first historical prince Bo\u0159ivoj. The names of the princes were first recorded in Cosmas chronicle and then transmitted into the most of historical books of the 19th century including Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd's The History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia. One theory about the number of the princes is propped on the frescoes on the walls of the Rotunda in Znojmo, Moravia but Ane\u017eka Merhautov\u00e1 claimed that the frescoes depict all the members of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty including the Moravian junior princes.Barbara Krzemie\u0144ska-Ane\u017eka Merhautov\u00e1-Du\u0161an T\u0159e\u0161t\u00edk: \"Morav\u0161t\u00ed P\u0159emyslovci ve znojemsk\u00e9 rotund\u011b\", Praha 2000. == Origin of the name == Mnata's name is thought to be derived from the Czech word \"mn\u00edti\" - remember. Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra thought the names of the seven princes were cryptical names of ancient Slavonic days of the week - Mnata being the second - Monday similar to German Montag.Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra: \"\u010cesk\u00e9 pohanstv\u00ed\", Praha 1947 Another theory says that the names were mistaken from a coherent and partly interrupted old Slavonic text.Vladim\u00edr Karbusick\u00fd: B\u00e1je, m\u00fdty, d\u011bjiny.
