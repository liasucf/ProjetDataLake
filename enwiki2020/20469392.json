    "text": "is the title of the first installment of the 2009 editions of the long-running Kamen Rider Series of tokusatsu dramas. Decade, as its title suggests, is the tenth of the Heisei Rider Series, having begun with Kamen Rider Kuuga in 2000. It began broadcasting the week following the finale of Kamen Rider Kiva and was featured in Super Hero Time alongside the 2009 edition of the Super Sentai Series, Samurai Sentai Shinkenger. The series ties in with the arcade game Kamen Rider Battle: Ganbaride, with Kamen Riders Decade and Diend using cards resembling those used in the game to transform and access various weapons. Inspiration for this series was very likely to have been the fact that Toei had successfully ensured that the Kamen Rider series lasted a whole decade (2000-2009) without the show going into a period of hiatus which had always occurred since the franchise began in the 1970s. The series' English dub aired on October 20, 2012, 5:30 p.m. at Singapore's Okto Channel, Mediacorp. Kamen Rider Zi-O, the last Heisei era series of 2018-2019, acts as a spiritual sequel, where both Decade and Diend play prominent roles as re-occurring side characters who are directly involved in that series plotline. ==Casting== Masahiro Inoue, who portrayed Keigo Atobe in the Prince of Tennis musicals, was cast in the lead role for Decade as Tsukasa Kadoya/Kamen Rider Decade. Also involved were Kanna Mori as Natsumi Hikari, and Renji Ishibashi as Natsumi's grandfather Eijiro Hikari. Another member of the cast was Tatsuhito Okuda as the mysterious Narutaki. The world of Kamen Rider Kuuga, as well as most of the other Rider Worlds, sport several characters who have been renamed and cast with different actors. Ryouta Murai was cast as Yusuke Onodera who is the series' version of Kamen Rider Kuuga. Rounding up the cast was Kimito Totani who portrayed the thief Daiki Kaito/Kamen Rider Diend. ==Synopsis== Photography is an overarching motif in Kamen Rider Decade. Tsukasa uses this twin-lens reflex camera produced by Blackbird, Fly, specially made for the series in a color described as \"Decade Low Pink\". The story revolves around the nine parallel universes of the previous Heisei Kamen Riders merging into one, something that would destroy all the worlds. To prevent this, Tsukasa Kadoya transforms into Kamen Rider Decade and is told that to save his own world he must travel with Natsumi and her grandfather to the other Kamen Riders' Worlds called A.R. Worlds (Another Rider's World or Alternate Reality World) and defeat the other Kamen Riders. Along the way, confronting the mysterious Narutaki and the gentleman thief Daiki Kaito, they are joined by Yusuke Onodera of the World of Kuuga and Kivala of the World of Kiva. To fit with the printing motif of the series, the main Kamen Riders of the series follow the CMYK color model: Decade is magenta, Diend is cyan, and Kuuga ((Rising) Ultimate Form) is black and yellow. In the Cho-Den-O Trilogy film Episode Yellow: Treasure de End Pirates, Diend is the primary character, emphasizing the yellow accents on his Diendriver and the enhanced Kamen Ride Diend card. ===Rider War=== The , first revealed in Natsumi Hikari's dream, is a predestined event composed of many Kamen Riders called the , all of whom were seemingly defeated by Kamen Rider Decade. However, Kamen Rider Kuuga survived the initial battle, assuming Ultimate Form to confront Decade once again with the two seemingly destroying each other in the ensuing battle. As Narutaki explains to Natsumi, the dream is a predestined event in which Decade will destroy all the worlds. ==Episodes== Generally, episodes of Decade are titled similarly to the episodes of the series that they reference. Kamen Rider Kuugas episodes were titled with only two kanji and episodes of Kamen Rider Kiva have a musical reference and musical notation in the title. For the World of Hibiki story arc, the episode title cards are stylized in calligraphy similar to the styles featured in Kamen Rider Hibiki. For the World of Amazon story arc, the episode title had a reference from Kamen Rider Amazon episode 3. An episode arc also features a crossover with Samurai Sentai Shinkenger.
