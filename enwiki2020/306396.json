    "text": "The Herald of Christian Science was first published in 1903 in response to the demand for a monthly publication on Christian Science in Germany. Due to an increasing demand for Christian Science Literature from other countries, the Herald grew to include twelve different languages. Until the 1990s the magazine was bilingual, with English and translated texts side by side. Currently the Herald is available in fourteen languages, giving readers around the world an understanding of Christian Science practice. Along with articles and accounts of healing, each issue includes a directory of Christian Science churches, practitioners and other listings applicable to each language. The Herald is also produced as a radio program in five languages. ==External links== * Category:1903 establishments in Germany Category:Christian Science magazines Category:Monthly magazines published in Germany Category:Magazines established in 1903 Category:Multilingual magazines ",
