    "text": "\u0138 in a Greenlandic\u2013Danish dictionary from 1926 \"Avangn\u00e2mio\u0138\" in all-caps, title of Greenlandic periodical from 1957, with the uppercase of \u0138 as K\u02bc. Kra (K\u02bc / \u0138) is a glyph formerly used to write the Kalaallisut language of Greenland and is now only found in Nunatsiavummiutut, a distinct Inuktitut dialect. It is visually similar to a Latin small capital letter K and the Greek letter kappa \u03ba. It is used to denote the sound written as in the International Phonetic Alphabet (the voiceless uvular plosive). For collation purposes, it is therefore considered to be a type of q, rather than a type of k, and should sort near q. Its Unicode code point for the lowercase form is . If this is unavailable, q is substituted. The letter can be capitalized as K\u02bc, but it is not encoded separately as a single letter because it is very similar to the Latin capital letter K followed by an apostrophe, preferably the modifier letter apostrophe, . In 1973, a spelling reform replaced kra in Greenlandic with the Latin small letter q (and its capital form, with the Latin capital letter Q). Note that in the Greenlandic alphabet PDF from Evertype, the apostrophe-like symbol is represented by the symbol of U+2018, LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK. However Michael Everson uses the shape of the right single quotation mark or modifier letter apostrophe in other documents (e.g. Everson 1998). Kra, small caps K (if present), and Cyrillic small \u043a, using the fonts: Arial, Times New Roman, Doulos SIL, Cambria, Linux Libertine, Andron Mega Corpus, Adobe Minion Pro, Courier New, and Consolas. Second row: italics, using the same fonts. ==Notes== Category:Greenlandic culture Kra ",
