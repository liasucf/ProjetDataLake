    "text": "The border between Andorra and Spain is in the Pyrenees between northern Spain and southern Andorra. It is long. It is the outer border of the EU, as Andorra is not part of the EU. == Specifications == The Spanish-Andorran border runs 64 km between the south of Andorra and northern Spain (by the autonomous community of Catalonia) in the Pyrenees Mountains. Because both Spain and Andorra are situated in the same watershed, travel is easier (roads are better) than travel between Andorra and France. The most used languages of Andorra are also Catalan and Spanish. The border begins in the west at the Andorra-France-Spain tripoint ().The tripoints of Andorra grpdesbf.nl It then follows a generally south-eastern direction, later turning northeast to the eastern Andorra-Spain-France tripoint (). The dividing line between the two countries goes through high mountain areas, often over 2000 m, and passes close to the highest point of Andorra, the peak of Coma Pedrosa. It also borders the Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley, the only UNESCO World Heritage Site in Andorra.
