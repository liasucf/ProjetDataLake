It is both the largest domed stadium on a college campus and the largest domed stadium in the Northeast. It is home to the Syracuse Orange football, basketball, and lacrosse teams. With regard to basketball, it holds another title, being the largest on-campus basketball arena, with a listed capacity of 33,000. This limit has been exceeded several times.

It also contains academic rooms and two weight rooms strictly for Syracuse athletes only. Adjacent to the complex there are a variety of fields used for softball, soccer, field hockey, as well as a track for the track and field team. Manley was initially used as an indoor training facility for the football team, as well as a home court for men's basketball. Its seating capacity, 9,500, for basketball, at the time among the largest campus facilities in the Northeast, supported the rise to national prominence of the men's basketball program. The team shifted to the Carrier Dome after the 1980 season. In the final men's basketball game played at Manley, Georgetown snapped the Orangemen's 57 game home winning streak. === Carmelo Anthony Basketball Center === The name comes from Syracuse basketball star, Carmelo Anthony, who donated $3 million to the project.

Archbold, what was publicized as the \"Greatest Athletic Arena in America\" opened in 1907. Designed to resemble the Roman Colosseum and to never become outdated, Archbold Stadium became a trademark of Syracuse football. The stadium formed a massive concrete oval, 670 feet (204 m) long and 475 feet (145 m) wide. It was 100 feet (30 m) longer and only 22 feet (7 m) thinner than the Carrier Dome, and more than 6 million Orangemen football fans passed through its gates. From 1907 until 1978, Archbold Stadium was the home of SU football. Archbold opened up with a bang when the Orange defeated Hobart 28\u20130. It went out in style 71 years later, with an improbable victory over second-ranked Navy 20\u201317. Syracuse posted a record of 265\u2013112\u201350 at Archbold, and it housed many great teams. It was home of the 1915 squad, which was invited to play in the prestigious Rose Bowl and outscored its opponents 331 to 16. The 1959 team also called Archbold home en route to SU's only National Championship. In 1978, SU fans said good-bye forever to the historic stadium. Archbold was demolished to make way for the new on-campus facility, the Carrier Dome, which opened in 1980.(Source: SU Athletics) == Championships == === NCAA team championships === Syracuse University has won 15 NCAA team national championships.http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/Overall.pdf *Men's (14) **Basketball (1): 2003 **Boxing (1): 1936 **Cross Country (2): 1951, 2015 **Lacrosse* (10): 1983, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1995, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2009 *Women's (1) **Field Hockey (1): 2015 *see also: **ACC NCAA team championships **List of NCAA schools with the most NCAA Division I championships Syracuse University crewman (1905) === Other national team championships === Below are 17 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: * Men's **Basketball\u2206 (2): 1918, 1926 **Cross-country (4): 1919, 1922, 1923, 1925 **Football (1): 1959 **Lacrosse (4): 1920#, 1922, 1924, 1925 **Rowing (6): 1904, 1908, 1913, 1916, 1920, 1978 * After the 1990 championship, the NCAA Committee on Infractions determined that Paul Gait had played in the 1990 championship while ineligible.

Prior to that time, the school's colors were rose pink and pea green. Orange, blue, and white are traditionally used for athletic uniforms. The athletic nickname derives from the official color. Prior to 2004, the official nicknames of the athletic teams were the \"Orangemen\" and \"Orangewomen.\" These former nicknames are still affectionately used by some fans. However, beginning with the 2004\u20132005 school year, the official nickname was changed to the \"Orange.\" This revision is gender-neutral, concise, and reflects the basis of the nickname as being the school color. According to an 1890 newspaper article uncovered by the Syracuse Post Standard, the orange was originally a reference to the Netherlands, which first colonized New York State.Syracuse Post-Standard article It's common in upstate New York for place names to make reference to the Dutch heritage. In a similar way, the original settlement that became Albany was called Fort Orange. Other nicknames over the years have included the \"Hilltoppers,\" for the school's location on a hill, and the \"Saltine Warriors,\" for a former mascot. ===Mascot=== In 1931, a Native American warrior known as Nathan March aka: \"Saltine Warrior\" became the athletic mascot. The name derived from an article describing an archaeological dig on campus allegedly uncovering the artifacts of a Native American warrior.Syracuse University website The warrior was called the \"Saltine Warrior\" because of the abundant salt deposits in the Syracuse, New York area. The article was later revealed to be a hoax, but the mascot remained for next four decades. In the mid-1950s, the father of a Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity brother owned a cheerleading camp. He made a Saltine Warrior costume for his son to wear at Syracuse football games.Syracuse University website Thus began a nearly forty-year tradition of Lambda Chi brothers serving as the university's mascot. In 1978, the Saltine Warrior was banned by the university as part of the national movement to eliminate Native American motifs, becoming one of the first colleges to do so. The mascot briefly morphed into a Roman warrior, but was eventually replaced unofficially in 1982 by a giant, cartoon- style Orange. ====Otto the Orange==== The cheerleaders and mascots were at a UCA Cheerleading Camp in Tennessee that summer, and narrowed the field down to two potential names\u2014\"Opie\" and \"Otto.\" Figuring the name \"Opie\" would lead to the inevitable rhyme with \"dopey,\" they settled on \"Otto.\" Later that fall, word got out that the cheerleaders were calling the latest mascot costume Otto, and the name stuck. Otto the Orange was adopted by the university in 1995 as the university's official mascot, selected over a wolf and a lion also under consideration. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Rugby union teams in New York (state) ",
