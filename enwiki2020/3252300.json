    "text": "Arthur! And the Square Knights of the Round Table is a 1966-1968 Australian animated series based on the legend of King Arthur of Camelot. The series was produced by Air Programs International and written by Melbourne playwright Alex Buzo and British-born entertainer Rod Hull, with Lyle Martin, Michael Robinson, and John Palmer. The characters included King Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin, the Jester, the Black Knight, and Morgana le Fay. The actors who voiced the character parts in the series included: John Meillon (as \"Arthur\"), Lola Brooks (as \"Guinevere\" and \"Morgana le Fay\"), John Ewart, Kevin Golsby, and Matthew O'Sullivan. By 1969, the series had been sold for broadcast in the United Kingdom and the United States. In Australia, where it was made and produced, it was sold also to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, for broadcast on the ABC-TV network. Typically it was broadcast on Saturday mornings and initially also, on Monday evenings. As the Australian television industry did not go to color broadcast until around March 1975, viewers would view the series in black and white for the first six years of its Australian transmission. This was despite all the episodes having been made in colour. For most of the 1970s, Australia's ABC-TV continued to rerun the series for children's cartoon programming. This was usually on a Saturday morning. During 1980-81, the French purchased the series. However, the series has been completely redone with a French soundtrack, with the original music also removed. In this format, the series was then broadcast on the French television channel, TF1. By 1993, the series was also being broadcast on German cable television. ==Original episodes== ;Episode 1: *Octopus *Would You Believe, A Beanstalk? *Which Wizard Versus What Witch ;Episode 2: *There's An Elephant at the Drawbridge *A Nice Knight for a Wedding *Paris Picnic ;Episode 3: *It's the Only Kingdom I've Got *Old Moody *I'll See If I'm There ;Episode 4: *The Inn *Seventeen Going on Seventy *Will the Real Arthur Please Stand Up ;Episode 5: *The Genie Who Came to Dinner *No Laugh Olaf *Some Maidens Just Aren't Fair ;Episode 6: *New Armour for the King *Smile, Smile, Smile *That's What I Call Music ;Episode 7: *It's the Gift That Counts *The King's Champion *Undercover Knight ;Episode 8: *How Do You Like Them Apples *Pink is In *Get Your Wish Here ;Episode 9: *Little Bundle *The Crown Jewels *Mail-Order Bride ;Episode 10: *The Unicorn of Camelot *Belle of the Ball *While Camelot Sleeps ;Episode 11: *Play Gypsy Play *Be Kind to Dragons *The Search For Guinevere ;Episode 12: *Even Knights Have To Eat *The Wrecker *Assault On Castle Morgana ==Home releases== Revelation Films released a DVD titled \"Arthur and the Square Knights of the Round Table\" in 2003.\"Arthur And The Square Knights of The Round Table, Revelation, PAR 61178, 2003 This Region \"0\" DVD has a 200-minute running time and contains the first 8 episodes.
