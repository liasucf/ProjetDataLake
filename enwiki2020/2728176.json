    "text": "Parliamentary elections were held in Slovakia on 8 and 9 June 1990 alongside federal elections. They were the first elections after the Velvet Revolution, and the first free elections since 1946. The Public Against Violence (VPN) party emerged as the largest in the Slovak National Council, winning 48 of the 150 seats. In the aftermath of the election, Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar of the VPN formed a grand coalition with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). After a conflict leading to the dissolution of the VPN, the first Me\u010diar cabinet was brought down by a vote of non-confidence in the parliament. J\u00e1n \u010carnogursk\u00fd of the KDH became the new Prime Minister in April 1991. ==Electoral system== These were the only elections with a 3% electoral threshold; it was raised to 5% for the 1992 elections. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right | colspan=6 align=center| 350px |- ! colspan=2| Party !
