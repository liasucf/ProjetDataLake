The government considered two proposals. The first proposed a merger of the Armidale Dumaresq Council and the Guyra Shire Council merge to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 30,000. The alternative, proposed by the Armidale Dumaresq Council on 1 March 2016, was for an amalgamation of the Armidale Dumaresq, Guyra, Uralla and Walcha councils. Following an independent review, on 12 May 2016 the Minister for Local Government announced that the merger with the Guyra Shire would proceed with immediate effect. ==See also== * Local government areas of New South Wales == References == ==External links== *Armidale Dumaresq Council Home Page *Local Government & Municipal Knowledge Base - Armidale Dumaresq Council Page Category:Former local government areas of New South Wales Category:New England (New South Wales) Category:Armidale, New South Wales Category:2016 disestablishments in Australia Category:Armidale Regional Council ",
