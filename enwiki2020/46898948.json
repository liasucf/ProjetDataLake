Since her debut in June 2014, a 7\u20130 win over Serbia, she has been a member of the Switzerland women's national football team.Portrait in the Swiss Football Association's page Zehnder came to the attention of FC Z\u00fcrich after playing against them in a friendly for FC Kirchberg. She signed for FC Z\u00fcrich as a youth prospect but quickly made her first-team debut on her 15th birthday, registering an assist. Playing alongside Z\u00fcrich's veteran German duo Inka Grings and Sonja Fuss aided Zehnder's development. National coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg called her up to the national team and in summer 2015 was reportedly helping her to secure a transfer to the professional German Bundesliga for a higher standard of club football. In May 2015, Zehnder joined SC Freiburg. In June 2017 she returned to FC Z\u00fcrich. ==References== ==External links== *Profile at FC Z\u00fcrich Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Swiss women's footballers Category:Sportspeople from Z\u00fcrich Category:Swiss expatriates in Germany Category:Expatriate women's footballers in Germany Category:Switzerland women's international footballers Category:SC Freiburg (women) players Category:Nationalliga A (women's football) players Category:FC Z\u00fcrich Frauen players Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:2015 FIFA Women's World Cup players ",
