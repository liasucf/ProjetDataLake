After his father's death in 1882, his mother moved to Klagenfurt and he would often visit there to paint. It remained a favorite location for the rest of his life. He also made occasional trips to Italy and Belgium. He completed his studies in 1890 at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe, with Gustav Sch\u00f6nleber, who acquainted him the Barbizon school of landscape painting. After that, he lived in Munich and Krems an der Donau. From 1907, he was a Professor of landscape and still-life painting at the Academy in Graz, where he was an exponent of the Viennese style known as \"\" (Mood Impressionism).
