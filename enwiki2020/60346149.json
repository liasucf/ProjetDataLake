He brutally tortures and rapes her, then kills her. S.P. Shivani Shivaji Roy IPS (Rani Mukherjee) examines the case. The brutality of the murder disturbs her and makes her more determined to catch the killer. Sunny sees Shivani on TV when she appears at a press conference and promises to find Latika's killer. He taunts her by sneaking into her home and stealing her sari, using it to kill a journalist; he also hires Pravin, a tea-seller near the local police station, to kill the journalist's wife in a suicide blast, then takes Pravin's place as tea-seller to keep an eye on her, introducing himself as a mute boy named Bajrang. When Shivani brings in Lahanya, a child from the slums who had witnessed the blast, Sunny kills him in the toilet. When there is a media uproar, Shivani points out that Sunny is not afraid of being caught; he is doing all this because she has hurt his ego by insulting him on TV. He is a man of spectacle who is doing this for fame and pleasure. Sunny kidnaps a second bold outspoken woman (who once slapped him because he was secretly recording her); the police discover her already raped and tortured but still alive and manage to save her. The media attacks the police force for their perceived ineptness at catching Sunny and Shivani is set to be transferred. As the new S.P. is to arrive in two days, she strives to find Sunny in those two days. Sunny, acting as Bajrang, deliberately wounds himself and gets a lift from Shivani. Before he can strangle her, Shivani stops him, having realized that Bajrang is Sunny. The two fight but Sunny escapes. Shivani discovers that Sunny's next target is the female politician Sunanda; having failed to kill Shivani, Sunny had warned her that he would instead kill someone like her. That night, amidst the Diwali celebrations, Shivani and her team search for him. Shivani discovers him in the house of a local couple, having taken their daughter and Sunanda hostage and torturing them. Shivani goes to confront him but is knocked unconscious and tied up. When she awakes, Sunny is strangling Sunanda; to distract him, Shivani talks about his mother and his past, which she learned about from Sunny's father, who is imprisoned in Meerut. As a child, Sunny's father had tried to murder Sunny's mother, who had been an outspoken woman. In terror, Sunny's mother had hid on the terrace, but Sunny told his father where she was hiding; his father then killed his mother. The guilt of his mother's death has since caused Sunny to become unhinged and take that anger out on other confident girls. Shivani signals Sunanda and the other hostage to toss the nearby buckets of paint on Sunny, as he is asthmatic. She then gains the upper hand, beating Sunny with his own belt. She kicks him outside and continues beating him as the neighbourhood gathers to watch. ==Cast== * Rani Mukerji as SP Shivani Shivaji Roy * Jisshu Sengupta as Dr. Vikram Roy *Vishal Jethwa as Shiv 'Sunny' Prasad Yadav / Bajrang Chaiwallah * Shruti Bapna as Inspector Bharti Angare * Rajesh Sharma as Amit Sharma * Tejasvi Singh Ahlawat as Latika * Pratyksh Rajbhatt as Monty, Latika's friend * Prasanna Ketkar as Politician Govind Mishra / Pandit Ji (Sunny's boss) * Anurag Sharma as Journalist Kamal Parihar * Sunny Hinduja as Viplav Beniwal * Sumit Nijhawan as DSP Brij Shekhawat * Richa Meena as Sunanda Chaudhary * Vikram Singh Chauhan as Inspector Anup Singhal * Deepika Amin as Dr. Harni Kapur, Latika's doctor * Avneet Kaur as Meera * Pariva Praniti as Aabha Parihar * Aanchal Srivastava as Tina * Suresh Anand as Rawat * Vishal Nath as Pravin * Vishal Sudarshanwar as SHO Vinay Jaiswal * Girish Sharma as Kunwar ==Production== On 10 December 2018 Yash Raj Films announced on their official Twitter account the making of sequel to their hit film Mardaani to be directed and scripted by Gopi Puthran.
