She is the daughter of journalist and author Cressida Connolly and Charles Hudson, of Wyke Manor. Cressida, who has written for Vogue, The Daily Telegraph, the Spectator and The Guardian, is the daughter of author Cyril Connolly, and great-granddaughter of James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon; she was previously married to Sunday Times and Tatler writer and critic AA Gill.

The character is recurring and will continue throughout the series. On her character during the series' mid-season episode, Hudson stated that \"when you are in just a lot of pain, it comes out as anger\u2026 I think that's quite a human characteristic, basically, and I think that's definitely what happens is that she's [Laoghaire] got all this pain and she doesn't know what to do with it and it comes out in this very kind of aggressive way and she does whatever she can do to rectify the situation.\" Hudson guest-starred as Paulette Roland, a 17-year-old diabetic who discovers that she is pregnant, in series four of the BBC medical period drama Call the Midwife.
