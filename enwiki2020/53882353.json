    "text": "Lois Virginia Curfman McInnes is an American applied mathematician who works as a senior computational scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, where she works on the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations for scientific applications. ==Education and career== McInnes graduated in 1988 from Muhlenberg College, with a double major in mathematics and physics. She completed her doctorate in applied mathematics in 1993 at the University of Virginia; her dissertation, Solution of Convective-Diffusive Flow Problems with Newton-Like Methods, was supervised by James McDonough Ortega. She was chair of the SIAM Activity Group on Computational Science and Engineering for 2015\u20132016. ==Recognition== She won the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award of the DOE Office of Science in 2011. She and her co-developers of the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation were also honored in 2015 with the SIAM/ACM Prize in Computational Science and Engineering. She was elected as a fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in 2017, \"for contributions to scalable numerical algorithms and software libraries for solving large-scale scientific and engineering problems\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Muhlenberg College alumni Category:University of Virginia alumni Category:Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Category:Argonne National Laboratory people Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
