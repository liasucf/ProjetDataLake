It is called marc in both English and French, but \"grappa\" in Italian. In Spanish it is called orujo. Alcohol derived from pomace is also used as the traditional base spirit of other liquors, such as some anise-flavored spirits. Unlike wine brandy, most pomace brandies are neither aged nor coloured. ==Production== Red grape pomace in a vineyard White grape pomace being removed from a basket press Pomace may be either fermented, semi-fermented, or unfermented. During red wine vinification, the pomace is left to soak in the must for the entire fermentation period and is thus fermented; fermented pomace is particularly suitable for the production of pomace brandy, as it is soft, dry, and has a high alcohol content. Semi-fermented pomace is produced during ros\u00e9 wine vinification; the pomace is removed before fermentation is complete. Virgin pomace, which is produced during white wine vinification, is not fermented at all. The pomace is then fermented to completion and the alcohol is then distilled off to produce the pomace brandy. ==Varieties== Marc de Bourgogne (a type of aged pomace brandy from Burgundy, France) === France === * Marc d'Alsace * Marc d\u2019Auvergne * Marc de Beaujolais * Marc de Bourgogne * Marc de Provence * Marc de Savoie * Marc d'Iroul\u00e9guy * Marc du Jura * Marc des C\u00f4tes- du-Rh\u00f4ne * Marc de Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape * Marc de Gigondas * Marc de muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise * Marc du Bugey * Marc de Champagne * Marc de Lorraine * Marc du Languedoc * Grappa de Corse === In other countries === * Bulgaria: Dzhibrovitsa (type of rakia) * Chile: Aguardiente de Chill\u00e1n * Crete: Tsikoudia (also known as raki) * Cyprus: Zivania * Georgia: Chacha * Germany: Tresterbrand * Greece: Tsipouro * Hungary: T\u00f6rk\u00f6lyp\u00e1linka * Italy: Grappa * Montenegro: Loza * Portugal: Bagaceira * Serbia and the Balkans: Komovica * North Macedonia: Komova rakija * Slovenia: Tropinovec * Spain: Orujo * Romania: Tescovin\u0103 ==References== Category:Distilled drinks ",
