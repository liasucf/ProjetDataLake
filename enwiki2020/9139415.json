The institute has acquired full autonomous status from June 2004. The Institute offers a variety of equipment and machinery for teaching as well as research/consultancy services. Faculty have contributed for laboratory development through various funding agencies like AICTE, DST, BARC, and NRB other than the funding received under two phases of TEQIP and from Government of Maharashtra. Four departments of the institute are recipients of DST-FIST sponsored laboratories. Faculty research abilities have led to the establishment of a \"Center of Excellence\" in the area of signal and image processing (S&IP;) under TEQIP. The Institute has collaborations with a number of other institutions, including foreign universities, and industries through which opportunities like internships, credit transfers, and industry-relevant projects are made available for the students. Students have gone on to higher education in India and abroad, entrepreneurship, administrative and engineering servicesm as well as participating in socially relevant projects and activities. The research culture of the institute has been proven through publication in peer-reviewed national and international journals, and international conferences. Many members of the faculty are reviewers for international journals and have published books.

In 1983 Prof. B.M. Naik was appointed as the first full-time director. In 2004, a committee headed by Dr. F.C. Kholi conducted a survey which identified three engineering colleges with potential for excellence. SGGSIE&T; was one of the three selected institutes. The Government of Maharashtra took the initiative of granting autonomous status to these engineering colleges under its TEQIP program. The SGGS Institute of Engineering and technology is one of the selected few engineering colleges to be offered total autonomy- academic, financial and administrative. In the Eligibility Criterion of NPIU, Institute secured 59 Marks out of 63 and is selected under TEQIP for assistance and provided stiff competition to other institutes. Shri Sunil Raithatha, an eminent industrialist, has been nominated by the Government of Maharashtra as Chairman of the Governing Board. The Government has also appointed renowned personalities form business and industry, academics and its senior administrative cadre on the Governing Board.
