    "text": "The 1979 Barcelona City Council election, also the 1979 Barcelona municipal election, was held on Tuesday, 3 April 1979, to elect the 1st City Council of the municipality of Barcelona. All 43 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with local elections all throughout Spain. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Barcelona (, ) was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Barcelona, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Barcelona and in full enjoyment of their civil and political rights. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes\u2014which included blank ballots\u2014being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:95%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\" align=\"center\" ! width=\"120\"| Population ! width=\"265\"| Councillors |- | <250 | 5 |- | 251\u20131,000 | 7 |- | 1,001\u20132,000 | 9 |- | 2,001\u20135,000 | 11 |- | 5,001\u201310,000 | 13 |- | 10,001\u201320,000 | 17 |- | 20,001\u201350,000 | 21 |- | 50,001\u2013100,000 | 25 |- | >100,001 | +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number |} The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the eldest one would be elected. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within fifteen days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one-thousandth of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election\u2014with a compulsory minimum of 500 signatures\u2014disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font- size:95%;\" |+ Summary of the 3 April 1979 City Council of Barcelona election results \u2192 |- | colspan=\"7\"| 275px |- bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"500\"| Parties and coalitions ! colspan=\"3\"| Popular vote ! colspan=\"2\"| Seats |- bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\" align=\"center\" ! width=\"75\"| Votes ! width=\"45\"| % ! width=\"45\"| \u00b1pp ! width=\"35\"| Total ! width=\"35\"| +/\u2212 |- | width=\"1\" bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC\u2013PSOE) | 272,512 || 34.05 || n/a | 16 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) | 151,288 || 18.90 || n/a | 9 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Convergence and Union (CiU) | 148,806 || 18.59 || n/a | 8 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Centrists of Catalonia (CC\u2013UCD) | 133,885 || 16.73 || n/a | 8 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Republican Left of Catalonia\u2013National Front of Catalonia (ERC\u2013FNC) | 41,845 || 5.23 || n/a | 2 || n/a |- | colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"| |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Democratic Coalition (CD) | 24,039 || 3.00 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Workers' Party of Catalonia\u2013Communist Unity (PTC\u2013UC) | 8,832 || 1.10 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Communist Movement\u2013Organization of Communist Left (MC\u2013OEC) | 4,259 || 0.53 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Socialist Party of National Liberation (PSAN) | 3,123 || 0.39 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Social Christian Democracy of Catalonia (DSCC) | 2,950 || 0.37 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Revolutionary Communist League (LCR) | 1,939 || 0.24 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"white\"| | align=\"left\"| Catalan Left Bloc (BEC) | 0 || 0.00 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"white\"| | align=\"left\"| Democratic Municipal Action (AMD) | 0 || 0.00 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| New Force (FN) | 0 || 0.00 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Republican Left (IR) | 0 || 0.00 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"white\"| | align=\"left\"| List for Workers' Courts (LCO) | 0 || 0.00 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | align=\"left\"| Workers' Revolutionary Organization (ORT) | 0 || 0.00 || n/a | 0 || n/a |- | align=\"left\" colspan=\"2\"| Blank ballots | 2,547 || 0.32 || n/a | bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\" colspan=\"2\"| |- | colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\"| |- style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | align=\"left\" colspan=\"2\"| Total | 800,428 || bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\" colspan=\"2\"| | 43 || n/a |- | colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\"| |- | align=\"left\" colspan=\"2\"| Valid votes | 800,428 || 99.63 || n/a | bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"5\"| |- | align=\"left\" colspan=\"2\"| Invalid votes | 2,991 || 0.37 || n/a |- style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | align=\"left\" colspan=\"2\"| Votes cast / turnout | 803,419 || 54.27 || n/a |- | align=\"left\" colspan=\"2\"| Abstentions | 677,034 || 45.73 || n/a |- style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | align=\"left\" colspan=\"2\"| Registered voters | 1,480,453 || bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\" colspan=\"2\"| |- | colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\"| |- | align=\"left\" colspan=\"7\"| Sources |} ==References== Barcelona 1979 Category:1970s in Barcelona Category:1979 in Catalonia ",
