    "text": "A sweep in athletics is when one team wins all available medals in a single event in a sporting event. At the highest level, that would be when one nation wins all the medals in an athletics event at the World Championships in Athletics. In athletics the maximum number of entrants from a single country in most events is three, allowing in theory for athletes from the same country to finish in all three top places. ==Men== Carl Lewis has been a part of four American sweeps. Kenya has swept the 3000 metres steeplechase three times, with Ezekiel Kemboi and Brimin Kipruto a part of two of them. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !rowspan=2|Championships !rowspan=2|Event !rowspan=2|Country !colspan=2 style=\"background- color:gold;\"|Gold !colspan=2 style=\"background-color:silver;\"|Silver !colspan=2 style=\"background-color:#cc9966;\"|Bronze !rowspan=2|Ref |- !Athlete !Result !Athlete !Result !Athlete !Result |- |rowspan=2|1983 Helsinki | 100 m | |Carl Lewis |10.07 |Calvin Smith |10.21 |Emmit King |10.24 | |- | Long jump | |Carl Lewis |8.55 |Jason Grimes |8.29 |Mike Conley |8.12 | |- |rowspan=2|1991 Tokyo | 100 m | |Carl Lewis |9.86 |Leroy Burrell |9.88 |Dennis Mitchell |9.91 | |- | Long jump | |Mike Powell |8.95 |Carl Lewis |8.91 |Larry Myricks |8.42 | |- |1997 Athens | 3000 m st. | |Wilson Boit Kipketer |8:05.84 |Moses Kiptanui |8:06.04 |Bernard Barmasai |8:06.04 | |- |2001 Edmonton | 20 km walk | |Roman Rasskazov |1:20:31 |Ilya Markov |1:20:33 |Viktor Burayev |1:20:36 | |- |2003 Paris | 10,000 m | |Kenenisa Bekele |26:49.57 |Haile Gebrselassie |26:50.77 |Sileshi Sihine |27:01.44 | |- |2005 Helsinki | 200 m | |Justin Gatlin |20.04 |Wallace Spearmon |20.20 |John Capel |20.31 | |- |rowspan=2|2007 Osaka | 400 m | |Jeremy Wariner |43.45 |LaShawn Merritt |43.96 |Angelo Taylor |44.32 | |- | 3000 m st. | |Brimin Kipruto |8:13.82 |Ezekiel Kemboi |8:16.94 |Richard Mateelong |8:17.59 | |- |2015 Beijing | 3000 m st. | |Ezekiel Kemboi |8:11.28 |Conseslus Kipruto |8:12.38 |Brimin Kipruto |8:12.54 | |- |} ==Women== Sweeps have only occurred ten times in women's events. The 10,000 metres is the only event to have had three occurrences, in 2001, 2005 and 2011. Ethiopia had most sweeps, at four. Tirunesh Dibaba and her sister Ejegayehu Dibaba were both a part of two of those sweeps, another sister Genzebe Dibaba and cousin Derartu Tulu gave the family participation in all four Ethiopian sweeps. Tirunesh's husband, Sileshi Sihine, was a part of Ethiopia's men's sweep. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !rowspan=2|Championships !rowspan=2|Event !rowspan=2|Country !colspan=2 style=\"background-color:gold;\"|Gold !colspan=2 style=\"background- color:silver;\"|Silver !colspan=2 style=\"background-color:#cc9966;\"|Bronze !rowspan=2|Ref |- !Athlete !Result !Athlete !Result !Athlete !Result |- |1983 Helsinki | Heptathlon | |Ramona Neubert |6714 |Sabine Paetz |6662 |Anke Vater |6532 | |- |1993 Stuttgart | 3000 m | |Qu Yunxia |8:28.71 |Zhang Linli |8:29.25 |Zhang Lirong |8:31.95 | |- |2001 Edmonton | 10,000 m | |Derartu Tulu |31:48.81 |Berhane Adere |31:48.85 |Gete Wami |31:49.98 | |- |rowspan=2|2005 Helsinki | 5000 m | |Tirunesh Dibaba |14:38.59 |Meseret Defar |14:39.54 |Ejegayehu Dibaba |14:42.47 || |- | 10,000 m | |Tirunesh Dibaba |30:24.02 |Berhane Adere |30:25.41 |Ejegayehu Dibaba |30:26.00 | |- |2007 Osaka | Long jump | |Tatyana Lebedeva |7.03 |Lyudmila Kolchanova |6.92 |Tatyana Kotova |6.90 | |- |rowspan=2|2011 Daegu | 10,000 m | |Vivian Cheruiyot |30:48.98 |Sally Kipyego |30:50.04 |Linet Masai |30:53.59 | |- | Marathon | |Edna Kiplagat |2:28:43 |Priscah Jeptoo |2:29:00 |Sharon Cherop |2:29:14 | |- |2015 Beijing | 5000 m | |Almaz Ayana |14:26.83 |Senbere Teferi |14:44.07 |Genzebe Dibaba |14:44.14 | |- |2019 Doha | 20km walk | |Liu Hong |1:32.53 |Qieyang Shenjie |1:33.10 |Yang Liujing |1:33.17 | |- |} ==See also== * List of medal sweeps in Olympic athletics ==Footnotes== ==References== * World Championships medal sweeps Category:World Athletics Championships ",
