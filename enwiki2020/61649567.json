    "text": "The Kawasaki Z750 twin is a twin-cylinder, touring motorcycle announced in 1975 and manufactured from 1976 to 1978. It was based on the smaller Kawasaki KZ400 introduced in 1975. The air cooled engine shared similar engine design with the KZ400 having chain-driven twin dynamic balancer shafts. The valve seats were hardened to allow use of low-grade fuel. The machine was engineered to have a wide power band and smooth torque curve.Kawasaki 76 range, New Motorcycling Monthly (Editor John Thorpe), IPC Magazines, January 1976, p.4 ==References== Category:Kawasaki motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1976 ",
