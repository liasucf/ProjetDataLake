Bankastr\u00e6ti n\u00fall ('0 Bank Street') is a collection of twenty-five essays about the 2008\u201311 Icelandic financial crisis by Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson.Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson, Bankastr\u00e6ti n\u00fall (Reykjav\u00edk: M\u00e1l og Menning, 2011). It takes its name from the euphemistic name of old public toilets at the end of Bankastr\u00e6ti in Reykjav\u00edk, which Einar M\u00e1r presents as a metaphor for the banking sector generally. In the assessment of Alda Kravic, > although digressive and playful, \u2018Bankastr\u00e6ti N\u00fall\u2019 remains an earnest > effort to retrieve lost connections between past and present, politics and > poetry, prosperity and poverty. Iceland\u2019s economic collapse was not an > isolated event but part of a global system that now binds Iceland and Haiti > closer together as captives of the IMF. Moreover, the persistent division > between the sciences and the arts and an ever-increasing specialisation of > labour only heightens our sense of fragmentation and alienation.Alda Kravec, > 'High Streets And Piss Pots: An introduction to Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson\u2019s new > book \u2018Bankastr\u00e6ti N\u00fall\u2019', The Reykjav\u00edk Grapevine (August 12, 2011), > http://grapevine.is/culture/art/2011/08/12/high-streets-and-piss-pots/. ==Translations== * Chapter 11, 'L\u00e6risveinar Miltons Friedman', has been translated into English as 'Disciples of Milton Friedman' by Alda Kravic.Alda Kravec, 'High Streets And Piss Pots: An introduction to Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson\u2019s new book \u2018Bankastr\u00e6ti N\u00fall\u2019', The Reykjav\u00edk Grapevine (August 12, 2011), http://grapevine.is/culture/art/2011/08/12/high-streets-and-piss- pots/. * Another chapter was translated as 'The Storyteller', Iceland Review, 50 (2) (2012), 26-29. * Passages from the book, mixed with others published in Einar M\u00e1r's Hv\u00edta b\u00f3kin, appear in Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson, 'Prologue: Some Poetic Thoughts Concerning Meltdown', in Gambling Debt: Iceland\u2019s Rise and Fall in the Global Economy, ed. by E.
