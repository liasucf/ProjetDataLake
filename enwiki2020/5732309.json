The original title for \"Mistake\" was \"Another Mistake\". \"Mistake\" was released as the debut single from Tightrope in the UK and Ireland, where it was released on 25 June 2007 with McIntosh promoting the album there in June 2007. In its first week on the chart, \"Mistake\" entered the UK Singles Chart at #168, on downloads alone. Then after its physical release, it jumped 121 places to #47. It is her strongest single in and outside of Australia to date, although it didn't reach the top 40 anywhere outside Australia. \"Mistake\" is featured on the Australian version of the Bratz: Motion Picture Soundtrack. \"Mistake\" was also briefly used in two scenes in the Australian comedy show Summer Heights High. ==Music video== The music video features Ryan Carnes, who acts on Desperate Housewives, a show of which McIntosh is a fan. It premiered on Video Hits on the morning of 1 July 2006, and is available to view on her official website. Stephanie has said that the video clip took 18 hours of shooting. The opening scene starts with McIntosh dumping her boyfriend and walking up to a house singing. Once she approaches the door she knocks and a man (Ryan Carnes) opens the door to let her in. After that McIntosh begins to get ready for her catering job and all the people arrive. McIntosh serves drinks as she sings but trips over. No one helps her up and everyone laughs except the man. She runs off to the bathroom and is almost in tears. She sings into the mirror and take off her white shirt revealing a green blondie T-shirt. The man walks in on her and they look at each other. Then they're walking in the main party area with the man leading her to an unknown place. It is soon discovered that it's a stage and McIntosh walks up and starts to sing. Everyone's cheering her on and she really gets into it. The ex-boyfriend comes in and she pours a drink all over him. Everyone laughs at him and the scene ends with McIntosh smiling and biting her lip. ==Track listing== *Australian CD single # \"Mistake\" -- 3:21 # \"Mistake\" (Jewels & Stone remix) -- 6:06 # \"Mistake\" (Black Fras remix) -- 4:23 *UK CD single # \"Mistake\" -- 3:21 # \"Mistake\" (Jewels & Stone remix) -- 6:06 A free signed poster was included as a special bonus with all copies of the Australian edition of \"Mistake\".
