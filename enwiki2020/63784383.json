The series is based on a real life experience between Heller and her partner Dan Harmon, in which she discovered that he had a sex doll. The series was originally developed as a television pilot, but the script was rewritten as a film and then split into less than 10-minute episodes to fit into the concept of Quibi. ==Cast== *Anna Kendrick as Cody Heller *Meredith Hagner as Barbara Himmelbaum-Harmon *Donal Logue as Dan Harmon ==Episodes== ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
