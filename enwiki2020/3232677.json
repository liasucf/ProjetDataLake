Built in 1824, it was the prototype of the 19th-century workhouse, and was cited by the Royal Commission on the poor law as the best example among the existing workhouses, before the resulting New Poor Law of 1834 led to the construction of workhouses across the country. It was designed by William Adams Nicholson an architect of Southwell and Lincoln, together with the Revd. John T. Becher, a pioneer of workhouse and prison reformMorrison K. (1999), The Workhouse: A Study of Poor -Law Buildings in England, English Heritage/RCHME, pp.36-40. It is described by the National Trust as the best- preserved workhouse in England. The building remained in use until the early 1990s, when it was used to provide temporary accommodation for mothers and children. Its acquisition by the National Trust reflects that organisation's wish to broaden its interests and to ensure the continued existence of a Grade II* listed building that was potentially to be turned into residential flats. Restoration work began with roof repairs in 2000 and is ongoing. Many rooms have been redecorated as they would have looked in the 19th century and buildings, walls and privies, which had been demolished in the 20th century, have been reinstated. In 2015 the property was featured in the four-part series 24 Hours in the Past, in which six celebrities experienced what life was like in Victorian Britain ==References== Notes Bibliography * ==External links== *The Workhouse, Southwell information at the National Trust * *BBC Radio 4: Fearnought (poems for Southwell Workhouse) Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Nottinghamshire Category:National Trust properties in Nottinghamshire Category:Workhouses in Nottinghamshire Category:Museums in Nottinghamshire Category:History museums in Nottinghamshire Category:Southwell, Nottinghamshire ",
