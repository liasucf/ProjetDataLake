It is responsible for properly constituting the laws of the sport. Along with World Bowls Ltd and the Professional Bowls Association (PBA), they run the World Bowls Tour (WBT) each year. Established in 1983 as the World Indoor Bowls Council. The inaugural World Indoor Championships was held in 1979 at Coatbridge. In 1987, a Ladies Section (WIBCLS) was founded, with the first WIBCLS Singles Championships taking place a year later. Following the 1992 tournament, a new organisation called the World Bowls Tour (WBT) was established, and by 1988 the World Indoor Singles and Pairs titles for men was run under the auspices of the WBT. Within twelve months, the Men and Ladies sections combined to form a newly constituted Council, resulting in the WIBC Men\u2019s and Ladies\u2019 World Championships.
