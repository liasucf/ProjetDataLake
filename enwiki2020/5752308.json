    "text": "\"Probudi me\" (English translation: \"Awake Me\") was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, performed in Croatian by E.N.I. The song was performed twenty-third on the night (following France's Fanny with \"Sentiments songes\" and preceding the United Kingdom's Katrina And The Waves with \"Love Shine a Light\"). At the close of voting, it had received 24 points, placing 17th in a field of 25. The song is an up-tempo number, with the girls singing about the best way to wake them up in the morning - with love, rather than coffee. It was succeeded as Croatian representative at the 1998 Contest by Danijela with \"Neka mi ne svane\". Category:Eurovision songs of 1997 Category:Eurovision songs of Croatia Category:1997 songs ",
