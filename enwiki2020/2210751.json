    "text": "', also known as Sarkese or Sark-French ('), is the Norman dialect of the Channel Island of Sark (Bailiwick of Guernsey). In the island it is sometimes known, slightly disparagingly, as the \"patois\", a French term meaning \"regional language\". Sarkese is in fact a descendant of the 16th century J\u00e8rriais used by the original colonists, 40 families mostly from Saint Ouen, Jersey who settled the then uninhabited island, although influenced in the interim by Guern\u00e9siais (the dialect of Guernsey). It is still spoken by older inhabitants of the island. Although the lexis is heavily anglicised, the phonology retains features lost in J\u00e8rriais since the 16th century. Most of the local placenames are in Sarkese. In former times, there may have been two subdialects of Sercquiais. It is also closely related to the Auregnais (Alderney) dialect, as well as Continental Norman. ==Written Sercquiais== Relatively little Sercquiais has been transcribed, and as there is no widely accepted form, it has received a certain amount of stigma as a result. A ruler of Sark, Sibyl Hathaway, who was a speaker herself, claimed that it could \"never be written down\", and this myth has continued in the years since then. The earliest published text in Sercquiais so far identified is the Parable of the Sower () from the Gospel of Matthew. Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, linguist, visited the Channel Islands in September 1862 in order to transcribe samples of the insular language varieties, which he subsequently published in 1863: Which in the NIV is translated as: : (3) \"[...] A farmer went out to sow his seed. : (4) As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. : (5) Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. : (6) But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. : (7) Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. : (8) Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop \u2014 a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. : (9) He who has ears, let him hear.\" ==Phonology== :(Note: Sercquiais not possessing a standard orthography, examples are given according to Liddicoat's Lexicon of Sark Norman French, Munich 2001) Sercquiais does not have the voiced dental fricative which is such a distinctive characteristic of St. Ouen in Jersey where most of the colonists came from. {| |- ! style=\"width:100px;\"|Sercquiais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|J\u00e8rriais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|English ! style=\"width:100px;\"|French |- |||||to read || lire |- |||||courage || courage |- |||||to iron || repasser (ferrer: to clad in iron) |} palatalisation of velars and (see Joret line) is less fully developed in Sercquiais than in J\u00e8rriais. Palatalisation in J\u00e8rriais of to and to has the equivalent in Sercquiais of and . For example, hiccup is in J\u00e8rriais and in Sercquiais; war is respectively and . Palatalisation of in J\u00e8rriais leads to , but in Sercquiais is generally retained: profession, trade in Sercquiais is , whereas J\u00e8rriais has palatalised to . is retained in Sercquiais where J\u00e8rriais has reduced to , as in to eat: (Sercquiais) \u2013 (J\u00e8rriais). Final consonants of masculine nouns in the singular are in free variation with null in all positions except in liaison. Final consonants are usually pronounced at ends of phrases. Final consonants are always lost in plural forms of masculine nouns. A cat may therefore be or in Sercquiais, but cats are . For comparison, J\u00e8rriais cat is usually pronounced , and the plural has the long vowel as in Sercquiais. It can also therefore be seen that length is phonemic and may denote plurality. Sercquiais has also retained final consonants that have been entirely lost in J\u00e8rriais, such as final in (meadow \u2013 in J\u00e8rriais as in French). Metathesis of is uncommon in Sercquiais, and in J\u00e8rriais, by comparison with Guern\u00e9siais. {| |- ! style=\"width:100px;\"|Sercquiais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|J\u00e8rriais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|Guern\u00e9siais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|English |- |||||||cross |- |||||||Wednesday |} The palatalised l, which in J\u00e8rriais has been generally palatalised to in initial position and following a consonant, is maintained in Sercquiais. {| |- ! style=\"width:100px;\"|Sercquiais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|J\u00e8rriais (li representing ) ! style=\"width:100px;\"|English |- |||||shoe polish (blacking) |- |||||patch |- |||||to place |- |||||roof |} Gemination occurs regularly in verb conjugations and gerunds, as in J\u00e8rriais but in distinction to Guern\u00e9siais. {| |- ! style=\"width:100px;\"|Sercquiais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|J\u00e8rriais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|Guern\u00e9siais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|English |- |||||||masonry |- |||||||I'll ask |} However, Sercquiais does not geminate palatal fricatives, unlike J\u00e8rriais: {| |- ! style=\"width:100px;\"|Sercquiais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|J\u00e8rriais ! style=\"width:100px;\"|English |- |||||brewery |- |||||armful |- |||||to eat |- |||||eating |} ==Conjugation of verbs== The St. Ouennais origins of Sercquiais can be seen in the 2nd and 3rd person plural forms of the preterite.
