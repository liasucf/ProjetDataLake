    "text": "The Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad (HR&PC;) was chartered in 1866 as a branch line railroad between New York City and Port Chester, New York. The line opened in 1873 as part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford commuter railroad and served in various capacities until 1971. The HR&PC; is now part of Amtrak's high-speed Northeast Corridor. ==History== Tracks along the Bronx River, south of Westchester Avenue Bronx River crossing The Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad was chartered April 23, 1866 as a branch line from the Harlem River at the north end of the Harlem Bridge (now the Third Avenue Bridge) in New York City to the Village of Port Chester in Westchester County, New York at the Connecticut state border. Only the southern portion was completed, terminating instead about five towns southwest of Port Chester in New Rochelle. At the time, New Rochelle was the final railroad station when traveling from Connecticut before entering New York City. The New York and New Haven Railroad and the Hartford and New Haven Railroad merged to create the larger New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1872. The HR&PC; was leased by the New Haven Railroad in 1873 and opened later that year, running from the New Haven at New Rochelle south into the Bronx.NYNH&H; History Leasing the line enabled the New Haven to establish a continuous line of service from Connecticut to Manhattan. The HR&PC; provided freight service between New York City and the Harlem River Yard. Commuter service ran along the line from the Harlem River Terminal up to main-line New Haven in New Rochelle until 1931. The New York, Westchester and Boston Railway commuter rail line opened in 1912, paralleling the HR&PC; just to the west, south of the crossing of the Bronx River. Until 1924, when a new combined station was built, the short Willis Avenue Spur of the elevated IRT Third Avenue Line ran to the Harlem River terminal of the HR&PC; and the NYW&B.; In 1917 the New York Connecting Railroad opened for passenger service between the HR&PC; at Port Morris and the Pennsylvania Tunnel and Terminal Railroad at Sunnyside Yard. This allowed NYNH&H; trains to run over the HR&PC; and into New York Penn Station, though most continued to serve Grand Central Terminal until Amtrak took over intercity operations in 1971. On January 1, 1927 the HR&PC; was merged into the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The NYNH&H; was merged into Penn Central in 1969, and Penn Central became part of Conrail in 1976. The HR&PC; was ultimately sold to Amtrak and is now part of their Northeast Corridor used by its high-speed Acela Express. ==Station listing== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Locality !Milepost !Station !Lat/long !Notes/Connections |- |rowspan=12|The Bronx||0.0||Harlem River Terminal / Willis Avenue||||Also connected to IRT spur and NYW&B; |- !colspan=5|NYCR joins HR&PC; from Hell Gate Bridge |- |0.91||Port Morris||||Also connected to NYW&B; |- |1.90||Casanova||||Also connected to NYW&B; |- |2.57||Hunt's Point||||Also connected to NYW&B.; Today a retail block |- |3.19||Westchester Avenue||||Also connected to NYW&B; |- |||West Farms|||| |- |||Van Nest|||| |- |||Morris Park|||| |- |||Westchester|||| |- |||Baychester|||| |- |||City Island||||Also called Bartow station |- |rowspan=4|Westchester||||Pelham Manor|||| |- ||||Woodside|||| |- !colspan=5|HR&PC; joins NYNH&H; Main Line |- |||New Rochelle|||| |- !colspan=9|Acquired by New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1927 |} ==See also== *New Haven Line *Oak Point Yard *List of New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad precursors ==References== ==Sources== *Railroad History Database *PRR Chronology Category:Predecessors of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Category:Transportation in Westchester County, New York Category:Transportation in the Bronx Category:Defunct New York (state) railroads Category:Railway companies established in 1866 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1927 Category:1866 establishments in New York (state) Category:1927 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:American companies disestablished in 1927 Category:American companies established in 1866 ",
