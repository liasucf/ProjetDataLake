    "text": "Telephone numbers in Taiwan use a system of area codes, beginning 02 to 08. The leading digit(s) following the area code denote the network operator (Chunghwa Telecom and its competitors). Mobile numbers begin 09. The international code for calls into Taiwan is 886. ==Area codes== Source: The emergency numbers in Taiwan are 110 (police) and 119 (fire and ambulance services). When making an inter-area long-distance call from within Taiwan, a long-distance prefix \"0\" is required. If calls are made from within the same area code, then the area code does not need to be included. Inter-area calls are defined as long-distance phone calls even when the two numbers have the same prefix. If calls are made from outside Taiwan, the \"0\" of the area code prefix is omitted. The following table of area codes includes this \"0\" prefix. The government reserves code 1 for Nanjing, the capital of the Republic of China according to the constitution, which it does not actually control. {|class=wikitable !Prefix !AreaChunghwa Telecom !Divisions !Digits !Notes |- |02 || Taipei || Taipei City, New Taipei City, Keelung City || align=\"center\"| 8 || Numbers that start with 2,3 and 8 are assigned to Chunghwa Telecom (ILEC- the main operator), Number ranges that start with 4, 5, 6 and 7 are competitive fixed network operators, such as Taiwan Fixed Network (TFN), New Century InfoComm LTD (NCIC), and Asia Pacific Telecom (APT), as Chunghwa Telecom no longer holds a monopoly in this market area. |- |03 || Taoyuan || Taoyuan City || align=\"center\"| 7 || starts with 2* (minor), 3 (Taoyuan District), 4* (Zhongli) Numbers start with ranges 21, 22, 28 are assigned to (CHT), Numbers start with 25 (APT), 26 (TFN), and 27 (NCIC) belong to competitive local operators.

However, as Taiwan was not an ITU member state, it had to be allocated the code 886 unofficially, with the ITU listing the code as 'reserved' until 2006.List of ITU-T Recommendation E.164, Assigned Country Codes, (Position on 1 May 2005) However, in that year, it formally allocated the code to \"Taiwan, China\".ITU Operational Bulletin, No. 870 \u2013 4 Until the late 1970s, Taiwan used the code 866, but the 86 code was reassigned to the People's Republic of China in conformity with the ITU's official membership, forcing Taiwan to utilize another code for countries that wished to maintain direct dial connections.The story of Taiwan's calling code, Taipei Times, 5 October 2010 ==References== ==External links== *ITU allocations list Taiwan Category:Telecommunications in Taiwan Category:Taiwan communications-related lists ",
