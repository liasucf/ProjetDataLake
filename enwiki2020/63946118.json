All of them show the four way contrast like most of the modern Indo-Aryan languages: * tenuis, as /p/, which is like \u27e8p\u27e9 in English spin * voiced, as /b/, which is like \u27e8b\u27e9 in English bin * aspirated, as /p\u02b0/, which is like \u27e8p\u27e9 in English pin, and * murmured or aspirated voiced, as /b\u02b1/. Apart from the retroflex series, all the rest four series show full phonological contrast in all positions.The retroflex tenius \u0288 and \u0288\u02b0 show full contrast in all positions. \u0256 and \u0256\u02b1 show phonological contrast mainly word-initially. Both are defective phonemes, occurring intervocalically an word finally only if preceded by a nasal consonant. Word finally and postvocalically, \u0256\u02b1 surfaces as or \u02b1. Non-initially, both are interchangeable with or and or respectively. ===Nasals=== and are present in all phonological positions. occurs only non-initially and is followed by a homorganic stop, which may be deleted if voiced, which leads to the independent presence of \u014b. occurs non-initially, followed by a homorganic stop, and is independent only in tatsama words, which is often replaced with n. occurs only non-initially and is followed by a homorganic stop always. It is the only nasal which does not occur independently. ===Fricatives=== and are most common fricatives. They show full phonological opposition. and , which is present in tatsama words, is replaced by most of the times, when independent. occurs before and before . and occurs in Perso-Arabic loanwords, generally replaced by and respectively. and also occurs in Sanskrit words (jihvamuliya and upadhmaniya), which is peculiar to Maithili. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"2\" | !Labial !Dental/ Alveolar !Retroflex !Palatal !Velar !Glottal |- ! rowspan=\"4\" |Stop/ Affricate !voiceless |\u092a |\u0924 |\u091f |\u091a |\u0915 | |- !aspirated |\u092b |\u0925 |\u0920 |\u091b |\u0916 | |- !voiced |\u092c |\u0926 |\u0921 |\u091c |\u0917 | |- !voiced aspirated |\u092d |\u0927 |\u0922 |\u091d |\u0918 | |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Fricative !voiceless |\u092b\u093c (~) |\u0938 |\u0937 () |\u0936 () |\u0916\u093c () | \u0903 -()* |- !voiced | |\u091c\u093c () | |\u091d\u093c () | |\u0939 () |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Nasal |\u092e |\u0928 |\u0923 |\u091e () |\u0919 | |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Flap and Trill consonants | |\u0930 |\u0921\u093c () \u0922\u093c () | | | |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Lateral | |\u0932 | | | | |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Approximant |\u0935 (~) | | |\u092f () | | |} * Fricative sounds only occur marginally, and are typically pronounced as a dental fricative // in most styles of pronunciation.\u0903 is always added after a vowel. * In most styles of pronunciation, the retroflex flap occurs marginally, and is usually pronounced as an alveolar tap // sound. * A retroflex nasal sound only occurs before a voiced retroflex // sound. * Approximant sounds and fricative sounds , mainly occur in words that are borrowed from Sanskrit or in words of Perso-Arabic origin. From Sanskrit, pu\u0282p(\u0259) as pu\u0278p(\u0259). Conjunct of \u0266j as \u0266\u0291 as in gra\u0266j\u0259 as gra\u0266\u0291\u0259. ===Non syllabic Vowels=== There are four non-syllabic vowels in Maithili- i\u032f, u\u032f, e\u032f, o\u032f written in Devanagari as \u092f\u093c, \u0935\u093c, \u092f\u093c\u0946, \u0935\u093c\u094a. Most of the times, these are written without nukta. ==References== Category:Maithili language Category:Indo-Aryan phonologies ",
