    "text": "Discipline is a song by the English electronic group Throbbing Gristle. ==Single== The \"Discipline\" single features two versions of the title track, recorded in Berlin and Manchester, respectively. The center labels are cream with black printing, and a Glossy picture sleeve depicts the band standing outside the ex-Nazi Ministry of Propaganda in Berlin, with another picture on the other side featuring Val Denham holding a Hitler Youth dagger centre back. The words \"Techno Primitive\" were scratched on side A and \"Psykick Youth Squad\" on side B. Both tracks were later released on the CD version of 20 Jazz Funk Greats. The word \"Techno Primitive\" was later used by electronic duo Chris & Cosey for their 1985 album of the same name, while the name \"Psykick Youth Squad\" can be seen as a reference to the later band Psychic TV, both groups made up of ex-Throbbing Gristle members. ===Track listing=== Side A: #\"Discipline (Manchester)\" - 8:06 Side B: #\"Discipline (Berlin)\" - 10:45 ==Song== \"Discipline\" may be Throbbing Gristle's most infamous song. First played at the S036 Club in Berlin (as documented on the single), it was at first entirely improvised, based upon a topic suggestion given by Cosey Fanni Tutti before the show. The song is driven by a minimal, pulsing synthesizer drumbeat, over which Genesis P-Orridge would declaim lyrics surrounding the concept of discipline, slowly introducing other musical elements, such as electric bass and walls of guitar or synth noise. After Berlin, it was played at nearly every TG show up to the group's demise. Often it would range in length from eight to twelve minutes, although it could be stretched out much longer: A version from one of their last shows at the Lyceum in London was over half an hour, as documented on the bootleg Once Upon a Time and the VHS release Destiny. The song was covered by Marc Almond and Friends on a flexi disc that was issued free with an issue of Flexi-Pop Magazine. He performed it solo on Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands tour at the Hammersmith Odeon, an extended version of the song forming the entirety of his set, which preceded The Cure, the main support band. Discipline was also covered by Boyd Rice and by German synthpop group Propaganda as \"Disziplin\". ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Chart (1981) ! scope=\"col\" | Peak position |- | UK Indie Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|43 |} ==References== ==Extended links== *Discogs entry Category:1981 singles Category:Throbbing Gristle songs Category:1981 songs ",
