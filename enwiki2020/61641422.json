    "text": "Cohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales Corporation (also known as CBC Film Sales or simply CBC) was an American film studio that was founded on June 19, 1918 by brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and their friend Joe Brandt. The studio released its first feature film More to Be Pitied Than Scorned on August 20, 1922. Brandt was the president of CBC Film Sales, handling sales, marketing and distribution from New York along with Jack Cohn, while Harry Cohn ran production in Hollywood. CBC Film's early productions were low-budget short subjects: \"Screen Snapshots\", the \"Hall Room Boys\" (the vaudeville duo of Edward Flanagan and Neely Edwards), and the Chaplin imitator Billy West.The Hollywood Story, by Joel Waldo Finler, page 81 The start-up CBC leased space in a Poverty Row studio on Hollywood's famously low-rent Gower Street. Among Hollywood's elite, the studio's small-time reputation led some to joke that \"CBC\" stood for \"Corned Beef and Cabbage\". The studio's last film to be released was Innocence on December 1, 1923. The Cohn brothers renamed the CBC Film Sales as Columbia Pictures on January 10, 1924, in hopes to improve its image. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Release date ! Title !
