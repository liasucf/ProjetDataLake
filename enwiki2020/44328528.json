The Ministry also performs a critical and far- reaching role in developing e-government programs and boosting capacity and digital literacy to foster a technology-friendly environment that introduces innovative approaches to how we communicate, live and work. == Programs Overview == ===e-Government === All around the world, technology is enhancing people's everyday lives. Technology allows us to do the things we need to get done, in ways that are simpler, easier and faster than ever before. For governments, technology offers new opportunities to connect with, and meet the needs of, members of the public and the business world, while also giving government employees the tools they need to build a world-class civil service that is more efficient, open and innovative. e-Government uses technology to deliver real benefits for people who access government services. This can involve making transactions available online, simplifying websites to make them easier to use, and creating innovative new applications that improve people's lives. e-Government initiatives aim to increase the availability, accessibility, and effectiveness of e-services to citizens, residents and businesses; enable an integrated and efficient government through innovative use of ICT; and improve government transparency and stimulate participation in the democratic process. The Qatar Government Portal \u201cHukoomi\u201d, a safe and reliable gateway to a wide range of information and e-services at all ministries and government agencies, was launched in 2008 and made available to citizens, residents and visitors round the clock, with the purpose of linking the public to the Government services, programs, events, and initiatives and to enhance transparency. To further improve the quality of Government services and make them more responsive to all categories of users, an improved version of \u201cHukoomi\u201d was launched in 2010 in cooperation with government agencies and public service providers. === Digital Society === The Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (ictQATAR) informs, inspires and supports all people in Qatar to gain the skills, knowledge and understanding they need to use ICT effectively and safely so that they can engage in the country's economic and cultural life and to support the development of a vibrant and capable ICT vocational and professional workforce in Qatar. ictQATAR is keen on enhancing ICT readiness and usage of all members of society and businesses so that everyone can participate in building Qatar's information-based economy. Digital Society Key Programs: * Digital Inclusion: The program targets segments of society that are at the risk of digital exclusion by creating opportunities for access, learning and effective use of technology. * Digital Literacy: A program aiming to raise awareness and foster a healthy cyber culture in which all Qatar's population has the knowledge and critical understanding necessary to engage in safe online opportunities. * ICT Skills: Aims at raising awareness and inspiring take-up of a wide array of possible ICT careers, in addition to developing a highly skilled and well-qualified ICT workforce to enrich Qatar's knowledge-based economy. * Digital Impact and Emerging Technologies: Better known as the Rassed research program, this area of Digital Society focuses on studying the effects of ICT and the Internet on society, and enabling a better understanding of emerging digital technologies and their potential. === Cyber Security === Protecting Qatar's critical ICT infrastructure and systems is a top priority for the Ministry. To accomplish this, ictQATAR formed the Qatar Computer Emergency Response Team, Q-CERT. Q-CERT works with government agencies, private and public sector organizations and Qatar's citizens to ensure that online threats are monitored and risks are contained. Q-CERT works to protect sensitive information and ensure safety on the Internet. Since information security issues are not limited by national boundaries, Q-CERT is a member of FIRST, the global forum of incident response and security teams. FIRST fosters regional ties between security teams and partners around the world in order to share up-to-date information about threats and vulnerabilities. == National Strategies == The Ministry has launched three key national-level strategies that will accelerate Qatar's efforts towards becoming a secure, knowledge-based, accessible economy. The Qatar e-Government Strategy 2020 aims for better government services, lowered public spending and full coordination between government entities. The Qatar National Cyber Security Strategy, collaboratively developed by ictQATAR and the National Cyber Security Committee, represents a blueprint for moving forward to improve Qatar's cyber security toward a secure cyberspace to safeguard national interests and preserve the fundamental rights and values of the society. The Inclusion through Technology Strategy, developed for greater enablement of the people with disabilities through technology, will be implemented by the Qatar Assistive Technology Center (Mada). == References == == External links == * Ministry of Information and Communications Technology Official Website Category:2013 establishments in Qatar Category:Communications ministries Category:Ministries established in 2013 Category:Government ministries of Qatar Category:Telecommunications in Qatar ",
