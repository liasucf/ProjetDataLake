After evaluating their performance on the runway and in front of the lens, each judge alternates in picking a contestant for their team from the pool of selected finalists. ===Challenges=== Each episode contains a challenge focusing on elements important to modeling. The contestants are graded on a numerical basis, each earning a score for their performance. The team with the most points at the end of the challenge wins collectively, regardless of any individual losses or wins in the challenge. Challenges in the later half of the competition are won individually. ===Judging and elimination=== For judging, a panel of experts evaluates each contestants' performance on the photo shoot and determines who will be eliminated, with the mentors having little to no say in the final decision. Elimination follows the same format as a regular Top Model show, but the call- out takes place individually in each of the teams. This means that the last girl who has not received a photo in each team, must join the other one for elimination. In cases where both the worst and the second worst performers are in the same team, both are sent for elimination, while all of the members of the other team remain safe. The contestant who does not receive a photo is automatically eliminated. ==Seasons== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%; width:100%; text-align: center;\" |- ! style=\"width:5%;\"|Season ! style=\"width:10%;\"|Premiere date !width=15%|Winner !width=15%|Runner-up ! style=\"width:49%;\"|Other contestants in order of elimination ! style=\"width:5%;\"|Number of contestants ! style=\"width:8%;\"|Destination |- !1 | |Kiki Kang |Yang Liu |Liu Yan Hong, Zheng Shi Hui, Zhong Lu Chun (quit), Cai Hui, Linda Cui, Dong Lei, Yang Duo Lan & Ren Rui, Zhang Hao Yue, Gu Ai Jia, Chen Xi, Yao Xue Fei |14 | Melbourne |-style=\"background: #D0E6FF;\" !2 | |Zhao Jia Tong |Wang Meng Ya |Jiang Yun Xuan, Ma Hui Hui, Long Jun Jiao & Li Meng Qi, Chen Yu Ting, Wang Xi Ran, Wang Shu Qi, Na Guang Zi, Sun Chen Min, Bi Jing & Liu Xin Jie, Ma Meng Jia |14 | London |- !3 | |Yan Yu Bo |Fu Huan Huan |Chen Xiao Han & Li Ya Wen, Niu Wei Wei, Jinx Zhou, Naomi Kang, Kelly Qian (quit), Dong Yi Hang, Wang Xin Lei & Han Hong Pan, Lou Qing, Abby Jiang, Pang Ying |14 | |} ==See also== *China's Next Top Model ==References== ==External links== *Weibo site *Season 1 website *Season 2 website Category:2015 Chinese television series debuts Category:Chinese-language television shows Category:Modeling-themed reality television series Category:IQIYI original programming ",
