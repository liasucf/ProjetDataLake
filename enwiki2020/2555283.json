It is located in Kaunas County in central Lithuania, north east of Kaunas, the second-largest city in Lithuania. It is served by Kaunas International Airport. Achema, the largest fertilizer factory in the Baltic states, is located nearby. The city is sometimes called \"the capital of midsummer holiday\" (lt. \u2013 Jonin\u0117s). == History == Jonava was officially established as a city in the 18th century during the times of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1750 first wooden church has been built in Jonava. In 1778 beer brewery was operating in the town. Around 1812 Napoleon and his army invaded the town and its surrounding villages. In 1923 Jonava officially recognised as city-status settlement and in 1950 it became centre of municipality. The city had a large Jewish population before World War II - in 1893 92% of the population was Jewish and in 1941 it was 80%. In 1932 there were 250 shops owned by Jewish families, a Jewish bank, 7 synagogues and a Jewish school.Travel Lietuva - Jonava During World War II Jonava was attacked by Nazi Germany. A Christian church and five Jewish synagogues were destroyed. The Jews of the city were killed in two massacres, in August and September 1941. A total of 2,108 people were executed by an Einsatzgruppen of Germans and Lithuanian Self-Defence Units. 200 remaining Jews were kept prisoners at the Kaunas ghetto. After the war the city built the largest fertilizer factory in the Baltic states and Jonava become one of 4 biggest industrial cities in Lithuania. == Environmental catastrophe == An explosion occurred in the chemical fertilizers factory on 20 March 1989, causing a leakage of nearly 7,500 tonnes of liquid ammonia. The catastrophe developed further into a fire within the nitrophosphate facility and fertilizer storehouses polluting the atmosphere with products of their combustion, such as nitrous oxide and chlorine. The toxic cloud drifted towards Ukmerg\u0117, \u0160irvintos and K\u0117dainiai. The concentration of ammonia surpassed the permissible level by a factor of 150 in Upninkai, at 10 km from the disaster site. One day after the accident, a toxic cloud 7 km wide and 50 km long was recorded between Jonava and K\u0117dainiai. Seven people died during the fire and leakage of ammonia immediately afterward, 29 people became handicapped, and a large number of people suffered from acute respiratory and cardiac attacks. The true extend of damages and health impact from the event is however unknown. What is known is that exposure to ammonia prenatally, especially at a young age can cause serious brain damage. ==Administrative divisions== Jonava is divided into 13 city regions: {| | *Senamiestis *Girel\u0117 || *Mi\u0161k\u0173 \u016bkis *Paneriai || *Lietava *Lak\u0161tingalos || *Juodmena *Gele\u017einkelio stotis || *Baldininkai *Rimkai || *Kosmonautai *Skaruliai *Virbalai |} ==Demography== ===Historical population=== {|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !Year!!Inhabitants |- |1939||5500 |- |1959||5000 |- |1970||14563 |- |1979||28413 |- |1989||36520 |- |2001||34954 |- |2011||30777 |- |2017||27809 |} ==Sport== The city has its own \"physical culture and sports center\" with stadium, swimming pool and indoor arena.
