The Stari Most, in particular, is considered an exemplary piece of Balkan Islamic architecture. Legend has it that Hayruddin was convinced his design would fail and, after nine years of construction, prepared himself to die on the day the bridge was finally unveiled. Hayruddin's design was to endure until the destruction of the bridge by Croat forces in 1993. The Sultan Bayezid II complex is located on the banks of the Tunca River, consisting of a mosque, medical school, hospital and bathhouse, attracts some 7,000 tourists daily. Mimar Hayr\u00fcddin is considered to be one of the founders of the classical Ottoman style in architecture. == References == Category:Architects of the Ottoman Empire Category:16th-century people of the Ottoman Empire Category:16th century in Bosnia and Herzegovina ",
