    "text": "Newspapers in Korea was a reflection of times that included opposite values of enlightenment and water polo, anti-Japanese and pro-Japanese, democracy and anti-democraticism. == The Enlightenment (1883 - 1910) == The Enlightenment period was from 1883 to 1910, before the Japanese colonial era. During the transplant period (1883-1888), Hanseong Sunbo and Hanseong Jubo, Korea's first modern newspapers, were published. Hanseong Sunbo Later, during the period of birth (1896-1904), Independent Newspaper was founded by Seo Jae-pil, and during the period of struggle (1904-1910), Daehan Maeil Shinbo, Hwangseong press, and Daeguk press were founded against the Japanese. === Hanseong Sunbo (\u6f22\u57ce\u65ec\u5831) === Hanseong Sunbo was the first modern newspaper in Korea. It was published three times monthly by Park Mun-guk, Seoul beginning on October 31, 1883. Thereafter, it was published on the first day of each month. In 1882, Park Young-hyo and his group visited Japan as receptionists (an envoy sent to Japan during King Gojong's reign in the late Joseon Dynasty) and brought back several Japanese people, including journalists and printers, to help produce newspapers. Park Yeong-Hyo, who was soon appointed to Hanseongbu Panyun after returning to Korea, frequently visited the palace and stressed to King Gojong the necessity of the newspaper. Oon February 28, 1883, King Gojong ordered the Hansung Department to take charge of publishing the newspaper. The articles were largely divided into domestic and international articles. The domestic articles include government gazette, private newsletter, and city council information, and the best articles of each country focus on war or conflict between powerful and weak countries at the time, modern military equipment or defense measures, and blossoming culture. === Hanseong Jubo (\u6f22\u57ce\u5468\u5831) === As the first weekly newspaper in Korea, Hanseong Jubo was founded on January 25, 1886, in the form of a double edition of Hanseong Sunbo. Its founding history reveals, the paper made it its greatest mission to be loyal to the king and to make the people realize. Sunbo and Jubo had something in common, in that they were issued by Bak Mun-guk, which was established by the government to publish newspapers, and the purpose of publication was the same. === Independent newspaper === Independent newspaper The Independent Newspaper (1896.4. 7\u20131899. 12.4) was the first private newspaper in Korea and was launched by Seo Jae-pil on April 7, 1896. The Independent Newspaper was the first newspaper published by civilians, and reflects a clear difference between the content and the way they are operated. The newspaper was characterized by its emphasis on modern nationalism, democratic ideas, and independent modernization, educating and enlightening the people. The paper also emphasized the urgency and importance of the new education, believing that education is the most urgent priority to strengthen the country and speed up the enlightenment. Third, for the first time, it taught the people the idea of democracy and insisted on the need for national suffrage and the establishment of a parliament. Fourth, it emphasized the reform of social customs, such as the upsurge of public morality, national unity, rectification of the evil wind of slander, and cultivation of the attitude of living, contributing to society. Fifth, it emphasized that the power of the country comes from the modern development of industry. Sixth, it condemned the tyranny and corruption of bureaucrats and emphasized compliance and the creation of a fair social climate. Seventh, the international situation surrounding Korea at that time was in critical condition; constantly raising awareness that there was a risk of losing independence without national awakening, and emphasized to be wary of foreign influence. When the independent newspaper accused high-ranking government officials of corruption and denounced the invasion of interests by the powers, representing the interests of the nation and leading public opinion, disgruntled Russian legation and water poloists plotted Seo Jae-pil's expulsion. Japan has also entered a closed path in line with the move. == Japanese colonial era (1910 - 1945) == At this time, there were private newspapers published by Koreans and newspapers issued by the Governor-General. These private and institutional papers contained conflicting content. === Resistance press === Resistance newspapers were the centerpiece of the national movement as well as a window to introduce foreign ideas and record all aspects of life in colonial Joseon, including politics, economy, culture, and education. ====Chosun Ilbo and Dong-A Ilbo==== The Chosun Ilbo and Dong-A Ilbo, published in the Japanese occupation, the three 'private newspapers' times. The Jegi Ilbo, which was founded by Choe Nam-seon in 1924, was later published by 1936, with its title changed to the Joong-Ang Ilbo, JoongAng Ilbo, and Chosun JoongAng Ilbo. Until the Japanese Government-General's forced closure of all Korean-issued private papers in August 1940, newspapers were a record of all the life of colonial Joseon, including politics, economy, culture, and education, as well as a window for introducing and bringing in foreign ideas, and being the center of the national movement. The newspaper company was a gathering place for talent and a presentation stage for literary works. === Governor-General's newspaper === The Governor-General issued the newspapers in three languages, streamlining, glorifying and promoting colonial rule. Maeil Shinbo ==== Gyeongseong Ilbo, Maeil Shinbo, Seoul press ==== The Governor-General rationalized, glorified, and promoted colonial rule by publishing three organ papers: Korean (Maeil Shinbo), Japanese (Kyungsung Ilbo), and English (The Seoul Press). Government organ is important, the diplomatic value in the Japanese occupation was the study of history. Maeil Shinbo was incorporated into the Gyeongseong Ilbo until it was spun off as an independent corporation in 1938, and managed by a Japanese president. Maesin the Japanese occupation for 35 years uninterrupted and the only Korean newspaper published. After Korea's liberation from Japan's colonial rule, the title was changed to Seoul The Gyeongseong Ilbo was published in Japanese until December 10, 1945, even after the collapse of the Japanese colonial rule. After the forced annexation of Korea and Japan, the Japanese Government- General of Korea issued the three-language organ \"Kyungsung Ilbo,\" \"Maeil Shinbo\" and \"The Seoul Press.\" The three organizations were established as separate newspapers before the annexation of Korea, and after the annexation, they promoted and promoted Japan's colonial rule and justified the war of aggression. == Korean Independence == Since Korea's liberation from Japan's colonial rule, numerous periodicals, including newspapers and magazines, have emerged in response to media oppression. Also, the media was divided into left and right, causing confusion. === Left-right confrontational press === Liberation Daily ==== Chosun's People Daily press and Liberation Daily. ==== The left-wing group took the lead in the press by first taking control of the facilities for printing newspapers. The leading left-wing newspapers were the Chosun's People Daily and the Liberation Daily. Founded on September 8, 1945, the Korean People's Daily was founded by Korean employees working in the Gyeongseong Ilbo, which was first published by Kim Jeong-do, but since late October, Hong Jeung-sik, a big figure in the left-wing media community, changed to editor- in-chief and publisher, serving as the organ of the Communist Party. The number of printing facilities immediately after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule was very small and most of them belonged to Japanese people. The Communist Party of Korea not only received the Gonozawa Printing Office in Sogong-dong, Seoul, which was the best facility at the time, but also recruited the publishing labor union. Chosun's people daily press was the first daily newspaper in Seoul after the August 15 Liberation, and on September 8, left-wing reporters from the Gyeongseong Ilbo, the official newspaper of the Japanese Government-General of Korea, were founded as tabloid Korean newspapers. The Liberation Daily was founded in 1945 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Korea in Seoul. == Military government (1960-1980) == The military government After May 16, 1961, the military government conducted a complete overhaul of newspapers and news agencies. A year later, the military government strongly pushed ahead with its media policy to reform the structure of the media, announcing a 25-point \"press policy\" and \"press policy implementation standards.\" The Dong-A and Chosun incident occurred due to the intervention of government authorities, the press freedom protection movement, the suppression of advertisements, and labor-management conflicts. === The Dong-A and Chosun incidents === On the surface, it was a conflict between the reporters and management of the two leading newspapers, Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo. However, this incident exposed the problems faced by the media, such as the dismissal of a large number of journalists in the 1970s, as well as the discord between journalists and business owners. ==== Dong-A ilbo incident ==== The Dong-A Ilbo incident started directly with the union formation of reporters. On March 7, 1974, 33 reporters from the Dong-A Ilbo formed the Dong-A Ilbo Branch of the National Publishing Workers' Union. The company, however, began to fire the reporters in line with Dong-A Ilbo's traditional policy of not recognizing labor unions. The union filed a lawsuit against it, leading to conflicts and complicated lawsuits. In the midst of such labor- management conflicts, the Dong-A Ilbo dismissed or suspended reporters between March 10 and April 1975, forcing 134 reporters, producers and announcers to leave the company as a whole. ==== Chosun ilbo incident ==== Just around this time, the Chosun Ilbo dismissed the two journalists for \"infringing their editorial rights.\" As a result, a total of 58 journalists were dismissed or suspended indefinitely by the end of March the following year due to worsening conflicts between management and reporters, but 33 reporters were dismissed as they canceled disciplinary action. === Media Integration and Abandoned Incident === In 1980, consolidation of newspapers, broadcasting, and telecommunications under the leadership of the new military The Jun Doo-hwan forces, which took control of the power due to the December 12 incident, established a press team (Lee Sang-jae) at the intelligence office of the security company in early 1980 and merged media companies to control the media essential to the power struggle, and dismissed journalists who were resistant or critical. The reason for the merger was that the media companies have become insolvent and a hotbed of corruption due to the turmoil of media organizations, undermining the sound media climate. The voluntary closure or consolidation was only a formality, and in fact, the New Military Department's security division led the move. The new military, including Jun Doo-hwan, was found to be part of a ruling scenario in which the government forcibly merged media outlets such as newspapers, broadcasters, and news agencies under the guise of improving the structure of the media to complete the rebellion of the new military forces. == References == Category:Mass media in Korea Category:History of Korea ",
