Yielding to gravity\u2014not flopping, but finding the yield and push-\"dance students begin to discover that yielding isn't always about the places in your body you're thinking about.

Laura Molzhan, in The Chicago Reader, writes that \"Jan Erkert is the best kind of magician, conjuring up feeling without ever grabbing for heartstrings or resorting to throbbing violins. Instead the dry, hard, everyday facts of the dance accumulate until they're like a mound of stones on the heart--and we're forced to notice our own sorrow. Then, just as magically, noticing takes the sorrow away and leaves the heart free and open.\"Laura Molzhan, \"Jan Erkert and Dancers\", The Chicago Reader, March 27, 1997, , accessed April 14, 2010 ==References== == External Links == Jan Erkert Records at the Newberry Library Category:Living people Category:American choreographers Category:Columbia College Chicago faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
