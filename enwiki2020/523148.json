    "text": "Lloyd Wayne Maines (born June 28, 1951) is an American country music record producer, musician and songwriter. He was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall Of Fame as one of the first three members, the other two being Willie Nelson and Stevie Ray Vaughan. He is the father of Natalie Maines who is best known as the lead singer of The Chicks. ==Life and career== Maines was born and raised in Lubbock, Texas, and is now based in Austin, Texas. Arguably best known as a pedal steel player, Maines is a multi-instrumentalist who has also performed and/or recorded playing dobro, electric and acoustic guitar, mandolin, lap steel guitar, banjo and bell tree. He toured and recorded as a member of the Joe Ely Band and has also played with Jerry Jeff Walker, Guy Clark, Butch Hancock, Terry Allen, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Golden Bear,[ Golden Bear album credits], AllMusic and other Texas musicians. Maines was a member of The Maines Brothers Band in the late 1970s and early 1980s and has contributed to alt-country releases, including Uncle Tupelo's Anodyne and Wilco's debut, AM. Maines began producing some of his own music, branching out beginning with other country artists, early on starting with Terry Allen's seminal 1979 album, Lubbock (On Everything). He has produced and worked on recording projects with numerous artists, including the Bad Livers, Richard Buckner, Roger Creager, Pat Green, Butch Hancock, Wayne Hancock, Terri Hendrix, Rita Hosking, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Intocable, Robert Earl Keen, the Lost Gonzo Band, Bob Livingston, Charlie Robison, Owen Temple, Two Tons of Steel, Jerry Jeff Walker, The Waybacks, and Martin Zellar. He frequently tours with Terri Hendrix throughout the United States, and is a major part of her band and production as an artist. Maines won a Grammy Award for Best Country Album in 2003 as producer of the The Chicks' album, Home. As the father of Natalie Maines, lead singer of The Chicks, he was instrumental in bringing the current lineup of bandmates together in 1995, which jump-started their sudden popularity and change in sound. Susan Gibson's \"Wide Open Spaces\", which had been sent to Maines, proved to be a hit from their debut album, and has remained their signature song. As of 2020, Lloyd Maines, on guitars, has accompanied singer/songwriter Terri Hendrix live and in recordings since 1997 and her second album. ==See also== *Music of Austin ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Interview with Lloyd Maines *[ Complete Lloyd Maines discography] ===Archival Materials=== * Steve Maines papers, 1964-2015, at Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library, Texas Tech University Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lubbock, Texas Category:American country guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American country record producers Category:Musicians from Austin, Texas Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Pedal steel guitarists Category:American session musicians Category:Steel guitarists Category:Guitarists from Texas Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:People from Bulverde, Texas Category:Country musicians from Texas Category:Record producers from Texas Category:20th-century American male musicians ",
