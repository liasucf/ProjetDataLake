He was a committed Marxist, and had to leave Spain after the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339). While in exile he taught at the University of Santiago, the University of Havana and the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He returned to Spain and became a Senator for Asturias for a while before returning to Mexico, where he died. ==Life== Wenceslao Roces Su\u00e1rez was born on 3 February 1897 in Soto de Sobrescobio, Oviedo, Asturias. His parents were Lucas Roces and Mar\u00eda Su\u00e1rez. He graduated in Law from the University of Oviedo and took his doctorate from the University of Madrid in 1922. He then studied in Germany, and at the age of 26 was given the chair of Roman Law at the University of Salamanca. There he taught historical legal studies until 1931. He published several articles in the Revista de derecho privado of Madrid. Roces married Carmen Dorronsoro, with whom he had two children. He was drawn into the turbulent politics of Spain in the inter-war years, and became a militant activist in the Spanish Communist Party. He would remain a committed Marxist until his death. From 1936 to 1939 he was Undersecretary of the Ministry of Education and Fine Arts in the Republican government. He also directed the C\u00e9nit and Logos publishing houses, and translated many works into Spanish from different languages, but mainly from German. Roces was forced to leave Spain after the end of the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339). He taught at the universities of Santiago, Chile and Havana, Cuba between 1940 and 1942. He then moved to the National Autonomous University of Mexico intending to teach Roman Law at the Faculty of Law. He chose to join the Faculty of Arts, where he was a full professor and taught Greek History, History of Rome, Historical Materialism & Ancient History and Marxist Philosophy. After returning to Spain he was elected Senator, but resigned from that position due to disagreement with the direction of the Communist Party of Spain, and went back to Mexico.
