Basically, the eastern part of the Khizi plateau flows through the Gilazi to the Caspian Sea. Khizi, the center of the district, is 104 km from Baku and is the closest to the capital.

There are preconceptions about the etymology of the word \"x\u0131z\u0131\" which was previously used to represent a small village. Many experts assume that this name is from the Sassanid Empire. In the early Middle Ages (III-VI centuries), the Iranian tribes were transferred here to spread the Zoroastrianism, the official religion of the Empire, in northern territories of the empire, to combat Christianity and protect the northern borders from Hun, Peach and Khazar tribes. This process further strengthened after the Shirvanshahs were defeated by the Safavids. The tribes who moved here were mainly from Khuzistan. The name was gradually transformed into the form of Khizi in our time. According to another version, the toponym Khizi is derived from the word \"Khazar\". From history it is known that for several centuries the Khazars dominated the territories of the Caspian, Black and Baltic seas. As the 8th century Arab historian Ibn Fadlan writes, the Muslim part of the Turkic-speaking Khazar people was headed by one of the representatives of the Khizi tribe. The Khizi tribe lived in the northern part of Azerbaijan in the II century BC. According to another version, the Turkic word \"khyz\" - quickly, rapidly, hastily gave the name of the area. == Geography == The climate of this place is mild and the air is dry. A large part of the district territory is covered with forests. One of the most beautiful villages of Azerbaijan \u2013 Altiagac is located in Khizi district. The Shirvanshahs and their camel caravans were passing through Altiagac on their way from Shamakhi to Guba. Altiagac was a place where travelers had been camping. Previously, the word \"agac\" was used as a measure of length. The tree was about 7 kilometers, and the distance from Shamakhi to Altiagac was 42 km. == Landscapes == Khizi District is one of the regions with large forest areas in Azerbaijan (9931 ha, 6%). The area has excessive biodiversity, landscape and ecosystem diversity. There are forest, forest-desert, steppe, desert, gray mountains, subalp and alpine ecosystems. The forest dendroflora consists mainly of iberian oak, eastern oak, eastern peanut, pine tree, juniper, pearl, common.

Mammals are found in species such as European caterpillars, brown bear boar, rattan rounds, gray rabbits, foxes, hawthorn, wolves, poultry, quail, shepherd, wild aneurysm, gray gooseberry and thrush. The district is the famous with Beshbarmag mountsain. The rock has been named like this because from a distance it resembles an open palm. Sometimes Khizi is called the country of the red mountains. == Historical monuments == There is a graveyard 300\u2013500 in the former Shikhlar village cemetery located near the village of Tikhti. This tomb is likely to be the Sheikh Heydar's Tomb (X-V century). According to some sources, Sheikh Heydar's tomb is the grave of Sheikh Heydar, the father of Ismayil I, the founder of the Safavid Empire. In 1483 and 1487 he made two campaigns - in Dagestan and Shirvan, which frightened all the rulers of the region, including Sultan Yagub. In order to prevent further strengthening of the positions of Sheikh Heydar, Sultan Yagub helped Shirvanshah Farrukh Yasar to resist him. Sheikh Heydar Shirvanshah died in the Battle of Tabasaran (1488) and was buried in the area opposite the sacred Beshbarmak mountain. Later, Ismayil Safavi, who defeated the Shirvanshahs state, built a tomb on his father's grave, attacked the Shikhlar village and declared the mausoleum a sacred sanctuary. The tower of Beshbarmag, the remains of the lost city of the 5th century, the mausoleum of Sheikh Heydar, the remains of the fallen stone fence of the tower of Khizi relating to Vth century, the 15th century sanctuary in the village of Khialandzh are all examples of historical monuments. == Population == According to the State Statistics Committee, as of 2018, the population of city recorded 16,800 persons, which increased by 3,600 persons (about 27 percent) from 13,200 persons in 2000. 8,300 of total population are men, 8,500 are women.
