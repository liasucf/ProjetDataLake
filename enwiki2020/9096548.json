    "text": "Results of the 1979 general election in Japan for the House of Representatives. A total of 511 seats were contested. Prime Minister \u014chira Masayoshi's announcement that a consumption (sales) tax would be imposed was a hot-button issue in the run-up to the election. Facing widespread public disapproval, the prime minister abandoned the tax proposal. The prime minister's party, the Liberal Democratic Party, ended up losing one seat, while the Japan Communist Party experienced a surge in voter support, which mostly came at the expense of the Japan Socialist Party and the LDP-breakaway New Liberal Club. == References == 1979 Category:1979 elections in Japan Category:October 1979 events in Asia ",
