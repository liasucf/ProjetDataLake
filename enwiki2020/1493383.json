    "text": "Cerro El C\u00f3ndor is a stratovolcano in Argentina. Cerro El C\u00f3ndor is a remote peak in the Argentine Puna de Atacama. As such it was probably the last major 6000m+ peak in the Andes to be climbed, with the summit reaching a height of . The volcano has the form of a massif (which covers a surface of ) constructed by two separate volcanoes; the older edifice forms parts of the northern and eastern flanks which are cut by scarps interpreted as caldera remnants.Grosse et al. 2018, p.14 The summit region is formed by the newer edifice, and features a series of craters with diameters of and a cover of pyroclastic material and scoria. Also part of the newer phase are extensive lava flows which form the western and parts of the eastern and southern slopes and reach distances of from the summit.Grosse et al. 2018, p.15 Surrounding volcanoes include Condorito (which is considered to be part of the old El C\u00f3ndor volcano), Falso Azufre and Laguna Escondida which have constrained the extent of El C\u00f3ndor's lava flows. The volcano rises within the Laguna Amarga caldera,Grosse et al. 2018, p.14 and an older mafic monogenetic volcano lies north of El C\u00f3ndor.Grosse et al. 2018, p.15 Radiometric dating has yielded ages of 2.89 - 2.67 million years ago to 0.13 - 0.02 million years ago, with the volcano developing in two phases.Grosse et al. 2018, p.14 The older group of ages has been obtained on the Condorito and the older edifice, while the ages of 130,000 years ago and younger come from the younger edifice and lava flows; some of these dates have high uncertainties (one young age is 20,000 \u00b1 30,000 years ago from the western flank)Grosse et al. 2018, pp.16-17 and Holocene eruptions in the summit region are possible. Presently, C\u00f3ndor is considered to be a dormant volcano with the potential of future activity, and while the remoteness of the volcano reduces any hazard potential future pyroclastic eruptions could impact air traffic over the region and east of it.Grosse et al. 2018, p.19 Cerro El C\u00f3ndor is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes together with about 110 other Quaternary volcanoes, and lies in the southern sector of the volcanic zone;Grosse et al. 2018, p.2 other volcanic zones in the Andes are the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone.Grosse et al. 2018, p.3 The history of volcanic activity is poorly known for most of these volcanoes owing to the lack of dating; only a few historical eruptions have been recorded, such as an eruption at Ojos del Salado in 1993.Grosse et al. 2018, p.2 The volcano has erupted trachyandesite and trachydacite in the later stages of activity, after a stage with andesitic to dacitic eruptions.Grosse et al. 2018, p.7 The rocks define a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite.Grosse et al. 2018, p.15 ==See also== * List of volcanoes in Argentina * List of mountains in Argentina * List of mountains in the Andes * List of Ultras of South America ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * \"El C\u00f3ndor, Argentina\" on Peakbagger Category:Stratovolcanoes of Argentina Category:Subduction volcanoes Category:Mountains of Argentina Category:Polygenetic volcanoes Category:Six-thousanders of the Andes ",
