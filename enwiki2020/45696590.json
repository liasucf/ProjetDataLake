Although the main characters are a matador and an actress, there are no bull fighting or theater scenes portrayed in the film. ==Plot== As described in a film magazine, matador Vasco Lopez (Hayakawa) is the idol of Spain. His engagement to actress Lola Castillo (Turner) leads to complications when another man brings her home from the theater. Lopez brands her with his cigarette and stabs her escort, Captain Alvarez (Payne). He then escapes into the mountains and becomes a leader of a band of brigands. Lola obtains a divorce and marries Captain Alvarez. Lopez, seeking revenge, sends his men to abduct Lola, but they bring her younger sister Maria (Ward) instead and Lopez rapes her. She returns to the town and dies a year later, leaving a baby which is exchanged by a nurse for a child of Lola's that dies at birth. Five years later, Lopez surrounds their home and takes Captain Alvarez and the child prisoner, and then orders them shot. He locks himself in a room with Lola. When the nurse confesses the truth of the child's paternity and the police are surrounding the villa, Lopez leaves and sacrifices himself by interjecting himself as the bandits are shooting at Alvarez and his son. ==Cast== *Sessue Hayakawa as Vasco Lopez *Florence Turner as Lola Castillo *Sidney Payne as Captain Alvarez *Evelyn Ward as Maria Castillo *Eugenie Besserer as Se\u00f1ora Castillo *Gertrude Norman as Marianna *Kitty Bradbury as Se\u00f1ora Lopez ==References== ==External links== * Category:1920 films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Haworth Pictures Corporation films Category:1920 drama films Category:Films directed by Joseph De Grasse Category:American drama films Category:Film Booking Offices of America films ",
