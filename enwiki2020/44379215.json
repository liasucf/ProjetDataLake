They were replaced by two teams that finished at the bottom of 2004 Belarusian Premier League table (Lokomotiv Vitebsk and Belshina Bobruisk). Two teams that finished at the bottom of 2004 season table (Vertikal Kalinkovichi and Dinamo- Juni Minsk) relegated to the Second League. They were replaced by two best teams of 2004 Second League (Smena Minsk and Orsha). Vedrich-97 Rechitsa were not able to fulfill Premier League licensing criteria and remained in the First League. Molodechno-2000 (who finished 13th last season) withdrew to the Second League due to insufficient financing. ==Teams and locations== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\" !width=120|Team !width=110|Location !data-sort-type=\"number\"|Position in 2004 |- |Lokomotiv |Vitebsk |Premier League, 15 |- |Belshina |Belshina |Premier League, 16 |- |Vedrich-97 |Rechitsa |2 |- |Smorgon |Smorgon |3 |- |Granit |Mikashevichi |4 |- |ZLiN |Gomel |5 |- |Veras |Nesvizh |6 |- |Baranovichi |Baranovichi |7 |- |Lida |Lida |8 |- |Khimik |Svetlogorsk |9 |- |Bereza |Bereza |10 |- |Kommunalnik |Slonim |11 |- |Torpedo-Kadino |Mogilev |12 |- |Dnepr-DUSSh-1 |Rogachev |14 |- |Smena |Minsk |Second League, 1 |- |Orsha |Orsha |Second League, 2 |} ==League table== ==Top goalscorers== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" !Rank !width=170|Goalscorer !width=170|Team !Goals |- !align=\"center\"|1 | Ruslan Usaw |Lokomotiv Vitebsk |align=\"center\"|32 |- !align=\"center\"|2 | Dzmitry Asipenka |Smorgon |align=\"center\"|17 |- !align=\"center\"|3 | Aleksandr Chuduk |Baranovichi |align=\"center\"|15 |- !align=\"center\"|4 | Vadim Sugako |Kommunalnik Slonim |align=\"center\"|13 |- !align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"|5 | Dmitry Gavrilovich |Khimik Svetlogorsk |align=\"center\"|12 |- | Sergey Vekhtev |Lokomotiv Vitebsk |align=\"center\"|12 |- | Oleksiy Kopylchenko |Belshina Bobruisk |align=\"center\"|12 |- | Andrey Chisty |Granit Mikashevichi |align=\"center\"|12 |} ==See also== *2005 Belarusian Premier League *2004\u201305 Belarusian Cup *2005\u201306 Belarusian Cup ==External links== *RSSSF Category:Belarusian First League seasons 2 Belarus Belarus ",
