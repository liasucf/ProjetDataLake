    "text": "Noah Frick (born 16 October 2001) is a Liechtensteiner footballer who plays as a forward for Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax, and the Liechtenstein national team. ==Club career== Frick signed for FC Vaduz in 2018 and spent two years at the club under manager and father Mario Frick. In total he made 45 appearances and scored four goals in the Swiss Challenge League over that time. During the 2019\u201320 season, Vaduz earned promotion to the Swiss Super League just days before the player's contract expired. Although he did not receive a new contract offer from the team, teams from the German 2. Bundesliga had reportedly expressed interest. On 24 September 2020 it was announced that Frick had signed a two-year contract with Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax of the Swiss Challenge League with a club option for an additional season. ==International career== Frick made his international debut for Liechtenstein on 23 March 2019, coming on as a substitute for Nicolas Hasler in the 86th minute of the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying home match against Greece, which finished as a 0\u20132 loss. In June 2019, Frick scored for Liechtenstein's U21s in their first-ever competitive victory as they beat Azerbaijan in 2021 UEFA Euro qualifying; ending a run of fifty-nine straight defeats. ==Personal life== Frick is the son of former professional footballer Mario Frick, who is the all-time top scorer for Liechtenstein and four-time Liechtensteiner Footballer of the Year. Mario is now a manager, currently the head coach of Noah's club Vaduz. Noah's older brother, Yanik, is also a Liechtenstein international footballer. ==Career statistics== ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !colspan=3|Liechtenstein |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2019||2||0 |- |2020||1||0 |- !Total!!3!!0 |} ==Honours== FC Vaduz *Liechtenstein Football Cup: 2018\u201319 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2001 births Category:Living people Category:People from Liestal Category:Liechtenstein footballers Category:Liechtenstein youth international footballers Category:Liechtenstein under-21 international footballers Category:Liechtenstein international footballers Category:Swiss people of Liechtenstein descent Category:Association football forwards Category:FC Vaduz players Category:Swiss Challenge League players ",
