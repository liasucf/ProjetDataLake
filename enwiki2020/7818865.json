    "text": "Edmond Malinvaud (25 April 1923 \u2013 7 March 2015) was a French economist. He was the first president of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. Trained at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique and at the \u00c9cole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration \u00c9conomique (ENSAE) in Paris, Malinvaud was a student of Maurice Allais. In 1950, Malinvaud left Allais to join the Cowles Commission in the United States. At Cowles, Malinvaud produced work in many directions. His famous article, \"Capital Accumulation and the Efficient Allocation of Resources\" (1953), provided an intertemporal theory of capital for general equilibrium theory and introduced the concept of dynamic efficiency. He became director of the ENSAE (1962\u20131966), director of the forecast department of French Treasury (1972\u20131974), director of the INSEE (1974\u20131987) and Professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France (1988\u20131993). He also worked on uncertainty theory, notably the theory of \"first order certainty equivalence\" (1969) and the relationship between individual risks and social risks (1972, 1973). His 1971 microeconomics textbook and his econometrics textbook, Statistical Methods in Econometrics, have since become classics. Malinvaud's main contribution to macroeconomics is represented in his slim 1977 book, Theory of Unemployment Reconsidered which provided a clear and unified reconstruction of dynamic \"disequilibrium\" macroeconomics; this theory built on previous results of Clower, Leijonhufvud, and \"Non-Walrasian\" theory. Malinvaud's influence on the subsequent generation of European economists has been profound. == Major works of Edmond Malinvaud == * \"Note on von Neumann-Morgenstern's Strong Independence Axiom\", 1952, Econometrica. * \"Capital Accumulation and the Efficient Allocation of Resources\", 1953, Econometrica * \"Aggregation Problems in Input-Output Models\", 1954, in Barna, editor, Structural Interdependence of the Economy * \"Initiation \u00e0 la comptabilit\u00e9 nationale\", 1957 * \"Statistical Methods in Econometrics\", 1964 * \"Croissances optimales dans un mod\u00e8le macro\u00e9conomique\", 1965, PASSV. * \"Les Croissances optimales\", 1965, Cahiers du s\u00e9minaire d'\u00e9conom\u00e9trie. * \"Decentralized Procedures for Planning\", 1967, in Malinvaud and Bacharach, editors, Activity Analysis of Growth and Planning * \"D\u00e9cisions en face de l'al\u00e9atoire et situation certaine approximativement \u00e9quivalente\", 1969, Cahiers du s\u00e9minaire de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9conometrie * \"First Order Certainty Equivalence\", 1969, Econometrica * \"Proc\u00e9dures pour la d\u00e9termination d'un programme de consommation collective\", 1971, European ER. * \"A Planning Approach to the Public Goods Problem\", 1971, Swedish JE. * \"Lectures on Microeconomic Theory\", 1972. * \"The Allocation of Individual Risks in Large Markets\", 1972, JET * \"Prices for Individual Consumption, Quantity Indicators for Collective Consumption\", 1972, RES * \"La croissance fran\u00e7aise\", with J.-J.
