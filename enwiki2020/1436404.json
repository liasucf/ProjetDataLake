    "text": "25924 Douglasadams, provisional designation , is a Nysian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 2.4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 19 February 2001, by astronomers of the Lincoln Near- Earth Asteroid Research at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site in New Mexico, United States. The asteroid was named for novelist Douglas Adams. == Orbit and classification == Douglasadams is a member of the Nysa family (), better described as the Nysa\u2013Polana complex, as it contains at least three asteroid families with distinct spectral types (SFC). It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0\u20132.8 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,371 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 2\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by Spacewatch at Kitt Peak Observatory in January 1997, more than four years prior to its official discovery observation at Lincoln Lab's ETS. == Physical characteristics == The spectral type of Douglasadams is unknown. Based on its albedo (see below) it is likely a common stony S-type asteroid. === Diameter and albedo === According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Douglasadams measures 2.410 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.210. It has an absolute magnitude of 15.6. === Rotation period === As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of Douglasadams has been obtained from photometric observations. The asteroid's rotation period, poles and shape remain unknown. == Naming == This minor planet was named in memory of English novelist Douglas Adams (1952\u20132001), because its provisional designation happened to contain the year of his death, his initials, and the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything (42), as given in his novel serial The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 25 January 2005 (). The asteroid 18610 Arthurdent, discovered by Felix Hormuth in 1998, was named after the bewildered hero of Douglas Adams's The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. == References == == External links == * Asteroid named after \u2018Hitchhiker\u2019 humorist: Late British sci-fi author honored after cosmic campaign by Alan Boyle, MSNBC, 2005 * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (25001)-(30000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 025924 025924 Category:Minor planets named for people Category:Named minor planets 25924 Douglasadams 20010219 ",
