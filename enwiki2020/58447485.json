Sin. 4: 211 A. undulatus has been isolated in China and Germany. In 2016, the genome of A. undulatus was sequenced as a part of the Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project - a project dedicated to performing whole-genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Aspund1_1/Aspund1_1.home.html The genome assembly size was 32.11 Mbp. ==Growth and morphology== Aspergillus undulatus has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid\u00ae (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below.
