    "text": "The statue of John Deighton, also known as \"Gassy Jack\", is installed in Vancouver's Gastown neighborhood, in British Columbia, Canada. It stands at the intersection of Carrall and Water streets. ==History== On June 16, 2020, the statue was splattered with red paint amidst growing calls to remove statues honoring colonialist or racist individuals. Activists cited Deighton's marriage to a 12 year old Squamish girl named Quahail-ya as the reason for its removal. A petition calling for its removal garnered over 1,500 signatures. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Monuments and memorials in Vancouver Category:Outdoor sculptures in Vancouver Category:Sculptures of men in Canada Category:Statues in Canada ",
