FBW (Deutsche Film- und Medienbewertung), a German federal authority for evaluating and rating film and media, rated the film with the certification mark Wertvoll (valuable) for its high artistic quality. In his works, Nurbek Egen repeatedly turns to his native culture and traditions. Modern social and political life of Kyrgyzstan, as well as its background and cultural past, are reflected in his documentary film The Birth of Manas as a Presentiment.
