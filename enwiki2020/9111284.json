With Botev he played 112 games and scored 12 goals. In 2006, Cherno More Varna signed Andonov to a four-year deal for a \u20ac100,000. During a 2008\u201309 season, after a few poor performances along with the impressive form of Miroslav Manolov and Yordan Yurukov, Andonov found regular starting positions in attack hard to find. In January 2009, he was loaned in his previously club Botev to the end of the season. On 3 July 2009, Andonov signed a contract with Beroe Stara Zagora. In May 2010 Andonov signed a two-year deal with Chernomorets Burgas. In February 2012, Andonov was released from his contract and returned to Beroe Stara Zagora as a free agent. He scored a hat- trick in the opening game of the 2012\u201313 season against Botev Vratsa on 11 August. On 15 May 2013, Andonov led Beroe out as captain in the 2013 Bulgarian Cup Final, which they won 6\u20134 after penalties against Levski Sofia, as Andonov collected his second Bulgarian Cup winner's medal. On 12 June 2018, Andonov signed with Second League club Arda. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Beroe Stara Zagora *Bulgarian Cup (2): 2009\u201310, 2012\u201313 *Bulgarian Supercup (1): 2013 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Bulgarian footballers Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Plovdiv Category:Association football forwards Category:First Professional Football League (Bulgaria) players Category:Second Professional Football League (Bulgaria) players Category:TFF First League players Category:PFC Botev Plovdiv players Category:PFC Cherno More Varna players Category:PFC Beroe Stara Zagora players Category:PFC Chernomorets Burgas players Category:Denizlispor footballers Category:FC Vereya players Category:FC Arda Kardzhali players Category:FC Tsarsko Selo players Category:FC Hebar Pazardzhik players Category:FC Levski Karlovo players Category:Bulgarian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Turkey Category:Bulgarian expatriate sportspeople in Turkey ",
