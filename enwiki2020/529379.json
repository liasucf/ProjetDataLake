Such research activities are broad in nature as well as scope, including basic research on models and languages that underpins activities on algorithms, technologies and architectures. Challenging applications motivate and validate this research, in particular the Semantic Web and e-Science. Examples of recent research include Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Utopia Documents, myGrid, Taverna workbench, myExperiment, Open PHACTS. Academic staff in group include Professor Carole Goble CBE, Professor Norman Paton, Professor Ulrike Sattler, Professor Robert Stevens, Sean Bechhofer, Suzanne Embury, Alvaro A. A. Fernandes, Simon Harper, Bijan Parsia, Rizos Sakelloirou, Sandra Sampaio and Ning Zhang. ===Machine Learning and Optimisation=== The Machine learning and Optimisation (MLO) group conduct world-leading research into a wide range of techniques and applications of machine learning, optimization, data mining, probabilistic modelling, pattern recognition and machine perception. Academic staff include Jon Shapiro (group leader), Gavin Brown, Ke Chen, Richard Neville and Xiaojun Zeng. ===Nano Engineering and Storage Technologies=== The Nano Engineering and Storage Technologies (NEST) group has research interests in nano fabrication for data storage and advanced sensors applications and the investigation of data storage systems in general. The NEST group is housed in an integrated suite of staff offices, general-purpose laboratory space and class 100/1000 cleanrooms and is a founder member of the Manchester Centre for Mesoscience and Nanotechnology where the ground-breaking, Nobel Prize\u2013winning work on Graphene by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov was undertaken. The group is led by Professor Thomas Thomson, academic staff members include Professor Jim Miles, Ernie W Hill, Milan Mihajlovic and Paul W. Nutter. ===Software Systems=== The Software Systems group is concerned with the design, modelling, simulation and construction of mission-critical systems that challenge the states-of-the-art in both software engineering and performance engineering. Such systems are fundamentally composed of physically distributed component sub-systems, and are characterised by large data spaces and high compute needs, with associated complex interactions between the components. The group is led by Professor John Gurd,http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/John.r.gurd/ Professor John R.

The Computer Group was established following Freddie Williams's move to the Electrical Engineering Department in 1946. At its formation in 1964, the Department of Computer Science was the first such department in the United Kingdom, with Professor Tom Kilburn serving as Head of Department until 1980. On 1 May 2001, following the death of Kilburn the same year, the Computer Building was renamed Kilburn Building in his honour. The School of Computer Science was formed from the Department when the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST merged to form the University of Manchester in 2004. It changed back from a school to a department in 2019. The Group/School/Department is notable for the following achievements: * The world's first electronic stored-program digital computer (the Manchester Baby) * Virtual memory using paging (see Atlas Computer) * Manchester encoding * The AMULET microprocessor series (asynchronous implementations of the ARM computer architecture) See also the History of the school.http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/history/ History of the School of Computer Science The following alumni have been staff in the School ===Alumni and Emeritus=== The school and department has several notable alumni and Emeritus staff including: * Jim Miles (retired) * Allan M. Ramsay (retired) * Ian Horrocks, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford * Hilary Kahn, a professor in the computer science department * Tom Kilburn, first head of the Department of Computer Science * Joshua Knowles, Professor at the University of Birmingham * Pedro Mendes, Professor at the University of Connecticut Health Center * , Professor of Computational and Systems Biology in the Faculty of Life Sciences * Alan Turing was a Reader in the Mathematics Department and was deputy director of the computing laboratory. * Professor Brian Warboys * David Bree, Emeritus Professor of Artificial Intelligence * Freddie Williams * Simon Lavington * Geoff Tootill * Nandini Mukherjee * Ross D. King, creator of Robot Scientist ==References== Manchester Computer Science ",
