During World War II, she was given the designation USS YP-397. ==History== She was laid down at the Albina Motor Works in Portland, Oregon and launched on 1 July 1929. She had two masts each capped with a 375mm electric lens lantern (15,000 cp) and a 4-way air diaphone fog horn. During World War II, she was reassigned to the Alaskan Sea Frontier to serve as an examination vessel. Designated as a Yard Patrol Craft YP-397, she was painted grey and armaments added: a 4\"/50 caliber gun forward, two .50 caliber machine guns on either side of the bridge, one .30 caliber machine gun aft, and a Y gun with 17 depth charges. She was assigned to the Icy Strait at the northern entrance to the Inside Passage between Cape Spencer on the Alaskan mainland to the north and Indian Head Light, on Chichagof Island to the south. She remained on station continuously sending a launch for provisions at nearby ports. In addition to confirming the identity of all ships trying to enter the Inside Passage, she assisted in assembling convoys that were en route to further points in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. After the war, she returned to her post at Swiftsure Bank. On 1 October 1968, she was decommissioned and donated to the Sea Scouts. In 1982, she sunk at Willamette Harbor but was later raised and repaired to serve as a floating restaurant in Newport, Oregon. She was sold in 1988 and while being towed to Ketchikan, Alaska sunk in 590 feet of water on 16 June 1988. ===Assignments=== *1930\u20131942 Swiftsure Bank (Washington) *1942\u20131945 Examination vessel *1945\u20131961 Swiftsure Bank *1961 Umatilla Reef (Washington) *1961\u20131968 Relief (Washington) ==References== Category:Lightships of the United States Category:Ships of the United States Lighthouse Service Category:1929 ships Category:Ships of the United States Coast Guard Category:Yard patrol boats of the United States Navy Category:Ships of the Aleutian Islands campaign ",
