She has Spotify listeners from across the United States, and has received accolades from Billboard, Seventeen Magazine, J-14, Twist, and Teen Vogue.Houghton claims her success as an independent artist to be because of \"Team Tiff,\" her army of loyal fans turned into friends both in and out of the music industry. ==Early life== Houghton was born on December 6, 1993 in Dallas, TX to parents Steve and Jennifer Houghton. She has always loved to sing, her parents saying that she was singing before she could talk. As a child and young teenager, Houghton gained a background in Broadway, even achieving the role of alternate for Annie in the show of the same name. She was further inspired by Kristen Chenoweth, whom she met when Chenoweth visited her school. Houghton notes Shania Twain as one of her main sources of inspiration, saying, \"she was my first exposure to the fire I have inside myself to be a force in the world, through my music\". At seventeen, she moved to Nashville to further her career in music. ==Career== === 2013-2014: YouTube, \"High\", and This is Not an EP === Houghton started posting YouTube videos in 2013, singing covers of songs by artists such as Fall Out Boy, P!NK, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, and more. On August 13, 2013, she released her debut single, \"High\", along with a \u201850s-themed music video for the song that has received more than one million views on YouTube. She released the single and video for \"Phone Call\" on December 10, 2013, and for \"17 Again\" on March 17, 2014. The acoustic version of her song, \"Love Like That\", as well as its video, was released on Valentine\u2019s Day 2014. The non-acoustic version was later released on September 11, 2014 and was later played on Sirius XM. Taylor Swift introduced the song upon its first airplay on the station. Houghton released her single, \"The Best\" on August 5, 2014. She then released these singles, as well as \"Island\" as a collection in This is Not an EP on December 1, 2014. The following day, she released her first holiday single \"Blame It on the Snow\", with the video released on December 3, 2014. During the summer of 2014, Houghton went on tour across the United States in support of pop duo MKTO. === 2015-2016: \"Catch Me If You Can\" and \"I'm Gonna Love You\" === Houghton spent 2015 and early 2016 writing and recording new music to truly find her sound. She released her single, \"Catch Me if You Can\" on July 21, 2016, with the video coming on July 23. She later released its accompanying EP for her fans on January 24, 2019. The song reached number one on Radio Disney's most requested chart and received airplay nationwide across the United States. Houghton said of the song, \"Originally I was writing the lyrics with the intention of keeping the focus on me catching him, but by the time I got to the second verse I was OVER IT. This guy should be chasing ME! So, from there on out, now and forever, I\u2019m the catch\". On October 13, 2016, she released the single and video \"I\u2019m Gonna Love You\". She released her second holiday single, \"Hey Sailor!\", on December 2, 2016. === 2017: Call Her Crystal === After parting ways with her longtime manager, producers, and ending a serious relationship, Houghton moved from Los Angeles back to the Dallas area to be back with her family. She changed her social media usernames to @callhercrystal, posting content to the platforms under the name Crystal. She hinted at new music under this new name, but it was never released. In 2019, she talked to US Weekly about this period as Crystal, saying, \"Two years ago, I thought I needed to change my name and rewrite my story. As my fans listen to this album, they will learn the story of my comeback and why I am now in a place to take back my name and share my music again\". === 2018-present: \"Pretty Pretty\" and \"Get to Lovin\" === On November 12, 2018, Houghton released a single called \"Pretty Pretty\" once again under the name Tiffany Houghton. She spoke to Us Weekly about the single, saying, \"\u2019Pretty Pretty\u2019 is a shout out to all my girls that are pursuing their dreams, going to school, developing their talents, and growing into their best selves. And it\u2019s for the guys who recognize the value of those girls\". She followed up this single with another, called \"Physical\", on November 19, 2018. \"Break Me\" was released shortly after on January 18, 2019. Throughout 2019, Houghton has hinted at an upcoming tour and album, saying, \"Another neat thing about this song, and the whole upcoming album, is that it was written and produced entirely by women\". Houghton announced her latest single, \"Get to Lovin\" featuring up-and-coming rapper Lay Lay, which is to be released on June 28, 2019. Cardi B has been quoted as saying that Lay Lay is \"the future\". == Artistry == Houghton was formerly known to take a retro approach to music, styling music videos and cover artwork with nods to the \u201850s. Her single \u201cLove Like That\u201d is about old- fashioned romance, and a lot of her personal fashion included many classic trends. In 2014, she said that she preferred to release singles over albums so that each song got its own focus and vision but didn\u2019t rule out releasing an album in the future. Houghton is an advocate for women and wants her music to inspire women to use their voices and talents to better the world. She says, \u201cWe need to recognize that we can sit at the table, show up, and that we have something to offer\u201d. Houghton is committed to making a difference with her music, writing songs with many empowering and relatable themes. She says, \u201cIf my music can help even one person feel like they are not alone, it will have done its job\u201d. She also noted that her upcoming music has sheer vulnerability in it, and she opens up more than ever before because she wrote it without the original intention of it being released. == Other Ventures == On June 10, 2019, Houghton launched The Tiffany Houghton Singing Academy, a set of online courses in which she gives singing instruction. This original launch offered three lessons: Lesson 1: The FUNdamentals, Lesson 2: Get Toned, and Lesson 3: Increasing Your Range. Houghton says that a lot of her followers also have an interest in music and singing, and that she wanted to present what she has learned over the course of her career in order to help others improve their own craft. Houghton launched her own label, Instar LLC, under which she will be releasing new music in 2019. == Personal life == Houghton has four siblings: Steven, \u201cTiny\u201d Tanner, Sam, and McKenna. She got engaged to Adam Moffitt on December 17, 2018, and they were married on March 23, 2019. She wrote and performed an original song, \u201cGood People\u201d, for her wedding that she later released as a video on Instagram. == Discography == * This is Not an EP (2014) * Catch Me If You Can (2019) == Tours == * MKTO American Dream Tour (2014) == References == == External links == * \" High\" music video * \"Phone Call\" music video * \"Love Like That\" music video * \"17 Again\" music video * \"Blame It On the Snow\" music video * \"Catch Me If You Can\" music video * \"I'm Gonna Love You\" music video * Tiffany's cover of \"ME!\" by Taylor Swift ft.
