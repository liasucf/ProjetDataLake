    "text": "Porky's Badtime Story is a 1937 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Robert Clampett. The short was released on July 24, 1937, and stars Porky Pig and Gabby Goat. The short was later remade in 1944 as Tick Tock Tuckered, with Daffy Duck taking Gabby's role. ==Plot== When Porky Pig and Gabby Goat realize that they overslept to 10:00 after their alarm goes off at 06:00, they end up rushing to work at Peter Piper Pickled Peppers and sneaking in. When clocking in, Gabby tries to pull the lever, but ends up struggling and the clock goes crazy. Their boss catches them and states that if they weren't going to make it, he would've sent their work to them. The boss warns them that if they are late one more time, they are fired. The boss then orders them to get to work. At 08:00 that night, Porky sets the alarm clock as Gabby complains about having to go to bed early. Porky reminds Gabby that if they are late again, they will be fired. Porky climbs into bed, and they both fall asleep until a bunch of cats next door wake them up; and later a fly bugs them, literally. Later that night, the moon comes out and its light wakes up Porky. One of Porky's attempts to close the window ends up wrecking his bed. As the night progresses, a thunderstorm occurs while Porky is sleeping in Gabby's bed. A leak in the roof disturbs Gabby, who then opens an umbrella in the house with Porky telling him that it's bad luck. Gabby ignores Porky's statement until lightning destroys the umbrella. When Gabby quips that he should try sleeping under Niagara Falls, a lot of water comes through the roof and down on them. The next morning, Porky and Gabby are shown sleeping in the drawers when the alarm clock goes off at 06:00. They get themselves ready and drive off to work. When Porky and Gabby arrive at Peter Piper Pickled Peppers, they see a sign on the door that says \"Closed Sunday.\" Porky and Gabby drive home, and when they climb back into the drawers to sleep, the alarm clock goes off again at 06:15 and Porky hits it with a mallet, leaving the clock dazed. == Legacy == Bob Clampett later directed a remake of the short in 1944 as Tick Tock Tuckered, with Daffy Duck taking Gabby's role. ==References== ==External links== * * Porky's Badtime Story (Colorized) on the Internet Archive Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:American films Category:1937 films Category:1937 animated films Category:Films directed by Bob Clampett Category:1930s American animated films Category:Films featuring Porky Pig Category:American black-and-white films ",
