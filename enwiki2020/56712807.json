The deficit is projected to be $18.1 billion, including a $3 billion adjustment for risk.

The federal debt was $685.5 billion and debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio was 30.9 per cent which is a decrease from 31.3 per cent in 2018. Public debt charges that had reached a peak of about \"30 percent in the mid-1990s\" were down to \"6.7 per cent of expenses in 2018\u201319.\" The report said there was strong growth in most regions of the world in 2016 and 2017 and that global economic expansion was more moderate in 2018.
