Forever firm in her principles, her name became a synonym of tenacity, Eritrea, the pride of the oppressed, is a testament that truth prevails. Eritrea, Eritrea, has taken her rightful place in the world. [So that] The supreme dedication that brought us freedom, will serve to rebuild her and develop her, We shall honor her with progress, It is our legacy to crown her. Eritrea, Eritrea, has taken her rightful place in the world. |} ==External links== *Eritrea: Ertra, Ertra, Ertra - Audio of the national anthem of Eritrea, with information and lyrics * Category:African anthems Category:Eritrean music Category:National symbols of Eritrea Category:1951 songs Category:National anthem compositions in F major ",
