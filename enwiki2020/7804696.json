Kennedy, then the only high school in Willingboro, located just down the road on Kennedy Way. For a short time, residents were having a difficult time in deciding what to call the new Willingboro high school; some sought to name the new high school \"J.F. Kennedy High School \u2013 East\" while others debated on naming the school, \"Robert F. Kennedy\" after President Kennedy's brother, the former US Attorney General during his administration, Robert. A vote was taken and it was decided that the only appropriate name would be what the school is called today, \"Willingboro High School.\" The school colors are navy blue, scarlet and white \u2013 which are the slight opposite of the school's former sister school, J.F.K. (which were scarlet, navy and white). The mascot is the \"Chimera\", a mythological monster with the head of a lion and body of a goat and the tail of a serpent, opposite of the former sister school, which was a \"Gryphon, which had the head of an eagle and the body of a lion.\" The two schools were merged at the start of the 1989\u201390 school year, with all students attending what is now Willingboro High School.Quinn, Laura. \"Willingboro Girds For School Merger\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, August 28, 1989.
