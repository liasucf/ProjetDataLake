The missionary was formally invited by Fr. Michael Donoher, the former parish priest of Silang, Cavite. Fr. Michael believed that education is a good way of spreading the words of the Lord. When the people of Silang requested to the priest that they wanted to have a high school in their municipality after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines Fr. Michael convinced the nuns to run the first Catholic school in Silang. When the orphanage of the Infant Jesus in Tondo was destroyed, the orphanage transferred to Silang, Cavite by the invitation of the Parish Priest. With 100 orphans and five nuns they stayed at the old convent of Silang. The nuns were Mother Donatiana, Mother Leonce, Mother Adeltrude, Mother Estelle and Mother Damascene. The opening of the Infant Jesus Academy with first and second year high school was opened for both male and female students. In 1956, a building was constructed with four classrooms. It was followed by the second, third, and fourth buildings until it reached 34 classrooms, 3 counselling rooms, 2 laboratory rooms, 3 offices, a clinic, a faculty room, a chapel, 2 canteen and a library In the years 2005 to 2007, 2 fully air conditioned computer rooms were built, the so-called \u201clittle baguio\u201d was transformed into a huge gymnasium that is being used for school activities and sports. During its 60th founding anniversary the ICM Sisters transferred the administration and the management to the Diocese of Imus.
