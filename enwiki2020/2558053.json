    "text": "China Railways class ND5 The GE C36-7 is a 6-axle road switcher diesel- electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems, GE do Brazil and A Goninan & Co between 1978 and 1989. It is an updated GE U36C with a 16-cylinder FDL engine. It is externally similar to the GE C30-7 but has larger air intakes under the radiators. The dynamic brakes grids of later units are located in a high box behind the cab. 599 examples of this locomotive were built, 422 of which were exported to the People's Republic of China, where it is designated as the ND5. GE do Brazil built 15 C36-7s for Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M\u00e9xico, numbers 9327\u20139341. The three Hamersley Iron units built by A Goninan & Co were exported to the United States in the late 1990s after being withdrawn from service in Australia and were later sold to various railway companies. In 2003, 58 former Missouri Pacific units acquired by Union Pacific were exported to Estonia for Eesti Raudtee, alongside 19 C30-7s from Norfolk Southern and CSX. ==Original owners== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! bgcolor=c0c090 | Railroad ! bgcolor=c0c090 | Quantity ! bgcolor=c0c090 | Road numbers ! bgcolor=c0c090 | Notes |- |China Railway |422 |ND5.0001\u2013ND5.0422 | |- |Conrail |25 |6620\u20136644 |To CSX and Norfolk Southern. |- |Ferrocarril del Pac\u00edfico |15 |419\u2013433 |To N de M. |- |General Electric (testbed) |1 |505 | |- |Hamersley Iron |3 |5057\u20135059 | |- |Missouri Pacific Railroad |60 |9000\u20139059 |To Union Pacific. |- |Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M\u00e9xico |25 |9317\u20139341 | |- |Norfolk and Western Railway |31 |8500\u20138530 |To Norfolk Southern. |- |Norfolk Southern Railway |12 |8531\u20138542 | |- |OCTRA (Trans-Gabon Railway) |8 |CC301\u2013CC308 | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:C-C locomotives Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of China Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of the United States Category:Diesel locomotives of Western Australia Category:Freight locomotives C36-7 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1978 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Mexico Category:Standard gauge locomotives of China Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Australia Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Mexico Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Australia ",
