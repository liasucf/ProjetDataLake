They moved to Milwaukee when John was 11 years old. At age 12, he began to work for Henry Miller, a confectioner. In 1861, he enlisted in the Union Army during the American Civil War, but returned to Milwaukee three months later due to ill health. In 1874, he purchased James Curry's Confectioner and Ice Cream Business. Making ice cream is what brought his fame. He is known for being the first person to sell \"bricks\" of ice cream that could be taken home. He also innovated new flavors of ice cream. His company developed new machinery that would allow fruits and nuts to be consistent throughout the ice cream rather than settling at the bottom. President Grover Cleveland served Luick Ice Cream at a White House State Dinner. Luick retired in 1903, leaving his business to his son. He died in 1938 and was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Milwaukee. == See also == The Chudnow Museum of Yesteryear houses history and artifacts of Luick and his company, including an ice cream shop and soda counter. == References == Category:1840 births Category:1938 deaths Category:People from Niagara Falls, New York Category:People of Wisconsin in the American Civil War Category:Businesspeople from Milwaukee Category:Union Army soldiers ",
