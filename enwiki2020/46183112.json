He was educated at Eton and, after National Service with the 1st The Royal Dragoons, read PPE at New College, Oxford, graduating in 1954. The surname Money came from his paternal ancestor, the Rev James Money, who had married Clara Burdett, a granddaughter of Thomas Coutts. The hyphenated Money-Coutts was adopted by James and Clara\u2019s descendants, and in 1912 the ancient barony of Latymer was revived in favour of David\u2019s great-grandfather, Francis Money-Coutts. As a personal banker to the royal family, he was appointed KCVO in 1991. Other directorships included chairmanship of the investment group M&G;, deputy chairmanship of the discount house Gerrard & National and a directorship of Phoenix Assurance, Dun & Bradstreet, the credit reference agency and NatWest (from 1976 to 1990).
