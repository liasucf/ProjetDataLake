    "text": "The Garuda Party () is a political party in Indonesia that contested the 2019 general election. The party has been linked to the family of former president Suharto. Officials have denied the party is linked to the Suharto family or to former general Prabowo Subianto's Gerindra Party. Garuda declared itself to be neutral in the April 2019 presidential election, although some of its officials and legislative candidates voiced support for Prabowo. ==Background== In 2007, former information minister Harmoko, also a former chairman of Golkar, founded the National People\u2019s Party (PKN), which failed to qualify for the 2009 general election. In April 2015, PKN was renamed the Change Indonesia Movement Party (Garuda). The party\u2019s constitution, bylaws, symbol and senior figures were all changed, making it unrecognizable from PKN. Garuda Party was registered with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights on 16 April 2015. The party espouses a nationalist platform. Little was known of the party's leaders or policies prior to its registration for the 2019 election being accepted by the General Elections Commission (KPU) in October 2017. Party chairman Ahmad Ridha Sabana has said Garuda Party is a party of young people who want to contribute to national development. According to KPU data, Garuda Party has 693,191 members across 509 of Indonesia's 514 regencies, and 36.36% of its members are women. ==Key personnel== * Chairman: Ahmad Ridha Sabana. * Secretary General: Abdullah Mansuri. He is chairman of the Indonesian Market Traders Association (IKAPPI). He is the subject of several articles on cendananews.com, a news portal that reports on the activities of Suharto's children. ==Election results== ===Legislative election results=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

He said Garuda is independent and was \u201cbuilt by youths\u201d. He admitted to working for Tutut in the past but said he was no longer president director of her TPI television network. He also denied his party was connected to Gerindra Party, although he acknowledged he had in 2014 stood as a Gerindra candidate for the Jakarta provincial legislative assembly. He also admitted his brother Ahmad Riza Patria was a Gerindra politician. Ridha denied Garuda Party\u2019s name and mythical garuda bird emblem were deliberately similar to Gerindra\u2019s name and garuda bird logo. He also rejected claims that Garuda Party\u2019s bird design resembles the Nazi party's eagle emblem. ==References== Category:Political parties established in 2015 ",
