    "text": "The Pope County Courthouse is the courthouse and government center of Pope County, Minnesota, United States, in the city of Glenwood. It was built in 1930 as a replacement for a prior courthouse on the same site dating to 1879. The current courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for having local significance in politics/government and architecture. Its historic significance derives from being the long-serving seat of Pope County government and for being a well-preserved example of the replacement courthouses built in a few Minnesota counties in the 1930s. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Pope County, Minnesota ==References== ==External links== * Pope County, Minnesota Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Minnesota Category:Buildings and structures in Pope County, Minnesota Category:County courthouses in Minnesota Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Government buildings completed in 1930 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pope County, Minnesota ",
