    "text": "Colonel Jeptha Atherton (1733\u20131787) was a North Carolina landowner, politician and American Revolutionary War soldier in Northampton County, North Carolina. He served in the military throughout the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383). ==Profession== Jeptha Atherton was born ante 1735, probably in Bermuda. Atherton settled in Northampton Courthouse , Northampton County, Province of North Carolina in 1762, near what is now the courthouse square in Jackson. He allowed the use of his land (which he had purchased from Barnaby Thomas, a brother in law of Willie Jones) for county court meetings, while establishing a large plantation, including horse breeding and stables, a grist mill, a tavern, and a store. He became a prominent local farmer, politician, and later, the Northampton Regiments\u2019 first Major during the Revolutionary War period. By the time of the First Census of the Unites States, Atherton held a total of 35 slaves. This was a considerable number in the Upper South, where men were classified as planters if they held 20 or more slaves. His last will and testament makes a big emphasis on the redistribution of his slaves amongst his descendants following his death. ===Horse breeder=== Atherton was one of the first residents of Northampton County to take a strong interest in blooded horses. He established a large plantation at Northampton Courthouse, where he bred and raced horses, and was the owner of a nationally famous British born stallion, Janus, who was a grandson of the Godolphin Arabian. He purchased Janus from Mildred Willis between late 1771 and the start of 1772. Janus was quick and compact and is acknowledged as the foundation sire of the American Quarter Horse. He was a chestnut horse born in England in 1746 and imported to Virginia Colony by Mordecai Booth in 1752 , and resold, before moving to North Carolina. Janus, who measured in excess of 14 hands , would have looked different to the other horses at the time; compact yet large boned. His muscular back legs helped him run fast., Atherton enthusiasm for horse racing was shared by many of his neighbors. He ran Mud Colt and Big Filly (bred by Turner Bynum, his son-in-law), in quarter races against Willie Jones (statesman) two horses, Paoli and Trick\u2019em, losing to both. He bred Caelus and Harlot, later owned by his son-in-law James Barnes. On March 18, 1773, Atherton placed an advertisement in the Virginia Gazette; in it he refers to Janus being in North Carolina.. The horse, Celer, foaled in 1774 was considered to be his \u201cbest son\u201d. On March 20, 1775, Atherton placed one of many advertisements in the Virginia Gazette to put Janus out to stud. Atherton retained ownership of Janus until the horses death in 1780, aged 34, having passed his many qualities to all his foals, including the celebrated American Quarter Running Horse Spadille. On March 26th, 1782 Thomas Burke (North Carolina politician) wrote to him advising that the horse he dispatched was unfit for Military service and requested another. ==Chronology of his efforts during the Revolutionary War== Jeptha Atherton received his Commission as Major of the Northampton Regiment from Governor William Tryon on December 6, 1770 in New Bern.
