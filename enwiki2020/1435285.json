Incorporated by Fiat Group and Finmeccanica each holding 50% of the stock and renamed CESPRE, it worked mostly for ITAF in 1953-56 to build an air-to-air missile, the C-7. In 1960 CESPRE devised and built a solid-fuel rocket for meteorological purposes, the C-41, on a 14 million liras budget. C-41 was launched in 1961 reaching an altitude of 30,000 mt. That same year SISPRE was incorporated, together with the Italian BPD, in the Societ\u00e0 Generale Missilistica. ==Sources== * ==External links== *SISPRE Rockets Category:Sounding rockets Category:Companies of Italy ",
