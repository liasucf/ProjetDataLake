    "text": "Adobe Spark is an integrated suite of media creation applications for mobile and web developed by Adobe Systems. It comprises three separate design apps: Spark Page, Spark Post, and Spark Video. == Description == The service is a part of Creative Cloud. The content automatically saves on the cloud. The free Adobe Spark web app syncs with Spark Page, Spark Post and Spark Video iOS mobile apps, allowing users to create, edit and share their visual story from any device. The three design apps allow users to create and design visual content that can be used for businesses, education, social media, etc. Users may import/search pictures using any of the three applications, with only images tagged with the Creative Commons license being available with the search tool. == History == In May 2014, Adobe launched Adobe Voice, a new animated video app for iPad used to create video \"stories\". Adobe Voice would later become what is now known as Adobe Spark Video. In April 2015, Adobe launched Adobe Slate, which was a text and photo-centric storytelling app for the iPad. Adobe Slate would later become what is now known as Adobe Spark Page. The idea for it came in 2014, under the codename Project Luca. In October 2015, Adobe launched Adobe Slate on the web. Now, Adobe Slate projects will sync automatically between the web and iPad versions using Adobe Creative Cloud. In December 2015, Adobe launched Adobe Post as a new social graphics app for the iPhone and iPad. Adobe Post would later become what is now known as Adobe Spark Post. In January 2016, Adobe launched Adobe Voice 2.0 with full iPhone support for the first time. The app allows users to sync projects using your Adobe account, which lets you create projects on one device and finish them on another. In May 2016, Adobe launched Adobe Spark, a web tool that integrates Adobe Post, Adobe Slate, and Adobe Voice together into one unified design platform. With the change, each of the three previous iOS apps were renamed; Adobe Post became Adobe Spark Post, Adobe Slate became Adobe Spark Page, and Adobe Voice became Adobe Spark Video. == References == Category:Adobe software Category:IOS software Category:Mobile applications ",
