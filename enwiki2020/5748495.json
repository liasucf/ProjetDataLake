    "text": "Young model is a radio propagation model that was built on the data collected on New York City. It typically models the behaviour of cellular communication systems in large cities. ==Applicable to/under conditions== This model is ideal for modeling the behaviour of cellular communications in large cities with tall structures. ==Coverage== Frequency: 150 MHz to 3700 MHz ==History== Young model was built on the data of 1952 in New York City. ==Mathematical formulation== The mathematical formulation for Young model is: L \\; = \\; G_B \\; G_M \\; \\left (\\frac{h_B \\; h_M}{d^2} \\right )^2\\beta Where, :L = path loss. Unit: decibel (dB) :GB = gain of base transmitter. Unit: decibel (dB) :GM = gain of mobile transmitter. Unit: decibel (dB) :hB = height of base station antenna. Unit: meter (m) :hM = height of mobile station antenna. Unit: meter (m) :d = link distance. Unit: kilometer (km) :\\beta = clutter factor ==See also== *Hata model for urban areas *Hata model for suburban areas *Hata model for open areas *Log-distance path loss model Category:Radio frequency propagation ",
