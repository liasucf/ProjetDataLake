    "text": "Musicology is the twenty-eighth studio album by American recording artist Prince. The album was given to concertgoers at his Musicology Tour, from March 27 to September 9, 2004, in North America. A digital release followed two days after his tour started on March 29, 2004. The physical retail version was released on April 19, 2004 (Europe) and April 20, 2004 (US) by NPG Records and distributed by Columbia Records. Musicology was the first album in five years (ten as Prince) that Prince released through a major label (Sony Music) and, being partially recorded in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, was his first to be recorded outside Minneapolis in many years. Musicology is R&B; themed. Receiving generally positive reviews from music critics, Musicology proved to be Prince's most successful record in years, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200 and reaching top 10 in ten other countries. Prince won Grammy Awards for Best Traditional R&B; Vocal Performance for \"Musicology\" and Best Male R&B; Vocal Performance for \"Call My Name\". By January 2005, Musicology was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the time of release, Prince was quoted as saying he wished Musicology to provide musical education to listeners. == Commercial performance == Musicology quickly proved to be Prince's most successful album since Diamonds and Pearls, reaching the Top 5 in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany and making a significant impression on charts around the world. It also proved to be well received by music critics. The title track was only released as a single in Australia, where it enjoyed moderate chart success and airplay. However it was also a hit on the US R&B; charts through airplay. The album was certified platinum by The RIAA in June 2004 and was certified double platinum in late January 2005. Part of the album's chart success is due to concertgoers receiving a copy of Musicology, with the album cost included in the ticket price for the Musicology Tour. This prompted Billboard magazine and Nielsen SoundScan to change its chart data methodology: For future album releases, Billboard says that customers \"must be given an option to either add the CD to the ticket purchase or forgo the CD for a reduced ticket-only price.\" A purple vinyl edition was released in February 2019. == Critical reception == Musicology received generally positive reviews from music critics. In his review for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau said that after the album's opening uptempo songs, \"pleasant shocks lurk near the surface and go against the flow of the quality material, and almost everything packs payback\". In a less enthusiastic review, Mojo magazine found it better produced and performed than it was written. == Accolades == Prince won two Grammy Awards, for Best Traditional R&B; Vocal Performance (\"Musicology\") and Best R&B; Vocal Performance\u2014Male (\"Call My Name\"), and was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance\u2014Male (\"Cinnamon Girl\"), Best R&B; Song (awarded to the songwriter) (\"Call My Name\"), and Best R&B; Album (Musicology). Prince was chosen by Rolling Stone magazine's readers as the best male performer and most welcome comeback. == Tour == Prince toured North America from March 27 to September 9, 2004 to promote Musicology. The tour was often billed as the Musicology Live 2004ever, or more commonly, the Musicology Tour. The tour earned $87.4 million and was attended by 1.47 million fans Although the tour promoted Musicology, only a select few tracks from the album were played during the concerts. The title track, \"Musicology\", and the two singles, \"Call My Name\" and \"Cinnamon Girl\", were among them. The tour featured many of Prince's more famous tracks, such as \"Little Red Corvette\", \"Raspberry Beret\", \"Kiss\", and \"Purple Rain\". A copy of Musicology was included with every concert ticket sold. == Track listing == All tracks written by Prince. == Personnel == * Prince \u2013 all vocals and instruments except as indicated * Candy Dulfer \u2013 vocals on \"Life 'o' the Party\" and \"Cinnamon Girl\", saxophone on \"Life 'o' the Party\", horns on \"The Marrying Kind\", \"If Eye Was the Man in Ur Life\" and \"On the Couch\" * Chance Howard \u2013 vocals on \"Life 'o' the Party\", \"Call My Name\" and \"Cinnamon Girl\" * Stokley \u2013 vocals on \"Call My Name\" * Kip Blackshire \u2013 vocals on \"Call My Name\" * Clare Fischer \u2013 strings on \"Call My Name\" * Rhonda Smith \u2013 vocals on \"Cinnamon Girl\", bass on \"Dear Mr. Man\" * John Blackwell \u2013 drums on \"The Marrying Kind\", \"If Eye Was the Man in Ur Life\", \"On the Couch\" and \"Dear Mr. Man\" * Maceo Parker \u2013 horns on \"The Marrying Kind\", \"If Eye Was the Man in Ur Life\" and \"On the Couch\" * Greg Boyer \u2013 horns on \"The Marrying Kind\", \"If Eye Was the Man in Ur Life\" and \"On the Couch\" * Ornella Bonaccorsi \u2013 Italian speech on \"What Do U Want Me 2 Do?\" * Sheila E. \u2013 shaker on \"Dear Mr. Man\" * Renato Neto \u2013 Fender Rhodes on \"Dear Mr. Man\" == Singles == * \"Musicology\" (#25 US Bubbling Under, #3 US R&B;) * \"Call My Name\" (#75 US) * \"Cinnamon Girl\" (UK) == Charts == === Weekly charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2004) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Spanish Albums (AFYVE) |align=\"center\"|20 |- |- |- |- |- |- !
