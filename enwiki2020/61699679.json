Himachal Tourism. Accessed 5 September 2019. It is located in the district of Kinnaur. Bhaba Pass connects the green and fertile Bhaba valley on the Kinnaur side with the Pin valley on the Spiti side. ==Overview== National Highway 22 runs alongside River Sutlej until Wangtu gives way to a narrow road leading to Katgaon and Kafnu. Katgaon and Kafnu are the base for one of the most beautiful trek routes in Himachal, the Bhaba trek. A moderate climb towards a glacial fed stream Bhaba river, to Bhabha Pass at 4890 meters altitude to enter Pin Valley in Spiti is a challenging adventure. Another trek in the west from the Bhaba Pass gets into Parvati Valley of Kullu. ==Distance== *Delhi: *Shimla: *Chandigarh: ==References== * Coordinates: Category:Geography of Himachal Pradesh ",
