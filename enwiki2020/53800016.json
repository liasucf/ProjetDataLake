The peloton was led by the team of Laurent Jalabert, who had won La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne four days earlier. Totschnig was later joined by Italian Ermanno Brignoli, but their lead had shrunk to five minutes on the Stockeu climb. The decisive break was made on the C\u00f4te de La Redoute at 40 km from the finish by Michele Bartoli, Laurent Jalabert and Alex Z\u00fclle. By the C\u00f4te de La Redoute, from the finish, Totschnig and Brignoli were caught by the peloton. Swiss Alex Z\u00fclle of the ONCE team attacked on the lower slopes of the climb, forcing the decisive breakaway. By the top of La Redoute, four men were in the leading break: teammates Z\u00fclle and Jalabert, and Italians Michele Bartoli and Marco Pantani. Climbing specialist Pantani was quickly dropped on the flat strecthes and Johan Museeuw, the ruling world champion, tried to bridge the gap to the leaders but missed out by 50 metres. With remaining, the three leaders had a 1' 10\" lead on the chase group, which was led by for World Cup leader Rolf S\u00f8rensen, and for Museeuw. Alex Z\u00fclle and Laurent Jalabert, trying to distance Michele Bartoli, attacked one after the other on the C\u00f4te de Sart Tilman, but were unable to drop the Italian. Z\u00fclle, who did most of the work in the lead group, was dropped after an acceleration of Bartoli in the final kilometres. As the two leaders approached the finish, Michele Bartoli launched an ultimate attack in the final uphill kilometre, dropping Jalabert and claiming his first win in the Ardennes classic. Jalabert was second at eight seconds. Gabriele Colombo and Luc Leblanc, who had broken away from the chase group, finished third and fourth. Max Sciandri won the sprint for fifth place before Johan Museeuw. ==Result== ==References== ==External links== * Official website 1997 Category:1997 in Belgian sport Liege-Bastogne-Liege Category:1997 in road cycling Category:April 1997 sports events in Europe ",
