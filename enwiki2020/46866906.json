    "text": "Wind power in Tennessee, which has significant potential in East Tennessee, is in the early stages of development. Renewable energy in Tennessee 2013 As of 2015, the state had not passed renewable portfolio standard legislation and there was one utility-scale wind farm. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), based in Knoxville, imports wind-generated electricity into its service area which includes Tennessee. US Senator Lamar Alexander from Tennessee is an outspoken critic of wind power. 2008 US Department of Energy wind power potential map of Tennessee ==Buffalo Mountain== TVA wind turbines on Buffalo Mountain Located north of Oak Ridge and Oliver Springs and east of Frozen Head State Park in about thirty miles northwest of Knoxville, Buffalo Mountain Wind Farm was built in 2000 by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) which operates three wind turbines with a combined generation capacity of 2 MW. It purchases the output of 15 additional wind turbines built in 2004 and owned by Invenergy that have a combined capacity of 27 MW. ==TVA import== The Tennessee Valley Authority service area covers most of Tennessee, portions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky, and small sections of Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. As of 2013, the agency had power purchased agreements with wind farms outside its service area: *2012 - Enel Green Power, LLC - 201MW - Caney River Wind Farm, Elk County, Kansas. *2012- Invenergy - 400MW - Bishop Hill Wind Energy Center, Henry County, Illinois 200 megawatts generated by General Electric 1.5-megawatt SLE turbines. This facility began delivery in July 2012. *2012- Invenergy - 200MW - California Ridge Wind Energy Center in Champaign County, Illinois *2012- NextEra Energy Resources - 150MW - White Oak Energy Center, McLean County, Illinois *2012- NextEra Energy Resources- 165MW - Cimarron Wind farm, Gray County, Kansas A 2010 agreement with Iberdrola Renewables provides a potential 300MW future supply from Streator-Cayuga Ridge Wind Farm, Livingston County, Illinois ==Clean Line Energy transmission== Clean Line Energy LLC is proposing 700-mile power transmission line to bring wind energy from Oklahoma and to the Tennessee Valley. The TVA would import 1,750 megawatts, about half of the power that could be transmitted. Developers began in 2007 to seek regulatory approval for the $2 billion project, but the approvals needed to start construction aren't expected to be in place until at least 2020. The project faces opposition, particularly in Arkansas. ==See also== *Solar power in Tennessee *Wind power in the United States *Renewable energy in the United States ==References== ==External links== *ASSESSMENT OF BAT MORTALITY AND ACTIVITY AT BUFFALO MOUNTAIN WINDFARM, EASTERN TENNESSEE *WINDExchange Department of Energy's Wind Program Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy Resources in Tennessee *Small Wind Electric Systems Department of Energy *Renewable energy in Tennessee 2013 ",
