He performed on several successful albums in the mid-1980s such as Peter Gabriel's 1986 album So and Sting's \u2026Nothing Like the Sun(1987) and The Soul Cages(1990).

He played drums on all tracks except one on Tracy Chapman's 1992 release Matters of the Heart. ===With Preface=== From 1985 to 1988 he was in the band Preface, with guitar player Kamil Rustam and keyboardist Jean-Yves D'Angelo. ===Solo=== In 1991, Katch\u00e9 released his first solo album, It's About Time, largely in the rock genre, with guest musicians like Daniel Lanois, David Rhodes, Peter Gabriel, David Sancious, Branford Marsalis and Sting.http://www.manu-katche.com/fr/discographie/9/its-about-time His subsequent solo releases have all been jazz. He released his second solo album on 12 September 2005 entitled Neighbourhood, which features Jan Garbarek on saxophone, Tomasz Sta\u0144ko on trumpet, Marcin Wasilewski on piano and Slawomir Kurkiewicz on double bass. His second ECM album, Playground was released in September 2007. In March 2010, Katch\u00e9 released Third Round, again on ECM. From 2003 to 2007, along with producer Dove Attia, composer Andr\u00e9 Manoukian and singer Marianne James, he was one of the four judges in the TV-show Nouvelle Star, the French version of the Idol series. He was the most feared judge for his wit and his severe judgment about the groove, rhythm and tempo of the singing contestants. Since January 2008, Katch\u00e9 has hosted the monthly program One Shot Not on Arte. In 2010 Katch\u00e9 composed the instrumental music for the six themed lands of the Belgian theme park Bellewaerde. An album, with the twelve compositions for the park, including music for the Mexican, western, Indian and Canadian areas, was sold in souvenir shops at the park.

Rahman, Hossam Ramzy and Omar Faruk Tekbilek. ==Discography== ===Solo albums=== * It's About Time (BMG, 1992) * Neighbourhood (ECM, 2005) * Playground (ECM, 2007) * Third Round (ECM, 2010) * Manu Katch\u00e9 (ECM, 2012) * Live in Concert (ACT, 2014) * Touchstone for Manu (ECM, 2014) * Unstatic (Anteprima, 2016) * The Scope (Anteprima, 2019) ===Participations=== With Jeff Beck *Who Else!
