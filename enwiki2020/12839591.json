    "text": "The Beni savanna, also known as the Llanos de Moxos or Moxos plains, is a tropical savanna ecoregion of the Beni Department of northern Bolivia. ==Setting== The Beni savanna covers an area of in the lowlands of northern Bolivia, with small portions in neighboring Brazil and Peru. Most of the Llanos de Moxos lies within the departments of El Beni, Cochabamba, La Paz, Pando, and Santa Cruz. The Llanos de Moxos occupies the southwestern corner of the Amazon basin, and the region is crossed by numerous rivers that drain the eastern slope of the Andes Mountains. The low relief of the savannas, coupled with wet season rains and snowmelt from the Andes, cause up to half the land to flood seasonally. The Beni savanna is surrounded by tropical moist forests; the Southwestern Amazonian moist forests to the north, west, and south, and the Madeira-Tapaj\u00f3s moist forests to the east. ===Climate=== The climate of the Beni savanna is tropical, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. The wet season generally extends from December to May, and annual rainfall ranges from 1300 in the east to 2000 mm in the west. ==Flora== The ecoregion comprises a mosaic of savannas and wetlands, with islands of forest and gallery forests along rivers. Flooding and fire are important ecological factors. ==Fauna== The ecoregion is home to the blue-throated macaw (Ara glaucogularis), which is critically endangered. ==People== The Llanos de Moxos was the setting for pre- Columbian agriculture, and appears to have been an early center of plant domestication. The inhabitants constructed agricultural earthworks: raised fields, causeways, canals, and about 4700 forested mounds over a 50,000 square kilometer area. Construction lasted from about 8850 BCE to about 1450 CE. Cultivation included manioc from about 8350 BCE, squash from about 8250 BCE, and maize from about 4,850 BCE. Several domestic crops, including manioc, squash, peanut, some varieties of chili and some beans, are genetically very close to wild species living in the Llanos de Moxos, suggesting that they were domesticated there.U. Lombardo et al. \"Early Holocene crop cultivation and landscape modification in Amazonia.\" Nature, published online 8 April 2020; doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2162-7 The people made decorated pottery, wove cotton cloth, and in some places buried their dead in large urns. Although Europeans arrived in South America in the late 15th century, they did not come to settle in the Llanos de Moxos until the late 17th century. The missions established by Jesuit missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries became many of the modern towns in the region. Since the 1950s, ranching has become the most important industry, and ranches dominate the landscape. ==Conservation and threats== A 2017 assessment found that 96,126 km2, or 77%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. ==See also== * 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus ==References== ==External links== * *Early and Middle Holocene Hunter-Gatherer Occupations in Western Amazonia: The Hidden Shell Middens Category:Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands Category:Ecoregions of Bolivia Category:Ecoregions of Brazil Category:Geography of Beni Department Category:Grasslands of Bolivia Category:Grasslands of Brazil Category:Neotropic ecoregions Category:Ramsar sites in Bolivia ",
