In 1806 he served as President of the Royal Medical Society.

On return to Edinburgh he taught anatomy and physiology at the extramural school on Surgeons Square, while also serving as a surgeon at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on Drummond Street. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1812. His proposers were Thomas Thomson, John Playfair and Thomas Allan. In June 1815 he published \"The Doctorines of Gall and Spurzheim\", which while criticising phrenology also did much to publicise this then relatively unknown \"science\". Ironically in his criticism he gave a concise and erudite summary of the complex dimensions of phrenology, enabling it to be understood to a far wider audience.http://www.historyofphrenology.org.uk/texts/gordon.htm Gordon instead supported the views of Reil.Nineteenth Century Origins of Neuroscientific Concepts, Edwin Clarke and L S Jacnya He lived at 19 Castle Street in Edinburgh's New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1817-18 He died on 14 June 1818 aged 32 and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard.
