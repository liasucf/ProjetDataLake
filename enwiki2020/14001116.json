The band's hits include the million-selling \"Sky High\" (1975), which reached the top ten on both sides of the Atlantic as well as in Japan. Scott and Dyer co-wrote the song \"Who Do You Think You Are\", originally recorded by Jigsaw. It was covered thereafter by a number of acts. It was a hit for Candlewick Green and in the 1990s for Saint Etienne in the United Kingdom, and for Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods in the United States. Jigsaw racked up a number of hit records around the world including in the UK, the United States, Japan, Australia and others. The other hit songs included \"If I Have to Go Away\" and \"Love Fire\". After Jigsaw split in the 1980s, Scott worked as a songwriter and record producer for other musicians, together with Ian Levine. His songs have been recorded by Nicki French, Bad Boys Inc, Boyzone, Jon Otis and many others. Most recently, Scott and Levine wrote and produced the albums Northern Soul 2007 and Disco 2008, both recorded in Scott's 'Racetrack' Studios in Ascot, Berkshire. Scott died on 10 May 2009. He had fallen from a ladder two weeks earlier and had brain surgery. Scott had a stroke shortly thereafter, and did not survive. He was 64 and is survived by his widow, Ann, and son, Sam. ==References== ==External links== *Mining for Overlooked Pop Music Jewels: Jigsaw *Jigsaw discography Category:English keyboardists Category:English male singer-songwriters Category:1945 births Category:2009 deaths Category:20th-century British singers ",
