Its members include the BBC and Hollywood studios. The association organises an annual awards ceremony (The BASE Awards, formerly the BVA Awards) in London. In 2003, the association reported a 61% increase of DVD sales alongside a tripling in the illegal downloading of film and television files. In 2010 the association publicised the fact that around six million people in the UK had failed to acquire a high-definition television signal for television sets that were HD ready. In 2016 the association changed its name from the British Video Association to the British Association for Screen Entertainment. ==References== ==External links== *Main Site Category:Business organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Entertainment organizations Category:1980 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organisations based in the City of Westminster Category:Organizations established in 1980 Category:DVD companies of the United Kingdom ",
