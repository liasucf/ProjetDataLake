It lies by the intersection of the two major state roads. (Split - Lovre\u0107 - Imotski and Ba\u0161ka Voda - St. Ilija Tunnel - Zagvozd - Grubine) == History == The town is first mentioned in 1931. Nearby hamlets Mra\u010daj, Matkovi\u0107i, \u017du\u017euli, Vukovi\u0107i, Karini and Jonji\u0107i have survived since 1718, after the Venetians liberated Imotski from Turkish occupation and returned it to Austrian Dalmatia. A population census was taken and the hamlet's names were added on to maps. At the time, the hamlets were assigned to the parish of St. Luke \u2013 Podbablje. The name Grubine originates from the name Gruba, a name common on medieval gravestones, called ste\u0107ci. The patroness of Grubine is Our Lady - Queen of Croats in whose honor residents established a new church in 1995.Our Lady - Queen of Croats church == Population == Grubine is the largest settlement in the Podbablje municipality with a population of 1,010 since 2011. == Economy == Construction has long been the main occupation, especially due to the construction of the Dalmatina highway and St. Elijah tunnel resulting in numerous enterprises in the construction business. Given its position close to the fields of Imotski, Grubine inherited an agricultural tradition in growing grapes and vegetables. After the completion of the St. Elias tunnel through the mountain Biokovo in 2013, the Imotski county has become well-connected to the Makarska Riviera. This stimulated touristic development in Grubine, making tourism the fastest growing industry there. For instance, before the tunnel opening Grubine counted zero accommodation units, while in 2016, there were 12 holiday villas with pools along with 2 apartments. The guests mostly come from West and North Europe. == Education == District school in Mra\u010daj The 4-year district school is situated In the hamlet of Mracaj and is part of the \u201cTin Ujevi\u0107\u201c Elementary school in Krivodol.

Every summer it organizes a football tournament called \u201cKraljica Hrvata\u201c (The Queen of Croats) where teams compete from across Dalmatia and near Herzegovina compete. A part of the tournament is a football competition between Grubine's hamlets called The Tournament of Surnames. The HKUD Kolajna association was established in the 1980s when it initiated the Grubine Carnival on the last weekend of Lent joining the old carnival tradition of the Imotski County.
