    "text": "Katie Liu Leung (born 8 August 1987) is a Scottish actress. She played Cho Chang, the first love interest for lead character Harry Potter in the Harry Potter film series. In 2012, Leung made her stage debut in the play Wild Swans. Leung has an interest in painting and photography and studied art and design at the University of the Arts London. ==Early life== Leung was born in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. She attended secondary school at Hamilton College, South Lanarkshire.LAU KIT WAI. Katie casts a spell. South China Morning Post. YOUNGPOST; Pg. 1. 11 December 2005. She is of Hong Kong descent; her father, Peter Leung, was a Hong Kong businessman, who opened a company in Glasgow, and her mother, Kar Wai Li, was a Hong Kong banker. Leung's parents divorced when she was three. ==Career== ===2005\u20132007: Harry Potter=== Leung's father saw an advertisement for a Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire casting call, and suggested she should try out. She waited four hours in line for a five-minute audition, despite feeling she had little likelihood of obtaining the role. Two weeks later, she was called back for a workshop and was cast as Cho Chang, beating out over 3,000 other girls for the part. In retrospect, she stated in an interview with the Daily Record that her Scottish accent probably gave her an advantage in the casting, as the casting director asked the girls who attended the audition, \"Is there anyone here from Scotland?\", to which only Leung raised her hand. In a 2011 interview, Leung said her fondest memory of the Harry Potter experience was the first audition, because both her parents, who were separated at the time, went with her. \"It was a really nice moment because my parents hadn't seen each other for a long, long time,\" Leung said. In an effort to heavily promote Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Warner Bros. sent Leung to China in the film's second week of release, which was unusual for a market not used to frequent celebrity visits. She appeared in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in which she and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) shared an on-screen kiss that received much media coverage. Her role was significant in the series at this point as Harry Potter's first romance. While Leung was greeted warmly by most fans of the series, some Potter fans, jealous of Leung's relationship with Harry in the film, created a \"I Hate Katie\" website and racist messages posted on fan websites were upsetting to Leung at the time. Leung's voice was used in the video games Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. ===2007\u2013present=== In July 2007, Leung was cast by Gold Label Records, a subsidiary of EMI in Hong Kong, to be the female lead in the music video Love Coming Home () by Leo Ku. Leung filmed the video in London while promoting the new Harry Potter film. Ku described Leung's acting as \"professional\" and \"mature.\" Leung played Hsui Tai in the episode \"Cat Among the Pigeons\" of ITV1's Agatha Christie's Poirot, which premiered on ITV on 21 September 2008. Leung has been named as Scotland's most stylish female and as the hottest Scotswoman in 2007 by The Scotsman. She has also been featured in Teen Vogue and in Evening Standard. Following the end of the Harry Potter films, Leung said she was uncertain if she wanted to continue a career in acting. However, after attending a drama course at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, she was inspired. In December 2011, she was awarded the role of Jung Chang as her debut stage role in Jung Chang's autobiographical play Wild Swans. In comparing film to live performances, Leung said, \"The obvious challenge is of course getting it right the first time, which is weirdly exciting for me.\" The play made its world premiere in Cambridge, Massachusetts in February 2012, before returning to Motherwell. In June 2012, it was confirmed that Leung would be starring in Channel 4 four-part drama series called Run as leading character called Ying. Leung's character Nu-Ying is an illegal Chinese immigrant who sells pirate DVDs and stolen phones on the streets of Brixton in hope of making a life for herself in the UK. But first she must pay her debts to the Snakehead gang who smuggled her into Britain.Channel 4 Run Cast Announcement She starred in The World of Extreme Happiness (The Shed at the National Theatre, 2013), in which she played Sunny, along with Vera Chok as Xiao Li, a female migrant worker, in a production about the world of migrant workers in rapidly emerging modern China. Leung has also appeared in the BBC's production Father Brown crime drama series. In April 2014, it was announced that Leung was to play the role of Mei, a first-born Chinese girl adopted by an American mother and British father, in the TV miniseries One Child. In the story, her character is asked to return to her birthplace, Guangzhou, when her birth mother desperately seeks her assistance in saving her son. The series is produced by BBC Drama production for BBC Two and is co-produced with Sundance TV. It was scheduled to begin production in May 2014 in London and Hong Kong and aired in February 2016.Tatlow, Didi Kirsten (30 November 2014). \"Opaque Justice in China: Katie Leung Stars in 'One Child' by Guy Hibbert\".

In 2017, Leung co-starred with Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan in The Foreigner, playing Fan, Chan's character's daughter. ==Personal life== Leung delayed plans to go to art college and university to film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. During this period, Leung had said she was undecided about pursuing an acting career after Harry Potter and wished to attend university to study art and design. In 2007, she helped The Prince's Trust charity of Scotland raise \u00a3100,000 by launching a children's art competition and also donated one of her own paintings which was auctioned for \u00a3960. Leung has expressed a passion for photography. In 2009, she was one of two celebrities who donated a photo to Sightsavers International's I:Click 2009 competition. Sightsavers International is a charitable organisation to combat blindness in poor countries. While appearing in Wild Swans, Leung worked to complete her photography degree.

She speaks fluent Cantonese and some Mandarin. On 19 August 2018, Leung participated in the wedding of another former Harry Potter cast member, Afshan Azad. ==Filmography== === Film === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" !Year !Title !Role !Notes |- |2005 |Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire |rowspan=4|Cho Chang |Film |- |2007 ||Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix |rowspan=2|Film and video game |- |2009 |Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince |- |2011 ||Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 |rowspan=3|Film |- |2017 |T2 Trainspotting |Nurse |- |2017 |The Foreigner |Fan |} === Television === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" !Year !Title !Role !Notes |- |2008 |Agatha Christie's Poirot |Hsui Tai |Season 11 Episode 2: \"Cat among the pigeons\". |- |2013 ||Run |Ying |TV mini-series (4 Episodes) |- |rowspan=2|2014 |Father Brown |Jia-Li Gerard |TV production (Series 2, Episode 8: \"The Prize of Colonel Gerard\") |- |One Child |Mei Ashley |TV mini-series (3 Episodes) |- |2018 |Strangers |Lau Chen |TV series |- |rowspan=2|2019 |Chimerica |Liuli |TV mini-series (4 Episodes) |- |Moominvalley |Too-Ticky |Animated series; Voice |- |2020 |The Nest |Eleanor |TV mini-series (2 Episodes) |- |2020 |Roadkill |Margaret Moore |TV mini-series (1 Episode) |} ==Stage== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" !Year !Title !Role !Notes |- |2012 |Wild Swans |Jung Chang | |- |2013 |The World of Extreme Happiness |Sunny |National Theatre, London |- |2015 |You For Me For You |Junhee |Royal Court Theatre: Jerwood Theatre Upstairs |- |2016 |The Intelligent Homosexual's Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures (iHo) |Sooze |Hampstead Theatre, London |- |2017 |Snow in Midsummer |Dou Ti |Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon |- |2019 |White Pearl |Sunny |Royal Court Theatre, London |} ==Awards== 2006 * Outstanding Newcomer Award, Asian Excellence Awards (Top 4) * Young Scots Award (nominee) 2007 * Scotland's Most Stylish Female * No. 80 on the Cosmogirl's Hot 100 List 2008 * Best Kiss Nominee 2008 MTV Movie Awards US (alongside Daniel Radcliffe) 2014 * BAFTA Breakthrough Brits 2014 Katie Leung, BAFTA Breakthrough Brits 2014 ==References== ==External links== * * \"Katie Leung - CV\".
