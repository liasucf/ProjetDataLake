    "text": "In mathematical logic, Heyting arithmetic (sometimes abbreviated HA) is an axiomatization of arithmetic in accordance with the philosophy of intuitionism.Troelstra 1973:18 It is named after Arend Heyting, who first proposed it. ==Introduction== Heyting arithmetic adopts the axioms of Peano arithmetic (PA), but uses intuitionistic logic as its rules of inference. In particular, the law of the excluded middle does not hold in general, though the induction axiom can be used to prove many specific cases. For instance, one can prove that is a theorem (any two natural numbers are either equal to each other, or not equal to each other). In fact, since \"=\" is the only predicate symbol in Heyting arithmetic, it then follows that, for any quantifier-free formula p, is a theorem (where x, y, z\u2026 are the free variables in p). ==History== Kurt G\u00f6del studied the relationship between Heyting arithmetic and Peano arithmetic. He used the G\u00f6del\u2013Gentzen negative translation to prove in 1933 that if HA is consistent, then PA is also consistent. ==Related concepts== Heyting arithmetic should not be confused with Heyting algebras, which are the intuitionistic analogue of Boolean algebras. ==See also== *Harrop formula *BHK interpretation *Realizability ==References== *Ulrich Kohlenbach (2008), Applied proof theory, Springer. *Anne S.
