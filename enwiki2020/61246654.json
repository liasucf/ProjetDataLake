    "text": "Nathan James Decalvia Ferguson (born 12 October 1995) is an English professional footballer who plays for League Two club Crawley Town. He can play as a midfielder or a forward. He spent his youth in the academies at Norwich City and Dagenham and Redbridge. He then spent the early part of his career moving between various clubs in the Southern League, Isthmian League and National League, including: Chelmsford City, St Albans City, Hastings United, Billericay Town, Grays Athletic, Dartford, Southport, Bromley and Folkestone Invicta. He also had two brief and unsuccessful spells in the English Football League with Burton Albion and Port Vale. He finally established himself at Dulwich Hamlet, and helped the club to win promotion out of the Isthmian League Premier Division at the end of the 2017\u201318 season. He earned a move to League Two club Crawley Town in June 2019. == Career == === Early career === Ferguson started his career in Norwich City in their youth academy before transferring to Dagenham and Redbridge's academy. His goal against Gillingham Academy on 3 November 2012 was nominated for the November Football League Academy goal of the month competition. On 14 August 2013, he joined Conference South club Chelmsford City on a one-month loan deal. He made his debut in senior football for the \"Clarets\", coming on as a 68th-minute substitute for Tom Derry in a 2\u20131 defeat at Tonbridge Angels, in what would be his only appearance for the club. On 20 December 2013, he joined St Albans City on a one-month loan. He played four Southern League Premier games for the \"Saints\". He ended the 2013\u201314 season at Isthmian League Division One South club Hastings United, though would score an own goal in extra-time to gift Folkestone Invicta a 3\u20132 victory in the play-off semi- finals at Cheriton Road after he attempted to block a pass only to see the ball loop over his own keeper's head from 30-yards out. After being released by the \"Daggers\", he signed for Billericay Town of the Isthmian League Premier Division in September 2014. He was used as a winger by manager Craig Edwards, but lost his first team place after picking up a hamstring injury. He signed for league rivals Grays Athletic in February 2015, in hope of more regular football. He helped the \"Grays\" to lose just one of their final 14 matches of the season, which left the club just one point outside the play-offs. He also played in the Isthmian League Cup final, which ended in a 3\u20132 defeat to Hendon. He impressed for the \"Gravelmen\", and praised managers Glen Little and Mark Bentley for allowing him the freedom to express himself. The club reported that Fleetwood Town made an illegal approach for the player in October 2015. === Burton Albion === Ferguson signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with League One side Burton Albion on 2 December 2015 after impressing manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink on trial. In doing so he went against the advice of Grays manager Mark Bentley, who said that he should see out the season with Grays Athletic, saying that \"sitting in U21 sides is not what they [Ferguson and Dumebi Dumaka] need\". Nigel Clough replaced Hasselbaink as \"Brewers\" boss just two days later, and Ferguson failed to make an appearance at the Pirelli Stadium. He was loaned to Dartford on 24 March 2016. He played seven National League South games for the \"Darts\", and scored the winning goal in a 2\u20131 victory over Maidstone United at the Gallagher Stadium on 9 April. He also played in the final of the Kent Senior Cup, where Dartford beat Charlton Athletic 3\u20131. === Port Vale === On 26 July 2016, Ferguson signed a one-year contract with Port Vale, becoming manager Bruno Ribeiro's 13th signing of the summer. He made his first and only appearance for the \"Valiants\" as a first- half substitute in an EFL Trophy match against Derby County Under 23s at Vale Park on 30 August. On 8 October, he joined National League side Southport on a month-long loan. He played seven games for Steve Burr's \"Sandgrounders\". Ferguson left Vale by mutual consent on 30 January 2017 after coming to an agreement with new boss Michael Brown on the remainder of his contract. === Return to non-league === Ferguson returned to the National League, signing with Bromley in March 2017. However his only appearance for the \"Ravens\" came in the Kent Senior Cup. He signed on loan for Folkestone Invicta towards the end of the 2016\u201317 season. He featured in three Isthmian League Premier Division games for the \"Seasiders\", scoring one goal. He signed for Dulwich Hamlet on 1 July 2017. He scored seven goals from 52 appearances in the 2017\u201318 season, and played in the play-off final victory over Hendon that secured the club promotion out of the Isthmian League. He remained a key player at Champion Hill in the National League South, scoring three goals from 39 games in the 2018\u201319 campaign. === Crawley Town === On 14 June 2019, Ferguson signed for League Two club Crawley Town on a three-year-deal for an undisclosed fee. On 3 August, he made his professional debut, playing the full 90 minutes away to Carlisle United. He scored his first goal for the \"Red Devils\" seven days later, in a 2\u20130 victory against Salford City at Broadfield Stadium. He totalled six goals in 39 appearances throughout the truncated 2019\u201320 season. ==Style of play== Ferguson is able to play as a midfielder or forward and has pace, power and skill. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Chelmsford City (loan) |2013\u201314 |Conference South |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |St Albans City (loan) |2013\u201314 |Southern League Premier |4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||4||0 |- |Hastings United (loan) |2013\u201314||Isthmian League Division One South||8||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||8||0 |- |Billericay Town |2014\u201315||Isthmian League Premier Division||3||0||1||0||0||0||1||0||5||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Grays Athletic |2014\u201315||Isthmian League Premier Division||15||1||0||0||0||0||0|2||0|||17||1 |- |2015\u201316||Isthmian League Premier Division||10||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||10||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !25!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!27!!1 |- |Burton Albion |2015\u201316 |League One |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |Dartford (loan) |2015\u201316 |National League South |7||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||1 |- |Port Vale |2016\u201317 |League One |0||0||0||0||0||0||1Appearances in the EFL Trophy||0||1||0 |- |Southport (loan) |2016\u201317 |National League |4||0||3||0||0||0||0||0||7||0 |- |Bromley |2016\u201317 |National League |0||0||0||0||0||0||1Appearances in the Kent Senior Cup||0||1||0 |- |Folkestone Invicta (loan) |2016\u201317 |Isthmian League Premier Division |3||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Dulwich Hamlet |2017\u201318 |Isthmian League Premier Division |43||6||2||0||0||0||72 appearances and 1 goal in the FA Trophy, 3 appearances in the Alan Turvey Trophy and 2 appearances in the play-offs||1||52||7 |- |2018\u201319 |National League South |38||3||0||0||0||0||1Appearances in the FA Trophy||0||39||3 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !81!!9!!2!!0!!0!!0!!8!!1!!91!!10 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Crawley Town |2019\u201320 |League Two |31||5||2||0||4||1||2||0||39||6 |- |2020\u201321 |League Two |6||0||0||0||1||0||2||1||9||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !37!!5!!2!!0!!5!!1!!4!!1!!48!!7 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !137!!16!!7!!0!!5!!1!!14!!2!!163!!19 |} ;Notes ==Honours== Grays Athletic *Isthmian League Cup runner-up: 2015 Dartford *Kent Senior Cup: 2016 Dulwich Hamlet *Isthmian League Premier Division play-offs: 2018 ==References== Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Black English sportspeople Category:Footballers from Walthamstow Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football forwards Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. players Category:Chelmsford City F.C. players Category:St Albans City F.C. players Category:Hastings United F.C. players Category:Billericay Town F.C. players Category:Grays Athletic F.C. players Category:Burton Albion F.C. players Category:Dartford F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Southport F.C. players Category:Bromley F.C. players Category:Folkestone Invicta F.C. players Category:Dulwich Hamlet F.C. players Category:Crawley Town F.C. players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Southern Football League players Category:Isthmian League players Category:English Football League players ",
