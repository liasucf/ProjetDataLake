    "text": "The West Point Story, also known simply as West Point, is a dramatic anthology television series shown in the United States by CBS during the 1956\u201357 season and by ABC during the 1957\u201358 season. ==History== Carolyn Craig and Martin Milner in premiere episode (1956) The West Point Story, produced with the full cooperation of the United States Department of Defense and the United States Military Academy, was said to be based on actual files documenting many of the real-life dramatic occurrences at West Point over the years. Names and dates were altered in order to protect the privacy of the real people portrayed, however. The program was hosted by a fictional cadet, Charles C. Thompson (portrayed by actor Donald May). During its second season on ABC, The West Point Story was in competition with NBC's The Californians, set in San Francisco during the gold rush of the 1850s, and with The $64,000 Question quiz series on CBS. The West Point Story was replaced on the summer schedule in 1958 by Jack Wyatt's Confession, which continued to air during the first half of the 1958\u20131959 season in the 10 p.m. Tuesday evening time slot. At the time that The West Point Story was broadcast, four other military dramas aired either through syndication or on the major networks: Harbor Command, Navy Log, The Silent Service, and Men of Annapolis.
