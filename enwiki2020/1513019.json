    "text": "Theodor von Hornbostel testifies for the prosecution during the Ministries Trial __NOTOC__ The Ministries Trial (or, officially, the United States of America vs. Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker, et al.) was the eleventh of the twelve trials for war crimes the U.S. authorities held in their occupation zone in Germany in Nuremberg after the end of World War II. These twelve trials were all held before U.S. military courts, not before the International Military Tribunal, but took place in the same rooms at the Palace of Justice. The twelve U.S. trials are collectively known as the \"Subsequent Nuremberg Trials\" or, more formally, as the \"Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals\" (NMT). This case is also known as the Wilhelmstrasse Trial, so-named because both the Reich Chancellery and the German Foreign Office were located at the Wilhelmstrasse street in Berlin, which was often used as a metonym for overall German governmental administration. The defendants in this case were officials of various Reich ministries, facing various charges for their roles in Nazi Germany and thus their participation in or responsibility for the numerous atrocities committed both in Germany and in occupied countries during the war. The judges in this case, heard before Military Tribunal VI, were William C. Christianson (presiding judge) from Minnesota, Robert F. Maguire from Oregon and Leon W. Powers from Iowa. The Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was Telford Taylor; the chief prosecutor was Robert Kempner. The indictment was filed on 15 November 1947; the hearings lasted from 6 January 1948 until 18 November that year. Five months later, on 11 April 1949, the judges presented their 833-page judgment. Sentences were handed down on 13 April 1949. Of all the twelve trials, this was the one that lasted longest and ended last. Of the 21 defendants arraigned, two were acquitted, the other 19 were found guilty on at least one count of their indictments and received prison sentences ranging from three years to 25 years. ==Indictment== Telford Taylor delivers the prosecution's opening statement. The defendants were indicted on seven counts: Count 1: Crimes Against Peace Count 2: Taking part in a common plan or conspiracy to commit the aforementioned crimes Count 3: War crimes Count 4: Crimes Against Humanity Count 5: War crimes and Crimes Against Humanity through the plundering and spoliation of the Occupied Territories Count 6: War crimes and Crimes Against Humanity through the enslavement and deportation of concentration camp prisoners and civilians in the occupied countries for slave labor. Count 7: Membership in a criminal organization, the NSDAP and the SS. Count 2 was dropped by the NMT in all trials. == Defendants == {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Name !align=center|Photo !align=\"left\"|Function !align=\"left\"|Sentence |- |valign=\"top\"|Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker |60px |valign=\"top\"|Permanent Secretary of State in the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt (Foreign Ministry) under Ribbentrop until 1943, then ambassador to the Holy See; SS- Brigadef\u00fchrer.
