    "text": "The monuments in 2016 Gospodor Monument Park is a roadside attraction along Interstate 5 near Toledo, Washington, in the United States. It features four sculptures, collectively known as the Gospodor monuments, created in 2002. The tallest, standing at more than 100 feet, commemorates Mother Teresa and features a gold painted wooden statue of Jesus. Next to this monument is one featuring Mother Teresa herself. Another honors victims of The Holocaust and features an eternal electric flame. The park also includes a 100-foot tall monument depicting Chief Seattle to commemorate Native Americans and other indigenous tribes. After their installation in 2002, the sculptures caused routine traffic jams due to drivers rubbernecking and slowing down. The monuments, along with their night lights, were highly controversial with local residents and Gospodor was prevented from erecting additional sculptures by the county government. ==See also== * 2002 in art * Commemorations of Mother Teresa * List of Holocaust memorials and museums in the United States ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 establishments in Washington (state) Category:2002 sculptures Category:Holocaust memorials Category:Interstate 5 Category:Monuments and memorials in Washington (state) Category:Mother Teresa Category:Outdoor sculptures in Washington (state) Category:Parks in Washington (state) Category:Roadside attractions in Washington (state) Category:Sculptures of men in Washington (state) Category:Sculptures of Native Americans in Washington (state) Category:Sculptures of women in Washington (state) Category:Statues in Washington (state) Category:Statues of Jesus Category:Wooden sculptures in Washington (state) ",
