    "text": "Chinese calligraphy of the character representing the surname \"M\u00e9i.\"Mei () is a romanized spelling of a Chinese surname, transcribed in the Mandarin dialect. In Hong Kong and other Cantonese-speaking regions, the name may be transliterated as Mui or Moy.Louie, Emma Woo: \"Chinese American Names\"., p.29. McFarland & Co, Inc., 1998. In Vietnam, this surname is spelled Mai. In romanized Korean, it is spelled Mae. The name literally translates in English to the plum fruit. The progenitor of the M\u00e9i clan, M\u00e9i Bo, originated from near a mountain in ancient China that was lined at its base with plum trees.Li, Jin Sheng: \"Y\u00fan h\u00e9 S\u0101n Bai X\u00ecng.\", p. 77. Print date unavailable. \"Mei\" is also an Italian surname, and one transcription of the Slavic surname also spelt Mey (\u041c\u0435\u0439). == Origins == The M\u00e9i clan came from the Zi (\u5b50) family. They were awarded a kingdom in the southeast of Bo County in Anhui called Mei kingdom. The M\u00e9i ancestral hometown is located 60 miles southeast of Runan county, Henan province in central China. The first patriarch of the M\u00e9i lineage was M\u00e9i Bo or the Earl of M\u00e9i. During King Zhou's reign (Shang Dynasty,1766-1122 BCE), M\u00e9i Bo pleaded repeatedly to King Zhou to repent from his cruel and corrupt ways. M\u00e9i Bo's convictions angered the erratic ruler, which he viewed as insubordination. As punishment, the Earl of M\u00e9i was beheaded. Inspired by M\u00e9i Bo's acts, his descendants subsequently adopted the surname of M\u00e9i to pay homage to this ancient noble. ==People with the surname Mei (\u6885) == * Anita Mui, Hong Kong singer and actress * James Mui, American musician of Puerto Rican and Chinese descent. * Mei Ju-ao, jurist of the Tokyo Trial * Mei Lanfang (1894-1961), Beijing opera actor * Lexton Moy, American soccer player of Chinese and Filipino heritage * Mei Lin, Chinese actress * Milagros Moy, Peruvian volleyball player * Mei Quong Tart, Australian Chinese businessman * Sylvia Moy, American singer and songwriter * Mai Thuc Loan, Vietnamese emperor * Mei Yaochen, Song Dynasty poet * Moy Yat, Kung Fu master (Wing Chun) * Mei Veronica, Violinist ==People with the surname Mei (Italian)== * Andrea Mei (born 1989), Italian footballer * Anna Mei (born 1967), Italian racing cyclist and mountain biker * Bernardino Mei (1612/15\u20131676), Italian painter and engraver * Giovanni Mei (born 1953), Italian retired footballer * Girolamo Mei (1519\u20131594), Italian historian and humanist * Nicola Mei (1985), Italian professional basketball player * Paolo Mei (1831\u20131900), Italian painter * Stefano Mei (born 1963), Italian long- distance runner ==People with the surname Mei/Mey (\u041c\u0435\u0439)== * Lev Mei (1822-1862), Russian dramatist and poet * Lydia Mei (1896-1965), Estonian artist * Natalie Mei (1900-1975), Estonian painter and graphic artist == References == Category:Chinese-language surnames Category:Individual Chinese surnames ",
