He dedicated the work as thanks to Earl Charles O'Hegerty, the occupant of Tillysburg Castle, near Sankt Florian. It is not known when the song was performed at that time. On 13 May 1996 the work was performed again on the authentic location (Tillysburg Castle).U.

The work is issued in Band XXIII/2, No. 11 of the '.Gesamtausgabe \u2013 Weltliche Ch\u00f6re == Text == ' uses a text by Ernst Marinelli. {| | |style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|Let grant me today to say A word of thanks to you. O, that I could respectfully sing My happy feeling, Which lightens me up this day, The day of delight of yours, During which love and thanks surround you, When all are joining! The first cheer is for the father, Shouted by the children, Who, as a dear and sweet yoke, Bend themselves at your chest. You tell all their dear heads, The heads of your beloved. O, do not cry, the full number Is made by an angel over there. The second cheer, not less worthy, It sounds as from one mouth, Is brought to you by the host of friends In noble and faithful bond Who join your life, Even if they are faraway. You have good intentions for them, Cheers! they like to call you. And this cheer may sound loudly, Sound well with hundred voices, All those, who are dear to you, Arise a happy thanks. The poor, whom you revived, The servant, whom you have chosen, The singer, whom you make happy, And who swears you their thanks. |} The \"angel\", to whom the text refers, could be O'Hegerty's wife, who deceased in 1845, or his son, who deceased in 1854. == Music == The 89-bar long work in F major is scored for choir with humming voices and soloists. The song begins with a tenor soloist with accompaniment of humming voices. From bar 15 (\"Wenn alle sich vereinen\") the choir takes it over. On bar 23 (\"O weine nicht,\"), the tenor soloist takes it over with again accompaniment of humming voices. The choir takes it again over at the beginning of the third strophe. The same process is repeated on bar 46 (\"Du hast's mit ihnen wohl gemeint,\") with a bass soloist, and on bar 68 (\"Der Arme ruft's,\") with two tenor soloists. Thereafter, the choir goes till the end with a repeat of the first part of the fourth strophe.C. van Zwol, booklet of CD LIVA 054 == Discography == There is a single recording of Des Dankes Wort sei mir verg\u00f6nnt. * Thomas Kerbl, M\u00e4nnerchorvereinigung Bruckner 12, Weltliche M\u00e4nnerch\u00f6re \u2013 CD: LIVA 054, 2012 == References == == Sources == * Anton Bruckner \u2013 S\u00e4mtliche Werke, Band XXIII/2: Weltliche Chorwerke (1843\u20131893), Musikwissenschaftlicher Verlag der Internationalen Bruckner-Gesellschaft, Angela Pachovsky and Anton Reinthaler (Editor), Vienna, 1989 * Cornelis van Zwol, Anton Bruckner 1824\u20131896 \u2013 Leven en werken, uitg.
