    "text": "Italy\u2013Mexico relations refers to the diplomatic relations between Italy and Mexico. Both nations are members of the G20, Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development and the United Nations. == History == The first contact between Italy and Mexico was in 1869, just before the end of Italian unification in 1870; when Italy expressed its desire to open a consulate in Mexico. An Italian consulate was opened in Mexico in December 1872, however, diplomatic relations between the two nations were not established until 15 December 1874.History of diplomatic relations between Italy and Mexico (Spanish) In 1875, Mexico opened a diplomatic office in Rome. During World War I, Mexico remained neutral because it was involved in its own revolution during the same time and closed its diplomatic office in Rome. It re-opened its diplomatic office in 1922. In the 1930s, diplomatic relations between the two nations began to deteriorate when Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini invaded and annexed Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935-1936. Mexico was one of the few countries to vehemently oppose the occupation of Abyssinia by Italian forces. During World War II, on 22 May 1942, Mexico declared war on the Axis powers (which included Italy) due to German U-boat attacks on two Mexican oil tankers in the Gulf of Mexico that same year. Diplomatic relations were re-established on 1 June 1946 and Italy and Mexico signed a Treaty of Peace on 10 February 1947.Relations between Mexico and Italy (in Spanish) In 1974, President Luis Echeverr\u00eda \u00c1lvarez became the first Mexican head-of-state to visit Italy. In 1981, President Sandro Pertini became the first Italian head-of-state to visit Mexico. Since the initial visits, there have been numerous visits between leaders of both nations.
