    "text": "Codfish Falls is a series of close-knit plunges and cascades, ending in a fan, that is fed by Fishers Brook, in Storrs, Connecticut (a village in the town of Mansfield). It can be accessed by a trail from a road of the same name. The falls has carved out a steep-sided gorge, averaging twenty feet deep, which is in sharp contrast to the surrounding land. It feeds into the nearby Fenton River. ==See also== * Fishers Brook * Fenton River * Nipmuck Trail ==References== ==External links== * Photograph of the falls Credit goes to the photographer.
