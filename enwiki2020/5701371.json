    "text": "\"Dvadaset prvi vijek\" (\"The 21st Century\") was the Bosnian and Herzegovinian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1995, performed in Bosnian by Davorin Popovi\u0107. The song was performed fourth on the night, following Germany's Stone & Stone with \"Verliebt in Dich\" and preceding Norway's Secret Garden with \"Nocturne\". At the close of voting, it had received 14 points, placing 19th in a field of 23. The song is a power ballad, in which the singer wonders where his lover is. He explains his desperation by saying that \"The 21st century is coming my dear\", and presumably he wants her with him to celebrate that momentous occasion. It was succeeded as Bosnian and Herzegovinian representative at the 1996 Contest by Amila Glamo\u010dak singing \"Za na\u0161u ljubav\".
