Starting with hip hop, I wanted to tap into the 'conscious' and improvisatory elements of the music in order to shine a light on some of the socioeconomic issues in America today. Existentialist philosophy comes into play as a mechanism to underscore the experience of Millenials who feel lost in a world where nothing is as they planned it. A 'Postmodernist' narrative structure is employed to frame the revolutionary spirit of the characters hoping to shape the world.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:English-language films Category:2015 films Category:American romantic musical films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American films Category:2010s romantic musical films Category:2015 romantic drama films Category:2015 drama films ",
