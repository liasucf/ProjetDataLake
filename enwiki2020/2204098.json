    "text": "Rock and Roll Over is the fifth studio album by American rock band Kiss, released in 1976. It was recorded at the Star Theatre in Nanuet, New York. ==Album information== To get the proper drum sound, Peter Criss recorded his tracks in a bathroom, communicating via video-link with the rest of the band. Criss sings \"Baby Driver\" \u2013 a rewrite of a Criss/Penridge demo from Criss's pre-Kiss band Lips \u2013 and \"Hard Luck Woman\". Paul Stanley originally wanted the latter to be sung by Rod Stewart, but Gene Simmons insisted Criss sing it. \"Hard Luck Woman\" did not equal the success of \"Beth\", but became another top 20 single. \"Calling Dr. Love\" became a concert staple. Three of Gene Simmons' songs are clear re-workings of demos from the 1975 Magna Graphics Studios demo: \"Ladies Room\" is based on \"Don't Want Your Romance\"; \"Love'Em and Leave'Em\" is based on \"Rock and Rolls-Royce\" and \"Calling Dr. Love\" is a re- working of \"Bad, Bad Lovin'\" The cover artwork is by artist Michael Doret, who worked with Kiss again on 2009's Sonic Boom. The live album Kings Among Scotland, by Anthrax, plays homage to the artwork.https://anthrax.com/kings- among-scotland/ This is the first Kiss album to not feature a writing credit from Ace Frehley. ==Release== Rock and Roll Over was released by Casablanca Records on November 11, 1976.
