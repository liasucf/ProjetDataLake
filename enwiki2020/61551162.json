Thus, it is in 1544 when the first written documents about the Spanish presence in Belize are registered.

For their part, the first Spanish missionaries in Belize arrived in the territory in 1550 and evangelized the population of the Choles area (a linguistic group belonging to the ethnic group of K'ekchi), reaching the Bay of Amatique (in the current Province of the Verapaz, in the southern half of present-day Belize). However, there were few Spaniards who settled there, due to the lack of resources for them important, such as gold, and the strong defense of the Mayan people regarding the Peninsula of Yucatan. Thus, Spanish settlers residing in Belize frequently fought against the Maya, who, in addition, were affected by slavery and the diseases carried by the Spaniards. However, after the mid-sixteenth century, there is little evidence of Spanish explorations in Belize, although not evangelization: in 1618 the Puct\u00e9 region was evangelized, in the north of present-day Belize, and, in 1621, the region was of the Mopanes and Tip\u00faes, in the central part of the territory. The only exception of Spanish explorations in Belize after the mid-16th century is found on a trip made by a Dominican father, Fray Jos\u00e9 Delgado, in 1677. Delgado traveled throughout Belize towards the municipality of Bacalar, in the Mexican state Quintana Roo. However, he could not continue on his way because, before reaching the Mexican municipality, he was captured and stripped by some Englishmen in some area near the Texoc River - probably the current Mullins River.Northern Belize.com On the other hand, between 1638 and 1695, the Mayans residing in Tipu enjoyed autonomy from Spanish rule. But in 1696, Spanish soldiers used Tipu as a base from which the area would be pacified and missionary activities would be supported. In 1697 the Spaniards conquered Itz\u00e1, and in 1707, the Spaniards forcibly resettled the inhabitants of Tipu in an area close to Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1.Bolland, Nigel. \"Belice: Marco hist\u00f3rico\".

In 1717, after the British settlement in Belize between the 16th and 17th centuries and in order to remove foreigners from the area, the army led by Marshal Antonio Figueroa and Silva Lazo, governor of the Yucatan Peninsula, expelled the English of Rio Belize. Even so, over time, the British ended up returning, so this expedition developed a series of Spanish raids to expel them at various times. Later, on January 20, 1783, Great Britain and Spain signed the peace and shortly thereafter signed the Treaty of Versailles, in which Spain ceded to Britain a small part of the current Belize, about 1,482 km\\- or 4,804-, located between the rivers Hondo and Belize. In addition, due to the request of British settlers to obtain more territory to have a greater area of action, since the territory assigned to them was very limited, the London Convention of 1786 by which Spain gave him another 1,883 km of Belize (reaching the Sib\u00fan River or Laguna Manate, south of Belize River). However, sometime between 1786 and 1796, a Spanish official who visited the Yucatan to report on Baymen's activities indicated that the Baymen were dangerously expanding their borders to cut the dye stick also in Campeche , near a city of Spanish population. Therefore, Spain issued orders for the immediate and effective expulsion of settlers who occupied Belize. This triggered a war between Great Britain and Spain on the coast of Belize in September 1798, a war that was called The Battle of St. George's Cay and ended with the Spanish defeat. Because of that, the British were able to stay in Belizean territory - and throughout the continental part of Central America-, being able to freely exercise their dominance in the area, although the territory remained, officially, Spanish.Battle of Saint George's Caye: English Settlers Foil Spanish Invasion.
