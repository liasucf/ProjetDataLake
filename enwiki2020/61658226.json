Kavitha (Priyanjali), the daughter of the local rich landlord, falls in love with Sakthivel. Kavitha's father (Duraipandian), who wants his daughter to marry an IPS officer, asks Sakthivel to marry his daughter. First reluctant, Sakthivel accepts after the insistence of Shanmugam. Meanwhile, Kavitha's uncle Karuppusamy (Ramesh Kanna), a nothing-for-good, wants to marry Kavitha at any cost. Sakthivel and Kavitha get engaged, and Sakthivel then leaves the village to attend the IPS interview in Delhi. The day of the wedding, Sakthivel returns to the village and announces that he did not attend the interview.

Sakthivel explains to his father that he had to perform the last rites of his teacher (Gowthami Vembunathan) who took care of him when he was young.

In the presentation, the film is outdated and totally predictable [..] There is nothing really to recommend in this film, even the music of Deva is a big letdown\". A reviewer wrote, \"Debutants Trivikram and Priyanjali are just ok. Ahudi Prasad, as the poor illiterate father has given a good performance\" and added, \"the movie lacks pace. Certain melodramatic scenes could have been avoided which would have made the film more presentable\". Malini Mannath stated, \"the whole set-up coupled with a storyline and a narrative style that would have suited the '60s more, rounding off into an unexciting adventure for the viewers\". ==References== Category:2005 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Indian drama films Category:Films scored by Deva (composer) Category:2005 directorial debut films Category:2005 drama films ",
