    "text": "The Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC or The Heart) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the NAIA. Member institutions are located in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska in the United States. ==History== The HAAC's earliest ancestor was the Missouri College Athletic Union, which was formed in 1924 when the Missouri Intercollegiate Athletic Association (now the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association) split in two. The old MIAA's private schools formed the Athletic Union, while the state teachers' colleges stayed in the MIAA.MIAA It was reorganized as the HAAC in 1971 when it began admitting schools outside Missouri. However, the HAAC does not presently claim the Athletic Union's history as its own. In early 2014, Grand View University and William Penn University were announced as members for the 2015\u201316 school year. In April 2015, Clarke University and Mount Mercy University were also announced as members for the 2016\u201317 school year. In October 2019, Park University was approved for HAAC membership and joined in the 2020\u201321 school year. The current commissioner of the conference is Lori Thomas. Thomas, the first female commissioner in NAIA history, began her term in 2014, succeeding Larry Lady who retired after 22 years as commissioner. ==Member schools== ===Current members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Institution !Location !Founded !Type !Enrollment !Nickname !Joined |- !Baker University |Baldwin City, Kansas |1858 |Private/Methodist |989 |Wildcats |1971 |- !Benedictine College |Atchison, Kansas |1858 |Private/Catholic |2,189 |Ravens |1991 |- !Central Methodist University |Fayette, Missouri |1854 |Private/Methodist |1,094 |Eagles |1971; 1991 |- !Clarke University |Dubuque, Iowa |1843 |Private/Catholic |1,075 |Pride |2016 |- !Culver\u2013Stockton College |Canton, Missouri |1853 |Private/Disciples of Christ |1,066 |Wildcats |1980 |- !Evangel University |Springfield, Missouri |1955 |Private/Assemblies of God |1,958 |Crusaders |1987 |- !Graceland University |Lamoni, Iowa |1895 |Private/Community of Christ |2,301 |Yellowjackets |1971 |- !Grand View University |Des Moines, Iowa |1896 |Private/Lutheran (ELCA) |1,988 |Vikings |2015 |- !MidAmerica Nazarene University |Olathe, Kansas |1966 |Private/Nazarene |1,884 |Pioneers |1980 |- !Missouri Valley College |Marshall, Missouri |1889 |Private/Presbyterian |1,728 |Vikings |1971 |- !Mount Mercy University |Cedar Rapids, Iowa |1928 |Private/Catholic |1,877 |Mustangs |2016 |- !Park University |Parkville, Missouri |1875 |Private/Nonsectarian |2,340 |Pirates |2020 |- !Peru State College |Peru, Nebraska |1865 |Public |2,422 |Bobcats |2011 |- !William Penn University |Oskaloosa, Iowa |1873 |Private/Quakers |1,550 |Statesmen & Lady Statesmen |2015 |} ===Former members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Institution !Location !Founded !Nickname !Joined !Left !Current conference |- !Avila University |Kansas City, Missouri |1916 |Eagles |2000 |2018 |Kansas |- ! |Emporia, Kansas |1882 |Fighting Presbies |1971 |1974 |Closed in 1974 |- !Lindenwood University |St. Charles, Missouri |1827 |Lions |1996 |2011 |Great Lakes Valley (NCAA D-II) |- !Ottawa University |Ottawa, Kansas |1865 |Braves |1971 |1981 |Kansas |- !Tarkio College |Tarkio, Missouri |1883 |Owls |1971 |1992 |Closed in 1992 |- !William Jewell College |Liberty, Missouri |1849 |Cardinals |1971 |2011 |Great Lakes Valley (NCAA D-II) |} ===Membership timeline=== DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:1971 till:2023 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:5 left:5 bottom:50 top:5 Colors = id:line value:black id:Full value:rgb(0.7,0.9,0.8) # all sports id:FullxF value:rgb(0.9,0.8,0.7) # non-football id:AssocF value:rgb(0.9,0.7,0.8) # football-only PlotData = width:15 textcolor:darkblue shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:Full from:1971 till:end text:Baker (1971\u2013present) bar:2 color:Full from:1971 till:1986 text:Central Methodist (1971\u20131986) bar:2 color:Full from:1991 till:end text:(1991\u2013present) bar:3 color:Full from:1971 till:1974 text:College of Emporia (1971\u20131974) bar:4 color:Full from:1971 till:end text:Graceland (1971\u2013present) bar:5 color:Full from:1971 till:end text:Missouri Valley College (1971\u2013present) bar:6 color:Full from:1971 till:1981 text:Ottawa (1971\u20131981) bar:7 color:Full from:1971 till:1992 text:Tarkio College (1971\u20131992) bar:8 color:Full from:1971 till:2011 text:William Jewell College (1971\u20132011) bar:9 color:Full from:1980 till:end text:Culver\u2013Stockton College (1980\u2013present) bar:10 color:Full from:1980 till:end text:MidAmerica Nazarene (1980\u2013present) bar:11 color:Full from:1987 till:end text:Evangel (1987\u2013present) bar:12 color:Full from:1991 till:end text:Benedictine College (1991\u2013present) bar:13 color:Full from:1996 till:2011 text:Lindenwood (1996\u20132011) bar:14 color:FullxF from:2000 till:2001 text:Avila (2000\u20132018) bar:14 color:Full from:2001 till:2018 bar:15 color:Full from:2011 till:end text:Peru State College (2011\u2013present) bar:16 shift:(-10) color:Full from:2015 till:end text:Grand View (2015\u2013present) bar:17 shift:(-15) color:Full from:2015 till:end text:William Penn (2015\u2013present) bar:18 color:FullxF from:2016 till:2018 text:Clarke (2016\u2013present) bar:18 color:Full from:2018 till:end text: bar:19 shift:(-20) color:FullxF from:2016 till:end text:Mount Mercy (2016\u2013present) bar:20 color:FullxF from:2020 till:end text:Park (2020\u2013present) ScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:5 start:1972 TextData = fontsize:L textcolor:black pos:(0,25) tabs:(400-center) text:^\"Heart of America Athletic Conference membership history\" #> If the chart uses more than one bar color, add a legend by selecting the appropriate fields from the following three options (use only the colors that are used in the graphic.)
