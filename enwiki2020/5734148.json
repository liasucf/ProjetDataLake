Preview. Based on its prefix ab- (as in \"abhor\" or in \"abreaction\"), it represents a form of sexuality where someone is stimulated by moving away from sexuality or is moralistically opposed to sex. Betty Dodson defined the term as describing \"folks who get off complaining about sex and trying to censor porn.\"An interview with the Mother of Masturbation, Betty Dodson by Diane Walsh of Xtra! in Vancouver. Monday, April 30, 2007 absexuality is not an official psychiatric term; though note the mention of absexuality in a psychiatric manual in 1988, a decade before Carol Queen popularized the concept in feminist circles. Queen proposed inclusion of the concept in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5. Darrell Hamamoto sees Queen's view of absexuality as playfully broad: \"the current 'absexuality' embraced by many progressive and conservative critics of pornographic literature is itself a kind of 'kink' stemming from a compulsive need to impose their own sexual mores upon those whom they self-righteously condemn as benighted reprobates.\" == Development of SHARP == In 2000, Queen together with her partner Robert Morgan Lawrence published a jointly written essay in the Journal of Bisexuality detailing the role of San Francisco bisexuals in the development of safe sex strategies in response to the emerging AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Queen detailed her and Lawrence's development of a safe sex version of the SAR or Sexual Attitude Reassessment training, which they termed Sexual Health Attitude Restructuring Process or SHARP. Originally a program started by the IASHS, SHARP is described as a combination of \"lectures, films, videos, slides, and personal sharing\", as well as \"massage techniques, condom relay races, a blindfolded ritual known as the Sensorium which emphasized transformation and sensate focus, and much more.\" In 2007, Queen expressed the intention to revive the SHARP training, now referred to as SARP or Sexual Attitude Reassessment Process.' == Personal life == Queen is a Wiccan (Pagan).Sulak, John and V.
