The name of the village first appears on the \u201cV\u00e1lyi\u201d map from 1781. The word Maros derives from the Latin \"Mures\" word and means waterfront, village or fortress. By the end of 18th century the population of Kismaros reached about 200-250 persons. With the effort of all villagers the catholic church was finished in 1827. Agriculture specifically the cultivation of grapes and other fruits provided livelihood for most residents. At the beginning of the 20th century the most spoken language is German. ===\"Malenkiy robot\"=== After the Second World War the Soviets took control in Hungary. Although prior to the war most people of Kismaros claimed Hungarian ethnicity already, their German origin meant that in January 1945 eighty of Kismaros\u2019 youths (aged between 16-19) were taken by the Red Army to the Soviet Union, where they were subjected to forced labor in mines and factories.

Today's Kismaros is a busy suburban settlement of Budapest. Many of the locals work in the capital city, commuting every day by train or by car. After 1989 Kismaros became a hotspot for Budapesters trying to escape the hassles of city life; many of them settled down in the village permanently. Tourism plays an increasingly important role, providing jobs for local businesses. ==Demographics== According to the 2001 national census, Germans account for 6% of the population whereas over 90% claimed Hungarian ethnicity. About 3/4 of all residents are Roman Catholic. The population of the village has been growing constantly in the last decade reaching just over two thousand in 2009. ==Tourism== ===B\u00f6rzs\u00f6ny Hills' Children's Railway=== Kismaros is the southern terminus for one of Hungary\u2019s oldest light railways.
