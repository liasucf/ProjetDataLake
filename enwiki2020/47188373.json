Vancouver Sun, October 20, 1992. A school principal in Whitehorse,David Leyton-Brown, Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs 1992. University of Toronto Press, 1992. . p. 267. Th\u00e9riault had resided in Yukon for just eighteen months when he sought the leadership. Prior to moving to Yukon, he had been a Saskatchewan Liberal Party candidate in the 1986 provincial election in Saskatchewan. He became leader at a time when the party was moribund, as it was entirely shut out of the Legislative Assembly of Yukon in the 1989 election and had been effectively leaderless since the resignation of Jim McLachlan following that defeat. In the hopes of uniting to defeat the incumbent Yukon New Democratic Party government in the 1992 election, Th\u00e9riault entered coalition negotiations with John Ostashek's Yukon Party, but the negotiations failed. In the election campaign, Th\u00e9riault's Liberal platform included $22 million in spending cuts, the creation of a new government department of mines and energy, the splitting of the Yukon Development and Yukon Energy corporations, and a $30 million plan to improve sewage treatment. During the campaign, Th\u00e9riault faced controversy when it was revealed that he had once unsuccessfully sought a Progressive Conservative Party of Canada nomination, and had run for the presidency of the federal New Democratic Party.\"Grit leader admits party-go-round\". Edmonton Journal, October 15, 1992. The party won just one seat in the 1992 election, that of Jack Cable in the electoral district of Riverside. Th\u00e9riault himself was defeated in Riverdale South by Bea Firth.\"YUKON ELECTION: Voters return minority government\". Ottawa Citizen, October 20, 1992. He announced his resignation as party leader in his concession speech, and was succeeded by Cable. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Yukon Liberal Party leaders Category:Franco-Yukonnais people Category:Saskatchewan Liberal Party politicians Category:Candidates in Saskatchewan provincial elections Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
