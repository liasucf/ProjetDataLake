    "text": "The Mitchell Brothers were a Ghanaian British rap duo from London, England. They consisted of cousins Owura \"Tony\" Nyanin from Manor Park and Kofi \"Teddy\" Hanson from Stockwell. They were the first signing to Mike Skinner's The Beats imprint and are sometimes known as the \"Geezers with skills\". ==History== Tony Nyanin and Teddy Hanson named themselves The Mitchell Brothers after siblings Phil and Grant Mitchell in the British soap EastEnders. As teenagers, they pressed up 1,000 remix CDs called \u2018Sorted\u2019. Teddy Hanson spotted Mike Skinner from The Streets in their local Barclay's bank in Brixton, South London, soon after Skinner had released his debut album, Original Pirate Material. Hanson slipped a copy of his and Nyanin's demo CD into Skinner's bag, with his phone number on it. Skinner signed them to The Beats label and produced their first album. Hanson performed with Skinner on the latter's hit single, \"Fit But You Know It\". The Mitchell Brothers released their debut album, A Breath of Fresh Attire, on 22 August 2005. Their second album, Dressed For The Occasion, appeared on 19 November 2007. It was preceded by the singles, \"Solemate\" and \"Michael Jackson\", the latter of which is produced Scottish producer Calvin Harris. Sales for this album disappointed, with the Mitchell Brothers album being described as \"still born and fresh\" by Skinner. Most recently, Tony Nyanin signed to Paramount Music and is now pursuing a solo career as Mr Mitchell. Mr Mitchell's first solo single titled \"On The Rooftop\" was released in 2012. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Sorted (mixtape) (2004) * A Breath of Fresh Attire #56 - Silver BPI UK (2005) * Dressed For The Occasion (2007) * Beam Us Up Scotty (mixtape) (TBC) ===Singles=== A Breath of Fresh Attire * \"Routine Check\" (2004) UK #42 * \"Harvey Nicks\" (2004) UK #62 * \"Excuse My Brother\" (2005) UK #58 * \"Alone With The TV\" (2006) UK #92 * \"She's Got It All Wrong\" (2006) Dressed For The Occasion * \"SoleMate\" (2007) * \"Michael Jackson\" (2007) UK #65 ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Michael Jackson music video YouTube Category:English electronic music groups Category:English people of Ghanaian descent Category:Black British musical groups Category:English hip hop groups Category:Family musical groups Category:English musical duos Category:Hip hop duos Category:People from Manor Park, London Category:People from Stockwell ",
