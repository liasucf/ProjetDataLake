    "text": "In petroleum engineering, TEM (True Effective Mobility), also called TEM- function, is a criterion to characterize dynamic two-phase flow characteristics of rocks (or dynamic rock quality). TEM is a function of Relative permeability, Porosity, absolute Permeability and fluid Viscosity, and can be determined for each fluid phase separately. TEM-function has been derived from Darcy's law for multiphase flow. :TEM = \\frac{k k_{\\mathit{r}}}{\\phi \\mu} in which k is the absolute Permeability, kr is the Relative permeability, \u03c6 is the Porosity, and \u03bc is the fluid Viscosity. Rocks with better fluid dynamics (i.e., experiencing a lower pressure drop in conducting a fluid phase) have higher TEM versus saturation curves. Rocks with lower TEM versus saturation curves resemble low quality systems. TEM-function in analyzing Relative permeability data is analogous with Leverett J-function in analyzing Capillary pressure data. Furthermore, TEM-function in two-phase flow systems is extension of RQI (Rock Quality Index) for single-phase systems. Also, TEM-function can be used for averaging relative permeability curves (for each fluid phase, separately (i.e., water, oil, gas, CO2)). :\\text{Average kr} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nTEM_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\frac{k}{\\phi \\mu})_i} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\frac{k k_{\\mathit{r}}}{\\phi \\mu})_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\frac{k}{\\phi \\mu})_i} == References == Category:Petroleum engineering ",
