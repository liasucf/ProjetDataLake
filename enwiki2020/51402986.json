Ember was inspired by the 1992 video game Ultima VII: The Black Gate and has received pre-release comparisons to the Ultima series and to Baldur's Gate. The game was initially meant to release in 2014 and 2015, but has been pushed back in order to expand the game. ==Overview== Gameplay will take place in an open world, which players can freely explore. Players will start the game in a small dungeon, which they must escape to progress in the game. Once free, the user will play as a Lightbringer tasked with saving the game's world. They must also find a way to save the world's most valuable resource, embers, which can be used for their power, worn as jewelry, or set free, requiring morality based decision making. The game will feature a branching story, weapons-based skill system, and crafting. Combat will occur in real-time but can be paused, and the game is expected to take about 30 hours for players to complete. ==Reviews== In 2015 Time magazine called Ember one of their \"10 Most- Anticipated New iPhone Games\", based on the demo released by N-Fusion. ==References== ==External links== * * *Ember: N-Fusion & 505 Games Bring a High-Quality RPG to the Mobile Masses Category:2016 video games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Mobile games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games ",
