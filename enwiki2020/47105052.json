The soundtrack features six songs, the lyrics for which were written by Kabilan, Sean Roldan, Vivek, Karaikudi and Bharathi Ganesan. Behindwoods rated the album 2.5 out of 5 and called it \"An album laced with good energy and fun moments, but falls short of the expectations from a Sean Roldan fare.\" ==Critical reception== M. Suganth of The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, \"You could also call it Mundasupatti-meets-Rajathandhiram and you wouldn't be wrong as like that crime caper, it also about a gold heist that involves an elaborate set-up and planning. But the filmmaking is more Mundasupatti, with noticeable rough edges that keep reminding us that this is a first-timer's film and lacks the sophistication (it is an exposition-filled film) of both Soodhu Kavvum and Rajathandhiram.\" Baradwaj Rangan of the Hindu called it \"A shaky start, but lots of laughs later \" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2015 films Category:Indian films Category:2015 black comedy films Category:Indian black comedy films Category:Films scored by Sean Roldan Category:Films based on Indian novels Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:2015 directorial debut films ",
