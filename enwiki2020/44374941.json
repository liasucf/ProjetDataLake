    "text": "Lifted is the second solo album by Canadian country music artist Dallas Smith. It was released in Canada on November 25, 2014 via 604 Records. The album was available for pre-order on iTunes after the release of the single \"Wastin' Gas,\" which was released on October 28, 2014. In the United States, Lifted was instead released via Big Loud Mountain Records as a six-song EP containing only the material not released on previous EP, Tippin' Point, except for a live recording of the title track. ==Background== In the fall of 2013, Smith signed to American label Republic Nashville and opened for country music duo Florida Georgia Line (also on Republic Nashville) on their \"Here's to the Good Times\" Tour. The country duo helped write the album's lead single \"Tippin' Point,\" which would later be certified gold by Music Canada. Several songs from the album are featured on Smith's extended play Tippin' Point, Smith's first solo country work released in the US. The extended play sold 2,000 copies in its first week of release in the US. ==Singles== The album's first single \"Tippin' Point\" was released on October 8, 2013, which would later sell 100,000 digital copies in Canada. The album's second and third singles -- \"Slow Rollin'\" and \"A Girl Like You\" -- were later released in mid-2014 to moderate success on the Canadian Hot 100. The fourth single -- \"Wastin' Gas\" -- was released on October 28, 2014. It debuted at number 41 on the Canadian Hot 100, and sold 6,300 copies in its first week of release in the US. The single has received positive reviews, with Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal giving the song a 4.5 out of 5. It became Smith's first Canada Country leader in January 2015. \"Lifted\" and \"Cheap Seats\" were also released as singles in February and June 2015, respectively. ===Other songs=== \"Cheap Seats\" was released as the iTunes (Canada) free single of the week in promotion of the album for the week of November 25 to December 1, 2014. It was later serviced to radio as the sixth official single off the album. ==Track listing== ==Chart performance== ===Album/EP=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Chart (2014) !
