    "text": "Samuel Brown (1821\u20131886) was an American pioneer and politician. He was a member of the Oregon State Senate from 1866 to 1872. ==Early life== He was born in Pennsylvania and moved to Indiana and then Missouri, where he was married. He worked as a carpenter and cabinet maker. ==Migration to Oregon== In 1846, he and his family went by wagon train to the American West Coast. They accompanied Jesse Applegate on what became known as the Applegate Trail. He built a mill on the Feather River in California, and made $20,000 prospecting for gold. The family then moved to Oregon, and had the Sam Brown House built near present-day Gervais in 1857; the house is thought to be the first architect-designed house built in the state.. Brown's son, Sam H. Brown, also served in the Oregon Senate, and ran for governor of Oregon in 1934 and 1938. ==See also== * List of people from Oregon * List of people from Pennsylvania == References == Category:Oregon pioneers Category:Oregon state senators Category:1821 births Category:1886 deaths Category:People of the California Gold Rush Category:People from Gervais, Oregon Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing Category:19th-century American politicians ",
