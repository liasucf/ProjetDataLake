Monfils is well known for his athleticism and his court coverage, regularly using slides to retrieve balls, even on hard courts. His ability to go from defense to offense quickly can take his opponents by surprise. Monfils occasionally demonstrates that he is capable of generating tremendous pace on his groundstrokes off both wings, especially his forehand that can reach 190 km/h. He has garnered a reputation for showmanship and high-risk shotmaking throughout his career. Monfils uses a semi-western grip forehand and a combination of continental/semi-western on his backhand. Monfils possesses a strong, accurate serve capable of reaching 230 km/h, although his main focus is on consistency and placement, sometimes at the expense of power. == Equipment and apparel == Monfils was sponsored by Nike for clothes and shoes but changed to K-Swiss in 2010. In 2013 he switched to ASICS for clothes and shoes. Monfils was sponsored by Head for racquets but changed to Prince in 2009 and Wilson in 2012. His string of choice is the Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power 16L String. ==Personal life== Monfils is nicknamed \"La Monf\", or occasionally \"Sliderman\" due to his unusual sliding technique, especially on clay surfaces. He is of French-Caribbean heritage: his father, Rufin, a former football player employed as an agent for France Telecom, comes from the island of Guadeloupe. His mother, Sylvette, comes from the nearby island of Martinique and is a nurse. He has a younger brother, Daryl, who plays tennis. Ga\u00ebl and Daryl played doubles together in the 2012 Open Sud de France, losing in the first round. He was coached by countryman and former ATP pro Thierry Champion (since September 2004) but they parted company in September 2006. Nevertheless, Monfils' fitness trainer is still R\u00e9mi Barbarin. Monfils announced a partnership with a new coach, Tarik Benhabiles, in May 2007. However, for the 2008 season, Monfils hired Roger Rasheed as his coach. In 2011, Monfils parted ways with Rasheed and announced that his fitness coach, Patrick Chamagne would take the reins as his new full- time coach. That lasted until 2013. As of the 2015 French Open, Monfils shares coach Jan De Witt with fellow countryman Gilles Simon. On 15 November 2012, Monfils split with his coach. Monfils appeared in the music video for \"Hello\" by Martin Solveig and Dragonette. Monfils was considered an athletics prodigy at school and won the French under-13 and under-14 100m championships. It was only his love for tennis that stopped him going on to compete at a higher level. His coach is on record as saying that Monfils could have made the Olympic 100m final, such was his talent. In 2019 at the Australian Open, Monfils revealed that he was in a relationship with WTA player Elina Svitolina and was seen in her players box for her matches after he was eliminated from the tournament, as he subsequently was at Wimbledon. ==Career statistics== ===Grand Slam tournament performance timeline=== Current through the 2020 French Open. {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center;font-size:96% !
