    "text": "The United States secretary of health and human services is the head of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, concerned with health matters. The Secretary is a member of the president's Cabinet. The office was formerly Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. In 1980, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was renamed the Department of Health and Human Services, and its education functions and Rehabilitation Services Administration were transferred to the new Department of Education. Patricia Roberts Harris headed the department before and after it was renamed. Nominations to the office of Secretary of HHS are referred to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid, before confirmation is considered by the full United States Senate. Donald Trump selected then-Congressman Tom Price to be the 23rd secretary of the health and human services. Price was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 10, 2017 and resigned on September 29, 2017. Trump then named Don J. Wright, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health and Director of the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, as acting secretary until Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan was sworn in on October 10, 2017. On November 13, 2017, Trump nominated former pharmaceutical executive Alex Azar to fill the position permanently. Azar's confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee took place on January 9, 2018, and on January 24, 2018, Azar was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 55 to 43. Azar was sworn in on January 29, 2018.https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/alex-azar-sworn-in-as-secretary- of-health-and-human- services/2018/01/29/8257006e-0514-11e8-aa61-f3391373867e_story.html From 2012 to 2017, Azar was president of the U.S. division of Eli Lilly and Company, a major drug company, and a member of the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a large pharmaceutical lobby. ==Duties== The flag of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the predecessor to the current office. The duties of the secretary revolve around human conditions and concerns in the United States. This includes advising the president on matters of health, welfare, and income security programs. The secretary strives to administer the Department of Health and Human Services to carry out approved programs and make the public aware of the objectives of the department. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) was reorganized into a Department of Education and a Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS). The Department of Health and Human Services oversees 11 agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). ==List of secretaries of health and human services== ; Parties (8) (15) (1) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |colspan=8 | ===Secretaries of Health, Education, and Welfare=== |- !No. !Portrait !Name !State of residence !Took office !Left office !colspan=2 |President(s) |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |75px |Oveta Culp Hobby |Texas |April 11, 1953 |July 31, 1955 | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: ;\" | | rowspan=\"3\" |Dwight D.
