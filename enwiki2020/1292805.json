    "text": "Songs of Faith and Devotion Live is the second live album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode. It was released on 6 December 1993 by Mute Records. Recorded during the band's 1993 Devotional Tour, the album consists mainly of performances recorded in Li\u00e9vin, France, with two other tracks recorded in Copenhagen and New Orleans, respectively. It was a track-by-track live duplication of Depeche Mode's eighth studio album, Songs of Faith and Devotion, which was released earlier in 1993. The album was poorly received by critics and performed moderately on the charts, reaching number 46 on the UK Albums Chart and number 193 on the US Billboard 200. As of April 2006, it had sold 114,000 copies in the United States. A near-complete concert of the Devotional Tour was released on the Devotional video album in 1993, and attained more commercial success. ==Critical reception== In comparison to Songs of Faith and Devotion, Songs and Faith and Devotion Live received less acclaim from music critics; AllMusic rated the album two stars out of five. The A.V. Club rated Songs of Faith and Devotion Live as the \"Least Essential Live Album\" of the 1990s, saying, \"Depeche Mode has plugged in plenty of DAT and drum machines during its live performances, thereby allowing the band to crank out note-perfect versions of its studio hits. Featuring every track on Songs Of Faith And Devotion, played live and in order, the album's live counterpart is monumentally unnecessary.\" In the same feature, the album was listed as one of ten nominees for \"Least Essential Album\" of the decade with the comment, \"It's not like Depeche Mode is inclined to rely on radical instrumental improvisation live.\" ==Track listing== Notes * All tracks were recorded live at Stade Couvert R\u00e9gional in Li\u00e9vin, France, on 29 July 1993, except \"Get Right with Me\", recorded at Forum Copenhagen in Copenhagen on 27 May 1993, and \"One Caress\", recorded at Lakefront Arena in New Orleans on 8 October 1993. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Songs of Faith and Devotion Live. ===Depeche Mode=== * Alan Wilder * Martin Gore * David Gahan * Andy Fletcher ===Additional musicians=== * Hildia Campbell \u2013 backing vocals * Samantha Smith \u2013 backing vocals ===Technical=== * Alan Wilder \u2013 production, mixing * Steve Lyon \u2013 production, mixing, recording * Peter Brandt \u2013 recording assistance * Rob Kirwan \u2013 mixing assistance * Alex Firla \u2013 mixing assistance * Jeremy Wheatley \u2013 mixing assistance * Kevin Metcalfe \u2013 mastering * JD Fanger \u2013 album coordination * Daryl Bamonte \u2013 album coordination * Pepe Jansz \u2013 album coordination ===Artwork=== * Anton Corbijn \u2013 visuals, art direction, sleeve design * Area \u2013 sleeve design ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993\u201394) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| European Albums (Music & Media) | 70 |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Album information from the official Depeche Mode website Category:1993 live albums Category:Depeche Mode live albums Category:Mute Records live albums es:Songs of Faith and Devotion#Edici\u00f3n en concierto ",
