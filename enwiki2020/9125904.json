    "text": "Muriel Gustavo Becker (born 14 February 1987), simply known as Muriel, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Fluminense. ==Career== ===Internacional=== In 2009, Muriel was loaned by Internacional to Caxias and Portuguesa. He won the 2010 Copa FGF with the Internacional B side. On 23 May 2011, he joined S\u00e9rie B club Portuguesa for a second loan spell, but the contract was rescinded. In July 2016, he was loaned to another second-tier team, Bahia. ===Belenenses=== On 13 June 2017, Muriel moved abroad for the first time, signing for C.F. Os Belenenses of the Portuguese Primeira Liga on a two-year deal. Sixteen days later he made his debut in the first round of the Ta\u00e7a da Liga in a 1\u20130 home loss to Real SC, though the result was revoked in his team's favour as the opponents had fielded the suspended Abou Tour\u00e9. In his first league game, the side from Lisbon lost by the same score at Rio Ave F.C. on 7 August. In Muriel's second season in Bel\u00e9m, with the team now spun off as Belenenses SAD, he was an ever-present for the first 32 league matches, including a 2\u20130 home win over eventual champions S.L. Benfica on 27 October 2018. In his final game for the club on 5 May 2019, he gifted city rivals Sporting CP the opening goal by giving the ball to Raphinha, he then fouled the same played in the 21st minute and was sent off in an 8\u20131 loss. ===Fluminense=== On 5 July 2019, Muriel returned to Brazil's top flight, signing a 3 and a half year deal with Fluminense. He made his debut on 24 July in the last 16 first leg of the 2019 Copa Sudamericana, a 2\u20131 win away to Pe\u00f1arol. Four days later, in his first S\u00e9rie A match for the club, he made an error in a 2\u20131 home loss to S\u00e3o Paulo at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. In his debut Campeonato Carioca season, Becker reached the final with Fluminense, losing 3\u20131 on aggregate to rivals Flamengo in July 2020. ==Style of play== Becker is known for his speed and timing when rushing off his line. ==Personal life== Muriel's younger brother, Alisson, is also a professional footballer and a goalkeeper for Premier League club Liverpool and the Brazil national team. He was his teammate at Internacional. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"8\"|Internacional |2010 |rowspan=\"7\"|S\u00e9rie A |1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0||3Appearance(s) in Campeonato Ga\u00facho.||0||4||0 |- |2011 |34||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0||8Two appearances in Recopa Sudamericana, six appearances in Campeonato Ga\u00facho.||0||42||0 |- |2012 |38||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||10Appearance(s) in Copa Libertadores.||0||18||0||66||0 |- |2013 |32||0||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||17||0||56||0 |- |2014 |1||0||0||0||0||0||7||0||8||0 |- |2015 |13||0||0||0||0||0||4||0||17||0 |- |2016 |3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||2One appearance in Campeonato Ga\u00facho, one appearance in Primeira Liga.||0||5||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !122!!0!!7!!0!!10!!0!!59!!0!!198!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Caxias (loan) |2009 |rowspan=\"1\"|S\u00e9rie C |10||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||8Appearance(s) in Campeonato Ga\u00facho.||0||18||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Portuguesa (loan) |2009 |rowspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie B |16||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||16||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Bahia (loan) |2016 |22||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||22||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Belenenses SAD |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primeira Liga |17||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||18||0 |- |2018\u201319 |32||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||33||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !49!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!51!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Fluminense |2019 |rowspan=\"1\"|S\u00e9rie A |20||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||4Appearance(s) in Copa Sudamericana.||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||24||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !239!!0!!9!!0!!14!!0!!67!!0!!329!!0 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Novo Hamburgo Category:Brazilian people of German descent Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Portugal Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:Sport Club Internacional players Category:Sociedade Esportiva e Recreativa Caxias do Sul players Category:Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Desportos players Category:Esporte Clube Bahia players Category:C.F.
