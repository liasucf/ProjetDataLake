    "text": "The 1982 UEFA European Under-21 Championship was the 3rd staging of the UEFA European Under-21 Championship. The qualifying stage spanned two years (1980\u201382) and had 26 entrants. West Germany competed in the competition for the first time. England U-21s won the competition. The 26 national teams were divided into eight groups (six groups of 3 + two groups of 4). The group winners played off against each other on a two-legged home-and-away basis until the winner was decided. There was no 3rd-place playoff. == Qualifying stage == ===Draw=== The allocation of teams into qualifying groups was based on that of 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification with several changes, reflecting the absence of some nations: * Group 1 did not include Albania * Group 2 did not include Netherlands (moved to Group 8) and Republic of Ireland * Group 3 did not include Wales and Iceland * Group 4 did not include Norway (moved to Group 7) * Group 5 did not include Denmark (moved to Group 6) and Luxembourg (moved to Group 8) * Group 6 did not include Portugal, Northern Ireland and Israel, but included Denmark (moved from Group 5) * Group 7 did not include Malta, but included Norway (moved from Group 4) * Group 8 composed of Netherlands (moved from Group 2), Luxembourg (moved from Group 5) and Spain (who did not participate in World Cup qualification) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Qualifying Group 1 |- ! scope=\"col\" | Standing ! scope=\"col\" | Country ! scope=\"col\" | P ! scope=\"col\" | W ! scope=\"col\" | D ! scope=\"col\" | L ! scope=\"col\" | F ! scope=\"col\" | A ! scope=\"col\" | Pts |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |1 | style=\"text-align: left\" | '''''' |6 |5 |0 |1 |15 |5 |10 |- |2 | style=\"text-align: left\" | |6 |5 |0 |1 |7 |5 |10 |- |3 | style=\"text-align: left\" | |6 |1 |1 |4 |3 |9 |3 |- |4 | style=\"text-align: left\" | |6 |0 |1 |5 |4 |10 |1 |} * Finland 0-1 Bulgaria * Finland 1-2 Austria * Bulgaria 1-0 W.Germany * W.
