(or simply Bowring) was a Canadian operator of retail stores, mostly focused on gifts and home decor, throughout Canada. Bowring was formed in 1811 as a private company by Benjamin Bowring and his family, who had just moved to St. John's, Newfoundland. Benjamin Bowring, an English clockmaker, set up shop in that business, while his wife Charlotte established a dry goods store which evolved into a large department store on Water Street.Bowring - About Flag of Bowring Brothers Bowring Brothers was later engaged as a shipowner, fish and general merchant, and steamship agent. In the late 19th century, the Bowring Brothers chartered the ship Nelly, captained by Robert Austin Sheppard (1865\u20131909), to carry fish to ports in Pernambuco, Brazil and Sydney, New South Wales. The Bowring Brothers ran the Red Cross Line of steamships around Newfoundland and Labrador. In particular, the SS Florizel was one of the first passenger ships in the world specifically designed to navigate icy waters, useful also for seal hunting. Most famously, the Florizel was converted into a troopship and in October 1914 carried the first 540 volunteers of the Newfoundland Regiment into World War I. The numerous vessels owned by the Bowring family between 1818\u20131937 were cataloged by Arthur Wardle. From 1811 to date Bowring Brothers has been continuously engaged in Newfoundland's commerce, and at its peak the company had various operations on a global scale. After World War II, the company focused on its retail business, including the department store in St. John's and a chain of over 100 gift shops in shopping malls across Canada and the US.Bowring, Derrick (2015). Down to Bowring's: A Memoir. Creative Publishers. p. 133. The Bowring family sold the chain to new owners in the late 1980s or early 1990s, following which the St. John's store closed, leaving Bowring without any retail presence in the province for over a decade. In the early 2000s, Bowring began to shift its energy towards a series of \"home stores\" in power centres across Canada, currently numbering 34\u2014including one in St. John's\u2014but continues to operate 31 mall stores in larger centres. Fred Benitah, owner and chief executive officer of the privately owned home-goods retailer Benix & Company, Inc. (based in Toronto, Ontario), purchased the insolvent Bowring Brothers chain in October 2005. Fred Benitah and his brother Isaac Benitah together privately controlled a number of retailers including Fairweather, International Clothiers and Benix & Co. After U.S. retailer Bombay Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 20, 2007, the U.S. business operations and inventory were acquired by a joint venture of Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLC, and Hilco Merchant Resources, LLC, on October 12, 2007 (with a plan to liquidate Bombay's U.S. stores) while Bombay's Canadian operations (after inventory disposition) were acquired by Bowring and Benix & Company. On November 6, 2018, Fluid Brands Inc (which supplies for Bowring and The Bombay Company) and is owned by retail mogul, Fred Benitah, claimed insolvency. They obtained protection from creditors under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. According to documents, Fluid Brands Inc is 50 million in debt. As of November 2018, both Bowring and The Bombay Company have shut down all supplier websites and are in liquidation process. As of January 2019 all Bowring and Bombay stores are closed. ==See also== *Bowring Park (St. John's), a park built on land donated by the company *Bowring Downtown Centre, an office complex redeveloped from the former Bowring department store in St. John's ==References== ==External links== Category:Defunct companies of Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Privately held companies of Canada Category:Home decor retailers Category:Retail companies established in 1811 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2019 Category:Companies based in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Defunct shipping companies of Canada Category:1811 establishments in Newfoundland Category:2019 disestablishments in Newfoundland and Labrador ",
