    "text": "Calmodulin 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CALM1 gene. == Function == Calmodulin 1 is the archetype of the family of calcium-modulated (calmodulin) proteins of which nearly 20 members have been found. They are identified by their occurrence in the cytosol or on membranes facing the cytosol and by a high affinity for calcium. Calmodulin contains 148 amino acids and has 4 calcium-binding EF hand motifs. Its functions include roles in growth and the cell cycle as well as in signal transduction and the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters. == Interactions == Calmodulin 1 has been shown to interact with: * AKAP9, * Androgen receptor, * IQGAP1, * PPEF1, and * TRPV1. == References == == Further reading == * * * * == External links == *UniProt entry Category:EF-hand-containing proteins ",
