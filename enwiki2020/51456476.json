A fourth cross is in the river. According to legend, Columba was stealing the cross, was caught by Ciar\u00e1n and quickly dumped the cross in the river. They are called termon crosses (from the Irish tearmann, \"border\") which marked the s\u0101nctissimus, the holiest part of the monastery around the church.
