The Fitch family once owned land in this area of the Firelands section of the historic Connecticut Western Reserve. Early on November 23, 1963, a fire killed 63 people in the Golden Age Nursing Home, one mile north of Fitchville due to overloaded electrical wiring. National media attention was diverted from the incident by the assassination of President Kennedy, which had taken place 15 hours earlier. The tragedy led to improvements in fire safety building codes.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM6V5P_Golden_Age_Nursing_Home_Fitchville_OH ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Huron County, Ohio Category:Unincorporated communities in Ohio ",
