He was not one of the greatest wrestlers of his time, but received the licence because he had influential backers. \u014czeki Tsurugizan Taniemon reportedly handed over the yokozuna licence to Hidenoyama. ==Retirement from sumo== After his retirement, he was an elder known as Hidenoyama and produced later yokozuna Jinmaku. He served as a judge (naka- aratame, modern shimpan) but this gave him many opportunities to give favourable decisions to his own pupils. At that time, there were many lower division wrestlers and they were sometimes forced to be absent from sumo bouts. They attempted to have their number of sumo bouts increased. He had the right of deciding their attendances and rejected this, excluding his own pupils.

He eventually apologized to them. == Top division record == *The actual time the tournaments were held during the year in this period often varied. *Championships for the best record in a tournament were not recognized or awarded before the 1909 summer tournament and the above unofficial championships are historically conferred.
