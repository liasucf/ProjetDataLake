    "text": "Arlene Rush (born 1955) is a New York City-based multidisciplinary artist. Initially she created abstract metal sculptures, with her practice evolving to incorporate more conceptual work tackling gender and identity. Her current work centers on themes around gender, identity, socioeconomics, and politics, examining issues that impact the contemporary world. ==Biography== Rush grew up in The Bronx and graduated from Queens College where she studied sculpture. Her career began in the Chelsea district of Manhattan. Her early welded steel abstract sculptures were influenced by Anthony Caro. In 1991, Rush\u2019s practice was stirred by Buddhism, which led to an incorporation of philosophical ideas in her artwork. In 2000, Rush developed a series of works commenting on gender roles and societal norms. As Rush began archiving her career in 2014, she started making work addressing the effects of the art market, gentrification, class warfare, gender bias, and other kinds of discrimination. This is portrayed in her series \u201cEvidence of Being\u201d (2014-present), which questions what constitutes success and what she describes as the importance and nature of being an artist working in the face of bias. == Exhibitions and Collections == Arlene Rush is represented by Arcilesi Homberg Fine Arts. Her work is exhibited in galleries and museums throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. She is in numerous public and private collections including Mount Sinai Cancer Center, New York, NY; Joe Baio, New York, NY; Pavel Zoubok, Pavel Zoubok Gallery, New York, NY; MOMA, Wales, UK; MUBE, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Mark Golden, GOLDEN Artist Paint, Berlin, NY; Robert H. Chaney, Houston, TX; ARCO Chemical, Newton Square, PA; The Center for Emerging Visual Artists, Philadelphia, PA; and Library of Congress, Great Hall, Thomas Jefferson Bldg., Washington, DC. She supports gender, health, and social issues, through participating in Visual AIDS\u2019 \"Postcards from the Edge\" annually since 1998. The Center for Emerging Visual Artists granted her a residency in 1988 to Barcelona, Spain and in 2011, she was awarded the Pat Hearn & Colin De Land Foundation Grant. == References== == External links == * Official Website of Arlene Rush Category:American multimedia artists Category:American installation artists Category:American women artists Category:American contemporary artists Category:Installation artists Category:Artists from New York (state) Category:1955 births Category:Living people ",
