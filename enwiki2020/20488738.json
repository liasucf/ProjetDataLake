She also attended Harvard University but did not receive a degree. She is fluent in Spanish. ==Political career== From 1988 to 1991, Touraine was an advisor to Prime Minister Michel Rocard on geostrategic issues. Touraine served as a member of the National Assembly of France for Indre-et-Loire (3rd constituency) from 1997 to 2002 for the Socialiste, radical, citoyen et divers gauche political party. She was defeated in the second round of the 2002 elections by Jean-Jacques Descamps (UMP). She regained the district in the 2007 elections with a small majority (50.22%), and served until 2012. On the regional level, Touraine has been counselor general for Indre-et-Loire since the 2001 elections. She served as Vice-President of the General Council of Indre-et-Loire from 2008 to 2011, and as its President from 2011 to 2012, when she resigned.

In the French presidential election, Touraine endorsed Dominique Strauss-Kahn before later supporting Hollande. ===Minister of Health and Social Affairs=== On 16 May 2012, Touraine was named by Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault as Minister of Health and Social Affairs. The designation was accepted by President of France Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in line with tradition. In her ministerial post, she worked to improve HIV/AIDS prevention and early diagnosis, promoted universal hepatitis C treatment with innovative drugs, implemented plain tobacco packaging and launched a nutrition labelling system.Former French Minister of Social Affairs, Health and Women\u2019s Rights Marisol Touraine elected chair of the Unitaid Executive Board Unitaid, press release of June 6, 2019. In October 2012, Touraine announced that trial centres could open in 2012 in France for drug addicts to safely inject their own drugs. This measure met with criticism coming from both the opposition and members of the majority. She entered into negotiations with doctors and health insurance professional organisations to limit the prices of medical assistance.Drug 'shooting galleries' to be tested by France, France24 During her time in office, Touraine oversaw a 2013 pension reform which gradually extended the mandatory pay-in period from 41.5 years to 43 by 2035 and required workers, retirees and employers to fill in an annual deficit set otherwise to reach 20 billion euros ($26 billion) in 2020.Hugh Carnegy (June 6, 2012), Hollande restores right to retire at 60 Financial Times.Catherine Bremer and Emmanuel Jarry (September 2, 2013), France says pension reform enough for several years Reuters.

By the end of her term, Touraine was widely expected to join her party\u2019s presidential primaries in 2017; she eventually decided not to run for president. When Prime Minister Valls declared that he would seek the Socialist Party\u2019s nomination and quit the government to focus on campaigning, Touraine was seen by news media as possible choice to replace him and lead what would effectively become a caretaker government; instead, the post went to Bernard Cazeneuve.Christian Hartmann (December 5, 2016), French PM Valls launches presidential bid, quits government Reuters.
