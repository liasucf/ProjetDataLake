    "text": "False White Mountain is a mountain, in the northern part of Yosemite National Park. It is the 24th highest mountain, in Yosemite National Park. False White Mountain can be climbed, as a day hike, from Tioga Pass. False White Mountain is near Mount Conness, Tioga Peak, Mount Dana, and Lembert Dome, thus is in the Tuolumne Meadows area. Of importance, False White Mountain has been often confused with White Mountain, thus the \"false\" reference. There have been proposals, to re-name False White Mountain, as Peak 12,002, Sharsmith Peak, False White, and False White Mountain Peak. ==References== Category:Mountains of Yosemite National Park Category:Mountains of Madera County, California Category:Landforms of Yosemite National Park ",
