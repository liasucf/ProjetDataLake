In June 2008 the Cardiff Lions travelled to Dublin for the 4th biennial Bingham Cup hosted magnificently by the Emerald Warriors. The structure of the competition and seedings put the Lions in the lower tier and competing for either the second tier Plate, third tier Bowl or fourth tier Shield. A travelling squad of 23 players and 6 support staff made a vast improvement on the previous Bingham Cup results: Friday 13 June Game 1, Cardiff Lions 41 Phoenix Storm 10 Game 2, Cardiff Lions 36 Copenhagen Scrum 0 Saturday 14 June Game 3, Cardiff Lions 56 Manchester Village Spartans 2nds 0 Plate/Bowl decider, Cardiff Lions 31 Atlanta Bucks 0 Sunday 15 June Quarter Final Plate, Cardiff Lions 21 Emerald Warriors 19 Semi Final Plate, Cardiff Lions 5 Sydney Convicts 2nds 27 These results left the Cardiff Lions in 3rd place in the Plate competition after winning the 3rd/4th play-off boat race at the closing ceremony against San Francisco Fog RFC 2nds. A huge improvement on the previous Bingham Cup and with a lot more teams taking part (32 from around the world). ==The future== Next up for the club will be the Hadrian Cup in February. This is the annual 10's competition hosted by The Newcastle Ravens. The club also has ambitions to expand and improve the squad, developing links with local clubs. ==See also== ==References== Category:International Gay Rugby member clubs Category:Welsh rugby union teams ",
