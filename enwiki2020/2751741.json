The company was incorporated in 2004 and opened its first hotel in 2005. easyHotel has 40 hotels worldwide. Locations include, UK, Switzerland, Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Hungary, Portugal, Bulgaria and UAE. ==History== Originally founded by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou through easyGroup Holdings Ltd, easyHotel was incorporated in 2004 and opened its first hotel in South Kensington, London in 2005. Whilst easyHotel owned its first hotel in South Kensington (which was subsequently sold and franchised in 2007), its growth strategy in its early years was to expand via franchise contracts. In 2007, Easygroup signed with Dubai-state-owned Istithmar Hotels for Istithmar to invest US$400mn in five years to build 38/3800 Easy hotels/rooms in Africa, Middle East and parts of Asia. Dubai opened in 2010; nothing since. Later in 2007, Easyhotel signed a master franchise agreement with Germany-based Igen Hotels, planning 60 franchised EHs in Europe (outside the UK) in three years, of which about 10 were expected in Germany. 2007 saw the first three international franchise hotels open in Basel, Budapest and Zurich along with two further hotels in London, at Earl\u2019s Court and Victoria. 2008 marked easyHotel\u2019s expansion with the opening of hotels near Luton and Heathrow airports as well as in London Paddington. Between 2010 and 2014, the Company continued to expand its portfolio through franchise partnerships with new openings in Scotland, Germany and The Netherlands. The group also acquired two London based hotels in Old Street (2012) and Croydon (2014). In June 2014, the Company floated on the London Stock Exchange raising \u00a324.5m to fund further growth and expansion. In August 2019 directors of the company backed a \u00a3139 million bid for the company in August despite opposition from founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. The bidding consortium is made up of Luxembourg-based ICAMAP and Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge of Canada. Ivanhoe is owned by Quebec\u2019s pension company, CDPQ (Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec). ==Operations== As of October 2019, easyHotel has: * Thirteen corporately-owned hotels currently comprising 1,300 rooms in Old Street (London), Glasgow, Croydon, Birmingham, Manchester, Milton Keynes, Liverpool, Newcastle, Sheffield, Leeds, Ipswich, Barcelona (Spain) and Nice (France). * Twenty seven franchised hotels with 2,136 rooms in Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, UAE, and the United Kingdom. ==References== ==External links== * Category:easyGroup Category:Hotel and leisure companies based in London Category:Hotel chains Category:Hotel chains in the United Kingdom ",
