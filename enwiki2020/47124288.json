    "text": "Thilawa Special Economic Zone (; abbreviated Thilawa SEZ) is a special economic zone being developed in Kyauktan and Thanlyin Townships, south of Yangon city. The first phase of the SEZ is slated to complete in 2016, but was launched at the end of September 2015. The project was announced in January 2011. Thilawa SEZ is being developed by a joint venture, initially between the Japan External Trade Organization and the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The Burmese and Japanese governments established a consortium including Japan Thilawa SEZ Company (backed by Mitsubishi, Marubeni and Sumitomo corporations), Myanmar Thilawa SEZ Holdings, Thilawa SEZ management committee and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on 29 October 2013 to proceed with development. Construction on the $3.28 billion project began in May 2014. The current Chairman of Thilawa Special Economic Zone's Management Committee is Winston Set Aung. ==See also== *Special economic zone *Economy of Burma ==External links== *Official website ==References== Category:Special economic zones Category:Economy of Myanmar Category:Yangon Region Category:Japan International Cooperation Agency Category:Economy of Yangon ",
