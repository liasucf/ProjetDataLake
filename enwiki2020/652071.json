    "text": "Ferm\u00edn Alexis Infante Carpio (born December 4, 1961) is a former Venezuelan professional baseball utility infielder. Listed at 5' 10\", 175 lb., he batted and threw right handed. Born in Barquisimeto, Lara, Infante played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Atlanta Braves in a span of four seasons from 1987\u20131990. In the 1980s, the Blue Jays called Infante its best defensive shortstop in the American League next to Chicago's Ozzie Guill\u00e9n. Infante had exceptional range and enough arm to make a throw from the hole, but he was unable to help himself with the bat. In a four-season career, Infante was mostly used as a late-inning defense replacement as well as a pinch runner. He posted a .109 batting average with 11 runs scored and one stolen base without home runs or RBI in 60 game appearances. Besides, Infante spent ten seasons in the Toronto and Atlanta minor league systems between 1982 and 1996, compiling a .255 average with 12 homers and 249 RBI in 880 games. In between, he played and managed for the Olmecas de Tabasco in the Mexican League, and played winter ball for the Cardenales de Lara club of the Venezuelan League. After his playing days, Infante managed the Dominican Summer League Rangers and also has coached for a long time in his native country for the Cardenales. == See also== * List of players from Venezuela in Major League Baseball ==External links== *, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League) Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Florence Blue Jays players Category:Gulf Coast Blue Jays players Category:Knoxville Blue Jays players Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Major League Baseball players from Venezuela Category:Mexican League baseball players Category:Mexican League baseball managers Category:Minor league baseball coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Olmecas de Tabasco players Category:Sportspeople from Barquisimeto Category:Richmond Braves players Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:Venezuelan baseball coaches Category:Venezuelan expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Venezuelan expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:Venezuelan expatriate baseball players in the United States ",
