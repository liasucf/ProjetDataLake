Barbuda later received his strange name for the \"beards\" of lichens that adorned his palm trees. The first European attempts to settle on the islands failed due to the excellent defenses of the Caribs. The island was first colonized by the Spaniards, but soon passed to the Buccaneers. == Diplomatic relations == Spain established diplomatic relations with Antigua and Barbuda in 1988. The Spanish Embassy in Kingston is accredited before the old government. The Ambassador of Spain to Antigua and Barbuda, An\u00edbal Jim\u00e9nez Abascal, presented credentials to the Governor General of Antigua and Barbuda in September 2014.

In the field of Health, Antigua has been a beneficiary of a Project for the Prevention and Control of Cervical Cancer, in which the Mount St John's Medical Center received a donation of a colposcope in January 2010.
