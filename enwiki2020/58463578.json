These geographic areas contain either the drainage area of a major river, or the combined drainage areas of a series of rivers. The Tennessee region, which is listed with a 2-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) of 06, has an approximate size of , and consists of 4 subregions, which are listed with the 4-digit HUCs 0601 through 0604. This region includes the drainage of the Tennessee River Basin. Includes parts of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.
