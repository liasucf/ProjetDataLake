    "text": "Salario is the 4th quarter of Rome (Italy), identified with the initials Q. IV. The toponym also indicates the Urban Zone 2D of the Municipio II of Rome Capital. It takes its name from the Via Salaria and is the smallest quarter of Rome. == Geography == It is located in the northern area of the city, close to the Aurelian Walls. The territory of the quartiere includes the urban zone 2D Salario. ===Boundaries=== The quarter borders: * to the north-east, with the quarter Q. XVII Trieste along the stretch of Viale Regina Margherita between Via Salaria and Via Nomentana. * to the east, with the quarter Q. V Nomentano along the stretch of Via Nomentana between Viale Regina Margherita and Piazzale di Porta Pia. * to the south, with the rione R.

Odonyms of the quartiere can be categorized as follows: * Cities, e.g. Piazza and Via Alessandria, Via Ancona, Via Bergamo, Via Brescia, Via Cagliari, Piazza Fiume, Via Nizza, Via Rieti, Via Viterbo, Via Velletri; * Fallen in the Capture of Rome, e.g. Via Cesare Bosi, Via Giacomo Pagliari, Via Cesare Paoletti, Via Andrea Ripa; * Local names, e.g. Via di Villa Albani, Via Nomentana, Via Salaria; * Rivers, e.g. Via Adda, Via Basento, Via Metauro, Via Ofanto, Via Po, Via Simeto, Via Tirso, Via Trebbia. == History == \"The gardens of the Villa Albani\" by Edward Lear, 1840. Salario is among the first 15 quartieri born in 1911 and officially established in 1921. In 1926 it was reduced following the establishment of the Quarter Q. XVII Savoia (currently Trieste). The territory immediately outside Porta Pia remained a rural area until the end of the 19th century, like all the areas outside the Aurelian walls then known as \"suburbia\". The area, crossed by Via Nomentana and Via Salaria, which originate from there, hosted hunting lodges and country residences since the 18th century, such as Villa Albani \u2013 still existing today and whose park occupies a good quarter of the territory \u2013 and Villa Patrizi (in the quarter Nomentano). The latter stood immediately outside Porta Pia and was sacrificed to the needs of urban expansion of Rome after the unification of Italy. The site is now occupied by the Ministry of Transport. The first building activities on the new allotments outside the Aurelian walls began outside Porta Pia and Porta Salaria as early as the last two decades of the 19th century. However, it was only in 1911 that the city administration sanctioned the birth of the new quarters, making them official in 1921. The area of the quarter Salario was included within the territory defined by Porta Pia and Porta Salaria up to the bridge over the Aniene and the left bank of the same river. This territorial delimitation was then revised in 1926 with the establishment of the quarter Savoia (the current quarter Trieste), which included all the areas beyond the current Viale Regina Margherita, thus reducing in a relevant way the area of the quarter Salario. === Coat of arms === Azure, argent pale with or rising sunCarlo Pietrangeli (see Bibliography), p. 192.. == Monuments and places of interest == The market hall in Via Alessandria === Civil buildings === * Former Peroni brewery. 19th-century complex of buildings (1864). : A complex of three lots of buildings distributed between Via Nizza and Via Alessandria.
