Sotuta means \"swirling waters\" and is said to be synonymous with Nach Cocom who led the Maya opposition to the Spanish conquistadors. Nach did not like to work with white colonialist and in 1535 he had slayed the heads of a group of Xiu nobles which ultimately caused his own downfall. In 1542 he had recorded victory over the Montejos at the battle at Tiho and came back to Sotuta but the Spanish army captured the territory within the year. Nach had then agreed to a truce. He again ventured to fight the Spaniards in 1546 but faced defeat and accepted a truce. His baptized name was Juan Cocom when he converted to Christianity. However, in 1562 when two young girls were crucified in the church he was incarcerated and deprived of all his benefits and his brother who was questioned also committed suicide. Following this incident, the friars faced the ire of the local people and as a result the clergy was made secular and the Franciscan control of the mission was annulled. After the conquest the area became part of the encomienda system. The first known encomenderos date from 1549 and were Gonzalo M\u00e9ndez and Juan Maga\u00f1a. By 1607, the estate had passed to Gonzalo Maga\u00f1a and Diego de Maga\u00f1a en 1607 and by 1652 acting encomenderos were Francisco de Maga\u00f1a and Alfonso Hern\u00e1ndez. Yucat\u00e1n declared its independence from the Spanish Crown in 1821 and in 1825, the area was assigned to the Beneficios Bajos region with its headquarters in Sotuta. ==Governance== The municipal president is elected for a three-year term.
