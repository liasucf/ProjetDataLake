    "text": "Trypanosoma suis is a species of excavate trypanosome in the genus Trypanosoma that causes one form of the surra disease in animals. It infects pigs. It does not infect humans.Molecular Parasitology Group ==Discovery== Trypanosoma suis was first encountered and described by Ochmann in 1905. He found the parasite in a herd of sick pig in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. Hence the name as the word suis means pig. Eventually it was lost in consecutive renaming of the parasite until the 1950s. ==Rediscovered== In the 1950s Trypanosoma suis is rediscovered in Burundi by two Belgian researchers.Wild Pigs as Hosts of Glossina vanhoofi Henrard and Trypanosoma suis Ochmann in the Central African Forest Trypanosomas suis remains the most rare member of the Salivarian trypanosomes. The only isolated specimen known of this species is kept at the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute, Nairobi.CJO - Abstract - Unravelling the phylogenetic relationships of African trypanosomes of suids The parasite is known to be transmitted by the Tsetse fly.Tsetse biology, systematics and distribution, techniques == References == == External links == *Molecular Parasitology Group Category:Trypanosomatida Category:Parasites of mammals Category:Swine diseases Category:Parasitic excavates ",
