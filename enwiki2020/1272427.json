Its initial name was Trenchera denoting the presence of long and deep ravines. The early inhabitants of Trenchera were believed to be insurectors and possibly fugitives who took advantage of the numerous trenches for hiding as well as for defense against the Spanish authority. Sometime in 1873 when a certain Don Andres Penaloza was the Gobernadorcillo (equivalent to Mayor) of the town of San Pablo, Trenchera was formally separated and became pueblo or town but remained part of the Province of Batangas. Don Cirilo Baylon, a wealthy resident of Trenchera and with good command of the Spanish language invited Captain-General Juan de Alaminos Nivera, the Chief Executive of the Province of Batangas whose capital seat was Lipa. The Captain-General accepted the invitation and came in colorful carriage drawn by two horses. With Don Cirilo Baylon leading, he was warmly received by the residents of Trenchera. Dona Gregoria Baylon, the younger sister of Don Cirilo Baylon presented bouquets of fresh flowers to the Captain-General. During the program in honor of the Captain General and his party, Don Cirilo Baylon presented the petition of the residents asking that Trenchera be made into a duly organized and recognized town. The petition was read in public and the Captain General gave assurance to consider their wish favorably. In less than 2 months the official paper proclaiming Trenchera as a new pueblo or town arrived from Lipa. At the same time, Don Cirilo Baylon was appointed the first Gobernadorcillo or Town Mayor in concurrent capacity as Capitan de los Constables de Pueblo or the equivalent of the local police chief. In appreciation of Capitan General Juan de Alaminos Nivera, the new pueblo was named Alaminos in 1873 and remained part of the Province of Batangas until 1903. ==Geography== Alaminos has a land area of and is situated southeast of Manila.
