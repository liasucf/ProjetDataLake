    "text": "Anne Dugu\u00ebl is the pen name of Anne Liger-Belair (August 1, 1945 \u2013 May 21, 2015), a Belgian francophone author. She writes both children's and adult literature, and has also been known to use the pen names Gudule, Anne Gudu\u00ebl, or Anne Carali. Dugu\u00ebl is known for her fantastique works, which were inspired by the dark side of fairytales and writers such as Jean Ray and Michel de Ghelderode. ==Early life== Dugu\u00ebl was born in Ixelles, Belgium, the only daughter in a family of boys. According to French newspaper Le Monde, she always wanted to be a writer, finishing her first book at the tender age of 5. Raised in a strict Catholic household, Dugu\u00ebl became fascinated with fairytales and dark folk stories. Influenced by Jean Ray, she wrote \"Le Couvent maudit\" (\"The Cursed Convent\") in sixth grade. Thirty years later, this story became her novel \"L'Ecole qui n'existait pas\" (\"The School That Didn't Exist\"). ==Career== Dugu\u00ebl studied interior decorating in Brussels before traveling to Lebanon to live with her brother at the age of 19 after a failed romance and the birth of her first child. In Lebanon, she worked as a tailor and journalist. While living there, she met cartoonist Paul Karali, sometimes called Carali, whom she married and had two children with, Olivier and M\u00e9laka. Karali and Dugu\u00ebl left Lebanon for Paris, where she raised their children and continued her work as a journalist, as well as writing comic scenarios for publications such as Charlie Hebdo, Fluide Glacial, and Hara- Kiri. She appeared frequently on French radio program \"Radio Libertaire,\" a show dedicated to comic strips. Dugu\u00ebl also started writing stories for French children's magazines at this time. Dugu\u00ebl's first book, \"Prince Charmant, poil aux dents,\" was published until 1987. The book was a preview of the fantastique writing style Dugu\u00ebl became known for: Three maids of honor escape a wedding by entering a painting. While there, one of them marries a charming prince who turns out to be a hideous monster. She became a prolific writer, publishing several books a year, exploring topics such as autism, racism, paranoia and homelessness all with a touch of surrealism. Some of her best- known works include \"La Bibliothecaire,\" the story of a boy who dislikes reading, befriends a mysterious young woman and aids her in her quest to find a magic grimoire; and \"Entre chien et louve,\" the story of an old man who dies and returns to his beloved by inhabiting the body of a dog she adopted. ==Death== News of Dugu\u00ebl's death broke on May 21, 2015, to stunned and saddened reactions from the literary community. Her writing, which she described as, \"for youth, above all, but for adults a bit as well,\" is remembered as both creative and emotive, bringing a touch of the bizarre to real-world situations to evoke empathy in the reader. == Novels == * L'\u00c9cole qui n'existait pas (1994) * La Vie \u00e0 reculons (1994) * La Biblioth\u00e9caire (1995) * Apr\u00e8s vous, M.de La Fontaine (1995) * L'Envers du d\u00e9cor (1996) * La Fille au chien noir (1998) * J'irai dormir au fond du puits (1998) * L'Amour en chaussettes (1999) * Qui hante la tour morte?
