    "text": "is the fourteenth album by Japanese rock band Buck-Tick, released on April 5, 2005. The limited edition came with a DVD of the music video for the album's only single, \"Romance\". It reached number four on the Oricon chart. ==Overview== For Juusankai wa Gekkou the band deliberately adopted a Gothic theme, which is presented throughout the album. As vocalist Atsushi Sakurai is fond of the theme, he found it easy to work with and wrote the lyrics for all the songs except one. Guitarist Hisashi Imai actually thought of the idea during the tour for their previous album, but was further resolved to do it after watching Sakurai's solo performances.Fool\u2019s Mate # 283, \u300c\u201c \u591c\u201d \u306f\u90aa\u60aa\u306b\u3082\u306a\u308c\u308b\u3057\u3001\u30d4\u30e5\u30a2\u306b\u3082\u306a\u308c\u308b\u300d(\u201cThe night can become evil, or it can become pure\u201d), Koh Imazu, May 2005.English translation available here The songs \"Cabaret\" and \"Doll\" have lines sung in female vocabulary and grammar, while \"Doukeshi A\" is from the perspective of a pierrot. == Track listing == ==Personnel== ;Buck- Tick * Atsushi Sakurai \u2013 vocals * Hisashi Imai \u2013 guitar, noise, electronics, chorus * Hidehiko Hoshino \u2013 guitar, chorus * Yutaka Higuchi \u2013 bass * Toll Yagami \u2013 drums ;Additional performers * Kazutoshi Yokoyama \u2013 manipulator, synthesizer, piano, organ, celesta and noises == References == Category:2005 albums Category:Bertelsmann Music Group albums Category:Buck-Tick albums Category:Japanese-language albums ",
