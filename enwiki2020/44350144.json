    "text": "Exterior Interior Altarpiece by Neri di Bicci San Sisto is a Romanesque-style Roman Catholic church in the town of Viterbo in the Region of Lazio. The church was once known as San Sisto fuori la Porta Romana. == Description == The church was erected in the 11th-century, likely on the site of a prior chapel or aedicule. It once had an adjacent palace and monastery, and served as a hostel for pilgrims en route to Rome. The church has undergone a number of reconstructions along the centuries, most notably after much damage from bombing during World War II. A 19th-century description of the church bemoaned the state of the church:Posteriori trasformazioni sofisticarono, anche pi\u00f9 barbaramente, il tipo primigenio di questo tempio. Le volte vennero a celare i vecchi tetti a scheletro delle navate: molteplici altari squarciarono la maestosa nudit\u00e0 delle pareti: ed insolenti scialbatori di calce avranno dato di frego a chi sa quante pitture, iscrizioni e altre preziose memorie di quel luogo.Gli ospizi medioevali e l'Ospedal-grande di Viterbo: memorie storiche, by Cesare Pinzi (1893), page 173. > Later transformations embellished even more brutally, the primitive style of > this temple. The vaults were designed to conceal the old skeletal roofs of > the aisles: many altars ripped through the majestic nakedness of the walls > and insolent masons covered them with mortar giving in to those who can care > not a whit how many paintings, inscriptions and other precious memories > existed in that place. The simple facade was reconstructed after the war. The lower of two belltower dates to the 13th-century. The taller belltower, with 19th-century clock, was originally a defensive tower in the city walls. The latest reconstruction removed much of the post-Romanesque additions, including an adjacent nave. The basilica layout has a series of rounded arches, perched on medieval Corinthian columns, flanking the linear central nave, that leads to a series of staircases rising to the altar and apse. The apse once abutted the medieval walls of Viterbo. The interior contains both a font and an altar derived from Roman spolia.
