    "text": "Malmesbury market cross|alt= alt= A market cross, or in Scots, a mercat cross, is a structure used to mark a market square in market towns, where historically the right to hold a regular market or fair was granted by the monarch, a bishop or a baron. Market crosses were originally from the distinctive tradition in Early Medieval Insular art of free-standing stone standing or high crosses, often elaborately carved, which goes back to the 7th century. Market crosses can be found in most market towns in Britain. British emigrants often installed such crosses in their new cities, and several can be found in Canada and Australia. These structures range from carved stone spires, obelisks or crosses, common to small market towns such as that in Stalbridge, Dorset, to large, ornate covered structures, such as the Chichester Cross or Malmesbury Market Cross. They can also be constructed from wood; an example is at Wymondham, Norfolk. ==Towns and villages in Great Britain with a market cross== ===A=== * Aberdeen * Alfriston * Alnwick * Alston * Ambleside * Ashbourne * Askrigg ===B=== * Banbury * Barnard Castle * Bedale * Belford * Beverley * Bingham * Binham * Boroughbridge * Bovey Tracey * Bungay * Burnley * Bedlington * Bury St. Edmunds * Buxton ===C=== * Carlisle * Castle Combe * Chapel-en-le-Frith * Cheddar * Chester * Chichester * Chipping Sodbury * Colne * Clowne * Corby Glen * Corfe Castle * Coventry * Crich * Cricklade * Culross ===D=== * Darlington * Devizes * Dunstable * Yarn Market, Dunster ===E=== * Edinburgh * Easingwold * East Hagbourne * Elstow * Epworth ===F=== * Frome ===G=== * Glasgow * Glastonbury * Grantham * Guisborough * Garstang ===H=== * Harringworth * Helmsley * Henley-in-Arden * Hereford * Higham Ferrers * Highburton * Howden * Holsworthy * Holt * Huddersfield ===K=== * Keighley * Kirkby in Ashfield * Kirkby Lonsdale * Kirkby Malzeard ===L=== * Leicester * Leighton Buzzard * Lerwick ===M=== * Maiden Newton * Market Deeping * Malmesbury * Masham * Maybole * Mildenhall * Milnthorpe * Minchinhampton ===N=== * Newport * North Walsham * New Buckenham * Northallerton ===O=== * Oakenshaw * Oakham ===P=== * PembrokePembroke preaching and market crosses, Wales * Poulton-le-Fylde ===R=== * Repton * Ripon *Rothesay ===S=== * Saffron Walden * Salisbury * Selby * Shap * Shepton Mallet * Somerton * Spilsby * St Albans * Stalbridge * Stamfordham * Stow-on- the-Wold * Stretham * Sturminster Newton * Swaffham * Swinton (Berwickshire) ===W=== * Wells * West Burton * Wigtown (x2) * Winchester * Witney * Wymondham Image:Chichester_Cross,_c.1831.png|Chichester Image:Somerset sm market.jpg|Shepton Mallet Image:Bedale.jpg|Bedale Image:Highburton_Cross.jpg|Highburton Image:Aberdeen Market Cross.jpg|Aberdeen Image:cmglee_Wymondham_Market_Cross.jpg|Wymondham Image:Maybolecross.jpg|Maybole Image:Salisbury Market 20040724.jpg|Salisbury ==See also== *Perron *Tottenham High Cross *Eleanor cross *Bristol High Cross - now moved *Glasgow Cross ==References== Category:Market towns Category:Monument types Category:Crosses by function * ",
