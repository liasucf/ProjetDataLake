A new team with the Peoria Rivermen name currently competes in the Southern Professional Hockey League. ==History== The Peoria Rivermen were founded in 1982\u201383 in the International Hockey League, operating under owner Ken Wilson as the Peoria Prancers. The franchise was taken over by the Peoria Civic Center in 1984, which held a contest with the Peoria Journal Star newspaper to rename the team with Rivermen as the winner. The IHL's Peoria Rivermen began operations for the 1984\u201385 season and won the Turner Cup in their first season. They were bought by Bruce Saurs in the summer of 1989 and he owned the club for 19 seasons. In 1996, the organization left the IHL and joined the East Coast Hockey League when the IHL franchise relocated to become the San Antonio Dragons. They held professional hockey's longest winning streak at 18 games in 1991 until the Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League broke the record by winning 28 consecutive games in 2012. Former owner Bruce Saurs died in July 2014.http://www.pjstar.com/article/20140710/SPORTS/140719961/10988/SPORTS ==References== ==External links== *The Internet Hockey Database - Peoria Rivermen Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Illinois Category:Peoria Rivermen Category:St. Louis Blues minor league affiliates Category:New York Islanders minor league affiliates Category:1982 establishments in Illinois Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1982 Category:1996 disestablishments in Illinois Category:Ice hockey teams in Illinois Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1996 ",
