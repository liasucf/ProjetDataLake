The first dismasting took place in 1859, on a voyage from New York to San Francisco, and repairs were made in Rio de Janeiro. A tornado in in 1862 carried away the masts a second time, and forced her to put in at Plymouth, England. The third time she lost her masts, in a pampero off R\u00edo de la Plata in 1868, she was jury-rigged at sea and continued to San Francisco, where she incurred $18,000 in repair costs.
