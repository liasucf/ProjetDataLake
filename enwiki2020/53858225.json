She gained recognition performing alongside Sultan + Ned Shepard, LA Riots and Steve Aoki at local clubs. == Biography == At the age of nine, Freeman became inspired when her parents took her to her first concert to watch Ti\u00ebsto perform. At the age of eleven, she 'begged' her parents to buy her DJ equipments needed for her to start learning. Her father, who owns a roofing and restoration business, taught her the equipment's basics via instruction manuals. She opened a nightclub for children aged nine to fifteen called Elle's House, which is held in a section of an indoor kid's party venue in Woodland, Texas called Pump It Up. During April 2014 her debut single \"Starkidz\" was released. == References == Category:American DJs Category:People from Houston Category:Progressive house musicians Category:American house musicians Category:Electronic musicians Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Electronic dance music DJs Category:American women in electronic music Category:American female DJs ",
