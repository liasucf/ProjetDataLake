It is free software. == Overview == While the primary purpose of picogen is to display realistic 3D terrain, both in terms of terrain formation and image plausibility, it also is a heightmap-creation tool,Introduction to mkheightmap in which heightmaps are programmed in a syntax reminiscent of Lisp.Height Language Reference The shading system is partially programmable.Shaders in picogen == Example features == * Whitted- Style ray tracer for quick previews * Rudimentary path tracer for high quality results * Partial implementation of Preetham's Sun-/Skylight Model A Practical Analytical Model for Daylight, Preetham, et al. * Procedural heightmaps, though before rendering they are tesselated == Frontends == Currently there is a frontend to picogen, called picogen-wx (based on wxWidgets). It is encapsulated from picogen and thus communicates with it on command-line level. Picogen-wx provides several panels to design the different aspects of a landscape, e.g. the Sun/Sky- or the Terrain-Texture-Panel. Each panel has its own preview window, though each preview window can be reached from any other panel. Landscapes can be loaded and saved through an own, simple XML-based file format, and images of arbitrary size (including antialiasing) can be saved. The heightmap panel. == References == == External links == * * picogens DeviantArt-Group-Page Category:Free 3D graphics software Category:3D rendering software for Linux Category:Global illumination software Category:Rendering systems Category:Free software programmed in C++ Category:Software that uses wxWidgets ",
