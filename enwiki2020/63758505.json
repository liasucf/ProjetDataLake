(2020). * A study on the morphological diversity of osteostracan headshields, aiming to determine the relationship between their morphological diversity and hydrodynamic performance and its implications for the knowledge of the ecological diversity of the osteostracans, is published by Ferr\u00f3n et al. (2020). * A study on the fossil dentitions of acanthothoracids is published by Va\u0161kaninov\u00e1 et al. (2020), who report that the teeth of acanthothoracids differed fundamentally from those of arthrodires, and argue that the characteristic traits of acanthothoracid dentition might be ancestral for all jawed vertebrates. * Description of the neurocranial anatomy of Ellopetalichthys scheii is published by Castiello et al. (2020). * A study aiming to determine whether Titanichthys was a suspension feeder, focusing on mechanical properties of its jaw, is published by Coatham et al. (2020). * The earliest fossilized vertebrate embryos reported so far, preserved with an adult specimen of Watsonosteus fletti from the Givetian Eday Flagstone Formation (Orcadian Basin; Scotland, United Kingdom), are described by Newman et al. (2020). * Burrow, Newman & den Blaauwen (2020) describe external spiracular elements in Middle Devonian acanthodians from northern Scotland, differing from spiracles of all known extant and extinct fishes, and report the oldest record of elastic cartilage in the fossil record. * A study examining the factors influencing the long-term variations of genus-level diversity of elasmobranchs and ray-finned fishes throughout their evolutionary history is published by Guinot & Cavin (2020). * Carrillo-Brice\u00f1o et al. (2020) describe a new elasmobranch assemblage from the Oligocene\u2013Miocene boundary in the Dos Bocas Formation (Ecuador), and evaluate the implications of this assemblage for chronostratigraphic inferences and the knowledge of local paleoenvironment. * Two large vertebrae of sharks belonging to the genus Ptychodus, providing new information on the life history and body size of members of the family Ptychodontidae, are described from the Santonian of Spain by Jambura & Kriwet (2020). * A study on the evolution of body size in lamniform sharks, including the evolution of gigantism in the lineage of Otodus megalodon, is published by Shimada, Becker & Griffiths (2020). * A study aiming to determine the linear body dimensions of Otodus megalodon at different life stages is published by Cooper et al. (2020). * A study on the fossil record of the great white shark from the Pliocene of Peru and Chile is published by Villafa\u00f1a et al. (2020), who interpret their findings as indicating that great white sharks used the Coquimbo locality in Chile as a nursery and Pisco (Peru) and Caldera (Chile) localities as feeding grounds during the Pliocene. * A study on the anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of \"Urolophus\" crassicaudatus is published by Marram\u00e0 et al.
