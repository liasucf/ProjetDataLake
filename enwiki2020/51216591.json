    "text": "Philippe Colombe (died March 1722) was a Safavid artillery commander of French origin. ==Biography== A native of Paris, Colombe had served in the army of the Russian Tsardom before moving to Safavid Iran. Entering service under king Sultan Husayn (r. 1694\u20131722), Colombe came to be at the head of the empire's military ordnance. During the decisive battle against the rebellious Afghans in March 1722, at Gulnabad, Colombe was in command of the artillery corps (although he was nominally under Ahmad Khan, the tupchi-bashi), which hosted 24 cannons. During the battle, Colombe and his corps were left without protection, which resulted in them getting frantically attacked by the Afghans, and killed. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:1722 deaths Category:Military personnel of the Tsardom of Russia Category:Safavid generals Category:Iranian people of French descent Category:People from Paris Category:Russian people of French descent Category:18th-century people of the Safavid Empire ",
