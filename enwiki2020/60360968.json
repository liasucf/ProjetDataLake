The Gull Wing Group organizes car-related events including, driving tours, an annual convention with technical sessions and driver's education, social events and similar activities around the world. The organization has an international membership of approximately 600 members from 25 countries. As of 2019, Southern California is the largest region with 150 active members. Membership is open to anyone. ==History== The Gull Wing Group International started with eighteen Mercedes 300SL enthusiasts on August 1961 by Ernie Spitzer, an entrepreneur who owned a commercial printing business. The first meeting was held in Palo Alto, California at Ricky's Studio Inn and Hotel. By the end of 1961, the club had expanded to 38 dues paying members. A year later, the members and their cars were photographed at the Presidio with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background for Road & Track magazine and the 1963 issue of the Mercedes Benz magazine In Aller Welt and again in 1979. By the end of 1962, the organization had grown to just over 50, with some now coming from the rest of the United States and Canada. Many members were from Southern California and Oregon. By fall 1963, there were by-laws and members paid dues of $10.00. By 1965, a Southern California Chapter had been formed and the first meeting took place at the home of Stan Kauffman on August 11, 1965. Kauffman was President, James Mangham VP, and Tom Burniston was Secretary. Nineteen members of the Northern and Southern California Chapters met in Santa Barbara to plan for the first annual get together which was held in Reno, Nevada in May 1969. Membership had risen to nearly 200 and almost half attended the event when Chad Hunt became president. The organization began attracting members from all over the country and Hunt suggested that a formal Business Office be created. In 1971, membership had grown to 387. Roadster owners were accepted in 1971 though they could not vote. In 1972 Roadster owners were able to vote. In 2020, the GWG board voted on formally inviting Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG owners to become members. Inviting the SLS owners into the GWG exposes the 300 SL model to younger car enthusiasts. The SLS AMG is the spiritual successor to the 300 SL. The SLS AMG was designed to be a modern Gull Wing revival and 11473 cars were produced from 2010 to 2015. Many Gull Wing Group members who own a 300 SL also own an SLS. SLSs can now be shown and judged on the grass of the conventions. Roadsters are also welcomed in the Group ==Events== The first official event was a series of three technical sessions by a representative of the Robert Bosch Corporation covering the car\u2019s fuel injection system. Regular social and driving events had already been initiated. President John Willott and fellow members, Craig Mcloughlin and Tom Thornhill organized a tour of Arizona driving 1000 miles in 2018. Rykodisc founder, Don Rose participated. In 2012, member, Garry Boyce, organized an international rally tour in New Zealand. Bob Sirna, a previous president of the organization set a new Bonneville Speedway F/GT speed record in 2016 in a 300 SL, establishing a new mark for 3L Sport cars of 190.759 mph. Amir Almagor, a board member of the group, organized the 2015 and 2018 Holyland1000 tour in Israel. Eight Roadsters and two Gullwings participated in March 2018 in a 1000 mile tour of 77 pre-1965 cars around Israel. The organization has an international membership of approximately 600 members from 25 countries. As of 2019, Southern California is the largest region with 150 active members. Membership is open to anyone. An annual convention is held each fall at a different location throughout the United States and Canada. The Gull Wing Group members attend events around the country every year including the Copperstate 1000 and the Colorado Grand. ==Group's publication== Spitzer typed up a (nearly) monthly bulletin, the precursor to the Group's 300StarLetter. The first Bulletin was a simple four-page mimeographed edition produced in January 1962. The cover topic for the June 1962 issue was the First Anniversary Dinner, which was coming up later that month at the San Francisco Airport Hilton. The tab of $5.00 per person for the evening included a cocktail hour and dinner and a small amount that would be retained for club expenses. The award-winning 300StarLetter is now published ten times a year.. The Group's roster has been a valuable vehicle ownership source and maintains an active directory that is used to show the provenance of cars sold at auction.. ==Benefits== Today the club has a parts store open only to the members, technical assistance from its technical committee, an annual convention held in a different part of the country each year, a 300 SL rally sponsored by the 300 SL Charitable Foundation formed with the support of the club in 2018 and the 300StarLetter club magazine. ==Conventions== There have been 51 annual Conventions. The 2019 annual convention was held in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.
