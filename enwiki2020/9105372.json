Nolan has been dancing since the age of ten under the guidance of his parents Rose and Tony Nolan in Limerick and is no stranger to the international stage.

Twice World champion and three times All- Ireland champion, Nolan has performed throughout Europe and in the United States of America, South Africa, Canada, Israel and Australia. He has also appeared on numerous television shows including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Rosie O'Donnell Show in the USA, and Des O'Connor Tonight in Britain. Nolan performed on Michael Flatley's tribute programme on RT\u00c9's The Late Late Show special during 2000. He has also performed with The Chieftains in the past and at the Oscars in Los Angeles in 1998. After leaving Lord of the Dance Nolan joined the cast of To Dance on the Moon a production which has already played to in excess to 1 million people throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan.
