    "text": "Drafting Tape, also known as \"the second most useful tape in the world\", is similar to duct tape in that it has a wide variety of uses, but differs in several key areas. # Drafting tape is not nearly as strong as duct tape or Gaffer tape; it will break with minimal effort, and is not waterproof. # Drafting tape is easily removable, even from delicate surfaces like paper. It does not leave a sticky residue when it is removed. This is the main reason engineers and architects use this kind of tape in their blueprints.Drafting Tape Dick Blick Art Materials # Drafting tape is also relatively low-odour compared to other types of tape. Its odor is similar to electrical tape, but less rubbery and more papery. Many people find the odour pleasant, or at the very least, unobtrusive. # Drafting tape can also be used in Technical Drawing to help keep the paper well positioned and ensure no residue is left behind when removed. Drafting tape is nearly identical to \"masking tape\" and \"painters tape\", the main difference being width. Painters tape is the widest, averaging about 2\u00bd inches (approx. 6.4 cm), while masking tape and drafting tape are less than half that width. While the obvious use of drafting tape is for drawing, drafting tape can also be used for labeling and hanging posters. Its neutral cream coloring goes well with many other colors, and it can be written on easily with any felt-tipped marker. In addition, drafting tape costs less than conventional labels, and its low cost also makes it more forgiving of errors. ==See also== *List of adhesive tapes ==References== Category:Visual arts materials Category:Drawing Category:Adhesive tape ",
