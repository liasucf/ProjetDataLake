    "text": "Peter Gottfried Kremsner (born 16 May 1961 in Wiener Neustadt, Austria) is a specialist in tropical medicine and Full Professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany.https://www.medizin.uni- tuebingen.de/uktmedia/EINRICHTUNGEN/Kliniken/Medizinische+Klinik/Tropenmedizin/PDF_Archiv/CV+PGK.pdf Since 1992 he has been leading the Centre de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 (CERMEL), Gabon, now as president. For about three decades Kremsner has played an important role in the worldwide research of tropical infectious diseases. ==Biography== Kremsner grew up in Sigle\u00df, Austria. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna and graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1985. He started his academic career as a medical researcher at the Institute of Specific Prophylaxis and Tropical Medicine, University of Vienna. 1987 he went to Brazil working there for the Superintendencia de Campanhas de Saude Publica at Rio Branco. From 1988 to 1996 he held the position of a group leader at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Berlin. 1990 he earned his habilitation for Tropical Medicine and Specific Prophylaxis at the University of Vienna and 1992 an additional habilitation for Tropical Medicine and Parasitology at the Humboldt University of Berlin. 1992 he started the medical research center in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, now Centre de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 (CERMEL), and made it one of the premier research and training centers in Africa. 1996 Kremsner was appointed Professor for Parasitology at the University of T\u00fcbingen. Since 2008 he has been Chairman and Professor for Tropical Medicine, Travel Medicine and Parasitology at T\u00fcbingen University as well as Director of the Institute for Tropical Medicine. In 2014 he was additionally appointed CEO of the Comprehensive Infectious Disease Center of University Hospital T\u00fcbingen. 2016 he became also Adjunct Professor at the Medical University of Vienna. ==Research== Kremsner led numerous studies on tropical infectious diseases and is author of more than 600 scientific publications. Since 20 years he is one of the most cited scientists in the field of parasitology and malaria in Europe and worldwide. He has been principal investigator on key studies for the development of atovaquone/proguanil, artesunate/amodiaquine, artesunate/pyronaridine and parenteral artesunate for malaria therapy and prophylaxis. Kremsner and his team developed a simplified method for assessment of severity of malaria. Outcome can now be predicted and therapy focused by health care providers using the \"Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 Score\", which uses two clinical characteristics, coma and deep breathing without laboratory assessment. This was accomplished by using data from a study in 26,000 children with severe malaria in Africa led by him. Kremsner took part in the phase 3 testing of the malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, as a member of the governing clinical trial partnership committee and coordinator of clinical trials in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9. Since 2011, he and his team are working on development of other malaria vaccines, notably PfSPZ-based vaccines in cooperation with Sanaria Inc. A study carried out by his team in T\u00fcbingen of a PfSPZ vaccine showed 100 percent protection, a level consistent with WHO guidelines for worldwide use. Kremsner and his teams in T\u00fcbingen and Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 also established a Plasmodium falciparum controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model. Use of this CHMI model dramatically reduces the time needed for clinical development of malaria vaccine and drug candidates. ==Private life== Kremsner is married to the lawyer Inge Thomforde. They have three children (Helene, Gottfried and Ferdinand). He is interested in classical music, arts and literature. In addition to his citizenship of the European Union (Austrian), Kremsner is also a Gabonese citizen. ==Awards== *L'Ordre National du Merite Gabonais au Grade de Chevalier, Gabon, 2018 *Honorary Professor of the Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam, 2018 *International Honorary Fellow of American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 2017 *Memento Research Prize for neglected diseases, 2017 *Charles C.
