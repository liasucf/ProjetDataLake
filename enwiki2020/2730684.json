    "text": "The Laigin, modern spelling Laighin (), were a population group of early Ireland. They gave their name to the province of Leinster, which in the medieval era was known in Irish as C\u00f3iced Laigen, meaning \"province of the Leinstermen\" (Modern Irish C\u00faige Laighean). Their territory, located in south- east Ireland, is thought to have once extended from the River Shannon to the River Boyne. ==Etymology== Laigin is a plural noun, indicating an ethnonym rather than a geographic term, but the Irish system of naming territories meant that an area tended to be named after an apical ancestor-figure even when the ruling dynasty had no links to that figure. The origin of their name is uncertain; however, it is traditionally assumed to derive from the Irish word ', meaning 'a spear'. Early texts use names Laigen and Gaileoin interchangeably.John T. Koch, Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia. Vols 1-4, p. 1079. ==Origins== The Laigin are claimed as being descended from Labraid Loingsech. Modern historians suggest, on the basis of Irish traditions and related place names, that the Laigin were a group of invaders from Gaul or Britain, who arrived no later than the 6th century BC, and were later incorporated into the medieval genealogical scheme which made all the ruling groups of early Ireland descend from M\u00edl Esp\u00e1ine. Placenames also suggest they once had a presence in north Munster and in Connacht.Byrne 2001, pp. 130-164 ==Related peoples and dynasties== Archaic poems found in medieval genealogical texts distinguish three groups making up the Laigin: the Laigin proper, the Gaile\u00f3in, and the Fir Domnann. The latter are suggested to be related to the British Dumnonii.D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, \"Ireland, 400-800\", in D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn (ed.), A New History of Ireland Vol 1, 2005, pp. 182-234 Amongst others, some of the dynasties that claimed to belong to the Laigin include: U\u00ed Failge, U\u00ed Biarrche, U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge, U\u00ed Ceinnselaig, U\u00ed Garrchon, and the U\u00ed M\u00e1il. ==In medieval literature== In the legendary tales of the Ulster Cycle, the king of the Connachta, Ailill mac M\u00e1ta, is said to belong to the Laigin. This is thought by Byrne (2001) to be related to a possible early domination of the province of Connacht by peoples related to the Laigin, the Fir Domnann and the Gamanrad. ==See also== *U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge *U\u00ed Ceinnselaig *U\u00ed Bairrche *List of kings of Leinster *Lo\u00edgis ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==External links== *Ancient Laigin *Tribes of Laigin *Breassal Breac DNA Category:Gaels Category:Tribes of ancient Ireland Category:Gaelic-Irish nations and dynasties Category:Leinster ",
