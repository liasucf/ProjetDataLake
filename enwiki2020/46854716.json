As his nisba shows, he came from the locality of Jarjaraya, south of Baghdad. He began his career as private secretary to al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah. When al-Qasim died in October 904, he recommended either Abbas or the Jarrahid Ali Ibn Isa as his successor; when the latter declined, Caliph al-Muktafi (reigned 902\u2013908) duly appointed Abbas to the post. His tenure of office was marked by a close alliance with the Banu'l-Furat, whose leader Abu'l-Hasan Ali became his chief aide and designated successor. When al-Muktafi died in 908, it fell on Abbas and the senior bureaucrats to decide on his successor. In the end, Abbas heeded the advice of Abu'l-Hasan Ali, who counselled the selection of a weak ruler who would be easy to manipulate: al-Muktafi's 13-year-old brother Ja'far, who became Caliph al-Muqtadir (r. 908\u2013932). In December 908, a palace revolt broke out led by the Jarrahids and the Hamdanid al-Husayn ibn Hamdan, aiming to install his more mature and experienced uncle, Abdallah ibn al- Mu'tazz, in his stead. The revolt ultimately failed, but not before the rebels managed to kill Abbas. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:9th-century births Category:908 deaths Category:10th-century Arabs Category:Viziers of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Assassinated politicians Category:Medieval Iraqi people Category:10th-century people of the Abbasid Caliphate ",
