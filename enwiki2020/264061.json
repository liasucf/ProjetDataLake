He is known for the HBO political talk show Real Time with Bill Maher (2003\u2013present) and the similar late-night show called Politically Incorrect (1993\u20132002), originally on Comedy Central and later on ABC. Maher is known for his political satire and sociopolitical commentary. He targets many topics including religion, political correctness and the mass media. His critical views of religion were the basis for the 2008 documentary film Religulous. He is a supporter of animal rights, having served on the board of PETA since 1997, and is an advisory board member of Project Reason.The Reason Project; Project Reason.org; 2011 Maher supports the legalization of cannabis, serving on the advisory board of NORML.

In 2014, Maher won a Primetime Emmy Award for his work as executive producer for Vice. ==Early life and education== Maher was born in New York City. His father, William Aloysius Maher Jr., was a network news editor and radio announcer, and his mother, Julie Maher (n\u00e9e Berman), was a nurse. He was raised in his Irish-American father's Roman Catholic religion. Until his early teens, he was unaware that his mother, whose family was from Hungary, was Jewish. Owing to his disagreement with the Catholic Church's doctrine about birth control, Maher's father stopped taking Maher and his sister to Catholic church services when Maher was thirteen. Maher was raised in River Vale, New Jersey, and graduated from Pascack Hills High School in Montvale in 1974. He then attended Cornell University, where he double majored in English and History, and graduated in 1978.

He was host of the New York City comedy club Catch a Rising Star in 1979. Maher began appearing on Johnny Carson's and David Letterman's shows in 1982.Bill Maher - Hollywood Star Walk; Los Angeles Times; Patrick Kevin Day; September 13, 2010 He made limited television appearances including on Sara (1985), Max Headroom (1987),Science Fiction, Horror & Fantasy Film and Television Credits: Television shows; Harris M.

The show regularly began with a topical monologue by Maher preceding the introduction of four guests, usually a diverse group of individuals, such as show business, popular culture, political pundits, political consultants, authors, and occasionally news figures. The group would discuss topical issues selected by Maher, who also participated in the discussions. Jerry Seinfeld, a regular guest on the show, stated that Politically Incorrect reminded him of talk shows from the 1950s and '60s \"when guests interacted with each other as much as with the host\". Politically Incorrect won an array of awards, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Technical Direction, two CableACE awards for Best Talk Show Series, and a Genesis Award for Best Television Talk Show. Maher earned numerous award nominations for his producing, writing, and hosting of Politically Incorrect, including ten Emmy nominations, two TV Guide nominations, and two Writers Guild nominations. ABC decided against renewing Maher's contract for Politically Incorrect in 2002, after he made a controversial on-air remark six days after the September 11 attacks. He agreed with his guest, conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza, that the 9/11 terrorists did not act in a cowardly manner (in rebuttal to President Bush's statement calling them cowards). Maher said, \"We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly. You're right.\" Maher later clarified that his comment was not anti-military in any way whatsoever, referencing his well-documented longstanding support for the American military. After receiving complaints, FedEx and Sears Roebuck pulled their advertisements from the show, costing the show significant revenue. Maher's remarks after 9/11 were not the first time he had sparked controversy on Politically Incorrect. In the same year, he expressed his deep regrets and apologized after being widely criticized for comparing his dogs to retarded children. The show was canceled on June 16, 2002, and the Sinclair Broadcast Group had dropped the show from its ABC-affiliated stations months prior. On June 22, 2002, just six days after the cancellation of Politically Incorrect, Maher received the Los Angeles Press Club president's award (for \"championing free speech\"). Maher was on the board of judges for the 2002 PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award.Siems, Larry (April 11, 2002). \"Vanessa Leggett to receive 2002 PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award\", Pen American Center; accessed September 30, 2018. ====Real Time with Bill Maher==== In 2003, Maher became the host, co-producer, and co-writer of Real Time with Bill Maher, a weekly hour-long political comedy talk show on the cable television network HBO. In 2016, HBO renewed Real Time through 2018, for its 15th and 16th seasons. During an interview, Maher told Terry Gross (on NPR's Fresh Air) that he much prefers having serious and well-informed guests on his program, as opposed to the random celebrities that fleshed out his roundtable discussions on Politically Incorrect. As with his previous show, Politically Incorrect, Maher begins Real Time with a comic opening monologue based upon current events and other topical issues. He proceeds to a one-on-one interview with a guest, either in-studio or via satellite. Following the interview, Maher sits with two or three panelists, usually consisting of pundits, authors, activists, actors, politicians, and journalists, for a discussion of the week's events. Real Time has earned widespread praise. It has been nominated for more than ten Primetime Emmy Awards and six Writer's Guild awards. In 2007, Maher and his co-producers were awarded the Television Producer of the Year Award in Variety Television by the Producers Guild of America.Producers Guild of America Awards \u2013 Winners 1990-2010; PGA.org; May 29, 2012 Maher holds the record for the most Emmy nominations without a win, having been nominated on 22 occasions and not winning once. Eleven of the nominations were for Politically Incorrect, while nine were for Real Time. The other two were nominations for two of his HBO comedy specials: I'm Swiss and Bill Maher: The Decider. =====Notable responses to Real Time episodes===== In late May 2005, Alabama Congressman Spencer Bachus sent a letter to Time Warner's board of directors requesting Real Time be canceled after remarks Maher made after noting the military had missed its recruiting goals by 42 percent. Bachus said he felt the comments were demeaning to the military and treasonous. Maher stated his highest regard and support for the troops and asked why the congressman criticized him instead of doing something about the recruitment problem. On September 17, 2010, Maher aired a clip of Delaware Republican Senatorial candidate Christine O'Donnell from the October 29, 1999 episode of his old show Politically Incorrect on his current show Real Time with Bill Maher, where she mentioned that she had \"dabbled in witchcraft\". This was one of the most notable of numerous controversial statements by O'Donnell that made her the most covered candidate in the 2010 mid-term election cycle. In February 2017, Maher invited Milo Yiannopoulos to be interviewed on Real Time. Yiannopoulos accepted, despite protests from some commentators and fans. The appearance on Maher's show harmed Yiannopoulos's career due to comments in the interview in which he seemed to express sympathy toward perpetrators of child sexual abuse. In the days following the interview, Yiannopoulos had his invitation to speak before the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference, as well as a book deal with Simon & Schuster, cancelled. Yiannopoulos subsequently resigned as an editor at Breitbart News. When asked whether Yiannopoulos's interview on his show was among the causes of his resignation, Maher concurred, saying, \"As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You're welcome.\" In June 2017, Maher came under criticism for saying \"I'm a house nigger\" on Real Time with calls being made by people to HBO to fire him. Following the episode, HBO sent a statement to media outlets, calling Maher's remarks \"inexcusable and tasteless\" and said the cable network will remove that segment from future airings of the show. Maher also issued a statement apologizing for the remarks. ===Political commentator=== Maher is a frequent commentator on various cable news networks, including CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and HLN. Maher has regularly appeared on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer and has also been a frequent guest on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, The Rachel Maddow Show, and Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Maher has also appeared as a guest on HLN's The Joy Behar Show. He wrote the foreword for the 2002 book, Spin This!: All the Ways We Don't Tell the Truth by show host Bill Press.Spin This!: All the Ways We Don't Tell the Truth; Bill Press; Simon & Schuster; 2002; Pg. xi Maher hosted the January 13, 2006 edition of Larry King Live, on which he was a frequent guest. Maher appeared as a special guest on the June 29, 2010 edition of the show, on which CNN anchor Larry King announced his retirement. Maher co-emceed the final show of Larry King Live on December 16, 2010 with Ryan Seacrest. ===Other work=== In 2004, Maher appeared on stage as Satan in The Steve Allen Theater production of \"Hollywood Hell House\", a spoof of the Christian-run hell houses. The show was a faithful reproduction of an evangelistic scare-experience written by Reverend Keenan Roberts to terrify teenagers into declaring themselves Christians. \"Our faith is that putting this up as itself, it will hoist itself on its own petard, that it's comical just as it is,\" explained producer Maggie Rowe. The show featured a rotating cast of over 160 celebrities, including Andy Richter (Jesus), Richard Belzer, Dave Thomas, Traci Lords, Craig Bierko, Sarah Silverman, and Julia Sweeney. Maher and director Larry Charles teamed up to make the movie Religulous, described by trade publication Variety as a documentary \"that spoofs religious extremism across the world\". It was released on October 3, 2008.Demara, Bruce. (September 10, 2007.) \"Maher preaches to the TIFF choir\". The Toronto Star.

Also in 2013, Maher appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and offered to pay $5 million to a charity if Donald Trump would produce his birth certificate to prove that Trump's mother had not mated with an orangutan. Maher said this reportedly in response to Trump having previously challenged President Barack Obama to produce his birth certificate, and having offered $5 million payable to a charity of Obama's choice if Obama would produce his college applications, transcripts, and passport records. In response to Maher's offer, Trump produced his birth certificate, and then Trump launched a lawsuit after Maher was not forthcoming, claiming that Maher's $5 million offer was legally binding. \"I don't think he was joking\", Trump said. \"He said it with venom.\" Trump withdrew his lawsuit against the comedian after eight weeks. On May 13, 2016, Maher and his friend Michael Moore announced on YouTube that they are going to make a movie called The Kings of Atheism. ==Views and beliefs== ===Politics=== Maher and Ingrid Newkirk, founder of PETA. Maher is on the board of directors of the animal rights group. Maher often eschews political labels, referring to himself as \"practical\". He identifies as liberal, but stands against political correctness. In his words, \"The difference is that liberals protect people, and P.C. people protect feelings.\" In the past, he has also described himself as a libertarian, and has also referred to himself \"as a progressive, as a sane person\".Rutenberg, Jim. (October 8, 2001.) \"Bill Maher still secure in ABC slot, at least now\". The New York Times. In a 2012 panel discussion with Salman Rushdie, Maher counted himself, Rushdie, and others such as Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris as \"9/11 liberals,\" noting that they differentiate themselves from many mainstream liberals in saying that not all religions are alike and that they are not bigoted in criticizing a particular religion. He said in a later interview: \"It's ridiculous to label criticism of a religion as a phobia of a religion. I'm going to criticize any person or group that violates liberal principles....\" Maher favors ending corporate welfare and federal funding of non-profits as well as the legalization of gambling, prostitution, and cannabis. Maher is a member of the advisory boards for both the NORML and Marijuana Policy Project, organizations that support regulated legalization of cannabis, and has been called \"one of the brightest torches for sensible marijuana policy\" and \"a contemporary cannabis statesman\". Maher describes himself as an environmentalist, and he has spoken in favor of the Kyoto treaty on global warming on his show Real Time. He often criticizes industry figures involved in environmental pollution.Halem, Dann. (August 1, 2001.) \"Is Bill Maher a libertarian?\" , Salon (news website). Retrieved on October 12, 2007. He is a board member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

It's part of all police work. If they stop calling it profiling and start calling it high-intelligence screening or something, people would go, it's about time.\"(2002-12-16 broadcast.) \"CNN American Morning with Paula Zahn: Talk with Bill Maher\" (Transcript) (Caveat: \"This is a rush transcript.\"); retrieved on October 12, 2007. He opposed the Iraq War from the beginning, and has summarized his opinion by saying that the United States and the world have had to pay too high a price for the war. He is skeptical of Iraq surviving without civil war. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Maher announced his support for U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-IL). Although Maher welcomed Obama's electoral victory, he subjected him to criticism after he took office for not acting more boldly on health care reform and other progressive issues. Maher with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) On February 23, 2012, after his 'Crazy Stupid Politics' special streamed on Yahoo! Screen, Maher announced that he was contributing $1 million to Priorities USA, the Obama SuperPAC. On the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Maher says he is \"more on the side of the Israelis\" and doesn't consider both sides equally guilty. He acknowledges that \"Palestinians do have gripes\", and he has been critical of U.S. financial aid to Israel, saying \"they don't need our money, they can handle it themselves.\" Maher also notes that most Israelis would prefer a two-state solution and oppose the hard-line stance of their Israeli government, which he describes as having been taken over by their version of the Tea Party. However, Maher has defended Israel's military actions against Palestinian militants amid criticism over civilian deaths and disproportionate casualty count between Israelis and Palestinians during the 2014 Gaza war. He argues that Israel is still showing restraint, and he finds it ironic that the same people who were incredulous over how the Jews in World War II were led \"to their slaughter\", can't understand why they are defending themselves now.Bill Maher Defends Israel Again: 'People Die in Wars, Mediaite, August 1, 2014 Maher is a gun owner, and explained in his February 12, 2013, appearance on the late night TV talk show Conan that he owns guns for personal home protection. However, he does not identify himself as a \"proud\" gun owner, commenting that being a proud gun owner is akin to \"saying I'm a 'proud remote control owner'\". Maher has stated that statistics showing that gun owners are more likely to harm a member of their household are caused by irresponsible gun owners, and believes that tragedies such as school shootings will not lead to fundamental change in gun laws because both Democrats and Republicans favor guns. He believes the Second Amendment is \"bulls\u2014t.\" On June 7, 2013, Maher expressed on his show limited support for the NSA's PRISM intelligence data collection from private phone calls and the Internet, saying that the threat of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear weapons was the tipping point for him. While he stated that he trusted the Obama administration to employ the program responsibly, he described the NSA's access to private data as a \"slippery slope\", and worried about whether other politicians would be as responsible. In the leadup to the 2014 midterm elections, Maher conducted a \"Flip a District\" contest on his HBO show. His audience was asked to select one \"terrible, entrenched\" member of Congress in a close election race\u2014\"the loserest loser of all\"\u2014to remove from office. Maher aimed to help oust that representative by shining a \"national spotlight\" on the politician during segments of his show and stand-up comedy appearances in that member's district during the Fall election.Maher Wants His Show to Decide a House Race; New York Times; Bill Carter; January 30, 2014.Flip a District; Real Time with Bill Maher; June 3, 2014.

He specifically criticized the use of bait, referring to its use as \"nothing but an execution\". Maher supports the death penalty.Larry King Live \u2013 Transcript; CNN; December 15, 2005 In 2015, Maher criticized Barack Obama's visit to Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally, saying: \"Stop respecting their medieval bullshit under the guise of, 'It's their culture.'\" In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Maher initially endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders on February 5, 2016.

You f*cked it up. You're Bill Buckner. We had the World Series, and you let the grounder go through your legs. Let someone else have the chance.\" Maher said economic recession would be 'worth it' if Donald Trump doesn't get re-elected in 2020. He said: \"We have survived many recessions. We can't survive another Donald Trump term.\" In 2019, Maher denounced the anti- Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, saying: \"It's predicated on this notion ... I think it's very shallow thinking that the Jews in Israel are mostly white and Palestinians are mostly brown, so they must be innocent and correct and the Jews must be wrong.\" He responded to Rep. Rashida Tlaib's call to boycott his talk show: \"Some people have one move only: boycott. Cancel. Make-go-away. But here's the thing, the house voted 318 to 17 to condemn the #BDS movement, including 93% of Dems. Does Tlaib want to boycott 93% of her own party?\". He has also been critical of the #MeToo movement, describing the movement as McCarthyite. He has supported Chris Matthews against allegations of sexual harassment. In addition, he is against what he sees as 'cancel culture' from the left (such as the firing of Megyn Kelly following her comments on blackface). In 2020, he criticized those who equated using the term \"Wuhan virus\" with racism, stating, \"Scientists...have been naming diseases after the places they came from for a very long time. Zika is from the Zika Forest, Ebola from the Ebola River, hantavirus the Hantan River. There's the West Nile virus and Guinea worm and Rocky Mountain spotted fever and, of course, the Spanish flu.\" He added: \"This has nothing to do with Asian Americans, and it has everything to do with China.\" ===Religion=== Protesters outside Ryerson University awaiting the arrival of Bill Maher on September 6, 2008 Maher is highly critical of all religion and views it as highly destructive. He has been described, or self-identified, variously as an agnostic, atheist, and apatheist, while objecting to having his views defined by a single label. In his 2008 feature film Religulous, he refers to himself as agnostic.Holden, Stephen (September 30, 2008). \"Believers, Skeptics and a Pool of Sitting Ducks\", The New York Times He has rejected being grouped with explicit atheists, saying in 2002, \"I'm not an atheist. There's a really big difference between an atheist and someone who just doesn't believe in religion. Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don't need, but I'm not an atheist, no.\"Thompson, Stephen (October 9, 2002). \"Is There a God?\". The A.V. Club. Maher has also occasionally referred to himself as an apatheist, saying in 2011 \"I don't know what happens when you die, and I don't care.\" When discussing his apatheism and his views on the existence of God, he said on a scale from 1 to 7 (7 being \"absolutely certain there is no god\"), he was only at 6.9, like Richard Dawkins, \"because we just don't know ... but we just don't think about it.\" He added, \"There's atheist and there's agnostic, and I'm okay with us not splitting the difference on those; if you are just not a super-religious person, you are on my team.\"\"Bill Maher explains his 'apatheism,' apathetic atheism\". CNN Belief Blogs, July 12, 2011. Several months later on a 2012 episode of his HBO show, Maher declared that \"idiots must stop claiming that atheism is a religion [...] believe it or not, I don't really enjoy talking about religion all the time. In fact, not only is atheism not a religion, it's not even my hobby, and that's the best thing about being an atheist. It requires so little of your time.\"HBO: Real Time with Bill Maher; Episode 236 \u2013 New Rules; Home Box Office; February 3, 2012 He has reiterated his stance during other interviews, rejecting both the certitude of the existence, as well as the certitude of nonexistence of deities, concluding, \"I'm saying that doubt is the only appropriate response for human beings.\"\"Bill Maher: The God Botherer\".

He has described Christianity and Islam as more \"warlike\", and has asserted that, like historic Christianity, present-day Islam needs to undergo its own reformation and enlightenment. In defense of his criticism of Islam, Sharia law and Muslim culture, Maher says he is \"... someone who believes in the values that Western people believe in that a lot of the Muslim world does not. Like separation of church and state. Like equality of the sexes. Like respect for minorities, free elections, free speech, freedom to gather. These things are not just different from cultures that don't have them.... It's better ... I would like to keep those values here.\" Citing studies and poll results by Pew Research Center, the World Economic Forum and others, Maher says the human rights violations and \"illiberal ideas\" found in Islam are not extremist views held by a small minority, but are supported by a majority of citizens in Muslim countries. Maher has criticized liberals as hypocritical for defending these core liberal values and ideals only at home, while not condemning the oppression of these values and groups in Muslim culture. Regarding the more recent publicity generated by his stance in the ongoing debate, Maher says he thinks people are finally paying closer attention to a conversation that they need to have. \"I'm just shining a light on the reality of the situation. I don't even understand why this is so controversial.\" Maher received the 2009 Richard Dawkins Award from Atheist Alliance International.Timonen, Josh (September 28, 2009). \"A note about the 'Richard Dawkins Award' being presented to Bill Maher this weekend\".

In an episode of his show about the 2008 presidential candidates' health plans, Maher stated that poor nutrition is a primary cause of illness, and that \"the answer isn't another pill.\"Real Time with Bill Maher; September 28, 2007; HBO He also has said: \"If you believe you need to take all the pills the pharmaceutical industry says you do, then you're already on drugs!\" He has expressed his distaste for the pharmaceutical and health care industries in general, on the grounds that they make their money out of treating people who are made sick by consuming unhealthy food that corporations push on the public. He maintains that mass consumption of high-fructose corn syrup is a contributor to the rise in frequency of obesity in the United States.Larry King Live \u2013 Interview With Bill Maher; CNN; September 13, 2004 In a discussion with Michael Moore about the film Sicko, Maher said, \"The human body is pretty amazing; it doesn't get sick, usually, for no reason. I mean, there's some genetic stuff that can get to you, but, basically, people are sick in this country because they're poisoned. The environment is a poisoning factor, but also, we gotta say, they poison themselves. They eat shit. People eat shit, and that's, to my way of thinking, about 90 percent of why people are sick, is because they eat shit.\"Kerry Trueman, Maher and Moore Chew (Out) the Fat; The Huffington Post; May 30, 2007. Tara Parker-Pope and former Senator (R-TN) Dr. Bill Frist, a physician, have called his criticism of the H1N1 flu vaccinations unscientific. Infectious diseases expert Paul Offit has written that misinformation about vaccines from celebrities like Maher has put children at unnecessary risk. Offit says that celebrities like Maher are seen as \"less credible\" and would still be considered just \"great entertainment\" if they weren't joined by the former Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Bernadine Healy and influential pediatrician, Dr. Robert Sears. Surgical Oncologist David Gorski criticized Maher's claims about vaccines several times on ScienceBlogs, and when Maher received the Richard Dawkins Award in 2009, Gorski wrote it was inappropriate. Skeptics, including magician and popular science writer Martin Gardner, neurologist Steven Novella, and magician Jamy Ian Swiss have also strongly rebuked Maher, characterizing him as anti- science, uninformed and potentially endangering the health of fans who take his \"non-medical\" advice. Maher responded to the criticism, saying, \"What I've read about what they think I'm saying is not what I've said. I'm not a germ theory denier. I believe vaccinations can work. Polio is a good example. Do I think in certain situations that inoculating Third World children against malaria or diphtheria, or whatever, is right? Of course. In a situation like that, the benefits outweigh costs. But to me living in Los Angeles? To get a flu shot? No.\"Slotek, Jim (October 28, 2009). \"Needling Bill Maher\". Winnipeg Sun. In 2019, Gorski again criticized Maher's HBO interview with the doctor Jay Gordon and Maher's claims about vaccines (in particular, the influenza vaccine), spreading out vaccinations and the possibility of a link between vaccines and autism, which is debunked according to consensus science. ===Cannabis advocacy=== Maher, who has a California medical marijuana card, openly and publicly uses cannabis, and has been a visible supporter of cannabis law reform. He has been on the advisory board both of NORML and the Marijuana Policy Project. He sold pot while in college at Cornell and credits it for making his college and the beginning of his career as a comic possible. ====Awards==== Maher was honored by High Times as \"Top Pot Comic in 2006\" and Real Time won a Stony Award in 2006 for \"Best Cable News Show\". High Times later designated him as \"Stoner of the Year\". ===Miscellaneous=== Maher has been a critic of 9/11 conspiracy theories. On October 19, 2007, Maher confronted several 9/11 truthers and had them ejected from his show audience after they interrupted the live show numerous times by calling out from the audience.

In November 2004, at the end of their 17-month relationship, Johnsen sued Maher for US$9 million for \"pain and suffering\" for alleged \"insulting, humiliating and degrading racial comments\". Her suit stated that Maher promised to marry her and father her children, support her financially and buy a house in Beverly Hills. Johnsen's suit also alleged that she quit her job as a flight attendant and occasional model to be with him. Maher's lawyers in their response, filed on November 23, 2004, in Los Angeles Superior Court said Maher is a \"confirmed bachelor, and a very public one at that\" who \"never promised to marry [Johnsen] or to have children with her\".
