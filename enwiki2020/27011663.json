    "text": "Norway was represented by the Bendik Singers, with the song '\"It's Just a Game\", at the 1973 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 7 April in Luxembourg City. \"It's Just a Game\" was chosen as the Norwegian entry at the Melodi Grand Prix on 17 February. ==Final== The MGP was organised by broadcaster NRK at the Ch\u00e2teau Neuf in Oslo, hosted by Vidar L\u00f8nn-Arnesen. Five songs were presented in the final with each song sung twice by different singers, once with a small combo and once with a full orchestra. The winning song was chosen by voting from a 14-member public jury who each awarded between 1 and 5 points per song. \"It's Just a Game\" was performed in Norwegian at MGP, but with the introduction of the free-language rule in 1973 Norway was one of three countries (along with Finland and Sweden) who took the opportunity to translate their entry into English before the Eurovision final. The Bendik Singers included past and future Norwegian representatives Arne Bendiksen (1964), Anne-Karine Str\u00f8m (1974 & 1976) and Ellen Nikolaysen (1975).ESC National Finals database 1973 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" |+ style=\"font-size: bigger;\" | MGP - 17 February 1973 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

This proved to be Norway's only top 10 ranking of the 1970s, and would not be bettered until the victory of Bobbysocks! in 1985.ESC History - Norway 1973 ==See also== *Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1973 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1973 Category:Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1973 in Norwegian music Category:1973 in Norwegian television ",
