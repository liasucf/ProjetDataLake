    "text": "In physics, a quiver diagram is a graph representing the matter content of a gauge theory that describes D-branes on orbifolds. Each node of the graph corresponds to a factor U(N) of the gauge group, and each link represents a field in the bifundamental representation :(M,\\bar{N}). The relevance of quiver diagrams for string theory was pointed out and studied by Michael Douglas and Greg Moore. While string theorists use the words quiver diagram, many of their colleagues in particle physics call these diagrams mooses. ==References== ==See also== *quiver (mathematics).
