    "text": "Ren\u00e9 II (2 May 1451 - 10 December 1508) was Count of Vaud\u00e9mont from 1470, Duke of Lorraine from 1473, and Duke of Bar from 1483 to 1508. He claimed the crown of the Kingdom of Naples and the County of Provence as the Duke of Calabria 1480-1493 and as King of Naples and Jerusalem 1493-1508\\. He succeeded his uncle John of Vaud\u00e9mont as Count of Harcourt in 1473, exchanging it for the county of Aumale in 1495. He succeeded as Count of Guise in 1504. ==Life== Ren\u00e9 was born in Angers, the son of Yolande of Lorraine and Frederick, Count of Vaud\u00e9mont. He spent his youth in the court of his grandfather Ren\u00e9 I of Anjou between Angers and Provence, succeeding to his father in Vaud\u00e9mont in 1470 and, three years later, to his uncle as captain of Angers, seneschal and governor of Anjou. In the same year he became Duke of Lorraine, which was at the time under the pressure of both Louis XI of France and Charles the Bold of Burgundy, with whom he initially allied. When the latter began to establish garrisons in Lorraine, however, Ren\u00e9 secretly allied with Louis (1474). Charles invaded the duchy and Ren\u00e9 was forced to quit Nancy (30 November 1475). He regained the city on 5 October the following year and moved to Switzerland to hire an army of Swiss mercenaries. With this force Ren\u00e9 defeated and killed Charles at the Battle of Nancy (5 January 1477), ending the Burgundian Wars. In 1476, upon the death of his grandmother, he became sole Count of Harcourt and Baron of Elbeuf. Later, Ren\u00e9 got to bad terms with Louis, who had taken most of his heritage. In June 1478, as compensation for the royal seizure of Anjou and Provence, Louis XI reaffirmed his rights to the formerly Burgundian possessions of the Duchy of Luxembourg and the County of Burgundy, and then transferred those rights to Ren\u00e9 and all of his descendants. The transfer of the County of Burgundy to France in 1482 with the Treaty of Arras made realization of these rights possible, but the County was returned to the Habsburgs in 1493 with the Treaty of Senlis and Ren\u00e9 would not exercise control over the County again. Likewise, any authority over Luxembourg was merely theoretical outside of the seizure of Virton, as the Duchy remained in possession of the Habsburgs throughout Ren\u00e9's lifetime. In 1480 Ren\u00e9 succeeded his grandfather as Duke of Bar while his mother was still living. In 1482 he conquered the pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 of Virton, a part of the Duchy of Luxembourg, and annexed it to Bar. In 1484 Peter II, Duke of Bourbon, regent for the young King Charles VIII of France, formally installed him in the Duchy of Bar. When his mother Yolande died in 1483, he succeeded her in her claims to the kingdoms of Naples and Jerusalem. In 1482, Ren\u00e9 traveled to Italy and defeated the Duke of Ferrara in the Battle of Adria as an ally of the Republic of Venice. In 1485 Ren\u00e9 took part in the first phase of the so-called \"Mad War\", but prudentially retired after a while. In 1488 the Neapolitans offered him the crown of the Kingdom of Naples, and Ren\u00e9 set an expedition to gain possession of the realm; he was however halted by the new French king, Charles VIII, who intended to claim the realm himself. In 1495, to settle a dispute with his second cousin, Jean IV de Rieux, over their grandmothers' inheritance, he ceded to Jean the county of Harcourt and its appurtenances, retaining only Elbeuf and Brionne, and receiving the county of Aumale. ==Death== Ren\u00e9 fell ill during a hunt in Fains, and died on 10 December 1508, aged 57. ==Family== On his mother's side, he was a grandson of Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine. His father was a member of the Vaud\u00e9mont family, a junior branch of the Lorraine ducal family, descending from John I, Duke of Lorraine. He was thus both heir-general and heir-male to the Duchy when he succeeded on the death of his cousin Nicholas in 1473. On 9 September 1471 he married Jeanne d'Harcourt (d. 1488), Countess of Tancarville, but the marriage was annulled in 1485. Ren\u00e9 married Philippa of Guelders, daughter of Adolf, Duke of Guelders, in Orl\u00e9ans on 1 September 1485 and had the following children: * Charles (b. 17 August 1486, Nancy), d. young * Francis (5 July 1487, Pont-\u00e0- Mousson) (died at birth) * Antoine, Duke of Lorraine (1489-1544) * Nicholas (9 April 1493, Nancy), d. young * Claude, Duke of Guise (1496-1550), first Duke of Guise * Jean, Cardinal of Lorraine and Bishop of Metz (1498-1550) * Louis, Count of Vaud\u00e9mont (1500-1528) * Fran\u00e7ois, Count of Lambesc (1506-1525) * Anne (19 December 1490, Bar-le-Duc - 1491) * Isabelle (2 November 1494, Lun\u00e9ville - bef. 1508) * Claude and Catherine (twins) (24 November 1502, Bar-le-Duc), d. young ==Ancestors== ==See also== * Dukes of Lorraine family tree ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * * * |- |- |- |- Category:1451 births Category:1508 deaths Category:People from Angers Category:House of Vaud\u00e9mont Category:Kings of Jerusalem Category:Kings of Naples Category:Dukes of Lorraine Category:Dukes of Bar Category:Dukes of Calabria Category:Counts of Provence Category:Counts of Vaud\u00e9mont Category:Counts of Aumale Category:Counts of Guise Category:Marquesses of Pont-\u00e0-Mousson Category:Barons of Elbeuf Category:Barons of Mayenne ",
