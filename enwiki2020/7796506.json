The JCF also provides general assistance to the public, as needed. By adherence to their Citizens' Charter, the JCF endeavours to serve its citizens in general service and through the impartial, transparent enforcement of law and order. ==History== The history of law enforcement in Jamaica began in 1716 when night watchmen were appointed to serve the cities of Port Royal, Kingston, and the parishes of Saint Catherine and Saint Andrew. In 1832 the first attempt to establish a permanent police force began, and William Ramsay was appointed Inspector General of the police force in 1835. This force continued in service until 1865, the year of the Morant Bay Rebellion. This uprising demonstrated the vulnerability of peace and law on Jamaica and caused the establishment of an improved police force, the Jamaica Constabulary Force. The force began operation with 984 members, under the direction of an Inspector General appointed by the British Governor to the island, and continues to carry out police duties to the present day. In July 2014 Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Operations, Glenmore Hinds was appointed the Acting Commissioner of Police following the sudden retirement of Police Commissioner Owen Ellington. In September 2014, the Minister of National Security announced the appointment of Deputy Commissioner Carl M. Williams, Ph.D., to become the new Commissioner of Police. In December 2016, Dr. Carl Williams announced that he will be retiring from the Jamaica Constabulary Force effective January 6, 2017. The Police Services Commission immediately named Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Novelette P. Grant, JP, MA, M.Sc. to act as Commissioner of Police for 90 days effective January 7, 2017. DCP Grant is only female holding one of the four deputy commissioner rank in the Jamaica Constabulary Force. On April 10, 2017, the Police Services Commission announced the appointment of Deputy Commissioner George F. Quallo as the new commissioner of police effective April 18, 2017. On January 26, 2018, Mr. George Quallo announced that he will be retiring from the Jamaica Constabulary Force, he was expected to demit office in August 2018. On February 1, 2018, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Clifford Blake to act as Commissioner of Police until March 19, 2018 when Major General Antony Anderson will officially be appointed to the post.

Recruits undergo a minimum of six months' basic training. Students are required to sit four written examinations called modules and twelve practical tests. They are exposed to on-the-job training through visits to selected police stations and Parish Courts. Upon completion of basic training, they are transferred to various divisions (where they are placed under supervision of the Divisional Training Sub-Officer) to continue their two-year probationary training. At the end of 18 months' service, probationary officers return to the Jamaica Police Academy for an additional five weeks of training. Thereafter, they return to their divisions to complete the probationary period. Some elements of the JCF are trained in a para-military fashion, and the element of the force is the Specialized Operations Branch (formerly Mobile Reserve). ==Equipment== * Glock 17 & 19 right * Taser gun * Heckler & Koch MP5 right * M16 rifle A1, A2 & A4 right * Ballistic Helmet * Baton * Handcuffs right * Ballistic vest * Browning Hi-Power * M4 rifle right * Patrol Vehicles * Mitsubishi Triton * Mitsubishi Vitara * Toyota Corolla * Kia Sportage * Kia Sorento * Kia Forte * Toyota Hilux * Toyota RAV4 * Transport * Toyota Coaster * Toyota Hiace * Aircraft * Bell 407 ==Policing style== ===Use of deadly force=== The Jamaican police have a history of extra-judicial killings. In 2003 the Crime Management Unit (CMU), headed by the controversial Reneto Adams, was disbanded following allegations that it was \"Jamaica's version of Dirty Harry\". Mark Shields, then of Scotland Yard and later Deputy Police Commissioner of the JCF, was brought in from London to investigate; Adams was acquitted of shooting four people in an alleged extrajudicial execution. In a climate of gang warfare cops with a record of killing gangsters such as Keith \"Trinity\" Gardner (noted for shooting several members of the Stone Crusher gang) and Cornwall \"Bigga\" Ford ( who was on the scene at the alleged killing of seven 15\u201320-year-old youths in Braeton in 2001) became folk heroes. The police team was searching for suspects who had killed a teacher in cold blood, and a policeman a few months earlier. Per capita killings by the JCF are among the highest in the world. With a population of less than three million, police killed 140 people each year in the 1990s\u2014five times the death rate in 1990s South Africa. Current rates may be as many as 300 per year. This makes Jamaica's police force \"among the deadliest in the world\". On 31 July 2010, three policemen were arrested after they were filmed beating (and then shooting to death) an unarmed murder suspect, Ian Lloyd, in Buckfield, St. Ann; Lloyd was lying on the ground, writhing and apparently helpless. The footage was shown on TVJ television news 30 July 2010. Initial police reports were at variance with the actions shown in the amateur-video footage later released. The officers involved in the killing were acquitted due to an inability to present the maker of the video for court to authenticate it for evidentiary purposes. ==See also== *Island Special Constabulary Force *Jamaica Rural Police Force (District Constable) *Jamaica Police Federation *Crime in Jamaica ==References== ==External links== * Jamaica Constabulary Force * Island Special Constabulary Force (auxiliary ) Category:Law enforcement in Jamaica Category:1716 establishments in Jamaica ",
