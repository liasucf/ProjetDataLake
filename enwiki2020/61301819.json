At the time, the album had produced two singles: \"Make It Sweet\" and \"One Man Band\", the latter of which the band debuted on Good Morning America following the release announcement. The band promoted the album throughout 2019 on the Make It Sweet Tour. On August 7, 2020, the band released a \"meow mix\" of the album, featuring all of the vocals replaced with the word \"meow\". ==Critical reception== Giving it 4 out of 5 stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that \" Old Dominion aren't ashamed that they provide music for romance and relaxation, and the fact that they don't seem to be trying quite so hard this third time around makes their eponymous album feel natural and, yes, more like themselves.\" ==Commercial performance== Old Dominion debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 with 31,000 album-equivalent units, including 19,000 pure album sales. It is Old Dominion's second US top-10 album. It has a further 5,000 in pure album sales the second week.
