Covering a land area of 1,300 mu, the university is divided into three branches. ==History== School gate. Anhui University of Science and Technology (the predecessor of the university, namely, Bengbu Advanced Industrial and Professional Training School of Anhui Province) was founded in 1945. It was one of two institutions of higher education in the then Anhui Province. The school was renamed \"Hefei Mining Institute\" in 1955, and moved to Hefei the same year, and again renamed \"Hefei University of Technology\" in 1958. In 1971 the Department of Geology and the Department of Mining Engineering were established in the university and then moved to Huainan City completely, together with some teachers of the Department of Basic Courses, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, on the basis of which established Huainan Coal Mine Institute. The institute was renamed \"Huainan Mining Institute\" in 1981. In 1993 the former East China Medical School merged into the institute, which was renamed \"Huainan Institute of Technology\" in 1997. Since 1998 the university has come under the Province instead of the former Ministry of Coal Industry of the state due to the readjustment of the organs of the State Council. In 2000, Huainan School of Chemical Engineering, a junior school of the former Ministry of Chemical Engineering of the country, merged into the university according to the resolution of the Provincial Government. In February, 2002 the university adopted the present name authorized by the State Education Commission. In September 2016, the new campus located in the new Shannan District, was opened, dwarfing the old campus in size.
