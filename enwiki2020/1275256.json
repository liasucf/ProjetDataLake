    "text": "One True Voice were a British boy band created on the ITV television series Popstars: The Rivals. In the show, pop groups of both genders were created through a public vote and competed in the UK Singles Chart for the 2002 Christmas number one single. In the contest, One True Voice with their No. 2 double A-side \"Sacred Trust / After You're Gone\" lost out to girl group Girls Aloud and their No. 1 single \"Sound of the Underground\". One True Voice released a further single in 2003 before acrimoniously splitting in August without having released an album. ==Members== The group, who were sometimes referred to as OTV for short, was made up of \u2013 * Anton Gordon (from Neasden, London, England), * Matt Johnson (from Mancot, Wales), * Daniel Pearce (from Ashford, Kent, England), * Keith Semple (from Larne, Northern Ireland), and * Jamie Shaw (from Cardiff, Wales). ==Band members' activities after OTV== ===Anton Gordon=== * Anton Gordon auditioned for The X Factor in 2006, but did not make it through the preliminary screening.. He continues with musical projects under the name of Anton Romero, including a joint single with Winta entitled \"Hot Romance (Rok With You)\". ===Matt Johnson=== * Matt Johnson signed a solo contract with Jive Records after One True Voice, but left the label after being unhappy with the music direction and is currently signed to his own record label Tristar Records which has a distribution deal with Believe Digital since 2013. Matt released a single Get Over You on 29 July 2016, produced by Steve Power ===Daniel Pearce=== * Daniel Pearce played a lead role in the musical Jailhouse Rock in London's West End. Pearce auditioned for the 6th series of The X Factor in 2009, by singing Seal's \"Kiss From a Rose\". He made it through the auditions, boot camp (singing Prince's \"Purple Rain\") and eventually made it to Judges' Houses (singing George Michael's \"Praying for Time\"). His mentor Simon Cowell, however, did not choose him for the finals. He was a backing singer for Dizzee Rascal when he performed on Jools Hollands 2009/2010 Hootenanny and also on the Top of The Pops 2009 show when he sang on the track \"Holiday\".

In 2013 he launched his own new band SEMPLE focusing on his original music and in 2015 appeared in the season 9 of the American series The Voice as part of Team Adam. In the Battle Round, Semple paired against Manny Cabo. In the Knockout Round, Semple paired against Dustin Christensen. ===Jamie Shaw=== * Jamie Shaw continued to produce music.
