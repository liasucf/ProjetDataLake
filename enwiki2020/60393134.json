The collection includes manuscripts, books, records, journals, letters, and antique works of art. In 1938, the Y\u014dmei Bunko Foundation was established in its current location near Ninnaji Temple in northwest Kyoto by Fumimaro Konoe (\u8fd1\u885b\u6587\u9ebf, 1891 - 1945), then head of the family and prime minister of Japan.https://rmda.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/collection/konoe Materials preserved in the archive illustrate over 1,000 years of Japan's history, ranging from the \"Mid\u014d Kanpaku-ki\",http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication- and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full- list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/midokanpakuki-the- original-handwritten-diary-of-fujiwara-no-michinaga/ the diary in his own hand of Fujiwara no Michinaga (\u85e4\u539f\u9053\u9577, 966 - 1028), one of the ancestors of the Konoe family, to 20th century materials relating to Fumimaro Konoe himself. The work of the archive includes making the collection available to researchers, conducting its own research, loaning items to exhibitions, and publishing facsimiles.Nawa Osamu, 2016, pp 1, 25Nawa Tomohiko, 2016, pp 262-264 In April 2012, Y\u014dmei Bunko changed its legal status to become a public interest incorporated foundation.Nawa Osamu, 2016, p 26 ==The Konoe family and Y\u014dmei Bunko== Konoe Fumimaro, founder of Y\u014dmei Bunko Konoe Fumimaro, founder of Y\u014dmei Bunko The Konoe family (\u8fd1\u885b\u5bb6) is a branch of the Northern Fujiwara (Fujiwara Hokke, \u85e4\u539f\u5317\u5bb6). In the 12th century, the Fujiwara Clan monopolized the highest offices of state. Fujiwara no Tadamichi (\u85e4\u539f\u5fe0\u901a, 1097 - 1164) served as sessh\u014d (\u6442\u653f, regent), kanpaku (\u95a2\u767d, imperial advisor) and daij\u014d-daijin (\u592a\u653f\u5927\u81e3, grand minister). The Konoe branch of the Fujiwara began with Tadamichi\u2019s eldest son, Konoe Motozane (\u8fd1\u885b\u57fa\u5b9f, 1143 - 1166). Tadamichi\u2019s third son, Kuj\u014d Kanezane (\u4e5d\u6761\u517c\u5b9f, 1149 - 1207) founded the Kuj\u014d family (\u4e5d\u6761\u5bb6). Later, the Takatsukasa (\u9df9\u53f8\u5bb6) split from the Konoe, and the Nij\u014d (\u4e8c\u6761\u5bb6) and Ichij\u014d (\u4e00\u6761\u5bb6) from the Kuj\u014d. These families would become known as the five regent houses.Nawa Osamu, 2016, pp 10-11 Successive heads of the Konoe family preserved many important documents, from family diaries to records of imperial court rituals and ceremonies. These were men who occupied the highest offices of the land, often as sessh\u014d or kanpaku, throughout the Heian period. Although they had no official authority after the Heian gave way to the Kamakura period, the Konoe family continued to retain great influence as a regent house, deeply involved with court ritual and ceremony. The commitment to preserving the family legacy of important records grew from this long history of leading roles in both government and at court.Nawa Osamu, 2016, p 11 From generation to generation, the heads of the Konoe family, themselves usually both highly cultured and artistically accomplished, continued to organize and add to the collection.Nawa Osamu, 2016, p 11 The 13th head of the family, Konoe Masaie (\u8fd1\u885b\u653f\u5bb6, 1445 \u2013 1505), served as kanpaku and daij\u014d-daijin during the upheavals of the Sengoku, or Warring States, period. During the \u014cnin and Bunmei wars, he sent 50 boxes of the family records for safekeeping to Iwakura, on the northern outskirts of Kyoto. This ensured that, when the Konoe family mansion was burned down in the \u014cnin War, the records survived.Nawa Osamu, 2016, p 23 The 16th head of the family, Konoe Sakihisa (\u8fd1\u885b\u524d\u4e45, pen name \u9f8d\u5c71, ry\u016bzan, 1536 - 1612), was serving as kanpaku during the Honn\u014d-ji Incident that led to the collapse of the Ashikaga shogunate and the ascendancy of the Tokugawa. As kanpaku, he went on to form an alliance with Uesugi Kenshin, taking part in campaigns fought in Echigo and Kanto provinces. Despite living through one of Japan's most chaotic periods, Sakihisa found time to devote himself to cultural pursuits, becoming not only a renowned calligrapher, but also the leading waka and renga poet of his day.\"Courtly Millenium \u2212 Art Treasures from the Konoe Family Collection\", p 233 The 17th head of the family, Konoe Nobutada (\u8fd1\u885b\u4fe1\u5c39, 1565 \u2013 1614, in later life known as \u4e09\u85d0\u9662, Sanmyakuin), was one of the Kan'ei Sanpitsu (\u5bdb\u6c38\u4e09\u7b46, the \"Three brushes of Kan\u2019ei\"), the pre-eminent calligraphers of the period.\"Courtly Millenium \u2212 Art Treasures from the Konoe Family Collection\", p 234 Nobutada had no heir, so he adopted his nephew Konoe Nobuhiro (\u8fd1\u885b\u4fe1\u5c0b, \u014czan (\u5fdc\u5c71) 1599\u20131649), who was the fourth son of Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei. Nobuhiro was also a man of high culture, notably skilled in calligraphy, tea ceremony, and renga poetry.\"Courtly Millenium \u2212 Art Treasures from the Konoe Family Collection\", p 236 In the mid Edo period, the 21st head of the family, Konoe Iehiro (\u8fd1\u885b\u5bb6\u7188, 1667 \u2013 1736, pen name \u4e88\u697d\u9662, Yoraku-in) was also famed for his artistic accomplishments as calligrapher and tea master. Iehiro compiled the \u014ctekagami, an album of outstanding works of calligraphy from all ages that is now a National Treasure, and also personally hand-copied a large number of old calligraphic masterpieces that are only known to us today through Iehiro\u2019s transcriptions.\"Courtly Millenium \u2212 Art Treasures from the Konoe Family Collection\", p 87 On several occasions in modern times, beginning from 1900, this ancient family collection was entrusted to the Kyoto University Library (then the Kyoto Imperial University Library). Finally, Fumimaro Konoe, while serving as prime minister in the troubled times before and during the Second World War, decided to establish the Y\u014dmei Bunko Foundation in 1938 as a permanent repository for his family\u2019s historical archive. The name Y\u014dmei was taken from an alternative name for the Konoe family which derived from the Y\u014dmeimon Gate, one of the 12 gates to the imperial palace outer grounds, inside which stood the old Konoe mansion.Nawa Osamu, 2016, pp 11, 24, 25 The Y\u014dmei Bunko occupies an approximately 8,550m2 site in the Rakusai district, close to Ninna-ji Temple. In addition to the original buildings, two repositories and a reading room/office building, the Sukiya style Kozans\u014d was added in 1944. Important examples of Showa period architecture, these have all been registered as National Tangible Cultural Assets. Most of the grounds lie within one of Kyoto's Preservation Districts for Groups of Historic Buildings, and adjoining the site to the north is a 28,916m2 forested hilly area containing numerous ponds also destined for preservation as a protected environment and landscape.Nawa Tomohiko, 2016, p269 The library collection contains many significant historical journals written by court nobility in addition to the Mid\u014d Kanpaku-ki diary of Fujiwara no Michinaga. There are letters written in their own hand by emperors and prominent historical figures, items related to court ceremonies and ritual, old manuscripts relating ancient legends and imperial poetry collections. In addition to being an invaluable historical resource, the collection also represents a unique history of the art of calligraphy. While many of the ancestral treasures of the old aristocratic and daimy\u014d families were lost in the aftermath of the Second World War, this legacy of the Konoe family survived thanks to the timely establishment of the foundation, a fact that makes the collection even more uniquely valuable. Exhibits are displayed in a room on the upper floor of the library, although as a rule this is not open to the general public without a letter of introduction. Facsimiles of major documents are regularly published in editions of the Y\u014dmei S\u014dsho. ==Cultural properties== ===National treasures=== * \"Mido Kanpaku-ki\" (Diary of Fujiwara no Michinaga) set of 26 handscrolls (14 original, 12 transcribed) Attachments: \"Abstract of the Mid\u014d Regent\u2019s Diary\" 5 handscrolls, and \"Catalog of the Mid\u014d Regent\u2019s Calendar\" 1 hanging scroll.
