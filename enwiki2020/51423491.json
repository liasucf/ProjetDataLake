He lectured several universities including Istanbul Uni on a peaceful solution to Jammu Kashmir. He got a Master in social sciences and diploma of journalism from London. He authored several books including Islamic diplomacy and human rights and also translated several books. He regularly writes a column titled \"Haq-Gohi\" meaning Speaking the Truth and occasionally contributes to local and international English dailies. He is well travelled. Raja served more than 22 years in UK prison extrajudicially, where he was kept in prison by the Home Secretary for an alleged involvement in the killing of an Indian diplomat.A Summary of Quayyum Raja\u2019s Profile He was not found guilty of kidnapping while the sentence on killing was given secretly only to be quashed by the London High Court. He was still not released. Eventually, the European Court of Human Rights released Raja in 2005, on what appeared to be a politically motivated sentence, and removed the British Home Secretary's discretionary powers to interfere with the judiciary. The killer of the diplomat is still at large. He was kidnapped by a group of Kashmiris in an attempt to prevent the Indian government to hang the Maqbool Butt, the founding father of the independence movement of Jammu Kashmir. Quayyum Raja disagrees over many things happening in both Indian and Pakistani controlled Jammu and Kashmir and demands the withdraw of Indian and Pakistani troops from Jammu Kashmir. He has set up a Human Rights Commission demanding social, political, educational and legal reforms in Pakistani controlled Jammu Kashmir. He has successfully forced the AJK Assembly to introduce the AJK textbook board and has now taken the government to High Court for not allowing Kashmir Study to be taught in Pakistan administered Kashmir. Although he believes in a peaceful struggle, he suggests there is no peace without justice, coining a slogan: \u201cPeace With Justice.\u201d ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People convicted of murder by the United Kingdom Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by the United Kingdom ",
