The handaxes are bifacially-worked and in the shape of a rounded triangle. They are only found in Britain in the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) interglacial between 59,000 and 41,000 years BP, and are therefore considered a unique diagnostic variant. ==References== ==External links== * Neanderthal handaxe, Hantsweb Category:Archaeological artefact types ",
