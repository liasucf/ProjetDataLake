Hyperreligiosity may also include religious hallucinations. Hyperreligiosity can also be common among individuals who have intense atheistic beliefs. ==Pathophysiology and cause== Hyperreligiosity may be associated with epilepsy \u2013 in particular temporal lobe epilepsy involving complex partial seizures \u2013 mania, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, hallucinogen related psychosis and psychotic disorder. In persons with epilepsy episodic hyperreligosity may occur ictally or postictally, but is usually a chronic personality feature that occurs interictally. Hyperreligiosity was associated in one small study with decreased right hippocampal volume. Increased activity in the left temporal regions has been associated with hyperreligiosity in psychotic disorders. Pharmacological evidence points towards dysfunction in the ventral dopaminergic pathway. ==Treatment== Epilepsy related cases may respond to antiepileptics. ==References== == External links == Category:Psychiatric diagnosis Category:Religion and health ",
