It borders Brazil to the north and east, Cerro Largo Department to the southeast, Tacuaremb\u00f3 Department to the south and west and Salto Department to the northwest. == History == The first division of the Republic in six departments happened in 1816. Two more departments were formed later that year. At that time, Paysand\u00fa Department included all the territory north of the R\u00edo Negro, which included the present-day departments of Artigas, Rivera, Tacuaremb\u00f3, Salto, Paysand\u00fa and R\u00edo Negro. On 17 June 1837 a new division of Uruguay was made and this territory was divided in three parts. In the new division, the Tacuaremb\u00f3 Department included also the present department of Rivera, until it was split from it in 1884. On 7 May 1862 the village Pueblo de Ceballos was created, in honour of the Spanish viceroy Pedro de Cevallos. In July 1867 it took on the official name \"Rivera\". The Brazilian town Santana do Livramento already existed just across the border. On 1 October 1884, it became capital of the newly formed Department of Rivera by the Act of Ley N\u00ba 1.757. ==Geography== Topographic map of Rivera Department showing main populated places and roads Along the eastern borders of the department with Cerro Largo Department flows R\u00edo Negro, with its tributaries flowing through the easternmost part of the department.
