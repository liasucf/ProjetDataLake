In August 2007 the old platform surfaces were resurfaced, new shelters and a railway crossing were added, and Platform 1 (Havant bound) was extended to make it suitable for longer trains. ==Services== The station is located on a section of line which is common to the Portsmouth Direct Line from London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour and the West Coastway Line from Brighton to Southampton. Although the nearest station westward is Cosham, until 2007 there were no direct services calling at both Cosham and Bedhampton. Passengers between these two stations had to travel to Hilsea or Fratton, both south of Bedhampton on the Portsmouth line, and change trains there. Today South Western Railway operate a very limited late evening service between the two stations. The station is also served by Southern. The typical off-peak service is as follows: *2tph to *1tph to *1tph to ==Gallery== File:Bedhampton Station Up P1010023.jpg|Platform 1 (up) File:Bedhampton Railway Station P1010022.jpg|Platform 2 (down), with ticket office File:BHStn5P1010008.jpg|View southwestward from the level crossing Image:Class 444 at Bedhampton Station.jpg|A train arrives from Havant Image:Havant & Portsmouth RJD 11.jpg|A 1910 Railway Clearing House map of lines around Bedhampton railway station File:Bedhampton Halt geograph-3259055-by-Ben- Brooksbank.jpg|Bedhampton Halt, 1968 Category:Bedhampton Category:Railway stations in Hampshire Category:Former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1906 Category:Railway stations served by Southern Category:Railway stations served by South Western Railway ",
