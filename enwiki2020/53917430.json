Unlike a trade union or a professional association, membership in a professional order is not a faculty, but an obligation for the professional, since registration in the order is a necessary condition for the practice of the profession. Such associations have existed since before the 16th century; for example, the Royal College of Physicians received its charter in 1518, with the \"power to grant licenses to those with actual qualifications and to punish unqualified practitioners and those engaging in malpractice\". In France, the oldest professional orders are the \"bars\" (in French: \"Barreau\"), which were created in the 17th century.Histoire du barreau de Paris . Medical orders are more recent, but the creation of the Order of Physicians in France in 1940 is the culmination of fifty years of claim. The one in Belgium was created in 1938 while its Quebec counterpart, the Coll\u00e8ge des m\u00e9decins du Qu\u00e9bec (Quebec College of Physicians) (CMQ), dates back to 1847. A professional order is a legal person governed by private law with a public service mission,Conseil d'Etat, 2 April 1943 Bouguen; and in particular Articles L.4125-1 and L.4321-19 of the Public Health Code. constituted by a law defining its public function and by an implementing decree taken by the Council of State Gives its status. Under the pressure of the World Trade Organization, relayed by the European Union, many liberal professions tend to be deregulated being seen as obstacles to free trade. On the other hand, many lobby groups propose that certain professions should be supervised by a professional order for a better protection of the public. In addition, some professional associations claim the status of a professional order in order to demonstrate their professionalism and to distinguish themselves from professions not controlled by the professional system.Since its creation in 1973, the Office des professions du Qu\u00e9bec has received numerous requests from various groups to the effect that their profession is supervised under the status of professional order. == Missions == A professional order may carry out the following duties: * Regulation of access to the profession (verification of the professional qualification, possibly validation of diplomas) and its follow-up (keeping of registration registers of members); * Contribution to lifelong learning or, more simply, monitoring of the obligation of continuing education; * Representation of the profession vis-\u00e0- vis the public authorities; * Promotion of the profession through the media and schools and universities; * To organize competition among its members on a fair, non-venal and respectful basis, while limiting concentrations and dominant positions; * A judicial function, with a Disciplinary Council in which a Councilor of State is sitting and whose decisions are under appeal by the administrative courts, these decisions may be recommendations, warnings, reprimands, suspension, delisting, liquidation and Under ordinary administration, in the event of a violation of the code of ethics of the profession; * Arbitration to resolve conflicts of interpretation relating to agreements between a professional and his client on the basis of the documents he advocates or between two members; * More generally, control of the respect of patients and clients in the defense of the general interest. An order is not a union. They are not in opposition but complement each other. While the union defends the interests of professionals only, the council promotes the interests of the profession. The latter may, for example, in disciplinary training, punish a professional who behaves contrary to the interests of the profession, which is absolutely not the case with trade unions. In addition, the council of public order has powers of public authority which enable it to take administrative decisions, unlike unions whose powers are strictly governed by private law. In the Canadian province of Quebec, a superior body oversees the proper functioning of each of the orders: the Office des professions du Qu\u00e9bec.Bienvenue sur notre site!, OPQ == In France == In France, sixteen professions are regulated by an ordinal structure.
