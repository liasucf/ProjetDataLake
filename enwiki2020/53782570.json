    "text": "The Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region is a combined authority mayor or 'metro mayor', who chairs the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The first, and current, officeholder is Steve Rotheram, who was elected to the post in May 2017. The office was created under the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016 which allowed for the creation of 'Metro mayors' to lead combined authorities in England. ==Powers and responsibilities== In March 2019 Steve Rotheram requested that the Police and crime commissioner role for the Merseyside Police be incorporated into the role of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, in line with the powers of the Greater Manchester and London mayors, who have authority and oversight over Greater Manchester Police and the Metropolitan Police Service respectively. This was supported by the leader of Knowsley Borough Council. However, the Liverpool City Region is not the same area as the Merseyside Police area, which does not include Halton. ==References== Liverpool City Region Category:Local government in Merseyside Category:Directly elected mayors in England and Wales ",
