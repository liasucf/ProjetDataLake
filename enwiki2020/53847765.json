The temple is located west from the Kohombana junction of Ampara - Mahaoya main road, approximately away from the Ampara town. The monastery has been formally recognised by the Government as an archaeological site in Sri Lanka. It is believed that this temple complex was constructed by the king Saddha Tissa (137-119 BC) of Anuradhapura. During the recent history the site had been neglected due to the activities of Tamil Taiger separatist in the region. With the end of the civil war, the Hermitage was again accessible to the people. A large number of drip ledged caves with Pre Christian Brahmi cave inscriptions have been found on the slope of the eastern side of the Samangala mountain. An inscribed sketch in one cave illustrates a Stupa similar to the style of Sanchi Stupa in India. ==References== ==External links== * *Samangala Cave *Samangala cave Category:Buddhist temples in Ampara District Category:Buddhist caves in Sri Lanka Category:Archaeological protected monuments in Ampara District ",
