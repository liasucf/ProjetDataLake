It is one of the largest regional campuses of Tribhuvan University that caters to thousands of students. It provides undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate degrees in Science, Humanities and Business studies, among others. Established in 1981, it is located in ward no. 2 of Hetauda sub metropolitan municipality. The campus is run by the Campus Management Committee comprising the Chief District Officer of Makawanpur District and representatives from major political parties, Makawanpur District Development Committee, Hetauda municipal council, district chamber of commerce, Narayani Transport Enterprise Association as well as other distinguished members of the civil society. As of February 2018, Dormani Poudel, who was later elected as the Chief minister of Bagmati Pradesh, was the Chairperson of the Committee, having been in the role for years. As of 2019, the faculty consisted of 92 professors in total. Dormani Poudel, in 2019, revealed that an expert committee had recommended the campus for upgrade into a University. In 2007, two new buildings, one of them the college library, constructed using the grant (amounting to Rs. 20.36 million) from the Government of India came into operation. They were inaugurated by the then Indian ambassador to Nepal Shiv Shankar Mukherjee. The campus is a venue for vibrant student politics, mainly among affiliate student unions of major political parties. It is one of the largest colleges by voter turnout in student union elections, officially conducted by Tribhuvan University. ANNFSU leader Kumar KC is the incumbent president of the campus student union. Student protests often take a violent turn in the campus. In August 2015, students affiliated to CPN (Maoist Centre) started fire in the offices of the chair and vice-chair by throwing Molotov cocktail, during a meeting of the Campus Management Committee. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Tribhuvan University Category:Education in Nepal ",
