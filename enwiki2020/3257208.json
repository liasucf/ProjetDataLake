He was Minister of Economy under Jorge Rafael Videla's administration between 1976 and 1981, and shaped economic policy at the National Reorganization Process. The spirit of all the reforms implemented during his administration was the liberalization of the economy. Precisely, economic freedom, a principle that is occasionally criticized in Argentina depending of the time. ==Biography== Mart\u00ednez de Hoz, scion of one Argentina's oldest cattle ranching families, was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pursuing higher studies at the University of Cambridge, he returned and in 1955, following the coup against President Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, he was appointed his province's Minister of the Economy of Buenos Aires Province. ==Minister of Economy with Guido== Though democracy returned to Argentina three years later, the armed forces continued to exercise vetting power over most policy and in 1963, Mart\u00ednez de Hoz became one of a series of conservative Argentine Economy Ministers during Jose Maria Guido's brief presidency (an interlude marked by squabbles among the military brass and recession). ==Private career== Becoming an influential lobbyist for Acindar, one of Argentina's largest steel manufacturers, Mart\u00ednez de Hoz became its CEO in 1968. Seven years later, after union labourers at Acindar's Villa Constituci\u00f3n plant elected a socialist shop steward, Mart\u00ednez de Hoz retaliated by using his family's long-standing connections with the armed forces to have them brutally repressed. Supported by Metalworkers Union leader Lorenzo Miguel, security forces abducted the new shop steward, Alberto Piccinini, and about 300 others (most of whom were murdered).Significativa propuesta realizada a Acindar ==Minister of Economy under Videla's administration== By 1975, Argentina had considerably developed, but was nevertheless in the throes of some of the worst instability since 1930. Argentine public opinion turned to the military, who deposed Isabel Per\u00f3n's weak regime in a March 1976 coup.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jorge- Rafael-Videla Inheriting a wave of violence and 700% inflation, Jorge Rafael Videla called on Mart\u00ednez de Hoz as Minister of Economy.https://www.britannica.com/place/Argentina/Military-government-1966-73 Anxious to restore business confidence, announced a plan to further open Argentina's markets, believing that the country's national industry was inefficient and uncompetitive internationally. He moved to lessen Argentina's trade barriers quickly, which he believed to be a cause of economic isolation. He enjoyed the personal friendship of David Rockefeller, who facilitated Chase Manhattan Bank and International Monetary Fund loans of nearly US$1 billion following his appointment.https://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/lo-que-pienso-de- martinez-de-hoz/ He eliminated all price control systems. The black market and shortages disappeared; and he repealed the exchange control regime. A single floating exchange rate was born.http://martinezdehoz.com/words/Los_anios_de_Martinez_de_Hoz_por_Juan_Alemann.pdf He freed exports (removed existing prohibitions and quotas and export taxes were repealed) and imports (removed existing prohibitions, quotas, and licenses and gradually reduced import tariffs).http://martinezdehoz.com/politica_economica.php He decreed a general freeze on wages, and instituted a value-added tax while rescinding the inheritance tax. As a result of the changes instituted by Mart\u00ednez de Hoz, inflation fell sharply; but, many local retailers and home builders became incapable of coping with the fall in demand and declared bankruptcy.Lewis, Paul.The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism. University of North Carolina Press, 1990. He eliminated political tariffs for public services and subsidized prices for fuels, to begin an honest look at the economy and the subsidies and overprotections for privileged sectors of the economy. A year later, the billion-dollar trade deficit had turned around and business investment had soared by about 25%. However, real wages had lost nearly 40% of their purchasing power, and while consumer spending remained weak, the shock might have been worse but for hitherto high savings rates. Inflation revived again, and Mart\u00ednez de Hoz responded in June 1977, with deregulation of the financial markets, removing checks on banks and transferring responsibility for any bad loans to the state, which took charge of their debt as needed.Crawley, Eduardo. Argentina: A House Divided. St. Martin's Press, 1985. The Central Bank, like many key economic posts in the Mart\u00ednez de Hoz era, was led by one of a number of Chicago Boys: Adolfo Diz. Diz enacted much of the Economy Minister's financial deregulation policy, while moving to limit domestic credit. He enacted the Monetary Regulation Account Law of 1977, which raised reserve requirements to 45% of deposits, thereby doubling borrowers' interest rates while eliminating yields on demand deposits.de Pablo, Juan Carlos. Economists and Economic Policy: Argentina since 1958. Total GDP grew 2.2% equivalent annually between 1975 and 1980. Between 1975 and 1979 there was a trade surplus, only in 1980 did the trade deficit appear. During the period, the lowest unemployment rates in the history of the Argentine economy were observed. Particularly from 1979, as a consequence of the second oil shock, the external debt increased strongly.http://www.martinezdehoz.com/words/mhoz_nicolas_marquez.pdf Years later he explained in his books that his management \"had a 'gradualist' character; he set out to implement a structural reform of the economy, and not just overcome a crisis. On April 2, 1976, three programs were announced: liberation and modernization of the economy, modernization of the state and stabilization of prices. They would have to be applied interconnected, although not necessarily simultaneously. The great courses of action were the subsidiary function of the State and the opening of the economy.\"\u201dhttp://www.martinezdehoz.com/words/Libro_De_Pablo.pdf Short-term financial speculation flourished, while chronic tax evasion and budget deficits remained high. Frequent wage freeze decrees continued to depress living standards generally and income inequality increased. During his tenure, the foreign debt increased fourfold, and disparities between the upper and lower classes became much more pronounced.Lewis, Paul.The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism. University of North Carolina Press, 1990. The period ended in a tenfold devaluation and one of the worst financial crises in Argentine history.Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth, World Bank Press, 1993. ===\"Sweet money\"=== Again in recession by 1978, the economy continued to be saddled with inflation around 175%. Image-conscious and so, fearful of possible riots, Mart\u00ednez de Hoz relented and in December, he issued new, more generous wage guidelines. To address his fellow conservatives' fear that this might lead to even higher inflation, he introduced a novel take on the currency crawling peg: fixed, progressively smaller devaluations of the official exchange rate between the Argentine peso and the US dollarset by a monthly timetable, popularly known as the Tablita. The Tablita invariably set a slower depreciation of the peso value than what local inflation warranted and although inflation did ease somewhat, imported goods and foreign credit soon became much cheaper than those locally available. Imports almost tripled in volume and by 1980, the peso became one of the most overvalued currencies in the world; its high purchasing power abroad soon had many referring to it as sweet money. Record numbers of Argentines now vacationed abroad, often stocking up on appliances; between the suddenly negative trade deficit and tourists' foreign spending, however, this chalked up a then-record US$4 billion annual loss for the national balance sheet in both 1980 and 1981. Having already suffered from weakened demand, many industries (particularly smaller factories) could not compete with the flood of imports and a second wave of industry bankruptcies began. Ostensibly to avoid a sharp rise in unemployment, Mart\u00ednez de Hoz took an even more controversial step when he decided to begin absorbing private sector debts (mostly those of the well- connected, including US$700 million of Acindar's)Inversiones millonarias en medio de los cortes de energ\u00eda into the national debt. One of his chief business interests, the insolvent Compa\u00f1\u00eda Italo Argentina de Electricidad, was nationalised at his orders at a reported cost of US$394 million.Buenos Aires Econ\u00f3mico: La saga de los Mart\u00ednez de Hoz The economy was still in relatively high gear and, with rising fiscal revenues, the nation's finances appeared healthy during 1979 and 1980. Secretly, however (as much of this data was censored at time), local speculators were taking advantage of the overvalued peso by taking up over US$30 billion in loans overseas.National Geographic Magazine. Argentina's New Beginning, August 1986. This money soon found itself in risky gambles at home and abroad and when one bank's Ponzi scheme collapsed in March 1980, Mart\u00ednez de Hoz responded to the possible panic by luring investors with one-year treasury bills, paying 60% in US dollars. Facing these pressures, the Argentine peso increasingly became the object of short-selling by insiders, including Mart\u00ednez de Hoz himself. ===Circular 1050 and the shattered Tablita=== Mart\u00ednez de Hoz addresses the nation in a 12 March 1981, farewell address The end of his tenure soon near and increasingly unpopular, in April 1980 Mart\u00ednez de Hoz had the Central Bank promulgate new regulations governing adjustable loans. The Central Bank Circular 1050 tied monthly loan interest payments (almost all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable basis) to the value of the US dollar vis-a-vis the peso. Borrowers were confident that the gradual peso devaluations would continue on schedule and new homeowners rushed to secure (or refinance) mortgages at these favourable terms. Brokerage houses proliferated as put options against the peso increased sharply and in February 1981, Mart\u00ednez de Hoz announced the unthinkable: the time had come for a sharp devaluation. The Tablita was shattered and he retired the following month. What followed was one of the worst financial crises in the history of modern Argentina. Speculators quickly took advantage of the 1977 deregulation to write off their debts, legitimate borrowers (including many large employers) were faced with suddenly unaffordable US dollar payments and homeowners' monthly payments (tied by the Circular 1050 to the value of the Dollar), rose by over tenfold during the next fifteen months.Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth. World Bank Press, 1993. ==Legacy== It took defeat during the disastrous Malvinas War in June 1982, to usher in more moderate leadership in the junta. In July, the new Central Bank President, Domingo Cavallo, rescinded the hated \"1050\". Thousands were saved from financial ruin by this change, but the economic damage would remain. Business confidence was destroyed by the whole calamity and even though Argentina's productive Agricultural sector brought in over US$34 billion in trade surpluses over the next eight years, none of it sufficed to deal with chronic capital flight or the newly monstrous public debt (US$7 billion at the start of the dictatorship, it had grown to US$43 billion by the time of the restoration of democracy in 1983). 1983 general elections Mart\u00ednez de Hoz was himself indicted in 1988 for his involvement in the human rights abuses at Acindar and spent 77 days in jail. Quickly freed, he finally benefited from a pardon by President Carlos Menem in 1990. Returning to world of high finance despite a 1992 conviction of operating a brokerage with a revoked licence, Mart\u00ednez de Hoz became a member of the board of directors of two Arbitrage houses: Rohm Group and the Banco General de Negocios (\"General Business Bank\"). The General Business Bank, now defunct, later helped clients illegally wire up to US$30 billion out of the country prior to its December 2001 financial crisis.Atlas Escolar In 2006, a judge declared the pardon unconstitutional and revoked the suspension of the judicial process dictated before, thus leaving the way open to investigate Mart\u00ednez de Hoz's alleged involvement in the kidnapping and extortion of Federico and Miguel Gutheim (a local textile mill owner and his son) in 1976, as well as the murder of Juan Carlos Casariego (one of his own assistants at the Ministry of Economy). Martinez de Hoz was arrested on 5 April 2007, following a Supreme Court ruling deeming the 1990 presidential pardons unconstitutional,Argentina arrests former dictator's top money man (AFP) and was given a preliminary sentence of house arrest (due to his advanced age) on 4 May 2010, pursuant to his indictment in the Gutheim case.InfoBAE: Mart\u00ednez de Hoz fue trasladado a su domicilio tras recibir el alta ==References== * La dictadura militar en Argentina on the Ministry of Education website. * Una pesada herencia, by Ernesto Hadida. * * ==External links== Category:1925 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from Salta Category:Argentine Ministers of Finance Category:Argentine businesspeople Category:Operatives of the Dirty War Category:Prisoners and detainees of Argentina Category:Recipients of Argentine presidential pardons Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Argentine anti-communists Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Argentine politicians convicted of crimes ",
