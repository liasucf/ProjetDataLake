It is near the downtown loop, between Paseo and Chestnut Trafficway to the west and east, and Independence Avenue and Cliff Drive to the south and north. Pendleton Heights is one of the oldest specifically residentially- designed neighborhoods in Kansas City, preceded only by Quality Hill. It was Kansas City's first developed suburb, platted in the late nineteenth century from what had been the Jones Farm. Accordingly, the neighborhood is recognized by the City of Kansas City as a historic district. The neighborhood has three city parks (North Terrace Park, Independence Plaza Park and Maple Park), the original city reservoir, one of only two nationally listed urban scenic byways, and the largest collection of true Victorian homes in the City. Architectural styles include \"Traditional Victorian\", American Craftsman, American Foursquare, Italianate, Eastlake, Shingle-Style, Richardsonian Romanesque, \"Folk Victorian\", \"Kansas City Shirtwaist\", Beaux Arts, and grand Queen Anne. The neighborhood includes a castle on the bluffs (\"Tiffany Castle\") overlooking the East Bottoms and the Missouri River below. One home, the Philip E. Chappell house at 1836 Pendleton Avenue, has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1990. Pendleton Heights hosts an annual Holiday Homes Tour and Artist Market on the first Saturday of December. Select Victorian homes decorated for the holiday season are open for tour, and neighborhood artists set up booths with items available for sale. In 2013, Pendleton Heights was featured by This Old House as one of their \"Best Old House Neighborhoods in the US\". The Pendleton Heights Community Garden launched in early 2013. This project is in partnership with PHNA, Kansas City Community Gardens and MU Extension. The garden occupies a formerly vacant parcel at Brooklyn and Minnie in the heart of the neighborhood. Residents can lease plots in the garden for personal gardening or work in community plots in exchange for a share of the harvest. In the summer of 2013, PHNA reached an agreement with KC Parks & Recreation to plant an orchard on the vacant lot at Lexington and Montgall. In addition to providing fresh fruit and nuts for the neighborhood, this orchard will also provide a history lesson \u2013 the selected tree varieties represent trees grown in Northeast Kansas City as far back as 1860. Varieties include peaches, apples, figs, pecans, pawpaws, serviceberries and more. The neighborhood is home to Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences. The neighborhood is home to Jerusalem Farm, a Catholic intentional community whose mission is to \"make ourselves available to the needs of our community. The main way that we do this is through addressing home repair needs and coordinating volunteers from Kansas City and around the country.\" Jerusalem Farm offers weekly curbside composting to the residents of Pendleton Heights. The neighborhood is home to Scuola Vita Nuova Charter School and Garfield Elementary School. ==See also== *List of neighborhoods in Kansas City, Missouri == References == ==External links== *Pendleton Heights Neighborhood Association Web site *This Old House *Jerusalem Farms *Map: Category:Neighborhoods in Kansas City, Missouri ",
