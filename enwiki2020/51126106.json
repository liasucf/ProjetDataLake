In their 15th season under head coach Herb Deromedi, the Chippewas compiled a 5\u20136 record (4\u20135 against MAC opponents), finished in seventh place in the MAC, and outscored their opponents, 247 to 170. The team played its home games in Kelly/Shorts Stadium in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, with attendance of 96,417 in five home games.2015 Media Guide, p. 87. The highlight of Central Michigan's 1992 season was its defeat of Michigan State for the second consecutive year. The Chippewas had opened the season with a loss to Kentucky before defeating the Spartans, 24\u201320, at Spartan Stadium on September 12, 1992. Central Michigan quarterback Joe Youngblood, who had been denied a scholarship offer by Michigan State, led the Chippewas by completing 17 of 22 passes for 163 yards and two touchdowns and also catching a pass for 29 yards on a trick play. In a key defensive stand for the Chippewas in the second quarter, Michigan State tailback Craig Thomas fumbled the ball at Central's one-yard line after being hit by Chippewa defensive back Darrall Stinson, and Oscar Ford recovered the ball in the end zone for the Chippewas. In the third quarter, Michigan State kicker Jim DelVerne missed a 31-yard field goal attempt. Brian Pruitt scored a fourth quarter touchdown to put the Chippewas ahead, 24\u201314. The team's statistical leaders included quarterback Joe Youngblood with 2,209 passing yards, tailback Brian Pruitt with 859 rushing yards, and flanker Terrance McMillan with 649 receiving yards. Youngblood was named as Central Michigan's most valuable player for the first of what would be two consecutive years.2015 Media Guide, p. 95. Offensive guard Marty Malcolm, center Art Droski, and defensive lineman Mike Nettie were selected as first-team All-MAC players.2015 Media Guide, p. 92. ==Schedule== ==References== Central Michigan Category:Central Michigan Chippewas football seasons Central Michigan Chippewas football ",
