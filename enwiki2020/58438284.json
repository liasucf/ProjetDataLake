    "text": "Ofoten is a former municipality in Nordland county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1884. The municipality included the areas on both sides of the inner part of the Ofotfjorden mostly in what is now the municipalities of Narvik, Ballangen, and Evenes. The administrative centre of Ofoten was the village of Narvik (which later became a town in 1902). After the municipality was dissolved in 1884, the name Ofoten has been used to refer to the region that once was this municipality. ==History== View of the Ofoten area The municipality of Ofoten was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1884, the municipality ceased to exist when it was split into two municipalities: Ankenes (population: 1,734) in the east and Evindn\u00e6s (population: 2,397) in the west. ==Name== The municipality was named after the local Ofotfjorden (Old Norse: \u00d3f\u00f3ti). The meaning of the first element is unknown and the last element is derived from the Old Norse word f\u00f3tr which means \"foot\". The oldest form of the name could have been \u00daff\u00f3ti. In this case, the first element is \u00fafr which means \"Eurasian eagle- owl\". The three inner branches of the Ofotfjord might have been compared with the three claws of an owl. ==See also== *List of former municipalities of Norway *Ofoten - a geographical area within Nordland county ==References== Category:Narvik Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:1838 establishments in Norway Category:1884 disestablishments in Norway ",
