Although the definition is vague, there is little overlap between segments A\u2013F based on weight and size parameters. PDF EU headliner Models segments tend to be based on comparison to well-known brand models. For example, a car such as the Volkswagen Golf might be described as being in the Ford Focus size class, or vice versa. The VW Polo is smaller, so it belongs one segment below the Golf, while the bigger Passat is one segment above. The names of the segments were mentioned, but not defined, in 1999 in an EU document titled Case No COMP/M.1406 HYUNDAI / KIA REGULATION (EEC) No 4064/89 MERGER PROCEDURE. * A: mini cars * B: small cars * C: medium cars * D: large cars * E: executive cars * F: luxury cars * J: sport utility cars (including off-road vehicles) * M: Multi purpose cars (including pickup) * S: Sports cars == See also == * ACRISS Car Classification Code * Car body style * Car classifications * Truck classification * Vehicle size class == References == ",
