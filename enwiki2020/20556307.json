It is a co- educational non-profit making school.School web site, accessed February 2009 == A Brief History == The International School was founded in 1969, as a co- educational non-profit making organisation. The school is owned by the International School Association, of which every parent of children in the school is automatically a member. The school is recognised and licensed by the Ministry of Education, and is a member of ECIS (European Council of International Schools). The school is non-denominational and the religious beliefs of all faiths are respected. Initially the school was established to provide a British style education for the children of expatriates working in Seychelles on temporary contract. During the last thirty years the school has expanded and, since 1994, has welcomed Seychellois children.http://iss.sc/history == Present == Today these Seychellois students are in the majority, with India, Britain, Australia and South Africa well represented. Originally the school catered only for primary age children, however during the last fifteen years the school has evolved to its present character, where children aged 3 years to 19 years are educated. The curriculum of the school is based upon the National Curriculum for England and Wales. More detailed information about this can be found in the curriculum booklets published annually for each class. The school offers accredited learning programmes that are internationally recognised: The International General Certificate of Education (IGCSE) is taught at year 10 and 11 level AS and A2 Level international qualifications are offered in the Sixth Form. The Advanced level programme prepares students for university studies overseas. The majority of Advanced level students do proceed to undergraduate courses after completion of their programme. All examinations are administered and accredited by the University of Cambridge, UK.http://iss.sc/history The headteacher of the International School Seychelles on Mahe is Mr Bhatnager. == Location == ===International School of Seychelles, Mahe=== The school is situated on the outskirts of Victoria in the Mont Fleuri District, Mahe, Seychelles.http://iss.sc/location == Facilities == All accommodation is purpose built, completed within the last ten years, and can be listed as follows: Early Childhood Section Foundation: Four Classrooms Early Childhood: Four Classrooms Sand, water play areas and a library.
