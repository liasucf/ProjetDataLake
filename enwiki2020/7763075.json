The physical benefits of wheelchair dancing include the maintenance of physical balance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination and improved respiratory control. The psychological effects of ballroom dancing are social interaction and the development of relationships. For social dancers, it is an opportunity to engage in a fun and a friendly event with others. For competitors, it assists in the development of fair play, sportsmanship and communication skills. Wheelchair dancing is an activity that integrates the wheelchair user and able-bodied person. == Courses == In February, 2008 the University of Delaware Collegiate DanceWheels Program was created to instruct students in wheelchair dancing. This is the first accredited course of its kind in the United States. The program was developed in conjunction with the American DanceWheels Foundation through a grant from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. == See also == * Physically integrated dance * Dancing on Wheels (a British television show) * Piotr Iwanicki * Brian Fortuna == References == == External links == * IPC- Wheelchair Dancesport Dance Category:Parasports organizations Category:Dancesport Category:Social dance Category:Physically integrated dance ",
