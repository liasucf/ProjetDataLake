    "text": "American Pie is a 1999 American sex comedy film directed and co-produced by Paul Weitz (in his directorial debut) and written by Adam Herz. It is the first film in the American Pie theatrical series and stars an ensemble cast that includes Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Seann William Scott and Eugene Levy. The plot centers on five best friends (Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch, and Stifler) who attend East Great Falls High. With the exception of Stifler (who has already lost his virginity), the guys make a pact to lose their virginity before their high school graduation. The title is borrowed from the song of the same name and refers to a scene in which the protagonist is caught masturbating with a pie after being told that third base feels like \"warm apple pie\". Writer Adam Herz has stated that the title also refers to the quest of losing one's virginity in high school, which is as \"American as apple pie.\" The film was a box-office hit and spawned three direct sequels: American Pie 2 (2001), American Wedding (2003), and American Reunion (2012).TMZ report In addition to the primary American Pie saga, there are five direct-to-DVD spin-off films bearing the title American Pie Presents: Band Camp (2005), The Naked Mile (2006), Beta House (2007), The Book of Love (2009) and Girls' Rules (2020). In response to the success of American Reunion, a fifth theatrical film, under the working title American Pie 5 was announced on August 4, 2012. In August 2017, Seann William Scott said in an interview that the fourth film probably had not made enough at the domestic box office to warrant another film. ==Plot== Five high school seniors from East Great Falls High School in West Michigan are good friends: Jim, an awkward and sexually na\u00efve nerd whose dad offers him pornography and unwanted sexual advice; Oz, on the school lacrosse team; Kevin, the calm leader of the group seeking to lose his virginity to his girlfriend Vicky; Finch, a mochaccino-drinking sophisticate and nerd; and Stifler, a popular but raucous jock who often throws wild parties when his mom is away, and is the only one of the five who is not a virgin. Dorky classmate Sherman claims that he lost his virginity at a party hosted by Stifler. Kevin prompts Oz, Finch, Jim, and Kevin to pledge to no longer be virgins by their high school graduation. Vicky accuses Kevin of wanting her only for sex, and he has to repair their relationship before the senior prom night, now the target day the four plan to lose their virginity. Oz joins the school jazz choir to find a girlfriend, learns about sensitivity, and that it is about asking girls questions and listening to what they say. He soon wins the attention of Heather, a girl in the choir. Heather learns about Oz's reputation, breaks up with him, and then learns to trust him when he leaves the lacrosse championship game to perform a competition duet with her. Jim pursues Nadia, an exchange student from the former Czechoslovakia. Oz tells Jim that third base feels like \"warm apple pie\" and when found by his dad having sex with a pie, he is persuaded to keep it from Jim's mom. Stifler persuades Jim to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch Nadia changing clothes after coming over to study following her ballet class. Nadia discovers Jim's pornography collection and while half- naked sitting on his bed masturbates to it. Jim is persuaded to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that he has sent the webcam link to everyone on the school list. With her, he experiences premature ejaculation\u2014twice. Nadia's sponsors see the video and send her back home, leaving Jim dateless for the prom. Jim thinks band camp geek Michelle is unaware of the cam incident so he asks her to the prom. Finch pays Vicky's friend, Jessica, $200 to spread the rumor of his sexual prowess, hoping that it will increase his chances of success. Stifler is turned down by a girl because she wants Finch to ask her; he spikes Finch's mochaccino with a laxative. Stifler plays to Finch's school restroom germaphobia to use the girls' restroom. Finch has diarrhea, and is humiliated by the crowd of students. Vicky asks Sherman's conquest about his claim. Everyone learns it is false and as a result, Sherman wets himself, in front of everyone at the prom. The boys plan to fulfill their pledge at the Stifler post-prom party. Kevin and Vicky have sex in an upstairs bedroom. Vicky breaks up with Kevin afterwards on the grounds that they will drift apart when they go to college. Oz confesses the pact to Heather, and renounces it, saying that just them being together makes him a winner. They reconcile and have sex. Oz, honoring his newfound sensitivity, does not divulge what they did. Michelle accepted Jim's offer to be his date because she saw the \"Nadia incident\" and thought he was a \"sure thing\". Michelle is sexually aggressive in bed. When he wakes up, she is gone and he learns that he had a one-night stand with her but he is okay about it. Finch meets Stifler's mom in the basement recreation room where they have sex on the pool table. Stifler finds them on the pool table asleep and he faints. The morning after the prom, the boys eat breakfast at their favorite restaurant where they toast to the \"next step\". Nadia watches Jim stripping via webcam. Jim is oblivious to his father walking in, who then walks out of the room and starts dancing. ==Cast== Cameos * Blink-182 make a cameo appearance as the band watching Jim and Nadia during their webcast, though drummer Travis Barker is incorrectly credited as former Blink-182 drummer \"Scott Raynor\". Also, when their song \"Mutt\" is credited, Barker's name is misspelled as \"Travis Barkor\". The parts were given when Tom DeLonge's acting agent reported the film needed a band. * Casey Affleck as Tom Myers, Kevin's older brother. * Stacy Fuson, Playmate of the Month for February 1999, appears in the crowd laughing at Finch when he exits the girls' restroom. ==Production== Los Cerritos house. Much of the film is based on the writer's days at East Grand Rapids High School in Michigan. In the film, the town is called \"East Great Falls\", and the high school sports the same school colors \u2014 blue and gold \u2014 along with a similar mascot \u2014 the Trailblazers instead of the Pioneers. The restaurant hangout, \"Dog Years\", is based on Yesterdog, a popular hot dog restaurant in the nearby Eastown neighborhood of Grand Rapids. The \"Central Chicks\" and \"Central\" Lacrosse team that East Great Falls plays against is an amalgam of nearby Grand Rapids Catholic Central High School. The working title for the film had been \"East Great Falls High\". Adam Herz wrote the screenplay, tentatively titled Untitled Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Most Readers Will Probably Hate But I Think You Will Love, in six weeks using Porky's and Bachelor Party as inspiration. Principal photography on the film, now titled Great Falls, begun on July 21 and wrapped on September 11, 1998. The film originally received an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America until edits were made to secure an R rating. During the casting of the film, Bill Murray was considered for the role of Noah Levenstein, Jim's dad. When Eugene Levy was cast, he insisted on being allowed to improvise his lines, as he disliked how his character was written in the script. In the final film, most of his lines were improvised. The film was actually shot in Southern California, most notably in Long Beach using Long Beach Unified School District area high schools. Millikan High School, whose school colors are blue and gold, was used for exterior shots, and Long Beach Polytechnic High School was used for interior shots. Located in Los Cerritos, Long Beach, California, both schools are within five miles of the Virginia Country Club and Los Cerritos Neighborhood (where Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Donnie Darko were filmed). ==Reception== ===Box office=== Despite insiders claiming it to be a potential sleeper hit, Universal Pictures sold off the foreign rights in an attempt to recoup its budget. American Pie was sold successfully to foreign distributors at the Cannes International Film Festival.\"Foreign Strategy May Burn Universal.\" Los Angeles Times thru Orlando Sentinel (June 13, 1999). The film took in a gross worldwide revenue of $235,483,004,American Pie \u2013 Box Office Data, Movie News, Cast Information The Numbers $132,922,000 of which was from international tickets.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on scale of A to F. The more negative reviews include Stephen Holden of The New York Times who felt American Pie was \"one of the shallowest and the most prurient teen films.\" Robert Horton of Film.com wrote that American Pie \"had a few amusing bits, however the audience should strongly note that the movie is really awful, and that it was not worthy of guilty pleasure status.\" Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe wrote that American Pie is a \"gross and tasteless high school romp with sentimental mush.\" Roger Ebert was more supportive, awarding it three out of four stars. He noted that \"[i]t is not inspired, but it's cheerful and hard-working and sometimes funny, and\u2014here's the important thing\u2014it's not mean. Its characters are sort of sweet and lovable.\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Award ! Category ! Recipients !
