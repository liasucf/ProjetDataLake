    "text": "Dominique G. Homberger (born 10 April 1948) is a zoologist at the Louisiana State University. She is noted for her work on the evolution of complex structures in birds and mammals, and is also the author of a textbook on vertebrate dissection. A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Ornithological Union, she is the present secretary of the International Ornithological Congress. In April 2010, she was removed from teaching an introductory biology course at LSU for having a strict grading policy. Cary Nelson, president of the American Association of University Professors, observed that the academic community has always believed that \"an instructor has the responsibility for assigning grades\", and there was media speculation that this was part of a process of formalizing grade inflation. == Teaching == For her teaching, the Louisiana State University Honors College has awarded Homberger the Departmental Alumni Professorship. == Book == With co-author Warren F. Walker, Homberger has written a standard textbook titled \"Vertebrate Dissection\", with this being first published in 2003, and is now in the ninth edition. Goodreads has a rating of 4.4 out of 5. ==Works== * == References == Category:Living people Category:American ornithologists Category:Women ornithologists Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:1948 births ",
