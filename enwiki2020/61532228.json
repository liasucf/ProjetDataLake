    "text": "Ist der Ruf erst ruiniert... is the third studio album by German all-female pop-rap band Tic Tac Toe, released in 2000 by RCA Records. The title comes from a German proverb \"Ist der Ruf erst ruiniert, lebt es sich ganz ungeniert\" which means \"Once the reputation is ruined, you can live completely free\". The material was again composed and produced by Torsten B\u00f6rger. The album was released after the original member Ricarda \"Ricky\" W\u00e4ltken left the band amid controversies and conflicts with other bandmates, being subsequently replaced by Sara Brahms. It spawned three singles, of which only one, \"Isch liebe disch\", achieved moderate chart success internationally. The album did not sell as well as its predecessors and shortly after its release the band entered a hiatus. == Track listing == == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (2000) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Austria (\u00d63 Austria Top 40) |align=\"center\"|50 |- |align=\"left\"|Europe (European Top 100 Albums) |align=\"center\"|100 |- |align=\"left\"|Germany (Media Control) |align=\"center\"|34 |- |align=\"left\"|Switzerland (Swiss Hitparade) |align=\"center\"|92 |- |} == References == Category:2000 albums Category:German-language albums Category:Tic Tac Toe (band) albums ",
