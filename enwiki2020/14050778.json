    "text": "Misology is defined as the hatred of reasoning; the revulsion or distrust of logical debate, argumentation, or the Socratic method. ==Sources== The source of the word is Plato's dramatic work Phaedo ( in Attic Greek), which presents the final hours and execution of Socrates, ultimately, by those who were offended by his philosophical pursuit. Plato\u2019s Phaedo tells the story of Phaedo of Elis recalling the death and final hours of Socrates some time afterwards to Echecrates, who had heard tell of Socrates' execution but has no detailed account and is curious to hear of it. Phaedo, being one of those present at Socrates' execution, begins and explains that he and others had gathered early to visit Socrates on the day of his execution. There, Simmias and Cebes had begun a discussion with Socrates on the afterlife, and Cebes in particular had questioned Socrates on his belief that the soul must be immortal. Phaedo recalls that Socrates had just presented an argument to this effect, when both Simmias and Cebes presented excellent objections. Phaedo breaks from his story and says to Echecrates: Phaedo then tells Echecrates that before replying to Simmias and Cebes' argument Socrates, having no doubt seen the disquiet that their objection had caused among all those present, which Phaedo himself evidenced above to Echecrates, breaks from his argumentation to make an important point: that they must not lose heart because of this objection and reject philosophy as a result. Phaedo says that Socrates begins thus: Plato's Socrates is warning the reader that, just as one should not hate his fellow man because they themselves were poor in judging character, they should not hate argumentation and reason \u2014 partake in \"misology\" \u2014 just because they may not be skilled enough to discern the flaws and strengths of an argument: == Modern provenance == The word misology itself is first attested in English in 1833, and was used in Benjamin Jowett's 1871 translation of Plato's work, Dialogues: \"as there are misanthropists or haters of men, there are also misologists or haters of ideas.\" The term was also used by Immanuel Kant in a passage from his 1785 work, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten): \"Misologie, d. i. [das ist] Ha\u00df der Vernunft\" translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott in 1895, straightforwardly, as: \"misology, that is, hatred of reason.\" ==See also== *Fideism == Notes == == References == == External links == Category:Anti- intellectualism Category:Reasoning Category:Informal fallacies ",
