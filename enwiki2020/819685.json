    "text": "Unni is used as a first name in Kerala, India. In the Malayalam language, it is also used as an adjective meaning an infant boy. Thus, Unnikrishnan or Unnikannan means Lord Krishna in the infant form and Unniyesu means Yesu (Jesus in Malayalam) in the infant form. The word is also the name of a caste among Hindus in the Southern India State of Kerala. The name Unni is also used as a surname by various sub-groups of Pushpaka Brahmins like Pushpakanunnis, Theeyattunnis and Pattarunnis (Karappuram Unni or Nattuppattar). There is a common belief that Unnis are sub-divided into Pushpakanunnis, Theeyattunnis and Pattarunnis. In fact these are entirely different communities in a common class of Kerala Brahmins and there were no inter caste marriages among these communities anciently. Thiyattunnis were traditionally the performers of an ancient art form called T\u012by\u0101ttu. The famous Malayalam writer Kottarathil Sankunni was a T\u012by\u0101ttunni whereas famous essayist D. Padmanabhan Unni was a Pushpakanunni. Thiyattunnis have the right for Tantric Poojas and other privileges enjoyed by the Nambudiri caste. ==People== Notable people with name/surname Unni include: *Unni Mary, Indian film actress and producer *Unni Menon, Indian film playback singer *Unni Mukundan (born 1987), Indian film actor *Unni R.
