The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, first published in 1854, was the last of a series of classical dictionaries edited by the English scholar William Smith (1813-1893), which included as sister works A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities and the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology. As declared by Smith in the Preface: \"The Dictionary of Geography ... is designed mainly to illustrate the Greek and Roman writers, and to enable a diligent student to read them in the most profitable manner\". The book stays up to the description: in two massive volumes the dictionary provides detailed coverage of all the important countries, regions, towns, cities, geographical features that occur in Greek and Roman literature, without forgetting those mentioned solely in the Bible. The work was last reissued in 2005. == See also == * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology ==References== *Smith, William; Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, London, (1854) *\"Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography\" from the North American Review, July 1855, pp. 268\u201371 * ==Facsimiles== *Via Google Book Search: **(1854) Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, Vol. I: Abacaenum \u2013 Hytanis **(1857) Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, Vol. II Iabadius \u2013 Zymethus *The Internet Archive has a number of editions including: * * * * * ==External links== * __NOTOC__ Category:1854 books Category:British online encyclopedias Category:Reference works in the public domain Greek and Roman Geography Category:Classical geography ",
