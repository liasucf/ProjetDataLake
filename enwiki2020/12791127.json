It was Federer's 12th Grand Slam title overall (tied with Roy Emerson) and his third out of three years in which he won three of the four majors in a single calendar season. Also, he reached a record-equalling 14th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance (streak started at the 2004 Wimbledon Championships), after Roy Emerson and Ivan Lendl. This was the last Grand Slam tournament for former World No. 4 and 2004 US Open Semifinalist Tim Henman. ==Seeds== # Roger Federer (Champion) # Rafael Nadal (Fourth round) # Novak Djokovic (Final) # Nikolay Davydenko (Semifinals) # Andy Roddick (Quarterfinals) # James Blake (Fourth round) # Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez (First round) # Tommy Robredo (Third round) # Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych (Fourth round, retired due to an illness) # Tommy Haas (Quarterfinals) # Mikhail Youzhny (Second round) # Ivan Ljubi\u010di\u0107 (Third round) # Richard Gasquet (Second round, withdrew due to an illness) # Guillermo Ca\u00f1as (Second round) # David Ferrer (Semifinals) # Lleyton Hewitt (Second round) # Carlos Moy\u00e1 (Quarterfinals) # Marcos Baghdatis (First round) # Andy Murray (Third round) # Juan Ignacio Chela (Quarterfinals) # Juan Carlos Ferrero (First round) # Paul- Henri Mathieu (First round) # Juan M\u00f3naco (Fourth round) # David Nalbandian (Third round) # Marat Safin (Second round) # Jarkko Nieminen (First round) # Dmitry Tursunov (First round) # Nicol\u00e1s Almagro (Third round) # Filippo Volandri (First round) # Potito Starace (First round) # J\u00fcrgen Melzer (Second round) # Ivo Karlovi\u0107 (First round) ==Qualifying draw== ==Draw== ===Finals=== Number 1 seeded Roger Federer won the US Open for the fourth year in a row. ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== ==References== ==External links== * Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) \u2013 2007 US Open Men's Singles draw *2007 US Open \u2013 Men's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Men's Singles Category:US Open (tennis) by year \u2013 Men's Singles ",
