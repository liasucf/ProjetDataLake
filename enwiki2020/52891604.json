    "text": "The Church of Most Holy Saviour (Italian: Chiesa del Santissimo Salvatore) is a Baroque church of Palermo. It is located in the main street of the city, the ancient Cassaro, in the quarter of the Albergaria, within the historic centre of Palermo. The church was built starting in 1682 in the area of an ancient female Basilian monastery founded by Robert Guiscard in 1072. The building was designed by the architect Paolo Amato, but also Giacomo Amato and Angelo Italia were involved in the construction. It was said that Constance, Queen of Sicily (1154-1198) had been confined to the church as a nun since childhood due to the prediction that \"her marriage would destroy Sicily\" before 30 when she was eventually engaged for political reason. == External links == * Gaspare Palermo, Guida istruttiva per potersi conoscere tutte le magnificenze della Citt\u00e0 di Palermo, Volume III, Palermo, Reale Stamperia, 1816 Salvatore Category:Baroque architecture in Palermo Category:17th-century Roman Catholic church buildings ",
