The single quickly rose to number one on both the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts. It also reached number 56 on the Billboard Hot 100, the second highest of their singles after \"Broken\", which reached number 20. The single was certified platinum by the RIAA. The original version of the song was first recorded in singer Shaun Morgan's bedroom and was an iTunes exclusive bonus track named \"Quirk,\" included with pre-orders of Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces. ==Music video== The music video, which was directed by Tony Petrossian, debuted on Seether's website as part of a \"worldwide fan premiere\" on October 23, 2007, the same day the album was released. It shows Shaun Morgan filming a music video on a plane set, with women dancing seductively around him. It then goes on to show the band playing in a snowy clearing and an industrial looking arena surrounded by fans. Each setting is then inundated with various parts of the others, such as having the scantily clad models from the plane dance through the snowy clearing, revealing all the various music video tropes to be faked in some way, through the use of props, bluescreen, or computer manipulation, reflecting the theme of the lyrics. ==Use in other media== \"Fake It\" was announced to be the official theme song of the 2008 WWE No Way Out pay-per-view event that took place on February 17, 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada.WWE: TV Shows > No Way Out It also appears on the soundtrack in the video game Burnout Paradise.
