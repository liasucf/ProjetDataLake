    "text": "Felipe Clemente de Diego y Guti\u00e9rrez (1866 - 1945) was a Spanish jurist who was instrumental in rebuilding the Spanish state and its judiciary after the Francoist victory in the Spanish Civil War. Clemente de Diego taught Roman law in Santiago in 1897\u201399 and civil law in Valladolid, Barcelona and Madrid until 1936. He co-founded the Revista de derecho privado, later the most significant civil law journal in Spain, in 1913. In 1938, the Franquist regime named him president of the Tribunal Supremo (Supreme Court), which post he held until his death. The principal work of Clemente de Diego is the six-volume Curso elemental de Derecho civil espa\u00f1ol com\u00fan y foral (1920\u201323). He also engaged in the study of the philosophy of law, promoting the adherence to an ideal of natural law founded on Christian ethics in the practice of law, and denouncing legal formalism as the reason for the perceived crisis of the legal system prior to the civil war. ==References== * Category:Spanish jurists Category:1866 births Category:1945 deaths ",
