    "text": "Marco Aurelio Denegri Santagadea (May 16, 1938 - July 27, 2018) was a Peruvian intellectual, literary critic, television host and sexologist. ==Early life and education== His father was Julio Ernesto Denegri Cornejo - his grandfather was Marco Aurelio Denegri Valega - and his mother was Leonor Santagadea Arana. He attended Colegio San Andr\u00e9s (formerly Colegio Anglo-Peruano). He later studied Law at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, and then Sexology and Sociology. He said that he attended several universities; however, he considered himself a \"self-taught polymath\". ==Career== During the 70s, Denegri was the editor of Revista Cient\u00edfica y Art\u00edstica de Cultural Sexual \u2013 F\u00e1scinum. Its first issue was published in April 1972. His career in Peruvian television began in 1973. From 1997 to 2000 he hosted A solas con Marco Aurelio Denegri on Cable Magico Cultural. He resigned in 2000 and then moved to TV Peru-, thanks to the aid of Jos\u00e9 Watanabe, and there he hosted a television program called La funci\u00f3n de la palabra, where he addressed various aspects of culture-from music to the beauty of the hands-although he considered it counter-cultural. He wrote articles for various Peruvian newspapers, which have been published in \"De esto y de aquello\" by Ricardo Palma University. He wrote a weekly column for El Comercio. ==Personal life== Denegri never married and was very reserved regarding his private life. In some programs he expressed being friends with some intellectuals, although during the last years of his life he became totally isolated. His main link to the world was his assistant and maid Rosa Torres; anyone interested in speaking to Denegri had to ring her cellphone to request a telephone conversation with Denegri. After Denegri gave her permission, she connected the phone line and the person in question could communicate directly with him. During his youth he frequently visited Jir\u00f3n Huatica in Lima, a meeting place for prostitutes and their clients. In \"Miscel\u00e1nea human\u00edstica\" he drew a map of the location as he knew it. He was also a witness to peculiar sexual encounters. In one of the airings of \"La funci\u00f3n de la palabra\", he said that together with a group of people he witnessed a technical intercourse session which involved great endurance in resisting the urge to ejaculate. Denegri related that he saw a male prostitute enduring 45 minutes of passive oral sex without ejaculating. Furthermore, in an interview conducted by journalist Ra\u00fal Tola, Denegri said that he attended an ejaculation contest which consisted in ejaculating up to the farthest distance. Amused by his story, Tola asked him where could one find such contests, to which Denegri only replied that several such contests exist. He was an audiophile and music lover and a Peruvian caj\u00f3n lover; for this reason he introduced the term cajon\u00edstica to refer to the art of African-Peruvian caj\u00f3n playing. ==Death== He died on July 27, 2018 due to pulmonary emphysema. ==Works== * F\u00e1scinum.
