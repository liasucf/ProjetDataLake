It's a very simple and interesting theme, all about Kashmir where J&K; and the Kashmiri people are central to certain developments taking place in the movie. In the recent past, Kashmir has been portrayed in many films for the unrest in the region, however in this film there is no violence and the movie depicts the beauty and chastity of Kashmir and Kashmiris.
