    "text": "Elomeryx is an extinct genus of artiodactyl ungulate, and is among the earliest known anthracotheres. The genus was extremely widespread, first being found in Asia in the middle Eocene, in Europe during the latest Eocene, and having spread to North America by the early Oligocene. Restoration of E. armatus Elomeryx was about in body length, and had a long, vaguely horse-like head. It had small tusks which it used to uproot plants, and spoon-shaped incisors ideal for pulling and cropping water plants. Elomeryx had five-toed hind legs and four-toed front legs, resulting in wide feet which made it easier to walk on soft mud. It probably had similar habits to the modern hippopotamus, to which it may have been related. ==References== Category:Anthracotheres Category:Eocene even-toed ungulates Category:Oligocene even-toed ungulates Category:Rupelian genus extinctions Category:Paleogene mammals of North America Category:Paleogene mammals of Asia Category:Paleogene mammals of Europe Category:Fossil taxa described in 1894 ",
