The bridge is located in the city center over Kara\u00e7omak Creek, a tributary of G\u00f6k\u0131rmak, connecting western and eastern parts of the city. Nasrullah Mosque is to the west and the Kastamonu Governor's Office is to the east. It was endowed as a waqf in 1501 by Kad\u0131 Nasrullah, who was a judge in the Ottoman Empire. The ashlar-constructed bridge had originally five arches. It was long and wide. The main arch span was and the others in length. It underwent three major reparations, the last two times in 1709 and in 1946. During the last reparation, a staircase was added to each end of the bridge when the west-most one arch and the east-most two arches were ripped off. Today, the bridge has two arches only. The two original stone alms pots and the curbstones on the bridge are still preserved. Due to its unusual appearance, it is dubbed by the citizens the Hunchback Bridge (). The Minister of Forestry Veysel Ero\u011flu announced in 2016 that the bridge will be reconstructed to its original form. ==References== Category:Kastamonu Category:Bridges completed in the 16th century Category:Arch bridges in Turkey Category:Ottoman bridges in Turkey Category:Buildings and structures in Kastamonu Province Category:Pedestrian bridges in Turkey Category:Stone bridges in Turkey Category:Deck arch bridges ",
