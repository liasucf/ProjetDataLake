    "text": "In algebraic geometry, an action of a group scheme is a generalization of a group action to a group scheme. Precisely, given a group S-scheme G, a left action of G on an S-scheme X is an S-morphism :\\sigma: G \\times_S X \\to X such that * (associativity) \\sigma \\circ (1_G \\times \\sigma) = \\sigma \\circ (m \\times 1_X), where m: G \\times_S G \\to G is the group law, * (unitality) \\sigma \\circ (e \\times 1_X) = 1_X, where e: S \\to G is the identity section of G. A right action of G on X is defined analogously. A scheme equipped with a left or right action of a group scheme G is called a G-scheme. An equivariant morphism between G-schemes is a morphism of schemes that intertwines the respective G-actions. More generally, one can also consider (at least some special case of) an action of a group functor: viewing G as a functor, an action is given as a natural transformation satisfying the conditions analogous to the above.In details, given a group-scheme action \\sigma, for each morphism T \\to S, \\sigma determines a group action G(T) \\times X(T) \\to X(T); i.e., the group G(T) acts on the set of T-points X(T). Conversely, if for each T \\to S, there is a group action \\sigma_T: G(T) \\times X(T) \\to X(T) and if those actions are compatible; i.e., they form a natural transformation, then, by the Yoneda lemma, they determine a group-scheme action \\sigma: G \\times_S X \\to X. Alternatively, some authors study group action in the language of a groupoid; a group-scheme action is then an example of a groupoid scheme. == Constructs == The usual constructs for a group action such as orbits generalize to a group-scheme action. Let \\sigma be a given group-scheme action as above. *Given a T-valued point x: T \\to X, the orbit map \\sigma_x: G \\times_S T \\to X \\times_S T is given as (\\sigma \\circ (1_G \\times x), p_2). *The orbit of x is the image of the orbit map \\sigma_x. *The stabilizer of x is the fiber over \\sigma_x of the map (x, 1_T): T \\to X \\times_S T. == Problem of constructing a quotient == Unlike a set-theoretic group action, there is no straightforward way to construct a quotient for a group-scheme action. One exception is the case when the action is free, the case of a principal fiber bundle. There are several approaches to overcome this difficulty: *Level structure - Perhaps the oldest, the approach replaces an object to classify by an object together with a level structure *Geometric invariant theory - throw away bad orbits and then take a quotient. The drawback is that there is no canonical way to introduce the notion of \"bad orbits\"; the notion depends on a choice of linearization. See also: categorical quotient, GIT quotient. *Borel construction - this is an approach essentially from algebraic topology; this approach requires one to work with an infinite-dimensional space. *Analytic approach, the theory of Teichm\u00fcller space *Quotient stack - in a sense, this is the ultimate answer to the problem. Roughly, a \"quotient prestack\" is the category of orbits and one stackify (i.e., the introduction of the notion of a torsor) it to get a quotient stack. Depending on applications, another approach would be to shift the focus away from a space then onto stuff on a space; e.g., topos. So the problem shifts from the classification of orbits to that of equivariant objects. == See also == *groupoid scheme *Sumihiro's theorem *equivariant sheaf *Borel fixed-point theorem == References == * Category:Algebraic geometry ",
