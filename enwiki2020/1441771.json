As a youth he had a traditional Jewish education, before eventually engaging with the ideas of the Haskalah. He studied philosophy from 1836 at the University of Leipzig and in 1839 changed to a doctorate of medicine at the University of Berlin, which he completed in 1841. Barasch tried to settle in Moldavia, but the authorities refused to give him the licence to practice medicine, so he settled in Wallachia. In 1842, he was a physician in C\u0103l\u0103ra\u015fi, then in 1845, in Craiova and finally settling in Bucharest. He taught natural sciences at the Saint Sava Academy in 1852 and then was a professor at Bucharest's School of Medicine and Pharmacy.Florin Manolescu, Literatura S.F., Editura Univers, Bucharest, 1980, p. 208 Beside working as a doctor, he became a radical and ardent Romanian patriot.
