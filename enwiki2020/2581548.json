The area is chiefly residential. Housing around Carnglas Square is mostly pre-war, while that the higher ground at Llwyn Mawr dates from the 1970s onwards. ==Amenities== There are several shops and other commercial premises in and around Carnglas Square (the junction of Carnglas Road, Harlech Crescent, and Ty-coch Road) including a sub post office, a newsagent, a computer shop, an Indian takeaway, and a wine bar / bistro, but no pub.
