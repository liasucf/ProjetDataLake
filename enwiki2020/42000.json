He was elected the fifteenth member to occupy seat 1 of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1924. ==Life== He was born in Paris on 24 July 1856 and educated there at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV. He then studied Mathematics at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. Picard's mathematical papers, textbooks, and many popular writings exhibit an extraordinary range of interests, as well as an impressive mastery of the mathematics of his time. Modern students of complex variables are probably familiar with two of his named theorems. Picard's little theorem states that every nonconstant entire function takes every value in the complex plane, with perhaps one exception. Picard's great theorem states that an analytic function with an essential singularity takes every value infinitely often, with perhaps one exception, in any neighborhood of the singularity. He made important contributions in the theory of differential equations, including work on Picard\u2013Vessiot theory, Painlev\u00e9 transcendents and his introduction of a kind of symmetry group for a linear differential equation. He also introduced the Picard group in the theory of algebraic surfaces, which describes the classes of algebraic curves on the surface modulo linear equivalence. In connection with his work on function theory, he was one of the first mathematicians to use the emerging ideas of algebraic topology. In addition to his theoretical work, Picard made contributions to applied mathematics, including the theories of telegraphy and elasticity. His collected papers run to four volumes. Louis Couturat studied integral calculus with Picard in 1891 and 2, taking detailed notes of the lectures. These notes were preserved and now are available in three cahiers from Internet Archive.Louis Couturat notes (1891,2) Cours de Calcul Integral par M. Picard, cahier 1, cahier 2, cahier 3 Like his contemporary, Henri Poincar\u00e9, Picard was much concerned with the training of mathematics, physics, and engineering students. He wrote a classic textbook on analysis and one of the first textbooks on the theory of relativity. Picard's popular writings include biographies of many leading French mathematicians, including his father in law, Charles Hermite. ==Family== In 1881 he married Marie, the daughter of Charles Hermite. ==Works== * 1891\u201396: * 1905: * 1906 : (with Georges Simart) Theorie des Fonctions Algebrique de deux Variables Independente volume 2, via Internet Archive * 1922: * 1922: * 1931: * 1978\u201381: ==See also== * \u00c9mile Picard Medal * Picard modular group * Picard modular surface * Picard horn ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1856 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Scientists from Paris Category:19th-century French mathematicians Category:20th-century French mathematicians Category:Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV alumni Category:\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni Category:Mathematical analysts Category:Grand Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society Category:Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences Category:Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences Category:Honorary Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1917\u20131925) Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint James of the Sword Category:Members of the Ligue de la patrie fran\u00e7aise ",
