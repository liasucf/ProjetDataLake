Founded in 1868, Wayne State consists of 13 schools and colleges offering more than 350 programs to nearly 27,000 graduate and undergraduate students. Wayne State University, along with the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, comprise the University Research Corridor of Michigan. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". Wayne State's main campus comprises 203 acres linking more than 100 education and research buildings. It also has six satellite campuses in Macomb, Oakland, Wayne and Jackson counties. The Wayne State Warriors compete in the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC). == History == The first component of the modern Wayne State University was established in 1868 as the Detroit College of Medicine. In 1885, the Detroit College of Medicine merged with its competitor, the Michigan College of Medicine and they consolidated buildings. In 1913, the school was restructured as the Detroit College of Medicine and Surgery, passing under that name into the control of the Detroit Board of Education. These institutions are incarnated today as the Wayne State University School of Medicine. Old Main at Wayne State University In 1881, the Detroit Normal Training School for Teachers was established by the Detroit Board of Education. In 1920, after several relocations to larger quarters, the school became the Detroit Teachers College. The Board of Education voted in 1924 to make the college a part of the new College of the City of Detroit. This eventually became the Wayne State University College of Education. Detroit College of Medicine, about 1911. In 1917, the Detroit Board of Education founded the Detroit Junior College and would make Detroit Central High School's Old Main Hall its campus. Detroit's College of Pharmacy and the Detroit Teachers College were added to the campus in 1924, and were organized into the College of the City of Detroit. The original junior college became the College of Liberal Arts. The first bachelor's degrees were awarded in 1925. The College of Liberal Arts of the College of the City of Detroit is today the Wayne State University College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Recognizing the need for a good public law school, a group of lawyers, including Allan Campbell, the school's founding dean, established Detroit City Law School in 1927 as part of the College of the City of Detroit. Originally structured as a part-time evening program, the school's first class graduated with the bachelor of laws degree (LL.B.) in 1928 and achieved full American Bar Association in 1939. The school is known today as Wayne State University Law School. Major-General Anthony Wayne (pastel by James Sharples, Sr., c. 1795) In 1933, the Detroit Board of Education voted to unify the colleges it ran into one university. In January 1934, that institution was officially named Wayne University, taking its name from Wayne County, in which the university and the city of Detroit reside, as well as Major General Anthony Wayne. Continuing to grow, Wayne University added its School of Social Work in 1935, and the School of Business Administration in 1946. Wayne University was renamed Wayne State University in 1956 and the institution became a constitutionally mandated university by a popularly adopted amendment to the Michigan Constitution in 1959. The Wayne State University Board of Governors created the Institute of Gerontology in 1965 in response to a State of Michigan mandate. The institute's primary mission in that era was to engage in research, education and service in the field of aging.

Wayne State University grew again in 1973 with the addition of the College of Lifelong Learning. In 1985, the School of Fine and the Performing Arts, and the College of Urban, Labor, and Metropolitan Affairs grew the university further. In the early 21st century, WSU constructed several new buildings, including the Integrative Biosciences Center (IBio), a facility for interdisciplinary work in the biosciences.

Roy Wilson as Wayne State's 12th president. He was sworn in on August 1, 2013. In 2015, WSU bestowed its first posthumous honorary doctorate degree on Viola Liuzzo. In 2015, the School of Business administration was renamed the Mike Ilitch School of Business. The name was changed in recognition of a $40 million grant from Mike and Marian Ilitch. This gift was used toward building a new business school facility in Detroit, which opened in late August 2018 in The District Detroit. ==Academics== Wayne State's academic offerings are divided among 13 schools and colleges: the Mike Ilitch School of Business; the College of Education; the College of Engineering; the College of Fine, Performing, and Communication Arts; the Graduate School; the Law School; the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; the School of Information Sciences; the School of Medicine; the College of Nursing; the Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences; the Irvin D.

Holmes, who initially coached all sports. His track teams were nationally known into the 1950s; in his first 10 years, he produced two Olympians from the school's Victorian-era gym. Although he had major ambitions for Wayne and scheduled such teams as Notre Dame and Penn State in the 1920s, the lack of facilities and money for athletics kept the program small. A student poll selected the name of \"Tartars\" for the school's teams in 1927. In 1999, the university changed the name to the \"Warriors\", due to the general feeling that the Tartar name was dated and most people were not familiar with the name's historical significance.
