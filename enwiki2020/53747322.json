    "text": "The 2017 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B play-offs (Playoffs de Ascenso or Promoci\u00f3n de Ascenso) are the final playoffs for promotion from 2016\u201317 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B to the 2017\u201318 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. The four first placed teams in each one of the four qualify for the promotion playoffs and the four last placed teams in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n are relegated to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. It also decides the teams which placed 16th to be relegated to the 2017\u201318 Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. ==Format== The four group winners have the opportunity to promote directly and become the overall Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B champion. The four group winners will be drawn into a two-legged series where the two winners will be promoted to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n and will enter into the final for the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B champion. The two losing semifinalists will enter the playoff round for the last two promotion spots. The four group runners-up will be drawn against one of the three fourth-placed teams outside their group while the four third- placed teams will be drawn against each other in a two-legged series. The six winners will advance with the two losing semifinalists to determine the four teams that will enter the last two-legged series for the last two promotion spots. In all the playoff series, the lower-ranked club will play at home first. Whenever there is a tie in position (e.g. like the group winners in the Semifinal Round and Final or the third-placed teams in the first round), a draw will determine the club to play at home first. == Group Winners Promotion Play-off == === Qualified teams === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Team |- !1 ||Cultural Leonesa |- !2 |Albacete |- !3 |Barcelona B |- !4 |Lorca FC |} === Bracket === === Matches === ====Semifinals==== |} =====First leg===== =====Second leg===== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Promoted to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n |- |Cultural Leonesa (42 years later) |Lorca FC (First time ever) |- |} ====Final==== |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;\" |- !Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B 2016\u201317 champions |- |Cultural Leonesa |} == Non-champions Promotion Play-off == ===First round=== ====Qualified teams==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !1 !!2nd |Racing Santander |- !2 !!2nd |Toledo |- !3 !!2nd |Alcoyano |- !4 !!2nd ||Murcia |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !1 !!3rd ||Celta Vigo B |- !2 !!3rd ||Fuenlabrada |- !3 !!3rd |Valencia Mestalla |- !4 !!3rd ||Villanovense |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !1 !!4th |Pontevedra |- !2 !!4th |Rayo Majadahonda |- !3 !!4th |Atl\u00e9tico Baleares |- !4 !!4th |Cartagena |- |} ====Matches==== |} =====First leg===== =====Second leg===== ===Second round=== ====Qualified teams==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !2 !!1st |Albacete |- !3 !!1st |Barcelona B |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !1 !!2nd |Racing Santander |- !4 !!2nd |Murcia |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !3 !!3rd ||Valencia Mestalla |- !4 !!3rd ||Villanovense |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !3 !!4th ||Atl\u00e9tico Baleares |- !4 !!4th ||Cartagena |} ====Matches==== |} =====First leg===== =====Second leg===== ===Third round=== ====Qualified teams==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !2 !!1st |Albacete |- !3 !!1st |Barcelona B |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !1 !!2nd |Racing Santander |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !3 !!3rd ||Valencia Mestalla |} ====Matches==== |} =====First leg===== =====Second leg===== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Promoted to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n |- |Albacete (One year later) |Barcelona B (2 years later) |- |} ==Relegation play-off== ===Qualified teams=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Pos. !Team |- !1 !!16th |Burgos |- !2 !!16th |San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes |- !3 !!16th |Atl\u00e9tico Levante |- !4 !!16th |Linares |- |} ===Matches=== The losers of this series will be relegated to the 2017\u201318 Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. |} ====First leg==== ====Second leg==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Relegated to Tercera Divisi\u00f3n |- |Atl\u00e9tico Levante |Linares |} == References == == External links == *Royal Spanish Football Federation Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B play-offs Category:2017 Spanish football leagues play-offs Category:2016\u201317 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B ",
