Max Engel remains a firm believer in Santa Claus and intends to send him a letter. His family includes his teenage sister Beth and their parents Tom and Sarah; his Aunt Linda and Uncle Howard; their children, Howie Jr., Stevie, Jordan, and baby Chrissie; Sarah and Linda's cantankerous Aunt Dorothy; and Tom's mother Omi, who speaks mostly German. Max wants to continue family traditions, but tension among his relatives saps their Christmas spirit. When his cousins read out his letter to Santa and mock him for still believing, he fights with them and yells out that he hates his family and even Christmas. His father comforts him by telling him that even though there is chaos during the holidays, he should always love his family and he gives him his letter to Santa. In a fit of anger, Max tears up the letter and throws it to the wind outside and it's swept up into the sky. That night, a severe blizzard engulfs the town, causing a power outage. When Beth ventures out to check on her boyfriend, a large, horned creature chases her. She hides beneath a delivery truck, but the creature leaves a jack-in-the-box which attacks and captures her. Tom and Howard leave to search for Beth. They find her boyfriend's house in ruins with the chimney split open and large goat-like hoof prints in the house. Outside, the two are attacked by an unseen monster under the snow. They return home and board up the windows. Later, a large hook with a living gingerbread man attached lures Howie Jr. to the chimney and he is dragged up the chimney despite the family's efforts to save him. Omi explains that the creature hunting them is Krampus, an ancient demonic spirit who punishes those who have lost the Christmas spirit. Omi recounts that when she was a child, her parents and community lost their spirit due to the hardships of the war in Europe, as did she, which summoned Krampus. He dragged everyone except her to Hell, leaving behind a bell bauble with his name on it. The family remains skeptical until monstrous toys, hidden in presents delivered earlier, invade the house. Stevie and Jordan are lured to the attic by Beth's voice; Jordan is swallowed by Der Klown, the jack-in-the-box from before. The family fends off the toys, but Krampus' elves leap in through a window, taking Dorothy, Howard, and Chrissie. Tom decides that the family should flee to an abandoned snowplow on the streets outside. Omi sacrifices herself to distract Krampus, who emerges from the fireplace and attacks her with his bag of toys. Outside, Tom, Sarah, and Linda are dragged under the snow while Stevie is captured by the elves. Krampus confronts Max and gives him a bell bauble wrapped in a piece of his discarded letter. After Stevie was tossed into a hole leading into Hell by the elves, Max honestly apologizes for losing his spirit, and although Krampus seems to accept his apology, he still tosses Max into Hell. Max awakens in his house on Christmas morning. Discovering his family alive and well downstairs, he thinks that what happened was just a nightmare. However, when he unwraps a present to reveal Krampus' bauble, the family realizes the horrors of Christmas Eve indeed occurred, each having independently also assumed the night to have been a nightmare. The camera pans out to show the family and their house is in a snow globe in Krampus' workshop, surrounded by other similar snow globes, later then, the audience would then be jumpscared by Krampus's nightmarish toys. ==Cast== * Emjay Anthony as Max Engel * Adam Scott as Tom Engel * Toni Collette as Sarah Engel * David Koechner as Howard * Allison Tolman as Linda * Krista Stadler as Omi Engel * Conchata Ferrell as Aunt Dorothy * Stefania LaVie Owen as Beth Engel * Lolo Owen as Stevie * Queenie Samuel as Jordan * Maverick Flack as Howie Jr. * Mark Atkin as Ketkr\u00f3kur * Sage Hunefeld as Baby Chrissie * Leith Towers as Derek * Curtis Vowell as DHL Man * Luke Hawker as Krampus (in-suit performer) * Brett Beattie as Der Klown (Jack-in-the-box) ===Voices=== * Gideon Emery as Krampus * Seth Green as Gingerbread Man Lumpy * Breehn Burns as Gingerbread Man Dumpy * Justin Roiland as Gingerbread Man Clumpy * Ivy George as Perchta the Cherub ==Production== ===Development=== Dougherty had \"always wanted to do a scary Christmas movie\", but the idea did not take form until his friends sent him an e-card featuring the Krampus creature which was, according to him \"just love at first sight.\" Although this, according to Dougherty, happened in \"the ancient times of the internet\" the project would not be fleshed out until 2011, at which point he would team up with Zach Shields and Todd Casey to figure out the story. ===Casting=== On November 21, 2014, Allison Tolman and Emjay Anthony joined the cast. On March 3, 2015, Adam Scott, David Koechner, and Toni Collette joined the cast. ===Filming=== Principal photography began on March 12, 2015 and officially wrapped in May 2015. ===Visual effects=== Creature effects were made by Weta Workshop. ===Music=== The score was composed by Douglas Pipes and released on a double LP by Waxwork Records in 2018. ==Release== (L-R) Moderator Chris Hardwick, director Michael Dougherty, and cast members Toni Collette and Adam Scott at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film.

In North America, Krampus earned $637,000 from its Thursday night showings, which began at 7 p.m., and topped the box office on its opening day with $6 million. It rose 9.9% on Saturday over Friday, a rare occurrence for a horror film. It went on to earn $16.3 million through its opening weekend from 2,902 theaters, which was above expectations and finished in second place at the box office, ahead of The Good Dinosaur, but behind The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2 ($18.6 million), which was on its third weekend. Scott Mendelson of Forbes felt the successful opening was attributed to the horror genre which was something of a new, unique and genuinely different offering at that time (the last time a Christmas-themed horror film opened was in 2006 with Black Christmas). However, he also stated that had Universal not embargoed the reviews two days prior to its release, a wave of mostly positive reviews dropping a few days before release would have boosted its opening accordingly. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 127 reviews, with an average rating of 6.07/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Krampus is gory good fun for fans of non-traditional holiday horror with a fondness for Joe Dante's B-movie classics, even if it doesn't have quite the savage bite its concept calls for.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale. The horror blog, praised the film for its twist on Christmas themes, acting, and practical effects, stating: \"I will defend this movie with my Sword of Stubborness until I die, surrounded by haters trying to dismantle my praise.\" ==See also== * Holiday horror * Krampus in popular culture * List of comedy- horror films ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 horror films Category:2010s comedy horror films Category:2015 fantasy films Category:2010s Christmas films Category:2010s comedy thriller films Category:American films Category:New Zealand films Category:English-language films Category:American Christmas films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American satirical films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Christmas comedy films Category:Christmas horror films Category:New Zealand Christmas films Category:Dark fantasy films Category:Demons in film Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films about elves Category:Films based on European myths and legends Category:Films produced by Thomas Tull Category:Films with live action and animation Category:Legendary Pictures films Category:Krampus in popular culture Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films directed by Michael Dougherty Category:Films produced by Michael Dougherty Category:Films with screenplays by Michael Dougherty Category:Films scored by Douglas Pipes Category:2015 comedy films ",
