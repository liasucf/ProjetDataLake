    "text": "Walter X. Young (1918\u20131942) was an officer of the United States Marine Corps during World War II who received the Navy Cross posthumously for his actions. ==Biography== Walter Xavier Young was born in Chicago, Illinois, on 22 October 1918. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve on 6 January 1941, and following training at the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on 29 May 1941. After commissioning, Second Lieutenant Young received training at the U.S. Army Signal Corps School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and was then assigned to the Marine Barracks New River, North Carolina, into 1942. Promoted to First Lieutenant on 6 June 1942 Young was communications officer of the 1st Marine Parachute Battalion, which took part in the initial landings of the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Solomon Islands. During the extremely dangerous initial landings on Gavutu, First Lieutenant Young singlehandedly assaulted a Japanese-held dugout commanding a portion of the dock on the island, which was a key objective. While successfully penetrating and neutralizing the dugout, Young was wounded by rifle fire, and died later that day. ==Awards== For his heroic action in the Battle of Gavutu-Tanambogo, First Lieutenant Young was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously. ==Namesakes== In February 1944, the United States Navy destroyer escort USS Walter X. Young (DE-723) was named for First Lieutenant Young. Her construction was cancelled in March 1944. The destroyer escort USS Walter X. Young (DE-715) was then named in his honor. During construction, she was converted into the fast transport USS Walter X. Young (APD-131), and was in commission as such from 1945 to 1946. ==See also== ==References== : ==External links== * Category:1918 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Chicago Category:Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States) Category:United States Marine Corps officers Category:American Marine Corps personnel killed in World War II Category:Military personnel from Illinois ",
