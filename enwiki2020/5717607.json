    "text": "Birkenhead North TMD is a traction maintenance depot, which is owned by Network Rail and located opposite Birkenhead North railway station, currently responsible for servicing and stabling Merseyrail's fleet of Class 507 and 508 electric multiple units. Birkenhead North's current depot code is BD, having been changed from BN in 1976. ==History== ===Early history=== The former Bidston Shed, which was allocated the shed code 6F, was situated on the opposite side of the tracks, and slightly further towards Bidston, from the depot. An Ordnance Survey map shows that the site of Birkenhead North TMD was occupied by a railway depot by 1899, although an exact date of opening is unknown. However, the actual Birkenhead North engine shed, as it was then named, was located to the north of the present depot, on the goods line to the docks.Disused Stations: Birkenhead North engine shed ===Recent history=== The entrance gates of Birkenhead North TMD In 1985 and 1986, in order to celebrate the 100th anniversary of railways in the area, an \"100 Years of Mersey Railways\" was held. Birkenhead North depot was used to hold two open days, and during both events, a number of mainline locomotives were on display at the depot. Among the locomotives which were included in the celebratory events were a Class 40 locomotive (40122, ex D200) as well as a Class 50 locomotive (50007 Sir Edward Elgar, ex Hercules).Rail magazine Issue 58 - \"Merseyrail 100 celebrations\" ===Future=== Merseyrail's fleet of and 508 units is scheduled to be replaced between 2019 and 2021 by a fleet of units built by Stadler Rail at Bussnang, Switzerland. As part of the overall fleet replacement project, which will cost \u00a3460 million, both Kirkdale and Birkenhead North depots will be upgraded to a standard which will be capable of maintaining the new trains. As part of its refurbishment, Birkenhead North TMD will have its carriage wash plant upgraded, with the depot becoming more of a focus for cleaning, stabling and light maintenance, a role which is currently fulfilled by Kirkdale TMD. Unlike with the arrangement for the current fleet of Class 507 and 508 units, Birkenhead North will not be the main maintenance hub for the new fleet of Class 777s, with this role being assigned to a rebuilt Kirkdale depot instead. ==Allocation== Currently, and electric multiple units are based at Birkenhead North depot. From 2020 onwards, units will be allocated here. Previously, battery locomotives and locos have been stored at the depot in the past for sandite duties in the winter. Network Rail stables its MPV diesel unit(s) here occasionally during the leaf fall season. Departmental equipment for Sandite duties has in the past included Class 73 (/0 and /9), Class 97/7 and traction. Four diesel shunters (03073, 03162, 03170 and 03189) were also previously allocated to Birkenhead North depot. These locomotives were deployed on dock shunting duties on the now disused Birkenhead Dock Branch, serving in this role until 1989. After the Class 03s became surplus to requirements, all four examples were sold to railway heritage preservation groups. ==References== ===Sources=== * * ==Further reading== * ===Other media=== * ==External links== Category:Railway depots in England Category:Rail transport in Merseyside ",
