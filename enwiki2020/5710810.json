    "text": "Sur la Mer is the thirteenth album by The Moody Blues. It was released in 1988. It features the hit single \"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\", a sequel to their 1986 hit \"Your Wildest Dreams\". Much of the music on the album would fit in the \"synthpop\" genre, though it does bear more rock and acoustic influences than its predecessor. Flautist and vocalist Ray Thomas did not appear on the album, although he remained a member of the band at the time during which it was recorded. ==Original track listing== ===Side One=== #\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\" (Justin Hayward) \u2013 6:37 #\"Want to Be with You\" (Hayward, John Lodge) \u2013 4:48 #\"River of Endless Love\" (Hayward, Lodge) \u2013 4:45 #\"No More Lies\" (Hayward) \u2013 5:13 #\"Here Comes the Weekend\" (Lodge) \u2013 4:13 ===Side Two=== #\"Vintage Wine\" (Hayward) \u2013 3:38 #\"Breaking Point\" (Hayward, Lodge) \u2013 4:56 #\"Miracle\" (Hayward, Lodge) \u2013 4:56 #\"Love Is on the Run\" (Lodge) \u2013 5:00 #\"Deep\" (Hayward) \u2013 6:50 ==Personnel== *Justin Hayward \u2013 vocals, guitars, keyboards, drum sequencing *John Lodge \u2013 vocals, bass guitar, keyboards, drum sequencing *Graeme Edge \u2013 drums, percussion *Patrick Moraz \u2013 keyboards, synthesizers, arrangements ==Production== *Produced by Tony Visconti *Engineered & Mixed By Tony Visconti, Paul Cartledge & Sam Smith ==Chart positions== Album \u2014 Billboard (United States) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" !Year !Chart !Position |- |1988 |align=\"left\"|The Billboard 200 |38 |} Singles \u2014 Billboard (United States) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- |1988 |align=\"left\"|\"Here Comes the Weekend\" |align=\"left\"|Mainstream Rock Tracks |50 |- |1988 |align=\"left\"|\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\" |align=\"left\"|Adult Contemporary |9 |- |1988 |align=\"left\"|\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\" |align=\"left\"|Mainstream Rock Tracks |2 |- |1988 |align=\"left\"|\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\" |align=\"left\"|Billboard Hot 100 |30 |- |1988 |align=\"left\"|\"No More Lies\" |align=\"left\"|Adult Contemporary |15 |} == References == ==External links== *\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\" Music Video (YouTube) *\"No More Lies\" Music Video (YouTube) Sur la Mer Category:Albums produced by Tony Visconti Sur la Mer Category:Polydor Records albums ",
