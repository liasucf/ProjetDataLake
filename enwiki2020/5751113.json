    "text": "Loving Day is an annual celebration held on June 12, the anniversary of the 1967 United States Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia which struck down all anti-miscegenation laws remaining in sixteen U.S. states. In the United States, anti-miscegenation laws were U.S. state laws banning interracial marriage, mainly forbidding marriage between two different races, until the Warren Court ruled unanimously in 1967 that these state laws were unconstitutional. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the court majority opinion that \"the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.\" Loving Day is not an officially recognized holiday by the U.S. government, despite attempts to make it so. Loving Day is the biggest multiracial celebration in the United States. ==History== Loving Day originated with the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia, which invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage. The case was brought by Mildred Loving (), a woman classified as \"colored\" under Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, and Richard Loving, a white man, who first met when she was 11 and he was 17. He was a family friend and over the years they courted. After she became pregnant, they married in Washington, D.C., in 1958, when she was 18. Reportedly, Mildred did not realize that interracial marriage was illegal, and they were arrested a few weeks after they returned to their hometown north of Richmond, Virginia. They pleaded guilty to charges of \"cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth\", and avoided jail time by leaving Virginia and agreeing not to return to the state for 25 years. The Lovings moved to Washington, D.C., and began legal action by writing to U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\"Mildred Loving, Key Figure in Civil Rights Era, Dies\" , PBS Online News Hour, May 6, 2008 Kennedy referred the case to the American Civil Liberties Union. After the Warren Court unanimously ruled in favor of the young couple, they returned to Virginia, where they lived with their three children. In 1975, Richard Loving died in a car accident. Mildred Loving died May 5, 2008, at the age of 68.Martin, Douglas. \"Mildred Loving, Who Battled Ban on Mixed-Race Marriage, Dies at 68\" , New York Times, May 6, 2008. Each June 12, the anniversary of the ruling, Loving Day events around the country mark the advances of mixed-race couples. ==Legacy== Many organizations sponsor annual parties across the country, with Lovingday.org providing an online legal map, courtroom history of anti- miscegenation laws, as well as offering testimonials by and resources for interracial couples. Inspired by Juneteenth (which commemorates the end of slavery in the state of Texas), Loving Day seeks both to commemorate and celebrate the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling, keeping its importance fresh in the minds of a generation which has grown up with interracial relationships being legal, as well as explore issues facing couples currently in interracial relationships. The Loving Day website features information, including court transcripts of the Loving v. Virginia case and of other court cases in which the legality of anti-miscegenation laws was challenged. To celebrate the holiday, people are encouraged to hold parties in which the case and its modern-day legacy are discussed, in smaller settings such as living rooms, backyards, etc., as well as in larger gatherings. Ken Tanabe is credited with forming the idea for Loving Day. He created the idea in 2004 for his senior thesis at Parsons the New School of Design. ==In popular culture== *Loving, a 2016 film starring Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton as Mildred and Richard Loving, directed by Jeff Nichols.
