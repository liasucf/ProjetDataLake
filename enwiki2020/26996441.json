Prince was released with high expectations among audience, considering the director's previous release Baashha being a major success, but it underperformed at the box office. About the unexpected failure, Krishna said: \"Mohanlal is a superstar in Kerala but not for his heroics or the other attributes associated with a Tamil or Telugu superstar. Maybe it was an error of judgement on my part. Even the producer did not find anything wrong with the gimmicks. But the people didn't appreciate them. Rajni (Rajinikanth) liked the film very much. Lal's change of voice also seemed to backfire. People thought someone else had dubbed for him. After a throat surgery, his voice had undergone a change. Eventually, he had to issue a statement that it was his own voice. It was like what had happened to Amitabh Bachchan in Agneepath.\"http://www.screenindia.com/old/nov28/south.htm Even though, the Telugu dubbed version of the film was a superhit when it released in Andhra Pradesh. == References == == External links == * Category:1996 films Category:1990s Malayalam-language films Category:Indian films Category:Malayalam-language films Category:Films directed by Suresh Krissna Category:Films scored by Deva (composer) ",
