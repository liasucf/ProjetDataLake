The disease is caused by trypanosomes of several species in the genus Trypanosoma such as Trypanosoma brucei. Trypanosoma vivax causes nagana mainly in West Africa, although it has spread to South America. The trypanosomes infect the blood of the vertebrate host, causing fever, weakness, and lethargy, which lead to weight loss and anemia; in some animals the disease is fatal unless treated. The trypanosomes are transmitted by tsetse flies. An interesting feature is the remarkable tolerance to nagana pathology shown by some breeds of cattle, notably the N'Dama \u2013 a West African Bos taurus breed. This contrasts with the susceptibility shown by East African Bos indicus cattle such as the zebu. ==Transmission== Most trypanosomes develop in tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), its biological vector, in about one to a few weeks. When an infected tsetse fly bites an animal, the parasites are transmitted through its saliva. It can also be spread by fomites such as surgical instruments, needles, and syringes. The most important vectors are thought to be horseflies (Tabanidae spp.) and stable flies (Stomoxys spp.). The immune response of animals may be unable to eliminate trypanosomes completely, and the host may become an inapparent carrier. These inapparent infections can be reactivated if the animal is stressed. Transplacental transmission can also occur. ==Signs and symptoms== The incubation period ranges from 4 days to approximately 8 weeks. The infection leads to significant weight loss and anemia. Various symptoms are observed, including fever, oedema, adenitis, dermatitis and nervous disorders. The disease cannot be diagnosed with certainty except physically detecting parasites by blood microscopic examination or various serological reactions. == Vectors == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Disease !Species affected !Trypanosoma agents !Distribution !Glossina vectors |- |Nagana \u2014 acute form |antelope cattle camels horses |T. brucei brucei |Africa |G. morsitans G. swynnertoni G. pallidipes G. palpalis G. tachinoides G. fuscipes |- |Nagana \u2014 chronic form |cattle camels horses |T. congolense |Africa |G. palpalis G. morsitans G. austeni G. swynnertoni G. pallidipes G. longipalpis G. tachinoides G. brevipalpis |- |Nagana \u2014 acute form |domestic pigs cattle camels horses |T. simiae |Africa |G. palpalis G. fuscipes G. morsitans G. tachinoides G. longipalpis G. fusca G. tabaniformis G. brevipalpis G. vanhoofi G. austeni |- |Nagana \u2014 acute form |cattle camels horses |T. vivax |Africa |G. morsitans G. palpalis G. tachinoides G. swynnertoni G. pallidipes G. austeni G. vanhoofi G. longipalpis |} == Control measures == If the outbreak is detected early, the organism can be destroyed by quarantines, movement controls, and the euthanasia of infected animals. Tsetse fly populations can be reduced or eliminated by traps, insecticides, and by treating infected animals with antiparasitic drugs. The tsetse habitat can be destroyed by alteration of vegetation. Some drugs can prevent trypanosomiasis, and are called prophylactic drugs. These are very effective in protecting animals during the times they are exposed to diseases. Historically, these drugs were not used properly, leading to some resistance. ==References== ==Further reading== *WHO fact sheet on Trypanosomiasis Category:Parasitology Category:Bovine diseases Category:Livestock ",
