    "text": "Gerald Mohr (June 11, 1914 \u2013 November 9, 1968) was an American radio, film, and television character actor and frequent leading man, who appeared in more than 500 radio plays, 73 films, and over 100 television shows. ==Early years== Gerald Mohr in the CBS Radio series The Adventures of Philip Marlowe (1948\u20131951) Mohr was born in Manhattan to Henrietta (n\u00e9e Neustadt), a singer, and Sigmond Mohr. He was educated in Dwight Preparatory School in Manhattan, where he learned to speak fluent French and German and also learned to ride horses and play the piano. At Columbia University, where he was on a course to become a doctor, Mohr was struck with appendicitis and was recovering in a hospital when another patient, a radio broadcaster, realised Mohr's pleasant baritone voice would be ideal for radio. Mohr was hired by the radio station and became a junior reporter. ==Stage== In the mid-1930s, Orson Welles invited him to join his formative Mercury Theatre. During his time with Welles, Mohr gained theatrical experience on Broadway in The Petrified Forest and starred in Jean Christophe. ==Radio== Mohr made more than 500 appearances in radio roles throughout the 1930s, '40s, and early '50s. One of his early starring roles on radio was as a replacement for Matt Crowley for a brief interval in Jungle Jim in 1938. He starred as Raymond Chandler's hardboiled detective, Philip Marlowe, 1948\u20131951, in 119 half-hour radio plays. He also starred in The Adventures of Bill Lance, and as Michael Lanyard in The Lone Wolf. He was one of the actors who portrayed Archie Goodwin in The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe, frequently starred in The Whistler, and acted in different roles in multiple episodes of Damon Runyon Theater and Frontier Town. He played multiple roles in the anthology series Crime Is My Pastime and was the narrator for the serial Woman from Nowhere. Other radio appearances include The Jack Benny Program, Our Miss Brooks, The Shadow of Fu Manchu, Box 13, Escape, and Lux Radio Theatre. In the early 1950s, Mohr made a series of recordings for the Voice of America. Unlike most material for the VOA, these were intended for broadcast by radio stations in the United States, with the goal of debunking propaganda broadcast from behind the Iron Curtain. ==Film== Mohr began appearing in films in the late 1930s, playing his first villain role in the 15-part cliffhanger serial Jungle Girl (1941). After three years' service in the US Army Air Forces during World War II, he returned to Hollywood, starring as Michael Lanyard in three movies of The Lone Wolf series in 1946\u201347. He made cameo appearances in Gilda (1946) and Detective Story (1951), and co-starred in \"The Magnificent Rogue\" (1946) and The Sniper (1952) In 1964 Mohr, together with his second wife Mai, planned the formation of an international film company, headquartered in Stockholm, with Swedish and American writers. The company was to have featured comedy, adventure, crime, and drama shows for worldwide distribution. By then fluent in Swedish, he also planned to star in a film for TV in which his character, a newspaperman, would speak only Swedish. In 1964, he made a comedy Western, filmed in Stockholm and on location in Yugoslavia, called Wild West Story in which, unusually, the good guys spoke Swedish and the bad guys (Mohr, inter alia) spoke in English. He also essayed Captain Vadim, an Iron Curtain submarine commander, in the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \"The Lost Bomb\". He continued to market his powerful voice, playing Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic) in the Fantastic Four cartoon series during 1967 and Green Lantern in the 1968 animated series Aquaman. In 1968, he appeared in his last film role, as Tom Branca in William Wyler's Funny Girl, before guest-starring in the TV Western series The Big Valley. He sang in the 1956 Cheyenne episode \"Rendezvous at Red Rock\". ==Television== From the 1950s on, he appeared as a guest star in more than 100 television series, including the Westerns The Californians, Maverick, Johnny Ringo, The Alaskans, Lawman, Cheyenne (as Pat Keogh in episode \"Rendezvous at Red Rock\"/as Elmer Bostrum in episode \"Incident at Dawson Flats\"), Bronco, Overland Trail (as James Addison Reavis, \"the Baron of Arizona\", in the episode \"The Baron Comes Back\"), Sugarfoot, Bonanza (as Phil Reed in the episode \"The Abduction\", as Collins in the episode \"Found Child\", as Cato Troxell in the episode \"A Girl Named George\"), The Rifleman, Wanted: Dead or Alive (episode \"Till Death do us Part\"), Death Valley Days (as Andr\u00e9s Pico in \"The Firebrand\"), and Rawhide.In 1949, he was co-announcer, along with Fred Foy, and narrator of 16 of the shows of the first season of The Lone Ranger, speaking the well-known introduction as well as story details.

In 1954\u20131955, he starred as Christopher Storm in 41 episodes of the third season of Foreign Intrigue, produced in Stockholm for American distribution. During several episodes of Foreign Intrigue, but most noticeably in \"The Confidence Game\" and \"The Playful Prince\", he can be heard playing on the piano his own musical composition, \"The Frontier Theme\", so called because Christopher Storm was the owner of the Hotel Frontier in Vienna. Foreign Intrigue was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1954 under the category \"Best Mystery, Action or Adventure Program\" and again in 1955 under the category \"Best Mystery or Intrigue Series\". Mohr guest-starred seven times in the 1957\u201362 television series Maverick, twice playing Western gambler Doc Holliday, a role he reprised again in \"Doc Holliday in Durango\", a 1958 episode of Tombstone Territory. In one of the other \"Maverick\" episodes, he portrayed Steve Corbett, a character based on Bogart's in Casablanca.
