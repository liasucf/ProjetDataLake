    "text": "Vector NTI is a commercial bioinformatics software package used by many life scientists to work, among other things, with nucleic acids and proteins in silico.http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/VectorNTI/Documentation/VectorNTI/Introduction.htmhttp://biodoc.ist.unomaha.edu/wiki/Vector_NTI It allows researchers to, for example, plan a DNA cloning experiment on the computer before actually performing it in the lab. It was originally created by InforMax Inc, North Bethesda, MD. Initially released for free, it was locked and turned into a commercial software after 2008 which created problems for locked in users who were forced to buy the software to continue accessing their data on newer computers.http://www.protocol-online.org/biology- forums/posts/41708.html What was previously a single software package has been split into Vector NTI Express, Advanced, and Express Designer.http://www.lifetechnologies.com/de/de/home/life- science/cloning/vector-nti-software.html Vector NTI has been discontinued by its corporate parent Thermo Fisher. Support will cease as of December 31, 2020. https://www.thermofisher.com/content/dam/LifeTech/global/life- sciences/Cloning/Images/TFS_Vector-NTI-Software_FAQ.pdf == Features == * create, annotate, analyse, and share DNA/protein sequences * perform and save BLAST searches * design primers for PCR, cloning, sequencing or hybridisation experiments * plan cloning and run gels in silico * align multiple protein or DNA sequences * search NCBI\u2019s Entrez, view, and save DNAs, proteins, and citations * edit chromatogram data, assemble into contigs == See also == * Bioinformatics * Cloning vector * Computational biology * Expression vector * List of open source bioinformatics software * Restriction map * Vector (molecular biology) * Vector DNA ==References== == External links == Description of software * Vector NTI homepage at Invitrogen.com * Vector NTI at openwetware.org * Vector NTI v10 (only PC) Tutorials * Vector NTI tutorial at NorthWestern.edu * * Other * description of Vector NTI Viewer Category:Bioinformatics software ",
