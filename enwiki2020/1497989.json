His mother was Eleanor, daughter of James Sutton. He was educated at Harrow and Oriel College, Oxford. ==Political career== Estcourt was elected to Parliament as MP for Marlborough in 1829. He was elected to parliament again in 1835 as MP for Devizes, switched to North Wiltshire in 1844, and continued in the Commons until 1865. Sotheron resumed the name Estcourt in 1855, and entered Lord Derby's second government in 1858 as President of the Poor Law Board. The next year, he became Home Secretary, but the government soon fell. He had been sworn of the Privy Council in 1858. ==Family== Sotheron-Estcourt married Lucy Sarah, daughter of Admiral Frank Sotheron, in 1830. In 1839 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Sotheron in lieu of his patronymic in order to inherit his father-in-law's property. However, in 1853 he resumed by Royal licence the surname of Estcourt in addition to that of Sotheron. He retired from public life in 1863 after a paralytic seizure. He died in January 1876, aged 74. His wife had died in 1870. Sotheron-Estcourt's estates passed to his nephew George Bucknall-Estcourt, who assumed the surname of Sotheron-Estcourt and was created Baron Estcourt in 1903. ==References== * == External links == * Category:1801 births Category:1876 deaths Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Alumni of Oriel College, Oxford Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:UK MPs 1835\u20131837 Category:UK MPs 1837\u20131841 Category:UK MPs 1841\u20131847 Category:UK MPs 1847\u20131852 Category:UK MPs 1852\u20131857 Category:UK MPs 1857\u20131859 Category:UK MPs 1859\u20131865 ",
