    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui La Chira (14 June 1894 \u2013 16 April 1930) was a Peruvian intellectual, journalist, activist and political philosopher. A prolific writer before his early death at the age of 35, he is considered one of the most influential Latin American socialists of the 20th century. Mari\u00e1tegui's Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality (1928) is still widely read in South America, and called \"one of the broadest, deepest, and most enduring works of the Latin American century\".Enrique Krauze, \"Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui: Indigenous Marxism\" in Redeemers: Ideas and Power in Latin America. Translated by Hank Heifetz and Natasha Wimmer. New York: HarperCollins 2011, p. 89. An avowed self-taught Marxist, he insisted that a socialist revolution should evolve organically in Latin America based on local conditions and practices, not the result of mechanically applying a European formula. Although best known as a political thinker, his literary writings have gained attention by scholars.Eugenio Chang-Rodr\u00edguez, \"Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 3, p. 523. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. == Life and works == One of three children, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui was born in Moquegua, although his pious Catholic mother, Mar\u00eda Amalia La Chira Ballejos, led him to believe he was born in Lima.Krauze, \"Mari\u00e1tegui\", p. 90. His father, Francisco Javier Mari\u00e1tegui Requejo, abandoned his family when Jos\u00e9 Carlos was young. To support her children, Jos\u00e9 Carlos' mother, moved first to Lima, then to Huacho, where she had more relatives who helped her make a living. Jos\u00e9 Carlos had a brother and a sister: Julio C\u00e9sar and Guillermina. In 1902, as a young schoolboy, he badly injured his left leg in an accident and was moved to a hospital in Lima. Despite a four-year-long convalescence, his leg remained fragile and he was unable to continue his studies. This was the first of a series of health problems that plagued him throughout his life. Although he was unable to continue formal schooling, Mari\u00e1tegui read widely and taught himself French.Krauze, \"Mari\u00e1tegui\", p. 91. Though he hoped to become a Roman Catholic priest, at the age of fourteen he started working at a newspaper, first as an errand boy, then as a linotypist, then eventually as a writer. The linotypist he assisted, Juan Manuel Campos, introduced him to an anarchist intellectual, Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Prada. Gonz\u00e1lez Prada had made a name for himself in a denunciation of the corruption and incompetence of Peru's rulers, and especially the condition of Peruvian peasants due to the monopolization of land by a small group of gamonales (landowners), an analysis that influenced Mari\u00e1tegui's later writings.Krauze, \"Mari\u00e1tegui\", p. 92. Mari\u00e1tegui worked in daily journalism for La Prensa and also for the magazine Mundo Lime\u00f1o. In 1916, he left his first employer to join a new daily, El Tiempo, which had a more leftist orientation. Two years later he launched his magazine, only to find that the owners of El Tiempo refused to print it. This led him to break with El Tiempo and launch a newspaper called La Raz\u00f3n, which became his first major venture in left-wing journalism. In 1918, \"nauseated by Creole politics,\" he wrote in an autobiographical note, \"I turned resolutely toward socialism\". The newspaper led by Mari\u00e1tegui waged a vigorous defense of the campaign then underway for reform of the universities and went on to become a tribunal for the defense of the young labor movement. La Raz\u00f3n supported a strike for the eight-hour day held in May 1919, along with lowering the cost of subsistence goods. The paper\u2019s aggressive radicalism brought it into conflict with the Legu\u00eda government, and it was rumored that the ruling circles gave Mari\u00e1tegui a choice: exile or jail.Krauze, \"Mari\u00e1tegui\" p. 97. In any event, Mari\u00e1tegui left for Europe in 1920, traveling through France, Germany, Austria and eventually living in Italy for two years. In France, he met with Georges Sorel. He was rather taken with the voluntarist, unorthodox Marxism of Sorel, which he saw the qualities of in the rise of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. During his time in Italy, he married an Italian woman, Anna Chiappe,Chang-Rodr\u00edguez, \"Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 3, p. 522. with whom he had four children. He was in Italy during the Turin factory occupations of 1920, and in January 1921 he was present at the Livorno Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, where the historic split occurred that led to the formation of the Communist Party. By the time he left the country in 1922, Benito Mussolini was already on his way to power. In his writings from that period, Mari\u00e1tegui observed that fascism was a response to deep social crisis, that it based itself on the petty bourgeoisie of town and country, and that it relied heavily on a cult of violence. According to him, fascism was the price that a society in crisis paid for the failures of the left. Upon his return to Peru in 1923, he began giving in lectures to the Student Federation in the People\u2019s University and writing articles about the European situation. He also began using Marxist methods to study Peru. Mari\u00e1tegui also came into contact with and allied himself with V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre, leader of the populist movement American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA). In October 1923, Haya de la Torre was deported by the Legu\u00eda government, leaving Mari\u00e1tegui as the editor of the magazine Claridad. The fifth issue of the publication in March 1924 was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin. September 1926 cover of Amauta In 1924, Mari\u00e1tegui nearly died, and his injured leg had to be amputated. In 1926, he established the journal Amauta to serve as a forum for discussions of socialism, art, and culture in Peru and all of Latin America. In 1927, he was arrested and confined to a military hospital, and later subject to house arrest. He briefly considered relocating to Montevideo or Buenos Aires. In 1928, Mari\u00e1tegui became alienated from the APRA, and he set about establishing the Socialist Party, which formally constituted in October of that year, with Mari\u00e1tegui as general secretary (it later became the Communist Party of Peru). That year, he published his best-known work, Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality, in which he examined Peru's social and economic situation from a Marxist perspective. It was considered one of the first materialist analyses of a Latin American society. Beginning with the country\u2019s economic history, the book proceeds to a discussion of the \"Indian problem\", which Mari\u00e1tegui locates firmly within the \"land problem\". Other essays are devoted to public education, religion, regionalism and centralism, and literature. Also in the same work, Mari\u00e1tegui blamed the latifundistas, or large land- owners, for the stilted economy of the country and the miserable conditions of the indigenous peoples in the region. He observed that Peru at the time had many characteristics of a feudal society. He argued that a transition to socialism should be based on traditional forms of collectivism as practiced by the Indians. In a famous phrase, Mari\u00e1tegui stated \"the communitarianism of the Incas cannot be denied or disparaged for having evolved under an autocratic regime.\" In 1929, Mari\u00e1tegui participated in the establishment of the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers (CGTP), which then sent a delegate to Montevideo for the Constituent Congress of the Latin American Trade Union Conference. Mari\u00e1tegui died on April 16, 1930, in Lima of complications from his earlier affliction. His house at Jir\u00f3n Washington in the center of Lima was later turned into a museum. == Influence == In different ways, organizations like Shining Path, and the T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, and the Peruvian Communist Party all look towards Mari\u00e1tegui and his writings. Mari\u00e1tegui's ideas have recently seen a major revival due to the rise of leftist governments all over South America, in particular in Bolivia was in 2005 Evo Morales became that country's first-ever indigenous president since the Conquest 500 years earlier (second in Latin America following Mexico's Benito Ju\u00e1rez). The rise of popular indigenous movements in Ecuador and Peru have also sparked a renewed interest in Mari\u00e1tegui's writings concerning the role of indigenous peoples in a Latin American revolution. The previous ruling party in Peru, the Peruvian Nationalist Party, claims Mari\u00e1tegui as one of its ideological founders. == Quotes == * Italian fascism represents, clearly, the anti-revolution or, as it is usually called, the counter-revolution. The fascist offensive is explained and is realized in Italy, as a consequence of a retreat or a defeat of the revolution. * I am self-taught. I once registered in Arts in Lima, but only in the interest of taking an erudite Augustine\u2019s Latin course. And, in Europe, I freely attended some courses, but without ever deciding to lose my extra- collegiate, and perhaps anti-collegiate, status.Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui, Autobiographical Note. January 10, 1927. * Peru is a semi-feudal and semi- colonial country at the same time. Though this may seem like a paradox, this is a fact and has to be changed. * The fight is long and tough, but together we can make it. Mari\u00e1tegui is also responsible for coining the phrase, about Marxism, sendero luminoso al futuro (\"the Shining Path to the future\"). This phrase later became the name of the Shining Path Maoist organization in Peru as a means of differentiating them from other Communist groups (they preferred to be called the Communist Party of Peru). == Works == * The Heroic and Creative Meaning of Socialism Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui.
