    "text": "\"Heart and Soul\" is a song by British pop band T'Pau. Featuring vocalist Carol Decker, the song was released as the group's first single in 1987 from their debut album Bridge of Spies. Following its inclusion in a Pepe Jeans advert, the single reached No. 4 in both the US and UK charts. ==Song information== The song is notable for its usage of various vocal overdubs. This makes the song, in its initial studio form, impossible to perform live without additional backup singers. Instead, Decker often performs what she calls a \"basic\" version, explaining to Songfacts: \"I rap the first two verses then cut to the melody for the verse before the chorus. No one really notices or minds as I cover the essential dynamics of the song. It works well.\" Upon its initial release in April 1987, the song was not well received in the UK, entering the bottom of the chart and falling out immediately after.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/11710826/TPaus- Carol-Decker-I-struggled-to-count-the-zeros-on-my-first-royalty-cheque-but-Im- still-paying-the-mortgage-at-58.html In the US, however, the song received heavy airplay and the Pepe Jeans advertisement enabled it to reach No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1987.https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1987-08-08 Due to the exposure, the song was re-released in the UK that same month and this time, it became a hit, equaling the US peak of No. 4 in September.https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19870913/7501/ ==Packaging and title== The single artwork was designed by graphic designer Adrian Fry. ==Cultural references== * The song was featured on the soundtrack for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City and was featured in the opening credits of the 2017 film Don't Talk to Irene. * The song featured in the episode San Junipero of the Netflix series Black Mirror, written and created by Charlie Brooker. * The song featured in the 2019 comedy horror film We Summon the Darkness. ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1987\u201388) !Peak position !Total weeks |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) N.B.
