His feelings for poetry and Nynorsk were awakened when he was a student at the folk high school in Sogndal. One of his teachers, Jens Kv\u00e5le, published the Nynorsk periodical Ungdom (Youth),Haffner, Vilhelm, Karl Sofus Marius Bj\u00f8rnstad, & Tallak Olsen Lindst\u00f8l. 1949. Stortinget og Statsr\u00e5det 1915\u20131945. Oslo: Aschehoug, p. 427. in which Austb\u00f8 published his first poem. After graduating from folk high school, he attended the teachers' college in Elverum, where he passed his teaching exam in 1901.Bj\u00f8rkum, Andreas, & Jarle Bondevik. 1979. Dikting og diktarar fr\u00e5 Sogn. Sogn: Historielaget for Sogn, p. 373. Soon afterwards he was hired as a teacher, and he taught his first year in Fr\u00f8nningen and Fresvik. In 1906 he moved to the island of Leps\u00f8ya in Hordaland County, before establishing himself in Skotselv in Buskerud County in 1912. There he served as a teacher at the army school and the Skotselv school for several decades. Austb\u00f8 was a central figure in establishing the Norwegian Folk Ballad Society () in the early 1920s. In the book Folkedansen i 20 \u00e5r 1903\u20131923 (Twenty Years of Folk Dance, 1903\u20131923), he described a journey to the Faroe Islands in 1911, where a delegation of 70 Norwegians traveled to better understand traditional Faroese dance. After this, he established youth societies in several places in the country to promote folk dance. Austb\u00f8 served as the head of the Norwegian Folk Ballad Society for many years. He also assisted Torstein H\u00f8verstad in efforts to create a teachers' college in Bondi in the municipality of Asker. Austb\u00f8 wrote extensively for the magazine Nynorsk Vekeblad (Nynorsk Weekly) from its inception in 1934 until his death. He wrote many articles for it, and published several of his own poems in it. In addition, he created a large body of literary work, which included stories, poetry collections, children's books, and biographies of Svend Foyn and Olav Bjaaland. According to Anna Ellefsen of Kongsberg, who taught with Austb\u00f8, it was he that wrote the well- known folk song \"Bind deg ein blomekrans\" (Make Yourself a Flower Wreath). He died in Hokksund in the municipality of \u00d8vre Eiker. ==\"Den svalande vind\"== Austb\u00f8 wrote a variety of songs and melodies. His best-known song is \"Den svalande vind\" (The Cooling Breeze), which he also sang on the radio program Folkemusikkhalvtimen (Half Hour of Folk Music) in 1939. The song has been recorded by numerous artists, such Lillebj\u00f8rn Nilsen, Finn Kalvik, and Helene B\u00f8ksle. The song is based on an old folk song, and Austb\u00f8's lyrics relate the unhappy love story \"Attom fjella her s\u00f8r\" (Behind the Mountains Here in the South). Austb\u00f8 was surprised that a few decades after he had written the song that the lyrics were referred to as a \"folk song from Telemark\" because the melody was from Sogn and the lyrics were his own. ==Family== Johan Austb\u00f8 was the son of the farmer and builder Hans Einarson \u00d8sterb\u00f8 and Sigrid Botolfsdatter M\u00e5ren. He was the grandfather of the pianist H\u00e5kon Austb\u00f8, and the great-grandfather of the photographer Frode Fjerdingstad and the artist Bard Ash. ==Selected works== *Austb\u00f8, Johan (1904).
