    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1814 and 1815 were elections that had the Democratic-Republican Party lose a seat but still retain an overwhelming majority in the United States Senate. Unlike in recent elections, the minority Federalists had gone into the elections with a chance of regaining their long- lost majority had they swept almost all the seats. However, only one seat switched parties. Two seats held by Democratic-Republicans were left unfilled until long after the next Congress began. As these elections were prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, Senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Change in composition == === Before the elections === Composition after June 1814 special election in New Hampshire. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=800px |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR |- | colspan=9 style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | DR |- | | F | | F | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F |} === Result of the regular elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=800px |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR |- | colspan=9 style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | DR |- | | F | | F | | F | | V | | V | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F |} {| |- valign=top !
