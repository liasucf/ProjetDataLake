The first known member of this family was Jean Polier, who died in 1602 after being Secretary of the Embassy of France in Geneva, a family which included scholars, professors and officers who served with distinction in the armies of most major powers. He was the son of Jean Jacques de Polier de Bottens (1670-1747), knight banneret of Lausanne and his wife Salom\u00e9e Jeanne Elisabeth Quisard (ca. 1670\u20131735).Genealogie der Familie He first began to study theology in Lausanne then, in order to complete his studies, moved to Leiden University, where he obtained a doctorate in 1739. Back in his home country, de Polier took over a parish in the city of Lausanne. From 1743 he was third, 1754 second, and 1765 first pastor in Lausanne, Seigneur de Bottens, ministre du Saint-\u00c9vangile, 1er pasteur des \u00c9glises de Lausanne. In 1759, he was head of the \"S\u00e9minaire protestant fran\u00e7ais de Lausanne\", and then in 1766 advanced as dean of the chapter. Through an extensive correspondence with Voltaire during the period 1753\u20131759, he was encouraged by the famous thinker to have his writings published by Marc-Michel Bousquet's (1696\u20131762) publishing company. In the realm of his competences, de Polier wrote at least nine but unauthorized articles for the Encyclop\u00e9die by Diderot and D'Alembert: Kijovn, Liturgie, Logomachie, Magicien, Magie, Malachbelus, M\u00e2nes, Maosim and Messie. Voltaire adopted these articles for his Dictionnaire philosophique (1764), but modified extensively passages when they put in question beliefs on a literal interpretation of Scriptures. On April 13, 1744, he married Elisabeth Antoinette Susanne de Lagier-Pluvianes (1722-1769). Both had five daughters and four sons. == Works (selection) == * La Sainte Ecriture de l'Ancien Testament. 6 vol.
