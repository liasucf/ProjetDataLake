Scott, with whom he studied law. In 1861 he set up a partnership with Cameron E. Thom. In 1863 Chapman became city attorney of Los Angeles, replacing Myer J. Newmark, who resigned,Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials 1850\u20131938, Municipal Reference Library, March 1938, reprinted 1946 and in 1868 he was elected district attorney of Los Angeles County.District Attorney 1863-1864 & 1867-1869 He went into partnership with a boyhood friend, Andrew Glassell, when the latter arrived in Los Angeles in 1866. Colonel George H. Smith, a former Confederate Army officer and brother-in-law of Glassell, joined the firm in 1870. Their law practice was confined chiefly to real estate transactions, and they made their fortunes by handling the large partition suits. Chapman was the businessman of the firm. He took his compensation in land, and nearly every final decree in partition would find that Glassell & Chapman had acquired more property. Chapman and Glassell are best known in Orange County for being founders of Orange, California. The firm represented the Yorba and Peralta families in the partitioning of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana in 1867, and had received for a portion of their fees certain large parcels of land in the partition. He joined with one of his partners, Andrew Glassell, to develop a new community, Richland (which would eventually be named Orange). They hired the land surveyor, Frank Lecouvrier of Los Angeles, to map this tract, which they called Richland Farm District. 'Richland' was originally the name of the Virginia plantation owned by the father of Andrew Glassell in the 1830s. A large transaction by Chapman and Glassell was the legal suit known as \"The Great Partition of 1871\", brought against the Verdugo Rancho San Rafael properties on the Los Angeles River and in the Verdugo Mountains. The legal fees were again paid in substantial land transfers.\"Adobes of Rancho San Rafael,\" laokay.com He at one time also owned \"practically all the land\" where Glendale, California, and the suburb of Tropico were established. Chapman continued to practice law until 1880. After retirement, he devoted full-time to managing his rancho in the upper San Gabriel Valley, a portion of the Rancho Santa Anita grant, and became involved in citrus production. ==Family and later life== Chapman had six children by his first marriage to Mary Scott. He married again after her death in 1883, and had one child by his second marriage to Mary L. Stephens, daughter of a pioneer California attorney and judge. Chapman died on January 16, 1915, at the age of 85 in his residence near Sunny Slope in the San Gabriel Valley, \"the result of heart failure following a severe cold.\" Survivors were his wife and children A.S. Chapman and Richard H. Chapman of Los Angeles, William Chapman of Spokane, Washington, and Mrs. L.C. Lantz, Mrs. Charles Lantz and Mrs. Evelyn L. Johnson, all of Los Angeles.\"Pioneer Dies at Ripe Age,\" Los Angeles Times, January 17, 1915, page II-11 ==Legacy== He is often misidentified as the namesake for Chapman University in Orange, however, businessman and citrus magnate Charles C. Chapman actually has that distinction. Chapman Avenue, which bisects the heart of Orange, was indeed named to honor attorney Alfred Beck Chapman.https://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-09/news/mn-1527_1_charles-chapman ==References== Category:1829 births Category:1915 deaths Category:District attorneys in California Category:Los Angeles City Attorneys Category:Land owners from California Category:American people of the Seminole Wars Category:People from Greensboro, Alabama Category:19th-century American politicians Category:American lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law ",
