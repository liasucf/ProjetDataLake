    "text": "Projection of a on b (a1), and rejection of a from b (a2). When 90\u00b0 < \u03b8 \u2264 180\u00b0, a1 has an opposite direction with respect to b. The vector projection of a vector a on (or onto) a nonzero vector b, sometimes denoted \\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{b}} \\mathbf{a} (also known as the vector component or vector resolution of a in the direction of b), is the orthogonal projection of a onto a straight line parallel to b. It is a vector parallel to b, defined as: \\mathbf{a}_1 = a_1\\mathbf{\\hat b}\\, where a_1 is a scalar, called the scalar projection of a onto b, and b\u0302 is the unit vector in the direction of b. In turn, the scalar projection is defined as: a_1 = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\|\\cos\\theta = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat b} = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\frac{\\mathbf{b}}{\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|}\\, where the operator \u22c5 denotes a dot product, \u2016a\u2016 is the length of a, and \u03b8 is the angle between a and b. The scalar projection is equal to the length of the vector projection, with a minus sign if the direction of the projection is opposite to the direction of b. The vector component or vector resolute of a perpendicular to b, sometimes also called the vector rejection of a from b (denoted \\operatorname{oproj}_{\\mathbf{b}} \\mathbf{a}), is the orthogonal projection of a onto the plane (or, in general, hyperplane) orthogonal to b. Both the projection a1 and rejection a2 of a vector a are vectors, and their sum is equal to a, which implies that the rejection is given by: \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{a}_1. ==Notation== Typically, a vector projection is denoted in a bold font (e.g. a1), and the corresponding scalar projection with normal font (e.g. a1). In some cases, especially in handwriting, the vector projection is also denoted using a diacritic above or below the letter (e.g., \\vec{a}_1 or _a_ 1; see below for more details). The vector projection of a on b and the corresponding rejection are sometimes denoted by a\u2225b and a\u22a5b, respectively. ==Definitions based on angle \u03b8== ===Scalar projection=== The scalar projection of a on b is a scalar equal to a_1 = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\cos \\theta , where \u03b8 is the angle between a and b. A scalar projection can be used as a scale factor to compute the corresponding vector projection. ===Vector projection=== The vector projection of a on b is a vector whose magnitude is the scalar projection of a on b with the same direction as b. Namely, it is defined as : \\mathbf{a}_1 = a_1 \\mathbf{\\hat b} = (\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\cos \\theta) \\mathbf{\\hat b} where a_1 is the corresponding scalar projection, as defined above, and \\mathbf{\\hat b} is the unit vector with the same direction as b: : \\mathbf{\\hat b} = \\frac {\\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|}\\, ===Vector rejection=== By definition, the vector rejection of a on b is :\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{a}_1 Hence, :\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\mathbf{a} - (\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\cos \\theta) \\mathbf{\\hat b}. ==Definitions in terms of a and b== When \u03b8 is not known, the cosine of \u03b8 can be computed in terms of a and b, by the following property of the dot product a\u22c5b: \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\, \\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|} = \\cos \\theta. ===Scalar projection=== By the above-mentioned property of the dot product, the definition of the scalar projection becomes: a_1 = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\cos \\theta = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\, \\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|} = \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\| }. In two dimensions, this becomes a_1 = \\frac {\\mathbf{a}_x \\mathbf{b}_x + \\mathbf{a}_y \\mathbf{b}_y} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\| }. ===Vector projection=== Similarly, the definition of the vector projection of a onto b becomes: \\mathbf{a}_1 = a_1 \\mathbf{\\hat b} = \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\| } \\frac {\\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|}, which is equivalent to either : \\mathbf{a}_1 = \\left(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat b}\\right) \\mathbf{\\hat b}, or : \\mathbf{a}_1 = \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|^2}{\\mathbf{b}} = \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{\\mathbf{b}}. ===Scalar rejection=== In two dimensions, the scalar rejection is equivalent to the projection of a onto \\mathbf{b}^\\perp = (-\\mathbf{b}_y, \\mathbf{b}_x), which is \\mathbf{b} = (\\mathbf{b}_x, \\mathbf{b}_y) rotated 90\u00b0 to the left. Hence, a_2 = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\sin \\theta = \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}^\\perp} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\| } = \\frac {\\mathbf{a}_y \\mathbf{b}_x - \\mathbf{a}_x \\mathbf{b}_y} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\| }. Such a dot product is called the \"perp dot product.\" ===Vector rejection=== By definition, :\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{a}_1 Hence, :\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\mathbf{a} - \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{\\mathbf{b}}. ==Properties== If 0\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 90\u00b0, as in this case, the scalar projection of a on b coincides with the length of the vector projection. ===Scalar projection=== The scalar projection a on b is a scalar which has a negative sign if 90 degrees < \u03b8 \u2264 180 degrees. It coincides with the length \u2016c\u2016 of the vector projection if the angle is smaller than 90\u00b0. More exactly: * a1 = \u2016a1\u2016 if 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 90 degrees, * a1 = \u2212\u2016a1\u2016 if 90 degrees < \u03b8 \u2264 180 degrees. ===Vector projection=== The vector projection of a on b is a vector a1 which is either null or parallel to b. More exactly: * a1 = 0 if \u03b8 = 90\u00b0, * a1 and b have the same direction if 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 90 degrees, * a1 and b have opposite directions if 90 degrees < \u03b8 \u2264 180 degrees. ===Vector rejection=== The vector rejection of a on b is a vector a2 which is either null or orthogonal to b. More exactly: * a2 = 0 if \u03b8 = 0 or \u03b8 = 180 degrees, * a2 is orthogonal to b if 0 < \u03b8 < 180 degrees, ==Matrix representation== The orthogonal projection can be represented by a projection matrix. To project a vector onto the unit vector a = (ax, ay, az), it would need to be multiplied with this projection matrix: : P_a = a a^\\mathrm{T} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_x \\\\\\ a_y \\\\\\ a_z \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a_x & a_y & a_z \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_x^2 & a_x a_y & a_x a_z \\\\\\ a_x a_y & a_y^2 & a_y a_z \\\\\\ a_x a_z & a_y a_z & a_z^2 \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} ==Uses== The vector projection is an important operation in the Gram\u2013Schmidt orthonormalization of vector space bases. It is also used in the Separating axis theorem to detect whether two convex shapes intersect. ==Generalizations== Since the notions of vector length and angle between vectors can be generalized to any n-dimensional inner product space, this is also true for the notions of orthogonal projection of a vector, projection of a vector onto another, and rejection of a vector from another. In some cases, the inner product coincides with the dot product. Whenever they don't coincide, the inner product is used instead of the dot product in the formal definitions of projection and rejection. For a three- dimensional inner product space, the notions of projection of a vector onto another and rejection of a vector from another can be generalized to the notions of projection of a vector onto a plane, and rejection of a vector from a plane. M.J. Baker, 2012. Projection of a vector onto a plane. Published on www.euclideanspace.com. The projection of a vector on a plane is its orthogonal projection on that plane. The rejection of a vector from a plane is its orthogonal projection on a straight line which is orthogonal to that plane. Both are vectors. The first is parallel to the plane, the second is orthogonal. For a given vector and plane, the sum of projection and rejection is equal to the original vector. Similarly, for inner product spaces with more than three dimensions, the notions of projection onto a vector and rejection from a vector can be generalized to the notions of projection onto a hyperplane, and rejection from a hyperplane. In geometric algebra, they can be further generalized to the notions of projection and rejection of a general multivector onto/from any invertible k-blade. ==See also== *Scalar projection *Vector notation ==References== ==External links== * Projection of a vector onto a plane Category:Vectors (mathematics and physics) Category:Transformation (function) Category:Functions and mappings Category:Linear algebra ",
