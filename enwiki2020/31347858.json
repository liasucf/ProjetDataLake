He played that season with the 67's before joining the Manchester Monarchs in the American Hockey League to begin his professional career. ===Los Angeles Kings=== On March 16, 2013, Toffoli made his NHL debut in a 5\u20132 win over the San Jose Sharks. Toffoli scored his first career NHL goal on goaltender Mike Smith in his second NHL game in a 4\u20130 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes on March 18, 2013. On April 12, 2013, Toffoli was named the recipient of the AHL's Dudley \"Red\" Garrett Memorial Award for rookie of the year in the 2012\u201313 season.

The game-winning goal marked his fourth in 14 games since he was recalled from the Monarchs. Toffoli was a key contributor in the playoffs and went on to win a Stanley Cup. In the 2014\u201315 season, Toffoli played a majority of the season with Jeff Carter and Tanner Pearson with the line being dubbed \"That 70s Line\" since all three had numbers in the 70s. During the 2014\u201315 season, on January 9, 2015, Toffoli was diagnosed with mononucleosis, forcing him to miss six games before rejoining Los Angeles' line-up for the team's January 31 game against the Chicago Blackhawks.
