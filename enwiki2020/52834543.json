It started publication in 1960 under the title D\u014dsei (\u540c\u6027), and the title was changed to D\u014dk\u014d (\u540c\u597d) from the fourth issue. Under the editorship of Seiichi M\u014dri (\u6bdb\u5229\u6674\u4e00 M\u014dri Seiichi), who had been also involved with a conservative political organization, the magazine's circulation reached over 1,000 at its peak. The title of the magazine was changed to Seishin (\u6e05\u5fc3) around 1968. According to an article Junan no 16-nichikan (\u53d7\u96e3\u306e16\u65e5\u9593) by the editor, published in issue 30/31, the police raided his office and confiscated all the materials related to the magazine. He was imprisoned and interrogated for 16 days. The police concluded that the past issues of the magazine had contained obscenity and that it was possibly illegal that the magazine sold homoerotic photos to the subscribers. == References == Category:1960 establishments in Japan Category:Gay men's magazines published in Japan Category:Magazines established in 1960 Category:Mass media in Osaka ",
