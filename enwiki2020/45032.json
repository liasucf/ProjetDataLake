    "text": "Dordogne ( , or ;\"Dordogne\" (US) and ; ) is a department in Southwestern France, with its prefecture in P\u00e9rigueux. The department is located in the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine between the Loire Valley and the Pyrenees and is named after the river Dordogne that runs through it. It corresponds roughly with the ancient county of P\u00e9rigord. It had a population of 416,909 in 2013. ==History== The county of P\u00e9rigord dates back to when the area was inhabited by the Gauls. It was originally home to four tribes. The name for \"four tribes\" in the Gaulish language was \"Petrocore\". The area eventually became known as the county of Le P\u00e9rigord and its inhabitants became known as the P\u00e9rigordins (or P\u00e9rigourdins). There are four P\u00e9rigords in the Dordogne. * The \"P\u00e9rigord Vert\" (Green P\u00e9rigord), with its main town of Nontron, consists of verdant valleys in a region crossed by many rivers and streams;. * The \"P\u00e9rigord Blanc\" (White P\u00e9rigord), situated around the department's capital of P\u00e9rigueux, is a region of limestone plateaux, wide valleys, and meadows. * The \"P\u00e9rigord Pourpre\" (Purple P\u00e9rigord) with its capital of Bergerac, is a wine region. * The \"P\u00e9rigord Noir\" (Black P\u00e9rigord) surrounding the administrative center of Sarlat, overlooks the valleys of the V\u00e9z\u00e8re and the Dordogne, where the woods of oak and pine give it its name. left Dordogne River near Castelnaud-la-Chapelle The Petrocores took part in the resistance against Rome. Concentrated in a few major sites are the vestiges of the Gallo-Roman period-\u2013the gigantic ruined tower and arenas in P\u00e9rigueux (formerly Vesone), the P\u00e9rigord museum's archaeological collections, villa remains in Montcaret, and the Roman tower of La Rigale Castle in Villetoureix. The earliest cluzeaux (artificial caves either above or below ground) can be found throughout the Dordogne. These subterranean refuges and lookout huts were large enough to shelter entire local populations. According to Julius Caesar, the Gauls took refuge in these caves during the resistance. After Guienne province was transferred to the English Crown under the Plantagenets following the remarriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152, P\u00e9rigord passed by right to English suzerainty. Being situated at the boundaries of influence of the monarchies of France and England, it oscillated between the two dynasties for more than three hundred years of struggle until the end of the Hundred Years' War in 1453. The county had been torn apart and, as a consequence, that modeled its physiognomy. During the calmer periods of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the Castillon plain on the banks of the Dordogne saw a development in urban architecture. The finest Gothic and Renaissance residences were built in P\u00e9rigueux, Bergerac, and Sarlat. In the countryside, the nobility erected the majority of the more than 1200 chateaux, manors and country houses. In the second half of the 16th century, however, the terrors of war again visited the area, as the attacks, pillaging, and fires of the Wars of Religion reached a rare degree of violence in P\u00e9rigord. At the time, Bergerac was one of the most powerful Huguenot strongholds, along with La Rochelle. Following these wars, P\u00e9rigord, fief of Henry of Navarre, was to return to the Crown for good and would continue to suffer from the sudden political changes of the French nation, from the Revolution to the tragic hours of the Resistance. We also encounter the memory of the region's most important literary figures: Arnaut Daniel, Bertran de Born, Michel de Montaigne, \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie, Brant\u00f4me, Fenelon, Maine de Biran, Eugene Le Roy, and Andr\u00e9 Maurois; its great captains: Talleyrand, Saint-Exupery, Biron; and even entertainer and activist Josephine Baker. A number of ruins (La Chapelle-Faucher, I'Herm) have retained the memory of the tragedies that took place within their walls. Several of the castles and ch\u00e2teaux are open to visitors; some of them, such as Bourdeilles and Mareuil, house noteworthy collections. In addition to its castles, chateaux, churches, bastides, and cave fortresses, the P\u00e9rigord region has preserved since centuries past a number of villages that still have their market halls, dovecotes, bories (stone huts), churches, abbeys, and castles. Saint-L\u00e9on-sur-V\u00e9z\u00e8re, Connezac, Saint-Jean-de-C\u00f4le, La Roque-Gageac, and many others contain important and visually interesting architectural examples. The old quarters of P\u00e9rigueux or Bergerac have been restored and developed into pedestrian areas. A number of small towns, such as Brant\u00f4me, Issigeac, Eymet and Mareuil, have withstood the changes of modern times. A special mention should be made in this respect to Sarlat and its Black P\u00e9rigord area. Dordogne is one of the original 83 departments created on 4 March 1790 during the French Revolution. It was created from the former province of P\u00e9rigord, the county of P\u00e9rigord. Its borders continued to change over subsequent decades. :In 1793 the communes of Boisseuilh, Coubjours, G\u00e9nis, Payzac, Saint-Cyr-les-Champagnes, Saint-Mesmin, Salagnac, Savignac, Saint-Tri\u00e9 and Teillots were transferred from Corr\u00e8ze to Dordogne. :In 1794 Dordogne ceded Cavarc to Lot-et-Garonne. Later in 1794 (albeit during the subsequent year under the Republican Calendar in use at the time), Dordogne gained Parcoul from Charente-Inf\u00e9rieure. :Following the restoration, in 1819, the commune of Bonrepos was suppressed and merged with the adjacent commune of Souillac in Lot. In 1870, shortly after France fought against Prussia in a war that the enemy was winning, a young aristocrat called Alain de Mon\u00e9ys was savagely tortured and then burned by a crowd of between 300 and 800 people for two hours on 16 August in a public square in the village of Hautefaye in the north-west of the department. Details of the incident remain unclear: the leading participants appear to have been drunk, and before the introduction of mass education most of the witnesses would have been unable (and possibly unwilling) to write down what they saw. But at some stage the victim died, and following a trial four individuals identified as culpable were in turn condemned to die by guillotine. The sentence was carried out in the same public square on 13 February 1885. It was suggested that the victim had reported the (bad) news of the war in a way that implied support for the enemy, although subsequently it became clear that his patriotic credentials were beyond reproach. It was also suggested that the mob had been antagonized when he called out, \"Vive la R\u00e9publique!\" (Long live the republic) at a time when the patriotic villagers valued the imperial regime, which Parisian revolutionaries were in the process of destroying. The incident was widely reported at the time and has since been extensively researched. This summary relies on the work of Alain Corbin,Corbin Alain, Le village des \"cannibales\", Paris, Aubier, 1990, 204 p. a modern historian specializing in the 19th century who analysed the incident and the mass psychology behind it. ==Geography== The department is part of the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine and is surrounded by the six d\u00e9partements of Haute-Vienne, Corr\u00e8ze, Lot, Lot-et- Garonne, Gironde, and Charente. Dordogne is the third-largest department of metropolitan France. ==Politics== The President of the General Council is Germinal Peiro of the Socialist Party. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background:#e9e9e9; border-bottom:2px solid gray;\" !colspan=2| Party || seats |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |\u2022 |Socialist Party ||align=\"right\"| 34 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" | |Union for a Popular Movement ||align=\"right\"| 5 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |\u2022 |French Communist Party ||align=\"right\"| 4 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" | |Miscellaneous right ||align=\"right\"| 5 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |\u2022 |Union of Democrats and Independents ||align=\"right\"| 2 |} ===Current National Assembly Representatives=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Constituency!!Memberhttp://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/!!Party |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Dordogne's 1st constituency | Philippe Chassaing | La R\u00e9publique En Marche! |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Dordogne's 2nd constituency | Michel Delpon | La R\u00e9publique En Marche! |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Dordogne's 3rd constituency | Jean-Pierre Cubertafon | MoDem |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Dordogne's 4th constituency | Jacqueline Dubois | La R\u00e9publique En Marche! |} ==Demographics== The population peaked at 505,789 in 1851 according to that year's census. After 150 years of steady decline it fell below 400,000 by the year 2000. This reflected the long term population decline observed in many of the rural departments resulting from changes in agriculture and the lure of higher industrial wages available in more urbanized regions. However, during the first decade of the 21st century, the decline has been reversed. Dordogne has a thriving British immigrant community. The region counts between 5,000 and 10,000 British residents and 800 British entrepreneurs, drawn by a laid- back lifestyle, warm climate, and lower cost of living. The village of Eymet is at the heart of the trend, with 200 British families among 2,600 inhabitants. ==Tourism== File:Perigueux Cathedrale Saint Front.jpg|P\u00e9rigueux Image:Beynac chateau 1.jpg|Ch\u00e2teau de Beynac File:Lascaux, horse.JPG|Lascaux File:Canoe Dordogne.jpg|Canoeing on Dordogne River File:La Roque-Gageac Dordogne.jpg|La Roque-Gageac File:Cabanes du Breuil 1.jpg|Cabanes du Breuil There are more than 1,500 castles in Dordogne, making it \"The Other Chateau Country\" including: *Beynac *Biron *Bourdeilles *Castelnaud-la-Chapelle *Commarque *Hautefort *Jaurias *La Besse *La Mothe *La Petite Filolie *La Renaudie *La Roche *La Roque *Manoir de Mitonias *Milandes *Monbazillac *P\u00e9cany *Puymartin The famous caves of Lascaux have been closed to the public, but a replica of Lascaux II is open to visitors and is a major tourist attraction. P\u00e9rigueux has important Roman ruins, including an arena which is still visible inside a public park located near the town centre. Dordogne is particularly popular with Britons and other foreigners, as a location for second homes. ==See also== *Arrondissements of the Dordogne department *Cantons of the Dordogne department *Communes of the Dordogne department == References == ==External links== * Dordogne Tourist Highlights * Dordogne France Information * Pr\u00e9fecture website * Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral website * Atlaspol website.
