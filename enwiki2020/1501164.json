He was king of Macedon from 297 BC until 294 BC, jointly with his brother Alexander V. Eventually, he murdered his mother and ousted his brother from the throne. Alexander turned to Pyrrhus and Demetrius I Poliorcetes for help, and Demetrius I overthrew Antipater and then had Alexander murdered. Antipater was killed by Lysimachus, after he fled from Demetrius I to Thrace. His wife was Eurydice, his paternal cousin who was a daughter of Lysimachus. ==External links== *Justinus's account of the killing of Antipater II *Plutarch's account of the ousting of Antipater II Category:3rd-century BC Macedonian monarchs Category:Ancient Macedonian monarchs Category:3rd-century BC rulers Category:Murdered royalty of Macedonia (ancient kingdom) Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Matricides Category:3rd-century BC Greek people Category:3rd-century BC Macedonians Category:4th-century BC births Category:3rd-century BC deaths zh:\u5b89\u63d0\u5e15\u7279\u4e8c\u4e16 ",
