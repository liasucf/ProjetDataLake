    "text": "Ethyl bromoacetate is the chemical compound with the formula CH2BrCO2C2H5. It is the ethyl ester of bromoacetic acid and is prepared in two steps from acetic acid. It is a lachrymator and has a fruity, pungent odor. It is also a highly toxic alkylating agent and may be fatal if inhaled. ==Applications== Ethyl bromoacetate is listed by the World Health Organization as a riot control agent, and was first employed for that purpose by French police in 1912.Public health response to biological and chemical weapons, Chapter 3, Biological and Chemical agents, WHO Guidance] The French army used rifle grenades 'grenades lacrymog\u00e8nes'https://www.nouvelobs.com/culture/20050408.OBS3424/plaidoyer- pour-la-guerre-des-gaz.html filled with this gas against the Germans beginning in August 1914, but the weapons were largely ineffective, even though Ethyl bromoacetate is twice as toxic as chlorinehttps://www.nouvelobs.com/culture/20050408.OBS3424/plaidoyer-pour-la- guerre-des-gaz.html. In the early months of the war the British also used the weaponized use of tear gas agents and more toxic gasses including sulfur dioxidehttp://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-one/the-western-front- in-world-war-one/poison-gas-and-world-war-one/. The German army then used these attacks to justify their subsequent employment of it as odorant or warning agent in odorless, toxic gases and chemical weapons in 1915 under the German code Weisskreuz (White Cross). In organic synthesis, it is a versatile alkylating agent. Its major application involves the Reformatsky reaction, wherein it reacts with zinc to form a zinc enolate. The resulting BrZnCH2CO2Et condenses with carbonyl compounds to give a \u03b2-hydroxy-esters. It is also the starting point for the preparation of several other reagents. For example, the related Wittig reagent (prepared by reaction with triphenylphosphine) is commonly used to prepare alpha,beta-unsaturated esters from carbonyl compounds such as benzaldehyde:A student lab procedure for the Wittig sequence shown, only using the related methyl ester.
