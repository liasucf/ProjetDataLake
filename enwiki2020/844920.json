    "text": "Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is a website provided by NASA and Michigan Technological University (MTU). According to the website, \"Each day a different image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.\" The photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated. However, the pictures and descriptions often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration. The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and websites for more information. The images are either visible spectrum photographs, images taken at non-visible wavelengths and displayed in false color, video footage, animations, artist's conceptions, or micrographs that relate to space or cosmology. Past images are stored in the APOD Archive, with the first image appearing on June 16, 1995. This initiative has received support from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and MTU. The images are sometimes authored by people or organizations outside NASA, and therefore APOD images are often copyrighted, unlike many other NASA image galleries. When APOD began it received only 14 page views on its first day. As of 2012 it had received over a billion image views. APOD is also translated into 21 languages daily. APOD was presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in 1996. Its practice of using hypertext was analyzed in a paper in 2000. It received a Scientific American Sci/Tech Web Award in 2001. In 2002, the website was featured in an interview with Nemiroff on CNN Saturday Morning News. In 2003, the two authors published a book titled The Universe: 365 DaysThe Universe: 365 Days: Robert J. Nemiroff, Jerry T. Bonnell: Books from Harry N. Abrams, which is a collection of the best images from APOD as a hardcover \"coffee table\" style book. APOD was the Featured Collection in the November 2004 issue of D-Lib Magazine. During the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, APOD continued its service on mirror sites.APOD mirror accessdate October, 4th, 2013 Dr. Robert J. Nemiroff and Dr. Jerry T. Bonnell were awarded the 2015 Klumpke-Roberts Award by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific \"for outstanding contributions to public understanding and appreciation of astronomy\" for their work on APOD. == Pictures == File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|Welcome to Planet Earth (March 25, 2007; July 13, 2010) File:Opportunity's shadow sol 180 (PIA06739).jpg|Shadow of a Martian Robot (August 3, 2004; February 4, 2007; June 29, 2008; May 8, 2011; March 29, 2015; February 17, 2019) File:Mammatus clouds regina sk june 2012.JPG|Mammatus Clouds over Saskatchewan (October 23, 2012; October 18, 2015) File:Eagle nebula pillars.jpg|M16: Pillars of Star Creation (November 6, 1995; January 19, 1997; April 12, 1998; May 2, 1999; September 24, 2000; November 25, 2001; October 26, 2003; April 24, 2005; February 18, 2007; March 28, 2010; July 22, 2012; April 24, 2016) File:Mars Valles Marineris.jpeg|Valles Marineris: The Grand Canyon of Mars (July 16, 1995; July 20, 1995; June 27, 1997; August 27, 2002; August 24, 2003; July 30, 2006; March 27, 2011; May 11, 2014; May 29, 2016) File:Roll-cloud.JPG|A Roll Cloud over Uruguay (January 5, 2010; June 2, 2013; June 12, 2016) File:Cat's Eye Nebula.jpg|The Cat's Eye Nebula (June 28, 1995; July 4, 1996; August 2, 1997; November 1, 1998; October 31, 1999; March 24, 2002; November 12, 2006; December 27, 2009; August 26, 2012; July 3, 2016) File:Trifid Nebula.jpg|Infrared Trifid (January 13, 2005; July 7, 2007; July 25, 2015; December 31, 2016) File:Zeta Oph Runaway Star.jpg|Zeta Oph: Runaway Star (December 29, 2012; July 5, 2015; April 8, 2017) File:3C75 in Radio+Xray.jpg|Two Black Holes Dancing in 3C 75 (April 12, 2006; November 9, 2008; March 14, 2010; September 28, 2014; October 22, 2017) File:Fairy of Eagle Nebula.jpg|The Fairy of Eagle Nebula (April 25, 2005; December 9, 2007; August 21, 2011; September 29, 2013; December 2, 2018) File:Bumper8 launch- GPN-2000-000613.jpg|The First Rocket Launch from Cape Canaveral (October 22, 2001; June 4, 2006; October 1, 2008; July 19, 2015; October 1, 2018) File:Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg|The Origin of Elements, sourced from Wikimedia Commons (August 9, 2020;http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200809.html October 17, 2017;http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171024.html January 25, 2016http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160125.html) == References == == External links == * * APOD Archive * About APOD \u2013 includes a list of mirror websites * Astronomy Picture of the Day RSS Feed \u2013 Official RSS feed * Official list of alternative (mirror) sites for when the NASA APOD site is down * Observatorio \u2013 Spanish official translation, with web2.0 features * Starship Asterisk* \u2013 APOD and General Astronomy Discussion Forum * Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) \u2013 Official Facebook Page * Astronomy Picture of the Day App \u2013 Official iOS mirror * APOD email service * List of APOD Mirrors and Social Sites Category:NASA online Category:Astronomy education works Category:American science websites Category:Internet properties established in 1995 ",
