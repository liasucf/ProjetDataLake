The winner will decide if the story that will be told on the way to school that day will be one about a Shah Rukh Khan film or a Salman Khan film. The siblings are rivals in their love for the two stars. Pari is devoted to Shah Rukh and Chotu worships Salman Khan (down to wearing a replica of the star's trademark silver bracelet with a blue stone). Ten-year-old Pari holds her precocious eight-year-old brother's hand throughout the journey to school and back. She's not just his friend and sister but, since Chotu is visually impaired, she's also his guide. With just months to go before Chotu turns nine, Pari feels the pressure to fulfill her promise to her brother - that he will have his eyesight back before his ninth birthday. Hope floats when she spots a poster of Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) encouraging eye donations. She begins to write him letters addressed at Mannat in Mumbai, which go unanswered. Eventually, they realize that he is not in Mumbai, but in a village in Rajasthan for a film shoot portraying a Rajput Prince. Convinced that a meeting with SRK is all it would take to get Chotu his eyes back, the children set off alone on a 300 km journey traversing testing terrain. ==Cast== * Krrish Chhabria as Chotu * Hetal Gada as Pari * Vipin Sharma as Dungaram * Gulfam Khan as Gowri * Idhant Singh as Madan Mohan * Swastik Chavan as Bully * Narendra Singh Rajpurohit as Bathposh * Harmeet Arora as Aashajii * Rajiv Laxman as Gardu * Pratyaksh Kalra as Shamsher Singh * Rahul Lohani as Saffron Robed man * Vibha Chibber as Sheera Mata/Vibha * Ramakant Dayama as Old Man (Kidnapper) * Chet Dixon as Douglas Adams (special appearance in Damadam) * Flora Saini as Gypsy Woman * Bharati Achrekar as Dadisa * Suresh Menon as Badrinath * Ninad Kamat as Aatmaram Khandelwal * Vinny Arora as Asha * Priyank Sharma == Soundtrack == All songs were composed and produced by Tapas Relia.
