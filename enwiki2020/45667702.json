    "text": "FishCenter Live (also shortened to FishCenter or FC Live or just FCL) is an American talk show hosted by Dave Bonawits, Andrew Choe, Matt Harrigan, Christina Loranger, and Max Simonet. It premiered on the official website of Adult Swim in September 2014; it started airing on the network proper in February 2015. ==Summary and production== FishCenter Live is presented as a weekday call-in talk show narrating over footage of tropical fish swimming around in a fish tank. The fish are ranked according to their points, which are awarded when the fish complete a number of challenges. These challenges include \"Coins Quest,\" floating over coins that are superimposed on the video feed. The show is hosted by Dave Bonawits, Andrew Choe, Matt Harrigan, Christina Loranger (since 2019), and Max Simonet, employees from the digital department room of Adult Swim. An original incarnation of the show involved a straight video feed of the fish tank, without narration. Commentary and a phone number for call-in segments were later added. Initially, callers were mostly other Adult Swim employees; when the competition portion was added, the hosts saw an increase of outside callers. Starting in 2015, both David Bonawits and Max Simonet began hosting another show for the streams, a New York Times crossword solving show initially called Crossword. The series was re-titled Bloodfeast in 2016, and later received two television spin-offs: Tender Touches and G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu. Since March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show has been done remotely, with the hosts talking through Zoom. During this time, two hosts have left for extended hiatuses: Dave Bonawits left from late April to early June for parental leave, while Andrew Choe left in late July after feeling burnt out and has yet to return. The last new episode was streamed September 25, 2020 and the show was replaced with a new two-hour show called Adult Swim Today. == Games == The callers, fish, and guests compete for points in various games: *Coin Quest: fish swim into the coins superimposed over the tank to collect points. A live-version sponsored by Snickers was played at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con where the fish swim into the Snickers chocolate bars to \"eat\" them. Rednex's \"Cotton Eye Joe\" is frequently played. Games created for guests have included: *Alvuvuzelays Noise Game: the band Alvvays competed in a vuvuzela impersonation game. They also did a quiz on Canadian Thanksgiving. *Guess This Gourd: a game with Post Malone. *More-Bid-Angel: someone had to choose the highest-priced angel figurine. *Truth or Se-Dare-Is: Truth or dare? with author David Sedaris. The caller dared Sedaris to wear socks on his hands for the rest of the show. *What's Your Fetus?: made for death metal band Dying Fetus, someone had to guess what was hidden in a person's pelvic region based on a X-ray photograph. == Guests == ===Animal cast=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" !

It was shot at FishCenter Live with additional direction from Matt Shultz. == Homages == In the episode broadcast Thursday, 13 December 2018, a parody of the original Star Treks USS Enterprise was featured called the \"USS FishCenterprise NCC-1065.\" 1065 is a reference to the street number for Williams Street, which produces content for Adult Swim. ==Broadcast and reception== FishCenter Live was originally released in September 2014 on Adult Swim's official website. The show came about when staff decided to film the tropical fish swimming around their aquarium as an idea for developing content for the website's online streaming channels. New episodes are presented on weekdays. The show was added to the network proper in February 2015, broadcast at 4 a.m. These airings are condensed versions of the live version, consisting of 11-minute highlights from each day. In the first week of its televised broadcast, the show garnered 2.6 million viewers in total. In a press release, the network ranked the program first place across all targeted demographics in its time slot during the second week of March 2015. The network observed some of these viewers as confused Twitter users, wondering if the show was a prank. After these airings, live viewership rose from 120 to 5,000. The success led to the creation of a separate live stream dedicated to the network's Toonami block. In August 2017, a premiere of a Rick and Morty episode was delayed due to an episode of FishCenter Live on the same live stream. Critical reception has been positive. Adweeks Jason Lynch called FishCenter Live \"its flagship livestreaming show.\" The Comedy Bureau received the series favorably with \"you\u2019ll find, while giggling the whole way through, that you do get sort of invested in the individual fish.\" Deciders Kayla Cobb said \"[i]t's weird, but it works.\" Ranked sixth in their list of best \"unknown\" television series of 2015, Newsdays Verne Gay reviewed \"\u201cFC Live\u201d is insane \u2014 as such, a perfect distillation of all that is Adult Swim.\" The Outlines Samuel Argyle said \"FishCenter border[s] on the avant-garde. JamBases Andy Kahn called it \"wacky.\" The Guardians Mark Lawson critiqued \"Ambitiously, this is a phone-in show, although disappointingly, the fish don\u2019t take the calls, but swim in tanks that surround the presenters.\" The A.V. Clubs Erik Lindvall said FishCenter \"the latest weird thing\" to come from the network \"in a streak of really weird things\", describing it as a \"wonderful, web-based world of piscine sports\". Live for Live Musics Ming Lee Newcomb described FishCenter Live as \"eccentric\" and \"bizarre.\" Ranked fourth in their list of \"[t]he 26 Weirdest Adult Swim Shows Ever,\" Deadspins Sheldon Pearce commented \"Adult Swim employees came up with this one, which means it\u2019s definitely on-brand if nothing else.\" In reviewing Tender Touches, Geeks Jose Rodriguez said the pilot had \"more in common with Xavier: Renegade Angel or FishCenter.\" Reviewing their Alvvays performance, Uproxxs Derrick Rossignol declared \"every band should be on it, because at the very least, it\u2019s one of the most bizarre live internet shows you can possibly watch.\" Later, while reviewing the Post Malone episode, Rossignol followed-up with \"a totally bizarre, daytime, aquatic, call-in web show that doesn\u2019t make much sense, and that\u2019s what makes it great.\" In an interview with host Max Simonet, Sonoma Index-Tribunes David Templeton remarked \"[it's] a bizarrely simple cult-hit web-and-television show.\" == Controversy == In 2016, two Dragon Con cosplayers, claiming an association with Adult Swim and Cartoon Network and wore \"Make FishCenter Great Again\" hats, dressed as the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks. Images of the cosplay were widely shared on social media sites as Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. Bleeding Cools Rich Johnston speculated they were cosplaying as the game Rampage, while Facebook commenters drew a connection with the anime Terror in Resonance. ==Australian Adaption== Australian channel 9Go! promoted their Australian adaption of FishCenter (known as FishCentre) airing at 12:00 on the channel, along with the Adult Swim block they have on the channel. Unlike the American version of FishCenter, FishCentre was not live and consisted of scripted shorts no longer than 2 minutes in length, with voices super-imposed onto the fish. It ran for 12 episodes. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * * Category:2014 American television series debuts Category:2010s American late-night television series Category:Adult Swim original programming Category:2010s American television talk shows Category:Television series about fish Category:Television series by Williams Street Category:American television shows featuring puppetry ",
