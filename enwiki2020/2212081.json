    "text": "Inspissation is the process of thickening by dehydration. ==Intentional use== Inspissation is the process used when heating high-protein containing media; for example to enable recovery of bacteria for testing. Once inspissation has occurred, any stained bacteria, such as Mycobacteria, can then be isolated. A Serum inspissation or Fractional sterilization is a process of heating an article on 3 successive days as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Day !! Temperature !! Time !! Purpose |- | 1 || 85 \u00b0C || 60 minutes || Drying of the medium and killing the organisms in their vegetative form |- | Time in between || || overnight incubation || Growth of vegetative forms from spores |- | 2 || 75 to 80 \u00b0C || 20 minutes || killing the organisms in their vegetative form |- | Time in between || || overnight incubation || Growth of vegetative forms from any spores remaining |- | 3 || 75 to 85 \u00b0C || 20 minutes || killing the organisms in their vegetative form as well as the leftover spores |} ==Pathologic inspissation== In cystic fibrosis, inspissation of secretions in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts is a major mechanism of causing the disease. ==References== ==Further reading== *Textbook of Microbiology by Prof. C P Baveja, *Textbook of Microbiology by Ananthanarayan and Panikar, Category:Microbiology Category:Zoology ",
