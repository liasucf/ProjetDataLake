Those families thrived and branched-out through emigration to other States - notably to: Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, California, and other Wisconsin counties. In 2007, a 500-page book was published (privately) by the \"St. Mary's Ridge Heritage Project,\" Cashton, Wisconsin, entitled: \"St. Mary's Ridge Heritage - Histories of Our Pioneers.\" A second, revised edition is planned (circa 2009). Photos of St. Mary's were once selected for use within an official White House pamphlet, as \"one of America's most beautiful places,\" by former First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson wife of former United States President Lyndon B. Johnson.The History of St. Mary's Ridge ==References== *'St. Marys Ridge', St. Mary's Heritage Project, Cashton, Wisconsin, 2007. ==External links== *St. Mary's Ridge Wisconsin *St. Mary's Ridge Parish *St. Mary's Ridge Catholic Cemetery *Saint Mary's Ridge Genealogy (Monroe Co., WI.
