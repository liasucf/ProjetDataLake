    "text": "Obua Ajukwu was the first War Minister of Oguta, known as Ndanike (the ancestor of the Umundanike people), who owned many slaves and travelled all Igboland with them. His father, Ajukwu, led the people of Idu and Oba from the Benin Empire through Sapele and Ekumeku to Ugwunta during their exodus in 1620, to settle between the people of Awo and Ohaji. The Black Death of the 1600s, brought about by the invasion of the Benin Empire by the Portuguese and Italians, who came from Ethiopia led to the movement of the Bini people, migrating down-west. Obua Ajukwu would grow up, to be the Master of the man who would soon be known as Jaja of Opobo. == References == Category:People from Benin City Category:16th-century Nigerian people ",
