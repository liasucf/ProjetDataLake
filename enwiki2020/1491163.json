Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. She was a prominent figure in the New York City and Newport, Rhode Island, social sets, and was friends with Mrs Reginald Vanderbilt. When her father died in 1911, he left an estate, for the benefit of her, her children, and her sister, of nearly $15,000,000. In his will, he stipulated that no part of his estate was to go to his \"erstwhile son-in-law, James Boothby Burke Roche.\" ==Personal life== On September 22, 1880, at Christ Church, New York City, she married the Hon.

Bayard, former United States Secretary of State.The Times (London) Friday, 27 March 1896, p. 7 col. F. In 1899, her ex-husband, then a Member of Parliament, sued her with a Writ of Habeas Corpus to produce their daughter in court, stating that she was depriving \"the child of her liberty.\" The case was settled out of court shortly thereafter. On August 4, 1905, she married Aurel de Batonyi, a Hungarian-born riding instructor and society horseman. When he immigrated to the United States on the White Star liner Majestic in 1891, Batonyi had claimed he was a count.United States Government. 1891 New York Ship's Arrivals Records Index. Washington, D.C.: National Archives. Series M237, Roll #571, July 8, 1891. It was also suggested that his real name was Arthur Cohn.Oakland Tribune, September 8, 1907, pp. 17\u201318. She sued Batonyi for divorce two years after their marriage, allegedly because her father threatened to disinherit her if she continued to live with her husband. She died in the city of her birth, at her residence at 1020 Fifth Avenue, at the age of 89 on January 26, 1947. Her great-great-grandchildren include the British princes William and Harry, and the American actor Oliver Platt. ==References== Category:1857 births Category:1947 deaths Category:American socialites Category:People from New York City Category:People included in New York Society's Four Hundred ",
