    "text": "The Trungpa tulku are a line of incarnate Tibetan lamas who traditionally head Surmang monastery complex in Kham, now Surmang. There have been twelve such Trungpa tulkus. They are members of the Karma Kagyu tradition as well as the Nyingma tradition. ==Line of the Trungpa tulkus== # K\u00fcnga Gyaltsen (15th century), student of Trungmase # K\u00fcnga Sangpo (born 1464) # K\u00fcnga \u00d6ser (15th and 16th centuries) # K\u00fcnga Namgyal (1567\u20131629) # Tenpa Namgyal (1633\u20131712) # Tendzin Ch\u00f6kyi Gyatso (1715\u20131761) # Jampal Ch\u00f6kyi Gyatso (1763\u20131768) # Gyurme Thenphel (born 1771) # Tenpa Rabgye (19th century) # Ch\u00f6kyi Nyinche (1879\u20131939) # Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa (Ch\u00f6kyi Gyamtso, 1940\u20131987) was one of the most influential teachers of Buddhism in the west. He is the founder of Shambhala Buddhism. # Ch\u00f6kyi Sengay (Sengye/Senge, Choseng Trungpa, born February 6, 1989). Chokyi Sengay is the present Trungpa t\u00fclku. == Ch\u00f6kyi Nyinche == According to Fabrice Midal, the tenth Trungpa tulku rejected his role as fundraiser for the Surmang monasteries and preferred to live as a disciplined meditation practitioner. At one point, to escape his duties as the figurehead of the monastery complex, he ran away on foot to study with Jamgon Kongtrul. He studied with Kongtrul Rinpoche for many years before returning to Surmang, and at that point had the reputation of a realized teacher. Dilgo Khyentse and the second Jamgon Kongtrul of Sechen studied with him. They later became the direct teachers of the eleventh Trungpa tulku.Midal (2004) p. 40 == Zurmang Lineage == The Zurmang Kagyu lineage in Sikkim shares a common origin, but uses a different transliteration of the Tibetan \u0f0b\u0f5f\u0f74\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f44 . They claim Trungmase as the 1st Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche lineage holder.. == References == * Midal, Fabrice (2004) Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa: His Life and Vision Category:Lamas Category:Tulkus Category:Religious leadership roles Category:Tibetan Buddhism ",
