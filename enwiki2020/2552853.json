    "text": "Biagio Rossetti ( 1447 \u2013 1516) was an Italian architect and urbanist from Ferrara. A military engineer since 1483, and the ducal architect of Ercole I d'Este, in 1492 Rossetti was assigned the project of enlarging the city of Ferrara. Rossetti is considered the first architect in the history of urbanistics to make use of the advantages of the modern methods: balancing the humanistic principles in architecture, the real needs of the city, and local traditions. Beginning in 1492, he projected and directed construction of the defense walls around the city. After Ercole's death in 1505, Rossetti served the Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, in which role he was responsible for the creation of many notable palazzi and churches. Among the latter, he helped design Santa Maria in Vado. ==Sources== * * Category:1440s births Category:1516 deaths Category:People from Ferrara Category:15th-century Italian architects Category:16th-century Italian architects Category:Architects from Emilia-Romagna Category:Italian Renaissance architects Category:Italian urban planners ",
