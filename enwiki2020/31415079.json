On the night of March 24\u201325, 1945 allegedly on the direction of the \"Killer Countess\", Margaret of Batthyany daughter of Baron Heinrich Thyssen, Podezin engaged in the massacre of at least 180 Hungarian Jewish slave laborers in Rechnitz who were assigned to dig anti-tank ditches in anticipation of the approaching Red Army. The slave laborers were machine gunned to death allegedly as part of a perverse celebration of Nazi functionaries at Batthyany's Schloss Rechnitz. There has been controversy over the version of events as reported by British journalist David Litchfield. The fact that the killings occurred and Podezin took part is not disputed. The dispute stems from whether the killings were done to amuse the guests at the party and if party guests took part in the murders.The Independent:The killer countess: The dark past of Baron Heinrich Thyssen's daughter Der Spiegel Mass Murder as Party Entertainment? 10/22/2007 ==References== ==External links== *Simon Wiesenthal Center:Operation Last Chance * *Das Magazin:The Terrible Secret The Batthyany Conspiracy: All Innocent On The Eastern Front Article by Sacha Batthyany in \u2018Das Magazin\u2019, Switzerland, 11.12.2009.
