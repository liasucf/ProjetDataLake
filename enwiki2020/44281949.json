The ISA World Junior Surfing Championship is an annual event that started in 2003 in Durban, South Africa. The International Surfing Association decided to hold a separate event for the growing level and population of junior surfing. The decision proved to be right. Nowadays the desire of every junior surfer is to represent their country in this great contest. The ISA started holding the Junior division in the ISA World Championship in 1980, and legendary surfer Tom Curren became the first ISA Junior Champion.http://surf.transworld.net/1000130547/news/10-things-about- the-isa-world-jrs/ === 2014 isa world junior surfing championship, salinas, Ecuador === held between April 5\u201313 === 2013 ISA World Junior Surfing Championship, Playa Jiquiliste, Nicaragua === === 2012 ISA World Junior Surfing Championship, Playa Venao, Panama === === 2011 ISA World Junior Surfing Championship, Playa Hermosa, Peru === === 2010 ISA World Junior Surfing Championship, Piha Beach, New Zealand === === 2009 ISA World Junior Surfing Championships, Ecuador === === 2008 ISA World Junior Surfing Championships, France === === 2007 ISA World Junior Surfing Championships, Costa de Caparica, Portugal === === 2006 ISA World Junior Surfing Championships, Maresias, Brazil === === 2005 ISA World Junior Surfing Championships, Huntington Beach, USA === === 2004 ISA World Junior Surfing Championships, Papenoo, Tahiti === === 2003 ISA World Junior Championship, Durban, South Africa === == World Masters Surfing Championship == === 2013 ISA World Masters Surfing Championship, Monta\u00f1ita, Ecuador === === 2012 ISA World Masters Surfing Championship, Colorado Beach, Nicaragua === === 2011 ISA World Masters Surfing Championship, Punta Roca, El Salvador === === 2010 ISA World Masters Surfing Championship, Santa Catalina, Panama === === 2008 ISA World Masters Surfing Championship, Peru === === 2007 ISA World Masters Surfing Championships, Rincon, Puerto Rico === == World Tandem Championships== === 2011 ITSA/ISA World Tandem Championships, Trestles Church,San Diego, USA === === 2010 ISA World Tandem Championships, Lacanau, France === === 2009 ITSA/ISA Tandem Masters World Championships, Trestles (Church break), San Diego, California USA === === 2008 ITSA/ISA Tandem Masters World Championships === === 2006 ITSA/ISA World Tandem Surfing Championship, Waikiki, Oahu, Hawaii === == World Bodyboard Championship == === 2014 ISA World Bodyboard Championship, Iquique, Chile === to be held between December 6 \u2013 14 === 2013 ISA World Bodyboard Championship, Playa Parguito, Venezuela === === 2011 ISA World Bodyboard Championship, Canary Islands, Spain === == World StandUp Paddle and Paddleboard Championship == === 2014 ISA World StandUp Paddle and Paddleboard Championship, La Boquita & Granada, Nicar\u00e1gua === held between May 3\u201311 === 2013 ISA World StandUp Paddle and Paddleboard Championship, Miraflores, Lima, Peru === === 2012 ISA World StandUp Paddle and Paddleboard Championship, Miraflores, Lima, Peru === == World Kneeboard World Championship == === 2013 ISA World Kneeboard World Championship, Teharu\u2019u, Tahiti === === 2007 ISA Kneeboard Surfing World Titles, Santa Cruz, CA, USA === == World Longboard Championship == === 2013 ISA World Longboard Championship, Huanchaco, Peru === == Hainan Wanning Riyue Bay International Surfing Festival == The Hainan Wanning Riyue Bay International Surfing Festival (HWRBISF) is a new ISA event started in 2012 that expands the frontier of surfing to the Chinese coast.
