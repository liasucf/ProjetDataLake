Themisto gaudichaudii has been found to feed opportunistically on copepods and chaetognaths, as juveniles also on diatoms. Themisto are important prey in many food webs. For example, Themisto gaudichaudii reaches high densities (up to 61 individuals/m3) in Kerguelen waters and is a major food item for blue petrels, thin-billed prions, Antarctic prions, common diving petrels, and southern rockhopper penguins. In the Barents Sea, Themisto libellula is very abundant in the Arctic waters and important food item for cod, polar cod, and marine mammals near the ice edge, whereas Themisto abyssorum is important in Atlantic/boreal waters. ==Life history== Themisto gaudichaudii matures at lengths between or more. Reproduction can be nearly continuous but becomes more seasonal at higher latitudes. The offspring emerging from the marsupium are in length. Themisto abyssorum has a life span of 1\u20132 years and reaches a maximum length of . Themisto libellula lives 2\u20133 years and grows to a maximum length of . ==Species== There are seven recognized species: * Themisto abyssorum (Boeck, 1870) * Themisto australis (Stebbing, 1888) * Themisto compressa Go\u00ebs, 1865 * Themisto gaudichaudii Gu\u00e9rin, 1825 * Themisto japonica (Bovallius, 1887) * Themisto libellula (Lichtenstein in Mandt, 1822) * Themisto pacifica (Stebbing, 1888) ==References== Category:Hyperiidea Category:Crustacean genera Category:Taxa named by F\u00e9lix \u00c9douard Gu\u00e9rin-M\u00e9neville ",
