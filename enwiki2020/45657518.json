She moved to Germany in 1974, where she has lived ever since. Early 2007, she and Mina Ahadi were amongst the founders of the Central Council of Ex-Muslims, a German association that aims to represent people who have renounced Islam. Toker opines that Islam is inhumane, contrary to the German Constitution and both misogynous and misandrous: according to her, women in Islam are being \"degraded to breeding machines\". She warns that in many Dutch cities there are women's and day care centres in the hands of Islamists. By allowing this Islamic pillarisation, the Netherlands are too tolerant in Toker's view. For her, Islam stands for oppression, and one should be allowed to say that, naming Ayaan Hirsi Ali as their example. == Recent works == * Kein Schritt zur\u00fcck ('No step back'), Alibri, Aschaffenburg, 2014, 157 p. == References == == External links == * Website of Arzu Toker Category:Turkish writers Category:Turkish journalists Category:Turkish atheists Category:German atheists Category:German journalists Category:German women writers Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Former Muslim critics of Islam Category:Turkish former Muslims Category:German former Muslims Category:Opposition to Islam in Germany Category:Turkish emigrants to Germany Category:Former Muslims turned agnostics or atheists ",
