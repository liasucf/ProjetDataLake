    "text": "Hymenobacter glaciei is a species of bacteria first isolated from Victoria Upper Glacier, Antarctica on basal ice. It is a psychrotolerant, heterotrophic aerobe. It is notable for the prevalence of horizontal gene transfers in its evolution, possibly due to dormancy because of its habitat. ==References== ==Further reading== *Reddy, Gundlapally SN, and Ferran Garcia-Pichel. \"Description of Hymenobacter arizonensis sp. nov. from the southwestern arid lands of the United States of America.\" Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 103.2 (2013): 321-330. *Jin, Long, et al. \"Hymenobacter ruber sp. nov., isolated from grass soil.\"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 64.Pt 3 (2014): 979-983. *Kang, Ji Young, et al. \"Hymenobacter koreensis sp. nov. and Hymenobacter saemangeumensis sp. nov., isolated from estuarine water.\" International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 63.Pt 12 (2013): 4568-4573. *Srinivasan, Sathiyaraj, et al. \"Hymenobacter humi sp. nov., a bacterium isolated from soil.\" Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2015): 1-9. ==External links== * * *LPSN Category:Flavobacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2011 ",
