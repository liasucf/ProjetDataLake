    "text": "Samuel Klein (15 November 192320 November 2014) was a Polish-Brazilian business magnate and philanthropist who founded the Casas Bahia chain of department stores in Brazil, building them into the top retailer in the country. This along with his tendency to use massive warehouses for his goods, including the largest single warehouse in South America, led him to be known in the 1990s as the \"Sam Walton of Brazil\".From the International Directory of Company Histories, Volume 75 by Robert Halasz (2004) Through Casas Bahia, Klein's family became one of the wealthiest families in Brazil. In 2013, Forbes ranked him 78th richest person in Brazil with a personal net worth of $835 million, while his son, Michael, was ranked 87th with $723 million.Antunes, Anderson (9 September 2013). \"The Richest People In Brazil 2013: The Full List\", Forbes.com; retrieved 9 September 2013. ==Life and work== ===Early life=== Klein was born in Zaklik\u00f3w, Poland, the third of nine children. At 19, Klein worked as a joiner at the time of the Nazi German invasion of Poland in World War II, when he was taken to the Maidanek concentration camp along with his father. His mother and five younger siblings were sent to the extermination camp of Treblinka.Miriam Jordan (11 June 2002). \"Down Market: A Retailer in Brazil Has Become Rich By Courting Poor --- Payments of $14 a Month Add Up for Samuel Klein, Sao Paulo's Sam Walton\", Wall Street Journal (Eastern edition; pg. A1). He was later transported to Auschwitz in 1944. He escaped from the soldiers on 22 July 1944; in his own words, \"I didn't know where I was going, but I was certain to get far from the group.\" He spent the night in the fields, where some Christian Poles, also fugitives, helped him flee. He managed to return to his old house, which was ruined, and worked on a small farm in the area in exchange for food. \"Samuel Klein\" (in Portuguese). Casas Bahia. Retrieved 20 January 2015. After the war, he met his sister Sezia (Esther) and brother Solomon (who lives today in New York City). The Klein brothers then went to Germany, and were able to find their father alive. Klein lived in Munich, West Germany, until 1951, where he met Chana, his future wife. Some of Klein's family live in the Boston metropolitan area including his great-nephew, Victor Asher Greenstein, who graduated with an MBA from Dartmouth College, Tuck School of Business and is currently a prominent accountant with KPMG, LLP. ===Brazil and Casas Bahia=== Klein's father went to Brazil, together with his sister Esther. He himself wanted to emigrate to the United States, but the immigration quota was full. So he joined his father and sister, making his way to Brazil via Bolivia, and settled with his family in S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul in greater S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1952, he began working as a peddler, selling sheets, tablecloths, and towels door to door using a buggy.Margolis, Mac. \"Profit and the Poor\", Newsweek, 19 July 2004, p. 42. After five years, in 1957, he had accumulated sufficient capital to open his first shop in downtown S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul, which he called \"Casa Bahia\". The name was an homage to his patrons, the majority of whom were migrant workers from the northeast state of Bahia. Today, there are more than 500 of these stores with over 23 million customers,Michael Kepp. \"Greased lightning: Casas Bahia aims low and sells fast to grow in Brazil's challenging retail space.\" Revista Latin Trade, 1 July 2006; retrieved via accessmylibrary.com 29 October 2009. making Casas Bahia the largest warehouse distributor in Latin America.

Casas Bahia: Retail for the poor (via Google Books) in The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits, Wharton School Publishing (2009), pp. 207-18; Klein guarded the company's finances, keeping control of all expenses within his immediate family, although in 1997 he opened the company's books to the public to secure promissory notes for the year. He later passed control of Casas Bahia to his son Michael, who was its CEO as of 2009, and retired in Brazil. In 2009, Samuel Klein sold Casas Bahia to Grupo P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar. Via Varejo was soon formed through the mergers of Casas Bahia with Ponto Frio and Extra Eletro, both owned by Grupo P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar. The Klein family owned a 47% stake in Via Varejo, which is worth $2 billion today.Coffey, Brendan & Cuadros, Alexander, \"Hidden Billionaires in Plain Sight Emerge As Stocks Rise\", Bloomberg.com, 15 March 2012; retrieved 26 June 2013.

The systematic murder of 6 million Jews in Europe by Germans, also part of his personal history and experience, weighed heavily on his mind, and led him to be at the forefront of the establishment and strengthening of many Jewish organizations in S\u00e3o Paulo where he lived. He was the largest annual donor to Chabad/Lubavitch's boys' school and Lubavitch Yeshiva (estimated at ~$500,000 per year) in the Bom Retiro neighborhood. In 2007 he purchased the large property for the two schools, which had been previously paying rent. He is also a major donor to the Renaissance School (Col\u00e9gio Renascen\u00e7a) in Bom Retiro. In recent years he gave in excess of $20 million to a wider range of those in need both in S\u00e3o Paulo and abroad. This included assisting young people in S\u00e3o Paulo with grants to set up small businesses. ==References== ==Further reading== * Elias Awad. (2005, 2nd ed).
