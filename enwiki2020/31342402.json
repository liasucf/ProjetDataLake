This small village is located 3 km west of Xert, close to the N-232 road. Until the mid 20th century there were inns for people travelling between Vinar\u00f2s and Morella or beyond. These inns provided food and rooms for travellers as well as stabling and fodder for the horses pulling the coaches. Presently there is a small church and a few houses providing board and lodging for agritourists and hikers. Tourists come mainly for the beautiful and unspoilt mountain surroundings of this largely uninhabited area.
