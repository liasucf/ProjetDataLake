    "text": "Carol San Soucie Woodward is an American computational mathematician who works in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. She was elected as a fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in 2017, \"for the development and application of numerical algorithms and software for large-scale simulations of complex physical phenomena\". Carol Ann San Soucie did her undergraduate studies at Louisiana State University (LSU), earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Her undergraduate honors thesis at LSU was supervised by Guillermo Ferreyra. She did her graduate studies at Rice University, with Clint Dawson and Mary Wheeler as her doctoral advisor. When Wheeler moved from Rice to the University of Texas at Austin in 1995, San Soucie moved with her, but she earned her doctorate from Rice in 1996, with a dissertation on Mixed Finite Element Methods for Variably Saturated Flow. She joined LLNL in the same year. At LLNL, she is in charge of the SUNDIALS project, a package of time integration and nonlinear equation solving software for use in simulations. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Louisiana State University alumni Category:Rice University alumni Category:Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory staff Category:Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
