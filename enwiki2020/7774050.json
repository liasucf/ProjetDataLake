Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World, Leiden:Brill. Various estimates suggest that there were about 1,000 Jews to 2,500 living in Karachi at the beginning of the twentieth century, mostly Bene Israel Jews from Maharashtra, India.Weil, Shalva. 'The Jews of Pakistan', in M.Avrum Erlich (ed.) Encyclopaedia of the Jewish Diaspora, Santa Barbara, USA: ABC CLIO. 2008, (3: 1228-1230). A substantial community lived in Rawalpindi. A smaller community of Jews also lived in Peshawar. The Bene Israel Jews from Maharashtra were concentrated in KarachiWeil, Shalva. \"Jews of India\" in Raphael Patai and Haya Bar Itzhak (eds.) Jewish Folklore and Traditions: A Multicultural Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, Inc. 2013, (1: 255-258). Today, the majority of Bene Israel Jews live in Israel, India, Canada and the United States, while modern-day Pakistan continues to host a modest Jewish population. According to the National Database and Registration Authority, there are 745 registered Jewish families in Pakistan. ==History== ===First migrations=== A community of Jews fleeing a revolt in Mashhad, Persia, settled in Rawalpindi in the Punjab in 1839. The elaborate early 20th century synagogue they built still stands on Nishtar Street in Rawalpindi's Babu Mohallah neighborhood, between the Bohra Mosque and a large and elaborate Victorian era church.

Hunter, The Imperial Gazetteer of India, vol XII, Trubner and Co, London, 2nd edition, 1887. Online at: http://www.panhwar.net/rarebooks/The%20Imperial%20Gazetteer%20of%20India%20Vol%20XII%201887.pdf In the Sindh Gazetteer of 1907, Edward Hamilton Aitken mentions that according to the 1901 census, the total population of Jews [in Sindh] was 482 and almost all of them lived in Karachi. By 1919, this figure had risen to about 650.Joan G.

Most of these Jews were Bene Israel and they lived as tradesmen, artisans, poets, philosophers and civil servants.Weil, Shalva. 2009 'The Heritage and Legacy of Indian Jews' in Shalva Weil (ed.) India\u2019s Jewish Heritage: Ritual, Art and Life-Cycle, Mumbai: Marg Publications [first published in 2002; 3rd edn.], pp. 8-21. Weil, Shalva. 2011 'Bene Israel', in Adele Berlin (Ed. in Chief) Oxford Dictionary of Jewish Religion, 2nd edition, New York: Oxford University Press, 131. Weil, Shalva. 2011 'Bene Israel' (616), in Judith Baskin (ed.) Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture, New York: Cambridge University Press. In 1911, Jews constituted 0.3 percent of Karachi's population and at the time of independence from the British Empire their number had reached 2,500. In her 1947 book \u2018Malika-e- Mashriq\u2019 (Queen of the East), Mehmooda Rizwiya has written about the Jewish presence in Karachi. Jews used to live in Karachi.Weil, Shalva. 2011 \"The History and Disappearance of the Jewish Presence in Pakistan\", International Relations and Security Network (ISN). http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current- Affairs/ISN- Insights/Detail?lng=en&id;=130985&contextid734;=130985&contextid735;=130984&tabid;=130984&dynrel;=4888caa0-b3db-1461-98b9-e20e7b9c13d4,0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233 In a paper titled \"Karachi Ke Yahudi\u201d (Karachi's Jews), Gul Hasan Kalmatti indicates that Jews arrived in Karachi from Maharashtra in the 19th century. A variety of associations existed to serve the Jewish community in Pakistan, including: *Magain Shalome Synagogue: Built in 1893 near Ranchore Line,Israel Goldstein, My World As a Jew: The Memoirs of Israel Goldstein, Herzl Press, New York, USA, vol 2, Pg 21 Limited preview: https://books.google.com/books?id=mCU0XsXUDOYC&pg;=PA21&lpg;=PA21&ots;=Rf8WikzBrB&dq;=jews+karachi&output;=html&sig;=5giViHwkF4nloob2TatlYnh0k6k by Solomon David Umerdekar and his son Gershone Solomon. Other accounts suggest that it was built by Shalom Solomon, a surveyor for the Karachi Municipal Committee and his wife Shegula-bai. The synagogue soon became the center of a small but vibrant Jewish community. A member of this Synagogue, Abraham Reuben Kamarlekar, became a councilor in the Karachi City Corporation in 1936. * Young Man's Jewish Association: Founded in 1903 and whose aim was to encourage sports as well as religious and social activities of the Bene Israel in Karachi. * Karachi Bene Israel Relief Fund: Established to support poor Jews in Karachi. * Karachi Jewish Syndicate: Formed in 1918 and whose aim was to provide homes to poor Jews at reasonable rent fees. ===Post- independence=== Pakistani Jews after making aliyah from Pakistan ====1947-1970==== Leading up to the time of the Partition of India, some 1300 Jews remained in Karachi, most of them Bene Israel Jews observing Sephardic Jewish rites.Weil, Shalva. 2009 'Bene Israel Rites and Routines' in Shalva Weil (ed.) India\u2019s Jewish Heritage: Ritual, Art and Life-Cycle, Mumbai: Marg Publications [first published in 2002; 3Arts, 54(2): 26-37.rd edn.], 78-89. Reprinted in Marg: A Magazine of The The first real exodus of Jewish refugees from British India to Bombay and other cities in India came just prior to the creation of Israel in 1948 when antisemitism spread to Pakistan.Weil, Shalva. 'The Jews of Pakistan', in M.Avrum Erlich (ed.) Encyclopaedia of the Jewish Diaspora, Santa Barbara, USA: ABC CLIO.2008, (3: 1228-1230). When Israel came into being in 1948, many Jews migrated to Israel, and after the Arab-Israel war a majority of them left Karachi. By 1953, fewer than 500 Jews were reported to be in all of Pakistan. ====1971\u2013present==== Magen Shalom, the Bene Israel's only synagogue in Karachi founded under the British Raj, was demolished in 1988 to make way for a shopping plaza by order of General Zia- ul-Haq shortly after the Bene Israel community in Israel petitioned for its maintenance and use as a historical or other community center.Weil, Shalva. 2011 \"The History and Disappearance of the Jewish Presence in Pakistan\", ETH Z\u00fcrich. https://css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital- library/articles/article.html/130984/pdf As per another account, in July 1988 the synagogue was burnt and brought down by religious zealots (where today a building 'Madiha Square' stands). The last custodian of the synagogue was Rachel Joseph, now deceased. Dan Kiesel, a Jew of German origin, was employed as a physiotherapist by the Pakistan Cricket Board from 1995\u20131999. His appointment brought some controversy, as Pakistani politicians questioned the hiring an Israeli Jew in the Senate of Pakistan.Weil, Shalva. 2011 \"The History and Disappearance of the Jewish Presence in Pakistan\", ETH Z\u00fcrich. https://css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital- library/articles/article.html/130984/pdf The term \"Yehudi\" and its variants remains a word of derision when directed at a Bene Israel or anyone else as noted by Reverend John Wilson, one of the founders of University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai). In Urdu and Hindi, however, the word simply translates to Jewish. The Bene Israel's prayers include intercessions on behalf of Her Majesty as in several Commonwealth countries.Weil, Shalva. 1994 'The Secular & Religious Elite among the Bene Israel Jews in India', Pe\u2019amim 60: 49-63. (Hebrew) The Jewish Chronicle of London reported on Karachi's Jews as recently as 2007. In general elections 2013, it was reported that 809 adult Jews were enrolled as voters. The number of Jewish women voters was 427 against 382 men in the community. By 2017, according to the Election Commission of Pakistan around 900 Jews were registered as voters in the country.also in 2017 According to the National Database and Registration Authority, there are 745 registered Jewish families in Pakistan. Most of the Karachi Jews now live in Ramla, Israel, Mumbai, India and Toronto, Ontario, Canada with several spread throughout the United States of America and built a synagogue they named Magen Shalome after the Pakistani Synagogue in Ramla. Developments in the Middle East peace process led to the first high level meeting between Israeli and Pakistani foreign ministers. The foreign ministers of both countries met publicly for the first time in Istanbul, a diplomatic breakthrough brokered by Turkey. ==Prominent people== * Nissim Ezekiel (Talkar), Poet and Teacher (Recipient of the Padma Shri India's highest civilian honour) * Dan Kiesel, physiotherapist for the Pakistan Cricket Team. * Solomon David Omerdekar, Magane Shalom Synagogue Founder (Karachi), Land Surveyor * Abraham Reuben Kamerlekar, City Councillor (Karachi) * Jean Francis Miriam Jhirad, Historian, Gladstone Memorial Prize recipient * Dr. Eliezer Bhorupkar, Surgeon (Karachi) * Moses Somake, Architect * Esther Gershone, Teacher * Aaron Sassoon Benjamin Kandlekar, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Karachi Port Trust), Fellow RINA * Yoel Moses Reuben (Satamkar), Author and Researcher \"The Jews of Pakistan: A Forgotten Heritage\" * Daniel Abraham Satamkar, Shipping Agent, Philanthropist * Colonel George E.

Antisemitism is in decline in Pakistan today. The massive demographic influx of Mohajirs from the Dominion of India upon independence and the creation of Israel and the consequent Arab\u2013Israeli conflict worsened Jew-hatred as witnessed by the 1948 Muslim occupation and eventual destruction of Karachi's Magane Shalom synagogue. Before the 1970s, generally there were no anti-Semitic feelings towards the Jews of Pakistan. ===Mewa Shah Graveyard=== The Jewish Bene Israel Graveyard remains in the larger Mewa Shah Graveyard in Karachi. ==Further reading== * \"The Jews of Pakistan-A forgotten heritage\", Yoel Reuben (Satamkar), Bene Israel heritage museum and genealogical research centre, 2010 * \"So, what's your Kar-A journey into unknown India & Pakistan\", Eliaz Reuben- Dandeker, Kammodan Mocadem Publishing house, 2018 * \"The guide for the Bene Israel of India-culture, history and customs\", Eliaz Reuben-Dandeker, Kammodan Mocadem Publishing house, 2019 * \"The Jammaat-Inspiring people of the Bene Israel of India community, Eliaz Reuben-Dandeker, Kammodan Mocadem Publishing house, 2020 ==See also== * Pakistani Jews in Israel * Religion in Pakistan ==References== ==Sources== Above material is based on an article of Prof. Adil Najam of Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, published in Pakistan's newspaper The Daily Times. 1 ==External links== * Bene Israel graveyard: buried in time or conscience? * In search of Jews in Karachi * When Jews found refuge in an unlikely place: Pakistan * The Jews of Pakistan Category:Jews and Judaism in Pakistan Pakistan Jews Jews Category:Israel\u2013Pakistan relations Category:History of the foreign relations of Pakistan ",
