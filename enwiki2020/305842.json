    "text": "Juris Hartmanis (born July 5, 1928) is a prominent computer scientist and computational theorist who, with Richard E. Stearns, received the 1993 ACM Turing Award \"in recognition of their seminal paper which established the foundations for the field of computational complexity theory\". Hartmanis was born in Latvia. He was a son of ,In the Baltic languages, own-names are not lexical constants but have different grammatical forms. Hartmanis must be understood as Hartman-is, whereby Hartman is the stem of the own-name, whereas the suffix -is indicates a masculine grammatical form in the Latvian language. In a similar manner, for example, the philosopher Kant is known as Kantas in the Lithuanian language. a general in the Latvian Army, and brother of poet Astrid Ivask. After the Soviet Union occupied Latvia in 1940, M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Hartmanis was arrested by Soviets and died in a prison. At the end of World War II, the wife and children of M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Hartmanis left Latvia as refugees, fearing for their safety if the Soviet Union took over Latvia again. They first moved to Germany, where Juris Hartmanis received the equivalent of a master's degree in physics from the University of Marburg. Then he moved to the United States, where he received master's degree in applied mathematics at the University of Kansas City (now known as the University of Missouri-Kansas City) in 1951 and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Caltech under the supervision of Robert P. Dilworth in 1955. The University of Missouri-Kansas City honored him with Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in May 1999. After teaching at Cornell University and Ohio State University, Hartmanis joined the General Electric Research Laboratory in 1958. While at General Electric, he developed many principles of computational complexity theory. In 1965, he became a professor at Cornell University. At Cornell, he was one of founders and the first chairman of its computer science department (which was one of the first computer science departments in the world). Hartmanis is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and of the American Mathematical SocietyList of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-01-19. and a member of the National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Sciences.National Academy of Sciences Members and Foreign Associates Elected , National Academy of Sciences, April 30, 2013. He is best known for his Turing-award-winning paper with Richard Stearns, in which he introduced time complexity classes TIME (f(n)) and proved the time hierarchy theorem. Another paper by Hartmanis from 1977, with Leonard Berman, introduced the still-unsolved Berman\u2013Hartmanis conjecture that all NP-complete languages are polynomial time isomorphic. ==Selected publications== *. *. ==References== ==External links== *Hartmanis biography at Cornell * Category:American computer scientists Category:Theoretical computer scientists Category:1928 births Category:Living people Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Turing Award laureates Category:Cornell University faculty Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:Latvian emigrants to the United States Category:Latvian World War II refugees Category:20th- century American engineers Category:20th-century American scientists Category:Santa Fe Institute people Category:University of Marburg alumni Category:University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City alumni Category:Ohio State University faculty ",
