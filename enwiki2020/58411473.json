In 2011, based on new molecular studies, the genera Morinda and Gynochthodes were redescribed, which necessitated new combinations and names in these genera. This resulted in Morinda jasminoides being assigned to the genus Gynochthodes by Sylvain Razafimandimbison and Birgitta Bremer. ==References== ==External links== *Flora NT Northern Territory Flora online: Gynochthodes jasminoides. *VicFlora Flora of Victoria: Gynochthodes jasminoides. jasminoides Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1834 ",
