    "text": "Miss Prissy is a character in Warner Bros. Cartoons. She is typically described as an old spinster hen, thinner than the other hens in the chicken coop, wearing a blue bonnet and wire-rimmed glasses. She is often mocked by the other hens, who describe her as \"old square britches\". ==History== Miss Prissy's first appearance was in the 1950 short An Egg Scramble, the only cartoon featuring her and Porky Pig together, in which the other hens are making fun of the fact that she cannot lay an egg (because she thinks it's embarrassing). Her next appearances are centered on Foghorn Leghorn. In Lovelorn Leghorn (1951), she is set on finding a husband and in Of Rice and Hen (1953) she is looking to have children. However, in Little Boy Boo (1954) she is depicted as a widow with a child Egghead Jr. and with a much more extensive vocabulary in long sounding words than her trademark \"yeeesss.\" A Broken Leghorn (1959) and Strangled Eggs (1961) features Henery Hawk, and in these shorts, it is usually Foghorn who is pursuing Prissy for his own selfish needs. He does, however, show an unusual sympathy for her emotional vulnerability. Miss Prissy also appeared in the 1980 cartoon The Yolk's on You. ==Later appearances== Miss Prissy appears in The Looney Tunes Show episode \"The Foghorn Leghorn Story\" voiced by Grey DeLisle. She played Mama Leghorn in Foghorn Leghorn's movie called \"The Foghorn Leghorn Story.\" ==References== ==External links== Category:Looney Tunes characters Category:Fictional chickens Category:Film characters introduced in 1950 ",
