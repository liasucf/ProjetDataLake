Latvia has already lost EUR 12.2 million (LVL 8.54 million) of EU funds due to hesitation over the Rail Baltica project, and the EU Transport Commissioner has stated there is no chance that the EU will contribute funds to the proposed Moscow link despite Augulis' assertion that the EU could contribute up to 85%. The high-speed railroad project between Riga and Moscow is economically justified due to increasing passenger and cargo turnover, and it is not political, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said after a meeting with Augulis. ==References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Dobele Category:Latvian Farmers' Union politicians Category:Ministers of Welfare of Latvia Category:Transport ministers of Latvia Category:Deputies of the 9th Saeima Category:Deputies of the 10th Saeima Category:Deputies of the 11th Saeima Category:Deputies of the 12th Saeima Category:Deputies of the 13th Saeima Category:University of Latvia alumni ",
