    "text": "Rusalka (), Op. 114, is an opera ('lyric fairy tale') by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. The Czech libretto was written by the poet Jaroslav Kvapil (1868\u20131950) based on the fairy tales of Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben and Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1. A rusalka is a water sprite from Slavic mythology, usually inhabiting a lake or river. Rusalka was the ninth opera Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed. It is one of the most successful Czech operas, and represents a cornerstone of the repertoire of Czech opera houses. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had played viola for many years in pit orchestras in Prague (Estates Theatre from 1857 until 1859 while a student, then from 1862 until 1871 at the Provisional Theatre). He thus had direct experience of a wide range of operas by Mozart, Weber, Rossini, Lortzing, Verdi, Wagner and Smetana. For many years unfamiliarity with Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's operas outside the Czech lands helped reinforce a perception that composition of operas was a marginal activity, and that despite the beauty of its melodies and orchestral timbres Rusalka was not a central part of his output or of international lyric theatre. In recent years it has been performed more regularly by major opera companies. In the five seasons from 2008 to 2013 it was performed by opera companies worldwide far more than all of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's other operas combined.In the five seasons from 2008/09 through 2012/13, Rusalka had 124 productions (performance runs), The Devil and Kate 7, Jakobin 5, Armida 2, and The Spectre's Bride, one, totaling 15 for the other operas combined. Vanda had a performance run March through May 2014 . Operabase. Retrieved 16 August 2014 The most popular excerpt from Rusalka is the \"Song to the Moon\" (\"\") from act 1, which is often performed in concert and recorded separately. It has also been arranged for violin and used on film sound tracks. ==Composition history== R\u016f\u017eena Maturov\u00e1 as the first Rusalka Kvapil's libretto, based on the fairy tales of Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben and Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1, was written before he had any contact with the composer. The plot contains elements which also appear in The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen and in Undine by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9, and has been described as a \"sad, modern fairy tale\", in a similar vein to his previous play, Princessa Pampeli\u0161ka.Lemariov\u00e1 M.: \"Rusalka \u2013 its dramatic conception and philosophy\" (summary). In: Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Dramatik / Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k the Dramatist, ed Jitka Brabcov\u00e1 and Jarmil Burghauser. Theatre Institute, Prague, 1994. The libretto was completed by 1899, when Kvapil began looking for composers interested in setting his text to music. His composer friends were engaged with other works, but mentioned that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was looking for a project. The composer, always interested in Erben's stories, read the libretto and composed his opera quite rapidly, with the first draft begun on 22 April 1900 and completed by the end of November. Coming after his four symphonic poems inspired by the folk-ballads of Erben of 1896\u201397, Rusalka may be viewed as the culmination of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's exploration of a \"wide variety of drama-creating musical techniques\".Loppert M. \"Catching up with Rusalka.\" Essay in programme book, Glyndebourne Festival Opera 2009, p. 86. ==Performance history== Rusalka was first performed in Prague on 31 March 1901, with R\u016f\u017eena Maturov\u00e1 as the first Rusalka. It became an enormous success in Czech lands, and soon gained success also abroad. The first performance outside Bohemia took place in Ljubljana.Vrkocov\u00e1 L.

The opera was given in Vienna by a Czech company in 1910; in German translation it was given in Stuttgart in 1935. The UK stage premiere was at Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1959; a 1983 production by English National Opera was filmed and revived several times.Smaczny J. \"Rusalka\".

The United States premiere of the opera was presented by the San Diego Opera in 1975 with Kathryn Bouleyn in the title role.

Rusalka, the Water-Nymph, tells her father she has fallen in love with a human Prince who comes to hunt around the lake, and she wants to become human to embrace him. He tells her it is a bad idea, but nonetheless steers her to a witch, Je\u017eibaba, for assistance. Rusalka sings her \"Song to the Moon\", asking it to tell the Prince of her love. Je\u017eibaba tells Rusalka that, if she becomes human, she will lose the power of speech and immortality; moreover, if she does not find love with the Prince, he will die and she will be eternally damned. Rusalka agrees to the terms and drinks a potion. The Prince, hunting a white doe, finds Rusalka, embraces her, and leads her away, as her father and sisters lament. ===Act 2=== The garden of the Prince's castle A Gamekeeper and his nephew, the Kitchen-Boy, note that the Prince is to be married to a mute and nameless bride. They suspect witchcraft and doubt it will last, as the Prince is already lavishing attentions on a Foreign Princess who is a wedding guest. The Foreign Princess, jealous, curses the couple. The prince rejects Rusalka. Rusalka then goes back to the lake with her father the Water-Gnome. Though she has now won the Prince's affections, the Foreign Princess is disgusted by the Prince's fickleness and betrayal and she scorns him, telling him to follow his rejected bride to Hell. ===Act 3=== A meadow by the edge of a lake Rusalka asks Je\u017eibaba for a solution to her woes and is told she can save herself if she kills the Prince with the dagger she is given. Rusalka rejects this, throwing the dagger into the lake. Rusalka becomes a bludi\u010dka, a spirit of death living in the depths of the lake, emerging only to lure humans to their deaths. The Gamekeeper and the Kitchen Boy consult Je\u017eibaba about the Prince, who, they say, has been betrayed by Rusalka. The Water-Goblin says that it was actually the Prince that betrayed Rusalka. The wood-sprites mourn Rusalka's plight. The Prince, searching for his white doe, comes to the lake, senses Rusalka, and calls for her. He asks her to kiss him, even knowing her kiss means death and damnation. They kiss and he dies; and the Water-Goblin comments that \"All sacrifices are futile.\" Rusalka thanks the Prince for letting her experience human love, commends his soul to God, and returns to her place in the depths of the lake as a demon of death. ==Instrumentation== Rusalka is scored for 2 flutes, 1 piccolo, 2 oboes, 1 English horn, 2 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, percussion, harp and strings. ==Music== Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's music is generally through-composed, and uses motifs for Rusalka, her damnation, the water sprite and the forest. His word-setting is expressive while allowing for nationally inflected passages, and Grove judges that the work shows the composer at the height of his maturity. He uses established theatrical devices \u2013 dance sections, comedy (Gamekeeper and Turnspit) and pictorial musical depiction of nature (forest and lake). Rodney Milnes (who provided the translation for an ENO production) admired the \"wealth of melodic patterns that are dramatic in themselves and its shimmering orchestration\".Milnes R., \"A centenary love letter \u2013 Rodney Milnes celebrates Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\", Opera, July 2004, pp. 780\u201385. One writer considered the final section of the opera \u2013 the duet for the Prince and Rusalka \u2013 as \"[twelve] or so of the most glorious minutes in all opera\" in their \"majestic, almost hymnic solemnity\" while another described the opera as a \"vivid, profoundly disturbing drama\". ==Recordings== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Cast (Rusalka, The Prince, Vodn\u00edk, Foreign Princess, Je\u017eibaba) !Conductor, Opera house and orchestra !Label |- |1952||Ludmila \u010cervinkov\u00e1, Beno Blachut, Eduard Haken, Marie Podvalov\u00e1, Marta Kr\u00e1sov\u00e1 |Jaroslav Krombholc, Prague National Theatre Chorus and Orchestra |CD: Supraphon Cat: SU 3811-2Review in Classical Recordings Quarterly, Spring 2007, Vol 48, p. 96. |- |1961||Milada \u0160ubrtov\u00e1, Ivo \u017d\u00eddek, Eduard Haken, Alena Mikov\u00e1, Marie Ov\u010d\u00e1\u010dikov\u00e1 |Zden\u011bk Chalabala, Prague National Theatre Chorus and Orchestra |LP: Supraphon Cat: SU 50440 3Review in Classical Recordings Quarterly, Autumn 2005, Vol 42, p. 63. |- |1984||Gabriela Be\u0148a\u010dkov\u00e1, Wies\u0142aw Ochman, Richard Nov\u00e1k, Drahom\u00edra Drobkov\u00e1, V\u011bra Soukupov\u00e1 |V\u00e1clav Neumann, Czech Philharmonic & Prague Philharmonic Choir |CD: Supraphon (re-issue in 2003) Cat: SU 3178-2 633 |- |1986||Eilene Hannan, John Treleaven, Rodney Macann, Phyllis Cannan, Ann Howard |Mark Elder, Orchestra and chorus of English National Opera, (Sung in English; director David Pountney) |DVD: Arthaus Musik (released 2006) Cat: 102 019 |- |1997||Ursula Furi-Bernhard, Walter Coppola, Marcel Rosca, Tiziana K.
