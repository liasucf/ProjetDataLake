    "text": "The Zainichi (Koreans-in-Japan) cinema refers to the transnational film industry of Japan, South and North Korea. With the main theme on the struggles or experiences faced by the resident Korean community or individuals in Japan, the Zainichi cinema is characterized by a wide range of film genres, which encompass melodramas to Yakuza films. == Background == === Earlier Zainichi- themed films === The earliest Japanese films featuring Koreans or resident Koreans in Japan can be traced back to the propaganda films of the early 1920s, when Korea was still under the Japanese colonial rule. During this period, Koreans in Japan were often depicted as members of the peripheral society rather than the main characters. Moreover, the film of this era exclusively tied this particular population to the two-way images of poverty and cheap laborers. For example, in films such as Look at This Mom (1930) and The Brick Factory Girl (1940), Korean laborers in Japan were primarily depicted as impoverished residents of the marginal slums where they closely lived with other poor people. Additionally, in a film titled Mr. Thank You (1936) directed by Shimizu Hiroshi, a scene, where nomadic Korean construction workers and their family move from one place to another in Japan, was inserted while highlighting the exploitive treatment of laborers from Korea. In the postwar era, several films played an instrumental role in publicly visualizing the struggles and oppression experienced by Zainichi Koreans. In doing so, however, the Zainichi-themed films often replicated the stereotypes of Zainichi Koreans as \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201ccriminal.\u201d Prominently, Death by Hanging (1968) directed by Oshima Nagisa drew the struggles of a young Zainichi Korean prisoner. The main character named \u201cR\u201d allegedly murdered two Japanese women after raping them. Following his arrest, the trial decided that R be executed by hanging. In the film, his violence was portrayed as an explosive manifestation of his complicated identity crisis, while his delinquent past and domestic violence within his family exclusively colored the personal character of R. Other films of this era included By a Man's Face You Shall Know (1966) by Kato Tai, Three Resurrected Drunkards (1968) by Oshima Nagisa, and Empire of Kids (1981) by Izutsu Kazuyuki. These postwar films of the 20th century were generally illustrative of the struggles and difficulties faced by many Zainichi Koreans. At the same time, Zainichi characters were repeatedly represented as Yakuza members or criminals, thereby sustaining their image as violent social outcasts. In 1975, a movie titled River of the Stranger was shot and released by director Lee Hak-in. Unlike the earlier films with the depiction of Zainichi characters, this film was the first Zainichi-themed film that was directed by a Zainichi Korean director. Subsequently, his work was followed by other Zainichi Korean film directors such as Sai Yoichi, Lee Sang- il, Yang Yong-hi, Oh Mipo, and Sugino Kiki, while Japanese directors continued to produce Zainichi-themed films. === Contemporary Zainichi films (1990s-Present) === In 1993, director Sai Yoichi released an award-winning movie titled All Under the Moon. The unveiling of this film was seen by many critics as the major transition in the existing representation of Zainichi Koreans in the film industry. Based on a novel called Taxi Crazy Rapsody, the story unfolds when a Zainichi taxi driver, Tadao, fell in love with a Filipino bartender. The melodramatic portrayal of Zainichi characters was unconventional in that it broke the recurring representation of Zainichi Koreans as Yakuza members or violent criminals. Since 2000, many Zainichi- themed films such as Go (2001), Blood and Bones (2004), Break Through! (2005) have been released. In comparison to the limited availability and representation in the earlier Zainichi-themed films, the recently released films have enabled more humanistic representation of Zainichi Koreans. Moreover, Zainichi-themed films such as Our School (2007) and Anarchist from Colony (2017) were directed by South Korean film directors, respectively Kim Myeong-joon and Lee Joon-ik. This transnational trend has brought some new insights into the contemporary Zainichi cinema while reflecting this rapidly changing film industry. == Film festivals and awards == === Film festivals and awards received === * All Under the Moon (1993) by Sai Yoichi ** 67th Kinema Junpo - Best Film Award ** 36th Blue Ribbon Awards - Best Film Award and Best Actress Awards ** 18th Hochi Film Awards - Best Film Award, Best Director Award, Best Actress Award ** 48th Mainichi Film Awards - Best Film Award and Best Actor Award ** 17th Japan Academy Prize - Best Film Award *Dear Pyongyang (2005) by Yang Yong-hi **2006 Berlin International Film Festival - Netpac Award Winner **2006 Sundance Film Festival - Special Jury Prize * Sona, the Other Myself (2010) by Yang Yong-hi **2009 Busan International Film Festival **2010 Berlin International Film Festival **2010 Nippon Connection **2011 Pan- Asian Film Festival *Our Homeland (2012) by Yang Yong-hi **2012 Berlin International Film Festival == Directors of Zainichi cinema (A-Z order) == * Arai, Hideo *Chiba, Yasuki * Chong, Wishing *Izutsu, Kazuyuki *Kato, Tai *Kim, Myeong-joon *Kobayashi, Masaki * Lee, Hak-in * Lee, Joon-ik * Lee, Sang-il *Oguri, Kohei *Oh, Mipo * Oshima, Nagisa *Park, Yeong I * Sai, Yoichi *Sugino, Kiki * Yang, Yong-hi *Yukisada, Isao == List of Zainichi-themed films == === 1930s === * Look at This Mom (1930) *Mr. Thank You (1936) === 1940s-50s === * The Brick Factory Girl (1940) * Children of Korea (1952) *The Thick-Walled Room (1956) === 1960s-70s === * By a Man's Face Shall You Know Him (1966) *Three Resurrected Drunkards (1968) *Death by Hanging (1968) * River of the Stranger (1975) * Red Tengi (1979) === 1980s-90s === * Empire of Kids (1981) * For Kayako (1985) *All Under the Moon (1993) === 2000s-Present === *Go (2001) *Blood and Bones (2004) *Break Through!
