    "text": "Villa Jacini is a large rural palace located on Via Conte Stefano Jacini the frazione of Zuccone Robasacco, within the town limits of Triuggio, Province of Monza and Brianza, region of Lombardy, Italy. ==History== The location was notable since 1289 by the presence of a chapel or small church, still present on the property as the chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Zuccone San Giovanni led to the construction of a rural palace of lodge, later also known as Villa Sacro Cuore, Villa Zuccone Jacini, or Villa Zuccone Rubasacco. A request to build an oratory at the site was made in 1571, by Battista Fedele to the archbishop of Milan, Carlo Borromeo. The property came into hands of the Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini (1725-1796) who used the property as a hunting lodge. The land then became property of Michele Bussi, a merchant of Milan, who was the great-grandfather of the Countess Carolina Jacini, widow of Cavi. The family commissioned a refurbishment of the property by the architect Marquis Antonio Citterio (1853-1936), pupil of Camillo Boito. He designed two advancing wings and more theatrical facades with statues and gardens. Decorative door and window frames, twirling chimneys, and wrought-iron balconies give the small property an air of elegance. The entrance is through a bifurcated staircase. The interiors were decorated in the late 19th-century with trompe-l'oeil and stucco.Lombardia Beni Culturali, description of the villa and history, Annamaria Spataro (2011), Daniele Garnerone, and Ferdinando Zanzottera.
