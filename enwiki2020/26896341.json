    "text": "Abdul Samad () is a male Muslim given name, built on the Arabic words Abd, al- and Samad. The name means \"servant of the Everlasting\", al-Samad being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names. Because the letter s is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written with letters corresponding to Abd al-Samad, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd as- Samad. Alternative transliterations include Abdus Samad and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation.
