    "text": "Josef Kott (born December 7, 1957 in Rakovn\u00edk) and Michael Kut\u00edlek (born February 23, 1951 in Prague - March 15, 2017) were a pair of Czech spree killers who, in the course of 26 hours, murdered four people and injured one (one of the victims was murdered before the spree). Both were later sentenced to life imprisonment. The two men are considered the first spree killers in the history of the post-communist Czech Republic. Interestingly, three of these killings were committed just as the death penalty was abolished in the country on May 2, 1990. == Lives before the murders == Josef Kott was born in Rakovn\u00edk. He worked as a professional soldier, later working for the Federal Interior Ministry. This is where his troubles began. He returned to the army, gained the rank of lieutenant, but also started stealing, losing his rank soon afterwards. Michael Kut\u00edlek was born in Prague. As early as pre-school age, he played the piano and tennis. He was intelligent, but also robbed his classmates, later being diagnosed as a polymorphic psychopath. Kott and Kut\u00edlek met in 1988 at the Minsk Prison. Kott promised Kut\u00edlek that he would show him how to make money through murder. Both men left prison in 1990 on the basis of amnesties by President V\u00e1clav Havel - Kut\u00edlek being released on January 6, and Kott on March 1. Krimiseri\u00e1l: Dva krut\u00ed ces\u0165\u00e1ci s vra\u017edou - Chrudimsk\u00fd den\u00edk == Murders == On the night of May 2, 1990, both arrived in N\u00fd\u0159any in a Tatra 613 limousine. Disguised as police officers, they visited a guard named Frantisek Korbel, claiming that they wanted to perform a routine check on his weapon. When he handed them the weapon and they tried to seize it on the basis of a document controversy, he accused them of not being real police officers. So Kott shot him in the head. A witness described the two men: one in civilian and the other in a public security uniform. Kott and Kut\u00edlek left after the murder towards Zbiroh, where they noticed two 16-year- old trackers named Dita Dubsk\u00e1 and Sylvia Landov\u00e1. They took them to a remote place where they tied their hands behind their backs and murdered them. Kut\u00edlek admitted that both were murdered in a \"satanic\" ritual, in which more than 57 knives had to be used. On May 3, Kott and Kut\u00edlek drove to Prague, where they shot and robbed a taxi driver. Then, at a bar called \"The Three Barrels\" in Ka\u0159ez, they shot a British truck driver. The man survived, and identified the attackers. Kott and Kut\u00edlek were soon detained.Kott a Kut\u00edlek, \u0161ance na svobodu == Trial == Kott never admitted his guilt. Kut\u00edlek claimed that at the time of their capture, the highest possible punishment was 25 years, in addition, trying to confuse the court experts with Kott. The request failed, and both men were sentenced to life in 1995. In 2006, Kut\u00edlek claimed he was the sole perpetrator and that Kott had nothing to do with the murders. The court dismissed his proposal, with no new evidence to re-establish the case.Vrahov\u00e9 Kott a Kut\u00edlek s \u017e\u00e1dost\u00ed neusp\u011bli In 2008, Kut\u00edlek confessed to a fifth murder he committed in the spring 1990, without Kott. The victim was a 19-year-old young man whom Kut\u00edlek had stabbed in the heart. This murder, however, did not change Kut\u00edlek's sentence.Do\u017eivotn\u011b odsouzen\u00fd mu\u017e p\u0159iznal po 18 letech p\u00e1tou vra\u017edu == References == Category:Criminal duos Category:1951 births Category:1957 births Category:People from Rakovn\u00edk Category:Satanists Category:Czech spree killers Category:People from Prague Category:Living people ",
