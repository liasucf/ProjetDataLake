If you have, for example, over 70 machines then the configuration process will take a long time if it is done manually.autoconnect \u2013 This module helps in automatic client-server discovery and connection setup for networked applications \u2013 Google Project Hosting. Code.google.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-03. Automatic server discovery often uses Multicast UDP to send broadcasts, to which available license servers respond with information about their network location. When a licensed server is discovered, the information is locally cached on the client machine, so automatic server discovery does not have to be performed at each application startup. The newest version of NTP also supports Automatic server discovery. There are three schemes provided by NTPv4: * Broadcast / Multicast * Manycast * Server poolAutomatic Server Discovery.

Automatic server discovery typically works only on local networks, and will not work on WAN or VPN connections. ==See also== * License manager * Floating licensing == References == == External links == * ISA Server and Automatic Server Discovery * Automatic Server Discovery schemes provided in NTPv4 * Configuring Automatic Discovery for ISA Server Clients Category:System administration Category:Software licenses Category:Internet broadcasting ",
