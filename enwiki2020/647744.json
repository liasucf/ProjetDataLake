    "text": "Kenitra () is a city in western Morocco, formerly known as Port Lyautey from 1932 to 1956. It is a port on the Sbu river, has a population in 2014 of 431,282, is one of the three main cities of the Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra region and the capital of Kenitra Province. During the Cold War Kenitra's U.S. Naval Air Facility served as a stopping point in North Africa. ==History== ===Ancient history=== The history of the city begins with the foundation of a trading- post by the Carthaginian, known back then as Thamusida. Under the Antonine dynasty, a Venus temple was built there. Before the French protectorate, there was only Kasbah Mahdiyya in the area where the modern city can today be found. ===Colonial and recent history=== In March 1912 the French government and the Sultan of Morocco, Abd al-Hafid, signed the Treaty of Fez. Because of his growing unpopularity, the Sultan asked the French government for protection against the Berber rebel tribes surrounding Fez. France appointed Hubert Lyautey resident-general in Morocco. General Lyautey restored peace and order to the country after crushing the tribal uprising. After safely moving the Sultan from Fez to the current capital city, Rabat, Lyautey began his task of civilian administration. Sebou River - Corniche One of the first preoccupations of General Lyautey was to build ports along the inhabitable Atlantic coast where there were no natural harbors. He established Kenitra in 1912 as a French military fort and town. The port at Kenitra, at the mouth of the Sebou river, was opened in 1913.K\u00e9nitra depuis 1912 It soon became the best river port in Morocco.In Morocco by Edith Wharton, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1920 Kenitra draws its name from a culvert built at Fouarat lake upstream of the kasbah. This culvert was destroyed in 1928. In 1933, the French officially named the locale \"Port Lyautey\". It was renamed \"Quneitra\" in 1956 as Morocco gained its independence. Quneitra has grown rapidly to be a shipping centre for agricultural produce (mainly fruit), fish, timber, and lead and zinc ores. The city's industrial area lies upstream of the port. ===U.S. Naval Base=== Air base of Kenitra: Public works and maintenance department In November 1942, after Operation Torch, the Americans captured the Port Lyautey French fighter base as a military base, named Craw Field. For three months the 21st Engineer Aviation Regiment worked on the airfield. In Feb. 1943 the Seabees of the 120th Naval Construction Battalion took over all construction activities.Port Lyautey, Chapter XX, The Mediterranean Area, Building the Navy's Bases in World War II, History of the Bureau of Yards and Docks and the Civil Engineer Corp, 1940-1946, Volume II, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE, WASHINGTON, p. 80 The Navy ran the base until 1947, when the State Department negotiated reversion of control to France. In 1950, a $23,000,000 expansion was authorized, but then the Korean War diverted resources. In the 1950s, nearly 10,000 persons were on the base making it the largest aggregation of Americans in any one overseas base outside Japan. Later, the base at Kenitra was expanded to become a U.S. Naval Air Station. The base was shared by both the US and Morocco through the Cold War. A small Navy communications out-station at Sidi Yahia closed in the late 1970s. The Air Station was closed in 1991. ==Climate== Kenitra has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). ==Population== {| align=\"center\" rules=\"all\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" style=\"border: 1px solid #999; border-right: 2px solid #999; border-bottom:2px solid #999\" |+ style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em\"| Population of Quneitra province from 1982 to 2014 |-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" !1982 !! 1994 !! 2004 !! 2010 !! 2014 |- | align=center| || align=center| || align=center| || align=center| || align=center| |} ==Areas and neighborhoods== *Mdina ** Khabazate ** The Cigogne ** La cite *Modern city ** Mimosa ** Ville Haute *Popular districts ** Saknia ** Wuled Oujih **Maghrib al Arabi *Residential districts **Bir Rami **Ismailia **Val fleury ==Education== ===Primary and secondary schools=== There is a French international school, Groupe scolaire Honor\u00e9-de-Balzac, serving moyenne section through coll\u00e8ge (junior high school). ===Colleges and universities=== * (UIT) *ENCG K\u00e9nitra () *HECI K\u00e9nitra (Hautes Etudes Commerciales et Informatiques) *ENSA K\u00e9nitra (\u00c9cole nationale des sciences appliqu\u00e9es de K\u00e9nitra) ==Transportation== *The National Route 1 and the A1 motorway pass through Kenitra and connect it to Rabat-Sal\u00e9 in the south-west and to Larache in the north-east. *The city is served by one railway station: Kenitra-Ville.
