    "text": "The al-Dawayima massacre describes the killing of civilians by the Israeli army (IDF) that took place in the Palestinian Arab town of al-Dawayima on October 29, 1948, during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. The incident occurred after the town was occupied by the IDF's 89th Commando Battalion during Operation Yoav, encountering little resistance. The battalion, whose first commander was Moshe Dayan, was composed of former Irgun and Lehi forces. Benny Morris has estimated that hundreds of people were killed. Lieutenant-General John Bagot Glubb, the British commander of Jordan's Arab Legion stated the numbers were much smaller, citing a UN report for a figure of 30 women and children killed.Sir John Bagot Glubb, A Soldier with the Arabs, London 1957, pp. 211-212.\"On October 31st, United Nations observers reported that the Israelis had killed thirty women and children at Dawaima (Dawayima), west of Hebron. It would be an exaggeration to claim that great numbers were massacred. But just enough were killed, or roughly handled, to make sure that all the civilian population took flight, thereby leaving more and more land vacant for future Jewish settlement. These particular villages west of Hebron were to remain vacant and their lands uncultivated for eight years.\" A follow- up report delivered to the United Nations by a delegation from the Arab Refugee Congress reported that the Arab Legion had had an interest in underplaying the extent of the massacre, which was, it claimed, worse than the Deir Yassin massacre, in order to avoid further panic and refugee flight.'The Dawaymeh Massacre,' United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Technical Committee, United Nations A/AC.25/Com.Tech/W.3, 14 June 1949.'The reason why so little is known about this massacre which, in many respects, was more brutal than the Deir Yassin massacre, is because the Arab Legion (the Army in control of that area) feared that if the news was allowed to spread, it would have the same effect on the moral of the peasantry that Deir Yassin had, namely to cause another flow of Arab refugees.' The village mukhtar Hassan Mahmoud Ihdeib, in a sworn statement, estimated the number of victims as 145.Jonathan Ofir, 'The Mukhtar\u2019s sworn testimony,' Mondoweiss, February 12, 2016. ==Background== Al-Dawayima's core clan, the Ahdibs, traced their ancestry to the conquest of Palestine by Umar ibn Khattab in the 7th century. At the time, it had a population of 6,000 since some 4,000 Palestinian Arab refugees had taken refuge in the village prior to the massacre.UN Doc. Com Tech/W.3 United Nation Conciliation Commission for Palestine Technical committee Report Submitted by the Arab Refugee Congress Dated 14 June 1949 The Haganah intelligence service (HIS) considered the village to be 'very friendly'. Dawayima was situated a few kilometres west of Hebron. Al-Dawayima 1933 1:20,000 ==Witness accounts== ===The village mukhtar's account=== According to the village headman, Hassan Mahmoud Ihdeib, a half an hour after midday prayers, the village was approached from three groups of troops, from the West, North and South: 20 armoured cars on the Qubeiba-Dawaymeh road, a second group along the Beit Jibrin-Dawaymeh road, and other set of armoured cars approaching from Mafkhar-Dawaymeh. He stated that no call to surrender was announced, and that no resistance took place. Firing began at a distance of 1/2 kilometer as the semi-circular arc of forces closed in. The Israeli troops fired indiscriminately for over an hour, during which time many fled, and two Palestinian groups took refuge respectively in the Mosque and a nearby cave called Iraq El Zagh. On returning the day with other villagers, 60 bodies were found in the mosque, mostly of elderly men. Numerous corpses of men, women and children, lay in the streets. 80 bodies of men, women and children were then found in the entrance of the Iraq El Zagh cavern. On making a census, it emerged that 455 persons were missing, 280 men, and the remainder women and children. ===The event according to Benny Morris=== The letter by Kaplan was published in full in Haaretz in February 2016. Translation: The original of the letter was removed from the archive where it has previously been available. Benny Morris writes: The soldier-witness, according to Kaplan, said From the sworn Statement given by the Mukhtar of Dawaymeh village, Hassan Mahmaod Ihdeib. Morris has estimated \"hundreds\" of people were killed, he also reports on the IDF investigation, which concluded around 100 villagers had been killed, and cites an account by a Mapam member, based on an interview with an Israeli soldier, who reported 80 to 100 men, women and children killed.Benny Morris (2004), The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, p. 469.Benny Morris (2008), 1948: A History the First Arab-Israeli War, p. 333. Saleh Abdel Jawad evaluates the total to \"between 100 and 200\".Saleh Abdel Jawad (2007), Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War, in E. Benvenisti & al, Israel and the Palestinian Refugees, Berlin, Heidelberg, New-York : Springer, pp. 59\u2013127 See page 67. ===Further details according to Ilan Pappe=== Ilan Pappe states that the village was guarded by 20 men who were paralysed by fright when they saw the Israeli troops, and that the semi-circular pincer movement was designed to allow the 6,000 residents the possibility of fleeing eastwards. The massacre took place when the expected wave of flight failed to take place. He also adds that Amos Kenan, who had participated in the Deir Yassin massacre, took part in the assault.Ilan Pappe, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine,(2007)Oneowlrd Publications 2011 pp.195-198. ==The UN inspection team== Members of the 89th Battalion outside Beit Gurvin, during Operation Yoav, October 1948 Members of the 89th Battalion during Operation Yoav, October 1948 Yigal Allon cabled G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Yitzhak Sadeh to check \"the 'rumours' that the 89th Battalion had 'killed many tens of prisoners on the day of the conquest of al-Dawayima', and to respond\".Morris, 2004, pp. 469-471 On the 5 November probably worried about a UN investigation Allon then ordered Sadeh to instruct the unit: Although unbeknownst to Allon, the 89th had cleaned up the site of the massacre on 1 November 1948.Morris, 2004, p. 495. endnote 49 On 7 November, UN inspectors visited the scene of the village to investigate accusations of a massacre, the accusation being made by the Egyptians and refugees from the village. The team found \"several demolished buildings and one corpse but no other physical evidence of a massacre\". The UN team did however take a witness statement from the village mukhtar Isser Be'eri, the commander of the IDF intelligence service, who conducted an independent investigation, concluded that 80 people had been killed during the occupation of Al-Dawayima and that 22 had been captured and executed subsequently. Be'eri recommended prosecution of the platoon OC, who had confessed to the massacre, but notwithstanding his recommendations no one was put on trial or punished. On 14 November the Israeli cabinet instructed Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to also launch an investigation. Its findings remain secret. ==Reactions== The American consul in Jerusalem, William Burdett, who had received news about the massacre reported on November 16 to Washington \"Investigation by UN indicates massacre occurred but observers are unable to determine number of persons involved.\" News of the massacre reached village communities in the western Hebron and Judean foothills \"possibly precipitating further flight\".
