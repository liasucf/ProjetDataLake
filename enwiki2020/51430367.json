The route runs from an intersection with SR 55 in Lynchburg north and east to SR 64 near Beech Grove. ==Route description== ===Moore County=== SR 82 begins at an intersection with SR 55 in Lynchburg, Moore County, heading northwest on two-lane undivided Flat Creek Highway, a secondary state route. The road runs through a mix of farm fields and woods with some homes and curves to the north, winding through more rural land. The route leaves Lynchburg and crosses into Bedford County. ===Bedford County=== SR 82 continues northwest through fields and forests as an unnamed road before turning north and passing through the community of Flat Creek.

The road turns north and then northwest again before passing near rural residential development and crossing the Duck River. The route enters Shelbyville and becomes Kingree Road, running northwest through residential areas. SR 82 turns north-northwest onto South Britain Street before it curves to the north and becomes South Jefferson Street, widening to four lanes. The road passes to the east of downtown Shelbyville and comes to an intersection with SR 64, at which point that route turns north for a concurrency with SR 82. The two routes follow North Jefferson Street north, crossing the unused tracks of the Walking Horse and Eastern Railroad, before curving west and becoming East Lane Street. The road passes businesses to the north of downtown before SR 82 splits from SR 64 by turning north onto North Main Street, a three-lane road with a center left- turn lane.

Following this, US 231/SR 82 leaves Shelbyville and becomes an unnamed road, running through a mix of fields and woods with some homes. The road passes near commercial development and heads between the Bedford County Medical Center to the west and the Shelbyville Municipal Airport to the east. US 231/SR 82 runs through farmland with some homes and transitions into a four-lane divided highway. SR 82 splits from US 231 (SR 10) south of Deason by turning east onto an unnamed two-lane undivided road. The route runs east through farmland with some woods and homes, becoming Webb Highway. The road continues through rural areas before it enters Bell Buckle, where it becomes Webb Road West and passes a mix of fields and residences.

SR 269 turns north in the downtown area and SR 82 continues east along Webb Road East through residential areas. The road leaves Bell Buckle and becomes unnamed, heading northeast through farmland.
