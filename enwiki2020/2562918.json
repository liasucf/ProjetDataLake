    "text": "In physiology, psychology, or psychophysics, a limen or a liminal point is a sensory threshold of a physiological or psychological response. It is the boundary of perception. On one side of a limen (or threshold) a stimulus is perceivable, on the other side it is not. Liminal, as an adjective, means situated at a sensory threshold, hence barely perceptible. Subliminal means below perception. The absolute threshold is the lowest amount of sensation detectable by a sense organ. ==See also== * Just noticeable difference (least perceptible difference) * Threshold of pain, the boundary where perception becomes pain * Weber\u2013Fechner law (Weber's law) ==References== Category:Physiology Category:Perception ",
