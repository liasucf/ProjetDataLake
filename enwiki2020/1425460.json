The Reds compete in the following sports: men's and women's basketball, men's and women's hockey, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's volleyball, swimming. Men's and women's track & field and cross country running. The men's hockey team has won the University Cup 8 times; in 1998, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2019 as well as finished as runner-up in 1997, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2015. ==History== The name \"Varsity Reds\" was only adopted circa 1993. They are now named the \"Reds\" as of 2018. Prior to 1993, every varsity sport, including football, hockey, women's basketball, men's basketball and men's wrestling had a different name: the Red Bombers, Red Devils, Red Bloomers, Red Raiders, and Black Bears, respectively. ==National championships== Men's Soccer (1) *1980 Men's Ice Hockey (8) *1998 *2007 *2009 *2011 *2013 *2016 *2017 *2019 ==Varsity sports== ===Men's hockey=== Aitken University Centre, University of New Brunswick While the details were not recorded, inter-class and inter-club hockey games at the University of New Brunswick were played as early as 1880. The first recorded competitive UNB hockey game was 5 Feb. 1897 against the local detachment of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Infantry (now the 2nd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment). The game was played in downtown Fredericton at the George Street outdoor rink and UNB lost 3-2. In January 1902, the \"Red and Black\" defeated a team of local bank employees 2-1 in their inaugural season in the Fredericton City League. In the early era, \"home ice\" was a flooded field borrowed from the local garrison and the players cleared the ice. The team captain doubled as coach and the seven-man starting line-up was the entire team. UNB was a founding member of the Maritime Intercollegiate Hockey League and their first varsity game saw UNB defeat Mount Allison 3-2 in January 1906. After a dispute in 1908, UNB, along with Mount Allison, King\u2019s, and Acadia, created their own collegiate league the New Brunswick-Nova Scotia League, in parallel with the MIHL (also referred to as the Maritime Interuniversity Inter-scholastic Hockey League). UNB played in both leagues and was the first team to win the NB-NS league title five times, and thus retained ownership of the Summer Trophy. In 1910 the Maritimes Intercollegiate Athletic Association was formed. UNB acquired its first paid coach, Sandy Staples, in 1911. The MIAA evolved into the AUAA in 1974 and the current AUS in 1999. UNB won their first conference title in 1925. UNB won their next title in 1934 and then not again until 1960. In 1964, UNB won their third title in five years and advanced to the 2nd annual CIAU championship in Kingston, Ontario. UNB won the bronze medal game versus the University of Montreal after losing their first game to eventual champions Alberta. The UNB Red Devils lost in the 1984 CIAU Eastern-Canadian Regional playoffs to powerhouse Toronto (two games to none), and they did not return to the national stage until 1997 when the Varsity Reds (the team name changed starting in 1992/93 season) lost the championship game to Guelph. UNB won their first CIS Championship the following year (1998) in Saskatoon and since have won in 2007 (Moncton), 2009 (Thunder Bay), 2011 (Fredericton), 2013 (Saskatoon) 2016 (Halifax), 2017(Fredericton) and 2019 (Lethbridge). The Reds have also won silver medals in 1997 (Toronto), 2000 (Saskatoon), 2004 (Fredericton), 2008 (Moncton) and 2015 (Halifax). UNB has won 17 AUS conference championship banners, including three of the last five. *Lesley Reddon was part of the 1994\u201395 UNB team and became the first female goaltender to play in the men's Atlantic Universities Hockey Conference, and perhaps in the CIS. * UNB and the St. Thomas Tommies have a fierce rivalry in men's ice hockey. These games, known as the \"Battle of the Hill\" are among the most heavily anticipated and attended despite UNB winning them on a regular basis. * As of 2020, UNB has won eight University Cups (U Sports hockey championships) - more than any other AUS Team, and third among all teams. The team has also won 17 AUS Championships, second only to St Francis Xavier University. === Women's Hockey=== Women's hockey made a return as a varsity team for the 2018-2019 season. The team had been downgraded to a club team after the 2007-2008 season, but after a lengthy legal battle, was reinstated. ===Men's soccer=== *2012: Coach Miles Pinsent was named AUS and CIS coach of the year. *2014: Captain Alexandre Haiart leads the team to victory at the Atlantic University Sport Championship. ===Men's and Women's Track & Field and Cross Country=== The UNB Track and Field team was established during the 2011-2012 school year.

Featuring teams from several Residences on campus, it is believed that it is the first of its kind to take place at UNB. The tournament was won by Harrison House who chased a target of over 150 to beat McLeod by a margin of 1 wicket. All games, of innings comprising 10 overs, took place at Queen's Square Ball Field in Fredericton. The trophy is proudly displayed in the Harrison lounge. In 2007, UNBCC grew to almost 40 members making it arguably the biggest cricket club in the Atlantic Provinces. ===Fencing=== The UNB Fencing Club has been in operation since 1966, competing in the Atlantic Fencing League and the Canadian Fencing Federation. Teams from the club have captured the Alfred Knappe Trophy for Maritime Mixed weapon competition 7 times (1973, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1998, 2001 and 2013) as well as the Atlantic University Mixed Weapon Championship in 2009 (one of only two years it was run), defeating Memorial University for the title. ===Football=== The UNB Red Bombers football team first began play in 1948 in exhibition play before playing in the first intercollegiate Canadian football game played in New Brunswick in 1949. The program was in continuous operation until it was dropped after the 1980 season, with the school making the announcement in June 1981. In their history, the Red Bombers won two Jewett Trophy conference championships in 1969 and 1970, but lost in the following Atlantic Bowls to the McGill Redmen and Ottawa Gee-Gees respectively. In 2008, the University made the announcement that the Red Bombers were to be reborn in 2009 in the Atlantic Football League, along with University of New Brunswick Saint John, Dalhouse University, and Holland College. In 2009 (the inaugural season for the Atlantic Football League), the Red Bombers defeated the UNB SJ Seawolves to capture the first Moosehead Cup championship.
