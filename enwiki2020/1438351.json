He played college football at Texas A&M; University (1954\u20131956), where he was one of the \"Junction Boys\", and later served as the head coach at his alma mater from 1965 to 1971. Stallings was also the head coach of the St. Louis/Phoenix Cardinals of the National Football League (1986\u20131989) and at the University of Alabama (1990\u20131996). Stallings' 1992 Alabama team completed a 13\u20130 season with a win in the Sugar Bowl over Miami and was named the consensus national champion. Stallings was also a member of the Board of Regents of the Texas A&M; University System. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach on July 16, 2011. ==Early years and playing career== Stallings was born in Paris, Texas. He attended Paris High School, where he played end as a sophomore alongside future NFL star, Raymond Berry. During his junior and senior year, Stallings was the captain of the football, basketball, and golf teams. He was recruited to Texas A&M; University to play college football by then-head coach Raymond George. At Texas A&M;, Stallings was a member of the famed Junction Boys under head coach Bear Bryant. In 1956, he helped the team finish 9\u20130\u20131 and capture its first Southwest Conference championship since 1939. Stallings received his Bachelor of Physical Education degree from Texas A&M; in 1957. ==Coaching career== ===University of Alabama=== In 1958, Stallings joined Bear Bryant's original staff at the University of Alabama as a defensive assistant. He was on hand for two of Alabama's national championship seasons, in 1961 and 1964. ===Texas A&M; University=== Shortly after helping Alabama win the 1964 national title, Stallings was named the head coach of his alma mater, Texas A&M;, at the age of 29. He coached the Aggies for seven seasons compiling a record of 27\u201345\u20131. During his tenure, the Aggies won the Southwest Conference in 1967, Stallings' only winning season at A&M.; At the end of that season Stallings led Texas A&M; to a victory over Alabama and mentor Bear Bryant in the Cotton Bowl. With the university only recently going co-ed, its military focus and the ongoing war in Vietnam, A&M; struggled to recruit against its Southwest Conference rivals. He was fired at A&M; following the 1971 season. ===Dallas Cowboys=== In 1972, Stallings joined the staff of the Dallas Cowboys as Tom Landry's secondary coach. He remained with the Cowboys for 14 seasons, and helped them win Super Bowl XII. ===St. Louis / Phoenix Cardinals=== In 1986, Stallings was named the head coach of the St. Louis Cardinals. In parts of four seasons, Stallings compiled a 23\u201334\u20131 record with the Cardinals and was the head coach during the franchise's move to Arizona. In 1987, the franchise's final season in St. Louis, the Cardinals rallied from a 28\u20133 deficit at the start of the fourth quarter to defeat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 31\u201328, the largest fourth quarter comeback in NFL history. The Cardinals used the comeback to springboard themselves into position to clinch a playoff berth on the final Sunday of the season, but fell short with a 21\u201316 loss at Dallas. The Cardinals' relocation from St. Louis to Arizona was approved on March 15, 1988. In 1988, the Cardinals pulled off another miracle comeback, rallying from a 23\u20130 deficit against the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers for a 24\u201323 victory. Phoenix was 7\u20134 and in first place in the NFC East but collapsed, losing their final five games, including two to the division champion Philadelphia Eagles. The 1989 season started with road victories at Detroit and Seattle, but injuries derailed any playoff hopes. With five games remaining in the 1989 season, Stallings announced that he would resign at the end of the season. Instead, general manager Larry Wilson ordered Stallings to leave immediately and named running backs coach Hank Kuhlmann as his temporary replacement. The Cardinals lost all five games under Kuhlmann and finished 5\u201311, the first of four consecutive seasons in which the team would lose at least 11 games. ===University of Alabama=== Stallings returned to Alabama as head coach in 1990. His first team finished with a 7\u20135 record, including a 34\u20137 loss to Louisville in the 1991 Fiesta Bowl. Following Harold Drew, Stallings became only the second Alabama head coach since the renewal of the Iron Bowl in 1948 to defeat Auburn in his first attempt; Dennis Franchione became the third in 2001. Stallings' 1991 squad finished the season with an 11\u20131 record, including a 30\u201325 victory over Colorado in the 1991 Blockbuster Bowl. In 1992, Stallings' experienced defensive unit led the team to an undefeated regular season and a berth in the first SEC Championship Game where Alabama defeated Florida, 28\u201321, giving Alabama its 20th Southeastern Conference (SEC) title, and its first outright conference title since 1979. Following a 34\u201313 victory over heavily favored Miami in the 1993 Sugar Bowl to cap a perfect 13\u20130 season and the first Bowl Coalition national championship\u2014their first national title since 1979. It was during this early period at Alabama that Stallings coached wide receiver and future Clemson Head Coach, Dabo Swinney. In 1993, Stallings' squad won a second straight SEC West Division title, compiling a 9\u20133\u20131 record. However, the Tide lost to Florida in the SEC Championship Game. In 1994, Stallings' team finished the regular season with a record of 11\u20130, an 8\u20130 record in the SEC, and captured its third straight SEC West Division title. However, they lost the SEC title game for the second year in a row to Florida. Alabama finished the 1994 season with a 12\u20131 record, including a 24\u201317 victory over Ohio State in the Citrus Bowl. After an investigation that ran from late 1993 to August 1995, the NCAA found Alabama guilty of four major rules violations during the 1993 season. Stallings was implicated, along with athletic director Hootie Ingram, in falsifying the eligibility of Alabama cornerback Antonio Langham during that season. Langham had signed with a sports agent and applied to enter the NFL Draft following the 1993 Sugar Bowl, but was not subsequently declared ineligible per NCAA rules. Alabama officials only declared him ineligible the week before the 1993 SEC title game. As a result, Alabama's football program was placed on three years probation, and docked a total of 30 scholarships from 1995 to 1998. Alabama was also forced to forfeit eight wins and one tie from its 9\u20133\u20131 1993 season in which Langham participated, resulting in an official record of 1\u201312. The Crimson Tide were also barred from postseason competition, including the SEC Championship Game and bowl games, during the 1995 season. Alabama went 8\u20133 in 1995, the only season between 1992 and 1996 that Stallings didn't win the SEC West (Auburn finished first in the division in 1993 but was serving a post-season ban). Arkansas won the West title in 1995, with a last second touchdown against the Tide to claim their first ever victory over Alabama. However, the Tide would have been ineligible for the SEC Championship Game or a bowl game regardless as a result of the NCAA sanctions. In 1996, Stallings' team won ten games and earned a berth in the SEC Championship Game, where they lost again to Florida, which eventually won the national title that season. Stallings announced on November 23, 1996 that he would resign at the end of the season. He completed his tenure at Alabama with a 17\u201314 win over Michigan in the 1997 Outback Bowl on January 1, 1997. Stallings compiled an official record at Alabama of 62\u201325 (70\u201316\u20131 if the 1993 forfeits are disregarded). The lost scholarships as a result of the 1995 infractions case, however, would hobble the Tide for several years to come; they would only win eight or more games three times between Stallings' departure and Nick Saban's arrival in 2007, and would also suffer four of its only five losing seasons since Bryant's arrival.Millson, Charlie.
