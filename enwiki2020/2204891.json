    "text": "Sullivan Ballou (March 28, 1829July 29, 1861) was a lawyer and politician from Rhode Island, and an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He is remembered for an eloquent letter he wrote to his wife Sarah, one week before he was killed in the First Battle of Bull Run. ==Early life== Ballou was born the son of Hiram (1802\u20131833) and Emeline (Bowen) Ballou, a distinguished Huguenot family in Smithfield, Rhode Island. He lost his father at a young age. In spite of this, he attended boarding school at Nichols Academy in Dudley, Massachusetts and Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. After graduation from Phillips, he attended Brown University, where he was a member of Delta Phi, and went on to study law at the National Law School, in Ballston, New York. He was admitted to the bar in Rhode Island and began practice in 1853. Ballou married Sarah Hart Shumway on October 15, 1855. They had two sons, Edgar and William.\"Dispatch Delayed\", Washington Post, July 8, 2001. Transcribed at bessel.org. Accessed October 20, 2006. Ballou was active in public affairs. In 1854, soon after beginning his law practice, he was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He was chosen as Clerk of the House, and later as the Speaker. He was a staunch Republican and supporter of Abraham Lincoln.The Sullivan Ballou letter. (2002) ==Civil War== After the bombardment of Fort Sumter in April 1861, President Lincoln called on the states to provide 75,000 militia troops to put down the rebellion. Ballou promptly volunteered, and encouraged others to do so as well. He was commissioned a major in the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry Regiment.Combined Military Service Record He was third in command of the Regiment, after Colonel John Slocum and Lieutenant Colonel Frank Wheaton. He was also appointed judge advocate of the Rhode Island militia. The 2nd Rhode Island soon moved to Washington, and joined the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia. On July 21, 1861 the regiment took part in the First Battle of Bull Run. As a senior officer, Ballou went in front on horseback to better direct his men. He was hit by a cannonball from a Confederate six-pounder cannon, which tore off part of his right leg and killed his horse. He was carried off the field, and the remainder of his leg was amputated. The Union Army was defeated and retreated to Washington, and Ballou was left behind. Ballou died from his wound a week after the battle, and was buried in the graveyard of nearby Sudley Church. He was one of 94 men of the 2nd Rhode Island killed or mortally wounded at Bull Run. He was 32 at the time of his death; his wife Sarah was 24. The battle area was occupied by Confederate forces, and Ballou's body was allegedly exhumed, decapitated, and further desecrated by Confederate troops (though most historians attribute this story to Northern wartime propaganda); his body was never recovered. In place of his body, charred ash and bone believed to be his remains were reburied in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence. Sarah remained a widow and never remarried. She later moved to New Jersey to live with her son, William. She died at age 82 in 1917; her remains are buried beside her husband's. ==Letter to Sarah Ballou== In his now famous letter to his wife, Ballou endeavored to express the emotions he was feeling: worry, fear, guilt, sadness, and the pull between his love for her and his sense of duty to the nation. The letter was featured prominently in the Ken Burns documentary The Civil War, where a shortened version of it was paired with Jay Ungar's musical piece \"Ashokan Farewell\" and read by Paul Roebling. The documentary excluded many of Ballou's personal references to his family and his upbringing. The letter may never have been mailed; it was found in Ballou's trunk after he died.Brown University in the Civil War. A Memorial. Providence Press Company: Providence, 1868. . It was reclaimed and delivered to Ballou's widow by Governor William Sprague, either after Sprague had traveled to Virginia to reclaim the effects of dead Rhode Island soldiers, or from Camp Sprague in Washington, D.C. ==References== https://www.nps.gov/resources/story.htm%3Fid%3D253 ==External links== *PBS: The Civil War * *Text of the letter set to music by John Kander, sung by soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming *World of Warcraft: Sully Balloo's Letter Category:American letter writers Category:Union Army officers Category:Union military personnel killed in the American Civil War Category:People of Rhode Island in the American Civil War Category:Speakers of the Rhode Island House of Representatives Category:Members of the Rhode Island House of Representatives Category:Rhode Island Republicans Category:Rhode Island lawyers Category:State and National Law School alumni Category:Brown University alumni Category:Nichols College alumni Category:Phillips Academy alumni Category:People from Providence County, Rhode Island Category:Burials at Swan Point Cemetery Category:1829 births Category:1861 deaths Category:19th-century American politicians Category:19th-century American lawyers ",
