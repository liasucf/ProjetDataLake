    "text": "Phyllanthus reticulatus is a plant species described Jean Louis Marie Poiret; it is included in the family Phyllanthaceae. This is an Asian species of Phyllanthus (but it was also introduced to Jamaica); it has been confused with P. polyspermus.Luo, S.X., H.-J. Esser, D. Zhang, and S. S. Renner. 2011. Nuclear ITS sequences help disentangle Phyllanthus reticulatus (Phyllanthaceae), an Asian species not occurring in Africa, but introduced to Jamaica. Systematic Botany 36(1): 99-104. In Vietnamese its name is ph\u00e8n \u0111en (sometimes di\u1ec7p h\u1ea1 ch\u00e2u m\u1ea1ng). Phyllanthus reticulatus is pollinated by several different species of Epicephala in East Asia. The adult moths pollinate the flowers but lay eggs in the P. reticulatus flowers' ovaries, where the emerging larvae consume some of the developing seeds.Kawakita, A.; Kato, M. 2009. \"Repeated independent evolution of obligate pollination mutualism in the Phyllantheae-Epicephala association.\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B. 276: 417\u2013426. ==Subspecies== The following subspecies are listed in the Catalogue of Life: * Phyllanthus reticulatus var. glaber (Thwaites) M\u00fcll.Arg. * P. r. reticulatus (see synonyms) ==Description== Phyllanthus reticulatus is a shrub, sometimes partially scrambling and usually only up to 5 m high, with light reddish-brown or grey-brown with hairy stems when young, which become smooth with age.
