The GSSI supports new mega projects, encouraging their development to have an environmentally friendly focus, through environment policy and directive guidelines. GSSI has commenced establishing a think tank that will be at the forefront of the implementation of renewable energy in the Middle East. One of the GSSI's current projects is to build the first Saudi Arabian solar farm and factory on a plot outside of Riyadh. This project will be twice the size of the Masdar Environmental City being built in Abu Dhabi. Faisal's concern for the environment was borne from both extensive academic research and a greater understanding of the importance of Saudi Arabia in the future of renewable energy.
