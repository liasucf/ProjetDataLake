Lee Mandelo at Tor.com, noting the book is \"Monete's first general short fiction collection,\" calls it \"a strong book, achieving the necessary blance between variety and unity that single-author collections often strive for but fail to manage.\" She characterizes its contents as \"ranging from science fiction to classic horror to urban fantasy (with trains!), spanning an emotional gamut from the desolate to the uplifting, often united by their focus on people who have been othered or made outsiders in their society. ... Issues of gender, sexuality, class, and able-ness permeate Monette's short fiction; trauma and recovery, too, are common themes.\" She calls the stories \"concise, tightly-woven universes, evocative and complete in their storytelling as well as their emotional resonance. Whether the subject is Lovecraftian urban fantasy, parodic science fiction, or classic horror, Monette's prose is precise and vividly complex, often poetic.\" \"Letter from a Teddy Bear on Veteran's Day,\" \"The Watcher in the Corners,\" \"Three Letters from the Queen of Elfland,\" \"Somewhere Beneath Those Waves was Her Home,\" and \"After the Dragon\" are cited as \"five stories in particular which stand out from the rest, though all are remarkably good.\" The collection was also reviewed by Faren Miller in Locus #613, February 2012. ==References== Category:2011 short story collections Category:Fantasy short story collections Category:Science fiction short story collections Category:Horror short story collections ",
