The Christian Democratic Union emerged as the largest party. ==Campaign== Federal Chancellor Adenauer (who was also the Christian Democratic leader) campaigned on his policies of economic reconstruction and growth, moderate conservatism or Christian democracy, and close relations with the United States. The new Social Democratic leader \u2013 Kurt Schumacher had died in 1952 \u2013 was Erich Ollenhauer, who was more moderate in his policies than Schumacher had been. He did not oppose, in principle, the United States' military presence in Western Europe. In fact, he later \u2013 in 1957 \u2013 supported a military alliance of most European countries, including Germany.Erling Bj\u00f6l, Grimberg's History of the Nations, volume 23: The Rich West, \"A Giant Dwarf: West Germany,\" Helsinki: WSOY, 1985Dennis L.
