During the first days of 1943, aged 18, he joined the Resistance against the German/Italian occupation. First, he joined the team of Nikiforos in the Greek People\u2019s Liberation Army (ELAS) and subsequently \u201cForce 133\u201d, an allied military unit operating in occupied Greece, which was a party of the British \u201cSpecial Operation Executive\u201d (SOE). In June 1944, following orders by the Middle East Allied Command, he escaped from Greece together with two British officers \u2013 McIntyre, Bob Morton - and reached Cairo. He was honored for his bravery during the war by King George VI with the \u201cKing\u2019s Medal for Courage\u201d (KMC) of the British Empire and with a Certificate of Commendation by the British Field Marshall Lord Alexander. He returned these distinctions, in protest as being devoid of any value, to Charles Peake, British Ambassador in Athens, on May 10th 1956, the same day that the Cypriot, freedom fighters of EOKA Karaolis and Dimitriou were executed in Nicosia. He was trained as a fighter pilot by the British RAF. Subsequently he joined the Royal Hellenic Air Force and served until 1947. He was employed by the Greek air carrier TAE, which became Olympic Airways (OA), when Aristotle Onassis (ASO) acquired the company in 1957. At OA he served, successively, as Chief Instructor, Chief Pilot, Flight Operations Director and finally as Director General until December 1974. In his will, ASO appointed him a lifetime member of the Board of Directors (BOD) of the \u201cOnassis Foundation\u201d, established in December 1975. He continued to fly with OA until February 1984 when he retired. He logged more than 22.500 hours as Captain and Instructor. For a period of 12 years, he was also flying the Royal Family as Captain on Olympic and VIP aircraft of the Greek Air Force. Since the beginning of his career, he dealt with the most crucial part of aviation, \u201cFlight Safety\u201d. It was well known and verified since the mid 50s that \u201cthe Weakness of the Human Element\u201d leads to \u201chuman error\u201d, which is the main cause of all accidents in the field of transportation (land-sea-air), as well as in all other fields that a human being is involved.Paul J. Ioannidis, The Human Factor, Surveyor, Quarterly Publication of the American Beureau of Shipping, September 1996, pages 6-7. This weakness was successfully dealt with in the field of air transportation by implementing: rigorous recurrent training, use of simulators and checklists, standard procedures/ regulations, in a spirit of teamwork, coordination, right mentality and self-discipline. The so-called \u201cAirline Concept\u201d Having acquired a thorough knowledge of aviation philosophy and extensive experience as a flight instructor, and after a 4-year preparation, he implemented successfully in 1982 the \u201cAirline Concept\u201d to the Onassis fleet. Thus, the Onassis Group became a world pioneer in its effort to further improve effectively the safety of the: ship, crew, cargo and sea environment. During the period 1975\u20131984 he was also involved with the business activities of the Onassis Foundation. He eventually undertook the duties of Chief Executive Officer of Shipping and Commercial Operations (CEO), an office held until 1995. He served also as Vice President of both Foundations \u2013 commercial and public benefit \u2013 until 2005. He served as Chairman of the BOD of all companies owned by Christina Onassis and was one of the executors of her will. He held the following offices and awarded the following distinctions: \\- Member of the BOD of the Greek Shipowners\u2019 Union for 26 years (1979\u20132005), Vice-President for 6 years, President of its Training Committee for 14 years.
