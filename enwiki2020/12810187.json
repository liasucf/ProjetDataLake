Penclawdd Rugby Club officially formed in 1888, but rugby has been played in the village since 1880\u201381, the same year as the founding of the Welsh Rugby Union. In its formative years the club had no permanent pitch, but played on suitable available ground in various areas of the village. It initially used the Dunraven Field, later Cae Dono (Dono's field) on top of the Graig, and during the years preceding the First World War, a field at Graig-y-Coed was favoured. During the 1906-06 season Penclawdd were unsuccessful in its application to join the WRU. The club was disbanded during the First World War years but re-formed once the war ended. In 1922 the club obtained its own pitch for the first time. It leased the Welfare ground known as the Rec., situated at the foot of the Graig, behind the Tabernacle Chapel. A pavilion was built on the land for the use of the Penclawdd Rugby and Cricket Clubs. In 1927 Penclawdd received Welsh Rugby Union membership, twenty two years after its initial application. The 1946\u201347 season saw the establishment of the Penclawdd Rugby Youth. == Club badge == The club badge is a shield divided into quarters. Each quarter contains an image associated with the area.
