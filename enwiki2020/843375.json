The municipalities which were no longer independent at that time did not receive coat of arms - Brockhausen was incorporated into Deilinghofen; Landhausen, Sundwig and Westig were incorporated into Hemer; Calle was split between Iserlohn and Hemer. L\u00f6ssel had left the Amt in 1920 already, and thus did not receive a coat of arms at that time either. All of the coat of arms expired when the Amt was dissolved in 1975, only the coat of arms of Evingsen expired already in 1969 when Evingsen was incorporated into Altena. Even though the coat of arms are no longer used officially, the communities in the former municipalities continue to use them unofficially.
