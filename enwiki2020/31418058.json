    "text": "Ryan Gobbe (born 1980) is an Australian electronic musician who records under the names Mieli and Twotone. Ryan Gobbe studied Music Production at the Southern Cross University and graduated in 2000. ==Mieli== Mieli's music has a downtempo quality, and features traditional synthesis mixed with \"clicks and cuts\" -type sounds. Texturally, the music is varied, with both sparse ambient- type songs, and other more complex and gradual musical layering. Further characteristics are throbbing bass and crackle of [songs such as] \"Fly-over\" and shuffling gentle house tones of \"Eighty-hour Sequence\".Luna Kafe album review Further description of the music has been made as fluttering and beautifully intricate, shimmering minimal electronics with a deep dub pulse that will delight fans of the likes of Pole, Vladislav Delay and Mille Plateaux.In The Mix album review Mieli's debut album Version was released in 2004 by Australian independent record label Feral Media. It received generally favourable reviews and relatively significant attention with coverage on national radio stationsTriple J playlist August 2006 such as Triple J. ==Twotone== The music of Twotone features regular techno conventions, such as a regular kick drum and snare beat, but these sounds are augmented by irregular rhythmic placements and supplemental click and cut sounds. Traditional synthesis methods and sounds are often employed, often repeating a simple chord pattern. Other featured sounds are vocal snippets and occasional industrial samples. Twotone's debut album Cinecity was released in 2004 by the Australian independent record label Bug Records. It received favourable reviews, with some praise describing it as an \"impeccably produced collection\".Cyclic Defrost review by Alex ollo Other comments made on the music have been less positive, with comments such as the \"while \u2018Cinecity\u2019 does not really re-invent the minimal-techno wheel, that\u2019s less important here than the sense of warmth and widescreen atmosphere that permeates through all of the tracks\".In The Mix album review ==References== ==External links== * Artist profile at Australian Music Online * Record Label profile page * Artist profile at last.fm Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Australian electronic musicians Category:Southern Cross University alumni ",
