Truman Lunch boxes Insulated thermal bag with ice packs A lunch box (alt. spelling lunchbox) refers to a hand-held container used to transport food, usually to work or to school. It is commonly made of metal or plastic, is reasonably airtight and often has a handle for carrying. ==In the United States== In the United States a lunchbox may also be termed a lunch pail, lunch bucket or lunch tin, either as single words or paired. The concept of a food container has existed for a long time, but it was not until people began using tobacco tins to carry meals in the early 20th century, followed by the use of lithographed images on metal, that the containers became a staple of youth, and a marketable product. It has most often been used by schoolchildren to take packed lunches, or a snack, from home to school. The most common modern form is a small case with a clasp and handle, often printed with a colorful image that can either be generic or based on children's television shows or films. Use of lithographed metal to produce lunch boxes in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s gave way in the 1990s to use of injection-molded plastic. A lunch kit comprises the actual \"box\" and a matching vacuum bottle. However, popular culture has more often embraced the singular term lunch box, which is now most commonly used. With increasing industrialization resulting in Americans working outside the home in factories, it became unfeasible to go home to lunch every day, thus it was necessary to have something to protect and transport a meal. Since the 19th century, American industrial workers have used sturdy containers to hold hardy lunches, consisting of foods such as hard-boiled eggs, vegetables, meat, coffee, and pie.Smithsonian National Museum of American History, Taking America to Lunch, museum exhibition, 2004-present (as of June 3, 2013). http://americanhistory.si.edu/lunchboxes/, Retrieved June 3, 2013. David Shayt, curator of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, states that \"Some of our earliest examples, from the 19th century, were woven baskets with handles. A meal would be wrapped in a handkerchief. Depending on your station, a fancy wooden box would be used by the wealthy.\" Tinplate boxes and recycled biscuit tins commonly were used in the early 1800s, and fitted metal pails and boxes began to appear around the 1850s. Patents started to appear for lunchbox inventions in the 1860s. The Thermos, a vacuum flask adapted for lunch box use, was introduced in 1904.Thermos, L.L.C., \"Our History\", Promotional Material, 2011. , Retrieved June 3, 2013. The Thermos, which enabled hot or cold beverages to remain at optimal temperature until lunchtime, became a common component of the lunch box. The American Thermos Bottle Co. of Norwich, CT, later named King Seeley Thermos or KST, \"produced the first metal lunch box for kids in 1920\" as a \"vehicle for their vacuum bottles.\" ===Decorated=== The first lunch box decorated with a famous licensed character was introduced in 1935. Produced by Geuder, Paeschke & Frey, it featured Mickey Mouse, and was a four-color lithographed oval tin, with a pull-out tray inside. It had no vacuum bottle, but did have a handle. In 1950, Aladdin Industries created the first children's lunch box based on a television show, Hopalong Cassidy. The Hopalong Cassidy lunch kit, or \"Hoppy\", quickly became Aladdin\u2019s cash cow. Debuting in time for back-to-school 1950, it would go on to sell 600,000 units in its first year alone, each at 2.39. In 1953, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans' were featured on models introduced by American Thermos. More than 450 decorated models quickly followed, and more than 120 million metal lunch boxes were sold between 1950 and 1970, often accompanied by a Thermos, initially made of metal and glass, and later plastic. Lunch boxes have been manufactured using various materials. Typically, children's school lunch boxes are made of plastic or vinyl, while adult workers' lunch boxes are commonly made of metal, such as tin or aluminium, due to the greater need for durability. The aluminium variant was invented in 1954 by Leo May, a miner in Sudbury, Ontario, after he accidentally crushed his tin lunch box.\"Out to lunch\". Sudbury Mining Solutions Journal, December 2008. Manufacturers grew to include ADCO Liberty, Kruger Manufacturing Company, Landers, Frary and Clark (Universal), Okay Industries, and a number of other producers through the 1980s. The first use of plastics was the lunch box handle, but later spread to the entire box, with the first molded plastic boxes produced during the 1960s. Vinyl lunch boxes debuted in 1959. During the 1960s, the lunch box had few changes. The vacuum bottle included in them, however, steadily evolved during the course of the decade and into the 1970s. What was originally a steel vacuum bottle with glass liner, cork or rubber stopper, and bakelite cup became an all-plastic bottle, with insulated foam rather than vacuum. Aladdin produced glass liners into the 1970s, but they were soon replaced with plastic. ===School safety=== Beginning in Florida during \"the Seventies\" with the lobbying of parents in Florida who claimed the metal boxes were being used as weapons in fights, many schools in the United States banned metal lunch boxes. \"The last metal lunch box ... was the 1985 Rambo. ===Health issues=== Health concerns came to light in August 2002, when the Center for Environmental Health discovered that many popular vinyl lunch boxes contained dangerously high levels of lead. Many, though not all, were pulled from the shelves. In 2001, most major manufacturers began testing their lunch boxes for lead levels, remedied the issue, and labeled their boxes as lead free. ===Today=== Today, lunch boxes are generally made of plastic, with foam insulation, and an aluminium/vinyl interior. As a result, they are usually much better at retaining their temperature but are less rigid/protective. However, metal lunch boxes are still produced, just not as popular as they were in the 1960 through 1980's. ===Collecting=== Some lunch boxes, including those from the 1950s and 1960s, sometimes sell into the thousands of dollars. In 1999, a \"1954 Superman lunch box, made by Adco Liberty\" was \"gaveled down for $11,500\" (\"the hightest auction price ever paid for a lunch box\"). ===In popular culture=== * A Superman DVD set was released in a case resembling a tin lunch box, albeit notably smaller. * A Nintendo DS starter kit was released in a case resembling a tin lunch box with New Super Mario Bros. graphics. * The collector's edition of Fallout 3 was made available in a metal Vault-Tec lunch box, the likes of which can be found throughout the game world itself. * The Lunchbox movie. ===Political symbolism=== In the United States, the lunch box or lunch pail has been used as a symbol of the working class. The phrase \"lunch pail Democrat\" is used to classify populist politicians who attempt to gain the votes of the working class. The New York Times printed in 2008 that Joe Biden is a lunch-bucket Democrat. While his father had been wealthy early in life, by the time Biden was born, the family was broke. ==Outside the United States== Japan has a tradition of bento, individual portable meals, that dates back several centuries and influenced other countries in South East Asia. Bento generally consists of rice and a number of other food items, transported within a lunchbox that has compartments to keep each item separate. In Mumbai, India, there are extensive lunchbox delivery services, continuing a business model that originated in 1890, where delivery staff called dabawallas pick up metal tiffin carrier lunchboxes containing freshly cooked food, usually from the recipient's home, deliver them to people at their place of work and return empty lunchboxes. In some South American countries, a lunch box is called \"lonchera\", especially among school children, in clear assimilation of the English word \"lunch\". ==See also== * Bento \u2013 Japan * Dosirak \u2013 Korea * Tiffin carrier \u2013 India ==References== == External links == * History of Lunchboxes, Retrieved June 4, 2013.
