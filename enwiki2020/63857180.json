Several related species, such as Eriospermum capense, Eriospermum breviscapum and Eriospermum zeyheri, have a similar heart-shaped leaf. The tuber is irregular shaped, with reddish-purple flesh, and the plants can offset and form clusters. This species flowers from February to April. ==Distribution and habitat== Eriospermum pubescens occurs in renosterveld vegetation, in clay- rich soils across the southern Cape, South Africa. It occurs from Ceres in the north, southwards to Somerset West, and eastwards as far as Knysna.Perry, P.L. (1994) A Revision of the Genus Eriospermum (Eriospermaceae).
