    "text": "A non-contact force is a force which acts on an object without coming physically in contact with it. The most familiar non-contact force is gravity, which confers weight. In contrast a contact force is a force applied to a body by another body that is in contact with it. All four known fundamental interactions are non-contact forces: * Gravity, the force of attraction that exists among all bodies that have mass. The force exerted on each bo the distance between them. * Electromagnetism is the force that causes the interaction between electrically charged particles; the areas in which this happens are called electromagnetic fields. Examples of this force include: electricity, magnetism, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, X-rays and gamma rays. Electromagnetism mediates all chemical, biological, electrical and electronic processes. * Strong nuclear force: Unlike gravity and electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force is a short distance force that takes place between fundamental particles within a nucleus. It is charge independent and acts equally between a proton and a proton, a neutron and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron. The strong nuclear force is the strongest force in nature; however, its range is small (acting only over distances of the order of 10\u221215 m). The strong nuclear force mediates both nuclear fission and fusion reactions. * Weak nuclear force: The weak nuclear force mediates the \u03b2 decay of a neutron, in which the neutron decays into a proton and in the process emits a \u03b2 particle and an uncharged particle called a neutrino. As a result of mediating the \u03b2 decay process, the weak nuclear force plays a key role in supernovas.
