Wesley Lyng Minor (born 1851) was an American architect in Massachusetts. Minor was born in Franklin, Louisiana in 1851, and moved north to New Bedford with his family at the age of seven. They later moved to Marion and Middleborough. He began studying architecture with a retired carpenter who taught at the Pierce Academy. Three years later he moved to Boston, where he worked for William R. Ware. After a few months he moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for John McArthur, Jr. A year later he went to New York City and worked for Richard Morris Hunt.\"Minor, Wesley Lyng\". Men of Progress: One Thousand Biographical Sketches and Portraits of Leaders in Business and Professional Life in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Ed. Edwin M. Bacon. 1896. In 1878 Minor established himself as an architect in Charleston, South Carolina. He also worked at Topeka, Denver, and Catlettsburg, never remaining long in any one place.\"W. L. Minor, architect\". Illustrated Boston, the Metropolis of New England. 1889. Around 1880 he moved back to New Bedford. In 1882 he formed a partnership with an unidentified New York architect, and agreed to open a Newport office. Stopping in Brockton, he believed that that city offered more opportunities. His New York partner disagreed, and Minor stayed in Brockton alone. By 1889 the Brockton office was secondary, as Minor had moved his main one to Boston, though he continued to live in Brockton. He later moved to Baltimore, where he had family.Engineering News 25 May 1905: 198. Back in Boston, by 1914 he had formed a partnership with Max M. Kalman (Minor & Kalman) which lasted at least until 1916.mhc-macris.net. Massachusetts Historical Commission, n.d. Web. He appears to have remained in Boston for the rest of his career. In Brockton, he was a contemporary of Waldo V. Howard. ==Architectural Works== * Bixby Block, 106 Main St., Brockton, MA (1883) - Altered.>Benson, James E.
