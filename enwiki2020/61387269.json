    "text": "Professor Alison Todd is holder of 18 patents (as at July 2019), and a co- founder and chief scientific officer of SpeeDx. The company manufactures and sells tests for detecting infectious pathogens and identifying antibiotic resistance. The biomedical company, co-founded by Todd, develops diagnostic tools. Todd mentors younger scientists and entrepreneurs, as well as advocating for greater gender diversity in leaders in STEM. \u2018Nearly 60 per cent of medical science and health graduates are women, but we hold only 20 per cent of senior leadership positions in the field\u2019. == Career == Todd is the Chief Scientific Officer of SpeeDx, which is a molecular diagnostics company which she and Elisa Mokany started. Todd and Mokany have 18 patent families between them. They have brought 11 medical diagnostic tests for the management of clinical disease. Todd developed several novel molecular analytical technologies which have been used for basic research, preclinical/clinical drug development and in vitro diagnostics. Her expertise include nucleic acid chemistry, particularly target amplification and catalytic DNA technologies, and the biology of cancer and viral diseases. Prior to founding SpeeDx, Todd was a Senior Research Director at Johnson and Johnson Research Pty Limited, Sydney. Todd describes her work, \"We are proud of what we have created because we believe we are making a positive contribution to the welfare of patients around the world. As the old-timer of the pair, I will take the liberty of having the last word and sum up our relationship as a clear case of \u2018two heads are better than one\u2019. == Research == Todd describes her \"Eureka moment\", \"It all began when Elisa joined my group at Johnson & Johnson Research (JJR), we were already exploring ways to exploit DNAzymes (deoxyribozymes) for diagnostic applications. These fascinating molecules are simple, short, synthetic DNA sequences (oligonucleotides) that can catalyse reactions in a manner analogous to protein enzymes. Although catalytic RNA (ribozymes) had been found in nature, catalytic DNA had not, and it had been assumed DNA would not have similar properties. However, a few years earlier, undeterred by dogma, Jerry Joyce and co-workers at Scripps had conducted \u2018evolution in a test tube\u2019\". == Select publications == * Santoro, S., and Joyce, G.
