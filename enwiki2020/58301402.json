His business prospered and developed into a wholesaler. On 29 May 1856, it relocated to Copenhagen where Seidelin purchased the property at Amagertorv 11.

Seidelin was continued by his son David Seidelin, his son-in-law Emil Hjort and long-time employee P. C. Thamsen.

A new head office was completed at the corner of Skindergade and Niels Hemmingsens Gade in 1902. A new subsidiary, Augustinus & Hansen A/S, established a production of men's wear in rented premises at Laplandsgade 4 and later moved to Endrup. The company was converted into a limited company (aktieselskab) in 1919. Inger Hjort (born 13 January 1890), Emil Hjort's daughter, was chairman of the board. The other board members were J\u00f8rgen Klerk (born 1885) and Frantz Dragsted (born 1890). ==Legacy== Pressens Hus S. Seidelin's former head office is now home to the Danish Media Association.
