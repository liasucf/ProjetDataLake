    "text": "', provisional designation , is an inclined Neptune trojan that shares Neptune's orbit in the Lagrangian point. It was discovered on 4 November 2007, by astronomers Andrew Becker, Andrew Puckett and Jeremy Kubica at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United State, although images from 2005 have also been recovered. It measures approximately 160 kilometers in diameter and was the sixth Neptune trojan to be discovered. , it is 34.1 AU from Neptune.2007 VL305 at JPL Horizons Change \"Observer Location\" to @Neptune == Orbit and classification == Neptune trojans can be considered resonant trans- Neptunian objects in a 1:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Neptune. These trojans have a semi-major axis and an orbital period very similar to Neptune's (30.10 AU; 164.8 years). belongs to the leading group, which orbits 60\u00b0 ahead of Neptune's orbit. It orbits the Sun with a semi-major axis of 29.926 AU at a distance of 28.1\u201331.7 AU once every 163 years and 9 months (59,795 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 28\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. Its inclination is almost as high as that of . == Physical characteristics == === Diameter === The discoverers estimate that has a mean- diameter of 160 kilometers based on a magnitude of 22.2. Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, it measures approximately 110 kilometers in diameter using an absolute magnitude of 7.9 with an assumed albedo of 0.10. == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 18 May 2019 (). As of 2019, it has not been named. If named, it will follow the naming scheme already established with 385571 Otrera and 385695 Clete, which is to name these objects after figures related to the Amazons, an all-female warrior tribe that fought in the Trojan War on the side of the Trojans against the Greek. == References == == External links == * MPEC 2008-E44 : 2007 VL305 * AstDys-2 about * * 527604 Category:Discoveries by Andrew C.
