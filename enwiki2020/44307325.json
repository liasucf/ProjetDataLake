    "text": "QAL is an open source development project that aims to create a collection of libraries for mixing, moving, merging, substituting and transforming data;Sourceforge project page also in some cases, such as MongoDB, schemas. Sources and destinations include different database backends, file formats like `.csv`, XML and spreadsheets. Even untidy HTML web pages can be used as both a source and destination. For SQL/RDBMS backends, it has a database abstraction layer that supports basic connectivity to Postgres, MySQL / MariaDB, DB2, Oracle and MS SQL Server.Database backends It uses XML formats (the SQL schema is self-generated) for representation of queries, transformation and merging, making it all processable by scripts. With regards to SQL, QAL uses a subset of SQL featuresSQL features supported and data types,SQL data types which while obviously not complete however is sufficient for most usages. It is however easy to instead use backend-specific SQL when the queries do not have to be backend-agnostic. It is currently distributed as a Python Library (`.egg`)PyPi repository page and a Debian package file (`.deb`).Downloadable files It is related to the Optimal BPM (Business Process Management) project.Optimal BPM site The Optimal BPM SourceForge project used to be DAL/QAL. ==References== ==External links== * QAL Documentation and examples * API documentation Category:Python (programming language) libraries Category:Free software programmed in Python Category:Cross-platform free software ",
