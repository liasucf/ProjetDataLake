    "text": "Stanwell Moor is a village in the Borough of Spelthorne, approximately west of central London. Historically part of the county of Middlesex, it was transferred to Surrey in 1965. It is immediately east of the M25 London Orbital Motorway and south-west of Heathrow Airport Terminal 5. The River Colne runs to the west of Stanwell Moor and the village is in Colne Valley regional park. Stanwell Moor is distinct from Stanwell, approximately to the east, although it is part of the same ward and civil and ecclesiastical parishes. ==History and geography== The locality gained its main barrier from what had always been its village in the early 1960s, a dual carriageway and it hived off shortly after with the building of a community hall and establishment of its own residents' association. It is however, ecclesiastically, still strongly tied with Stanwell in the Church of England, its parish. Fewer than six of the original medieval buildings stand in the hamlet. Add to my bookshelf It sits on the part of the parish on strongly fertile, partly densely wooded, alluvial soil, whereas most of Stanwell was associated with the stony ground which makes up gravel deposits near to the surface of the soil, as throughout the area south of Heathrow Airport to the River Thames. ==Local government== The community is in the Stanwell North ward, as used by Spelthorne and for certain statistical purposes. Stanwell Moor is represented the Conservative's Kwasi Kwarteng on Surrey County Council. ==Amenities== A parade of shops is here, followed at one end by a pub. A further pub is by the Colne itself. Distributaries of the complex River Colne runs past Stanwell Moor where it forms a broad part of the Colne Valley regional park. Stanwell Moor is buffered from all other settlements. Its south is covered by the King George VI Reservoir after which is Staines upon Thames. South-west is the Wraysbury Reservoir.Grid square map Ordnance survey website ==Demography and housing== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+ 2011 Census Homes |- !Output area !!Detached !!Semi-detached!!Terraced!!Flats and apartments!!Caravans/temporary/mobile homes!!Shared between households |- |Stanwell Moor||94 || 184 || 187 || 78 || 1 || 6 |} The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Output area !!Population !!Households !!% Owned outright !!% Owned with a loan!!hectares |- |Stanwell Moor||1,371 || 550 || 25.5 || 47.5 || 263 |} The proportion of households in the settlement who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%.
