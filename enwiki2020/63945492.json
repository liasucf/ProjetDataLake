About 1864, in association with Freedom Hill, he took over a former piano and music business to create the firm of Gould & Hill, and afterwards maintained an organ and piano warehouse under his own name until 1881. He also played a leading part in the city's musical life, having founded the Mendelssohn Choir of Montreal in 1864. He managed this for the next thirty years and conducted there a repertoire largely of part songs and miscellaneous pieces.Carl Morey, Music in Canada: A Research and Information Guide, Routledge 2013, p.81 For several years he was also the vice-president of the Montreal Philharmonic Society and in 1892 he declined an invitation by some of Montreal's leading musicians to head a new conservatory.The Canadian Encyclopedia In addition Gould founded the semi-monthly Arcadia, a Journal devoted exclusively to Music, Art, and Literature, between May 1892 \u2013 March 1893, which was notable at this period for its cosmopolitan coverage.Le R\u00e9pertoire international de la presse musicale, \"Arcadia\".
