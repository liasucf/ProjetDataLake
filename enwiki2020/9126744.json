The album was released in the U.S. three weeks later, on 16 April 2007.

Starting from 19 June 2007, there was a debate amongst fans at several internet forums regarding Jarre's participation in creating them, or that he might have copied them in the album with too much ease.jarreforum.com BlaBlahCafe forum of Zoolook.nl Usage of these patterns is not illegal, as expressed in the user manual on page 13. Jarre's management Aero Productions responded on the matter on 28 June 2007 with a statement to the administrator of the then Jarre's \"official\" web forum, who posted the following message on:jarreforum.com Admin message 28-Jun-2007 > \"Jean Michel Jarre explained that he entered into a partnership with Roland > Japan last year, to collaborate with and contribute to demos, patterns and > presets for their future products. Jean Michel Jarre explained that the > Roland MC808 was one of these products, therefore it is not surprising that > certain elements of his new T\u00c9O & T\u00c9A album appear on the Roland MC-808, or > any other recent Roland product for that matter.\" However, the original statement from Jarre and Aero Productions has not been made public, nor has it been explicitly stated that Jarre is the sole creator of the patterns. Jarre was credited with a patch on another model of Roland that was released in the same year, the Roland SH-201,Roland december 2006 pressrelease but Jarre's name does not appear on Roland's list of patch creators for the MC-808,MC-808 betatest Tim H\u00fcfken (credited as \"artistic collaborator\" in the booklet of T\u00e9o & T\u00e9a) appears instead. On the other hand, Jarre himself is credited in the booklet of T\u00e9o & T\u00e9a for \"drums programming\" on the Roland MC-808. == Comment by Jarre on the album == In an interview by French Trax magazine in 2010, Jean Michel Jarre said T\u00e9o & T\u00e9a had been a mistake in his career: == References == == External links == * T\u00e9o & T\u00e9a at Discogs * T\u00e9o & T\u00e9a at JarreUK Category:2007 albums Category:Jean-Michel Jarre albums ",
