Since the late 2015, the cartoon is also shown on Comedy Central Poland. Several episodes were also dubbed in Russian as Na Rayonye (\u041d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435, Russian: 'On the hood'). Nearly all characters in the show, including the main protagonists, are voiced by Bartosz Walaszek himself. Several female voices are done by Monika Szcz\u0119k. ==Plot== The cartoon tells the story of a group of three lazy hooligans (Polish: dresiarze) from Warsaw \u2013 Spejson, Wojtas and Walo. All three are 20\u201330 years old, originate from poor, lower-class families, live in Warsaw's subdivision Groch\u00f3w and are fans of Legia. They usually spend their time sitting on benches or in Speluno club, drinking beer and smoking. Because of their rowdy nature they are at odds with law and other hooligans. The show sometimes makes references to or even features the real events and people such as the former President of Poland Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski or to YouTube personalities. == Characters== *Adrian \"Spejson\" Puchacki is one of the three main characters and the gang's muscles. A not-too bright enthusiast of gym and a die-hard fan of Legia who lives with his overbearing mother. Spejson is also the winner of two amateur MMA tournaments and a YouTube vlogger. He often quotes \"The Street Book\", which is a self-made code of the street people. He usually wears a light gray hoodie. *Wojciech \"Wojtas\" Puczyk is one of the three main characters and the gang's driver. He is the tallest and the most slender of the three. Wojtas usually wears a green hoodie and an orange waistcoat. He lives with his mother and sister named Jowita, which was revealed to be a prostitute known as the Hood Queen (original: Kr\u00f3lowa Dzielni), a fact he had been unaware of. Wojtas is also the main character of a spin-off show Wojtas szuka \u017cony (Wojtas seeks a wife), where he managed to win the main award - a village girl who is secretly pregnant - but escapes from the wedding after Spejson and Walo reveal this fact to him. Initially had an old FSO Polonez called \"Hornet\" due to its appearance, but after its destruction he bought an BMW E36, which shared the fate of Hornet in episode 209. In the Russian dub, his name is Vetal (\u0412\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c, a diminutive of Vitaly). *Waldemar \"Walo\" Walasik is one of the three main characters, the gang's brain and informal leader, ridiculed by outsiders for being very short. He has a tan skin and blonde-dyed hair, while his preferred clothing is a blue polyamide tracksuit. He works at a crook car repair shop and is the only one of the gang with a steady employment. In the Russian dub, his name is Vadya (\u0412\u0430\u0434\u044f, a diminutive of Vladimir or Vadim). *Bastian \"Rudy\" (Polish: Ginger) Obsztyfitykultykiewicz is the recurring foe of the gang, a red-haired maniacal squealer with rhotacism, who calls the police or the city guard to inform about any misdeeds, even his own. Unlike most of the characters, Ginger is a fan of Polonia Warsaw, one of Legia's rivals. In episode 188 due to an intrigue in which everyone acts according to the law, Ginger had no possibility to squeal and went mad and was later taken to an asylum. In episode 192 Ginger came out of the asylum and returned to squeal again. *Pawe\u0142 \"Cie\u015blak\" Ciesielski is the other foe of the gang and Spejson's rival. Just like Spejson, Cie\u015blak is a gym fan and a big hater of Polonia Warszawa. He usually spends time with Solaris, whom got pregnant and it was later revealed that he is her son's father, which resulted in their short marriage and their second child (a daughter). *Jowita \"Solaris\" Ciesielska is a plump prostitue and the squad's friend. Her nickname originates from her being a regular customer of sunrooms. She later gets pregnant with Cie\u015blak's child, After a brief marriage with Cie\u015blak, she gets pregnant once again in order to get a 500-Z\u0142oty baby bonus. *\u0141ysa (Polish: Bald) is Solaris' friend, also a prostitute. She speaks with a lisp and is a fan of Legia. *Gra\u017cyna Puchacka is Spejson's mother and the family breadwinner. Gra\u017cyna divorced Wiesio due to his alcoholism when Spejson was a child, but they have remarried and live together with their son. Her sister was also pregnant with Wiesio's child, so Gra\u017cyna has no contact with her. *Mr. Wiesio is an alcoholic handyman who gouges his customers. In episode 65 it was revealed that he is Spejson's father whom he didn't remember. He works with his son, however he is not fond of him, because he does repairs properly. Besides Spejson, Wiesio is also the father of the boy's cousin Aro, as he had a relationship with Gra\u017cyna's sister. *Wies\u0142aw Paleta is a 60-years-old neighbor of the characters. He has chronic flatulence which he blames on his wife Halina, who makes frikadellers for every dinner. He is a friend of Mr. Wiesio. *\u0141ukasz \"Ko\u0142acina\" Ko\u0142aci\u0144ski is an ex-convict, an acquaintance of the squad feared by everyone in the hood. He anonymously competed in the second amateur MMA tournament at Speluno, in which he defeated Cie\u015blak, but ultimately lost to Spejson. After that, the main trio stopped fearing him. ==External links== * SPInka Film Studio channel on YouTube ==References== Category:Polish adult animated comedy television series ",
