    "text": "On the night of 28 October 2014, at 22.00 the Republic of Macedonia government building was attacked with what is believed to have been two rocket propelled grenades (RPG), damaging the walls and roof of the building. No casualties were reported. It has been speculated that the event is linked to the then recent proclamation of the so-called \"Republic of Ilirida\". The same building was attacked by RPGs in 2007. The National Liberation Army (NLA), the militant organization that fought against the Macedonian government in the Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia (2001), claimed responsibly for the attack. In a press release published by Alsat M, an Albanian-language TV station in Macedonia, and signed by \"Commander Kushtrim\", the organization claimed that the \"Hasan Prishtina\" elite force hit the government building in a coordinated action. The organization claims it is \"discontented\" with the 2001 Ohrid Agreement peace plan. ==Aftermath== On 21 April 2015, a group of 40 armed men with NLA patches attacked the border police station at Goshince. The group tied the policemen and beat them, then stole the arms and communication devices; they stayed for a couple of hours, filming the event, and before they left for Kosovo, they issued this message through an interpreter: A shootout erupted during a police raid between police forces and an armed group identifying as the NLA occurred on 9 May 2015 in the northern town of Kumanovo. ==References== Category:Albanian nationalism in North Macedonia Category:Attacks in 2014 Category:2014 crimes in the Republic of Macedonia Category:Crime in North Macedonia Category:Albanian separatism Category:2010s in Skopje Category:Terrorist incidents in North Macedonia Category:Crime in Skopje Category:Attacks on government buildings and structures Category:October 2014 crimes Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2014 ",
