    "text": "Jiang Wei (202 \u2013 3 March 264), courtesy name Boyue, was a military general of the state of Shu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Born in Ji County (present-day Gangu County, Gansu), Jiang Wei started his career as a military officer in his native Tianshui Commandery, which was a territory of Wei. In 228, when Wei's rival state Shu launched an invasion led by Zhuge Liang, Jiang Wei was distrusted by Ma Zun, then administrator of Tianshui Commandery. As such, Jiang Wei had to defect to Shu. Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Shu, highly regarded Jiang Wei and appointed him as a general in Shu. After Zhuge Liang's death in 234, Jiang Wei continued serving as a military commander during the regencies Jiang Wan and Fei Yi, eventually rising to the highest military rank of General-In-Chief (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd) after Fei Yi\u2019s death in 253. Between 240 and 262, he continued Zhuge Liang's legacy of waging war against Wei by leading another 11 military campaigns. However, Jiang Wei\u2019s campaigns were relatively constrained in terms of both scale and duration due to Shu\u2019s limited resources and inadequate food supplies, as well as internal political faultlines. In 263, when Wei launched a massive invasion of Shu, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to resist the invaders at Tazhong, Yinping and Jiange, himself defending Jiange which was under Zhong Hui\u2019s attack. While Jiang Wei managed to temporarily stall Wei\u2019s main force led by Zhong Hui, Deng Ai, another military commander of Wei, took a shortcut via Yinping and showed up at Chengdu unexpectedly. Liu Shan surrendered to Deng Ai without putting up resistance and ordered Jiang Wei to surrender to the Wei general Zhong Hui; this event marked the end of Shu's existence. In the following year, Jiang Wei instigated Zhong Hui to launch a rebellion in Chengdu against the Wei regent Sima Zhao and hoped to use the opportunity to gain military power and restore Shu. However, some of Zhong Hui's officers were unwilling to participate in the rebellion and started a mutiny, killing Jiang Wei and Zhong Hui. ==Family background== Jiang Wei was from Ji County (\u5180\u7e23/\u517e\u7e23), Tianshui Commandery (\u5929\u6c34\u90e1), which is present-day Gangu County, Gansu.(\u59dc\u7dad\u5b57\u4f2f\u7d04\uff0c\u5929\u6c34\u517e\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. As his father died early, Jiang Wei grew up with his mother and was known for his interest in the writings of the Confucian scholar Zheng Xuan.(\u5c11\u5b64\uff0c\u8207\u6bcd\u5c45\u3002\u597d\u912d\u6c0f\u5b78\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. The Fu Zi recorded that Jiang Wei was a fame-seeking person with great ambitions. He also secretly raised a private militia.(\u5085\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u7dad\u70ba\u4eba\u597d\u7acb\u529f\u540d\uff0c\u9670\u990a\u6b7b\u58eb\uff0c\u4e0d\u8129\u5e03\u8863\u4e4b\u696d\u3002) Fu Zi annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. ==Early career in Wei== Jiang Wei began his career in his native Tianshui Commandery, which was a territory of the state of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. He started out as a clerk in charge of records and later became an assistant officer under the commandery administrator.(\u4ed5\u90e1\u4e0a\u8a08\u63be\uff0c\u5dde\u8f9f\u70ba\u5f9e\u4e8b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. After considering that his father died in service, the Wei government commissioned Jiang Wei as a zhonglang (\u4e2d\u90ce) and allowed him to participate in military affairs in Tianshui Commandery.(\u4ee5\u7236\u518f\u6614\u70ba\u90e1\u529f\u66f9\uff0c\u503c\u7f8c\u3001\u620e\u53db\u4e82\uff0c\u8eab\u885e\u90e1\u5c07\uff0c\u6c92\u65bc\u6230\u5834\uff0c\u8cdc\u7dad\u5b98\u4e2d\u90ce\uff0c\u53c3\u672c\u90e1\u8ecd\u4e8b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. ==Defection to Shu== ===Sanguozhi account=== In the spring of 228, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Wei's rival state Shu, launched the first of a series of military campaigns against Wei. He occupied Mount Qi (\u7941\u5c71; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu) and deployed his troops there in orderly formations. Three Wei-controlled commanderies \u2013 Nan'an (\u5357\u5b89; around present-day Longxi County, Gansu), Tianshui and Anding (\u5b89\u5b9a; around present-day Zhenyuan County, Gansu) \u2013 responded to the invasion by defecting to the Shu side. Jiang Wei's biography in the Sanguozhi recorded that at the time, Jiang Wei and his colleagues Liang Xu, Yin Shang and Liang Qian were out on an inspection tour with Ma Zun (\u99ac\u9075), the Administrator of Tianshui Commandery. When Ma Zun learnt of the Shu invasion and heard that many counties in Tianshui Commandery had defected to the enemy, he suspected that Jiang Wei and the others were going to betray him so he fled overnight and took shelter in Shanggui County (\u4e0a\u90bd\u7e23; within present-day Tianshui, Gansu).(\u5efa\u8208\u516d\u5e74\uff0c\u4e1e\u76f8\u8af8\u845b\u4eae\u8ecd\u5411\u7941\u5c71\uff0c\u6642\u5929\u6c34\u592a\u5b88\u9069\u51fa\u6848\u884c\uff0c\u7dad\u53ca\u529f\u66f9\u6881\u7dd2\u3001\u4e3b\u7c3f\u5c39\u8cde\u3001\u4e3b\u8a18\u6881\u8654\u7b49\u5f9e\u884c\u3002\u592a\u5b88\u805e\u8700\u8ecd\u5782\u81f3\uff0c\u800c\u8af8\u7e23\u97ff\u61c9\uff0c\u7591\u7dad\u7b49\u7686\u6709\u7570\u5fc3\uff0c\u65bc\u662f\u591c\u4ea1\u4fdd\u4e0a\u90bd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. By the time Jiang Wei and his colleagues realised that Ma Zun had abandoned them and fled on his own, they attempted to catch up with him but it was too late. They were denied entry when they showed up at Shanggui County, so Jiang Wei led them to his home county, Ji County (\u5180\u7e23/\u517e\u7e23; present-day Gangu County, Gansu). However, the official in charge of Ji County also refused to allow them to enter. Faced with no other choice, Jiang Wei and his colleagues surrendered and defected to Shu.(\u7dad\u7b49\u89ba\u592a\u5b88\u53bb\uff0c\u8ffd\u9072\uff0c\u81f3\u57ce\u9580\uff0c\u57ce\u9580\u5df2\u9589\uff0c\u4e0d\u7d0d\u3002\u7dad\u7b49\u76f8\u7387\u9084\u517e\uff0c\u517e\u4ea6\u4e0d\u5165\u7dad\u3002\u7dad\u7b49\u4e43\u4ff1\u8a63\u8af8\u845b\u4eae\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. ===Alternative account in the Weil\u00fce=== The Weil\u00fce recorded a different account of Jiang Wei's defection from Wei to Shu. At the time of the Shu invasion, Ma Zun and his subordinates (including Jiang Wei) were on an inspection tour with the Wei general Guo Huai when they received news that Zhuge Liang and the Shu army had occupied Mount Qi. After telling Ma Zun that Zhuge Liang was \"up to no good\", Guo Huai wanted to quickly head back to Shanggui County in the east of Tianshui Commandery. Even though his headquarters was at Ji County in the west, Ma Zun did not want to go back because he feared that there would be unrest in Ji County in light of the Shu invasion. He decided to join Guo Huai and move to Shanggui County instead.(\u9b4f\u7565\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u6c34\u592a\u5b88\u99ac\u9075\u5c07\u7dad\u53ca\u8af8\u5b98\u5c6c\u96a8\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u90ed\u6dee\u5076\u81ea\u897f\u81f3\u6d1b\u9580\u6848\u884c\uff0c\u6703\u805e\u4eae\u5df2\u5230\u7941\u5c71\uff0c\u6dee\u9867\u9075\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u662f\u6b32\u4e0d\u5584\uff01\u300d\u9042\u9a45\u6771\u9084\u4e0a\u90bd\u3002\u9075\u5ff5\u6240\u6cbb\u517e\u7e23\u754c\u5728\u897f\u504f\uff0c\u53c8\u6050\u540f\u6c11\u6a02\u4e82\uff0c\u9042\u4ea6\u96a8\u6dee\u53bb\u3002) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. When Jiang Wei urged Ma Zun to return to Ji County, the latter told him and the others: \"If you go back, then you will become my enemy.\" Jiang Wei ignored Ma Zun because he was worried about the safety of his family in Ji County, so he parted ways with Ma Zun and returned to Ji County with his colleague Shangguan Zixiu (\u4e0a\u5b98\u5b50\u8129) and others.(\u6642\u7dad\u8b02\u9075\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u660e\u5e9c\u7576\u9084\u517e\u3002\u300d\u9075\u8b02\u7dad\u7b49\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u537f\u8af8\u4eba[\u56de]\u5fa9\u4fe1\uff0c\u7686\u8cca\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u5404\u81ea\u884c\u3002\u7dad\u4ea6\u7121\u5982\u9075\u4f55\uff0c\u800c\u5bb6\u5728\u517e\uff0c\u9042\u8207\u90e1\u540f\u4e0a\u5b98\u5b50\u8129\u7b49\u9084\u517e\u3002) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. When Jiang Wei returned to Ji County, the people welcomed him back and insisted that he meet Zhuge Liang. Jiang Wei and Shangguan Zixiu relented and went to see Zhuge Liang, who was delighted to meet them. By the time Jiang Wei wanted to go back to Ji County to fetch his family members (mother, wife and child(ren)), Wei forces under Zhang He and Fei Yao had defeated the Shu vanguard at the Battle of Jieting. Unable to return to Ji County and left with no other option, Jiang Wei decided to defect to Shu and follow Zhuge Liang. After Wei forces recaptured Ji County, they took Jiang Wei's family members captive but did not execute them because they knew that Jiang Wei did not originally intend to defect to the enemy. Jiang Wei's family members thus spent the rest of their lives in prison.(\u517e\u4e2d\u540f\u6c11\u898b\u7dad\u7b49\u5927\u559c\uff0c\u4fbf\u63a8\u4ee4\u898b\u4eae\u3002\u4e8c\u4eba\u4e0d\u7372\u5df2\uff0c\u4e43\u5171\u8a63\u4eae\u3002\u4eae\u898b\uff0c\u5927\u6071\u3002\u672a\u53ca\u9063\u8fce\u517e\u4e2d\u4eba\uff0c\u6703\u4eae\u524d\u92d2\u70ba\u5f35\u90c3\u3001\u8cbb\u7e47\u7b49\u6240\u7834\uff0c\u9042\u5c07\u7dad\u7b49\u5374\u7e2e\u3002\u7dad\u4e0d\u5f97\u9084\uff0c\u9042\u5165\u8700\u3002\u8af8\u8ecd\u653b\u517e\uff0c\u7686\u5f97\u7dad\u6bcd\u59bb\u5b50\uff0c\u4ea6\u4ee5\u7dad\u672c\u7121\u53bb\u610f\uff0c\u6545\u4e0d\u6c92\u5176\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f46\u7e6b\u4fdd\u5b98\u4ee5\u5ef6\u4e4b\u3002) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. ==During Zhuge Liang's regency== After returning to Hanzhong Commandery, Zhuge Liang appointed Jiang Wei as an Assistant official in charge of food supplies (\u5009\u66f9\u63be).

After Jiang Wan was appointed Grand Marshal (\u5927\u53f8\u99ac) in April or May 239, he appointed Jiang Wei as a Major (\u53f8\u99ac) under him.

Guo Huai split his army into two groups with the aim of preventing Jiang Wei from meeting up and combining forces with Zhiwudai. He led one group to attack Liao Hua at Chengzhong Mountain to force Jiang Wei to turn back to save Liao Hua. At the same time, he ordered his subordinate Xiahou Ba to attack Jiang Wei and push him back towards Tazhong (\u6c93\u4e2d; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu). Guo Huai's plan succeeded as Jiang Wei turned back to save Liao Hua when he learnt that Chengzhong Mountain was under attack.

He had two fortresses constructed at Qushan (\u9eb4\u5c71; southeast of present-day Min County, Gansu). In response to the Shu invasion, the Wei general Guo Huai ordered his subordinates Chen Tai, Xu Zhi and Deng Ai to besiege the two fortresses and cut off their supply routes. When Jiang Wei led troops from Mount Niutou (\u725b\u982d\u5c71; west of present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan) to reinforce the two fortresses, Chen Tai led a Wei army to block his path. At the same time, Chen Tai sought help from Guo Huai, who led his troops across the Tao River to attack Jiang Wei's base at Mount Niutou. Jiang Wei became fearful so he pulled back all his troops and abandoned the two fortresses.(\u6dee\u5f9e\u6cf0\u8a08\uff0c\u4f7f\u6cf0\u7387\u8a0e\u8700\u8b77\u8ecd\u5f90\u8cea\u3001\u5357\u5b89\u592a\u5b88\u9127\u827e\u7b49\u9032\u5175\u570d\u4e4b\uff0c\u65b7\u5176\u904b\u9053\u53ca\u57ce\u5916\u6d41\u6c34\u3002\u5b89\u7b49\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4e0d\u8a31\uff0c\u5c07\u58eb\u56f0\u7a98\uff0c\u5206\u7ce7\u805a\u96ea\u4ee5\u7a3d\u65e5\u6708\u3002\u7dad\u679c\u4f86\u6551\uff0c\u51fa\u81ea\u725b\u982d\u5c71\uff0c\u8207\u6cf0\u76f8\u5c0d\u3002 ... \u52d1\u8af8\u8ecd\u5404\u5805\u58d8\u52ff\u8207\u6230\uff0c\u9063\u4f7f\u767d\u6dee\uff0c\u6b32\u81ea\u5357\u6e21\u767d\u6c34\uff0c\u5faa\u6c34\u800c\u6771\uff0c\u4f7f\u6dee\u8da3\u725b\u982d\uff0c\u622a\u5176\u9084\u8def\uff0c\u53ef\u5e76\u53d6\u7dad\uff0c\u4e0d\u60df\u5b89\u7b49\u800c\u5df2\u3002\u6dee\u5584\u5176\u7b56\uff0c\u9032\u7387\u8af8\u8ecd\u8ecd\u6d2e\u6c34\u3002\u7dad\u61fc\uff0c\u9041\u8d70\uff0c\u5b89\u7b49\u5b64\u7e23\uff0c\u9042\u7686\u964d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 22.

One theory says that Jiang Wei had secretly recruited Guo Xiu as an assassin after capturing him in battle, and ordered him to find an opportunity to murder Fei Yi. Jiang Wei's motive for taking Fei Yi's life, according to the theory, was that he needed to eliminate Fei Yi as a potential threat because Fei Yi had been opposing his hawkish stance towards Wei. Regardless of whether or not Jiang Wei plotted Fei Yi's assassination, Fei Yi's death did allow Jiang Wei to gain greater control over the Shu military and continue waging war against Wei. ==Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions== A statue of Jiang Wei in Zhuge Liang's temple in Chengdu.

In response to the Shu invasion, the Wei regent Sima Shi ordered his generals Guo Huai and Chen Tai to lead the Wei forces stationed in the Guanzhong region to attack the invaders and lift the siege on Didao. Chen Tai attacked the Shu forces at Luomen (\u6d1b\u9580; in present-day Wushan County, Gansu) and defeated them.

Li Jian (\u674e\u7c21), the Wei official in charge of Didao (\u72c4\u9053; around present-day Lintao County, Gansu), surrendered to Jiang Wei. Jiang Wei then pressed further to attack Xiangwu County (\u8944\u6b66\u7e23; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu) and engaged the Wei general Xu Zhi in battle. Xu Zhi was defeated and killed, but the Shu army also lost a general, Zhang Ni.

In the meantime, Chen Tai, Deng Ai, Sima Fu and other Wei officers led reinforcements to Didao to save Wang Jing. Chen Tai led his troops to the hills southeast of Didao, where they lit more fires and beat their war drums loudly to let the Wei forces in Didao know that reinforcements were on the way. As a result, the Wei forces in Didao experienced a surge in morale, and the Shu forces were taken by surprise. At the same time, Chen Tai also spread false news that they were planning to cut off the Shu army's retreat route. When Jiang Wei heard about it, he became fearful so on 11 November 255 he withdrew all the Shu forces and retreated to Zhongti (\u9418\u5824; south of present-day Lintao County, Gansu).(\u9b4f\u5f81\u897f\u5c07\u8ecd\u9673\u6cf0\u9032\u5175\u89e3\u570d\uff0c\u7dad\u5374\u4f4f\u937e\u984c\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. ===Ninth Northern Expedition=== In the spring of 256, the Shu emperor Liu Shan promoted Jiang Wei to the position of General-in-Chief (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd).([\u5ef6\u7199]\u5341\u4e5d\u5e74\u6625\uff0c\u5c31\u9077\u7dad\u70ba\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. In autumn, Jiang Wei led Shu forces from Zhongti (\u9418\u5824; south of present-day Lintao County, Gansu) to conquer Mount Qi (\u7941\u5c71; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu) but failed because the Wei general Deng Ai had anticipated the attack and already set up strong defences. Jiang Wei then attacked Deng Ai at Mount Wucheng (\u6b66\u57ce\u5c71; in present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi) but was driven back. Later, he led his troops across the Wei River to launch a coordinated strike on Shanggui County (\u4e0a\u90bd\u7e23; in present-day Tianshui, Gansu) with another Shu force led by Hu Ji. However, Hu Ji failed to show up in time so Jiang Wei came under attack by Deng Ai and his army sustained heavy casualties.(\u66f4\u6574\u52d2\u620e\u99ac\uff0c\u8207\u93ae\u897f\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u80e1\u6fdf\u671f\u6703\u4e0a\u90bd\uff0c\u6fdf\u5931\u8a93\u4e0d\u81f3\uff0c\u6545\u7dad\u70ba\u9b4f\u5927\u5c07\u9127\u827e\u6240\u7834\u65bc\u6bb5\u8c37\uff0c\u661f\u6563\u6d41\u96e2\uff0c\u6b7b\u8005\u751a\u8846\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. As the Northern Expeditions took a huge toll on Shu's population and resources, the people increasingly resented Jiang Wei for his warmongering behaviour. In order to appease public anger, Jiang Wei wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court to take full responsibility for the failure of the ninth Northern Expedition and requested to be demoted as punishment. Liu Shan approved Jiang Wei's request and demoted him to the position of General of the Rear (\u5f8c\u5c07\u8ecd) but allowed him to remain as acting General-in-Chief (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd).(\u8846\u5eb6\u7531\u662f\u6028\u8b9f\uff0c\u800c\u96b4\u5df2\u897f\u4ea6\u9a37\u52d5\u4e0d\u5be7\uff0c\u7dad\u8b1d\u904e\u5f15\u8ca0\uff0c\u6c42\u81ea\u8cb6\u524a\u3002\u70ba\u5f8c\u5c07\u8ecd\uff0c\u884c\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u4e8b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. ===Tenth Northern Expedition=== In 257, when the Wei general Zhuge Dan started a rebellion in Shouchun (\u58fd\u6625; present-day Shou County, Anhui), Jiang Wei decided to take advantage of the situation to stage another invasion of Wei. He led Shu forces to attack the Wei garrisons near the Great Wall which were well- stocked with supplies but poorly defended. The Wei forces stationed there started panicking when they heard of the Shu army's approach.([\u5ef6\u7199]\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\uff0c\u9b4f\u5f81\u6771\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u8af8\u845b\u8a95\u53cd\u65bc\u6dee\u5357\uff0c\u5206\u95dc\u4e2d\u5175\u6771\u4e0b\u3002\u7dad\u6b32\u4e58\u865b\u5411\u79e6\u5ddd\uff0c\u5fa9\u7387\u6578\u842c\u4eba\u51fa\u99f1\u8c37\uff0c\u5f91\u81f3\u6c88\u5dba\u3002\u6642\u9577\u57ce\u7a4d\u7a40\u751a\u591a\u800c\u5b88\u5175\u4e43\u5c11\uff0c\u805e\u7dad\u65b9\u5230\uff0c\u8846\u7686\u60f6\u61fc\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. The Wei generals Sima Wang and Deng Ai led separate armies to the Great Wall to resist the Shu invaders. Jiang Wei then retreated to Mangshui (\u8292\u6c34; southeast of present-day Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi) and set up a camp there with its back facing a mountain. When the Wei forces encircled his position, Jiang Wei tried to taunt them to attack his camp but Sima Wang and Deng Ai ordered their troops to ignore the enemy and refrain from attacking.(\u9b4f\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u53f8\u99ac\u671b\u62d2\u4e4b\uff0c\u9127\u827e\u4ea6\u81ea\u96b4\u53f3\uff0c\u7686\u8ecd\u4e8e\u9577\u57ce\u3002\u7dad\u524d\u4f4f\u8292\u6c34\uff0c\u7686\u501a\u5c71\u70ba\u71df\u3002\u671b\u3001\u827e\u508d\u6e2d\u5805\u570d\uff0c\u7dad\u6578\u4e0b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u671b\u3001\u827e\u4e0d\u61c9\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. In 258, after Jiang Wei received news that Wei forces had suppressed Zhuge Dan's rebellion, he withdrew his troops and returned to the Shu capital Chengdu. The Shu emperor Liu Shan restored him to the position of General-in- Chief (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd).(\u666f\u8000\u5143\u5e74\uff0c\u7dad\u805e\u8a95\u7834\u6557\uff0c\u4e43\u9084\u6210\u90fd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. At the time, having seen year after year of battles against Wei, the people of Shu were growing tired of having to endure the costs and effects of war. The Shu official Qiao Zhou also wrote the \"Chou Guo Lun\" (\u4ec7\u570b\u8ad6; \"Disquisition on Rivalling States\"), a satirical piece criticising Jiang Wei for his warmongering behaviour. ===Eleventh Northern Expedition=== In the winter of 262, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to occupy Taoyang County (\u6d2e\u967d\u7e23; in present-day Lintao County, Gansu) and attack Wei forces led by Deng Ai at Houhe County (\u4faf\u548c\u7e23) but they lost the battle.

However, despite leading eleven campaigns against Wei, he had not made any significant achievements. While he was away at the frontline, the palace eunuch Huang Hao, whom the emperor Liu Shan favoured, gradually gained power in the Shu government and dominated the political scene. Huang Hao had a close partnership with the Shu general Yan Yu (\u95bb\u5b87) and he considered replacing Jiang Wei with Yan Yu as General-in- Chief.(\u7dad\u672c\u7f88\u65c5\u8a17\u570b\uff0c\u7d2f\u5e74\u653b\u6230\uff0c\u529f\u7e3e\u4e0d\u7acb\uff0c\u800c\u5ba6\u81e3\u9ec3\u7693\u7b49\u5f04\u6b0a\u65bc\u5167\uff0c\u53f3\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u95bb\u5b87\u8207\u7693\u604a\u6bd4\uff0c\u800c\u7693\u9670\u6b32\u5ee2\u7dad\u6a39\u5b87\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. Jiang Wei had long suspected that Huang Hao had something against him so he remained in Tazhong (\u6c93\u4e2d; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu) and did not return to Chengdu after the eleventh Northern Expedition.(\u7dad\u4ea6\u7591\u4e4b\u3002\u6545\u81ea\u5371\u61fc\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fa9\u9084\u6210\u90fd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. The Chronicles of Huayang recorded that Jiang Wei hated Huang Hao for his power-grabbing behaviour and once advised Liu Shan to execute the eunuch. However, Liu Shan refused and said: \"Huang Hao is but a servant running errands for me. In the past, I was annoyed by Dong Yun's deep hatred of him. Sir, why do you need to take this so personally?\" Jiang Wei soon realised that he had a mistake in advising Liu Shan to execute Huang Hao because Huang Hao had strong influence in the Shu government, so he quickly excused himself and left. Liu Shan later instructed Huang Hao to visit Jiang Wei and apologise to him. Jiang Wei also managed to convince Huang Hao to let him remain in Tazhong to oversee agricultural production. His true intention, however, was to avoid getting caught up in a power struggle with Huang Hao in Chengdu.(\u83ef\u967d\u570b\u5fd7\u66f0\uff1b\u7dad\u60e1\u9ec3\u7693\u6063\u64c5\uff0c\u555f\u5f8c\u4e3b\u6b32\u6bba\u4e4b\u3002\u5f8c\u4e3b\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u7693\u8da8\u8d70\u5c0f\u81e3\u8033\uff0c\u5f80\u8463\u5141\u5207\u9f52\uff0c\u543e\u5e38\u6068\u4e4b\uff0c\u541b\u4f55\u8db3\u4ecb\u610f\uff01\u300d\u7dad\u898b\u7693\u679d\u9644\u8449\u9023\uff0c\u61fc\u65bc\u5931\u8a00\uff0c\u905c\u8fad\u800c\u51fa\u3002\u5f8c\u4e3b\u52d1\u7693\u8a63\u7dad\u9673\u8b1d\u3002\u7dad\u8aaa\u7693\u6c42\u6c93\u4e2d\u7a2e\u9ea5\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u5167\u903c\u723e\u3002) Huayang Guo Zhi annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. ==Fall of Shu== ===Jiang Wei's early warnings=== In 263, Jiang Wei wrote a memorial to Liu Shan as follows: Huang Hao believed fortune-tellers' prediction that Wei would not invade Shu, so he advised Liu Shan to ignore Jiang Wei's memorial and not put it up for discussion in the imperial court.(\u7693\u5fb5\u4fe1\u9b3c\u5deb\uff0c\u8b02\u6575\u7d42\u4e0d\u81ea\u81f4\uff0c\u555f\u5f8c\u4e3b\u5be2\u5176\u4e8b\uff0c\u800c\u7fa3\u81e3\u4e0d\u77e5\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. ===From Tazhong to Yinping=== Around August or September 263, the Wei regent Sima Zhao ordered Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu to lead Wei forces to invade Shu from three different directions. When Zhong Hui reached Luo Valley (\u99f1\u8c37; southwest of present-day Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi) and Deng Ai attacked Tazhong (\u6c93\u4e2d; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu), the Shu government ordered Liao Hua to lead reinforcements to support Jiang Wei at Tazhong. At the same time, they also sent Zhang Yi, Dong Jue and other Shu officers to lead troops to guard Yang'an Pass (\u967d\u5b89\u95dc; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi) and assist the Shu forces on the external perimeter.(\u53ca\u937e\u6703\u5c07\u5411\u99f1\u8c37\uff0c\u9127\u827e\u5c07\u5165\u6c93\u4e2d\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u4e43\u9063\u53f3\u8eca\u9a0e\u5ed6\u5316\u8a63\u6c93\u4e2d\u70ba\u7dad\u63f4\uff0c\u5de6\u8eca\u9a0e\u5f35\u7ffc\u3001\u8f14\u570b\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u8463\u53a5\u7b49\u8a63\u967d\u5b89\u95dc\u53e3\u4ee5\u70ba\u8af8\u570d\u5916\u52a9\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. When the Shu reinforcements reached Yinping (\u9670\u5e73; present- day Wen County, Gansu), they heard that Zhuge Xu was attacking Jianwei (\u5efa\u5a01; northeast of present-day Wudu District, Longnan, Gansu), so they stopped in their tracks at Yinping.(\u6bd4\u81f3\u9670\u5e73\uff0c\u805e\u9b4f\u5c07\u8af8\u845b\u7dd2\u5411\u5efa\u5a01\uff0c\u6545\u4f4f\u5f85\u4e4b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

At the same time, Zhong Hui besieged Hancheng (\u6f22\u57ce; present-day Mian County, Shaanxi) and Lecheng (\u6a02\u57ce; present-day Chenggu County, Shaanxi) counties, and sent his subordinates to attack Yang'an Pass. The Shu officer Jiang Shu (\u8523\u8212) opened up the pass and surrendered to the enemy, while his colleague Fu Qian died trying to defend the pass. After failing to take Lecheng County, Zhong Hui gave up and advanced towards Yang'an Pass when he learnt that his subordinates had captured the pass.(\u937e\u6703\u653b\u570d\u6f22\u3001\u6a02\u4e8c\u57ce\uff0c\u9063\u5225\u5c07\u9032\u653b\u95dc\u53e3\uff0c\u8523\u8212\u958b\u57ce\u51fa\u964d\uff0c\u5085\u50c9\u683c\u9b2c\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\u6703\u653b\u6a02\u57ce\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u514b\uff0c\u805e\u95dc\u53e3\u5df2\u4e0b\uff0c\u9577\u9a45\u800c\u524d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. ===Defence of Jiange=== By the time Zhang Yi and Dong Jue reached Hanshou County (\u6f22\u58fd\u7e23; northeast of present-day Jiange County, Sichuan), Jiang Wei and Liao Hua had decided to abandon their position at Yinping and rendezvous with Zhang Yi and Dong Jue at the mountain pass Jiange, where they resisted attacks by Zhong Hui.(\u7ffc\u3001\u53a5\u752b\u81f3\u6f22\u58fd\uff0c\u7dad\u3001\u5316\u4ea6\u820d\u9670\u5e73\u800c\u9000\uff0c\u9069\u8207\u7ffc\u3001\u53a5\u5408\uff0c\u7686\u9000\u4fdd\u5292\u95a3\u4ee5\u62d2\u6703\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

Jiang Wei did not reply Zhong Hui and he ordered his troops to strengthen their defences at Jiange. After failing to breach the mountain pass and with his army's food supplies running low, Zhong Hui considered pulling back all his troops and retreating.(\u7dad\u4e0d\u8345\u66f8\uff0c\u5217\u71df\u5b88\u96aa\u3002\u6703\u4e0d\u80fd\u514b\uff0c\u7ce7\u904b\u7e23\u9060\uff0c\u5c07\u8b70\u9084\u6b78\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. ===Shu surrender=== In the meantime, Deng Ai and his troops took a shortcut from Yinping through mountainous terrain and showed up at Mianzhu, where they defeated the Shu defenders led by Zhuge Zhan. After taking Mianzhu, Deng Ai advanced further and approached Chengdu, the Shu capital. In late November or December 263, Liu Shan decided to surrender to Deng Ai, thus bringing an end to the existence of Shu.(\u800c\u9127\u827e\u81ea\u9670\u5e73\u7531\u666f\u8c37\u9053\u508d\u5165\uff0c\u9042\u7834\u8af8\u845b\u77bb\u65bc\u7ddc\u7af9\u3002\u5f8c\u4e3b\u8acb\u964d\u65bc\u827e\uff0c\u827e\u524d\u64da\u6210\u90fd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. When Jiang Wei first heard that Mianzhu had fallen, he also received confusing information about the situation in Chengdu. Some said that Liu Shan wanted to remain in Chengdu and defend the city, while others claimed that the Shu emperor was going to abandon Chengdu and flee south to Jianning Commandery (\u5efa\u5be7\u90e1; covering parts of present-day Yunnan and Guizhou). Jiang Wei thus prepared to abandon Jiange and lead his troops to Qi County (\u90ea\u7e23; present- day Santai County, Sichuan), which was nearer to Chengdu, to verify the truth.(\u7dad\u7b49\u521d\u805e\u77bb\u7834\uff0c\u6216\u805e\u5f8c\u4e3b\u6b32\u56fa\u5b88\u6210\u90fd\uff0c\u6216\u805e\u6b32\u5357\u5165\u5efa\u5be7\uff0c\u65bc\u662f\u5f15\u8ecd\u7531\u5ee3\u6f22\u3001\u90ea\u9053\u4ee5\u5be9\u865b\u5be6\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. Just then, Jiang Wei and his troops received orders from Chengdu to lay down their arms and surrender to Zhong Hui at Fu County (\u6daa\u7e23; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). Many Shu soldiers felt so shocked and angry when they heard of their emperor's surrender that they drew their swords and slashed at rocks to vent their frustration.(\u5c0b\u88ab\u5f8c\u4e3b\u6555\u4ee4\uff0c\u4e43\u6295\u6208\u653e\u7532\uff0c\u8a63\u6703\u65bc\u6daa\u8ecd\u524d\uff0c\u5c07\u58eb\u54b8\u6012\uff0c\u62d4\u5200\u65ab\u77f3\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

They travelled in the same carriage and sat at the same table during meals. Zhong Hui also told his chief clerk Du Yu: \"Famous people from the Central Plains like Gongxiu and Taichu can't be compared to Boyue.\"([\u937e]\u6703\u539a\u5f85[\u59dc]\u7dad\u7b49\uff0c\u7686\u6b0a\u9084\u5176\u5370\u865f\u7bc0\u84cb\u3002\u6703\u8207\u7dad\u51fa\u5247\u540c\u8f5d\uff0c\u5750\u5247\u540c\u5e2d\uff0c\u8b02\u9577\u53f2\u675c\u9810\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4ee5\u4f2f\u7d04\u6bd4\u4e2d\u571f\u540d\u58eb\uff0c\u516c\u4f11\u3001\u592a\u521d\u4e0d\u80fd\u52dd\u4e5f\u3002\u300d) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

With Deng Ai gone, Zhong Hui had control over Chengdu and the former Shu territories. In March 264, he started a revolt against the Wei regent Sima Zhao and declared himself the Governor of Yi Province (\u76ca\u5dde\u7267).(\u6703\u65e3\u69cb\u9127\u827e\uff0c\u827e\u6abb\u8eca\u5fb5\uff0c\u56e0\u5c07\u7dad\u7b49\u8a63\u6210\u90fd\uff0c\u81ea\u7a31\u76ca\u5dde\u7267\u4ee5\u53db\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

However, around noon on 3 March 264, some Wei officers who were unwilling to participate in the rebellion started a mutiny against Zhong Hui. At the time, Jiang Wei was collecting his armour and weapons from Zhong Hui when they heard shouting and received news that a fire had broken out. Moments later, it was reported that many soldiers were crowding near the city gates. Zhong Hui was surprised and he asked Jiang Wei: \"Those men are causing trouble. What should we do?\" Jiang Wei replied: \"Kill them.\"(\u5341\u516b\u65e5\u65e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u70c8\u8ecd\u5175\u8207\u70c8\u5152\u96f7\u9f13\u51fa\u9580\uff0c\u8af8\u8ecd\u5175\u4e0d\u671f\u7686\u9f13\u8b5f\u51fa\uff0c\u66fe\u7121\u7763\u4fc3\u4e4b\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u722d\u5148\u8d74\u57ce\u3002\u6642\u65b9\u7d66\u8207\u59dc\u7dad\u93a7\u6756\uff0c\u767d\u5916\u6709\u5308\u5308\u8072\uff0c\u4f3c\u5931\u706b\uff0c\u6709\u9803\uff0c\u767d\u5175\u8d70\u5411\u57ce\u3002\u6703\u9a5a\uff0c\u8b02\u7dad\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5175\u4f86\u4f3c\u6b32\u4f5c\u60e1\uff0c\u7576\u4e91\u4f55\uff1f\u300d\u7dad\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4f46\u7576\u64ca\u4e4b\u8033\u3002\u300d) Sanguozhi vol. 28. Zhong Hui then ordered his men to kill the officers who refused to participate in the rebellion. A while later, there were reports of people climbing up the city gates on ladders and of people setting fire to buildings. Chaos broke out and arrows were fired in all directions. The mutinying officers regrouped with their men and attacked Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei. Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei fought the mutinying soldiers and slew about five or six of them, but were eventually overwhelmed and killed.(\u6703\u9063\u5175\u6089\u6bba\u6240\u9589\u8af8\u7259\u9580\u90e1\u5b88\uff0c\u5167\u4eba\u5171\u8209\u673a\u4ee5\u67f1\u9580\uff0c\u5175\u65ab\u9580\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u7834\u3002\u65af\u9808\uff0c\u9580\u5916\u501a\u68af\u767b\u57ce\uff0c\u6216\u71d2\u57ce\u5c4b\uff0c\u87fb\u9644\u4e82\u9032\uff0c\u77e2\u4e0b\u5982\u96e8\uff0c\u7259\u9580\u3001\u90e1\u5b88\u5404\u7de3\u5c4b\u51fa\uff0c\u8207\u5176\u5352\u5175\u76f8\u5f97\u3002\u59dc\u7dad\u7387\u6703\u5de6\u53f3\u6230\uff0c\u624b\u6bba\u4e94\u516d\u4eba\uff0c\u8846\u65e3\u683c\u65ac\u7dad\uff0c\u722d\u8d74\u6bba\u6703\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 28.

He also wrote a secret letter to Liu Shan as follows: ==Family and descendants== Jiang Wei's father, Jiang Jiong (\u59dc\u518f), served as a military officer in Tianshui Commandery and lost his life while suppressing a rebellion by the Qiang and other non-Han Chinese tribes.

He cited seven writers (Xi Zheng, Sun Sheng, Chen Shou, He Zhuo, Gan Bao, Wang Mingsheng and Pei Songzhi) who held different and discordant views of Jiang Wei. Boyang himself, however, declined to comment but later shared in an open letter to a reader that he agreed with all seven views: Jiang Wei committed a fatal error in draining Shu's resources but he was also a loyal general who was willing to sacrifice himself in a futile attempt to restore Shu. ===Zhuge Liang's views=== Zhuge Liang once told Zhang Yi and Jiang Wan: On another occasion, Zhuge Liang said: ===Xi Zheng's views=== Xi Zheng, a scholar from Shu who later served as an official under the Jin dynasty, commented on Jiang Wei as follows: ===Sun Sheng's views=== The Jin dynasty historian Sun Sheng responded to Xi Zheng's comments on Jiang Wei as follows: In his Jin Yang Qiu (\u6649\u967d\u79cb), Sun Sheng also wrote: ===Chen Shou's views=== Chen Shou, the Jin dynasty historian who wrote Jiang Wei's biography in the Sanguozhi, appraised Jiang Wei as follows: ===He Zhuo's views=== The Qing dynasty writer He Zhuo (\u4f55\u712f) wrote: ===Gan Bao's views=== The Jin dynasty historian Gan Bao wrote: ===Wang Mingsheng's views=== The Qing dynasty historian Wang Mingsheng (\u738b\u9cf4\u76db) wrote: ===Pei Songzhi's views=== The Liu Song dynasty historian Pei Songzhi, who annotated the Sanguozhi, commented on Jiang Wei as follows: Pei Songzhi also rebutted Sun Sheng's response to Xi Zheng's comments on Jiang Wei: ===Miscellaneous=== The Shiyu (\u4e16\u8a9e) recorded that Jiang Wei had no equal among the talented persons serving in the Shu government during his time.(\u4e16\u8a9e\u66f0\uff1a\u6642\u8700\u5b98\u5c6c\u7686\u5929\u4e0b\u82f1\u4fca\uff0c\u7121\u51fa\u7dad\u53f3\u3002) Shiyu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. ==In Romance of the Three Kingdoms== Jiang Wei, as he appears in Dynasty Warriors 5. Jiang Wei is a major character in the later chapters of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events and figures of the late Eastern Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period of China. In the novel, he is depicted as Zhuge Liang's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and successor who inherits the legacy of leading Shu into war against Wei with the aim of restoring the fallen Eastern Han dynasty. Jiang Wei first appears in Chapters 92 and 93 as a Wei military officer serving in Tianshui Commandery during Zhuge Liang's first Northern Expedition. When Zhuge Liang tries to trick Ma Zun, the Administrator of Tianshui, to lead his troops out of Tianshui to save the Wei general Xiahou Mao in Nan'an Commandery, Jiang Wei sees through Zhuge Liang's ruse and advises Ma Zun to remain in Tianshui and set a trap for the enemy. When the Shu general Zhao Yun shows up to take Tianshui, he falls into the trap and briefly duels with Jiang Wei before Shu reinforcements arrive and save him. Zhao Yun tells Zhuge Liang that he is impressed that Tianshui has such a talent like Jiang Wei. When Jiang Wei successfully repels another Shu attack, Zhuge Liang is even more impressed and eager to recruit Jiang Wei to serve in Shu. He tricks Ma Zun into believing that Jiang Wei has defected to Shu in order to prevent Jiang Wei from going back to Wei, and then springs a trap for Jiang Wei. When Jiang Wei gets cornered, he attempts suicide but Zhuge Liang stops him and manages to convince him to surrender and join Shu.Sanguo Yanyi chs. 92-93. Jiang Wei accompanies Zhuge Liang on his subsequent Northern Expeditions. Chapters 107 to 115 dramatise Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions and refer to them as Jiang Wei's \"Nine Campaigns on the Central Plains\"Sanguo Yanyi chs. 107-115. when historically there were actually eleven campaigns instead of nine. In Chapter 119, Jiang Wei instigates Zhong Hui to launch a rebellion against Wei, but their rebellion fails when some of Zhong Hui's officers start a mutiny against their superior. Cornered by the enemy, Jiang Wei sighs, \"It is Heaven's will that my plan doesn't succeed!\" He then commits suicide by slitting his throat.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 119. A verse from the novel in Jiang Wei's honour reads: ==In popular culture== Jiang Wei appears as a playable character in the video game series Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi produced by Koei Tecmo. In the games, he is portrayed as a young warrior fiercely devoted to his mentor Zhuge Liang. He also appears in Koei Tecmo's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. ==Memorials and relics== A Jiang Wei Memorial Museum (\u59dc\u7dad\u7d00\u5ff5\u9928) was constructed in 1999 near Jiang Wei's hometown in the east of Gangu County, Tianshui, Gansu. The museum, covering an area of 360 square metres, was funded by the locals. Among other things, it contains a four-metre-tall statue of Jiang Wei in the main hall, as well as a stone tablet inscribed with the words \"Jiang Wei's hometown\" in calligraphy by the general Yang Chengwu. The Pingxiang Tower (\u5e73\u8944\u697c) in present- day Lushan County, Sichuan is a 24-metre-tall building commemorating Jiang Wei. Its name comes from Jiang Wei's peerage, the Marquis of Pingxiang (\u5e73\u8944\u4faf). The tower was built during the Song dynasty, renovated in 1445 during the Ming dynasty, and designated as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level by China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage in 2006. There are a number of relics related to Jiang Wei at Jianmen Pass in present-day Jiange County, Sichuan, including a Jiang Wei Well (\u59dc\u7dad\u4e95), Jiang Wei Cave (\u59dc\u7dad\u6d1e), Jiang Wei Fortress (\u59dc\u7dad\u57ce), Jiang Wei Temple (\u59dc\u7dad\u5edf), Lord Jiang Bridge (\u59dc\u516c\u6a4b), Jiang Wei Armoury (\u59dc\u7dad\u8ecd\u68b0) and Jiang Wei Tomb (\u59dc\u7dad\u5893). Poets such as Lu You, Zuo Mu (\u5de6\u7267), Li Tiaoyuan (\u674e\u8abf\u5143) and Zhuang Xuehe (\u838a\u5b78\u548c) have written poems at Jianmen Pass to praise Jiang Wei. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==Notes== ==References== * * Chang, Qu ( 4th century).
