    "text": "Go Fighting! () is a Chinese variety show broadcast on SMG: Dragon Television. It was first aired June 14, 2015. Go Fighting! is classified as a game- variety-reality show, and the MCs and guests complete missions at a landmark to win the objective. Usually each episode will also have an over-arching theme or story. Each episode varies in the challenges and the instructions given to the MCs, and rules are not strictly enforced, resulting in a largely unscripted show. == History == The show has been a commercial and critical success since its inception, and the MCs have received praise for 'breaking the rules' of usual variety game shows and mingling with normal people going about their daily lives. The first and second seasons averaged ratings of 8.9/10 and 9.1/10 on China's main review-based social network site Douban. The show's catch phrases are \"This is fate / \u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u547d\" and \"This is love / \u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u7231\" with a corresponding action that resembles the Chinese character for 'fate / \u547d'. Go Fighting! has been called the Chinese version of the popular Korean variety show Infinite Challenge; this comparison has led to minor controversies. ==Personnel== In March 2019, it was reported that original director Yan Min and cast members Huang Bo and Sun Honglei have decided to temporarily back out of the show after Season 4 due to scheduling conflicts. Huang Lei stated he would only be present for 3 episodes due to acting commitments. They were replaced by Lei Jiayin, Yue Yunpeng and Dilraba Dilmurat. In March 2020, Season 6 began filming with a brand new cast consisting of Lei Jiayin, Guo Jingfei, Jia Nailiang, Yue Yunpeng, and Deng Lun. Wang Xun and Zhang Yixing (\"Lay\") were the only original cast members left. ===Current Cast=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" ; ! Name ! Age ! Occupation ! Duration !

Sun Honglei's foolish big brother act, along with Lay Zhang\u2019s absent-mindedness and Wang Xun's slowness to realize, created this lasting combination. |- |Go Fighting Three Geniuses \u6781\u9650\u4e09\u7cbe |Huang Lei Huang Bo Show Lo |In episode 1/01, the three were put in a team. In comparison to the Three Idiots, these three are considered geniuses (Huang Lei in particular), although recently Show Lo has exhibited sillier behaviour, making him more alike to the Three Idiots and being referred to as the Fourth Idiot. |- |Minesweeper Alliance \u626b\u96f7\u8054\u76df |Huang Lei Huang Bo Show Lo Wang Xun Lay Zhang |The character 'lei' in Sun Honglei's name is the same as the character for a mine. In episode 2/03, the five banded together to steal Sun Honglei's jogger step counter.

Combining the two characters from their names makes the word pineapple. |- |Double Huang Combination \u53cc\u9ec4\u7ec4\u5408 |Huang Lei Huang Bo |The two have been labelled as the smartest MCs in the show after Show Lo started resembling an 'idiot'. |- |Pig-Sheep Combination \u732a\u7f8a\u7ec4\u5408 |Show Lo Lay Zhang |They often paired up for missions, and in the last episode of Season 1, they were known as Mirror Brothers after Show successfully imitated Lay Zhang during a taxi ride. |- |Lei-Luo Combination \u96f7\u7f57\u7ec4\u5408 |Sun Honglei Show Lo |In episode 1/06, the two were forced to cross dress as women and fight for a seat on the train.
