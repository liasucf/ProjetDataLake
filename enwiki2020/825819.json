The company was able to continue doing research and development on the Model A, earning a type certificate in July 1944, with the future production model was designated the Model A-2. CallAir started production of the Model A-2 in late 1945, and in 1946 it purchased the rights to the Interstate Cadet from the Harlow Aircraft Company for $5,000 ($ in ). Production of the Model A and Cadet continued, with variations of both types being developed over time. Sales of the Model A grew with the A-4, which was adapted in 1954 into the world's first purpose-built agricultural aircraft, which was later developed into the A-5, the best seller (83 built, including the A-5 Texan) of the Model A-series. CallAir found itself struggling against fierce competition from Cessna, Piper, and the masses of war-surplus aircraft flooding the market,. After 20 years of ownership, founder Reuel Call sold the company in 1959, and the company foundered by the end of the year. In 1962 the company's assets were purchased by the Intermountain Manufacturing Company (IMCO). The factory was later purchased by Aero Commander in 1967. ==Museum== The CallAir Foundation maintains a museum of the company in its hometown. ==List== CallAir's aircraft included: * CallAir S-1 * CallAir A * CallAir A-2 * CallAir A-3 * CallAir A-4 * CallAir A-5 * CallAir A-6 * CallAir A-7 * CallAir A-9 ==See also== * Aviat ==References== ==Further reading== * == External links == * CallAir Museum, Wyoming * CallAir Aircraft Production List Category:Defunct aircraft manufacturers of the United States Category:Companies based in Wyoming Category:Manufacturing companies based in Wyoming ",
