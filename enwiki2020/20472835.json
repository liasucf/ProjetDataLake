In July 2006, Le Maire was appointed to the role of being Chief of Staff for the Prime Minister, replacing Pierre Mongin remaining in the role until Villepin's departure from the office of Prime Minister. From 2007 to 2008, he was a member of the National Assembly of France, representing Eure's 1st constituency.

He also serves as a council member of Evreux. ===Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fishing, 2009\u20132012=== In June 2009, Le Maire became the new Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fishing in the government of Fran\u00e7ois Fillon. During his tenure at the Ministry, he created a new framework to modernize French agriculture, food and fishing. He also hosted the G20 Agriculture summit in 2011, which resulted in the creation of AMIS (Agricultural Market Information System). The main objective of AMIS is to monitor the global agricultural market under a rotating presidency. An intervention Forum can be convoked if the presiding country judges it necessary. ===Candidacies for leadership roles=== Bruno Le Maire speaking at a public event in 2013 Le Maire in Brussels, 2014 On August 2012, Le Maire announced that he would be a candidate for the presidency of the Union for a Popular Movement, competing against former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, Secretary General Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9 and former Minister of Ecology Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet. He decided to develop a reformist line and to focus his campaign around four main axes: * Enhancing European economic integration * Strengthening French entrepreneurship and economy * Going back to the values of respect and authority in society * Renewing generations in political parties. He failed however to obtain the necessary number of sponsors. In November 2014, Le Maire obtained 29.8% of votes against Nicolas Sarkozy in the election for the presidency of The Republicans (formerly UMP). Le Maire was considered a serious challenger of the 2016 centre-right primary as the polls suggested he could be third-placed but got a poor result with 2.4%. He became LR candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon\u2019s international affairs spokesman, but resigned when Fillon was embroiled in a financial scandal during his campaign.Cynthia Kroet (1 March 2017), Bruno Le Maire quits Fran\u00e7ois Fillon\u2019s team Politico Europe. Le Maire has since distanced himself from his party, calling for the right to work constructively with Macron to ensure the president's five years in office succeeds and prevents the far-right National Front making further electoral inroads. On 17 May 2017, The Republicans Secretary-General Bernard Accoyer issued a statement that anyone from the party that was a member of the government was no longer a member, including Le Maire. ===Minister of the Economy and Finance, 2017\u2013present=== Bruno Le Maire (left), Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem (centre) and Greek Minister of Finance Euclid Tsakalotos (right), 2017 Le Maire arriving at an Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting in September 2017 In May 2017, Le Maire was appointed by President Emmanuel Macron Minister of the Economy in the first Philippe government.

On Brexit itself, Le Maire caused controversy on 20 July 2017 when he told the French Parliament's economic affairs committee: \"The United Kingdom has a remaining balance to pay to the EU budget of \u20ac100 billion\" The view held by Le Maire has been shared by European Leaders since April 2017 with some of them believing the \"divorce- bill\" will lead the UK to owing the European Union \u00a350 billion He also promised to set up a special court to handle English-law cases for financial contracts after Brexit during a conference in New York. On foreign trade, Le Maire expressed his opposition against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and also argued for a more protectionist trade policy in order to better defend against \"dumping\" by China.Nicholas Vinocur (11 May 2016), From \u2018yes man\u2019 to his own man: Bruno Le Maire\u2019s EU gamble Politico Europe.

He categorised low tax payments as \"unacceptable\". In July 2020, Le Marie announced that the French government will cut taxes French companies have to pay in addition to normal corporate income tax by 20 million euros over the course of next two years. ===Foreign policy=== On foreign policy, Le Maire is a traditional Gaullist, favouring French national independence.
