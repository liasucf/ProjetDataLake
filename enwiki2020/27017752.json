This is the highest mountain in T\u014dhoku region.https://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/oze/guide/view.html The volcano rises in the north of . It is one of the 100 Famous Japanese Mountains. ==Morphology== Hiuchi initially formed around 350,000 years ago. Around 160,000\u2013170,000 years ago, Hiuchi erupted, creating a large pyroclastic flow deposit. At the summit of the volcano lie two lava domes, Akanagure (\u8d64\u30ca\u30b0\u30ec) and Mi-ike (\u5fa1\u6c60\u5cb3). Akanagure, the southern dome, produced a series of viscous lava flows that flowed down the southern and western parts of the volcano about 3500 years ago. Mi-ike is responsible for the only recorded activity. ==Historic eruptions== ===1544 eruptions=== The only recorded activity was on July 28, 1544. A moderate phreatic eruption at the Mi-ike Lava Dome produced lahars and an associated tephra layer. == See also == * Asteroid 6883 Hiuchigatake, named after Hiuchigatake * List of volcanoes in Japan ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * National catalogue of the active volcanoes in Japan: Hiuchigatake - Japan Meteorological Agency * Quaternary Volcanoes: Hiuchigatake - Geological Survey of Japan, AIST * Global Volcanism Program: Hiuchigatake - Smithsonian Institution * Volcanolive.com Category:Volcanoes of Japan Category:Active volcanoes Category:National parks of Japan Category:Mountains of Fukushima Prefecture Category:Highest points of Japanese national parks ",
