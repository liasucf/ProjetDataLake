    "text": "Pan Trafikk was a Norwegian bus company operating in and around the city of Bergen. The company was created as a merger between \u00c5sane Billag and Bilruta Fana\u2013Os\u2013Milde. The company had depots in \u00c5sane, Fana, Os and S\u00f8reide. In 1999, the company merged with Bergen Sporvei to create Gaia Trafikk,Busshistorien fortsetter bt.no November 15, 2008 which was later merged with Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap, forming Tide. The company operated buses pained red in the surrounding areas around the original municipality of Bergen. Within the old city limits Bergen Sporvei had a monopoly on bus transport with its yellow buses. North of Bergen Pan had all routes between Bergen Bus Station and \u00c5sane in addition to routes in Fana and Os. The company also operated the airport bus. The goal of Pan Trafikk was originally to operate in multiple modes of transportation (thus the name Pan, derived from the Greek Pantos meaning everywhere). This idea was instead left and focus was changed to all types of bus transport. In 1993, Pan, along with Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap, Haugaland Billag and Stavanger og Omegn Trafikkselskap Kystbussen, started a NOR-WAY Bussekspress express bus between Bergen and Stavanger. When Nordhordland Bridge opened in 1994, Pan Trafikk started cooperating with the bus company in the north, Bergen Nordhordland Rutelag, replacing the old need to change bus at the ferry quay and instead both companies operating bus routes into each other's areas. In 1998 Pan started cooperating with Bergen Sporvei, both companies operating into each other areas. This later resulted in the merger between the two and the creation of Gaia Trafikk, which merged with Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap in 2006, and is now called Tide. ==References== * Entry on \"Pan Trafikk\" Category:Defunct bus companies of Norway Category:Companies based in Bergen Category:Bus companies of Vestland Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1992 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1999 Category:1992 establishments in Norway Category:1999 disestablishments in Norway ",
