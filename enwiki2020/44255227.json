Striving for art that is affordable to all, Schellmann began publishing prints and multiples by internationally renowned artists such as Joseph Beuys, Christo, Donald Judd, Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer, Thomas Ruff, Cindy Sherman, Andy Warhol and Christopher Wool, and others. His projects have been exhibited at Paula Cooper Gallery, New York; Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Haus der Kunst, Munich; and the Nationalgalerie, Berlin. == Furniture design == In 2008, after 35 years of producing prints, objects and installation works in editions, Schellmann began to publish and produce artists' furniture followed by his own designs. The latter are influenced by the principles of industrial and commercial objects. Simultaneously, they reflect the vocabulary of minimal and conceptual art, which has shaped Schellmann's artistic development. Schellmann's furniture designs are produced and distributed by established furniture companies, such as Moroso and e15.J\u00f6rg Schellmann, e15 Design and Distributions, Retrieved 26 June 2015 == References == == External links == * Schellmann Furniture official website * Schellmann Art official website * \"J\u00f6rg Schellmann for e15\", Disegno Daily article * \"Pleasant But Not Pleasing\", article by Katharina Altemeier Category:German furniture designers Category:1944 births Category:Living people ",
