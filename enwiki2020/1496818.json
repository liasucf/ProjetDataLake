Heym manufacture shotguns, bolt action rifles, and double rifles. ==Company history== Heym was founded in Suhl, Germany by Friedrich Wilhelm Heym in July 1865. On May 24, 1891 they were issued Patent Nr. 60215 for a three barreled hunting rifle with three triggers and three hammers on the same axis. This was the birth of the first hammerless drilling. The company expanded producing drillings, shotguns, and over and under rifle-shotgun combinations. Russia was their most important export market until 1914. In 1912 Adolf Heym assumed management of the company and began shifting the export market from Russia to the USA. August Heym assumed management of the company in 1920, and began production of Anson & Deeley Drillings, double rifle drillings, drillings with three triggers, double rifles, and rifle shotgun combination guns. Following World War II in 1945, Heym made a new start in the West Germany. The factory moved to Ostheim in the Rh\u00f6n/ Lower Franconia. August and Rolf Heym oversaw the establishment of a new factory. Heym products during this time consisted of cuckoo clocks, slide rules, spinning wheels, among various other products.

Their first cold hammer forging machine \u201cAklett\u201d was purchased in 1960. Rolf Heym took over management of the company in 1963 until his death in 1972.
