Along with golf, the club also has swimming and tennis facilities. ==History== The greatest competitive moment in Ridgemoor's history came to fruition in 1942. The Hale America National Open was arranged to replace the United States Open that was canceled due to World War II, and would be staged at Ridgemoor Country Club. Sponsored by the Chicago District Golf Association, the United States Golf Association and the PGA of America, the Hale America raised over $20,000 for the Navy Relief Society and USO, and achieved legendary status thanks to its winner. Ben Hogan's 17 under par 271 across the four days, including a course record 62 in the second round, captured the Hale America by three strokes over Jimmy Demaret and Mike Turnesa. The tournament has gained some infamy, as debates ensue if the Hale America should be regarded as a U.S. Open. Officially, it is not recognized as such. ==Holes== {| align=\"center\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" !Hole # !Par !Yards |- |1 |4 |307 |- |2 |5 |493 |- |3 |5 |491 |- |4 |3 |147 |- |5 |4 |372 |- |6 |4 |410 |- |7 |4 |402 |- |8 |3 |183 |- |9 |4 |355 |} | | {| class=\"wikitable\" !Hole # !Par !Yards |- |10 |5 |518 |- |11 |5 |494 |- |12 |4 |350 |- |13 |3 |157 |- |14 |4 |326 |- |15 |4 |367 |- |16 |4 |428 |- |17 |4 |384 |- |18 |3 |152 |} |} ==References== Category:Golf clubs and courses in Chicago ",
