It is bordered to the south of the Rheinstra\u00dfe, to the west of the Schwalbacher Stra\u00dfe, north of the R\u00f6derstra\u00dfe and and to the east of the Wilhelmstrasse. These roads form a pentagon enclosing the old town of Wiesbaden. The development outside this street line did not start until the second half of the 19th century. ==Background== The Rheinstra\u00dfe (in front), Schwalbacher Stra\u00dfe (left), R\u00f6der- and Taunusstra\u00dfe (top) and Wilhelmstra\u00dfe (right) aref forming the Historical pentagon Within the pentagon of the medieval city layout is located with many historic buildings, including the City Palace of the Dukes of Nassau on Schlo\u00dfplatz and Old Town Hall and the oldest surviving building in the city dating from Roman times, the Heidenmauer (Wiesbaden) (pagan wall). The Historical pentagon goes back to the year 1818, when the Wiesbaden city builder and architect Christian Zais presented first building plans and expert evidence for an urban extension in which this approach was adopted == References == Category:Geography of Wiesbaden ",
