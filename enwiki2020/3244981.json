    "text": "This is page shows results of Canadian federal elections in Greater Vancouver and the Sunshine Coast. ==Regional profile== The city of Vancouver, along with the inner suburbs south of Burrard Inlet, tend to be very liberal and have always been heavily supportive of the New Democratic Party and Liberals. This is primarily due to a sense of liberal activism in the area (including strong support for same-sex marriage and the legalization of marijuana). Unsurprisingly, the more affluent inner city ridings in the west (Centre, Quadra) tend to favour the Liberals, while the relatively poorer eastern inner city ridings (East, Kingsway) are more supportive of the NDP. The outer suburbs farther east and north of Burrard Inlet tend to lean more in the conservative direction, although primarily only on economic issues; historically the eastern ridings were NDP strongholds until the rise of the Reform Party. Since then, the former Reform and Canadian Alliance parties did very well in those regions, although it has not necessarily translated into stronger results for the current Conservatives, who lost one seat and saw their margin decrease substantially in their three remaining seats. Vancouver houses most of the few seats in the province where the Liberals consistently do well. In 2015, however, Conservative support in Vancouver melted. The Liberals took eight seats, including all but two in Vancouver itself, while the NDP won the other five--the first time since 1968 that there were no centre-right MPs from Greater Vancouver. The Conservatives managed to retake one suburban riding in 2019, while Liberal-turned-independent Jody Wilson- Raybould retained her Vancouver seat. == 2019 - 43rd General Election == |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Burnaby North\u2014Seymour || |Terry Beech 17,770 35.50% | |Heather Leung 9,734 19.45% | |Svend Robinson 16,185 32.33% | |Amita Kuttner 4,801 9.59% | |Rocky Dong 1,079 2.16% | |Lewis Clarke Dahlby (Libert.) 219 0.44% Robert Taylor (Ind.) 271 0.54% || |Terry Beech |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Burnaby South | |Neelam Brar 10,706 23.79% | |Jay Shin 13,914 30.92% || |Jagmeet Singh 16,956 37.67% | |Brennan Wauters 2,477 5.50% | |Al Rawdah 645 1.43% | |Rex Brocki (Libert.) 246 0.55% Brian Sproule (M-L) 62 0.14% || |Jagmeet Singh |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Coquitlam\u2014Port Coquitlam || |Ron McKinnon 20,178 34.69% | |Nicholas Insley 19,788 34.01% | |Christina Gower 13,383 23.00% | |Brad Nickason 4,025 6.92% | |Roland Spornicu 703 1.21% | |Dan Iova (VCP) 98 0.17% || |Ron McKinnon |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |New Westminster\u2014Burnaby | |Will Davis 12,414 23.43% | |Megan Veck 11,439 21.59% || |Peter Julian 23,437 44.24% | |Suzanne de Montigny 4,378 8.26% | |Hansen Ginn 862 1.63% | |Neeraj Murarka (Libert.) 307 0.58% Ahmad Passyar (Ind.) 83 0.16% Joseph Theriault (M-L) 57 0.11% || |Peter Julian |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |North Vancouver || |Jonathan Wilkinson 26,979 42.87% | |Andrew Saxton 16,908 26.87% | |Justine Bell 10,340 16.43% | |George Orr 7,868 12.50% | |Azmairnin Jadavji 835 1.33% | | || |Jonathan Wilkinson |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Port Moody\u2014Coquitlam | |Sara Badiei 15,695 29.06% || |Nelly Shin 16,855 31.21% | |Bonita Zarrillo 16,702 30.93% | |Bryce Watts 3,873 7.17% | |Jayson Chabot 821 1.52% | |Roland Verrier (M-L) 57 0.11% || |Fin Donnelly\u2020 |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Vancouver Centre || |Hedy Fry 23,599 42.18% | |David Cavey 10,782 19.27% | |Breen Ouellette 13,280 23.74% | |Jesse Brown 7,002 12.52% | |Louise Kierans 724 1.29% | |Lily Bowman (Ind.) 142 0.25% John Clarke (Libert.) 379 0.68% Imtiaz Popat (Ind.) 38 0.07% || |Hedy Fry |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Vancouver East | |Kyle Demes 10,085 18.13% | |Chris Corsetti 6,724 12.09% || |Jenny Kwan 29,236 52.57% | |Bridget Burns 8,062 14.50% | |Karin Litzcke 679 1.22% | |G\u00f6l\u00f6k Z Buday (Libert.) 562 1.01% Anne Jamieson (M-L) 86 0.15% Peter Marcus (Comm.) 177 0.32% || |Jenny Kwan |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Vancouver Granville | |Taleeb Noormohamed 14,088 26.57% | |Zach Segal 11,605 21.88% | |Yvonne Hanson 6,960 13.12% | |Louise Boutin 2,683 5.06% | |Naomi Chocyk 431 0.81% || |Jody Wilson-Raybould (Ind.) 17,265 32.56% || |Jody Wilson-Raybould |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Vancouver Kingsway | |Tamara Taggart 10,194 23.08% | |Helen Quan 8,804 19.94% || |Don Davies 21,680 49.09% | |Lawrence Taylor 2,675 6.06% | |Ian Torn 427 0.97% | |Kimball Cariou (Comm.) 292 0.66% Donna Peterson (M-L) 91 0.21% || |Don Davies |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Vancouver Quadra || |Joyce Murray 22,093 43.53% | |Kathleen Dixon 14,082 27.75% | |Leigh Kenny 7,681 15.13% | |Geoff Wright 6,308 12.43% | |Sandra Filosof-Schipper 428 0.84% | |Austen Erhardt (Ind.) 162 0.32% || |Joyce Murray |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Vancouver South || |Harjit S.
