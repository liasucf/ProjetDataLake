    "text": "Radiochromic film is a type of self-developing film typically used in the testing and characterisation of radiographic equipment such as CT scanners and radiotherapy linacs. The film contains a dye which changes colour when exposed to ionising radiation, allowing the level of exposure and beam profile to be characterised. Unlike x-ray film no developing process is required and results can be obtained almost instantly, while it is insensitive to visible light (making handling easier). ==Mechanism== For medical dosimetry \"gafchromic dosimetry film (...) is arguably the most widely used commercial product\". Several types of gafchromic film are marketed with differing properties. One type, MD-55, is made up of layers of polyester substrate with active emulsion layers adhered (approximately 16\u03bcm thick). The active layer consists of polycrystalline, substituted-diacetylene and the colour change occurs due to \"progressive 1,4-trans additions as polyconjugations along the ladder-like polymer chains\". ==Usage== Radiochromic films have been in general use since the late 1960s, although the general principle has been known about since the 19th century. ===Profiling=== Radiochromic film can provide high spatial resolution information about the distribution of radiation. Depending on the scanning technique, sub-millimetre resolution can be achieved. ===Dosimetry=== Unlike many other types of radiation detector, radiochromic film can be used for absolute dosimetry where information about absorbed dose is obtained directly. It is typically scanned, for example using a standard flat bed scanner, to provide accurate quantification of the optical density and therefore degree of exposure. Gafchromic film has been shown to provide measurements accurate to 2% over doses of 0.2-100 Gray (Gy). ==References== ==Further reading== Category:Medical physics Category:Ionising radiation detectors Category:X-ray instrumentation ",
