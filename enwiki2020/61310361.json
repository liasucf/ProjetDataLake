Variety praised the film's experimental technique, commenting that the film's chronology can be debatable and its plot incoherent but this style compels, \"our imaginations to see things other than what\u2019s immediately before us\". ==See also== *2019 in film ==References== ==External links== * * * Page from the Berlin Film Festival Category:2018 horror films Category:German horror films Category:German films Category:German-language films Category:Spanish-language films Category:English-language films Category:Body horror films Category:LGBT- related horror films ",
