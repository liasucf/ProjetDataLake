    "text": "Nymphalini is a tribe of nymphalid brush-footed butterflies. Common names include admirals, anglewings, commas, and tortoiseshells, but none of these is specific to one particular genus. The name anglewing butterflies is an English translation of a Latin term papiliones angulati, [Denis & Schifferm\u00fcller], ([1775, 1776]). Based on an overall similarity in the angulate wing shape, a collective name: Papiliones angulati was employed for Papilio atalanta, P. antiopa, P. cardui, P. c-album, P. io, P. polychloros, P. urticae, P. xanthomelas, P. vaualbum, P. levana and P. prorsa. The term papiliones angulati is applied as a collective taxon name, which therefore needs no type species as specified in Article 42.3.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Papiliones angulati has thus been re-defined to apply only to a clade: Nymphalis sensu lato, and to specifically exclude Papilio atalanta [\u2192 Vanessa], P. cardui [\u2192 Cynthia], P. levana, and P. prorsa [\u2192 Araschnia]. This monophyletic group of nymphaline butterflies inhabiting the Northern Hemisphere are characterized by a jagged outline of their wings and the ability to survive the winter months as adults in an obligatory hibernal diapause, hiding in various shelters (e.g., crevices, hollows, cavities, even unheated buildings). The signature mark of all butterflies is the cryptic colour and maculation (spots) of the ventral (under) side of their wings, serving to conceal the hibernating butterfly against the substrate on which it rests. ==Genera== Listed alphabetically:Nymphalini, Tree of LifeTribe Nymphalini at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms * Aglais Dalman, 1816 \u2013 tortoiseshells * Antanartia Rothschild & Jordan, 1903 \u2013 African red admirals * Araschnia H\u00fcbner, 1819 * Hypanartia H\u00fcbner, 1821 \u2013 mapwings * Inachis \u2013 European peacock (now in Aglais) * Kaniska Moore, 1899 \u2013 blue admiral (often in Polygonia) * Mynes Boisduval, 1832 * Nymphalis Kluk, 1781 \u2013 anglewings, tortoiseshells * Polygonia H\u00fcbner, 1819 \u2013 anglewings, commas * Symbrenthia H\u00fcbner, 1819 \u2013 jesters * Vanessa Fabricius, 1807 \u2013 red admirals, Kamehameha butterflies, painted ladies The monotypic genus Tigridia is sometimes placed here as a very basal offshoot close to Colobura, sometimes in the related tribe Coeini.
