Globally he is recognized as the first person to introduce sound recording into the teaching of foreign languages, for which he started a related business in the 1890s. In Spain he is also known as a Carlist political activist and soldier. ==Family and youth== father The D\u00edez de la Cortinaduring own search please note that the name appeared in contemporary press in a variety of spelling versions: \"D\u00edez de la Cortina\", \"D\u00edez de la Cortina\", \"D\u00edez de Cortina\", \"D\u00edez de Cortina\", \"Diaz de la Cortina\", \"D\u00edaz de la Cortina\", \"Diaz de Cortina\", \"D\u00edaz de Cortina\" or \"D. de la Cortina\" family originated from Cantabria and were related to Li\u00e9bana; the first representative is noted in the 16th century.Ram\u00f3n Luis Retamero D\u00edez de la Cortina, Ra\u00edz de los D\u00edez de la Cortina procedentes de Marchena, s.l. 2013, p. 5 Forming part of hidalguia, none of the family members grew into a public figure until in the mid-18th century one of its branches moved to the Andalusian Marchena;Retamero 2013, p. 5 they settled as arrendatarios in estates of Duque de Osuna.

Memorias de su secretario, Madrid 1940, pp. 62\u201363 one author notes that no tangible results of his political mission in the US are known.\"no conocemos resultados tangibles de su actividad\", Melchor Ferrer, Historia del tradicionalismo espa\u00f1ol, vol. 28/1, Sevilla 1959, p. 231 It seems that Cortina was most active in 1896\u20131898, during the run-up to the Spanish\u2013American War. Busy in the Hispanic New York communitysome authors claim he contributed to development of Hispanic theatre in the United States; two plays issued by his publishing house as auxiliary materials to learn Spanish, Despu\u00e9s la lluvia el sol (1879) and El indiano (1893) are attributed to him with a reservation that there is no indication any of them has ever been staged, Nicol\u00e1s Kanellos, A History of Hispanic Theatre in the United States: Origins to 1940, Austin 1990, , pp. 104-105, 215 and contributing to a daily Las Novedades,full title Las Novedades. Espa\u00f1a y los Pueblos Hispano-Americanos, a review issued between 1877 and 1905. For detailed discussion of this and other Hispanic papers in New York see Vernon A. Chamberlin, Ivan A. Schulman, La Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York, New York 1976 he tried to confront the anti-Spanish frenzy of American press and complained about lack of assistance on part of Madrid, the charges which thanks to V\u00e1zquez de Mella reached the Cortes and the government in 1896.El Correo Espa\u00f1ol 18.08.96, available here Following a visit in Spain,he returned to New York in September 1896, NARA rolls T715 and M237, available online at FamilySearch service here starting 1897 Cortina changed the tone of his press endeavors; he switched to advertising the claims of Carlos VII. Thanks to his efforts few US periodicals, including New York Herald, published pieces on Carlism.see To crown Carlos, [in:] New York Herald 19.09.97, referred after El Regional 15.10.97, available here Some quoted Cortina say that 100,000 volunteers waited for an order to rise and that by January 1, 1898, Don Carlos would assume the throne, though also that the claimant would do nothing which might impair international standing of his country.see e.g. Kansas City Journal 03.10.97, available here 431 Riverside Drive (building left) In May 1898, in the midst of virulent anti-Spanish press campaign, a number of papers quoted interviews with Cortina and discussed Carlist claims as proof that the Madrid government might fall any minute. Headlineslike \"For Thirty Years He and His Followers Have Been Striving to Take Advantage of Just Such a Crisis in Spanish Affairs\", The San Francisco Call 08.05.98, available hhere and narrationlike \"it is believed there is a plot to overthrow the Spanish dynasty at once\", The Brownsville Daily Harald 07.05.98, available here helped to mobilize the American public opinion, though certainly this was not Cortina's intention.already in 1889, upon his first passport application, he signed a standard declaration that \"I will support, protect and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States against all enemies, whether domestic or foreign; and that I will bear true faith, allegiance and loyalty to the same, any ordinance, resolution or law of any State, Convention or Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding\", NARA rolls M1490 and M1372, available online at FamilySearch service here In May 1898 he transferred the realization of his prediction to June 1, 1898,The San Francisco Call 08.05.98 called the Carlists of America to join the claimant and declared he would travel to Europe shortly.Albuquerque Daily Citizen 07.05.98, available here It is not clear whether he did indeed; one source claims vaguely that he \"took part in the 1898-1899 conspiracy.\"and was even promoted to \"coronel en la conspiraci\u00f3n de 1898-1899\", Ferrer 1955 (25), p. 175 He might have been involved in shipment of arms to Carlist conspirators, though nature of his engagement is highly unclear. In 1901 a Spanish military attach\u00e9 in Washington reported to Madrid that Cortina helped him identify a cargo of 5,000 rifles, sent from New York to Lisbon and intended for a Carlist depot in Badajoz.\"En III/IV-1901, el agregado militar de la embajada espa\u00f1ola en Washington, Federico de Monteverde, localiz\u00f3 a trav\u00e9s del confidente Rafael D\u00edaz [note different spelling, which is probably irrelevant anyway] de la Cortina un presunto alijo de 5.000 fusiles Remington que eran enviados desde enero con destino a Lisboa y Badajoz (cartas de Monteverde al Ministerio de Guerra, 30-III y 9, 12 y 19-IV-1901, en SHM, Archivo General Militar, 2a Secci\u00f3n, 4a Divisi\u00f3n, leg. 125: Orden p\u00fablico: Movimiento carlista, 1837-1906 y carta del embajador en Washington, 20-IV-1901, en AMAE, Pol\u00edtica Interior, leg.

Though also in the 20th century Cortina frequently visited Spain,at least in 1905, 1908, 1910, 1913, 1929, 1930, 1934, 1935. When in Spain he used to give lectures on languages, compare Nuevo Diario de Badajoz 25.01.05, available here he was hardly reported as engaged in Carlist activities,the thread identified was his engagement in building a monument to Juan Vazqyez de Mella. In 1930 he donated money, see La Epoca 01.01.30, available here, and in 1934 he was present in Cangas de Oniz attending a feast related to unveiling of the bust, El Siglo Futuro 24.08.34, available here focused on promotion of his linguistic business.though until death he publicly used the \"Count of Olaeta\" title, at least in the United States, and this is how he was also referred to in the press, see e.g. Middletown Times Herald 24.06.39, available here During resurgence of Carlism in the 1930s he was not mentioned in party propaganda.e.g. a luxury 1933 publication celebrating a centenary of Carlism published a brief note on his father, his brother and his cousin, but contained no mention of Rafael, see [Juan Mar\u00eda Roma], Album historico del Carlismo, Barcelona 1933 ==Linguist and businessman== Edison and phonograph In the early 1880s Cortina commenced teaching Spanish. His own marketingThe Evening Post 30.09.93, available here and independent reviews alikeCortina Looks Towards Racks, [in:] Billboard 25.04.64, p. 6, available here claimed that Cortina Institute of Languages was set up in 1882. Throughout the 1880s he was rather noted as giving lessonsthough apparently he already made his name as a teacher; 1886 he had his apartment at 131 West Street 31 robbed, including money and business cards; the burglar later pretended to be him before apprehended, The Sun 15.10.86, available here offered by other institutions, e.g. in 1887 by Brooklyn LibraryThe Brooklyn Daily Eagle 30.10.87, available here or in 1889 by Brooklyn YMCA.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle 14.10.89, available here The breakthrough work which helped him launch own business was the 1889 publication titled The Cortina Method to Learn Spanish in Twenty Lessons.Carl G. Franz\u00e9n, Foreign Language in the Curriculum, [in:] Bulletin of the School of Education Indiana University 34 (1958), p. 17, referred after Patricia Sue Bryant, A Study of the Development of Secondary School Modern Language Programs in the United States [MA thesis Kansas State University], Manhattan 1965, p. 23 Instead of systematically mastering linguistic structures, deemed laborious and inefficient,he wrote: \"It is a well-known fact that, by the old methods of study, only a few students obtain any degree of fluency in speaking a language that is foreign to them. It is true th t many of them can, after a number of years spent in study, conjugate, decline, analyze, and perhaps translate a sentence into English, but they are seldom able to put an English sentence into an idiomatic foreign one. Such learning, although laboriously acquired, is of little practical value, end the tourist or commercial traveller finds himself in an awkward dilemma when forced to ask for even the everyday necessaries of life in a foreign tongue\", quoted after Bryant 1965, p. 24 Cortina - claiming to be M.A. graduate of University of MadridThe Evening Post 18.10.90, available here \\- focused on practical skills. In 1891 he was already boasting a program based on \"the Cortina method\",The Evening Post 10.10.91, available here and in 1892 the Cortina School of Languages started to advertise.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle 09.10.92, available here Indeed, it seems to have been an established business already. Set in two locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan, the school offered 9 languages,not only Spanish but also English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Latin and Greek taught in 20 lessons by native instructors.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle 09.10.92, available here It is not clear whether from the onset \"the Cortina method\" entailed mechanically-aided learning. Some claim that already in the mid-1880s Cortina experimented with phonograph recordings, possibly in co-operation with Thomas Edison.Kenji Kitao, The History of Language Laboratories. Origin and Establishment [working paper of Doshisha University], Kyoto 1995, p. 5 It was in 1893 that his method was reported in The Phonogram, an academic journal,Kitao 1995, p. 6 and he became the first person to use phonograph for foreign language instruction.Kitao 1995, pp. 6-7 It soon became a second leg of his business, as on-site learning was paired with development of self-learning correspondence courses and production of related aid materials. They consisted of two types. One was own textbooks; they contained excerpts from literary works,perhaps the first to be named are two plays he fathered himself: Despues de la lluvia el sol (comedy in 1 act) and El Indiano (comedy in 3 acts inspired by Ricardo Garc\u00eda de la Vega). The remaining ones are novels (Amparo by Enrique P\u00e9rez Escrich), collections of stories (El Final de Norma by Alarc\u00f3n, Temprano y con sol, forwarded by Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n, El Molinerillo) or brief accounts of historical events from Spanish history (Episodios en espa\u00f1ol y anotados en ingl\u00e9s). They were edited in Spanish and English on opposing pages, most of them published by his own publishing house, R. D. Cortina Company though also phrases tailored for daily usage.most are styled after his first highly successful Spanish in Twenty Lessons: Ingl\u00e9s en Veinte Lecciones, French in Twenty Lessons, Franc\u00e9s en Veinte Lecciones, Espa\u00f1ol en Espa\u00f1ol, English in English, Francais en Francais, Deutsch auf Deutsch, Italiano in Italiano, English in English with Key in Portuguese. Another category were dictionaries, like Verbos espa\u00f1oles: diccionario de la conjugaci\u00f3n castellana, Cortina\u2019s Spanish-English and English-Spanish Vest Pocket Dictionary and Instructor. Finally, he published letter-writing guides, best known Modelo para cartas en espa\u00f1ol (with prologue by V\u00e1zquez de Mella). He reacted to ongoing events quickly and demonstrated lots of flexibility. When the American troops landed on European shores in 1917, he had already published Cortina French-English Military Manual, Cortina French-English Military Dictionary, Cortina French-English Red Cross Instructor and Cortina Soldier\u2019s Map of the French Front and Handy War Guide for My Company, compare Jean A. Picard, Cortina French-English Military Manual, New York 1917, p. 278 Another one was recordings. Initially phonograph-intended cylinders were used;Kitao 1995, p. 6 first branded by Cortina, after 1896 they were made by Edison's National Phonographic Company.Kitao 1995, pp. 6-7 In 1908 he registered the trademark of Cortinaphone, selling own brand of phonograph, and since 1913 his company started to issue flat round recordings.Kitao 1995, p. 6 The Cortina school kept using English for instruction until 1920, when they switched to target language only.Kitao 1995, pp. 6-7 Around 1920 he was marketing \"Cortina phonograph outfit\", advertised as more efficient than teaching by instructors.Picard 1917, p. 276 Cortinaphone advert, 1910 Cortina's language business proved rather successful.though already in the late 1890s Cortina was by no means the single company offering recording-aided correspondence courses on the US market. Similar business was developed by Richard S. Rosenthal as The Meisterschaft System (later dubbed also Rosenthal Method and Language Phone Method) and by Thomas J. Forster, known as International Correspondence School of Scranton, Kitao 1995, p. 9 His method of teaching was awarded corporate prizes;1893 he was awarded prize by Dept of Liberal Arts at Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1901 at Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, Picard 1917, p. 277 the school \u2013 since 1899 named Cortina Academy of LanguagesThe Brooklyn Daily Eagle 06.10.99, available here \\- made arrangements with prestigious New York collegese.g. the Long Island Business College, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle 09.09.00, available here and had to rent bigger and bigger premises at prestigious downtown locations;in 1912 he claimed that due to \"tremendous success\" Cortine offices were moved to a new, more spacious and more prestigious location in central Manhattan, The Sun 10.03.12, available here other teaching institutions advertised themselves as adhering to his methodology;The Sun 13.01.18, available here the publishing house he set up kept re-printing textbooks and manuals in endless editions while audio materials were published jointly with Columbia Records.The Evening World 23.08.18, available here Correspondence courses of English proved successful in South America and Mexico.Kitao 1995, p. 6. The students were also in position to record their spoken language and send cylinders to New York Cortina's office for evaluation of their progress Cortina business developed also in Spain, as the owner was granted official governmental recommendation and remained on good terms with education officials.in 1899 Cortina\u2019s textbooks obtained official recommendation of Ministerio de Ultramar. An anonymous author appearing as \"El buscador de historias\" claims also he obtained official recommendation of \"el rey\", a reference which against general backgroung of the article seems to point to Alfonso XIII (and not Carlos VII, who indeed provided such a recommendation), see La academia de idiomas \u201eMade in Spain\u201d que se anticip\u00f3 100 a\u00f1os a los m\u00e9todos a distancia, [in:] Memoria de Marchena service, available here His teaching method enjoyed largely positive reception among academics of that time;see letters published in Picard 1917, pp. 277-279 also contemporary scholars note that it \"marks a great advance in language teaching\".Frenzen 1958, pp. 17-18, Bryant 1965, p. 24 The language school he created was later renamed to Cortina Institute of Languages and is operational until today.see the official website of Cortina Institute of Languages, available here ==See also== * Carlism * Traditionalism (Spain) * Language education * Jos\u00e9 D\u00edez de la Cortina y Olaeta * Jos\u00e9 D\u00edez de la Cortina y Cerrato ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * B. de Artagan [Reinaldo Brea], D.
