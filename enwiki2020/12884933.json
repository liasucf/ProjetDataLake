    "text": "Pearl TD2000. Optional wire mesh grill. With canopy up. The TD2000 is a retro- classic roadster styled after the MG TD. It is produced by TD Cars (Malaysia) Pte. Ltd., a private limited company incorporated in 1998. The company acquired the rights, intellectual properties and trademarks associated with the production of the TD2000 Roadster. The car is assembled in Malaysia today and exported overseas. It is available in Japan, Australia, Brunei, New Zealand, India, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Scotland, Ireland, England and the Middle East. == History == The idea of creating a retro- classic to pay homage to the 1950s British entry-level sports car MG TD based on a modern Japanese drivetrain. The roadster originated in 1986 using Nissan components and original MG TD jigs, dies and moulds. Australian Classic Cars (ACC), under Westmex, created the chassis, improved on other technical aspects and creature comfort. Gason of Ararat, under contract with ACC, successfully produced and launched about 100 vehicles in Australia. However, sales were unprofitable so the car arm of the company changed ownership several times until TD Cars acquired it and moved the production to Malaysia. Under the new management, TD2000s expanded beyond its border. == Design == Today, the TD2000 roadster consists of 2 models, a Silverstone comes with a 5-speed manual shift and Gatsby with a 4-speed automatic gear. It sits on a steel chassis and is equipped with an independent double wishbone front suspension, a leaf-spring back axle and all-round disc brakes, delivering better handling and smoother ride than the original. Many local OEM engineers were contracted to study and build a complete suspension system with softer absorbers and 3-leaf springs, colder air-conditioning unit, and integrate a double-core radiator into the cooling system. Its fiber glass bodywork incorporates side intrusion bars, is protected by stainless steel bumpers. With a 2-liter Toyota 3S-FE engine developing 130bhp, the rear-wheel drive roadster delivers better performance than its predecessor. Power-to-weight ratio is superb as the roadster weighs less than 1 ton. Standard features come with spoked wheels, walnut-burr dashboard, mohair soft-top and integrated roll-over bar. Options include leather trims, air-conditioning, wooden Motolita steering wheel, stainless steel luggage rack and roll bar. The National Automobile Museum at Sepang International Circuit houses a pearl-blue Silverstone for public viewing. ==References== ==External links== Category:Vehicles of Malaysia Category:Retro-style automobiles Category:Malaysian brands Category:Privately held companies of Malaysia ",
