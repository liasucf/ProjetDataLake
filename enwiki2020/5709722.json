It is situated by the side of river Narmada and is approximately 20 km from Jabalpur city. Its most famous sights are the Dhuandhar Falls, Marble Rocks, and the Chaunsath Yogini temple. The temple is one of the four major extant temples containing carvings of sixty four yogini, female yoga mystics. It was built in the 10th century under the Kalachuris. It commands a view of the whole area around and of the river flowing through the marble rocks. Its major attraction is a waterfall known as Dhuandhar, which looks like smoke coming out of the river and therefore it got its name as \"Dhuan(smoke)-dhar(flow of water)\". Another major attraction is 'Bandar Kodini', when one travels in between the marble rocks in a boat, the mountains at both the sides at one point come so close that the monkeys are able to jump across them, hence the name \"Bandar Kodini\". In a moonlit night, the travel between the marble rock mountains in a boat on the river Narmada is one of the popular tourist attractions here. Bhedaghat is famous for its jumpers. ==Demographics== India census, Bhedaghat had a population of 1840. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%.
