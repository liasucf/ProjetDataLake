    "text": "Action for Global Health Action for Global Health was formed by 15 non- governmental organisations and charities in 2006. Current partners are based in Brussels, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the UK and has over 30 member NGOs across these countries. Interact Worldwide provides the overall co-ordination for the network. Action For Global Health Official Webpage == Objectives == The overarching goal of Action for Global Health is increased support from Europe to enable developing countries to make substantial progress towards the health Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Action for Global Health's members are monitoring the actions and policies of European governments for how they affect health in developing countries, influencing decision-makers to improve their practice and be inviting other NGOs and civil society organisations to join with the Action for Global Health to build a European campaign. The Action for Global Health wants to see our governments, the private sector and European institutions fulfill the promises they have made on reducing rates of infant and maternal mortality and slowing down the spread of transmissible diseases in the world's poorest countries. In particular, the Action for Global Health wants to see much greater support for the development and strengthening of health systems, through proper financing, retention of staff and ensuring equitable access. Three Main Goals: * Increased commitment and action from European governments \u2013 primarily the EU institutions, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, United Kingdom and Spain - to support the achievement of the Health MDGs in low and middle-income countries; including higher and better-focused financial contributions to health and health system strengthening. * Increased capacity, engagement and effectiveness of European NGOs\u2019 advocacy in support of the Health MDGs, with improved policy analysis and networking with the NGO and development policy community (recognising the role of health as a key lever of development). * Increased support from European civil society and the private sector for the achievement of the Health MDGs in low and middle-income countries, including a higher profile for global health in European media. == Publications == In 2007, Action for Global Health partners published their first set of policy reports \"Health Warning\" in six different versions: Brussels, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK: * Brussels report - Health Warning (EU version) Why Europe must act now to rescue the health Millennium Development Goals. Action for Global Health is concerned that Europe is not yet doing enough to support developing countries achieve the health MDGs by 2015. The focus of this first report is on funding provided by European governments for health in developing countries through their Official Development Assistance (ODA). * French report - Health Warning Le sujet de ce rapport porte sur les financements de l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et aux soins de sant\u00e9 dans les pays en d\u00e9veloppement. Ce rapport montre que la faiblesse des budgets allou\u00e9s \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 par les gouvernements europ\u00e9ens accentue les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s dans ce domaine entre pays d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s pays en d\u00e9veloppement. * German report - Health Warning Im Mittelpunkt dieses ersten Berichts stehen die von den europ\u00e4ischen Regierungen durch ihre \u00f6ffentliche Entwicklungshilfe (ODA) bereitgestellten Mittel f\u00fcr Gesundheit in den Entwicklungsl\u00e4ndern. * Italian Report - Allarme Salute The Italian edition of the Action for Global Health report \"Health Warning\" was launched in Rome on 18 September. Allarme Salute presents a study about what Italian Government has been doing since 2000 on financing MDGs focusing on health and which are the most important issues to face in this field. * Spanish Report - Health Warning ALERTA DE SALUD: Por qu\u00e9 Europa debe actuar ya para cumplir los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio en materia de salud. Acci\u00f3n por la Salud Global est\u00e1 preocupada porque Europa no est\u00e1 haciendo lo necesario para que los pa\u00edses en desarrollo cumplan los ODM de salud para 2015. El enfoque de este primer informe se centra en la financiaci\u00f3n que los gobiernos europeos est\u00e1n destinando a trav\u00e9s de la AOD a la salud para los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Adem\u00e1s, incluye un an\u00e1lisis espec\u00edfico sobre los compromisos de Espa\u00f1a con los ODM de salud. * UK - Health Warning Why Europe and the UK must act now to rescue the health Millennium Development Goals. This version of the report includes a chapter on the UK's role in financing the health MDGs and calls on the UK Government to prioritise this area early in order to enable developing countries achieve the health MDGs by 2015. == Funding == The network was initiated through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as part of their support for global health advocacy. Similar networks on reproductive health, Malaria and Tuberculosis have been funded. == Partners == When established in 2006 the grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was administered by Action Aid as the European Network on Global Health. At the first meeting of network staff funded by the grant, in Paris in February 2007, the partners established the name Action for Global Health and a three line tag line to outline its vision and purpose: Full Funding, Strong Systems, Fair Access. At this time the partners were: EU - Brussels: European Public Health Alliance, Marie-Stopes International, Stop Aids Alliance France: M\u00e9decins du Monde, Global Health Advocates Germany: Terre des hommes (Hilfe f\u00fcr kinder in Not), Welthungerhilfe Italy: AIDOS, CESTAS Spain: Medicos del mundo, Spanish Association of Family Planning UK: International HIV AIDS Alliance, Interact, TB Alert, After the first full period of funding from the BMGF for AFGH ended in 2011 it was renewed with Plan Interact administering the grant to the network in place of Action Aid. Latterly the 15 partner organisations across six European countriesare: * Interact Worldwide (Network coordinator) * Action Aid Italia * The Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) * Stop AIDS Alliance * Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevoelkerung (DSW) * Terre des hommes * Federaci\u00f3n de Planificaci\u00f3n Familiar Estatal * M\u00e9dicos del Mundo * Global Health Advocates * Oxfam Germany * Plan International * Associazione Italiana Donne per lo Sviluppo * Stop Aids Now! * International HIV/AIDS Alliance * The European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development (Network Partner) == References == == External links == * World health Organization * UN Millennium Development Goals * Millennium Campaign * Global Call for Action Against Poverty (GCAP) * UN Millennium Indicators * Global Health Council * European Foundation Center * European Partnership for Global Health * OECD DAC * European Alliance Against Malaria * Global Healthcare Information for All by 2015 Category:European medical and health organizations Category:Development organizations Category:Health campaigns ",
