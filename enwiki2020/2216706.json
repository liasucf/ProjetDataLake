    "text": "Joey Murcia Jr (born April 25, 1979), known professionally as Giuseppe Andrews is a former American film actor, screenwriter, director, and singer-songwriter known for his roles as Lex in the 1999 film Detroit Rock City, a bizarre sheriff's deputy in Cabin Fever (2002), a small role in Never Been Kissed (1999), as well as appearances in The Smashing Pumpkins videos \"1979\" and \"Perfect\". Andrews has been involved in writing, directing, scoring, editing, shooting and producing a number of avant-garde films, and has directed several experimental independent movies. As of 2015, Andrews' whereabouts are unknown and he has ceased acting and songwriting. ==Biography== Andrews was born as Joey Murcia Jr. in Key Largo, Florida. His cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9-meets-exploitation filmmaking style has been compared to that of John Waters and Harmony Korine. He grew up in trailer parks, which feature prominently, along with their inhabitants, in many of his films. He also spent time living in a van with his father before they were both cast in an infomercial, which led to more acting jobs for Giuseppe. Director Adam Rifkin has said of Andrews \"Giuseppe Andrews is the most ferociously original filmmaker working in cinema today. No matter what new things he tries, everything is always signature Giuseppe Andrews. He is a true auteur.\" Andrews reprised his role as a sheriff's deputy in the Cabin Fever sequel Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever (2009). He also appeared in the ninth season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, in the episode titled \"Let It Bleed\". Andrews has entirely disappeared from the public eye as of 2015. He was last seen in a local bar he frequented acting erratic and out of sorts. He left his trailer to formerly homeless actor and friend, Walt Dongo. No one is sure of the whereabouts of Andrews nor his girlfriend Mary Beth. Andrews' website has been deactivated since 2015, and it's been reported that all his personal films have been destroyed as well. As of 2020, he is living in Nevada, no longer with Mary Beth, and just wants to be left alone. ==Filmography== ===Director=== * Touch Me in the Morning (1999) * In Our Garden (2002) * Trailer Town (2003) * Dad's Chicken (2003) * Air Conditioning (2003) * Wiggly Harris (2003) * After School Specials (2003) * Monkey (2004) * Actor (2004) * Babysitter (2004) * The Date Movie (2004) * Who Flung Poo?
