    "text": "The 2019 North Dakota Fighting Hawks football team represented the University of North Dakota during the 2019 NCAA Division I FCS football season. Led by sixth-year head coach Bubba Schweigert, they played their home games at the Alerus Center. They finished the season 7\u20135. They received an at-large bid to the FCS Playoffs, where they would lose to Nicholls in the first round. The Fighting Hawks left the Big Sky Conference in 2018 to join the non-football Summit League, with the football program joining the Missouri Valley Football Conference in 2020. Although being classified as an independent for football in 2018 and 2019, they continued to play a full Big Sky schedule, and their games counted in the conference standings for their opponents. The Fighting Hawks were ineligible to win the conference championship. ==Previous season== The Fighting Hawks finished the 2018 season with a record of 6\u20135. ==Schedule== ==Game summaries== ===Drake=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 2\u20130 | 2015 | W, 21\u201318 |} ===at North Dakota State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 62\u201346\u20133 | 2015 | L, 9\u201334 |} ===Sam Houston State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 1\u20130 | 2018 | W, 24\u201323 |} ===at Eastern Washington=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 0\u20134 | 2017 | L, 14\u201321 |} ===UC Davis=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 3\u20135 | 2017 | L, 24\u201348 |} ===at Idaho State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 5\u20132 | 2018 | L, 21\u201325 |} ===at Cal Poly=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 6\u20135 | 2018 | W, 31\u201324 |} ===Montana State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 15\u201319\u20131 | 2017 | L, 21\u201349 |} ===at Weber State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 1\u20133 | 2018 | L, 30\u201335 |} ===Northern Colorado=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 19\u201312 | 2018 | W, 38\u201313 |} ===Southern Utah=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 4\u20135 | 2017 | L, 21\u201347 |} ==FCS Playoffs== The Fighting Hawks were selected for the postseason tournament, with a first-round pairing against Nicholls. ===at Nicholls\u2013First Round=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" |colspan=3|First meeting |} ==Ranking movements== ==References== North Dakota Category:North Dakota Fighting Hawks football seasons North Dakota North Dakota Fighting Hawks football ",
