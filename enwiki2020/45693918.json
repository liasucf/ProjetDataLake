He has released two albums for the label: Michael Ray and Amos. ==Biography== Ray was born in Eustis, Florida. He was inspired by his grandfather Amos \"Wilson\" Roach, who played music for him and taught him how to play guitar, in addition to having him perform at assisted living centers. Ray chose to form a band in southern Florida after graduating high school, and a disc jockey at WPCV began playing his music. He independently released an album in 2010, which was discovered by manager Tony Conway. Ray was mentored by John Rich of Big & Rich on the singing competition The Next: Fame Is at Your Doorstep, which he won. He and Rich co-wrote Big & Rich's 2015 single, \"Run Away with You\". After winning the competition, Ray was signed to Warner Bros. Records Nashville. The label released his debut single \"Kiss You in the Morning\", which went to number one on the Country Airplay charts in 2015. The album accounted for two more singles in \"Real Men Love Jesus\" and \"Think a Little Less\". Ray supported the album with a tour. Ray's second album, Amos, released in 2018. The album has accounted for three singles: \"Get to You\", \"One That Got Away\" and \"Her World or Mine\". Both of his albums were produced by Scott Hendricks. ==Personal life== On July 19, 2018, Ray announced that he was dating fellow country singer Carly Pearce. They became engaged on December 19, 2018. The two were married on October 6, 2019 near Nashville, Tennessee. On June 19, 2020, after eight months of marriage, they agreed to divorce. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details ! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Sales |- style=\"font- size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US ! style=\"width:4em;\"| AUS |- ! scope=\"row\"| Michael Ray | * Release date: January 29, 2010 * Label: Self-released * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Michael Ray | * Release date: August 7, 2015 * Label: Atlantic Nashville * Formats: CD, digital download | 4 | 21 | 60 | * US: 51,000 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Amos | * Release date: June 1, 2018 * Label: Atlantic Nashville * Formats: CD, digital download | 5 | 53 | \u2014 | *US: 16,600 |- | colspan=\"6\" style=\"font- size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |- |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Heat |- ! scope=\"row\"| Tour Bootleg | * Release date: November 2014 * Label: Warner Bros.
