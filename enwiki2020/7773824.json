    "text": "Charles William Wikle (; born December 15, 1978) is an American actor and reality television personality best known for his appearance in the fifth American season of Big Brother. He was an openly gay contestant in the reality series. (The source incorrectly states Wikle was the \"first\" openly gay contestant on the show. Bill \"Bunky\" Miller from Season 2 (2001) holds that distinction.) Wikle parlayed his Big Brother notoriety into a gig as co-host of the Logo network travel-themed program, Round Trip Ticket. Wikle was a contestant on Bravo's sports/reality series Battle of the Network Reality Stars. In 2008, Wikle was cast as the villain, Jasper, in the gay spoof sequel, Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild!, released December 9, 2008. In 2016, Wikle starred in the gay adult film The Stillest Hour for CockyBoys. ==Credits== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Year !Title !Role !class=\"unsortable\"|Notes |- |2004 |Big Brother |Himself - Houseguest |Season 5 |- |2005 |Round Trip Ticket |Host | |- |2005 |Battle of the Network Reality Stars |Himself | |- |2008 |Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild! |Jasper | |- |2016 |The Stillest Hour |Psychotherapist | |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American actors in gay pornographic films Category:American nurses Category:Big Brother (American TV series) contestants Category:Gay actors Category:Male nurses ",
