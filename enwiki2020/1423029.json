    "text": "Tortoise Beats Hare is a 1941 Merrie Melodies animated short supervised and laid out by Tex Avery (solely supervisal credited as \"Fred A-Very\" and read by Bugs Bunny). It was released on March 15, 1941. The short, loosely based on the Aesopian fable The Tortoise and the Hare, stars Bugs Bunny and, in his first appearance, Cecil Turtle. ==Plot== As the opening credits appear, Bugs Bunny comes on the screen while eating an obligatory carrot and absent- mindedly begins reading them, grossly mispronouncing all of them in the process (e.g. for \"Avery\" over the correct ) except for the word \"story,\" the first names of Dave Monahan and Fred Avery, and all of Carl W. Stalling's name. As he finishes, he sees the name of the cartoon and becomes exasperated, spitting out his mouthful of the carrot he was eating. After a brief tirade involving ripping apart the opening credits, he finds Cecil Turtle and bets him ten dollars he can win against him in a race. Cecil accepts and, after Bugs takes a big lead, hurries to a telephone center, to a phone intended for turtles only, and rings up his cousins on a telephone, devises a scheme in which they will double as him at significant points along the track while he himself crosses the finish line ahead of Bugs. The plan works, with Bugs being befuddled at what looks like Cecil always being one step ahead of him. After reaching the finish line, thinking he's won, Bugs finds Cecil waiting for him, the apparent victor. Bugs, both furious and perplexed, pays Cecil his owed ten dollars. As Bugs somberly walks away, he suddenly wonders if he'd been tricked. When he turns around, Cecil and his cousins, each with one of the ten dollars in hand, say to him in unison, \"Ehhh, it's a possibility,\" and all of them then kiss Bugs. ==See also== * Tortoise Wins by a Hare * Rabbit Transit ==Availability== *DVD - Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2, Disc One *Blu-ray/DVD - Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2, Disc Two ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1941 films Category:1941 short films Category:1941 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:1940s animated short films Category:Films directed by Tex Avery Category:Running films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American films Category:Self-reflexive films Category:Works based on fables Category:American animated short films Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny Category:Films produced by Leon Schlesinger Category:Warner Bros. animated short films, 1940s ",
