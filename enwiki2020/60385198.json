The problems came after that. I got myself excluded of everything and even if I put a doormat covering my face, they would not let me step on the scene. I only once crossed the stage wearing pointed sneakers, and still in the background. \" - to which she sought to circumvent, as she said on another occasion: \"Everything was always very difficult, but who would assume or make it clear that part of my difficulties was because I was not white? They would never tell me this, or say that the problem was racial, but I knew it was, and so I always struggled every time to try to perfect myself. \" She the went to join the Teatro Experimental do Negro as a dancer, then as collaborator and eventually as a choreographer .
