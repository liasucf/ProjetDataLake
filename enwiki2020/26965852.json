The lyrics of the song: :About four years ago I was digging the land :With me brogues on me feet and me spade in me hand :Says I to me self, what a pity to see, :Such a fine strapping lad footing turf round Tralee ::CHORUS ::With me too rum a na, with me too rum a na, ::With me too rum an urum an urum a na. :Well I buttered me brogues, an' shook hands with me spade, :An' away to the fair, like a dashing young blade :When up comes a sergeant an he asks me to 'list, :Dhera, sergeant a ghr\u00e1, stick a bob in me fist! ::CHORUS :Now the first thing they gave me it was a red coat, :With a wide strap of leather to tie round me throat :Then they gave me a quare thing, I asked what was that, :They told me it was a cockade for me hat ::CHORUS :The next thing they gave me, they called it a gun, :With powder an ball an' a place for me thumb. :Well first she spat fire, and then she spewed smoke, :An' she gave me oul shoulders a hell of a stroke ::CHORUS :Well the first place they sent me was down by the sea, :On board of a warship bound for the Crimea :Three sticks in the middle all rowled round with sheets, :Faith, she walked on the water without any feet! ::CHORUS :When at Balaclava we landed quite sound, :Cold, wet and hungry we lay on the ground :Next morning for action the bugle did call, :And we had a hot breakfast of powder and ball ::CHORUS :Well we fought at the Alma, likewise Inkermann, :But the Russians they whiled us at the Redan :In scalin' the walls there, meself lost an eye, :And a big Russian bullet ran away with me thigh. ::CHORUS :Well they brought me a doctor, he soon staunched me blood, :Then they gave me an elegant leg made of wood. :They gave me a medal and tenpence a day, :Contented with S\u00edle, I'll live on half pay. ::CHORUS ==References== Category:Irish songs Category:1915 songs Category:The Dubliners songs ",
