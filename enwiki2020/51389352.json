    "text": "Pydio, formerly known as AjaXplorer, is an open-source file-sharing and synchronisation software that runs on the user's own server or in the cloud. == Presentation == The project was created by musician Charles Du Jeu (current CEO and CTO) in 2007 under the name AjaXplorer. The name was changed in 2013 and became Pydio (an acronym for Put Your Data in Orbit). In May 2018, Pydio switched from PHP to Go with the release of Pydio Cells. PHP version reached end-of-life state on 31 December, 2019. Pydio runs on any server supporting a recent Go version. The current offering of Pydio, known as Pydio Cells, has been developed from scratch using the Go programming language. Nevertheless, the web-based interface of Cells is very similar to the one from Pydio 8 (in PHP), and it successfully replicates most of the features, while adding a few more. There is also a new synchronisation client (also written in Go). The PHP version is being phased out as the company's focus is moving to Pydio Cells, with community feedback on the new features. According to the company, the switch to the new environment was made \"to overcome inherent PHP limitations and provide you with a future-proof and modern solution for collaborating on documents\". From a technical point of view, Pydio differs from solutions such as Google Drive or Dropbox. Pydio is not based on a public cloud, the software indeed connects to the user's existing storages (SAN / Local FS, SAMBA / CIFS, (s)FTP, NFS, etc...) as well as to the existing user directories (LDAP / AD, SAML, Radius, Shibboleth...), which allows companies to keep their data inside their infrastructure, according to their data security policy and user rights management. The software is built in a modular perspective; various plugins allow administrators to implement extra features. Pydio is available either through a community distribution, or an Enterprise Distribution. == Features == * File sharing between different internal users and across other Pydio instances * SSL/TLS Encryption * WebDAV file server * Creation of dedicated workspaces, for each line of business / project / client, with a dedicated user rights management for each workspace. * File-sharing with external users (private links, public links, password protection, download limitation, etc.) * Online viewing and editing of documents with Collabora Office * Preview and editing of image files * Integrated audio and video reader Client applications are available for all major desktop and mobile platforms. == See also == * Comparison of file synchronization software == References == == External links == * * (Pydio Cells) * (Pydio Cells Synchronisation Client) * (Pydio PHP version, to be deprecated after December 2020) Category:Cloud computing Category:Cloud storage Category:File hosting Category:Free software for cloud computing Category:Free software programmed in PHP Category:Free software programmed in Go ",
