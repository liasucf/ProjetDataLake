    "text": "The Uckermark concentration camp was a small German concentration camp for girls near the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp in F\u00fcrstenberg/Havel, Germany and then an \"emergency\" extermination camp. ==Overview== The camp was opened in May 1942 as a detention camp for girls, aged 16 to 21, who were considered criminal or difficult. Girls who reached the upper age limit were transferred to the Ravensbr\u00fcck women's camp. Camp administration was provided by the Ravensbr\u00fcck camp. In its early years, the head overseer at Uckermark was a woman named Lotte Toberentz, and one other Aufseherin (female warden) is known today by the name of Johanna Braach. Both of these women were tried by a British court at the Third Ravensbruck Trial.Silke Schaefer: the self- understanding of women in the camps. The camp Ravensbr\u00fcck. Berlin 2002 ( thesis pdf ) In January 1945, the juveniles' camp was closed and the infrastructure was subsequently used as an extermination camp for \"women who were sick, no longer efficient, and over 52 years old\".A.

Over 5,000 women were murdered there; only 500 women and children survived. Though it was shut down in March 1945 the Soviets liberated the camp on the night of April 29\u201330, 1945. Today only very few structures of the camp lie in ruins, barely recognizable. Some of the responsible SS wardens of the camp, amongst them chief warden (Oberaufseherin) Ruth Neudeck, were tried in the Third Ravensbr\u00fcck Trial, called the \"Uckermark trial\". == See also == * German Resistance to Nazism * Glossary of Nazi Germany * The Holocaust * List of books about Nazi Germany * List of concentration and internment camps * List of Nazi-German concentration camps * Nazi concentration camps * Nazi Party * Nazi songs * World War II == References == == External links == * S.
