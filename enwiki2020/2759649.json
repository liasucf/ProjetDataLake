    "text": "Changesonebowie is a compilation album by English rock musician David Bowie, issued by RCA Records in 1976. It collected songs from the 1969\u20131976 period, including the first LP appearance of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\". A \"sax version\" of this song, cut during the Aladdin Sane sessions in 1973, appeared on the first 1000 copies of the UK pressing (identified by the lack of the RCA logo in the upper-right corner of the cover). Later pressings of Changesonebowie featured the original version of the single that had been recorded and released in 1972. All US pressings of the LP contain this original version as well. Two of the tracks, \"Ziggy Stardust\" and \"Suffragette City\", had never been released as singles when Changesonebowie was issued, though the former had been the B-side of \"The Jean Genie\" in November 1972 and the latter would be released as an A-side in July 1976 to help promote the compilation. The cover shot was taken by Tom Kelley, who took the famous nude calendar photographs of Marilyn Monroe on red velvet in 1949. The album was followed up by a companion compilation, Changestwobowie, in 1981. ==Album history== RCA Records reissued Changesonebowie on CD in 1984, but it was withdrawn shortly afterwards, along with the rest of Bowie's RCA catalogue, due to a conflict between Bowie and RCA. The RCA CD contains the original single version of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\". When the Bowie catalogue was reissued by Rykodisc beginning in 1990, Changesonebowie was replaced by a new compilation, Changesbowie, on which \"Fame\" was superseded by the \"Gass Mix\" of \"Fame 90\" (produced and remixed by Jon Gass) and \"'Heroes'\", \"Ashes to Ashes\", \"Fashion\", \"Let's Dance\", \"China Girl\", \"Modern Love\", and \"Blue Jean\" were added. In addition to the above, Rykodisc added the songs \"Starman\" (following \"Space Oddity\"), \"Life on Mars?\" (following \"The Jean Genie\"), and \"Sound and Vision\" (following \"Golden Years\") to the cassette and double-LP editions of the album. A remastered edition of the original Changesonebowie compilation was released on 20 May 2016, on vinyl and CD, to mark its 40th anniversary. On 13 April 2018, Changesonebowie was released in digital/streaming formats, along with a newly remastered edition of its follow-up, Changestwobowie, on vinyl, CD and digital/streaming. The cover provided the inspiration for the 2009 expanded edition of the Morrissey album Southpaw Grammar. ==Acclaim== In 1987, as part of their 20th anniversary, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it number 96 on \"The Top 100 Albums of the Last Twenty Years.\" In 2003, the album was ranked number 425 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * David Bowie \u2013 vocals, guitars, keyboards, saxophone, harmonica, stylophone, Moog, Mellotron, backing vocals * Tim Renwick \u2013 guitar (side one-1) * Mick Wayne \u2013 guitar (side one-1) * Rick Wakeman \u2013 mellotron (side one-1) * Herbie Flowers \u2013 bass (side one-1, side two 1,2) * Terry Cox \u2013 drums (side one-1) * Mick Ronson \u2013 guitars, piano, moog, backing vocals (side one 2\u20136) * Trevor Bolder \u2013 bass (side one 2\u20136) * Mick Woodmansey \u2013 drums (side one 2\u20136) * Tony Newmark \u2013 drums (side two 1) * Aynsley Dunbar \u2013 drums (side two 2) * Carlos Alomar \u2013 guitars (side two 3,4,5) * Earl Slick \u2013 guitars (side two 4,5) * John Lennon \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (side two 4) * Mike Garson \u2013 Piano, keyboards (side one 2\u20136, side two 1\u20134) * Roy Bittan \u2013 piano (side two 5) * Willy Weeks \u2013 bass (side two 9) * Emir Ksasan \u2013 bass (side two 10) * George Murray \u2013 bass (side two 5) * Andy Newmark \u2013 drums (side two 3) * Dennis Davis \u2013 drums (side two 4,5) * David Sanborn \u2013 saxophone (side two 3) * Pablo Rosario \u2013 percussion (side two 3) * Larry Washington \u2013 percussion (side two 3) * Ralph Mcdonald \u2013 percussion (side two 4) * Ava Cherry, Robin Clark, Anthony Hinton, Diane Sumler, Luther Vandross \u2013 backing vocals (side two 3) * Warren Peace \u2013 backing vocals (side two 3,5) * Jean Millington, Jean Fineberg \u2013 backing vocals (side two 4) * Harry Maslin, Editing, Assembling, and Mastering ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1976) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- | |- |UK Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |US Billboard Pop Albums | style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- | |- | |- | |- | |- | |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
