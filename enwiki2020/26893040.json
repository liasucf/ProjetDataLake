    "text": "Ayon () is a rural locality (a selo) in Chaunsky District of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia, situated on the northwestern shores of Ayon Island in the entrance to Chaunskaya Bay. It is the only populated place on the island Population: Municipally, Ayon is subordinated to Chaunsky Municipal District and is incorporated as Ayon Rural Settlement. ==History== ===Pre- history=== Archeological investigations have revealed that the village site has been inhabited from the first millennium AD,Strogoff pp. 110f. with the discovery of tools, arrowheads, antlers and the remains of old Yaranga indicating that the area has been inhabited for centuries by people engaged in reindeer herding. ===Pre-soviet period=== The first mention of Aion was in the writings of Isaya Ignatiev, who landed on the island and traded with the locals living there in 1646 and in 1761 Ayon was visited by the merchant Nikita Shalaurov. There were still indigenous settlers on the island when it was first visited by Ferdinand von Wrangel in 1821,History of Ayon, Kalanina, V. mainly Chukchi engaged in traditional reindeer husbandry. Early Russian visitors to the region including explorer Nikita Shalaurov called the island Zavadey ()Information on Ayon village Official Chaunsky District Website and later: Sabodey () by Wrangel, but the island and the village itself was called Ayon from 1875 when the missionary Argentov overheard local Chukchi referring to the area as such, although other sources suggest the date was 1857. The name was initially translated as Marrow Island, although other sources contend that the name is derived from the Chukchi word meaning \"brain\", as the island's shape is somewhat like a brain. The local expert on Chukotko- Kamchatkan languages, Pyotr Inenlikey considers that the name derives from the Chukchi word Ayo, meaning revive and that the island is thought of as a place of revival by the indigenous inhabitants.V.V. Leontev and K.A. Novikova, \u0422\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e-\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (Toponymic Dictionary of the Northeastern USSR) (1989) Magadan. p.58 The abundant pastures present on the island (since it lies within Chukotka's Taiga zone) add weight to this theory, as well as the fact that although the island is covered in ice and snow during the winter, in the summer, this melts and the island provides a good pasture for reindeer herds as well as being the home to swarms of midges and gadflies. ===Soviet period=== Following the rise of communism in the Soviet Union in the first part of the twentieth century, the teacher Ignat Toroyev (known as \"Red Yaranga\" () came to the island and the native herds were collectivised in 1933 into a group called \"Enmitagino\". Such collectivisation was very successful on the island and in 1950, the collective in Ayon was turned into a formal Kolkhoz that would eventually have around 22,000 reindeer under its control. In addition to reindeer herding, the new collective was also engaged in sea- hunting and the collection of furs. A polar station was established on the site of the village in 1941 and the icebreaker Krasin brought Pyotr Sidersky and a crew of seven people to man the new station. This was the first time that the village site had been inhabited permanently, with indigenous people living there only during the summer when the reindeer were taken to pasture, with the exception of a few individuals who would over-winter in order to hunt. By 1944, the settlement had become increasingly permanent and there were 103 people living in 23 houses. ===Post-Soviet period=== However, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, state support was withdrawn and the herders, who had been used to being supplied with the latest technology by the state now found that not only did they have to fend for themselves with regards to the day to day herding, but that there was no guarantee that they would even receive the money they were owed for the meat they provided to the state. The previous collective farm of Emmitagino was replaced by a municipal agricultural enterprise called \"Chaunskoye\". The result of this is that the herds have shrunk from 22,000 to only around 4,000 which has caused considerable unemployment in the town. This has led to a lot of drinking, which not only has sociological effects, but the litter produced also encourages disease from which the reindeer now suffer, further reducing the size of the herd. ==Demographics== The population according to the 2010 census was 252, of whom 120 were male and 132 female. This represents a slight increase on a January 2009 estimate of 242, though a significant reduction of almost 200 in four years from a 2006 estimate of 440, of which 310 were Chukchi. Although this estimate suggests a significant increase on the 330 people recorded in 2005 in an environmental impact report for the Kupol Gold Project.Bema Gold Corporation, p.87 ==Economy== Reindeer herding is still the dominant economic driver in the village. A new agricultural enterprise has been established since the collapse of the Soviet Union and it still holds the name \"Enmitagino\". The herd is reported as having fallen to 2,700, but is now growing. ===Transport=== Because the settlement is on an island, it is somewhat difficult to reach. There is no road or bridge linking the island with the mainland. A winter road exists when the bay is frozen, but during spring and summer, the only way to the settlement is by helicopter. There is however, a small network of roads within the village including:Ayon - Chaunsky District Pochtovik Mail Delivery Service * \u0423\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0418\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435\u044f (Ulitsa Inenlikeya) * \u0423\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f (Ulitsa Ostrovnaya, lit.
