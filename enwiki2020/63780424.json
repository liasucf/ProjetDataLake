    "text": "Barbara Sloat is an American biologist, Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan. Sloat's research focused on lysosomal enzymes, yeast cellular morphogenesis, and notably, the recruitment and retention of women in science. As part of the latter efforts, she was founding Director of the University of Michigan's Women in Science Program, now known as Women in Science and Engineering. In recognition of her work she received the Sarah Goddard Power Award for \"distinguished service, scholarship, and commitment to the betterment of the status of women\" at the University of Michigan. She has been a licensed Paramedic in the State of Michigan since 1998. ==Selected research== *Adams, A.
