The song was released on 18 May 2015; peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart, making it her eighth top-ten song in the UK. ==Composition== \"Poison\" is an EDM number, and a modern take on a pop power ballad. It has a moderately fast tempo of 124 beats per minute. \"Poison\" contains elements of electronic music, combined with a \"chewy\" pop hook. In an interview for Vice, Ora said that she was baffled by the track being described as EDM-leaning. She felt that it was more passionate and not electronic-sounding at all, and stated \"it's more of a rocky, edgy pop record made by a pop star, which is what I am.\" Aside from the track's crashing production, \"Poison\" is primarily melodic with Ora soliciting a soaring, stripped-down vocal performance which spans from the note of G3 to E5. Set in the key of B-flat major, \"Poison\" follows a basic chord progression of B-B/D-E, and is drum-heavy in its instrumentation throughout. The song opens with a tender piano progression. Sharp percussion and dark string instrumentation begins playing as the chorus builds in intensity. Drums later feature most prominently during the middle eight. Although upbeat, \"Poison\" is emotive in tone. Its lyrical content details pain experienced from a dysfunctional relationship with a backstabbing, toxic love interest. Ora said the track was not about any specific individual, but her \"bad luck\" with love in general and how she envisaged love and a period in her life when it was poisonous. Ora said of the song's meaning: > \"'Poison's about having something to complain about and in my world that > thing I'm complaining about is love and being 24. You forget what real life > is sometimes and it's not about pretending to have an upper hand on someone, > it's about knowing the truth and keeping it moving.\" ==Critical reception== \"Poison\" has received critical acclaim. Jennifer Ruby of the London Evening Standard hailed it as Ora's \"pop comeback\". Writing in the Liverpool Echo, Jade Wright deemed the track \"colossal and extremely addictive\", and said that Ora \"returned in style\". Vibe called it a \"dangerous\" single, commending Ora's \"refreshingly stripped down performance\". Tom Richardson of the Gay Times highlighted its \"fresh mature sound\". The Irish Times named it their track of the week, with Ailbhe Malone writing, \"This falls into one of our favourite musical subgenres \u2013 the emotional banger\". Mark Savage of BBC News deemed it \"a fiery foot-stomper\". Rap-Up noted the song's \"radio-friendly hook\". Anne T Donahue of The Guardian opined, \"Sorrowful enough to soundtrack summer nights in contemplating old flames, but fast enough to fuel nights out dancing in hope of meeting new ones, this jam could be the bridge Ora needs to secure her mainstream spot in America\". Writing in Time, Nolan Feeney said the track was \"synthtastic\" and \"gives the singer reasons to keep trying\", concluding, \"This doesn't feel like the mega- smash single that will completely reverse her luck, but its you-ooo-ooh-ooh hook shows she can be a worthy vessel of solid material\". Conversely, Dana Rose Falcone of Entertainment Weekly said the single \"falls in line\" with Ora's \"poppy hits\", \"I Will Never Let You Down\" and \"How We Do (Party)\" (2012). While Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson of Digital Spy commented that it lacked the \"instant pull\" of \"I Will Never Let You Down\", but had \"solid chart potential nonetheless\". Andrew Hampp of Billboard gave \"Poison\" three out of five stars, and said that it did not \"match the playful aesthetic\" of \"I Will Never Let You Down\", but its \"belted, from-the-gut chorus may prove to be stickier\". Stereogum's Chris DeVille said \"Poison\" was the \"Best Rita Ora song ever\", but \"a second-rate redux\" of Tove Lo's \"Timebomb\" (2015). ==Commercial performance== According to Music Week, \"Poison\" was number one in \"initial sales flashes\" of the UK Singles Chart dated for 9 July 2015, but \"lost its potency as the week progressed\" and was overtaken by Lost Frequencies' \"Are You with Me\" and Tinie Tempah's \"Not Letting Go\". It subsequently debuted at number three with first-week sales of 55,855 units, marking Ora's eighth top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. The song dropped to number seven the following week with sales of 21,530 units. It registered a sales increase in its third week, selling 34,798 units, but fell to number 13 nonetheless. On 27 October 2017, it was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of over 400,000 units. \"Poison\" entered the Irish Singles Chart issued for 2 July 2015 at number 21, and climbed to a peak of number 18 the following week, becoming Ora's sixth top 20 hit in Ireland. In Australia, \"Poison\" debuted at number 74 on the ARIA Singles Chart dated 27 June 2015, and went on to reach a peak of number 30, marking Ora's sixth top 40 hit in the country. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified \"Poison\" gold for selling 35,000 copies. ==Music video== A music video to accompany the release of \"Poison\" was first released on Vevo on 3 June 2015 at a total length of four minutes and fifty-three seconds. An additional video was released for the official remix of the song, featuring Krept and Konan, for Hunger TV. ==Live performances== Ora first performed \"Poison\" as part of her sets for Radio 1's Big Weekend 2015 on 24 May 2015, and the Summertime Ball on 7 June 2015. She then reprised \"Poison\" on The Graham Norton Show which aired on 26 June 2015; wearing a black bra, ripped jeans, and a large, fringed black leather jacket. Idolator's Christina Lee wrote that in a live setting, Ora's \"powerful vocals [in the song] are more pronounced, to where she sounds like she's taking the subject matter to heart\". Writing in the Daily Express, Becca Longmire said Ora \"flashed a lot of flesh\" with her \"revealing\" outfit which she felt \"arguably overshadowed the music\". Ora performed \"Poison\" at G-A-Y on the day of Pride London on 28 June 2015; where she draped herself in a rainbow flag during the rendition as a nod to Pride London. The same day, she performed the Zdot Remix of the song with Krept and Konan as part of her set for the Wireless Festival. Ora further promoted \"Poison\" with a performance on The John Bishop Show which aired on 4 July 2015. ==Track listings== *Digital download #\"Poison\" \u2013 3:22 *Digital download \u2013 Acoustic #\"Poison\" (Acoustic) \u2013 3:40 *Digital download \u2013 The Remixes #\"Poison\" (featuring Krept and Konan) [Zdot Remix] \u2013 3:51 #\"Poison\" (Perplexus Remix) \u2013 4:07 #\"Poison\" (David Zowie Remix) \u2013 5:24 #\"Poison\" (Myles James Vocal Remix) \u2013 6:45 ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Euro Digital Songs (Billboard) | 5 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hong Kong (Metro Radio) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mexico Ingl\u00e9s Airplay (Billboard) | 13 |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- !scope=\"row\"| France |rowspan=\"3\"| 18 May 2015 |rowspan=\"3\"| Digital download |rowspan=\"18\"| | |- !scope=\"row\"| Italy | |- !scope=\"row\"| Spain | |- !scope=\"row\"| Italy | 12 June 2015 | Contemporary hit radio | |- !scope=\"row\"| United States | 16 June 2015 | Digital download | |- !scope=\"row\"| France |rowspan=\"7\"| 28 June 2015 |rowspan=\"4\"| Digital download \u2013 The Remixes | |- !scope=\"row\"| Germany | |- !scope=\"row\"| Italy | |- !scope=\"row\"| Spain | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| United Kingdom |rowspan=\"1\"| Digital download | |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Digital download \u2013 The Remixes | |- !scope=\"row\"| United States | |- !scope=\"row\"| France |rowspan=\"6\"| 30 June 2015 |rowspan=\"6\"| Digital download \u2013 Acoustic | |- !scope=\"row\"| Germany | |- !scope=\"row\"| Italy | |- !scope=\"row\"| Spain | |- !scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom | |- !scope=\"row\"| United States | |} ==See also== *List of UK top 10 singles in 2015 ==References== Category:2015 singles Category:Rita Ora songs Category:2015 songs Category:2010s ballads Category:Roc Nation singles Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Songs written by Kate Nash Category:Songs written by Julia Michaels Category:Songs about betrayal Category:Songs written by Sir Nolan ",
