    "text": "Alloclasite ((Co,Fe)AsS) is a sulfosalt mineral. It is a member of the arsenopyrite group. Alloclasite crystallizes in the monoclinic system and typically forms as columnar to radiating acicular prismatic clusters. It is an opaque steel-gray to silver-white, with a metallic luster and a black streak. It is brittle with perfect cleavage, a Mohs hardness of 5 and a specific gravity of 5.91\u20135.95.http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/alloclasite.pdf Handbook of Mineralogy It was first described in 1866 for an occurrence in Romania.http://www.mindat.org/min-134.html Mindat data Its name is derived from Greek for \"other\" and \"to break,\" in reference to its distinct cleavage which distinguished it from the similar appearing mineral marcasite.http://www.webmineral.com/data/Alloclasite.shtml Webmineral data == References == Category:Cobalt minerals Category:Iron minerals Category:Sulfosalt minerals Category:Monoclinic minerals ",
