Inductees are selected by the eight-member Go Hall of Fame Awards Committee, of which Otake Hideo, the Nihon Ki-in chairman, and Rin Kaiho, the Professional Go Players Association chairman, are both members. According to the Nihon Ki-in, those inducted need not be the most renowned players, since even \"non-professionals who have contributed to the development of Go will also be honoured.\" ==Inductees== Listed in reverse chronological order. ===2019=== *Eio Sakata *Cho Nam-chul ===2018=== *Matsutar\u014d Sh\u014driki ===2017=== *Masaoka Shiki ===2016=== *Kanren () *Inoue Gennan Inseki ===2015=== *Go Seigen ===2014=== *Utaro Hashimoto ===2013=== *Kita Fumiko ===2012=== *Yasui Santetsu *Chen Yi ===2011=== *Iwamoto Kaoru ===2010=== *Kitani Minoru ===2009=== *Segoe Kensaku ===2008=== *Honinbo Shuei *Honinbo Shusai ===2007=== *Honinbo Shuho ===2006=== *Honinbo Shuwa *Baron Okura Kishichiro ===2005=== *Honinbo Jowa ===2004=== *Honinbo Sansa *Honinbo Dosaku *Honinbo Shusaku *Tokugawa Ieyasu ==References== Category:Go (game) Category:History of go Category:Halls of fame in Japan ",
