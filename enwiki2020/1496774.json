He has released four studio albums: Mario (2002), Turning Point (2004), Go (2007), and D.N.A. (2009). At the end of the 2000s decade, Mario was ranked No. 98 by Billboard on their \"Artist of the Decade\" list. His fifth album Dancing Shadows, released in 2018, saw him in a more introspective sound. His 2020 single \"Closer\" was released and has since started the Closer Challenge on the social media platform TikTok. Aside from his career in music, he appeared in several television shows and films such as Step Up (2006), Freedom Writers (2007) and Empire (2018\u20132020). In 2019, Mario starred in the live television production of the musical Rent. ==Early life and education== Mario Dewar Barrett was born on August 27, 1986, to his parents Shawntia Hardaway and Derryl Barrett Sr., a singer in a gospel group called Reformation. Mario's half-brother Derryl \"D.J.\" Barrett Jr., is a professional drummer. He grew up in west Baltimore and other working-class neighborhoods in Baltimore County, Maryland. He lived with his grandmother, who raised him while his single mother struggled with drug addiction. At the age of four, Mario proclaimed that he wanted to become a singer. In support of his dream, his mother bought him a karaoke machine. Mario joined a musical group in Milford Mill Academy with the oldest son of comedian Mo'Nique and best friend Jaye Brebnor and also his younger god sister Chea Tyler. Barrett learned to play the piano and used that skill as the basis for his melodies and songs. He was discovered at age eleven and signed by producer Troy Patterson, after singing \"I'll Make Love to You\" at a Coppin State College talent show. Mario attended Milford Mill Academy up until the tenth grade where he was inspired by his music teacher, during his early teen years, and was offered a record deal at the age of fourteen, signing with Clive Davis' J Records. His musical influences include Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Nat King Cole, Brian McKnight, Boyz II Men, Michael Jackson, Usher, and Joe. His first introduction to the music industry was the Dr. Dolittle 2 movie soundtrack in 2001.

He enlisted a number of well-known producers to help him, such as Scott Storch and Lil' Jon. He released his second album, Turning Point on December 7, 2004.

The single was written by Ne-Yo. Other follow-up singles include \"How Could You\" co-written by J. Valentine, with a cameo appearance in the video by rapper Cassidy; \"Here I Go Again\" (whose video starred model/singer Cassie) and \"Boom\" featuring Juvenile. To date, Turning Point is certified platinum and the lead single double-platinum. In February 2006, Mario filed a lawsuit against his former manager, Troy Patterson, alleging that Patterson had paid him $50,000 for the sale of more than 3 million records, which was later found to be false accusations.
