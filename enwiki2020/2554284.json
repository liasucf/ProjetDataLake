    "text": "Richmond Fontaine was an American four-piece rock and alternative country band, based in Portland, Oregon. They were active between 1994 and 2016 and recorded eleven studio albums, four live albums and two EPs. ==History== Formed in 1994, Richmond Fontaine started touring the Pacific Northwest live circuit to support their first three albums released on Cavity Search Records. Gradually gaining attention in the UK and Europe the band began regularly touring there. Most of the core musicians and producer J. D. Foster have worked together for a decade, and produced several albums. The band is named after an American expat, \"a burned out hippy\", that had helped bassist Dave Harding when his car was stuck in the desert in the Baja California Peninsula. Richmond Fontaine first gained exposure outside the United State through a song that was included on a Vinyl Junkie Records 'Loose' compilation released in the UK. This was followed by the band's self-released fourth album, Winnemucca. The band signed with Decor Records in Europe during 2003 with their next two releases proving pivotal to the band's success. Both were made \"Albums of the Month\" in influential magazine, Uncut, which named both their fifth album Post to Wire (2004) and sixth The Fitzgerald (2005) \"masterpieces\". U.S. critics have been generally complimentary but have also cited the band's musical similarity to Uncle Tupelo. Underpinned by lead singer and songwriter Willy Vlautin's lyrics, Richmond Fontaine songs often evoke imagery of Reno, Nevada, Portland, the Western United States, and Mexico, while telling stories in a style that critics have compared to Raymond Carver.[ allmusic ((( Miles From > Overview )))] The group has cited influences such as Gram Parsons, X, Green on Red and Dave Alvin. Vlautin is also a published writer. His first novel, The Motel Life was published in 2006, followed by Northline in 2008 and Lean on Pete in 2010. Northline included a soundtrack CD by Willy Vlautin and Paul Brainard. The novel was well-reviewed by George Pelecanos. Vlautin has also had stories published in literary journals such as Zembla, Cold Drill, Southeast Review, and Chiron Review. The band's 2007 album, Thirteen Cities, received positive reviews across Europe. On August 17, 2009 the band released their ninth studio album, We Used to Think the Freeway Sounded Like a River. In September 2011, the band released their tenth studio album, The High Country. In March 2016, the band released their final album, You Can't Go Back If There's Nothing To Go Back To. ==Members== *Willy Vlautin: vocals, acoustic and electric guitars *Freddy Trujillo: bass, vocals *Sean Oldham: drums, percussion, vibes, vocals *Dan Eccles: lead guitar *Dave Harding: bass, guitars, vocals *Paul Brainard: pedal steel guitar, piano, Electric Guitar, vibes, acoustic guitar, Trumpet, vocals *Joe Davis: drums *Stuart Gaston: drums *Matt Gilley: drums (one live performance in 1997) ==Selected discography== Studio albums *Safety (1996) *Miles From (1997) *Lost Son (1999) *Winnemucca (2002) *Post to Wire (2003) *The Fitzgerald (2005) *Obliteration by Time (2006) *Thirteen Cities (2007) *We Used to Think the Freeway Sounded Like a River (2009) *The High Country (2011) (UK Albums Chart peak: No. 115) *You Can't Go Back If There's Nothing To Go Back To (2016) (UK Albums Chart peak: No. 65) (UK Country Chart peak: No.1) *Don't Skip Out On Me (2018) - Instrumental soundtrack to the Willy Vlautin book of the same name.
