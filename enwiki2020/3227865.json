    "text": "Jo King is a cricket scorer who often works for British broadcasting services. In the past she has scored for Channel 4, who held the television rights for the England cricket team's home tests from 1999 to 2005. She has also scored England's winter Test tours, either for the commercial talkSPORT radio or the BBCs Test Match Special radio programme. Jo began with TMS in Pakistan in 1987 - the infamous tour in which the England captain Mike Gatting had an on-field row with the umpire Shakoor Rana which brought the Test to a halt - but the highlight of her career so far was as the Channel 4 scorer when England regained the Ashes in 2005. ==References== Category:Cricket scorers Category:Living people Category:English cricket commentators Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
