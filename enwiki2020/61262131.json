    "text": "The southernmost persistent glacial masses in Europe are mainly small glaciers, glacierets, and perennial firn fields and patches, located in the highest mountains of the three big southern European peninsulas - the Balkan, the Apennine, and the Iberian, the southernmost ranges of the Alps and the glaciers on the european northwestern slopes of the Greater Caucasus mountains in Russia. There are summer lasting snow patches in Sierra Nevada (Corral de la Veleta glacier at 37\u00b003\u203224\u2033 disappeared completely for a first time in 1913), in Mount Olympus (40\u00b005\u203208\u2033) (Kazania cirque), in Mount Korab (41\u00b047\u203228\u2033), in Rila Mountain (the cirque of the Seven Rila Lakes, Musala and Malyovitsa (42\u00b010\u203225\u2033) ridges), in Picos de Europa (43\u00b011\u203251\u2033) in the Cantabrian Mountains, in Mount Magli\u0107 (43\u00b016\u203252\u2033) and others. However, none of them have both persistency and indications of dynamic motion. In southern direction, some 4000 km away, are the glaciers in Africa in Rwenzori Mountains (00\u00b023\u203209\u2033N), Mount Kenya (00\u00b009\u203203\u2033S) and Mount Kilimanjaro (03\u00b004\u203233\u2033S).
