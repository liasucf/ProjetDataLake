Recent Activities The CRARR, represented by Civil Rights Advocate Elena Toews, is currently assisting two groups of black residents of Southwest Montreal who have filed claims with the Quebec Human Rights Commission. The individuals, Samantha Hyman-Roberts and Gallo Cham, have claimed that they were both racially profiled and abused by transit authorities after failing to show proof that they had purchased transit tickets. Both Hyman-Roberts and Cham are asking for $50,000 and $30,000, respectively. The complaints are currently in the process of being filed on behalf of the individuals by the CRARR.Irwin Block, \"Black Montreal Residents claim racial profiling on transit,\" Montreal Gazette. 21 Feb 2010 https://montrealgazette.com/life/Black+Montreal+residents+claim+racial+profiling+transit/2594810/story.html iii. Past Successes The CRARR has been granted intervener status in two discrimination cases reviewed by the Supreme Court of Canada. One was Lavoie v. Canada (2002) which discussed giving preference to citizens over non-citizens for government jobs. As intervener, the CRARR argued that the practice was discriminatory and \"the preference operated in a particularly invidious way with respect to women.\" The CRARR argued that many women keep foreign citizenship out of practical considerations, such as maintain the ability to return to their former country to take care of elderly parents.Daphne Gilbert. \"Time to Regroup: Rethinking Section 15 of the Charter.\" McGill Law Journal. 2003, 48:639. 25 Feb 2010. The reality that citizens receive preference over non-citizens is contrary to the federal action plan, Embracing Change, that was created in 2000 to increase the representation of visible minorities in the federal public service which can often include non-citizens.United Nations 2 In addition, the organization has also achieved the following: -intervened in a number of cases before the Canadian and Quebec Human Rights Commissions and helped victims of racism receive over $400,000 in damages through various court cases -won a case before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal against a man in British Columbia who was affiliated with a neo-Nazi website -aided a number of individuals in filing complaints against discriminatory and unethical police and transit authority behavior.CRARR. \"Services for Victims of Discrimination.\" Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/15 ==Current Organizational Features== i.
