It was subordinated to the direct command of the Yugoslav Air Force. By 1948 this regiment was renamed like all other units of the Yugoslav Army, becoming the 103rd Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment.Dimitrijevi\u0107, Bojan. Jugoslovensko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo 1942-1992. Beograd, 2006, p. 357. ===103rd Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment=== The 103rd Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment was based at Mostar airfield until 1949, when it was re-located to Pan\u010devo airport. In 1952 it moved briefly to Batajnica Air Base, and it subsequently returned to Pan\u010devo where it remained until 1960 when it moved to Tuzla. It was equipped with British-made fighters and trainers, domestic Aero 2 trainers and Soviet Yak-9P fighters until 1951 when they were replaced with British-made Mosquito Mk 38 night fighters. By 1952 the regiment was subordinated to the 44th Aviation Division. In 1953 it was attached to the 7th Air Corps. The Mosquitos were replaced by US-made RT-33A reconnaissance jets by 1956. By 1961 the \"Drvar\" system was being used to identify squadrons, the two units of the 103rd Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment became the 350th and the 351st Reconnaissance Aviation Squadrons. It was disbanded in 1966 due to an order of February 17 of the same year. Its 351st Reconnaissance Aviation Squadron was also disbanded, while the 350th Reconnaissance Aviation Squadron was attached to the 98th Aviation Brigade.
