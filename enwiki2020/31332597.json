    "text": "The Thorvaldsen Medal (Danish: Thorvaldsens Medalje, Thorvaldsen Medaillen) is awarded annually with few exceptions to a varying number of recipients by the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and is its highest distinction within the visual arts. It is named after the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. The medal was founded in 1837 as the Exhibition Medal and awarded for talented works in the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in the Charlottenborg Palace. In 1866, it was renamed the Thorvaldsen Exhibition Medal (), and from 1923 it has been known under its current name. ==Medal design== The medal is executed in silver and designed by the sculptor (1806\u201345) in connection with Thorvaldsen's homecoming from Rome in 1838. ==Recipients== ===Exhibition Medal recipients=== {| align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Year !Laureate !class=\"unsortable\" colspan=2|Winning work !class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s) |- | 1839 | Martinus R\u00f8rbye | 130px | A Turkish notary drawing up a marriage contract in front of the Kili\u00e7 Ali Pasha Mosque, Tophane, Constantinople | |- | 1841 | Wilhelm Marstrand | 130px | Scene of the October celebrations in Rome (Scene af oktoberfesten i Rom) | |- | 1842 | Bertel Thorvaldsen | | Honorary medal | |- | 1843 | Johan Vilhelm Gertner | | Stiftsprovst Trydes Portr\u00e6t | Source |- | rowspan=2|1845 | rowspan=2| P.
