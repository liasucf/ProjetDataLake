Although the distribution of B. porphyrostachys is widespread; from Southern Nigeria (in Okuma, Sapoba and Usonigbe Forest Reserves, and in Calabar) to Cameroon (specifically on Mount Cameroon) and Congo-Brazzaville; it is found only sporadically, as either an epiphyte, or a lithophyte (on lava rock). It has not been observed as the latter recently (1995 survey). == Sources == == External links == *Five photos of B. porphyrostachys porphyrostachys Category:Near threatened plants Category:Plants described in 1951 Category:Orchids of Cameroon Category:Orchids of Nigeria Category:Flora of the Republic of the Congo Category:Epiphytic orchids Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
