    "text": "Paul Anthony Edward Everingham (born 4 February 1943) was the head of government of the Northern Territory of Australia from 1977 to 1984, serving as the second and last Majority Leader (1977\u20131978) and the first Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 1978 to 1984. He was a member of the Country Liberal Party, representing the northern Darwin seat of Jingili in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1974 to 1984. He briefly served as Deputy Majority Leader (the equivalent of a deputy premier in the states) under Goff Letts from 1974 to 1975. He remained on the backbench for the remainder of the First Assembly. Just months after being re-elected to the legislature, he was named leader of the CLP and Majority Leader after Letts was unexpectedly defeated in his own electorate despite the CLP comfortably winning another term in government. He thus oversaw the transition to self- government, which occurred in 1978. At that time, he became Chief Minister with greatly expanded powers. As the second and longest-serving head of government in the Territory, he led the CLP to comprehensive election victories in 1980 and 1983. During his tenure, the Northern Territory was essentially a one-party state; he never faced more than seven opposition MLAs. In mid-1984, Everingham resigned as CLP leader and from the Legislative Assembly to seek election to the Australian House of Representatives as the member for the Division of Northern Territory. He was initially heavily favoured against Labor incumbent John Reeves. However, Reeves significantly closed the gap during the campaign. On election day, the race was very close, but Everingham's first-count lead proved too much for Reeves to overcome. He was elected on the fourth count, winning by 1,800 votes. Everingham set a precedent during his single term in Canberra when he chose to sit with the Liberals. Federal CLP parliamentarians had long been expected to sit with the Nationals, since the CLP has full voting rights with the Nationals and observer status with the Liberals. Since Everingham's tenure, however, subsequent CLP members of the House of Representatives have sat with the Liberals, but CLP Senators have continued to sit with the Nationals in the Senate. After his time in the House of Representatives, Everingham had a stint as President of the Queensland Liberal Party. ==References== ==External links== *Biography for EVERINGHAM, the Hon.
