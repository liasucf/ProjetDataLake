In this part of his professional career he was to occupy important positions in Paris and Dakar. Thus he became chief of the Information Department of SORAFOM (the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Radiodiffusion de la France d\u2019Outre-Mer) in Paris, and director of Radiodiffusion du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (SORAFOM and the government of Senegal) as well as director of the Information Department of Radio de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Mali.

For several years he also served as secretary for cultural affairs (secr\u00e9taire culturel) of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Africaine de Culture (SAC).
