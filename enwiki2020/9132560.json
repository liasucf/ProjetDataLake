    "text": "Metelimumab (CAT-192) is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes TGF beta 1 which had been chosen for further development for the treatment of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma. It was dropped from further development in favour of fresolimumab, which is currently being developed by Genzyme. == History == Metelimumab was isolated by Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) using its phage display technology. In 2000, CAT signed a collaborative deal with Genzyme to further develop TGF beta antibodies. In 2004, CAT and Genzyme revealed that Phase I/II trials of metelimumab for scleroderma showed this antibody to be safe and well tolerated across all dose levels, although no conclusions regarding efficacy of the compound could be made. Initial trials targeted the skin condition scleroderma but, after some unsuccessful clinical trial results, the product was dropped in favour of fresolimumab, which is currently being developed by Genzyme. == References == Category:Monoclonal antibodies ",
