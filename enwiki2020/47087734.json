The Chief Registrar serves as the head of administration and accountant to the judiciary. ===History of the judiciary=== The Lagos State Judiciary was the first judiciary to be established in Nigeria, then known as the Colony Province Judiciary. The Magistrate Court was established first. The establishment of the Magistrate Court gave birth to the High Court, the then Lagos State Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court of Nigeria was founded, the Lagos Supreme Court metamorphosed into the High Court of the Federal Territory Lagos with the concurrent appointment of John Taylor as Chief Judge. On May 27, 1967, the same year Lagos State was formed, the High Court and the Magistrate Court of the Federal Territory were merged to form the Lagos State Judiciary under the leadership of John Taylor, the pioneer Chief Judge of Lagos State. Taylor's tenure elapsed on November 7, 1973. He was succeeded by Justice Joseph Adefarasin, appointed on November 1, 1974. He served in that capacity for 9 years until April 24, 1985, when his tenure ended.
