The name shows that it was either founded under the patronage of some Roman emperor, or a new Roman name was given to an old place. Ptolemy places this town in a district named Bryelice. The town also bore the name Augustopolis, and possibly Thebae. Its site is located near G\u00fcbe in Asiatic Turkey. In 431 Tarianus, Bishop of Augusta represented the town at the Council of Ephesus.John Fulton, Index Canonum: The Greek Text, an English Translation, and a Complete Digest of the Entire Code of Canon Law of the Undivided Primitive Church (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 16 Sep 2014 page 151.Charles Joseph Hefele, A History of the Councils of the Church: from the Original Documents, to the close of the Second Council of Nicaea A.D. 787 (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 1 Feb 2007) page 58. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Cilicia Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:Populated places of the Byzantine Empire Category:History of Adana Province ",
