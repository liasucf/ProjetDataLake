Rihanna explained the reasoning behind \"We Ride\" being chosen as the third single from the album in an interview with Corey Moss of MTV. The singer stated that instead of asking her record label and management which song should be released after \"Unfaithful\", Rihanna looked on iTunes to see which was her most downloaded song after the album's lead single \"SOS\" and \"Unfaithful\" and stated that \"We Ride\" was the third most popular, saying \"Out of all my songs available for sale on iTunes, [We Ride was] the third most downloaded, behind 'SOS' and 'Unfaithful,' ... It's having good feedback, so I'm gonna give fans what they want.\" \"We Ride\" was released as the third single from the album to US mainstream and rhythmic radio stations on August 21, 2006, and was released in certain European territories as a CD single throughout October and November 2006.

In an interview with Corey Moss of MTV, Rihanna explained the concept behind the inspiration for the video, saying, \"We just wanted to reconnect with my peers, let them know I'm still a teen, I still have friends \u2013 but to make something provocative. The '[SOS]' and 'Unfaithful' [concepts] were so out there, so we pulled it back a little bit. I'm chilling with my girls some.\" The singer continued to talk about the choreographic content, saying, \"I'm dancing [in the video], like technical dance, which was a challenge ... It usually takes years to learn, but we got it done in a few days. And it was beautifully shot.\" The video was released to download via iTunes on September 18, 2006, in Ireland and September 20, 2006 in the United States. ===Synopsis=== In the video, Rihanna incorporates professionally choreographed dance routines in front of a white backdrop. The video begins with Rihanna walking towards a white Jeep Wrangler, but stops due to her mobile phone ringing. As Rihanna answers, she converses with a male friend, presumably her boyfriend. As she tells him that she needs to do some things before meeting with him, Rihanna hangs up and the screen cuts to a black screen. As a visual of Rihanna driving along a bridge in the Florida Keys, the song begins to play. During the first verse, different scenes are intercut of Rihanna, including a close-up shot of the singer driving behind the wheel is shown, walking along the beach and dancing in a black dress against a white backdrop, as she sings about how her boyfriend has been seeing another girl without Rihanna knowing. For the first chorus, in addition to the other three scenes, one shot is shown of Rihanna dancing with a man in a nightclub. During the second verse, Rihanna is shown lying down on the beach and playing in the water, as well as dancing with a male dancer against a white backdrop, this time wearing a lace dress. For the second chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in restaurant and walk down the street. During the bridge, as Rihanna sings about the difficulties of getting over a failed relationship, scenes of Rihanna partying and talking to her ex-boyfriend on her phone are depicted, which results in her agreeing to meet him as she sings \"Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it/I won't forget how you do it, my sweet baby/This is where the game ends now/But somehow wanna believe you and me/We can figure it out\", as she decides that their relationship is worth salvaging. During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut. The video ends with a close-up shot of Rihanna against a white backdrop; when the song's audio finishes, the singer turns her head to the side and looks into the distance, as the camera pans away. ==Track listings== *;CD single #\"We Ride\" \u2014 3:58 #\"Unfaithful\" (Nu Soul Remix) \u2014 6:55 *;CD maxi single #\"We Ride\" (Radio Edit) \u2014 3:58 #\"We Ride\" (Stargate Remix) \u2014 4:01 #\"We Ride\" (Lenny B Club Mix) \u2014 8:26 #\"We Ride\" (Video) *;Digital download #\"We Ride\" (No Hi Hat) \u2014 3:56 #\"Unfaithful\" (Nu Soul Remix) \u2014 6:55 *;Digital EP #\"We Ride\" (Radio Edit) \u2014 3:56 #\"We Ride\" (Stargate Remix) \u2014 3:57 #\"We Ride\" (Lenny B Club Mix) \u2014 8:23 ==Credits and personnel== ;Recording *Recorded at Battery Studios, New York City, New York; The Loft Recording Studios, Bronxville, New York; Blue Wave Studio, Saint Philip, Barbados; and Hinge Studios, Chicago, Illinois. ;Personnel *Songwriting \u2013 Makeba Riddick, Mikkel Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen *Production \u2013 Stargate *Vocal engineering and recording \u2013 Mikkel Eriksen, Al Hemberger, James Auwarter *Mixing \u2013 Phil Tan *Vocal production \u2013 Evan Rogers, Carl Sturken *Instruments \u2013 Mikkel Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen *Lead and background vocals \u2013 Rihanna Credits adapted from the liner notes of A Girl Like Me, Def Jam Recordings, SRP Records. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2006\u201307) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |24 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) |40 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia) |26 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) |4 |- !scope=\"row\"|France (SNEP) |24 |- !scope=\"row\"|Germany (Media Control Charts) |45 |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\"|Italy (FIMI) |16 |- !scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100) |60 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (RIANZ) |7 |- !scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|22 |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\"|Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) |42 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |17 |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\"|US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles (Billboard) |7 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Dance Club Songs (Billboard) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard) |34 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Rhythmic (Billboard)https://www.billboard.com/charts/rhythmic-40/2006-11-11 |27 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2007) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|US Dance Club Songs (Billboard) |17 |} ==Certifications== ==See also== * List of number-one dance singles of 2007 (U.S.) ==Radio adds and release history== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| United States | rowspan=\"2\"| August 21, 2006 | Contemporary hit radio | rowspan=\"2\"| Def Jam Recordings |- | Rhythmic contemporary |- !scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom | October 26, 2006 | CD | Mercury |- !scope=\"row\"| Australia | October 30, 2006 | Digital EP | Universal Music |- !scope=\"row\"| Germany | November 11, 2006 | CD | Def Jam Recordings |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2006 songs Category:2006 singles Category:2000s ballads Category:Billboard Dance Club Songs number-one singles Category:Rihanna songs Category:Music videos directed by Anthony Mandler Category:Soul ballads Category:Songs written by Tor Erik Hermansen Category:Songs written by Mikkel Storleer Eriksen Category:Songs written by Makeba Riddick Category:Def Jam Recordings singles ",
