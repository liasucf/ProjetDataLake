    "text": "Birth Control is a German rock band known for their progressive hard rock sound and provocative album covers (such as that of Two Eggs \u2013 Two Concerts which depicts a hen cooking eggs). ==History== Birth Control formed in 1966 in Berlin from two other bands, the Earls and the Gents. The band was founded with a lineup consisting of Bernd Koschmidder (bass), Reinhold Sobotta (organ), Rolf Gurra (saxophone, vocals), Fritz Gr\u00f6ger (vocals), Reiner Borchert (guitar), Hugo Egon Balder (drums), and Klaus Orso (guitar). Within five years of the band's formation all seven of the original members had departed, but the band continued under the leadership of long-standing members drummer (and later lead vocalist) Bernd Noske (who replaced Balder in late 1968) and guitarist Bruno Frenzel (who replaced Borchert in 1969). Following the death of Frenzel in 1983, the group disbanded, but reunited in 1993 with only Noske remaining from the previous lineup. Other members of the reformed band included returning bassist/vocalist Horst Stachelhaus, as well as guitarist Rocco Zodiak and keyboardist Xaver Fischer. Despite the death of mainstay Stachelhaus in 1999, the band continued under Noske's guidance, touring Germany and release new albums periodically following the turn of the century. In later years, former members Peter F\u00f6ller (bass, vocals) and Zeus B. Held (keyboards) both returned to the fold as guest musicians at occasional concerts. The band came to an end on February 18, 2014 with the death of Noske. The final lineup of the band consisted of Noske, bassist Hannes Vesper, keyboardist Sascha Kuhn, and guitarist Martin Ettrich. From 2016 on the band continued performing. The new lineup is: Peter F\u00f6ller(vocals), Martin Ettrich (guitar, talkbox), Sascha K\u00fchn (keyboards), Hannes Vesper (bass) and Manni von Bohr (drums). In the same year th new album \"Here and now\" has been released, with Bernd Noske on vocals and drums. Since 2018 it is also available as double vinyl. ==Members== *Bernd Koschmidder \u2013 bass, vocals (1968\u20131973) *Reinhold Sobotta \u2013 organ (1968\u20131972) *Rolf Gurra \u2013 saxophone, vocals (1968\u20131969) *Fritz Gr\u00f6ger \u2013 vocals (1968\u20131969) *Reiner Borchert \u2013 guitar (1968\u20131969) *Hugo Egon Balder \u2013 drums (1968) *Klaus Orso \u2013 guitar (1968) *Gerd Alsheimer \u2013 guitar (1968) *Bernd Noske \u2013 drums, percussion, vocals (1968\u20131983, 1993\u20132014; died 2014) *Bruno Frenzel \u2013 guitar (1969\u20131983; died 1983) *Wolfgang Neuser \u2013 organ (1972\u20131973; died 2018) *Peter F\u00f6ller \u2013 bass, vocals (1973\u20131977, 2016-present) *Zeus B.
