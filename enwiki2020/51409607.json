    "text": "One Day at a Time is an American sitcom based on Norman Lear's 1975\u20131984 sitcom of the same title. Lear's company, Act III Productions, approached Sony with the idea of reimagining the original series with a Hispanic family. It was developed by Gloria Calder\u00f3n Kellett and Mike Royce, with Lear and his producing partner Brent Miller as executive producers. The series features an ensemble cast starring Justina Machado, Todd Grinnell, Isabella Gomez, Marcel Ruiz, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Rita Moreno. The show revolves around a Cuban- American family living in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Echo Park, focusing on a single mother who is an Army veteran dealing with PTSD, her kids and her Cuban mother. The re-imagination of the original CBS sitcom tackles issues like mental illness, immigration, sexism, homophobia, gender identity, and racism that Latinx people living in the United States face. The series premiered on Netflix on January 6, 2017; with subsequent seasons premiering on January 26, 2018 and February 8, 2019. Netflix canceled the series on March 14, 2019, but on June 27, 2019, Pop announced that it would revive the series in 2020, making One Day at a Time the first original program canceled by Netflix to be revived on a traditional linear network. The fourth season premiered on March 24, 2020, on Pop, with a simulcast on TV Land and Logo TV; the simulcast with TV Land was made permanent shortly thereafter as TV Land's ratings for the premiere were nearly five times that of the episode's premiere on Pop. In March 2020, production on season 4 came to an end due to the COVID-19 pandemic. First-run episodes continued to broadcast through April 28, 2020, with further production and/or broadcast not expected to resume until 2021.https://twitter.com/OneDayAtATime/status/1255316684862341123 Plans were announced the next day to make an animated special, further reported in May 2020 as \"The Politics Episode\". The episode, co-produced with the Canadian animator Smiley Guy Studios, premiered on June 16, 2020. CBS began airing the season four episodes on October 12, 2020.https://deadline.com/2020/10/one-day- at-a-time-cbs-premiere-pushed-week-postponed-new-england-patriots-kansas-city- chiefs-nfl-game-1234591160/ Upon its release, the show received critical acclaim, with critics and journalists praising the writing and the performances of Machado and Moreno. One Day at a Time was listed as one of the best television shows of 2017, with numerous critics ranking it as one of the top ten shows of the year. The series received multiple awards and nominations, including four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series and won two in 2019 and 2020. At the 2017 Imagen Foundation Awards the series won Best Primetime Television Program \u2013 Comedy, Best Actress \u2013 Television (Machado), Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Television (Gomez) and Best Young Actor \u2013 Television (Ruiz). Moreno was nominated for a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. The series was also nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. ==Premise== The series depicts the everyday life of a Cuban-American family with each character finding their own journey. Following the story of Penelope Alvarez, a United States Army Nurse Corps veteran, facing her return to civilian life with a lot of unresolved issues from her time in the Army. She works as a nurse in the office of Dr. Leslie Berkowitz. After her husband's alcoholism due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from his time in the Army made it, in Penelope's words, 'unsafe to be in the house', she separates from Victor, taking the children with her. With the help of her Cuban mother, Lydia Riera, she raises two children: Elena and Alex. Apart from planning her daughter's quincea\u00f1era, Penelope starts dating and finds a love interest. Elena, resistant to have a quinces, starts dating a teenager from her class, to later realize that she is a lesbian. After struggling in ways to tell her family about her sexuality she finally comes out. In the second season, Penelope continues to deal with her PTSD, while getting back into the dating scene. Elena finds a love interest in Syd, who is non-binary. Lydia and Schneider both reveal they are not legal U.S. citizens, and therefore both take their citizenship tests. Towards the end of the season, Lydia suffers a stroke and begins to hover between life and death, though she ultimately survives. In the third season, Penelope, Elena, Alex, and Schneider all find themselves more as the season goes on. Schneider's father comes to visit the building and almost causes the Alvarezes to lose their home. Schneider revolts and goes against his father saving the building from turning into a condo, but by doing this, he relapses. Alex is grounded for most of the season for going to Bud-E Fest but gets un-grounded when Penelope finds out how he handled Schneider's relapse. Elena loses her virginity to Syd, and Penelope finishes her nursing degree. ==Episodes== ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== Justina Machado plays Penelope Alvarez.

(voice only) ==Production== ===Development=== In January 2016, it was announced that Netflix was giving the remake of One Day at a Time a 13-episode straight-to-series order. It was released on January 6, 2017. The series was renewed for a second season in March 2017; it premiered on January 26, 2018. It was announced in December 2018 that the third season of One Day at a Time was set to premiere on February 8, 2019. ===Cancelation and revival=== On March 14, 2019, Netflix announced that the series had been canceled after three seasons. After the cancellation announcement, executive producers Gloria Calderon Kellett and Mike Royce began the search to the find the series a potential new home on another streaming service or network, while fans of the series began a campaign using the hashtag #SaveODAAT in hopes of getting the series revived. After the announcement, it was reported that the show's producing studio Sony Pictures Television entered in talks with CBS to air the series to air on the network's streaming service, CBS All Access. A clause in Netflix's contract with SPT, however, prevents another streaming provider from carrying new episodes of the series for a period of two to three years, effectively limiting the series' distribution options to traditional broadcast and cable networks. On June 27, 2019, it was announced that Sony Pictures Television and CBS Corporation came to terms to continue the series for a fourth season of 13 episodes, which would air on CBS's Pop network in 2020. Pop has also acquired linear rights to the show's first three seasons. The fourth season premiered on March 24, 2020, with episodes airing weekly. The premiere episode was simulcast on the ViacomCBS cable networks Pop, TV Land, and Logo (CBS and Viacom had merged in the interim in early December 2019).https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/pop-tv-will-simulcast-one-day-at-a-time- premiere-on-tv-land-and-logo/ CBS is also set to air an encore run the fourth season following its completion on Pop. The simulcast with TV Land was made permanent after the fourth season premiere, as it attracted almost five times more viewers on TV Land than on Pop. During the show's fourth season, six new episodes aired in 2020.https://www.thecinemaholic.com/one-day-at-a-time- season-4-episode-7-mid-season-finale/ However, the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the show from airing more new fourth season episodes until at least sometime in 2021. On April 28, 2020, it was revealed that there were plans to film an animated special. The same day, the show aired its last episode for the year 2020 and the show's Twitter account thanked fans with the message: \"This isn't goodbye, it's see you later. \ud83d\udc9a We'll be back soon, familia! Thank you for watching with us. \ud83e\udd17\" The animated special, \"The Politics Episode\", premiered on June 16, 2020. ===Casting=== Rita Moreno was the first actor announced to star in the series as a Cuban-American grandmother. She later revealed that she accepted the offer to portray the role on the condition that her character be \"sexual.\" In February 2016, it was reported that Justina Machado had been cast as Penelope, Moreno's character's daughter. The castings of Stephen Tobolowsky as Dr. Berkowitz, Penelope's boss, and Todd Grinnell as Schneider, a superintendent, were subsequently announced. ===Filming=== The program is filmed in Culver City, California at Sony Pictures Studios's Stage 25. Like most Norman Lear sitcoms, it is recorded with a multiple-camera setup in front of a live studio audience. Filming of the second season began in May 2017 and ended in September 2017. Filming for the fourth season of the show started in January 2020 and was intended to finish in May 2020. However, filming was halted in March 2020 due to the coronavirus. ===Music=== The theme song for the original One Day at a Time series, \u201cThis Is It\", which was composed by husband-and-wife songwriters Jeff Barry and Nancy Barry, was re-recorded for the new series, with a new arrangement by Emilio Estefan featuring Cuban instrumentation and lead vocals by Gloria Estefan. When the series' fourth season premieres on Pop, the theme song was excised due to time constraints. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px;\" |- ! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season ! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Critical response |- ! style=\"padding:0 8px;\"| Rotten Tomatoes ! style=\"padding:0 8px;\"| Metacritic |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#A4928D;\"| | 1 | 97% (34 reviews) | 79 (23 reviews) |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#FBE45A;\"| | 2 | 100% (29 reviews) | 88 (6 reviews) |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#1B181E;\"| | 3 | 100% (29 reviews) | 82 (9 reviews) |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#799F77;\"| | 4 | 100% (20 reviews) | 84 (13 reviews) |- ! !
