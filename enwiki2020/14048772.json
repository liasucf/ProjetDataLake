Since 2006, the bar is located in the Ortigas Center on the premises of a rock bar called Kalye, which was active in the 1990s.Mallabo, D: \"What can be found in...\", page 48, Burn Magazine, December 2006Seen, P: \"No longer seen in the dark\", page 12, Pulp Magazine, March 2009 ==Cultural significance== 6UG allows for appearance of mostly unknown bands. 6UG was where Rivermaya made their live television special, \"Live @ 6Underground\", aired over Studio 23; one of the uncommon times that the old quartet with Rico Blanco performed their set in a relatively small venue. It was also one of the few bars where Bamboo (band), a rival of Rivermaya, performed. When foreign acts such as Love Me Butch and Interlace came to Manila, their very first stops were also at 6underground. Conclusively, the film of The Dawn (band), \"Tulad Ng Dati\" as well as their video \"Ang Iyong Paalam\", were shot at the bar.
