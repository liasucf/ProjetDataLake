Her mother died young, but her father, Zuo Yong, became an imperial official in charge of the imperial archives. She got a good literary educationChang, Saussy and Kwong, p. 30. and often played word games with her brother, Zuo Si, who would become a famous writer as well. In 272 she went to the palace and became a concubine of Emperor Wu of Jin. There she wrote the Rhapsody of Thoughts on Separation, in which she expressed frustration at being separated from her family and the rest of the world. Her expression of dissatisfaction with life at the palace, which was rare, did not make her lose favour and she was raised to the highest rank of noble concubine.Wu, p. 54. The emperor regularly commanded writings from her, but she was often ill and did not play a political role at court.Chang, Saussy and Kwong, p. 31. When Empress Yang Yan died, she wrote a song of mourning in her honour. Zuo Fen died in 300. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * Category:Jin dynasty (265\u2013420) poets Category:Jin dynasty (265\u2013420) imperial consorts Category:Chinese women poets Category:3rd-century women writers Category:3rd-century writers Category:Writers from Zibo Category:Poets from Shandong Category:3rd-century Chinese poets Category:255 births Category:300 deaths ",
