    "text": "The Pittsburgh Filipinos were a minor league baseball club based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The team began play in 1912 in the United States Baseball League. The team played all of its home games at Exposition Park, located on Pittsburgh's Northside. The Filipinos were named in honor of their manager, Deacon Phillippe, a former pitcher with the Pittsburgh Pirates and a member of their 1901, 1902, 1903 and 1909 National League pennant winning teams as well as their 1909 World Series championship team. The Filipinos finished in first place during the league's inaugural season, which lasted only one month, with a 19-7 record. In 1913, the team became a charter member of the Federal League, which was still a minor league at the time. The club was renamed that season as the Pittsburgh Stogies after an earlier Pittsburgh team that played in the Union Association in 1884. The following season, the Federal League declared itself major league. Therefore the Pittsburgh club then became a direct predecessor to what would become the Pittsburgh Rebels. ==References== Category:Baseball teams established in 1912 Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1913 Filipinos Category:Professional baseball teams in Pennsylvania Filipinos Category:Federal League teams Category:United States Baseball League teams Category:Defunct baseball teams in Pennsylvania ",
