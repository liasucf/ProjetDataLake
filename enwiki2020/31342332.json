    "text": "Sir Francis Henry Lee, 4th Baronet (17 January 1639 \u2013 4 December 1667) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1667. Lee was the son of Sir Francis Henry Lee, 2nd Baronet, of Quarrendon, Buckinghamshire, and his wife Hon. Anne St. John, daughter of Sir John St John, 1st Baronet of Lydiard Tregoze, later Countess of Rochester. In 1659 he succeeded his brother Henry in the baronetcy.John Burke, John Bernard Burke A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies In 1660, Lee was elected Member of Parliament for Malmesbury in the Convention Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Malmesbury in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death in 1667Lee, Sir Henry Francis, 4th Bt. Lee lived at Ditchley, Oxfordshire, and died at the age of 28. Lee married Lady Elizabeth Pope, daughter of Thomas Pope, 2nd Earl of Downe (later third wife of Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey).According to James William Johnson, titles and benefits traditionally held by the Lees were given to Lord Rochester after Frank's death. This action set up considerable legal wrangling, especially after the Dowager Countess of Rochester's death, when his son was granted possession of what had once been Wilmot possessions.\"My dearest sonne\": Letters from the Countess of Rochester to the Earl of Lichfield University of Rochester Library Bulletin Volume XXVIII \u00b7 Number 1 \u00b7 Summer 1974. The identity of Frank's wife is not clear, because the Countess of Lindsey at this time was Lady Elizabeth Pope, daughter of Thomas Pope, 2nd Earl of Downe. Johnson refers to her mistakenly as Eleanor Bertie, Countess of Lindsey. He possibly confuses Elizabeth Pope with her husband's niece Eleanora or Ellen, Countess of Abingdon, married to another Bertie. His son Edward succeeded to the baronetcy and was later ennobled as Earl of Lichfield. ==References== Category:1639 births Category:1667 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of England for Malmesbury Category:English MPs 1660 Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Category:English MPs 1661\u20131679 ",
