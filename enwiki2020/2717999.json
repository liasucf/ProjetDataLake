It has about 1,500 inhabitants. ==History== The Slavic people settled the town area c. 5th-6th century CE. http://www.mestomseno.cz/index.php?cmd=page&id;=268 Evidence suggests that in early times the place may have been called \"Black Village\" due to the many fires that raged there.http://www.hrad-bezdez.cz/mseno.php Whatever the case, the first recorded mention of M\u0161eno was in 1306, in a document signed by Wenceslaus III awarding the then-village to aristocrat Hynek Berka z Dub\u00e9; he, and his son after him, ensured the growing prosperity of the area. In 1367, Charles IV raised M\u0161eno to the rank of \"town\". ==References== ==External links== *Official website (cz, en, de) Category:Cities and towns in the Czech Republic ",
