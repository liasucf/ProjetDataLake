    "text": "Claws was a 1977 U.S. horror-thriller film. Released soon after the highly successful Jaws, Claws attempted to translate the man-meets-deadly-animal theme to Alaska. ==Plot summary== A mature male grizzly bear, enjoying the tactical advantage of being at home in the Alaskan mountains, is stalked and wounded \u2014 but not killed \u2014 by illegal poachers. The bear, now in possession of a revenge motive, goes to war against human beings. The death/wounding toll includes a logger, campers, hikers, hunters, a juvenile Boy Scout, and the local sheriff. With the backing of Alaska Forest Commissioner Ben Jones (played by Leon Ames), master hunter Jason Monroe, played by Jason Evers, must find and kill the deadly animal. In so doing he is aided by sidekick Native Alaskan 'Henry,' played by Anthony Caruso, and is challenged by love rival 'Howard,' played by character actor Glenn Sipes. ==Production== Claws was shot on location in and around Juneau by Alaska Pictures, an independent production company. ==Critical response== Critic Jon Abrams labels Claws \u201ca mishmash of most of the popular genre tropes at the time\u201d of release, but praises the independent film for its \u201cimpressive array of stock footage.\u201d ==References== ==External links== * Category:1977 films Category:Films set in Alaska Category:Films shot in Alaska ",
