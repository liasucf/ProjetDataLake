    "text": "Samuel ben Jacob ibn Jam or Samuel ben Jacob Jam'a (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d1\u05df \u05d2'\u05d0\u05de\u05e2) was rabbi of the North-African community of \u05e7\u05d0\u05d1\u05e1 (Gab\u00e8s?) who flourished in the 12th century. He was on intimate terms with Abraham ibn Ezra, who dedicated to him his \u1e24ai ben Me\u1e33i\u1e93 and mentioned eulogiously three of his sons \u2014 Judah, Moses, and Jacob. == Works == Under the title Elef ha- Magen, or, perhaps, Agur (the Hebrew equivalent of his Arabic name, \"Jam'\"), Samuel wrote a supplement to the Aruk, of Nathan ben Jehiel. Excerpts from this supplement, which is still extant in manuscript,Parma MSS. Nos. 140, 180 were published by Solomon Buber in Gr\u00e4tz Jubelschrift. Samuel is believed to be identical with the author of the same name whose novell\u00e6 on Sanhedrin are mentioned by Isaac ben Abba Mari of Marseilles in his Sefer ha-'Ittur. Two Arabic works, Risalat al-Burhan fi Tadhkiyat al-\u1e24aiwan, containing the laws concerning the slaughtering of animals,A. Neubauer, Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS. No. 793 and Kitab al-Zahdah lil-Muta'ammilin fi Ya\u1e33a\u1e93at al-Mutaghaffilin, on ethics, are also credited to him. According to L. Dukes and other scholars, Samuel was the author also of the grammatical work Reshit ha-Le\u1e33a\u1e25, which is found in manuscript in the Vatican and Paris libraries, and which bears the name of Samuel ben Jacob. This, however, is denied by Steinschneider, who believes this grammar to have been written by another Samuel ben Jacob, of a later day. ==References== Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography: J.L.
