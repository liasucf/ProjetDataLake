    "text": "Duchess of Cornwall is a courtesy title held by the wife of the duke of Cornwall. The Dukedom of Cornwall is a non-hereditary peerage title held by the British monarch's eldest son and heir. The current duchess is Camilla, wife of Charles, Prince of Wales. ==History== Duchess of Cornwall was one of the titles of Diana, Princess of Wales. The only women who have been known as duchesses of Cornwall are Princess Mary of Teck, who used the title from January to November 1901, and Camilla Parker Bowles, who assumed title upon her marriage to Prince Charles in 2005. The latter does not use the title of Princess of Wales because it is still popularly associated with her husband's first wife, Diana, who died in 1997. ==Literary references== *Shakespeare's King Lear includes the character \"Regan, Duchess of Cornwall\", Lear's second daughter. *Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon included the fictional character Morgaine as the Duchess of Cornwall through inheritance. *Igraine, mother of King Arthur, was Duchess of Cornwall when she caught the eye of King Uther Pendragon in many retellings of Arthurian legend. ==See also== *Duke of Cornwall *Duchy of Cornwall ==References== ==External links== *Official website *BBC News report Category:British monarchy Category:Duchy of Cornwall ",
