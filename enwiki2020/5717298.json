    "text": "Venanzio Ortis (born 29 January 1955) is an Italian retired long-distance runner who won two medals at the 1978 European Championships. ==Biography== Ortis was born in Paluzza, province of Udine. He started racing in 1969 (for a period he also practiced cross-country skiing), and later won the Italian junior titles in the 1000 and 3000 m races. On 16 August 1978, aged 23, he set a new Italian record in the 5000 m at the Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich, obtaining a third place behind Henry Rono and Markus Ryffel. In the fast 10,000-metre race of the 1978 European Athletics Championships, held in Prague two weeks later, he broke 28 minutes for the first time while finishing second in 27 minutes 31.48 seconds, just four one-hundredths of a second ahead of Aleksandr Antipov of the Soviet Union, and half a second behind Finland's Martti Vainio (see, for example, Tapio Pekola et al., eds., EM-Praha 1978 (European Championships in Prague 1978), Kaarina, Finland: Juoksija-lehti (Runner Magazine), 1978). In the slow and tactical 5,000-metre final, he managed to squeeze through the narrow space between Ryffel and the Soviet Union's Aleksandr Fedotkin to sprint to the lead and win by 0.1 seconds. He missed the 1980 Moscow Olympics due to injury. His last major international track race was the 1981 IAAF World Cup event in Rome, where he placed fourth in 10,000. Plagued by physical problems, Ortis retired in 1983. He is the cousin of the Italian cross-country skier Manuela Di Centa. ==Achievements== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=65% style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\" !Year !!Competition !!Venue !!Position !!Event!!Time!!Notes |- |1974 |align=left|World Junior Cross Country Championships |align=left| Monza |bgcolor=silver| 2nd |Junior race | | |- |rowspan=3|1976 |align=left rowspan=2|World Cross Country Championships |align=left rowspan=2| Chepstow |14th |Individual race |35:36 | |- |5th |Long course team |224 pts | |- |align=left|Olympic Games |align=left| Montreal | |5000 m |13:52.40 | |- |rowspan=2|1978 |rowspan=2 align=left|European Championships |rowspan=2 align=left| Prague |bgcolor=\"gold\" align=\"center\" | 1st |5000 m |13:28.52 | |- |bgcolor=\"silver\" align=\"center\" | 2nd |10,000 m |27:31.48 | |- |1983 |align=left|World Cross Country Championships |align=left| Gateshead |align=\"center\" | 7th |Long course team | | |} ==National titles== He won five times the national championships at senior level. *Italian Athletics Championships **5000 metres: 1977 **10,000 metres: 1976, 1978 **Cross country (12 km): 1980 *Italian Athletics Indoor Championships **3000 metres: 1978 ==See also== * FIDAL Hall of Fame ==References== ==External links== * Venanzio Ortis at FIDAL * * * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Udine Category:Italian male cross country runners Category:Italian male long-distance runners Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Italy Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:Athletics competitors of Fiamme Oro Category:Mediterranean Games silver medalists for Italy Category:Competitors at the 1987 Mediterranean Games Category:Mediterranean Games medalists in athletics ",
