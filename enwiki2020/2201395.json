    "text": "Steven Norman Howey (born 26 October 1971) is an English former footballer who played as a centre back for the England national team. At club level, he made more than 300 appearances in the Football League and the Premier League, playing for Newcastle United, Manchester City, Leicester City, Bolton Wanderers and Hartlepool United. He also played briefly for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. ==Club career== === Newcastle United === Howey started his career with Newcastle United signing a professional contract on 11 December 1989. At first he was playing in the striker position for the youth and reserve teams until Ossie Ardiles conceived the idea of moving him from the attack back into the defence. Howey was an important part of Kevin Keegan's First Division championship winning side in 1992/93, winning promotion to the Premier League. Once promoted, Howey continued to be a first- choice centre back but was often missing through injury. During Howey's time at Newcastle they were Premier League runner-up twice in 1995/96 and 1996/97 in addition to FA Cup runner-up in 1997/98 and 1998/99. Howey is still a very popular figure in Newcastle as part of a successful influx from Newcastle's youth academy which also included Steve Watson, Robbie Elliott and Lee Clark. === Man City === In August 2000 newly promoted Man City paid Newcastle \u00a32,000,000 for him. His debut came in a 4\u20130 defeat to Charlton setting the tone for a disappointing season which saw Man City relegated. Howey remained at Man City the following season as part of the team which secured an immediate return to the Premier League as First Division champions. One last season at Man City saw Howey contribute to a top half finish and comfortable survival. In his three seasons with Man City Howey scored 11 goals. A highlight of his time at Manchester City was scoring a late equaliser against rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford, in a game more remembered for the clash between Roy Keane and Alf-Inge H\u00e5land. === Later career === A \u00a3200,000 move to Leicester City followed however after six months Howey moved on to Bolton. Less than five months and only three appearances later Howey was released. A short spell with New England Revolution in Major League Soccer followed before a final professional appearance with Hartlepool United brought down the curtain on his sixteen-year professional career. == International career == Howey earned four caps for England, starting all four matches. He made his debut in the 1\u20130 win against Nigeria at Wembley Stadium in November 1994. He won caps in the draws with Colombia and Portugal in 1995 before making his final appearance in the 1\u20130 victory over Bulgaria in March 1996. Howey was called up to the England squad for Euro 96, and was an unused substitute in the first match against Switzerland, but was not fit enough to be on the team sheet for the remaining four matches. He was never called up to the full squad again. == Managerial career == Howey had a short, unsuccessful spell as Manager of Crook Town, taking the helm in September 2006 and resigning just two months later after a poor run of results. He followed this with a spell as a Youth Team Coach at Middlesbrough before making a playing return with National League side Bishop Auckland who he also served in a coaching capacity. Steve Howey become a coach at East Durham College Football Development Centre in 2007 and become Head Coach in 2010. == Personal life == Howey co-presented Total Sport on BBC Newcastle with Marco Gabbiadini and Simon Pryde. His brother Lee was also a footballer, principally with Newcastle's rivals Sunderland. ==Honours== Newcastle United *Football League First Division: 1992\u201393 *FA Cup runner-up: 1997\u201398 Manchester City *Football League First Division: 2001\u201302 ==References== ==External links== * *Steve Howey at RevolutionSoccer.net Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:New England Revolution players Category:Hartlepool United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:UEFA Euro 1996 players Category:Footballers from Tyne and Wear Category:English football managers Category:Crook Town A.F.C. managers Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:English expatriate footballers ",
