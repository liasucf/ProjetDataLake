He is said to be the ancestor of the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and Connachta dynasties through his grandson Conn of the Hundred Battles. The name may also have originally referred to an eponymous deity,Anne Ross Pagan Celtic Britain, Academy Chicago Publishers (1996), p. 225. Ross indicates the name may be derived from Teuto- valos meaning 'Ruler of the People' possibly even a local version of the Gaulish Toutatis.Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia. \"Teutates.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Accessed April 13, 2019. https://www.britannica.com/topic/Teutates. ==Legend== T\u00faathal was the son of a former High King deposed by an uprising of \"subject peoples\" who returned at the head of an army to reclaim his father's throne. The oldest source for T\u00faathal's story, a 9th-century poem by Mael Mura of Othain, says that his father, F\u00edacha Finnolach, was overthrown by the four provincial kings, Elim mac Conrach of Ulster, Sanb (son of Cet mac M\u00e1gach) of Connacht, Foirbre of Munster and Eochaid Ainchenn of Leinster, and that it was Elim who took the High Kingship. During his rule Ireland suffered famine as God punished this rejection of legitimate kingship. T\u00faathal, aided by the brothers Fiacha Cass\u00e1n and Findmall and their 600 men, marched on Tara and defeated Elim in battle at the hill of Achall. He then won battles against the Ligmuini, the Gaili\u00f3in, the Fir Bolg, the Fir Domnann, the Ulaid, the Muma, the Fir \u00d3l n\u00c9cmacht and the \u00c9rainn, and assembled the Irish nobility at Tara to make them swear allegiance to him and his descendants.T. F. O'Rahilly, Early Irish History and Mythology, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1946, pp. 154\u2013161R. B. Warner, \"Tuathal Techtmar: A Myth or Ancient Literary Evidence for a Roman Invasion?\", Emania 13, 1995, pp. 23\u201332 Later versions of the story suppress the involvement of the provincial nobility in the revolt, making the \"subject peoples\" the peasants of Ireland. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9rennR. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, pp. 307\u2013321 adds the detail of T\u00faathal's exile. His mother, Eithne Imgel, daughter of the king of Alba (originally meaning Britain, later Scotland), was pregnant when F\u00edachu was overthrown, and fled to her homeland where she gave birth to T\u00faathal. Twenty years later T\u00faathal and his mother returned to Ireland, joined up with Fiacha Cass\u00e1n and Findmall, and marched on Tara to take the kingship. The Annals of the Four MastersAnnals of the Four Masters M9-106 features a similar revolt a few generations earlier, led by Cairbre Cinnchait, against the High King Crimthann Nia N\u00e1ir. On this occasion Crimthann's son Feradach Finnfechtnach is the future king who escaped in his mother's womb, although the Annals claim he returned to reclaim his throne only five years later. The story repeats itself a few generations later with Elim's revolt against F\u00edachu, and the exile and return of T\u00faathal. Geoffrey KeatingGeoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.38, 39, 40 harmonises the two revolts into one. He has Crimthann hand the throne directly to his son, Feradach, and makes Cairbre Cinnchait, whose ancestry he traces to the Fir Bolg, the leader of the revolt that overthrew F\u00edachu, killing him at a feast. The pregnant Eithne flees as in the other sources. Cairbre rules for five years, dies of plague and is succeeded by Elim. After Elim had ruled for twenty years, the 20- or 25-year-old T\u00faathal was prevailed upon to return. He landed with his forces at Inber Domnainn (Malahide Bay). Joining up with Fiacha Cass\u00e1n and Findmall and their marauders, he marched on Tara where he was declared king. Elim gave battle at the hill of Achall near Tara, but was defeated and killed. T\u00faathal fought 25 battles against Ulster, 25 against Leinster, 25 against Connacht and 35 against Munster. The whole country subdued, he convened a conference at Tara, where he established laws and annexed territory from each of the four provinces to create the central province of M\u00edde (Meath) around Tara as the High King's territory. He built four fortresses in Meath: Tlachtga, where the druids sacrificed on the eve of Samhain, on land taken from Munster; Uisneach, where the festival of Beltaine was celebrated, on land from Connacht; Tailtiu, where Lughnasadh was celebrated, on land from Ulster; and Tara, on land from Leinster. He went on to make war on Leinster, burning the stronghold of Aillen (D\u00fan Ailinne) and imposing the b\u00f3rama, a heavy tribute of cattle, on the province. One story says this was because the king of Leinster, Eochaid Ainchenn, had married T\u00faathal's daughter Dairine, but told T\u00faathal she had died and so was given his other daughter, Fithir. When Fithir discovered Dairine was still alive she died of shame, and when Dairine saw Fithir dead she died of grief. T\u00faathal, or his wife Baine, is reputed to have built R\u00e1th M\u00f3r, an Iron Age hillfort in the earthwork complex at Clogher, County Tyrone. He died in battle against Mal mac Rochride, king of Ulster, at Mag Line (Moylinny near Larne, County Antrim). His son, Fedlimid Rechtmar, later avenged him. ==Historical context== ===Dates=== The Annals of the Four Masters gives the date of T\u00faathal's exile as AD 56, his return as 76 and his death as 106. Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9rinn broadly agrees, dating his exile to 55, his return to 80 and his death to 100. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn places him a little later, synchronising his exile with the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian (81\u201396), his return early in the reign of Hadrian (122\u2013138) and his death in the reign of Antoninus Pius (138\u2013161). ===The first of the Goidels?=== The scholar T. F. O'Rahilly suggested that, as in many such \"returned exile\" stories, T\u00faathal represented an entirely foreign invasion which established a dynasty in Ireland, whose dynastic propagandists fabricated an Irish origin for him to give him some spurious legitimacy. In fact, he proposed that T\u00faathal's story, pushed back to the 1st or 2nd century BC, represented the invasion of the Goidels, who established themselves over the earlier populations and introduced the Q-Celtic language that would become Irish, and that their genealogists incorporated all Irish dynasties, Goidelic or otherwise, and their ancestor deities into a pedigree stretching back over a thousand years to the fictitious M\u00edl Esp\u00e1ine.O'Rahilly 1946, pp. 161\u2013170 ===Romans in Ireland?=== Taking the native dating as broadly accurate, another theory has emerged. The Roman historian Tacitus mentions that Agricola, while governor of Roman Britain (AD 78\u201384), entertained an exiled Irish prince, thinking to use him as a pretext for a possible conquest of Ireland.Tacitus Agricola 24 Neither Agricola nor his successors ever conquered Ireland, but in recent years archaeology has challenged the belief that the Romans never set foot on the island. Roman and Romano-British artefacts have been found primarily in Leinster, notably a fortified site on the promontory of Drumanagh, fifteen miles north of Dublin, and burials on the nearby island of Lambay, both close to where T\u00faathal is supposed to have landed, and other sites associated with T\u00faathal such as Tara and Clogher. However, whether this is evidence of trade, diplomacy or military activity is a matter of controversy. It is possible that the Romans may have given support to T\u00faathal, or someone like him, to regain his throne in the interests of having a friendly neighbour who could restrain Irish raiding.Vittorio di Martino, Roman Ireland, The Collins Press, 2006 The 2nd-century Roman poet Juvenal, who may have served in Britain under Agricola, wrote that \"arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland\",Juvenal, Satires 2.159\u2013160 and the coincidence of dates is striking. ==Family tree== ==See also== *Hibernia *Drumanagh *Hiberno-Roman relations ==References== ==External links== *Hibernia Romana: What did the Romans ever do for us? \u2013 an article about the Drumanagh \"Roman fort\" controversy *Dr Warner reviews his theories on \u2018the Roman invasion of Ireland\u2019 Category:Cycles of the Kings Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland Category:People from County Westmeath ",
