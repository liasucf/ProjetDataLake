    "text": "John Francis William Wybrow (2 April 1928 - 29 July 2019) was a New Zealand politician and diplomat. He was the secretary of the Labour Party and later New Zealand's High Commissioner to Canada. ==Biography== Wybrow was born on 2 April 1928 and was of the Roman Catholic faith. He became an official working for the New Zealand Treasury. Wybrow became private secretary to Labour Party Leader Norman Kirk from 1968 to 1970. He was elected as the general secretary of the Labour Party in 1971, holding the position for fourteen years. Kirk relied on him to 'carry the whole party constitution in his pocket'. The two did not always get along as Kirk did not like Wybrow's tendency to act unilaterally, however he respected him for his energy and organisational ability. They commonly disagreed on the choice of candidates and Kirk blocked Wybrow from attaining the Labour nomination for ahead of the election. Wybrow felt it was not for Kirk to decide these types of issues, to which Kirk retorted \"I've got to lead the bastards you pick.\" When Kirk died in 1974, Wybrow lobbied for the candidacy in the by-election for his seat. However, party president Charles Bennett dissuaded him, saying that Labour couldn't afford to have both a new leader and new secretary start in the same year. The selection committee was split 3 to 3 between Wybrow and Kirk's son John. The nomination ultimately went to Kirk after Labour's vice-president Gerald O'Brien switched his vote. After Bill Rowling was chosen as Kirk's successor as Prime Minister, Wybrow was among those who was unenthusiastic about the idea of holding a snap election under the guise of seeking a personal mandate for Rowling as Premier citing a lack of funding. Wybrow stood unsuccessfully for the Miramar electorate in the election, losing to the incumbent National MP Bill Young by 1,749 votes. In the attempted leadership coup against Rowling in 1980 by his deputy, David Lange, Wybrow was among those (such as Jim Anderton) who sided with Rowling. He retired from the role of party secretary in 1985 when he was appointed High Commissioner to Canada by the Fourth Labour Government. In the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours, Wybrow was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. Wybrow died on 29 July 2019. He was survived by three children. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * Category:1928 births Category:2019 deaths Category:New Zealand Labour Party politicians Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1975 New Zealand general election Category:High Commissioners of New Zealand to Canada ",
