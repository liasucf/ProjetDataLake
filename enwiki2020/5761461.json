    "text": "The School of Social Work is a school at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign which exclusively focuses on social work education. The school was originally a graduate school, but began an undergraduate program in Fall 2010. On July 28, 2017, Steve Anderson was named as the new dean of the school. He succeeded Wynne Korr on September 15. Korr had served since 2002.https://news.illinois.edu/ii/02/0705/swdean.html ==History== > In the late 1930s, the Public Welfare department of the state of Illinois > proposed that the University of Illinois develop a program for training in > social administration, similar to the programs developed at schools such as > the University of Wisconsin, the University of Iowa, and Northwestern > University. But by 1941, a portion of the Illinois program (along with other > schools\u2019 programs) had to be discontinued due to the strain of the war on > the University and its students. The University then hired a consultant from > the American Association of the Schools of Social Work to examine the > possibility of creating a social work school. The Association suggested that > for a school of social work to be successful, a full-time director, trained > in the field of social work, was needed. Marietta Stevenson, with a PhD in > political science and experience working for the American Public Welfare > Association, arrived in 1943 to head the University's new social work > division. Stevenson eventually renamed the program the School of Social > Work, and dedicated herself to building cooperative relationships with > social work agencies in order to provide fieldwork placement for students. > She even held classes at Chicago's Navy Pier so students could work in field > placements in the city\u2019s more urban setting. ==Facilities== The School of Social Work houses one building, located on Nevada Street in Urbana.
