Romberg chaired NCTM's Research Advisory Committee that was responsible for starting the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education and the research pre-sessions at the NCTM's annual meetings. He was a leader in developing the middle grades mathematics curriculum, Mathematics in Context.Mathematics in Context Romberg's research has focused on young children's learning of initial mathematical concepts, methods of evaluating students and programs, and integrating research on teaching, curriculum, and student thinking. For his contributions at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison he was awarded an endowed chair, and received a Faculty Distinguished Achievement Award. For his research he received the Review of Research award, the Interpretive Scholarship, and the Professional Service Awards from the American Educational Research AssociationAmerican Education Research Association; was named a Senior Research Fellowship by the Spencer FoundationSpencer Foundation; and was elected to membership in the National Academy of Education.
