It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. ==History== San Gabriel Mission High School is a Catholic College Preparatory high school, located on the grounds of the historic fourth mission of California, which was founded in 1771 by the Franciscan Padres. The Claretians began administration of the parish in 1908. The idea for the high school began in the mid-1940s and was the \u201cvision of Father J. Nuevo, C.M.F., Mission San Gabriel pastor. With the need for a high school and the support of his parishioners, Father Nuevo had collected a sizable $245,000 toward the realization of the project.\u201d He was transferred in 1948 and his successor, Father Eugene Herran, C.M.F. \u201conly enjoyed a pastorate for a few months, as his success in dealing with the complexities of the new school building project resulted in his election as General Treasurer of the Claretian Fathers.\u201d On January 16, 1949, the groundbreaking ceremonies took place. San Gabriel Mission High School opened in September 1949 as a co- institutional school, under the direction of the Claretian Fathers and Dominican Sisters of Mission San Jose. The freshmen class had 119 girls and boys, temporarily quartered in All Souls Grammar School in nearby Alhambra. In February 1950, the freshmen moved into their new building. The first principals were Father John Schneider, C.M.F. and Sister Mary Redempta Prose, O.P. \u201cThe staff numbered three priests, Fathers Schneider, C.M. F., Leo Mattecheck, C.M.F. and Joseph Anglim, C.F.F. There were three sisters, Sisters Redempta, O.P., Columba Davalos, O.P. and Mary Raymond Carmody, O.P., and two lay teachers \u2013 Mr. John Hanrahan and Mrs. Leo Ryder.\u201d In October of that year, \u201cSister Maureen Murphy O.P. joined the sisters\u2019 community as an additional staff member.\u201d Dedication ceremonies took place on January 14, 1951 with Most Reverend J. Francis McIntyre, Archbishop of Los Angeles, officiating. In 1954, while visiting the high school, he expressed his delight that \u201cwhat a few years ago was a dream is now the flourishing San Gabriel Mission High School.\u201d The new school quickly began to establish its identity by selecting its school colors, selecting green and silver, signifying hope and sterling worth. And, in keeping its connection with Mission's historical tradition, the student body chose \u201cPioneers\u201d as the school name. In addition, many clubs and activities were organized during these first years: Student Council, Sodality, GAA, Glee club, Orchestra and Drama clubs. The school was alive with many sports\u2019 activities. The boys were able to join football, basketball, track, soccer, golf, bowling and tennis teams. The girls participated in volleyball, basketball, and tennis. Intramural sports, Play Day and Field Day became, and still are, annual events. Dances, rallies, drama and musicals rounded out the activity schedule. San Gabriel Mission High School has had an illustrious history. Throughout the years, the many talents of the students were displayed, whether dramatic plays or light-hearted musicals. The choral voices could be heard beginning in 1950, as Mission students entertained audiences with a \u201cTribute to Stephen Foster.\u201d For many years, the Drama Club and Glee Club were privileged to present their operetta at the famous San Gabriel Mission Playhouse. Plays performed in the high school auditorium from Bye Bye Birdie in the 70s to Steel Magnolias in the 80s and most recently In Juliet's Garden, at the Grapevine Arbor. 1963, the Mission Band distinguished itself during the parade competition at the Annual Temple City Camellia Parade. And, in that same year the Boys Pioneer Basketball Team were in CIF for the seventh time and the Mission Soccer Team won League Title. Throughout the years, Mission's athletic abilities have been and continue to include CIF performances as well as Horizon League Championships. In 2007, Mission TV went live on the internet and in 2009, the Cultural Room opened, where language clubs host meetings and share diversities.
