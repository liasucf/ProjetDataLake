    "text": "Room for One More is an American sitcom, principally starring Andrew Duggan and Peggy McCay as the heads of the Rose family which aired on ABC from January 27 until July 28, 1962. Its humor derives from their decision to augment their existing family with two adopted children. Actors playing the children included Tim Rooney, Ahna Capri, Carol Nicholson, and Ronnie Dapo. Jack Albertson played a neighbor, Walter Burton, with Maxine Stuart as his wife, Ruth Burton. Tommy Farrell played the character Fred in five episodes. Thus, Room for One More and its contemporary, My Three Sons, \"were significant departures from the mom-and-pop model of the family\" that typified American television comedy of its era.Haramoto, Darrell Y. Nervous Laughter: Television Situation Comedy and Liberal Democratic Ideology. Praeger/Greenwood. 1989. p.66 As with the similar Brady Bunch that would debut seven years later, the plots on Room for One More tended to feature \"easily solvable situations\". Among the series guest stars were Parley Baer, Bob Hastings, Sandy Kenyon, Sue Ane Langdon, Robert Q. Lewis, Howard McNear, Maudie Prickett, and Gary Vinson. Room for One More aired at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday, having replaced another ABC/WB offering, The Roaring 20s. The series was based on a 1952 movie version starring Cary Grant and Betsy Drake. ==Cast== *Andrew Duggan as George Rose *Peggy McCay as Anne Rose *Tim Rooney as Jeff Rose *Carol Nicholson as Laurie Rose *Jack Albertson as Walter Burton *Maxine Stuart as Ruth Burton *Ronnie Dapo as Flip Rose *Ahna Capri as Mary Rose ==Episodes== * The Anniversary (1/27/1962) * Greeks Bearing Gifts (2/3/1962) * Seated One Day At The Organ (2/10/1962) * Girl From Sweden (2/17/1962) * Angel In The Attic (2/24/1962) * A Trip To The Beach (3/3/1962) * This Gun For Sale (3/10/1962) * Speaker Of The House (3/17/1962) * Strength Through Money (3/24/1962) * I Retake This Woman (3/31/1962) * Love Thy Neighbor (4/7/1962) * The Real George (4/14/1962) * Two Many Parents (4/21/1962) * Our Man In Brazil (4/28/1962) * Flip's Loyalty Test (5/5/1962) * What Is It?
