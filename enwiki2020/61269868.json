He became one of the most famous shipping tycoons of his time with several homes to his name and a fleet of merchant ships which sailed the seven seas. https://www.telegraf.rs/zanimljivosti/zabavnik/2979662-kad-je-trst-bio-nas- evo-koje-srpske-porodice-su-zivele-u-ovom-gradu-i-to-u-najlepsim-vilama- fotohttp://slobodnahercegovina.com/galerija-znamenitih-hercegovaca-jovan- kurtovic-jedan-od-dobrotvora-crkve-svetog-spiridona-u-trstu/ ==Biography== Jovo Kurtovi\u0107 was already a prominent merchant in Trebinje, Hercegovina before he came to settle indefinitely in Trieste in 1737. Shortly after arriving in Trieste, he soon brought three of his brothers over from Hercegovina getting one to set up a branch of the business in western Turkey at Smyrna, the other in Amsterdam and the third one in Vienna, and Prague. They were in a way Jovo's trading ambassadors, through whom, for a short while, they gained a lot of wealth with more of their shops appearing around town and several residential buildings. Giacomo Casanova was commissioned by the Venetian government to investigate and report on Kurtovi\u0107's economic progress in Trieste. To what extent Casanova's report was positive or negative rests on the reputation of its author? In 1782 Kurtovi\u0107 sent a ship from Trieste to Philadelphia, then America's largest port. The Kurtovi\u0107 vessel was one of the first to begin to trade with the new republic which then was only a year old, and the ship was a sensation for Philadelphians who never received a foreign vessel like it before. Jovo Kurtovi\u0107 who lived to the age of 91 and died in Trieste, then part of the Napoleonic empire, in 1809,was kum (godparent) to numerous Serbs of Trieste: Cvetko Jovanovi\u0107, Antonia Kveki\u0107, Josif Mileti\u0107, Jovan Nikoli\u0107, Dimitrije Rajovi\u0107, Stefan Rizni\u0107, Dragutin Teodorovi\u0107, and Petar Teodorovi\u0107. Jovo was the first Serbian president of the Greco-Illyrian (Serbian) Saint Spyridon Church parish, and benefator of the two communitiesand one of the founding fathers of commercial trade in Trieste.Although he was married three times and had many children, none survived him. He bequeathed his wealth to his nephew Maksim Kurtovi\u0107 while he was still alive. ==See also== * Serbs in Italy * Saint Spyridon Church, Trieste *Darinka Kveki\u0107, wife of Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro *Marcello Dudovich, commercial artist *Milan Zlokovi\u0107, architect *Spiridione Gopcevich, shipowner *Ivan Rassimov, actor *Rada Rassimov, actress *Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107, astronomer and historian *Dimitrije Fru\u0161i\u0107, doctor and publisher *Giovanni Raicevich, world-class wrestling champion == References == Category:Serbian merchants Category:1718 births Category:1809 deaths Category:People from Trebinje Category:Serbian expatriates in Italy Category:18th-century merchants ",
