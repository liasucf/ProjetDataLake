Bands and artists from the Hoboken area of New Jersey are eligible for receipt of the awards. ==About== The Hoboken Music Awards were founded in 2009 by Dave Entwistle, a long-time host of the weekly showcase Peoples Open Mic. Modeled after the Asbury Park Music Awards, the Hoboken Music Awards honors regional musicians and promoters, hosts live performances and brings the people of the North Jersey music scene together. Music journalist Stephen Bailey joined as an event organizer in 2010. ===2009 awards=== The first annual Hoboken Awards were held at the now defunct Goldhawk. Prizes included golden microphones and free studio time. Ten awards were presented to bands and musicians. Hundreds of fans and friends filled the back room at Goldhawk. Remarking on the attendance, Entwistle said \"I thought there was going to be more nominees than people actually here to listen to live music, but I was wrong.\" Goldhawk closed in the Fall of 2009. *Best Hard Rock Band \u2013 High Speed Chase ===2010 awards=== The second annual Hoboken Music Awards was held at Northern Soul starting at 7 P.M., on 20 November 2010.
