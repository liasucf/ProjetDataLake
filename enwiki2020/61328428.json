At 20 July 2019, the Fund has a pension fund, plus three superannuation investment options, all fossil-free and ethically driven. The three superannuation investment options are: Balanced Index, Renewables Plus Growth and Balanced Impact.Most assets are held directly rather than via managed fund removing a layer of fees.
