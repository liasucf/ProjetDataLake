    "text": "Fairly Odd Coaster (known formerly as Timberland Twister) is a spinning roller coaster themed to The Fairly OddParents that opened on March 15, 2004 at Nickelodeon Universe in the Mall of America. Individual cars have two rows facing each other and each car spins independently throughout the course of the ride. The ride is geared toward families. ==History== Fairly Odd Coaster opened as \"Timberland Twister\" at Camp Snoopy and is the first spinning roller coaster from Gerstlauer and the first of its kind. A month later, an identical ride opened at Worlds of Fun amusement park in Kansas City, Missouri called Spinning Dragons. A discontinued feature of Fairly Odd Coaster was an on-ride video system that allowed guests to purchase DVDs of their ride on the attraction. The ride was installed by Ride Entertainment Group, who handles all of Gerstlauer's operations in the Western Hemisphere. The Fairly Odd Coaster name was previously shared with rollercoasters at Carowinds in Charlotte, North Carolina and Kings Island near Cincinnati, Ohio before they were both renamed and rethemed as Woodstock Express. ==References== ==External links== * Specifications at ultimaterollercoaster.com * Review at ultimaterollercoaster.com Category:Nickelodeon Universe Category:Roller coasters in Minnesota Category:Roller coasters introduced in 2004 Category:2004 establishments in Minnesota ",
