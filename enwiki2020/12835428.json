    "text": "Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition is a 1964 non-fiction book by British historian Frances A. Yates. The book delves into the history of Hermeticism and its influence upon Renaissance philosophy and Giordano Bruno. With the publication of Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, Yates transformed Renaissance historiography. In it, she revealed the hermeticism with which the Renaissance was imbued, and the revived interest in mysticism, magic and Gnosticism of Late Antiquity that survived the Middle Ages. In the face of longstanding conventional interpretations, Yates suggested that the itinerant Catholic priest Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake in 1600 for espousing the Hermetic tradition rather than his affirmation of heliocentricity. The book is cited by the bestselling British author Philip Pullman, as a central inspiration for his own writing.http://falseeconomy.org.uk/blog/save-oxfordshire-libraries-speech- philip-pullman Pullman's speech on the future of Oxford libraries, January 2011 ==See also== *Renaissance magic *Renaissance humanism ==References== Category:1964 non-fiction books Category:Giordano Bruno Category:Philosophy books Category:Renaissance philosophy Category:Medieval philosophical literature Category:Renaissance humanism Category:Academic studies of ritual and magic ",
