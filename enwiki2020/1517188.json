    "text": "Den\u00edlson de Oliveira (born 24 August 1977), known simply as Den\u00edlson, is a Brazilian football pundit and retired footballer who played as a left winger. In a 16-year professional career he played mainly with S\u00e3o Paulo and Real Betis; who made him the world's most expensive player in 1998. He also appeared for teams in five other countries during his career. Den\u00edlson gained more than 60 caps for Brazil, making his full debut before his 20th birthday and representing the nation in six international tournaments, including two World Cups (winning the 2002 edition). Denilson was known for his dribbling skills. ==Club career== ===S\u00e3o Paulo/Betis=== Born in Diadema, S\u00e3o Paulo, Den\u00edlson made his senior debuts with local S\u00e3o Paulo FC at the age of only 17, appearing with the team in the 1994 Copa CONMEBOL and winning the tournament. In 1998, he broke the world-record transfer fee when Real Betis paid \u00a321.5 million for his services. He made his La Liga debut on 29 August in a 0\u20130 away draw against Deportivo Alav\u00e9s, and finished his first season with 35 games and two goals as his team ranked in 11th position; the Andalusians were relegated to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in 2000. Den\u00edlson spent some months back in his country with Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, on loan, but returned in January 2001 to be a productive attacking unit for Betis as it achieved promotion back (21 games, one goal). He continued to be regularly played in the following top flight campaigns, but more often than not as a substitute. In 2004\u201305 Betis finished in fourth position and qualified to the UEFA Champions League, also adding the season's Copa del Rey, but Den\u00edlson was only a fringe player now, starting in just three games and playing only 290 minutes. ===Bordeaux=== In the 2005 off- season, Den\u00edlson was sold to French club FC Girondins de Bordeaux for an undisclosed amount, four years before his Betis contract was due to expire. In his only season in Ligue 1 he appeared regularly to help to a second-place finish, albeit trailing eventual champions Olympique Lyonnais by 15 points. As the team failed to match Den\u00edlson's wage demands, he left and signed for Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr FC, where he played for a couple of months. ===Dallas=== On 24 August 2007, he joined FC Dallas of Major League Soccer, becoming the team's designated player. he made his league debut on 1 September, entering in the 55th minute against D.C. United, and the following week he made his first start, against Toronto FC at Pizza Hut Park, scoring from the penalty spot in the 36th minute of an eventual 2\u20130 win. After only one goal and no assists, Den\u00edlson was excluded from Dallas' squad for their appearance in the final of the U.S. Open Cup, raising questions of whether he would remain with the club following the season (even though Open Cup regulations allowed no more than five foreign players on the game-day roster). Further fueling speculation, head coach Steve Morrow said the player would need to \"earn a spot in the starting lineup like everybody else\"; goalkeeper Dar\u00edo Sala added the team was having problems adjusting to a change in scheme to accommodate Den\u00edlson. ===Later years=== At the end of the season, FC Dallas decided not to pick up its option on Den\u00edlson, but stated their desire to resign the winger at a lower salary. In February 2008 he signed a one-year performance-based contract with Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, hoping the club structure and experienced coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo would help him recover his best football. He was unable to make the starting squad, spending most of the season as a bench option; nonetheless, he helped O Verd\u00e3o to the S\u00e3o Paulo State Championship and a berth in the Copa Libertadores after the fourth place in the S\u00e9rie A. On 6 January 2009, Den\u00edlson was taken on trial by Premier League side Bolton Wanderers with a chance to sign a contract until the end of the campaign.Bolton move for Denilson; Sky Sports, 6 January 2009 He stated: \"I want to play in Europe, but I am not in a rush. I have received proposals from England, Greece, Turkey and Germany. I am studying them\", further adding: \"I understand that this is the time to return to European football, but if I am not convinced by any offer I hope to continue in Brazil, where there are also clubs interested in me\";Trotters to try out Denilson; Football.co.uk, 7 January 2009 eventually, nothing came of it.Trotters end Denilson interest; Sky Sports, 15 January 2009 After terminating his contract with Palmeiras, 31-year-old Den\u00edlson signed a three-month contract with Itumbiara Esporte Clube.Na estreia de Den\u00edlson, Itumbiara goleia com tr\u00eas gols de T\u00falio Maravilha (In Den\u00edlson's debut, Itumbiara dominates with three goals by T\u00falio Maravilha); Globo Esporte, 4 February 2009 On 2 June 2009 he penned a six- month deal with Vietnamese club H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng F.C. on a pay-as-you-play contract. He made his debut on the 21st against Ho\u00e0ng Anh Gia Lai FC, scoring through a free kick just two minutes into the game, but left after only three weeks with the team with only that single appearance to his credit due to injury. Den\u00edlson was paid $12,000 for the match and a $5,000 bonus for the goal. In January 2010, Den\u00edlson signed a two-year contract with Kavala in Greece. He was released on 16 April, without having played any games.Denilson cut by Kavala ; Greek Soccer, 16 April 2010 ==International career== Den\u00edlson made his debut for Brazil in November 1996 at the age of 19, against Cameroon. He was called for the squad that competed at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, appearing in all the games for the eventual runners-up; the previous year, he was also selected for the 1997 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning both tournaments and totalling ten appearances (two goals). Den\u00edlson was picked by manager Luiz Felipe Scolari for his 2002 World Cup squad in Japan and South Korea. Always as a substitute, he played in five matches as the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o won its fifth World Cup, appearing one minute in the final against Germany. After Carlos Alberto Parreira returned for his third spell as national team boss, Den\u00edlson was not called again. He gained a total of 61 caps. ==Style of play== A creative and technically gifted left-footed player, Denilson was mainly known for his dribbling skills, in particular for his use of several feints to beat opponents such as the step over, which he frequently employed. Despite his talent, he was considered by some to not have fulfilled the potential he showed at the start of his career. ==Media== Den\u00edlson was sponsored by sportswear company Nike, and appeared in commercials for the brand. In a global advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a \"Secret Tournament\" commercial (branded \"Scorpion KO\") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Fabio Cannavaro, Hern\u00e1n Crespo, Edgar Davids, Rio Ferdinand, Lu\u00eds Figo, Paul Scholes, Thierry Henry, Gaizka Mendieta, Hidetoshi Nakata, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Francesco Totti among others, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \"referee\". In March 2017 Denilson signed with 888poker as a brand ambassador. ==Post-retirement== After retiring, Den\u00edlson worked as a sports commentator for Rede Bandeirantes. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;S\u00e3o Paulo *Copa CONMEBOL: 1994 *Campeonato Paulista: 1998 ;Betis *Copa del Rey: 2004\u201305 ;Palmeiras *Campeonato Paulista: 2008 ===International=== ;Brazil *FIFA World Cup: 2002; Runner-up 1998 *Copa Am\u00e9rica: 1997 *FIFA Confederations Cup: 1997 *CONCACAF Gold Cup: Third-place 1998 ===Individual=== *FIFA Confederations Cup: Golden Ball 1997 *South American Team of the Year: 1997 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Naturalised citizens of Spain Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:S\u00e3o Paulo FC players Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo footballers Category:Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras players Category:Itumbiara Esporte Clube players Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Real Betis players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:FC Girondins de Bordeaux players Category:Al-Nassr FC players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:FC Dallas players Category:Designated Players (MLS) Category:V.League 1 players Category:Hai Phong F.C. players Category:Kavala F.C. players Category:Brazil under-20 international footballers Category:Brazil international footballers Category:1997 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:FIFA World Cup-winning players Category:FIFA Confederations Cup-winning players Category:Copa Am\u00e9rica-winning players Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:Expatriate footballers in Saudi Arabia Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Expatriate footballers in Vietnam Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Vietnam Category:Saudi Professional League players Category:1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup players ",
