Unavailability of firefighting equipment and ignorance of fire safety standards have been quoted as the major reasons. Loose wiring and absence of ventilators were further causes for the fire to spread. Instead of fire-proofing material, the walls had gunny bags and the temperature rose to around 120\u00b0C (248\u00b0F) because of huge lights being used for the shooting. All these factors contributed to the massive fire; the final death toll was 62. Sanjay Khan himself suffered major burns and had to spend 13 months in hospital and undergo 72 surgeries. An ex- gratia amount of Rs.5000 was paid to the victims. ==Awards== For his work on this drama, Sanjay Khan received the Gem of India Award. ==See also== *List of Indian TV shows with Muslim characters ==References== == External links == * Category:Indian period television series Category:DD National original programming Category:Indian historical television series Category:1990 Indian television series debuts Category:1991 Indian television series endings Category:Tipu Sultan Category:Television shows set in Karnataka Category:1990s Indian television series Category:Television series set in the 18th century Category:Television shows based on Indian novels ",
