    "text": "Juan Bautista Mart\u00ednez del Mazo (c.1612 \u2013 February 10, 1667) was a Spanish Baroque portrait and landscape painter, the most distinguished of the followers of his father-in-law Vel\u00e1zquez, whose style he imitated more closely than did any other artist.L\u00f3pez Rey, Jos\u00e9: Vel\u00e1zquez, p. 207 A fine painter himself, Mazo was a master of landscape, as proven by his most celebrated work View of Saragossa. ==Life== Little is really known about Mazo\u2019s early life. The date and place of his birth are uncertain. Apparently, he was born in Cuenca, as his parents, Hernando Martinez and Lucia Bueno del Mazo, were from that province. However, some sources consider Madrid as his native city. The date of his birth has been estimated around 1612 since it is known that his mother was born in 1596 and he married in 1633 when he probably was in his early twenties.L\u00f3pez Rey, Jos\u00e9: Vel\u00e1zquez, p. 204 The whereabouts of his training remain a mystery. He must have been in Vel\u00e1zquez's workshop sometimes before his marriage, so it is quite possible that he had been his future father-in-law's apprentice. Mazo married the famous painter\u2019s only surviving daughter, Francisca de Silva Vel\u00e1zquez y Pacheco, on August 21, 1633, at the Church of Santiago in Madrid. Philip IV and the Prime Minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares, served as the couple\u2019s sponsors. The marriage was the event that guaranteed Mazo\u2019s future success at Court. Vel\u00e1zquez immediately arranged a royal appointment and on February 23, 1634, he transferred to Mazo his position of Usher of the King\u2019s Chamber, with the permission of the King. From this it can be assumed that Mazo was then already a disciple of the famous painter, and from that date he was closely associated with his father-in-law with whom he lived and collaborated. Vel\u00e1zquez furthered Mazo's career with a steady hand and secured palace appointments for him and later for Mazo\u2019s children. ==Early career== Stag Hunt at Aranjuez, Museo del Prado, Madrid In 1643, Mazo became Master of Drawing and personal painter of the heir to the Spanish Crown, Baltasar Carlos, Prince of Asturias, who in 1645 became godfather of his fifth child. Prince Baltasar Carlos commissioned him to copy hunt scenes by Paul de Vos, Rubens, Jordaens and other Flemish painters. Mazo accompanied the prince to Arag\u00f3n in 1646. During this trip, he painted the famous View of Saragossa and a last portrait of the young prince who died unexpectedly at the age of sixteen. After the death of the prince, Philip IV decreed that the perquisites that Mazo had been receiving be continued, and kept him employed as a painter. Mazo first expressed his talent copying works of Venetian masters in the royal collections, such as Tintoretto, Titian, and Paul Veronese, a task that he performed with assiduity and success. His colorful work as a copyist opened his way to the secrets of the great masters of his time, especially Rubens and Jordaens. Such copies must have considerably cut down the time available for his original work, as did the production of replicas of Vel\u00e1zquez's royal portraits that he painted; an example would be his portrait of Infanta Margaret Theresa that today is exhibited next to the Vel\u00e1zquez original in a Viennese museum. Nevertheless, Mazo still felt free to follow his own bent for brilliancy of execution and true-to-life naturalism. Mazo rarely signed his works, which furthered the confusion with the work of Vel\u00e1zquez, making it difficult to separate the authorship of their paintings. In fact, there are few extant paintings that scholars agree are his; these include View of Saragossa (1646, Prado); Portrait of Queen Mariana in Mourning Dress (1666, National Gallery, London); and The Family of the Painter (c. 1660\u20131665, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). He has some of his works in the Prado, near those of his mentor. Although Mazo acquired great skills as a portrait painter, some of his most interesting works are hunting pieces and landscapes in which he developed a more personal style with a respect for reality. They are animated with a multitude of figures treated with extreme detail. His landscapes are works of great observation as exemplified by his paintings View of Saragossa and Stag Hunt at Aranjuez \u2013 both were commissioned by Philip IV. He also painted some still lifes. In 1657 Mazo traveled to Italy trying to recover the dowry of his eldest daughter Ines who had become a widow in Naples. During this trip, Mazo painted The Arch of Tito that shows the influence of Roman landscapes. ==Personal style== View of Saragossa, 1647, Museo del Prado, Madrid Mazo\u2019s works owe credit above all to Vel\u00e1zquez, whose style he was long compelled to emulate in Court portraits. However, Mazo shows in his paintings a personality of his own. His portraits exhibit startling naturalism and marvelous execution. Mazo was particularly skillful in painting small figures, a cardinal element in both his hunting scenes and the landscapes he painted as in his most celebrated work View of Saragossa. Mazo\u2019s palette was rather like that of Vel\u00e1zquez, except for a penchant often shown for stressing blue or bluish tints. The departure from his master's style is reflected in his way of shaping people and things by highlights which flash the pictorial image towards the surface of the painting, even from the background. As a counterbalance, an explicit, even emphatic, perspective design marks out the spatial confines of the composition, making it appear squarish. A further departure from Vel\u00e1zquez is his luxurious depiction of detail or incident which he achieved with brilliant, depthless strokes, whether on the figure of a sitter, a curtain on a wall, a floor, the surface of a river, or on plain earthen grounds. These stylistic traits reveal Mazo\u2019s own personality as an artist. For centuries, Mazo\u2019s paintings were attributed to Vel\u00e1zquez, but modern art criticism, techniques, and knowledge have been able to separate their works. Among his pupils was Benito Manuel Ag\u00fcero (1626\u20131672). ==Official Court Painter== Infanta Margarita Teresa of Spain in Mourning Dress, 1666, Prado As long as Vel\u00e1zquez lived, Mazo wrought all of his art in his father-in-law's studio. After Vel\u00e1zquez's death in 1660, Philip IV appointed him as the official Court painter on April 19, 1661, while his son Gaspar took his former position as Usher to the Chamber. At the death of Philip IV in 1665, Mazo kept his position at Court under the regency of Queen Mariana, whose portrait in mourning dress (National Gallery, London, 1666) is one of his few signed works. In this period, he painted a portrait of Infanta Margarita Teresa, also in mourning dress, before she left Spain to marry the Austrian Emperor. Mazo held his position as official Court painter until his death in Madrid on February 9, 1667. ==Descendants== Mazo's first wife, Francisca de Silva Vel\u00e1zquez y Pacheco (1619\u20131658), gave him six children; she died shortly after the last child was born. His second wife, Francisca de La Vega, shown in his painting The Family of the Painter, died in 1665; they had four sons. His third wife was his sister-in-law, Ana de la Vega, who survived him and remarried. Through his daughter Maria Teresa Martinez del Mazo y Vel\u00e1zquez (1648\u20131692), he is an ancestor of the Marquesses of Monteleone, including Enriquetta (Henrietta) Casado de Monteleone (1725\u20131761) who in 1746 married Heinrich VI, Count Reuss zu K\u00f6stritz (1707\u20131783). Through them are descended a number of European royalty, among them Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain,http://europeandynasties.com/relationship_between_queen_sofia_of_spain_and_velazquez.htm Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, King Albert II of Belgium, Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein, and Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== *L\u00f3pez- Rey, Jos\u00e9, Vel\u00e1zquez, Taschen, 1999. . *Mallory, Nina A, El Greco to Murillo: Spanish painting in the Golden Age, 1556\u20131700 ,Icon Editions,1990. . * ==External links== *Juan Bautista Mart\u00ednez del Mazo on Artcyclopedia *Vel\u00e1zquez , an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on del Mazo (see index) Category:1612 births Category:1667 deaths Category:People from the Province of Cuenca Category:17th-century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters Category:Spanish Baroque painters Category:Spanish landscape painters Category:Court painters ",
