The color of the shell goes from brown to whitish. The protoconch is paucispiral with its axis slightly deviated from the main axis. The teleoconch consists of 3 \u00bc rounded whorls, axially crossed by 15 to 20 broad, rounded ribs, less conspicuous at the margin of the oblong aperture (peristome). The outer lip is slightly crenulated and contains six lirae (fine linear elevations of shelly material). The columella is abaxially inclined and shows three folds with the siphonal fold displaying a noticeable tooth. The shell lacks an umbilicus. The periostracum is covered with very short hairs along the spiral lines.Verhecken A. (2007).
