He attended the Society of Arts and Crafts in Detroit and subsequently Yale University where he left prior to finishing the program. His work was included in the 1973 Whitney Biennial. As an art dealer he was the associate director of the Perls Galleries from 1968 until 1975. He later donated his papers from this period to the Archives of American Art of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1971 while associate director of the Perls Galleries, Bradley curated the \"Deluxe Show\" under the auspices of the famed de Menil family in Houston, Texas considered to be one of the first racially integrated art exhibitions in the United States. Bradley is known to have had a direct effect on the \"New New Painters\" movement, a group with a core of nine abstract artists that developed in 1978 coincident with the invention and development of acrylic gel paint by the paint chemist Sam Golden. Bradley's work is held in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art; Metropolitan Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; African American Museum (Lose Angeles); Andr\u00e9 Emmerich Gallery; The Industrial Bank of Japan, Hong Kong; Aldrich Museum; Hayward Museum; University of Sydney; Princeton University; University of California, Berkeley; Dayton Art Institute, Dayton, Ohio; Chairman Bank, Boston, MA; Johannesburg Art Foundation, South Africa; Witherspoon Art Gallery, University of North Carolina; Creative Art Center, West Virginia University; the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, Stamford Connecticut. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Living people Category:1940 births Category:American painters Category:American sculptors Category:College for Creative Studies alumni ",
