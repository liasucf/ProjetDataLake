    "text": "The North Carolina General Assembly election, 2002 was the first General Assembly election conducted using districts drawn following the 2000 Census. These districts differed from past districts in that these were the first drawn so as to have each district elect only one member of the North Carolina General Assembly. Previously, some districts elected 2 or 3 members; the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that this was not allowed under the North Carolina Constitution of 1971. These elections resulted in Democratic control of the North Carolina Senate with a 28-22 majority. The House of Representatives was won by the Republicans by a wafer-thin 61-59 majority. However, Michael P. Decker crossed the floor between the election and the opening of the new session, making it evenly split 60-60. As such, the Democrats and Republicans shared leadership of the body. ==Senate== ==House of Representatives== ==See also== * North Carolina General Assembly, 2003-2004 session.
