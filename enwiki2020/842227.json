    "text": "P\u00e2t\u00e9 ( , , ) is a paste, pie or loaf consisting of a forcemeat that at least contains liver. Common additions include ground meat from pork, poultry, fish or beef, fat, vegetables, herbs, spices and either wine or brandy (often cognac or armagnac). P\u00e2t\u00e9 can be served either hot or cold, but it is considered to develop its best flavors after a few days of chilling. == Variations == In French or Belgian cuisine, p\u00e2t\u00e9 may be baked in a crust as pie or loaf, in which case it is called p\u00e2t\u00e9 en cro\u00fbte, or baked in a terrine (or other mold), in which case it is known as p\u00e2t\u00e9 en terrine. Traditionally, a forcemeat mixture cooked and served in a terrine is also called a terrine. The most famous p\u00e2t\u00e9 is probably p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras, made from the livers of fattened geese. P\u00e2t\u00e9 en cro\u00fbte is baked with the insertion of \"chimneys\" on top: small tubes or funnels that allow steam to escape, thus keeping the pastry crust from turning damp or soggy. Baked p\u00e2t\u00e9 en cro\u00fbte usually develops an air bubble under the crust top as the meat mixture shrinks during baking; this is traditionally dealt with by infusing semi-liquid aspic in the hollow space before chilling. In the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Romania, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark and Austria, some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9s are shaped as a soft, often spreadable sausage, called leverworst (Dutch), pate or leb\u0103r (Romanian), m\u00e1jp\u00e1st\u00e9tom/m\u00e1jkr\u00e9m (Hungarian), or Leberwurst (German). In the United States these are sometimes called \"liverwurst\" (mixing English and German), or braunschweiger. Some liverwursts can be sliced. In the US, sliced liverwurst is used as a sandwich filler. Others are spreadable as are most French or Belgian p\u00e2t\u00e9; these types are more popular in the United Kingdom. In Scandinavia, leverpostej (in the Netherlands: leverpastei) is a popular baked p\u00e2t\u00e9 similar to the French p\u00e2t\u00e9 en terrine, usually made of lard and pork liver. In Poland, pasztet is made from poultry, fish, venison, ham, or pork with eggs, flour, bread crumbs, and a varied range of additions, such as pepper, tomato sauce, mushrooms, spices, vegetables, ginger, nutmeg, cheese, or sugar. In Russia and Ukraine, the dish is mostly prepared with beef, goose or chicken liverenjoyyourcooking.com and thus is commonly known as pechyonochniy pashtet (, \"liver p\u00e2t\u00e9\"), however other meats also can be used. Unlike the Western European method the liver is first cooked (boiled or fried) and mixed with butter or fat and seasoning such as fresh or fried onion, carrots, spices and herbs. It can be further cooked (usually baked), but most often is used without any other preparation. In Russia, the p\u00e2t\u00e9 is served on a plate or in a bowl, and is often molded into the shapes of animals, such as hedgehogs. A similar recipe is known as chopped liver in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, where schmaltz is used instead of butter and hard-boiled eggs are usually added. Another common type of p\u00e2t\u00e9 in Jewish cuisine, also popular in Russia and Ukraine, is vorschmack or gehakte herring (chopped herring).\u0412. \u0412. \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043b\u0435\u0431\u043a\u0438\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u0445\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430, \u0438\u0437\u0434. \u041f\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c-\u0441\u0442\u044c, 1980. \u0415\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0443\u0445\u043d\u044f.
