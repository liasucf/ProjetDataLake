His novels and poetry have, however, received a positive response from the critics. Dr David Dowling, writing in the prestigious Landfall magazine on Johnson's first novel, Lear, comments: \u2018Johnson makes an original contribution to the literature of distaster, and certainly to the nation's literature that still struggles beneath the mantle of social realism; he does it by the sheer intensity of his poetic vision, combined with an adroit metafictional sense ... In this fallen world, does falling matter? Johnson\u2019s novel is an exuberant, artful meditation on this question.\u2019Dowling, David. 'Review of Lear: The Shakespeare company plays Lear at Babylon' Landfall 161. Vol. 41, No. 1, March 1987 Commenting on his 2011 novel, Travesty, Jodie Dalgleish writes, \u2018(Johnson) has achieved a kind of \u2018worldmaking\u2019 [...] that confirms his position as one of New Zealand's most important fiction writers.'Dalgleish, Jodie. 'Half-way House of the Soul' Landfall Review Online. February 1, 2012 Siobhan Harvey, prominent poet and critic, writes about Johnson's last book of poetry, To Beatrice Where We Cross the Line, 'A skilled practitioner at whatever literary craft he turns his hand to\u2026Johnson is a writer at one with the word, its power, its airy finesses and everyday solidities, its resourcefulness, its craft.'Lasavia \u2013 Hold My Teeth Writing in the New Zealand Herald on Johnson's critically well-received English to English translations of the Dang Dynasty poet, Li He (The Vertical Harp \u2013 the selected poems of Li He) writer and critic Iain Sharp wrote: \u2018Mike Johnson is the most underrated of all living New Zealand authors. Sometimes gothic, sometimes lyrical, sometimes both at once, his output over the past three decades has been extraordinary. Yet much of his fiction and most of his poetry has slipped by, barely reviewed...'Westbrook, Harriet. 'Truck: Mike Johnson'.
