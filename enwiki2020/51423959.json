The city itself is barely a full town with only a pizzeria and a florist shop opened. There, she finds herself responsible for a gaggle of children in an impoverished area in a great need of cleaning. Her husband Kent and her new romantic interest Sven head-off for her attention. Sami, Vega, and Omar challenge the construct of a typical home life. Somebody, a 40-year-old alcoholic, runs the hub of the city out of a pizza shop that dabbles in illegal goods. == References == Category:2014 Swedish novels Category:Novels set in Sweden Category:Swedish-language novels Category:Novels by Fredrik Backman ",
