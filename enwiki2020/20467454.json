The park features a large picnic shelter, picnic tables, plenty of hiking trails and a twelve-hole Disc golf course. == History == The park is north of 39th St., E. of Pacific Highway, and the state of Washington's oldest Blue Star Memorial Highway marker and L-shaped area of about 33 \u00bd acres, lying partly within and just north of the city limits, was deeded to the city for park purposes by Mrs. Anna Leverich.Washington - A Guide to the Evergreen State, American Guide Series, c. 1941, p. 287 It was established as a municipal park in 1931 and in the same year an obelisk was erected and a Douglas fir planted by the bicentennial celebration of George Washington\u2019s birth. In accordance with the terms of the deed, the natural environment of the area has been preserved as much as possible. Burnt Bridge Creek, branching out among low hills and small groves of native firs, deciduous trees, and occasional cedars, gives the park a truly sylvan charm. The construction of Interstate 5 through Vancouver split the park separating the Covington House historic cabin and Kiggins Bowl from the rest of the park. == Disc Golf == In 2008 a twelve-hole disc golf course was added to the park. The course was the result of a cooperative effort between Vancouver-Clark Parks and Recreation,http://www.ci.vancouver.wa.us/parks-recreation Vancouver-Clark Parks and Recreation Vancouver-Clark Disc Golf http://www.vcdg.org Vancouver- Clark Disc Golf and Stumptown Disc Golf.http://www.stumptowndg.com Stumptown Disc Golf ==Sources== [1] https://web.archive.org/web/20090228151059/http://www.ci.vancouver.wa.us/parks- recreation/parks_trails/parks/central_vancouver/leverich.htm [2] http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM39AP [3] http://www.vcdg.org/courses/leverich Category:Parks in Washington (state) Category:Disc golf courses in Washington Category:Parks in Clark County, Washington Category:Geography of Vancouver, Washington Category:Tourist attractions in Vancouver, Washington ",
