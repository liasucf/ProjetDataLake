Ryu (born 1975) is a Los Angeles City Councilman for Los Angeles City Council District 4 and the Assistant City Council President Pro Tempore.Daily News: \"David Ryu\u2019s City Council District 4 win a victory for Korean Americans\", 05/20/2015. He is the first Korean-American to hold a council seat in Los Angeles, California, and the first Asian-American to serve on Los Angeles City Council Leadership.Larchmont Buzz: \"Councilmember David Ryu Named Assistant Council President Pro Tempore\", 01/15/2020. ==Early life== Ryu was born Ryu Eun-seok in Seoul, South Korea, in 1975, the oldest of three children.Los Feliz Ledger: \"Council member's father dies of heart attack\", 10/17/2016. His father, Eul Chul Ryu, and mother, Michelle Won Chung Ryu, moved the family to Los Angeles, California in 1980, when Ryu was 5 years old. There, Ryu's father served as editor in chief of the Korean Street Journal newspaper based in Los Angeles, and his mother worked as a nurse. Ryu's parents were married for over 40 years before his father's death in 2016. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from UCLA and a Masters of Public Policy & Administration from Rutgers University. === 2002 arrest === In August 2002, Ryu faced a charge of attempted rape, to which he plead not guilty. The case was dismissed before reaching a preliminary hearing when the district attorney's office said it was unable to proceed within the statutory period. There is no publicly available court file that states the reasons for why the prosecutors felt they could not move forward with the case. == Professional life == After graduating from UCLA, Ryu became a Deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Burke. He later worked as a special investigator for Los Angeles County's Auditor-Controller. Ryu later served as Director of Development and Public Affairs for Kedren Acute Psychiatric Hospital and Community Health Center. ==Political career== Ryu was one of over a dozen candidates to replace Councilmember Tom LaBonge, who was term-limited. Ryu and Carolyn Ramsay, a former aide to LaBonge, advanced past Joan Pelico, Teddy Davis, Step Jones, Rostom \"Ross\" Sarkissian, Mike Schaefer, Wally Knox, Tomas O'Grady, Jay Beeber, Tara Bannister, Sheila Irani, Fred Mariscal, and Steve Veres, in the March 2015 primary. Ryu defeated Ramsay in the general election, on May 19, 2015. He was ceremonially sworn in June 29, 2015, and took office on July 1. Ryu chairs the Health, Education and Neighborhood Councils, Parks, Arts, Entertainment and River Committee, and serves as a member on the Public Safety Committee, the Public Works & Gang Reduction Committee, and Immigrant Affairs, Civil Rights and Equity Committee, as well as Vice Chair of the Arts, Entertainment Parks & River Committee. ===Political positions=== ====Document retention==== Document retention was the first part of Ryu's agenda to be acted upon. One of Ryu's first legislative actions in City Council was introducing a motion to require outgoing City Council members to retain documents when an office transitions. The motion passed in September 2016. Before this motion, there was no rule barring outgoing City Councilmembers from destroying documents before leaving office.Daily News: \"LA City Council tightens record-keeping rules after fallout over destroyed documents\", 09/07/17 ====Campaign finance==== Also soon after entering office, Ryu pushed for a ban on political donations from non-individuals, including corporations, developers, unions, and business groups. No other member of City Council would second the motion, and it did not proceed. In January 2017, Ryu, along with Councilmembers Joe Buscaino and Paul Krekorian, introduced a motion to ban contributions to city elected officials and candidates for city office from developers and their principals with development projects currently or recently before the city, as well as increase matching funds to 6:1 in primary and general elections. In December 2019, the law passed with a unanimous vote from the City Council. The Los Angeles Times reported that the measure bars real estate developers from contributing to the campaign of city officials and council candidates while they have building projects being considered for approval by the city. Critics of the measure argued that the final language contained loopholes, with groups such as the California Clean Money Campaign and California Common Cause arguing that passing it would be \u201cworse than not passing anything at all.\" The law does not prohibit developers from raising money from other donors and directing those funds to politicians, nor does it penalize politicians for knowingly accepting banned donations. The ban also does not apply to subcontractors on a development project. Real estate developer Tom Gilmore was quoted as saying that \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meaningful to block developers from giving $800 checks [to candidates] while still allowing them to raise $20,000.\" Speaking about the measure, Ryu was quoted as saying, \"Do I think this is going to solve all corruption? Of course not. But this is something that has been needed in the city of Los Angeles for decades.\" ====Neighborhood preservation==== Preserving residential neighborhoods was another part of the agenda of Ryu. Out-of-scale homes, also known as \"McMansions,\" were a concern to many residents, particularly in Beverly Grove, Hancock La Brea, and the San Fernando Valley. In December 2016, Councilmember David Ryu introduced a \"Baseline Mansionization Ordinance\" to address this citywide issue\"STATEMENT: Ryu on Ordinances for Baseline Mansionization and Baseline Hillsides,\" 12/09/16. This motion intended to limit the scale of the construction and revise the city's rules which govern the amount of residential floor area that can be developed on a single-family lot through the approval of the Baseline Mansionization Ordinance (BMO) and Baseline Hillside Ordinance (BHO). The ordinances were passed and went into effect in March 2017. Councilmember Ryu expanded the Historic Preservation Overlay Zone to include the Miracle Mile neighborhood on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. This zone preserves the unique and historic character of a neighborhood while still allowing for new housing opportunities.\"Miracle Mile HPOZ Approved by Council Committee, 03/21/17\" ====Spending transparency==== Ryu became the first city councilmember in Los Angeles to appoint a panel of citizens to oversee and advise how he uses his discretionary funds, dubbed \"The Discretionary Funds Task Force\". In Los Angeles, each one of the 15 members of City Council are apportioned \"discretionary funds\" from the city's budget to be used on projects in their district. However, disclosure of how this money is used is not required, and there is little oversight. To address this, Ryu introduced his Discretionary Funds Task Force, which doesn't have the authority to tell the Councilmember how to spend his discretionary funding, but can make recommendations and advise the Councilmember on how to use this funding. Councilmember Ryu also became the first and only councilmember in Los Angeles to make his discretionary spending history publicly available on his website. ===Controversies=== In November 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that despite a campaign pledge not to take money from real estate developers, Ryu's campaign had accepted campaign contributions from multiple developers, including \"from companies linked to Dae Yong Lee, who until recently was seeking to overhaul a Little Tokyo mall; a real estate investment company called First Serrano Apartment LLC; and the head of a Beverly Hills company specializing in commercial property.\" His campaign later said that it would return some of the donations. In August 2020, the Los Feliz Ledger filed an ethics complaint with the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission after Ryu's campaign sent an email to 30,000 voters with a misleading \"From:\" field that implied the email was sent by the Ledger itself. The campaign declined to issue a correction. ==References== ==External links== *Official Councilmember David Ryu\u2014Los Angeles City Council District 4 website *Campaign website Category:Los Angeles City Council members Category:California Democrats Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:American people of Korean descent Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American politicians of Korean descent Category:Rutgers University alumni Category:Rutgers University people Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni ",
