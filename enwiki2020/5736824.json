His current interests are cognitive neuroscience of attention and consciousness with special emphasis on EEG and MEG studies of neuronal synchronization; information transfer between brain regions underlying cognition; psychophysics, biophysics and general theory of stochastic resonance; computational studies of neuronal oscillations and synchronization; neural plasticity; nonlinear dynamical systems theory and its applications in cognitive neuroscience. He co-authored the textbook \"Sensation and Perception\" with Stanley Coren, and James T. Enns, which went into six editions spanning the period 1978 to 2004. ==Selected publications== * Ward, L.M.
