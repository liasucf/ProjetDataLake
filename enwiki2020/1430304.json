    "text": "Bertrandite is a beryllium sorosilicate hydroxide mineral with composition: Be4Si2O7(OH)2. Bertrandite is a colorless to pale yellow orthorhombic mineral with a hardness of 6-7. It is commonly found in beryllium rich pegmatites and is in part an alteration of beryl. Bertrandite often occurs as a pseudomorphic replacement of beryl. Associated minerals include beryl, phenakite, herderite, tourmaline, muscovite, fluorite and quartz. It, with beryl, are ores of beryllium. It was discovered near Nantes, France in 1883 and named after French mineralogist, Emile Bertrand (1844\u20131909). One of the world's largest deposits of bertrandite is Spor Mountain, Thomas Range, Utah which is currently the source of most of the world's beryllium production. ==See also== *List of minerals *List of minerals named after people ==References== Category:Beryllium minerals Category:Sorosilicates Category:Orthorhombic minerals ",
