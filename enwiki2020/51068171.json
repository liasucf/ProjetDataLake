The bronze sculpture was created in 1373 by Hungarian sculptors Martin and George of Kolozsv\u00e1r. It was originally erected in Buda castle and it was brought to Prague later, either during Louis I as a gift to emperor Charles IV, or during Rudolf II to protect it from the Turkish wars. The statue was made with the lost-wax casting method, and was turned into a fountain statue in the 16th century. ==Further reading== * ==References== ==External links== * Category:14th-century establishments in Europe Category:14th-century sculptures Category:Bronze sculptures in the Czech Republic Category:Equestrian statues in the Czech Republic Category:Outdoor sculptures in Prague Category:Prague Castle Category:Saint George (martyr) Category:Sculptures of dragons Category:Sculptures of men in Prague Category:Statues in Prague ",
