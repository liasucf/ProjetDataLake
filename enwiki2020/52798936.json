The match was contested between minor premiers the Melbourne Storm and the eighth-placed North Queensland Cowboys. The Storm won the match 34 \u2013 6 to claim their third premiership title. Melbourne fullback Billy Slater was awarded his second Clive Churchill Medal as the game's official man of the match. Pre-match entertainment was headlined by American rapper Macklemore, who attracted controversy for his scheduled performance of \"Same Love\" during the ongoing nationwide postal survey on same-sex marriage. Fairfax Media described the 2017 NRL Grand final as \"one of the most one-sided grand finals in the NRL era\". https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl- grand-final-2017-north-queensland-cowboys-coach-paul-green-questions-referee- collision-20171001-gys9mc.html http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league- news/nrl-grand-final-2017-north-queensland-cowboys-coach-paul-green-questions- referee-collision-20171001-gys9mc.html ==Background== {| style=\"float:left; font-size:70%; text-align:center; height:30px; padding:10px;\" |- ! ! style=\"border: 2px solid #092340; background: #440085; color: white\"|Storm ! style=\"border: 2px solid lightgrey; background: #0F1E40; color: yellow\"|Cowboys |- | Rd.1 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Bulldogs | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Raiders |- | Rd.2 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Warriors | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Broncos |- | Rd.3 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Broncos | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Sea-Eagles |- | Rd.4 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Tigers | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Titans |- | Rd.5 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Panthers | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Rabbitohs |- | Rd.6 | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Sharks | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Tigers |- | Rd.7 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Sea-Eagles | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Dragons |- | Rd.8 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Warriors | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Knights |- | Rd.9 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Dragons | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Eels |- | Rd.10 | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Titans | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Bulldogs |- | Rd.11 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Rabbitohs | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Sharks |- | Rd.12 | Bye | Bye |- | Rd.13 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Knights | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Titans |- | Rd.14 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Sharks | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Eels |- | Rd.15 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Cowboys | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Storm |- | Rd.16 | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Roosters | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Panthers |- | Rd.17 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Broncos | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Raiders |- | Rd.18 | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Eels | Bye |- | Rd.19 | Bye | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Rabbitohs |- | Rd.20 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Raiders | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Warriors |- | Rd.21 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Sea-Eagles | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Roosters |- | Rd.22 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Cowboys | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Storm |- | Rd.23 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Roosters | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Panthers |- | Rd.24 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Knights | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Sharks |- | Rd.25 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Rabbitohs | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Tigers |- | Rd.26 | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Raiders | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Broncos |- | style=\"background: silver\"| | style=\"background: silver\"| | style=\"background: silver\"| |- | QF | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Eels | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Sharks |- | SF | DNP | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Eels |- | PF | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Broncos | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Roosters |- | GF | style=\"background:#cfc;\"|Cowboys | style=\"background:#fbb;\"|Storm |- ! colspan=\"11\" | Legend: |} This was the third time that a grand final was contested by two non-Sydney/New South Wales based teams, after the 2006 Grand Final (Brisbane defeating Melbourne) and the 2015 Grand Final (North Queensland defeating Brisbane), and the first to feature neither the Brisbane Broncos or a Sydney-based club. The Melbourne Storm qualified for their seventh grand final since 2006, with only coach Craig Bellamy and halfback Cooper Cronk having been involved on each occasion. It was also the first time since 2009 that a side had reached a premiership decider in consecutive seasons, with the Storm having made four straight appearances between 2006-2009. The North Queensland Cowboys made their first grand final appearance since their maiden premiership victory over the Brisbane Broncos in 2015, as well as their third in the club's history. It was the first time since the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in 2014 that a side reached a grand final from outside the top-four, the first time since the Parramatta Eels in 2009 to reach the grand final from as low as 8th position, and the first club to qualify from 8th under the current final eight system that was implemented in 2012. Claiming their third minor premiership, the Melbourne Storm finished the regular season on 44 competition points, six points clear of the second placed Sydney Roosters in losing only 4 games from 24 matches. Their points differential of +297 was their highest amount since 2008. With a two-game home ground advantage, they defeated the fourth-placed Parramatta Eels 18\u201316 to earn a week off and a place in the grand final qualifier, where they would beat the Brisbane Broncos 30\u20130 to reach a consecutive grand final. The Cowboys only made the finals series after the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs defeated the St George Illawarra Dragons in the final round of the regular season. This result denied the Dragons 8th spot and allowed the Cowboys into the finals instead. The Cowboys made a winning run defeating their next three opponents in the finals, all of whom were Sydney- based clubs. They defeated defending premiers, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 15\u201314 in extra time at Allianz Stadium, the Eels 24\u201316 at ANZ Stadium, and the Roosters 29\u201316 at Allianz Stadium, making it the first time they have reached a grand final without losing a finals match. Melbourne and North Queensland have previously played each other in a finals series on three occasions. Their first meeting was in 2005 at, the then named, Aussie Stadium where the Cowboys defeated the Storm 24-16 in the Semi Final. Their second was in 2015, when the Cowboys defeated the Storm 32\u201312 at Melbourne's AAMI Park to qualify for the Grand Final. Their third meeting was in the 2016 Qualifying Final, when the Storm defeated the Cowboys 16-10 at AAMI Park; the Storm would earn a week off and finish runners-up that season. == Teams == {| style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" |- style=\"background:#f03;\" |- style=\"background:#f03;\" ! align=\"centre\" style=\"width:170px; border:3px solid #092340; background:#440085; color: white \"|Melbourne Storm ! style=\"width:120px; text-align:center; background:#eee; color:black;\"|Position ! align=\"centre\" style=\"width:170px; border:3px solid yellow; background:lightgray; color:#0F1E40\"|North Queensland Cowboys |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Billy Slater | style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"| Fullback ||Lachlan Coote |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Suliasi Vunivalu | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Wing ||Kyle Feldt |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Will Chambers | style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"| Centre ||Justin O'Neill |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Curtis Scott | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Centre ||Kane Linnett |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Josh Addo-Carr | style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"| Wing ||Antonio Winterstein |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Cameron Munster | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Five-eighth ||Te Maire Martin |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Cooper Cronk | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Halfback ||Michael Morgan |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Jesse Bromwich | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Prop ||Shaun Fensom |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Cameron Smith (c) | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Hooker ||Jake Granville |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Jordan McLean | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Prop ||Scott Bolton |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Felise Kaufusi | style=\"background:#eee;\"| 2nd Row ||Gavin Cooper (c) |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ||Tohu Harris | style=\"background:#eee;\"| 2nd Row ||Ethan Lowe |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Dale Finucane | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Lock ||Jason Taumalolo |- | | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Kenny Bromwich | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange ||Ben Hampton |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ||Tim Glasby | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange ||Coen Hess |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||Nelson Asofa-Solomona | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange ||Corey Jensen |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ||Slade Griffin | style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange ||John Asiata |- | |- | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | Craig Bellamy | style=\"background:#eee;\"|Coach || Paul Green |} Melbourne Storm halfback Cooper Cronk played in his seventh grand final after having previously featured in every premiership decider his club have reached since 2006. It will also be his last game for the Storm after playing 323 first-grade games for the club. Cronk, Will Chambers, Cameron Smith, Jesse Bromwich, and Billy Slater were the last remaining members of their last premiership winning team in 2012. The North Queensland Cowboys have twelve players from their 2015 Premiership winning side. Co-captains Johnathan Thurston and Matt Scott are the most notable absentees from their last Grand Final appearance after both suffered long-term injuries during the season, although Scott was named as a reserve for the starting line-up. They were replaced by Te Maire Martin and Scott Bolton (who was promoted to the starting line-up after coming off the bench in 2015) respectively, with Martin being transferred mid-season from the Penrith Panthers to cover the injured representative halfback. Cowboys utility Ben Hampton made a consecutive Grand Final appearance after playing for the Storm in their loss to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks the preceding year's premiership decider. === Officials === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" !Position ! ! ! rowspan=\"4\" | !Stand-By |- | class=\"table-rh\" |Referees: |Matt Cecchin |Gerard Sutton |Ben Cummins |- | class=\"table-rh\" |Touch Judges: |Nick Beashel |Chris Butler |Brett Suttor |- | class=\"table-rh\" |Bunker: |Bernard Sutton |Ben Galea ! |} ==Match summary== FIRST HALF: It was a tough night for the Queensland side from the outset when Shaun Fensom was taken out of the game after a freak accident. Fensom tried to prevent a break from the Storm but was tangled up with teammate Ethan Lowe. His leg was forced sideways and his grand final was over after just three minutes with a suspected broken tibia. After a lengthy stoppage of almost 10 minutes, the Storm looked likely to score first despite some bruising defence from Antonio Winterstein. The first try came in the 19th minute when Will Chambers pounced on a loose ball 10m from his own line and beat a couple of defenders before offloading to Josh Addo-Carr, who sprinted 75m for the try. Cameron Smith converted and Storm lead 6-0. From that point on the Storm went about their business with clinical precision. As usual, it was the kicking game of Cooper Cronk which was on fire, ably supported by his captain Cameron Smith. Cronk forced a dropout with a well-weighted kick and on the resulting play in the 28th minute, Slater drew two defenders and set up Felise Kaufusi who had a clear run to the line and gave the Storm their second try. Smith converted and Storm lead 12-0. It went from bad to worse for the Cowboys moments later when Winterstein made a meal of a seemingly innocuous Cronk grubber. In a complete team performance, the \u201cBig Three\u201d had their fingerprints all over the execution of the plan and in the 37th minute, Cronk and Smith combined for Slater to slice through past Justin O\u2019Neil for the Storm\u2019s third try. Smith converted and Storm lead 18-0. Just before the half time siren, Feldt had set off on a long run after fielding a Cooper Cronk kick. The Melbourne chase reflected the sheer determination of the Storm players. SECOND HALF: After just one penalty in the opening half, the Storm conceded three in a row early in the second. It gave the Cowboys a rare sniff at the Melbourne try line and in the 47th minute, Te Maire Martin finally broke through the Storm\u2019s defence to score. It was the first points the Storm had conceded in 140 minutes of finals football. Ethan Lowe converted and the Storm lead 18-6. The Cowboys began to build pressure but couldn\u2019t make the most of further sets inside the Storm\u2019s 20. Melbourne lock Dale Finucane all but put the game to bed in the 64th minute with a barge over try on the back of an assist from Smith. Smith converted and Storm lead 24-6. The night was summed up from the Cowboys in the 67th minute when Kane Linnett coughed up the ball coming out of the defence. Curtis Scott scored a grand final try in his debut season after receiving a pass from Josh Addo- Carr. Smith missed the conversion and the Storm lead 28-6. With the game well and truly in the bag the Storm turned into the Harlem Globetrotters with Smith, Cronk, Slater and Tohu Harris combining in the 73rd minute for a party- trick to set up Addo-Carr for his second try of the night. Smith converted and the Storm lead 34-6. It was the icing on the cake for the best team of the season. Captain Cameron Smith was electric for the entire 80 minutes. He was running and kicking from dummy half, had 41 tackles and kept the entire Cowboys defence second guessing themselves every step of the way. He could have easily been awarded the Clive Churchill medal but the honour went to Billy Slater who was uncatchable finishing with 168 run metres, setting up two tries and scoring one himself with his sheer pace and vision. == Opening games == === Holden Cup NYC Grand Final === === NRL State Championship === ==Aftermath== By winning the Grand Final, the Melbourne Storm qualified for the 2018 World Club Challenge against the Super League XXII champions Leeds Rhinos. The match would be staged in Australia for only the fourth time, where the Storm defeated the Rhinos 38\u20134. ==Pre-match entertainment== American rapper Macklemore was booked to perform four songs, accompanied by singers Eric Nally and Mary Lambert, including \"Same Love\". The song topped the Australian charts in 2013, and was regarded as an anthem for same-sex marriage advocates during the campaign in Macklemore's home state of Washington. In the days leading up to the grand final, the single returned to the top of the Australian iTunes charts. Several prominent conservative politicians voiced strong opposition to the scheduled performance of \"Same Love\", given its high- profile support for the 'Yes' campaign during the voting period of the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott tweeted his disapproval of a \"politicised grand final,\" while North Queensland crossbencher Bob Katter described allowing Macklemore's grand final performance as \"tantamount to seeping sewage into the debutante ball.\" Macklemore acknowledged the controversy several days before the final, but vowed to \"go harder\" as a result. ==See also== *NRL Premiership winners *2017 NRL Finals Series ==References== Grand Final Category:NRL Grand Finals NRL Grand Final ",
