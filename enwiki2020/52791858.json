    "text": "Elliot R. McVeigh is a Professor of Bioengineering, Medicine and Radiology at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). His research utilises low dose CT imaging and MR imaging techniques to identify those people at substantially higher risk for heart attacks. ==Education== McVeigh earned a BSc in physics in 1984 and a PhD in medical biophysics in 1988 at the University of Toronto. ==Career== In 2007 he returned to Johns Hopkins to become the director of the Department of Biomedical Engineering. During his 8 year tenure as chair the department grew substantially and was continuously ranked #1 in the nation for both undergraduate and graduate training by US News & World Report. He also lead the development of a new Master\u2019s program for medical device design through the establishment of the Center of Biomedical Innovation and Design in the department. In 2015, he was hired by University of California, San Diego with a joint appointment in the school of engineering and the school of medicine. He is part of the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute (ACTRI) built by UC San Diego in La Jolla. In the Cardiovascular Imaging Lab (CViL) at UCSD, McVeigh and his team work with engineers and clinicians to develop low dose CT imaging and MR imaging techniques that will identify those people at substantially higher risk for heart attacks. ==Activities and Honors== * Fellow of American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering, 2008 * Fellows Award for Research Mentoring, National Institutes of Health, 2007 * Regional Excellence in Tech Transfer Award, Federal Laboratory Consortium, 2005 * Fellow, International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 2001 * Established Investigator Award, American Heart Association, 1995 - 1999 * Scholar, Radiological Society of North America , 1990 ==Selected publications== ==References== ==External links== * Personal Profile on Cardiovascular Imaging Lab at UCSD * Google Scholars Category:American bioinformaticians Category:Living people Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty Category:University of California, San Diego faculty Category:Scientists from California Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:1960 births Category:Fellows of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering ",
