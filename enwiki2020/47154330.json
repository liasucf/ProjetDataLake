    "text": "Adam Wilhelm Siegmund G\u00fcnther (6 February 1848 \u2013 3 February 1923) was a German geographer, mathematician, historian of mathematics and natural scientist. ==Early life== Born in 1848 to a German businessman, G\u00fcnther would go on to attend several German universities including Erlangen, Heidelberg, Leipzig, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen. ==Career== In 1872 he began teaching at a school in Weissenburg, Bavaria. He completed his habilitation thesis on continued fractions entitled Darstellung der N\u00e4herungswerte der Kettenbr\u00fcche in independenter Form in 1873. The next year he began teaching at Munich Polytechnicum. In 1876, he began teaching at a university in Ansbach where he stayed for several years before moving to Munich and becoming a professor of geography until he retired. His mathematical work included works on the determinant, hyperbolic functions, and parabolic logarithms and trigonometry.This is about connecting the rectified length of line segments along a parabola, giving logarithms for appropriate coordinates, and trigonometric values for suitable angles, in a similar way as the area under a hyperbola defines the natural logarithm, and a hyperbolic angle is defined via the area of a hyperbolically truncated triangle. ==Publications (selection) == *Darstellung der N\u00e4herungswerthe der Kettenbr\u00fcche in independenter Form.
