She is best known for being a cast member in the first two seasons of MTV's Girl Code. ==Biography== Jessimae Peluso was born in Syracuse, New York. She went to Henninger High School, and graduated with the Class of 2000. In 2001, she first started doing stand-up comedy at the ImprovBoston in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She eventually relocated to Brooklyn, so she could perform at notable venues, such as Broadway Comedy Club. In 2013, Peluso made her television debut when she became one of the cast members in MTV's Girl Code. She appeared in the first two seasons of the show, but left the show before the premiere of the third season. Although she departed from Girl Code, Peluso continued to spread her humor using social media, such as Twitter and Instagram. Using her social media, she created a running gag about her having a \"crush\" on John Stamos. Stamos had acknowledged Peluso's humor and praised her for it. Even after leaving Girl Code, Peluso kept a close relationship with former cast member, Carly Aquilino. They also have been touring different comedy clubs and doing stand-up shows together. ==References== == External links == * * Category:1982 births Category:American stand-up comedians Category:American women comedians Category:American television actresses Category:American women writers Category:Comedians from New York (state) Category:Living people Category:American sketch comedians Category:21st-century American comedians ",
