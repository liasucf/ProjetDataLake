Its lifespan in the UK was 13 years: some units were exported to Iran operating for 8 years, for a total lifespan of 21 years. ==Description== In the early 1980s British Rail were looking to replace the remaining 1950s first generation diesel multiple units on lightly used branch lines. Financial pressures precluded them ordering more heavyweight second generation units (the business case could not be made to balance) so were looking for a cheaper alternative. British Rail engineers looked at the Leyland National bus, then in widespread usage, with its modular design as a basis for the design. Several single and two car prototypes were built before an order was placed with Leyland Bus for twenty class 141 two car units in 1984. The units were notoriously unreliable, but reliability improved when the units were modified by Hunslet-Barclay between 1988 and 1989. At the same time the buckeye couplings were replaced with the BSI type fitted to the later Class 142, for more flexible working. Both axles (one driving per coach at the inner end) were fitted directly to the chassis rather than being mounted on bogies, leading to a rather rough ride especially over pointwork. Because of this, the units were generally less popular with passengers. The units were based mainly in and across West Yorkshire on routes radiating from Leeds, where they worked up until 1997 when they were replaced by Class 142. They were sponsored by West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, and were initially painted in the PTE's Verona green and buttermilk livery with \"MetroTrain\" branding, later receiving the red and cream \"Metro-Train\" livery. The units were numbered from 141001 to 141020. After modification they became 141101 to 141120, although not in order, since the opportunity was taken to match the final digits of the unit numbers with those of the vehicle numbers. ==Overseas== In 1984, a Class 141 unit was built for trial running in Malaysia and Thailand. The unit was re-gauged to metre gauge. The trial running wasn't successful. The vehicle was different from the twenty British trains having only longitudinal seating for 120 passengers and space for another 140 standing. Only 1 car was powered with the other being a trailer vehicle. After the unsuccessful trial in Thailand the Pacer went to Malaysia and then to Indonesia for further evaluation. It was last seen outside the Ulu Yam station, on a railway siding, in Malaysia in fairly derelict condition in 2000. At the end of their career with British Rail, 12 units were sold to Islamic Republic of Iran Railways and were exported during 2001/2002. with two spotted in service in 2005,http://www.phantasrail.com/Iran/130%202005.10.09%20Teheranu.jpg All units have since been withdrawn and replaced by new DMUs. Two units (106 & 112) were exported to the Netherlands, but they were scrapped in 2005. Some units remain in the United Kingdom with two units in preservation: 141108 at the Colne Valley Railway, and 141113 at the Midland Railway \u2013 Butterley. Two units (141103 and 141110) were formerly preserved at the Weardale Railway, of which 141103 and the one remaining car from 141110 were scrapped in March 2018.Railway Magazine May 2018 p. 90 ==Unit details== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
