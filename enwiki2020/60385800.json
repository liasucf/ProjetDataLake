    "text": "Scottish Forestry () is the public body responsible for forestry regulation, policy and support to private landowners in Scotland. It was formed on 1 April 2019, to take over some of the responsibilities of Forestry Commission Scotland, which was dissolved. Scottish Forestry exists alongside Forestry and Land Scotland, also established on 1 April 2019, which is responsible for managing and promoting the National Forest Estate. The Chief Executive of Scottish Forestry also holds the title of Scotland's Chief Forester, and in this role is responsible for professional standards amongst forestry staff in both Scottish Forestry and Forestry and Land Scotland. In addition to regulatory functions in Scotland, Scottish Forestry is also responsible for management of the UK Forestry Standard and the Woodland Carbon Code and for provision of economic advice on forestry: it undertakes these activities on behalf of Scotland, England and Wales under cross-border arrangements with the Forestry Commission (England) and Natural Resources Wales. Under these arrangements Wales will co-ordinate the commissioning, co-ordination and programme management of forestry research, with Forest Research remaining a separate executive agency of the Forestry Commissioners, whilst the residual Forestry Commission (now covering only England for most purposes) will continue to be responsible on behalf of the whole of the UK for co-ordinating international forestry policy support and certain plant health functions in respect of trees and forestry. Scottish Forestry is an executive agency of the Scottish Government, and is headquartered in Edinburgh. It forms part of the Scottish Government's Environment and Forestry Directorate, and reports to the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy. For organisational purposes Scottish Forestry divides Scotland into five districts, termed \"conservancies\": *Highland and Islands Conservancy, covering most of Highland and the island groups of Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides *Grampian Conservancy, covering Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray *Perth and Argyll Conservancy, covering Angus, Perth and Kinross, northern Stirling and most of Argyll and Bute *Central Scotland Conservancy, covering the Central Belt, including southern Fife, Lanarkshire, northern Ayrshire and the Isle of Arran *South Scotland Conservancy, covering Dumfries and Galloway, the Scottish Borders and southern Ayrshire ==See also== *Forestry in Scotland ==References== ==External links== *Scottish Forestry - official website Category:Organisations based in Edinburgh Category:Environmental organisations based in Scotland Category:Forestry agencies in Scotland Category:Executive agencies of the Scottish Government ",
