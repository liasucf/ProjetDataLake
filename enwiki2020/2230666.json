Although founded as a school for white students, Copiah Academy now claims that it is open to college-bound students of any race, color, creed, religion, gender, or ethnic origin, but as of the 2013-2014 school year, the student body was 98.4% non-Hispanic white in a county where the overall percentage of non-Hispanic white people was 44.9%.
