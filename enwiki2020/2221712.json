    "text": "John Ignatius Armstrong AC (10 July 1908 \u2013 10 March 1977) was an Australian politician and diplomat. He served as a Senator for New South Wales from 1938 to 1962, representing the Labor Party, and was a minister in the Chifley Government. Armstrong later served as Lord Mayor of Sydney from 1965 to 1967, and then as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1973 to 1974. ==Early life== Armstrong was born into a large Roman Catholic family in the Sydney suburb of Ultimo to William and Ellen (n\u00e9e Hannan) Armstrong, both emigrants from Ireland. He was educated at St Bede's School, Pyrmont, and at the Marist Brothers' High School, Darlinghurst. In 1934, he was elected as an alderman of Sydney Municipal Council, representing the Labor Party until 1948.Edmund Campion, 'Armstrong, John Ignatius (1908\u20131977)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/armstrong-john-ignatius-9384/text16487, published first in hardcopy 1993, accessed online 28 April 2017. ==Political career== Armstrong was selected for Labor's slate of candidates for the Australian Senate for the 1937 election partly because his name would appear high on the alphabetic ballot and he was duly elected, effective from July 1938. He married Joan Therese Josephine Curran in October 1945. During 1945, Prime Minister John Curtin's health greatly deteriorated but politicians and the media declined to publicly discuss Curtin's health for fear of concerning the Australian public during World War II. As a result, Armstrong gave a speech in the Senate on 13 June which included the first public reference to Curtin's health, and left the Australian public surprised.Abjorensen, N. (2016) The Manner of Their Going, Australian Scholarly Publishing: Kew. , p. 108. He was appointed Minister for Munitions in Ben Chifley's November 1946 ministry. In April 1948, his portfolio was merged with the Supply functions of Bill Ashley's portfolio to create the portfolio of Supply and Development and he was attacked by the opposition for the breadth of his powers. Following Labor's defeat at the 1949 election, he became deputy-leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He was relegated to an unwinnable fourth position on Labor's ticket for the 1961 election and left parliament in July 1962. ==Later life== Armstrong was elected Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1966, but the position was abolished by the Askin government in 1967. The Whitlam government appointed him Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1973 to 1974. In 1977, he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia. He died of a myocardial infarction in Batemans Bay, aged 68, survived by his wife, a son and four daughters. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:High Commissioners of Australia to the United Kingdom Category:Permanent Representatives of Australia to the International Maritime Organization Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the Cabinet of Australia Category:Mayors and Lord Mayors of Sydney Category:Lang Labor members of the Parliament of Australia Category:20th-century Australian politicians ",
