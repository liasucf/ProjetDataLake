    "text": "Covered: Recorded Live at Capitol Studios is an album by Robert Glasper and the Robert Glasper Trio released on June 16, 2015. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album but lost. It features song covers of artists like John Legend, Radiohead and Joni Mitchell with a few original tracks mixed in. ==Background== For this album, Glasper reunited with the Robert Glasper Trio whom he released his first two albums with (Canvas and In My Element) and went back to the instrumentation of his earlier sounds. Glasper used material from artists such as Radiohead, John Legend and Joni Mitchell and several different music genres to give a more straight forward sound than he put out with his other band. Three of the twelve tracks on the album were at least partially written by Glasper himself. ==Track listing== # \"Intro\" - 2:12 # \"I Don't Even Care\" - 7:42 # \"Reckoner\" - 5:07 # \"Barangrill\" - 7:06 # \"In Case You Forgot\" - 13:01 # \"So Beautiful\" - 7:39 # \"The Worst\" - 5:21 # \"Good Morning\" - 4:51 # \"Stella By Starlight\" - 4:37 # \"Levels\" - 7:38 # \"Got Over\" - 2:07 # \"I'm Dying of Thirst\" - 4:33 ==Charts== Covered peaked at number #2 on the Billboard jazz charts on July 4, 2015. ==Credits== *Robert Glasper \u2013 piano, producer *Vicente Archer \u2013 bass *Damion Reid \u2013 drums *Harry Belafonte \u2013 Composer, featured artist *Iskiner \"Skindoo\" Adefris-Yaxley \u2013 guest artist ==Reviews== Pitchfork gave the album a 6.7 noting the albums reflective, serene themes while also noting Glasper's move away from the unifying crossover sound of his recent past. John Fordham of The Guardian gave the album four out of five stars. Fordham noted that Glasper creates an 'inviting track list' by combining his 'eloquent jazz skills' with an all acoustic trio. Thom Jurek of All Music gave the album an 8 out of 10 noting that the album is a return of Glasper's acoustic trio ways but also adding how it \"cedes none of the ground gained by the Black Radio albums\". Jurek also states how this album shows how Glasper refuses to be pigeon holed into any musical category. ==Awards== Covered was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Jazz Instrumental Album but the award instead went to John Scofield for his Past Present album. ==References== ==External links== *Allmusic (Covered: The Robert Glasper Trio Recorded Live at Capitol Studios) Category:2015 albums Category:Jazz albums by American artists ",
