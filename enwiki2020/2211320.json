It was founded by George Foster in 1946 on La Brea Avenue in Inglewood, California, a location that still remains. The Fosters Freeze name comes from the fact that it is best known for its soft-serve ice milk and milkshakes, which is reflected in the marketing slogan, \"California's Original Soft Serve.\" Its mascot is an ice cream cone wearing a chef's hat. The restaurant's slogan was \"Everything at Foster's is wonderful to eat\". ==History== George Foster owned the western development rights for Dairy Queen.

In 2002, there were 122 Fosters Freeze branches, not including the 163 El Pollo Loco restaurants serving Fosters Freeze products. Over half of El Pollo Loco's locations served Fosters Freeze products until the contract's end in 2014, according to El Pollo Loco's official Facebook account.
