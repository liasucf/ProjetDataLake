    "text": "J\u00f3zef Schreier (; 18 February 1909, Drohobycz, Austria-Hungary \u2013 April 1943, Drohobycz, Occupied Poland) was a Polish mathematician of Jewish origin, known for his work in functional analysis, group theory and combinatorics. He was a member of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics and a victim of the Holocaust. J\u00f3zef Schreier was born on 18 February 1909 in Drohobycz. His father was a rabbi and doctor of philosophy. His cousin was the musician Alfred Schreyer. From 1927-31 he studied at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lw\u00f3w. In his first published paper, he defined what later came to be known as Schreier sets in order to show that not all Banach spaces possess the weak Banach-Saks property, disproving a conjecture of Stefan Banach and Stanis\u0142aw Saks. Schreier sets were later discovered independently by researchers in Ramsey theory. Schreier completed his master's degree On tournament elimination systems in 1932 under the direction of Hugo Steinhaus. Schreier correctly conjectured that to determine the second largest number in an unordered list requires at least n + \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil -2 comparisons.On tournament elimination systems, J. Schreier - Mathesis Polska, 1932 In 1934, he completed his doctorate, On finite base in topological groups under Banach.O sko\u0144czonej bazie w grupach topologicznych In 1932 he married Zofia Rosenblatt. Schreier often played blindfold chess. He was a friend of Stanis\u0142aw Ulam and co- authored eight papers with him. They were the only two undergraduates who attended the meetings at the Scottish Caf\u00e9 in Lw\u00f3w. (Schreier contributed ten questions to the Scottish Book.) Together they proved the Baire\u2013Schreier\u2013Ulam theorem and Schreier\u2013Ulam theorem. According to Ulam, With the outbreak of World War II, Eastern Poland including Drohobycz was occupied by the USSR in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. After Operation Barbarossa, this territory was invaded by Nazi Germany. The Jews of Drohobycz were confined to the Drohobycz Ghetto. In April 1943, the Germans discovered - or were informed of - an underground bunker in which Schreier was hiding with other Jews. It took three days for them to force their way in. Schreier committed suicide by cyanide rather than be captured. Of a prewar Jewish population of 10,000 in Drohobycz, approximately 400 survived the war. Schreier's wife was one of them and later moved to Israel, where she remarried. ==Publications== * ==References== * Category:1909 births Category:1943 deaths Category:People from Drohobych Category:Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe) Category:20th- century mathematicians Category:Polish mathematicians Category:Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust ",
