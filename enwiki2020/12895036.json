The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2014. Downloaded on 08 October 2015. ==Description== This species is a tree up to 25 meters tall and 80 cm in diameter. The bark is grey with darker grain. The leaves are alternately arranged with a light green petiole tinged with burgundy. The leaf blade is elliptical and leathery in texture, light bright green colored on the top, pale green on the underside, with a prominent median nerve on the bottom.

(Bolet\u00edn T\u00e9cnico Biodiversidad; No. 6, Diciembre 2011) ==Distribution and habitat== This is an endemic tree of Antioquia department, where it grows in humid forests in the pre-montane and low montane in a region known as Alto de Ventanas between the municipalities of Brice\u00f1o, Vald\u00edvia and Yarumal. It is a canopy tree and can be found on grazing lands and on the edge of small forest fragments using for protection of water courses. It grows at elevations of 1800 to 2600 m.a.s.l. ==Uses== This tree is harvested for timber and is used for furniture and wood beams. It is also grown as an ornamental plant. ==Conservation== This species is listed as Critically Endangered (CR) in the Red Book of Plants of ColombiaCalder\u00f3n S., E.; A. Cogollo P; C.

The local habitat is fragmented and degraded, in part by pasture and dairy farming use. ==Fruit production and seed collection== Magnolia polyhypsophylla produces flower buds year round, but few flowers open or lead to fruit production. Fruit collection should be done during the months of August, September and November, when fruits are most abundant. The fruits take at least 5 months to mature. Fruits are collected before or after they fall from the tree. Immature fruits may be left to ripen so that the seeds may be collected after dehiscence. The fruits are soaked and cleaned to retrieve the seeds. The seeds are sensitive to desiccation. They require no pre-germination treatment and can be sowed in a sand/soil mix. ==References== polyhypsophylla Category:Endemic flora of Colombia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
