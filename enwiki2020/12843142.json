It's a Family Affair By Kyle MacDonald KUSI-TV takes great pride in airing \"More Local News\" than any other San Diego news station. \"Everyone says that, but we can back it up,\" proudly claims Michael McKinnon Jr. the CEO of McKinnon Broadcasting and owner of KUSI - Channel 51, \"we go live for election coverage, cover more local sports, and are involved in community services\" says McKinnon naming a few ways that makes their news station unique, and unique it is. KUSI is an independent news station that operates without an affiliation from any major networks and for the most part, it has been doing so since 1982 when the station first signed on. In 1995, KUSI gained a network affiliation with San Diego's UPN outlet. However, in 1998, the station dropped its affiliation with UPN due to low ratings. Some of the advantages of not having an affiliation are that \"we own all our own content\" and \"we get to call the shots and have no time constraints\" says McKinnon. Originally from Corpus Christi, Texan Michael McKinnon Sr. formed McKinnon Broadcasting in the 1950's and aired local radio shows. McKinnon Broadcasting picked up two Texas TV stations through the years and in 1982 added San Diego's KUSI. As of August 31, 2010, KUSI is now McKinnon Broadcasting's only station property after it sold off its two Texas stations to London Broadcasting. KUSI originally signed on as a general entertainment independent station, airing children's shows, comedies, made-for-TV movies, dramas, and sports. From 1987 to 1994, KUSI found a niche in local sports. Then from 1997 until 2004, it was the over-the-air television home for the San Diego Padres baseball team. KUSI also found a dedicating following from its viewers for local football and created The Prep Pigskin Report. This is one of the station's most popular locally-produced shows and has been awarded the local Emmy award. The hour-long show airs live on Friday nights at 10:30 p.m. during football season and features highlights from nearly every high school football game in San Diego County played that evening. What makes KUSI so special and therefore successful, is that unlike most other independent television stations, KUSI allocates a significant portion of its broadcast day to news programming, but also offers syndicated programming such as Live with Regis and Kelly, The Jerry Springer Show, Judge Judy, Extra, and Montel Williams among others. \"We have eight hours of news every single day while other local news stations have only two minutes,\" states McKinnon Jr. when asked what makes his station different than other local news stations. With all of these reasons it's no wonder KUSI has found a place in the local media with the millions of dedicated San Diegan viewers. ==Magazines== ===Former=== *San Diego Home/Garden Lifestyles ==References== Category:Television broadcasting companies of the United States Category:Companies based in San Diego Category:Privately held companies based in California ",
