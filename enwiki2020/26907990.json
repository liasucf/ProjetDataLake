It was the first airplane of the IAA. The Instituto Ant\u00e1rtico Argentino (IAA; ) is the Argentine federal agency in charge of orientating, controlling, addressing and performing scientific and technical research and studies in the Antarctic. Known as Argentine Antarctica () the country claimed a sector as part of its national territory consisting of the Antarctic Peninsula and a triangular section extending to the South Pole, is delimited by the 25\u00b0 West and 74\u00b0 West meridians and the 60\u00b0 South parallel. Administratively, Argentine Antarctica is a department of the province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and South Atlantic Islands. This sector overlaps with Chilean and British claims but, under the Antarctic Treaty System, there are no attempts by Argentina or any other country to actually enforce territorial claims in Antarctica. ==Mission== According to the principles of its creation, the Instituto Ant\u00e1rtico Argentino participates with its scientific, technical and administrative staff, in a wide range of national and international programmes for a better understanding of the Antarctic. Scientists are trained and deployed on Argentine bases for researching on different fields of science, including Atmosphere, Biology, Oceanography, Weather, Chemistry, Ozone Layer, Global warming and CO2. ==History == ===Exploration prior to the IAA=== Sobral with Nordenskj\u00f6ld, circa 1903. Gral. Hern\u00e1n Pujato. Promoter and first Director of the Argentine Antarctic Institute. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sobral, who is considered in Argentina the father of the Argentine Antarctica and a national hero, began exploration at the end of 1901. In 1903, the Argentine Navy corvette ARA Uruguay commanded by Captain de Corbeta (Lieutenant commander) Juli\u00e1n Ir\u00edzar successfully rescued the Swedish expedition team of Otto Nordenskj\u00f6ld. In 1904 the Argentine permanent presence in Antarctica began with the opening of Orcadas Base on Laurie Island. Argentina was the only nation to have an Antarctic base for 40 years until the British built a base on the same islands. On April 1, 1940, the first radio communication by radio hams was made between Orcadas Base (LSX) and Buenos Aires (LU 7 ET). On February 7, 1942, an amphibious Stearman aircraft embarked on the ARA 1 de Mayo cargo ship made the first Argentine flight over Antarctica. On December 13, 1947 an Argentine Naval Aviation Douglas DC-4 piloted by Comodoro Gregorio Portillo flew over the Antarctic Circle in a 15 hours and 30 minutes flight. ===IAA=== On 17 April 1951, Hern\u00e1n Pujato founds the Instituto Antartico Argentino, by Decree N\u00ba 7338. In 1953 the San Mart\u00edn Base started operations, and Jubany base opened two years later. In 1958 the United States handed over the Ellsworth Station located in the Weddell Sea. In 1965 the Argentine military conducted a land military manoeuvre known as Operaci\u00f3n 90 in order to reach the South Pole. In the winter of 1968 at the request by the British embassy in Buenos Aires, an Argentine Navy Douglas DC-4 successfully delivered medical supplies to the British base EFE where one of its members, James K. Portwirie, was through a medical emergency. However, after a few days, Portwirie's situation worsened, making a rescue necessary. An Argentine Air Force aircraft attempted to reach the base but crashed without casualties. On August 9, in the middle of the Antarctic winter, the Argentine Navy icebreaker ARA General San Mart\u00edn was sent to rescue Portwirie. The operation was successful, gaining the thanks of the British Antarctic Survey: \u2018\u2018an internal campaign like this was never attempted before in Antarctic History\u2018\u2018.. Sir Vivian Fuchs, el vencedor del Polo Sur, dijo: \"Ruego acepte nuestras sinceras gracias por el rescate del enfermo de nuestra estaci\u00f3n en islas argentinas. Una campa\u00f1a invernal de esta naturaleza resulta sin paralelo en la historia mar\u00edtima Ant\u00e1rtica'. (Despacho R.T de Director del British Antarctic Survey) Marambio Base was founded in 1969, currently the most important Argentine base on the Antarctica. In 1975 the Esperanza Base was built, and in 1979 the General Belgrano II. In 1978, the first Antarctic baby, Emilio Palma, was born in the Fort\u00edn Sargento Cabral at the Esperanza Base. ===IAA in the 21st Century=== Almirante Ir\u00edzar icebreaker. In 2002, the Argentine Navy mounted an internal operation sending Icebreaker ARA Almirante Irizar to rescue the trapped supply vessel Magdalena Oldendorff. Even though Ir\u00edzar failed to break the Oldendorff free, she managed to move it to a safe position and re-supply the ship with food, medicines and medical personnel until the ice melted and the ship could return to open sea. In 2003, under the Decree N\u00ba 207/2003 issued by the Executive Power of Argentina, the Instituto Ant\u00e1rtico Argentino became a part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs On the 2009 summer campaign, the Argentine Air Force operated the Teniente Matienzo Base only with women for three months Una base ant\u00e1rtica exclusiva para mujeresMujeres en la Ant\u00e1rtida although there was an emergency link available with the Bell 212s helicopters stationed at Marambio Base On 2010 a Wind generator designed and built by Argentine government company CITEDEF was installed on Marambio Base DEFENSA INSTAL\u00d3 UN GENERADOR DE ENERG\u00cdA E\u00d3LICA EN LA ANT\u00c1RTIDA On 2011, three heavy lift helicopters were deployed in the Base Marambio: two Mil Mi 17 helicopters (bought in the same year), and the remaining Chinook from the Argentine Air Force. == Objectives and projects == IAA research projects cover different areas: \u2022 Atmospheric Sciences \u2022 Biological Sciences \u2022 Earth Sciences \u2022 Marine Sciences \u2022 Environmental management \u2022 Environmental chemistry \u2022 Social Sciences and Humanities To carry out these objectives, the Institute trains and prepares specialists who can perform in these areas. Research areas are decided on the basis of Antarctic issues that are discussed in international forums. Among the topics to which the research is devoted are: global warming, the thinning of the ozone layer and the study of how it is affected by the use of some gases such as CO2, fluorides, and bromides. The IAA has a structure divided into six areas: \u2022 Life Sciences Area \u2022 Earth Sciences Area \u2022 Area of Physical, Chemical and Environmental Sciences \u2022 Scientific Coordination Area \u2022 Social Sciences, Communication and Difussion Area \u2022 Administration area == See also == *Viviana Alder ==References== * Argentine Antarctica History * ARA San Martin Icebreaker ==External links== * IAA Official Website * official site Category:Argentine Antarctica Category:Antarctic agencies Category:Argentina and the Antarctic Category:Antarctic research ",
