    "text": "World Dance New York is a US home entertainment company, releasing and distributing special interest titles on DVD, video on demand, streaming media, iPhone and iPad apps, and a brand of women's dance and fitness home video products. It was founded in 2001 as \"Stratostream - World Dance New York\". \"Stratostream\" designates the company in the business-to-business environment, the home video industry, while \"World Dance New York\" is the publicly- recognized brand and the name of the consumer-facing operation of the company. ==History== World Dance New York was founded by New York-based entertainment entrepreneur Neon (dancer) to respond to the demand for instruction and fitness programs based on women\u2019s solo dance forms. The rising popularity of fitness and self-help home video and interest in creative fitness (as opposed to traditional gym-style programs) among women called for a wider range of movement disciplines and dance forms adapted for home video use. The first video releases by World Dance New York focused on belly dance and offered beginner instruction and workout programs for mass-market distribution and in- depth training programs for dance professionals. In the years following the creation of the company, it established lines of video instruction and workout products for women in a number of solo dance forms, including belly dance, stiletto dance, hip-hop dance, Brazilian samba, Flamenco, Bollywood dance, burlesque, exotic dance, go-go dancing, fire dance, hoop dance, capoeira, women\u2019s self-defense, and prenatal (maternity) fitness. It also started releasing instructional and workout products adapting partner dance styles such as salsa (dance) to solo practice and performance,and added titles featuring traditional fitness disciplines, such as strength and flexibility at-home workouts for women, as well as yoga, Pilates, and stretching programs. Non-movement categories in the World Dance New York catalog include alternative modeling, styling, hair and makeup (fantasy, pin-up girl and vintage), and esoteric arts. ==Sample home video series by genre == ===Belly dance fitness=== *The Bellydance Core Fitness Workout with Ayshe *The Bellydance Rhythms Workout with Neon *The Bellydance Shimmy Workout with Sarah Skinner *Celebration - The Bellydance Workout with Sarah Skinner *Cocktail - The Bellydance Workout with Tanna Valentine *Hard Candy - The Bellydance Workout with Neon *Liquid Gold - Bellydance Fluid Movement Workout with Neon *Love Potion - The Bellydance Workout with Neon *Luscious - The Bellydance Workout with Neon *Piece of Cake - The Bellydance Workout with Neon *Silk - The Bellydance Veil Workout with Tanna Valentine *The Tribal Fusion Bellydance Workout with Irina Akulenko *\"Instant Bellydancer\" with Neon === Stiletto Dance === *Stiletto Dance: Music Video Style with Dana Foglia *Thrills in High Heels - Stiletto Dance: Nightclub Style with Lady Morrighan *Stiletto Dance: Sensual Style with Neon ===Brazilian samba instruction and fitness=== *The Brazilian Carnival Workout with Qiuenia Ribeiro *The Cardio Samba Workout with Qiuenia Ribeiro *Dance Today!
