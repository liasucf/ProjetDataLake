He served as Prime Minister of Denmark in 1853\u201354. ==Description== The monument consists of a bronze sculpture standing on a granite plinth and measures . \u00d8rsted is depicted as an ancient wise man, sitting on a klismos and wearing a toga. He is shown in a moment of quiet contemplation, resting his left arm on the back of the chair and his chin against his hand. Under the chair stands a casket with scrolls. The casket is decorated with a relief depicting the scene where \"Memesis reads the deeds of man aloud to Jupiter\" (\"Nemesis opl\u00e6ser menneskenes gerninger for Jupiter\"). ==History== Vilhelm Bissen's marble copy of his father's 1837 plaster statue The statue was originally commissioned from Herman Wilhelm Bissen at the initiative of the art historian Niels Laurits H\u00f8yen. Bissen created a small statuette in 1835\u201336 and the original plaster model in 1836\u201337. The plan was to raise 6,000 Danish rigsdaler for a marble statue but \u00d8rsted's strong political views resulted in dwindling popularity. Orla Lehmann wrote to H\u00f8yen that \u00d8rsted wasn't a statesman but \"the servant of a F\u00fcrst\". In 1842, H\u00f8yen made a new attempt to raise the money but \u00d8rsted that same year went up against who had spoken Danish at the ' in Slesvig. This prompted H\u00f8yen to call off the fund-raising campaign. Bissen, who was known for his temper, was outraged. In about 1852, he was supposedly about the destroy the model but was stopped by force by a group of his students. Bissen died in 1868 and thus never got to see the statue completed. Vilhelm Bissen his son and student, continued his father's studio. He sold his father's \u00d8rsted plaster model to Carl Jacobsen in 1882. In 1885, Jacobsen also commissioned a marble copy from him. The outdoor monument was commissioned in connection with the 10th Nordic Jurist Meeting and financed through donations from Danish and Norwegian jurists. The bronze statue was based on Bissen Jr.'s 1885 marble copy and cast in Lauritz Rasmussen's Bronze Foundry. It was unveiled during the conference on 27 August 1902. == References == ==External links== * 1837 statue (plaster) in Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek at Kunstindeks Danmark * 1885 statue (marble) in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek at Kunstindeks Danmark * PDF about the Nordic Jurist Meetings, 1872-1972 Category:Monuments and memorials in Copenhagen Category:Outdoor sculptures in Copenhagen Category:Sculptures of men in Denmark Category:Bronze sculptures in Denmark Category:Sculptures by Herman Wilhelm Bissen Category:1937 sculptures Category:1902 establishments in Denmark Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1902 ",
