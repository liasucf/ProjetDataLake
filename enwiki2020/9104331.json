The Department of Education is one of Manitoba's oldest government departments, although its specific designation has changed several times. It was known as the Minister of Youth and Education from 1968 to 1971, before returning to its original name. On April 21, 1989, it was retitled as the Minister of Education and Training. It was further restructured as the Minister of Education, Training and Youth in 2001, the Minister of Education and Youth in 2002, the Minister of Education, Citizenship and Youth in 2003, and back to the Minister of Education in 2009. Responsibility for Training was moved to the Ministry of Advanced Education and Training in 2001, and to the Ministry of Competitiveness, Training and Trade in 2006 (renamed the Ministry of Entrepreneurship, Training and Trade in 2010). On May 3, 2016 the Pallister government returned the training portion of the ministry back to education under the name Education and Training. The current Minister of Education is Kelvin Goertzen. ==List of Ministers of Education== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" | ! width=\"30%\"|Name ! width=\"30%\"|Party ! width=\"20%\"|Took Office ! width=\"20%\"|Left Office |Alfred Boyd |No party |March 1873 |October 1873 | | | | |George Coldwell |Conservative |November 14, 1907 |May 12, 1915 |Robert Thornton |Liberal |May 12, 1915 |August 8, 1922 |John Bracken |Progressive |August 8, 1922 |December 3, 1923 |Charles Cannon |Progressive |December 3, 1923 |April 21, 1927 |rowspan=2|Robert Hoey |Progressive | April 28, 1927 | 1932 | Liberal-Progressive | 1932 | September 21, 1936 |Ivan Schultz |Liberal-Progressive |September 21, 1936 |February 5, 1944 |John C.
