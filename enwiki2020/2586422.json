Several Sri Lankan players took part in this tour, and the team which was captained by Warnapura and named Arosa Sri Lanka, left the country in secret in September 1982. The tour was unsuccessful; Arosa Sri Lanka played 12 matches and lost 10 of them, while the other two ended in draws. As a result of this tour, the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) imposed 25-year bans from all forms of cricket on all Sri Lankan players who participated, including Warnapura. Although the ban was revoked after nine years, Warnapura did not play international cricket again. He later claimed that not only financial issues but pressure from some members of the BCCSL forced them to undertake the tour, and expressed disappointment at the fact that no formal inquiry was held. ==After cricket== He has functioned as the coach of the Sri Lankan team, and has also served in its administration. Warnapura is now an official of the Asian Cricket Council ==Beyond cricket== Warnapura participated as a judge in the reality show Youth With Talent telecasted by Independent Television Network in 2016-17. ==References== ==See also== * Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 1977-78 *Ananda-Nalanda Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Sri Lanka One Day International cricketers Category:Sri Lanka Test cricketers Category:Sri Lanka Test cricket captains Category:All-Ceylon cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 1975 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1979 Cricket World Cup Category:Sri Lankan Buddhists Category:Alumni of Nalanda College, Colombo ",
