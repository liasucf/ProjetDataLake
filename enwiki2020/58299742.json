    "text": "NewsPunch is a Los Angeles-based fake news website known for spreading conspiracy theories, political misinformation and hoaxes, mixed in with real news stories. Originally named Your News Wire, it was founded in 2014 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai and Sinclair Treadway. In November 2018, it rebranded itself as NewsPunch, and began redirecting yournewswire.com traffic to newspunch.com. A 2017 BuzzFeed News report identified NewsPunch as being the second-largest source of popular fake stories spread on Facebook that year, and a June 2018 Poynter analysis identified NewsPunch as being debunked over 80 times in 2017 and 2018 by Poynter-accredited factcheckers such as Snopes, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, and the Associated Press. The European Union's East StratCom Task Force has criticized NewsPunch for spreading Russian propaganda, a charge Adl- Tabatabai denies. Regular contributors to NewsPunch include Adl-Tabatabai, a former BBC and MTV employee from London previously an employee of conspiracy theorist David Icke, Adl-Tabatabai's mother Carol Adl, an alternative health practitioner, and Baxter Dmitry, who had previously been posing as an unrelated Latvian man using a stolen profile photo. == Fake news stories == NewsPunch has published false stories, including: * Stories pushing the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory. NewsPunch was one of the first sites to propagate the conspiracy theory, publishing a falsified story that was later used as a basis for Pizzagate's viral spread among the alt-right. * Claims that the 2017 Las Vegas shootings and Manchester Arena bombings were false flags. * Anti-vaccination hoaxes alleging that Bill Gates refused to vaccinate his children and \"admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world\". * Claims that Hillary Clinton's popular vote victory in the 2016 United States Presidential election was the result of voter fraud. * Allegations that Clinton was responsible for Anthony Bourdain's suicide. * False claims that Justin Trudeau was the love child of Fidel Castro. == See also == * List of fake news websites * Fake news websites in the United States == References == Category:Fake news Category:American news websites Category:Conspiracist media Category:Harassment ",
