The building was formerly known as One HSBC Center (1999-2013) and prior to that, as Marine Midland Center (1972-1999), its name was changed in 1999 shortly after Marine Midland's parent company HSBC re-branded the bank as HSBC Bank USA. The building was constructed at a cost of $50 million between 1969 and 1974, and contains over of space. Today, the 40 story building still dominates the Buffalo skyline, at high. It is an example of modern architecture. The building's design is similar to that of the 33 South Sixth building in Minneapolis. Currently, the first five floors are undergoing a $100 million renovation by Douglas Development, set to be complete in five years. ==Building facts== *The building was designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM) and completed in 1972, with the interiors completed in 1974. The lead architect was Marc Goldstein; John Merrill was partner-in-charge. The interiors were designed by Davis Allen and Margo Grant Walsh. *The tower was the world headquarters of Marine Midland until 1998, and served as the headquarters of HSBC USA until 1999, when it moved its U. S. headquarters to New York City. *Seneca One Tower is the tallest (privately owned) office building outside of NYC in New York State. The tallest publicly owned building outside of NYC is Erastus Corning Tower in Albany, New York. *The building's plaza hosts Ronald Bladen's monumental 1973 work titled \"Vroom, Shhh.\" *The building spans the southern end of Main Street, under which the Buffalo Metro Rail passes. *On a clear day, Seneca One Tower can be seen from away along the New York State Thruway. Due to the large number of railroad overpasses in Erie County, the skyscraper can also be seen from many vantage points along Harlem Road, Union Road, the 400 expressway (as far away as Elma), areas nearby New Era Field (particularly the Lake Avenue and Abbott Road intersection), and the Grand Island bridges along the Niagara section of the Thruway. It can also be seen looking west from Route 77 in Bennington and Attica, near the windmills. The building can also be seen from the Fallsview hotels on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. ===Broadcast towers atop the building=== *WBXZ-LP (TV 56) *W275BB (FM 102.9), relays WECK *W227BW (FM 93.3), relays WZXV ==Significant former tenants== *Consulate General of Canada in Buffalo *HSBC Bank USA *Pegula Sports and EntertainmentFink, James.
