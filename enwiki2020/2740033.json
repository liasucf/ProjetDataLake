The ten episodes, which aired fortnightly in alternation with Kaleidoscope, were broadcast live from the BBC studios at Alexandra Palace.

Pinwright's Progress was written by Rodney Hobson, produced and directed by John Glyn-Jones and the script editor was Ted Kavanagh, who also wrote the BBC radio comedy series It's That Man Again. ==Cast== *James Hayter as Mr J.
