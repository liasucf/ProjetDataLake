    "text": "The 1990 NASCAR Winston Cup was the 42nd season of professional stock car racing in the United States and the 19th modern-era Cup Series. It began on Sunday, February 11, and ended on Sunday, November 18. Because of a highly controversial penalty to Mark Martin early in the season, Dale Earnhardt with Richard Childress Racing was crowned the Winston Cup champion for the fourth time, edging out Martin by 26 points. ==Teams and drivers== ===Complete schedule=== {| class=\" wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" !Make !Team ! !Driver !Crew Chief |- ! rowspan=5| Buick | rowspan=3| Bobby Allison Racing | rowspan=3| 12 | Mike Alexander | rowspan=3| Jimmy Fennig |- | Jeff Purvis |- | Hut Stricklin |- | King Racing | 26 | Brett Bodine | Larry McReynolds |- | Stavola Brothers Racing | 8 | Bobby Hillin Jr. | Harry Hyde |- ! rowspan=13 | Chevrolet | rowspan=6 | Hendrick Motorsports | 5 | Ricky Rudd | Waddell Wilson |- | rowspan=4 |17 | Darrell Waltrip | rowspan=4| Jeff Hammond |- | Jimmy Horton |- | Sarel van der Merwe |- | Greg Sacks |- | 25 | Ken Schrader | Richard Broome |- | Marcis Auto Racing | 71 | Dave Marcis | Bob Marcis |- | rowspan=2| Morgan-McClure Motorsports | rowspan=2| 4 | Phil Parsons | rowspan=2| Tony Glover |- | Ernie Irvan |- | Richard Childress Racing | 3 | Dale Earnhardt | Kirk Shelmerdine |- | rowspan=2| Travis Carter Enterprises | rowspan=2| 98 | Butch Miller | rowspan=2| Travis Carter |- | Rick Mast |- | Whitcomb Racing | 10 | Derrike Cope | Buddy Parrott |- ! rowspan=8| Ford | AK Racing | 7 | Alan Kulwicki | Paul Andrews |- | Bud Moore Engineering | 15 | Morgan Shepherd | Donnie Wingo |- | Junior Johnson & Associates | 11 | Geoffrey Bodine | Tim Brewer |- | Melling Racing | 9 | Bill Elliott | Mike Beam |- | Robert Yates Racing | 28 | Davey Allison | Jake Elder |- | Roush Racing | 6 | Mark Martin | Robin Pemberton |- | rowspan=2| Wood Brothers Racing | rowspan=2| 21 | Neil Bonnett | rowspan=2| Leonard Wood |- |Dale Jarrett |- ! rowspan=5|Oldsmobile | Hagan Racing | 94 | Sterling Marlin | Steve Loyd |- | Leo Jackson Motorsports | 33 | Harry Gant | Andy Petree |- | Moroso Racing | 20 | Rob Moroso (R) | |- | Precision Products Racing | 1 | Terry Labonte | Cliff Champion |- | RahMoc Enterprises | 75 | Rick Wilson | Bob Rahilly |- !rowspan=7| Pontiac | Bahari Racing | 30 | Michael Waltrip | Bill Ingle |- | Blue Max Racing | 27 | Rusty Wallace | Jimmy Makar |- | Cale Yarborough Motorsports | 66 | Dick Trickle | |- | Means Racing |52 | Jimmy Means | Darrell Bryant |- | Osterlund Racing | 57 | Jimmy Spencer | |- | Petty Enterprises | 43 | Richard Petty | Dale Inman |- |SABCO Racing | 42 | Kyle Petty | Gary Nelson |} ===Limited schedule=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !Manufacturer !Team ! !Race Driver !Crew Chief !Round(s) |- ! rowspan=6| Ford | Little Racing | 19 | Chad Little | |- | rowspan=2| Dick Johnson Racing | rowspan=2| 38 | Dick Johnson | rowspan=2| Ray Evernham | |- | Jim Sauter | |- | rowspan=3| Donlavey Racing | rowspan=3| 90 | Ernie Irvan | rowspan=3| Junie Donlavey | |- | Buddy Baker | |- | Charlie Glotzbach | |- |} ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" |- !

Jimmy Hensley drew the pole.

Both cars were unscored and withdrew from the race early. === Daytona 500 === The 32nd annual Daytona 500 was held on February 18 at Daytona International Speedway. Derrike Cope started off the 1990 season on a Cinderella note as he won his first ever Winston Cup race, the Daytona 500. It came when Dale Earnhardt, who had led 155 of 200 laps (at one point, leading by 25 seconds over 2nd place), ran over a piece of Rick Wilson's expired engine cutting a right rear tire in turn three on the final lap allowing Cope to shoot past for the win. Cope opted to not take a late pit stop and led briefly before relinquishing the lead in lap 196, not seeing the front again until the last lap. Ken Schrader won the pole.

Both cars were unscored and withdrew from the race early. === Pontiac Excitement 400 === The Pontiac Excitement 400 was held on February 25 at Richmond International Raceway. Ricky Rudd won the pole. Mark Martin won the race, only to lose 46 championship points after NASCAR officials discovered a somewhat oversized carburetor spacer plate in his car. This ultimately became a key factor in determining the 1990 championship. This was possibly the coldest race in NASCAR history, with a temperature in the mid-20s and winds gusting to 41 MPH, generating a wind chill of about 5 degrees. Top Ten Results # 6-Mark Martin # 3-Dale Earnhardt # 5-Ricky Rudd # 9-Bill Elliott # 66-Dick Trickle # 27-Rusty Wallace # 15-Morgan Shepherd # 26-Brett Bodine # 57-Jimmy Spencer # 25-Ken Schrader Failed to qualify: 70-J. D. McDuffie, 53-Jerry O'NeilGrand National Scene race reports from 1990 *It was admitted later that the spacer plate was actually not oversized and not technically illegal. The part was bolted on instead of welded on, thus landing in the \"gray area\" of NASCAR rules. Dale Earnhardt and his car owner, Richard Childress, who finished second in the race, protested the result because of the findings of the post-race inspection. NASCAR eventually ruled that Martin and car owner Jack Roush would keep the victory, but would lose 46 points as a result of the infraction. This has spawned many years of speculation that NASCAR was biased toward Earnhardt, the eventual seven-time champion, but given that the race was only the second of the season (27 races still remained), nobody could have foreseen that the penalty would decide the points championship at the conclusion of the season. === GM Goodwrench 500 === The GM Goodwrench 500 was held on March 4, 1990, at the North Carolina Motor Speedway. Kyle Petty won the pole and the race in the No. 42 Peak Pontiac owned by Felix Sabates and wrenched by crew chief Gary Nelson, later of NASCAR R&D.; Top Ten results # 42-Kyle Petty # 11-Geoffrey Bodine # 25-Ken Schrader -1 # 94-Sterling Marlin -2 # 27-Rusty Wallace -2 # 17-Darrell Waltrip -3 # 15-Morgan Shepherd -3 # 57-Jimmy Spencer -3 # 1-Terry Labonte -3 # 3-Dale Earnhardt -3 *This was Kyle Petty's first pole on his 277th start. Petty claimed the Unocal 76 Challenge, which had rolled over 29 times since it had last been won. Petty won a bonus of $228,400 in addition to the race purse, for an all-time NASCAR record (at the time) $284,450 single-race payday. Car owner Felix Sebates presented Petty with a Rolls Royce as a gift for winning the elusive bonus. === Motorcraft Quality Parts 500 === The Motorcraft Quality Parts 500 was held on March 18 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Dale Earnhardt won the pole and enjoyed his first win since November 1989, which was also at Atlanta. Although he was suffering from an upset stomach, Earnhardt made up a lost lap to score a narrow victory over Morgan Shepherd. The race was virtually caution free as Earnhardt led 216 of 328 laps in recording a track record race average speed of 156.849 mph.

J. Foyt, 46-Greg Sacks, 70-J. D. McDuffie *Ernie Irvan replaced Phil Parsons in the No. 4 Oldsmobile for Morgan-McClure Motorsports. This began a 3\u00bd year tenure for Irvan in the No. 4. === TranSouth 500 === The TranSouth 500 was held on April 1 at Darlington Speedway. Dale Earnhardt pulled away on two restarts in the final 18 laps and finished two car lengths in front of Mark Martin to earn his second victory of the 1990 season and second consecutive win at Darlington. The race came under some controversy, as Ernie Irvan, who was ten laps down, was racing aggressively against then-leader Ken Schrader, lost control and started a huge crash that almost ended the career of Neil Bonnett. Geoffrey Bodine started on the pole. Top Ten Results # 3-Dale Earnhardt # 6-Mark Martin # 28-Davey Allison # 11-Geoffrey Bodine # 15-Morgan Shepherd # 33-Harry Gant # 9-Bill Elliott # 26-Brett Bodine # 30-Michael Waltrip # 25-Ken Schrader -1 Failed to qualify: 48-Norm Benning, 74-Mike Potter, 82-Mark Stahl *Two cars entered by Hendrick Motorsports (The No. 46 City Chevrolet driven by Greg Sacks and the No. 51 Exxon Chevrolet driven by Hut Stricklin) were originally for the 1990 film Days of Thunder, but were not used for in-race footage. Sacks started in 7th place, but finished in 37th due to a broken crankshaft. Stricklin started in 27th place but finished in 36th after withdrawing from the race. === Valleydale Meats 500 === The Valleydale Meats 500 was held on April 8 at Bristol International Raceway. Davey Allison elected not to pit on the final caution on lap 391 while the other front runners took on fresh tires and fuel. The gamble paid off with Allison leading the rest of the way, holding off Mark Martin for an eight-inch victory at Bristol. Darrell Waltrip fell from contention with a cut tire with 25 laps left, leaving Allison, Martin, and Ricky Rudd in a bumper-to-bumper battle to the finish. Sterling Marlin was spun out with half a lap to go by Rudd. This resulted in a physical confrontation inside Rudd's transporter after the race. The No. 4 of Ernie Irvan won the pole. Michael Waltrip had a terrible crash in the previous day's Busch Series race when he hit the wall head on and his car collapsed into itself, but still managed to race in this race and finish 20th.

It became permanent after Neil Bonnett developed a case of amnesia, which left him unable to race competitively. *The #33 Skoal \"Bandit\" Leo Jackson-owned Oldsmobile, normally driven by Harry Gant; was initially supposed to be driven by Rick Wilson after Gant skipped that race due to the death of his father, only for Wilson to give way to Phil Parsons for the action race. === First Union 400 === The First Union 400 was held at North Wilkesboro Speedway on April 22, 1990. Mark Martin was the polesitter. Brett Bodine won his only Winston Cup race. Top Ten Results # 26-Brett Bodine* # 17-Darrell Waltrip # 3-Dale Earnhardt # 5-Ricky Rudd # 15-Morgan Shepherd # 6-Mark Martin # 27-Rusty Wallace # 11-Geoffrey Bodine # 28-Davey Allison # 42-Kyle Petty -1 Failed to qualify: 48-Freddie Crawford, 70-J. D. McDuffie, 76-Bill Sedgwick *Final win for Buick in NASCAR *Controversy occurred after Kenny Wallace, who was making his first start in the series crashed in turn one and brought the caution. During the caution, the pace car picked up Dale Earnhardt instead of Bodine who had fresh tires. This led to several confusions on whether who led the race (NASCAR did not have electronic time and scoring until 1993) and took 17 caution laps to sort out the scoring error. In the end, Bodine was declared as the race leader. After the race, Darrell Waltrip, who finished second, protested the victory; however, it was turned down. === Hanes Activewear 500 === The Hanes Activewear 500 was held on April 29 at Martinsville Speedway. Geoffrey Bodine won the pole, lost the lead on the first lap but held the lead four times during the race including the final 137 laps for his first win of the season at Martinsville. In an afternoon-long battle of the pit crews Rusty Wallace, Bodine's crew executed a four-tire change in 19.6 seconds during the 10th and final caution period to beat Wallace back onto the track on lap 364 and easily cruised to the checker flag. Top Ten Results # 11-Geoffrey Bodine # 27-Rusty Wallace # 15-Morgan Shepherd # 17-Darrell Waltrip # 3-Dale Earnhardt -1 # 25-Ken Schrader -2 # 6-Mark Martin -2 # 30-Michael Waltrip -3 # 66-Dick Trickle -3 # 9-Bill Elliott -3 Failed to qualify: none === Winston 500 === The Winston 500 was held on May 6 at Talladega Superspeedway. Dale Earnhardt dominated the field to lead eight times for 107 of 188 laps to earn his third win of the season. Drafting with one other driver after the sixth of seven cautions, the field was left behind when the final caution ended on the 172nd lap and Dale sped to victory. The No. 9 of Bill Elliott won the pole.* Top Ten Results # 3-Dale Earnhardt # 18-Greg Sacks # 6-Mark Martin # 4-Ernie Irvan # 30-Michael Waltrip # 1-Terry Labonte # 42-Kyle Petty -1 # 15-Morgan Shepherd -1 # 12-Hut Stricklin -1 # 17-Darrell Waltrip -1 Failed to qualify: 70-J. D. McDuffie, 80-Jimmy Horton, 82-Mark Stahl, 85-Bobby Gerhart *Bill Elliott's pole speed of 199.388 mph (48.027 seconds) is the fastest qualifying lap turned in the Winston Cup Series since restrictor plates began to be used at Daytona and Talladega. *An ESPN on-board camera caught footage of Dick Trickle smoking in his car during a caution period. === The Winston === The Winston was held May 20 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Dale Earnhardt continued his early-season domination of the Winston Cup circuit with a runaway victory in the annual All-Star event. The 1990 edition was the 6th annual running of The Winston & the second victory in the \"winners-only\" event for Earnhardt and Richard Childress Racing. Earnhardt led all 70 laps after starting from the pole position & won $325,000. Earnhardt became the first 2-time winner of the race.

Rusty Wallace emerged from early season mediocrity to announce his return to dominance with a shootout win over Bill Elliott. Wallace led 306 of the 400 laps for his first win of the season, resuming his final lead on lap 310 when Geoffrey Bodine made a green-flag pit stop. A two-lap caution beginning on lap 297 set up the duel between Wallace and Elliott, who had regained a lap he lost early in the race. The No. 25 of Ken Schrader won the pole.

Earnhardt's crew performed the unheard feat of actually fixing a blown engine and getting the car back on the track. Unfortunately, he blew his engine again later in the race. *This was Derrike Cope's 2nd and last Winston Cup win. === Banquet Frozen Foods 300 === The Banquet Frozen Foods 300 was held June 10 at Sears Point Raceway. Ricky Rudd won the pole. Rusty Wallace continued his Winston Cup road course mastery in earning his second win of the season at Sears Point. It was his fifth road course win in the last seven, finishing second in the other two. Wallace overtook Ricky Rudd on the 11th turn on lap 60 and led the rest of the way, beating Mark Martin to the caution on lap 73, earning the win under caution in the final lap. Martin overtook the Winston Cup points race at 1800.

Greg Sacks won the pole, but got involved in The Big One on lap two, which involved 24 cars and took 11 cars immediately out of the race. Dale Earnhardt dominated the race and led 127 laps on his first points race win at Daytona.

D. McDuffie*, 72-Tracy Leslie, 80-Jimmy Horton* *During practice Darrell Waltrip suffered serious injuries (multiple leg fractures, a broken arm, 9 broken ribs, a concussion) in a multi-car practice crash that was caused by a broken oil line in A. J. Foyt's No. 14 Oldsmobile car that Dale Earnhardt happened to be driving at the time (Foyt had Indycar commitments, and Earnhardt had promised to shake the car down in final practice). During the wreck, Waltrip's No. 17 Chevrolet spun out and stopped in the middle of the track with its left side facing traffic. Before he could get the car restarted, Waltrip was T-Boned by the No. 71 of Dave Marcis in the driver's door. Waltrip's injuries forced him to miss 6 races. Marcis suffered a broken leg and had to borrow J. D. McDuffie's Pontiac to start the race. McDuffie relieved him after the pace lap.Forty Years of Stock Car Racing: Forty Plus Four 1990\u20131993 by Greg Fielden, pp. 49\u201351 *Jimmy Horton, who had failed to qualify for the race, was tapped to fill in for Waltrip at Daytona and was Waltrip's relief driver 2 weeks later at Pocono. *As a result of Waltrip's crash, NASCAR thoroughly inspected Waltrip's car. Waltrip describes in his book, DW: A Lifetime Going Around in Circles, that the engine had a \"floating block in the manifold that sat under the restrictor plate.\" This was not necessarily illegal, but it was not approved by NASCAR. NASCAR forced Hendrick Motorsports (including the pole sitting No. 18 Chevrolet of Greg Sacks) and other teams to weld the blocks into proper place. This, along with his team's forgetting to put the car's spoiler back into its proper position after qualifying, resulted in the pole sitting car of Sacks essentially being a sitting duck, which more or less caused the aforementioned big one at the end of the 1st lap. *This was Dale Earnhardt's first Winston Cup points race win at Daytona === AC Spark Plug 500 === The AC Spark Plug 500 was held July 22 at Pocono Raceway. Mark Martin qualified on the top spot. Junior Johnson's team gambled on the amount of fuel in Geoffrey Bodine's tank and elected not to make a pit stop as Bodine nearly coasted to victory over Bill Elliott at Pocono. Bodine led nine times for 119 of the 200 laps. Elliott had pitted on lap 157 and needed no fuel for the finish while other contenders made fuel stops beginning with 11 laps left. After a four-lap caution, the race was restarted on the final lap and Bodine finished with a half-gallon to spare. Martin won the pole. One car that qualified for this race did not roll off the grid. Rich Vogler was set to make his Winston Cup debut at this event, but on the night before, he was killed in a sprint car race at Salem Speedway. Top Ten Results # 11-Geoffrey Bodine # 9-Bill Elliott # 27-Rusty Wallace # 3-Dale Earnhardt # 28-Davey Allison # 6-Mark Martin # 5-Ricky Rudd # 98-Butch Miller # 43-Richard Petty # 1-Terry Labonte Failed to qualify: 2-Troy Beebe, 70-J. D. McDuffie, 85-Bobby Gerhart *Darrell Waltrip actually started the race in the No. 17, and pulled in to put Jimmy Horton in the car at the end of the 1st lap. NASCAR official Dick Beaty stated the day before that he wanted Darrell to stay at the back of the field, do not pass anybody, and pull in at the end of the 1st lap for the driver change. Waltrip passed 3 or 4 cars at the start, then caught a caution that allowed him to do the driver change under yellow. Beatty then penalized the No. 17 1 lap for disobeying the earlier command (As stated in Waltrip's book, DW: A Lifetime Going Around in Circles). === Diehard 500 === The Diehard 500 was held July 29, 1990, at Talladega Superspeedway. Dale Earnhardt made it three of four major superspeedway titles so far in the 1990 season by winning the pole, leading a record-breaking 134 laps and winning the race. Earnhardt got the win by dropping behind another driver to draft and conserve fuel on lap 151, then passing him on turn four with 20 laps left, and leading the rest of the way to the checkered flag. As of 2017, this marks the only time in NASCAR history that a driver won 3 straight restrictor plate races. Amateur driver Stanley Smith was involved in a pit road mishap when he lost control of his car and hit several crew members for Tracy Leslie's team. No one was seriously injured.

D. McDuffie, 77-Ken Ragan *As the leaders came off turn 4 on the last lap, the caution was waved along with the checkered flag. No reason for the caution was ever given by the CBS announcers after the race, although photographs have shown that the No. 57 of Jimmy Spencer actually rolled over on the last lap of the race and managed to still finish 24th, 2 laps down. === Budweiser at the Glen === The Budweiser at the Glen was held at Watkins Glen International raceway on August 12, 1990. Dale Earnhardt won the pole.

He finished in 24th place after crashing late in the race. At the time, van der Merwe was racing for Rick Hendrick's Camel GT team in IMSA. *First career start for Rick Ware who later became a NASCAR Cup Series team owner. === Champion Spark Plug 400 === The Champion Spark Plug 400 was held on August 19, 1990, at Michigan International Speedway. Mark Martin started on the outside of the front row, hovered in the top five the first half of the race, then demonstrated his dominance by leading 70 of the last 100 laps to win at Michigan. Martin and Rusty Wallace linked up for a side-by- side duel on lap 124 with Martin emerging ahead never to be challenged again. He regained the lead on lap 162 after a flurry of green-flag pit stops and led the rest of the 200 laps. The No. 7 of Alan Kulwicki won the pole.

Ernie Irvan and the Morgan-McClure Motorsports team captured their first ever Winston Cup victory at Bristol. The last 50 laps of the 500-lap race was a shootout between Irvan and Rusty Wallace. Irvan never relinquished the lead to Wallace, which he gained on lap 411. Irvan finished one car length ahead of Wallace. Dale Earnhardt won the pole.

D. McDuffie, 74-Mike Potter === Heinz Southern 500 === The Heinz Southern 500 was held on September 2, 1990, at Darlington Raceway. The traditional Labor Day event saw Dale Earnhardt capture the Richard Childress Racing's fourth pole of the season before winning the race. Even with an ill-handling racecar, Earnhardt recovered, made up a lost lap and then having to battle a vibrating tire to outrun Ernie Irvan to the checkered flag. With the $200,000 payday, Dale became the first race car driver in history to pass the $11,000,000 mark in career winnings. During the race, Morgan Shepherd and Ken Schrader made contact, sending Schrader into the wall. An angry Schrader returned to the race, and rammed Shepherd into the wall, knocking both drivers out of the race.

This would be the final day race at Richmond that would be run during the fall. Dale Earnhardt won his fifth of the last nine races, gambling on his fuel mileage to lead the last 25 laps of the race. As the car coasted toward victory lane, it ran out of gas. \"We figured our only chance was to win it on gas mileage and we did,\" said Dale. \"I nursed it as much as I could for the last twenty laps and it was sputtering when I took the checkered flag. Luckily we made the right decision.\" Ernie Irvan won the pole.

Dale Earnhardt dominated, leading 291 of 400 laps, but Mark Martin snatched the leading on lap 363, and held onto it until the finish. With the win, Martin retained his 16-point advantage in the Winston Cup Championship race. Two pit stops to remove spring rubber left him in 12th place on lap 196, but by lap 288 he was in second place. On lap 263, Martin was the only driver to pass Earnhardt under green. The race was marked by tragedy, as rookie driver Rob Moroso, who finished in 21st place in this race, was killed in a highway accident hours after this race had concluded. Police reports said that Moroso was above the legal alcohol limit when he crashed.

His crew ran down pit lane with jacks and got him back on all fours but he lost a few laps. Mark Martin had a chance to capitalize on the misfortune but ended up losing a cylinder and finished 14th, 3 laps down. === AC Delco 500 === The AC Delco 500 was held October 21, 1990, at North Carolina Speedway. Alan Kulwicki led six times for 155 of 492 laps, including the last 55 after taking the lead from Bill Elliott, to post his first win since November 1988 at Phoenix International Raceway. The race ended under caution. With both finishing three laps back, the Richard Childress Racing team gained five points on Mark Martin in the Winston Cup Championship race, though Martin still held a 45-point lead with two races remaining. Ken Schrader won the pole.

Rusty Wallace won the pole. Tragedy struck during the race, when Ricky Rudd driving the Levi Garrett No. 5 locked his brakes up, lost control of the car on pit road, and struck and killed Mike Ritch, a pit crew member on Bill Elliott's team.

At this time, pit road had no speed limit, which meant that cars would blast down pit road in order to lose the least amount of time. Drivers were essentially waved into their pit stall by a sign board man who would stand out in pit lane holding up their team's pit board. (Examples of this can be seen in the film Days of Thunder.) In addition, pit road was not closed when the caution was first displayed, which would result in cars rushing into the pits before the pace car picked up the field. This was first curtailed by the banning of tire changes under caution, an extremely unpopular move (all other services were still allowed though). The pit road closing procedures (that continue today in a modified form) also began with this pit procedure. New rules for pit crews that required crews to stay on the other side of the pit wall from the cars until their car was one stall away were instituted. *Pit board men were no longer allowed to stand out in the middle of the pit lane. Lollipops, similar to what is used in most motorsport, were dangled out in the pit stall from the other side of the pit wall. In addition, each car was issued either a blue (with a white number 1 on it) or orange sticker (with a white number 2 on it). The odd numbered cars got the blue stickers while the even numbered cars got the orange stickers. Once the green flag came back out, the blue flag was put out at the end of the second lap after the restart, which allowed only the odd-numbered cars to pit for tires. At the end of the third lap after the restart, an orange flag was displayed, allowing only even- numbered cars to pit for tires. This procedure only lasted a few races before it was dumped in favor of pit road speed limits. ==Final Points Standings== #Dale Earnhardt \u2013 4430 #Mark Martin \u2013 4404 #Geoffrey Bodine \u2013 4017 #Bill Elliott \u2013 3999 #Morgan Shepherd \u2013 3689 #Rusty Wallace \u2013 3676 #Ricky Rudd \u2013 3601 #Alan Kulwicki \u2013 3599 #Ernie Irvan \u2013 3593 #Ken Schrader \u2013 3572 #Kyle Petty \u2013 3501 #Brett Bodine \u2013 3440 #Davey Allison \u2013 3423 #Sterling Marlin \u2013 3387 #Terry Labonte \u2013 3371 #Michael Waltrip \u2013 3251 #Harry Gant \u2013 3182 #Derrike Cope \u2013 3140 #Bobby Hillin Jr. \u2013 3048 #Darrell Waltrip \u2013 3013 #Dave Marcis \u2013 2944 #Dick Trickle \u2013 2863 #Rick Wilson \u2013 2666 #Jimmy Spencer \u2013 2579 #Dale Jarrett \u2013 2558 #Richard Petty \u2013 2556 #Butch Miller \u2013 2377 #Hut Stricklin \u2013 2316 #Jimmy Means \u2013 2271 #Rob Moroso \u2013 2184 #Rick Mast \u2013 1719 #Greg Sacks \u2013 1663 #Chad Little \u2013 1632 #Jack Pennington \u2013 1278 #Larry Pearson \u2013 822 #Jimmy Horton \u2013 756 #Mickey Gibbs \u2013 755 #Mike Alexander \u2013 682 #Phil Parsons \u2013 632 #J.

His top runner- up was Jack Pennington, a late-model dirt racing champion, who had 14 starts and no top-tens in an unsponsored car. The only other declarees were Jerry O'Neil and Jeff Purvis, who did not run enough races to be completely eligible for the honor. ==See also== *1990 NASCAR Busch Series ==References== *Racing Reference *Race Summaries are from Maxx Trading Card's 1990 NASCAR set. *Non- qualifiers taken from contemporary reports in Grand National Scene magazine.
