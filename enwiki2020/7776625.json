He is currently managed by Three Six Zero Group. ==Biography== Jonathan Gooch first went by the name Spor when he started music production. After a successful partnership with Renegade Hardware and Barcode Recordings, and releases with Teebee's Subtitles Recordings, in 2006, Spor and long-term friend Chris Renegade launched Lifted Music and signed music from producers such as Apex, Evol Intent, Ewun and Phace. On 24 February 2010, Spor released his second double EP, Conquerors and Commoners, on the Lifted Music label. In an interview with K Magazine, he said the title was inspired by a quote by Harlan Ellison. The album was well received by drum and bass fans, with two of the tracks from the album (\"Halogen\" and \"Kingdom\") being played on Andy C's Nightlife 5 mix CD. Spor has since then been playing his music at clubs across the world under the Lifted Music guise. Gooch was also involved in a second side project called \"Seventh Stitch\", which produced alternative IDM. Under this alias, he worked with another artist named Andrew Aker on a track entitled \"Oceans\". Gooch also has an electro house and dubstep project: Feed Me. A two-track EP titled \"Raw Chicken\" was released under deadmau5's label, mau5trap. Another track, \"Mordez Moi\" was released on Noisia's label Division alongside the group's original track \"B.R.U.L.\". He released a second EP under mau5trap on 25 December 2010, titled Feed Me's Big Adventure. It featured eight tracks, including both electro house and dubstep. His third EP of four tracks called To the Stars was released on 3 June 2011. He released another EP titled Feed Me's Escape From Electric Mountain on 6 February 2012. It features six tracks, with vocals from Hadouken! and Lindsay. On 20 August 2012, Gooch released a new single titled \"Little Cat Steps\". Soon after, it was revealed he was producing a full-length album. On 28 October, he released another single with folk band Crystal Fighters, titled \"Love Is All I Got\". The EP also features four remixes, including Gooch's \"Matilda\" remix. On 20 December, he stated on Twitter, \"One more single and two B sides, then it's album and tour time.\" The tracks were posted on his SoundCloud, and were titled \"Death by Robot\", \"Dial-Up\" and \"Flatline\". The Death by Robot EP was released on 16 January 2013. On 22 May 2013 Gooch released a series of statements on his Twitter informing his fans that, come Autumn, there will be a hiatus in his DJing. He explained to his fans, 'What I really love doing is making music, art, telling stories; being creative. I don't want a situation where this becomes a back seat.' He later tweeted, 'Seems common to assume writing music means wanting to DJ - I started by accident? It's a fun and enriching social experience but not art.' He later confirmed via Facebook that he will resume touring in 2014 after he has spent time creating a short film featuring Feed Me, established his own label, working on artwork for his shows, and writing his next studio album. Gooch has founded the record label Sotto Voce to release music under the Feed Me alias as well as provide a platform for new, aspiring artists to release their music. His debut studio album Calamari Tuesday was released on 14 October 2013 through the new label featuring 15 original tracks from his alias Feed Me, two of which were previously released as singles. It was revealed in an interview with DJ Mag that Gooch would like to release albums under each of his Spor, Feed Me and Seventh Stitch aliases in 2013. Gooch has also appeared on the podcast/radio show DVDASA on 15 January 2014. Gooch released \"Caligo\" as Spor on 19 February 2015 on his own label, Sotto Voce - the 13 track album was released via BitTorrent on a pay-what-you-want model, and included additional art and unreleased mix material. Gooch (as Spor) collaborated with producer Linguistics for an addition to the compilation album \"Mind State, Vol. 1\" in 2018. The album's proceeds benefited mental health charities and was connected to a 24-hour mental health festival. On 23 January 2019 Gooch announced via Twitter that a new album, titled \"High Street Creeps\", would be released on 22 February 2019 via mau5trap. The promotional single 'Feel Love' was released on 8 February 2019. ==Discography== ===As Feed Me=== ==== Charted studio albums ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:11.5em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22.0em;\"| Album details ! colspan=\"3\" |Peak chart positions |- !US Indie !US Dance !US Heat |- ! scope=\"row\"| Calamari Tuesday | *Released: 14 October 2013 *Label: Sotto Voce *Formats: CD, Digital download |39 |3 |6 |} ==== Charted extended plays ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! colspan=\"3\" |Peak chart positions |- !US Indie !US Dance !US Heat |- | 2012 | Feed Me's Escape From Electric Mountain |38 |13 |5 |- |2015 |A Giant Warrior Descends On Tokyo |\u2014 |16 |23 |- |2016 |Feed Me's Family Reunion |\u2014 |7 |\u2014 |} ==== Charted singles ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"3\" | Year ! rowspan=\"3\" | Title ! colspan=\"5\" |Peak chart positions |- ! colspan=\"2\" |BEL ! rowspan=\"2\" |GER ! rowspan=\"2\" |AUT ! rowspan=\"2\" |NL |- !V !W |- | 2012 | \"Love Is All I Got\" (with Crystal Fighters) |60 |18 |72 |21 |78 |} ==== Releases ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !| Year !| Title !| Type |- | 2008 | The Spell / Raw Chicken | Single |- | 2010 | Feed Me's Big Adventure | EP |- | 2011 | To the Stars | EP |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 2012 | Feed Me's Escape from Electric Mountain | EP |- | Little Cat Steps | Single |- | Love Is All I Got (with Crystal Fighters) | Single/EPFeed Me Love Is All I Got - Mau5trapLove Is All I Got - EP by Feed Me & Crystal Fighters on iTunes |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 2013 | Death by Robot | Single/EPFeed Me Death By Robot - Mau5trapDeath By Robot - Single by Feed Me on iTunes |- | Calamari Tuesday | Album |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2014 | Feed Me's Psychedelic Journey | EP |- | Far Away (with Kill the Noise) | Single |- || 2015 | A Giant Warrior Descends on Tokyo | EP |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2016 | What it Feels Like (featuring Nina Nesbitt) | Single |- | Feed Me's Family Reunion | EP |- | 2017 | Feed Me's Existential Crisis | EP |- | rowspan=\"4\"| 2019 | Feel Love (featuring Rosie Doonan) | rowspan=\"2\"| Single |- | Sleepless |- |High Street Creeps |Album |- | Little Space (featuring Yosie) | rowspan=\"5\"| Single |- | rowspan=\"4\"| 2020 | Money, Destiny |- | Coffee Black |- | New Shoes |- | Survive (with Flux Pavilion featuring Meesh) |} ====Guest appearances==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !| Year !| Title !| Appears on !| Album artist !| Catalogue number |- | 2008 | \"Mordez Moi\" | Mordez Moi / B.R.U.L. | Feed Me / Noisia | DIVISION003 |- | 2011 | \"Cott's Face\" | Meowingtons Hax Tour Trax | Various Artists | MAU5CD008 |- | 2012 | \"Thumbs Up (For Rock n' Roll)\" | Black Magic | Kill the Noise | OWS025 |- | 2015 | \"I Do Coke\" | Occult Classic | Kill the Noise | OWS120 |} ====Production credits==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !| Year !| Title !| Artist !| Album |- | rowspan=\"5\"| 2011 | \"Midnight Run\" | Example | Playing in the Shadows |- | \"Bleeding Out\" | Korn | The Path of Totality |- | \"Ebb & Flow\" (Pop Mix / Freebee Mix) | rowspan=\"3\"| Tasha Baxter | rowspan=\"2\"| Ebb & Flow - Single |- | \"Ebb & Flow\" (Original Mix) |- | \"Bikes\" || Bikes - Single |- | 2012 | \"Perfect Replacement\" | Example | The Evolution of Man |- | 2018 | \"24/7\" | Foreign Beggars | 2-2 Karma |} ====Remixes==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !| Year !| Title !| Original artist !| Release |- || 2008 | \"Knights of Cydonia\" (Feed Me Remix) | Muse | Black Holes and Revelations |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 2009 | \"If You Knew\" (Feed Me Remix) | Chris Lake feat.
