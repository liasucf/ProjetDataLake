    "text": "Woldemar Voigt (10 February 1907 - June 1980) was a German aerospace engineer, who was responsible for some of the advanced swept wing German jet-powered aircraft at the end of World War II; one of his designs for a jet bomber ended up being built in the 1950s as a British V bomber. ==Early life== His grandfather was the famous German physicicist Woldemar Voigt (1850-1919), known for Voigt notation, Voigt profile and the Voigt effect, and who introduced the term tensor in 1898. He was born in February 1907 in G\u00f6ttingen; he was the oldest of four brothers. His father was Karl Voigt (1879\u20131965). He studied at technical high school in Darmstadt, in the south of Hesse. ==Career== ===Klemm=== He worked for Klemm, designing the Klemm Kl 35. ===Messerschmitt=== RAF Museum in north London; Woldemar Voigt was head of the aircraft's design teamSharks of the Air: Willy Messerschmitt and How He Built the World\u2019s First Operational Jet Fighter He joined Messerschmitt, in Bavaria, in 1933. He was the project leader for the designs of the Messerschmitt Me 264 (four-engined bomber), Messerschmitt Me 328, and the infamous rocket-engined Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet. He oversaw the design of the swept-wing Messerschmitt P.1101 jet fighter, which was never built (by the Germans), but provided a valued contribution to early American swept-wing jet fighters. From October 1938, Messerschmitt had been looking at designs for jet fighter aircraft. He was head of the Projects Department from 1939.Messerschmitt Me 264 Amerika Bomber At Messerschmitt, other designers included Wolfgang Degel. In October 1943, the Messerschmitt design department moved to Oberammergau in southern Bavaria, on the Austrian border. The NATO School has been on the site since 1953. ===Vought=== He went to work for the American aircraft company Vought, with one of his first designs being the Vought F7U Cutlass, which was developed from German scientists' data on swept- wing jet aircraft. ==Personal life== He married Clara Hollerung (born 12 September 1911) in 1935. He died in June 1980 in America, aged 73. He had lived in Annapolis, Maryland. ==See also== * List of German aircraft projects, 1939\u201345 * List of German inventors and discoverers * Richard Vogt (aircraft designer), later worked for Boeing ==References== ==External links== * Family tree Category:1907 births Category:1980 deaths Category:German aerospace engineers Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:Messerschmitt people Category:Messerschmitt Me 262 Category:People from Annapolis, Maryland Category:People from G\u00f6ttingen Category:Vought Category:Engineers from Lower Saxony ",
