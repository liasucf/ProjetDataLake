The population was estimated at being around 100, and they lived by cultivating olives.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.150.

The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, described the village remaining structures in 1992: \"About twenty houses from the village are now occupied by the residents of Moshav Shomera. Some of the roofs have been remodeled and given a gabled form. Stones from the original houses embellish the roof of the central shelter of the moshav.\"Khalidi, 1992, p. 34 In 1994, the refugees from the seven villages, who had been classified as Palestinian refugees since 1948, were granted Lebanese citizenship.Peteet, 2005, p. 177 ==See also== *List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War *Metawali *Shia villages in Palestine ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== *Welcome to Tarbikha *Tarbikha, Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 3: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Tarbikha, at Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center *Tarbikha photos, Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh Category:District of Acre Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War ",
