    "text": "Vedette is a company, headquartered in Williamson, Georgia, USA, that manufactures and markets undergarments for women, with an emphasis on shapewear undergarments which are functionally designed to help wearers achieve a desired body form for aesthetic purposes, but can also be used as post-surgical support or to encourage posture discipline. Vedette intends to market its products towards more affluent consumers by using more costly materials, focusing on detailed design and appearance in addition to function, and borrowing design elements from intimates, lingerie, and traditional corsets. Vedette also maintains a standard product line for budget-conscious buyers and a few products for men.Torres, Amanda. \"Orion Expands Its Market Base.\" Body. 14 May 2009.
