    "text": "The Mayflower Park Hotel in Seattle, Washington is a hotel built in 1927 which claims to be the oldest continuously operating hotel in downtown Seattle. Its facade includes extensive terra cotta detailing. It was opened in 1927 as the Bergonian, built by Stefan Berg, a prominent Seattle builder who had previously built a number of other hotels in the city, as well as family homes. With 240 rooms, it was constructed in six months at a cost of $750,000. It is now a 160-room hotel, and has six meeting and banquet rooms. The hotel was renamed to the Mayflower in 1974 after it was bought for $1.1 million by a limited partnership that gave control to Marie and Birney Dempcy. The Mayflower Park had previously been in foreclosure and in need of repairs, necessitating an extensive renovation. The hotel is adjacent to the Westlake Center, a mall and office complex which was built in the 1980s and has a direct connection between the buildings. The mall's construction plan originally included demolition of the hotel, but it was saved by a lawsuit from the ownership group. It is a member of the Historic Hotels of America, and was named the \"Best Historic Hotel (76-200 Guestrooms)\" in the 2017 Historic Hotels Awards of Excellence. ==References== ==External links== *Mayflower Park Hotel, official site * Category:Hotels in Seattle Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1927 ",
