    "text": "Synergini is a tribe of tropical gall wasps in the subfamily Cynipinae. == Genera == The following genera are generally accepted within Synergini: * Agastoroxenia * Ceroptres * Lithosaphonecrus * Periclistus * Saphonecrus * Rhoophilus * Synergus * Synophromorpha * Ufo All of these except Lithosaphonecrus and Rhoophilus are found in the eastern Palearctic realm. Synergus has the greatest number of species in Synergini. A proposed reworking of the entire Cynipidae family published in 2015 transferred Ceroptres to a tribe of its own, and Periclistus and Synophromorpha to the tribe Diastrophini. In this proposed revision, Agastoroxenia, Lithonecrus, Lithosaphonecrus, Rhoophilus, Saphonecrus, Synophrus, Synergus, Ufo remain within Synergini. == Gall use == Members of Synergini have lost the ability to create their own galls, and instead make use of galls left behind by other wasps. As a result, they are classified as inquilines.Melika G, Ros-Farr\u00e9 P, P\u00e9nzes Z, \u00c1cs Z, Pujade-Villar J 2005. Ufo abei Melika et Pujade-Villar (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Synergini) new genus and new species from Japan. Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 51 (4), 313\u2013327. Species in Synergini usually make use of galls left by wasps in tribe Cynipini. Members of genus Periclistus reside in rose-cynipid galls, Synophromorpha on galls in Rubus plants, and the remainder in oak-cynipid galls. == References == Category:Cynipidae Category:Hymenoptera tribes ",
