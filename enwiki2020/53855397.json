    "text": "The March for Science was a series of protests that occurred across the United States and around the World on April 22, 2017. The protests were organized due to the perceived hostility of the Trump administration, as well as proposed budget cuts to federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institute of Health. A major goal of the march was convincing government officials to adopt policies in-line with the scientific understanding of issues such as climate change and vaccines. The organizers estimated that over one million people in 650 locations on all seven continents attended. Listed below are several hundreds of the affiliated marches. ==March locations in the United States== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |- !State ! scope=\"col\" | City ! scope=\"col\" data-sort- type=\"number\" | Estimated attendance ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Photo ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- | | Wake Island |3 | |Underwater march. |- | rowspan=\"5\" | | Auburn |250 | | |- | Birmingham |2,000 | | |- | Huntsville |1,100 | |The march ended at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center. |- | Mobile | data-sort-value=199 | hundreds | | |- | Montgomery |200 | |Attendance according to organizers. |- | rowspan=\"12\" | | Anchorage |2,000 | | |- | Atka Island |1 | | |- | Dillingham |100 | | |- | Fairbanks | data-sort-value=1001 | 1,000+ | |More than 1,000 met at Ryan Middle School for speeches, music and activities, and an up and down Airport Way.
