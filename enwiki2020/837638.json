    "text": "Anatole de Monzie Anatole de Monzie (22 November 1876, Bazas, Gironde - 11 January 1947, Paris) was a French administrator, encyclopaedist (Encyclop\u00e9die fran\u00e7aise), political figure and scholar. His father was a tax collector in Bazas, Gironde where Anatole - a name he disliked from an early age - was born in 1876. A nurse mishap resulted in an accident where the child Anatole lost the proper use of his leg and he remained crippled for the rest of his life. He never married but had several relationships. A brilliant mind, he studied in Agen before attending the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas, a famous Roman Catholic school in Paris, where he became friend with writer to be Henry de Jouvenel and Roman Catholic activist Marc Sangnier. ==Career== He studied law and started to practice but finally chose politics. He was chef de cabinet of education minister Joseph Chautemps in 1902. At about the same time, he started a career as a local politician in the Lot, a forlorn and backwater, yet charming, department in the south west of France. Successively, and very often simultaneously, he became counsellor, general, mayor of Cahors (the local prefecture), deputy and senator. Soon commanding a huge following among the local voters, pleased by his culture, his easy access to government and proficiency in handing out public sector jobs, he made of the Lot a lifelong stronghold. Member of a small centrist faction, called R\u00e9publicains Socialistes, he soon cut a fine figure in the Chambre des D\u00e9put\u00e9s because of its abilities and its central positioning. His thriving ministerial career started in 1913 when he was appointed sous-secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat \u00e0 la marine marchande. From 1918 to 1940, he occupied numerous positions in all sorts of governments and was appointed minister eighteen times. As a finance minister, he is remembered for recommending to cut the budget in 1925. He was deeply involved in the diplomatic affairs, starting a campaign for a renewal of the relations with the Holy Seat followed, in 1922, by a plea for the acknowledgment of the Soviet Union. From 1924 to 1927, he headed the Russian Affairs commission and as such dealt with some of the prominent Russian figures of that time. He started discussing the reimbursement of the Russian loans but, after the return to power of Poincar\u00e9 in 1926, the negotiation failed. Chautemps, Renoult, Herriot, de Monzie, P. Boncour, Marchandeau and Paganon leaving the \u00c9lys\u00e9e on 7 January 1933 In 1925, he also served briefly as Minister of Education and Fine Arts. He is credited for introducing philosophy in the high school curriculum, perhaps a reflect of its masonic affiliation. He also banned the teaching of local dialects in school. During a new stint as Minister of Education in the government of \u00c9douard Herriot in 1932, the name of the department was changed to \u00c9ducation nationale, a name it has kept hitherto. His policy generally promoted a free and neutral education system. Minister of Travaux publics in 1938, he was confronted to a great dockers strike, which enhanced the Left distrust for his person. Between 1938 and 1940, he led several delicate diplomatic missions. During that time of international tensions, Anatole's position was a matter of controversy. A stalwart pacifist, he was indeed actively promoting a Latin alliance between France and Italy who would mediate between Hitler and the Allies. He voted the powers to Mar\u00e9chal P\u00e9tain in 1940. Friend of Otto Abetz, Darquier de Pellepoix and Fernand de Brinon, he was nonetheless an object of hatred for many among the regime de Vichy. He was forced to resign from his mayorship in 1942. Indicted by the Comit\u00e9 national des \u00e9crivains in 1945, he died in Paris two years later. Anatole de Monzie was a scholar and something of a writer. His intellectual legacy numbers the publication of the Encyclop\u00e9die fran\u00e7aise from 1935 on. He was also connected to various French writers and intellectuals of the time, including Colette, Roland Dorgel\u00e8s, Lucien Febvre and Pierre Benoit, whom he introduced to the Lot, especially the little town of Saint-C\u00e9r\u00e9, where the writer wrote several of his works. ==Works of Anatole de Monzie== *Les R\u00e9formes scolaires, Paris, Stock, 1905 *Aux confins de la politique, Paris, Grasset, 1913 *Si resucitara !, Paris, Alcan, 1915 (sur les relations Franco- espagnoles) *Rome sans Canossa, ou la diplomatie de la pr\u00e9sence, Paris, Albin Michel, 1918 *L'entr\u00e9e au forum : vingt ans avant, Paris, Albin Michel, 1920 *La Mort de Julie, Paris, Auguste Blaizot, 1922 *Du Kremlin au Luxembourg, Paris, Delpuech, 1924 *Les Contes de Saint-C\u00e9r\u00e9, Paris, Gallimard, 1929 *Grandeur et servitude judiciaires, Paris, Kra, 1931 *Petit manuel de la Russie nouvelle, Paris, Firmin-Didot, 1931 *Livre d'oraisons, Paris, Excelsior, 1934 *Les Veuves abusives, Paris, Grasset, 1937 *Ci-devant, Paris, Flammarion, 1941 *P\u00e9tition pour l'histoire, Paris, Flammarion, 1942 *M\u00e9moires de la tribune, Paris, Correa, 1943 *La Saison des juges, Paris, Flammarion, 1943 *Le Conservatoire du peuple, Paris, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9dition d'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur, 1948 ==References== *Guillaume Lagane, Anatole de Monzie et les \u00e9lections de 1936, M\u00e9moire de Sciences Po Paris, 1992 Category:1876 births Category:1947 deaths Category:People from Gironde Category:Politicians from Nouvelle-Aquitaine Category:Republican-Socialist Party politicians Category:French Socialist Party (1919) politicians Category:Socialist Republican Union politicians Category:Transport ministers of France Category:French Ministers of National Education Category:French Ministers of Finance Category:Members of the 9th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 10th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 11th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:French Senators of the Third Republic Category:Senators of Lot (department) Category:Members of the 14th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 15th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 16th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas de Paris alumni ",
