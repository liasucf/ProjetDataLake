    "text": "Waiting for Herb is the sixth studio album by the Pogues, released in 1993, and their first without lead singer Shane MacGowan. ==Overview== The album saw the band continue to expand their musical reach past the traditional Irish roots it had been founded on, and was only their second full-length album without a single traditional song. The album featured the track \"Tuesday Morning\", which was the band's first Top Twenty hit since \"Fairytale of New York.\" With MacGowan departed, his singing and songwriting duties fell to the other members. While Spider Stacy took the role of lead vocalist, much of the songwriting fell to Jem Finer, who along with Terry Woods had previously been the most prolific songwriter apart from MacGowan. However, the album saw contributions by other members who had not written songs for the band previously, including James Fearnley, Andrew Ranken, and Darryl Hunt. Ranken also sang lead vocals on \"My Baby's Gone\". ==Track listing== ===Standard edition=== #\"Tuesday Morning\" (Spider Stacy) \u2013 3:30 #\"Smell of Petroleum\" (Jem Finer) \u2013 3:13 #\"Haunting\" (Terry Woods) \u2013 4:04 #\"Once Upon a Time\" (Finer) \u2013 3:55 #\"Sitting on Top of the World\" (Finer, James Fearnley, Woods) \u2013 3:37 #\"Drunken Boat\" (Fearnley) \u2013 6:38 #\"Big City\" (Darryl Hunt) \u2013 2:41 #\"Girl from the Wadi Hammamat\" (Finer, Andrew Ranken) \u2013 4:53 #\"Modern World\" (Hunt) \u2013 3:55 #\"Pachinko\" (Finer) \u2013 3:09 #\"My Baby's Gone\" (Finer, Ranken) \u2013 2:24 #\"Small Hours\" (Finer) \u2013 4:31 ===Bonus tracks (2004 reissue)=== # * \"First Day of Forever\" \u2013 3:20 (Philip Chevron) #\"Train Kept Rolling On\" \u2013 3:18 (Ranken) #\"Paris St. Germain\" \u2013 3:07 (Stacy, Woods) ==Personnel== ;The Pogues *Spider Stacy - vocals *Jem Finer - banjo, soprano saxophone, hurdy-gurdy, guitar, pachinko, backing vocals *James Fearnley - accordion, dulcimer, guitar, piano, harmonica, clarinet, banjo *Andrew Ranken - drums *Philip Chevron - guitar, backing vocals *Terry Woods - vocals, mandolin, concertina, cittern, banjo, bazouki *Darryl Hunt - bass, backing vocals *David Coulter - percussion, ukulele, foghorn with: *Michael Brook - guitar, keyboards, mixing, engineer, producer *Debsey Wykes - vocals *James Pinker - percussion *Hijaz Mustapha - strings ;Technical *Richard Evans - engineer, mixing *Nick Robbins - engineer *Russell Kearney - assistant engineer *Tony Cousins - mastering == References == ==External links== *Boston Irish Reporter on the Pogues after Shane Category:1993 albums Category:The Pogues albums ",
