    "text": "Flood Disaster (German original title \u2018Die Flutkatastrophe\u2019) is a 1977 Swiss short by Roger Steinmann. The film was labeled \u2018Switzerland\u2019s first disaster movie' as depicting a major water dam-break with the subsequent flooding of the metropole of Zurich. == Background == The 1937 installed dam created Switzerland largest artificial lake, the Sihlsee. A failure of the dam could lead, according to studies, to an 8-metre (26 ft) high flood wave through the lower Sihl Valley reaching the Altstadt of the city of Z\u00fcrich, the biggest city in Switzerland, within 2 hours. This threat has led the City of Z\u00fcrich to develop, publish and test evacuation plans for the affected areas of the city, and especially the area around Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof railway station. == Production == 15-year high school-student Roger Steinmann was inspired by Z\u00fcrich's frequent test-alarms in case of a dam-break. With already several years of filming experience in 1977, he realized the 'would-be'-situation of a catastrophe due to an earthquake. Some music was borrowed from Doctor Zhiwago, and some sound from Earthquake. Steinmann casted one lead-role with his class-mate, the future mathematic-professor Peter B\u00fcrgisser. == Accolades == At the second Swiss Youth Filmfestival (Schweizerischen Jugendfilmtagen) 1977, the film won the first prize. For its editing, it won the 'Silver Scissors' by the Union International of Film Amateurs in 1978. Together with an interview with filmmaker Steinmann, the film was aired on Swiss national TV on Nov 4, 1978. == External links == The Flood Disaster at IMDB == References == ",
