It was Waterstones book of the month and Faber & Faber's lead debut fiction title for spring 2006 (with its biggest ever initial print run for a first book).'Already compared with Sarah Waters, debut novelist Jane Harris will soon be everywhere, from Waterstones to Tesco', Liz Hoggard, The Observer, Sunday 19 March 2006 Retrieved 2016-07-15. ==Plot introduction== The Observations is set in Scotland in 1863 and narrated by the lively, sharp Bessy Buckley, who leaves her murky past in Glasgow and stumbles into a job as a maid at Castle Haivers, a large house outside Edinburgh. Arabella, her mistress, encourages Bessy to write her thoughts and experiences in a journal. She also subjects Bessy to odd experiments, but Bessy goes along with them because she is flattered by the attention and quickly grows attached to her mistress. Things change when Bessy snoops in Arabella's locked desk and discovers the book Arabella has been writing, The Observations, a study of the \"habits and nature of the Domestic Class.\" Bessy is incensed to read criticisms of herself in the account, and also learns of Arabella's affection for one of her predecessors, a girl who died under mysterious circumstances. Bessy concocts a revenge that ends up having consequences far more lasting than she ever envisioned \u2026 ==Reception== *Kirkus Reviews says \"Harris\u2019s story, though light on plot, is rich in character, its strength deriving almost wholly from Bessy\u2019s irrepressible and ripe narrative voice. A helter-skelter conclusion combines farce (Arabella escapes confinement and beats with a shovel the pompous cleric responsible for Nora\u2019s downfall), tragedy (another death on the railway line) and moral improvement (Bessy\u2019s virtues recognized), takes a few sideswipes at the publishing business and still leaves the door open for what Bessy might do next.\" and concludes \"Rollicking and engaging. A confident, fresh, roguishly charming first work\"In her entertaining debut, a British writer hands the job of storytelling to a saucily streetwise servant in Victorian Scotland. Retrieved 2-16-07-15. *Catherine Taylor writing in The Independent also praises Bessy's narrative voice. \"The supreme controller of this sumptuous narrative is Bessy herself, arch manipulator to the end, as she - and Harris - effortlessly show how compelling a rattling good story can be\".The Observations by Jane Harris, Watching me, watching you - aha!, The Independent, Saturday 22 April 2006 Retrieved 2016-07-15. *Joanna Briscoe, in The Guardian continues the theme, \"Jane Harris has pulled off a difficult trick, showing the heart behind the tart with genuine and affecting empathy, cleverly undercutting preconceptions that the character has, at least on the surface, fulfilled. The beleaguered but spirited protagonist's emotions are suppressed, hinted at, and beautifully described in a series of stories within stories built on shifting realities as deception is met with counter- deception. Despite the easy comparisons, this is a true one-off.\"\"Dear God, it was a gobaloon! Joanna Briscoe enjoys the raucous heroine of a Victorian pastiche\", The Guardian, Saturday 15 April 2006 Retrieved 2016-07-16. == Awards == *Prix du Premier Roman \u2013 France (2009) *Waterstone's Book of the Month (April 2006) *USA Book of the Month Club's First Fiction Prize (2007) *Waterstone's 25 Authors for the Future == Shortlistings == *The Orange Prize for Fiction (2007) *British Book Awards, Newcomer of the Year (2007) *South Bank Show / Times Breakthrough Award (2007) *The Saltire Society, First Book of the Year (2006) *Glen Dimplex New Writers Award (2006) == Publication == The Observations was published in the UK by Faber and Faber, in the US by Penguin Group, and in Australia/New Zealand by Allen & Unwin.
