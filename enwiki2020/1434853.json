Republicans lost 22 seats and the majority, while Democrats gained 28. The Civil War to date had been only weakly successful for the Union, but had wrought major, disruptive change in the size and reach of the Federal Government, which before the war had been small and little seen beyond post offices, customs houses in ports, and scattered military posts. The Republican Party was also relatively new, yet had led the Union down a radical path of rapid industrialization and destructive total war. Voters turned on the Administration. Points of dissatisfaction included failure to deliver a speedy victory at times verging on military incompetence, rising inflation, new taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of habeas corpus, conscription or the draft law, and racist fear of a future in which larger numbers of free African-Americans would compete for jobs and depress wages. For example, expressing a typical sentiment, the Cincinnati Gazette editorialized that voters \"are depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress.\"Nevins (1960), 6:318-22, quote on p. 322. Short of a majority, Republicans retained control with the support of the Unionist Party. In September 1862, President Lincoln warned the South that he planned by executive order, and as a war measure, to liberate all slaves in rebelling states as of January 1, 1863. The popularity of emancipation varied by region. It was more popular in New England and areas near the Great Lakes, and less popular in cities with large immigrant populations and in the southern portion of the North. Democrats hailed the elections as a repudiation of emancipation, but the results did not alter Lincoln's plan or hamper prosecution of the war.Voegeli (1963). In Lincoln's home district of Springfield, Illinois, John T. Stuart, a Democrat and one of Lincoln's former law partners, defeated the Republican incumbent. Racism, including fear of an influx freed slaves and a desire by white voters to prevent black suffrage, helped drive the result.Tap (1993). The sitting House Speaker, Galusha Grow of Pennsylvania, also lost re- election. He would return to the House in 1894. ==Election summaries== The eight Representatives remaining from Tennessee and Virginia in the 37th Congress were absent from the 38th Congress. Other seceded states remained unrepresented, leaving 58 vacanciesDubin, p. 197. Upon admission, West Virginia was allotted three Representatives and during the second session one seat was added for the new state of Nevada. Reapportionment transpired according to the 1860 Census, under the 1850 Apportionment Act providing a total of 233 seats. A later Act added eight seats, increasing the total to 241. {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white;\" | style=\"background:; width:39.13%\" | 72 | style=\"background:; width:1.09%\" | 2 | style=\"background:; width:46.20%\" | 85 | style=\"background:; width:13.59%\" | 25 |- | Democratic | | Republican | Unionist |} {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |- valign=bottom ! rowspan=2 | State ! rowspan=2 | Type ! rowspan=2 | Date \u2191 ! colspan=2 | Total seats ! colspan=2 | Democratic ! colspan=2 | Independent Republican ! colspan=2 | Republican ! colspan=2 | Unionist |- !
