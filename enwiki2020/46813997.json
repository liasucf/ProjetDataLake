Like fitting a house, I guess. Stripped it all out, started > again and wrote a whole new tune. Three times. It started to make me realise > the elements I actually liked. When you\u2019re too deep into a track you don\u2019t > realise which components are really working. So stripping it back and adding > them back in gradually made me realise the key points that I like. I played > with the structure and went in deeper for the more chilled, liquid roller > vibe that it is today.\" The song was originally slated for release on 3 May 2015, but got later pushed back to 15 May. ==Music video== A music video was first released onto YouTube on 22 March 2015.
