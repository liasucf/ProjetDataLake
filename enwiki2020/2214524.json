    "text": "Prince is the self-titled second studio album by American singer Prince. It was released on October 19, 1979 by Warner Bros. Records. The album was written, arranged, composed, produced and performed entirely by Prince. Overall, Prince was regarded as more diverse than For You (1978), and performed better critically and commercially. Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"This boy is going to be a big star, and he deserves it\". Prince peaked at 22 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Billboard R&B; Chart. The album contained three Billboard Hot Black Singles hits: \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\", \"Sexy Dancer\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" was Prince's first hit single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eleven while also topping the Billboard Hot Black Singles. Prince was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) four months after its release. ==Background== The album was written, arranged, composed, produced and performed entirely by Prince, with the only known contribution from another person being \"some vocal harmony\" added by close friend/bassist Andr\u00e9 Cymone on \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\". Prince recorded the album in just a few weeks after Warner Bros. asked for a follow-up to his 1978 debut, For You. Prince had used twice his initial recording advance on the album, and it had failed to generate a pop hit (although \"Soft and Wet\" became a No. 12 R&B; hit). Displeased at his lack of success, Prince quickly recorded the follow-up. === 2019 === On October 19, 2019, Prince's estate released an acoustic demo version of \"I Feel For You\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/prince-i-feel-for-you- acoustic-demo-900865/ as a single to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Prince album release. ==Critical reception== Overall, the album was much more diverse and well-received than For You, critically and commercially, selling three million copies. It is notable for containing standard R&B; ballads performed by Prince, before he would go on to establish himself with sexual romps on later albums. The album was certified platinum and contained three R&B;/dance hits: \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\", \"Sexy Dancer\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" sold over two million copies and received a platinum disc, rushing to No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 (becoming Prince's first hit single) and topped the R&B; charts. In addition, it peaked at No. 41 in the United Kingdom (his first entry in the country) and reached number 2 on the Billboard Dance/Disco Singles chart. Prince performed both \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" and \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" on American Bandstand on 26 January 1980. Overall, the success of this album geared Prince towards his next album, Dirty Mind, which would be called a complete departure from his earlier sound. Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"This boy is going to be a big star, and he deserves it\u2014he's got a great line. 'I want to come inside you' is good enough, but (in a different song) the simple 'I'm physically attracted to you' sets news standards of 'naive,' winning candor. The vulnerable teen-macho falsetto idea is pretty good too. But he does leave something to be desired in the depth-of-feeling department\u2014you know, soul.\" ==Track listing== ==Singles== * \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" b/w \"My Love is Forever\" (US #11, US R&B; #1, US Dance #2, UK #41) * \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" b/w \"Baby\" (US R&B; #13) * \"Still Waiting\" b/w \"Bambi\" (US R&B; #65) * \"Sexy Dancer\" b/w \"Bambi\"/\"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" (UK and Japan Only US Dance #2) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !
