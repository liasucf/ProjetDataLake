Einstein at work ... peers into the \u00fcber- genius's tumultuous love life (monogamy, he believes, is \"not natural\") ... his fraught emigration to the United States ...\". Busis quotes producer Ron Howard: \"When you move past his scientific contributions, Albert's life story\u2014what his youth was like, who his friends were, who his enemies were, his tumultuous love life\u2014is a story people don't know ... I think audiences are going to be riveted as we tell this ambitious and revealing human story behind Einstein's scientific brilliance.\" ====Season 2==== The second season received mixed reviews, but garnered praise for its star, Antonio Banderas. Rotten Tomatoes gave an approval rating of 59%, based on 17 reviews.
