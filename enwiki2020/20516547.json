In the fall of 1956, when he was a sophomore, he left the college. Mink says he left because he was expelled for a campus prank that he did not commit. An ESPN investigation later confirmed Mink was not the prankster. He subsequently joined the U.S. Air Force, serving for four years. After leaving the Air Force he began a 38-year career as a journalist. He was an editor with the Knoxville News Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee) from 1972 to 1985, the Kingsport Times (Kingsport, Tennessee) from 1985 to 1988, and the Harrisonburg Daily News Record (Harrisonburg, Virginia) from 1988 to 1998, and began his retirement in 1999. Although he played basketball in military tournaments and recreation leagues, he did not resume his college athletic career until 2008, so he never used up his college eligibility. He continued to compete in the National Senior Olympic Games competition in his early 80s. In 2016 Mink founded the non-profit Get Up and Go!! Foundation, designed to inspire senior citizens to live a more physical lifestyle. He performed halftime basketball exhibitions at numerous high school and college basketball arenas and was still making such appearances at age 81 in the 2016\u20132017 season. He said he planned to continue such exhibitions through the 2017\u201318 season and possibly until he reached the age of 90. == Playing college basketball as a septuagenarian == In 2007, Mink contacted several colleges in the Knoxville area to see if any would allow him to play basketball. Roane State coach, Randy Nesbit, expressed interest. Nesbit has said that he was curious about potential athletic performance of a septuagenarian who had kept himself in good physical condition. Mink enrolled as a student at Roane State and joined the team. Mink was fouled in the game against King College, giving him the opportunity to shoot two free throws, scoring on both. He continued to participate as a member of Roane State's 2008-2009 team, playing in seven games and scoring in three.
