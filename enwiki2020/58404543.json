It was released as the third single to his second major-label album Experiment on August 5, 2019. Brown wrote the song with Brock Berryhill, Matt McGinn, and Taylor Phillips, and it was produced by Dann Huff. ==Content== \"Homesick\" was co-written by Brown with Brock Berryhill, Matt McGinn, and Taylor Phillips about Brown's own \"experience traveling on the road and being away from his loved ones,\" but the singer dedicated the song to military families: \"I thought, 'There's not many songs going out these days about the military like there used to be. I felt like this would really hit home for them. Just kind of like memories of, you know, anybody dancing in a kitchen, singing favorite songs with each other.\" Brown got his inspiration for the song while at a tattoo parlor when the artist suggested he put the word 'homesick' on his knuckles, and he started writing the song on his bus before a performance at Coyote Joe's in Charlotte, North Carolina. ==Chart performance== \"Homesick\" debuted at number 24 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart dated September 22, 2018, before its initial release as a single.
