    "text": "Maple Hills is an unincorporated community located in King County, Washington, which borders the city of Renton. It is 10.632 square miles in size, and it has a population of 10,219 and a population density of 961 people per square mile.[1] Some notable features of Maple Hills are its elementary school, community pool, private community park, and Lake McDonald. The Maple Hills Maintenance Company has been operating and managing the park and pool since 1959.[2] == History of Renton == The Duwamish tribe were the first people to have inhabited the land before it was settled on by Henry Tobin in 1853.[3] After some trial and error of developing a mill and creating a functioning town, a landowner named Erasmus Smithers met Tobin\u2019s wife in 1857, and after marrying they collectively owned about 500 acres of land.[3] More settlers began to move to the area, and that growth led to the first plat of Renton to be proposed in 1875,3 and the town was finally incorporated in 1901.[4] It was not until the 1940s that Renton saw a large increase in its population.[4] The Boeing company came into Renton in 1941 to build planes during World War II, and with it brought four million dollars in federal money to aid in population expansion, which created communities like Maple Hills.[4] Today, Boeing remains Renton\u2019s largest city employer.[4] == Demographics == The residents of Maple Hills are primarily Caucasian, making up 72.8 percent of the population.1 Asians and Hispanics are the next largest race represented, making up 6.7 percent and 6.2 percent of the population, respectively.[1] The median household income is $95,702 as of 2016.[1] == Maple Hills Elementary school == Maple Hills Elementary School is photographed on May 5, 2020 on a sunny Spring afternoon. Maple Hills Elementary is one of the 15 elementary schools in the Issaquah School District[5]; all elementary schools in this district teach kindergarten through grade 5 levels.[6] Its students as well as those from Apollo, Briarwood, and Newcastle Elementary all later join together in Maywood Middle school, and those same students later go to Liberty high school.[6] Maple Hills was built in 1969, and it was later renovated in 1996 to have a central library with classrooms surrounding it.[7] Other features such as its gym, auditorium, garden, sand field, and courtyard are other relevant components of the school. == Maple Hills Pool == The Maple Hills pool consists of a 4-lane, 25-meter pool with a wading area and a baby pool.[2] There is also the main office with attached men\u2019s and women\u2019s locker rooms. The pool usually opens to the community in late May and closes in early September.[2] [8] The pool is also home to a summer league team that is a part of the Midlakes Swim League: the Maple Hills Marlins. The team has many traditions such as themed swim meets, a picnic award celebration at the end of the season, and big buddies, where an older team member acts as a mentor to a first-year swimmer.[6] Apart from the Marlins, the pool also offers swim lessons, lap swim, open swim, and can be rented for parties and events.[6] == Maple Hills Park == The park consists of two tennis courts, a playground, a baseball field, an asphalt walking path, a picnic shelter, and a soccer field.[2] The baseball and soccer fields are often used and maintained by local teams.[2] == Notable events == Each year, the community hosts an Easter egg hunt, 4th of July 5k and parade, and polar bear swim.[2] Other non-annual events have also been put on such as hot dog feeds and park cleanups.[2] \\----[1] \u201cMaple Hills neighborhood in East Renton Highlands, Washington (WA), 98027, 98038, 98058, 98059 detailed profile\u201d.
