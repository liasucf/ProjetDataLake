His compositions were well known at his time, but are largely forgotten today. == Biography == Ulfrstad was the son of teacher Mauritz Ulvestad (1858-1919) and Lisa Kvalstein (1861\u201397). After middle school exam and teacher education Ulfstad started at the Conservatory of Music in Kristiania and completed an organist examination there in 1911.

In 1914 he became organist in Krager\u00f8, and in 1917 he moved to Kristiania, where he worked as a music analyst, conductor, and music teacher.
