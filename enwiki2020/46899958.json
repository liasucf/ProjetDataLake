(November 2013)|alt= , also known as the , serves as a link between the mainland of Osaka, Japan to the artificial island in Osaka Bay on which Kansai International Airport is built. It is the longest double-decked truss bridge in the world. The bridge carries six lanes of automobile traffic on top and two of rail below, over nine truss spans. ==Structural specifications== The Sky Gate Bridge is a continuous truss bridge that measures 3,750 meters long, 29.5 meters wide (6 lanes), and 25 meters at its highest point in the center. ==History== The bridge commenced construction in June 1987, and was completed in March 1994. On 21 April 2009, management of the expressway portion of the bridge was handed over to the West Nippon Expressway Company. This expressway was numbered E71 alongside the Kansai-K\u016bk\u014d Expressway in 2016. ===Typhoon Jebi=== The bridge was damaged on 4 September 2018, by Typhoon Jebi. A 2600-ton tanker lost power and was blown into one side, severely damaging half of the automobile lanes and the rail lines. The bridge, being the sole link between the airport and the mainland, stranded approximately passengers and staff overnight at the airport. They were evacuated the next day via the ferry to nearby Kobe Airport, later joined by buses over the undamaged half of the bridge. The bridge was partially reopened to vehicle traffic on 7 March 2019 with four lanes open. The bridge's full capacity with six lanes of traffic was restored on 8 April 2019. ==Junction list== The entire expressway is in Osaka Prefecture. The sequence of kilometer posts continue from the Kansai-K\u016bk\u014d Expressway. == References == Category:1991 establishments in Japan Category:Bridges completed in 1991 Category:Bridges in Osaka Prefecture Category:Roads in Osaka Prefecture Category:Railway bridges in Japan Category:Truss bridges ",
