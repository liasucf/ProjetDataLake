Founded in 2010 by Bosun Tijani and Femi Longe, it provides a platform where technology-oriented people share ideas to solving social problems in Nigeria. Cc-HUB hosted Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, during his visit to Nigeria on August 30, 2016. ==History== Co-Creation Hub was founded in October 2010 by Bosun Tijani and Femi Longe. It officially opened in September 2011 as a social innovation centre at 294, Herbert Macaulay, Yaba, serving as an open living lab dedicated to accelerating the application of social capital and technology for economic prosperity. Its methodology is said to be hinged on engaging a community of progressive stakeholders (end-users, subject matter experts, government agencies, businesses, academics, civil societies etc.) who bring their creativity and knowledge to play in co-creating solutions to social challenges faced by the average Nigerian. At the CcHub, innovations by entrepreneurs are supported through advice, mentorship and funding through the pre-incubation and research unit. The CcHub happens to be one of the few financially sustainable innovation hubs in Africa and is the home to over 50 Nigerian startups, such as BudgIT, Wecyclers, Truppr, Genii Games, Lifebank, GoMyWay, Vacantboards, Traclist, Autobox, Stutern, Findworka, Grit Systems and Mamalette.
