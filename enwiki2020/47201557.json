You can read various content, such as celebrity's social media, Contents, e-commerce deals, and more, all in your native language. Flitto provides human-powered translations. Machine translation has its limits as it cannot reflect cultural backgrounds or other specific situation in a given context. Flitto, on the other hand, offers a full human-powered translation service which overcomes these issues. Flitto's goal is to break down all the language barriers. The service supports text, image, and voice translations, and 1:1 translation in 19 different languages (Arabic, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese) and the most recently added one is Finnish. Flitto\u2019s current user estimate is 5+ million and is being used in 170 countries, with about 300K translations submitted daily. == History == Flitto was incorporated in September 1, 2012 by founder Simon Lee along with co-founders Dan Kang and Jin Kim. The company was selected as the first Asian company to join SpringBoard incubation program in London (now Techstars London) the same year. Flitto's first official office was located at MARU180, a start-up center, located in Yeoksam-dong, Seoul. Its current office is located in Samseong- dong, Seoul. Since its inception, Flitto has been working with other global companies such as Microsoft, JYP, Google, and Naver. == Crowd-sourcing Translation == === Point === Points are required to request crowd-sourcing translation. Points can either be purchased through credit card or by mobile phone (Korea only), PayPal, AliPay, or earned by submitting translations and having them selected. === Text === Users can request texts in 18 different languages (Arabic, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese) by using points. Although Flitto shows the recommended points for each request, the user can manually change it. The requests will be pushed to different users who are capable of translating in the requested language, allowing them to translate for points. Depending on the length of the text, the user can manually divide the text into short sections so that the request can be sent to different translator-users; which can shorten the lead time since sections can be translated at the same time by different translators. In order to keep consistency for translated text, requestors can leave a memo for the translators. The translators are able to read the full text, as well as translations other users have made on other parts of the text. === Image/GPS === In situations where users feel difficult to cumbersome to make requests in form of text, they always have the option to make translation requests by simply taking a picture of the subject and posting it on Flitto. Also, using the GPS function, users can see image translations that have been done previously by other users within nearby area upon requesting image translations. === Voice === Users can also record voices/sounds and make translation requests on Flitto when they are not able to understand that particular language. == 1:1 Translation == Flitto links experienced translators from various fields such as literature, science and tech with people/companies seeking high quality translation through 1:1 translation service. 1:1 translation service allows users to directly select and make requests to translators that match his/her conditions (price, specialty, deadline). This service aims for those who have confidential business issues or need professional translations. Both requestors and translators can use 1:1 translation service on the Flitto website. The benefits as a requestor would be getting more accurate, fast and low-cost translations from professional translators; wide pool of translators to select from (over 1,000 translators); requestor can directly communicate with the translator who is on the task through the 1:1 Message service. The benefits as a translator would be the lowest commission/brokerage fees in the market and that the translator has more freedom to choose which translation projects to take on. == Other Services == === Discovery (SNS/Contents) === Popular SNS accounts ranging from celebrities to media groups are translated into different languages. Currently supported SNS platforms are Twitter, Instagram, and Weibo. Celebrities, such as K-pop star PSY and Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, have publicly endorsed the service.
