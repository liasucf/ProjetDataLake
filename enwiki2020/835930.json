It stretches from Kangaroo Bay where it borders Rosny Park, around the curved shoreline of Bellerive Esplanade to Kangaroo Bluff, then down to Bellerive Beach and east to Second Bluff, where Bellerive borders Howrah. To the north Bellerive is bordered by the small foothills of Waverly Flora Park. ==History== Bellerive was first settled in the 1820s, and at that time known as \"Kangaroo Point\", for the large numbers Kangaroos that would be seen on the shore. Even before this time a ferryman regularly crossed the Derwent, coming ashore in the Bellerive area. Following the first settlers, the area expanded rapidly, with roads to the farming districts of Clarence Plains (Rokeby), Coal River (Richmond) and Hollow Tree (Cambridge) soon developing. By the 1830s the name was changed to Bellerive (meaning \"beautiful river bank\") and the village had become the hub of eastern shore contact with Hobart, and several boats would cross between Bellerive and Sullivans Cove every day. Early on, farming and slaughterhouses where the main businesses in the area. In 1834 there were four known hotel/inn/taverns: Clarence House (1835\u20131838), Golden Fleece Inn (1823\u20131838), Highlander (1835\u20131861) and the Plough (1835\u20131866). The Wheat Sheef (1838\u20131842) opened and closed during this time. The Clarence Hotel, built in 1879, has long been both a local social centre and waiting point for ferry passengers.
