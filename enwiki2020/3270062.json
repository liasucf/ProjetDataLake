This program places great emphasis on standards-based instruction while helping students to connect learning with real-world situations. COMPASS is also in charge of the school's literary arts magazine, Visions. COMPASS is known throughout the Long Beach area as a leading arts program in public high schools. ===MBA=== (Millikan Business Academy) promotes life skills and college-preparedness with an emphasis on entrepreneurship, marketing, enterprise, and financial independence. ===PEACE=== (Personal success through Empowerment, Academic achievement, Character education, and Ethics in action) is an academy that engages such programs as stimulations (Contemporary World Project, International Negotiations and Panopticon Role Playing), hands-on learning, community service, and field experience. === QUEST=== (Questioning, Understanding, Engaging, - Success through Technology), is a GATE magnet for gifted honors students. QUEST students commit to a four-year, college preparatory program that encourages diversity of thought and scholarly endeavor. The academic independence of QUEST Scholars culminates in a self- directed Senior Project. The curriculum includes accelerated, honors, and a minimum of five Advanced Placement (AP) classes and exams. QUEST students are supported in post-secondary planning through counseling and an academic portfolio. In addition to academic studies, QUEST students are participants in campus extra- and co-curricular activities. === SEGA === Millikan's newly designed Software Engineering and Gaming Academy is a four-year college preparatory program emphasizing computer applications, programming and game design.
