    "text": "Bismuth(III) sulfide is a chemical compound of bismuth and sulfur. It occurs in nature as the mineral bismuthinite. ==Synthesis== Bismuth(III) sulfide can be prepared by reacting a bismuth(III) salt with hydrogen sulfide: :2Bi3+ +3H2S \u2192 Bi2S3 \\+ 6H+ Bismuth (III) sulfide can also be prepared by the reaction of elemental bismuth and elemental sulfur in an evacuated silica tube at 500 \u00b0C for 96 hours. :2Bi + 3S \u2192 Bi2S3 ==Properties== Bismuth(III) sulfide is isostructural with Sb2S3, stibnite. Bismuth atoms are in two different environments, both of which have 7 coordinate Bismuth atoms, 4 in a near planar rectangle and three more distant making an irregular 7-coordination group.Wells A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, 5th edition Oxford Science Publications, It can react with acids to produce the odoriferous hydrogen sulfide gas. Bismuth(III) sulfide may be produced in the body by the reaction of the common gastrointestinal drug bismuth subsalicylate with naturally occurring sulfides; this causes temporary black tongue when the sulfides are in the mouth and black feces when the sulfides are in the colon. ==Uses== It is used as a starting material to produce many other bismuth compounds.Pradyot Patnaik.
