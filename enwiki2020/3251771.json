    "text": "The Master Cutler is the head of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire established in 1624. Their role is to act as an ambassador of industry in Sheffield, England. The Master Cutler is elected by the freemen of the company on the first Monday of September of each year and the position taken in the first Tuesday of October. Despite the title, the Master Cutler does not have to be involved in the cutlery business, or even the steel industry, to be elected. The first Master Cutler was Robert Sorsby (1577-1643). His son, Malin Sorsby, was Master Cutler in 1647, and in turn his son Robert Sorsby took the office in 1669. Another Robert Sorsby, a cousin of the first, held the post in 1628. The Installation of the new Master Cutler and Company follows the annual election of the new Company. In the early years of the Company, the Election, Installation, Church Service and celebratory meal (which eventually became the Cutlers\u2019 Feast,) all happened on the same day. Now, only the Installation and Church Service, followed by lunch take place on the same day. The Master Cutler for 2020 - 2021 is Nicholas D O Williams. ==List of Master Cutlers== Brass Plaque in Cutlers' Hall Notable and recent Master Cutlers have included:Plaque in Cutlers' HallThe Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire Masters Cutler *1624 Robert Sorsby *1662 James Staniforth *1790 Joseph Ward *1808 Ebenezer Rhodes *1816 Thomas Asline Ward *1855 Frederick Mappin *1863 Thomas Jessop *1865-66 Sir John Brown *1867-9 Mark Firth *1870 William Bragge *1872 Thomas Vickers *1880 William Chesterman *1899 Robert Hadfield *1902 Albert J.

This was agreed by both the Company of Cutlers and the LNER. The then Master Cutler, A Balfour, later the 2nd Lord Riverdale, rode on the footplate of the inaugural train. It has since been a tradition that the Master Cutler ride with the driver of the train during their year of office. The Master Cutler was introduced by the LNER on 6 October 1947, running on the Great Central Main Line route from Sheffield Victoria to London Marylebone calling at and .\"Naming of LNER Master Cutler Express\" Railway Gazette 10 October 1947 page 23 Upon nationalisation the following year, the service became the responsibility of the Eastern Region of British Railways. Known to staff simply as \"The Cutler\", the train carried a restaurant car and was generally hauled by a Gresley A3 Pacific. ==References== *Mayors, Lord Mayors and Master Cutlers ==Further reading== *Clyde Binfield, David Hey (1997) Mesters to Masters: A History of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire (Oxford University Press) ==External links== *Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire Category:Economy of Sheffield ",
