Owing to his performances as a playmaker in his prime at A.C. Milan, a period marked by his creative passing, goal scoring and dribbles from midfield, Kak\u00e1 is widely considered one of the best players of his generation. With success at club and international level, he is one of eight players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or. Kak\u00e1 made his professional club debut at age 18 at S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil in 2001, and his performances with the club led him to joining Serie A club A.C. Milan in 2003. In Italy, Kak\u00e1 helped Milan finish runners up in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final with him being the top assist provider of the tournament, and named the UEFA Club Midfielder of the Year. He led Milan to win the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final and was the tournament's top goal scorer. His performances saw him win the FIFA World Player of the Year, the 2007 Ballon d'Or, the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year and the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker awards. After six years with Milan, Kak\u00e1 joined Real Madrid in 2009 for a transfer fee of \u20ac67 million, which was the second highest transfer fee at the time. However, after four injury troubled seasons in Spain, which saw his physical mobility rapidly decline, he returned to Milan for a single season in 2013, prior to joining MLS expansion club Orlando City. He initially returned to his former club S\u00e3o Paulo on loan, before relocating to the United States in 2015 and retiring in 2017. Kak\u00e1 made his debut for the Brazil national team in 2002, and was selected for their victorious FIFA World Cup squad that year, as well as the 2006 and 2010 tournaments. He was also a member of Brazil's 2005 and 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup-winning squads, winning the Golden Ball Award in 2009 as the tournament's best player. In addition to his individual awards, between 2006 and 2009 he was named in both the FIFA World XI and the UEFA Team of the Year three times. In 2010, he was named in the A.C. Milan Hall of Fame. One of the world's most famous athletes during his playing career, Kak\u00e1 was the first sportsperson to amass 10 million followers on Twitter. Off the field, Kak\u00e1 is known for his humanitarian work, where he became the youngest ambassador of the UN World Food Programme in 2004.

Kak\u00e1 was a part of the five-man midfield in the 2004\u201305 season, usually playing in a withdrawn role behind striker Andriy Shevchenko. He was supported by Gennaro Gattuso and Clarence Seedorf defensively, as well as Massimo Ambrosini, allowing Kak\u00e1 as the attacking midfielder and Rui Costa or Andrea Pirlo as the deep-lying playmaker to be in charge of creating Milan's goalscoring chances, forming a formidable midfield unit in both Italy and Europe. Milan began the season by winning the Supercoppa Italiana against Lazio. He scored seven goals in 36 domestic appearances as Milan finished runner-up in the Scudetto race. Milan also reached the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia that season.

Milan jersey in the San Siro museum Regarded as one of the best players of his generation, Kak\u00e1 has been described on the FIFA website as having the \"capacity to glide almost effortlessly past opponents, provide defence-splitting passes and score consistently from distance.\"\"Kaka Profile\". FIFA.com. Retrieved 7 June 2014 During his prime at Milan in the mid to late 2000s, and prior to the injuries he suffered at Real Madrid which affected his mobility, Kak\u00e1 was a quick, agile, hard-working, highly skilful and creative team player with great pace, ball control, movement, and balance, capable of dribbling past defenders in one on one situations as well as during counterattacks. Regarding his speed and elegance on the ball, in 2017, Karl Matchett of Bleacher Report stated: Tim Vickery of ESPN wrote, \"Kak\u00e1 running forward with the ball had the power of a freight train. He married power with finesse\", but on the impact of his knee and groin issues at Madrid, added, \"once his acceleration had been reduced, he lacked the subtlety to shine as before.\" Carl Anka of the BBC writes that his \"knee and groin problems sapped him of the explosive half-yard burst he needed to navigate the corridors of midfield uncertainty\", and that by 2009 he \"was already on the wane.\" Anka adds that being the last player to win FIFA World Player of the Year (in 2007) prior to the Messi-Ronaldo dominance over the next decade, Kak\u00e1's standing in the game has been \"lost in a haze\", with his \"greatness just out of sight\". Ronaldinho states, \"For two, maybe three seasons [at Milan] he was the best player in the world. There was nothing he couldn\u2019t do\u201d, while his Milan teammate Andrea Pirlo adds, \"There was a point when teams just had no idea how to stop him.\" As well as his dribbling from midfield, Kak\u00e1 was also renowned for his vision and passing ability, enabling him to create chances for teammates. Having performed predominantly as a playmaking attacking midfielder throughout his career, he was known for being capable of scoring goals as well as creating and assisting them. A versatile player, he was also deployed in several other attacking positions throughout his career, performing as a winger on either flank, as a supporting forward, and on occasion as an outright striker, or even in a deeper role as a midfield playmaker. In addition to these characteristics, Kak\u00e1 also possessed a powerful and accurate shot from both inside and outside the penalty area, with either foot, despite being naturally right-footed; he was also an accurate penalty taker. ==Personal life== Caroline in 2007 Kak\u00e1 married his childhood sweetheart Caroline Celico on 23 December 2005 at a Rebirth in Christ church in S\u00e3o Paulo.

During the post-match celebration following Brazil's 4\u20131 win over Argentina in the 2005 Confederations Cup final, he and several of his teammates wore T-shirts that read \"Jesus Loves You\" in various languages. While receiving the FIFA World Footballer of the Year award in 2007, he said when he was young he just wanted to be a professional player for S\u00e3o Paulo and play one game for the Brazil national team, but that \"God gave [him] more than he ever asked for.\" Though sharing a common goal, Kak\u00e1 is not currently a formal member of the organization Atletas de Cristo (\"Athletes of Christ\").
