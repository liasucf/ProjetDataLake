The song was released on March 16, 2015 through Musical Freedom, while distribution was handled by Universal Music. A music video was later published through the Spinnin' Records YouTube channel on March 18, as well as uploaded to Ti\u00ebsto's Vevo channel on April 9. The track was featured on Ti\u00ebsto's 2015 mixed compilation album Club Life: Volume Four New York City. ==Music Video== The music video features a man and a woman entering an abandoned games store. They repair the games and use the batteries on their bugs on their necks. This gives them the power to activate games by touching them, such as a motorcycle game and laser shooting guns. When they were playing the laser shooting gun game, the man sees a safe and discovers some money inside of it. The woman sees the man stealing the money, and is very disappointed in him and activates the alarm. Shocked at the alarm, he exits the store to find the police rounding the store. Actually, the man is wearing a VR headset and the woman is his wife, sleeping in bed next to him. == Tracklist == ;Digital download (MF120) # \"Secrets\" - 4:27 ;Digital download (MF131) # \"Secrets\" (Don Diablo's VIP Mix) \\- 4:19 ; Digital download (PM:AM) # \"Secrets\" (Radio Edit) \\- 3:36 ; Digital download / Remixes (PM:AM) # \"Secrets\" (Future House Extended) \\- 3:20 # \"Secrets\" (Don Diablo Remix) \\- 4:15 # \"Secrets\" (Don Diablo's VIP Mix) \\- 4:19 # \"Secrets\" (David Zowie Remix) \\- 4:58 # \"Secrets\" (Felon Remix) \\- 5:02 # \"Secrets\" (ZAXX & Jaylex Remix) \\- 3:19 # \"Secrets\" (Riggi & Piros Remix) \\- 3:38 ;2017 7\" blue vinyl # \"Secrets\" (Extended Mix) \\- 4:27 # \"Secrets\" (Radio Edit) \\- 3:37 ==Credits and personnel== *Songwriting - Tijs Verwest, Niles Hollowell-Dhar, Vasiliki Karagiorgos, Phil Bentley *Production - Ti\u00ebsto, KSHMR *Vocals - VASSY *Label: Musical Freedom / Spinnin' Records ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgium Airplay (Ultratop Wallonia)\"Ultratop.be \u2013 Ti\u00ebsto & KSHMR feat.
