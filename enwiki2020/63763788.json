    "text": "Bold text Snip & Sketch, originally called Screen Sketch, is a Microsoft Windows screenshot utility included in Windows 10 Version 1607 (Anniversary Update) and later. It can take still screenshots of an open window, rectangular areas, a free-form area, or the entire screen. Snips can then be annotated using a mouse or a tablet, stored as an image file (PNG, GIF, or JPEG formats), copied to the clipboard, e-mailed, or shared with another supported UWP app. Snip & Sketch allows for basic image editing of the snapshot, with different colored pens, pencils, an eraser, and a highlighter. Before Snip & Sketch, Snipping Tool was included as a PowerToy for the Microsoft Tablet PC launch on November 7, 2002, and on all editions starting in Windows Vista. Currently, both apps are available on Windows 10. Similar to Snipping Tool, Snip & Sketch includes a delay function, but the time options are different. Snip & Sketch only includes delay options of three seconds or ten seconds. The delay function is valuable for taking a screenshot showing context menus, or handles that appear around a graphic object when that object is selected. Without the delay feature it would not be possible to take a screenshot showing context menus and object handles because these disappear when any other item (such as Snip & Sketch itself) is clicked on. To use the delay feature, one opens Snip & Sketch, clicks on the chevron next to the New button, and chooses a delay. Then during that delay, one clicks on the button for the handler at the top of the screen to choose a mode, selects an area of the screen, and waits for the delay to lapse. At the end of the delay, Snip & Sketch automatically becomes active without the user having to click, and therefore the context menu or object handles do not disappear and a screenshot can be taken of them. Snip & Sketch can be launched with the Win+Shift+S keyboard shortcut. ==See also== * Screenshot software * Windows 10 version history * Grab, a similar utility in Mac OS X ==References== ==External links== * Support document Category:Windows components ",
