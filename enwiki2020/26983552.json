    "text": "Cryoturris is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Mangeliidae. ==Description== The shell is small or medium-sized, slender or moderately slender. The whorls are angulated at the periphery or rounded. The protoconch is slender or moderately slender, the apex generally rising abruptly, consisting of about 2\u00bd or 3 whorls. The body whorl or half whorl bears curved, protractive axial riblets and generally bulges at its periphery. The aperture is moderately narrow. The anterior canal is very short or hardly differentiated, slightly emarginate. The outer lip is simple, except at intervals corresponding to position of varixlike ribs. The anal notch is wide, shallow, or moderately deep. The sculpture consists of axial ribs, overridden by fine spiral threads and by microscopic frosted spiral threads. This genus is the tropical representation of the temperate genus Kurtziella with a similar aperture and sculpture. ==Species== Species within the genus Cryoturris include: * Cryoturris adamsii (E. A. Smith, 1884) * Cryoturris albida (C.B. Adams, 1845) * \u2020 Cryoturris aptera W.P.
