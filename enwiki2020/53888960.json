According to the United States Census of 1940, seventeen-year-old Alice was still living that year with her parents in Salt Lake City, along with her two sisters, Lorraine and Virginia. The 1940 census further documents that her father was at that time a salesman of rock-wool insulation. In Salt Lake City, Backes also attended the University of Utah, where she distinguished herself as a gifted violinist, earning a position as \"concert mistress\" in the university's symphony orchestra. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, she joined the WAVES, the women's branch of the United States Naval Reserve. She served stateside at WAVE \"shore stations\" working primarily as a jeep driver in and around Chicago and then San Francisco. ==Career== Following the war, Backes moved to Hollywood, where by the late 1940s she began finding steady employment as an actor. In 1948 she performed in an uncredited role as a Swedish immigrant girl in the film Up in Central Park. The bulk of her work, however, in this early stage of her career was as a voice-actor on radio. Between 1946 and 1950, she was a cast member on a variety of popular radio programs such as This is Your FBI, NBC University Theater, Dangerous Assignment, and Family Theater.Old Time Radio Downloads (OTR), \"Radio Stars\"/\"Alice Backes\"; website listings of some of the radio series on which Backes performed in the late 1940s to mid-1950s; retrieved April 24, 2017. Backes continued performing regularly on radio for at least another six years, even after her increasing work on television had become her principal focus. Some of the other radio programs on which she played a variety of characters were The Whistler, The Halls of Ivy, Dragnet, Suspense, and Romance. ===Television=== During the 1950s, Backes appeared in over 20 television series, both in dramatic and comedic supporting roles.

In those decades she either appeared for the first time or returned to perform in more than 60 sitcoms, Westerns, detective, courtroom and medical shows, anthology series, suspense programs, and made-for- television movies. In the 1963 episode of The Andy Griffith Show, \"Ernest T. Joins the Army\", she played Olive, the widowed waitress working at Mayberry's diner.

The couple married in 1961 and remained together for over 20 years, until Milton's death in April 1983. They had no children. After her retirement from acting in the late 1990s, Backes continued to devote her time to charities and to her lifelong passion for music, studying the works of the classical masters as well as Broadway scores and early choral compositions. Backes remained in Los Angeles until 2006, when she relocated to Virginia Beach, Virginia to be closer to family members. The following year, on March 15, Backes died in her sleep of natural causes at the age of 83. In accordance with her wishes and under arrangements made with the Neptune Society, her body was cremated, and her ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
