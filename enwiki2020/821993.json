Brugui\u00e8re was born in Montpellier on 19 July 1749. Comptes rendus du Congr\u00e8s national des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s savantes: Section des sciences. (1961) page 173. author and title of article? He was a doctor, connected to the University of Montpellier. He was interested in invertebrates, mostly snails (gastropods). He accompanied the explorer Kerguelen-Tr\u00e9marec on his first voyage to the Antarctic in 1773. In 1790 he accompanied the entomologist Olivier on an expedition to Persia, but his poor health didn't allow him to continue. In 1792, although he was ill, he visited the Greek archipelago and the Middle East, together with the entomologist Guillaume-Antoine Olivier. He was asked by the French Directoire to try to set up a Franco-Persian alliance, but was unsuccessful, lacking the training of a diplomat. He died on the voyage back. He described several taxa in his book Tableau Encyclop\u00e9dique et M\u00e9thodique des trois R\u00e8gnes de la Nature: vers, coquilles, mollusques et polypes divers) which appeared in three volumes in 1827, long after he had died. He also wrote Histoire Naturelle des Vers. Vol. 1 (1792) but he had to stop at the letter \"C\". Christian Hee Hwass continued his work and wrote most of it. He died in Ancona in October 1798 (and not in 1799, as mentioned in some sources; there was a discrepancy due to the French revolutionary calendar). He was mainly interested in molluscs and other invertebrates, as can be seen in the following list of the taxa he named. == Authority == He named more than 140 marine genera or species, among them : ;Genera *Anodontites Brugui\u00e8re, 1792 (mollusc) *Cerithium Brugui\u00e8re, 1789 (mollusc) *Cerithium subg.
