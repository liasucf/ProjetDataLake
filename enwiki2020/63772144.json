    "text": "Pisuviricota is a phylum of RNA viruses, which includes all positive-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses, which infect eukaryotes and are not members of the phylum Kitrinoviricota, Lenarviricota, or Duplornaviricota. The name of the group is a portmanteau of \u201cpicornavirus supergroup\u201d and -viricota which is the suffix for a virus phylum. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that Birnaviridae and Permutotetraviridae, both currently unassigned to a phylum in Orthornavirae, also belong to this phylum and that both are sister groups. ==Classes== Phylogenetic tree of Pisuviricota (top), genome of different members and major conserved proteins (bottom) The following classes are recognized: * Duplopiviricetes * Pisoniviricetes * Stelpaviricetes ==References== Category:Viruses ",
