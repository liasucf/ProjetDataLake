    "text": "Gabriele Tergit Promenade in Berlin Gabriele Tergit (pseudonym for Elise Reifenberg n\u00e9e Hirschmann) (4 March 1894 - 25 July 1982) was a German-born British writer and journalist. She became known primarily for her court reports, and as a writer, for her novel K\u00e4sebier conquers the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (K\u00e4sebier erobert den Kurf\u00fcrstendamm; in translation published under the title K\u00e4sebier Takes Berlin). Tergit served as secretary of the PEN-Center of German-language Authors Abroad. Tergit was the mother of mathematician Ernst Robert Reifenberg. == Early life and education == Elise Hirschmann was born in Berlin, 4 March 1894. At the age of 19, she published her first newspaper article in a supplement of the Berliner Tageblatt in 1915. It was a piece on the problems of women in wartime. She interrupted her first attempt at entering the newspaper industry because the press was generally conceived to be no place for young women of upper-class backgrounds. She then studied history and philosophy at multiple German universities, eventually earning her doctorate in 1925 at the University of Frankfurt am Main under the supervision of the historians Freidrich Meinecke and Erich Marcks. ==Career== Starting in 1920, Tergit published in the feuilletons of the Vossische Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt. During this time, Tergit became well known to the German newsreading public as a court-room reporter at the Berliner Tageblatt. She was amongst a group of reporters who introduced literary sensibilities to court- room reporting. Articles of her criticizing injustice or reactionary judges were also printed in the journal Die Weltb\u00fchne, which was published by Carl von Ossietzky. In 1928, she married the architect Heinz Reifenberg. Her d\u00e9but novel, K\u00e4sebier erobert den Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, appeared in 1932 and made her famous. Due to her critical assessment of processes involving Nazis, a horde of SA-men tried to force their way into her apartment in March 1933. She then flew to Spindlerm\u00fchle, and later moved to Palestine. From 1938, she lived in London. She had already started her historical novel Effingers which deals with several generations of a German-Jewish family and which is sometimes dubbed the \"Jewish Buddenbrooks\". It was published in 1951 but had only limited success at the time of publication. Tergit died in London, 25 July 1982. Posthumously, her recollections, Etwas Seltenes \u00fcberhaupt, appeared in 1983. A street in Berlin is named after her. == Works == * K\u00e4sebier erobert den Kurf\u00fcrstendamm.
