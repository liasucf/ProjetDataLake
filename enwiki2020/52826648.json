    "text": "Liam Bowe (born 23 September 1997) is an Australian cricketer. He made his Twenty20 (T20) debut for Melbourne Stars in the 2016\u201317 Big Bash League season on 10 January 2017. Bowe opts to play in glasses rather than contact lenses in the field. Due to this and a good debut match, he was affectionately nicknamed \"cricket's Harry Potter\" by fans, later adopting the nickname \"The Wizard\". This nickname, as well as the use of his glasses, saw him established as a cult hero immediately after his debut. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Australian cricketers Category:Melbourne Stars cricketers Category:Sydney Thunder cricketers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
