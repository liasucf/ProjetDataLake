These RNA viruses have genes made from RNA and not DNA, and their whole genome \u2013 that is the number of nucleotides \u2013 is always a multiple of six. This is because during their replication, these viruses are dependent on nucleoprotein molecules that each bind to six nucleotides.. ==References== Category:Paramyxoviridae Category:Genetics ",
