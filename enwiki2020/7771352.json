He also has a Spanish passport, having spent over a decade playing in the country mainly with Numancia (eight years, 83 La Liga games). ==Club career== N\u00fa\u00f1ez was born in Rivera. After playing in his country with Centro Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix, C.A. Cerro and C.A. Rentistas he moved to Spain in 1999, signing with CD Numancia. An undisputed starter in his first two seasons (both in La Liga, playing a combined 72 games) he started struggling for a starting XI berth onwards, and was majorly a backup in the rest of his Soria career, which was almost entirely spent in the second division. After nine matches in 2007\u201308, as Numancia returned to the top flight after three years, N\u00fa\u00f1ez left the club but stayed in the country, joining lowly CD Guadalajara. He retired in June 2011, at the age of 38. ==International career== N\u00fa\u00f1ez won one cap for Uruguay, and was a backup at the 1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica. ==Honours== ===Club=== *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 2007\u201308 ===International=== *Copa Am\u00e9rica: Runner-up 1999 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Uruguayan people of Spanish descent Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Centro Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix players Category:C.A.
