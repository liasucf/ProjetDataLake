Mnishovsky was also a poet and cryptographer, and is associated with the mystery of the Voynich manuscript. According to a 1666 letter which was stored with the manuscript, Raphael had told the letter's writer, Marcus Marci, that the manuscript had originally belonged to Rudolf, who had purchased it for 600 gold ducats. ==References== ==External links== *Voynich Manuscript Biographies Category:1580 births Category:1644 deaths Category:Pre-19th-century cryptographers ",
