After almost five years of investigation and after consulting Lord Reith of the BBC and the South African government, it decided to introduce commercial radio to supplement the SABC's public service English and Afrikaans networks and help solve the SABC's financial problems. The SABC would build the equipment and facilities and would place them at the disposal of advertisers and their agencies at cost for productions and allow them to make use of SABC's production staff. On 1 May 1950, the first commercial radio station in South Africa, Springbok Radio, took to the air.Broadcasting in South Africa, Keyan G. Tomaselli Currey, 1989, page 197 Bilingual in English and Afrikaans, it broadcast from the Johannesburg Centre for 113 and a half hours a week.Press, Film, Radio, Volume 4, Unesco, 1950, page 435 The service proved so popular with advertisers at its launch that commercial time had been booked well in advance.Africa Institute Bulletin, Volume 11, 1973, page 155 The service started at 6:43am with the music Vat Jou Goed en Trek, Ferreira. The first voice on air was that of Eric Egan, well remembered for his daily \"Corny Crack\"Financial Mail, Issues 5\u20139, page 150 and catch phrase \"I Love You\".With the Lid Off: South African Insights from Home and Abroad 1959\u20132000, Todd Matshikiza, John Matshikiza, Jacana Media, 2000, page 54 Many drama programmes during the 1950s were imported from Australia but as more funding became available, Springbok Radio produced almost all its programmes within South Africa through a network of independent production houses. By the end of 1950, 30 per cent of Springbok Radio shows were produced by South African talent or material and independent productions were sold to sponsors. At the same time all air time had been sold or used and transmission time was extended. By the end of 1950 the revenue of Springbok Radio was \u00a3205,439, in 1961 it had grown to over two million Rand and by 1970 had reached R6.5 million. By 1985, Springbok Radio was operating at a heavy loss.Debates of Parliament: Hansard, Volume 8, Issues 19\u201321, 1988, page 12123 After losing listeners with the handing over of its shortwave frequencies to Radio 5 and facing competition from television, despite the late arrival of the medium in 1976, it ceased broadcasting on 31 December 1985.Springbok Radio Revisited, SABC ==List of programmes== Springbok Radio's programme schedules reflected the white, primarily English-speaking, suburban lifestyle of the period, when many women were housewives. Weekday schedules broadly comprised a breakfast session (05:00 \u2013 08:30), women's programmes (08:30 \u2013 14:00), Afrikaans soap operas (14:00 \u2013 16:15), teatime chat shows (16:15 \u2013 16:45), children's programmes (16:45\u201318:15), dinnertime programmes (18:15 \u2013 19:00), the main news bulletin (19:00 \u2013 19:15), and family shows (19:15 \u2013 24:00). Saturday programmes were generally light: music, sitcoms and quizzes. Sunday was more sedate: music, chat shows, requests for the armed forces (during the 1970s and 1980s), news commentary and drama. For several years from its start in 1950 there were no advertisements on Sundays. Programmes included: ===Children's=== * The Adventures of Jet Jungle (1973\u20131985) \u2013 \"most amazing man of our time\"; created by Brian O'Shaughnessy and sponsored for many years by the Tiger Oats Company makers of Jungle Oats and Black Cat Peanut Butter * The Air Adventures of Hop Harrigan (1950\u20131957) \u2013 from Australia * The BP Smurf Show (1982\u20131985) * The Casey Kids (1960s) * Chappies Chipmunk Club * Luck of the Legion (1979) * My Pal Shep (1960s) * Ricky Roper, Schoolboy Detective * Superman (1950\u20131957) \u2013 from Australia * Tarzan, King of the Apes (1950\u20131955) \u2013 from Australia * The Twilight Ranger (1950\u20131953) \u2013 originally from Australia ===Comedy/variety=== * Father, Dear Father (1974\u20131985) \u2013 produced by Tom Meehan * Friends and Neighbours \u2013 Pat Simpson and Valerie Miller-Brown (later Jim Williams and Bella Mariani) as the Duffs, David Horner and Gillian Lomberg as the Loaders; and Frank Graham * The Goode Life (1969\u20131971) * Leave It to Van der Merwe * Life with Dexter (1967\u20131969) \u2013 from Australia * Loudspeaker Show * The Men from the Ministry (1969\u20131985) \u2013 \"the bowler, briefcase and brolly brigade\"; produced by Tom Meehan, starring John Simpson, Roger Service, Maureen Adair, Tommy Reed, Frank Graham, Tom Meehan and Pat Simpson; adapted from the BBC radio series * The Navy Lark (1973\u20131985) \u2013 \"the craziest crew afloat\"; adapted from the BBC radio series * Next Stop Makouvlei (1969\u20131972) * The Nugget Bunkhouse Show (early 1950's) from Australia, where it was simply known as The Bunkhouse Show * The Pip Freedman Show (1968\u20131985) * Taxi (1969\u20131972) (1975\u20131978) \u2013 \"the trials and tribulations of a New York taxi driver\"; written and produced by Joe Stewardson; directed by David Gooden at the Sonovision Studios, Johannesburg.
