    "text": "Tar\u0121a Battery () is an artillery battery on the boundary between St. Paul's Bay and Mosta, Malta. It was built in 1887 by the British as part of the Victoria Lines. The battery is now in the hands of the Mosta Local Council, who intend to restore it and open it to the public. ==History== Main entrance door Tar\u0121a Battery was built in 1887 as part of the North West Front (later renamed the Victoria Lines), between the Dwejra Lines and Fort Mosta. The battery was built to protect the defensive line's low escarpment at Tar\u0121a Gap, and it was meant to defend the area from enemy batteries which could be constructed on Bidnija Hill. The battery in April 2016 left The battery has a pentagonal shape, and it contains a caponier, casemated gun emplacements, an escarpment and a ditch. An infantry redoubt was built at the rear of the battery. Some alterations were made to the structure between the 1890s and the first half of the 20th century. In 1888, when it was still under construction, the battery's design was criticized by a number of British engineers. The decision was taken to complete the battery, but it never received its intended armament of four 64-pounder RML guns. The entire Victoria Lines were of dubious defensive value, and the entire system of fortifications (with the exception of Fort Madalena and Fort Bin\u0121emma) was decommissioned in 1907. The former battery was then used as a magazine or storage area, and it was used for training and storage by the Civil Defence just after World War II. ==Present day== The Land Ministry passed the battery to the Mosta Local Council, who cleaned it up along with the Mosta Scout Group in May 2012. The site is now the Mosta Scout Group's campsite and activity centre.https://www.facebook.com/MostaScoutCampsite ===The battery=== Panorama of the battery ==References== ==External links== *YouTube video showing a 3D model of Tar\u0121a Battery Category:Batteries in Malta Category:St. Paul's Bay Category:Mosta Category:British forts Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1887 Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:19th-century fortifications ",
