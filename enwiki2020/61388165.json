    "text": "Captain Man Bahadur Rai AC, MC, IDSM (10 January 1914 \u2013 14 February 2011) was a highly decorated Indian Army Gorkha officer and a recipient of the Ashoka Chakra, the highest peacetime Indian gallantry decoration. Only the fourth Ashoka Chakra recipient to be decorated while living, he was the third Indian Army serviceman and the first Indian Army officer to have been honoured while alive. ==Early life== A member of a Rai family in the Darjeeling district, Rai enlisted in the British Indian Army on 17 July 1930, joining the 1st Battalion of 10th Gurkha Rifles. ==Second World War== During the Second World War, Rai was promoted to jemadar (now naib subedar) on 1 December 1941. As an acting subedar (paid), he fought in the Burma Campaign, during which he won the Indian Distinguished Service Medal (IDSM). The citation (which was not made public), reads as follows: > 10 December 1943 Subedar Manbahadur Rai, 1/10 Gurkha Rifles, 63rd Indian > Infantry Brigade, 17th Indian Division On the 14th November 1943 this G.O. > [Gurkha Officer] was 2nd in command of a company which was ordered to > counter-attack at night against strong Japanese forces, estimated to be the > major part of a battalion and supported by mortars and infantry guns. During > the course of the fighting, which lasted the whole of the next day, and > during which quite early in the proceedings his company commander was > wounded five times, this Officer displayed the greatest coolness, courage > and military skill. Initially in charge of the mortars and rear [illegible] > company H.Q., he kept his Brigade H.Q. fully and continuously in the > picture, gauging accurately when extra ammunition was required and > organising the evacuation of the wounded. When his company commander was > wounded, he ordered him back to Rear H. Q. and took over command. For some > hours he kept large numbers of the enemy at bay by his oppositions, ensuring > he could not be surrounded, counter-attacking twice, methodically collecting > a large quantity of material for identification purposes and finally when > ordered to withdraw, pulling out unhurried and with great military > precision. All his dead, wounded and material were got away including much > enemy material, and the enemy received such a hard blow that he never > followed up and indeed has never recovered the position. Throughout, this > Officer\u2019s leadership and military skill was of the highest order. Subsequently promoted to war-substantive subedar, Rai was awarded the Military Cross (MC) on 8 October 1944. He received the decoration for, among other actions, his command of his company during the Battle of Imphal in the area of Bishnupur, Manipur. Taking command after his company commander had been killed and while he and his unit were pinned down by Japanese machine-gun fire from several bunkers, Rai conducted a reconnaissance mission and located all of the nearby enemy bunkers. After throwing five grenades at the nearest bunkers, he devised a plan of attack and led his company in an attack which eliminated the first line of bunkers. In the full citation, which was not published, Rai was commended for: > ...his dash and courage, combined with high qualities of leadership and > initiative shown by this Gurkha Officer on all occasions when his company > has been in action. ==Indian Army service== After Indian independence, Rai's regiment, the 10th Gurkha Rifles, which primarily recruited soldiers of the Rai ethnicity, was allocated to the United Kingdom and became a British Army regiment. Rai opted to serve in the Indian Army, joining the newly re-raised 11th Gorkha Rifles. On 23 August 1948, he received a short-service commission as a second lieutenant in the 11th Gorkhas (seniority from 23 August 1946). He received a regular commission as a lieutenant on 7 February 1951 (seniority from 27 August 1948), and was promoted to captain on 27 August 1954. On 20 November 1956, he was seconded for service with the 8th Battalion of the Assam Rifles, and was then assigned to the Village Guards (Naga Hills, Tuensang Area) on 1 December 1957. He was appointed Officer Commanding Village Guard (Tuensang Wing) on 1 March 1958. On 3 May 1961, Rai was decorated with the Ashoka Chakra for his heroism while in command of a platoon during the Nagaland Insurgency: > No. 9-Pres/62.\u2014The President is pleased to approve the award of the ASHOKA > CHAKRA, CLASS I, to the undermentioned personnel for most conspicuous > bravery: Captain MAN BAHADUR RAI (IC-5261). M.C., I.D.S.M., 11th Gorkha > Rifles.(Seconded to Assam Rifles). (Effective date of award \u2014 3rd May 1961) > In April\u2013May 1961, Captain Man Bahadur Rai (IC-5261) took part in a series > of actions against a body of hostile Nagas who had entrenched themselves in > a very difficult, densely wooded, hilly region interspersed with numerous > ravines. Towards the end of April 1961, he led a platoon at dead of night > through two hostile positions into the heart of their stronghold, fiercely > attacked them and was successful in dislodging them from that position. On > the 3rd May 1961, he led a platoon against another strongly fortified > hostile position which was situated on the steep slopes of a ravine. This > position dominated the surrounding area and could not be approached except > frontally. Captain Rai, knowing that heavy casualties would result if he > were to attack frontally, took half a platoon, crawled through the thick > undergrowth and scaled up the steep side while exposed to a hail of close > range fire which covered his advance. On locating the hostile position, he > pressed forward in its direction, threw two hand grenades killing a few > hostiles and charged the position firing as he went and killing two more > hostiles. This fearless and unexpected assault spurred his men to action and > so demoralised the hostiles that they fled into the thick jungle. The > hostiles lost ten men in the encounter and left behind two rifles, one 12 > bore gun and one tommy gun. The attack dealt a crushing blow to the hostiles > and led to the eventual destruction of their position. This action was one > of several in which Captain Rai took part, first as an officer of the 8th > Battalion of the Assam Rifles and more recently as an officer of the Village > Guards Organisation of Nagaland. Throughout this period, he repeatedly > showed conspicuous bravery, unselfishness and indomitable courage in very > difficult and dangerous situations. His leader-ship and unconquerable will > have been a source of inspiration to all his comrades and are in the highest > traditions of the Army. ==Later life and death== After retiring from the Indian Army, Rai settled at Jorhat in Assam. He died there on 14 February 2011, aged 97, and was accorded full military honours by the Assam Rifles at his funeral. The Assam Rifles named an auditorium at their Shillong HQ in honour of Rai. ==Awards== {| | | |} {| |- | | |100px |105px |- |105px |105px | | |- | | | | |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | |Ashoka Chakra |General Service Medal 1947 | |- |Samanya Seva Medal |Samar Seva Star |Raksha Medal |Indian Independence Medal |- |20 Years Long Service Medal |9 Years Long Service Medal |Military Cross |Indian Distinguished Service Medal |- |1939-45 Star |Burma Star |War Medal 1939-1945 |India Service Medal |- |} ==References== Category:1914 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Darjeeling district Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Recipients of the Indian Distinguished Service Medal Category:Indian Army personnel of World War II Category:Military personnel from West Bengal Category:Indian Army personnel Category:Recipients of the Ashoka Chakra (military decoration) Category:Ashoka Chakra ",
