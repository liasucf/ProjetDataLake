    "text": "Dayr al-Qassi or Deir el-Qasi (), was a Palestinian Arab village located 26 km northeast of the city of Acre, which was depopulated during 1948 Arab-Israeli war. ==Geography== The village was located 26 km northeast of the city of Acre, on a rocky hill about 5 km south of the Lebanese border. It was linked by a paved road to Fassuta in the north and Tarshiha in the southwest. The road divided the town into an eastern and one western quarter, or haras, the eastern quarter being higher up.Khalidi, 1992, p. 12 ==History== The first part of the village name, Dayr (\"monastery\") suggest that the village might have had a monastery and a Christian population. However, in modern times the population was Muslim. According to the residents of the village, ancient artifacts from the Canaanite, Israelite and Roman period were unearthed in the Ottoman and British Mandate period. Ceramics from the late Roman and the Byzantine eras have been found here.Dauphin, 1998, p. 648 In the Crusader era it was known as Cassie, and in 1183 it was noted that Godfrey de Tor sold the land of the village to Joscelin III.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 15-16, No. 16; cited in R\u00f6hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 125, No. 624; cited in Frankel, 1988, pp. 257, 264 In 1220 Jocelyn III's daughter Beatrix de Courtenay and her husband Otto von Botenlauben, Count of Henneberg, sold their land, including Cassie and the nearby Roeis (Khirbet Tell \u2018er-Ruwesah/Tel Rosh), to the Teutonic Knights.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 43- 44, No. 53; cited in R\u00f6hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 248, No. 934; cited in Frankel, 1988, pp. 257, 264. Remains from the Mamluk era have been found in the area.Lerer, 2011, Elqosh ===Ottoman era=== Dayr al-Qassi was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and it belonged to the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jira, part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed). In the 1596 tax records Dayr al-Qassi had a population of 24 Muslim household; an estimated 132 persons. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rated of 25% on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, as well as on goats and beehives; a total of 345 ak\u00e7e.H\u00fctteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 177. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 12Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H\u00fctteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In the early 18th century, Dayr al-Qassi was a fortified village controlled by a local sheikh (chief) named Abd al-Khaliq Salih. In 1740, Sheikh Zahir al-Umar, an Arab mutasallim (tax collector) from the al-Zayadina clan whose strength was growing throughout the Galilee, struggled to gain control of Dayr al- Qassi. Later that year, he made the village part of his domain by marrying Sheikh Salih's daughter, thereby sealing an alliance with the latter's clan.Joudah, 1987, p. 24. In late 1767, Zahir's son Ali of Safad requested control of Dayr al-Qassi from his father after his request for Dayr Hanna was rejected. Zahir refused and the two entered into an armed conflict, which Zahir won. Nonetheless, Zahir pardoned Ali and ultimately ceded the village to him.Joudah, 1987, p. 53. In 1838, Deir el-Kasy was noted as a Muslim village in the El Jebel district, located west of Safad.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, 2nd appendix, p. 133 Victor Gu\u00e9rin visited Dayr al-Qassi in 1875, and he estimated that the village had 350 Muslim inhabitants. In 1881, Dayr al-Qassi was described in the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) as being situated on a ridge, encircled by fig trees, olive trees and arable land. It then had a population of about 200.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.197. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 12 A population list from about 1887 showed Deir el Kasy to have about 945 inhabitants, all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 190 ===British Mandate period=== Two women from Dayr al-Qassi, 1937 At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate, Dair Wal Qasi had a population of 663, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Safad, p. 41 increasing in the 1931 census, when Deir el Qasi had a population of 865, still all Muslims, living in a total of 169 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 106. Later, Dayr al-Qassi was mostly Muslim but had a large Palestinian Christian minority. According to the 1945 census it had 1,250 inhabitants; 370 Christians and 880 Muslims.Village Statistics April 1945, The Palestine Government , p. 2 Together with the two villages of Fassuta (existent) and al- Mansura, the population was 2,300 and their total land area was 34,011 dunums.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 40 1,607 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 6,475 used for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 80 while 247 dunams were built-up (urban) land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 130 ===Israel=== During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Dayr al-Qassi was defended by the Arab Liberation Army but the village was captured by the Israeli Army during its offensive Operation Hiram on October 30, 1948. The village's residents were expelled on 27 May 1949 and most migrated north into Lebanon. By June, 1949, it was noted that the whole northern area had been \"Judaised\", including Tarshiha, Suhmata, Dayr al-Qassi, Tarbikha, Meiron, Al- Sammu'i, Safsaf and Al-Ras al-Ahmar.Morris, 2004, pp. 381-382, note #226 Elkosh, established in 1949, occupies part of the village site. Netu'a, founded in 1966, Mattat, founded in 1979 and Abirim, founded in 1980, are also on village land. Netu'a is near the neighboring village of al-Mansura. The Palestinian historian, Walid Khalidi, described the remaining structures on the village land in 1992: \"A few stone houses still are used as residences or warehouses by the inhabitants of Elqosh. The debris of destroyed houses is strewn over the site. The school building stands deserted. Fig and olive trees and cactuses grow on the site.\" In 2004, some of the remains of the village were removed by mechanical equipment during excavations by the Israel Antiquities Authority.Braun, 2004, Elqosh Archive Report- Final Report In 2000, a book about the village history was published by Ibrahim Khalil Uthman.Davis, 2011, p. 285 ==Notable people== *Nabil Marouf, Palestinian Ambassador to Canada, born in Dayr al-Qassi in 1946. ==See also== *List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Palestine Remembered - Dayr al-Qasi * Dayr al-Qasi, Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 4: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Dayr Al-Qasi from the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center * Der al-Qasi, from Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh Category:District of Acre Category:Arab villages depopulated after the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War Category:Former populated places in Israel Category:1948 disestablishments in Israel ",
