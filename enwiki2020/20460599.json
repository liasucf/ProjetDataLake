    "text": "The Timarion () is a Byzantine pseudo-Lucianic satirical dialogue probably composed in the twelfth century (there are references to the eleventh-century Michael Psellus), though possibly later. The eponymous hero, on his way to a Christian fair at Thessalonica, is unexpectedly taken to Hades, which is ruled by pagan figures and pagan justice (including the emperor Theophilos as a judge), and where \"Galil\u00e6ans\" (that is, Christians) make up only one sect (\u03b1\u1f35\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) of many. In one scene, a eunuch whose face \"shines like the sun\" whispers in Timarion's ear. His companion Theodore says it's his guardian angel. ==Edition and translation== * R.
