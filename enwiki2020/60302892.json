An undiagnosed injury to her femur that she had sustained in her youth severely restricted her mobility later in life but she continued to catalogue materials supplied by fellow botanists, students and friends. In 1998 she received the Senior (Silver) Medal from the South African Association of Botanists. Her major publications involved Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Acacia and Cassia but her interest and expertise included many vascular plant families and other fields such as Paleobotany. She was still engaged in a collaboration with Jane Browning and C.J. Ward to prepare a joint article for publication up to a few days before her death in January 2012. == Selected publications == * * == References == Category:1918 births Category:2012 deaths Category:South African women scientists Category:Women botanists Category:University of Natal faculty Category:South African botanists Category:20th-century South African scientists Category:20th-century women scientists Category:20th-century botanists Category:South African scientists ",
