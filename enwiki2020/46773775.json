It is located at the crossroad of Resslova Street and Dittrichova Street.St. Wenceslas' Church at Zderaz as seen from Resslova Street == History == === Origins === The Zderaz settlement has ancient origin and is named after the owner, Zderaz. In 1115, the village was first mentioned with a church, which was probably dedicated to Saint Peter and Paul. In the years 1180 to 1190, the settlement belonged to two Czech noblemen, Kojat and V\u0161ebor (Sv\u00e9bor), members of the aristocratic House of Hrabischitz, who gave their land to found a monastery of the Order of the Cross \u2013 the Guardians of the Holy Sepulchre. However, due to this, the villagers lost their parish church, therefore the brothers founded a new Romanesque church dedicated to St. Wenceslas. The new church took over the parish duties of the Church of St. Peter and Paul. St. Wenceslas\u2019 Church at Zderaz was consecrated 26 November 1181 by the Bishop Valentine of Prague.211x211px Archeological research made by archeologist Karel Guth (1883-1943) in the years 1927 \u2013 1929, showed that it was a simple one-nave construction with a semi rounded apse on the east and a large square tower on the west. A part of this tower was later included into the Gothic reconstruction and it became a part of the western frontage of the church from 14th century. The church was surrounded by a cemetery. Three gravestones were preserved and are now placed in the City of Prague Museum. === 14th century === In 1324, the monastery bought a house with a spa near the church and established a hospital in this new building. After the founding of New Town in 1348 by king Charles IV, St. Wenceslas\u2019 Church became one of the New Town\u00b4s parish churches. The visitation protocols of the Archdeacon of Prague Paul of Janovice from 1379-1382 state that the church had four altars. There was already a vaulted choir with a two bays of cross vault and a pentagonal ending. The sacristy was built on the south side of choir. The nave remained without a vault, it probably had a wooden ceiling, supported by two pillars. As stated before, the tower of the Romanesque church was included as a part of the Gothic nave. === The Hussite Wars === On 5 August 1420, the monastery was burned down by the Hussites and St. Wenceslas\u2019church was given to Hussite priests, together with the parsonage. After the Hussite Wars, the church was restored. Two altars were added next to the pillars, which supported the ceiling, one was dedicated to St. Nicolas and St. Procopius, the other to St. John the Baptist. Around 1500, a Gothic arch was added as a decoration to the main altar. The arch was transferred to the parish Church of St. Adalbert in J\u00edlov\u00e9 near Prague in 1760. === 16th\u201317th centuries === 229x229px Until 1586, the church remained without a change, afterwards the emperor Rudolph II (1552-1612) donated 300 threescopes to the church. The wooden ceiling was replaced with a new Gothic vault with terracotta ribs supported by Tuscan semi columns. Due to this change, the Gothic windows had to be lowered down and their traceries had to be replaced, even the Romanesque tower was demolished. The reconstruction was led by master builder Karel M\u011blnick\u00fd. In 1641, a cloister was built for the newcomer community of Augustinians. Before that, in 1623, the church was given to the Augustinians by emperor Ferdinand II. Three years later, with the support of the emperor and nobility, the Augustinians started to build a monastery on the west side of the church. Around 1645, the church was paved with white marble and green serpentine, brought from the Prague Castle, together with four marble pillars. The construction was finished a year later. During the Swedish occupation of Prague, the church was heavily damaged. In 17th century, a new sacristy was built on the place of the old one. The most famous Czech Baroque painter Karel \u0160kr\u00e9ta (1610-1674) painted 32 paintings depicting the Legend of St. Wenceslas for the cloister of the church. The monastery and the church became a gallery of \u0160kr\u00e9ta\u2019s paintings for the Augustinians. There were often held funerals of important people. === 18th\u201319th centuries === In the year 1785, the monastery was abolished and deconsecrated. This was due to the emperor Joseph II, who abolished many monasteries during his reign. From 1809, the building became a prison. In 1827, the church was consecrated again, however it still remained a prison until 1884, when the jail was moved to Pankr\u00e1c and the complex of buildings was bought by the city. === Reconstruction in the 20th century === The choir. Around 1904, the whole monastery was demolished and the terrain was lowered to the level of the street and rent houses were built instead of the monastery. The church was not restored and was in danger of demolition. However, in 1904, the Association for restoration of St. Wenceslas\u2018 church ordered a plan for restoration, which was made by acknowledged Art Nouveau architects Anton\u00edn Wiehl (1846-1910) and Josef Fanta (1872-1941). The cemetery was abolished but the church was still not restored. In 1909, the city council appointed architects Eduard Sochor (1862-1947) and Ferdinand \u010capka (1905-1987) with the restoration. A terrace was created around the church, the tracery was restored, nevertheless the renovation works stopped one year later. They were not finished till the church was bought by The Czechoslovak Hussite Church. In 1926 the reconstruction was finally completed. The temple was consecrated again in 1929. In 1936, a columbarium was added under the choir loft. == Architecture == === Exterior === St. Wenceslas\u2019 Church is located on a rock terrace above the level of street.
