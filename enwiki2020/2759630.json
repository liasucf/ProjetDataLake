Dooley edited the various Green Lantern books and Aquaman. He also dabbled with writing comics, including Mister Miracle (third series-1996), a stint on Green Arrow, Justice League Quarterly, Justice League America #50, as well as an issue of Superboy (The Adventures of Superboy #21) and a Scooby-Doo mini- comic. Perhaps Dooley's most notable accomplishment during his time at DC was overseeing the Emerald Twilight storyline, which marked a major shift in Green Lantern, specifically the Hal Jordan Green Lantern, a long-standing marquee character for DC comics, who was replaced by a younger character, Kyle Rayner. Beyond Green Lantern, Dooley also oversaw the Aquaman series, wherein Aquaman had his left hand chewed off by piranha to be replaced by a hook. Among the other titles Dooley edited were Sovereign Seven and Vext. Before Dooley came to DC, from 1986 to 1988 he edited Fantagraphics' Amazing Heroes.Eury, Michael, \"Inside DC\" #26, The New Titans #86 (May 1992). Dooley left the employ of DC Comics in 1999.
