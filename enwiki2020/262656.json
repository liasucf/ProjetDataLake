    "text": "Naberius depicted in the Dictionnaire Infernal by Jacques Collin de Plancy (drawing by Louis Le Breton, engraving by Jarrault) The demon Naberius was first mentioned by Johann Weyer in 1583. He is supposedly the most valiant Marquess of Hell, and has nineteen legions of demons under his command. He makes men cunning in all arts (and sciences, according to most authors), but especially in rhetoric, speaking with a hoarse voice. He also restores lost dignities and honors, although to Johann Weyer, he procures the loss of them. ==Description== Naberius appears as a three-headed dog or a raven. He has a raucous voice but presents himself as eloquent and amiable. He teaches the art of gracious living. He has also been depicted as a crow or a black crane. Concerning his name, it is unclear if there is an association with the Greek Cerberus. It is said that in 1583, Johann Weyer considers both of them to be the same demon. He claimed: > Naberius [Naberus], alias Cerberus, is a valiant marquesse, shewing himselfe > in the forme of a crowe, when he speaketh with a hoarse voice: he maketh a > man amiable and cunning in all arts, and speciallie in rhetorike, he > procureth the losse of prelacies and dignities: nineteene legions heare (and > obeie) him. Other spellings: Cerberus, Cerbere, Naberus. ==See also== * The Lesser Key of Solomon ==Sources== *S. L. MacGregor Mathers, A.
