A unit is located at Cidade Universit\u00e1ria, S\u00e3o Paulo. ==History== The aerial view Instituto de Matem\u00e1tica e Estat\u00edstica, USPPrior to the founding of the IME in 1970, Mathematics studies took place mainly in the Polytechnic School, whose activities began in 1893, even before the foundation of USP. The University of S\u00e3o Paulo was created in 1934, from the junction of existing faculties and the creation of other units, such as the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters (FFCL). The FFCL was responsible for teaching courses in all areas of knowledge, predominantly cultural or scientific, including the Mathematical Sciences course. Formerly located at Alameda Glete, in 1949 the FFCL started to operate on the Maria Antonia Street campus. In the late 60's and early 70's, she was transferred to the Butant\u00e3 campus and dismembered in several institutes, such as Psychology, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics and Statistics. The creation of the IME took place on January 15, 1970, by the university reform, which brought together in a single institute the mathematics, statistics and computer science professors of the various establishments of USP, in particular those of the former Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters from the former Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences, Faculty of Hygiene and Public Health and the former Institute of Mathematical Research. In honor of the Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor and astronomer, Archimedes (Greek: \u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2; Siracusa, 287 BC \u2013 212 BC), his image as a coat of arms of the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 USP). ==Rankings== It is considered, together with other units of USP that teach these courses, one of the two best institutes of mathematics, statistics and computation of Latin America according to the QS World University Rankings 2017; the best institute of mathematics of Brazil and the best institute of computation of Latin America according to the Ranking of Shanghai. As USP does not participate in the National Student Performance Examination (ENADE), the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's (RUF) 2017 University Ranking considers that the university is zero in this respect, which places the IME second in the ranking of courses in mathematics and computing. However, by disregarding this examination, USP would lead the ranking of these courses with a greater margin than the current leader. ==Departaments and research areas== The smallest fraction of the structure of the University is the Department. Your responsibility is to plan, execute and coordinate research and teaching in your area of expertise. He is responsible for the didactic orientation of the subjects. ===Departaments=== *Department of Mathematics *Department of Computer Science *Department of Statistical Methods *Department of Applied Mathematics ==Notable people== *C\u00e9sar Lattes experimental physicist, one of the discoverers of the Pion. *Chaim Samuel H\u00f6nig was the main propositor of the Brazilian Mathematical Colloquium in 1957, one of the founders of the Brazilian Mathematical Society (SBM). *Elza Furtado Gomide was founder of the Society of Mathematics of S\u00e3o Paulo and was elected head of the department of mathematics of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1968. *Alexander Grothendieck was awarded the Fields Medal 1966. *Fernando Q.

It presents original and revision articles in the areas of Pure and Applied Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science. Preceded by the journal Reviews of the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (1993-2005), the magazine assumed the current denomination in 2007 and, from 2015 onwards, it was published by Springer. ==References== ==External links== * The Mathematical Institute website Category:Mathematical institutes Category:Mathematics departments in Brazil Category:University of S\u00e3o Paulo ",
