    "text": "Tawag ng Tanghalan (, abbreviated as TNT) is an amateur singing competition currently aired as a segment of the noontime program It's Showtime on ABS-CBN. This segment currently airs in Kapamilya Channel and a simulcast in Jeepney TV and A2Z every Mondays to Saturdays. Dubbed as \"your all time favorite search for outstanding amateur talents,\" the competition is open to Filipino contenders from Metro Manila, Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao and overseas. The segment first aired on January 2, 2016, and has aired four regular seasons, one kids edition, one celebrity edition and one all-star edition. There have been seven winners to date: Noven Belleza, Jhon Clyd Talili, Janine Berdin, Elaine Duran, Ethel Booba and Mark Michael Garcia. == History == === First and second incarnations (1954-1988) === Tawag ng Tanghalan (originally known as Purico Amateur Hour) debuted as a radio talent search program on DZBB-AM in 1954. It was later aired on television DZAQ-TV (now DWWX-TV) until 1972 following the declaration of Martial Law by former President Ferdinand Marcos. It was revived from 1987 to 1988 following the relaunch of ABS-CBN. Noted OPM artists like Armand Panlilio, Nora Aunor, Novo Bono Jr., Pepe Pimentel, Edgar Mortiz and Diomedes Maturan were among the winners of the original program. === Third incarnation (2016-present) === Tawag ng Tanghalan returned as a daily segment on ABS-CBN's noontime program It's Showtime. == Format == The regular season is divided into four quarters, with semifinals taking place at the end of each quarter. Two semifinalists with the highest scores from each quarter, together with winners from the wildcard rounds, move on to compete in the grand finals. === Daily rounds === ==== Elimination round ==== Daily contenders from Metro Manila, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao perform in front of a live audience and are scored by a panel of judges (or hurados) composed of a Head Judge (called as Punong Hurado) and four regular judges. For the first two regular seasons, and kids edition, the judging criteria were as follows: * Tone quality (40%) * Voice projection (30%) * Stage impact (20%) * Intonation (10%) In the following seasons, the judging criteria were modified: * Voice quality (50%) * Overall performance (50%) The first criterion includes intonation, enunciation, voice projection and technique. The second criterion comprises timing, mastery of lyrics, stage presence and audience impact. If the contender goes out-of-tune, the Punong Hurado has the option to signal the gong master to hit the gong three times, thereby stopping the performance and eliminating the contender, \u00e0 la-Major Bowes Amateur Hour. This mechanic was omitted in the kids edition presumably to prevent judges from upsetting young contenders, instead relying solely on the judges' verdict and overall score to determine the winner. In the fourth season, the four regular judges have also been given the power to gong a contender if they all press their buzzers. The winning daily contender receives , while the other contenders receive a consolation prize of . In Celebrity Champions, the winner in the elimination round automatically advances to the semifinals. ==== Face-off round ==== The daily contender with the highest score moves on to the face-off round to challenge the defending champion and attempt to steal the golden microphone. The winner in the face-off round gets to claim the golden microphone and defend their title against the next winning daily contender. Defending champions who achieve a five-time winning streak advances as a semifinalist, but may opt to continue their winning streak up to ten. Those who continue and achieve ten straight wins become a Tawag ng Tanghalan record holder and get to select a bonus prize. In Kids, this was reduced to five straight wins. In the fourth season, a defending champion may advance to the semifinals with four straight wins. The defending champion receives for each win. === Semifinals === ==== Quarter semifinals ==== The semifinalists perform a song based on a theme for each day. The contenders are scored by hurados (50%) and the audience (called as madlang people) through text votes (50%). The judges may still gong a contender in this round. The two semifinalists with the highest combined score from the judges and the public at the end of the six days move on to the grand finals (known as Ang Huling Tapatan) and receive and a golden medal.

The semifinalists compete for additional two spots in the grand finals. === Wildcard rounds === ==== Instant Resbak==== In the third season, every judge is given the power to save one losing defending champion in the face-off round. The saved contender advances to compete in the Instant Resbak for a chance to re-enter the competition as a grand finalist. The judges may still gong a contender in this round. ==== Ultimate Resbak==== Semifinalists who failed to advance to the grand finals advances to the Ultimate Resbak round for a chance to re-enter the competition as a grand finalist. The judges may still gong a contender in this round. In the first season, the semifinalists are grouped into four and must compete in two rounds. In the first round, a group performs with individual songs. The semifinalists with the highest combined scores from the judges and the public for each group will advance to the second round. In the second round, the four remaining semifinalists perform again with individual songs. The two contenders garnering the highest combined scores from the judges and the public advance to the grand finals. In the second and third seasons, the Ultimate Resbak round follows a last man standing format. Two semifinalists who are in the Seat of Power choose two semifinalists. These chosen semifinalists battle it out for a chance to challenge and dethrone the sitting semifinalists. If the challenger wins, the semifinalist in the Seat of Power is dethroned.

He has received backlash on the internet for repeated incidences of body-shaming several female contestants and failing to focus on the contestants' singing skills. Karla Estrada's qualification as judge has also been questioned by some viewers. Judges' scores and text votes results are also questioned by many viewers either for lack of transparency, a faulty system that fails to confirm their votes thru SMS, allegations of unfair judging and similar claims that the show is rigged. In the 2017 Grand Final, acclaimed actress Nora Aunor, the original Tawag ng Tanghalan Grand Champion in 1968, was scheduled to be the special judge but pulled out at the last minute due to a conflict with Vice Ganda, one of the main hosts of the show. According to reports, Aunor believed Ganda's brand of insult comedy was against her moral beliefs and made her deeply uncomfortable with the idea of being on the show. === Season 2 === On May 22, 2018, in the Ultimate Resbak rounds, after the first round of songs between Ato Arman and Aila Santos, Ato Arman advances to the second round. However, there has been negative criticisms against Hurado Jaya. Vice Ganda defends Jaya, and stated that she is one of the two hurados that voted for Aila Santos. === Season 3 === Since 2018, Tawag ng Tanghalan is often mentioned as one of the factors for longer airtime of It's Showtime, which in turn led to subsequent delays for the afternoon and primetime programs of ABS-CBN.It's Showtime going overtime not a good sign for ABS-CBN accessed 23 September 2018New Trend: GMA responds to It's Showtime going overtime Accessed 23 September 2018It's Showtime has a more appropriate rival, and its not Eat Bulaga Accessed 23 September 2018 One of the semifinalists of Quarter 4, Season 3, Shantal Cuizon, made a headline when she made a controversial post in Twitter saying \"Composer ka lang\" and \"Hustisya\". Later, after her public apology, it was deleted and deactivated her Twitter account for good. On the September 11 episode, after the second round of songs between Mariane Osabel and Mariko Ledesma, Mariko took the seat of power, dethroning Mariane. But when the screen appeared where the split scoring was revealed (showing the public and judges scores), the viewers noticed that Mariane's score given by the judges was 16.50%, while Mariko received 50%. Due to the allegedly \"rigged\" results, netizens used #HustisyaParaKayMariane and it was trending on Twitter, citing the expression, rants and sentiments over the score given by the judges. On September 14, 2019, Hurado Dulce speaks out regarding to the controversial result last September 11, 2019. With the recent controversy of the alleged results, Mariane withdrew the opportunity to compete for the Final Resbak due to her health problem.
