The holding was established in 2007 at the premises of Stroyfarfor plant, then leading Russian producer of facing tiles. == History == In the early 2000s Russian economy witnessed a rapid growth in construction volumes. According to Russian Federal State Statistics Service\u2019s data, an average annual growth of 10-14 per cent was registered between 2003 and 2008 in the domestic construction industry. Meanwhile overall Russian market of facing tiles increased 20-25% per annum over these five years. It was due to the fact that it was widely used to replace obsolete technologies, such as water-based painting applications for the walls, etc. In 2007 Lazar Shaulov merged all of his companies into Unitile holding with regard to better management of assets. It consisted of Stroyfarfor plant (Shakhty), High- melting clay mine in Vladimirskaya (Rostov Oblast), Voronezh ceramic factory (Voronezh), \u201cQuartz\u201d plant (Saint Petersburg), Markin brick factory (village Markin, Rostov Oblast).
