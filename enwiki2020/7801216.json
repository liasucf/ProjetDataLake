    "text": "Islands of Torres Strait The Birds of Torres Strait Islands are of particular interest to Australian birders because the islands are home to, and visited by, birds which some are New Guinea species. A number of islands are found in Australia, but a few are found in Papua New Guinea. ==Access== Access to these islands is not easy. Permission to visit is required from the island councils. The few birders who visit, do so on pre-organised trips by chartered yacht or, occasionally, on day-trips by chartered light aircraft. Saibai and Boigu have airstrips. ==List of birds== The following list is annotated with initials indicating which species have been recorded. Because these islands have not been thoroughly surveyed or regularly monitored by birders, it is very likely that the list underestimates the number of species breeding on or visiting them. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2019 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Torres Strait Islands. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories: *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Torres Strait Islands. *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to the Torres Strait Islands as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions ==Cassowaries and emu== Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Casuariidae The cassowaries are large flightless birds native to Australia and New Guinea. *Southern cassowary, Casuarius casuarius *Emu, Dromaius novaehollandiae ==Magpie goose== Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anseranatidae The family contains a single species, the magpie goose. It was an early and distinctive offshoot of the anseriform family tree, diverging after the screamers and before all other ducks, geese and swans, sometime in the late Cretaceous. *Magpie goose, Anseranas semipalmata ==Ducks, geese, and waterfowl== Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. *Spotted whistling-duck, Dendrocygna guttata *Plumed whistling-duck, Dendrocygna eytoni *Wandering whistling-duck, Dendrocygna arcuata *Black swan, Cygnus atratus *Radjah shelduck, Radjah radjah *Green pygmy-goose, Nettapus pulchellus *Garganey, Spatula querquedula *Pacific black duck, Anas superciliosa *Gray teal, Anas gracilis *Chestnut teal, Anas castanea *Pink-eared duck, Malacorhynchus membranaceus *Hardhead, Aythya australis ==Megapodes== Order: GalliformesFamily: Megapodiidae The Megapodiidae are stocky, medium-large chicken-like birds with small heads and large feet.

Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Bare-eyed rail, Gymnocrex plumbeiventris *Chestnut rail, Gallirallus castaneoventris *Buff- banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis *Dusky moorhen, Gallinula tenebrosa *Eurasian coot, Fulica atra *Australasian swamphen, Porphyrio melanotus *Pale- vented bush-hen, Amaurornis moluccana *White-browed crake, Amaurornis cinerea *Red-necked crake, Rallina tricolor *Spotless crake, Zapornia tabuensis ==Cranes== Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae Cranes are large, long-legged and long-necked birds.

They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia.

Many species are migratory. *Black-necked stork, Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus ==Frigatebirds== Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans.
