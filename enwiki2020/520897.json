He owned grand residences in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island, entertained lavishly and, along with his wife \"Mamie\", became prominent in American high society during the Gilded Age. ==Early life and ancestry== Stuyvesant Fish was born on June 24, 1851, in New York City. He was the third son of Hamilton Fish (1808\u20131893), the 16th Governor of New York, a United States Senator and United States Secretary of State who is recognized as the \"pillar\" of the Grant Administration and considered one of the best U.S. Secretaries of State by scholars.American Heritage Editors (December, 1981), The Ten Best Secretaries Of State\u2026. His mother was Julia Ursin Niemcewicz Kean (1816\u20131887), a descendant New Jersey governor William Livingston.Corning (1918), pp. 20-22. His parents' marriage has been described as a happy one, and his mother was known for her \"sagacity and judgement\". His father was named after his grandfather's friend, Alexander Hamilton.Corning (1918), pp. 12-15. Fish had two older brothers, Nicholas Fish II (1846\u20131902) and Hamilton Fish II (1849\u20131936),Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, Fish, Hamilton, (1849\u20131936) and five sisters, Sarah Morris Fish (1838\u20131925),Sarah married Sidney Webster (1828\u20131910) Julia Kean Fish (1841\u20131908),Julia married Samuel Nicholl Benjamin (1839\u20131886) Susan LeRoy Fish (1844\u20131909),Susan married William Evans Rogers (1846\u20131913) and Edith Livingston Fish (1856\u20131887). His paternal grandparents were Nicholas Fish (1758\u20131833) and Elizabeth Stuyvesant (a great-great-granddaughter of Peter Stuyvesant). Nicholas Fish was a leading Federalist politician and notable figure of the American Revolutionary War who was active in the Yorktown Campaign that resulted in the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. Peter Stuyvesant was a prominent founder of New York, then a Dutch Colony, and his family owned much property in Manhattan.Corning (1918), p. 16. Fish graduated from Columbia College in Manhattan. ==Career== Fish was an executive of the Illinois Central Railroad. He served as its president from 1887 to 1906, overseeing its period of greatest expansion. He also served on the board of directors of the National Park Bank. In 1906, Fish was removed from his position at the Illinois Central by E. H. Harriman, possibly because of Fish's cooperation and participation with the state government in investigating the Mutual Life Insurance Company. However, it is also possible that the reason was because his wife, Mamie, had snubbed Harriman's wife, Mary, from a society tea party. Mamie found Mary too \"dull\" and so snubbed her from a tea party at their home in Newport, Rhode Island, where they spent the summer season.The Barons of Newport: A Guide to the Gilded Age - A Revealing Look at the World's Richest Families, by Terrence Gavan. Newport, RI: Pineapple Publications, 1998. His wife, Marion, known as \"Mamie\", was a leader in New York and Newport society. When in Newport, they lived in a grand Colonial Revival house named \"Crossways\", where her annual Harvest Festival Ball in August signaled the end of the Newport social season.Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish, nee Marion Anthon, a.k.a.
