    "text": "Karim Asir is a comedic Charlie Chaplin impersonator in Kabul, Afghanistan born to Afghan parents in 1994 living in Iran who fled Afghanistan when the Taliban took over. At the age of 12 his family moved back to Afghanistan. At that point in his life he saw what decades of war had done to his country. Asir states \"The buildings were all destroyed and everywhere was destroyed by the Taliban.\" Asir studied theater at Kabul University. After graduation from university Asir wanted to apply his education to address social problems in Afghanistan and he decided to do this by means of entertainment. Asir was well-familiar with the work of Charlie Chaplin through Iranian TV and Asir was fascinated with both Chaplin and acting in general. Lisa Stein Haven, an English professor at Ohio University in Zanesville and a silent comedy scholar, explains her fascination with Karim Asir. Stein Haven emphasizes that there are \"no words involved\" and therefore \"no language\" and that Asir \"didn\u2019t want to go to dialogue film, because he didn\u2019t want to put an English language on it\" and that he could thereby \"speak to people throughout the world through pantomime\". Stein Haven points out that Charlie Chaplin \"had fans in Russia, he had fans all over the world. I think he went to Bali in 1932 and he found that his films had been seen there. And Bali was relatively untouched at that time.\" Some critics point out that comedy is inappropriate for the multitude of problems Afghanistan faces. They point to lack of water and lack of housing. Asir concedes the existence of these problems but responds \"we also need to be happy\". Asir has been threatened by militants and Asir says \"I am afraid of being targeted by suicide bombings or explosions but these issues cannot stop me carrying out my work and performances. I'll continue my performances despite these issues and threats which exist in the country\". ==See also== * War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present) ==References== Category:Living people Category:1994 births Category:Afghan comedians Category:People from Kabul ",
