    "text": "JTBC News Morning& (Korean: JTBC \ub274\uc2a4 \uc544\uce68&; RR: JTBC nyuseu achimen) is a South Korean morning news program aired on JTBC. It is presented by Lee Jeong-heon, Hwang Nam-hee and Baek Da-hye. Morning& airs Mondays to Fridays at 07:00-08:30 KST. == Format == The program usually opened with the day's weather forecast hosted by Kim Min-ah before she left the network on March 27, 2020. Currently, it goes straight to the credit roll. After a commercial break, the anchors present the day's headlines, and the news starts after that. Lee Jung-heon greets the viewers, while Hwang Nam-hee says the date and the phrase \"JTBC News Morning& starts now\", then proceeds to do the headlines in an alternating manner, starting with Lee introducing the first news item. Hwang Nam-hee follows through with the next, and so on. The news usually proceeds after that. Reporters from different departments appear in the main news segment, similar to JTBC Newsroom. === Segments === * News Check - it is a fast-paced news bulletin divided into five categories: politics, society, economy, culture (which includes entertainment news if there is breaking news) and today (which can include any breaking news). * Morning& Now - reporters from News Production Team 2 connect with the anchors and report on the latest news, both international and domestic. Lee Jae-seung, Kang Beo-deul and Park Ji-yoon typically appear in this segment held twice, one during the 7:00 am hour, and another during the 8:00 am hour. * Morning& Interview/Morning& Issue - a segment that merges Morning& Conversation and The Interview, Lee Jeong-heon interviews someone related to the issue or an expert to give analysis. * Morning& World - this segment has Lee Jeong-heon reports on international news. * Morning& Sports - this corner reports on the latest domestic and foreign sports news. * Morning& Life - Hwang Nam-hee briefs life * News Watch - it is another bulletin that recaps the day's news before the broadcast ends. * Weather - before JTBC News' reorganization, this was the only fixed weather segment in its newscasts. It was previously hosted by the network's only weathercaster Kim Min-ah before leaving on March 27, 2020. It is currently done with a short brief by Baek Da-hye. ==== Former segments ==== * Morning& Conversation - a segment established on July 8, 2019, Lee Jung-heon discusses a variety of topics with an expert. *Chae In-taek's World Insight - this is a segment held every Mondays where Hwang Nam-hee and JoongAng Ilbo international reporter Chae In-taek analyze international issues. *Shining Economy - economic experts take turns appearing on this Tuesday-only segment to examine business news. *Reliable Law - legal experts appear to discuss legal issues on this Wednesday-only segment. *In the Movies - on Thursdays, movie critic Kang Yoo-jung discusses trends within the film industry and recommend films for viewers to watch. *Weekend& Leave - travel writer Kwon Gi-bong appears every Friday to introduce viewers to travel destinations worth getting away to during the weekend. == Presenters == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:95%;\" ; |- !Role ! style=\"width:10%; text-align:center;\" | Name ! style=\"width:15%; text-align:center;\" | Duration ! style=\"width:55%; text- align:center;\" | Notes |- | rowspan=\"6\" |Main anchor | \uae40\ud544\uaddc |September 16, 2013\u2014March 21, 2014 | style=\"text-align:left;\" |Currently a correspondent based in Washington, D.C., Kim Pil-kyu created and produced Political Desk, which premiered that April.
