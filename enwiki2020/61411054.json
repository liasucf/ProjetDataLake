    "text": "Thomas Adam Regelski is Distinguished Teaching Professor of Music (Emeritus) at the State University of New York at Fredonia N.Y. A former public school music teacher (rural-Bemus Point N.Y.; urban-Middletown N.Y.), he completed doctoral studies in the philosophy and aesthetics of art and music at Ohio University. Then he returned to his Alma Mater (SUNY Fredonia, School of Music) where he taught secondary school teaching methods, choral conducting and methods, and foundation of education studies in philosophy, psychology, and sociology. He has taught at the Sibelius Academy, Helsinki, Finland where he had a Fulbright Award in 2000, and was a Research Fellow at the Philosophy of Education Research Center at Harvard University. ==Mayday Group and Publications== He is the co-founder of the MayDay Group, an international, interdisciplinary society of nearly 500 scholars interested in music, music education, and socio-cultural research concerned with action for change in music education as predicated on Critical Theory. From its inception until 2007, he was the founding editor of its e-journal Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education, now a leading publication in its field. Later, he was also the founding editor of TOPICS for Music Education Praxis, with a focus on translating theory into praxis, and praxis into theory. He is author of Principles and Problems of Music Education (Prentice-Hall, 1975); Arts Education and Brain Research (Alliance for Arts Education/MENC, 1978); Teaching General Music: Action Learning for Middle and Secondary Schools (Schirmer Books, 1981); Teaching General Music in Grades 4-8: A Musicianship Approach (Oxford University Press, 2014); co-editor (with J.T. Gates) of Music Education for Changing Times (Springer, 2009); and A Brief Introduction to Music and Music Education as Social Praxis (Routledge 2016). In preparation is Curriculum Philosophy and Theory for Music Education: A Pragmatic Account, a monograph covering philosophical influences on curriculum theory in music education; and an Introduction to Japanese Arts and Antiques: The Regelski Collection is awaiting completion of its extensive photography. His choral compositions and arrangements have received positive acclaim as well. == Journal Publications and Influence == He has published over 130 peer-reviewed articles (see Google Scholar) on teaching ethics, philosophy, aesthetics, musicology, curriculum, psychology and sociology of music and music education. Since 1995, he has been a leading scholar of a philosophy of praxis, a social philosophy (stemming from Aristotle) seeking to contest aesthetics as a basis for music appreciation and education, and he has been a leader in making praxial theory a topic of growing influence in music and music education scholarship. == Further reading == * Regelski, Thomas A.
