He was named a delegate to the Republican National Committee again in 1908 and 1916. Brady was elected governor in 1908, but lost his bid for re- election in 1910, and returned to the private sector until he was elected to the U.S. Senate in January 1913, elected by the Idaho Legislature to replace Kirtland I. Perky in the Senate, who was appointed after Weldon Heyburns's death in October 1912. In 1914 Brady became the first elected to the Senate from Idaho by direct popular vote, defeating former Democratic Governor James H. Hawley and a handful of minor party candidates.
