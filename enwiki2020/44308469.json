    "text": "Indirect presidential elections were held in Colombia on 15 June 1910. The result was a victory for Carlos Eugenio Restrepo of the Republican Union. ==Background== Rafael Reyes was elected president for a six-year term in 1904, but resigned and went into exile in June 1909 under pressure from opposition parties. Ram\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia was elected interim President to see out Reyes' term, and convened a Constituent Assembly to meet in 1910. The Assembly passed several reforms to the constitution, reducing the presidential term from six to four years, banning immediate re-election, scrapping the post of Vice President and reintroducing direct elections from 2014. The Assembly also elected a President to serve the first term from 1910 until 1914.Elections and Events 1900-1939 The Library, UC San Diego ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !Candidate !Party !Votes !% |- |align=left|Carlos Eugenio Restrepo||align=left|Republican Union||23||53.5 |- |align=left|Jos\u00e9 Vicente Concha||align=left|Conservative Party||18||41.9 |- |align=left|Guillermo Quintero Calder\u00f3n||align=left|Conservative Party||2||4.7 |- |align=left colspan=2|Total||43||100 |- |align=left colspan=4|Source: R\u00edos Penalosa |} ==References== Category:1910 elections in South America Category:Presidential elections in Colombia Presidential election Category:June 1910 events ",
