The hosts included Chuck Gaidica from WDIV, Aggie Usedly from the Michigan Lottery, and Detroit radio personality Jim Harper, who occasionally substituted for Gaidica. Megabucks Giveaway was an updated version of the Michigan Lottery's previous game show, Fame and Fortune, with a few new elements. Contestants were chosen by submitting their non-winning instant-win tickets for a random drawing. ==Gameplay== Megabucks Giveaway was an updated version of the Michigan Lottery's previous game show, Fame & Fortune, with a few new elements. As before, players chose a letter in the word \"FORTUNE,\" and earned or lost money. Players, as before, could not exceed $1,000, or go below zero. One of the newest elements added was a BONUS card hiding behind one of the letters on the FORTUNE wall, if one of the contestants uncovered it, he or she were granted an extra shot at picking one of four keys to unlock the safe that contained $50,000 in the end game (if they become the overall winner). Contestants could win up to two bonus cards meaning they could have 3 chances to crack open the safe. ==End Game== At the end of the game, the contestant who winds up with the most money, wins an automatic $5,000 and an opportunity to unlock the safe that contained a check for $50,000. The contestant who won would automatically have one chance to crack open the safe by picking one of four color-coded keys (1: Red, 2: Green, 3: Blue, 4: Orange) and if he or she chooses the key that unlocks the safe, wins the $50,000, but if they pick the wrong key, they only win the automatic $5,000. But if the contestant picks a wrong key and he or she has one or two bonus cards, they were granted one or two extra chances to cracking open the safe for the $50,000.
