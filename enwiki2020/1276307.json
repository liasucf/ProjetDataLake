    "text": "Voyage of the Damned is a 1976 drama war film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, with an all-star cast featuring Faye Dunaway, Oskar Werner, Lee Grant, Max von Sydow, James Mason, and Malcolm McDowell. The story was inspired by actual events concerning the fate of the ocean liner carrying Jewish refugees from Germany to Cuba in 1939. It was based on a 1974 book written by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts with the same title. The screenplay was written by David Butler and Steve Shagan. The film was produced by ITC Entertainment and released by Avco Embassy Pictures. ==Plot== Based on historic events, this dramatic film concerns the 1939 voyage of , which departed from Hamburg carrying 937 Jews from Germany, ostensibly bound for Havana, Cuba. The passengers, having seen and suffered rising anti-Semitism in Germany, realised this might be their only chance to escape. The film details the emotional journey of the passengers, who gradually become aware that their passage was planned as an exercise in propaganda, and that it had never been intended that they disembark in Cuba. Rather, they were to be set up as pariahs, to set an example before the world. As a Nazi official states in the film, when the whole world has refused to accept the Jews as refugees, no country can blame Germany for their fate. The Cuban government refuses entry to the passengers, and the liner heads to the United States. As it waits off the Florida coast, the passengers learn that the United States also has rejected them, leaving the captain no choice but to return to Europe. The captain tells a confidante that he has received a letter signed by 200 passengers saying they will join hands and jump into the sea rather than return to Germany. He states his intention to run the liner aground on a reef off the southern coast of England, to allow the passengers to be rescued and reach safety there. Shortly before the film's end, it is revealed that the governments of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have each agreed to accept a share of the passengers as refugees. As they cheer and clap at the news, footnotes disclose the fates of some of the main characters, suggesting that more than 600 of the 937 passengers, who did not resettle in the United Kingdom but in the other European nations, ultimately were deported and were murdered in Nazi concentration camps. ==Cast== * Faye Dunaway as Denise Kreisler * Max von Sydow as Captain Schroeder * Oskar Werner as Professor Egon Kreisler * Malcolm McDowell as Max Gunter * Orson Welles as Jos\u00e9 Estedes * James Mason as Dr. Juan Remos * Lee Grant as Lili Rosen * Katharine Ross as Mira Hauser * Ben Gazzara as Morris Troper * Luther Adler as Professor Weiler * Michael Constantine as Luis Clasing * Denholm Elliott as Admiral Canaris * Jos\u00e9 Ferrer as Manuel Benitez * Lynne Frederick as Anna Rosen * Helmut Griem as Otto Schiendick * Julie Harris as Alice Fienchild * Wendy Hiller as Rebecca Weiler * Paul Koslo as Aaron Pozner * Nehemiah Persoff as Mr. Hauser * Georgina Hale as Lotte Schulman * Brian Gilbert as Laurenz Schulman * Fernando Rey as President Bru * G\u00fcnter Meisner as Robert Hoffman (credited as Guenter Meisner) * Leonard Rossiter as Commander Von Bonin * Maria Schell as Mrs. Hauser * Victor Spinetti as Dr. Erich Strauss * Janet Suzman as Leni Strauss * Sam Wanamaker as Carl Rosen * Jonathan Pryce as Joseph Manasse * Ina Skriver as Singer * Laura Gemser as Estedes' friend (uncredited) ==Production== The book was published in 1974.

Los Angeles Times 13 Nov 1976: b6. ==Actual death toll== The true death toll is uncertain. The 1974 book that was the basis of the film estimated a much lower number of deaths. By using statistical analysis of survival rates for Jews in various Nazi-occupied countries, Thomas and Morgan-Witts estimated the fate of the 621 St. Louis passengers who were not given refuge in Cuba or the United Kingdom (one died during the voyage): 44 (20%) of the 224 refugees that settled in France likely were murdered in the Holocaust, 62 (29%) Holocaust murders amongst the 214 that reached Belgium, and 121 (67%) Holocaust murders amongst the 181 that settled in the Netherlands, for a total of 227 (37%) of the refugees that came under occupation were likely murdered by the Nazis.Rosen, pp. 447, 567 citing Morgan-Witts and Thomas (1994) pp. 8, 238 In 1998, Scott Miller and Sarah Ogilvie of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum traced the survivors from the voyage, concluding that a total of 254 refugees were murdered by the Nazis. ==Release== The film opened on 22 December 1976 in four theatres in New York and Los Angeles. ===Box Office=== According to Lew Grade who helped finance the film, the movie \"should have done better\" at the box office.Alexander Walker, National Heroes: British Cinema in the Seventies and Eighties, 1985 p. 197 He wrote in his memoirs \"I thought it was one of the most moving and important films I'd seen in a long time.
