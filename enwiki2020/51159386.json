    "text": "Communal elections () were held in Cambodia on Sunday, 4 June 2017. The National Election Committee (NEC) announced that some 7.8 million of 9.6 million eligible Cambodians were registered to cast their ballots. 94,595 candidates from 12 political parties contested the 11,572 commune council seats in 1,646 communes of Cambodia. Voter turnout was a record 90.37%.https://www.necelect.org.kh/khmer/ There were concerns surrounding some irregularities in the polling. The result was a victory for the Cambodian People's Party, albeit with a smaller majority, and saw large gains by the Cambodia National Rescue Party. Ultimately, the strong showing by the opposition led to its dissolve before it could contest the national elections. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right |- !colspan=2|Party !Votes !% !Chiefs !+/\u2013 !Councillors !+/\u2013 |- | bgcolor=\"\" | |align=left|Cambodian People's Party|| 3,540,056 || 50.76 || 1,156 || \u2013436 || 6,503 || \u20131,789 |- | bgcolor=\"\" | |align=left|Cambodia National Rescue Party|| 3,056,824 || 43.83 || 489 || +449 || 5,007 || +2,052 |- | bgcolor=\"\" | |align=left|FUNCINPEC|| 132,319 || 1.90 || 0 || \u20131 || 28 || \u2013123 |- | bgcolor= #00BFFF | |align=left|League for Democracy Party|| 122,882 || 1.76 || 0 || 0 || 4 || \u20134 |- | bgcolor= #FFD700| |align=left|Khmer National United Party|| 78,724 || 1.13 || 1 || New || 24 || New |- | bgcolor=orange| |align=left|Beehive Social Democratic Party|| 31,334 || 0.45 || 0 || New || 1 || New |- | bgcolor= #28B463 | |align=left|Grassroots Democratic Party|| 4,981 || 0.07 || 0 || New || 5 || New |- | bgcolor=yellow| |align=left|Cambodian Nationality Party|| 2,161 || 0.03 || 0 || 0 || 0 || \u20131 |- | bgcolor=blue| |align=left|Cambodian Youth Party|| 1,505 || 0.02 || 0 || New || 0 || New |- | bgcolor= #006400 | |align=left|Cambodia Indigenous People's Democracy Party|| 1,272 || 0.02 || 0 || New || 0 || New |- | bgcolor= #009933| |align=left|Khmer Power Party|| 1,035 || 0.01 || 0 || New || 0 || New |- | bgcolor=red| |align=left|Republican Democracy Party|| 818 || 0.01 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"|Invalid/blank votes|| 133,484 ||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"|Total||7,107,395||100||1,646|| +13 ||11,572|| +113 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"|Registered voters/turnout||7,865,033||90.37||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"8\"|Source: COMFREL |} ==References== Cambodia Category:2017 in Cambodia Category:Communal elections in Cambodia Category:June 2017 events in Asia ",
