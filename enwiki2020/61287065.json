Many frontages on this street offer architectural interests: some of the buildings are registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. ==Location== Kordeckiego street runs on a south- west to north-east path: from Plac Pozna\u0144ski in the south to Focha Street in the north, crossing Swi\u0119tej Trojcy street on the way. ==History== Kordeckiego street is registered on an 1855 address book of Bromberg and appears partially on an 1876 city map under the calling Cichorien stra\u00dfe.1876 Plan der Stadt Bromberg The extension of the street in first years of the 20th century led to a change in the house numbering of the buildings. In 1974-1975, after the filling of a portion of Old Bydgoszcz Canal, Kordeckiego street gained connection with Kr\u00f3lowej Jadwigi Street at the crossing with Focha street in the north. Since 2016-2017, municipal authorities launched a move towards renovating buildings in its control. Through history, this street bore the following names: * From inception in the 1850s to 1902, Cichorien stra\u00dfe (German for Chicory street); * 1903-1920, (von) Hippel stra\u00dfe, from Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Younger (1775-1843), a friend of E. T. A. Hoffmann, who died in Bromberg; * 1920-1939, Kordeckiego street; * 1939-1945, (von) Hippel stra\u00dfe; * 1945-1950, Kordeckiego street; * 1950-1991 Jana Olszewskiego street, from Jan Olszewski, councilor a from Bydgoszcz,member of trade unions and also activist of the Polish Communist Party; * Since 1991, Kordeckiego street. Current name refers to Abbot Augustyn Kordecki (1603-1673), a prior of the Jasna G\u00f3ra Monastery during the period of the Deluge. ==Main areas and edifices== Tenements located north of \u015awi\u0119tej Tr\u00f3jcy street crossing (i.e. No. 4,5,6,8,10,12) have all been erected after the extension of the street at the beginning of the 20th century. ===Tenement at 4 Kordeckiego === 1910 Late Art Nouveau The first landlord of the house was Adolf M\u00fcller, a painter. The facade bears late Art Nouveau characteristics. Its main feature is the avant- corps overhanging the main door: it carries openings with wrought iron railings and a loggia crowned by a tented roof-like top. One can also highlight the preserved wood-carved entry door with a large transom window.

The plot then occupied the entire corner between the villa and \u015awi\u0119tej Tr\u00f3jcy street. Korth had also a branch on Kanal stra\u00dfe, today's western tip of Focha street. Bernhard's son, Bruno, took over the business in the 1920s till the start of WII. The villa features neo- renaissance elements and echoes similar buildings in nearby Swi\u0119tej Trojcy street (No. 8 and 21).
