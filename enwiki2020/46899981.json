    "text": "Chariot is a co-op platform game for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Wii U and Microsoft Windows developed and published by Frima Studio, with the participation of the Canada Media Fund. It was first released on September 30, 2014 and was launched on Xbox One the next day as part of the Xbox Live Games with Gold program. An enhanced port entitled Super Chariot was released for the Nintendo Switch on May 10, 2018, and will include the Royal Gadget Pack DLC. Chariot differs from most traditional Platform game as the objective is to lug around an object, the Chariot, to the end of each level. To do so, the players have to use physics-based mechanics such as pushing and pulling, adding a layer of Puzzle to the game. ==Plot== Chariot chronicles a princess' quest to fulfill her recently deceased father's final wishes and bury him in peace. As might be expected of royalty, his last request is that he be laid to rest with as much wealth as possible. ==Gameplay== The entire game can be played solo or with a partner. The king's body is in a coffin and attached to it are four wheels. The player's character can push the chariot up and down small hills or attach a rope to pull it along. The rope can be extended or shortened to adequately maneuver the chariot throughout the environment. Everything behaves as it should, with real physics playing a big part in how things move. ==Reception== On Metacritic, Chariot scores an average metascore of 76 on PlayStation 4, Wii U and PC and 73 on Xbox One. It achieved an 8.5 from Destructoid, as \"a memorable game that's hard not to like and recommend to others.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Frima Studio games Category:Indie video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Side- scrolling video games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Wii U eShop games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ",
