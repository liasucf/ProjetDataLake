He was a prominent member of the group from Anding who swore to restore the Jin Dynasty in northern China following the Disaster of Yongjia and was one of Emperor Min of Jin's closest advisors in resisting Han Zhao. Despite the group's early success, the regime was short-lived as the lack of support and trust among themselves led to it eventually being overwhelmed by Han's forces in 316. After Emperor Min's surrender, Qu Yun took his own life while imprisoned. == Life == Qu Yun was born in a prestigious gentry family in Jincheng Commandary in modern-day Gansu province, said to be as equally famous to another family called the You.(\u9eb9\u5141\uff0c\u91d1\u57ce\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002\u8207\u6e38\u6c0f\u4e16\u70ba\u8c6a\u65cf\uff0c\u897f\u5dde\u70ba\u4e4b\u8a9e\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u9eb9\u8207\u6e38\uff0c\u725b\u7f8a\u4e0d\u6578\u982d\u3002\u5357\u958b\u6731\u9580\uff0c\u5317\u671b\u9752\u6a13\u3002\u300d) Book of Jin, Volume 89 Nothing is known of Qu Yun's early life but by 311, he was already a subordinate to the Prince of Nanyang, Sima Mo.

Jia Ya was to be killed in a skirmish that year against the Han general, Peng Tianhu (\u5f6d\u5929\u8b77). Other than that, Yan Ding killed the Administrator of Jingzhao, Liang Zong after the they contested control over the region. Qu Yun was Administrator of Shiping (\u59cb\u5e73\u90e1, in present- day Shaanxi) at that point and with Jia Ya's death he succeeded Jia's position of Inspector in Yong province.

Qu Yun and Suo Lin along with Zong's brother, Liang Su (\u6881\u8085) marched on and defeated Yan Ding, causing him to flee to Yong where the Di tribesman Dou Shou (\u7ac7\u9996) killed him and sent his head back to Chang'an.(\u6d1b\u967d\u50be\u8986\uff0c\u95bb\u9f0e\u7b49\u7acb\u79e6\u738b\u70ba\u7687\u592a\u5b50\u4e8e\u9577\u5b89\uff0c\u9f0e\u7e3d\u651d\u767e\u63c6\u3002\u5141\u6642\u70ba\u5b89\u5937\u8b77\u8ecd\u3001\u59cb\u5e73\u592a\u5b88\uff0c\u5fc3\u5bb3\u9f0e\u529f\uff0c\u4e14\u898f\u6b0a\u52e2\uff0c\u56e0\u9f0e\u6bba\u4eac\u5146\u592a\u5b88\u6881\u7d9c\uff0c\u4e43\u8207\u7d9c\u5f1f\u99ae\u7fca\u592a\u5b88\u7def\u7b49\u653b\u9f0e\uff0c\u8d70\u4e4b\u3002\u6703\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u8cc8\u758b\u70ba\u5c60\u5404\u6240\u6bba\uff0c\u5141\u4ee3\u5176\u4efb\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 89 When news of Emperor Huai's execution reached Chang'an in 313, Sima Ye ascended the throne and was named Emperor Min of Jin.

Liu Yao's invasion of Beidi carried on to the following year in 316, where Liu Yao besieged the Administrator of Beidi, Qu Chang (\u9eb4\u660c) and Qu Yun led his men to reinforce Chang. Liu Yao burned parts of the city and sent defectors to Qu Yun, who told him that the commandary's capital had already fallen. Qu Yun believed them, and the rumor spread among his soldier, causing them to scatter in fear.(\u66dc\u5f8c\u5fa9\u570d\u5317\u5730\uff0c\u592a\u5b88\u9eb9\u660c\u9063\u4f7f\u6c42\u6551\uff0c\u5141\u7387\u6b65\u9a0e\u8d74\u4e4b\u3002\u53bb\u57ce\u6578\u5341\u91cc\uff0c\u7fa4\u8cca\u7e5e\u57ce\u653e\u706b\uff0c\u7159\u5875\u853d\u5929\uff0c\u7e31\u53cd\u9593\u8a50\u5141\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u90e1\u57ce\u5df2\u9677\uff0c\u711a\u71d2\u5411\u76e1\uff0c\u7121\u53ca\u77e3\u3002\u300d\u5141\u4fe1\u4e4b\uff0c\u773e\u61fc\u800c\u6f70\u3002\u5f8c\u6578\u65e5\uff0c\u9eb9\u660c\u7a81\u570d\u8d74\u9577\u5b89\uff0c\u5317\u5730\u9042\u9677\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 89 Liu Yao defeated Qu Yun at Panshi Valley (\u78fb\u77f3\u8c37, in present-day Tongchuan, Shaanxi), and Qu retreated to Lingwu, thus incorporating Beidi to Han's territory.(\u5317\u5730\u9951\u751a\uff0c\u4eba\u76f8\u98df\u5556\uff0c\u7f8c\u914b\u5927\u8ecd\u9808\u904b\u7ce7\u4ee5\u7d66\u9eb9\u660c\uff0c\u5289\u96c5\u64ca\u6557\u4e4b\u3002\u9eb9\u5141\u8207\u5289\u66dc\u6230\u4e8e\u78fb\u77f3\u8c37\uff0c\u738b\u5e2b\u6557\u7e3e\uff0c\u5141\u5954\u9748\u6b66\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 102 Qu Yun had a reputation of being kind-hearted and gave many titles to his subordinates and allowing them to exercise their own power freely. However, as Liu Yao invaded, many of them refused to aid Qu Yun, such as Jiao Song (\u7126\u5d69), who, when asked by Qu to aid him in protecting the capital from Han, simply decided to wait until Qu Yun was deeply in troubled to help.(\u5141\u6027\u4ec1\u539a\uff0c\u7121\u5a01\u65b7\uff0c\u5433\u76ae\u3001\u738b\u96b1\u4e4b\u5f92\uff0c\u7121\u8cf4\u51f6\u4eba\uff0c\u7686\u52a0\u91cd\u7235\uff0c\u65b0\u5e73\u592a\u5b88\u7afa\u6062\uff0c\u59cb\u5e73\u592a\u5b88\u694a\u50cf\u3001\u6276\u98a8\u592a\u5b88\u7afa\u723d\u3001\u5b89\u5b9a\u592a\u5b88\u7126\u5d69\uff0c\u7686\u5f81\u93ae\u6756\u7bc0\uff0c\u52a0\u4f8d\u4e2d\u3001\u5e38\u4f8d\uff0c\u6751\u5862\u4e3b\u5e25\u5c0f\u8005\uff0c\u7336\u5047\u9280\u9752\u3001\u5c07\u8ecd\u4e4b\u865f\uff0c\u6b32\u4ee5\u64ab\u7d50\u773e\u5fc3\u3002\u7136\u8af8\u5c07\u9a55\u6063\uff0c\u6069\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eba\u60c5\u9817\u96e2\uff0c\u7531\u662f\u7f8c\u80e1\u56e0\u6b64\u8dcb\u6248\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 89 Liu Yao then pressed on to Chang'an the same year.

Sima Bao sent his general Hu Song (\u80e1\u5d27) to reinforce Chang'an but, despite routing Liu Yao on his way, decided to turn back as he believe that if Emperor Min's regime were to defeat Han, both Qu Yun and Suo Lin were surely to be influential in his rule.(\u7126\u5d69\u3001\u7afa\u6062\u3001\u5b8b\u54f2\u7686\u5f15\u5175\u6551\u9577\u5b89\uff0c\u6563\u9a0e\u5e38\u4f8d\u83ef\u8f2f\u76e3\u4eac\u5146\u3001\u99ae\u7fca\u3001\u5f18\u8fb2\u3001\u4e0a\u6d1b\u56db\u90e1\u5175\uff0c\u5c6f\u9738\u4e0a\uff0c\u7686\u754f\u6f22\u5175\u5f37\uff0c\u4e0d\u6562\u9032\u3002\u76f8\u570b\u4fdd\u9063\u80e1\u5d27\u5c07\u5175\u5165\u63f4\uff0c\u64ca\u6f22\u5927\u53f8\u99ac\u66dc\u65bc\u9748\u81fa\uff0c\u7834\u4e4b\u3002\u5d27\u6050\u570b\u5a01\u5fa9\u632f\u5247\u9eb4\u3001\u7d22\u52e2\u76db\uff0c\u4e43\u5e25\u57ce\u897f\u8af8\u90e1\u5175\u5c6f\u6e2d\u5317\u4e0d\u9032\uff0c\u9042\u9084\u69d0\u91cc\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 89Liu Yao besieged Chang'an and forced Qu Yun and Suo Lin to retreat to the inner city. The situation in Chang'an was severe as food supplies were being cut off from the city due to the siege. The prices of food rose sharply and people resorted to cannibalism while others deserted their post. The Imperial Warehouse had so little food that Qu Yun only had gruel to present to the emperor for him to eat. With no food and no reinforcements arriving, Emperor Min decided to surrender to Liu Yao, lamenting, \"It is Lord Qu and Lord Suo who have so mismanaged our affairs!\"(\u5289\u66dc\u5fa9\u653b\u9577\u5b89\uff0c\u767e\u59d3\u9951\u751a\uff0c\u6b7b\u8005\u592a\u534a\u3002\u4e45\u4e4b\uff0c\u57ce\u4e2d\u7a98\u903c\uff0c\u5e1d\u5c07\u51fa\u964d\uff0c\u6b4e\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u8aa4\u6211\u4e8b\u8005\uff0c\u9eb9\u3001\u7d22\u4e8c\u516c\u4e5f\u3002\u300d) Book of Jin, Volume 89 Emperor Min and his officers were sent to Pingyang to meet with Liu Cong. When Emperor Min bowed in submission before Liu Cong, Qu Yun prostrated himself and wailed mournfully. Liu Cong was angered by this and ordered Qu Yun to be imprisoned. While in prison, Qu Yun committed suicide. Liu Cong was impressed with Qu's loyalty and posthumously appointed as General of Chariots and Cavalry and named Marquis Jiemin (\u7bc0\u610d\u4faf).(\u5e1d\u81f3\u5e73\u967d\uff0c\u70ba\u5289\u8070\u6240\u5e7d\u8fb1\uff0c\u5141\u4f0f\u5730\u865f\u54ed\u4e0d\u80fd\u8d77\u3002\u8070\u5927\u6012\uff0c\u5e7d\u4e4b\u65bc\u7344\uff0c\u5141\u767c\u61a4\u81ea\u6bba\u3002\u8070\u5609\u5176\u5fe0\u70c8\uff0c\u8d08\u8eca\u9a0e\u5c07\u8ecd\uff0c\u8ae1\u7bc0\u6e63\u4faf\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 89 == References == * Fang, Xuanling (ed.)
