    "text": "Asparasphenodon arapapa, also known as the Bahia's broad-snout casque-headed tree frog, is a species of frog endemic to the Atlantic Rainforest of Southern Bahia, Brazil. The frogs of the genus Asparasphenodon are distinguished by a bony plate on top of their heads, referred to as \"casqueheaded\". Casqueheaded frogs are characterized by their phragmotic behavior. A. arapapa is further characterized by the long bill-shaped \"snout\" they possess, similar to that of Triprion petasatus, a head longer than it is wide, and their small size (male snout-vent length 57.4\u201358.1 mm). This species, and all species of Asparasphenodon, use their unique head shape to seal off the leaves of bromeliads, the plant they inhabit solely. This has two known purposes: warding off predators from the frog as well as their young (the male performs this action), and trapping moisture. ==References== arapapa Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 2009 ",
