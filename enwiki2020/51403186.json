He also claimed bronze medals at the next two world championships in Sofia and Ostrava respectively, and was European Champion in 1987 and bronze medalist in 1985, 1988 and 1991. He claimed the silver medal in the 1988 Summer Olympics but was disqualified and banned from the Olympic Games after he tested positive for stanozolol. He was the second Hungarian weightlifter to test positive at the games after Kalman Csengeri, who cheated using extra testosterone. == References == Category:Hungarian male weightlifters Category:Olympic weightlifters of Hungary Category:Weightlifters at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Weightlifters at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Hungarian sportspeople in doping cases Category:Doping cases in weightlifting Category:Competitors stripped of Summer Olympics medals Category:1964 births Category:Living people ",
