    "text": "James Gordon (October 31, 1739 - January 17, 1810) was an Irish-born American merchant, soldier, and politician. He was born in Killead, County Antrim, Ireland, and left in 1758, settling in Schenectady, New York. From that base and from Detroit, Michigan, he traded with various Native American tribes. He served as militia lieutenant colonel in the American Revolution. In the 1780 British raid, known as \"The Burning of the Valleys\", he was captured and taken to Quebec, where he was held until he managed to escape in 1783. During and after the war, first in 1777, held various legislative offices, serving in both houses of the state legislature, and representing the state in the United States House of Representatives from 1791 until 1795. Gordon was married to Mary Ball, daughter of Rev. Eliphalet Ball, the founder of Ballston, New York. Gordon Creek, in the Town of Ballston, is named for him. ==References== ==External links== *Biographic sketch at U.S. Congress website Category:1739 births Category:1810 deaths Category:People from County Antrim Category:Kingdom of Ireland emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies Category:Members of the New York State Assembly Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from New York (state) Category:New York (state) state senators Category:Politicians from Schenectady, New York Category:People from Ballston, New York Category:American people of Scotch- Irish descent Category:People of colonial New York Category:Burials in Saratoga County, New York Category:Military personnel from Schenectady, New York ",
