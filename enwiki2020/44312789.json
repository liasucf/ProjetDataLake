    "text": "An All-through school is a school which provides both primary and secondary education, namely from the 1st to 12th grade in the United States and from Year 1 to 13 in parts of the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, they accept children at age 4, and school them right through to the age of 16 (or 18 with a sixth form). In 2009, there were only 13 all-through state schools in England, but the Coalition Government's Free school (England) programme has seen the number expand rapidly. Examples of this type of school are Simon Balle School, a co-educational secondary school, sixth form, and most recently primary school with academy status located in Hertford, Hertfordshire, England; and Dartmouth Academy, a non-selective, co-educational school within the English Academy programme, in Dartmouth, Devon, in the south-west of England. == Definition == The term \"all-through\" can be legitimately applied to establishments in many different circumstances, but one commonly accepted definition is \"schools which include at least two stages of a young person\u201fs education within the one establishment\". == See also == * Educational stage * K\u201312 school, the U.S. equivalent == References == Category:School terminology Category:School types ",
