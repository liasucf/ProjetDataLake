He had once been a trombonist for a band in his native Terni. He has awarded a prize at the Paris International Exhibition of 1911. The sculptor Aurelio De Felice in 1936, began earnest artistic critique of his work, after being brought to his attention by the painter Ugo Castellani. The simple canvases, often depicting sparsely populated cityscapes, according to De Felice stand as true, pure, spontaneous, full of energy, without calculation of purpose, without speculation, or internal imbroglios.vera, pura, spontanea, sgorgante dall\u2019anima, senza calcoli arrivistici, senza speculazione e senza altri imbrogli interiori.Musei Provincia Terni, entry on Metelli. ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1938 deaths Category:People from Terni Category:20th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters ",
