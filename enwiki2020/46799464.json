In the 1940s, because of the Great Patriotic War, the organised philatelic movement in the USSR ceased. Only in separate cities, there were circles and clubs. In the 1950s, philatelic associations began appearing in many cities around the country. The Moscow Municipal Society of Collectors, nowadays the Union of Moscow Philatelists, was created in 1957. In 1963, it started publishing the annual Sovetskii Kollektsioner (Soviet Collector). In March 1966, the All-Union Society of Philatelists was founded. It evolved from the Moscow Municipal Society of Collectors and a range of philatelic associations in other cities of the country. These associations became regional members of the All-Union Society of Philatelists, subsequently the Union of Philatelists of the USSR. The latter functioned until 1992. == See also == * All-Russian Society of Philatelists * Filateliya * First All-Union Philatelic Exhibition * Kollektsioner * Leniniana (philately) * Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily * Philatelic International * Soviet Philatelic Association * Soviet Philatelist ==References== == Further reading == * Archived from the original and another source on 2015-05-15. == External links == * Category:Philately of the Soviet Union Category:1957 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:1966 disestablishments in the Soviet Union Category:Philatelic organizations Category:Organizations based in Moscow Category:Non-profit organizations based in Russia Category:Culture in Moscow Category:Defunct organizations based in Russia ",
