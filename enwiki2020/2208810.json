    "text": "KJLA, virtual channel 57 (UHF digital channel 30), is an Azteca Am\u00e9rica- affiliated television station serving Los Angeles, California, United States that is licensed to Ventura. The station is owned by Costa de Oro Media, LLC, under the operation of Entravision Communications' chief executive officer Walter Ulloa (whose brother, Ronald Ulloa, owns Rancho Palos Verdes-licensed ethnic independent station KXLA (channel 44) and Twentynine Palms-licensed KVMD (channel 31)). KJLA's studios are located on Corinth Avenue (near Interstate 405) in West Los Angeles, and its transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson. KJLA operates two low-power repeater stations: KLFA-LD (channel 25) in Santa Maria and KFUL-LD (channel 44) in San Luis Obispo (both are part of the Santa Barbara market). In addition to carrying Spanish-language programming on its main channel, the station also carries various networks broadcasting in Vietnamese and Mandarin on separate digital subchannels. ==History== The station first signed on the air on October 1, 1990 as KSTV-TV. It was the second attempt to operate a television station in Ventura; the first, KKOG-TV (channel 16), operated from December 14, 1968 to September 13, 1969, with a schedule of entirely live, local programming. KSTV-TV was originally owned by Costa de Oro Television, Inc., and originally aired Spanish-language programming as an affiliate of Galavisi\u00f3n. The station signed on a low-power translator in Santa Maria in 1992. In 1994, Walter Ulloa purchased Costa de Oro Television and KSTV-TV, intending to increase its transmitting power and extend its signal to better reach to the Los Angeles area. However, although Ventura is considered part of the Los Angeles market, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules at the time placed KSTV-TV within the Santa Barbara\u2013Santa Maria\u2013San Luis Obispo market, similar to the situation of KADY- TV channel 63 (now KBEH-TV) in Oxnard, California which became Santa Barbara's UPN affiliate when the network launched in January 1995. Unable to get cable coverage in the Los Angeles area, on November 1, 1995, KSTV switched to an English-language format and became the WB affiliate for the Santa Barbara market.

In July 1997, KSTV increased its effective radiated power to 5,000 kilowatts. The improved signal helped the station to obtain must-carry status on most cable providers in western Los Angeles County in February 1998. However, because Los Angeles already had a WB-affiliated station, KTLA (channel 5), KSTV-TV was forced to disaffiliate from the network. In the spring of 1998, the station relocated its studios and offices from Ventura to West Los Angeles. The station changed its call letters to KJLA on July 20, 1998, to further reflect its intentions to serve the Los Angeles market. On that date, KJLA became an independent station and adopted a split-scheduled format. The station began carrying financial news programming under the brand Business News 22 acquired from KWHY-TV, later BizNews 1 on weekday mornings and afternoons. Business news returned to KWHY-TV, this time only on its digital signal, in 2000, and was later dropped by KJLA. In November 2001, the Simi Valley translator was moved to Mount Wilson and started broadcasting to Los Angeles as KSMV-LP on channel 33. Ironically, the original low power translator in Simi Valley operated on channel 44, which caused interference with full power \"cousin\" station KRPA (now KXLA) which prompted the change to channel 33. Soon after, Trinity Broadcasting Network sought to move KTBN-TV's digital operation from channel 23 to channel 33, to avoid co-channel interference from the digital signals of KVMD (another \"cousin\" of KJLA) in the Inland Empire and San Diego CW affiliate XETV, now a repeater of XHGC-TDT. KTBN's move to channel 33 was authorized on February 5, 2009, ultimately displacing KSMV-LP to KTBN's former digital channel, 23. KSMV-LP soon flash- cut to digital and started rebroadcasting KVMD to the Los Angeles area. The following year in 2001, the station began branding its Spanish language programming block under the name LATV. In April 2007, LATV transitioned from a programming block on KJLA into a national network; it became distributed to several television stations (mainly carried on digital subchannels and low- power stations, with the subchannels of four stations owned by Post-Newsweek Stations and those owned by Entravision Communications among the network's charter affiliates).http://www.latv.com/sales/articles/PNewswekkStations.html In December 2017, it was announced that the station will become the Los Angeles market's Azteca Am\u00e9rica affiliate on January 3, 2018, replacing KAZA- TV, thus KVMD became the new affiliate of LATV in the Los Angeles market on January 1, 2018. Although the official switch to Azteca was not until January 3, the station started airing the majority of the network's programming on January 1 with an exception of shows that aired at the same time as KJLA's religious programming, which continued to air on the network until March.https://www.mediamoves.com/2018/01/azteca-america-latv-switch-channels- la.html Various Azteca programs were delayed or not shown at all in order to make place for KJLA's religious program Cambia Tu Vida, which aired various times a day. The program was removed from KJLA's schedule on March 19, 2018, and the station now airs Azteca's entire schedule \"live\" and in pattern. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The higher operating costs were in part due to KJLA having two different transmitter sites. The station's channel 57 analog transmitter was located on South Mountain near Santa Paula in Ventura County; the facilities for its channel 49 digital signal are located on Mount Wilson in Los Angeles County.\"Request to Discontinue Analog Operations of Station KJLA(TV)\", Federal Communications Commission, Mar 10, 2005. KJLA shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 57, on August 27, 2008.List of Digital Full-Power Stations The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49, using PSIP to display KJLA's virtual channel as 57 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition. KJLA is the second television station in the Los Angeles market to discontinue its analog signal, after KVMD, which shut down its analog signal in 2003. ====Channel sharing trial==== In February 2014, KJLA and PBS member station KLCS (channel 58) were granted special temporary authority by the FCC to conduct trials in partnership with CTIA and the Association of Public Television Stations, in which the two stations would conduct a test of the H.264 video codec for digital television transmission, and more importantly, the ability and viability of broadcasting two sets of television services within the same 6 MHz channel band. These tests came as the FCC prepared to perform a spectrum auction in 2015 (which was delayed to sometime in 2016 that November), in which television station operators would be able to voluntarily sell their broadcast spectrum to the government, and then receive profits from its sale to wireless providers. An FCC spokesperson stated that channel sharing would allow broadcasters to \"[take] advantage of the incentive auction\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime financial opportunity\", while still maintaining its ability to run over-the-air television programming. == References == ==External links== * * www.latv.com * * * Santa Barbara TV Guide channel listings showing KSTV affiliations in 1992 and 1997. * 1995 FCC petition requesting cable carriage under must-carry rules. * 1998 FCC petition requesting modification of market under must-carry rules. * 2000 FCC petition requesting cable carriage. * USENET posting referring to KSTV-57 and WB affiliation * TV57 description on R-VCR.COM * Orange Bytes, November 1999 article announcing move of KWHY-TV business news JLA JLA Category:Television channels and stations established in 1990 Category:1990 establishments in California JLA ",
