    "text": "The 2019\u201320 Scottish League Two (known as Ladbrokes League Two for sponsorship reasons) was the 25th season in the current format of 10 teams in the fourth- tier of Scottish football. Ten teams contested the league: Albion Rovers, Annan Athletic, Brechin City, Cove Rangers, Cowdenbeath, Edinburgh City, Elgin City, Queen's Park, Stenhousemuir and Stirling Albion. The season began on 3 August 2019 and was scheduled to end on 2 May 2020. On 13 March 2020 all SPFL leagues were indefinitely suspended due to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. On 8 April, with the pandemic continuing, the SPFL board proposed to curtail the 2019-20 League Two season and use the points per game earned by each team to date as the final standings. The plan was approved on 15 April, meaning the league was declared over and Cove Rangers were crowned champions. ==Teams== The following teams have changed division since the 2018\u201319 season. ===To League Two=== Promoted from Highland Football League * Cove Rangers Relegated from League One * Stenhousemuir * Brechin City ===From League Two=== Relegated to Lowland Football League * Berwick Rangers Promoted to League One * Peterhead * Clyde ===Stadia and locations=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" !
