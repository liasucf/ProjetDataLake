    "text": "Oblique view of Kiess and Widmannst\u00e4tten from Apollo 12 Kiess is a lunar impact crater next to the southern border of the Mare Smythii, near the eastern limb of the Moon. It is located to the east of the crater K\u00e4stner, and to the north of Dale and Kreiken. The interior floor of this crater has been flooded by lava, leaving only a narrow rim above the surface. This surface has a low albedo, and is as dark as the neighboring mare. There is a break in the northeastern rim of Kiess where the crater is nearly attached to the somewhat smaller Widmannst\u00e4tten, another flooded formation. The overall shape of the rim is slightly elongated in longitude, but it is not overlaid by other craters of note. There are a low ridges on the western interior floor that are concentric to the inner wall. == See also == * 1788 Kiess, minor planet == References == * LTO-81B4 Kiess, Lunar Topographic Orthophotomap (LTO) Series * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
