    "text": "No Closer to Heaven is the fifth studio album by American rock band The Wonder Years. Struggling with writer's block, vocalist Daniel Campbell spoke with several friends who were in bands for inspiration. No Closer to Heaven is a concept album, detailing the loss of a loved one. The album was recorded between March and April 2015. It was produced by Steve Evetts at The Omen Room. \"Cardinals\" was released as a single in June, followed by \"Cigarettes & Saints\" a month later. \"I Don't Like Who I Was Then\" was made available for streaming in August. \"Thanks for the Ride\" was made available for streaming in early September. No Closer to Heaven was released through Hopeless on September 4. The Target edition featured two additional tracks. ==Background== Between 2010 and 2013 The Wonder Years released a trilogy of albums (The Upsides [2010], Suburbia I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing [2011] and The Greatest Generation [2013]) that dealt with vocalist Daniel Campbell's struggles of being scared, loneliness and feeling lost.Biddulph 2015, p. 43 These albums helped increase the band's popularity, \"cementing themselves as [pop punk]'s leading force\", according to Alternative Press reviewer Evan Lucy. In spring 2014 the band went on The Greatest Generation World Tour. In May, Campbell announced a solo project, Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties. With this project, Campbell pushed himself \"to make a piece of fiction feel just as raw and personal as songs about my life\". An album, We Don't Have Each Other, was released in July. Campbell performed on a few dates of the 2014 edition of Warped Tour. In February 2015, the group played three celebratory shows where they played the trilogy of albums in their entirety. ==Composition== On September 2, 2014, Campbell posted a photo with caption \"Since our last practice spot was condemned by the board of health, we'll be writing our next record in this new luxurious practice space\". On November 13, the band began writing material for their next album. Campbell later revealed that he suffered chronic writer's block while coming up with new ideas.Biddulph 2015, p. 44 He would frequently sit in his girlfriend's apartment, walk to a coffee shop, and sit by a riverside \u2013 all of which failing to inspire him. Campbell frequently hit his notebook in frustration. By January 2015 Campbell started feeling depressed, then started panicking, which turned to rage. Instead of giving up, Campbell started talking to the lyricists from both Fireworks and Hostage Calm, Ace Enders of The Early November, and Jason Aalon Butler of letlive.. These conversations helped Campbell rebuild his confidence. About the album's title, Campbell explained: \"I was at this turning point with the [new] record where I was like, \u201cI don't want to write about the suburban American experience anymore [...]\u201d I was thinking about other things in life [...] It started to feel like I was in a footrace with an expanding universe, and I was never going to get to the finish line.\" No Closer to Heaven is a concept album, detailing the loss of a loved one. Asked how this album is different compared to their previous output, Campbell replied: \"We want to make something new. We just tried to push out in every direction. It's a little bit softer, it's a little bit louder, it's a little bit faster, it's a little bit slower. It moves out every way.\" All the songs were written by The Wonder Years at The Nightmare Factory. Campbell wrote all the lyrics in, according to the album booklet, \"his bedroom and various coffee shops or parks.\" Jason Aalon Butler provided additional lyrics for \"Stained Glass Ceilings\" while in the break room at the studio. In \"Cardinals\", Campbell expresses grief about himself \"being too self-involved to see when someone you love needs your help.\" \"Thanks for the Ride\" was written about Campbell's deceased friend who he ponders what her life would be like if she had lived. Campbell explained that he attempted to write a verse \"if [a person] had come out of the coma [scenario]\". ==Recording== On March 13, 2015 the band entered pre-production for a new album. On April 19, the band announced they had finished recording. The album was produced and engineered by Steve Evetts at The Omen Room. Additional engineering was performed by Allan Hessler.

A day later, \"Cardinals\" was made available for streaming and a music video was released. The video was directed by Kevin Slack. The video features Campbell carrying an unconscious friend down a street. The song was also released as a single. When Campbell gets to the middle of the road, an ambulance is seen situated in front of him. As Campbell moves closer to it, the ambulance pulls away. The rest of the band members have cameos in the video. The band played on the 2015 edition of Warped Tour. On July 31, the band released a music video for \"Cigarettes & Saints\", which was directed by Jeremi Mattern of Driver Friendly. The video features a teenage girl apparently writing a suicide note.
