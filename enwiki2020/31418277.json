Ibaraki 4th district is a \"conservative kingdom\" (hoshu \u014dkoku), a stronghold of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). It wasn't even contested by the main opposition Democratic Party in the 2000 and 2003 general elections and withstood the Democratic landslide victory in the election of 2009. Since its creation the district has been represented by the Kajiyama family for the LDP: former Trade, Home, Justice Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama (Obuchi faction) and his son Hiroshi (no faction). ==List of representatives== {| class=wikitable |- valign=bottom !
