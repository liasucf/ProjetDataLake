Archer was born and raised in Devonport, Tasmania where she began playing soccer at a young age, notably scoring 25 goals for Devonport City as a 16-year-old in the 2004 Northern Premier League. In the same year, Meghan competed for Tasmania in the Under-17 National Championships, where she was identified as one of the players of the tournament, and invited by then NTC coach Harry Chalkitis to train with his squad in Melbourne. After securing an NTC squad position, Archer relocated to Melbourne in 2005, where she played for Heidelberg United in the Victorian Premier League, making a total of 65 appearances and scoring 19 goals in her first three seasons at the club.
