    "text": "Garnet Valley High School 2017 Garnet Valley is an unincorporated community in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The name was created by the United States Postal Service in late 2006 to allow residents of Bethel Township and Concord Township who were within the 19061 ZIP code and were part of the Garnet Valley School District to distinguish themselves from residents of Upper Chichester Township. The default \"city name\" for the 19061 ZIP code is Marcus Hook; other acceptable names in the ZIP code include Trainer, Linwood, and Boothwyn. The residents of Bethel Township and Concord Township sought a new postal identity because the ZIP code \"city names\" are often confused with actual municipal names. As of July 1, 2009, Garnet Valley was removed from ZIP code 19061 and assigned to a new ZIP code, 19060. Although the community name is derived from the Garnet Valley School District, the district's headquarters are not within the Garnet Valley ZIP code. The district's address is in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania 19342. ==History== The community name is derived from the garnet mines established in Bethel Township by Herman Behr & Co. of New York in 1879. The mine operated until 1912. ==Notable residents== * Bill Haley. The rock and roll pioneer spent some of his youth living in a small home in Garnet Valley; in the mid-1950s, he constructed his home near that shack. The house located on Foulk Road , dubbed \"Melody Manor\", was his home base into the 1960s and continues to be associated with Haley. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Delaware County, Pennsylvania Category:Unincorporated communities in Pennsylvania ",
