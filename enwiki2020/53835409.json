As he grew up, he wanted to use his mathematical talents to make a profit so immediately after finishing a university physics degree in 1977, he went to the blackjack tables in Las Vegas and used his skills to count cards. He came across the book, Beat the Dealer, by Edward O. Thorp, which helped him improve his methods. Seven years later, he was banned from all of Vegas\u2019 strip's casinos. Benter then met with Alan Woods, a like-minded gambler whose expertise in horse racing complemented his own in computers. The two became racing partners and in 1984, moved to Hong Kong. Starting with a mere US$150,000 (), the pair relied on their mathematical skill to create a formula for choosing race winners. Using his statistical model, Benter identified factors that could lead to successful race predictions. He found that some came out as more important than others.
