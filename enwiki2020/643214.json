He spent most of his active career with the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals of the Major League Baseball (MLB). ==Professional career== ===New York Yankees=== Armas was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1994. ===Boston Red Sox=== Armas and a player to be named later (Jim Mecir), were traded to the Boston Red Sox in 1997 for Mike Stanley and Randy Brown. ===Montr\u00e9al Expos/Washington Nationals=== He was sent to the Montr\u00e9al Expos in 1997 along with pitcher Carl Pavano in exchange for Pedro Mart\u00ednez. Various injuries held him back until 2003, when he was the team's Opening Day starter, shutting down the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field, 10\u20132. But the strong start turned into a breakdown weeks later, after he was diagnosed with injuries in his arm and shoulder which required season-ending surgery. At that time, Armas had a record of 2\u20131, 23 strikeouts and a 2.61 ERA, with a WHIP of 1.065 and not allowing a home run until his fifth and last start. Armas worked out in 2004 spring training, and his recovery was proceeding. Although the team initially hoped he could be ready for the start of the season, the rehabilitation was slower than expected. He finished the season with a 2\u20134 mark in 72 innings. In a nine-year career, Armas had a 52\u201365 record with 674 strikeouts and a 4.62 ERA in 917.3 innings. At bat, he was a .098 hitter (26-for-265) with ten RBI. During the 2006 season, Armas had a 9\u201312 record in 30 starts. Armas missed one month with arm problems, but in his second game back from the disabled list he pitched seven innings, allowing only one run on three hits. On October 29, 2006, Armas filed for free agency. ===Pittsburgh Pirates=== On February 1, 2007, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates for a one-year $3.5 million contract with a 2008 mutual option. After starting the 2007 season 0\u20133 with an 8.92 ERA, Armas was removed from the rotation. ===New York Mets=== On February 11, 2008, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the New York Mets. He re-signed with the Mets in January 2009. However, he was released on March 31, 2009, after not making the team.Armas, Spivey out ===Atlanta Braves=== In April 2009, he was signed by the Atlanta Braves and assigned to the Triple-A Gwinnett Braves.Braves Sign Armas On July 25, 2009, the Braves released Armas. ==Pitching style== Armas used a low-90s moving fastball and a sharp-breaking curve to establish what he wanted to do with each hitter. He had an effective slider, a splitter, and a changeup to keep opponents out of balance. ==Personal life== Armas is the son of former All-Star outfielder Tony Armas, and a nephew of former first baseman Marcos Armas. Tony's father broke into the Majors with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1976. ==See also== *List of Montreal Expos Opening Day starting pitchers * List of second-generation Major League Baseball players * List of Major League Baseball players from Venezuela ==References== ==External links== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:Brevard County Manatees players Category:Caribes de Anzo\u00e1tegui players Category:Caribes de Oriente players Category:Edmonton Trappers players Category:Greensboro Bats players Category:Gulf Coast Nationals players Category:Gulf Coast Yankees players Category:Gwinnett Braves players Category:Harrisburg Senators players Category:Jupiter Hammerheads players Category:Leones del Caracas players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from Venezuela Category:Mississippi Braves players Category:Montreal Expos players Category:New Orleans Zephyrs players Category:New York Mets players Category:Oneonta Yankees players Category:Ottawa Lynx players Category:People from Anzo\u00e1tegui Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Sarasota Red Sox players Category:Tampa Yankees players Category:Venezuelan expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Venezuelan expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Washington Nationals players Category:World Baseball Classic players of Venezuela Category:2006 World Baseball Classic players ",
