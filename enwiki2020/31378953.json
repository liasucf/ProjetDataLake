    "text": "Fu Yi (; 554\u2212639) was a Sui dynasty official who later became historiographer during the reign of Emperor Gaozu of the Tang dynasty. He presented a memorial asking that Buddhism might be abolished; and when Xiao Yu questioned him on the subject, he said, \u201cYou were not born in a hollow mulberry-tree; yet you respect a religion which does not recognize the tie between father and son!\u201d He urged that at any rate priests and nuns should be compelled to marry and bring up families, and not escape from contributing their share to the revenue, adding that Xiao Yu by defending their doctrines showed himself no better than they were. At this time Xiao Yu held up his hands, and declared that hell was made for such men as Fu Yi. The result was that severe restrictions were placed for a short time upon teachers of Buddhism.Herbert Allen Giles, A Chinese Biographical Dictionary, p. 236. (copyright expired). Emperor Taizong of Tang once got hold of a Tartar priest who could \u201ccharm people into unconsciousness, and then charm them back to life again,\u201d and spoke of his powers to Fu Yi. The latter said confidently, \u201cHe will not be able to charm me;\u201d and when put to the test, the priest completely failed. He was the originator of epitaphs, and wrote his own, as follows: -- Fu Yi loved the green hills and the white clouds. Alas! He died of drink. ==References== Category:554 births Category:639 deaths Category:6th-century Chinese people Category:7th-century Chinese people ",
