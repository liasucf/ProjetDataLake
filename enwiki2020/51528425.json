    "text": "\"Chapter 4\" (or \"Episode 104\") is the fourth episode of the first season of the American political thriller drama series House of Cards. It premiered on February 1, 2013, when it was released along with the rest of the first season on the American streaming service Netflix. ==Plot== Frank (Kevin Spacey) learns that House Speaker Bob Birch (Larry Pine) and Linda (Sakina Jaffrey) are refusing to compromise on the education bill. He discourages President Walker (Michel Gill) from compromising on the bill, saying doing so will make the Oval Office look weak. Frank offers to help Majority Leader David Rasmussen (Michael Siberry) become the next Speaker in exchange for ousting Birch. Frank and Doug (Michael Kelly) also offer Black Caucus leader Terry Womack (Curtiss Cook) the Majority Leader position once Rasmussen becomes Speaker. To win Womack's support, Frank forces Russo (Corey Stoll) to allow a shipyard in his district to close in order to keep a military base open in Womack's. Russo agrees, despite his fear that the resulting job losses will erode his voter base. After Russo gets drunk and leaves his children alone at his apartment, Christina (Kristen Connolly) breaks up with him. With Womack's support, Frank gets enough votes in the House to oust Birch, but tells the Speaker that he will not vote against him if Womack is appointed as Rasmussen's replacement. Both Frank and Birch announce their agreement to Rasmussen, who resigns. Meanwhile, Claire (Robin Wright) is visited by Remy (Mahershala Ali), who offers a double donation of $1.5 million if the Clean Water Initiative forms a partnership with SanCorp. Despite needing the funds for Gillian's Sudan project, Claire turns it down after consulting with Frank. Instead of taking favors from SanCorp, Frank decides to organize a fundraising gala. To further showcase the CWI, Claire invites Adam Galloway (Ben Daniels), a New York-based photographer with whom she had a relationship in past. Galloway invites Claire for dinner and they share an intimate moment, but she turns down his advances and makes it clear their relation is to be business only. Tensions further escalate between Zoe (Kate Mara) and Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) when the Herald's owner, Margaret Tilden (Kathleen Chalfant) allows Zoe to continue her work. In order to avoid any further clashes, Hammerschmidt offers Janine's (Constance Zimmer) job as White House correspondent to Zoe. Despite her reluctance, both Janine and Lucas (Sebastian Arcelus) encourage her to take the position. However, Frank persuades Zoe not to take it. As a result, Hammerschmidt angrily calls her \"cunt\", which she tweets about before resigning from The Washington Herald. Zoe invites Frank to her apartment, where they end up having sex. ==Cast== Following is the list of billed cast. ===Main cast=== * Kevin Spacey as U.S. Representative Francis J.
