    "text": "Ashley was a New Zealand electorate situated north of Christchurch. It was in use from 1866 to 1902, and was replaced with the Hurunui electorate. ==Population centres== In the 1865 electoral redistribution, the House of Representatives focussed its review of electorates to South Island electorates only, as the Central Otago Gold Rush had caused significant population growth, and a redistribution of the existing population. Fifteen additional South Island electorates were created, including Ashley, and the number of Members of Parliament was increased by 13 to 70. The Ashley electorate was formed from a corner of Cheviot electorate, and included the towns of Ashley, Amberley, and Oxford. The electorate's boundaries remained roughly the same until the 1881 election, when it expanded slightly into Kaiapoi electorate and Amberley was returned to Cheviot. In the 1887 election, the electorate expanded westwards into Cheviot's southern tip. In the 1890 election, Cheviot itself was abolished, and the majority of its territory was absorbed into Ashley -- to compensate, territory was taken from Ashley in the south and given to Kaiapoi. In the 1893 election, Ashley expanded further north, taking the town of Kaik\u014dura from Wairau electorate, but ceded Oxford to Kaiapoi in the south. In the 1902 election, Ashley was dissolved, being replaced with an electorate called Hurunui, covering much the same area. ==History== The first representative was Lancelot Walker, who won the . Walker resigned in the following year and was succeeded by Henry Tancred in the . Tancred retired at the end of the parliamentary term in 1870 and was succeeded by John Evans Brown. In the , the electorate was contested by Richard Meredith, James Dupr\u00e9 Lance and John George Knight, who received 648, 611 and 137 votes, respectively. Meredith was thus declared elected. ===Members of Parliament=== Key {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=100 |Election ! width=175 colspan=2 |Winner |- | | width=5 bgcolor= | | Lancelot Walker |- | | bgcolor= | | Henry Tancred |- | | rowspan=2 bgcolor= | | rowspan=2 | John Brown |- | 1876 election |- | | bgcolor= | | | William Moorhouse |- | | rowspan=3 bgcolor= | | rowspan=3 | William Pearson |- | |- | |- | | bgcolor= | | John Verrall |- | | rowspan=4 bgcolor= | | rowspan=4 | Richard Meredith |- | |- | |- | |- |colspan=3 align=center|(Electorate abolished in 1902; see ) |} ==Election results== ===1899 election=== ===1893 election=== ===1890 election=== ===1888 by-election=== ===1887 election=== ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:Historical electorates of New Zealand Category:1865 establishments in New Zealand Category:1902 disestablishments in New Zealand Category:Waimakariri District Category:Politics of Canterbury, New Zealand ",
