A twelve-minute appearance in the Copa Argentina against Almirante Brown in April 2014 saw Cerutti make his bow in senior football, replacing H\u00e9ctor Cardozo in a defeat at the Estadio San Juan del Bicentenario. He made his debut in Primera B Nacional versus Crucero del Norte in the succeeding June, which lasted just forty-five minutes after he received a red card on the brink of half-time. Sixty total appearances followed across the next five seasons, with the midfielder netting his opening career goals against Juventud Unida and Argentinos Juniors in the process. Cerutti left Independiente Rivadavia on 31 December 2017 after rejecting a new contract, though was unable to join a new club due to disagreements with his former team. Cerutti, who is of Italian descent, joined second tier side Temperley on a free transfer on 30 June 2018; having trained with them since February. He remained for two seasons, making forty-one appearances in all competitions; he also scored two goals, with both arriving in December 2018 against Deportivo Mor\u00f3n and Independiente Rivadavia respectively. In August 2020, Cerutti moved abroad with Super League Greece 2 team Panachaiki. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"7\"|Independiente Rivadavia |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"6\"|Primera B Nacional |1||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- |2014 |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- |2015 |17||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||19||0 |- |2016 |8||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||8||0 |- |2016\u201317 |23||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||24||2 |- |2017\u201318 |7||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||7||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !58!!2!!4!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!62!!2 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Temperley |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |20||2||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||24||2 |- |2019\u201320 |17||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||17||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !37!!2!!4!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!41!!2 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Panachaiki |2020\u201321 |rowspan=\"1\"|Super League 2 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !95!!4!!8!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!103!!4 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Mendoza, Argentina Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Greece Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Independiente Rivadavia footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Temperley footballers Category:Panachaiki F.C. players ",
