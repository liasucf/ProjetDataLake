    "text": "Catherine Crump (born 1978) is an American activist and advocate for individual rights and particularly the right of privacy. ==Career== She served as a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union and is currently a law professor and director of the Samuelson Law, Technology and Public Policy Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley. Crump is a staunch and consistent advocate for privacy. She criticized the FAA for focusing exclusively on safety issues regarding drone aircraft and not addressing possible privacy issues such as whether the craft could be misused for spying and data gathering. She criticized the use of cameras to read license plates and subsequently build databases on the \"movements of millions of Americans over months or even years\". She has argued that Congress should prohibit the misuse by law enforcement officers of cell phone and GPS technology to collect private information on innocent people without first getting a warrant. She criticized the policy of border patrol agents to detain travelers and examine the contents of their laptop computers and cell phones \"without suspecting the traveler of wrongdoing\". She believes government should target surveillance based on \"those suspected of wrongdoing\" and refrain from building giant databases of the movements of innocent citizens. ==References== ==External links== * Faculty profile: Catherine Crump at Berkeley Law * ** \"The small and surprisingly dangerous detail the police track about you\" (TEDGlobal 2014) Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American civil rights lawyers Category:American women lawyers Category:UC Berkeley School of Law faculty Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Activists from California Category:Women legal scholars ",
