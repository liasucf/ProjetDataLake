Metcalfe admitted that his hesitation also stemmed from his belief that the series was just \"another prime-time soap opera to me, it wasn't somewhere I wanted to go.\" Metcalfe originally auditioned for the role of John Ross, which was instead awarded to Josh Henderson. On February 8, 2011, Nellie Andreeva reported that the series had narrowed the search for Christopher down to two actors, one of which was Metcalfe; Metcalfe was known for his portrayal of John Rowland on Desperate Housewives.

He also possesses a strong sense of morality. He wants to protect his family, and make his family, and his adoptive father proud.

Of his alter ego, in addition to maintaining his smarts, Metcalfe said Christopher should be \"a step ahead. I think in the past that was possibly the problem with Bobby; is that he always seemed to be a step behind. I want Christopher to have learned from his father's mistakes. I want Christopher to have learned from history there and to maybe be a smarter version of his father, and also one there's a little more grey area with Christopher.\" Christopher is not completely defined by his morality, but at \"his core he's a very moral and ethical guy,\" said Metcalfe.
