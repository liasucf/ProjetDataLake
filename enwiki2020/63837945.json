Its initial orientation is North-East, but Ledru-Rollin Avenue eventually curves towards the North. The entire boulevard is bordered by trees on both sides, and it passes through the three main east-west arteries of the 12th arrondissement: Avenue Daumesnil, the rue de Charenton and the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine, the last of which marks the border between the 12th and the 11th arrondissements. Most of the buildings on the avenue date from the 19th and 20th centuries, and some of them are quite distinguished. Ledru- Rollin Avenue is easily accessed via the M\u00e9tro stations Quai de la Rap\u00e9e ( ), Ledru-Rollin ( ), and Voltaire ( ). It is also close to the stations Bastille and Gare de Lyon on Metro Line , and is home to many bus stops as well, including the 20, 24, 57, 61, 63, and 65 as well as the 69, 76 & 86\\. ==Origin of the name== In 1879, the avenue was named in honour of the French lawyer and politician Alexandre Auguste Ledru, also known as Ledru-Rollin (1807-1874), Minister of the Interior of the 2nd Republic, and a champion of universal suffrage (for men). Twenty-six other French cities and towns also bear streets with the name Ledru-Rollin: a boulevard in Montpellier, and streets in Agen, Dijon, Avignon, Ch\u00e2teauroux, Tours, Tarbes, Bellac, Argenton-sur-Creuse, Limoges, Marseille, La Ciotat, Moulins, Pertuis, Hellemmes, Reims, Roanne, Rueil-Malmaison, Suresnes, Mauguio, Rochefort-sur-Mer, Sotteville-l\u00e8s-Rouen, Houilles, Choisy-le-Roi, Ivry-sur-Seine, and in Fontenay-aux-Roses, where he died on 31 December 1874. ==History== A part of Ledru-Rollin Avenue was inundated in the famous flooding of the Seine River in January 1910.
