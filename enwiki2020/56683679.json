    "text": "\"Toy\" (Hebrew transliteration: ) is a song recorded by Israeli singer Netta, and was Israel's submission to the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, which it won. The track was written by Doron Medalie and Stav Beger, and produced by Beger. The song was released on 11 March 2018 along with its official music video clip, which was directed by Keren Hochma. The song was leaked online a day before the official release. The song won the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 with 529 points. It marks Israel's fourth Eurovision win along with 1978, 1979 and 1998. The song reached the top of the charts in Israel. The song became the most viewed video on Eurovision Song Contest's YouTube channel on 27 May 2018 and is the third most viewed song from Eurovision, after \"Occidentali's Karma\" and \"Grande amore\" (both entries from Italy, 2017 and 2015). The song is featured in the game Just Dance 2019. ==Lyrics== The song's lyrics are mostly in English, with the exception of the Hebrew phrase (ani lo buba, \"I am not a doll\"), and the slang word (stefa, meaning a pile of banknotes).\"\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05e7 \u05e8\u05d5\u05d6\u05e0\u05d8\u05dc, \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05e1\u05dc\u05e0\u05d2 \u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05d9\u05e3\" (Comprehensive Slang Dictionary), , p. 259 The Japanese word baka ( \"stupid\") is also used extensively and the Pok\u00e9mon character Pikachu is used once. \"Trump-pam-pau\" refers to the President of the United States, Donald Trump, as Doron Medalie revealed in April 2019 to the Israeli media. ==Eurovision Song Contest== Performance at the first semi final rehearsal \"Toy\" was first drawn to compete at the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, in which it was performed seventh in a field of nineteen songs, and achieved first place, based on a combination of fourth placing from televote and first from jury. It thus qualified for the final, under a format progressing the top ten most-voted songs from each semi-final. In the final the song was performed 22nd in a field of 26, and won, based on third placing with 212 points from the jury and winning the televote with 317 points, achieving overall first place with a combined score of 529 points which Israel later won hosting rights for 2019 in Tel Aviv. ==Critical reception== Charlotte Runcie of The Daily Telegraph awarded the song five stars out of five, describing it as \"gloriously bizarre pop\" with \"playful lyrics and a powerful vocal performance\". Allegations were made that the performance of the song at Eurovision featured appropriation of Japanese cultural imagery as a \"prop\", including Netta wearing a kimono and buns, and the performance's staging featuring Maneki-nekos\u2014a Japanese symbol of luck. Netta did not responded to the allegations, but did state in previous interviews that she was a follower of Japanese popular culture, particularly the Pok\u00e9mon franchise. ==Copyright claim== On 3 July 2018, Israeli infotainer Guy Pines reported that Universal Music Group may file a lawsuit claiming \"Toy\" similarities in rhythm and harmony with The White Stripes' song \"Seven Nation Army\". Universal sent a pre-suit notice letter to the songwriters Doron Medalie and Stav Beger, claiming copyright infringement. In February 2019 the Israeli composers agreed to give writing credit to Jack White, and he gets a share in the royalties for the song. Medalie and Beger had reportedly agreed to give Universal some of the song\u2019s distribution rights in certain territories, potentially exposing the song to an even larger audience. ==Credits and personnel== Recording and management *Recorded at Stav Beger Studios (Tel Aviv) *Published by Tedy Productions and Unicell Personnel *Netta \u2013 vocals, loop arrangements *Doron Medalie \u2013 composition *Stav Beger \u2013 composition, production, percussion, mixing and mastering *Jack White \u2013 composition *Avshalom Ariel \u2013 loop arrangements *Ami Ben Abu \u2013 keyboards *Shimon Yihye \u2013 guitars *Daniel Rubin, Maayan Bukris and Liron Carakukly \u2013 background vocals ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018\u201319) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Euro Digital Songs (Billboard) | 9 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greece Digital Singles (IFPI Greece) | 12 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 63 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Israel (Media Forest) | 1 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Norway (VG-lista) | 19 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spain (PROMUSICAE) | 16 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 5 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Dance Club Songs (Billboard) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) | 11 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Dance Club Songs (Billboard) | 48 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) | 78 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) | 45 |} === Decade-end charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Chart (2010-19) ! scope=\"col\" | Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\" | Israel (Mako) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Israel (Walla!) | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Israel (Kan Gimmel) | 32 |} ==Certifications== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Billboard Dance Club Songs number-one singles Category:Eurovision Song Contest winning songs Category:Eurovision songs of 2018 Category:Eurovision songs of Israel Category:Number-one singles in Israel Category:Songs written by Doron Medalie Category:Songs involved in plagiarism controversies Category:Songs written by Jack White Category:Netta Barzilai songs ",
