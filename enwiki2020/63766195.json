    "text": "dj VirtualDJ (VDJ) is audio and video mixing software for Microsoft Windows and macOS, developed by Atomix Productions. == History == The first version of VirtualDJ appeared on 1 July 2003. VirtualDJ is the successor to AtomixMP3, the first version of which dates from September 2000. The development of AtomixMP3 stopped in December 2003 as soon as its successor VirtualDJ was marketed. VirtualDJ existed in three different versions until 2009: Home Edition (sold in stores), PRO (only available online), and Limited Version (free with certain MIDI controllers). In late 2009, a new version called VirtualDJ Basic went on sale as a budget-friendly alternative to VirtualDJ Pro, without MIDI control. Since October 2010, the range of products is available in 4 offers: Pro Full (the full version), Pro Basic , Broadcaster and Home FREE . Also in 2010, VirtualDJ won the prize for best mixing software at the 25th edition of the Annual International Dance Music Awards in Miami. == Features == The software has a default layout made of two turntables (vinyl or CD) associated with a central mixer. It includes a bar for viewing the status of the two audio tracks as well as the management of the playlist and of current readings with a search function in the database. We can see current track of the different decks in a graphical window at the top odf the screen which allows you to quickly visualize the curve (waveform) of the live sound. The user can also perform loops of variable duration. SoundCloud Go+ subscribers can integrate SoundCloud with VirtualDJ to allow streaming and mixing of the entire SoundCloud catalogue. == References == == External links == * Category:Audio mixing software Category:DJ software Category:MacOS multimedia software Category:Windows multimedia software Category:Freeware ",
