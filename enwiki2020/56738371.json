    "text": "The Deildabikar Women, also known as the Icelandic League Cup is a pre-season professional football competition in Iceland. It is considered the third most important competition in Icelandic women's football. The pre-season tournament involves the top 6 clubs in Iceland from the previous season of \u00darvaldeild kvenna. It generally takes place between February and May. == Format == The 6 teams are placed in one group. Each team meets each other once during the pool stage. The final positions of the group are determined after these 5 games are played. The top four of the group automatically gain entry to the next stage in the competition. From the semifinal round it is a purely knockout competition where ties take place over 1-leg only. If a tie is not decided in 90 minutes, penalty kicks are taken to decide the game. == Winners == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! Club ! Titles !
