    "text": "The Swedish National Socialist Farmers' and Workers' Party () was the first Nazi organization in Sweden. ==Founding== In 1923 Sigurd and Gunnar had met Adolf Hitler and Erich Ludendorff. The organization was founded by Birger Furug\u00e5rd and his two brothers Sigurd and Gunnar, at a meeting in \u00c4lvdalen a year later on 12 August 1924 as the Swedish National Socialist Freedom League (). The group started the publication Nationalsocialisten, with Sigurd as its editor. The organization was renamed to its final name the following year. The party largely remained confined to V\u00e4rmland. The publication of Nationalsocialisten was discontinued. In 1930 the party merged with the Fascist People's Party of Sweden of Sven Olov Lindholm, and formed the Swedish National Socialist Party (SNSP). ==References== Category:Political parties established in 1924 Category:1924 establishments in Sweden Category:Nazi parties Category:Defunct political parties in Sweden Category:Nazism in Sweden ",
