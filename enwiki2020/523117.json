These regions hold annual Regional Technology fairs whereby the winners go to the State Fair in Montgomery to compete in fourteen competition categories. The largest of the regional fairs is the jointly-held South East and South West Regional fair that is held at the Faulkner State College campus in Bay Minette, Alabama. Over 200 schools throughout Alabama are part of the ACTE. Category:Education in Alabama ",
