In The Guardian, Mary Hoffman described the novel as \"a good book and a great story.\" Hoffman says that \"how Dante comes to terms with fatherhood and his responsibilities is genuinely moving, while staying on the right side of sentimentality.\" Nicholas Tucker in The Independent described the novel as, at times, \"too much plot manipulation has crept into this story\", while \"The rest of this novel still shows her writing at its best, creating characters and a story which, once read, will not easily go away.\" == References == == Further reading == * Category:2010 novels Category:Cultural depictions of Dante Alighieri ",
