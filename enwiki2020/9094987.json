    "text": "Sigma Lambda Upsilon (\u03a3\u039b\u03a5) or Se\u00f1oritas Latinas Unidas Sorority, Inc. is a Latina-based sorority founded on December 1, 1987 at Binghamton University. ==History== The organization was created to promote academic achievement and serve the Latino community and the campuses that Sigma Lambda Upsilon serves. The sorority is now present in over 50 campuses. Though Latina-based, Sigma Lambda Upsilon Sorority, Inc. is a non-discriminatory organization. ==Philanthropy== Historically, the organization has worked with children and youth as the primary target population to aid in literacy in education and career success. In the early 1990s, there was much interest centered on bilingualism in the classroom and the high illiteracy rates across America. At age four, Latino children tend to have less developed school-related skills than their caucasian counterparts. By age nine, It was found that Latino students tend to lag behind in reading, mathematics, and science proficiency. Thus, in the spring of 2000, the Sorority decided to focus its efforts and funding on literacy. The Sorority advocates for literacy as a means of ensuring the empowerment and success of our nation and the people of its diverse communities. They encourage literacy as an activity that affords limitless possibilities and promotes reading and writing as enjoyable, exciting, and empowering. Literacy is more than just reading. It\u2019s the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, computer and use printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy can be expanded to include many areas such as: financial literacy, technological literacy, health literacy and more. The premise of their philanthropic work focuses on the power of literacy to uplift their communities and foster confidence in their young people, for them to advance toward their educational, personal, and professional goals. ==Mentoring programs== Sigma Lambda Upsilon's national mentoring initiatives are the Leadership, Advancement, and Development of our Young Sisters (LADYS) and Promoting Education, the Arts, our Roots, Leadership and Service (PEARLS) programs. ==Awards & recognition== Sigma Lambda Upsilon Sorority, Inc. has been recognized by the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO) for the Sorority\u2019s outstanding commitment to academic and professional excellence, as well as, continuous philanthropic efforts. ==Undergraduate chapters== Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Se\u00f1oritas Latinas Unidas Sorority, Inc. has 43 chapters at over 60 Colleges and Universities: *Alpha chapter - Binghamton University *Beta chapter - Buffalo State College, University at Buffalo, Daemen College *Gamma chapter - University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Bryn Mawr College, Drexel University, St. Joseph\u2019s University *Delta chapter - Brown University *Epsilon chapter - State University of New York at Cortland *Zeta chapter - State University of New York at Oswego *Eta chapter - Syracuse University *Iota chapter - Cornell University, Ithaca College *Kappa chapter - Princeton University *Lambda chapter - Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey *Mu chapter - University at Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Union College, College of Saint Rose *Nu chapter - Pennsylvania State University *Xi chapter - University of Rhode Island *Omicron chapter - New York University, City College-CUNY, Baruch College-CUNY, St. Francis College, Lehman College-CUNY *Pi chapter - Yale University *Rho chapter - Johnson and Wales University *Sigma chapter - Union College *Tau chapter - Rutgers University-Newark *Upsilon chapter - University of Maryland, College Park *Phi chapter - University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Smith College, Hampshire College, Amherst College, Mount Holyoke College *Chi chapter - Boston University, Tufts University, Brandeis University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology *Psi chapter - University of Rochester, Rochester Institute of Technology, St. John Fisher College, Nazareth College *Omega chapter - Old Dominion University *Alpha Alpha chapter - Columbia University, Barnard College *Alpha Beta chapter - Dartmouth College *Alpha Gamma chapter - George Washington University *Alpha Delta chapter - State University of New York at Stony Brook *Alpha Epsilon chapter - State University of New York at Plattsburgh *Alpha Zeta chapter - Virginia Commonwealth University *Alpha Eta chapter - Indiana University at Bloomington *Alpha Theta chapter - Wesleyan University *Alpha Iota chapter - Hamilton College *Alpha Kappa chapter - Adelphi University *Alpha Lambda chapter - Montclair State University *Alpha Mu chapter - State University of New York at New Paltz *Alpha Nu chapter - Grand Valley State University *Alpha Xi chapter - Pace University- Pleasantville *Alpha Omicron chapter - University of Connecticut-Storrs *Alpha Pi chapter - Georgia State University *Alpha Rho chapter - University of Virginia-Charlottesville *Alpha Sigma chapter - Farmingdale State College *Alpha Tau chapter - James Madison University ==Graduate chapters== *Theta Alpha - New York City, NY *Theta Beta - Providence, RI *Theta Gamma - Albany, NY *Theta Delta - Texas *Theta Epsilon - Buffalo, NY *Theta Zeta - Philadelphia, PA *Theta Eta - New Jersey *Theta Theta - DC/Maryland/Northern Virginia *Theta Iota - Florida *Theta Kappa - California *Theta Lambda - Harrisburg, PA *Theta Mu - Boston, MA *Theta Nu - OH / MI / IN / IL *Theta Xi - Rochester, NY *Theta Omicron - Westchester, NY *Theta Pi - Atlanta, GA *Theta Rho - Long Island, NY *Theta Sigma - Southern VA ==References== *National website *NALFO ==External links== *National website Category:1987 establishments in New York (state) Category:Student societies in the United States Category:Latino fraternities and sororities Category:Student organizations established in 1987 Category:National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations ",
