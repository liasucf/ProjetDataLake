    "text": "Aware Records is an American record label. The label has had success with a range of artists, including John Mayer, Train, Five for Fighting, Mat Kearney, and Guster. ==History== Aware Records was founded in 1993 by Gregg Latterman with the simple intention to find the best unsigned acts in the country and increase their national exposure through a compilation album. In the fall of 1995, the label formed the inaugural Aware Tour, utilizing its marketing team to pack venues from Nashville to Boston. The first tour built a strong foundation leading to larger, more aggressive, national tours from 1996 to 1999. In July 1997, Aware entered into an agreement with Columbia Records providing the major label with grassroots artist development, and Aware access to national marketing and distribution. By 1998, Aware secured national sponsorship from Levi's and Nantucket Nectars. In 1999, Aware embraced the power of the Internet in the music business and secured sponsorships from Efollett.com and Liquid Audio. The 2003 Aware Tour was sponsored by Ice breakers and featured Toad the Wet Sprocket as headliner, with Aware bands Wheat and Bleu as supporting acts. Aware's joint venture with Columbia Records was renewed in the summer of 2002. Through Aware's relationship with Columbia Records, they have released full-length albums by artists such as Train, Five for Fighting and John Mayer. Aware's rise in the music industry has also afforded the company many unique opportunities. Aware was the exclusive CD retailer for the H.O.R.D.E. tours from 1995\u20131998 and Woodstock '99. In July 2010 Aware's joint venture deal with Columbia expired; Aware has since signed a new deal with Universal Republic. In 2000 Aware Records starting Internet radio by CJ Hebb through New England Digital Arts. The agreement was that the radio broadcasts would focus on record label artist and royalties would be paid to ASCAP, BMI and SESAC. Internet streaming was broadcast for two years reaching 61 countries and 82 top US markets. Current Aware artists include Mat Kearney. ==A-Squared Management== Formed in October 1999, A-Squared Management (or A\u00b2 Management) is a separate management division whose current clients include, Emily Hearn, Marie Miller, Mat Kearney, and Mayday Parade.
