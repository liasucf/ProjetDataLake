    "text": "Conrad Schools of Science is a public high school in Wilmington, Delaware, United States. It is one of five high schools in the Red Clay Consolidated School District. It opened as the Henry C. Conrad High School in 1935 and in 1978 it became the Conrad Middle School. The building was renamed as the Schools of Science in 2007. == Academics == The school serves students in grades 6th through 12th in a life science magnet school. The high school curriculum contains the following six strands: * Biomedical \u2013 Science * Biotechnology \u2013 Research * Veterinary \u2013 Science * Nursing Technology * Physical Therapy & Athletic Health care * Computer Science == Athletics == The school offers a variety of sports during the following three seasons:https://www.conradsports.com/ * Fall \u2013 Football, Cheerleading, Cross Country, Field Hockey, Soccer (Boys), and Volleyball (Girls). * Winter \u2013 Basketball, Cheerleading, Ice Hockey, Swimming, Indoor Track, and Wrestling * Spring \u2013 Baseball, Golf, Lacrosse, Soccer (Girls, Softball, Tennis, Track and Field, and Volleyball (Boys) == Mascot == In 2015 a committee was formed to explore the possibility changing the Redskins mascot that has been used for 80 years, but which some people now agree is offensive to Native Americans. The mission statement of the Retire the Mascot Committee is: \"Promote a cultural understanding for the retirement of our current Conrad Schools of Science mascot and select a yet to be named, new mascot, that will proudly represent our school, our community, and our history\". However, that committee was met with a larger than anticipated amount of opposition, and the debates continued. A poll led by the News Journal revealed that 86% of voters felt that Conrad Schools of Science should keep the Redskins name and logo. In June 2016, the Red Clay board voted 4\u20132 to drop the Redskins name, and begin the process of selecting a replacement. Since then, Red Wolves has been chosen as the replacement mascot, with new spirit wear sporting a design by the high schools faculty members. == References == == External link == * Category:High schools in New Castle County, Delaware Category:Public high schools in Delaware Category:1935 establishments in Delaware Category:Educational institutions established in 1935 ",
