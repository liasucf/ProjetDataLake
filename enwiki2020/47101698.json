    "text": "The Dubins\u2013Spanier theorems are several theorems in the theory of fair cake- cutting. They were published by Lester Dubins and Edwin Spanier in 1961. Although the original motivation for these theorems is fair division, they are in fact general theorems in measure theory. == Setting == There is a set U, and a set \\mathbb{U} which is a sigma-algebra of subsets of U. There are n partners. Every partner i has a personal value measure V_i: \\mathbb{U} \\to \\mathbb{R}. This function determines how much each subset of U is worth to that partner. Let X a partition of U to k measurable sets: U = X_1 \\sqcup \\cdots \\sqcup X_k. Define the matrix M_X as the following n\\times k matrix: :M_X[i,j] = V_i(X_j) This matrix contains the valuations of all players to all pieces of the partition. Let \\mathbb{M} be the collection of all such matrices (for the same value measures, the same k, and different partitions): :\\mathbb{M} = \\\\{M_X \\mid X\\text{ is a }k\\text{-partition of U}\\\\} The Dubins\u2013Spanier theorems deal with the topological properties of \\mathbb{M}. == Statements == If all value measures V_i are countably-additive and nonatomic, then: * \\mathbb{M} is a compact set; * \\mathbb{M} is a convex set. This was already proved by Dvoretzky, Wald, and Wolfowitz. == Corollaries == === Consensus partition === A cake partition X to k pieces is called a consensus partition with weights w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_k (also called exact division) if: :\\forall i \\in \\\\{1,\\dots, n\\\\}: \\forall j \\in \\\\{1,\\dots, k\\\\}: V_i(X_j) = w_j I.e, there is a consensus among all partners that the value of piece j is exactly w_j. Suppose, from now on, that w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_k are weights whose sum is 1: :\\sum_{j=1}^k w_j =1 and the value measures are normalized such that each partner values the entire cake as exactly 1: :\\forall i \\in \\\\{1,\\dots, n\\\\}: V_i(U) = 1 The convexity part of the DS theorem implies that: :::If all value measures are countably-additive and nonatomic, :::then a consensus partition exists. PROOF: For every j \\in \\\\{1,\\dots, k\\\\}, define a partition X^j as follows: :X^j_j = U :\\forall r eq j: X^j_r = \\emptyset In the partition X^j, all partners value the j-th piece as 1 and all other pieces as 0. Hence, in the matrix M_{X^j}, there are ones on the j-th column and zeros everywhere else. By convexity, there is a partition X such that: :M_X = \\sum_{j=1}^k w_j\\cdot M_{X^j} In that matrix, the j-th column contains only the value w_j. This means that, in the partition X, all partners value the j-th piece as exactly w_j. Note: this corollary confirms a previous assertion by Hugo Steinhaus. It also gives an affirmative answer to the problem of the Nile provided that there are only a finite number of flood heights. === Super- proportional division === A cake partition X to n pieces (one piece per partner) is called a super-proportional division with weights w_1, w_2, ..., w_n if: :\\forall i \\in 1\\dots n: V_i(X_i) > w_i I.e, the piece allotted to partner i is strictly more valuable for him than what he deserves. The following statement is Dubins-Spanier Theorem on the existence of super- proportional division The hypothesis that the value measures V_1, ..., V_n are not identical is necessary. Otherwise, the sum \\sum_{i=1}^n V_i(X_i) =\\sum_{i=1}^n V_1(X_i) > \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i =1 leads to a contradiction. Namely, if all value measures are countably-additive and non-atomic, and if there are two partners i,j such that V_i eq V_j, then a super-proportional division exists.I.e, the necessary condition is also sufficient. == Sketch of Proof == Suppose w.l.o.g. that V_1 eq V_2. Then there is some piece of the cake, Z\\subseteq U, such that V_1(Z)>V_2(Z). Let \\overline{Z} be the complement of Z; then V_2(\\overline{Z})>V_1(\\overline{Z}). This means that V_1(Z) + V_2(\\overline{Z}) > 1. However, w_1+w_2\\leq 1. Hence, either V_1(Z)>w_1 or V_2(\\overline{Z})>w_2. Suppose w.l.o.g. that V_1(Z)>V_2(Z) and V_1(Z)>w_1 are true. Define the following partitions: * X^1: the partition that gives Z to partner 1, \\overline{Z} to partner 2, and nothing to all others. * X^i (for i\\geq 2): the partition that gives the entire cake to partner i and nothing to all others. Here, we are interested only in the diagonals of the matrices M_{X^j}, which represent the valuations of the partners to their own pieces: * In \\textrm{diag}(M_{X^1}), entry 1 is V_1(Z), entry 2 is V_2(\\overline{Z}), and the other entries are 0. * In \\textrm{diag}(M_{X^i}) (for i\\geq 2), entry i is 1 and the other entires are 0. By convexity, for every set of weights z_1, z_2, ..., z_n there is a partition X such that: :M_X = \\sum_{j=1}^n {z_j\\cdot M_{X^j}}. It is possible to select the weights z_i such that, in the diagonal of M_X, the entries are in the same ratios as the weights w_i. Since we assumed that V_1(Z)>w_1, it is possible to prove that \\forall i \\in 1\\dots n: V_i(X_i) > w_i, so X is a super-proportional division. === Utilitarian- optimal division === A cake partition X to n pieces (one piece per partner) is called utilitarian-optimal if it maximizes the sum of values. I.e, it maximizes: :\\sum_{i=1}^n{V_i(X_i)} Utilitarian-optimal divisions do not always exist. For example, suppose U is the set of positive integers. There are two partners. Both value the entire set U as 1. Partner 1 assigns a positive value to every integer and partner 2 assigns zero value to every finite subset. From a utilitarian point of view, it is best to give partner 1 a large finite subset and give the remainder to partner 2. When the set given to partner 1 becomes larger and larger, the sum-of-values becomes closer and closer to 2, but it never approaches 2. So there is no utilitarian-optimal division. The problem with the above example is that the value measure of partner 2 is finitely-additive but not countably-additive. The compactness part of the DS theorem immediately implies that: :::If all value measures are countably- additive and nonatomic, :::then a utilitarian-optimal division exists. In this special case, non-atomicity is not required: if all value measures are countably-additive, then a utilitarian-optimal partition exists. === Leximin- optimal division === A cake partition X to n pieces (one piece per partner) is called leximin-optimal with weights w_1, w_2, ..., w_n if it maximizes the lexicographically-ordered vector of relative values. I.e, it maximizes the following vector: :{V_1(X_1) \\over w_1}, {V_2(X_2) \\over w_2}, \\dots , {V_n(X_n) \\over w_n} where the partners are indexed such that: :{V_1(X_1) \\over w_1} \\leq {V_2(X_2) \\over w_2} \\leq \\dots \\leq {V_n(X_n) \\over w_n} A leximin-optimal partition maximizes the value of the poorest partner (relative to his weight); subject to that, it maximizes the value of the next-poorest partner (relative to his weight); etc. The compactness part of the DS theorem immediately implies that: :::If all value measures are countably-additive and nonatomic, :::then a leximin-optimal division exists. == Further developments == * The leximin-optimality criterion, introduced by Dubins and Spanier, has been studied extensively later. In particular, in the problem of cake-cutting, it was studied by Marco Dall'Aglio. == See also == * Lyapunov vector-measure theorem * Weller's theorem == References == Category:Fair division Category:Theorems in measure theory ",
