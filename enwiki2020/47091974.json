Painted at the fortress city of Toul (Lorraine) while Gleizes served in the military during the First World War, the paintings abstract circular rhythms and intersecting aslant planes announce the beginning of the second synthetic phase of Cubism.J.

At least eight preparatory sketches, gouaches and watercolors of the work have survived, though Portrait of an Army Doctor is one of the only major oil paintings of the period.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1915, from Le Cubisme en majest\u00e9, Albert Gleizes, exhibition catalogue, Mus\u00e9e Picasso, Barcelona; Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon, 2001 As other wartime works by Gleizes, Portrait of an Army Doctor represents a break from the first phase of Cubism. These wartime works mark \"the beginning of an attempt to preserve specific and individual visual characteristics while experimenting with a radically different compositional treatment in which broad planes, angled from the perimeter, meet circles.\" (Robbins, 1964) Rather than based on the analysis of volumetric objects, the artist strove toward synthesis; something that originated in unity.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century, Yale University Press, 2001, Portrait of an Army Doctor\u2014earlier forming part of the collection of art dealer L\u00e9once RosenbergAm\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant, Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), La peinture moderne, \u00c9ditions G.

The work forms part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Founding Collection.Solomon R. Guggenheim Founding Collection It was gifted to the museum by Solomon Guggenheim in 1937 (the year of the formation of the foundation). The painting is in the permanent collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. ==Description== Golden section, or Section d'Or (yellow lines), quarter grid (grey lines) and principle geometric structure lines (white lines). Portrait of an Army Doctor is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions inscribed Alb. Gleizes, Toul 1914, lower right. An early photograph of the work shows the inscribed date as 1914\u201315. Gleizes's works from this period, just as those of the early 1920s, are \"characterized by dynamic intersections of vertical, diagonal, horizontal and circular movements\", writes art historian Daniel Robbins, \"austere in touch but loaded with energetic pattern.\" Gleizes brings into practice an effect reminiscent of Divisionist theory via the incorporation of colored squares within three sections of the canvas, one of which is composed of alternating pigments of contrasting blues and reds. The use of blue, white and red in the overall composition recall the colors of the French flag. Such a display of patriotism was not uncommon among the Cubists, even leading up to the war. French flags can be seen in the works of Roger de La Fresnaye; Fourteenth of July, 1913-14 (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX),Roger de La Fresnaye, Fourteenth of July, 1913-14 and The Conquest of the Air, 1913 (Museum of Modern Art, New York).Roger de La Fresnaye, The Conquest of the Air, 1913, 235.9 x 195.6 cm, Museum of Modern Art, New York\u00c9chos artistiques de la conqu\u00eate de l\u2019air : Roger de la Fresnay et la modernit\u00e9Eric Hild-Ziem, MoMA, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 The Cubo-Futurist Gino Severini, too, included the French flag in his 1913 painting Train of the Wounded, 1913.Gino Severini, Train of the Wounded, 1913, includes the French flag While not depicting the flag itself, wartime works by Jean Metzinger dominantly exhibit blues and reds, along with army green, in such works as Soldat jouant aux \u00e9checs (Soldier at a Game of Chess), 1914\u201315, Smart Museum of Art, and Femme au miroir (Lady at her Dressing Table), April 1916. Albert Gleizes, 1915, Retour de Bois-le-Pr\u00eatre, wood engraving, 39 x 50 cm, published in Le mot, n. 20, 1 July 1915 In 1915 Gleizes published an article in Jean Cocteau's patriotic review, Le Mot in which he attacks critics who accuse the new tendencies in art of being unpatriotic. The final issue of Le Mot includes a sketch by Gleizes based on wounded soldiers returning from a battle at Bois le Pr\u00eatre.C\u2019est en allant se jeter \u00e0 la mer que le fleuve reste fid\u00e8le \u00e0 sa source, Le Mot, Paris, vol. I, no. 17, 1 Mai 1915Le Mot, n. 20, 1 July 1915, in Gallica, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France Despite its descriptive title, the subject matter of Portrait of an Army Doctor has practically disappeared. The canvas is no longer analyzed or structured geometrically according to the golden ratio, though the armrest of the chair is treated as the beginning of a Fibonacci spiral. The masses of the composition are arranged in quasi- equilibrium. The center of the sitter face is the superior vertex of a triangular construct that extends toward the outer edges of the canvas. The intersection of the two arcs that compose the shoulders is centered on the vertical axis. The source of light is undetermined, or omnidirectional, just as the vantage point of the artist, in accord with the Cubist principle of 'simultaneity' (or multiple perspective): \"a succession of descriptive aspects of the external world... by giving a multiple series of appearances, each one seen in its own perspective\", writes Gleizes, \"a succession of descriptive states. Waking up, this eye lurched from one point of view to the other, jumped back again, and was again thrown into a state of excitement.\"Albert Gleizes, Painting and Representational Perspective, Lecture dated Paris, 22 March 1927, given in the Carnegie Foundation for the French Intellectual Union and published by \u00c9ditions Moly Sabata 1927. Republished in Puissances du Cubisme, Eds Pr\u00e9sence, Chambery, 1969. Translation Peter Brooke Cubism, with its new geometry, its dynamism and multiple view-point perspective, not only represented a departure from Euclid's model, but it achieved, according to Gleizes and Metzinger, a better representation of the real world: one that was mobile and changing in time. For Gleizes, Cubism represented a \"normal evolution of an art that was mobile like life itself\".

(Gleizes, 1927) While depth perception and perspective have been subdued to a large extent, the primary structural lines appear to recede or converge toward a multitude of vanishing points located at infinity. Though, unlike those of classical perspective, these vanishing points are not placed on a given horizon (a theoretical line that represents the eye level of the observer), nor do they allow the viewer to reconstruct the relative distance of parts or features of an object. Rather, they are placed on various horizons. The viewer is observing a non-linear scene where the picture plane is not parallel to any of the scene's multiple axes, giving the appearance of different forms of calculated perspective. Surfaces appear to overlap creating a sense of occlusion, but the resulting information is insufficient to allow the observer to recreate depth of field. By removing these optical cues, the geometrical method of perspective used to create the illusion of form, space and depth since the Renaissance, the artifice of an illusionistic trickery as Metzinger called it,Jean Metzinger, Le Cubisme \u00e9tait N\u00e9: Souvenirs par Jean Metzinger (Cubism was Born), Pr\u00e9sence, Chamb\u00e9ry, 1972. (This text written by Jean Metzinger was supplied to the publisher Henri Viaud by Metzinger's widow Suzanne Phocas). Translation Peter Brooke Gleizes's aim was to arrive at what he perceived as 'truth', the constructive essence of the physical world. > So, now that we are in possession of the means (and I firmly believe that we > are) we must pitilessly reject the image of the Renaissance that is > addressed exclusively to the senses, but, at the same time, we should not > fear, should the occasion present itself, an image determined by geometry, > by the square, the right angle, because it, in its nature, corresponds to > the higher stages.

A beauty achieved through a > mathematical order can only have a relative life; the universal kaleidoscope > cannot be fitted into the framework of a system...\" (Gleizes, c.1916, letter > addressed to ) From 1914 to the end of Gleizes's New York period\u2014however nonrepresentational\u2014works by the artist continued to be shaped by his personal experience, by the conviction that art was a social function, susceptible to theoretical formulation, and imbued with optimism. Gleizes's nonrepresentational paintings and those with an apparent visual basis existed side by side, differing only, writes Daniel Robbins, in \"the degree of abstraction hidden by the uniformity with which they were painted and by the constant effort to tie the plastic realization of the painting to a specific, even unique, experience.\" ==Background== Jean Metzinger, 1914\u201315, Soldat jouant aux \u00e9checs (Soldier at a Game of Chess), oil on canvas, 81.3 x 61 cm, Smart Museum of Art Many of the leading Cubists were mobilized at the outset of the First World War: Georges Braque, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Duchamp-Villon, Roger de La Fresnaye, and Jean Metzinger,Christopher Green, Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215 yet despite the radical interruption, they were able to continue producing styles of Cubism that extended beyond pre-war attitudes. Cubism evolved as a result of both nationalistic pressures and from the evasion of the atrocities of war. There came the need to diverge further away from the representation of things. As the divide between art and life grew, the need for a process of distillation (a process of purification) became increasingly ubiquitous across the spectrum of Cubist activity. Orderly qualities and autonomous purity became a prime concern.Christopher Green, Late Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 This tendency toward wholesale geometric abstraction from 1914 through the mid-1920s has been linked to broader ideological shift towards conservatism in both French society and culture. Metzinger served very close to the front during World War I, as a medical aide, and was possibly with his surgical automobile when he painted Soldier at a Game of ChessThe Art of JAMA: Covers and Essays from The Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 3, M. Therese Southgate, Oxford University Press, Mar 17, 2011 (though evidence suggests the work may have been painted prior to his mobilization).Correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre L\u00e9once Rosenberg et Jean Metzinger, 25 May 1916, Biblioth\u00e8que Kandinsky, Centre de documentation et de recherche du MNAM/Cci, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (Metzinger mentions the paintings as titled Joueur d'\u00e9checs) However, very few of his works represent scenes associated with war. And rather than delving into the actual carnage of war, this painting evokes an idealized theory of war. Instead, his interest is captured by mathematical rationality, order, his faith in humanity and modernity. The war, however, is very present in this work, by the presence of the soldier and his engagement with chess, simultaneously an intellectual game and a battle. Fernand L\u00e9ger, 1916, Soldier with a pipe (Le Soldat \u00e0 la Pipe), oil on canvas, 130 x 97 cm, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D\u00f9sseldorf This period of profound reflection contributed to the constitution of a new mindset; a prerequisite for fundamental change. The flat surface became the starting point for a revaluation of the fundamental principles of painting. Rather than relying strictly on the intellect, the focus placed on the immediate experience of the senses, on the idea according to Gleizes, that form, 'changing the directions of its movement, will change its dimensions', while revealing the \"basic elements\" of painting, the \"true, solid rules - rules which could be generally applied\".Albert Gleizes, L'Epop\u00e9e, written in 1925, published in Le Rouge et le Noir, 1929. First published under the title Kubismus, 1928. English translation, The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form by Peter Brooke Fernand L\u00e9ger was mobilized in October 1914, and served as a sapper close to the front in Forest of Argonne. He drew the various activities of his comrades during his free time, with virtually no possibility of working on canvas. Between the autumn of 1914 and 1917 he was able to produce only one work on canvas, Soldier with a pipe (Le Soldat \u00e0 la Pipe).Carolyn Lanchner, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Jodi Hauptman, Matthew Affron, Fernand L\u00e9ger: Exhibition, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, February 15-May 12, 1998, The Museum of Modern Art, 1998], Unlike the \"Impressionism of form\" and dissection of the subject by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Gleizes attempted to create a synthetic art that incorporated social values. He strove to capture the absolute 'order' and 'truth' of his subject, believing in the Universality and superiority of rhythmic harmonies over subjective responses. These values had preoccupied the artist since his years at the Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil, a self-supporting collective of artists and writers he co-founded during the fall of 1906 with Alexandre Mercereau, Ren\u00e9 Arcos, Henri-Martin Barzun, and Charles Vildrac.Barzun, Henri-Martin, L'Ere du Drame, Essai de Synth\u00e8se Po\u00e9tique Moderne, Figui\u00e8re, 1912 ===Mobilization=== Toul, Caserne Mar\u00e9chal Ney, c. 1915, where Gleizes was stationed during his mobilization Gleizes had been conscripted at the outset of the war (August 1914) and sent to the garrison town of Toul, close to the Eastern front (120 km from Sainte- Menehould, where his close friend Jean Metzinger was mobilized) to serve in the 167e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie (from which the 367e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie was formed). He was stationed in the Caserne Mar\u00e9chal-Ney (Plateau Saint-Georges), attached to the Service de Sant\u00e9 des Arm\u00e9es, in the infirmary of the unit.Christian Briend, Revue des Mus\u00e9es de France, N\u00b0 4, 2008 Upon giving his name to the receiving sergeant he was asked if he had any relation to the Cubist painter. When Gleizes answered that he was the Cubist painter he was told to step aside. Sergeant (soon to become a well-known paleontologist) happened to be an avid enthusiast of modern art. Shortly thereafter Gleizes was assigned the role of providing entertainment for the troops. His experience with artistic and literary activities at the Abbey of Cr\u00e9teil and the Association Ernest Renan, along with his connection to the distinguished author and actor Maxime L\u00e9ry, may have helped secure the post. His close associates at the garrison included Carlos Salzedo, a harpist responsible for musical activities; the dentist Th\u00e9o Morinaud, and early childhood friend from Courbevoie and possibly the subject of several pairings by Gleizes, including l'Homme au Balcon (Man on a Balcony), Philadelphia Museum of Art. Also stationed at Toul were the painters Georges Valmier, Paul Colin, and the composer Florent Schmitt. Gleizes activities as artistic and literary impresario at the fortress included monologues reciting classical, romantic and Symbolist poetry by Paul Fort, Jules Laforgue, Tristan Corbi\u00e8re, Arthur Rimbaud and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9.

Guggenheim Museum Gleizes' mobilization was an obstacle to his production of artwork, though he was able to work on small scale, and ultimately produced one relatively large piece, Portrait of an Army Doctor. > The painter Gleizes, who wrote a book on Cubism, writes to a friend: \"From > Toul, advanced outpost on the Eastern border, I am sending you this card. > There is no question of Cubism at the moment or simultanism. When will we > speak of it again? When will we do it again? Soon I hope, and with the glory > of having crushed the German felony, having extirpated the Prussian Hydra > and to be able to return freely in French Alsace-Lorraine forever. I have > absolute confidence in your effort, your mission.\" (Gleizes, > L'Intransigeant, August 1914)L'Intransigeant, Nos Echos, La Bo\u00eete aux > lettres, 31 August 1914, p. 2, National Library of France An admirer of his work, his commanding officer\u2014the regimental surgeon portrayed by Gleizes in this painting\u2014made arrangements so that Gleizes could continue to paint while mobilized at Toul. This work, painted at the outset of the Crystal Cubist period, was a precursor to Gleizes's abstract paintings of 1915\u201316. Portrait of an Army Doctor consists of broad, overlapping planes of brilliant color, dynamically intersecting vertical, diagonal, horizontal lines coupled with circular movements. This painting, along with his Portrait de Florent Schmitt, Le Chant de guerre (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum), according to Gleizes, represented a break from both 'Cubism of analysis', and from the representation of volume undertaken during the first period of Cubism. He was now on a path that lead to 'synthesis', with its starting point in 'unity'.Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914, La guerre, Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957, p. 15. Reprinted, Ampuis, 1997, written during the First World War This unity, and the highly crystalline geometricized materialization consisting of superimposed constituent planes, ultimately referred to by the French poet and art critic Maurice Raynal as Crystal Cubism, would soon be described by Gleizes in La Peinture et ses lois (1922\u201323), as 'simultaneous movements of translation and rotation of the plane'.Peter Brooke, Painting and Its Laws, Albert Gleizes, La peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du Cubisme, Paris 1924 The synthetic factor was taken furthest of all from within the Cubists by Gleizes. Basing himself on his 1915 abstractions, Gleizes sought to clarify his methods further in La Peinture et ses lois, deducing the fundamental principles of painting from the picture plane, its proportions, the movement of the human eye and the universal physical laws. These theoretical postulates, later referred to as translation-rotation, according to Robbins, rank \"with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms\". Many drawings, gouaches and watercolors were realized by the artist in and around Toul. He kept the landscapes and portrait sketches in a drawer, until one day they were discover by a private (a miner) who removed them all only to tack them on the wall with toothpicks for an exhibition. Gleizes remarked that educated or cultured soldiers had more difficulty with his paintings than those with little or no intellectual pretensions. Portrait d'un m\u00e9decin militaire generated mixed responses. The Professor of Physiology from the Faculty of Nancy in charge of the infirmary at Toul, Dr. Lambert, was more enthusiastic about his portrait by Valmier than that of Gleizes: > The portrait that he [Valmier] made of the Doctor was excellent, a very good > likeness that remained in the classical idiom. But for myself, I wanted to > remain faithful to Cubism and not to play games with my own convictions. So > the portrait I envisaged was a little surprising for the good doctor's > habits of mind. He did not conceal his way of thinking, but he let me do > what I wanted. I made of him, from memory, a large number of drawings in > pencil, in pen and ink, in ink wash. I made a series of watercolors and > gouaches. When he saw them, the model was pretty shaken. When my studies > seemed to be ready, I did the oil painting. I painted the portrait in the > Marshall Ney's room. I nailed a canvas I had ordered from Nancy to the wall > and got down to work. When it was finished, it received the approval of my > friends, the unsophisticated ones, who were all able to recognise Dr. > Lambert perfectly well. The others were divided. As for the interested > party, he refused, definitely, but amicably, to take possession of it. To > please me, he only accepted the final little gouache which I had used for > the execution of the canvas.

Together with the second Portrait of Florent Schmitt (the Chant de guerre), it could be described as the furthest point reached by this Cubism striving towards the laws of the 'object'\u2014the properties of the picture space itself\u2014but still taking the 'subject'\u2014the thing represented\u2014as its starting point.\" (Brooke, 2001, p. 46) Shortly thereafter, Jean Cocteau asked Gleizes to design the set and costumes for the William Shakespeare play, A Midsummer Night's Dream, along with Valmier. ===Demobilization=== Albert Gleizes, Portrait d'un m\u00e9decin militaire reproduced on the cover of the Gleizes catalogue raisonn\u00e9, Vol. 1, Somogy, 1998, Paris Gleizes was demobilized, with the help of his soon to be wife Juliette Roche, in September 1915. Gleizes published an article in Ricciotto Canudo's Montjoie entitled Cubisme et la tradition. It was through the intermediary of Cuando that Gleizes met the artist Juliette Roche. She was a childhood friend of Jean Cocteau and the daughter of an influential politician of the 3rd Republic, Jules Roche.Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie During the months of autumn, following his demobilization in 1915, Gleizes married Juliette Roche and moved to New York. There they were met by Carlos Salzedo, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, and Jean Crotti (who would eventually marry Suzanne Duchamp). Marcel Duchamp had emigrated to New York several months earlier after being judged physically unfit for his service in the military. Shortly after his arrival, Gleizes, accompanied by Salzedo, frequented jazz clubs in Harlem. With all it had to offer, New York had a strong impact on the artist's production, leading to abstract works virtually free of visual subject matter. Many works by Gleizes painted at Toul between 1914 and 1915 were auctioned in New York, for the occasion of the late John Quinn exhibition and sale of modern and ultra-modern art at the American Art Galleries, conducted by Bernet and Parke, with a catalogue published by American Art Association, New York, 1927.Paintings and sculptures, The renowned collection of modern and ultra-modern art formed by the late John Quinn ==Recent exhibitions== Le cubisme, 17 October 2018 to 25 February 2019, Centre Pompidou, the first large-scale exhibition devoted to Cubism in France since 1973, with over 300 works on display.
