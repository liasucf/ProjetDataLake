    "text": "is a racing video game released for the Master System in 1986. During the course of the game, the player uses a Formula One style car. The player has to drive the car as quickly as possible while navigating through turns and other vehicles on the road. A formal scoring system is not used; players are not ranked by position unlike most racing games. This kind of timekeeping would not be used in a subsequent video game until the release of the Taito Grand Prix: Eik\u014d e no License on the Family Computer the following year. ==Gameplay== The absence of an authentic Formula One license made it difficult to research the actual Formula One machines of that time; players had to use generic two speed manual transmission machines. While using the regular tracks, the player must either match or beat the target time in order to move to the next level. Otherwise, a game over message will appear without revealing the final score of the game. Getting lower than the target time will score points that will lead to upgrades for his or her vehicle. All races are one lap only regardless of whether the track was custom built or previously designed. The gameplay is very similar to the Family Computer version of F1 Race and also Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a \"LOW\" setting and a \"HI\" setting). ==External links== * * Category:1986 video games Category:Formula One video games Category:Sega video games Category:Master System games Category:Master System- only games Category:Video games developed in Japan ",
