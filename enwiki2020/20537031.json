    "text": "Ignotum per ignotius (Latin for \"the unknown by the more unknown\") describes an explanation that is less familiar than the concept it would explain. An example would be: \"The oven felt hot because of Fourier's Law.\" It is unlikely that a person unfamiliar with the hotness of ovens would be enlightened by a reference to a fundamental law of physics. Of course, such a person might exist in theory, so ignotum per ignotius is not strictly a logical fallacy; it is just a criticism of an argument on rhetorical grounds, stating that such an argument is not useful in a particular context. ==Ignotum per \u00e6que ignotum== Ignotum per \u00e6que ignotum, meaning \"the unknown by the equally unknown\", is a related form of fallacy in which one attempts to prove something unknown by deducing it from something else that is also not known to be true.Galileo, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Day 2. == See also == * List of Latin phrases ==References== Category:Latin logical phrases Category:Philosophical arguments Category:Ignorance ",
