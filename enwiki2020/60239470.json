    "text": "Apollo LTD is a pop-rock duo from Nashville, Tennessee consisting of Jordan Phillips and Adam Stark. The band is signed to Residence Music, an imprint of Centricity Music. == History == The two met in 2004 when they were paired as roommates at Nashville's Belmont University. They began writing and playing music while juggling assorted jobs including landscaping, swim coaching, and substitute teaching in the inner city school system. Apollo LTD's name was originally inspired by NASA. Phillips' uncle was an astronaut in the '90s which lead to a fascination that still exists to this day. The Apollo program was birthed out of a desire to do something the United States had never done before as a country. When they started the band, the duo wanted to make music that they hadn't ever made prior. \"It was our version of going to the moon in a tin can\", Phillips explained. Apollo LTD released their independent self- titled EP in 2015. It garnered critical acclaim from the likes of Consequence of Sound and The Atlantic and has received sync placements on Comedy Central, ESPN, FOX Sports, NBC, ABC, and more. In August 2017, the band signed with Residence Music and released their first single \"One in a Million\". The track was later included on their 2018 Out of Body EP. Following the release of the EP, Apollo LTD released several additional singles in 2018 including \"Gold\", \"One in a Million (DENM Remix)\", and \"On the Way Up\". The band released their singles \"Heaven (All Around You)\" and \"DNA\" in early 2019. == Band members == Current members * Jordan Phillips * Adam Stark == Discography == Albums * Out of Body (2019) Extended plays * Apollo LTD (2015) * Out of Body (2018) Singles {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=text-align:center; |+ List of singles, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Christ. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Christ.
