    "text": "O\u011fuz is a common masculine Turkish given name. There are various theories on the meaning of \"O\u011fuz\". The most prominent explanation is that it is composed of \"ok\" and \"z\". In (modern) Turkish and proto Turkish \"ok\" means \"arrow\". Only in proto Turkish, \"ok\" also means \"clan\", and/or \"nation\". Again, only in proto Turkish, \"z\" is the plural suffix. In modern Turkish \"z\" is not the plural suffix anymore. Actually, it is not a suffix, in general, in modern Turkish. Therefore \"okz\" means \"clans\", \"nations\", and/or \"arrows\". Finally, \"O\u011fuz\" is used both as given names and as names of some of the Turkish clans. O\u011fuz T\u00fcrks are the southwestern branch of Turkish clan system. \"G\u00f6ko\u011fuz\" was a group of O\u011fuz T\u00fcrks who migrated to northwest and named as Gagauz in modern times. There are also groups named as \u00dc\u00e7o\u011fuz (Three O\u011fuz), Sekizo\u011fuz (Eight O\u011fuz), Dokuzo\u011fuz (Nine O\u011fuz), etc. One of the earliest rulers of the Turkic people is also named az \"Oghuz Khan\". As a given name \"O\u011fuz\" used in memory of and connotes Oghuz Khan. ==Given name== * O\u011fuz Han Aynao\u011flu, Turkish-Danish footballer * Muhammet O\u01e7uz Zengin, Turkish curler * O\u011fuz Atay (1934\u20131977), pioneer of the modern novel in Turkey * O\u011fuz Da\u011flaro\u011flu (born 1979), Turkish footballer * O\u011fuz Sava\u015f (born 1987), Turkish basketball player * O\u011fuz Tansel (1915\u20131994), Turkish poet and folklorist * O\u011fuz Tezmen, Turkish politician * O\u011fuz Y\u0131lmaz (born 1968), folk musician in Turkey * Oghuz Khan, legendary khan of Turks, considered to be the ancestor of all Turks ==Surname== * Cande\u011fer K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7er O\u011fuz (born 1980), Turkish female high jumper * Abdullah O\u011fuz (born 1958), Turkish director * Cemal O\u011fuz, Turkish judoka * Talat O\u011fuz, Turkish politician, member of national parliament * Orhan O\u011fuz, Turkish politician, member of national parliament * Ilhan O\u011fuz, Turkish Bureaucrat * Cemal O\u011fuz, Turkish Biologist Prof. Category:Turkish-language surnames Category:Turkish masculine given names ",
