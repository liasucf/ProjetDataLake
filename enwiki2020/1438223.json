    "text": "Moondog Matinee is the fifth studio album by Canadian/American rock group the Band, released in 1973. It consists entirely of cover material reflecting the group's love of R&B; and blues music, with one exception in their interpretation of the theme from the film The Third Man. In a 2002 interview, Levon Helm described the reasoning for recording an album of covers: \"That was all we could do at the time. We couldn't get along\u2014we all knew that fairness was a bunch of shit. We all knew we were getting screwed, so we couldn't sit down and create no more music. 'Up on Cripple Creek' and all that stuff was over\u2014all that collaboration was over, and that type of song was all we could do.\"Lopate, Mitch. \"He Shall Be Levon...: The Band's Levon Helm Is Rocking Harder Than Ever With The Barnburners\", GRITZ magazine, Fall 2002. The original idea had been to replicate the group's setlists of the mid-'60s when they had been known as Levon and the Hawks, playing clubs throughout Canada and the US. Of the ten tracks, only one, \"Share Your Love (With Me)\" had been performed by the group in the mid-'60s. The rest were merely tracks the group admired, two of them, \"Holy Cow\" and \"A Change Is Gonna Come\", chronologically coming after the group's club days. Rhapsody praised the album, calling it one of its favorite cover albums.Rhapsody\u2019s Favorite Covers Albums retrieved 01-08-10 . ==Track listing== ===Side one=== ===Side two=== * Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u201310 on CD reissues. ===2001 reissue bonus tracks=== ==Personnel== ;The Band *Rick Danko \u2013 bass guitar, acoustic guitar, vocals *Levon Helm \u2013 drums, electric guitar, bass guitar, double bass, vocals *Garth Hudson \u2013 organ, piano, accordion, synthesizer, clavinet, tenor saxophone *Richard Manuel \u2013 acoustic and electric piano, drums, vocals *Robbie Robertson \u2013 electric and acoustic guitars ;Additional personnel *Billy Mundi \u2013 drums (brushes) on \"Mystery Train\"http://theband.hiof.no/albums/moondog_matinee.html *Ben Keith \u2013 pedal steel guitar on \"The Promised Land\" ;Technical *Mark Harman \u2013 engineer *Jay Ranellucci \u2013 engineer *John Wilson \u2013 engineer *Edward Kasper \u2013 artwork ==References== Category:1973 albums Category:The Band albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Covers albums Category:Albums produced by Garth Hudson Category:Albums produced by Levon Helm Category:Albums produced by Richard Manuel Category:Albums produced by Rick Danko Category:Albums produced by Robbie Robertson Category:Albums recorded at Capitol Studios ",
