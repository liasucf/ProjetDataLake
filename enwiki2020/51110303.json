Over the years, with her experience and creativity, she has been able to give it a unique footprint of her own, which has been recognized by the dance fraternity and the art connoisseurs in her performances and that of her students. As a venerated Guru, Dr Vasundhara has been successful in generating (three generations) disciples who have imbibed her every move, look (Drishti) & nuances needed etc. in the way they perform. What inspired Dr Vasundhara to experiment with the boundaries of the classical dance of Bharatanatyam was supposed to have been her strong footing in Yoga and experience of martial arts. Her use of singular hastas, alluring gaits, abhinaya which can communicate easily with the common man, modifications of the adavus, aharya, inimitable feather-touch footwork, all within the traditional framework, have led to a unique footprint that is today identified and recognized as \"Vasundhara Style\". == References == Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Indian female classical dancers Category:Performers of Indian classical dance Category:People from Dakshina Kannada district Category:Women artists from Karnataka Category:Dancers from Karnataka Category:20th-century Indian women artists Category:20th-century Indian dancers ",
