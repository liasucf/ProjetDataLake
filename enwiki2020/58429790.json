    "text": "The 2018 Alabama House of Representatives elections were held on November 6, 2018, as part of the biennial United States elections. All 105 of Alabama's state representatives were up for reelection. In Alabama, members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate serve four year terms, running in years corresponding with presidential midterm elections. The Republican Party picked up five seats in the chamber, despite national success for the Democratic Party throughout the United States. Several factors contributed to this. For one, four of the gains made by Republicans were in rural districts with longtime incumbents who chose to retire in 2018 rather than run for reelection. A lack of strong incumbents allowed the Republicans, whose support among rural whites has greatly strengthened in Alabama since the 1990s, to pick up most of these seats with relative ease. Additionally, the Alabama Democratic Party was heavily disorganized and internally divided, leaving many candidates in competitive districts to run without a meaningful party apparatus behind them. President Donald Trump's popularity in the state (which he won by 28 points in 2016) likely also contributed to increased enthusiasm among Republicans. While Democrats did increase their share of the popular vote from 2014, it was more a function of several Democratic-seats being left uncontested than an increase in statewide support. The results were a major disappointment for Democrats, who less than a year earlier had won a fiercely fought U.S. Senate race in Alabama. As a result of these defeats the state party began a period of reform, with State Representative Christopher J. England replacing Nancy Worley as chair of the party. The results also highlighted the dramatic racial divide among Alabama's political parties\u2014after this election, only one Democratic representative (Neil Rafferty) in the chamber was white, while no Republican representatives were black. ==Election results== Before the election, Republicans already held 72-33 supermajority over the Democrats. After the election, Republicans increased it to a margin of 77-28. ===District 1=== ===District 2=== ===District 3=== ===District 4=== ===District 5=== ===District 6=== ===District 7=== ===District 8=== ===District 9=== ===District 10=== ===District 11=== ===District 12=== ===District 13=== ===District 14=== ===District 15=== ===District 16=== ===District 17=== ===District 18=== ===District 19=== ===District 20=== ===District 21=== ===District 22=== ===District 23=== ===District 24=== ===District 25=== ===District 26=== ===District 27=== ===District 28=== ===District 29=== ===District 30=== ===District 31=== ===District 32=== ===District 33=== ===District 34=== ===District 35=== ===District 36=== ===District 37=== ===District 38=== ===District 39=== ===District 40=== ===District 41=== ===District 42=== ===District 43=== ===District 44=== ===District 45=== ===District 46=== ===District 47=== ===District 48=== ===District 49=== ===District 50=== ===District 51=== ===District 52=== ===District 53=== ===District 54=== ===District 55=== ===District 56=== ===District 57=== ===District 58=== ===District 59=== ===District 60=== ===District 61=== ===District 62=== ===District 63=== ===District 64=== ===District 65=== ===District 66=== ===District 67=== ===District 68=== ===District 69=== ===District 70=== ===District 71=== ===District 72=== ===District 73=== ===District 74=== ===District 75=== ===District 76=== ===District 77=== ===District 78=== ===District 79=== ===District 80=== ===District 81=== ===District 82=== ===District 83=== ===District 84=== ===District 85=== ===District 86=== ===District 87=== ===District 88=== ===District 89=== ===District 90=== ===District 91=== ===District 92=== ===District 93=== ===District 94=== ===District 95=== ===District 96=== ===District 97=== ===District 98=== ===District 99=== ===District 100=== ===District 101=== ===District 102=== ===District 103=== ===District 104=== ===District 105=== ==See also== *2010 Alabama State House of Representatives election *2018 United States elections *2018 United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama *2018 Alabama gubernatorial election *Alabama lieutenant gubernatorial election, 2018 *Alabama Attorney General election, 2018 *Alabama State Treasurer election, 2018 *Alabama State Auditor election, 2018 *Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries election, 2018 *Alabama Public Service Commission election, 2018 *Alabama Secretary of State election, 2018 *2018 Alabama State Senate election *2018 Alabama elections *Supreme Court of Alabama elections ==References== House of Representatives 2018 Alabama House of Representatives ",
