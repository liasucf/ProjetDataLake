SH 35 is the longest two-digit state highway at , longer than three single-digit highways (, and ). It is part of the Pacific Coast Highway. ==Route description== The route begins at in Opotiki in the Eastern Bay of Plenty and travels initially north along St John Street before turning sharp east. The road then begins its long route around the coast. After 157 km and at Te Araroa near Hicks Bay the road turns sharply right, although straight traffic may continue on to reach the East Cape. SH 35 continues on, past Ruatoria and then Tolaga Bay, home to New Zealand's longest wharf. 8 km near the end of its route, SH 35 crosses the Turanganui River bridge and reaches Gisborne. SH 35 turns left onto Customhouse Street and then right onto Awapuni Road, the last stretch of road, before meeting back at SH 2 where it terminates. ==History== There have been two notable changes to SH 35. It used to run through Wainui Beach before the construction of the bypass in 1990, and it used to run along Gladstone Road, Gisborne's main street. Since 1997, SH 35 now travels along Customhouse Street and Awapuni Road, diverting heavy traffic from the city centre. ==See also== * List of New Zealand state highways ==References== ==External links== *New Zealand Transport Agency 35 Category:Transport in the Gisborne District Category:Transport in the Bay of Plenty Region ",
