    "text": "Fort Washington State Park is a Pennsylvania state park in Springfield and Whitemarsh Townships, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park is noted for the springtime flowering of dogwood trees, and is popular with families for picnics and hiking. It is approximately north of Philadelphia, from exit 339 of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. ==History== Both Fort Washington State Park and the neighboring town are named for American defenses and encampment established here in 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign of the American Revolutionary War. After Washington's defeat at the Battle of Germantown, his 11,000 troops were encamped in this area from November 11, 1777 to December 11, 1777, after which time they marched to Valley Forge for winter quarters. From December 5\u20138, 1777, the Battle of White Marsh was fought in the immediate vicinity. The park's Fort Hill marks the spot where a temporary fort once stood. The Pennsylvania Militia (under Generals Armstrong, Cadwalader and Irvine) held positions on what is today called Militia Hill. The park was established by Philadelphia's Fairmount Park Commission in the early 1920s. The commission, in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, administered the park until 1953. That year, an act of state legislature transferred responsibility of the park to the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters (known today as the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources). The observation deck at Fort Washington State Park overlooks the Wissahickon Valley, a National Natural Landmark. ==Recreation== Recreational activities at Fort Washington State Park include Disc Golf, fishing, hiking, dog walking, bird and wildlife watching, sledding, cross-country skiing and picnicking. From September 1 to October 31, an organized \"Hawk Watch\" takes place in which viewers can observe all 16 species of raptors that migrate on the East Coast from the park's observation deck. Hunting is prohibited at Fort Washington State Park. ==Nearby state parks== The following state parks are within of Fort Washington State Park: Note: shows Fort Washington State Park *Benjamin Rush State Park (Philadelphia County) *Brandywine Creek State Park (New Castle County, Delaware) *Bull's Island Recreation Area (Hunterdon County, New Jersey) *Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park (Somerset County, New Jersey) *Delaware Canal State Park (Bucks and Northampton Counties) *Evansburg State Park (Montgomery County) *Fox Point State Park (Delaware) *French Creek State Park (Berks and Chester Counties) *Marsh Creek State Park (Chester County) *Neshaminy State Park (Bucks County) *Nockamixon State Park (Bucks County) *Norristown Farm Park (Montgomery County) *Ralph Stover State Park (Bucks County) *Rancocas State Park (Burlington County, New Jersey) *Ridley Creek State Park (Delaware County) *Tyler State Park (Bucks County) *Washington Crossing State Park (Mercer County, New Jersey) ==References== ==External links== * Category:State parks of Pennsylvania Category:Protected areas established in 1953 Category:Parks in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Category:1953 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Protected areas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania ",
