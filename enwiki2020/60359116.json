    "text": "Rolf Christensen (August 4, 1894 \u2013 May 18, 1962) was a Norwegian actor and film director who was particularly well known for his roles in operettas, plays, and farces. Christensen debuted on stage in 1918 at the Trondheim National Theater and was engaged from 1922 to 1935 with the National Theater. He was engaged with the Central Theater from 1935 onward, both as an actor and director. Most of his work, both as an actor and a director, was in operettas, plays, and farces. An exception was his dramatic leading role in Toralf Sand\u00f8's production of Victor Borg's play Jeg drepte! (I Have Killed), which he performed at the Central Theater in 1941 and reprised in the film of the same name a year later. He made his film debut in 1921 with a supporting role in Growth of the Soil, and adaptation of Knut Hamsun's novel of the same name. He played the lead role in the film Jeg drepte! and also had supporting roles in films such as Pan (1922), De vergel\u00f8se (1939), T\u00f8rres Sn\u00f8rtevold (1940), and Kasserer Jensen (1954).
