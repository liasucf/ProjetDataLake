    "text": "thumb The Oshima Peninsula (\u6e21\u5cf6 \u534a\u5cf6 Oshima-hant\u014d) is the southernmost part of Hokkaid\u014d, the northernmost of the Japanese islands. Where the peninsula starts is open to interpretation. A more generous interpretation is to draw a line southeast from Ishikari Bay across the Ishikari Plain to Y\u016bfutsu District, Hokkaido. A narrower interpretation is to draw a line connecting Suttsu on the Sea of Japan and Oshamambe on Uchiura Bay. This narrow interpretation encompasses the subprefectures of Oshima and Hiyama. At its southern end it forks into the southwest-pointing Matsumae Peninsula and the southeast- pointing Kameda Peninsula. These two peninsulas face Tsugaru and Shimokita Peninsulas of Honsh\u016b across the Tsugaru Strait. The \u014cnuma Quasi-National Park is located on the peninsula. The terrain of the peninsula is mountainous, with settlements mostly located in flat, lowland areas. Oshima Peninsula is home to several active volcanoes such as Mount E and Hokkaido Koma-ga-take. The area also contains several onsen hot springs. The peninsula is home to two cities: Hakodate and the smaller adjacent Hokuto, as well as numerous small fishing and agricultural towns. Matsumae Castle, the northernmost castle in Japan and only castle on the island of Hokkaido, is located on the Oshima peninsula. ==References== Category:Peninsulas of Japan Category:Landforms of Hokkaido ",
