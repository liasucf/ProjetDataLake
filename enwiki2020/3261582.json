She is now a news anchor for Wake Up With Al on the Weather Channel, provides news updates for CNBC, and substitute anchors MSNBC Live. She has covered major stories both in the U.S. and internationally, including the 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake, the conflict in Kosovo, the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan and the explosion of a deadly volcano on the island of Montserrat.

(Squawk Box also showed footage of Scarborough theatrically castigating Novotny for her \"traitorous\" behavior.) ==Personal== On the November 21, 2006 edition of Countdown with Keith Olbermann it was announced that she had given birth to a son with her husband Michael Foley, an investment banker whom she wed in May 2004.
