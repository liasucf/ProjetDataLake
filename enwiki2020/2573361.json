It is loosely based on and named after the now defunct WNBC-TV program Live at Five and was suggested as a concept by CHUM Limited Consultant Jacques De Suze.Murphy, Steve. Live at 5: The Story Behind its Success. Halifax: Nimbus Publishing, 2002. p. 16. The program evolved out of its predecessors: I-D or In-Depth, and The Notebook, both of which were also hosted by Live at 5's first host, the late Dave Wright. Live At 5 became part of the first ninety-minute block of news on a local television station in Canada, the first 5:00 p.m. newscast in the country and the first daily, local television newsmagazine in Canadian television history.Murphy, pp. 7, 16. For many years, it was Canada's highest rated local television program based on market share. It remains the most watched television show in the region according to the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement, even ahead of any prime time programming. The program celebrated its 20th anniversary with a Maritime province tour and a book about the show's history, Live at 5: The Story Behind its Success, written by former co-host Steve Murphy, in 2002. On August 13, 2012, the first day after CTV's coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics, the program's name was changed to CTV News at 5. The program's style and content have remained the same, however this marks the first change of its name since the program first aired in September 1982. == Format == After an update and preview of the 6 p.m. newscast, the program starts with First at 5, a series of 3-4 reports centering on a single topic that is frequently influenced by the news of the day. The next segment is usually an interview of a newsmaker, community leader or celebrity, followed by a health or consumer report. The first 30 minutes is rounded out by the Milestones segment, where the hosts read a list of viewers celebrating 50+ year wedding anniversaries or 100th+ birthdays, accompanied by photos. The second half hour starts with a weather forecast, followed by another human interest report and another news update at 5:40. A List, a daily arts and entertainment segment hosted by Ana Almeida, follows the news update. A List is best known for its showcase of funny and bizarre YouTube videos along with the entertainment news of the day. The content of two final segments vary from day to day. A List is the fourth name for the entertainment segment on Live at 5 and replaced Section Six in 2016 and Take 5 in the fall of 2010. ==Regular features== * Flashback Friday - Every Friday, a video from ATV, ASN or CTV Atlantic's past is shown.
