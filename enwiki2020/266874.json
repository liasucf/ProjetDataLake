It was founded in 2010 with assets from the former Gulfstream International Airlines, and currently operates scheduled flights from its hubs in Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and Tampa, and a smaller base in San Juan. Silver Airways received $20,515,042 in annual Federal subsidies for Essential Air Services that it provided to rural airports in the United States. == History == On November 4, 2010, Gulfstream International Airlines filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection. In May 2011, Victory Park Capital bought the assets of Gulfstream International Group, including 21 of Gulfstream's Beechcraft 1900D aircraft from Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation. Saab 340B at Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport On December 15, 2011, the airline was re-branded as Silver Airways. That same day, they took delivery of one of six recently purchased Saab 340B+ aircraft. In the first half of 2012, Silver Airways made several moves to turn the company around. Its maintenance facilities were moved from Fort Lauderdale to Gainesville Regional Airport, taking over the former Eclipse Aviation facility that had remained vacant since 2009. It purchased six more Saab 340B+ aircraft bringing the Saab fleet to 12. Scheduled service on the Saabs started on the Florida and Bahamas routes. Shortly after, routes from Gainesville Regional Airport to Orlando International Airport and Tampa International Airport began. Silver Airways expanded their network numerous times in the second half of 2012. First, Washington Dulles International Airport started scheduled service to destinations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia. Its Florida route network expanded to Jacksonville. Service began from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to destinations in Mississippi and Alabama. On August 7, 2012, Silver Airways made national news headlines when one of its flights landed at the wrong airport. On February 11, 2013, Victory Park Capital announced it had hired industry veteran Dave Pflieger to strengthen and grow the airline. On June 28, 2013, Silver Airways announced that it would cease Montana operations over the next few months. The announcement came on the heels of the Department of Transportation's (DOT) decision to eliminate subsidized service in two key Montana communities, Lewistown and Miles City. Service ended after the last flights on July 15, 2013 for Lewistown and Miles City. To ensure no interruption of service and a smooth transition for the flying public in the remaining Montana markets serviced by Silver Airways, Silver continued its operations in those communities until such time as the DOT awarded the routes to another airline and the new carrier started service to those communities. In September 2013, Silver Airways announced an expansion of its intra-Florida and Florida-Bahamas network. In 2013, Silver Airways was named one of the Top 10 Best U.S. Airlines in the Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler's 26th annual Readers' Choice Awards.

In January 2015, Silver Airways added Panama City, Florida to its list of destinations, by starting services to Orlando and Tampa from the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport. It also announced the launch of a direct service between Jacksonville and Tampa. On February 27, 2015, Silver Airways previewed its new maintenance headquarters at Orlando International Airport. The project is a complete renovation that will be home to a 38,000 square-foot maintenance, repair and overhaul facility that includes two large aircraft hangars each capable of housing three to four aircraft, as well as office space. Silver Airways has committed to a long-term 30-year lease from the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority to headquarter its new maintenance facility in Orlando. In August 2015, Silver Airways ended its Gainesville service, several months after missing and restructuring payments on its Gainesville maintenance hangar. On March 2, 2016, Silver Airways filed an application with the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide service from five Florida cities to ten Cuban cities.
