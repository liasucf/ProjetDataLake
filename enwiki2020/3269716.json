He also appeared frequently on Clyde 1's football show Super ScoreBoard, and Setanta Sports' Press Box. From around 2011 onwards Spiers has appeared in various formats on BBC Radio Scotland. He was brought up as a Rangers fan, but has been a prominent critic of Rangers' leadership and supporters, highlighting many incidents of racism and sectarianism.Brian Viner: Brave prophet spreads the word against Rangers' bile The Independent, 4 August 2007 :::I have always happily ignored one of the traditional and cowardly rules of Scottish sports journalism \u2013 the rule which says, always apportion equal blame to Celtic and Rangers when talking of bigotry \u2013 by pointing a much bigger finger of blame at Rangers, the club I grew up supporting.The Alternative History of Celtic and Rangers. ep2 BBC Scotland, 9 August 2010 In 2007, Random House published his book, L'Enigma \u2013 A Chronicle of Trauma and Turmoil at Rangers () on Paul Le Guen's short tenure as the manager of Rangers.

In January 2016, Spiers, by now a freelance writer, was involved in a dispute with Rangers regarding alleged comments made to him by a Rangers director. The club were demanding an apology from The Herald, for whom Spiers wrote a column, while the writer himself maintained that what he had written was accurate. Although The Herald published an apology for the column, Spiers in turn issued his own statement, defending himself and saying he would not be contributing any more columns to the paper.Graham Spiers, \"The Herald\u2019s Apology to Rangers FC\" 27 January 2016 He joined The Times a month later, though that move had already been agreed before the Herald row.
