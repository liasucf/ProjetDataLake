It was written by all five band members and produced by Roger B\u00e9chirian. The EP reached No. 86 in the UK and remained on the chart for four weeks. In 1991, the song reached No. 12 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. ==Critical reception== Upon release, Penny Kiley of the Liverpool Echo praised the song as being a \"beautifully melodic guitar jangle that lifts the spirits straight away\". She noted Reader's vocals were reminiscent of Roddy Frame, and felt the song musically had \"hints of the Housemartins and a bit of the Smiths\".Liverpool Echo - Penny Kiley's Rock and Pop - New releases: Penny's verdict - 10 February 1990 - page 7 Orange Coast Magazine reviewed Cake and described the song as one of the \"standouts\" on \"this fine debut\". In a retrospective review of Cake, Norm Elrod of AllMusic described the song, along with the album's other singles, as the \"tastiest pieces of pure pop pleasure\". The song was also picked as an AMG Pick Track. In a 1999 review of Cake by CMJ New Music Report, Carlene Bauer commented: \"\"Obscurity Knocks,\" a high-spirited grouse about fickle fame and fleeting youth, is the best - and eeriest - number.\" Colin Larkin, in his 1995 book The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music, described the song as \"plaintive\". ==Track listing== ;7\" EP # \"Obscurity Knocks\" \u2013 3:36 # \"Who's He?\" \u2013 2:58 # \"The Best Man's Fall\" \u2013 3:39 ;12\" EP # \"Obscurity Knocks\" \u2013 3:36 # \"The Best Man's Fall\" \u2013 3:39 # \"Drunken Chorus\" \u2013 4:11 # \"Who's He?\" \u2013 2:58 ;Cassette EP # \"Obscurity Knocks\" \u2013 3:36 # \"Who's He?\" \u2013 2:58 # \"The Best Man's Fall\" \u2013 3:39 ;CD EP # \"Obscurity Knocks\" \u2013 3:36 # \"The Best Man's Fall\" \u2013 3:39 # \"Drunken Chorus\" \u2013 4:11 # \"Who's He?\" \u2013 2:58 ;CD single (US promo) # \"Obscurity Knocks (Edit)\" - 3:35 # \"Obscurity Knocks (Album Version)\" - 4:10 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" !Chart (1990\u201391) !Peak position |- |- |} ==Personnel== ;The Trash Can Sinatras * Frank Reader - vocals, guitar * Paul Livingston - lead guitar * John Douglas - rhythm guitar * George McDaid - bass * Stephen Douglas - drums ;Production * Roger B\u00e9chirian - producer * Peter Rose - assistant producer, engineer * Tony Harris - engineer * John Leckie - mixing on \"Obscurity Knocks\" ;Other * Ben Argueta - design (US release) * Porterhouse Management - management ==References== Category:1990 songs Category:1990 singles Category:London Records EPs Category:Go!
