    "text": "Typhoon Mangkhut, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ompong, was an extremely powerful and catastrophic tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage in Guam, the Philippines and South China in September 2018. It was the strongest typhoon to strike Luzon since Megi in 2010, and the strongest to make landfall anywhere in the Philippines since Haiyan in 2013. Mangkhut was also the strongest typhoon to affect Hong Kong since Ellen in 1983. Mangkhut was the thirty-second tropical depression, twenty-second tropical storm, ninth typhoon, and fourth super typhoon of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season. It made landfall in the Philippine province of Cagayan late on September 14, as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon, and subsequently impacted Hong Kong and southern China. Mangkhut was also the third-strongest tropical cyclone worldwide in 2018. Over the course of its existence, Mangkhut left behind a trail of severe destruction in its wake. The storm caused a total of $3.77 billion (2018 US) in damage across multiple nations, along with at least 134 fatalities: 127 in the Philippines, 6 in mainland China, and 1 in Taiwan. ==Meteorological history== On September 5, 2018, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a tropical disturbance near the International Date Line. Steady development ensued over the following days, and the system organized into a tropical depression on September 6, though operationally, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) did not classify the system as a tropical depression until September 7. The depression soon intensified into a tropical storm, upon which it received the name Mangkhut. Throughout the next two days, the system underwent rapid intensification. Tight banding features wrapped around a developing eye feature. Favorable environmental conditions hastened Mangkhut's development, including low wind shear, ample outflow aloft, high sea surface temperatures, and high ocean heat content. Mangkhut achieved typhoon strength on September 9. A well-defined eye became evident on satellite imagery as the typhoon approached the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam. The JTWC analyzed Mangkhut as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon with one- minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) as it tracked near Rota, around 12:00 UTC on September 10. The JMA assessed the storm's ten-minute sustained winds to be 155 km/h (100 mph) at this time. Typhoon Mangkhut approaching Luzon, Philippines on September 14 Substantial intensification ensued on September 11, as Mangkhut traversed the Philippine Sea. A second bout of rapid intensification took place as the storm consolidated significantly; a well- defined eye became established during this time. The JTWC analyzed Mangkhut to have reached Category 5-equivalent intensity by 06:00 UTC, an intensity it would maintain for nearly four days. The JMA assessed that the typhoon's central pressure bottomed out at 18:00 UTC, with 10-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) and a central minimum pressure of 905 hPa (mbar; 26.73 inHg). The JTWC noted additional strengthening on September 12, and assessed Mangkhut to have reached its peak intensity at 18:00 UTC, with one-minute sustained winds of 285 km/h (180 mph). The typhoon made landfall in Baggao, Cagayan at 2:00 a.m. PST on September 15 (18:00 UTC on September 14), as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon, with 10-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) and 1-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). This made Mangkhut the strongest storm to strike the island of Luzon since Typhoon Megi in 2010, and the strongest nationwide since Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Traversing the mountains of Luzon weakened Mangkhut before it emerged over the South China Sea on September 15. The typhoon subsequently made landfall again on the Taishan coast of Jiangmen, Guangdong, China, at 5 p.m. Beijing Time (09:00 UTC) on September 16, with 2-minute sustained winds of according to China Meteorological Administration. ==Preparations== ===Philippines=== Public Storm Warning Signals raised throughout the Philippines in relation to Mangkhut's passage Tropical cyclone warning signals were hoisted by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration as early as September 13. Preemptive and forced evacuations were implemented, especially in the Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Cordillera administrative regions, the three regions widely expected to be severely affected by Mangkhut (Ompong). School class suspensions were announced as early as September 12 in preparation for the approaching typhoon. Medical and emergency response teams were placed on standby, and worth of relief goods were prepared by 13 September. ====Highest Public Storm Warning Signal==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\" |- !

On September 14, the Hong Kong Government held a rare cross-department press conference over the preparation for Mangkhut, reminding Hong Kong citizens to \"prepare for the worst\". That night, the Hong Kong Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 when Mangkhut was 1110 kilometers away from Hong Kong, the farthest distance on record. On September 15, citizens living in Tai O and Lei Yue Mun were evacuated from these low-lying areas that have historically been very prone to storm surge. Hong Kong Observatory issued Strong Wind Signal No. 3 in the afternoon. On September 16, as Mangkhut maintained its course towards the Pearl River Estuary, Hong Kong Observatory issued Gale or Storm Signal No. 8 during midnight. After dawn, as local winds rapidly strengthened, Hong Kong Observatory issued Increasing Gale or Storm Signal No. 9. At 9:40 a.m., the Hong Kong Observatory issued the Hurricane Signal No. 10, the highest level of tropical cyclone warning signals in Hong Kong. This marked only the third time that this warning has been issued for the region since 1999, the others being with Typhoon Hato in 2017 and Typhoon Vicente in 2012. The signal was held for 10 hours, the second longest duration ever, only behind the 11 hours during Typhoon York in 1999. The typhoon passed 100 kilometers south of Hong Kong at its closest, the joint farthest for a Hurricane Signal No. 10, with Typhoon Vicente. ===Mainland China=== On September 15, the meteorological bureaus of most cities in Guangdong issued red alerts for Typhoon Mangkhut, which is the highest level of alerts in Guangdong. The Guangxi Meteorological Bureau also issued a red alert for the typhoon at 17:00 Beijing Time. On the next day, the Meteorological Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality issued a red alert for rainstorm, which is the highest level of alerts in Shenzhen. The Fujian Meteorological Bureau issued an orange alert for the typhoon, the second highest alert level, on September 15. On September 16, National Meteorological Center of CMA renewed a red alert for Typhoon Mangkhut, which is the highest level of alerts in China. On the same day, the Hainan Meteorological Bureau issued an orange alert for the typhoon. In Guangdong's provincial capital Guangzhou, schools, public transportation, and businesses were closed across the entire city for the first time since 1978. ==Impact== ===Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands=== Sailors remove debris in Guam following Typhoon Mangkhut After the center of Mangkhut passed near Guam, about 80% of the island lost electricity. The typhoon caused $4.3 million in infrastructural damage in Guam. ===Philippines=== Mangkhut making landfall over Luzon on September 14 A tornado was reported in Marikina, eastern Metro Manila, on the night around 5:30pm Philippine Standard Time of September 14 (Friday), injuring two people. Over 105,000 families evacuated from their homes, and several airports in northern Luzon closed and airlines cancelled their flights until September 16. On September 22, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council confirmed that the typhoon had caused at least 127 fatalities; 80 deaths occurred in the collapse of a small mine in the town of Itogon, Benguet, where dozens of landslides buried homes. Philippine police also stated that another 111 people remained missing, as of September 22. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser of President Rodrigo Duterte, announced that an estimated 5.7 million people nationwide had been affected by the storm. Luzon suffered extensive losses which more than doubled the expected worst-case scenario outlined by Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pi\u00f1ol. As of October 5, the NDRRMC estimated that Mangkhut caused PHP33.9 billion (US$626.8 million) in damages in the Philippines, with assessments continuing. === Malaysia === The tail winds from Mangkhut also affected the parts of Malaysia (as well as state of Sabah). ===Taiwan=== A 30-year-old female teacher visiting Fenniaolin Beach in Yilan County was swept out to sea by a wave. Her body was recovered two days later. ===Hong Kong=== Shattered windows at Two Harbourfront in Hung Hom, Hong Kong Mangkhut was the most intense typhoon to strike Hong Kong since Typhoon Ellen in 1983; the highest typhoon warning signal No. 10 remained in place for 10 hours. The typhoon's rainfall and storm surge caused serious flooding, especially in low-lying and coastal areas, while strong winds knocked over more than 47,000 trees, blocking several major roads. An hourly mean wind of 81 km/h and gusts up to 169 km/h were recorded at the Hong Kong Observatory in Tsim Sha Tsui, while on Cheung Chau island these figures reached 157 and 212 km/h respectively. The strongest winds in Hong Kong near sea level were recorded at the remote Waglan Island, with 10-minute sustained winds of 180 km/h gusting up to 220 km/h. These winds caused the territory's many skyscrapers to sway and shattered glass windows; notably, the curtain walls of the Harbour Grand Kowloon were blown out by the winds. A construction elevator shaft on a high-rise under construction in Tai Kok Tsui collapsed onto an adjacent building, which had to be evacuated by police. Many roads were blocked by fallen trees and other debris, including major arteries such as Lockhart Road in Wan Chai and Kam Sheung Road, and service on the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) was halted on all above-ground sections of track. People climb over trees to go to work the morning after Typhoon Mangkhut near Immigration Tower in Wan Chai Serious flooding was reported in many seaside residential areas, including Heng Fa Chuen, Tseung Kwan O South, Shek O, Lei Yue Mun, villages in Tuen Mun, and the fishing village of Tai O, due to a powerful storm surge of up to .

Insurance claims in Hong Kong amounted to HK$7.3 billion (US$930 million). The day after the storm, massive crowds filled the territory's MTR system, which operated at a reduced level of service on some lines as some sections of the tracks had been blocked by debris. Most of the city's 600 bus routes also went out of service due to blocked roads. ===Macau=== The ceiling of the Oriental Pearl Terminal Station waiting area was blown away by strong winds.

Schools in Beihai, Qinzhou, Fangchenggang, and Nanning were closed on September 17. The trains to Guangxi were also closed on September 17. In total, the storm killed 6 people and caused CN\u00a513.68 billion (US$1.99 billion) in damage. ===Retirement=== After the PAGASA retired the name Ompong for causing more than \u20b11 billion in damage. It was replaced with the name Obet. Due to the damage and high death toll in Luzon, the name Mangkhut was officially retired during the 51st annual session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in February 2019. In July 2020, the Typhoon Committee subsequently chose Krathon as its replacement name. ==See also== * Typhoons in the Philippines * Typhoon Wanda (1962) \u2013 Strongest typhoon recorded in Hong Kong * Typhoon Hope (Ising; 1979) \u2013 One of the strongest typhoons that made its final landfall near Hong Kong. * Typhoon Ellen (Herming; 1983) \u2013 A powerful typhoon that took a similar track through the Philippines in September 1983, and one of the strongest typhoon in Hong Kong * Typhoon Zeb (Iliang; 1998) \u2013 An extremely powerful typhoon that made landfall in the same province of the Philippines * Typhoon Megi (Juan; 2010) \u2013 Another powerful typhoon that made landfall in nearby Isabela province and affected South China and Taiwan * Typhoon Kalmaegi (Luis; 2014) \u2013 A weaker typhoon which made landfall in the same provinces that Mangkhut did, around the same time in 2014 * Typhoon Haima (Lawin; 2016) \u2013 Similarly powerful typhoon which also made landfall in Cagayan * Typhoon Hato (Isang; 2017) \u2013 Most recent typhoon to affect Hong Kong and Macau prior to Mangkhut ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * * EMSR312: Super Typhoon Mangkhut over the Northern Philippines (damage assessment maps) \u2013 Copernicus Emergency Management Service * EMSR310: Tropical Cyclone MANGKHUT-18 in Northern Mariana Islands and Guam (delineation maps) \u2013 Copernicus Emergency Management Service Category:2018 Pacific typhoon season Category:September 2018 events in Asia Category:Typhoons in Hong Kong Category:Typhoons in the Philippines Category:Typhoons in China Category:Typhoons in Macau Category:Typhoons in Taiwan Category:2018 disasters in the Philippines Category:2018 in Guam Category:2018 in the Northern Mariana Islands Category:2018 in the Philippines Category:2018 in Taiwan Category:2018 in Hong Kong Category:2018 in Macau Category:2018 in China Mangkhut ",
