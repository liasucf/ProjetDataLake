He can barely move and has no recollection of why or how he came to be there. Crawling forward he eventually meets a woman and they try to piece together their past lives. ==Cast== *Shinya Tsukamoto * * * *Masato Tsujioka * ==Reception== Keith Uhlich from Slant Magazine awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, writing, \"Many directors would no doubt take a god\u2019s-eye perspective of Haze's hero, but Tsukamoto favors an intimate camera style that offsets the genre film sturm und drang and grounds his movie in a terrifyingly mortal perspective.\" Niina Doherty from HorrorNews.net gave the film a positive review, praising the film's claustrophobic atmosphere, sound design, and cinematography. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:2005 films Category:2005 horror films Category:Films directed by Shinya Tsukamoto Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese horror films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Mystery horror films ",
