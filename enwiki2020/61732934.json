    "text": "St\u00e9phan Fauve (born December 20, 1955 in Paris) is a French physicist. He is a Professor at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) in Paris, a member of the ENS Physics Laboratory. After defending his thesis in 1984 under the direction of Albert Libchaber as a preparatory associate at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, Stephan Fauve was successively Professor at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon (1987-1997), then at the ENS in Paris since 1997. He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences, Physics section. == Biography == St\u00e9phan Fauve, is a graduate of the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Saint-Cloud (1976- 1980), agr\u00e9g\u00e9 de sciences physiques (1979) and docteur \u00e8s sciences (1984). == Scientific work == St\u00e9phan Fauve's work has focused mainly on non-linear physics. His thesis work focused on the study of various scenarios of transition to chaos, in particular the measurement of critical exponents associated with the cascade of period doubling.A. Libchaber, C. Laroche and S. Fauve, \u00ab Period doubling cascade in mercury, a quantitative measurement \u00bb, J. Physique Lettres, 43, (1982), p. 211 He then carried out the first experiment to highlight the phenomenon of stochastic resonance.S. Fauve and F. Heslot, \u00ab Stochastic resonance in a bistable system \u00bb, Physics Letters, 97a, (1983), p. 5 He was one of the founders of the physics laboratory of ENS-Lyon, initiating there the study of various research fields, such as dissipative structures generated by instability,O.
