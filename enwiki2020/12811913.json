    "text": "Kelch proteins (and Kelch-like proteins) are a widespread group of proteins that contain multiple Kelch motifs. The kelch domain generally occurs as a set of five to seven kelch tandem repeats that form a \u03b2-propeller tertiary structure. Kelch-repeat \u03b2-propellers are generally involved in protein\u2013protein interactions, though the large diversity of domain architectures and limited sequence identity between kelch motifs make characterisation of the kelch superfamily difficult. == Structure == The N-terminus of several Kelch proteins contain other protein domains, including Discoidin, F-box, and Broad- complex, Tramtrack, Bric-a-Brac/Poxvirus Zinc finger (BTB/POZ) domains. Kelch proteins may also only have a \u03b2-propeller architecture. The BTB domain of kelch proteins (if present) allows the formation of homo- or heterodimers that mediate protein\u2013protein interactions. The C-terminus of Kelch proteins contains kelch repeats. Each kelch repeat is a sequence of 44\u201355 amino acids in length, usually occurring in clusters of 4 \u2013 7 repeats. Each kelch repeat forms a \"blade\" of the \u03b2-propeller fold, consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet secondary structure, arranged radially around a central axis, packed onto its adjoining repeats via hydrophobic contacts. Kelch-repeat \u03b2-propellers undergo a variety of binding interactions with other proteins, notably the actin filaments of a cell. == Function == Kelch like proteins are known to act as substrate adaptors for Cullin 3 ubiquitin ligases. ==Organisms== The first Kelch protein (from which this family derives its name) was isolated from Drosophila, in which Kelch-mutant females lay sterile, cup-shaped eggs;UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTION OF ACTIN-BINDING PROTEINS THROUGH GENETIC ANALYSIS OF DROSOPHILA OOGENESIS, by Andrew M. Hudson and Lynn Cooley; in the Annual Review of Genetics, Vol. 36: 455\u2013488 (Volume publication date December 2002); retrieved 12 December 2013 \"Kelch\" is German for \"chalice\", or \"cup\". Kelch proteins have also been isolated in many other animals, plants, bacteria, fungi, and even virus (restricted to Poxviridae). ==Human proteins containing Kelch motifs == ATRN; ATRNL1; CCIN; ENC1; FBXO42; GAN; HCFC1; HCFC2; IPP; IVNS1ABP; KBTBD10; KBTBD11; KBTBD2; KBTBD3; KBTBD4; KBTBD5; KBTBD6; KBTBD7; KBTBD8; KEAP1; KIAA1900; KLHDC1; KLHDC2; KLHDC3; KLHDC4; KLHDC5; KLHDC6; KLHDC7A; KLHDC7B; KLHDC8A; KLHDC8B; KLHDC9; KLHDC10; KLHL1; KLHL10; KLHL11; KLHL12; KLHL13; KLHL14; KLHL15; KLHL17; KLHL18; KLHL2; KLHL20; KLHL21; KLHL22; KLHL23; KLHL24; KLHL25; KLHL26; KLHL28; KLHL29; KLHL3; KLHL30; KLHL31; KLHL32; KLHL34; KLHL4; KLHL40; KLHL5; KLHL6; KLHL7; KLHL8; KLHL9; LZTR1; MEGF8; MKLN1; RABEPK; SARCOSIN; == References == * * * ",
