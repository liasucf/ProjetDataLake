The road will link Metro Manila with the provinces of Bulacan in the north, Rizal in the east, and Cavite in the south, passing through the cities of Pasig, Taguig and Muntinlupa. It was originally intended to be a long circumferential expressway linking North Luzon Expressway in San Jose del Monte and South Luzon Expressway in Muntinlupa passing through the Rizal cities and municipalities of Rodriguez, San Mateo, Antipolo and Taytay, and extending to Bacoor, Imus, Kawit and Noveleta in Cavite. == Route description == === San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan === There is a proposed C-6 Road that will traverse Tungkong Mangga in San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan. === San Mateo, Rizal === Circumferential Road 6 in the municipality of San Mateo, Rizal starts at the junction of the Batasan-San Mateo Road and Gen.
