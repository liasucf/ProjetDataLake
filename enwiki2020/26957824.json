Harris. The Baptist Union of Western Canada, St. John: Lingley Printing, 1976, p. 26 In 1897, British Columbian Baptists organized their own Convention.Margaret E. Thompson. The Baptist Story in Western Canada. Calgary: Baptist Union of Western Canada, pp. 107-110. These Conventions, and others, united to form the Baptist Convention of Western Canada in 1907,J.E. Harris, The Bpaits Union of Western Canada, p. 55. representing 201 churches and 11,000 congregants. The name was changed to the Baptist Union of Western Canada (BUWC) in 1909,J.E. Harris. The Baptist Union of Western Canada, p. 56. by which it was known until 2007. In 1944, the BUWC joined with the United Baptist Convention of the Maritimes and the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec to form the Baptist Federation of Canada (BFC) as a national coordinating body.J.E. Harris, The Baptist Union of Western Canada, p. 116. It was joined by l'Union d'Eglises Baptistes Francaises au Canada in 1970.Harry Renfree. Heritage and Horizon. The Baptist Story in Canada.

These four bodies remained federated until 1995 when the federation, by now renamed Canadian Baptist Federation (CBF), merged with Canadian Baptist Ministries, which now functions as the shared outreach arm of all four associations. In 2007, the BUWC changed its name to the Canadian Baptists of Western Canada to better reflect its national identity and western focus. Key figures in CBWC history include: Tommy Douglas, a Baptist minister in Weyburn Saskatchewan and healthcare reforming politician, William Aberhart (Bible Bill), an Albertan radio personality and Albertan Premier. Prime Minister John Diefenbaker was also a Canadian Baptist. ==Key beliefs== Key beliefs include: *Christian faith arises from choosing a personal relationship with Christ *The priesthood of all believers *Believers baptism, usually by full immersion, rather than infant baptism *There are two ordinances: baptism and communion *Separation of church and state *Voluntary association of churches *Commitment to evangelism and social justice They have ordained female pastors since 1959. ==Organization== The Canadian Baptists of Western Canada is organized into three regions: British Columbia and the Yukon, Alberta and the NWT, the Heartland of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
