    "text": "Decamethylferrocene or bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iron(II) is a chemical compound with formula or . It is a sandwich compound, whose molecule has an iron(II) cation attached by coordination bonds between two pentamethylcyclopentadienyl anions (, ). It can also be viewed as a derivative of ferrocene, with a methyl group replacing each hydrogen atom of its cyclopentadienyl rings. The name and formula are often abbreviated to DmFc, or . This compound is a yellow crystalline solid that is used in chemical laboratories as a weak reductant. The iron(II) core is easily oxidized to iron(III), yielding the monovalent cation decamethylferrocenium, and even to higher oxidation states. == Preparation == Decamethylferrocene is prepared in the same manner as ferrocene from pentamethylcyclopentadiene. This method can be used to produce other decamethylcyclopentadienyl sandwich compounds. :2 Li(C5Me5) + FeCl2 \u2192 Fe(C5Me5)2 \\+ 2 LiCl The product can be purified by sublimation. has staggered rings. The average distance between iron and each carbon is approximately 2.050 \u00c5. This structure has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. == Redox reactions == Like ferrocene, decamethylferrocene forms a stable cation because Fe(II) is easily oxidized to Fe(III). Because of the electron donating methyl groups on the groups, decamethylferrocene is more reducing than is ferrocene. In a solution of MeCN the reduction potential for the couple is -0.48 V compared to a reference (-0.59 V vs Fc/ in ). Oxygen is reduced to hydrogen peroxide by decamethylferrocene in acidic solution. Using powerful oxidants (e.g. or in , or in ) decamethylferrocene is oxidized to a stable dication with an iron(IV) core. In the salt, the rings are parallel. In contrast, a tilt angle of 17\u00b0 between the rings is observed in the crystal structure of the salt. == References == Category:Ferrocenes Category:Pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complexes Category:One-electron reducing agents ",
