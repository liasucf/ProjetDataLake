    "text": "The Maramure\u0219 dialect (subdialectul/graiul maramure\u0219ean) is one of the dialects of the Romanian language (Daco-Romanian). Its geographic distribution covers approximately the historical region of Maramure\u0219, now split between Romania and Ukraine. ==Classification== The Maramure\u0219 dialect belongs to the group of relatively fragmented Transylvanian varieties, along with the Cri\u0219ana dialect. This places the Maramure\u0219 dialect in the northern group of Romanian dialects, which also includes Moldavian dialect and Banat, as opposed to the southern grouping which consists of the Wallachian subdialect alone. In the context of the transition-like and very fragmented speech varieties of Transylvania, the classification of the Maramure\u0219 dialect as a separate variety is made difficult\u2014like the Cri\u0219ana dialect, or even more so\u2014by the small number of distinctive phonetic features. This difficulty made many researchers, in particular in earlier stages of the dialectal studies of Romanian, to not recognize an individual Maramure\u0219 dialect; this view was held by Gustav Weigand, Alexandru Philippide, Iorgu Iordan, and Emanuel Vasiliu among others. Subsequent analyses admit the existence of this variety, albeit with some reluctance, leading some researchers (such as Emil Petrovici and Sextil Pu\u0219cariu) to elaborate different classifications according to different criteria, depending on which the Maramure\u0219 variety is or is not individualized. Current classifications, owed to Romulus Todoran, Ion Coteanu and others, recognize a separate Maramure\u0219 dialect. ==Geographic distribution== The Maramure\u0219 dialect is spoken in the approximate area of the Maramure\u0219 historical region, including parts of both Romania and Ukraine. In Romania, the dialectal area covers the north-eastern part of the Maramure\u0219 County, along the valleys of the Tisza, Vi\u0219eu, Mara, and Cos\u0103u; many people are concentrated in Sighetu Marma\u021biei, Vi\u0219eu and Bor\u0219a. In Ukraine, speakers are found in the eastern part of the Zakarpattia Oblast (Northern Maramure\u0219); their number is decreasing. ==Subdivisions== Although spoken on a small area, the Maramure\u0219 dialect can be further divided, by using particularities that are mostly lexical, into three branches:Universitatea din Timi\u0219oara, Analele Universit\u0103\u021bii din Timi\u0219oara, 1969, p. 274 *a wide central part of the area, which is the most representative; *the north-western part has influences from the variety spoken in the Oa\u0219 Country; *the south-eastern part. ==Particularities== Many particularities are shared with the Cri\u0219ana dialect as well as with the other neighboring Transylvanian varieties, and some with the Moldavian dialect. ===Phonetic features=== *Mid vowels close to , respectively, or to intermediate positions. The most frequent is the change of to : for standard de, de la. *When appears in two consecutive syllables, the first opens to : (standard fete ). *The diphthong monophthongizes to : for standard u\u0219oar\u0103 , noapte . *After the consonants front vowels become central, whereas the diphthong monophthongizes to : for standard singur, sear\u0103, zeam\u0103, jir, \u021bin, zi. *Consonants are less palatal than in the standard language and have the effect of centralizing a following to : for standard cer, ger.Matilda Caragiu-Mario\u021beanu, Compendiu de dialectologie rom\u00e2n\u0103, Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103, 1975, p. 159 *After labials, becomes and the diphthong is monophthongized to : for standard merg, mearg\u0103, pe. *The stressed diphthong monophthongizes to in word-final positions: for standard avea, vrea. *The diphthong becomes in certain words: for standard b\u0103iat, muiat. *Devocalized are found in word-final positions: for standard p\u0103curar, cer. *The diphthong monophthongizes to : for standard c\u00e2ine, m\u00e2ine, p\u00e2ine. *Etymologic is preserved in words like \u00eemblu, \u00eemflu, \u00eentru (standard umblu, umflu, intru). *Archaic are preserved in words like (compare with standard ).Matilda Caragiu- Mario\u021beanu, Compendiu de dialectologie rom\u00e2n\u0103, Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103, 1975, p. 171 *The consonants are palatalized when followed by front vowels: for lemne, vine. *The palatalization of labials before front vowels takes specific forms: ** becomes : for standard piele; ** becomes : for standard bine; ** becomes : for standard mic; ** becomes : for standard s\u0103 fie; ** becomes : for standard vierme. ===Morphological and syntactical features=== *The possessive article is invariable: a meu, a mea, a mei, a mele (\"mine\", compare with standard al meu, a mea, ai mei, ale mele). *The proximal demonstrative pronouns are closer to their Latin etymons: aista, aiasta. *Some verbs of the 1st and 4th conjugation groups do not take the -ez and -esc suffixes: lucr\u0103, m\u0103 ru\u0219in, str\u0103luce (\"he works\", \"I feel shy\", \"it shines\", compare with standard lucreaz\u0103, m\u0103 ru\u0219inez, str\u0103luce\u0219te). On the other hand, the suffix -esc does sometimes occur in verbs conjugated without it in the standard language: \u00eemp\u0103r\u021b\u0103sc, omor\u0103sc, sim\u021b\u0103sc (\"I divide\", \"I kill\", \"I feel\", compare with standard \u00eempart, omor, simt). *Certain verb forms have replaced with other sounds: (\"I say\", \"I come\", \"coming\", compare with standard spun, vin, venind). This feature is shared with the Wallachian dialect. *The auxiliary used for the compound perfect of verbs in the 3rd person is o for the singular and or / o for the plural: (\"he said\", \"they said\", compare with standard a zis, au zis). *The following forms occur for the 3rd person of the subjunctive, both singular and plural: s\u0103 deie, s\u0103 steie, s\u0103 beie, s\u0103 vreie, ending in , where the standard language has s\u0103 dea, s\u0103 stea, s\u0103 bea, s\u0103 vrea, ending in . *The pluperfect can also be built analytically: m-am fost dus, am fost venit (\"I had gone\", \"I had come\", compare with the standard syntactic forms m\u0103 dusesem, venisem). *Verbs a aduce \"to bring\" and a veni \"to come\" have particular imperative forms: ad\u0103, vin\u0103 (standard adu, vino). *There is a general tendency toward shorting the words: o fo (standard a fost), Gheo (instead of Gheorghe, a male first name), etc. ===Lexical particularities=== *Specific words: a cu\u0219\u0103i (\"to taste\", standard a gusta), cocon (\"child\", standard copil), pup (\"flower bud\", standard boboc), potic\u0103 (\"drugstore\", standard farmacie), zierme (\"snake\", standard \u0219arpe). ===Sample=== Maramure\u0219 dialect: Standard Romanian: Se roag\u0103 lui Dumnezeu, \u00ee\u0219i face cruce \u0219i zice: Doamne, ajut\u0103-mi. \u0218i femeia ia un ou \u0219i-l sparge de car, ca s\u0103-i fie u\u0219oar\u0103 ar\u0103tura, ca \u0219i oul. English translation: \"She prays to God, she crosses herself, and says: God, help me. And the woman takes an egg and breaks it on the cart, so that the plowing will be light [easy] like the egg.\" ==Bibliography== *Ilona B\u0103descu, \"Dialectologie\", teaching material for the University of Craiova *Vasile Ursan, \"Despre configura\u021bia dialectal\u0103 a dacorom\u00e2nei actuale\", Transilvania (new series), 2008, No. 1, pp. 77\u201385 *Elena Buja, Liliana Coposescu, Gabriela Cusen, Luiza Mese\u0219an Schmitz, Dan Chiribuc\u0103, Adriana Neagu, Iulian Pah, Raport de \u021bar\u0103: Rom\u00e2nia, country report for the Lifelong Learning Programme MERIDIUM ==Notes== ==Further reading== *Mioara Avram, Marius Sala, Enciclopedia limbii rom\u00e2ne, Editura Univers Enciclopedic, 2001 ==See also== *Romanian phonology Category:Romanian language varieties and styles Category:Maramure\u0219 ",
