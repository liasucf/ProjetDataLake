    "text": "Thozalinone (USAN) (brand name Stimsen; former developmental code name CL-39808) is a psychostimulant that has been used as an antidepressant in Europe. It has also been trialed as an anorectic. Thozalinone is described as a \"dopaminergic stimulant\", and likely acts via inducing the release of dopamine and to a minimal extent norepinephrine; similar to analogue pemoline, it is seemingly devoid of abuse potential unlike common psychostimulants that increase catecholamines. == See also == * Fenozolone == References == Category:Antidepressants Category:Dimethylamino compounds Category:Lactams Category:Norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents Category:Oxazolones Category:Stimulants ",
