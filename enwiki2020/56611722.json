    "text": "The Second Oli cabinet is the current Government of Nepal, which was formed on 15 February 2018, after Khadga Prasad Oli was elected as the new Prime Minister of Nepal following the 2017 Nepalese election. Oli's candidacy was supported by the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre). He assumed his office along with two ministers with the remaining ministers to be named at later points. Despite the naming suggesting otherwise, the cabinet is not the extension of the first Oli cabinet, as two different cabinets were formed by two different Nepalese Prime Ministers in between both Oli cabinets. Apart from Prime Minister Oli, only two other ministers served in both cabinets; Giriraj Mani Pokharel, who headed the Ministry of Education both times and Shakti Bahadur Basnet, who served in two different ministries in the two cabinets. ==History== The Constitution of Nepal set the maximum numbers of ministers including State Ministers to 25, however, Oli first decided to have 17 ministries under him, which is less than the previous cabinets with each around 30 ministries. It was later expanded to 22 ministries and the addition of 3 state ministers has bought the number of cabinet members to 25. The first expansion to the cabinet was made on 26 February 2018, when seven more ministers were sworn in, while the second expansion took place on 16 March 2018. On 11 March 2018, Oli won a Motion of Confidence with 208 out of 268 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives. On 17 May 2018, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) merged to form the Nepal Communist Party. On 28 May 2018, the Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal, which would merge into Samajbadi Party, Nepal on 6 May 2019, joined the government. Samajbadi Party, Nepal left the government on 24 December, 2019. Further major cabinet reshuffle took place on 20 November 2019 and on 14 October 2020. == Ministers == {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"width: 240px;\"|Portfolio !style=\"width: 140px;\"|Minister
