    "text": "Blue Views is the fifth solo studio album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack, then a member of the supergroup Mike + The Mechanics. It was Carrack's first solo album in seven years; in the interim period between solo albums, he had recorded one album as a member of Squeeze, one album as a member of Spin 1ne 2wo, and two albums as a member of Mike + The Mechanics. Blue Views was originally released in 1995 on I.R.S. Records in the UK and most other territories. In the US, it appeared on the Ark 21 label. The album was produced by Carrack's erstwhile Mike + The Mechanics bandmate Peter Van Hooke, who had left the group the previous year. Blue Views spun off two UK top 40 hits: \"Eyes of Blue\" and a re-recording of \"How Long\", which Carrack had originally written and sung 22 years earlier as a member of the band Ace. In the US, \"Eyes of Blue\" was a minor hit on the Adult Contemporary (AC) charts, while the track \"For Once in Our Lives\" was a major AC hit, peaking at #3. The song \"Love Will Keep Us Alive\", a Carrack co-wrote, had been previously recorded by The Eagles for their 1994 album Hell Freezes Over. ==Reception== AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls Blue Views \"solid adult contemporary pop\", and while criticizing some of the \"spotty\" material, writes that \"Carrack's vocals are terrific and the sound is appealingly polished.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. * Paul Carrack \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards * Rod Argent \u2013 keyboards * Tim Renwick \u2013 guitar * Robbie McIntosh \u2013 guitar * Mitch Dalton \u2013 classical guitar (track 1) * Neil Hubbard \u2013 guitar (7) * Pino Palladino \u2013 bass * Keith Wilkinson \u2013 bass (8) * Andy Newmark \u2013 drums * Martin Ditcham \u2013 percussion * Luis Jardim \u2013 percussion * Frank Ricotti \u2013 percussion *Gavyn Wright \u2013 violin (10) * Perry Montague-Mason \u2013 violin (10) * Roger Chase \u2013 viola (10) * Bill Hawkins \u2013 viola (10) * Katie Kissoon \u2013 backing vocals * Tessa Niles \u2013 backing vocals * Lance Ellington \u2013 backing vocals (5, 9, 10) ===Production=== * Producer \u2013 Peter Van Hooke * Engineers \u2013 Paul Mortimer and Simon Smart * Assistant Engineers \u2013 Danny Dawson, Paul Hicks, Robbie Kazandjian and Guy Massey. * Mixing \u2013 John Brough and Simon Smart * Mastered by Chris Blair * Recorded, Mixed and Mastered at Abbey Road Studios (London, UK). * Photography \u2013 Paul Cox ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 albums Category:I.R.S.
