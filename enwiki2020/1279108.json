    "text": "St. James is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. ==Historical riding== The original St. James riding was established at the province's creation in 1870, and lasted until the election of 1879. It was located in what was then a separate community on Winnipeg's periphery. ==List of provincial representatives== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name ! Party ! Took Office !

The riding is located in the western section of Winnipeg. St. James is bordered on the east by Wellington, Minto and Wolseley, to the south by Tuxedo, to the north by Wellington and Lakeside, and to the west by Assiniboia and Kirkfield Park. The riding's population in 1996 was 20,417. In 1999, the average family income was $47,842, and the unemployment rate was 6.20%. Almost 19% of St. James's population is over 65 years of age, and almost 38% of dwelling units are rented. The service sector accounts for 15% of St. James's industry, following by government services (14%) and manufacturing (13%). St. James was a marginal Progressive Conservative/NDP riding for most of its history to 1988. It was won in that year by Liberal Paul Edwards, who was elected leader of his party in 1993. The NDP recaptured the seat in 1995. ==Recent boundary changes== The St. James riding underwent a dramatic redistribution in 1999. Previously, the riding occupied roughly the same space as the current riding of Minto. In fact, the original plan of the Manitoba Electoral Boundaries Commission in 1999 was to rename St. James as Minto, and create a new riding called King Edward to its immediate west (primarily from the old riding of Sturgeon Creek). Instead, the boundaries legislation passed by the Manitoba legislature in 1999 determined that the new riding would be called St. James. Although the current riding has some territory in common with its predecessor of the same name, it is probably more accurately regarded as the successor riding to Sturgeon Creek. The NDP captured this seat from the Tories in 1999, and retained it in 2003. ==List of provincial representatives== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name ! Party ! Took Office !
