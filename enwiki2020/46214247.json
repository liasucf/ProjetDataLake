The French ships had been part of the Comte d Estaing's fleet. The engagement that followed was one sided - the French ships were in disorder; their crews were weak; and they could not escape the vastly superior British force. The Blanche was defeated and captured on the evening of 21 December. The Fortun\u00e9e attempted to escape by throwing her quarter-deck guns overboard, but was captured on the early morning of 22 December, an hour before the Elise had struck. The Blanche and Fortun\u00e9e were thus added to the British navy. Rowley then led his squadron to capture a large French convoy, from Marseilles, off Martinique. == References == == Sources == * * * Category:Conflicts in 1779 Guadeloupe (1779) Guadeloupe (1779) Guadeloupe (1779) Category:History of Guadeloupe Category:1779 in France Category:18th century in Guadeloupe ",
