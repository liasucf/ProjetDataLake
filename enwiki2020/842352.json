It is operated by Southeastern. ==History== The station opened on 1 September 1866. Goods facilities were meagre at first with a single siding on the down side just east of the station building, but the goods yard was gradually enlarged over the years as freight traffic increased in importance. In the early 1870s a second siding was installed dedicated to coal, and a coal shed was erected across the track. Later a further pair of sidings was inserted alongside the existing tracks. An SER-designed signal cabin was positioned some east of the up side station structure. In 1955 the platforms were lengthened to accommodate ten carriage trains. In British Railways days the SR green totem signs displayed the station name as Lee for Burnt Ash. The goods yard closed in 1968. In 1988 the clapboard up side ticket office was demolished and replaced by a new ticket office. In 1992 the platforms were lengthened to accommodate twelve carriage trains.London Suburban Railways - Lewisham to Dartford by Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith (Middleton Press 1991)http://www.kentrail.org.uk/Lee.htm ==Location== Lee Station is in Burnt Ash Road, Lee, in the London Borough of Lewisham. ==Connections== London Buses routes 202, 261 and 273 serve the station. ==Facilities== The station has two platforms.
