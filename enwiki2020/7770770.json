    "text": "\"Brand New Key\" is a pop song written and sung by folk music singer Melanie. Initially a track of Melanie's album Gather Me, produced by Melanie's husband Peter Schekeryk, it was known also as \"The Rollerskate Song\" due to its chorus. It was her greatest success, scoring No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart during December 1971 and January 1972. Billboard ranked it as the No. 9 song of 1972. It also scored No. 1 in Canada and Australia and No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. ==Overview== The song is sung from the viewpoint of a girl with roller skates trying to attract the attention of a boy. In an interview with Examiner.com, Melanie described what she claimed was the inspiration for the song: \"I was fasting with a 27-day fast on water. I broke the fast and went back to my life living in New Jersey and we were going to a flea market around six in the morning. On the way back\u2026 and I had just broken the fast, from the flea market, we passed a McDonald's and the aroma hit me, and I had been a vegetarian before the fast. So we pulled into the McDonald's and I got the whole works... the burger, the shake, and the fries\u2026 and no sooner after I finished that last bite of my burger\u2026 that song was in my head. The aroma brought back memories of roller skating and learning to ride a bike and the vision of my dad holding the back fender of the tire. And me saying to my dad... 'You\u2019re holding, you\u2019re holding, you\u2019re holding, right?' Then I\u2019d look back and he wasn\u2019t holding and I\u2019d fall. So that whole thing came back to me and came out in this song.\" The song has been described as folk music, pop music, and soft rock. == Possible sexual innuendo == Melanie has acknowledged the possibility of detecting sexual innuendo in the lyrics, but has denied any deeper meaning: ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1971\u201372) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |Canada Top Singles (RPM) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- | |- |Dutch Top 40 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |- |New Zealand (Listener) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- |South Africa | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |US Billboard Adult Contemporary |align=\"center\"|5 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1972) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Australia | style=\"text- align:center;\"|11 |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|27 |- |South Africa |align=\"center\"|6 |- |UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|46 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |- |U.S. Cash Box | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |} ===All-time charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !

The parody featured lyrics from Tonya Harding's point of view, and included the chorus, \"I've got a brand new pair of figure skates / You've got a busted knee; / They're gonna lock up my ex-husband and throw away the key.\" *The song was used prominently in the 2005 movie Evil Aliens. *With lyrics describing Best Film nominee Pan's Labyrinth, Minnie Driver sang a parody of the song at the 2007 Spirit Awards (\"I blew a giant frog to smithereens, I got his golden key\"). *An Irish Republican parody of the song entitled \"Kinky Boots\" was released by The Davitts on their 2011 album Celtic Anthems. ==References in popular culture== Melanie's version is heard in the 1997 film Boogie Nights as Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) has his \"audition\" with Rollergirl (Heather Graham) in front of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). The song is also played in Jackass 3-D during the \"Bungee Boogie\" stunt skit (in which the cast members use bungee cords, skateboards and a ramp to slingshot into a kiddie pool). On April 4, 2016, Jimmy Fallon lip synced the song during a \"Lip Sync Battle\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, while he competed with actress Melissa McCarthy. In the 9th season episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, \"Werewolf\", Mike sings part of the song's chorus in a medley set to the film's end credits. On the October 17, 2016, episode of singing competition television show The Voice, Team Miley (Cyrus) contestants Darby Walker and Karlee Metzger performed the song in a Battle round. Despite coaches Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, and Alicia Keys all preferring Metzger's vocal performance, Cyrus chose to name Walker the winner of the Battle. Shortly after, Metzger was stolen onto Team Blake, saving her from elimination. The original version appears in season one of the FX show The Bridge, as the character Daniel Frye flushes his supply of drugs and alcohol. The original version also appears in the 2016 Hallmark TV movie Signed sealed delivered from the heart. During the 16th season of American Idol, contestant Maddie Poppe performed the song during the Top 24 elimination round. The original version appears in episode 1 of the first season of the 2017 Australian television series Sisters, as the viewer is initially introduced to Julia, one of the main characters. In the first online episode of the Comeback Stage of the singing competition television show The Voice, no-chair reject Klea Olson performed the song as part of a Battle round against fellow Team Bebe (Rexha) members Nathan and Chesi Arnett, who performed the song \"Tulsa Time.\" It was not enough for Rexha to choose to advance her to the next round in the Comeback Stage, as Olson was eliminated when Rexha chose Nathan & Chesi as the winners instead. ==References== Category:1971 singles Category:1972 singles Category:1976 singles Category:British pop songs Category:Melanie (singer) songs Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand Category:Number-one singles in South Africa Category:Number-one singles in Australia Category:Single Top 100 number-one singles Category:Billboard Hot 100 number- one singles Category:1971 songs ",
