    "text": "Vestre Gausdal church ( Nykirken ) is a half-timbered cross church in Gausdal municipality, Innlandet county. It was built in 1781 and inaugurated in 1784 . The church probably replaced a timber church from 1665 which in turn had replaced B\u00f8dalen stave church . At the same time, the church site was moved to ForsetNorwegian Mapping Agency further down the valley. The half-timbered B\u00f8dal Church from 1665 was probably closed in the years around this. However, it does not appear to have been demolished immediately. According to local traditions, it must have been used, among other things, as a meeting place for a hundred years afterwards.Gausdalsminner 10, s. 54.Dietrichson, Lorentz (1892):De norske stavkirker. Studier over deres system, oprindelse og historiske udvikling. Kristiania: Cammermeyer, s.233-234 omtaler imidlertid bare stavkirken og formoder at det var den som ble nedlagt i 1784. The church has approx. 400 seats. In the Church is a figure of Madonna with the child as well as a bishop figure, both from the Middle Ages. There is a cemetery by the church. == External links == * Gausdal church council * Vestre Gausdal Cemetery ==References== Category:Churches in Gausdal Category:Churches in S\u00f8r- Gudbrandsdal Deanery ",
