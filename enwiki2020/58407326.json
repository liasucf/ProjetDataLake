According to Young, Kelley came up with the song's melody, and Young handled most of the lyrics. He said of the song that it is about \"those moments in your life that are so good and you\u2019re so present in them that you are able, while you're in them, to realize how good they are...Anybody who is lucky enough to have had moments like that will hear the song and go there immediately.\" He said that the lyrics came about in a conversation with Caver and Ebach about \"those moments in your life...where you're having an incredible moment, and in the middle of it you have this thought that comes to you. And that thought is, I wish that this moment could last forever.\" ==Commercial performance== \"Here Tonight\" reached number one on the Billboard' Country Airplay chart dated April 20, 2019, which is Young's fourth consecutive number one on that chart.
