Design of Type 079 LSM took more than two years, lasting from 1971 to 1973, and construction begun in May 1974 at Guangzhou Shipyard International, and launched on July 22, 1976. Due to the changes of Sino-Vietnamese relations, the end customer became PLAN instead, and the ship entered PLAN service in October, 1976. This class received NATO reporting name Yulian class. Trials between December 1972 to January 1977 has revealed that the performance was somewhat satisfactory, but the speed was slow and the ability to operate in bad weather condition is poor, with the maximum sea state allowed to operate being sea state 6. Work immediately begun on redesign named as Type 79II LSM, while the first unit is subsequently named as Type 79I LSM. ==Type 79II== Shortcomings of Type 79I LSM revealed in trials lead to immediate redesign named as Type 79II LSM, which was completed in October 1977, and a total of 31 was built, including the conversion of the sole Type 79I LSM to Type 79II standard. 26 were completed by Guangzhou Shipyard International, and 4 were completed by Xiamen Shipyard. Like its predecessor Type 79I LSM, Type 79II LSM was also designed by 708th Research Institute. The main difference between 79I & 79II is that the latter is larger, with dimensions increased to 72 m x 13.8 m x 2.6 m respectively, and the displacement is increased to 1100 tons. More complex machinery was added, lead to the increase of crew member to 109, more than 3 times of that of the original Type 79I LSM. The speed is also slightly increased to 13 kts. Armament is strengthened by the addition of two BM21 122 mm rocket launchers. Nearly three decades after production ended in 1983, all 30 Type 79II LSM still remain in Chinese service today, mostly in Chinese navy South Sea Fleet (PLAN SSF), though most of them are delegated to transport duties. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
