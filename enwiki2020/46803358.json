Plagued with a series of unexplained troubles that broke out suddenly, owner of a coalmine seeks the help of Byomkesh Bakshi to sort things out for him. When Byomkesh arrives with his trusted confidante Ajit, they discover to their complete dismay a maze of crimes woven around a violent murder that had little to do with the job that they were entrusted with. A mesmerizing mosaic of criminal characters, a sordid saga of lecherous lust, the thriller unfolds the complex layers of the human mind, so powerfully penned by Sharadindu, now retold by the master movie-maker Anjan Dutt. Byomkesh eventually cracks the case but seals it with his own sense of justice. ==Reception== Upon release, the movie received moderately positive reviews from the critics while it was well received by the public. ==Sequel== A hint for the next case was given at the end of this movie. The sequel was released on 7 October 2016. ==See also== * Byomkesh Bakshi * Abar Byomkesh * Byomkesh Phire Elo ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s Bengali- language films Category:2015 films Category:Bengali-language films Category:Indian films Category:Indian detective films Category:2015 crime thriller films Category:Films directed by Anjan Dutt Category:Byomkesh Bakshi films Category:Indian crime thriller films ",
