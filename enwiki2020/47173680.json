They divorced in 2002, and Walden lived with his mother and younger brother, Christopher, in Bradenton. Walden attended Palma Sola Elementary School, Martha B. King Middle School and Manatee High School, graduating in 2013. He attended State College of Florida, Manatee- Sarasota for two years. At age 6, his mother enrolled him in piano lessons, which he continued for 10 years. Early performances included recitals of Beethoven and Bach classical works, which he played in local churches, in front of attentive audiences. At 9 years old, Walden took a few months of guitar lessons to learn the basics and a few more lessons at age 15. In high school, he learned more about playing the guitar by watching YouTube videos and learned how to write songs by breaking down the patterns of songs by verse, chorus and bridge. One of his first songs, Just Another Story, was about a girl unaware of a boy's affections. Walden considers Ed Sheeran, Damien Rice, All Time Low and The Maine as his major musical influences. Musician Billy Rice, known for playing with Toby Keith and John Michael Montgomery, gave Walden his first acoustic guitar in 2010 and encouraged him to take up singing. Through Rice, Walden met Del Couch, who founded the Del Couch Music Education Foundation in 2010, now housed in the Manatee School for the Arts in Palmetto, Florida. Walden became a member of the foundation in 2010 along with fellow Bradenton singer-songwriter Sam Woolf, who finished fifth in the 2014 season of American Idol.
