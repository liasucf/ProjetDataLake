    "text": "|} This is a list of electoral district results for the 1912 Queensland state election. At the time, the voting system in Queensland was based on contingency voting, which was similar to the modern optional preferential voting system. In electorates with 3 or more candidates, preferences were not distributed if a candidate received more than 50% of the primary vote. If none received more than 50%, all except the top two candidates were eliminated from the count and their preferences distributed between the two leaders, with the one receiving the most votes declared the winner. == Results by electoral district == === Albert === === Aubigny === === Balonne === === Barcoo === === Bowen === === Bremer === === Brisbane === === Bulimba === === Bundaberg === === Buranda === === Burke === === Burnett === === Burrum === === Cairns === === Carnarvon === === Charters Towers === === Chillagoe === === Cook === === Cooroora === === Cunningham === === Dalby === === Drayton === === Eacham === === East Toowoomba === === Enoggera === === Fassifern === ==== By-election ==== * Caused by the resignation of Arnold Wienholt === Fitzroy === === Flinders === === Fortitude Valley === === Gregory === === Gympie === === Herbert === === Ipswich === === Ithaca === === Kennedy === === Keppel === === Kurilpa === === Leichhardt === === Lockyer === === Logan === === Mackay === === Maranoa === === Maree === === Maryborough === ==== By-election ==== * Election was voided by the Court of Disputed Returns. * This by-election was held on 12 October 1912. === Merthyr === === Mirani === === Mitchell === === Mount Morgan === === Mundingburra === === Murilla === === Murrumba === === Musgrave === === Nanango === === Normanby === ==== By-election ==== * This by- election was caused by the death of George Fox. * It was held on 5 March 1914. === Nundah === === Oxley === === Paddington === === Pittsworth === === Port Curtis === ==== By-election ==== * This result was overturned by the Court of Disputed Returns and a by-election was held on 26 October 1912. === Queenton === === Rockhampton === === Rosewood === === South Brisbane === === Stanley === === Toombul === === Toowong === === Toowoomba === === Townsville === === Warrego === === Warwick === === Wide Bay === === Windsor === == See also == * 1912 Queensland state election * Candidates of the Queensland state election, 1912 * Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1912-1915 == References == Category:Results of Queensland elections ",
