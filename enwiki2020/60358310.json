She is best known for her role in the 2019 Jordan Peele horror film Us and as the voice for Young Nala in the 2019 The Lion King remake. == Career == Joseph has been dancing since age two. She once auditioned for a school play in third grade using Lupita Nyong'o's Oscar acceptance speech. Her first major acting role came when she was cast as young Nala in The Lion King on Broadway when she was nine years old. Joseph was an original cast member for Andrew Lloyd Webber's School of Rock. She also performed in Hairspray Live! in 2016 as Inez Stubbs. On November 1, 2017, Joseph was chosen to reprise her role as young Nala in the 2019 remake of the original film The Lion King, directed by Jon Favreau. She chose to work on the film because she sees the character as a role model who inspires young girls. Upon learning that Beyonc\u00e9 would be voicing grown-up Nala, Joseph stated that she was motivated to work harder and consider how Beyonc\u00e9 would approach the role. Joseph read for the dual role of Zora and Umbrae in the horror film Us (2019) three times before being offered the part. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year !
