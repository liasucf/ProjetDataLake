    "text": "Leucopogon malayanus is a plant in the family Ericaceae native to Cambodia, Malaya, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. However occurrence data from GBIF, shows it occurring in Queensland (Australia), Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and India. It was first described by William Jack in 1820, who \"found (it) abundantly at Singapore\". There are two subspecies: * Leucopogon malayanus subsp. novoguineensis (Sleumer) Pedley * Leucopogon malayanus subsp. malayanus ==Description== ===Leucopogon malayanus subsp. novoguineensis=== This plant is usually found as a small multistemmed windswept tree but also occurs as a shrub. The leaves may be stalked or without stalks and vary considerably in size (40-120 mm by 8-20 mm). There are about 8-12 parallel leaf veins but no obvious midrib. The flowers occur in spikes and the calyx lobes are about 2 by 1.9 mm and have hairy margins. The stamen filaments are about 1.5 mm long with anthers about 0.6 by 0.2 mm. The ovary has 8-10 locules. The fruits are squashed globules (about 5-6 by 7-9 mm diameter), and the calyx persists at the base. This subspecies is found only in north-east Queensland and New Guinea. ===Leucopogon malayanus subsp. malayanus=== This subspecies is called Styphelia malayana var. malayana by Hermann Sleumer. It differs from L. malayanus subsp. novoguineensis in that it does not have the long hairs at the top of the ovary and at the base of the style of L. malayanus subsp. novoguineensis. Additionally, the ranges of the two subspecies do not overlap. ==References== malayanus Category:Ericales of Australia Category:Flora of Papua New Guinea Category:Flora of Indo-China Category:Flora of Malesia Category:Flora of Oceania Category:Plants described in 1820 ",
