    "text": "''''' (Evening magic), WAB 57, is a song composed by Anton Bruckner in 1878. == History == Bruckner composed the song on a text of Heinrich von der Mattig on 13 January 1878. He dedicated it to Carl Almeroth. The piece was not performed during the composer's life, because of its performance difficulties (humming voices). It was first performed in 1911 by Viktor Keldorfer with the Wiener M\u00e4nnergesang-Verein (Vienna men's choral association), and was thereafter published by the Universal Edition.C. van Zwol, p. 728 It was very popular with Austrian choirs during the interbellum. The work, of which the original manuscript is stored in the archive of the Wiener M\u00e4nnergesang- Verein, is issued in Band XXIII/2, No. 29 of the '.Gesamtausgabe \u2013 Weltliche Ch\u00f6re == Text == Abendzauber uses a text by Heinrich von der Mattig. {| | |style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|The lake dreams between rocks, The forest whispers gently. The mountain slope is lit By the silvery light of the moon. From the darkness of the forest, Sounds the song of the nightingale, And from the lake, songs float With enchanting sound. I sat at the lakeshore, Lost in sweet dream; I dreamed to hover Aloft to Heaven's realm. Who could ever forget This delightful place! Deep in my heart The enchanting tones still sound. |} == Music == The 82-bar long work in G-flat major is scored for choir, tenor or baritone soloist. Similarly to Das hohe Lied, the first part (58 bars) is sung by the soloist with an accompaniment of humming voices. From \"Wer k\u00f6nnte je vergessen\", the melody is taken over by the choir. In addition, four horns are figuring Alphorns, and a Ferngesang (chant from a distance) of female voices is figuring yodelers. The song, which is in the line of Mitternacht, WAB 80, and the two settings of Um Mitternacht (WAB 89 and 90), is a remarkable example of nature imagery.U. Harten, p. 42 Bruckner's specialist Ernst Kurth considers this original, somewhat odd piece as one Bruckner's most romantic works. == Selected discography == The first recording of Abendzauber was by Bryan Fairfax, with Alfred Orda (tenor), the BBC Chorus and the horns of the London Symphony Orchestra, Szymanowski - Bruckner - Schumann.
