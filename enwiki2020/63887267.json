They were never found. ==Accident== Viellehner was involved in a traffic accident involving a heavy goods vehicle during a cycling training session. The vehicle overtook her and pulled in sharply, the wheel of the truck caught her bike's front wheel causing her to go under the truck. She suffered severe injuries and was put into a medically induced coma for a week before she died. ==References== Category:1985 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Bavaria Category:German female long-distance runners Category:German female marathon runners Category:German female triathletes Category:Duathletes Category:Sport deaths in Italy ",
