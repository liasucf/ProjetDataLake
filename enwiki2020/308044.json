Despite being the eldest son of a good family, he had, like most gentlemen of Gascony. He was the elder brother of Jean de Montluc. He served first as a private archer and man-at-arms in Italy, with Bayard for his captain, fought all through the wars of King Francis I of France, and was knighted at the battle of Ceresole (1544), to which victory he had brilliantly contributed as adviser to the young Count of Enghien. Having apparently enjoyed no patronage, he was already middle-aged. From then on, however, his merits were recognized. His chief feat was the famous defence of Siena (1555) which he related himself. When the French Wars of Religion broke out, Montluc, a staunch Catholic royalist, held Guyenne for the king. After nearly half a century of service to the crown, Henry III made him marshal of France in 1574. He died at Estillac near Agen three years later. ==Works== Montluc's reputation was made by his Commentaires de Messire Blaise de Montluc (Bordeaux, 1592), in which he described his fifty years of service (1521\u20131574). This book, the \"soldier's Bible\" (or \"breviary,\" according to others), as Henry IV called it, is one of many books of memoirs produced by the gentry of France at that time. It is said to have been dictated, which may account for the style. The Commentaires are in the collection of Michaud and Poujoulat, with a standard edition in the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'histoire de France, ed. by M. de Ruble (5 vols, 1865\u20131872). See R\u00fcstow, Militarische Biographien, v. i. (Z\u00fcrich, 1858). Blaise de Montluc condemned the development of the infantry firearm saying: : \"Would to heaven that this accursed engine [the arquebus] had never been invented, I had not then received those wounds which I now languish under, neither had so many valiant men been slain for the most part by the most pitiful fellows and the greatest cowards...\"Richard Holmes, \"Villanious Saltpetre\" in Richard Holmes, (ed.)
