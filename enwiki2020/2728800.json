    "text": "The Butcher and the Butterfly is the third studio album by English alternative rock band Queenadreena, released in May 2005 though One Little Indian and Imperial Records. The album features writing from frontwoman KatieJane Garside, guitarist Crispin Gray, and drummer Pete Howard, as well as contributions from Garside's sister, Melanie Garside, who also plays bass on the album. Richard Adams, the bassist of Garside and Gray's former band, Daisy Chainsaw, also has a co-writing credit on one track. == Composition == Queenadreena began working on their third studio album, which became The Butcher and the Butterfly, as early as 2002 with the release of the controversial \"FM Doll\" (originally titled \"Fuck Me Doll\") which alludes to child beauty pageants and the 1996 murder of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey; the single was released as a stand-alone single under Rough Trade Records whilst the band was touring in promotion for their second studio album, Drink Me. After they were dropped from Rough Trade, the band continued to work on the album, and the slightly-retitled \"FM Doll\" was re-released on 21 March 2005 as the album's lead single. ==Release== In March 2004, the band performed several new songs from the record at a show in Nottingham. The Butcher and the Butterfly was released in May 2005 and failed to chart in any territories. \"Medicine Jar\" was released as the album's second single in June 2005. The single's b-side, \"Seven Sins\", appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese release of the album. The US edition of the album differs significantly from releases in other territories; \"Razorblade Sky\" and \"Pretty Like Drugs\" from Drink Me are featured, while \"Princess Carwash (Slight Reply)\", \"Cold Light of Day\", and \"Butcher and the Butterfly\" are omitted. ==Reception== Helen Tipping of Pennyblackmusic gave the album a positive review, while noting that the album \"doesn\u2019t make for easy listening, neither the dark subject matter nor much of the music.\" == Track listing == == Personnel == Queenadreena * KatieJane Garsidevocals * Crispin Grayguitar * Melanie Garsidebass * Pete Howarddrums Technical personnel *Paul Corkettproduction == References == ==External links== * Category:2005 albums Category:Queenadreena albums Category:One Little Independent Records albums ",
