    "text": "Note: for exact dates in the Gregorian calendar see Jewish holidays 2000-2050. Public holidays in Israel refers to national holidays officially recognized by the Knesset, Israel's parliament. The State of Israel has adopted most traditional religious Jewish holidays as part of its national calendar, while also having established new modern holiday observances since its founding in 1948. Of the religious and modern holidays below, some are bank holidays / federal holidays requiring all schools, government institutions, financial sector, and most retailers in Jewish Israeli society to be closed, while other holidays are marked as days of note or memorial remembrances with no breaks in public or private sector activities. As is the case with all religious Jewish holidays, most public holidays in Israel generally begin and end at sundown, and follow the Hebrew calendar. Because of this, most holidays in Israel fall on a different Gregorian calendar date each year, which syncs every 19 years with the Hebrew calendar. Shabbat, the weekly Sabbath day of rest, in Israel begins every Friday evening just before sundown, ending Saturday evening just after sundown. Most of the Israeli workforce, including schools, banks, public transportation, government offices, and retailers within Jewish Israeli society are shut down during these approximately 25 hours, with some non- Jewish retailers and most non-kosher restaurants still open. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Date in Hebrew calendar ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | English name ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Hebrew name ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Range of dates in Gregorian calendar ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" |Status |- | Every Friday evening before sundown to Saturday evening after sundown | Sabbath | \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea Shabbat | Every week | Official holiday with all schools, government institutions, public transportation and most retailers shut down. |- | Tishrei 1-2 | New Year | \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 Rosh Hashanah | between Sept 5 & Oct 5 | Official holiday (2 days) |- | Tishrei 3 | Fast of Gedaliah | \u05e6\u05d5\u05dd \u05d2\u05d3\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4 Fast of Gedalia | | Business as usual |- | Tishrei 10 | Day of Atonement | \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05db\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8 Yom Kippur | between Sept 14 & Oct 14 | Official holiday, businesses close around noon on the holiday's eve.
