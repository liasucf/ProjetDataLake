    "text": "Mars Hill Baptist Church, also known as Fries Memorial Moravian Church, is a historic African-American Baptist church located at Winston-Salem, Forsyth County, North Carolina. It was built in 1915, and is a \"T\"-shaped brick building with corner tower in the Gothic Revival style. Also on the property is the parsonage; a one-story, pebble-dash finished Queen Anne style dwelling. It has a high hipped roof, a central hipped dormer, and a hipped-roof full- front porch supported by fluted columns. It was originally built for a white Moravian congregation, until the Mars Hill Baptist Church congregation purchased the building in 1944 for $4,000. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. ==References== Category:African-American history in Winston-Salem, North Carolina Category:Baptist churches in North Carolina Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in North Carolina Category:Queen Anne architecture in North Carolina Category:Churches completed in 1915 Category:20th-century Baptist churches in the United States Category:Churches in Winston-Salem, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Winston-Salem, North Carolina ",
