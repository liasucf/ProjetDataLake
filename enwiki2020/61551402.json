The time-period for which was shifted to be a contemporary adaptation. It too was followed by a sequel in 1995. Though the remakes were not critically acclaimed releases, they have subsequently have gained cult status within their respective genre. A third installment, \"mini- sequel\", was filmed during the COVID-19 pandemic and will release on September 25, 2020 to support World Central Kitchen's efforts in relieving those effected by the coronavirus. A reboot of the franchise, is in development from the Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures as an exclusive film for the company's Disney+ streaming service. == Origin == The 1949 satirical comedy novel, Father of the Bride, written by Edward Streeter serves the inspiration for the film adaptations.

Steve Martin, Dianne Keaton, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Kieran Culkin, George Newbern, and Martin Short reprised their respective roles, with Alexandra Shipp and Robert De Niro joining.
