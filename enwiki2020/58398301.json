He was then a student of Arthur Ho\u00e9r\u00e9e and at the Conservatory of Versailles with Aim\u00e9 Steck before he entered the Conservatoire de Paris where he won first prizes for harmony, counterpoint and fugue in the classes of Marcel Samuel-Rousseau and No\u00ebl Gallon. A student of Tony Aubin for musical composition, he was awarded a Second Grand Prix de Rome for his cantata Le rire de Gargantua by Randal LemoineRandal Lemoine on BNF (after Rabelais) in 1955 during his first competition. The piece, performed by the Orchestra of the Op\u00e9ra Comique with singers Ren\u00e9 Bianco, Louis RiallandLouis Rialland and Jacqueline CauchardJacqueline Cauchard on BNF conducted by Jean Fournet, earned him the Second Grand Prix. He was then hired by EMI in 1957 as assistant to the \"classical\" artistic director Ren\u00e9 Challan, a position he held until 1960. In particular, he was responsible for recordings by artists such as Samson Fran\u00e7ois, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Paul Tortelier, Aldo Ciccolini. Despite a favourable reception for his first compositions, the dislocation of the group \"Pentacorde\" and the appearance of the \"serialist episode\" encouraged him to abandon music for good. He then made a career as a senior executive in an international company. His works have been performed by artists such as Jean Hubeau, Andr\u00e9 Collard, Robert Quatrocchi, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pignari, Jean Della-Valle, the Orchestre de chambre de la radio conducted by Louis de Froment, the Orchestre de chambre de Versailles conducted by Bernard Wahl.

About Maillard, Nicolas Bacri wrote: ... a new generation of performers is discovering (his work), sensitive to the charm of a discourse that is both dense and clear, part of a timeless classicism which, from Couperin to Dutilleux, via Roussel, has always been the mark of the great \"French musicians\".
