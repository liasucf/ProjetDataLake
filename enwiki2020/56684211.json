    "text": "Francois Lacroix (1806\u20131876) was a wealthy tailor, fabric merchant, and prominent Creole landowner in New Orleans, Louisiana along with his brother Julien Adolphe Lacroix (1808\u20131868). His son Victor Lacroix was killed and mutilated in the New Orleans massacre of 1866 when Republicans gathered and paraded for a constitutional convention at the Mechanics Institute in New Orleans and were attacked by Democrats including armed police and firemen. He took care of the widow, a white woman (Sarah Brown), and the two children left behind. ==Life== Lacroix financed the Hospice of the Holy Family and his wife helped organize it. He was also president of the Couvent School established in the will of Marie Couvent for African American orphans. As a \"free person of color\", Lacroix was a wealthy and cultured property owner, and had slaves. Lacroix and his brother were born in Cuba. Their parents are believed to have fled there from Saint Domingue. Lacroix worked in New Orleans' French Quarter as a partner in the firm of Cordeviolle and Lacroix. He acquired large real estate holdings and was philanthropist supporting orphan children through the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pour L'education des Orphelins des Indigenes and La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Sainte Famille. Deeply affected by his son's death, Lacroix was a participant in seances to try and communicate with him. An exhibit about his life was put on at a New Orleans Public Library. ==References== Category:1806 births Category:1876 deaths Category:Cuban emigrants to the United States Category:People from New Orleans ",
