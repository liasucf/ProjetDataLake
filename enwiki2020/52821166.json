The boats have also been called the Spica II class and were named after Swedish cities. ==Design== The initial design was a version of the earlier Spica-class torpedo boat with some minor changes. ===Machinery=== The power train was identical to the preceding class and comprised three Bristol Proteus gas turbine engines driving three propellers ===Armament=== The initial armament was identical to the Spica class, comprising a Bofors 57 mm gun and six torpedo tubes. There was a refit programme in 1982\u20131985, where four launchers for RBS-15 anti-ship missiles replaced four torpedo tubes. Mines could be carried in place of the torpedoes or missiles.

The boats were originally set to be operated until 2010 but they were taken out of service early due to financial reasons with HSwMS Ystad decommissioning in 2005. ==Royal Malaysian Navy== A version of this design was built for the Malaysian Navy by Karlskrona dockyard as the . These ships had an all diesel power plant, with a revised superstructure design, different electronics and Exocet missiles ==Ships== All ships were built by Karlskrona Dockyard {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
