(later Reynolds Securities) founded in 1931. ===Dean Witter & Co. (1924-1978)=== Blyth Witter & Co., the firm's predecessor was founded in 1914 by Dean G. Witter and Charles R. Blyth. Blyth Witter's other successor firm was known as Blyth & Co. and later Blyth, Eastman Dillon & Co. Dean Witter & Company was founded by Dean G. Witter (together with his brother Guy Witter and cousin Jean Witter) as a retail brokerage firm in 1924. With its original offices at 45 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, California, Dean Witter would be among the largest brokerages on the West Coast. Among Witter's original partners were his brother Guy and their cousins Jean C. Witter and Ed Witter as well as Fritz Janney. Prior to founding his own firm, Witter partnered with Charles R. Blyth to found Blyth, Witter & Co., another San Francisco based brokerage in 1914. After Witter's departure, Blyth would continue on his own (ultimately acquired by Paine Webber in 1979) and the two firms would remain competitors for decades. Witter's family had moved to Northern California from Wausau, Wisconsin, settling in San Carlos, California in 1891. Before founding his own firms, Dean Witter had worked as a salesman for Louis Sloss & Company from his graduation from the University of California, Berkeley in 1909 until 1914.Dean Witter Foundation.
