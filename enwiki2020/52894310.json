    "text": "Rodney Scott Cosper, known as Scott Cosper (born 1968), is an American politician who served one term as a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives for the 54th District. Cosper succeeded Republican Jimmie Don Aycock, who did not seek re-election in 2016. Cosper is also a former mayor of Killeen, Texas. In his bid for a second term in 2018, Cosper was forced into a runoff election on May 22 with fellow Republican Bradley Leo \"Brad\" Buckley (born 1966), a veterinarian who formerly served on the board of the Killeen School District. Cosper had led the three-candidate GOP field in 2016 with 4,472 (44.6 percent) to Buckley's 4,173 (41.6 percent). The remaining 1,390 votes (13.9 percent) went to Larry R. Smith, whose supporters were critical in the second round of balloting. Smith had also finished third in the 2016 primary. Cosper was then unseated in the runoff, 3,185 votes (41.7 percent) to Buckley's 4,445 (58.3 percent). ==References== ==External links== * Campaign website * State legislative page * Scott Cosper at the Texas Tribune Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Texas Republicans Category:Mayors of places in Texas Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:Baptists from Texas ",
