    "text": "igraph is a library collection for creating and manipulating graphs and analyzing networks. It is written in C and also exists as Python and R packages. There exists moreover an interface for Mathematica. The software is widely used in academic research in network science and related fields. The publication that introduces the software has 5623 citations as of according to Google Scholar. igraph was developed by G\u00e1bor Cs\u00e1rdi and Tam\u00e1s Nepusz. The source code of igraph packages was written in C. igraph is freely available under GNU General Public License Version 2. ==Basic properties== The three most important properties of igraph that shaped its development are as follows: * igraph is capable of handling large networks efficiently * it can be productively used with a high-level programming language * interactive and non-interactive usage are both supported ==Characteristics== The software is open source, source code can be downloaded from the project's GitHub page. There are several open source software packages that use igraph functions. As an example, R packages tnet, igraphtosonia and cccd depend on igraph R package. Users can use igraph on many operating systems. The C library and R and Python packages need the respective software, otherwise igraph is portable. the C library of igraph is well documentedhttp://igraph.org/c/doc/igraph-docs.pdf as well as the R packagehttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/igraph.pdf and the python package http://igraph.org/python/doc/python-igraph.pdf ==Functions== igraph can be used to generate graphs, compute centrality measures and path length based properties as well as graph components and graph motifs. It also can be used for Degree-preserving randomization. Igraph can read and write Pajek and GraphML files, as well as simple edge lists. The library contains several layout tools as well. ==References== Category:Free software ",
