    "text": "Amin Dora is a Film Director and Visual Artist born and raised in Zahle, Lebanon. He graduated with honors from ALBA (Acad\u00e9mie Libanaise des Beaux Arts), where he teaches. In 2011, Dora won an International Digital Emmy Award for Shankaboot, the world's first Arabic web drama series. Composed of 5-minute episodes, the series explores innovative ways of portraying real life in Beirut through the eyes of 15-year-old delivery boy Suleiman. By depicting tough issues and tackling taboo subjects that mainstream media wouldn't touch, Shankaboot successfully engaged young audiences across the region during the Arab Spring, inspiring discussions across social media networks and in the press. Dora's film career began with his stop motion animation short, Greyscale, which received many awards in national and international festivals, including the International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Bilbao (ZINEBI). Ghadi, his debut feature film, premiered at the Busan International Film Festival and won the prestigious KNN Audience Award. Following its release, Ghadi was selected as Lebanon's official entry for the 2014 Oscars. Ghadi won the audience award at the International Filmfestival Mannheim- Heidelberg 2014 and the audience award at the Arabian Sights Film Festival Washington 2014. ==References== Category:Lebanese directors Category:People from Zahle Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
