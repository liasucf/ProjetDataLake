The university offers ten varsity sports for women (soccer, field hockey, tennis, cross country, basketball, ice hockey, volleyball, softball, track and field, and lacrosse), eight for men (football, cross country, soccer, basketball, ice hockey, tennis, baseball, and lacrosse), and one co-ed sport (sailing). Sailing is governed by the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA), and its subdivision, the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association (NEISA). The school also offers men's and women's rugby, governed by the Colonial Coast Rugby Conference, USA Rugby and the International Rugby Board (IRB). The men's rugby program competes at the Division III level, and the women's program competes on the Division III level in the National Small College Rugby Organization (NSCRO). The university mascot is the Seahawk. ==History== Over the last eight seasons, the men's rugby team and the women's basketball team have enjoyed the greatest success, earning 8 conference championships, and 1 runner-up finishes in that time frame. In addition, the men's rugby, women's basketball, men's basketball, men's tennis, men\u2019s hockey and sailing teams have all competed in national collegiate championship tournaments. Although the sport does not permit easy comparisons with more traditional sports, the sailing team (co-ed) has been very successful against national powerhouse sailing programs. The teams are listed below with their record, winning percentage, number of athletes, and any notable achievements.
