John and his sister were evacuated during World War Two to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and in this period he began a lifelong interest in sculpture. Returning to England at the end of the war, he attended The Leys School in Cambridge, and then Magdalene College, Cambridge University, where he graduated in 1959 as a Bachelor of Arts with Honours and a Certificate in Education. In 1962, he was awarded an M.A. Honours at Cambridge where he initially read Geography, but after two years changed to Archaeology.Clegg, John K.
