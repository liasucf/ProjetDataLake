    "text": "Florida cracker style house Florida cracker architecture is a style of vernacular architecture typified by a wood-frame house. It was widespread in the 19th century and is still popular with some developers as a source of design themes. Florida cracker refers to colonial-era English pioneer settlers and their descendants. There was no air conditioning, and the new immigrants to the Sunshine State had to depend on nature to get some relief from the heat. Houses of this style are characterized by metal roofs, raised floors, and straight central hallways from the front to the back of the home (sometimes called \"dog trot\" or \"shotgun\" hallways, similar to the shotgun house design). They built their homes surrounded by wide verandas or porches, often wrapping around the entire home, to provide shade for their windows and walls. Some houses had a clerestory that would improve the ventilation in the interior. ==Examples== *Bensen House in Grant, Florida *Plumb House in Clearwater, Florida *Winchester Symphony House in Eau Gallie, Florida -- Clearly a bungalow, and possibly inappropriate here ==See also== * Architecture of the United States ==References== Cracker Houses ==External links== * * *Cracker House at A History of Central Florida Podcast Category:American architectural styles Category:Florida cracker culture Category:Vernacular architecture in Florida ",
