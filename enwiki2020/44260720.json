    "text": "Hedwig \"Hettie\" Ross (; 19001971) was a New Zealand-born Australian educator and political activist. She was a founding member of the Communist Party of New Zealand and a leader of the Australian Militant Woman's Group, a department of the Communist Party of Australia, and edited several Australian political publications including the Young Communist. Throughout her career, she was an advocate for the children of the poor, and argued for the centrality of education in raising their position in society.Sullivan, Martin (1996). \"Hettie Ross formerly Hedwig Weitzel.\" Hecate (St Lucia: Hecate Press) 22.1 127\u2013138. She died 26 October 1971 at Mortdale, Sydney. == Early life == Hedwig Ross was born Hedwig Weitzel on 17 September 1900 in New Zealand to German immigrants Friedrich Gustav Weitzel (a brassfounder and later a farmer) and Maria Weitzel n\u00e9e Benninghoven; they had three children born in Sydney 1888\u20131891. As a schoolgirl in Wellington she witnessed the 1913 Great Strike of New Zealand, where workers from several industries protested against working conditions and unfair dismissals.Sullivan, Martin (1996). \"Hettie Ross formerly Hedwig Weitzel.\" Hecate (St Lucia: Hecate Press) 22.1 127. In 1920, when she was only nineteen years old, she graduated from Wellington Girls' College after two years study with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Philosophy, due to her extraordinary intellect. Future New Zealand Prime Minister Peter Fraser said in the New Zealand House of Representatives in 1921 that \"she was wonderfully brilliant\u2014brilliant enough to graduate before reaching the age of twenty.\" Sullivan, Martine (1996) \"Hettie Ross formerly Hedwig Weitzel.\" Hecate (St Lucia: Hecate Press) 22.1 127. She would later return to receive a Diploma of Education at the University of Sydney.Sullivan, Martine (1996) \"Hettie Ross formerly Hedwig Weitzel.\" (St Lucia: Hecate Press) 22.1 133.' == Political activity in New Zealand == In 1921 while still at Wellington Girls' College Ross became a founding member of the Communist Party of New Zealand.Martin Sullivan, 'Ross, Hedwig (Hettie) (1900\u20131971)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/ross-hedwig- hettie-13176/text23851, published in hardcopy 2005, accessed online 31 October 2014. During this period she was an associate of Fintan Patrick Walsh, a prominent member of the Federated Seaman's Union of New Zealand who led several large scale strikes during the 1920s.Pat Walsh. 'Walsh, Fintan Patrick', from the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/biographies/4w4/walsh-fintan-patrick updated 1-Apr-2014 Walsh was also a co-founder of the Communist Party of New Zealand and he and Ross were rumoured to be lovers. In August 1921, her political activities led to her being convicted of selling seditious literature. Ross sold a copy of an Australian publication, the Communist, to an undercover policeman. It was future Prime Minister Peter Fraser, who was then a member of Parliament, who took up her case. Fraser had four years earlier been convicted of the same offense, and served twelve months jail time. He strongly believed that Ross, who he described as a \"young girl on the threshold of womanhood,\" was a victim of unfair police officiousness, and declared to parliament that \"the persecution of Miss Weitzel will rank in the history of New Zealand as one of the meanest and most contemptible episodes in our political life.\"Sullivan, Martin (1996). \"Hettie Ross formerly Hedwig Weitzel.\" Hecate (St Lucia: Hecate Press) 22.1 127\u2013128 However, his support failed to overrule her conviction, and Ross was expelled from Wellington Teachers' College where she was studying for her Diploma of Education. == Political and Union activity in Australia == Her father died in 1917, and her mother and two siblings emigrated to the United States in 1921, but she had difficulty getting a passport to follow them. She moved to Sydney in 1922; in Australia her communist views were more openly acceptable. She married Hector Ross in 1923. They divorced, childless, in 1931. She got a Diploma in Education from the University of Sydney in 1926 and taught in various Sydney schools until 1956 when she retired. She was active in the Communist Party and in the Woman Assistant Teachers Association of the Teachers Federation. She corresponded with Rewi Alley in China in 1956, and visited China in 1957. She suffered from Parkinsons disease in later life. == References == == External links == * Australian Dictionary of Biography: Ross, Hedwig (Hettie) (1900\u20131971) Category:New Zealand people of German descent Category:Australian people of German descent Category:New Zealand emigrants to Australia Category:New Zealand communists Category:Australian communists Category:1900 births Category:1971 deaths Category:20th-century Australian women ",
