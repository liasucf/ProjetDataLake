    "text": "The Golden Hits of Billy Eckstine is a 1963 studio album by the American singer Billy Eckstine. It was arranged by Billy Byers, conducted by Bobby Tucker, and produced by Quincy Jones. ==Reception== The Negro Digest positively reviewed the album in their September 1963 issue describing it as \"a superb album altogether\" and that the liner notes of the album were \"understated\" in their description of Eckstine as \"luxurious\" and having a \"strong sensual undercurrent\".
