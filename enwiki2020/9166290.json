    "text": "Ratu Sakiusa Tuisolia (born 15 June 1967) is a Fijian chief from the province of Naitasiri, an economist and businessman, and a former civil servant who served for seven years as an economist with the Ministry of Finance and National Planning, then another seven years as Chief Policy Adviser to three successive Fijian Prime Ministers and was also Deputy CEO in the Office of the Prime Minister. From 2003 to 2006, Tuisolia served as Chief Executive Officer of the government-owned Airports Fiji Limited. He was dismissed by the military administration a few days after seizing power on 5 December. He resisted his dismissal: \"If they (the Military) are planning to terminate me from my post, they dont have the power to do so, they have no legitimacy since they have illegally removed the elected Qarase Government. Only the AFL Board has the powers to remove me subject to my performance or a serious breach of the terms of my contract but the Board is very happy with my good performance and intends to renew my contract he said. When the Military accused him of \"financial discrepancies\", however, he reacted angrily, saying that was \"a total and blatant lie\". They are making these wild and falsified allegations to justify the coup. He accused the Military of conducting a witch hunt against him because he was known to be anti-coup and anti-military. Tuisolia turned around AFL from a loss making state enterprise into a very profitable one. In 2009, Tuisolia was appointed Pacific Ocean 2020 Coordinator by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. He is now a consultant with the Asian Development Bank in Manila, Philippines. Tuisolia has been married since 2003 to Imrana Jalal, a lawyer of Indian descent. She, too, was dismissed from civil service positions by the Military-backed interim government. == References == Category:Living people Category:Fijian chiefs Category:Fijian civil servants Category:1967 births Category:People from Naitasiri Province Category:Fijian businesspeople ",
