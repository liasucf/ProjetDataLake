The estate was created from land that had previously belonged to Antvorskov Abbey by Joachim Castenschiold in 1874 and it has since 1846 been owned by members of the Bech family. The current, Renaissance Revival style main building was built for August Willads Bech in 1855. It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1996. The estate covers 1,100 hectares of land. ==History== ===Church and crown kland=== In the Middle Ages the land belonged to Antvorskov Abbey. The abbey was confiscated by the Crown during the Reformation and Valbyg\u00e5rd was then turned into a royal fief. In 1703, Frederick converted Antvorskov into a countship for his mistress, Elisabeth Helene von Vieregg. When she shortly thereafter died in labour, Antvorskov was instead turned into a cavalry district. ===Castenschiold and von Stemann=== Joachim Castenschiold in 1779 In 1774, Antvorskov Cavalry Fistrict was divided into nine of manors and sold in auction. One of them, Valbyg\u00e5rd, which consisted of land from Wizt\u00f8gaard as well as 11 former farms in the villages of Store Valby and Vester Valby, was acquired by Joachim Melchior Holten Castenschiold. In 1776, he sold it to his older brother, J\u00f8rgen Frederik Castenschiold. He was a captain in the Crown Prince's Regiment but was in 1780 promoted to colonel and chamberlain. J\u00f8rgen Frederik Castenschiold ran into a number of obstacles in the management of his estate. In 1781, he struggled with a lack of animal feed and his livestock population was at the same time hit by decease. In 1783, the harvest failed. LPoul Christian Stemann In 1805, Castenschiold sold Valbyg\u00e5rd to Poul Christian von Stemann. He had previously owned the small Benzonsdal Manor from 1791 to 1800 and was from 1802 responsible for managing the holdings of Sor\u00f8 Academy. He had served as amtmand (prefect) of Sor\u00f8 County since 1798 and had showed himself a very industrious, masterful and active local official who attracted the attention of King Frederick VI. He took a profound interest in the management of his estates as well as the living conditions for the peasants on them. He collaborated with the owner of B\u00f8strup on draining Bild Lake, thereby increasing the area of his estate. In 1827, Stemann was appointed President of Danish Chancellery (Home Office) and Minister of Juridical Affairs- ===The Bech family=== August Willads Bech In 1846, Poul Christian von Stemann sold Valbyg\u00e5rd to August Willads Bech. In 1855, he also acquired Brorupgaard. Bech was married to Margrethe Rothe (1823\u201386), a daughter of counter admiral and former governor of the Danish West Indies Carl Adolph Rothe. The old, half-timbered main building was very neglected and Bech, therefore, chose to replace it with a new main building in 1853-1855. The new building was designed by his cousin and close friend, Albert Winstrup (1815\u201389), who was an architect. The new main building in 1860 Valbyg\u00e5rd depicted by Ferdinand Richardt in 1861 He was like his predecessor also interested and agriculture and also improved the management of the estate. His initiatives included the planting of conifer, beech and oak plantations. In 1866, he arranged two agricultural shows in Sor\u00f8 and Pr\u00e6st\u00f8 which raised 55.000 Danish rigsdaler for wounded soldiers and those left behind by fallen soldiers of the Second Schleswig War. He created an extensive collection of antiquities from the area and was also the owner of a significant collection of Italian paintings and sculptures. Caroline Charlotte Suhr painted by Henrik Olrik in 1876 August Willads Bech's eldest son, J\u00f8rgen Peter Bech, inherited Valbyg\u00e5rd after his father's death in 1877. His mother, Margrethe Bech, kept Borupg\u00e5rd until her death in 1886.J\u00f8rgen Peter Bech was married to Caroline Charlotte Suhr, a daughter of Ole Berendt Suhr and thus a cousin on his mother's side. Bech was director of Den Suhrske Stiftelse from 1893 to 1908. J\u00f8rgen Peter Bech passed away in 1909 and Valbyg\u00e5rd then passed to their son August Villads Bech. August Villads Bech seceded his father as director of Den Suhrske Stiftelse and was also chairman of Sparekassen for Slagelse og Omegn. Valbyg\u00e5rd was after August Villads Bech's death passed to his son, J\u00f8rgen Peter Bech. August Villads Bech's widow remained on the estate until her death ==Architecture== The main building is a two storey building with Dutch gables, bay windows and verandas. The bricks were manufactured at the estate's own kiln from 1847. A library extension was in 1884 constructed for J\u00f8rgen Peter Bech at the western gable of the main building. ==List of owners== * ( \u20131774) The Crown * (1774\u20131776) Joachim Melchior Holten Castenschiold * (1776\u20131805) J\u00f8rgen Frederik Castenschiold * (1805\u20131846) Poul Christian von Stemann * (1846\u20131877) August Willads Bech * (1877\u20131909) J\u00f8rgen Peter Bech * (1909\u20131940) August Villads Bech * (1940\u20131972) J\u00f8rgen Peter Bech * (1972\u20132007) August Villads Bech * (2007\u2013present) J\u00f8rgen Peter Bech == References == Category:Manor houses in Slagelse Municipality Category:Listed castles and manor houses in Denmark Category:Buildings and structures associated with the Castenschiold family Category:Houses completed in 1855 ",
