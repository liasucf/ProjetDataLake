She said the recruiter was kind and generous promising her a legitimate job that would enable her to quickly pay off the $4,800 loan she secured from the recruiter to pay for the plane ticket and processing fee to the United States. Elsewhere in Thailand, many others were hearing the same story. They were taken to the airport and given expensive jewelry to wear so that they would appear to be wealthy tourists. Having passed the Immigration Control, the recruiters took the jewelry, their passports and their money. They transported the workers to the El Monte complex\u2014a row of two story buildings with boarded up windows and a fence surrounding the entire compound topped with barbed wire and spikes facing inward.Monroe, Julie and Kent Wong (eds). \u201cSweatshop Slaves: Asian Americans in the Garment Industry\u201d, P. 93, UCLA Center for Labor Research and Education, Los Angeles.
