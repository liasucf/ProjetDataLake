It premiered on Tencent on February 21, 2018. ==Synopsis== During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the Dugu family was the focus of world attention to the well-known \"Dugu prophecy\" given to Yuwen Tai that states the true king is not yet set and the Dugu family will be the key to ruling the world. The head of the Dugu family, Dugu Xin was concerned. Two of the Dugu sisters thought they would be the ones to fulfill the prophecy. The eldest sister Dugu Banruo is wise and ambitious. She loves the fierce general Yuwen Hu, but marries the weak Emperor Yuwen Yu to fulfill the prophecy. Banruo dies while giving birth to her son with Yuwen Yu. She previously had a daughter whom she entrusts to her sister, Dugu Jialuo. Her daughter is raised as Yang Lihua and marries Emperor Xuan. She and her daughter Lihua were both Empresses of Northern Zhou. The second daughter Dugu Mantuo is greedy and also ambitious. She yearns to become Empress too just like her older sister because of her low status. Mantuo refuses the advances of Yang Jian and wanted to instead wed her younger sister's fianc\u00e9. Unexpectedly, she ends up marrying the father of her sister's fianc\u00e9, Li Bing. Her son with Li Bing would later become Li Yuan, the founding Emperor of the Tang dynasty. Mantuo would be honored as Empress Yuanzhen after her death. The youngest daughter Dugu Jialuo is gentle and virtuous. She originally had feelings for Yuwen Yong, but their relationship doesn't last. She becomes the fianc\u00e9e of Li Cheng, but their arrangement is broken off after Mantuo is married to Li Cheng's father. Jialuo marries Yang Jian and eventually falls in love with him. He swore to only love her, and they have several children together. Despite Jialuo's dislike for politics, they founded the Sui Dynasty together. She would become Empress Dugu of Sui. All three marry into royalty, but each have a different destiny and fate. All of them end up becoming Empresses or Empress Dowagers of three different dynasties. In the end, the Dugu prophecy didn't only mean a person, but instead meant Dugu blood would rule the world. ==Cast== ===Northern Zhou=== ====Dugu family==== * Hu Bingqing as Dugu Jialuo (Qieluo), Empress Wenxian of Sui. ** Youngest daughter of the Dugu family.
