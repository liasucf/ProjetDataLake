    "text": "Albert Bielschowsky ([bi:l\u0161ofski]; January 3, 1847 - October 21, 1902) was a German literary historian (Literaturwissenschaftler). He is known for his writings concerning Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Bielschowsky was born in Namslau (Namys\u0142\u00f3w), Prussian Silesia, into a family of Jewish merchants. He studied philology in Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw) and Berlin. Because Bielschowsky's work on Goethe was cut short by his death in Berlin, the series was completed by Theobald Ziegler. == Literary works == *Goethe. Sein Leben und seine Werke, 2 vols. Munich: C.
