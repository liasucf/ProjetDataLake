Above the ponderosa pine appear. Most pine trees are found on the cooler north facing slopes. The habitat is mainly forest, and has many natural springs. The ecology of the Hualapai Mountains is comparable to that of the San Bernardino Mountains and San Jacinto Mountains in southern California, with major forests of many conifer species, as well as aspen groves at higher elevations. The higher elevations of the Hualapai Mountains support Madrean Sky Islands habitats. Bear, elk, mule deer, mountain lion, javelina, and other animals can be found here. Mountain lion and bear have been drawn to civilized areas like Pinion Pines and Atherton Acres due to the large deer population. There are some animals only native to the Hualapai Mountain range, including a breed of ground squirrel, and tarantula.Bartlett Pesek, Margo. \"Hualapai Mountains provide recreation opportunities\", LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL, 8 August 2010.
