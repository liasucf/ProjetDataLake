    "text": "ID Quantique (IDQ) is a Swiss company, based in Geneva, Switzerland, and provides quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, quantum safe network encryption, single photon counters, and hardware random number generators. It was founded in 2001 as a spin-off of the Group of Applied Physics at the University of Geneva. The company is structured in three business units: * The quantum safe cryptography division * The photon counting division * The quantum random number generation division == Quantum Safe Cryptography Division == The Quantum Safe Cryptography division focuses on data protection and provides: * quantum-safe network encryption solutions * quantum key distribution solutions * quantum key generation and key management solutions == Photon Counting Division == The Photon Counting division works on optical instrumentation products such as: * photon counters in the visible and infrared spectrum * photon pair sources * quantum key distribution for R&D; applications == Random Number Generation == The company's work in Random Number Generation focuses on developing hardware random number generators based on quantum randomness, for cryptographic and security applications (quantum key generation) and research purposes (MonteCarlo simulations). == ID Quantique Achievements == The company has realized several world premieres in quantum technology innovation. * In 2004, ID Quantique was one of the first in the world to bring a quantum key distribution system to a commercial market. (MagiQ Technologies, Inc. announced the availability of its quantum key distribution system in 2003.)Although the commercial availability was announced earlier, the first orders were shipped to customers around 2004. * In 2007 quantum cryptography was deployed by a government for the first time ever to protect the Geneva state elections in Switzerland. It is still in deployment. * In 2010 the company deployed QKD over multiplexed networks with 1Gbit/s of data, and in 2011 the company ran its QKD systems for over 18 months in the Swissquantumhttp://crypto.junod.info/2011/12/02/looking-back-to- the-swissquantum-project/ network in cooperation with the University of Geneva. * In 2014, principles from IDQ together with the University of Geneva, broke the world record for the longest distance key exchange by QKD \u2013 307 km. * In 2014 IDQ\u2019s Quantis true random number generator became the first QRNG to pass the German BSI\u2019s AIS31 randomness validation. * In 2014 ID Quantique and Battelle co-founded the Quantum-Safe Security Working Group in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA). The group aims to help governments and industry understand quantum\u2010safe methods for protecting their networks and their data, following the call by the European telecommunications Institute (ETSI) for quantum safe cryptography in their 2014 white paper \u201cQuantum Safe Cryptography and Security\u201d.https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2014/201410_CRYPTO/Quantum_Safe_Whitepaper_1_0_0.pdf * ID Quantique also announced their Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) chip has been integrated in the \u2018Vsmart Aris 5G\u2019 smartphone made by VinSmart, a member of Vingroup from Vietnam.ID Quantique integrates its quantum chip in Vsmart Aris 5G Smartphone ID Quantique. 23rd July 2020 == See also == * Quantum key distribution * Quantum cryptography * Hardware random number generator == Notes == == External links == * Website of the company Category:Cryptography companies Category:Software companies of Switzerland Category:Companies based in Geneva Category:Quantum cryptography ",
