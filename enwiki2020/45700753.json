    "text": "Ubuntu MATE (pronounced 'U-bun-tu Ma-tay') is a free and open-source Linux distribution and an official derivative of Ubuntu. Its main differentiation from Ubuntu is that it uses the MATE desktop environment as its default user interface (based on GNOME 2), instead of the GNOME 3 desktop environment that is the default user interface for Ubuntu. == History == The Ubuntu MATE project was founded by Martin Wimpress and Alan Pope and began as an unofficial derivative of Ubuntu, using an Ubuntu 14.10 base for its first release; a 14.04 LTS release followed shortly. As of February 2015, Ubuntu MATE gained the official Ubuntu flavour status from Canonical Ltd. as per the release of 15.04 Beta 1. In addition to IA-32 and x86-64 which were the initial supported platforms, Ubuntu MATE also supports PowerPC and ARMv7 (on the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 as well as the ODROID XU4). In April 2015, Ubuntu MATE announced a partnership with British computer reseller Entroware, enabling Entroware customers to purchase desktop and laptop computers with Ubuntu MATE preinstalled with full support. Several other hardware deals were announced later. In Ubuntu MATE 18.10, 32-bit support was dropped.Dropping 32-bit support, DistroWatch == Releases == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#a0e75a;\"| Current release | style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:salmon;\"| Release no longer supported | style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:gold;\"| Release still supported | style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:skyBlue;\"| Future release |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The project is providing a very friendly desktop experience that requires few hardware resources by modern standards. I also want to tip my hat to the default theme used on Ubuntu MATE.\" As of August 2017, Ubuntu MATE ranked at 24 on the DistroWatch 6 month page hit ranking. Dedoimedo reviewed Ubuntu MATE in July 2018, and wrote that \"[Ubuntu MATE offers] a wealth of visual and functional changes ... You really have the ability to implement anything and everything, and all of it natively, from within the system's interface.\". == See also == * Comparison of Linux distributions * GTK+ * Linux Mint * MATE * Ubuntu GNOME * Ubuntu Unity * Xubuntu == References == == External links == * * Category:IA-32 Linux distributions Category:Linux distributions Category:Operating system distributions bootable from read-only media Category:Ubuntu derivatives Category:X86-64 Linux distributions ",
