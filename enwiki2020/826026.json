    "text": "First edition (publ. Bantam Books) Cover art by Broeck Steadman Noir is a science fiction novel by K. W. Jeter, published in 1998.K. W. Jeter, Noir, 1998, It uses the conventions of film noir \u2013 the alienated, doomed hero, the cynical private detective, the femme fatale, universal corruption and moral breakdown \u2013 to portray a dystopian vision of capitalism run riot. Even the monochrome visual style of film noir is a factor in Noir, as the hero has had his eyes specially treated to show the world as a black-and-white movie, altering his perception of people and objects around him so they fit into the aesthetic. The hero is a detective named McNihil who is hired by corporate executives ostensibly to investigate the death of one of their colleagues. The book is set in the Pacific Fringe \u2013 the only remaining industrialised part of the world \u2013 in a society where free market capitalism holds absolute sway. Even the dead, including the hero's wife, can be brought back to life as slave labour if they fail to meet their financial obligations. The internet has evolved radically so that emails can be seen fluttering around the recipient and pestering for attention, while strange online sexual experiences can be had through electronic surrogates called prowlers. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 American novels Category:1998 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels by K.
