    "text": "The UST Golden Tigresses women's volleyball is the intercollegiate women's volleyball program of the University of Santo Tomas. Formed in the same year of the sports' inception in 1938, the Tigresses are the second winningest team in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) with 16 titles behind Far Eastern University's 29 championships. ==History== The Tigresses won their first championship in Season 37 (1974) and went on to achieve a three-peat in the succeeding seasons. They won for seven consecutive years from Season 47 (1984) until Season 53 (1990). They also have the third most final four appearances with 18, behind FEU's 22 and the De La Salle Lady Spikers' 20. They last won the UAAP Championship in Season 72 after defeating La Salle in the finals. They in turn lost to the Lady Spikers in two finals games the following year with Game One ending in a thrilling five-set match. The Golden Tigresses barged back to the finals in Season 81 (2018), after defeating La Salle twice\u2014for the #2 twice-to-beat play-off seeding and then in the semifinal game that resulted in a showdown with the #1-seeded Ateneo Lady Eagles. The Tigresses ended up as runners-up, losing to Ateneo in the best-of- three finals, 1-2. The Golden Tigresses, who used to be called the Lady Spikers also have the most titles won among collegiate teams in the Premier Volleyball League with six, beginning at the inaugural tournament in 2004 when the league was still known as the Shakey's V-League. They also have six UNIGAMES Women's volleyball championships, beginning in 2009 and capped by a three-peat from 2016 until 2018. The Tigresses finished third in 2019 after defeating the NU Lady Bulldogs in three straight sets. They lost to the College of St. Benilde Lady Blazers in their semifinals match which ended their championship streak in the annual tournament. The Tigresses also joined the Philippine Super Liga's 2018 Collegiate Grand Slam Conference and ended up as runners-up to the eventual champions, the UP Lady Maroons after topping the elimination round with an undefeated record of 5-0. ==Rivalries== The UST Golden Tigresses and the FEU Lady Tamaraws met in the finals for a total of 18 seasons, with UST winning 15 times. The rivalry between the De La Salle Lady Spikers and the Tigresses has also been apparent in women's volleyball with the two teams being frequent finalists in the UAAP Volleyball Championships, the UNIGAMES and the Shakey's V-League. The two teams met four times in the UAAP finals, with La Salle winning three. They also faced each other thrice in the finals of the Shakey's V-League, with UST winning the first and the Lady Spikers winning the latter two. The Tigresses have also defeated the La Salle thrice in the UNIGAMES finals. == Current roster == {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\" !colspan=7 style=\"\"| UAAP Season 82 roster |- ! No. ! Pos. !
