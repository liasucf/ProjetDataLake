    "text": "Cairns (, ) is a city in Queensland, Australia, on the east coast of Far North Queensland. The city is the 5th-most-populous in Queensland, and 14th in Australia. Cairns was founded in 1876 and named after Sir William Wellington Cairns, the Governor of Queensland from 1875 to 1877. It was formed to serve miners heading for the Hodgkinson River goldfield, but declined when an easier route was discovered from Port Douglas. It later developed into a railhead and major port for exporting sugar cane, gold, minerals and agricultural products from surrounding coastal areas and the Atherton Tableland. The estimated population in 2018 was 152,729, Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. having grown on average 1.1% annually in the preceding five years. Cairns is a popular tourist destination because of its tropical climate and access to tropical rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef, one of the seven natural wonders of the world. ==History== Prior to British settlement, the Cairns area was inhabited by the Gimuy Walubara Yidinji people, who still claim their Native Title rights. Yidinji (also known as Yidinj, Yidiny, and Idindji) is an Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional language region is within the local government areas of Cairns Region and Tablelands Region, in such localities as Cairns, Gordonvale, and the Mulgrave River, and the southern part of the Atherton Tableland including Atherton and Kairi. The area is known in the local Yidiny language as Gimuy. 1874 map showing native wells situated within the future site of Cairns From 1770 to the early 1870s the area was known to the British simply as Trinity Bay. The arrival of beche de mer fishermen from the late 1860s saw the first European presence in the area. On the site of the modern-day Cairns foreshore, there was a large native well which was used by these fishermen. A violent confrontation occurred in 1872 between local Yidinji people and Phillip Garland, a beche de mer fisherman, over the use of this well. The area from this date was subsequently called Battle Camp. In 1876, hastened by the need to export gold mined from the Hodgkinson goldfields on the tablelands to the west, closer investigation by several official expeditions established its potential for development into a port. Brinsley G. Sheridan surveyed the area and selected a place further up Trinity Inlet known to the diggers as Smith's Landing for a settlement which he renamed Thornton. However, after Native Police officers Alexander Douglas- Douglas and Robert Arthur Johnstone opened a new track from the goldfields to Battle Camp, this more coastal site became preferable. Battle Camp was renamed Cairns in late 1876 in honour of the then Governor of Queensland, William Cairns. The site was predominantly mangrove swamps and sand ridges. Labourers gradually cleared the swamps, and the sand ridges were filled with dried mud, sawdust from local sawmills, and ballast from a quarry at Edge Hill. Farm in Cairns in 1897 Cairns War Memorial, circa 1936 Debris from the construction of a railway to Herberton on the Atherton Tableland, a project which started in 1886, was also used. The railway opened up land later used for agriculture on the lowlands (sugar cane, corn, rice, bananas, pineapples), and for fruit and dairy production on the Tableland. The success of local agriculture helped establish Cairns as a port, and the creation of a harbour board in 1906 supported its robust economic future. The Wharf Estate Cairns went on sale in Brisbane via auction on 19 February 1889 by John Macnamara & Co. Land Auctioneers. The land was part of the place known as the Railway Reserve. The sale was described by the Auctioneers as the 'largest ever yet held in Northern Queensland'. On 25 April 1926 (ANZAC Day), the Cairns Sailors and Soldiers War Memorial was unveiled by Alexander Frederick Draper, the mayor of the City of Cairns. During World War II, the Allied Forces used Cairns as a staging base for operations in the Pacific, with United States Army Air Forces and Royal Australian Air Force operational bases (now the airport), as well as a major military seaplane base in Trinity Inlet, and United States Navy and Royal Australian Navy bases near the current wharf. Combat missions were flown out of Cairns in support of the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942. Edmonton and White Rock south of Cairns were major military supply areas and U.S. Paratroopers trained at Gordonvale and the Goldsborough Valley. A Special Forces training base was established at the old \"Fairview\" homestead on Munro's Hill, Mooroobool. This base was officially known as the Z Experimental Station, but referred to informally as \"The House on the Hill\". After World War II, Cairns gradually developed into a centre for tourism. The opening of the Cairns International Airport in 1984 helped establish the city as a desirable destination for international tourism. ==Population== According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 144,787 people in Cairns (Significant Urban Area). * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 8.9% of the population. * 67.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.0%, New Zealand 3.1%, Papua New Guinea 1.5%, Philippines 1.2% and Japan 1.1%. * 76.9% of people only spoke English at home.

The Mulgrave River running through the Goldsbrough Valley to the south of Gordonvale. Fruit bats hanging from a mango tree, central Cairns Cairns is located on the east coast of Cape York Peninsula on a coastal strip between the Coral Sea and the Great Dividing Range. The northern part of the city is located on Trinity Bay and the city centre is located on Trinity Inlet. To the south of the Trinity Inlet lies the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah. Some of the city's suburbs are located on flood plains. The Mulgrave River and Barron River flow within the greater Cairns area but not through the CBD. The city's centre foreshore is located on a mud flat. ===Urban layout=== City centre of Cairns Cairns is a provincial city, with a linear urban layout that runs from the south at Edmonton to the north at Ellis Beach. The city is approximately from north to south; it has experienced a recent urban sprawl, with suburbs occupying land once used for sugar cane farming. The Northern Beaches consist of a number of beach communities extending north along the coast. In general, each beach suburb is at the end of a spur road extending from the Captain Cook Highway. From south to north, these are Machans Beach, Holloways Beach, Yorkeys Knob, Trinity Park, Trinity Beach, Kewarra Beach, Clifton Beach, Palm Cove, and Ellis Beach. The suburb of Smithfield is inland against the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, between Yorkeys Knob and Trinity Park. It serves as the main hub for the Northern Beaches, with a modern shopping arcade, called Smithfield Shopping Centre. South of Smithfield and inland from the Northern Beaches along the edge of the Barron River flood plain are the suburbs of Caravonica, Kamerunga, Freshwater, and Stratford. This area is sometimes referred to as Freshwater Valley, though it is actually the lower part of Redlynch Valley; further up the valley are the suburbs of Redlynch, on the western side of Redlynch Valley, and Brinsmead on the eastern side. Stratford, Freshwater, and Brinsmead are separated from Cairns city by Mount Whitfield (elevation ) and Whitfield Range. Crystal Cascades and Copperlode Falls Dam are also behind this range. (Kuranda, a town on the Barron River on the western side of the Macalister Range, forms part of the Cairns economic catchment but is in the Tablelands local government area and is not part of the Cairns urban area.) The city centre of Cairns is adjacent to the suburbs of Cairns North, and Parramatta Park, Bungalow, Portsmith, and close to Westcourt, Manunda, Manoora, Edge Hill, Whitfield, Kanimbla, City View, Mooroobool, Earlville, Woree and Bayview Heights. The small suburb of Aeroglen is pressed between Mount Whitfield and the airport, on the Captain Cook Highway between Cairns North and Stratford. Southside Cairns, situated in a narrow area between Trinity Inlet to the east and Lamb Range to the west, includes the suburbs of White Rock, Mount Sheridan, Bentley Park and Edmonton. The townships of Goldsborough, Little Mulgrave, and Aloomba are near Gordonvale, on the Mulgrave River. This area is serviced by the Bruce Highway. Several other small towns and communities within Cairns' jurisdiction are sparsely located along the Bruce highway, the furthest being Bramston Beach, Queensland| south of Cairns city; the largest of these townships is Babinda, about from the city. ===Climate=== Tropical beach in Cairns Cairns experiences a tropical climate, specifically a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. A wet season with heavy monsoonal downpours runs from November to May, with a relatively dry season from June to October, though light showers can occur during this period. Cairns' mean annual rainfall is just under , although monthly totals in the wet season (Dec\u2013Mar) can exceed , with the highest rainfall being recorded in any month in January 1981, where over of rain fell. Babinda, a town to the south of the city, is Australia's wettest town, recording an annual rainfall of over . Cairns has hot, humid summers and warm winters. Mean maximum temperatures vary from in July to in January. Monsoonal activity during the wet season occasionally causes major flooding of the Barron and Mulgrave Rivers, cutting off-road and rail access to the city. Cairns has 89.7 clear days, annually. Dewpoint in the wet season (summer) averages at . The average temperature of the sea ranges from in July to in January. ====Tropical cyclones==== Like most of North and Far North Queensland, Cairns is prone to tropical cyclones, usually forming between November and May. Notable cyclones that have affected the Cairns region include: * Cyclone Yasi, 2011 * Cyclone Larry, 2006 * Cyclone Abigail, 2001 * Cyclone Steve, 2000 * Cyclone Rona, 1999 * Cyclone Justin, 1997 ==Facilities== The City Library, operated by the Cairns Regional Council, opened in 1979 and is situated at 151 Abbott Street. A major refurbishment was undertaken in 1999 and a further minor refurbishment was implemented in 2011. Public accessible wifi is available. Current Library services and collections can be accessed from the Cairns Libraries website. ==Heritage listings== Cairns has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Cairns-to-Kuranda railway line * Abbott Street: Dr EA Koch Memorial * Abbott Street: Barrier Reef Hotel * Abbott Street: Bishop's House * Abbott Street: St Monica's High School Administration Building * 6A-8A Abbott Street: former Cairns Customs House * 38 \u2013 40 Abbott Street: Cairns Court House * 151 Abbott Street: Cairns City Council Chambers * 179 Abbott Street: St Joseph's Convent * 183 Abbott Street: St Monica's War Memorial Cathedral * Collins Avenue, Edge Hill: Flecker Botanical Gardens * Collins Avenue, Edge Hill: WWII RAN Fuel Installation * Grafton Street: Cairns Control Room, World War II Volunteer Defence Corps * 99 Grafton Street: former Cairns Chinatown * Lake Street: Bolands Centre * 37 Lake Street: former Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd Building * 39 \u2013 49 Lake Street: former Central Hotel * 87 Lake Street: Hides Hotel * 93\u2013105 Lake Street: former School of Arts * 399 Kamerunga Road, Redlynch: Xavier and Sadie Herbert's Cottage * 127\u2013145 McLeod Street, Cairns North: McLeod Street Pioneer Cemetery * 180 McLeod, Cairns North: Herries Private Hospital * Minnie Street: St Monica's Old Cathedral * 8 Minnie Street: Cairns Masonic Temple * Sheridan Street, Cairns North: Cairns Technical College and High School Building * The Esplanade: Cairns War Memorial * 51 The Esplanade: former Mulgrave Shire Council Chambers * 183\u2013185 The Esplanade, Cairns North: Floriana * Wharf Street: Cairns Wharf Complex * 29 Wharf Street: former Jack and Newell Building ==Governance== The Lagoon on the Cairns Esplanade on the left, separated by the boardwalk from the ocean on the right, at low tide Cairns is part of the Cairns Region local government area which is governed by a Regional Council. The Council consists of a directly elected mayor and 10 councillors, elected from 10 single-member divisions (or wards) using an optional preferential voting system. Elections are held every four years. The Cairns Region consists of three former local government areas. The first was the original City of Cairns, consisting of the Cairns City region as listed above. The second, which was amalgamated in 1995, was the Shire of Mulgrave (comprising the other areas, namely the Northern Beaches, Redlynch Valley and Southside). The town of Gordonvale was once called Nelson. The third area is the Shire of Douglas, which amalgamated in 2008 during major statewide local government reforms. At the time of the 1995 amalgamation, Cairns City had a population of approximately 40,000 and Mulgrave Shire had a population of approximately 60,000. Both local government authorities had chambers in the Cairns CBD. The old Cairns City Council chambers has been converted into a new city library. In a controversial decision, new Council chambers were constructed on previously contaminated land in the mainly industrial suburb of Portsmith. Cairns has three representatives in the Queensland Parliament, from the electoral districts of Barron River, Cairns and Mulgrave. The city is represented in the Federal Parliament by representatives elected from the districts of Leichhardt and Kennedy. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\" ! colspan=3|Cairns Regional CouncilCairns Regional Council Mayor and Councilors |- | style=\"text-align:center\"|Division || style=\"text- align:center\"|Councillor |- | Mayor || Bob Manning |- | 1 || Brett Moller |- | 2 || Rob Pyne |- | 3 || Cathy Zeiger |- | 4 || Terry James |- | 5 || Amy Eden |- | 6 || Kristy Vallely |- | 7 || Max O'Halloran |- | 8 || Rhonda Coghlan |- | 9 || Brett Olds |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\" ! colspan=4|Queensland2015 Queensland State Election Results |- | style=\"text- align:center\"|District || style=\"text-align:center\"|Member of Parliament || style=\"text-align:center\"|Party || style=\"text-align:center\"|Term |- | Barron River || Craig Crawford || Labor || 2015\u2013 |- | Cairns || Michael Healy || Labor || 2017\u2013 |- | Mulgrave || Curtis Pitt || Labor || 2009\u2013 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\" ! colspan=4|Australia |- | style=\"text-align:center\"|Division || style=\"text-align:center\"|Member of Parliament || style=\"text-align:center\"|Party || style=\"text- align:center\"|Term |- | Kennedy || Bob Katter || Katter's Australian || 1993\u2013 |- | Leichhardt || Warren Entsch || Liberal National || 2010\u2013 |} ==Economy== Cairns at night; the wharves. The casino's dome can be seen in the background. Cairns Pier Cairns serves as the major commercial centre for the Far North Queensland and Cape York Peninsula Regions. It is a base for the regional offices of various government departments. ===Tourism=== Tourism plays a major part in the Cairns economy. According to Tourism Australia, the Cairns region is the fourth-most-popular destination for international tourists in Australia after Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. While the city does not rank amongst Australia's top 10 destinations for domestic tourism, it attracts a significant number of Australian holiday makers despite its distance from major capitals. There is also a growing interest in Cairns from the Chinese leisure market with regular scheduled direct flights from Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou. During the 2013 Chinese Lunar New Year period alone, Cairns saw 20,000 Chinese holidaymakers flying in on chartered flights. The city is near the Great Barrier Reef, the Wet Tropics of Queensland, and the Atherton Tableland. Great Barrier Reef tours that operate from Cairns are very popular and hence Cairns is also considered as the gateway to Great Barrier Reef. The Cairns esplanade includes a swimming lagoon with adjoining barbecue areas. In May 2003, the then Cairns Mayor Kevin Byrne declared that topless sunbathing is permitted here. Many leisure activities are conducted in this area, including flea market, sports classes and many more. ===Commercial=== Several shopping centres of various sizes are located throughout Cairns. The largest of these are Cairns Central shopping centre, located in the central business district (CBD), and Stockland Cairns, located in the suburb of Earlville. In Westcourt, one of the city's oldest shopping centres has been refurbished, with the city's first DFO. To service the needs of suburbs further from the city centre, shopping complexes are also located at Mount Sheridan, Redlynch, Smithfield, and Clifton Beach. In 2010, the state government opened the second stage of William McCormack Place, an A$80 million office building credited as the first 6-star green star-rated building in the city. ===Media=== The Cairns Post is a daily newspaper published in the city; a weekly paper, The Cairns Sun, is also published. The Courier-Mail is a daily Queensland-wide newspaper published in Brisbane. The Australian newspaper also circulates widely. The Cairns Bulletin is an independent newspaper in circulation in the Cairns area. Cairns is served by five television stations, three commercial television stations (WIN Television, Seven Queensland and Southern Cross Nine) which are regional affiliates of the three Australian commercial television networks (Ten, Seven and Nine), and public broadcasters the ABC and SBSRegional digital TV timetable , Australian Government services. All three main commercial networks produce local news coverage - Seven Queensland and WIN Television both air 30-minute local news bulletins at 6pm each weeknight, produced from newsrooms in the city but broadcast from studios in Maroochydore and Wollongong respectively. Southern Cross Nine airs a regional Queensland edition of Nine News from Brisbane each weeknight at 6pm, featuring local opt-outs for Cairns and Far North Queensland. Cairns radio stations include a number of public, commercial and community broadcasters. The ABC broadcasts ABC Far North, ABC Radio National, ABC NewsRadio, ABC Classic FM and the Triple J youth network. Commercial radio stations include Star 102.7, 4CA 846 AM, Hot FM, Sea FM and 104.3 4TAB sports radio, while the community radio stations are 4CCR-FM, 101.9 Coast FM, Orbit FM 88.0FM & 87.8FM and 4CIM 98.7FM. ===Industry and agriculture=== The land around Cairns is still used for sugar cane farming, although this land is increasingly under pressure from new suburbs as the city grows. The Mulgrave Sugar Mill is located in Gordonvale (). The Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station is located nearby on the lower Barron River, and provides green power for some of the city's needs. ==Transport== Cairns is an important transport hub in the Far North Queensland region. Located at the base of Cape York Peninsula, it provides important transport links between the Peninsula and Gulf of Carpentaria regions, and the areas to the south of the state. Cairns International Airport is essential to the viability of the area's tourism industry. ===Roads=== The Bruce Highway in Cairns southern suburbs at morning peak hour. The Bruce Highway runs for from Bald Hills on the City of Brisbane's northern boundary, and terminates in Woree, a southern suburb in Cairns. The Captain Cook Highway (also referred as the Cook Highway) commences at Aeroglen, a northern suburb of Cairns, and runs for approximately northwest to Mossman. A need for future upgrades to the Bruce Highway to motorway standards through the southern suburbs to Gordonvale has been identified in regional planning strategies to cope with increasing congestion from rapid population growth. This will result in overpasses at all major intersections from Woree to Gordonvale. The motorway will divert from Bentley Park to Gordonvale, bypassing Edmonton to reduce the effects of road noise on residential areas. The Kennedy Highway commences at Smithfield on the Barron River flood plain north of Cairns, and ascends the Macalister Range to the township of Kuranda. The highway then extends to the town of Mareeba on the Atherton Tableland, and continues to communities of Cape York Peninsula. The Gillies Highway commences at the township of Gordonvale, and ascends the Gillies Range (part of the Great Dividing Range) to the town of Atherton on the Atherton Tableland, passing through the township of Yungaburra on the way. The controversial private road, Quaid Road, was constructed in 1989 through what is now a Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, and links Wangetti, on the coast just north of Cairns, to Southedge, just south of Mount Molloy. The road is not open to the public and is not used for general traffic. ===Bus=== A public bus transit network exists within the city, with two transit hubs located within the CBD: the Cairns Central Railway Station precinct, and the Cairns City Bus Station located within the Lake street and Shield street area, through which all bus lines operate and provide linkage to taxi, ride share and intercity rail services. The transit network includes most parts of the city, from Palm Cove in the north, Gordonvale in the south and Redlynch to the west. It is managed throughout the city by Translink: through a service contract with the Sunbus Cairns company, however the Go Card ticketing system has not been implemented in the region. A smaller shuttle bus service, Jon's Kuranda Bus runs between Cairns and Kuranda alongside other private coach services. Cairns is served by long-distance coaches to Brisbane, and regional cities to the south. Coaches also operate west to Mount Isa via Townsville, and to Alice Springs and Darwin in the Northern Territory. ===Taxis and transportation network companies=== Cairns also has a major taxi company, Cairns Taxis, which services the Cairns region. Uber was introduced to the region in March 2017, servicing the greater region. Ola launched in February 2020. ===Rail=== Railway workers on the Cairns Railway with a view of Glacier Rock in the background, ca. 1891.The Cairns Range Railway was built to connect the mining centre of Herberton with Cairns. Work began on 10 May 1886; the first sod was turned in Cairns by Samuel Griffith, Premier of Queensland, and the first train arrived in Herberton on 20 October 1910 (Information taken from: A.D. Broughton, A pictorial history of the construction of the Cairns Range Railway, 1886\u20131891, 1991). Cairns railway station is the terminus for Queensland's North Coast railway line, which follows the eastern seaboard from Brisbane. Services are operated by Queensland Rail (QR) and include the high- speed Diesel Tilt Train. Freight trains also operate along the route, with a QR Freight handling facility located at Portsmith. Pacific National Queensland (a division of Pacific National, owned by Asciano Limited) operates a rail siding at Woree. It runs private trains on the rail network owned by the Queensland State Government and managed by QR's Network Division. The Kuranda Scenic Railway operates from Cairns. The tourist railway ascends the Macalister Range and is not used for commuter services. It passes through the suburbs of Stratford, Freshwater (stopping at Freshwater Station) and Redlynch before reaching Kuranda. Freight services to Forsayth were discontinued in the mid-1990s. These were mixed freight and passenger services that served the semi-remote towns west of the Great Dividing Range. There is now a weekly passenger-only service, The Savannahlander, that leaves Cairns on Wednesday mornings. The Savannahlander is run by a private company, Cairns Kuranda Steam Trains. Cairns is served by a narrow gauge cane railway (or cane train) network that hauls harvested sugar cane to the Mulgrave Sugar Mill located in Gordonvale. The pressure of urban sprawl on land previously cultivated by cane farmers has seen this network reduced over recent years. ===Airport=== Cairns International Airport Cairns International Airport is north of Cairns City between the CBD and the Northern Beaches. The domestic terminal at Cairns Airport underwent an extensive redevelopment which began in 2007 and was completed in 2010. The airport has a domestic terminal, an international terminal, and a general aviation area. The airport handles international flights, and flights to major Australian cities, tourist destinations, and regional destinations throughout North Queensland. It is an important base for general aviation serving the Cape York Peninsula and Gulf of Carpentaria communities. The Cairns airport is also a base for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. ===Port=== Cairns Marina The Cairns Seaport, located on Trinity Inlet, is operated by the Cairns Port Authority. It serves as an important port for tourist operators providing daily reef trips. These consist of large catamarans capable of carrying over 300 passengers, as well as smaller operators that may take as few as 12 tourists. Cairns Port is also a port of call for cruise ships, such as Captain Cook Cruises, cruising the South Pacific Ocean. It also provides freight services to coastal townships on Cape York Peninsula, the Torres Strait and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Yearly cargo through the port totals 1.13 million tonnes. Almost 90% of the trade is bulk cargoes \u2013 including petroleum, sugar, molasses, fertiliser and LP gas. A large number of fishing trawlers are also located at the port. There is also a marina that houses private yachts and boats used for tourist operations. The Trinity Wharf has recently been the subject of a major redevelopment to improve the area for tourist and cruise ship operations. The freight wharves are located to the south of Trinity Wharf further up Trinity Inlet. == Defence facilities == The Royal Australian Navy has a base in Cairns (). The base has a complement of 900 personnel, and supports fourteen warships, including the four Armidale-class patrol boats of Ardent Division, four of the six Balikpapan-class landing craft, and all six ships of the Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service. Porton Barracks, in the outlying suburb of Edmonton, is home to the Australian Army's 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment.

The Irukandji language region includes the landscape within Cairns Regional Council. Yumplatok (also known as Torres Strait Creole and Broken) is a contemporary Torres Strait Island language originating in the Torres Strait. The contact with missionaries and others since the 1800s has led to the development of a pidgin language, which transitioned into a creole language and now has its own distinctive sound system, grammar, vocabulary, usage and meaning. Torres Strait Creole is spoken by most Torres Strait Islanders and is a mixture of Standard Australian English and traditional languages. It is an English-based creole; however, each island has its own version of creole. Torres Strait Creole is also spoken on the Australian mainland, including Northern Peninsula Area Region and coastal communities such as Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and Brisbane. ==Notable people== * Gavin Allen, Queensland and Brisbane Broncos Rugby League player * Christine Anu, pop singer and actress * Aron Baynes, basketball player in the NBA * Leonard John Brass, botanist *Mark 'Yank' Cantoni, rugby league player * Terence Cooper, film actor, artist * Courtenay Dempsey, AFL footballer, Essendon Football Club * Charlie Dixon, AFL footballer, Port Adelaide Football Club *Catriona Gray, Miss Universe winner * Ben Halloran, footballer for Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf * Ken Ham, creationist and religious activist * Tracey Hannah, downhill mountain biker * Jarrod Harbrow, AFL footballer, Gold Coast Football Club * Xavier Herbert, writer * Justin Hodges, international Rugby League player *Erin Holland, an Australian singer and Television Host * Nathan Jawai, professional basketball player, first indigenous Australian to play in NBA * Danilo Jovanovitch, poet * Susan Kiefel, Chief Justice, High Court of Australia * Richard Ash Kingsford, Mayor of Brisbane, first Mayor of Cairns * Emma Louise, musician * Rayleen Lynch, retired Australian basketball player *Rhyse Martin, Rugby League player, Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs *Grant McLennan, musician, The Go-Betweens * Isabel Lucas, actress * Ryan McGoldrick, Rugby League player, Castleford Tigers * Nate Myles, international Rugby League player * Johnny Nicol, musician * Wilma Reading, singer * Adam Sarota, international football player * Michael Thwaite, footballer for Liaoning Whowin, and occasional Socceroo * Brenton Thwaites, actor * Rhys Wakefield, actor * Naomi Wenitong, member of former pop and R&B; duo Shakaya. * Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, Rugby League player ==Gallery== File:Dawn, the Esplanade, Cairns, QLD.JPG|View of the pier and Esplanade at dawn File:Esplanade, Cairns, 2015 (02).JPG|City centre File:Glass bottom boats & Semi sub.JPG|Glass bottom boats and a Semi submarine at Green Island, Great Barrier Reef, outer Cairns File:Jack Barnes Bicentennial Mangrove Boardwalk.jpg|Jack Barnes Bicentennial Mangrove Boardwalk File:Great Barrier Reef Ferry.JPG|A Great Barrier Reef ferry, Green Island, outer Cairns File:Kuranda Scenic Railway Cairns.JPG|Kuranda scenic railway, Kuranda File:Mossman River and Gorge.JPG|Mossman river and Gorge, Daintree National Park, outskirts of Cairns File:Moved Termite Mounts Mareeba.JPG|Moved termite mounds, Mareeba, Queensland, outskirts of Cairns File:QLD Rescue Helicopter.JPG|Queensland rescue Helicopter, Green Island, Great Barrier Reef, outskirts of Cairns File:Marine Stingers Sign Cairns.JPG|Marine stingers sign, Trinity beach, Cairns File:Hastings Reef.jpg|Hastings Reef Cairns- copperlode.JPG|City landscape ==See also== * List of tallest buildings in Cairns ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Cairns City Council Website * University of Queensland: Queensland Places: Cairns * Cairns Local Information Website * Watch historical footage of Cairns and Far North Queensland from the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's collection. * Cairns \u2013 Tourism Australia * Category:1876 establishments in Australia Category:Cairns Region Category:Coastal cities in Australia Category:Fishing communities in Australia Category:Populated places established in 1876 Category:Port cities in Queensland Category:Queensland in World War II ",
