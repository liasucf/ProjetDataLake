    "text": "Autar Kaw is a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of South Florida. In 2012, he won the U.S Professor of the Year award from the Carnegie Foundation for Advancement of Teaching and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. Kaw's main scholarly interests are in education research methods, open courseware development, flipped and adaptive learning, and the state and future of higher education. == Education == In 1981, Kaw completed BE Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) in India. He joined Clemson University for MS and Ph.D in Engineering Mechanics. == Career == In 1987, he joined the University of South Florida. Since 2002, the National Science Foundation, a United States government agency, funded the development and implementation of an open courseware in Numerical Methods under the leadership of Kaw. The open courseware receives 1.8 million view on YouTube annually. He is the author of various books. He is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He is a member of American Society of Engineering Education and National Academy of Inventors He is one of the two founding members of the USF College of Engineering Academy of Distinguished Engineering Educators. In 2018, he visited UTP, Malaysia as a Fulbright Specialist candidate. He conducted several educational workshops on topics including MOOCs, flipped learning, improving student classroom performance, and the scholarship of teaching and learning. == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Award !Notes |- |2018 |Ralph Coats Roe Award |American Society of Engineering Education |- |2012 |U.S Professor of the Year | |- |2011 |National Outstanding Teaching Award |American Society of Engineering Education |- |2004 |Florida U.S. Professor of the Year | |- |2003 |Archie Higdon Distinguished Educator Award |American Society of Engineering Education |} == Selected publications == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Title !Publication |- |2018 |Evaluating Blended and Flipped Instruction in Numerical Methods at Multiple Engineering Schools |International Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning |- |2018 |Transverse shear modulus of unidirectional composites with voids estimated by the multiple-cells model |Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing |- |2014 |Comparison of Final Examination Formats in a Numerical Methods Course |International Journal of Engineering Education |- |2011 |Effect of geometry, loading and elastic moduli on critical parameters in a nanoindentation test in polymeric matrix composites with a nonhomogeneous interphase |Composite Interfaces |- |2008 |Problem-centered approach in a numerical methods course |Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice |- |2007 |Sensitivity analysis of cooling methods and geometric parameters in the assembly procedure of bascule bridge fulcra |The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design |- |2003 |Holistic but customized resources for a course in numerical methods |Computer Applications in Engineering Education |- |2003 |Optimization of laminate stacking sequence for failure load maximization using Tabu search |Composites: Part B |- |1996 |Effect of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on an indentation test |International Journal of Solids and Structures |- |1994 |Fracture mechanics of composites with nonhomogeneous interphases and nondilute fiber volume fractions |International Journal of Solids and Structures |- |1993 |Axisymmetric thermoelastic response of a composite cylinder containing an annular matrix crack |Journal of composite materials |- |1992 |An instructional interactive aid for mechanics of composites |International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education |} == References == == External links == *Numerical Methods Guy Blog *Autar Kaw - Personal Website Category:Living people Category:University of South Florida faculty Category:1960 births ",
