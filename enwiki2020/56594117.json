Elvis Presley achieved his first UK number-one single this year with \"All Shook Up\", which spent seven weeks at the top of the chart. Presley had the most entries in the top ten in 1957, with seven in total. American singer and actor Harry Belafonte (pictured in 1954) had three top 10 entries in 1957, including the year's Christmas number-one, \"Mary's Boy Child\". The UK Singles Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom. Before 2004, the chart was only based on the sales of physical singles. This list shows singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 1957, as well as singles which peaked in 1956 and 1958 but were in the top 10 in 1957. The entry date is when the single appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced). Eighty singles were in the top ten in 1957. Eleven singles from 1956 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while \"All the Way\"/\"Chicago\" by Frank Sinatra, \"Let's Have a Ball\" by Winifred Atwell, \"My Special Angel\" by Malcolm Vaughan and \"Reet Petite (The Sweetest Girl in Town)\" by Jackie Wilson were all released in 1957 but did not reach their peak until 1958. \"Make It a Party\" by Winifred Atwell, \"Singing the Blues\" by Guy Mitchell and \"True Love\" by Bing Crosby & Grace Kelly were the singles from 1956 to reach their peak in 1957. Twenty artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1957. Andy Williams, The Everly Brothers, Little Richard, Paul Anka and Shirley Bassey were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1957. The 1956 Christmas number-one, \"Just Walking in the Rain\" by Johnnie Ray, remained at number-one for the first week of 1957. The first new number-one single of the year was \"Singing the Blues\" by Guy Mitchell. Overall, thirteen different singles peaked at number-one in 1957, with Guy Mitchell and Lonnie Donegan (2) having the joint most singles hit that position. ==Background== ===Multiple entries=== Eighty singles charted in the top 10 in 1957, with seventy-one singles reaching their peak this year.

Bing Crosby, Malcolm Vaughan, Petula Clark, Tab Hunter and Winifred Atwell were among the other artists who had multiple top 10 entries in 1957. ===Chart debuts=== Thirty-one artists achieved their first top 10 single in 1957, either as a lead or featured artist.

However in 2011 the Official Charts Company released a list of the best-selling single of each year in chart history from 1952 to date. According to the list, \"Diana\" by Paul Anka is officially recorded as the biggest-selling single of 1957. \"Diana\" (2), \"Mary's Boy Child\" (3) \"All Shook Up\" (8) and \"Love Letters in the Sand\" (9) all ranked in the top 10 best-selling singles of the decade. ==Top-ten singles== ;Key {| Class=\"wikitable\" !Symbol !Meaning |- |bgcolor=lightblue|\u2021 |Single peaked in 1956 but still in chart in 1957. |- |bgcolor=#DDFFDD|\u2666 |Single released in 1957 but peaked in 1958. |- |(#) |Year-end best-selling single. |- !Entered |The date that the single first appeared in the chart. |- !Peak |Highest position that the single reached in the UK Singles Chart. |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
