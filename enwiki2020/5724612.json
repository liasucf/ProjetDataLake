In 2000, she nominated the late Iqbal Masih to receive the first World's Children's Prize for the Rights of the Child. Iqbal was a \"debt slave\" who was literally tied to a carpet loom every day for six years, and after his escape at the age of 10 campaigned against child slavery. He was killed two years later, whereupon the World's Children's prize honoured him as the posthumous recipient of the Prize at a ceremony in Sweden. Addressing the United Nations Special Session on Children on May 8, 2002, at the age of 16, Hannant said, \"This is going to be the voice of children from now for a long time.
