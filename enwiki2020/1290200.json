    "text": "The British Rail Class 450 (4DES) third-rail DC EMU began service during 2003. They are a part of the Siemens Desiro modular train family. Used for outer suburban services, the Class 450 was built with standard and first class accommodation. The unit has a maximum speed of . The Siemens \"Desiro UK\" family also includes units of Classes 185, 350, 360, 380 and 444. These trains are the most numerous trains in South Western Railway's fleet, and also the most numerous units in the Desiro UK family. In August 2017, the units transferred to South Western Railway, owned by FirstGroup and MTR Corporation. == Introduction == South West Trains Siemens Class 450/0 Desiro EMUs No. 450075 and 450109 at Clapham Junction stabling sidings. In April 2001, 785 vehicles were ordered by South West Trains in order to complete the replacement of its slam-door rolling stock, in accordance with its franchise commitment to do so by 2005, as the slam-door trains were coming to the end of their useful lives, and did not meet modern health and safety requirements. Introduction to service was delayed by the required power supply upgrades capable of powering the new trains, which feature air conditioning, a feature not present in the slam-door trains they replaced. In the December 2004 timetable change, the Class 450 Desiro began serving most intended routes, although introduction was delayed until June 2005 in some areas. The units are leased by Angel Trains to South West Trains. Sixty-eight new vehicles were ordered by South West Trains as a replacement to the growth order which was diverted to form the similar range of electric multiple units. == Formation == The entire Class 450 series consists of four car multiple units, semi permanently formed as DMSO(A)+TCO+TSO+DMSO(B). Units numbered in the range 450001-110 consist of: *63201-63300 and 63751-63760 \u2013 DMSO(A) *64201-64300 and 66851-66860 \u2013 TCO *68101-68200 and 66801-66810 \u2013 TSO *63601-63700 and 63701-63710 \u2013 DMSO(B) Units numbered in the range 450111-127 consist of: *63901-63917 \u2013 DMSO(A) *63921-63937 \u2013 TCO *66901-66917 \u2013 TSO *66921-66937 \u2013 DMSO(B) == Operations == South West Trains Class 450 No. 450112 at London Waterloo The interior of First Class cabin from a Class 450/0 The Class 450 Desiro trains operate on certain London commuter rail routes, as well as outer suburban and regional services from London Waterloo, and local services outside of the London area. They are used on all SWR lines except the West of England line and the Eastleigh to Romsey Line. These include: * Waterloo to Alton * Waterloo to Basingstoke (all stations from Woking) * Waterloo to Guildford (occasionally) * Waterloo to Reading (Most services operated by ) * Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside (occasionally) * Waterloo to Weybridge (Shared with and ) * Waterloo to Poole (Shared with and ) * Waterloo to Haslemere (Shared with ) * Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour (shared with and ) * Ascot to Aldershot * Guildford to Farnham * Portsmouth & Southsea/Portsmouth Harbour to Southampton Central (all stations) * Brockenhurst to Lymington Pier * Bournemouth to Weymouth. (Single service) * Weymouth to Brockenhurst. (Single service) They can also be found on London commuter rail services usually operated by units (to Woking, Guildford, Dorking, Chessington South, Hampton Court, Shepperton and the Kingston Loop Line), particularly in the peaks and on Sundays during periods of engineering work. These trains used to be seen in service between Wareham and Brockenhurst rail stations but now there are two trains an hour to London Waterloo from Weymouth, which are operated by SWR 444 units and an hourly slow train service from London Waterloo to Poole which is shared between Class 450s and Class 444s. Class 450 Desiro trains are used on the Portsmouth Direct Line for London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour services in place of Class 444 Desiro units on some services. The decision to use Class 450 Desiros has been a cause for complaint from passengers specifically because of the 3+2 seating arrangement. === The Class 450/2 and more orders === The interior of Standard Class accommodation aboard a Class 450 Originally, SWT\u2019s order with Siemens was for 100 four-car sets (the current 450/0) and for 32 five-car sets, intended as Class 450/2, which would be for inner-suburban use. The Strategic Rail Authority, however, did not agree to the terms required, such as the lengthening of platforms and changes to railway infrastructure. As a result, the 32 five-car sets were cancelled, with the 160 vehicles redistributed; an extra 10 four-car sets were added to the SWT order, while the remaining 120 vehicles were then ordered as 30 four-car sets of the dual-voltage for Silverlink and Central Trains. Subsequently, SWT received further 17 four-car sets, bringing the total number of Class 450 units up to 127. These units were delivered in 2006, not long after the last of the first order was delivered. 450101 was damaged in Belgium and returned to Test- and Validationcenter Wegberg-Wildenrath to have repairs conducted by Siemens, therefore delaying its entry into the UK. === Class 450/5 modifications === In January 2008, 28 Class 450/0 sets were modified and re-numbered in the Class 450/5 series, for use on services between Waterloo and Windsor, the Hounslow Loop Line, as well as between Waterloo and Weybridge. They had their first class seating removed and replaced with 2+3 formation standard class seating and some other seats were removed to provide more standing capacity; extra handrails were also provided. The numbers modified are 450043 to 450070, which have become 450543 to 450570 respectively and displayed the letters HC (denoting 'High Capacity') above the unit number on the front of the sets. The modifications were carried out at the Bournemouth Traincare Depot. In anticipation of the Class 458/5 modifications for use on the Windsor Lines, the 450/5 sub class had the First Class reinstated, and they are now used generally across the SWR routes, however, these trains retain their 4505xx number as the standard seating configuration remains different. As they complete their latest interior refurbishment, during late 2019, they are being returned to their original numbers. === SWR Refresh (2018-19)=== South Western Railway (as part of their contract) have been carrying out a refurbishment programme on their Class 450 fleet. As part of this, every unit will be deep cleaned with carpets and seat covers replaced and every two seats in Standard Class will have a plug socket fitted. First Class will be reduced to 8 seats per set end (16 seats per set), and will feature new leather seats and tables with wireless charging facilities. As part of this work, Class 450/5s will also be similarly refurbished, and renumbered to their original numbers, so all Class 450s will once again share a common layout.

A panoramic view of the relocated SWR First Class cabin relocated to each end of a 4 car set albeit reduced in capacity, with new leather seats and tables with wireless charging facilities. === SWR Developments (2019-Present)=== During 2019, all of the High Capacity Class 450/5 units were formed back in to their original seating formations, with first class re-added as a result, as part of the refurbishment programme. As such, all of the units were renumbered back in to their original 450/0 numberings. The work took place at Eastleigh Works (Arlington Rail) and the last unit left Eastleigh early May, thus bringing an end to the 450/5 subclass. == Accidents and incidents == *On 6 November 2017, unit 450 025 was derailed near . Four people were injured; over 300 passengers were evacuated from the train. The accident was caused by track spread. Neither Network Rail nor London Underground had inspected the track for many years, due to a misunderstanding as to who was responsible for maintaining a stretch of line. == Fleet details == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Class !Operator !No. !Year Built !Carriages !Unit nos. |- |450/0 |South Western Railway |align=center|127 |align=center|2002\u201306 |align=center|4 |450001\u2013450127 |} == Diagrams == 800px 800px == References == 450 Category:Siemens multiple units Category:Train- related introductions in 2003 ",
