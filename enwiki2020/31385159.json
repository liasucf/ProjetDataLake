    "text": "In time series analysis, the cross-spectrum is used as part of a frequency domain analysis of the cross-correlation or cross-covariance between two time series. == Definition == Let (X_t,Y_t) represent a pair of stochastic processes that are jointly wide sense stationary with autocovariance functions \\gamma_{xx} and \\gamma_{yy} and cross-covariance function \\gamma_{xy}. Then the cross-spectrum \\Gamma_{xy} is defined as the Fourier transform of \\gamma_{xy} : \\Gamma_{xy}(f)= \\mathcal{F}\\\\{\\gamma_{xy}\\\\}(f) = \\sum_{\\tau=-\\infty}^\\infty \\,\\gamma_{xy}(\\tau) \\,e^{-2\\,\\pi\\,i\\,\\tau\\,f} , where : \\gamma_{xy}(\\tau) = \\operatorname{E}[(x_t - \\mu_x)(y_{t+\\tau} - \\mu_y)] . The cross-spectrum has representations as a decomposition into (i) its real part (co-spectrum) and (ii) its imaginary part (quadrature spectrum) : \\Gamma_{xy}(f)= \\Lambda_{xy}(f) + i \\Psi_{xy}(f) , and (ii) in polar coordinates : \\Gamma_{xy}(f)= A_{xy}(f) \\,e^{i \\phi_{xy}(f) } . Here, the amplitude spectrum A_{xy} is given by : A_{xy}(f)= (\\Lambda_{xy}(f)^2 + \\Psi_{xy}(f)^2)^\\frac{1}{2} , and the phase spectrum \\Phi_{xy} is given by : \\begin{cases} \\tan^{-1} ( \\Psi_{xy}(f) / \\Lambda_{xy}(f) ) & \\text{if } \\Psi_{xy}(f) e 0 \\text{ and } \\Lambda_{xy}(f) e 0 \\\\\\ 0 & \\text{if } \\Psi_{xy}(f) = 0 \\text{ and } \\Lambda_{xy}(f) > 0 \\\\\\ \\pm \\pi & \\text{if } \\Psi_{xy}(f) = 0 \\text{ and } \\Lambda_{xy}(f) < 0 \\\\\\ \\pi/2 & \\text{if } \\Psi_{xy}(f) > 0 \\text{ and } \\Lambda_{xy}(f) = 0 \\\\\\ -\\pi/2 & \\text{if } \\Psi_{xy}(f) < 0 \\text{ and } \\Lambda_{xy}(f) = 0 \\\\\\ \\end{cases} == Squared coherency spectrum == The squared coherency spectrum is given by : \\kappa_{xy}(f)= \\frac{A_{xy}^2}{ \\Gamma_{xx}(f) \\Gamma_{yy}(f)} , which expresses the amplitude spectrum in dimensionless units. ==See also== * Cross- correlation * Power spectrum * Scaled Correlation ==References== Category:Frequency-domain analysis Category:Multivariate time series ",
