Wiley-VCH, 2009, as well as a soil bactericide and has been in use since 1974. Nitrapyrin was put up for review by the EPA and deemed safe for use in 2005. Since nitrapyrin is an effective nitrification inhibitor to the bacteria Nitrosomonas it has been shown to drastically the reduce NO2 emissions of soil. Nitrapyrin is a white crystalline solid with a sweet odor and is often mixed with anhydrous ammonia for application. ==Synthesis== Nitrapyrin is commonly produced by the photochlorination of 2-methylpyridine: :CH3-C5H4N + 4Cl2 -> CCl3-ClC5H3N + 4 HCl Produced by DOW Chemical, the product marketed under the trade name N-Serve and contains small amounts (less than 5% wt) of the non-active ingredient 4,6-dichloro-2-trichloromethylpyridine. ==Function== Nitrapyrin functions as an inhibitor of the urease enzyme in the nitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas,Z.

The compound itself tends not to persist in nature. The primary decomposition is the hydrolysis of the trichloromethyl functional group, resulting primarily in 6-chloro-picolinic acidJohn H.
