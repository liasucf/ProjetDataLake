Secretariat manages to convince the president to send his brother, Jeffretariat, in his place. At home, a young BoJack steals a cigarette from his mom's purse, and is caught smoking it by his mom. She tells him to finish the cigarette, as he's being \"punished for being alive.\" In the present, BoJack throws a lit cigarette over his balcony, and seeing that the cigarette has started a fire, Todd calls 911. At work, Rutabaga Rabbitowitz tells Princess Carolyn that he's starting his own agency and that he wants her to join him. After learning that if she declines Rutabaga will start the agency with Vanessa Gekko, Princess Carolyn agrees to join him. At the refugee camp in Cordovia, Diane continues to write her book on Sebastian St. Clair but starts to spend most of her time taking care of a sick kid named Kinko. After the refugee camp is bombed, and Kinko dies, Diane decides to return back to L.A. At the set of Secretariat, BoJack learns that the Nixon scene where Secretariat learns his brother is dead has been replaced with a Christmas scene. Along with Kelsey Jannings, Todd, Princess Carolyn, Mr. Peanutbutter, Margo Martindale, and a cable repairman named Alan, BoJack decides to sneak into the Nixon library to shoot the scene. They're caught by a security guard, but manage to keep him quiet by letting him play Nixon in the scene. The next day, BoJack learns that Kelsey has been fired for what they did. Having filmed the Christmas scene, BoJack returns home, where he finds Diane, who asks if she can stay at his place. ==Reception== The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Caroline Framke, writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B+. She praised the connections made between BoJack and Diane, stating that \"It\u2019s been long enough since we last saw BoJack and Diane interacting as real friends, but \u201cThe Shot\u201d is a reminder of why they bonded in the first place.\" On Decider, Kayla Cobb praised the episode for showing the true side of BoJack Horseman, stating that, \"Though he\u2019s the same selfish BoJack we\u2019ve always known, now he seems to be using his selfishness and power for, dare I say, better reasons.\" ==References== ==External links== * \"The Shot\" on Netflix * * Category:BoJack Horseman episodes Category:2015 American television episodes Category:Netflix original television series episodes ",
