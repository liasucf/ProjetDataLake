The Council reaffirmed its support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and extended the mandate of MONUC until 31 October 2005. The resolution was essentially technical in nature to allow the Council more time to discuss a one-year extension of the mission proposed by the Secretary-General Kofi Annan. ==See also== * Kivu conflict * Ituri conflict * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1601 to 1700 (2005\u20132006) * Second Congo War ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1628 Category:2005 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 1628 Category:September 2005 events ",
