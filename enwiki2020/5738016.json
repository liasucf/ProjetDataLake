He served as the president of the Bosnian branch of the Croatian Democratic Union and protested that Croats should support the elected government of Alija Izetbegovi\u0107. The central HDZ leadership in Zagreb pressured local leadership in Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia to depose him of his leadership position. He was replaced with Mate Boban. Upon founding of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, Kljui\u0107 was elected its first president. In 1994, he founded his own party, the Republican Party, a multi-ethnic, pro-Bosnia party. He stood as the party's candidate for the Croat member of the Presidency in the 2002 general elections, but failed to be elected. Later, Kljui\u0107 took part in the ICTY proceedings. ==References== Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sarajevo Category:Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina politicians Category:Politicians of the Bosnian War Category:Members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina ",
