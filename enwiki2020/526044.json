    "text": "Thrall-Demonsweatlive is an EP by Danzig. It was released in 1993 on Def American Recordings and has been certified Platinum. ==Music and recording== The EP is split into two sections. The first section, Thrall, consists of three new studio recordings that were tracked live and completed by the band in a single day. The studio recording \"Trouble\" is a cover of the Elvis Presley song featured in the movie King Creole. Glenn Danzig had previously recorded the song with Samhain, which was later released on the box set version of their Final Descent EP. The second section, Demonsweatlive, includes four live recordings taken from the band's Halloween 1992 performance at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheater in California. From the fourth pressing on, the CD releases have a hidden track featuring the remixed studio version of \"Mother\", titled \"Mother '93\". Symbolically, the song is hidden at track number 93, and the total length of the blank tracks leading to the song is 7 minutes and 6 seconds (6 minutes and 66 seconds). ==Artwork and packaging== The cover artwork is by artist Simon Bisley. The EP was issued as a picture- disc CD and LP in Europe. Like Danzig's four studio albums with the original lineup, this EP was given a Parental Advisory label despite the absence of common profanity. ==Music videos== Music videos were released for the songs \"Mother '93\" and \"It's Coming Down\". The \"Mother '93\" music video was a success on MTV. As a result, \"Mother\" became Danzig's most well known song; its popularity helping both the EP and the band's debut album to reach Gold status in 1994, and later Platinum status. The uncensored version of the \"It's Coming Down\" music video was banned by music channels, including MTV, due to its sexually explicit content. The music video depicts various acts of bondage, sadomasochism, and cock and ball torture. The video was directed by Jon Reiss and features an appearance by performance artist Bob Flanagan, both known for their video work with Nine Inch Nails. Eerie Von explained the concept behind the music video: \u201cIt was part of mine and Glenn's personalities, part of what we used to see when we lived in New York. The director also had some good ideas, and we let him do what he wanted. I like stuff that people think is bizarre. It was pretty heavy, but so what? Sexually, you're either open minded or you're not.\u201d All music videos from the album are featured on Danzig's Archive de la Morte DVD. ==Track listing== * Thrall: #\"It's Coming Down\" \u2013 3:35 #\"The Violet Fire\" \u2013 4:58 #\"Trouble\" \u2013 3:23 * Demonsweatlive: # * \"Snakes of Christ\" \u2013 4:17 # * \"Am I Demon\" \u2013 4:21 # * \"Sistinas\" \u2013 4:04 # * \"Mother\" \u2013 3:35 # * \"Mother '93\" \u2013 3:23 All songs written by Glenn Danzig, except \"Trouble\" by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller ==Credits== *Glenn Danzig \u2013 vocals, guitar, keyboards *Chuck Biscuits \u2013 drums *John Christ \u2013 guitar *Eerie Von \u2013 bass ==Production== *Producers - Glenn Danzig, Rick Rubin *Engineer - Bruno Tattaglia *Mastering - Stephen Marcussen *Artwork - Simon Bisley *Photography - Mark Leialoha *Design - Dirk Walter ==References== Category:Danzig (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Rick Rubin Category:1993 debut EPs Category:Live EPs Category:1993 live albums ",
