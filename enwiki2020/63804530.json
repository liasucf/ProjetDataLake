    "text": "Mary Elizabeth Lalage Wakefield (born 12 April 1975) is a British journalist, and a columnist and commissioning editor for The Spectator. ==Early life== Wakefield is the daughter of Katherine Mary Alice (n\u00e9e Baring) and Sir Humphry Wakefield, of Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. She has two brothers; Captain Maximilian Wakefield (born 1967), an entrepreneur and racing car driver, and Jack Wakefield (born 1977), former director of the Firtash Foundation and an art critic who writes for The Spectator and other publications. A third brother, William Wakefield, was born in 1975 and died in infancy. Wakefield was educated at the independent girls' boarding school Wycombe Abbey before studying at the University of Edinburgh and obtaining an undergraduate degree. ==Family provenance== Through her mother, she is descended from Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale, the Governor of Kenya during the Mau Mau uprising, and Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, a Governor General of Canada, and through the latter, Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, of the House of Grey, a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, after whom Earl Grey tea is named. The vast Baring family fortune was made partly from the slave trade. Members of the Baring family received compensation for lost income due to slaves' emancipation under the Slave Compensation Act 1837 (Alexander Baring, a great x 4 uncle, received \u00a39,900, \u00a31.3m when adjusted for inflation in 2019). The loan taken out by the government to pay for this compensation was fully paid off only in 2015. ==Career== Wakefield has worked at the weekly magazine The Spectator for decades, since Boris Johnson was editor, and is now commissioning editor, assistant editor from 2001 and then deputy editor. She also writes for the magazine as a columnist, and has written for The Sun, Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times. In 2015, following an online petition, Wakefield was forced to apologise and amend an article she had written for The Spectator in which she described an 18-year- old who had recently died in a moped crash as a \"thuggish white lad\". Her father's Chillingham Castle website refers to her as \"Daughter Mary, a musician and painter, [who] is also Assistant Editor of The Spectator\". ==Personal life== In December 2011, Wakefield married Dominic Cummings, a friend of her brother Jack Wakefield. In 2016, they had a son,Rabbett, Abigail; Morley, Nicole (8 January 2019). \"Who is Dominic Cummings? The Durham man behind Brexit played by Benedict Cumberbatch in Channel 4 show\". Evening Chronicle.Wakefield, Mary (10 August 2019). \"The reason middle-class parents are so anxious\". The Spectator. Alexander Cedd, named after an Anglo-Saxon saint. She is a convert to Catholicism, (starts at 1h 48min) having been raised in the Anglican tradition. Wakefield was portrayed by Liz White in the 2019 Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War. Wakefield is second cousin once removed to Alexander Armstrong; they share a direct ancestor in the person of colonial administrator Sir John Perronet Thompson.Obituary, Daily Telegraph, 31 October 2001.Forthcoming marriages, The Times, 2 September 1929, p.15. ===COVID-19=== On 25 April, Wakefield wrote an article for The Spectator about her experience when both she and Cummings contracted COVID-19. On the same day, she was a guest on BBC Radio 4's Today programme discussing the same event, as part of a series of recordings by survivors of the viral disease. On 22 May it was reported, following a joint investigation by The Daily Mirror and The Guardian, that Wakefield and Cummings had driven over 260 miles (c. 420 km) from London to Durham in late March to stay in a cottage at her father-in-law's farm, while both, reportedly, were exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, although Cummings states that his symptoms appeared the day after the journey was made. An eyewitness saw Wakefield on 12 April walking in Barnard Castle in the company of Cummings and their son, after a complaint to the Durham Constabulary by another witness who claimed to have seen Cummings with a group of people in the same town. Cummings himself admitted that he made the 52-mile round trip with his wife and child to see whether he could drive safely, saying, \"My wife was very worried, particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease. She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child [back to London], given how ill I had been.\" Following an investigation into these reports, Durham Constabulary stated that, whereas the trip to Barnard Castle might have been a minor breach of the lockdown regulations (the use of the word \"might\" makes clear that it is not the police's ultimate decision whether to determine reasonable excuse: that would be for the courts to determine), the trip to Durham itself was not. Durham Constabulary stated they would take no further action in the matter. Alleged inconsistencies between Cummings's account and his wife's have been discussed in the press, and reported to the Independent Press Standards Organisation, the magazine's regulator. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1975 births Category:People educated at Wycombe Abbey Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:20th- century British journalists Category:21st-century British journalists Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Protestantism Category:British columnists ",
