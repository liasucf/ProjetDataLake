    "text": "Stefano Conti was an Italian 18th century merchant from Lucca, known for his expansive collection and patronage of contemporary Italian artists. He began his collection at age 50 in 1705, and utilized Alessandro Marchesini as his agent in Venice. While his collection is now dispersed, it is notable because all his purchases were recorded, including price and a description of the art- work by the artist. He also demanded that the subject of each painting be novel, and not a copy of an existing painting. Among the artists he collected were Canaletto, Luca Carlevaris, Gregorio Lazzarini, Sebastiano Bombelli, and Antonio Franchi. ==References== * Conti, Stefano Conti, Stefano Category:Year of death unknown Category:Year of birth unknown Category:18th-century art collectors Category:18th-century merchants Category:18th-century Italian businesspeople ",
