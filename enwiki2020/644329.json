    "text": "'France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions () (stylized as ') is the French public national television broadcaster. It is a state-owned company formed from the integration of the public television channels France 2 (formerly Antenne 2) and France 3 (formerly France R\u00e9gions 3), later joined by the legally independent channels France 5 (formerly La Cinqui\u00e8me), France \u00d4 (formerly RFO Sat), and France 4 (formerly Festival). France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions is currently funded by the revenue from television licence fees and commercial advertising. The new law on public broadcasting will phase out commercial advertising on the public television channels (at first in the evening, then gradually throughout the day). France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and has selected HbbTV for its interactive news, sports and weather service, and plans to add catch-up TV and social media sharing capability.French Public Broadcaster Goes For HbbTV. Online Reporter 13 September 2011. Retrieved 27 March 2012 == History == From 1964 to 1974, French radio and television was monopolized through an organization known as the Office de Radiodiffusion T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise. In an effort to stimulate competition, the organization was split in 1975 so that the France's three television channels\u2014TF1, Antenne 2, and FR3, would still be owned by the French government, but be operated independently from each other. However, the privatization of TF1 in 1987 and increased competition from other new private broadcasters (such as Canal+ and La Cinq, the latter having been replaced by public channel La Cinqui\u00e8me after it ceased transmissions in April 1992) led to a decline in viewership for the two remaining public channels, which lost 30% of their market share between 1987 and 1989.Rollet, Brigitte. \"Television in France\", in Television in Europe, pp. 39\u201340.

Walter de Gruyter, 2001. The channels were however saved when a single director-general was appointed to manage both Antenne 2 and FR3, becoming part of a joint entity known as France T\u00e9l\u00e9vision. They were renamed in 1992 as France 2 and France 3 respectively.Hart, Jeffrey A. Technology, Television, and Competition: The Politics of Digital TV, p. 46. Cambridge University Press, 2004. In August 2000, France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions S.A. was formed as a holding company for France's public television channels, absorbing control of France 2, France 3, and La Cinqui\u00e8me (later renamed France 5). In 2004, R\u00e9seau France Outre-mer was absorbed by France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions. Beginning in 2008, the President of France took the duty of naming the presidents for the French public broadcasters; they were previously nominated by the Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel. == Channels == === National === * France 2 - The company's primary channel with the second largest viewing audience. * France 3 - The company's secondary channel, consisting of a network of regional stations. * France 4 - Available only on digital television.
