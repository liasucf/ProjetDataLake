European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Pharmac. http://ehjcvp.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/03/ehjcvp.pvv012 is a clinical prediction rule to predict the quality of vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation therapy as measured by time in therapeutic INR range (TTR) (VKA e.g. warfarin).Apostolakis S, Sullivan RM, Olshansky B, Lip GY.

Simple decision making between a Vitamin K Antagonist and Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulant (NOACs): Using the SAMe-TT2R2 Score. European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Pharmac. http://ehjcvp.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/03/ehjcvp.pvv012 This score can be used with patients with \u22651 additional stroke risk factors using the CHA2DS2-VASc score, where oral anticoagulation is recommended or should be considered. This score reflects the need to offer an improved patient care pathway when using oral anticoagulants. While NOACs avoid the need for drug monitoring (e.g. INR monitoring), they have an unstable bioavailability and are not indicated for patients with chronic kidney failureRuff, Christian T., et al. \"Evaluation of the novel factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: Design and rationale for the Effective aNticoaGulation with factor xA next GEneration in Atrial Fibrillation\u2013Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction study 48 (ENGAGE AF\u2013TIMI 48).\" American Heart Journal 160.4 (2010): 635-641 or in patients with valvular replacement surgery.2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease (Journal of the American College of Cardiology).
