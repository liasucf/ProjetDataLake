He is one of several prominent American Indians to spearhead the movement against the use of Native American imagery as sports mascots. ==Early life== Philip John Yenyo was born on 26 October 1965 to Adeline Ramirez and John Yenyo in Cleveland, Ohio. ==Career== Yenyo currently serves as the executive director of the state of Ohio's chapter of the American Indian Movement. He is also co-chair for The Committee of 500 Years of Dignity and Resistance. The latter organization serves as an indigenous-supportive, multicultural organization dedicated to bolstering the cultural human heritage rights of indigenous people who live in the northeast Ohio region. ==Activism== Yenyo has dedicated a significant portion of resources to protesting the use of Chief Wahoo mascot by the Cleveland Indians. \"I would like to see the name and logo changed. Both have to go.\" Of the logo, Yenyo has stated, \"But I think our people and others have come to realize that this caricature of our people as a red-face, smiling savage does great harm to us and our culture and has done so for many years.\" \"This imagery, most sports teams are named after animals and they put us in that same category. We're human beings. We're still a living culture and we still exist.\" He has also explicated on the exploitation of other items of sacred significance to American Indian. \"When we tell people that the feather is sacred to us, it's a sacred as a Christian cross, some of them start to come around and start understanding,\" he said. \"When you start to explain to people how it affects us as a people and it puts us in a category with animals, they begin to see our side.\" ==See also== * Robert Roche ==References== ==External links== * * Category:20th-century Native Americans Category:21st-century Native Americans Category:Native American activists Category:Members of the American Indian Movement Category:Native American leaders Category:Activists from Ohio Category:Native American people from Ohio Category:People from Olmsted Falls, Ohio Category:People from Cleveland Category:Living people Category:1965 births ",
