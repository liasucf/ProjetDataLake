It is native to California and Baja California, where it grows in saline and alkaline soils such as those on alkali flats and beach bluffs. This is a mat-forming annual herb producing scaly stems up to a meter long. The toothed leaves are 1 to 4 centimeters long. The flowers are generally borne in hard clusters along the stem and there is sometimes a spikelike inflorescence of male flowers at the end of the stem.
