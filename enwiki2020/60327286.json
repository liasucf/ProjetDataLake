    "text": "Whitehead's algorithm is a mathematical algorithm in group theory for solving the automorphic equivalence problem in the finite rank free group Fn. The algorithm is based on a classic 1936 paper of J. H. C. Whitehead.J. H. C. Whitehead, On equivalent sets of elements in a free group, Ann. of Math. (2) 37:4 (1936), 782\u2013800. It is still unknown (except for the case n = 2) if Whitehead's algorithm has polynomial time complexity. ==Statement of the problem== Let F_n=F(x_1,\\dots, x_n) be a free group of rank n\\ge 2 with a free basis X=\\\\{x_1,\\dots, x_n\\\\}. The automorphism problem, or the automorphic equivalence problem for F_n asks, given two freely reduced words w, w'\\in F_n whether there exists an automorphism \\varphi\\in \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\varphi(w)=w'. Thus the automorphism problem asks, for w, w'\\in F_n whether \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w'. For w, w'\\in F_n one has \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w' if and only if \\operatorname{Out}(F_n)[w]=\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)[w'], where [w], [w'] are conjugacy classes in F_n of w, w' accordingly. Therefore, the automorphism problem for F_n is often formulated in terms of \\operatorname{Out}(F_n)-equivalence of conjugacy classes of elements of F_n. For an element w\\in F_n, |w|_X denotes the freely reduced length of w with respect to X, and \\|w\\|_X denotes the cyclically reduced length of w with respect to X. For the automorphism problem, the length of an input w is measured as |w|_X or as \\|w\\|_X, depending on whether one views w as an element of F_n or as defining the corresponding conjugacy class [w] in F_n. ==History== The automorphism problem for F_n was algorithmically solved by J. H. C. Whitehead in a classic 1936 paper, and his solution came to be known as Whitehead's algorithm. Whitehead used a topological approach in his paper. Namely, consider the 3-manifold M_n=\\\\#_{i=1}^n \\mathbb S^2\\times \\mathbb S^1, the connected sum of n copies of \\mathbb S^2\\times \\mathbb S^1. Then \\pi_1(M_n)\\cong F_n, and, moreover, up to a quotient by a finite normal subgroup isomorphic to \\mathbb Z_2^n, the mapping class group of M_n is equal to \\operatorname{Out}(F_n); see.Suhas Pandit, A note on automorphisms of the sphere complex. Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 124:2 (2014), 255\u2013265; Different free bases of F_n can be represented by isotopy classes of \"sphere systems\" in M_n, and the cyclically reduced form of an element w\\in F_n, as well as the Whitehead graph of [w], can be \"read-off\" from how a loop in general position representing [w] intersects the spheres in the system. Whitehead moves can be represented by certain kinds of topological \"swapping\" moves modifying the sphere system.Allen Hatcher, Homological stability for automorphism groups of free groups, Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici 70:1 (1995) 39\u201362; Karen Vogtmann, Automorphisms of free groups and outer space.

The exposition of Whitehead's algorithm in the book of Lyndon and Schupp is based on this combinatorial approach. Culler and Vogtmann, in their 1986 paper that introduced the Outer space, gave a hybrid approach to Whitehead's algorithm, presented in combinatorial terms but closely following Whitehead's original ideas. ==Whitehead's algorithm== Our exposition regarding Whitehead's algorithm mostly follows Ch.I.4 in the book of Lyndon and Schupp,Roger Lyndon and Paul Schupp, Combinatorial group theory.

Given w,w'\\in F_n the first part of Whitehead's algorithm consists of iteratively applying Whitehead moves to w,w' to take each of them to an ``automorphically minimal\" form, where the cyclically reduced length strictly decreases at each step. Once we find automorphically these minimal forms u,u' of w,w', we check if \\|u\\|_X=\\|u'\\|_X. If \\|u\\|_X e \\|u'\\|_X then w,w' are not automorphically equivalent in F_n. If \\|u\\|_X=\\|u'\\|_X, we check if there exists a finite chain of Whitehead moves taking u to u' so that the cyclically reduced length remains constant throughout this chain. The elements w,w' are not automorphically equivalent in F_n if and only if such a chain exists. Whitehead's algorithm also solves the search automorphism problem for F_n. Namely, given w,w'\\in F_n , if Whitehead's algorithm concludes that \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w', the algorithm also outputs an automorphism \\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\varphi(w)=w'. Such an element \\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) is produced as the composition of a chain of Whitehead moves arising from the above procedure and taking w to w'. ===Whitehead automorphisms=== A Whitehead automorphism, or Whitehead move, of F_n is an automorphism \\tau\\in \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) of F_n of one of the following two types: (i) There is a permutation \\sigma\\in S_n of \\\\{1,2,\\dots, n\\\\} such that for i=1,\\dots, n :: \\tau(x_i)=x_{\\sigma(i)}^{\\pm 1} :Such \\tau is called a Whitehead automorphism of the first kind. (ii) There is an element a\\in X^{\\pm 1}, called the multiplier, such that for every x\\in X^{\\pm 1} :\\tau(x)\\in \\\\{x, xa, a^{-1}x, a^{-1}xa\\\\}. :Such \\tau is called a Whitehead automorphism of the second kind. Since \\tau is an automorphism of F_n, it follows that \\tau(a)=a in this case. Often, for a Whitehead automorphism \\tau\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n), the corresponding outer automorphism in \\operatorname{Out}(F_n) is also called a Whitehead automorphism or a Whitehead move. ====Examples==== Let F_4=F(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4). Let \\tau: F_4\\to F_4 be a homomorphism such that : \\tau(x_1)=x_2x_1, \\quad \\tau(x_2)=x_2, \\quad\\tau(x_3)=x_2x_3x_2^{-1},\\quad \\tau(x_4)=x_4 Then \\tau is actually an automorphism of F_4, and, moreover, \\tau is a Whitehead automorphism of the second kind, with the multiplier a=x_2^{-1}. Let \\tau': F_4\\to F_4 be a homomorphism such that : \\tau'(x_1)=x_1, \\quad \\tau'(x_2)=x_1^{-1}x_2x_1, \\quad\\tau'(x_3)=x_1^{-1}x_3x_1,\\quad \\tau'(x_4)=x_1^{-1}x_4x_1 Then \\tau' is actually an inner automorphism of F_4 given by conjugation by x_1, and, moreover, \\tau'is a Whitehead automorphism of the second kind, with the multiplier a=x_1. ===Automorphically minimal and Whitehead minimal elements=== For w\\in F_n, the conjugacy class [w] is called automorphically minimal if for every \\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) we have \\|w\\|_X\\le \\|\\varphi(w)\\|_X. Also, a conjugacy class [w] is called Whitehead minimal if for every Whitehead move \\tau\\in \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) we have \\|w\\|_X\\le \\|\\tau(w)\\|_X. Thus, by definition, if [w] is automorphically minimal then it is also Whitehead minimal. It turns out that the converse is also true. ===Whitehead's \"Peak Reduction Lemma\"=== The following statement is referred to as Whitehead's \"Peak Reduction Lemma\", see Proposition 4.20 in and Proposition 1.2 in:Ilya Kapovich, Paul Schupp, and Vladimir Shpilrain, Generic properties of Whitehead's algorithm and isomorphism rigidity of random one-relator groups. Pacific Journal of Mathematics 223:1 (2006), 113\u2013140 Let w\\in F_n. Then the following hold: (1) If [w] is not automorphically minimal, then there exists a Whitehead automorphism \\tau\\in \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\|\\tau(w)\\|_X< \\|w\\|_X. (2) Suppose that [w] is automorphically minimal, and that another conjugacy class [w'] is also automorphically minimal. Then \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w' if and only if \\|w\\|_X=\\|w'\\|_X and there exists a finite sequence of Whitehead moves \\tau_1,\\dots, \\tau_k\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that :\\tau_k\\cdots \\tau_1(w)=w' and : \\|\\tau_i\\cdots\\tau_1(w)\\|_X=\\|w\\|_X \\text{ for } i=1,\\dots, k. Part (1) of the Peak Reduction Lemma implies that a conjugacy class [w] is Whitehead minimal if and only if it is automorphically minimal. ===The automorphism graph=== The automorphism graph \\mathcal A of F_n is a graph with the vertex set being the set of conjugacy classes [u] of elements u\\in F_n. Two distinct vertices [u], [v] are adjacent in \\mathcal A if \\|u\\|_X=\\|v\\|_X and there exists a Whitehead automorphism \\tau such that [\\tau(u)]=[v]. For a vertex [u] of \\mathcal A, the connected component of [u] in \\mathcal A is denoted \\mathcal A[u]. ===Whitehead graph=== For 1 e w\\in F_n with cyclically reduced form u, the Whitehead graph \\Gamma_{[w]} is a labelled graph with the vertex set X^{\\pm 1}, where for x,y\\in X^{\\pm 1}, x e y there is an edge joining x and y with the label or \"weight\" n(\\\\{x,y\\\\};[w]) which is equal to the number of distinct occurrences of subwords x^{-1}y, y^{-1}x read cyclically in u. (In some versions of the Whitehead graph one only includes the edges with n(\\\\{x,y\\\\};[w])>0.) If \\tau\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) is a Whitehead automorphism, then the length change \\|\\tau(w)\\|_X-\\|w\\|_X can be expressed as a linear combination, with integer coefficients determined by \\tau, of the weights n(\\\\{x,y\\\\};[w]) in the Whitehead graph \\Gamma_{[w]}. See Proposition 4.6 in Ch. I of. This fact plays a key role in the proof of Whitehead's peak reduction result. ===Whitehead's minimization algorithm=== Whitehead's minimization algorithm, given a freely reduced word w\\in F_n, finds an automorphically minimal [v] such that \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)v. This algorithm proceeds as follows. Given w\\in F_n, put w_1=w. If w_i is already constructed, check if there exists a Whitehead automorphism \\tau\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\|\\tau(w_i)\\|_X<\\|w_i\\|_X. (This condition can be checked since the set of Whitehead automorphisms of F_n is finite.) If such \\tau exists, put w_{i+1}=\\tau(w_i) and go to the next step. If no such \\tau exists, declare that [w_i] is automorphically minimal, with \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w_i, and terminate the algorithm. Part (1) of the Peak Reduction Lemma implies that the Whitehead's minimization algorithm terminates with some w_m, where m\\le\\|w\\|_X, and that then [w_m] is indeed automorphically minimal and satisfies \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w_m. ===Whitehead's algorithm for the automorphic equivalence problem=== Whitehead's algorithm for the automorphic equivalence problem, given w,w'\\in F_n decides whether or not \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w'. The algorithm proceeds as follows. Given w,w'\\in F_n, first apply the Whitehead minimization algorithm to each of w,w' to find automorphically minimal [v],[v'] such that \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)v and \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w'=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)v'. If \\|v\\|_X e \\|v'\\|_X, declare that \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w e\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w' and terminate the algorithm. Suppose now that \\|v\\|_X=\\|v'\\|_X=t\\ge 0. Then check if there exists a finite sequence of Whitehead moves \\tau_1,\\dots, \\tau_k\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that :\\tau_k\\dots \\tau_1(v)=v' and : \\|\\tau_i\\dots\\tau_1(v)\\|_X=\\|v\\|_X=t \\text{ for } i=1,\\dots, k. This condition can be checked since the number of cyclically reduced words of length t in F_n is finite. More specifically, using the breadth-first approach, one constructs the connected components \\mathcal A[v], \\mathcal A[v'] of the automorphism graph and checks if \\mathcal A[v]\\cap \\mathcal A[v']=\\varnothing. If such a sequence exists, declare that \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w', and terminate the algorithm. If no such sequence exists, declare that \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w eq\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w' and terminate the algorithm. The Peak Reduction Lemma implies that Whitehead's algorithm correctly solves the automorphic equivalence problem in F_n. Moreover, if \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w', the algorithm actually produces (as a composition of Whitehead moves) an automorphism \\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n) such that \\varphi(w)=w'. ==Computational complexity of Whitehead's algorithm== * If the rank n\\ge 2 of F_n is fixed, then, given w\\in F_n, the Whitehead minimization algorithm always terminates in quadratic time O(|w|_X^2) and produces an automorphically minimal cyclically reduced word u\\in F_n such that \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)u. Moreover, even if n is not considered fixed, (an adaptation of) the Whitehead minimization algorithm on an input w\\in F_n terminates in time O(|w|_X^2 n^3).Abd\u00f3 Roig, Enric Ventura, and Pascal Weil, On the complexity of the Whitehead minimization problem. International Journal of Algebra and Computation 17:8 (2007), 1611\u20131634; * If the rank n\\ge 3 of F_n is fixed, then for an automorphically minimal u\\in F_n constructing the graph \\mathcal A[u] takes O\\left(\\|u\\|_X\\cdot \\\\#V\\mathcal A[u]\\right) time and thus requires a priori exponential time in |u|_X). For that reason Whitehead's algorithm for deciding, given w,w'\\in F_n, whether or not \\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w=\\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)w', runs in at most exponential time in \\max\\\\{|w|_X,|w'|_X\\\\}. * For n=2, Khan proved that for an automorphically minimal u\\in F_2, the graph \\mathcal A[u] has at most O\\left(\\|u\\|_X\\right) vertices and hence constructing the graph \\mathcal A[u] can be done in quadratic time in |u|_X.Bilal Khan, The structure of automorphic conjugacy in the free group of rank two. Computational and experimental group theory, 115\u2013196, Contemp. Math., 349, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004 Consequently, Whitehead's algorithm for the automorphic equivalence problem in F_2, given w,w'\\in F_2 runs in quadratic time in \\max\\\\{|w|_X,|w'|_X\\\\}. ==Applications, generalizations and related results== *Whitehead's algorithm can be adapted to solve, for any fixed m\\ge 1, the automorphic equivalence problem for m-tuples of elects of F_n and for m-tuples of conjugacy classes in F_n; see Ch.I.4 of and Sava Krsti\u0107, Martin Lustig, and Karen Vogtmann, An equivariant Whitehead algorithm and conjugacy for roots of Dehn twist automorphisms.

Consequently, if w,w'\\in F_n are two such ``generic\" elements, Whitehead's algorithm decides whether w,w' are automorphically equivalent in linear time in \\max\\\\{|w|_X,|w'|_X\\\\}. *Similar to the above results hold for the genericity of automorphic minimality for ``randomly chosen\" finitely generated subgroups of F_n.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Bassino, Cyril Nicaud, and Pascal Weil, On the genericity of Whitehead minimality.
