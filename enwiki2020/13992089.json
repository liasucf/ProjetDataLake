    "text": "The D\u00f4me du Go\u00fbter (4,304 m) is a mountain in the Mont Blanc massif. It is a shoulder of Mont Blanc, whose summit lies two kilometres to the south-east. The D\u00f4me is traversed on ascents of Mont Blanc via the Bosses route. The summit of the D\u00f4me is marked as lying entirely within France on the French Institut G\u00e9ographique National (IGN) map , although on Italian Istituto Geografico Militare (IGM) map the summit appears to lie on the frontier between France and Italy. In June 2015, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed repeated claims on the territory.

The summit of the D\u00f4me du Go\u00fbter ==Go\u00fbter Refuge== In 2013, the Go\u00fbter Refuge opened, a mountain hut noted for its modern style. From the hut the summit of the Dome du Gouter is about two hours away by foot. The hut is located above the Aiguille du Gouter cliff and is constructed of wood and steel in a roughly egg shape. The older shelter was a more basic metal shed that sat on the ice, whereas the new building has supports drilled into the rock. ==See also== *List of 4000 metre peaks of the Alps ==References== ==External links== *The D\u00f4me du Go\u00fbter on SummitPost Category:Alpine four- thousanders Category:Mountains of the Alps Category:Mountains of Italy Category:Mountains of Haute-Savoie Category:France\u2013Italy border Category:International mountains of Europe Category:Mont Blanc massif ",
