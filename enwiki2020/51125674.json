    "text": "Yamal 102 (Russian: ) was a geostationary communications satellite operated by Gazkom and built by RSC Energia. It was, along with Yamal 101 the first communications satellite of the Yamal program and the first iteration of the USP Bus. It was a satellite with 2200W of power (1300W available for the payload) on an unpressurized bus. It had eight SPT-70 electric thrusters by OKB Fakel for station keeping. Its payload was 12 C band equivalent transponders supplied by Space Systems Loral. ==History== It was launched along Yamal 101 September 6, 1999 at 16:36 UTC from Baikonur Site 81/23 by a Proton-K/Blok-DM-2M directly to GEO. While its twin Yamal 101 failed, Yamal 102 successfully deployed and was commissioned into service. On August 9, 2010 it was decommissioned and sent to a graveyard orbit. The satellite lasted 4079 days (11 years 2 months), a bit short of the design life of 12.5 years. ==Rename to Yamal 101== Right after solar panel deployment Yamal 101 failure irreparably. Thus, Gazkom registered Yamal 102 as Yamal 101. This has caused significant confusion but the records are clear that the satellite that failed was, in fact, the original Yamal 101. ==See also== * Yamal 101 \u2013 Twin satellite that was launched together and failed at separation. * Yamal \u2013 Communication satellite family operated by Gazprom Space Systems. * Gazprom Space Systems \u2013 Satellite communication division of the Russian oil giant Gazprom. * USP Bus \u2013 The satellite bus on which Yamal 101 is based. * RSC Energia \u2013 The designer and manufacturer of the Yamal 101 satellite. ==References== ==External links== * Gunter Space Page on the Yamal 101/102 Yamal-102 Category:Satellites using the USP bus Category:Spacecraft launched in 1999 Category:1999 in Russia Category:Spacecraft launched by Proton rockets ",
