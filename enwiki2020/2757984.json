    "text": "Oxford was a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom. It comprised the city of Oxford in the county of Oxfordshire, and elected two members of parliament from its creation in 1295 until 1885 when its representation was reduced to one member by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. During the 1960s and 1970s, Oxford was a marginal seat. ==Boundaries and boundary changes== 1918\u20131950: The County Borough of Oxford. The boundaries were expanded to coincide with the County Borough. 1950\u20131983: As above, with redrawn boundaries. Areas which had been absorbed by the County Borough of Oxford, including Cowley and Headington, transferred from the Henley constituency. Small area in the north also transferred from Banbury. In the 1983 redistribution, this constituency was abolished and was split into two new, separate constituencies: Oxford East, and Oxford West and Abingdon. The City of Oxford local government district had replaced the County Borough of Oxford on 1 April 1974, under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972, and the redistribution reflected this. Despite Oxford West and Abingdon including Oxford city centre, Oxford East included the majority of the new district. The city centre has been in the redrawn Oxford East since 2010. ==Members of Parliament== ===1295\u20131640=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Parliament!!First member!!Second member |- | 1379|| Edmund Kenyan ||Thomas Somerset |- | 1380 (Nov)|| Edmund Kenyan|| |- | 1381 ||Edmund Kenyan|| |- | 1382 (May)|| Edmund Kenyan|| |- | 1385 || Edmund Kenyan|| |- | 1386 || Edmund Kenyan|| Thomas Houkyn |- | 1388 (Feb)|| John Hickes|| Thomas Somerset |- | 1388 (Sep)|| John Shawe|| Thomas Baret |- | 1390 (Jan)|| Richard Garston|| Alan Lekensfeld |- | 1390 (Nov)|| Edmund Kenyan|| Adam de la River |- | 1391|| Edmund Kenyan|| John Ottworth |- | 1393|| Richard Garston|| John Merston |- | 1394|| Edmund Kenyan|| John Forster |- | 1395|| John Ludlow|| Adam de la River |- | 1397 (Jan)|| Walter Benham|| Adam de la River |- | 1397 (Sep)|| John Ottworth|| Adam de la River |- | 1399|| John Spicer|| John Burbridge |- | 1401|| Thomas Forsthull|| Adam de la River |- | 1402|| Walter Benham|| John Spicer |- | 1404 (Jan)|| Thomas Coventre|| John Spicer |- | 1404 (Oct)|| John Merston|| Michael Salisbury |- | 1406|| John Ottworth|| Thomas Cowley |- | 1407|| Thomas Coventre|| Hugh Benet |- | 1410|| Thomas Coventre|| Hugh Benet |- | 1411|| |- | 1413 (Feb)|| |- | 1413 (May)|| Thomas Coventre|| Hugh Benet |- | 1414 (Apr)|| John Shawe II|| Walter Colet |- | 1414 (Nov)|| Thomas Coventre|| John Merston |- | 1415|| |- | 1416 (Mar)|| Thomas Coventre|| William Brampton |- | 1416 (Oct)|| |- | 1417|| Thomas Coventre|| Hugh Benet |- | 1419|| Thomas Coventre|| William Brampton |- | 1420|| Thomas Coventre|| William Offord |- | 1421 (May)|| Thomas Coventre|| William Brampton |- | 1421 (Dec)|| John Quarane|| William Offord |- | 1491|| Robert Caxton|| |- | 1510\u20131523|| No names known |- | 1529|| John Latton|| William Fleming |- | 1536|| ?John Latton|| ?William Fleming |- | 1539|| Thomas Denton|| Richard Gunter |- | 1542|| ?
