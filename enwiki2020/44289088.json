    "text": "The Massachusetts Automatic Gas Tax Increase Repeal Initiative, Question 1 was on the November 4, 2014 statewide ballot. Approved by voters, the measure repeals a 2013 law that would automatically adjust gas taxes according to inflation, allowing for automatic annual increases in the state's gas tax.News Telegram, \"Referendums could deep-six casinos, gas tax,\" November 29, 2013 The law that this initiative repeals would also have put a minimum cap on gas taxes to prevent gas tax decreases in the case of deflation. The tax increase was part of a transportation funding package that was vetoed by Governor Deval Patrick (D) because he wanted an even greater tax increase. Patrick's veto was overruled by a House vote of 123 to 33 and a Senate vote of 35 to 5.Masslive.com, \"Massachusetts lawmakers override Gov.

November 6, 2014 ==Text of measure== ===Ballot summary=== Massachusetts Secretary of State, \"Question 1: Eliminating Gas Tax Indexing,\" accessed September 17, 2014 ===Full text=== ==Background== ===State gas tax=== In 2013, the Democrat-controlled state legislature passed House Bill 3847, which raised the state's gas tax from 21 to 24 cents per gallon and automatically tied the tax rate to inflation for future years, meaning it would increase by the same annual percentage as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This marked the first increase in the tax since 1991. Given that the CPI has averaged approximately one or two percent during the past several years, the tax would likely increase by half a penny or less per year.Fox News, \"Automatic gas tax emerging as key campaign issue in Massachusetts,\" May 26, 2014Tax Foundation, \"Massachusetts Ballot Referendum Challenges Gas Tax Indexing,\" July 22, 2014 ===Voter guide summary=== ==Support== The measure is sponsored by the group Tank the Gas Tax.Tank the Gas Tax website, accessed March 14, 2014 ===Supporters=== ====Officials==== *State Rep.
