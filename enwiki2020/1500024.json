Neighbouring districts are Chatuchak, Wang Thonglang, Bang Kapi, Suan Luang, Watthana, Ratchathewi, and Din Daeng. ==History== Huai Khwang District was established in an area formerly part of Phaya Thai in 1973. Adjustments to the district were made in 1978, adjusting boundaries with neighboring districts Phaya Thai and Bang Kapi, and again in 1993, creating the new Din Daeng District. The name \"Huai Khwang\" meaning 'creek barricade' (huai means 'creek' and khwang means 'barricade'). Because the terrain here in the past consisted of wetlands and creeks, waterways were the main means of transport. Today, the district has attracted a new generation of Chinese, leading it to be called \"New Chinatown\", as distinct from Bangkok's traditional Chinatown, Yaowarat, in Samphanthawong District. ==Administration== The district is divided into three sub-districts (khwaeng). #Huai Khwang \u0e2b\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e02\u0e27\u0e32\u0e07 #Bang Kapi \u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e34 #Sam Sen Nok \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e01 ==Places== *Thailand Cultural Centre (\u0e28\u0e39\u0e19\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e27\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22), a venue consisting of two auditoriums and one outdoor stage, used for live performances throughout the year.
