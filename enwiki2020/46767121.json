He was then selected among few other students in all of Lhasa by the Tibetan Central Government in conjunction with Beijing government as an elite student ambassador to study at the Beijing University to promote bilateral cultural brotherhood. However, his family, particularly his mother who was a strong Tibetan nationalist, refused that her son to be sent to Communist China. Thonden was disappointed by the objections of his mother and decided that he would go on his own.

Wangdue Khangsar family had been the patron of Sera Mey Monastery for many generations, so Thonden was accepted right away. Dakyap Ladang was north of Lhasa in Penpo region of Tibet. There, he studied under the tutelage of his uncle Dakyap Nawang Losang Yeshi Rinpoche (Dakyap Rinpoche), who was the direct lineage of Ka-dam Geshe Putowa Rinchen S\u00e9l.
