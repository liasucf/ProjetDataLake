    "text": "The Golijska Moravica or simply Moravica ( or ) is a river in western Serbia. With a length of 98 km, it is the longer headstream of the West Morava (the name it takes at its confluence with the \u0110etinja), and thus, of the Great Morava. Its name, Moravica, means \"little Morava\" in Serbian, and it also gives its name to the surrounding region and the modern Moravica District of Serbia. == Stari Vlah == The Golijska Moravica originates from the western slopes of the Golija mountain and flows straight to the north, between the Golija and Javor mountains, through the Stari Vlah region. Even though the area in the lower course is sparsely populated, there are many hamlets on the river, characteristically organized in clusters. More important are the villages of Sakovi\u0107i, Gazdovi\u0107i, Kumanica, Me\u0111ure\u010dje (where it receives the No\u0161nica from the left) and \u010citluk. == Ivanjica depression == The Golijska Morava enters the Ivanjica depression, located between the mountains of \u010cemerno on the east, and Mu\u010danj on the west. This is where it receives the Lu\u010dka reka from the right and Grabovi\u010dka reka from the left and flows through the town of Ivanjica, its suburbs of Bedina Varo\u0161 and \u0160ume, the satellite earth station of Prilike and the village of Dubrava. At the end of the depression, the Golijska Moravica passes next to the monastery of Sveti Arhan\u0111eli, as it continues to the north. == Arilje depression & Ta\u0161ti field == From Ivanjica depression, the Golijska Moravica flows into the Arilje depression, located between the mountains of Golubac (on the east) and Blagaja (on the west), where it receives the Tre\u0161njevica from the right (at the village of Divljaka), and its major tributary, the Rzav from the right, near the town of Arilje, which itself used to be called Moravica in medieval period. In the final section, the Golijska Morava reaches the Ta\u0161ti field, located between the mountains of Blagaja, Krstac and Crnokosa, east of the town of Po\u017eega. Near the village of Pilatovi\u0107i, the Golijska Morava meets the \u0110etinja and together they form the Zapadna Morava, longer headwater of the Velika Morava. The Golijska Moravica drains an area of 1,513 km\u00b2, belongs to the Black Sea drainage area and it is not navigable. The river's potential for power production is not used. == References == * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan \u0110.
