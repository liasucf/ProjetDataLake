Madriz was born on 21 July 1867, in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua. After President Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya resigned on December 21, 1909 in the face of an armed Counter-Revolution and United States opposition, Madriz assumed the presidency as a designate by the congress. Madriz attempted to establish an Anti-Imperialist struggle against USA interests, but active North American intervention in favor of the Oligarchic politicians proved insurmountable, and he went into exile in August 1910. He died in Mexico City on 14 May 1911. In 1936, the newly created Madriz Department was named in his honor. ==References== ==External links== * Jos\u00e9 Madriz and the Conservative Restoration Category:Presidents of Nicaragua Category:People from Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua Category:1867 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Liberal Party (Nicaragua) politicians ",
