    "text": "While at War () is a 2019 Spanish historical drama film directed by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar. It premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. ==Plot== Plaza Mayor. The buildings of the University also appear in the film. During the Spanish coup of July 1936, Nationalists occupy Salamanca, during which the city's socialist mayor is arrested. Revered author Miguel de Unamuno (Karra Elejalde) convenes with two colleagues, the evangelist Atilano Coco and the leftist Salvador Vila Hern\u00e1ndez; they discuss the coup briefly, after which Unamuno leaves for an interview to publicly support the coup. During the interview, the mayor's wife interrupts to ask him to intervene regarding her husband's imprisonment; Unamuno offers monetary assistance instead, which she rejects. Meanwhile, in Spanish Morocco, a German delegation meets with General Francisco Franco to pressure the formation of a single Nationalist leader following the death of General Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo. Franco maintains that the junta in Burgos holds power, even as his colleagues pressure him to take leadership. Back in Salamanca, Unamuno is removed from his position as rector at the University of Salamanca by the government of the Second Spanish Republic in response to his support of the coup. Unamuno meets with Coco and Salvador again, with the meeting culminating in a heated argument from which Coco leaves. Unamuno later goes to Coco's residence to speak with him, only to find that he is not there. Elsewhere, General Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n-Astray meets with Franco in C\u00e1ceres, while the junta in Burgos reinstates Unamuno as rector of the university, where he finds that he has been prompted to write a manifesto supporting the coup, a task he rejects. Unamuno attempts to meet with Coco - his wife reveals that he had been taken into Nationalist custody days prior. Unamuno meets with Salvador, who attempts to convince him of the fascist nature of the coup. Meanwhile, Mill\u00e1n-Astray urges Franco to relieve the Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar, but is rebuffed on strategic grounds - to relieve the siege would delay the war's end by years. Mill\u00e1n- Astray pressures Franco to assume leadership, a proposal Franco once again rejects. Later, Franco replaces the Republic's flag on his headquarters with the old monarchist flag, stirring discontent within the junta. The junta then arrive in Salamanca to meet with Franco and his generals, with whom Unamuno is called to meet. Unamuno attempts to plead for Coco's release, and is told that his case will be reviewed. Unamuno is then quietly confronted by Mill\u00e1n-Astray about his unwillingness to sign the manifesto, leaving Unamuno to make a decision. The junta leave to hold a vote on the leadership question, during which Mill\u00e1n-Astray exhorts his colleagues to vote for Franco. At the same time, the administration of the University of Salamanca meet regarding the manifesto. Unamuno assents and signs, while Franco is voted in as commander- in-chief. While leaving the meeting, Unamuno is met by Coco's wife, who presents him a letter testifying to her husband's innocence. Meanwhile, Franco visits a cathedral, where he is inspired by an image of El Cid to relieve the siege of the Alc\u00e1zar, earning more fervor for his cause. Unamuno meets with Salvador in the countryside, with whom he debates with regarding the war. During the walk back, Salvador is accosted and arrested by Falangists, leaving Unamuno to walk back alone in the rain. He slips into a delirious state for several days, after which he attempts to make a personal appeal to Franco and his wife to have his colleagues released; the attempt fails, and Unamuno, anguished, informs Coco's wife. Meanwhile, Mill\u00e1n-Astray confronts Unamuno and informs him that he will be taking Franco's place in a Nationalist event at the university the following day. At the event, Unamuno initially refuses to speak, though he changes his mind after reading Coco's wife's letter. He presents a speech criticizing the nationalists, causing the crowd to turn on him, thereby forcing him out. The film ends with an epilogue detailing the fates of several of the figures in the film. ==Cast== ==Release== The film had its world premiere on September 6, 2019 at the Toronto International Film Festival.
