    "text": "Americo Makk (1927\u2013May 5, 2015) was a painter and portrait artist originally from Hungary, who immigrated to the United States with his family in 1962 to escape the communist movement in Brazil. His notable paintings include historical and ecclesiastical portraits and murals, including portraits of two United States Presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, as well as notable figures Edward Teller, Eva Gabor, Barbara Sinatra, Ray Price, and Barbara Carrera. ==Early life and training== Americo Makk, last name pronounced \"Mahk\", was born Imre Makk in 1927 in a town in western Hungary once known as Gy\u0151rszentm\u00e1rton, and later renamed Pannonhalma.Henderson, Shelby (1986). \"Makk Family: A Vision of Life\", Makk Studios, Honolulu, HI. His home stood in the shadow of the Pannonhalma Archabbey. Americo's father was financial supervisor to the Benedictine monks who resided in the Abbey and taught in the local school. Americo began sketching at age 6. By the time he was 8, the Benedictine Brothers, with whom he studied, encouraged him further into art.Mary Burke Rossi, \"The Road Leads to Freedom\", Second in a Series, Herald Courier, Hyde Park, NY, Friday, April 28, 1967. Americo was 12 when the communist Russian army first invaded Hungary. At this time, his passion for painting became inexorable. His parents cautioned Americo that pursuing art as a vocation would lead to poverty, and that a career in architectural engineering was more suitable. Americo's formal training as a painter began at the Hungarian National Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest from 1945 through 1948. At the age of 21, he received a scholarship to Italy, and studied at the Academy of Fine Art in Rome beginning in 1948.Belden, Dorothy, \"Beautiful Art for a Troubled World\", \"Hungarian Couple, Son Paint in Romantic Style\", Lively Arts, The Wichita Eagle, KS, Sunday, November 4, 1979. As Hungary was effectively under the control of communism becoming a satellite state of the Soviet Union and administered by the Hungarian People's Republic, he had doubted the authorities would allow him to accept the scholarship in Rome. Americo was reserved in conveying his memories of the communist takeover in interviews for fear of reprisals against family members still in Hungary, simply describing the period as \"very unpleasant.\" However, where his words could not describe, his painting of the Russian takeover was reported as depicting \"all the grief and agony that the people of Hungary have suffered...\" Mertens, Susan, \"Adapt and flourish\", The Vancouver Sun, B.C., Friday, December 5, 1980. Once in Rome, Americo focused his studies on ecclesiastical art and the works of Renaissance masters, such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.Simoni, John P., \"Painting Added to Collection\", Lifestyle, Art in the Bluestem, The El Dorado Times, KS, January 1, 1982. While studying at the Academy, Americo met Eva Holusa, then 16, a fellow student also of Hungarian descent, whom he later married and worked alongside for the remainder of his life. He went on to instruct at the Rome Academy of Fine Art. It was then that he won the Vatican Portrait Award with a portrait of Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty, a figure personifying opposition to communism in Hungary in support of religious freedom, which was installed in the Vatican for permanent display.Ledoux, Larry (1982). \"Makk, Americo, Eva, A.B.\", Herff Jones Publishers, Logan Utah. ==Career== ===Brazil and life as the Makks (1949\u20131962)=== One of Four in a Series, Mural of Brazilian Chief Ajuricaba, by Americo Makk In 1949, Americo Makk followed Eva Holusa and moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Eva's father, Dr. Bertalan Holusa, a former economic and agricultural adviser to Ethiopia's Haile Selassie, had fled from Africa with his family, to France in 1937 as a result of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and then to S\u00e3o Paulo with its rapid industrialization. The official language in Brazil was Portuguese. \"Imre\" in Portuguese is \"Americo\" and it was here where Americo adopted the Portuguese translation for his name. Americo and Eva married in S\u00e3o Paulo on October 18, 1950. In 1951, they were appointed Professors of Fine Arts at the Academia de Belas Artes. That same year, their son, Americo Bartholomew, A.B. Makk, a respected artist in his own right, was born. While in Brazil, Americo and Eva Makk jointly painted fourteen Catholic cathedrals, churches and basilicas.Love, Frances, Art Center Director, \"Makk Family to Discuss International Art\", The Daily Advertiser, Lafayette, LA, Friday, February 13, 1981. Their most famous cathedral painting, \"Coronation of Our Lady\", was a 2,349 square foot (218 square meters) al-secco ceiling in the Cathedral of Manaus, the largest single motif painting in the world, which depicts the coronation of the Virgin Mary in her crowning as the Queen of Heaven.LeDoux, \"Makk Painting: The Romance of Yesterday, The Delights of Today\", Art Gallery, A Magazine of Fine Art and Photography, January 1983/1984. The mural reportedly took two years to complete, working 60 to 100 feet in the air on wood scaffolding in \"stifling heat and little light.\" Tsutsumi, Cheryl Chee, \"The Makk Family\", Aloha, The Magazine of Hawaii, 1982. Americo Makk reported rats getting into the paints, and he suffered a fall from the scaffolding while painting.Whitaker, William, Entertainment Editor, \"Artist Battled Rats in Cathedral\", Abilene Reporter News, Abilene, TX, Sunday, November 16, 1980 During the period from 1958 through 1962, the Makks were appointed the Official Artists of the, then democratic, Brazilian government painting government officials and murals, as well as church officials in Brazil, including Sobral Bishop Dom Jos\u00e9 Tupinamb\u00e1 da Frota. At this time, Americo and Eva merged their independent styles by working side-by- side on the expansive cathedral murals that appeared to be painted by one hand.Ampersand, \"Treasures Shared, Art brings together a famous family and Honolulu Couple\", Alexander & Baldwin, Inc., Spring 1985. From then on, Americo and Eva became synonymous with each other's work and the Makk family brand, \"Casal Makk\" (Portuguese for \"Makk couple\"), was created.Adams, Anthony, \"Feast of Art At the Fair\", Long Island Press, NY, Sunday, April 26, 1964. The remaining cathedral wall and ceiling paintings by the Makks are tourist attractions in Brazil to this day, which are signed Casal Makk, such as those found in the Parish of Our Lady of Patronage (Nossa Senhora do Patrocinio) in Jau, State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Americo Makk, Amazonas, 1959 ===Amazon expedition (1957\u20131959)=== In 1957, their cathedral work culminated with a request via telegram from the Governor of Amazonas, Plinio Coelho, for an assignment to travel the Amazon jungle, also known as the Amazon rainforest or Amazonia, to study the remaining indigenous Indian tribes, which were thinning by a boom of industrial growth and deforestation.Rossi, Mary Burke, Women's Editor, \"The Makk Story, Mural Tourist Attraction\", Fourth in a Series, Herald Courier, New Hyde Park, NY, Friday, May 12, 1967. Both Governor Coehlo, and the Mayor of Manaus, Gilberto Mestrinho, later to succeed Coelho as Governor, co-sponsored the expedition, which was planned to last approximately one to two years. Paintings were the medium of choice for the project, as it was known that some tribes hidden in the darkness of the jungle became anxious or reacted violently to camera flashes or flashbulbs.LeDoux, Larry, \"Art that's all in the family\", Kauai Beach Press, August 14\u201320, 1987. For the year preceding the trip, Americo and Eva Makk explored areas of the rainforest to get acquainted with the subject matter. In 1958, the Makks, including 8 year-old A.B. with pet ocelot \"Cica\" (Hungarian for \"cat\"), accompanied by guides and a Catholic missionary priest, embarked on their expedition to study the flora, fauna and inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest. The expedition began in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, and the heart of the Amazon jungle.Dietz, Betty, \"Da Vinci Never Had Such Help\", Dayton Daily News, OH, Tuesday, December 3, 1963. The trip spanned over 1,000 miles of travel by foot, river boat, canoe, small plane and helicopter; there were no roads.Mary Burke Rossi, \"Mural Tourist Attraction\", The Makk Story, Fourth in a Series, Herald Courier, Hyde Park, NY, Friday, May 12, 1967. They planned to meet guides at designated checkpoints, who were considered friendly Indians of various tribes. Travel was difficult due to frequent rains that turned to floods washing away landmarks. With high humidity and rain, the Makks described suffering frequent bites from small black insects, called \"piums\". Some tribes they met along the way believed that to have their image painted would result in their souls being stolen, thus simple sketches were made in those regions.Whitaker, Bill, Entertainments Editor, \"Bogeyman were real growing up in Brazil\", Abilene Reporter News, TX, Thursday, November 13, 1980.Rossi, Mary Burke, \"The Amazon Jungle... A Green Inferno\", Part VI, Herald Courier, New Hyde Park, NY, Friday, May 26, 1967. Through the expedition, the Makks gathered and recorded images of varying indigenous people of Brazil, which included the Macus, Bare, Tucano and Boca Negra (Tenharim).Rossi, Mary Burke, Women's Editor, \"Mission to the Amazin' Amazon\", Fifth in a series, Herald Courier, Hyde Park, NY, Friday, May 19, 1967. They often sketched subjects through the trip, painting them later. The Makks' memories of the trip were preserved in an estimated 70 paintings. In a 1982 interview for Aloha Magazine, Eva Makk described the Amazon jungle, \"Sometimes it was so dark and dense, we had to use flashlights at high noon in order to see... I think of it as a forbidden cathedral of God.\" Upon their return, the Makks painted four large murals in the Palace of the Governor in Manaus, Palacio Rio Negro. One of the four paintings was of Brazilian Chief Ajuricaba leading his warriors with bow and arrow into battle against invading Portuguese forces armed with forged weaponry and armor during the expansion of Portuguese colonization of the Americas. Paintings marked \"Amazonas\" denoted the origin and time frame of the painting rather than a title. A small portion of their Amazon paintings was exhibited at the Brazilian consulate in Miami, Florida, in May 1969.Pottorff, Claire, \"Internationalists Display Here\", The Miami Beach Sun, FL, Vol 40, No. 156, Friday, May 2, 1969.Miami Herald, \"Art Work Displayed\", No. 153, Miami, FL, Friday May 2, 1969. In an interview from 1981, when asked whether he would have attempted the trip a second time, Americo responded, \"It would be too dangerous to try now. It was too dangerous then. But we (he and Eva) had an artistic feeling and desire to meet challenges, to know and to paint what no one had ever painted before. So we accepted the invitation of the government. We were both \u2018official artists of Brazil.\u2019 But when it was over, we decided we would never do anything like that again. Because you only have one life.\"Kerns, William, \"Acclaimed Artists Exhibit Works\", Lubbock Avalanche Journal, Lubbock, TX, May 13, 1981 ===Move to New York City (1962\u20131967)=== By 1960, the communist movement controlled television, radio and the press in S\u00e3o Paulo. Foodstuffs and gasoline were luxuries. As a result of the increasing political unrest in Brazil, the Makks worked on immigrating to the United States to once again escape communism, which took two years to accomplish. As they continued work on church paintings, the Makks often thought whether the communists would soon destroy them.Rossi, Mary Burke, Women's Editor, \"America- Paradise for the Makks\", The World of Art Part VIII, The Herald Courier, Hyde Park, NY, Friday June 9, 1967. In 1962, the Makks secured a sponsorship from the Ecclesiastical Art Studio of New York in New York City and moved to Long Island, New York.Jokiel, Lucy, \"Family Affair: In Hawaii, The Family that Paints Together, Profits Together\", Hawaii Business, Vol 32, No 10, April 1987.Denko, Gloria, \"Art is for the Sensitive...\", Sunday News-Globe, Amarillo, TX, Sunday June 7, 1970. They left behind most of their belongings in Brazil to allow room for the Amazon paintings and sketches, taking with them four suitcases and a small amount of cash. On May 10, 1962, knowing very little English, the Makks arrived at Idlewild Airport, in Queens, NY. Both Americo and Eva began exhibiting their work in New York in 1963. Returning to their ancestral roots with a Hungarian colony in New York, they began preserving Hungarian history and culture in their work. They also continued painting under contract for the Ecclesiastical Art Studio of New York to restore and decorate church ceilings and mural painting. In 1963, the Makks painted the Immaculate Conception Church located near West Point, The United States Military Academy.Schweller, Adele U., Times Women's Editor, \"Makks compatible with both art and marriage\", Times, Kettering OH, April 13, 1967.Waldron, Mary, Time Out\", Nassau Illustrated News, NY, October 21, 1965.

On April 17, 1967, Americo Makk, sponsored by Prince Rainier III, was awarded top \"Director's Prize\" by the International Art Exchange, New York-Paris-Monaco Exhibition, for his oil painting titled \"Blue Morning.\" Hawai'i Monthly, a Travel Companion, \"The Makk Family\", Holiday Issue, HI, 1984. The painting was subsequently shown at Salle d' Exposition Wilson in Paris.Hawaii Tourist News, \"Island Art News Premiere Exhibition\", December 6\u201312, 1979. The Makks were elected in 1969 to the \"Fifty American Artists Association\" of representational artists. ===Relocation to Hawaii (1967\u20132015)=== In 1967, before going to Paris for the Salle d' Exposition in Paris, the Makks visited Hawaii and made the decision to relocate to the island of Oahu that same year. The reason for the change was in part due to Americo's health concerns, which included arthritis affecting his hands. The Makk family resides in Hawaii as of 2017. Detail of horse's breath from \"Windy Crossing\" ===The Presidents and beyond=== In 1967, Americo, as well as Eva, expanded their repertoire of paintings dedicated to the culture, heritage and history of the American old west, which included the American Indians when the Los Angeles Museum sent him to sketch ranches in California, a subject also pursued in Texas. In 1978, Americo Makk was commissioned to paint a portrait of Jimmy Carter to be presented by Governor George Ariyoshi to the president as a \u201cgift of state\u201d from the people of Hawaii.Honolulu Star-Bulletin, A Gannett Newspaper, \"Carter Portrait on View at Capitol\", Vol 68, No. 326, Thursday, November 22, 1979.

In 1984 the painting was described by an anonymous writer in the Hawaiian periodical Artists in Paradise: \"Light comes from the flag, draped above and behind Carter, the source of his power and inspiration. The focus of this light is the right side of Carter's face, drawing attention to his scholar's brow and clear directness of his eyes. However, the left side of Carter's face is in relative darkness, reminding us that the President is but a man, and foretelling the judgment of historians that the issues which faced Carter's administration were not clearly resolved.\" \"Editorial Notebook\", Artists in Paradise, From the Islands of the Pacific, HI, Spring 1984. In 1982, the hard boundbook Makk, edited with commentary by Larry LeDoux, was published by Herff Jones Publishers in Logan, Utah documenting the art and history of the Makk family in 96 pages.Merrill Robert, \"Makk: Painting Their Way Around the World\", The Herald Journal, Logan UT, Sunday, October 17, 1982.

Americo Makk expressed his concerns with painting the portrait in an interview for The Desert Sun, that if a president did not appreciate his portrait then the artist faced public scrutiny, referencing President Lyndon B. Johnson's portrait painted by respected landscape artist Peter Hurd.Fessier, Bruce, \"Painting for posterity\", The Desert Sun, Palm Spring, Saturday, March 19, 1983. Americo, with Eva and A.B., personally presented the 60 inch by 40 inch painting to President Reagan in the oval office of the White House on March 29, 1984, with the American Hungarian Federation.DECOR, The Magazine of Fine and Decorative Arts, \"Reagan Receives Portraits\", June 1984.The Desert Post, \"Reagan accepts life-size portrait by Americo Makk\", Palm Springs, 1984. Two additional portraits were also presented to the first family. Americo painted President Reagan with the space shuttle in the background. Eva Makk painted a portrait of the President and Nancy Reagan together, which was 60 inch by 40 inch. An article in the Hawaiian periodical Artists in Paradise said of President Reagan's portrait that its \"imagery, execution and technique reflect the spirit of our modern times with their sudden changes in political alignments, their looming national conflicts, their rapid advances in technology, and the need for decisive leadership and prompt action if we are to survive as a nation... Makk's portrait dramatizes the soul and significance of a strong American President.\" In 1984, Americo was commissioned to paint Dr. Edward Teller. The painting was presented to Dr. Teller and displayed in the United States Senate Rotunda in May 1984 along with other retrospective works by the Makks. Paintings displayed in the Rotunda were stamped on the reverse \"Washington, D.C., United States Capitol, United States Senate\" commemorating the exhibit.

In the 1970s, Americo Makk changed his signature style from the printed \"A. Makk\" to the script version of his full name \"Americo Makk\". From the 70s onward, paintings were also regularly signed on the reverse side with the painting title, if titled, and ink stamped with the Makk Family crest and rights reserved. Notably, in older news articles Americo's name may be erroneously printed \"Amerigo\", which, even though error, is Italian for \"Imre\". While the bulk of his work was in oil, Americo Makk also worked in other media, such as watercolor.
