It was a box office success with a gross of NT$150 million from 35 shows and 600,000 attendance. ==Background== In August 2010, Tsai released her eleventh studio album, Myself. To promote the album, Tsai planned to embark her new concert tour in this year. The tour was confirmed to begin around the year's Christmas by Tsai in August 2010 when she was interviewed in Shanghai. In November 2010, Tsai held a press conference to officially announce the tour titled Myself World Tour and was to begin on December 24 at Taipei Arena. In July 2012, Tsai announced an additional show would be held at London, England in October, and it was her first time to hold a solo concert in Europe. In September 2012, Tsai released her next studio album, Muse, and the set list was adapted in order to better promote her new album. In November, Tsai held a press conference to officially announce new dates added. In December, Tsai was injured during an upside-down pole dancing practice, and she decided to cancel the pole dance performance at the show in few days. However, Tsai finally performed the pole dance at the show in Kaohsiung. ==Concert synopsis== Tsai described the central theme of the show as a disco party, and the stage was built with a giant disco ball-shaped LED backdrop in the center. The show began with images of a female robot eventually transforming into Tsai's appearance on the screen. The giant disco ball backdrop opened with a ladder to reveal Tsai inside. She dresses as a gladiator and performed \"Butterfly\". This was followed by \"Pulchritude\", \"Black-Haired Beautiful Girl\", \"Vogue\", and \"Honey Trap\" while each of these songs had different costume. Tsai made a music and dance cover of Madonna song \"Vogue\" in tribute to her icon Madonna. After performing \"Honey Trap\", Tsai performed voguing with American dancer Benny Ninja. During \"Parachute\", a giant Christmas wreath was then lowered onstage, and Tsai sang the song while sitting on the wreath. During \"Dancing Diva\", Tsai also performed her classic ribbon dance. Tsai performed the mashup of \"Butterflies in My Stomach\", \"Music\", \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\", and \"Just Dance\". The final segment started after a group of dancers performing the \"acrobatics\" Tsai did throughout her career. This was followed by Tsai striking yoga poses on an aerial hoop. The show ended when Tsai dancing in spraying water. ==Set list== ==Shows== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ List of concerts, showing date, city, country, venue, and special guest |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | City ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Venue ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Special guest(s) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;\" | Note |- ! colspan=\"6\" | Asia |- | 24 December 2010 | rowspan=\"3\" | Taipei | rowspan=\"3\" | Taiwan | rowspan=\"3\" | Taipei Arena | rowspan=\"4\" | | rowspan=\"3\" | |- | 25 December 2010 |- | 26 December 2010 |- | 7 May 2011 | colspan=\"2\" | Singapore | Singapore Indoor Stadium | |- | 21 May 2011 | Shanghai | rowspan=\"2\" | China | Hongkou Football Stadium | rowspan=\"2\" | Jay Chou | |- | 28 May 2011 | Beijing | Workers' Stadium | |- | 11 June 2011 | Kuala Lumpur | Malaysia | Stadium Merdeka | rowspan=\"13\" | | |- | 24 June 2011 | rowspan=\"2\" | Hong Kong | rowspan=\"12\" |China | rowspan=\"2\" | Hong Kong Coliseum | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | 25 June 2011 |- | 2 July 2011 | Guangzhou | Guangzhou Gymnasium | |- | 16 July 2011 | Changzhou | Changzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium | |- | 26 August 2011 | Jiangyin | Jiangyin Sports Center Stadium | |- | 9 September 2011 | Tianjin | Tianjin Olympic Center Stadium | |- | 17 September 2011 | Nanjing | Nanjing Olympic Sports Centre Stadium | |- | 20 April 2012 | Wenzhou | Wenzhou Sports Centre Stadium | |- | 14 July 2012 | Shanghai | Mercedes-Benz Arena | |- | 25 August 2012 |Macau | Cotai Arena | |- | 15 September 2012 | Beijing | Workers Indoor Arena | |- | 22 September 2012 | Foshan | Foshan Lingnan Mingzhu Gymnasium | |- ! colspan=\"6\" | Europe |- | 21 October 2012 | London | United Kingdom | Wembley Arena | | |- ! colspan=\"6\" | Asia |- | 27 October 2012 | Quanzhou | rowspan=\"2\" | China | Straits Sports Centre Arena | rowspan=\"7\" | | |- | 3 November 2012 | Shenzhen | Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre Arena | |- | 16 November 2012 | Bentong | Malaysia | Arena of Stars | |- | 24 November 2012 | Fuzhou | rowspan=\"3\" | China | Fujian Provincial Sports Centre Stadium | |- | 8 December 2012 | Chengdu | Sichuan Gymnasium | |- | 16 December 2012 |Guangzhou | Guangzhou International Sports Arena | |- | 22 December 2012 | rowspan=\"2\" | Taipei | rowspan=\"2\" | Taiwan | rowspan=\"2\" | Taipei Arena | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | 23 December 2012 | Ashin |- | 29 December 2012 | Kunming | rowspan=\"2\" | China | Xinyazhou Sports Center Arena | rowspan=\"2\" | | |- | 5 January 2013 | Yangzhou | Yangzhou Sports Center Arena | |- ! colspan=\"6\" | Oceania |- | 19 February 2013 | Sydney | Australia | The Star Event Centre | | |- ! colspan=\"6\" | Asia |- | 9 March 2013 | Chengdu | rowspan=\"3\" | China | Sichuan Gymnasium | rowspan=\"4\" | | |- | 23 March 2013 | Nanning | Guangxi Sports Center Arena | |- | 30 March 2013 | Yibin | Yibin Sports Center Stadium | |- | 13 April 2013 | Kaohsiung | Taiwan | Kaohsiung Arena | |} ==References== Category:Jolin Tsai concert tours Category:2010 concert tours Category:2011 concert tours Category:2012 concert tours Category:2013 concert tours ",
