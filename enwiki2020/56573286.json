    "text": "Fr\u00f8ya is an island in Fr\u00f8ya municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. The island makes up about 63% of the land area of Fr\u00f8ya municipality. The island lies in a large archipelago of islands in the Fr\u00f8yhavet sea, just northwest of the entrance to the Trondheimsfjorden. The Fr\u00f8yfjorden lies to the south of the island and that separates it from the large island of Hitra. The island is rocky with heather-covered moorland as well as marshes and lakes. There are no naturally forested areas on the island. The highest point on the island is Besselvassheia, at above sea level. The southern and eastern coasts are relatively smooth, but the northern coast is very jagged with many fjords and coves. Sletringen Lighthouse lies at the southwestern tip of the island. The island is connected to the mainland via the Fr\u00f8ya Tunnel which connects it to the neighboring island of Hitra. The island of Hitra is then connected to the mainland by the Hitra Tunnel. ==Name== The name of the island (and municipality) comes from Norse mythology. Although Fr\u00f8ya is a variant of the name of the Norse goddess Freyja, the Old Norse form of the name of the island was Fr\u00f8y or Frey (the ending -a in the modern form is actually the definite article - so the meaning of Fr\u00f8ya is 'the Fr\u00f8y'). Therefore, the name of the island probably has the same root as the name of the Norse god Freyr, brother to Freyja. The names originally were titles: \"lord\" or \"lady\". The oldest meaning of the common word was \"(the one) in front; the foremost, the leading\" and here in the sense \"the island in front of Hitra\". Until 1906 the island and municipality name was spelled Fr\u00f8ien (-en is the definite article in Danish-Norwegian). ==Media gallery== Flatval, Fr\u00f8ya - panoramio.jpg|Flatval Gammelhuset p\u00e5 Fr\u00f8ya - panoramio.jpg|House on Fr\u00f8ya Fylkesveg 451 i Soer- Troendelag.jpg|Road on Fr\u00f8ya Husvika - panoramio.jpg|Husvika Sistranda, Fr\u00f8ya, Norway.jpg|Sistranda Fr\u00f8ya, N\u00f3rsko, apr\u00edl 2016 - panoramio (7).jpg|Plantlife on Fr\u00f8ya Two of everything.jpg|Houses in Titran Titran in the evening.jpg|View of Titran ==See also== *List of islands of Norway ==References== Category:Islands of Tr\u00f8ndelag Category:Fr\u00f8ya, Tr\u00f8ndelag ",
