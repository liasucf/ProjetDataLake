    "text": "A three-letter acronym (TLA), or three-letter abbreviation, is an abbreviation consisting of three letters. These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as etc. and Mrs. are not three-letter acronyms, but \"TLA\" is a TLA (an example of an autological abbreviation). Most three-letter abbreviations are not, strictly, acronyms, but rather initialisms: all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in APA . Some are true acronyms, pronounced as a word; computed axial tomography, CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name () in \"CAT scan\". Even the initialisms are however considered three-letter acronyms, because that term appeared first in widespread use, and is overwhelmingly popular today. ==Examples== * Countries: CAR, UAE, and USA * Famous people: FDR, MLK, OBL, and RDJ * Computer phrases: CPU, DOS, RAM, ROM, and GNU * File extensions: JPG, PDF,and XLS * Corporations: AMD, IBM, and NEC * Currency: USD, GBP, and CHF * Business: CEO, CFO and other C-level officers * Three Letter Agencies: CIA, FBI, CBI, FSB, and NSA * Television networks: ABC (Aus., U.S.), BBC (UK), CBC (Canada, Japan), and NHK (Japan) * Personal advertisements: SBM for Single Black Male, STR for Short Term Relationship * Chemistry, biology, pharmaceuticals: GMO, LSD and MSG * Religion: LDS, SBC and SDA * Clinical medicine: CAD and CHF * Communications shorthand: LOL and OMG * Military and weaponry: BFR and RPG * Wars and political conflicts: HYW and WWI * IATA airport codes: LAX and LHR * Academic testing: ACT, SAT * Canine registries: AKC and CKC * Sports organizations: NFL, MLB, (North America); AFL and NRL (Australia); NPB (Japan); ACB, LFP (Spain); IPL (India), EPL (England), WBO *Ship prefixes: HMS, USS and RMS * State postal abbreviations: NSW, QLD, VIC and TAS (Australia) ==History and origins== The exact phrase three-letter acronym appeared in the sociology literature in 1975. Three-letter acronyms were used as mnemonics in biological sciences, from 1977 and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982. They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing. In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair ZX81 home computer used and explained TLA.Steven Vickers ZX81 Basic Programming, Sinclair Research Limited, page 161 \"As you can see, everything has a three letter abbreviation (TLA).\" The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a JPL report of 1982.TDA Progress Report R. Hull (1982) An Introduction to the new Productivity Information Management System page 176 In 1988, in a paper titled \"On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science\", eminent computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra wrote \"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA ...\"On the cruelty of really teaching computer science By 1992 it was in a Microsoft handbook.Dan Gookin (1992) The Microsoft Guide to Optimizing Windows page 211 ==Combinatorics== The number of possible three- letter abbreviations using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 26 = 17,576. An additional 26 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third position is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336. In standard English, WWW is the TLA whose pronunciation requires the most syllables -- typically nine. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from it being quicker to say the acronym than the phrase it represents; however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables as the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, \"www\" is sometimes abbreviated as \"dubdubdub\" in speech. ==References in popular culture== * As early as 1967, the musical Hair included the song \"Initials\", whose final verse consisted only of TLAs, viz: \"LBJ IRT USA LSD. LSD LBJ FBI CIA. FBI CIA LSD LBJ.\" * In 1999, the author Douglas Adams remarked: \"The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it's short for.\"Douglas Adams, The Independent on Sunday, 1999 * According to the Jargon File, a journalist once asked hacker Paul Boutin what he thought the biggest problem in computing in the 1990s would be. Paul's straight-faced response was: \"There are only 17,000 three-letter acronyms.\" * The Jargon File also mentions the abbreviation \"ETLA\" for \"extended three-letter acronym\" to refer to four-letter acronyms/abbreviations. \"Extended three-letter acronym\" is sometimes abbreviated to \"XTLA\". ==See also== * ISO 4217 (currency code) * List of acronyms * List of airports by IATA code * List of computing and IT abbreviations * List of IOC country codes * List of three-letter broadcast callsigns in the United States * Photographers' abbreviations * Q code * RAS syndrome * Acronym ==References== Category:Abbreviations T ",
