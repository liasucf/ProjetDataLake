    "text": "TM (formerly known as Islacom, Touch Mobile, and Republika ng TM and also known as TM Tambayan) is a cellular service brand of Philippine telecommunications company Globe Telecom. ==History== TM was launched on September 12, 2001 as Touch Mobile, initially catering to the middle income market, and has since covered lower-income groups as well, making it Globe's value brand offering. The service has gained popularity for its discounted call and messaging services, with the \"All Network\" offers allowing TM subscribers to communicate with users from other local networks. Touch Mobile was started as the first mobile brand in the Philippines that introduced voice messaging system in 2001. Due to the majority of SMS users, the voice messaging system was discontinued and instead focused on SMS-based services. ==Rebranding== In 2005, the brand was relaunched as TM \"Ang Bagong Touch Mobile\" (Filipino: The new Touch Mobile), and then as TM \"Pinalakas na Touch Mobile\" (Filipino: The stronger Touch Mobile) while keeping the slogan \"Power to the People!\", reaching even subscribers of low income and rural communities. Its new name Republika ng TM (Filipino: Republic of TM) and slogan \"Astig Tayo Dito!\" (Filipino: We are cool here!), was introduced in 2009. == Slogans == {|class=\"wikitable table\" ! Year !!
