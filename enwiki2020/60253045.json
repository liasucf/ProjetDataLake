It had a soft opening in March 2019 and will have a total of 96,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, 280,000 square feet of office space and 608 luxury apartments. This was reduced from an original plan for more density in a 2015 compromise with community groups. Tenants will include Sephora, Soul Cycle, Shake Shack, Salt & Straw and Blue Bottle Coffee. International Smoke will be a restaurant by San Francisco celebrity chef Michael Mina and cookbook author Ayesha Curry. ==References== Category:Mixed-use developments in California Category:Carmel Valley, San Diego Category:Shopping malls in San Diego County, California ",
