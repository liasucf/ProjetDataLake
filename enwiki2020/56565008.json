Boundaries for the part of Woolundunga within the City of Port Augusta in the west were proclaimed on 17 February 1994 while the part within the District Council of Mount Remarkable in the east was added on 13 March 1997. The locality\u2019s name is of Aboriginal origin and is considered by the South Australian historian, Geoffrey Manning, to be derived from the name of \u201csprings near Mount Brown\u201d claimed to belong to a group of Aboriginal people with \u201cthe same name.\u201d The name was used in 1851 for a pastoral enterprise called the \u2018Woolundunga Run\u2019 which was established by J. Pat(t)erson on pastoral lease no. 32 and which was located in part of the locality due to the presence of two homestead ruins both bearing the name within the current boundaries. Woolundunga is bounded in part by roads including the Horrocks Pass Road (B56) which passes through the pass of the same name on its southern side and the Augusta Highway which forms its western boundary. Land use within the locality is concerned with \u2018primary industry\u2019 activities dominated by pastoralism and other classes of agriculture with land in the locality\u2019s east being zoned to preserve \u201cthe natural and rural character and scenic features.\u201d Woolundunga is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart and the local government areas of the City of Port Augusta and the District Council of Mount Remarkable. ==References== Category:Towns in South Australia Category:Far North (South Australia) ",
