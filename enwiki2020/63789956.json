A veteran of World War I, Filatov rose to brigade command during the Russian Civil War and was decorated for his actions. He held division command in the 1920s and 1930s between military education and served as a corps commander and deputy commander of an army and a front in the late 1930s. Shortly before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, he became commander of the 13th Army in Belarus, which suffered heavy losses in the opening weeks of the war. He was mortally wounded in an air raid on 8 July and died a week later. == Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War == Born on 18 August 1893 in Rzhev to Russian parents considered bourgeois, Filatov served in the Imperial Russian Army from 1914. He fought in World War I on the Western Front as a ryadovoy, then was promoted to junior unter- ofitser. After graduating from the Dusheti School of Ensigns as a praporshchik, Filatov served as an assistant course commander, junior officer, and company commander. He ended his service in the Imperial Army as a podporuchik. After joining the Red Army in 1918 during the Russian Civil War, Filatov fought against Polish troops on the Western Front and against anti- Soviet forces in Belarus as a platoon commander, an officer for drill parts of a rifle regiment, as assistant commander of the 145th Rifle Regiment of the 17th Rifle Division. He became commander of the 147th Rifle Regiment of the division and from July 1920 commanded the division's 51st Rifle Brigade, distinguishing himself in the Polish\u2013Soviet War. In recognition of his performance, Filatov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner twice, in 1920 and 1921. == Interwar period == In 1922, Filatov graduated from Higher Academic Courses at the Red Army Military Academy. He served as commander of the 50th Rifle Regiment, assistant commander, acting commander, and again as assistant commander of the 17th Rifle Division during this period.

Transferred to the Far East during June 1938 to serve as deputy commander of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army (OKDVA), Filatov continued in that position for the 1st Separate Red Banner Army when the OKDVA was split in September of that year. He received the Order of the Red Star during the year for successful management of combat training, and became a lieutenant general when the Red Army introduced general officer ranks on 4 June 1940. After another reorganization, he became deputy commander of the forces of the new Far Eastern Front in June 1940. A few weeks before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, on 26 May 1941, Filatov was appointed commander of the new 13th Army of the Western Special Military District in Belarus, then a headquarters without assigned troops. == World War II == After Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June, the army was assigned troops.
