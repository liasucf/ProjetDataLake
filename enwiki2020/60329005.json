The independent Vandals were led by second-year head coach Joe Cipriano and played their home games on campus at the Memorial Gymnasium in Moscow, Idaho. In the four years between the demise of the Pacific Coast Conference (1959) and the founding of the Big Sky Conference (1963), Idaho was an independent; this season the Vandals had a record. During this season, Vandal great Gus Johnson was a sophomore at Boise Junior College and averaged thirty points and twenty rebounds a game for the Broncos; he transferred to Idaho in 1962 and played the following season. ==References== ==External links== *Sports Reference \u2013 Idaho Vandals: 1961\u201362 basketball season *Gem of the Mountains: 1962 University of Idaho yearbook \u2013 1961\u201362 basketball season *Idaho Argonaut \u2013 student newspaper \u2013 1962 editions Category:Idaho Vandals men's basketball seasons Idaho Idaho ",
