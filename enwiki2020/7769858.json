It is bordered on the west by Union Pacific Railroad, on the west and north by Loop 1, on the south by Braker Lane, and on the east by Burnet Road. The initial phase of the project was completed in March 2007. ==Initial development== The property for what would eventually become The Domain was purchased from IBM by the Endeavor Real Estate Group in 1999 and from Multech,http://www.jbgoodwin.com/news_articles/Domain%20is%20Growing- Jan.%2031,%202012.pdf with the financial assistance of the Blackstone Group and JER Partners. The initial plan had been to create a campus for the dot-com industry but those plans fell through when the dot-com bubble burst. In 2003, the Simon Property Group and the Endeavor Real Estate Group entered into a collaborative partnership to develop Phase I of The Domain's retail area. 2004 saw the demolition of Century Oaks Park, a multi-purpose recreational facility for IBM employees and their families, and the start of construction on the initial Domain: Phase I. Additional land for The Domain was reclaimed from vacant IBM manufacturing and administrative buildings, as well as driveways and parking lots that were once part of the original IBM campus. The developers were granted tax subsidies in 2003 from the City of Austin and Travis County. Total developer compensation is a maximum of a net present value of $25 million. The developer keeps 80 percent of the city's sales tax for the first five years and 50 percent for the next 15 years. Plus, 25 percent of the property tax is rebated back to the developer for the entire 20-year period.Recommendation for Council Action #1705, Agenda Item No. 4 (PDF), City of Austin, May 15, 2003.
