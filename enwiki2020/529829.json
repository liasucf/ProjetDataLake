She was North East of East Falkland, having just taken part (or just completing) a 'Vertrep' ('Vertical Replenishment'... a helicopter stores transfer) and/or 'RAS' (Replenishment at Sea) with the 'SS Atlantic Conveyor' (with whom she had been sailing the same track with all day) when the 'Air Raid Warning Red Alarm' sounded, and the two ships took evasive action. 'RFA Regent' carried on supplying the Task Force until the third week of August, becoming one of the longest-serving ships that took part in the Conflict. She eventually arrived back in the UK at (Rosyth, in Scotland) on 15 September, after 148 days at sea, and replenishing most of the ships in the RN at least once.
