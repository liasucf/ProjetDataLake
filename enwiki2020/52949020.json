In the Europe/Africa Zone there were three different tiers, called groups, in which teams competed against each other to advance to the upper tier. Winners in Group I advanced to the World Group Play-offs, along with losing teams from the World Group first round. Teams who lost their respective ties competed in the relegation play-offs, with winning teams remaining in Group I, whereas teams who lost their play-offs were relegated to the Europe/Africa Zone Group II in 2018. ==Participating nations== Seeds: All seeds and ' received a bye into the second round. # # # # Remaining nations: * * * * * * * ===Draw=== ==First round== ===Bosnia and Herzegovina vs. Poland=== ===Belarus vs. Romania=== ===Portugal vs. Israel=== ==Second round== ===Slovakia vs. Hungary=== ===Bosnia and Herzegovina vs. Netherlands=== ===Belarus vs. Austria=== ===Portugal vs. Ukraine=== ==1st round play-offs== ===Austria vs. Romania=== ===Israel vs. Ukraine=== ==2nd round play-offs== ===Slovakia vs. Poland=== ===Israel vs. Romania=== ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Asia/Oceania Zone Group I Category:Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone ",
