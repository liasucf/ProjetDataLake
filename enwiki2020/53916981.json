Across the country, cultural institutions, school districts, municipalities, state legislatures, public servants, and Arab Americans engage in special events that celebrate our community\u2019s rich heritage and numerous contributions to society. During a time of heightened hate crimes, bigotry, and misunderstanding towards the Arab American community, it is more imperative than ever to use education and information sharing to embrace the Arab culture, dispel stereotypes, and empower the next generation of Arab American trailblazers. Arab America (www.arabamerica.com), and the Arab America Foundation, an organization dedicated to promoting the Arab American identity and heritage, hava formed a national advisory committee of over eighty Arab Americans from over twenty-six states to approach state legislatures, city councils, school board members and other public officials to issue NAAHM proclamations and adopt the Arab American educator curriculum kit, which was disseminated to school districts across the nation as part of the month-long celebration. History Beginning in the '90s, Arab American heritage was celebrated sporadically in various states, primarily in school districts. It wasn't until 2017 when Arab America began a national initiative to coordinate all states under National Arab American Heritage Month. In 2017, Arab America asked U.S. Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell (D-MI), to issue a congressional resolution proclaiming National Arab American Heritage Month. Also in 2017, Arab America invited over 200 dignitaries and opinion leaders from the Arab American community to a commemorative reception in Washington DC at which Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and the Mayor of Washington DC, Muriel Bowser, attended. Arab American Heritage Month 2019 In 2019, as a result of Arab America's national advisory committee, 109 proclamations from 26 states were issued by state legislatures, municipalities, counties, and school districts. See National Arab American Heritage Month press release. Arab American Heritage Month 2020 In April 2020, amidst the Coronavirus pandemic, Arab America highlighted the contributions of Arab Americans, especially in the fields of public service, medicine, law enforcement, non-profits, and businesses that were making a difference during the crisis. Due to social distancing directives which prohibited a live event, on Sunday, April 26th, the Arab America Foundation hosted an unprecedented online commemoration for National Arab American Heritage Month with members of Congress, cultural artists, and members from the Arab American community. The event was attended by over 500 registrants. Proclamations were received from 22 state governors who proclaimed April 2020 to be National Arab American Heritage Month. The following states participated: Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Washington DC. With most school students at home, the Arab America Foundation developed a digital online Educator\u2019s Curriculum Kit which highlighted the history of Arab migration to America, geographic understanding of the Arab world, Arab American diversity in faith and language, interesting customs and traditions, issues affecting the community, and achievements in business, politics, education. Arab America shared compelling stories of Arab Americans who are giving back to their communities during the coronavirus crisis on their blog page.
