    "text": "Greifensee is a municipality in the district of Uster in the canton of Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland. ==History== Castle of Greifensee ===Early history=== Settlements in Greifensee date back in 4000 B.C.. In 1975, a Neolithic stilt house village located on the northern shore of the Lake Greifen area called B\u00f6schen was discovered by recreational divers. Initially, they found ceramics, lavishly decorated pots and bowls, and simple, large food tanks. In scientific dives, the remains of a village with 24 huts have been revealed. The excellent condition of the timber relicts allows dendrochronological dating to the year 1051 B.C. Weaving spindles made of clay, tools, needles and fishing hooks from bronze, charred wild apples and cereals have been conserved. Ten years after its construction, the settlement was destroyed by a fire and not rebuilt. For the subsequent years, in the canton of Z\u00fcrich various archaeological relicts have been found, such as heavy bronze bracelets, glass, mainly bronze fibulas and flint blades probably from the Mediterranean and France. Relicts dating to the Roman period have been found in neighbouring municipalities, in Riedikon (Uster), and about nine kilometers away near Pf\u00e4ffikon ZH located at Lake Pf\u00e4ffikon (Irgenhausen Castrum). ===Middle Ages=== Execution of the defenders of Greifensee during the Old Z\u00fcrich War, from Schodeler's chronicle, ca. 1515. Probably in the late 12th century, a tower house (later Castle of Greifensee) was built at the location of a small village, estimated to be a settlement by the Counts of Rapperswil. On April 29, 1260, \u00abR. et H. minstri de Grifense\u00bb are mentioned. Greifensee was a bailiwick (Landvogtei, Amt), of Rapperswil, of Toggenburg and of Z\u00fcrich, during 1300-1798\\. On January 7, 1300, Greifensee was given by Elisabeth von Rapperswil-Habsburg-Laufenburg, the sister of Rudolf V, Count of Rapperswil, to the nobleman Hermann II of Landenberg. His son, Hermann IV (the younger Marshal), fortified the small town, Greifensee castle and the city walls. He donated, for his salvation and on his wife's favour, the Gallus Chapel around 1330\u20131340, Greifensee's former Parish church, too. In 1369, the Amt of Greifensee was sold to Count Friedrich Donat Diethelm of Toggenburg; in early 1402, Friedrich VII sold it to the city of Z\u00fcrich, and beginning in 1419, Greifensee is the first country bailiwick of the city of Z\u00fcrich. Wildsberg Aerial view from 250 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1927) In May 1444, during the Old Z\u00fcrich War, the Old Swiss Confederacy laid siege to Greifensee which was held by about 70 defenders, most of them inhabitants of the Amt Greifensee with a few Habsburg and Z\u00fcrich soldiers. The town was captured after four weeks, on May 27, and all but two of the surviving 64 defenders were beheaded on the next day, including the leader, Wildhans von Breitenlandenberg. Breitenlandenberg's body was brought to his family, the bodies of the other surrenders were buried at the Uster church. Even in times of war, mass execution was widely considered a cruel and unjust deed. On May 29, the Castle of Greifensee and the city walls were broken. ===Early modern and modern history=== In the year 1520, Z\u00fcrich decided to reconstruct the ruins as residence of Z\u00fcrich's Landv\u00f6gte among them Heinrich Biberli (1403), Gerold Edlibach (1504) and Salomon Landolt (1776).
