It offers the functionality of orthodox file managers through an interface similar to the familiar Windows Explorer. Some of its features are tabbed file management within each pane, viewing and editing text files, searching for files using arbitrary criteria, the ability to compare and synchronize folders and the ability to perform queued or concurrent copy and move operations with error handling (robust file transfer). The file finder module is claimed to be \u201coutclass\u201d from other search tools. xplorer\u00b2 comes in two paid varieties, professional and ultimate. The ultimate version is more expensive but includes a faster search engine (it integrates with Windows Search) and is portable (can be run off a USB stick) Apart from the commercial version of the program, there is also a version which is free for personal and academic use. Three features of the Professional version not present in the Lite version are advanced search (Omni-Finder), full Unicode support and robust transfer. xplorer\u00b2 has been in constant development since 2002.
