    "text": "Oh, No! It's Devo is the fifth studio album by the American new wave band Devo. It was originally released in October 1982, on the labels Warner Bros. and Virgin. The album was recorded over a period of four months, between May and September 1982, at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles. By the time of its release, Devo were a full-fledged synth-pop act, with guitar-based new wave sounds pushed more towards the background. Most of the music on Oh, No! It's Devo was created by electronic means, giving it a much different sound than the band's earlier albums, such as their 1978 debut Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!, which relied more on guitars than synthesizers. This alienated some fans, despite the band stating since at least 1978 that their goal was to \"de- emphasize\" guitars. The album was produced by prominent producer Roy Thomas Baker, who had notably worked with, among others, Queen and The Cars. ==Background== According to a 1982 interview with lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh, the album was titled Oh, No! It's Devo because \"there are many people out there who, when they hear we're around again or have one more album coming out, that is their reaction.\"Mark of Devo, Interview 1982 In later interviews, Devo's co-founder and bass guitarist Gerald Casale stated that the album was born out of critical reviews in which the band were alternately described as both \"fascists\" and \"clowns.\"Express Milwaukee: \"Devo is like the House Band on the Titanic\", Alan Scully, 30 June 2010 In response, the band decided to make an album that would answer the question, \"what would an album by fascist clowns sound like?\"Jerry Casale interview at South by Southwest Conference, 2009 The song \"I Desire\" brought the band controversy, as the lyrics were taken directly from a poem written by John Hinckley, Jr., who had attempted to assassinate U.S. President Ronald Reagan in an effort to impress actress Jodie Foster.Rolling Stone Magazine: I Desire \"Big Mess\" was inspired by letters sent to a game show host by someone using the name \"Cowboy Kim\".Devo-Obsesso: The Cowboy Kim Letters Devo took on another new look for this album, wearing black T-shirts and slacks with white \"Spud Ring\" collars. In concert, these were augmented with Freedom of Choice era energy domes and New Traditionalists era shirts and ascots for part of the performance. The LP jacket had a cutout stand on the back so it could be stood up like a picture frame. ==Promotional music videos== Devo produced three music videos for the album: \"Time Out for Fun,\" \"Peek-a-Boo!\" and \"That's Good.\" All three videos eschewed Devo's previous narrative style for a basic performance against a bluescreen background displaying related visuals to the song. These were intended to replicate the band's intentions for the forthcoming tour for those who would be unable to attend. The video for \"That's Good\" ran into censorship troubles on MTV, as the juxtaposition of a cartoon french fry penetrating the hole of a doughnut and quickly cutting to a writhing, smiling nude woman, shot from the neck up, was considered too risqu\u00e9 for airplay. Band member and video director Gerald Casale later elaborated in an interview for the 33\u2153 series book Devo's Freedom of Choice in 2015: > \"We got this call from [MTV co-founder] Les Garland, He was like, 'Look, we > know what you're trying to do here.' I go, What do you mean? He goes, 'Ya > know, when that cartoon French fry glides through that cartoon donut and > then it's with the girl looking happy. You can have the French fry, or you > can have the donut, but you can't have the French fry and the donut, > Otherwise, you can't cut to the girl.' And I go, 'But what about when the > French fry hits the donut and breaks in half and she's sad?' And he goes > 'Alright you little smart ass.' It was horrible. Then I go, 'What about that > Billy Idol video you have and the girls are in skin-tight pants and their > asses are full on in the screen and his head is between her legs and then > somebody slaps her ass? What about that?' He goes, 'we're talking about you, > we're not talking about them.\" Casale eventually relented and made significant cuts to the video, which he came to regret, as \"the song was going down in the charts, not up.\" ==Tour== Devo's tour for the album replicated the look they sported in the music videos for at least the first half of the concert. Each concert began with Devo playing seven songs from the album that were performed against a 12-foot, rear-projected background which presented synchronized video. For several songs, members of the band interacted with the visuals, such as being kicked down by a giant pirate at the end of \"Peek-a-Boo!\", or shooting icons of unsynchronized dancing girls in \"Out of Sync.\" After the screen was removed, it revealed Devo being lit by computerized moving lighting effects with Panaspots provided by Morpheus Lights. The Oh, No! It's Devo tour was the second concert tour known to utilize computerized moving lights, about one year after Genesis used 50 Vari-Lites (VL1's) on their Abacab tour. While Genesis had opted for a big and colorful look with its use of lighting, Devo opted for a more subtle approach. The first show of the tour took place on October 30, 1982 at the Warner Beverly Hills Theater in Beverly Hills, California, and was filmed and transmitted live in 3-D to college campuses around the country. It was billed as \"3-DEVO,\" and featured Wall of Voodoo as the opening act. However, this performance was marred by technical mishaps: the film went out of sync with the backing track during \"Speed Racer,\" forcing the band to abandon the performance of \"Big Mess\"; Mark Mothersbaugh's microphone cut out during \"Out of Sync\" and he was forced to perform the rest of the first set with guitarist Bob Mothersbaugh's microphone; and during the performance of \"Peek-a-Boo!,\" a female fan jumped onto the stage and started dancing with the band, blocking the visuals. In the second half of the show, the 3-D effects were ineffective and the band attacked the company providing the video twice: once during \"Jocko Homo,\" with a series of cheap 3-D tricks (mostly snake nut cans) by Mothersbaugh; and once in a rant during \"Beautiful World,\" delivered by the character Booji Boy. This concert featured the only known live performance of \"Explosions\". The \"3-DEVO\" concert was later rebroadcast in a severely edited form on pay-per-view television, omitting the snide remarks and the technical gaffes. Both versions are available as bootlegs, and several audio recordings of the tour exist in varying quality. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Date !Venue !Notes |- |October 30 |Warner Beverly Hills Theatre, Beverly Hills, CA |Concert was filmed and broadcast live in 3-D, being the first live 3-D broadcast in history. |- |November 3 |Northrup Auditorium, Minneapolis, MN | |- |November 5 |Holiday Star Theatre, Merrillville, IN |\"Explosions\" is removed from the setlist, \"Come Back Jonee\" and \"Devo Corporate Anthem\" are added. |- |November 6 |Fox Theatre, Detroit, MI | |- |November 7 |Michigan State University Auditorium, East Lansing, MI | |- |November 9 |Cleveland Music Hall, Cleveland, OH | |- |November 10 |Massey Hall, Toronto, ON, Canada |\"Devo Corporate Anthem\" is removed from Setlist |- |November 11 |Orpheum Theatre, Boston, MA |\"Mongoloid\" and \"Come Back Jonee\" are removed from Setlist |- |November 12 |West Hartford Music Hall, West Hartford, CT | |- |November 13 |Tower Theater, Upper Darby, PA |Devo played twice on this date |- |November 14 |Elting Gymnasium, SUNY, New Paltz, NY | |- |November 16 |Stanley Theatre, Pittsburgh, PA |\"Deep Sleep\" is not performed at this show, \"Mongoloid\" and \"Come Back Jonee\" are added back. |- |November 17 |Warner Theatre, Washington, DC |\"Deep Sleep\" and \"Devo Corporate Anthem\" are added back to the setlist. |- |November 18 |Late Night with David Letterman, New York, NY |TV Appearance, performing \"That's Good\" |- |November 19 |rowspan = \"2\"|The Palladium, New York, NY | |- |November 20 |\"Patterns\" and \"Peek-A-Boo\" are removed from the setlist |- |November 23 |Fox Theatre, Atlanta, GA | |- |November 26 |Jai-Alai Fronton, Tampa, FL | |- |November 27 |Maurice Gusman Cultural Center, Miami, FL |Devo performed twice on this date |- |November 29 |Saenger Theater, New Orleans, LA | |- |November 30 |Cullen Auditorium, University Of Houston, Houston, TX | |- |December 1 |Dallas Convention Center Arena, Dallas, TX | |- |December 2 |Lester E.
