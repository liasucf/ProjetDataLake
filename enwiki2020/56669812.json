It premiered on June 17, 2019 following a preview of the first episode on DisneyNow and YouTube three days earlier, and the show's first season concluded on July 18. On May 15, 2019, a month before the series premiere, the series was renewed for a second season which premiered on July 11, 2020. Ahead of the second season premiere, the series was renewed for a third season. ==Premise== The series chronicles the adventures of an independent and fearless 13-year-old Thai-American girl named Anne Boonchuy. After stealing a mysterious music box on her birthday at the advice of her friend, Sasha Waybright, Anne is magically transported to the world of Amphibia, a wild marshland tropical island full of anthropomorphic amphibians and threatening creatures. There Anne meets the excitable young frog named Sprig Plantar; unpredictable and adventurous baby pollywog Polly Plantar, the youngest member of the Plantar family; and overprotective and traditional grandfather Hop Pop who will guide her to be a true hero while discovering the first true friendship of her life as she lives with her newfound family. In addition, she also discovers that Sasha has sided with the villainous Captain Grime. In season two, Anne and the Plantars go on a road trip to Amphibia's capital Newtopia to figure out the mystery behind the Calamity Box and to find a way to get Anne, Marcy, and Sasha back home. While Anne reunites with Marcy, Newtopia's King Andrias secretly has plans for them.

According to his Twitter account, he had been working on the series for almost two years before being greenlit. The show was based on Braly's childhood trips to Bangkok, Thailand. James Turner, a British illustrator most well known for his work on the Pok\u00e9mon series of games (having created several Pok\u00e9mon designs and worked as the art director for Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield), provided artwork during the initial stages of the project. On February 19, 2018, Amphibia was greenlit by Disney Channel alongside The Owl House. On March 25, 2019, it was revealed that Brenda Song would return to Disney as the voice of Anne Boonchuy. On May 15, 2019, Disney Channel renewed Amphibia for a second season ahead of its premiere. Among the announced guest stars were Marlow Barkley, Mia and Ella Allan. Rough Draft Korea, Sunmin Image Pictures, and Saerom each provide animation, The animators spend three to four months working on pre-production, with an episode taking about nine months to complete. Forty staff members at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California also worked on the series. On June 23, 2020, the show was renewed for a third season ahead of its second season premiere. The writing team for the series is three women, something Braly felt necessary due to the show centering on a teenager girl. Storyboard artists are allowed to pitch their own ideas for an episode, a practice Braly took from his time at Gravity Falls. === Music === T. J. Hill composed the score for the series.Exciting update time! I am thrilled to announce that I am the composer for a new @DisneyChannel series called Amphibia! The show debuts Monday, June 17! Huge thank you to @Radrappy and the entire Amphibia crew for the opportunity to be a part of this incredible series. During production on the series, Leslie Wolfhard, wife of storyboard artist Steve Wolfhard, pitched to the producers a song, which they ended up using in the season 1 episode \"Taking Charge\". In July 23, 2020, Hill created a SoundCloud playlist featuring 10 tracks from the first season's score. A song titled \"Welcome to Amphibia\", performed by Celia Gray Westbook, was originally intended to serve as the series' theme song. However, the song was later discarded in favor of an instrumental theme. According to Braly, \"Welcome to Amphibia\" was written due to orders from Disney, but he eventually convinced the studio to use an instrumental theme instead, as he disliked the song because he felt it didn't fit with neither the show nor its main character. === Marketing === On July 19, 2018, during the Star vs. the Forces of Evil and Big City Greens panel at San Diego Comic- Con, Disney released an early version of the intro for the series. On April 26, 2019, Disney FanFest released a music video for a vocal version of the opening theme titled \u2033Welcome to Amphibia\u2033 performed by Celica Gray Westbrook and a two-minute clip during a livestream. It was discussed to be used as the intro song. On May 14, 2019, Disney Channel released the trailer. On May 17, 2019, Disney Channel released the final version of the intro. Amphibia also included shorts, beginning with Teen Girl in a Frog World. The shorts premiered on September 3, 2019. == Episodes == ===Series overview=== ===Season 1 (2019)=== ===Season 2 (2020)=== It was announced by D23 that four of the season's 20 episodes will be 22-minute specials. ==Shorts== ===Teen Girl in a Frog World (2019)=== A series of shorts began airing depicting Anne encountering oddities in Amphibia with the Plantars.

Common Sense Medias Emily Ashby praised the series for its characters and themes, writing that \"Sprig and Anne's adventures are a joy to behold, mostly thanks to their delightfully compatible personalities and the sweet friendship that develops between them\" and that \"the story illustrates issues like bullying and emotional manipulation in ways that will resonate with kids and tweens and can prompt discussions about the topics\". Bekah Burbank of LaughingPlace.com praised the series' ability to balance its humor and its terror elements, as well as its pacing, characters, and animation, stating that \"Amphibia is clever and goofy with plenty of jokes to keep kids laughing and just enough scary content to hold their attention. The show moves quickly and is broken into two 11-minute episodes that, at least for the premiere, form one complete chapter. The animation is bouncy and colorful and the characters are a delight\". Colliders Dave Trumbore gave the series' first two episodes a 4 stars rating, feeling that they \"[served] as a great introduction to the series\". ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2020s American animated television series Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:Animated television series about frogs and toads Category:Animated television series about teenagers Category:Disney Channel original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by Disney Television Animation Category:Asian-American television ",
