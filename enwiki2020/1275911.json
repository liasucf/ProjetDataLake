It is approximately east of Melbourne's central business district and both shopping centres are centrally located within the Box Hill shopping precinct and Whitehorse City Council's Principal Activity Centre. ==History== ===Box Hill Central - North=== Box Hill Central - North was originally constructed in the early 1970s. It was opened in 1975 as a three level regional shopping centre, called Whitehorse Plaza. It housed anchor tenants such as Coles, Kmart Australia, Venture, with other notable tenants being Sussans, Williams The Shoeman, Priceline, Lincraft, Medicare and more retailers, eateries, and services. Although, due to lack of tenants, it was closed down in 2000. The shopping centre was completely redeveloped, which consisted of demolition of all tenancies within the shopping centre, reconfigure of the main shopping centre layout & car parks as well as major refurbishment of the external as well as the internal facades. It was reopened on 1 July 2003 by Centro Properties Group as Centro Whitehorse (although called Whitehorse City while under redevelopment), now a two level regional shopping centre with Coles and Best & Less clothing store. In 2007 Centro Whitehorse was re branded as Centro Box Hill North and partially redeveloped, with Best & Less being closed down and expanded/renovated to a brand new Harris Scarfe store, now the flagship store in Victoria. In 2013 it was rebranded to Box Hill Central - North, as a result of an organisation wide rebranding of all centres owned by Federation Limited. On February 2nd, 2020, Harris Scarfe closed it store at Box Hill, as part of its restructure and downsizing of its store count. It is also common for faith groups to share tracks and cheerful Christmas music in the outdoor areas. Particularly, multi- cultural groups featuring a certain Tzar Maher have been found to be effective. With his ethnicity providing beautiful juxtaposition in the Asian- dominated demographics of the patrons, his voice, hair and even beard, have impacted observers and astonished on-lookers alike. Others have also proven effective. Andrew Llort (JCfan), \"Go Chew a Bomb\", Senpai Alicia, Vincent and Peking Duck have also been seen in the area. ===Box Hill Central - South=== Box Hill Central - South was originally constructed in the early 1980s, when the old Box Hill railway station, and level crossing was removed, and Market and Main Streets were closed to traffic.

In 2010, the shopping centre was again redeveloped, with Target converted into Big W, and Safeway being converted to Woolworths. In 2013, it was again rebranded, as Box Hill Central - South, as a result of an organisation wide rebranding of all centres owned by Federation Limited Unusually, the shopping centre has a large indoor fresh food market located along the eastern edge of the complex.
