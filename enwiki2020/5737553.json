He has challenged twice for a light middleweight world title in 2013 and 2016, and once for a unified middleweight world title in 2018. ==Early life== Vanes was born on May 1, 1986, in Abovyan, Armenia. Vanes' father, Norik Martirosyan, was an amateur boxer in Armenia who worked for an industrial company and was also in the army. Vanes has two brothers, one older and one younger, and a sister. His family moved to Glendale, California when he was four years old. He started boxing when he was seven after his father found out there was a gym in Glendale. Martirosyan was taken out of junior high school by his father and became home-schooled once it had become clear that he needed to keep his son's fighting confined to the ring. ==Amateur career== Martirosyan was an eight-time National Champion and a Golden Gloves Champion. In 2004, after winning a match against Haiti's Andre Berto in the 1st AIBA American 2004 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Tijuana, Mexico, Martirosyan secured a spot in the US Olympic Team. He represented the United States at the 2004 Olympics as a Welterweight. He was on the same olympic team as Andre Ward and Andre Dirrell. Results were: *Defeated Benamar Meskine (Algeria) 45\u201320 *Lost to Lorenzo Aragon Armenteros (Cuba) 11\u201320 Notable boxers Martirosyan defeated as an amateur include Austin Trout (three times), Andre Berto, and Timothy Bradley. He finished his amateur career with 120 wins and 10 losses. All losses except to Lorenzo Aragon had been avenged in rematches. ==Professional career== ===Early career=== Vanes fights Taronze Washington at the Honda Center, Anaheim, California At the age of 20, Martirosyan turned professional at 154 pounds with Bob Arum's promotional company Top Rank. Vanes is managed by his uncle, Serge Martirosyan. He is also co-managed by Shelly Finkel, who also manages and advises world champions such as Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko, Evander Holyfield, Manny Pacquiao, among others. Vanes was trained by Freddie Roach, who was voted 2003 and 2006 Trainer of the Year by the Boxing Writers Association of America. He trains alongside Roach's other top students, including Manny Pacquiao and Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, Jr.. Martirosyan has also worked with Ronnie Shields, winning his first fight under Shields's tutelage when he knocked out Dan Wallace in one round. Martirosyan subsequently scored a shutout unanimous decision over Clarence Taylor, and also recorded wins against Billy Lyell (who would later topple previously unbeaten John Duddy), Harrison Cuello, Andrey Tsurkan and Willie Lee. Martirosyan was scheduled to make his HBO debut on June 5, 2010 in Yankee Stadium on the Miguel Cotto vs. Yuri Foreman undercard. His opponent was fellow undefeated prospect Joe Greene (22-0, 14 KOs). Martirosyan handed Greene the first loss of his career by way of unanimous decision. With this win Martirosyan, advanced to 28-0 with 17 wins coming by way of knockout. On March 19, 2011 Vanes made his next appearance in the ring at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec. He got an easy win over Mexican Bladimir Hernandez by way of KO in the second round. His next fight was against veteran Sa\u00fal Rom\u00e1n in a WBC semi-final title eliminator for the vacant WBC Silver Light Middleweight Championship. The bout was on June 4, 2011 in HBO's televised portion of the Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, Jr. vs. Sebastian Zbik undercard. Rom\u00e1n knocked Vanes down in the first round and gave him trouble in the next two. Martirosyan came back in the fourth and fifth. When the seventh round began, Rom\u00e1n cornered Vanes against the ropes and landed several blows. Vanes may have caught Rom\u00e1n just in time from being stopped. In the same round, Vanes trapped Rom\u00e1n against the ropes and knocked him down. After Rom\u00e1n got up, Vanes landed a hard right hook on his chin and followed up with a barrage of blows while Rom\u00e1n was leaning on the ropes, causing the fight to be stopped and turning what seemed to be near- defeat into victory. On October 29, 2011 Vanes fought contender Richard Gutierrez. Vanes dominated from start to finish and won a ten round unanimous decision. The judges' scorecards were 100-90, 100-90 and 99-91; Vanes winning all but one round from one judge. Martirosyan fought veteran Troy Lowry on the Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, Jr. vs. Marco Antonio Rubio undercard.

The fight was contested over 10 rounds. Martirosyan lost a contentious unanimous decision. He was considered the more aggressive fighter. The scores were 97-93, 96-94, 96-94. Martirosyan felt he won the fight. ===Martirosyan vs. Golovkin=== On May 5th, 2018 Martirosyan fought unified Middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin at the StubHub Center in Carson, California after he was chosen as the late replacement for Canelo \u00c1lvarez when Canelo withdrew from the much anticipated Cinco De Mayo rematch in the wake of his failed drug tests for Clenbuterol. With only three weeks of preparation for the bout and almost two years since his last professional fight, Martirosyan faced long odds against the undefeated middleweight champion. Although he performed better than expected in the opening round of the fight, Martirosyan eventually succumbed to Golovkin's power and suffered a quick defeat via knock out in the 2nd round. When speaking of Golovkin's power in the post-fight, Martirosyan said it felt like he was \"being hit by a train.\" Golovkin said, \"It feels great to get a knockout. Vanes is a very good fighter. He caught me a few times in the first round. In the second round, I came out all business after I felt him out in the first round.\" For the fight, Golovkin landed 36 of 84 punches thrown (43%) and Martirosyan landed 18 of his 73 thrown (25%). Martirosyan received a purse of $225,000 for the fight.
