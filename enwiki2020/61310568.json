On her return journey, she broke the women's world record for the fastest ride from Sydney to Melbourne, previously held by Elsa Barbour. == Cycling career == \"Billie\" Samuel was the daughter of R. M. Samuel, a Sydney musician. She was working as a waitress and had only been cycling for a few months when she decided to ride from Melbourne to Sydney, a 575-mile trip, in an attempt to beat the women's world record for that distance. The record at the time was held by Elsa Barbour for her 1932 ride from Sydney to Melbourne. Samuel was trained by controversial Australian endurance cyclist Ossie Nicholson who had been banned for allegedly interfering with another record attempt. His ban was lifted eventually after Samuel completed her ride from Melbourne to Sydney in May 1934. It took her 3 days, 17 hours, and 2 minutes, which was not fast enough to beat Barbour's record of 3 days, 7 hours, and 32 minutes. Samuel crashed twice on her ride and faced inclement weather. On July 4, 1934, Samuel left Sydney to ride back to Melbourne, attempting again to beat Barbour's record. This time, the weather was fair, and Samuel succeeded in setting the new world record of 3 days, 1 hour, and 20 minutes. Samuel weighed 91 lbs. at the time, making her the lightest woman champion, a record she held until at least 1971. Billie Samuel leaving to ride to Melbourne on a Malvern Star bicycle, 4 July 1934, by Sam Hood. After returning to Melbourne, Samuel announced that she also wanted to beat Elsa Barbour's world record for the fastest ride between Melbourne and Adelaide. Samuel's Sydney-to-Melbourne record was beaten in 1937 by Joyce Barry. == References == == External links == Category:1911 births Category:Australian female cyclists Category:Sportspeople from Victoria (Australia) Category:Possibly living people ",
