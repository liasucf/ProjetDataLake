It started operations on 23 May 1972 with a Nice-Montpellier-Perpignan service. In 1975 it was headquartered at A\u00e9rodrome du Castellet.World Airline Directory. Flight International. March 20, 1975. \"467. Over the years KLM, Euralair, Lufthansa and the SAir Group (Swissair), who sold their stake in 2001, all had ownership stakes in Air Littoral. A takeover failed in 2003 and the company was declared bankrupt. A number of groups considered taking over Air Littoral including Azzurra Air (which shortly after ceased operations due to its own financial difficulties), but none succeeded and the airline was closed down by the French authorities in February 2004. ==Fleet and history== In different periods of its history the company was operating the following aircraft:Klee, Ulrich & Bucher, Frank et al. jp airline-fleets international.

By the moment of bankruptcy Air Littoral had been operating a fleet of 17 CRJ-100s from bases in Nice, Montpellier, Paris (Orly) and Marseille, and was well known for the bright livery its aircraft sported in the years before its demise. In the 1990s, Air Littoral approached Metzler & Associ\u00e9s of Paris for a new identity which would propel it into a new market, and that is what was delivered. However, the design, a mix-and-match collection of identity elements, was so innovative that the airline's executives were afraid to implement it - until they called a company-wide meeting and showed Air Littoral employees models of the aircraft painted in the vivid new style. Marc-Antoine Herrmann, creative director & lead designer for the project told airline officers, \"We must show all the positive things associated with the south - its warmth, friendliness, joie de vivre. This is your difference, and you must use it so people will feel they take a part of the south with them when they go on-board.\" To help the design team develop a palette and graphic approach unique to the south, mood boards were created displaying photos of the region and examples of its rich graphic heritage. \\- Taken from Step-by-Step Graphics magazine, circa 1993 ==Accidents== * ==References== ==External links== * *Air Littoral - Airlines Remembered Category:Defunct airlines of France Category:Airlines established in 1972 Category:Airlines disestablished in 2004 Category:Former IATA members Category:French companies established in 1972 Category:French companies disestablished in 2004 ",
