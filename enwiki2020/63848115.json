Brower, was a United States Commissioner in the Alaska territory and her mother, Ahsiangatok, was an Eskimo from the Barrow area.

She was the first woman elder in her Presbyterian church. ==Judicial career== She became a magistrate in Alaska's Second Judicial District when the territory gained statehood in 1958. She ran the court in both the English and Eskimo languages, and had to fight to allow cases to be heard in the local language when defendants did not speak English. She followed Eben Hopson, who encouraged her to take the position. Before a courthouse was built, she heard cases in her kitchen. ==Eskimo advocate== As a half Inupiaq Eskimo, Neakok was an advocate in Alaska and in Washington DC for Eskimo causes. As a child, she saw the local Naval base enforcing discriminatory segregation against the native people, inspiring her to defend them. As an adult, she served on the tribal council. In 1961, in response to what she viewed as an unjust hunting law, she helped organize the town into so overwhelming the game warden that he could not enforce a law regulating hunting season. ==See also== *List of first women lawyers and judges in Alaska ==References== Category:Alaska state court judges Category:People from Alaska Category:University of Alaska Fairbanks alumni Category:Inupiat people Category:1916 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Presbyterian Church (USA) ",
