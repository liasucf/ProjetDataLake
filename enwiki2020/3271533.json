Owned by Corus Entertainment, the station broadcasts an all-news format. CHQT broadcasts with a power of 50,000 watts, using a non-directional antenna in the daytime. But because AM 880 is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A WCBS in New York City, CHQT must use a directional antenna at night to protect WCBS from interference.
