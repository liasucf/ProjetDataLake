    "text": "On December 8, 1995, eight people, including the assailant, were killed when a gunman seized hostages at Freddy's Fashion Mart in Harlem, New York City and set the building on fire. ==Background== In 1995 a black Pentecostal Church, the United House of Prayer, which owned a retail property on 125th Street, asked Fred Harari, a Jewish tenant who operated Freddie's Fashion Mart, to evict his longtime subtenant, a black-owned record store called The Record Shack. African-American activist Al Sharpton led a protest in Harlem against the planned eviction of The Record Shack. Sharpton told the protesters, \"We will not stand by and allow them to move this brother so that some white interloper can expand his business.\" ==Attack== On December 8, 1995, Roland J. Smith Jr., one of the protesters, entered Harari's store with a gun and flammable liquid, shot several customers and set the store on fire. The gunman fatally shot himself, and seven store employees died of smoke inhalation. Smith was found with a card identifying himself as Aboudima Moulika and he had also used the name Abugunde Mulocko. Fire Department officials discovered that the store's sprinkler had been shut down, in violation of the local fire code.Inquiry Traces Sprinkler System Failure in Fatal Harlem Fire. The New York Times. December 15, 1995. ==Aftermath== Sharpton subsequently stated that the perpetrator was an open critic of himself and his nonviolent tactics. In 2002, Sharpton expressed regret for making the racial remark \"white interloper\" but denied responsibility for inflaming or provoking the violence. ==References== Category:1995 in New York City Category:Crimes in Manhattan Category:Hostage taking in the United States Category:Arson in New York (state) Category:Attacks in the United States in 1995 Category:1995 murders in the United States Category:Mass murder in New York (state) Category:Mass murder in the United States Category:Murder\u2013suicides in New York Category:1995 mass shootings in the United States Category:Mass murder in 1995 Category:Massacres in the United States Category:Antisemitic attacks and incidents in the United States Category:Hate crimes Category:Racism in the United States Category:Racially motivated violence in the United States Category:Harlem Category:Mass shootings in the United States ",
