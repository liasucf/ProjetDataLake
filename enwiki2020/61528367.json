    "text": "Ben Lugmore () at is the 29th-highest peak in Ireland on the Arderin scale, and the 37th-highest peak on the Vandeleur-Lynam scale. It is in a horseshoe- shaped massif that includes the slightly higher peak of Mweelrea at , the highest mountain in the Irish province of Connacht. The massif is between Killary Harbour and Doo Lough, in Mayo. The peak is noted for its long summit ridge that forms a deep cliff-lined headwall around the corrie of Lug More (); the corrie includes a feature known as The Ramp that climbers use to access the summit ridge, as well as rock climbs and winter ice climbs. While the peak can be accessed via a 3-hour walk from the corrie below, it is also summited by way of the 6-7 hour Mweelrea Horseshoe, described as a \"top three\" mountain walk in Ireland. ==Naming== Irish academic Paul Tempan lists Ben Lugmore as an anglicisation of the that translates as \"peak of the big hollow\", and which describes the deep corrie on Lugmore's northeast face called Lug More (split into two words). Patrick Weston Joyce chronicled that the term Lugmore, which he translated as \"Great Hollow\", appears in several other Irish placenames; and there are several entries in the Placenames Database of Ireland. ==Geology== Ben Lugmore's geology is what is known as the Mweelrea Formation, and is very different from that of the Twelve Bens, on the other side of Killary Harbour. At a summary level, the Mweelrea Formation consists of Ordovician period sandstones originally deposited on large alluvial fans, and distally\u2010equivalent alluvial plains and delta fans. Interbedded with these sandstones are tufts, being ash deposits from Ordovician period volcanos. ==Geography== The peak of Ben Lugmore lies on the northern arm of the horseshoe that forms the massif of the Mweelrea Mountains, which is bounded by Killary Harbour, Ireland's deepest fjord, to the south, and Doo Lough to the north; Mweelrea, the provincial top for Connacht, lies near the apex of this horseshoe. Ben Lugmore is described as having a small sharp \"airy\" summit which lies on a high narrow southeast to northwest ridge that links with Ben Bury, and then on to Mweelrea. This ridge includes two high subsidiary summits either side of Ben Lugmore, both of which are of equal height: Ben Lugmore West Top at , whose prominence of qualifies it as a Vandeleur-Lynam and a Hewitt, and Ben Lugmore East Top at , whose prominence of also qualifies it as a Vandeleur-Lynam and a Hewitt. From a distance, Ben Lugmore's profile is that of a long and high sharp ridge, along which its various summits (main and subsidiary) are dotted. Northeast of Ben Lugmore's ridge are the cliffs of the deep corrie of Lug More (also called ), which itself looks into the small valley of Glencullin at the junction of Doo Lough and Glencullin Lough. To the southwest of the ridge is the valley of Glenconnelly; and where the high southwestern cliffs of Ben Lugmore West Top, Benbury and Mweelrea circle the northern corrie lake at the head of the Glenconnelly valley, known as Lough Bellawaum. Ben Lugmore's own prominence of qualifies it as a Marilyn, and it also ranks it as the 18th-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence threshold is 100 metres. The peak is listed as the 29th-highest peak in Ireland on the Arderin scale, and the 37th-highest peak on the Vandeleur-Lynam scale.Mountainviews, (September 2013), \"A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams & the Arderins\", Collins Books, Cork, ==Recreation== ===Hill walking=== The most direct route to the summit of Ben Lugmore is the 3-hour round trip via the Lug More (or ) corrie and the valley of Glen Glencullin. A notable feature known as The Ramp is used, which crosses the headwall of this corrie at mid-way, from east to west in an upward slope; reaching the ridge of Ben Lugmore at a col with Ben Bury. While this route is direct, caution is advised in properly finding The Ramp, as the corrie has extensive cliffs. This route can also be extended into a 6-hour round-trip that takes in the additional summits of Ben Bury and Mweelrea as well. Ben Lugmore is also climbed as part of the 6-7 hour Mweelrea Horseshoe (being the 2nd-highest peak on the route), which is described in Ireland's Best Walks (2014), as being one of the \"top three\" mountain walks in Ireland. The circuit starts and ends at the Delphi Mountain Resort, and takes in all the peaks of the massif of Mweelrea, including Ben Lugmore (and its subsidiary peaks), Ben Bury, Mweelrea and the Mweelrea SE Spur (marked as point 495-metres in the OS map). ===Rock climbing=== Ben Lugmore's high northeastern cliffs that form the upper headwall of the Lug More (or ) corrie (situated above The Ramp), are a noted rock-climbing venue in with multi-pitch mountain rock-climbs with grades varying from Diff (D) to Moderate Severe (MS), and length ranging from . Some of the first ascents date from the mid 1950s, and they often follow chimneys and gullies between Ben Lugmore's various subsidiary peaks. More serious modern rock climbing routes are located at the edge of the southern entrance to the corrie (marked as Askaneeraun on the OS Maps), at the Doo Lough Crags (marked Teevaree Rocks on the OS Maps). The routes vary from 30 to 70 metres on sandstone and conglomerate rock, with rock climbing grades in the range of VS (Very Severe) to E2 (Extreme, level 2), and well regarded climbs of Bragela's Watch (, E1), Red Dawn (, E2 5c), and Letter to Breshnev (, E3/4 6a); most of the best routes were developed in the late 1980s to early 1990s. ===Winter climbing=== The Lug More (or ) corrie also has a number of winter climbs, the most notable of which is Recession Gully (Grade II/III, ). ==Gallery== File:Mweelrea (back left), and Ben Lugmore (centre), from summit of Ben Gorm.jpg|Mweelrea (back left), and Ben Lugmore (centre), viewed from the east on the summit of Ben Gorm File:Ben Lugmore from east spur of Ben Lugmore East Top2.jpg|Northeast face of Ben Lugmore, and Lug More corrie, with The Ramp (green, in sunlight) crossing it, viewed from east spur of Ben Lugmore File:Ben Lugmore and Doo Lough from the south ridge of Barrclashcame.jpg|Full ridge of Ben Lugmore and Lug More corrie, viewed from across Doo Lough, on Barrclashcame File:Ben Lugmore West Top & Ben Bury (behind, right) from summit of Ben Lugmore.jpg|Ben Lugmore West Top, and Ben Bury (back right), viewed from Ben Lugmore File:Ridge of Ben Lugmore from the south (Glenconnelly Valley).jpg|Ben Lugmore southwest face, viewed from the Glenconnelly valley ==See also== *List of Hewitt mountains in England, Wales and Ireland *Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles *Lists of mountains in Ireland *Maumturks, a major range in Connemara ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * ==External links== *MountainViews: The Irish Mountain Website, Ben Lugmore *MountainViews: Irish Online Mountain Database *The Database of British and Irish Hills , the largest database of British Isles mountains (\"DoBIH\") *Hill Bagging UK & Ireland, the searchable interface for the DoBIH Category:Marilyns of Ireland Category:Hewitts of Ireland Category:Mountains and hills of County Galway Category:Geography of County Galway Category:Mountains under 1000 metres ",
