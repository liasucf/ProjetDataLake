    "text": "Mojsije I Rajovi\u0107 () was the Archbishop of Pe\u0107 and Serbian Patriarch, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, from 1712 to 1725, with seat in the Patriarchal Monastery of Pe\u0107. Before he became the Serbian Patriarch, Mojsije served as Metropolitan of Ra\u0161ka, from 1704, under Patriarch Kalinik I. That was traditionally a very prominent position, so when the next Patriarch Atanasije I died in 1712, Mojsije was elected as his successor. His seat was in the Patriarchal Monastery of Pe\u0107. During the Austro-Turkish War (1716-1718), Belgrade was liberated from Ottoman rule together with northern parts of Serbia and Temes Banat. In those regions new ecclesiastical province for Orthodox Serbs in Habsburg Monarchy was formed, known as the Metropolitanate of Belgrade. It was headed by metropolitan Mojsije Petrovi\u0107, who received blessings and confirmation from Patriarch Mojsije. New autonomous Metropolitanate of Belgrade had jurisdiction over Kingdom of Serbia and Temes Banat. By 1725, patriarch Mojsije decided, under the burden of old age and poor health, to transfer his authority to the Metropolitan of Ra\u0161ka, named Arsenije, who became new Serbian Patriarch. After abdication from the patriarchal throne, he spent the rest of his days in the Patriarchal Monastery of Pe\u0107 and died there on April 13, 1726. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * ==External links== * Official site of the Serbian Orthodox Church: Serbian Archbishops and Patriarchs Mojsije I Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Serbia Category:18th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:18th-century Serbian people Category:Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Category:1726 deaths ",
