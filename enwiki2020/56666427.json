After Downside he attended Brasenose College, Oxford. He added the \u201cMartyn\u201d part to his surname after the death of his grandmother in 1958; she was the daughter of Andrew Martyn, of Spiddal, Co Galway. Through the Martyns Hemphill inherited Tulira Castle, near Gort. This was originally a tower house but had considerable additions commissioned by Edward Martyn, founder of the Abbey Theatre. The castle and land were host to John Huston during his stay in Galway between 1960-71 where they spent a considerable amount of time hunting with the Galway Blazers. Due to financial constraints Hemphill was forced to sell Tulira in 1982. In 1952 he married Ann Rutlidge; they had three children, including Charles who inherited the title Baron Hemphill. Hemphill died in the Galway Clinic on 6 April 2012. ==Career== Hemphill\u2019s first became involved in horse racing when he became Master of the Galway Blazers on inheriting the title. He held the position from 1967 to 1960 and from 1972 to 1986. Hemphill was elected to the Irish National Hunt Society in 1965 and was Senior Steward between 1975 and 1980. He was elected to the Irish Turf Club in 1972 and served as Senior Steward from 1985 to 1988. In that position he was instrumental in modernising the Irish racing industry and amongst other things he found major corporate sponsors that put the industry on a more professional footing. The Lord Hemphill Memorial Handicap Steeplechase is named in his honour. ===House of Lords=== He took his seat in the House of Lords for the first time on December 11, 1957 and while he did occasionally sit there is no record of him making any contribution to debates. He remained a member of the House of Lords until the House of Lords Act 1999. ==References== ==External sources== Category:1928 births Category:2012 deaths Category:People educated at Glenstal Abbey School Category:People educated at Downside School Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom ",
