    "text": "Claude Berrou (; born September 23, 1951 in Penmarch) is a French professor in electrical engineering at \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne, now IMT Atlantique. He is the sole inventor of a groundbreaking quasi-optimal error-correcting coding scheme called Turbo codes as evidenced by the sole inventorship credit given on the fundamental patent for turbo codes. The original patent filing for turbo codes issued in the US as US Patent 5,446,747. A 1993 paper entitled \"Near Shannon Limit Error-correcting Coding and Decoding: Turbo-codes\" published in the Proceedings of IEEE International Communications Conference was the first public disclosure of turbo codes. This 1993 paper listed three authors because it was formed from three separate submissions that were combined due to space constraints. The three authors listed on the 1993 paper are: Berrou, Glavieux, and Thitimajshima. Because the 1993 paper was the first public introduction of turbo codes (patents remain unpublished until issued), coinventorship credit for the discovery to turbo code is often erroneously given to Glavieux and/or Thitimajshima. While Berrou and Glavieux did go on to do supplemental work together, the original development of turbo codes was performed by Berrou alone. Berrou also codeveloped turbo equalization (see turbo equalizer.) Turbo equalization is also known as iterative reception or iterative detection. Turbo Codes have been used in all the major cellular communications standards since 3G and are currently part of the LTE (Long Term Evolution) cellular protocol. They are also used in the Inmarsat satellite communications protocol and well as the DVB-RCS and DVB-RCS2 communications protocols. Hard disk drives started using turbo equalization for their read channel in 2008. By 2012 all hard disk drives used turbo equalization and this remains the case to this day. Between mobile phones and hard disk drives, several billion devices have incorporated key technology developed by Claude Berrou. == Key research activities == His current research activities are now concentrated on the application and extension of the Turbo technology in various domains, including his research on Artificial thinking, because the Turbo-decoding has been recognized as a new instance of the very general principle of Belief propagation; one application of this principle has been invented for the decoding of Low-density parity-check codes (LDPC codes also known as Gallager codes, in honor of Robert G. Gallager, who developed the LDPC concept in his doctoral dissertation at MIT in 1960 as a theoretical model whose practical implementation was not widely developed until recently). The Turbo principle is generalized now by Claude Berrou and his lab team for the processing of various functions such as the demodulation, the detection or the equalization using a network of multiple convolution codes working in parallel with probabilistic feedback. Other subjects of interest include all their possible applications in the field of artificial intelligence, for example with a better understanding of natural biological thinking and memory for the implementation of such model using neural networks for the processing of pulsed signals with software and hardware methods with auto-selected and self- maintained combinations of activation cycles of adjacent neurons.La pens\u00e9e artificielle (The Artificial Thinking), research project paper by Claude Berrou, ENST Bretagne (2008). == Publications == He is the author or coauthor of several books related to turbocodes and their encoding/decoding methods or implementation devices: * Codes et turbocodes (Codes and turbocodes) by Claude Berrou with Karine Amis Cavalec, Alain Glavieux, Matthieu Arzel, Michel Jezequel, Charlotte Langlais, Rapha\u00ebl Le Bidan, Samir Saoudi, G\u00e9rard Battail, Emmanuel Boutillon, Yannick Saouter, Emeric Maury, Christophe Laot, Sylvie Kerouedan, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilloud, and Catherine Douillard.

He wrote many chapters in various books related to turbocodes in US publications, published several articles in various international research magazines with scientific review committees, and made many communications in international conferences with review committees. During his work on turbocodes and parallel convolutive encoding and decoding, he has authored several registered patents for methods and devices implementing this technology: * Proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de codage convolutif correcteurs d\u2019erreurs pseudo-syst\u00e9matique, proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de d\u00e9codage et dispositifs correspondants (Apparatus of pseudo-systematic error-correcting convolutive coding, associated decoding process and devices) by Claude Berrou and Patrick Adde (Institut TELECOM; Telecom Bretagne; France Telecom & TDF), France, April 1991. * Proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de d\u00e9codage d\u2019un code convolutif \u00e0 maximum de vraisemblance et pond\u00e9ration des d\u00e9cisions et d\u00e9codeur correspondant (Apparatus of decoding for a convolutive code with maximum likelihood and weighted decisions, and associated decoder) by Claude Berrou (Institut TELECOM; Telecom Bretagne), France, April 1992. * Proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de codage correcteurs d\u2019erreurs \u00e0 au moins deux codages convolutifs syst\u00e9matiques en parall\u00e8le, proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de d\u00e9codage it\u00e9ratif, module de d\u00e9codage et d\u00e9codeur correspondants (Apparatus of error-detecting encoding using at least two systematic convolutive encodings in parallel, process of iterative decoding, and associated decoding module and decoder) by Claude Berrou (Institut TELECOM; Telecom Bretagne; France Telecom & TDF), France, April 1992. * D\u00e9codage it\u00e9ratif de codes produits (Iterative decoding of product codes) by Ramesh Pyndiah, Alain Glavieux and Claude Berrou (Institut TELECOM; Telecom Bretagne; France Telecom), France, November 1993. * Dispositif de r\u00e9ception de signaux num\u00e9riques \u00e0 structure it\u00e9rative, module et proc\u00e9d\u00e9 correspondants (Numeric signals device with iterative structure, associated module and process), by Catherine Douillard, Alain Glavieux, Michel Jezequel and Claude Berrou (Institut TELECOM; Telecom Bretagne; France Telecom & TDF), France, February 1995. * Proc\u00e9d\u00e9 et dispositif de codage convolutif de blocs de donn\u00e9es et proc\u00e9d\u00e9 et dispositif de d\u00e9codage correspondants (Apparatus and devices for the convolutive encoding of data blocks, and associated process and decoding device) by Claude Berrou and Michel Jezequel (Institut TELECOM; Telecom Bretagne; France Telecom et TDF), France, April 1996. * Proc\u00e9d\u00e9 et dispositif de codage \u00e0 au moins deux codages en parall\u00e8le et permutation am\u00e9lior\u00e9e, et proc\u00e9d\u00e9 et dispositif de d\u00e9codage correspondants (Apparatus and device for the encoding with at least two parallel encoders and enhanced permutation, and associated process and decoding device) by Claude Berrou and Alain Glavieux (Institut TELECOM; Telecom Bretagne; GET), France, July 1999. * Proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de qualification de codes correcteurs d\u2019erreurs, proc\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u2019optimisation, codeur, d\u00e9codeur et application correspondants (Apparatus for the qualification of error-correcting codes, and associated optimization process, encoder, decoder and application) by Claude Berrou, Michel Jezequel and Catherine Douillard (Institut TELECOM; Telecom Bretagne; France Telecom & GET), France September 2001. == Distinctions == He has received several distinctions:See Claude Berrou's personal biography page on the ENST Bretagne web site (external link below). * the SEE Amp\u00e8re Medal (1997). * the Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation of IEEE Information Theory Society (1998), together with Alain Glavieux and Punya Thitimajshima. * the IEEE Richard W.
