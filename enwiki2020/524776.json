    "text": "The alveolar and dental ejective stops are types of consonantal sound, usually described as voiceless, that are pronounced with a glottalic egressive airstream. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, ejectives are indicated with a \"modifier letter apostrophe\" \u27e8\u02bc\u27e9, as in this article. A reversed apostrophe is sometimes used to represent light aspiration, as in Armenian linguistics \u27e8p\u2018 t\u2018 k\u2018\u27e9; this usage is obsolete in the IPA. In other transcription traditions, the apostrophe represents palatalization: \u27e8p\u02bc\u27e9 = IPA \u27e8p\u02b2\u27e9. In some Americanist traditions, an apostrophe indicates weak ejection and an exclamation mark strong ejection: \u27e8k\u0313 , k!\u27e9. In the IPA, the distinction might be written \u27e8k\u02bc, k\u02bc\u02bc\u27e9, but it seems that no language distinguishes degrees of ejection. In alphabets using the Latin script, an IPA-like apostrophe for ejective consonants is common. However, there are other conventions. In Hausa, the hooked letter \u0199 is used for /k\u02bc/. In Zulu and Xhosa, whose ejection is variable between speakers, plain consonant letters are used: p t k ts tsh kr for /p\u02bc t\u02bc k\u02bc ts\u02bc t\u0283\u02bc kx\u02bc/. In some conventions for Haida and Hadza, double letters are used: tt kk qq ttl tts for /t\u02bc k\u02bc q\u02bc t\u026c\u02bc ts\u02bc/ (Haida) and zz jj dl gg for /ts\u02bc t\u0283\u02bc c\uf267\u02bc kx\u02bc/ (Hadza). ==Features== Features of the alveolar ejective: * There are four specific variants of : ** Dental, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper teeth, termed respectively apical and laminal. ** Denti- alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, and the tip of the tongue behind upper teeth. ** Alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively apical and laminal. ** Postalveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge, termed respectively apical and laminal. ==Occurrence== ===Dental or denti-alveolar=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=2 | Language !!
