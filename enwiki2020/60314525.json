    "text": "Rosa Arciniega (born perhaps 1903, 1908, or 1909 in Lima; died 1999 in Argentina) was a Peruvian novelist with a Socialist bent. She was a pioneer of women's rights, and belonged to the generation of left-leaning intellectuals led by Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui. As a young person, she traveled to Spain (where she published many of her works), affiliated herself with the Socialist party, and began her work as a journalist. She got married in 1924, and in 1936 she returned to Peru, at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. She is principally known for her biographies and several novels. Her third novel, the 1933 dystopian Mosko-Strom. El torbellino de las grandes metr\u00f3polis depicts a noisy mechanical world that worships progress and is indifferent to the welfare of human beings. == External sources == * Mosko-strom: el torbellino de las grandes metropolis : novela, 1934 edition (second edition) on Google Books. * WorldCat listing of the 1934 edition (second edition) of Mosko-Strom. * La novela dist\u00f3pica de 1933 que anunciaba las urgencias del mundo de 2018, El Pa\u00eds, 22 March 2019; discusses the resurging interest in Mosko-Strom. * Libreria Sur showing that Mosko-Strom has been reissued in 2019. * Terrores Vanguardistas: el miedo a la modernidad y la \u00abllamada al orden\u00bb by Esperanza L\u00f3pez Parada, in A trav\u00e9s de la vanguardia hispanoamericana, ed.
