He is what many would call the epitome of what a Brother With No Game is. Bubbly, animated and a self-confessed geek, he is seen as the proverbial good gentleman of the group, and as a result can't seem to find a woman that he is compatible with. Theo has a confusing relationship with school friend Simone, with fans vocally unsure whether there is more to them than just friends. Humble, likeable yet with a hint of naivety he provides a necessary balance to the four main friends. Zephryn Taitte portrays Dorian Kerr an accountant who works with Theo at the same multimedia company. Intelligent and well-read he assumes the role of life analyst and often uses his interest in psychology and conspiracy theories to theorise on just about everything. His love for Arsenal rivals his hate for work, especially his boss Michael who he shares awkward competitive scenes with. Dorian dates a number of women despite being picky, yet his heart lies with childhood friend Lisa, who he subsequently fails to make his girlfriend for most of the series. David Avery plays Marcus Graham, a men's fashion magazine intern turned content editor. Charismatic, Confident and Cocky with self-proclaimed good looks, he is the charmer of the friends. He likes his women to complement his attempted lifestyle and often goes for the fashionable, high maintenance and trophy types. His necessity to lie about who he is to get women almost always backfires on him in the long run with his conquests in the series ranging from crazy to young. Isaac Sosanya plays Junior Casey Owusu, a freelance IT Consultant. He is funny, social but collected, making him both the quietest and joker of the group. Junior's confidence is dealt a blow at the start of the series, as we find him still reeling off the break-up of his childhood sweetheart Vanessa. He subsequently dates Remy and builds a relationship with her until Vanessa comes back into his life. Junior spends the series contending with his choices and the effects they have on his life and those around him life. Natalie Duvall plays Lisa Bowman, a teacher and part-times events organiser. She is often referred to as the mother hen, as she loves to bring all her friends together to cook for them. She is a hopeless romantic, always trying to hook up the guys and longs for a relationship of her own. During the series Lisa drops clues for Dorian that she wants to be with him, but it has yet to materialise. She subsequently goes on to date Leon in the series. Dani Moseley plays Simone Charles, a heralded youth worker in her community. Alongside Lisa she is a childhood friends of the guys. Feisty and not one to mince her words she is often seen as aggressive and snobbish of men, however as the series progresses we see she is merely guarding herself from being hurt again after breaking up with another old school friend, Darren. Ashley Bannerman plays Remy Ademola, a relationship blogger and author. Remy is introduced to the series as a feisty speed-date, heavily critical and analytical on the guys she comes across. She wins a date with Junior and a relationship blossoms. She is focused, witty and personable and brings a whole new dimension to Junior. Nemide May plays Vanessa Leanne, writer and actress. She joins the series at the Season 1 finale, coming back into Junior's life after an untimely break-up. She is meticulous, intelligent and very sweet but has a menacing side when she doesn't get what she wants. She spends the series trying to win Junior back, after realising he may not be as over as her as he claims. Solomon Israel plays Darren Dickson, an old school friend of the guys. He is confident, a jokester and spontaneous, often wanting to go out on wild nights and trips. He is introduced to the series as Simone's ex-boyfriend and we soon learn about his uncommitted dynamic with women. He represents the guy Marcus wants to be. The source of Darren's regular income is unknown and despite his womanising ways, he takes great pride in having fun and making people happy. == Season Synopsis == === Season 1 === The first season introduces the four main characters and three supporting characters.

A strange turn of events reveal that he's not the only one lying in their rendezvous. Dorian is struggling with work, women and his feelings towards Lisa.

Devin Faraci commented that the show was 'actually good (I'd say it's the only good thing recommended in the segment).'

It\u2019s not just about black culture, but it's also about being a young British guy\u2026\" As the series progressed, Brothers With No Game received National press coverage in The Guardian, with the writer asking the question of why the show was not on UK television, despite its success online.
