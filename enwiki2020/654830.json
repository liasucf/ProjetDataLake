    "text": "Oswald Jos\u00e9 Peraza [pay-RAH-za] (born October 19, 1962) is a Venezuelan former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Baltimore Orioles (1988). He batted and threw right-handed. As of the 2014 season, he is the pitching coach for the Dominican Summer League Blue Jays. Peraza was a hard thrower with a fastball in the 94\u201395 range. He also had a good slider and a fine change-up. On August 31, 1987, Peraza was traded by the Toronto Blue Jays to the Baltimore Orioles for pitcher Mike Flanagan. Peraza debuted with Baltimore in 1988, then missed the following season with arm problems, which were serious enough to affect the rest of his career. In his rookie season, Peraza posted a 10\u201314 record with 61 strikeouts and a 5.55 of ERA in 86 innings pitched. Peraza, who was once one of the more highly touted prospects in the game, couldn't make it out of Triple-A ball and he retired for good after three injury riddled years (1990\u201392). == See also== * List of players from Venezuela in Major League Baseball ==External links== , or Retrosheet, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League) Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:Florence Blue Jays players Category:Frederick Keys players Category:Gulf Coast Blue Jays players Category:Hagerstown Suns players Category:Kinston Blue Jays players Category:Knoxville Blue Jays players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from Venezuela Category:Minor league baseball coaches Category:People from Puerto Cabello Category:Rochester Red Wings players Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Venezuelan baseball coaches Category:Venezuelan expatriate baseball players in the United States ",
