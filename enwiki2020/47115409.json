    "text": "The Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) presidential primaries, 2015 took place in July 2015 to determine CCM's nominee for the Presidency of Tanzania for the 2015 election. The Chama Cha Mapinduzi (Party of the Revolution) is the country's dominant ruling party, and the longest reigning ruling party in Africa. Incumbent president and 2010 nominee Jakaya Kikwete is ineligible for re- election due to term limits. He is looking forward to his retirement, and has described the presidency as being both \"stressful and thankless\". Kikwete, who also serves as the party's National Chairman, said that he was not backing anyone as his preferred and chosen successor. More than forty candidates (including 12 Cabinet Members) collected the nomination forms. On 12 July, Minister of Works John Magufuli was selected as the party's presidential nominee, and is most likely to win the presidential election. ==Background== economic growth of 7%. ===Dodoma Six=== In February 2014, the CCM's Central Committee summoned and interrogated six prospective candidates at the party's headquarters in Dodoma; and banned them from engaging in premature campaigns for a period of twelve months. They were former Prime Ministers Frederick Sumaye and Edward Lowassa, Foreign Minister Bernard Membe, Minister Stephen Wasira, Deputy Minister January Makamba and former Minister William Ngeleja. The ban was further extended in March 2015, before being lifted on 22 May 2015. ==Candidates== The following candidates have been listed according to the dates that they expressed interest or formally announced their candidacy. ; Key: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"background- color:#228B22;color: white\"|Candidate ! style=\"background-color:#228B22;color: white\" class=\"unsortable\" | Background ! style=\"background- color:#228B22;color: white\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- |data-sort- value=\"Makamba\"|124px | *Born 1974 , Hometown: Lushoto, Tanga Region *Alma mater: St. John's University (Minnesota), George Mason University *Member of Parliament for Bumbuli (2010\u2013present) *Deputy Minister of Communication, Science and Technology (2012\u2013present) | *Son of Yusuf Makamba, a CCM stalwart and its former SG. *Denied having any intention for the presidency in March 2012. *Expressed interest on 2 July 2014. *Declared candidacy on 7 June 2015 (video) *Links: Website, Twitter, Facebook, (Q&A; Book) |- |data-sort- value=\"Sitta\"|124px | *Born 1942 , Urambo, Tabora Region *Alma mater: University of Dar es Salaam , IMEDE *Member of Parliament for Urambo East (2005\u2013present) *Minister of Transport (2015\u2013present) | *Claims that he refused accepting a bribe of $70,000 from a Canadian aircraft manufacturer. *Expressed interest on 2 September 2014 *Declared on 3 June 2015 (video) |- |data-sort-value=\"Kigwangalla\"|124px | *Born 1975 , Tabora Region *Alma mater: Muhimbili University , Karolinska Institutet , BTH *Member of Parliament for Nzega (2010\u2013present) | *Declared candidacy on 7 September 2014 (speech, video) *Campaign slogan: The New Tanzania We Want *Links: Website, Twitter |- |data-sort-value=\"Wasira\"|124px | *Born 1945 , Bunda, Mara Region *Alma mater: American University *Member of Parliament for Bunda (2005\u2013present) *Minister of Agriculture (2015\u2013present) | *Expressed interest in September 2014 *Declared candidacy on 31 May 2015 (video) *Links: Website, Twitter |- |data-sort-value=\"Pinda\"|124px | *Born 1948 , Rukwa Region *Alma mater: University of Dar es Salaam *Member of Parliament for Katavi (2000\u2013present) *Prime Minister (2008\u2013present) * ($120m) | *Expressed interest on 21 October 2014 *Declared candidacy on 12 June 2015 *Links: Profile |- |data-sort-value=\"Nyalandu\"|124px | *Born 1970 , Singida Region *Alma mater: Waldorf College , Wartburg College , Buckingham *Member of Parliament for Singida North (2000\u2013present) *Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism (2014\u2013present) | *Declared candidacy on 28 December 2014 *Links: Website, Twitter, Facebook |- |data-sort- value=\"Membe\"|124px | *Born 1953 , Lindi Region *Alma mater: University of Dar es Salaam , Johns Hopkins University *Member of Parliament for Mtama (2000\u2013present) *Minister of Foreign Affairs (2007\u2013present) | *Expressed interest on 24 May 2015 *Declared candidacy on 7 June 2015 (video) *Denied reports that President Kikwete was his half-brother. *Endorsed by Seif Ali Iddi, Cleopa Msuya *Links: Twitter |- |- |data-sort-value=\"Lowassa\"|124px | *Born 1953 , Arusha Region *Alma mater: University of Dar es Salaam , University of Bath *Member of Parliament for Monduli (1995\u2013present) *Former Prime Minister (2005\u20132008) * (TSh 172b) | *Declared candidacy on 30 May 2015 (speech, video) *Campaign slogan: Safari ya Matumaini (Journey of Hope) *Endorsed by Kingunge Ngombale\u2013Mwiru *Links: Facebook |- |data-sort- value=\"Nchemba\"|124px | *Born 1975 , Singida Region *Alma mater: University of Dar es Salaam *Member of Parliament for Iramba West (2010\u2013present) *Deputy Minister of Finance (2014\u2013present) | *Declared candidacy on 31 May 2015 (video) *Links: Twitter |- |data-sort-value=\"Karume\"| | *Born ?
