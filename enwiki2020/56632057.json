    "text": "The Museo Experimental El Eco is a contemporary art gallery in the centre of Mexico City, Mexico. It was designed by sculptor Mathias Goeritz, a Mexican artist of German origin\"MUSEO EXPERIMENTAL EL ECO: THE SCULPTURE OF MATHIAS GOERITZ\", MXCITY.MX, Retrieved on 19 February 2018. who worked closely with the Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n.\"El Eco Museum Extension, Mexico City, Mexico\", Architizer, Retrieved on 19 February 2018. Originally built in 1952\u201353, the gallery was extended by FR-EE/Fernando Romero Enterprise in 2007 \"to expand its offices and special services to improve daily operations\". == History of the building == In 1952, businessman Daniel Mont commissioned artist Mathias Goeritz to build a place that would articulate a new relationship between his commercial interests of a restaurant-bar and the avant-garde spirit of some cultural actors of the time, with the intention of finding something different from what was established. Under the premise \"do whatever you want\", Goeritz conceived the space on Sullivan Street in Mexico City. It was designed as a poetic structure whose layout of corridors, ceilings, walls, rooms and openings led its visitors to reflect their experience of space in an emotional act; This concept challenged the dominant interests of functionalism in architecture at that time. Based on his \"Manifesto of emotional architecture\", his writings also refer to inspiration of religious experiences and Gothic and Baroque architecture. Goeritz conceived the building as a penetrable sculpture. This space was the creation of an unprecedented platform for the arts in the context of Mexican and international art of the 1950s. In 2004, the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico bought the building which re-opened its doors on 7 September 2005 after many months of restoration work to bring the building back to its original state. The project was intended to revive Goeritz's architectural legacy.Peri\u00f3dico El Universal == Pabell\u00f3n Eco == Pavilion for architecture competition at the Museo Experimental el Eco in Mexico City.
