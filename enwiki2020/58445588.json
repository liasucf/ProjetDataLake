It houses the world's largest collection of Johnny Cash memorabilia and artifacts, including a stone wall taken from his lake house in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and is officially authorized by Cash's estate. == History == Born in 1932 in Kingsland, Arkansas, Johnny Cash is one of the bestselling recording artists of all time. Throughout his lifetime, he wrote and recorded music in a lot of different styles, including country, rockabilly, gospel, blues, and rock and roll, and he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. His trademark nickname \u2013 Man in Black \u2013 came from the signature all-black wardrobe he wore for performances. The original museum honoring the star \u2013 known as House of Cash \u2013 was in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and although Cash lived in the same town for over thirty years, he did not at any time live in the museum.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6543503.stm The House of Cash had been closed for many years and had fallen into a state of disrepair, and appeared in Cash's music video \"Hurt\". Cash's lakeside home in Hendersonville, that he lived in from 1968 until his death, burned in an accidental fire during renovations in 2007.https://eu.tennessean.com/story/money/real- estate/2016/11/17/johnny-cashs-former-lakefront-hendersonville-estate-up- sale/94022938/ Shannon and Bill Miller \u2013 personal friends of Cash \u2013 donated their personal collection of memorabilia to found the current Johnny Cash Museum in Nashville.
