As City Librarian (from May 1901 to 1914), he initiated and developed public libraries throughout the city. He was also a founding member, and the first President (from 1908 to 1910), of the Scottish Library Association. FRANCIS THORNTON BARRETT (21858617076) ==Early life== Francis Thornton Barrett, born on 20 September 1838 at Liverpool, Lancashire, England, was the eldest of five children.England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-1915. His father, the Rev. John Barrett (1812-1884), was a congregational minister, who entered into public religious work in the Liverpool Town Mission, later undertaking the charge of home mission stations and pastorates in a number of places including Little Lever, near Bolton (in 1848), Sedgley and Coleshill. His father's family was resident for several generations in Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. His mother was Mary Ann Thornton (1808-1885), daughter of William Thornton, of London. ==Writings== As a founding member, a Fellow, and the first President (from 1908 to 1910), of the Scottish Library Association, Barrett contributed papers on various points of professional practice to its annual conference and to the professional journals. ==Personal life== In July 1863, in Aston, Warwickshire, Barrett married Elizabeth Jane Trengrouse (1842-1881).England & Wales Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1837-1915. The Barratts\u2019 son, Franklin Trengrouse Barrett, was born on 15 April 1866 in Birmingham. Franklin followed his father into the library profession, becoming Librarian for Fulham Public Libraries from 1903 until his sudden death on 9 October 1905. From 1872 to 1876, the family lived at 37 Lee Crescent, Edgbaston, Birmingham.Kelly's Directory of Birmingham, 1872-1876. In April 1881, father and son were living at 60 Victoria Road, Glasgow.1881 Scotland Census - Parish: Glasgow Govan; ED: 46; Page: 18; Line: 21; Roll: cssct1881_250. By April 1891, they were residing at \"Holly Bank\", Crow Road in Partick.1891 Scotland Census - Parish: Govan; ED: 23; Page: 28; Line: 17; Roll: CSSCT1891_306. ==Public life== In 1852, Barrett was apprenticed to a bookseller and printer at Bolton, in Lancashire, and was connected with those trades in Lancashire and later in Birmingham until 1866. In August 1866, he joined Birmingham Public Libraries where he served as Sub- Librarian of the Reference Department. In 1873, he is listed as Assistant Librarian of the Free Library, Ratcliff PlaceKelly's Directory of Birmingham, 1873. (Birmingham Central Free Library). The Mitchell Library, Glasgow In November 1876, Barrett became a candidate for the post of Librarian of the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, then about to be commenced. His appointment was approved by Glasgow Town Council in February 1877, and he entered on the duties of the post on 15 March of that year. On 1 November 1877, in temporary premises at 60 Ingram Street, the Mitchell Library was opened to the public by Lord Provost Sir James Bain. Following the decision of the Corporation to establish district libraries in different parts of the city, Barrett was nominated City Librarian in May 1901. Having been moved to larger accommodation at 21 Miller Street, Glasgow, the Mitchell Library was reopened by the Marquess of Bute on 7 October 1891. In 1899, the passing of the Glasgow Corporation (Tramways, Libraries, etc.) Act enabled the establishment of a system of lending libraries for which Barrett was made responsible. The title Mitchell Librarian was later changed to that of the City Librarian, responsible for all the libraries in Glasgow. The City Librarian still kept overall responsibility for the Mitchell Library, but the day-to-day organisation was then in the care of a Chief Assistant. The accommodation provided at 21 Miller Street proved still inadequate for the requirements of the library, and the Corporation began to erect a new building in North Street in January 1907. In September of that year, the building\u2019s foundation stone was laid by Andrew Carnegie on the occasion of the annual Conference of the Library Association, of which Barrett was President, which that year was held in Glasgow. The new Library was officially opened by the 5th Earl of Rosebery, on 16 October 1911, and opened to the public three days later. Barrett received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Glasgow University in 1913. ==Later life== Following his resignation, in February 1914, the Corporation agreed to Barrett's suggestion that he continue to work for them in an advisory capacity. He came daily to the Mitchell Library until shortly before his death, at home, on 21 January 1919.Scotland, National Probate Index (Calendar of Confirmations and Inventories), 1876-1936. ==Posthumous reputation== Barrett has been credited with the suggestion of establishing the \u201cScottish Poetry Collection\u201d, one of the Mitchell Library\u2019s fundamental collections, to match the \u201cShakespeare Memorial Library\u201d which had been formed in Birmingham\u2019s Central Reference Library. ==References== ==Further reading== Barrett, Francis T., \u201cA Great Catalogue, being an Appreciation of the Catalogue of the Library of the Peabody Institute, Baltimore\u201d.
