    "text": "Jubilation is the tenth and final studio album by Canadian/American rock group the Band. Recorded in the spring of 1998 in Levon Helm's home studio in Woodstock, New York, it was released on September 15, 1998. For the first time since the group reformed without guitarist and songwriter Robbie Robertson, there were more originals than covers. Songs include \"Last Train to Memphis\", featuring guest guitarist Eric Clapton, Garth Hudson's solo instrumental closer \"French Girls\", Rick Danko's \"High Cotton\" and the ode to Ronnie Hawkins, \"White Cadillac\". On only one track, \"If I Should Fail\", do all six group members appear. Helm and Danko are missing from one track each, guitarist Jim Weider is missing from two. Richard Bell is replaced by producer/engineer Aaron Hurwitz on piano and keyboards for much of the album (Bell appears on just three tracks). Hudson and drummer-percussionist Randy Ciarlante are on every track. Friends and family abounded to help out. A colored vinyl of the album was released in September 1998 in a limited run. The album cover is by Illinois folk artist George Colin. This is the only album released by The Band to include no contributions from Richard Manuel. ==Track listing== Limited edition vinyl pressing ==Personnel== ;The Band *Rick Danko \u2013 acoustic and electric bass guitars, double bass, acoustic guitar, vocals *Levon Helm \u2013 drums, percussion, harmonica, mandolin, vocals *Garth Hudson \u2013 keyboards, organ, accordion, piano, synthesizers, vocoder, soprano, alto and tenor saxophones, percussion *Randy Ciarlante \u2013 drums, percussion, vocals *Jim Weider \u2013 guitars, mandolin, dobro, vocals *Richard Bell \u2013 keyboards, organ, piano, vocals ;Additional personnel *Aaron Professor Louie Hurwitz \u2013 producer, engineer, piano, organ, accordion, backing vocals *Tom Malone \u2013 trombone, trumpet, tenor and baritone saxophone *Eric Clapton \u2013 guitars *John Hiatt \u2013 high-string guitar, vocals *Tom Pacheco - guitar, vocals *Bobby Charles \u2013 percussion, backing vocals *Marie Spinosa \u2013 percussion, backing vocals *Marty Grebb \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals *Jim Eppard \u2013 tenor guitar, mandolin *Mike Dunn \u2013 bass guitar *Kevin Doherty \u2013 backing vocals *Amy Helm \u2013 backing vocals *Maud Hudson \u2013 backing vocals ==References== Category:1998 albums Category:The Band albums ",
