The band was formed at an Art Brut gig in New York City in 2006, after a support band dropped out, and Keith, who had produced Art Brut's first two singles, played some of his songs with members of Art Brut. The band has subsequently featured a rotating line-up of musicians, with two rules, of avoiding soundchecks and never having rehearsals. The band has released three albums. The first, Fuck You! I'm Keith Top of the Pops (released in 2011), was given 5 stars by and made Album of the Month by Artrocker. The second album TOTP 2 (released in 2013) was reviewed well by PopMatters, which described it as \"hard to fault\". It was also given 5 stars by Artrocker.
