In 1906 he moved to Paris for art studies. There he became acquainted with Mirra Alfassa and met her nearly every evening for studying the teachings of occultism. When Paul and Mirra RichardMirra Alfassa had married Paul Richard in 1910. had travelled to Pondicherry in 1914 to meet Sri Aurobindo, they invited Hohlenberg to join them and help publishing a journal. But due to the war and other circumstances he could come only in 1915, staying for a month. During this brief stay he took one of the few photos of Sri Aurobindo and prepared some sketches on whose basis he created an oil painting later on.Bracker (2018), p. 227-229 Through his participation in talks of Sri Aurobindo with his disciples, Hohlenberg had acquired some basic knowledge which he used in 1916 for publishing his book titled Yoga i dens betydning for Europa (Yoga and its significance for Europe). In 1954 the title was also published in a German translation in whose Preface Hohlenberg referred to his stay with Sri Aurobindo and the talks with him as a source. At a later stage he started taking an interest in Anthroposophy and became a disciple of Rudolf Steiner, playing an important role as the general secretary of a newly founded anthroposophical society in Denmark and helping to spread Steiner's thought there.Bracker (2018), p. 229 == Publications == Among Hohlenberg's works are Goethes Faust i det 20. Aarhundrede from 1928, a biography of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard from 1940, and further treatments of Kierkegaard's works.
