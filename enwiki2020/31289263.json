    "text": "Auscultation can be performed upon the skull to check for intracranial bruits. Such a bruit may be found in such conditions as cerebral angioma, tumour of the glomus jugulare, intracranial aneurysm, meningioma, occlusion of the internal carotid artery, or increased intracranial pressure. == Clinical observations == The following extract details a method of performing cranial auscultation: > A bruit should be listened for, in quiet surroundings, over the skull and > eyeballs, the latter situation being the most favourable for hearing the > softest ones. The patient should be asked to close both eyes gently and the > stethoscope firmly applied over one eye. During auscultation the other eye > should be opened as in this way there is considerable diminution of eyelid > flutter, which may cause confusion if rhythmical. Auscultation is then > carried out over the other eye in a similar manner. If a murmur is not > readily heard the patient should be asked to hold his breath. Finally > auscultation should be carried out over the temporal foss\u00e6 and mastoid > processes.Mackenzie, Ian. \"The intracranial bruit\" in Brain (1955) 78(3): > 350-368 ==Notes== Category:Neurology procedures Category:Neurosurgery ",
