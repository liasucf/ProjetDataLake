    "text": "Wayne Hockley (born 6 September 1978) is an English former professional footballer. ==Career== Hockley was born in Paignton, Devon and joined Torquay United as a trainee, having previously played for local side Stoke Gabriel. He made his debut on 15 March 1997, as a substitute for Mark Hawthorne in Torquay's 3\u20131 defeat away to Scarborough, missing an open goal within a minute of taking to the pitch. He played once more that season, this time as a substitute for Andy McFarlane in Torquay's 2\u20131 defeat away to Doncaster Rovers and began the following season on a monthly contract. He left Torquay in September 1997 after manager Kevin Hodges only offered him a further month rather than a longer-term contract and rejoined his former club Stoke Gabriel. He was the top scorer for Dartington Sports Club in the 1998\u201399 season. In March 2000 he was playing for Galmpton United, but by July 2001 was back with Dartington S.C., playing in a friendly against Torquay United in a game in which he was marked by his younger brother Matt, who was also a professional with Torquay United, making over 200 appearances for the club between 2000 and 2008. ==References== ==External links== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:People from Paignton Category:English footballers Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football forwards ",
