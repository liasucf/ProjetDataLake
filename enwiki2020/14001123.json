    "text": "John William Bowman (23 April 1879 \u2013 26 January 1943) was an English football player and manager. He played one cup game for Burslem Port Vale in 1899, having previously appeared for a number of nearby amateur sides. He then spent two seasons with Stoke, playing four games in the Football League, before he joined Queens Park Rangers in 1901. In four years with QPR he played more than 100 matches, before he was selected to serve Norwich City as manager. He stepped down in 1907, returning to the game in 1912 for a four-year stint as Croydon Common manager. He then returned to QPR as a director, though briefly took the managerial reins in 1931. ==Playing career== Bowman moved to Staffordshire at a young age and started with Shelton Juniors before moving on to Hanley St. Jude's and Burslem Park, before joining Burslem Port Vale of the Second Division in February 1899. He played at left-half in a 1\u20131 draw with Walsall in a Birmingham Senior Cup semi-final match on 13 March 1899, but was not selected again. After being released at the end of the season he moved on to their local rivals Stoke. He played two First Division for the \"Potters\" in both 1899\u20131900 and 1900\u201301, before he signed for Queens Park Rangers in June 1901, playing as centre half. At this time he weighed and was tall. He went on to play 103 league games for the Southern League club, scoring two goals. In addition to playing football, Bowman was also a renowned athlete (a strong runner and swimmer) and was a teetotaller and non-smoker. ==Management career== Bowman was Norwich City's first-ever manager, and was in charge for 78 matches between 1905 and 1907, winning 31, losing 24 and drawing 23 games. He also played several matches for the club. Bowman is also the first person recorded as referring to the club as \"the Canaries\". The reference comes in an interview recorded in the Eastern Daily Press with the newly appointed manager in April 1905. The paper quotes him saying \"Well I knew of the City's existence... I have... heard of the canaries.\" Norwich City historian Eastwood notes: After leaving City he took up the position as manager of Croydon Common before returning to old club QPR as a director and later as team manager. Appointed in May 1930, he had to retire due to ill health in November 1931. Bowman remained in the North West London area and ran a sports shop at 7 Park Parade, Harlesden with branches in Wembley and Marylebone. ==Statistics== ===Playing statistics=== Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Burslem Port Vale |1898\u201399 |Second Division |0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Stoke |1899\u20131900 |First Division |2||0||0||0||2||0 |- |1900\u201301 |First Division |2||0||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !4!!0!!0!!0!!4!!0 |} ===Managerial statistics=== Source: {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=5|Record |- !!!!!!!!! |- |align=left|Queens Park Rangers |align=left|31 May 1930 |align=left|1 November 1931 |} ==References== ==External links== * Profile at Croydon Common Category:Footballers from Middlesbrough Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Stoke City F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:English football managers Category:English Football League players Category:Norwich City F.C. managers Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. managers Category:English Football League managers Category:1879 births Category:1943 deaths ",
