This year the show was centered around an international theme, \u201cthe world of adult,\u201d with added emphasis on European presenters and awards. This was the first year the awards ceremony was split over two nights, with a pre- awards event held January 10, 1997, where awards for technical achievements were distributed, while the main awards were presented January 11, 1997. Several other people were also involved with the production of the ceremony. Serenity was responsible for choreography and Mark Stone was musical director with original songs by Mark J. Miller. The top selling and renting tape of the year was Shock, although it was tied in the best-selling category with World\u2019s Biggest Gang Bang 2. There were several new awards categories this year including Best Advertisement and the AVN Breakthrough Award to acknowledge \"those who were carving new niches and forging new territories in the adult business.\" The ceremonies were published on VHS tape by VCA Pictures. ===Critical response=== The show received a negative reception from Hustler magazine, which said, \u201cLong-winded speeches from several award winners threatened to bore everyone to death.\u201d It went on to add that since AVN is a trade publication paid for by ads \"from the same adult video companies it bestows awards upon, the critical value of such honors is subject to debate.\" Swank Video World magazine was a bit more positive, calling the show \"the most glamourous night in the adult industry.\" ==See also== * AVN Award for Best Actress * AVN Award for Best Supporting Actress * AVN Award for Male Performer of the Year * AVN Award for Male Foreign Performer of the Year * AVN Award for Female Foreign Performer of the Year * AVN Female Performer of the Year Award * List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * * * * ==External links== * * Adult Video News Awards at the Internet Movie Database * * * * \"1997 AVN Award Winners\" and categories at the Internet Archive Wayback Machine Category:AVN Awards Category:1997 film awards ",
