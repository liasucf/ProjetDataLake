    "text": "Moussa Marega (born 14 April 1991) is a French-born Malian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Primeira Liga club Porto and the Mali national team. He began his career in France, playing no higher than the Championnat National. After one year with Esp\u00e9rance in Tunisia, he moved to Mar\u00edtimo of the Primeira Liga in 2015. Shortly afterwards, he signed for Porto. After spending 2016\u201317 on loan at Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es, he became a regular in the Porto side and won two league titles. Marega made his international debut for Mali in 2015, and was part of their squad at the Africa Cup of Nations in 2017 and 2019. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Les Ulis, Essonne, to Congolese parents, Marega began his career at \u00c9vry FC, before moving to Vend\u00e9e Poir\u00e9-sur-Vie Football of the Championnat National in 2012, and fellow league team Amiens SC a year later. He spent the second half of 2014 in Esp\u00e9rance Sportive de Tunis, but could not make a single appearance due to bureaucratic problems. He subsequently moved to C.S. Mar\u00edtimo in Portugal's Primeira Liga in January 2015. In November 2015, he was sent off in a 1\u20130 loss at Amarante F.C. with two yellow cards and then gestured at the bench; he was suspended from training with the club as a result. ===Porto=== Both Marega and Mar\u00edtimo goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 were on the cusp of a move to Sporting Clube de Portugal in January 2016, but FC Porto signed the pair on contracts lasting to 2020; Marega's buyout clause was set at \u20ac40 million. He made 13 appearances in his first campaign at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o \u2013 mostly as a substitute \u2013 and scored once in a 2\u20130 home win over Gil Vicente F.C. in the Ta\u00e7a da Liga on 2 March. His early poor performances drew vocal criticism from some Porto fans, and he took training from a friend on how to become mentally resilient. On 20 July 2016, Marega was loaned to Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es for the upcoming season. He made his debut a month later in a 2\u20130 win against his former team, Mar\u00edtimo, scoring the second goal, and on 30 October, he scored all three goals in a 3\u20130 win against Rio Ave F.C. to reach 10 goals from 8 games. On 4 November, he received a straight red card in the first half-hour of a 2\u20131 home win over C.D. Nacional for striking Nuno Sequeira, receiving a three-match ban. Lokomotiv Moscow in October 2018 On his return to Porto, Marega scored twice in the opening game of the 2017\u201318 season, a 4\u20130 home win over Estoril, as a first-half substitute for Tiquinho. He was part of a three-pronged attack made of African players, alongside the Cameroonian Vincent Aboubakar and Yacine Brahimi of Algeria. He scored 14 league goals in 14 starts, and reportedly began to attract the interest of Premier League sides Manchester United and Chelsea in January 2018. Porto won the league for the first time in five years and Marega was their top scorer (third overall behind Jonas and Bas Dost) with 22 goals. In November 2018, Marega was awarded the Drag\u00e3o de Ouro (Golden Dragon) as Porto's best player of the calendar year. Having not previously scored in a European match, Marega scored a goal in six consecutive appearances in the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League, ending with one in a 3\u20131 win over A.S. Roma, that put Porto in the quarter-finals for the first time in four years. On 16 February 2020, after scoring the winning goal on his return to Vit\u00f3ria, Marega gave the middle finger to the home fans who had been racially abusing him. The insults continued after this incident and in response, he walked out of the game, and was subsequently substituted. His reaction to the abuse was praised by the Portuguese press, with A Bola newspaper giving Marega a perfect 10 rating in its player ratings. He scored in a 2\u20130 home win over Sporting on 15 July that year, as his team won the title with two games left to play. ==International career== Marega made his debut for the Mali national team on 25 March 2015, in a friendly against Gabon in Beauvais, France; he started in the 4\u20133 defeat. On 4 September 2016, he scored his first international goal in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification game against Benin, helping towards a 5\u20132 win at the Stade du 26 Mars. In January 2017, he was called up for Mali's squad at the final tournament in Gabon. In the Eagles' opening game against Egypt in Port- Gentil, he was named man of the match in a goalless draw. He also started the other two games of the group stage elimination. Marega was also called up for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. He scored in their opening game, a 4\u20131 win over Mauritania, as they made the last 16. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division||Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |\u00c9vry |2011\u201312 |Division d'Honneur |||||||||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014|||| |- |Le Poir\u00e9-sur-Vie B |2012\u201313 |CFA 2 |2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0 |- |Le Poir\u00e9-sur-Vie |2012\u201313 |Championnat National |31||5||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||32||5 |- |Amiens |2013\u201314 |Championnat National |33||9||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||36||9 |- |Esp\u00e9rance de Tunis |2014\u201315 |Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Mar\u00edtimo |2014\u201315 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primeira Liga |14||7||2||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||8 |- |2015\u201316 |15||5||2||1||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||18||7 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !29!!12!!4!!2!!1!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!34!!15 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Porto |2015\u201316 |rowspan=\"4\"|Primeira Liga |9||0||2||1||0||0||2||0||13||1 |- |2017\u201318 |29||22||2||0||3||1||6||0||40||23 |- |2018\u201319 |29||11||5||2||4||2||9||6||47||21 |- |2019\u201320 |29||12||4||1||3||1||9||1||45||15 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !96!!45!!13!!4!!10!!4!!26!!7!!145!!60 |- |Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es (loan) |2016\u201317 |Primeira Liga |25||13||4||1||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||14 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !211!!83!!25!!7!!13!!5!!26!!6!!275!!103 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=\"3\"|Mali |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2015||5||0 |- |2016||4||1 |- |2017||6||0 |- |2018||4||1 |- |2019||6||1 |- !Total||25||3 |} ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Mali's goal tally first. {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !Goal!!Date!!Venue!!Opponent!!Score!!Result!!Competition |- | 1. || 4 September 2016 || Stade du 26 Mars, Bamako, Mali || || align=center | 3\u20130 || align=center | 5\u20132 || 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification |- | 2. || 9 September 2018|| Juba Stadium, Juba, South Sudan|| || align=center | 1\u20130 || align=center | 3\u20130 || 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification |- | 3. || 24 June 2019|| Suez Stadium, Suez, Egypt|| || align=center | 2\u20130 || align=center | 4\u20131 || 2019 Africa Cup of Nations |} == Honours == Porto * Primeira Liga: 2017\u201318, 2019\u201320 * Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 2019\u201320 Individual *Drag\u00e3o de Ouro: 2018 ==References== ==External links== Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:French people of Malian descent Category:People from Les Ulis Category:Sportspeople from Essonne Category:Malian footballers Category:French footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:\u00c9vry FC players Category:Amiens SC players Category:Vend\u00e9e Poir\u00e9-sur-Vie Football players Category:Esp\u00e9rance Sportive de Tunis players Category:C.S.
