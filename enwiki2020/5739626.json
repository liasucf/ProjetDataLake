    "text": "is a Japanese actor, director, fight choreographer, and stuntman. He is best known for his role in Ryuhei Kitamura's cult film, Versus. Since his debut, Sakaguchi has worked with Kitamura several times, often appearing alongside fellow Kitamura staple Hideo Sakaki. He has also worked with frequent Kitamura collaborators Yudai Yamaguchi and Yuji Shimomura. Sakaguchi is a talented martial artist, and most often appears in films featuring copious fight scenes, usually performing all of his own stunts. He is purportedly skilled in Bajiquan, Shorinji Kempo, Boxing, Kickboxing, and while recently filming Re:Born learned the tactical martial art Zero Range Combat developed by Yoshitaka Inagawa. == Biography == Before entering into the film industry, Sakaguchi was an underground street fighter who was well known for his skill in the martial arts. He was discovered by then-unknown director Ryuhei Kitamura, who recruited Sakaguchi for a lead role in Versus. Since then, Sakaguchi has appeared in several films directed by Kitamura, including the Azumi films, Kitamura's short in the Jam Films titled The Messenger, and minor roles in Aragami and Alive. He played a larger role in the quirky, yet successful Battlefield Baseball (produced by Kitamura and directed by Yudai Yamaguchi). 2006 saw Sakaguchi in more mainstream roles, such as Yashamaru in Shinobi: Heart Under Blade, and \"Grave\" in Death Trance. He also guest-starred in the Japanese tokusatsu show, Kamen Rider Kabuto, as the villain Reiji Nogi/Cassisworm. In 2008, Sakaguchi made his directorial debut with Sakigake!! Otokojuku (a.k.a. \"Samurai School\"), in which he also starred, wrote the screenplay, and choreographed the action sequences. He made a cameo appearance in Yoshihiro Nishimura's 2008 exploitation film, Tokyo Gore Police, as well as directed/starred in Yoroi: Samurai Zombie, based on a story by Ryuhei Kitamura. In 2011, Sakaguchi reprised his role as Yaky\u00fb Jubei in Deadball, a reimagining of Battlefield Baseball, and also co-directed/starred in Yakuza Weapon, based on the manga Gokud\u014d Heiki. In 2013, Sakaguchi announced his retirement from acting to focus on work behind the camera. Despite this, he is expected to reprise his role as KSC2-303 in Ryuhei Kitamura's Versus 2, and has stated that he is currently working on a sequel to Death Trance. == Filmography == === Actor === *Versus (2000) \u2013 Prisoner KSC2-303 *Alive (2002) \u2013 Zeros *Battlefield Baseball (2003) \u2013 Yaky\u00fb Jubei *The Messenger (2003, Jam Films segment) \u2013 Man *Aragami (2003) \u2013 Future Challenger *Azumi (2003) \u2013 Sanzo Sajiki *Godzilla: Final Wars (2004 \u2013 X-Seijin) *Azumi 2: Death or Love (2005) \u2013 Tsuchigumo *Shinobi: Heart Under Blade (2005) \u2013 Yashamaru *Cromartie High - The Movie (2005) \u2013 Ichiro Yamamoto *Death Trance (2006) Grave *Yo-Yo Girl Cop (2006) \u2013 Enola Gay gang member *The Red Army (2007, directed by K\u014dji Wakamatsu) \u2013 Takaya Shiomi *Sakigake!!
