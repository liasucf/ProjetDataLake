    "text": "\"Playing Games\" is a song by American singer Summer Walker from her debut studio album, Over It (2019). The song was released as the lead single from the album on August 23, 2019. The extended version features guest vocals from American singer Bryson Tiller. The song samples Destiny's Child's song \"Say My Name\" (1999). ==Critical reception== Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork said that, in the song, Walker \"addresses the lame dudes that continue to take her passion for granted\" while not acknowledging \"their relationship on Instagram\". The Fader named it one of the best songs on Over It, reasoning their choice by stating that the chorus is a \"full interpolation of one of Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s most ubiquitous preachings\" despite Walker not \"phoning it in\" and compared it to an old Nelly song. ==Music video== The music video was released on October 8, 2019, and was directed by Christine Yuan. Despite being featured on the extended version of the song, Bryson Tiller does not appear in the clip. The video features shots of Walker sitting and lying on a bed surrounded by bright city lights in the backdrop. During the video, Walker has one man tied up and hanging from the ceiling while another one is seen being confined to a chair. Being fed-up with lies, Walker goes on to ignore a man bringing her flowers and apologizing. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== ====Original version==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 83 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada (Canadian Hot 100) | 43 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 76 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 20 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100https://twitter.com/billboardcharts/status/1183838124453126144 | 16 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 9 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rhythmic (Billboard) | 37 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 36 |} ====Extended version==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (Recorded Music NZ) | 15 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 10 |} ===Year-end charts=== ====Original version==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 75 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Bryson Tiller songs Category:Songs written by London on da Track Category:Songs written by LeToya Luckett Category:Songs written by Kelly Rowland Category:Songs written by Beyonc\u00e9 Category:Songs written by Fred Jerkins III Category:Songs written by Rodney Jerkins Category:Songs written by LaShawn Daniels Category:Songs written by Bryson Tiller ",
