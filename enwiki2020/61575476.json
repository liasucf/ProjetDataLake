On January 4, MTV Nederland announced the album as one of the 8 most popular upcoming albums of 2016. ==Studio recording== The album was recorded in 2015 in the old house of Jett Rebel in Soesterberg on a four-track Tascam Portastudio cassette recorder. This was the first time Rebel recorded an album with analog technology. In this period of recording, experimenting, and the pleasure he experienced, he decided never to record digitally again. The title of the album came about in New York. Rebel was in November 2015 for a ten-day tour in New York, during an annual Live in Your living Room festival. The album was initially to be called Trucker's Towel. But once they arrived in New York and with the obvious sources of inspiration and signals Rebel received, the decision was made to go for the title Truck. ==Track listing== All songs written and instruments played by Jett Rebel # \"It's Cruel\" - 2:37 # \"Now I Know\" - 2:59 # \"Trucker's Towel\" - 1:10 # \"Can't Start Crying Now\" - 4:13 # \"Get Well Soon Allyson\" - 1:58 # \"Got a Clarinet!\" - 0:48 # \"Do You Feel Alright?\" - 2:13 # \"How to Take Care of You\" - 1:32 # \"Sundown\" - 3:19 # \"Casio Interlude 2\" - 1:20 # \"The Love You Give:\" - 3:48 # \"It's Cruel Reprise\" - 1:21 # \"Les is More\" - 0:02 # \"Tape 1 Side B (Extracts)\" - 0:50 # \"Dream Girl\" - 3:30 # \"Nothing's Going to Change My Mind\" -2: 13 # \"In My Mind\" - 1:42 # \"This Song Is Not Suitable for Radio\" - 2:33 # \"I Want to Be a Songwriter\" - 0:48 # \"Automatic Orange Juice Machine\" - 1:48 # \"Sometimes You Don't Feel Happy\" - 2:47 # \"Do You Feel Alright ?, (Pt.
