This species is important for subsistence fisheries and as a game fish. This is also the most common of the electric catfish to appear in the pet trade. The electric catfish has been found in the natural waters of Hong Kong as an introduced species. ==In the aquarium== Malapterurus electricus is sometimes encountered in aquarium supply stores. It can reach a maximum length of over 1 meter in the wild, but has an average size of 12 inches in the aquarium. It is quite hardy and greedily accepts most foods, although some experimentation may be required to find the best food. The only other animals that are compatible with this species are snails, which they will ignore. A minimum aquarium size of 55 gallons is required, with bogwood or pieces of PVC pipe. They are active burrowers and will often remove the gravel from under their favorite hiding spot. A minimum temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit is necessary. It is illegal to possess any species of electric catfish for personal or commercial use in Florida. ==Zoos in North America== *Bronx Zoo *Toronto Zoo ==References== Category:Malapteruridae Category:Fish of Africa Category:Fish described in 1789 Category:Strongly electric fish ",
