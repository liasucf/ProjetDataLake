    "text": "The Pacific Building, also known as the Pacific Desk Building, is a historic building in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Built in 1914, it is notable as a well- preserved example of early 20th-century commercial architecture in Downtown Albuquerque and includes one of the only remaining cast iron storefronts in the central business district. with The building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ==History== The Pacific Building was built in 1914 by Andreas Romero, who also owned a butcher shop on the same block. The first tenant was a furniture store, followed by a car dealership from 1918 to 1922 and then a furniture store again. In 1914 the building was bought by the Pacific Desk Company, an office furniture retailer, which was still in business when the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ==Architecture== The Pacific Building is a two-story, rectangular building with a partial basement. The facade is yellow brick with a cast iron storefront, one of the few remaining in the city. The second floor has eight evenly spaced 1/1 sash windows under a pair of cast iron hoods and a stepped parapet. On the ground floor, there are large display windows on either side of a recessed entry. The interior of the building has an open first floor with cast iron columns and an ornate pressed metal ceiling. The second floor had removable partitions installed in the 1940s and was reported to be unused in the 1980s. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1914 Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albuquerque, New Mexico ",
