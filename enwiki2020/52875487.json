    "text": "10K resolution is any of a number of horizontal display resolutions of around ten-thousand pixels, usually double that of 5K resolutions: 9,600 or 10,240 pixels. Unlike 4K, 8K and 16K, it is not part of UHDTV broadcast standards. The first devices available featured ultra-wide \"21:9\" screens with the vertical resolution of 8K, which has a native 16:9 aspect ratio. ==History== On June 5, 2015, Chinese manufacturer BOE showed a 10K display with an aspect ratio of 64:27 (\u224821:9) and a resolution of 102404320. In November 2016, the Consumer Technology Association published CTA-861-G, an update to their standard for digital video transmission formats. This revision added support for 102404320, a 10K resolution with an aspect ratio of 64:27 (\u224821:9), at up to 120Hz. On January 4, 2017, HDMI version 2.1 was officially announced, and was later released on November 28, 2017. HDMI 2.1 includes support for all the formats listed in the CTA-861-G standard, including 10K (102404320) at up to 120Hz. HDMI 2.1 specifies a new Ultra High Speed HDMI cable which supports a bandwidth of up to 48 Gbit/s. Display Stream Compression (DSC) 1.2a is used for video formats higher than 8K resolution with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. ==Cameras== , the only cameras capable of 10K are made by Phase One. == See also == * Ultrawide formats ==References== ==External links== * \u2013 official site Category:Film and video technology Category:Television technology Category:Digital imaging Category:Ultra-high-definition television ",
