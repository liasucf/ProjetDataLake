    "text": "Christopher Chubasco Wilkins (September 29, 1968 January 11, 2017) was a Texas inmate sentenced to death and executed for a 2005 double murder. On October 27, 2005, Wilkins shot and killed Willie Freeman and Mike Silva. Freeman had allegedly cheated Wilkins in a drug deal; Silva was with Freeman at the time and thus witnessed the killing. The numbers \"666\" and a pentagram matching one of Wilkins' numerous tattoos were found carved into Silva's car at the scene of the murders. Wilkins' fingerprints were also found. The previous day, Wilkins also allegedly killed Gilbert Vallejo outside a bar in south Fort Worth after a dispute over a payphone. On October 28, Wilkins was arrested and charged with the murders of Freeman and Silva; he later also confessed to murdering Vallejo. He was sentenced to death on March 12, 2008, after only 90 minutes of deliberation by the jury. When asked by his defense lawyer if he wanted to die, Wilkins said: \"I guess, subconsciously, I've been trying to get myself killed since I was 12 or 13 years old. I don't have nothing to live for. I haven't been any good to anybody for the last 20 years and I won't be for the next 20 or the 20 after that.\" Wilkins was initially scheduled to be executed on October 28, 2015 (which, coincidentally, was the 10th anniversary of his arrest). His execution was stayed and later rescheduled to January 11, 2017. Wilkins was executed by lethal injection on January 11, 2017, at 6:29 PM. He was 48 years old. == See also == * Capital punishment in Texas * Crime in Texas * List of offenders executed in the United States in 2017 * List of people executed in Texas, 2010\u201319 * Lists of people executed in Texas == References == == External links == * \"Offender Information Christopher Wilkins\", Texas Department of Criminal Justice Category:1968 births Category:2017 deaths Category:21st-century executions by Texas Category:21st- century executions of American people Category:People executed by Texas by lethal injection Category:2005 murders in the United States Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Texas Category:People executed for murder Category:American male criminals ",
