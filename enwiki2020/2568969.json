On 1 January 2014 the former municipalities of Vauffelin and Plagne merged into the new municipality of Sauge.Nomenklaturen \u2013 Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 13 December 2014 ==History== Ruins of a Roman watchtower at Rondch\u00e2tel Vauffelin and its parish is first mentioned in the Lausanne Chartular of 1228 as Vualfelim. It was formerly known by its German names F\u00fcglistal or F\u00fcglisthal though this name is no longer used. The village of Frinvillier was first mentioned in 1393 as Frunwelier. Frinvillier was located at the intersection of two important Roman roads, one leading from Petinesca (now Studen) over the Pierre Pertuis pass to Augusta Raurica (near Augst) and the road from Eburodunum (now Yverdon) over the Plateau de Diesse to Salodurum (Solothurn). A watch tower was built on at Rondch\u00e2tel to guard the road. In 1364, Count Thierstein granted the patronage rights of the village church to the Church of St. Benedict in Biel. During the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Era it was part of the seigniory of Erguel under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Vauffelin became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Vauffelin was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Vauffelin converted to the new Reformed faith in 1530, when Biel adopted the new faith. Originally the pastor of Orvin supported the church in Vauffelin. After 1798 the pastor in P\u00e9ry took over that responsibility. In 1839 the Vauffelin parish was created with Romont. The parish was originally administered by a deacon, but it received its own priest in 1860. The church was built in 1715-16 and renovated in 1932-34 and again in 1983. In 2010, Vauffelin, P\u00e9ry-La Heutte and Orvin joined the parish of Rondch\u00e2tel. During the 1970s the village population increased as commuters who worked in Biel moved into the village. In 1971, the villages of Vauffelin, Romont and Frinvillier formed a school district. ==Geography== Suze river canal in Frinvillier Before the merger, Vauffelin had a total area of .
