    "text": "Sydney Technical High School (STHS) is a government-funded single-sex academically selective secondary day school for boys, located in Bexley, a southern suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Founded in 1911 as part of Sydney Technical College, the school was one of the six original New South Wales selective schools and caters for boys from Year 7 to Year 12. The school is colloquially abbreviated to Sydney Tech, STHS or simply Tech. Admission to Year 7 is based on an external selective test held in Year 6 during March. Entrance to Years 8, 9 and 10 is based on the submission of an application form and an interview. Admission to Year 11 is based on the submission of an application form, placement tests in mathematics and English, and an interview. ==Academic achievement== The school consistently achieves superior results in external assessments, such as the NAPLAN, the ICAS, the School Certificate, and in particular, the Year 12 Higher School Certificate (HSC), where its students are regularly ranked in the top ten places in the state across a variety of subjects. On average, over 80% of its students achieve in the top 20% of the state, with a majority gaining an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank of more than 90. In 2010 fifteen students from the school's graduating class received Premier's Awards for All-round Excellence in the NSW HSC. 2.55 MB The school won the national championship in the University of Newcastle Science and Engineering Challenge in 2010 (gold division) and 2011 (silver division). == History == Sydney Technical High School building, 1925 One of the reforms advocated by the 1903 Royal Commission into NSW Education was the establishment of classes providing courses which would involve technical subjects. Consequently, Continuation classes for students interested in technical subjects commenced at the Sydney Technical College. In April 1911, these Continuation classes were given the status of a high school, and Sydney Technical High was established. Originally, the school was co- educational with 113 boys and 15 girls. In February 1913, the girls were transferred to Fort Street Girls' High; and, from then on, the school became for boys only. Since 1911, the school has been located at three Sydney sites: *Ultimo House on Mary Ann Street: this was the \"country\" home of John Harris, Surgeon of the New South Wales Corps. The property was bought by the Government in 1899 and used by Technical Education for many years before being used by Sydney Tech High from 1911 to 1924. *Paddington on Albion Street: in 1925, with an enrolment of 421, Sydney Tech High was transferred to Albion Street, Paddington. Although it was a note of expansion, it was a vigorous P&C; campaign that encouraged the State Government to fund an entirely new site for the school. *Bexley on Forest Road: the Old McConnachie's Paddock was occupied and first stone for the school's foundations was laid in March 1955, with the school completed and occupied by September 1956. The official opening for the school's new facilities was on 2 August 1958, with four units: the administration block, general classrooms ('A block'), manual training block and the auditorium and gymnasium. Throughout the years numerous additions have been made to the site. The School Pool was opened in 1966, the Kingston-David Library and Laboratories in 1975 and a brand-new administration block in 1998. == Facilities == The current grounds at Bexley include the following physical facilities: * Upper courts and Lower Courts (\"The Cage\") \u2013 basketball courts for Years 7\u20139 and 10\u201312, respectively * Elmo Landsberger Cricket nets \u2013 located between Lower courts and Back oval, 3 cricket batting nets & a plaque dedicated to Elmo Landsberger * New courts \u2013 A new basketball court as well as 3 small handball courts and a volleyball court has been put in, near the Anderson Street car park.
