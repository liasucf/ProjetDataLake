The eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland on 20 March 2010 affected the economic, political and cultural activities in Europe and across the world. There was an extensive air travel disruption caused by the closure of airspace over many countries affecting the travel arrangements of hundreds of thousands of people in Europe and elsewhere. Sporting, entertainment and many other events were cancelled, delayed or disrupted when individuals or teams were unable to travel to their destination. The state funeral of President of Poland Lech Kaczy\u0144ski and his wife Maria Kaczy\u0144ska on 18 April 2010 was affected as some national leaders were unable to attend, including Barack Obama, Stephen Harper, Angela Merkel, and Nicolas Sarkozy. == Economic Impacts == === Airline industry === Particulate matter in the ejected dust scatters light from the setting sun, generating 'volcanic lavenders' like this one over the flight path of Leeds- Bradford Airport in England during the aviation shutdown. Air travel and transport throughout the world was cancelled due to the airspace restrictions and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated the airline industry worldwide would lose \u00a3130 million ($200 million) a day as a result. IATA stated that the total loss for the airline industry was around US$1.7 billion (\u00a31.1 billion, \u20ac1.3 billion). The Airport Operators Association (AOA) estimated that airports lost \u00a380 million over the six-and-a-half days. Over 95,000 flights had been cancelled all across Europe during the six-day travel ban, with later figures suggesting 107,000 flights cancelled during an 8-day period, accounting for 48% of total air traffic and roughly 10 million passengers. Following the travel disruption, EU ministers agreed to accelerate the integration of national air traffic control systems into the Single European Sky and also to the immediate creation of a crisis coordination group to handle future transport disruptions. === European economies === Several sectors that depend on air-freighted imports and exports were badly affected by the flight disruptions. Imports of medications were affected, and local stocks, as they expire.Ash disrupts deliveries to British shops, UPI.com, 17 April 2010/ Business people and officials expressed concerns about imports of fresh food and other essential goods into the United Kingdom.\"Volcanic ash cloud causes economic concern\" BBC News, 18 April 2010 FedEx, DHL Express and other logistics companies were unable to transport goods by air.\"Volcano's eruption beginning to hurt Europe's economy\" The Star, 17 April 2010 Instead they had to transport packages to alternate destination (such as Istanbul or Madrid) and then ship by road to the final destination.

In South Korea, Samsung and LG were unable to air-freight more than 20% of their daily electronics exports and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries said hotels and restaurants in Hong Kong were facing shortages of European produce. === New Zealand economies === The New Zealand fisheries economy was helped by the disruption caused to air transport in Europe.
