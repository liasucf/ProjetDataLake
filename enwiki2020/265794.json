Mainly used to correct typewriting in the past, correction products now mostly cover handwriting mistakes. ==Product history== Liquid Paper In 1956, Bette Nesmith Graham invented the first correction fluid in her kitchen. Working as a typist, she used to make many mistakes and always strove for a way to correct them. Starting on a basis of tempera paint she mixed with a common kitchen blender, she called the fluid \"Mistake Out\" and started to provide her co-workers with small bottles on which the brand's name was displayed. By 1958, Graham founded the Mistake Out Company and continued working from her kitchen (and eventually garage) nights and weekends to produce small batches of correction bottles. She was fired from her typist job as executive secretary at Texas Bank and Trust after she accidentally put her own company\u2019s name on her employer\u2019s letter. She subsequently decided to devote all her time to Mistake Out. Graham offered her correction fluid to IBM, which declined the offer (the company announced its own Correcting Selectric with an integrated lift-off tape in 1973). By 1968, the product \u2013 now renamed Liquid Paper \u2013 was profitable, and in 1979 the company was sold to the Gillette Corporation for $47.5 million with royalties. ==Acquisition== In 2000, the Liquid Paper product and brand name was acquired by Newell Rubbermaid (now Newell Brands). In some regions of the world, Liquid Paper is now endorsed by Papermate, a widely known writing instruments brand (also owned by Newell). ==Ingredients== A traditionally shaped bottle of Liquid Paper Current MSDSs list Liquid Paper as containing titanium dioxide, solvent naphtha, mineral spirits, resins, dispersant, and fragrances. Liquid Paper came under scrutiny in the 1980s, due to concerns over recreational sniffing of the product. The organic solvent 1,1,1-trichloroethane was used as a thinner in the product. Liquid Paper containing this thinner was thought to be toxic and a carcinogen, but later studies have shown that although the thinner used was toxic there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. There were a number of studies linking fatalities to the trichloroethane contained in correction fluids, including Liquid Paper. In 1989, Gillette reformulated Liquid Paper such that it did not use trichloroethane. This was done in response to a complaint under California Proposition 65. ==See also== * Correction fluid * Correction tape * Pentel * Wite-Out * Tipp-Ex ==References== ==External links== * * Papermate US website * Official Web site * Liquid Paper on inventors.about.com Category:Correction instruments Category:Newell Brands Category:1979 mergers and acquisitions Category:2000 mergers and acquisitions ",
