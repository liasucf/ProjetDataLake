Until 1996, the NCAA would hold just one women's golf championship for all programs across Division I, Division II, and Division III. The tournament was held at the University of Georgia Golf Course in Athens, Georgia. TCU won the team championship, the Horned Frogs' first. Penny Hammel, from Miami (FL), won the individual title. ==Individual results== ===Individual champion=== * Penny Hammel, Miami (FL) (284, -12) ==Team results== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! dat-sort-type=number|Rank !!
