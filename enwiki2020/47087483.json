He is a Professor of Computer Science and Associate Dean for Research and Engagement in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.UMass Amherst CS faculty list He graduated with a B.A. in Computer Science summa cum laude from Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology in 1982, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of California at Berkeley in 1993, advised by Stuart J. Russell.Dr. Zilberstein's Ph.D. thesisHis doctoral advisor and thesis as part of his academic genealogy He is known for his contributions to artificial intelligence, anytime algorithms, multi-agent systems, and automated planning and scheduling algorithms, notably within the context of Markov decision processes (MDPs), Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs), and Decentralized POMDPs (Dec-POMDPs). ==Research== His research is in the area of artificial intelligence, specifically automated planning, in addition to decision theory, reasoning under uncertainty, heuristic search, automated coordination and communication, and reinforcement learning.Professional website description He directs the Resource-Bounded Reasoning LaboratoryResource-Bounded Reasoning Laboratory website at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.UMass Amherst research groups In 2002, Daniel S. Bernstein, Robert Givan, Neil Immerman, and Shlomo Zilberstein introduced the Decentralized POMDP which extends the widely used single-agent POMDP model to a multi-agent scenario (Dec-POMDP).Dr. Zilberstein's NSF Grant in 2002 in which the Dec-POMDP model was developed He has also developed AI algorithms for semi-autonomous systems with potential applications to semi-autonomous cars.Dr. Zilberstein's NSF Grant in 2014 for Semi-Autonomous Systems (SAS) with direct applications to semi-autonomous drivingPopular Mechanics news article on semi-autonomous systemsNSF news article on semi-autonomous systemsPhys.org news article on semi-autonomous systems ==Service and awards== He served as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research and associate editor of the Journal of Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems.JAIR editors and staff list from 2012 Additionally, he served as chair of the conference committee for both the Twenty-Ninth and Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.AAAI 2015 conference committeeAAAI 2016 conference committee The National Science Foundation awarded Dr. Zilberstein with the RIA, CAREER, and ITR awards.List of NSF CAREER award recipients In 2011, he was elected as a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.AAAI fellows list ==Selected publications== * * * ==References== ==External links== * Dr. Zilberstein's Academic Website * Resource-Bounded Reasoning Laboratory website * Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) overview, description, and publications within the field Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Artificial intelligence researchers Category:Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology alumni Category:University of Massachusetts Amherst faculty Category:Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence ",
