These two offices assumed many of DSS' functions. Other functions of the former DSS were transferred to the Department of Labor and the Department of Health. In addition, as part of the reorganization of State government, OCFS assumed all of the functions of the Division for Youth (DFY). It was also formerly the Department of Social Welfare. == See also == * New York City Human Resources Administration == References == * == External links == * New York State Department of Family Services * New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance * New York State Office of Children and Family Services * Department of Social Services in the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations Family Assistance Category:Welfare in New York (state) ",
