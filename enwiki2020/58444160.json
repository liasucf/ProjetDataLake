It is part of the Basswood River, and extends from Lower Basswood Falls to Curtain Falls. The U.S. portion of the lake is located in Saint Louis County, within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the Superior National Forest; the Canadian waters are part of Quetico Provincial Park. Pictographs of the First Nations are visible near Lower Basswood Falls.Ernst Behrens, \"Paddling the Boundary Waters Then and Now\", Torch Magazine, pp. 31-34. Spring 2015. More recent visitors to the area were French fur traders known as voyageurs, and the name of Crooked Lake reportedly was derived from the French word , meaning hooked. ==See also== *List of lakes in Minnesota *List of lakes in Ontario ==References== Category:Lakes of Rainy River District Category:Lakes of Minnesota Category:Bodies of water of St. Louis County, Minnesota ",
