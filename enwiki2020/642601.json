    "text": "The z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 () organs are functional entities stipulated by Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). They constitute the centre piece of TCM's general concept of how the human body works. The term z\u00e0ng () refers to the organs considered to be yin in nature \u2013 Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, Kidney \u2013 while f\u01d4 () refers to the yang organs \u2013 Small Intestine, Large Intestine, Gall Bladder, Urinary Bladder, Stomach and S\u0101njia\u014d. Each z\u00e0ng is paired with a f\u01d4, and each pair is assigned to one of the W\u01d4 X\u00edng. The z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 are also connected to the twelve standard meridians \u2013 each yang meridian is attached to a f\u01d4 organ and each yin meridian is attached to a z\u00e0ng. They are five systems of Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, Kidney. To highlight the fact that the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 are not equivalent to the anatomical organs, their names are often capitalized. ==Anatomical organs== To understand the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 it is important to realize that their concept did not primarily develop out of anatomical considerations. The need to describe and systematize the bodily functions was more significant to ancient Chinese physicians than opening up a dead body and seeing what morphological structures there actually were. Thus, the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 are functional entities first and foremost, and only loosely tied to (rudimentary) anatomical assumptions. ==Yin/yang and the Five Elements== Each z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 organ has a yin and a yang aspect, but overall, the z\u00e0ng organs are considered to be yin, and the f\u01d4 organs yang.by citation from the Huangdi Neijing's Suwen: \u2018\u2019\u2018\u2019[Within the human body's zang-fu, there's yin and yang; the zang are yin, the fu are yang]. As seen at: Since the concept of the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 was developed on the basis of W\u01d4 X\u00edng philosophy, they are incorporated into a system of allocation to one of five elemental qualities (i.e., the Five Elements or Five Phases). The z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 share their respective element's allocations (e.g., regarding colour, taste, season, emotion etc.) and interact with each other cyclically in the same way the Five Elements do: each z\u00e0ng organ has one corresponding z\u00e0ng organ that it enfeebles, and one that it reinforces. The correspondence between z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 and Five Elements are stipulated as: * Fire () = Heart () and Small Intestine () (and, secondarily, S\u0101njia\u014d [, \u2018\u2019Triple Burner\u2018\u2019] and Pericardium []) * Earth () = Spleen () and Stomach () * Metal () = Lung () and Large Intestine () * Water () = Kidney () and Bladder () * Wood () = Liver () and Gall Bladder () ==Details== The z\u00e0ng organs' essential functions consist in manufacturing and storing q\u00ec and blood (and, in the case of the Kidney, essence). The f\u01d4 organs' main purpose is to transmit and digest (\u4f20\u5316, ) substances (like waste, food, etc.). ===Zang=== Each z\u00e0ng has a corresponding \"orifice\" it \"opens\" into. This means the functional entity of a given z\u00e0ng includes the corresponding orifice's functions (e.g. blurry vision is primarily seen as a dysfunction of the Liver z\u00e0ng as the Liver \"opens\" into the eyes). In listing the functions of the z\u00e0ng organs, TCM regularly uses the term \"governing\" (, ) \u2013 indicating that the main responsibility of regulating something (e.g. blood, q\u00ec, water metabolism etc.) lies with a certain z\u00e0ng. Although the z\u00e0ng are functional entities in the first place, TCM gives vague locations for them \u2013 namely, the general area where the anatomical organ of the same name would be found. One could argue that this (or any) positioning of the z\u00e0ng is irrelevant for the TCM system; there is some relevance, however, in whether a certain z\u00e0ng would be attributed to the upper, middle or lower jia\u014d. ====Heart==== The Heart: *\"Stores\" (, ) 2006, chapter 1.2.2. the sh\u00e9n (, \"Aggregate Soul\", usually translated as mind), paired with small intestines *Governs xu\u011b (blood) and vessels/meridians *Opens into the tongue *Reflects in facial complexion =====Pericardium===== Since there are only five z\u00e0ng organs but six yin channels, the remaining meridian is assigned to the Pericardium. Its concept is closely related to the Heart, and its stipulated main function is to protect the Heart from attacks by Exterior Pathogenic Factors. Like the Heart, the Pericardium governs blood and stores the mind. The Pericardium's corresponding yang channel is assigned to the S\u0101njia\u014d (\"Triple Burner\"). ====Spleen==== The Spleen: *\"Stores\" (, ) the y\u00ec (\u610f, Intent) *Governs \"transportation and absorption\" (, ), i.e. the extraction of j\u012bng we\u012b (, lit. \"essence bits\", usually translated with food essence, sometimes also called j\u012bng q\u00ec [, essence qi]) 2006, chapter 3.2.1.1. \u2013 and water \u2013 from food and drink, and the successive distribution of it to the other z\u00e0ng organs. *Is the source of \"production and mutual transformation\" (, ) 2006, chapter 3, lead of q\u00ec and xu\u011b (blood) *\"Contains\" (, ) the blood inside the vessels *Opens into the lips (and mouth) *Governs muscles and limbs ====Liver==== The Liver: *\"Stores\" (, ) 2006, chapter 4.2.2. blood, and the hun (, Ethereal Soul) *Governs \"unclogging and deflation\" (, ) 2006, chapter 4.2.1. primarily of q\u00ec. The free flow of q\u00ec in turn will ensure the free flow of emotions, blood, and water. *Opens into the eyesFatrai/Uhrig (2015), p. 27 *Governs the tendons *Reflects in the nails ====Lung==== Metal. Home of the Po (, Corporeal Soul), paired with the large intestine. The function of the Lung is to descend and disperse qi throughout the body. It receives qi through the breath, and exhales the waste. The Lung governs the skin and hair and also governs the exterior (one part of immunity). A properly functioning Lung organ will ensure the skin and hair are of good quality and that the immune system is strong and able to fight disease. The normal direction of the Lung is downwards, when Lung qi \"rebels\" it goes upwards, causing coughing and wheezing. When the Lung is weak, there can be skin conditions such as eczema, thin or brittle hair, and a propensity to catching colds and flu. The Lung is weakened by dryness and the emotion of grief or sadness. ====Kidney==== Water. Home of the Zhi (, Will), paired with the bladder. The Kidneys store Essence, govern birth, growth, reproduction and development. They also produce the Marrow which fills the brain and control the bones. The Kidneys are often referred to as the \"Root of Life\" or the \"Root of the Pre-Heaven Qi\". Kidneys house the Will Power (Zhi). ===Fu=== ====Large intestine==== ====Gall bladder==== ====Urinary bladder==== ====Stomach==== ====Small intestine==== ====Triple Burner==== ==Critique of zang fu in modern medicine== The concept of the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4 is based on ancient metaphor and anecdote \u2013 the underlying assumptions and theory are not able to be verified or falsified by experiment. Probably because of this, the concept (and TCM as a whole) has been criticized as pseudo science. ==See also== *Traditional Chinese medicine *Wu Xing ==Notes== ==References== * (2006-07-18), \"\", , retrieved 2010-12-16 **Cultural China (2007), \"Chinese Medicine : Basic Zang Fu Theory\", \"Kaleidoscope \u2192 Health\", retrieved 2010-12-21 *Kaptchuk, T (2000). \"The Web That Has No Weaver: Understanding Chinese Medicine, 2nd ed.\" Mcgraw-Hill. *Oguamanam C.
