The station is officially an unstaffed halt (tickets must be purchased on the train or prior to travel), but the level crossing at the south end is still manned (due to its location next to the river bridge) and retains its manually-operated metal gates; the crossing keeper works out of an office in the main building. Up until 1993, the crossing also had protecting signals worked from a ground frame on the platform; these were replaced by stop and fixed distant boards after the gates were run through by a train.Tal-y-Cafn ground frame (1991) Roberts, Alan Geograph.org.uk; Retrieved 31 May 2017 Digital CIS displays, a pay phone and timetable poster boards are provided to offer train running information.
