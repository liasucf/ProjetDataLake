It was mobilized in World War I, with the searchlight battery mobilized in World War II. ==World War I== The 49th Artillery (Coast Artillery Corps) (CAC) was organized in July 1918 at Camp Eustis, Virginia, commanded by Colonel Le Vert Coleman. The regiment was one of a number of US Army coast artillery units organized to operate heavy field artillery and railway artillery on the Western Front. It moved to Brest, France, via the Newport News port of embarkation in October 1918 on the French transport SS Lutetia, accompanied by the 38th Artillery Brigade (CAC) headquarters.49th Coast Artillery in WWI at Rootsweb.com38th Artillery Brigade in WWI at Rootsweb.com Upon arrival, the regiment moved from Brest to Operations & Training Center No. 4 at Angers, France. The regiment was slated to be armed with 24 British- designed, American-made 8-inch M1917 howitzers, but did not commence training, see action, or receive guns before the war ended. It returned to the US on the troop transport USS Panaman, arriving at Camp Merritt, New Jersey, in March 1919, and demobilized that month at Camp Grant, Illinois.Rinaldi, p. 161 An American Legion memorial with a retrospective on Captain Samuel H. Bradbury, Jr., an officer of the regiment who died of influenza in transit to France, mentions that he was an uncle of science fiction author Ray Bradbury, though Samuel died before Ray was born. Captain Bradbury is interred at the Oise- Aisne American Cemetery near F\u00e8re-en-Tardenois, France. The memorial was probably placed by the American Legion Homer Dahringer Post 281 in Waukegan, Illinois, birthplace of both Bradburys. ==World War II== During World War II, the regiment was re-constituted on 28 April 1942 as an inactive regiment in the Army of the United States.
