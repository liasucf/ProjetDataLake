It was arranged with the special cooperation of Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. with official naming rights. The draft was officially called \"The Professional Baseball Draft Meeting supported by Lipovitan D\". == Summary == As of the 2008 Draft, High School, University and Industrial League players could be selected at the same time whereas previous to 2008, separate drafts were held for each level of player. As with the previous year, Taisho Pharmaceuticals was the special partner with naming rights. The Draft was named \"The 2014 Professional Baseball Draft Meeting supported by Lipovitan D.\" Lipovitan D is one of Taisho's main brands. Only the first round picks were allowed to be contested with all picks from the second round onward being based on table placing in the 2014 NPB season in a waiver system. From the third round the order was reversed continuing in the same fashion until all picks were exhausted. The Draft waiver priority was decided upon the winners of the 2014 NPB All-Stars game, but as the series ended 1-1 preference was based on point difference between the Central and Pacific Leagues where the former had a higher differential. In total, 81 players were signed to professional contracts including 46 pitchers, 7 catchers, 17 infielders and 11 outfielders with 23 development players also signed. == First Round Contested Picks == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !!!Player Name!!Position!!Teams Selected by |- |First Round||Tomohiro Anraku||Pitcher||Rakuten\u3001Yakult |- |First Round||Kohei Arihara||Pitcher||DeNA\u3001Nippon Ham\u3001Hanshin, Hiroshima |- |Second Round||Yasuaki Yamasaki||Pitcher||DeNA\u3001Hanshin |} * Bolded teams indicate who won the right to negotiate contract following a lottery. == Selected Players == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:15%;\" |+Key !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#bfb;\"|* |Player did not sign |} === Pacific League === ==== Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Pick!!Player Name!!Position!!Team |- !#1 |Yuki Matsumoto||Pitcher||University of Morioka Affiliated High School |- !#2 |Ryoya Kurihara||Catcher||Harue Technical High School |- !#3 |Shogo Furusawa||Infielder||Kyushu International University High School |- !#4 |Shunsuke Kasaya||Pitcher||Oita Commercial and Business High School |- !#5 |Yosuke Shimabukuro||Pitcher||Chuo University |- !colspan=\"5\"|Development Player Draft |- !#1 |Kazuhiro Koyama||Outfielder||Fuji Daiichi High School |- !#2 |Seiya Saito||Outfielder||Iwata East High School |- !#3 |Amon Yamashita||Pitcher||Komatsu Ohtani High School |- !#4 |Tamon Horiuchi||Catcher||Yamamura International High School |- !#5 |Eiji Kakinoki||Pitcher||Yanagawa High School |- !#6 |Sh\u014dta Kaneko||Outfielder||Ohmama High School |- !#7 |Daiki Kono||Infielder||NOMO Baseball Club |- !#8 |Keigo Nakamura||Pitcher||Toyama Thunder Birds |} ==== Orix Buffaloes ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Pick!!Player Name!!Position!!Team |- !#1 |Sachiya Yamasaki||Pitcher||Meiji University |- !#2 |Yuma Mune||Infielder||Yokohama Hayato High School |- !#3 |Kodai Sano||Pitcher||Oita High School |- !#4 |Ban Takagi||Pitcher||NTT East Japan |- !#5 |K\u014dki Sait\u014d||Pitcher||Hokusho High School |- !#6 |Seiichi Sakayori||Pitcher||JR East |- !#7 |Masahiro Nishino||Infielder||JR East |- !#8 |Yuya Oda||Outfielder||Nippon Life |- !#9 |Yu Suzuki||Pitcher||Tokyo Metropolitan Yukigaya High School |} ==== Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Pick!!Player Name!!Position!!Team |- !#1 |Kohei Arihara||Pitcher||Waseda University |- !#2 |Y\u016bshi Shimizu||Catcher||Kyushu International University High School |- !#3 |Daiki Asama||Outfielder||Yokohama High School |- !#4 |Naoya Ishikawa||Pitcher||Yamagata Central High School |- !#5 |Hayao Segawa||Pitcher||Muroran Sharks |- !#6 |Shota Tatsuta||Pitcher||Yamato-Koryo Senior High School |- !#7 |Yuto Takahama||Infielder||Yokohama High School |- !#8 |Kengo Ohta||Infielder||Kawagoe Technical High School |- !#9 |Masataka Sato||Catcher||Aichi Keisei High School |} ==== Chiba Lotte Marines ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Pick!!Player Name!!Position!!Team |- !#1 |Shogo Nakamura||Infielder||Waseda University |- !#2 |Eisuke Tanaka||Pitcher||Kyoto University |- !#3 |Daiki Iwashita||Pitcher||Seiryo High School |- !#4 |Kandai Terashima||Catcher||S\u014dka University |- !#5 |Kazuya Katsuki||Infielder||Osaka Toin High School |- !#6 |Atsushi Miyazaki||Pitcher||Hiroshima Kokusai Gakuin University |- !#7 |Naoto Wakimoto||Outfielder||Takasaki University of Health and Welfare High School |} ==== Saitama Seibu Lions ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Pick!!Player Name!!Position!!Team |- !#1 |Kona Takahashi||Pitcher||Maebashi Ikuei High School |- !#2 |Yasuo Sano||Pitcher||Heisei International University |- !#3 |Shuta Tonosaki||Infielder||Fuji University |- !#4 |Yusuke Tamamura||Pitcher||Tsuruga Kehi High School |- !#5 |Haruka Yamada||Infielder||Saga Prefectural Saga Technical High School |- !colspan=\"5\"|Development Player Draft |- !#1 |Daisuke Togawa||Outfielder||Hokkai High School |} ==== Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Pick!!Player Name!!Position!!Team |- !#1 |Tomohiro Anraku||Pitcher||Saibi High School |- !#2 |Fumiya Ono||Pitcher||Nishinippon Junior College High School |- !#3 |Masayoshi Fukuda||Outfielder||Chuo University |- !#4 |Luciano Fernando||Outfielder||Hakuoh University |- !#5 |Takahiro Irino||Pitcher||Tokushima Indigo Socks |- !#6 |Masashi Kato||Pitcher||JR East |- !#7 |Ryota Ito||Infielder||Nippon Paper |- !colspan=\"5\"|Development Player Draft |- !#1 |Takumaru Yaoita||Outfielder||Seiko Gakuen High School |- !#2 |Hiroki Osakaya||Infielder||Aomori Chuo Gakuin University |} === Central League === ==== Yomiuri Giants ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Pick!!Player Name!!Position!!Team |- !#1 |Kazuma Okamoto||Infielder||Chiben Gakuen High School |- !#2 |Chiaki Tone||Pitcher||Nihon University |- !#3 |Hayato Takagi||Pitcher||Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Nagoya |- !#4 |Daiki Tanaka||Pitcher||Kokugakuin University |- !colspan=\"5\"|Development Player Draft |- !#1 |Shinpei Shinohara||Pitcher||Kagawa Olive Guyners |- !#2 |Takuya Kawai||Infielder||J.
