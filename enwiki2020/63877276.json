In recent times this traditional slipper can be worn by anyone to events such as festivals, funerals, marriage ceremonies and to church.Ahenema slippers == History == In the past, Ahenema was strictly worn by people of royal descent and was often named after the king. This method of naming was later changed, to be named after the children of the king. This was because the kings' name should not be mentioned in vain hence Ahenema which translates as king's children. The slipper was formally made of wood and rope however it is now made with leather. The sole of an Ahenema slipper is carved into the number 8 which represents stability. == Types == There are basically two types of Ahenema. One being \"Asansan tuo\" which is designed to have a curved shape and the other \"Atine\" which has a straight shape and worn mostly by chiefs. == References == Category:Akan culture Category:African clothing ",
