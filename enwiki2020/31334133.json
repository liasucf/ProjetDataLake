Joanna Helm, portrayed by Sarah Manners, first appeared on 26 March 2000, and made her last appeatance on 1 June 2001. Joanna is a receptionist at the surgery, the first that the surgery had. Joanna meets her grandmother Jessie (Marcia Ashton), and when she looks at Jessie's medical records, she finds out that she is dying of a brain tumour. Jessie tells Joanna that she knows she is dying, and asks Joanna to help her die. Joanna helps Jessie die, and pretends to be upset when she is told that Jessie died overnight. However, when Jessie's nurse takes a look at how she died, she suspects foul play. Mac McGuire (Christopher Timothy) was suspected on killing Jessie, however Mac is cleared. Due to the guilt, Joanna began taking drugs, stealing them from the surgery. She subscribed to more drugs, forging signatures of doctors at the surgery, and eventually took an overdose, nearly dying. She later confessed to the death of her nan, all part of an euthanasia pact, and was dismissed by Mac. ===Development=== Joanna was described as \"troubled\" and \"dippy\". Manners also opined that Joanna caused \"mischief\". Wales Online described Joanna as \"bubbly\". According to Daily Mirror, Manners \"won herself an army of male fans\" as Joanna, as she was \"flirty\". Sunday Mail described her storylines, \"She was involved in mercy killing, drug addiction and a suicide attempt to name but a few of her spicier plotlines\". Manners said of this, \"I got the best storylines in the world in Doctors, my nan died of a brain tumour then it came out I killed her. I went mad and was addicted to anti-depressants, forged signatures and tried to kill myself\". When it was announced that Manners was to join Casualty after she had departed the show, the Sunday Mail said, \"That spells trouble for everyone if her medical record is anything to go by\" and similarly when Manners joined The Bill after she departed the show, The Metro said that Manners \"rose to fame\" whilst on the show. ==Kate McGuire== Kate McGuire, portrayed by Maggie Cronin, first appeared on 26 March 2000, and made her last appearance on 26 May 2006.

Whilst in Ireland, Mac visits Ciaran and has an affair with her whilst there. Julia finds out, ordering them to leave the surgery, and both depart to Ireland. At the 2003 British Soap Awards, Cronin was nominated for \"Best Actress\" but Kacey Ainsworth who played EastEnders Little Mo Mitchell won, and again in the 2004 British Soap Awards, but Suranne Jones who played Coronation Street Karen McDonald won. In the 2003 British Soap Awards, Cronin was also nominated for \"Villain of the Year\", but Brian Capron who played Coronation Street Richard Hillman won. ==Mac McGuire== Dr. Brendan \"Mac\" McGuire, portrayed by Christopher Timothy, first appeared on 26 March 2000, and made his last appearance on 26 May 2006.

This marriage only lasted seven years when in 2002, Kate has an affair with a priest, resulting in Mac having a heart attack. The near-death experience resulted in Mac confiding in Julia. Mac then remarries Julia in 2004, but the pair divorce in 2007. Mac becomes friends with Dr Peter Kendrick (Robert Cavanah), however Peter became depressed and soon committed suicide. On 26 May 2006, Mac leaves Letherbridge, moving to Ireland, after Julia orders him and Kate to leave when she discovers he had an affair with Kate. ===Development and reception=== Christopher Timothy (pictured) described Mac as \"James Herriot grown older\". In the press release for Doctors in March 2000, Timothy was said to be \"thrilled\" to be on the show adding, \"On set there's an amazing sense of drama and commitment from everyone around. People really want it to be a success\". Described as a \"old-fashioned and highly-respected physician who isn't afraid to speak his mind\", Timothy added that Brendan (known to his colleagues as \"Mac\"), is \"James Herriot grown older\". In an interview with Sussex Life, Timothy stated of his time on Doctors that he loved \"the dramatic standards achieved by the fast-paced series, despite the kind of squeeze on time and resources unheard of\" adding, \"The budget was a joke and the pressure more intense than anything I\u2019d ever experienced. But it was six years of great fun and I got to direct, which I loved\". When asked if he had picked up any medical knowledge from the role he said, \"No, not really. I spent a week with a real vet in Yorkshire and a day with a real GP in his surgery but I didn\u2019t really watch procedures. The actual procedures \u2013 how to take blood pressure and that sort of thing \u2013 I picked up as I went along\". He added that; \"Working in something like Doctors you learn your lines, you say the scene and then forget them because you then have to remember another scene, and another scene\". Head of Drama Mal Young said Timothy sat in a consultation room for a day, adding that people were \"very good and mostly unfazed by the sight of an actor listening, they were very understanding, especially one woman who came in to talk about hormone replacement therapy!\". TV Choice Nick Fiaca commented that Julia had a \"torrid time\" with Mac. In 2010, producer Peter Eryl Lloyd was asked by Digital Spy if Mac was to return, in which he replied, \"I don't know why we'd do that unless there was a very good reason. The show has moved on since Chris was with us so I don't think anyone would want the character back just out of nostalgia. But if it's motivated, if it has an impact on our characters and makes sense dramatically, then never say never\". The British Theatre Guide, said Mac was \"very successful\". In the 2003 British Soap Awards, Timothy was nominated for \"Best Actor\" but lost out to Brian Capron who played Coronation Street Richard Hillman. Again, in 2004 and 2005, he was nominated for \"Best Actor\", but Shane Richie who plays EastEnders Alfie Moon won both of the 2004 and 2005 awards. In the 2006 awards, he was nominated for \"Best Actor\" but lost out to Ross Kemp who played EastEnders Grant Mitchell. In the same 2006 awards, Timothy and Robert Cavanah who played Dr Peter Kendrick were nominated for \"Best Storyline\", in which Kendrick committed suicide, however Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) and Becca Hayton's (Ali Bastian) affair in Hollyoaks won. ==Caroline Powers== Dr. Caroline Powers, portrayed by Jacqueline Leonard, first appeared on 26 March 2000, and made her last appearance on 1 June 2001.

Caroline starts to have feelings for David, and the two have sex. On Jane and David's wedding day, Caroline runs away with David. ===Development=== In a press release for the announcement of Doctors, it was stated that Leonard, known for her role in EastEnders playing Lorraine Wicks, was cast in the role of Caroline. Leonard had taken a year off from acting, after previously caring for her sick mother, however Leonard started to worry that as she was \"missing out on bigger roles, and she grew concerned that casting directors only saw her as Lorraine\". She said, \"The right job never seemed to come up, I went up for things like Coronation Street and always got down to the last few, but never quite got it, almost like my profile was too high\", she finished in saying, \"Doctors came along at exactly the right time\", stating she felt \"lucky\" and that she is \"the happiest I've been in a long time\". She added, \"There's a lot of humour on the set of Doctors, we're a good melting pot of people from all over, which reflects the cosmopolitan nature of the series\". The BBC described her character as \"demanding\", Daily Mirror describes her as \"hard-drinking\" and \"hard-talking\", and Leonard said she is a \"dark horse who is giving out a lot of signals, right from the very beginning\". ==Helen Thompson== Dr. Helen Thompson, portrayed by Corrinne Wicks, first appeared on 26 March 2000, and made her last appearance on 16 December 2005. Before the series began, Helen married Phil (Mark Adams), with whom she had two children, a son Dan (Joshua Prime) and a daughter Claire (Tara Coleman-Starr).

Helen and Marc set up \"Best Practice\" together and start a relationship. Over time, Helen grows to dislike Marc and claims she is not in love with him anymore, and Marc leaves to build orphanages in Kosovo. In 2004, Helen falls in love with Dr. Jack Ford (Steven Hartley) and he proposed to her, with Helen agreeing. However, Jack is murdered by his former wife Ria (Mandana Jones), devastating Helen. The next year, Marc returns with a new fianc\u00e9, Bella Forest (Sharon Maharaj). However, Marc and Helen realise that they still have feelings for each other, so the pair leave Letherbridge. ===Development=== Helen's character profile on the BBC website describes her as an \"extremely capable doctor and well-liked by her patients and colleagues\", but \"despite being strong and confident, she sometimes found it hard to show her feelings\". In November 2005, Digital Spy Kris Green reported that Wicks would be departing from Doctors alongside Tom Butcher. Green commented that Helen has \"been the unluckiest person in love for the last five years\" and was glad that she was \"finally\" getting a \"Prince Charming\". Her final episode was an hour-long special. In real life, Wicks is married to Butcher, with Green commenting on this saying, \"Interestingly, for Corrinne and Tom, it\u2019s life imitating art as they are, in fact, a couple in \u2018real world\u2019 \u2013 I do sometimes find it hard to distinguish between the two...\". Andrea Green who played Sarah Finch opined that her most memorable scene was \"the very final scene of Doctors shot at Pebble Mill \u2013 it was with my friend Wicks\", commenting that it was \"weird\". ==Rana Mistry== Dr. Rana Mistry, portrayed by Akbar Kurtha, first appeared on 26 March 2000, and made his last appearance 1 June 2001.
