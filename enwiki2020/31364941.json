He was felicitated by CN Annadurai when he became a lawyer, by publishing his photo on the first page of Dravida Nadu, a journal run by CN Annadurai himself and later fondly called him \"Black Prince\". He was involved fully into the anti Hindi agitations called by the Dravidian leaders and went to the prison thrice. As an MLA or otherwise Cuddalore was closer to his heart and toiled to bring it up by helping in the infrastructure development and helped people from all walks of life.
