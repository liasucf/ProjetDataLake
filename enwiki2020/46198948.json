    "text": "Karl David Axel (Akseli) Hirn (s. October 18, 1845 in Hauho \u2013 May 21, 1906 in Saarij\u00e4rvi) was a Finnish minister, and after C. G. T\u00f6tterman, the third mission director of the Finnish Missionary Society. ==Background== Hirn came from a came from a family of clerics. His father was Daniel Kristian Hirn (1807\u20131884), assistant pastor of Hauho. His mother was Gustava Sofia Ulrika Alopaeus (\u2020 1869). Hirn went to school in the Porvoo Gymnasium. He graduated from the university with a degree in theology in 1870, and he was ordained a minister in 1871. He worked as a prison chaplain in Helsinki from 1884 on. ==Tenure as the mission director== Hirn worked as the director of the mission society for a short period, from 1895 to 1898. He was said to have been a \"conscientious, deliberative and hard working director\". He worked as the mission director beside his work as a prison chaplain. During Hirn's tenure the mission society was given bad press, and also the relations to the Evangelical movement began to deteriorate. Members of this movement had earlier been among the most eager to support mission work, and the mission society and the Evangelical movement had held joint Mission and Gospel Feasts. Setbacks in Ovamboland had the effect that The Lutheran Evangelical Association of Finland decided to begin mission work on its own, in Japan, the decision of which was taken in 1898. Also, there were no more joint mission feasts with the Finnish Missionary Society. Donations to mission work increased during Hirn's tenure, however, and also the circulation of the mission magazines were rising, and there were more knitting societies for mission work. Hirn was succeeded as the director of the FMS by Jooseppi Mustakallio.Peltola 1958, p. 129\u2013130. ==Work after the mission society== After his tenure in the mission society, Hirn worked from 1900 on as the vicar of Saarij\u00e4rvi. He died while in this position in 1906. ==Private life== Hirn was married to Selma Erika Sofia Sylvin, who was originally from Sweden. It appears to be the case that they did not have children. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:Finnish Lutheran clergy Category:1845 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Directors of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Mission Category:People from H\u00e4meenlinna ",
