Most of Marx's military toys represented Army equipment, and Marx would later make a practice of befriending generals and naming his sons after them. Following military service, Marx then went to work selling for Newton and Thompson, a Vermont- based manufacturer of wood toys, where he redesigned their product line and increased the company's sales tenfold.Time Magazine 1955; In 1919, Marx and his brother David incorporated, founding the company that bore his name.
