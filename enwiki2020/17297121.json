Outside, a trio of bootleggers \u2013 Cookie, Billie and Duke \u2013 are trying to figure out where to hide the 400 cases of gin they have stashed on their boat. As a stranger approaches, Duke and Cookie rush off. A drunken Jimmy staggers and comes across the pants-wearing Billie and is immediately smitten. He explains his plight \u2013 he must marry someone respectable or his mother will disinherit him, so he's marrying someone he doesn't truly love. Billie isn't all that interested in his tale of woe, until he reveals that he has a huge Long Island beach house that he never uses, so she swipes his wallet to discover the address. Jimmy assumes Billie is falling for him, but Billie insists that love is for suckers. Jimmy vehemently disagrees (\"Nice Work If You Can Get It\"). Jimmy passes out, and Billie focuses on this interesting man unconscious on the ground before her (\"Nice Work If You Can Get It - Reprise\"). Cookie and Duke rush back on, and Billie tells them that she found a place to store their bootleg \u2013 a Long Island beach house. A police whistle pierces the air, and the bootleggers scatter. Senator Max Evergreen and Chief Berry enter, along with Duchess Estonia Dulworth, who has brought along her Vice Squad and vows to rid society of its greatest evil (\"Demon Rum\"). The next morning, Billie, Cookie and Duke have stored their 400 cases of gin in the cellar of Jimmy's ritzy beach house. Eileen Evergreen, the finest interpreter of modern dance in the world, enters with Jimmy. They were married that morning, and they are on their honeymoon, though Eileen has yet to allow Jimmy to touch her. Cookie, disguised as a butler, enters and they naturally assume he's their servant. They send him off, and Eileen tells Jimmy that she's ready for the honeymoon shenanigans to begin \u2013 as soon as she takes a bath. She exits into the house as Billie enters, stunned to see Jimmy. Jimmy has no memory of meeting her last night, and as Jimmy flirts with her, Billie confesses that she's never been kissed. Strictly for educational purposes, Jimmy kisses Billie, and she realizes what she's been missing (\"Someone to Watch Over Me\"). Four and a half hours later, Eileen is still bathing (\"Delishious\"). In the ritzy living room, Cookie and Billie devise a plan for Billie to distract Jimmy from the 400 cases of gin in his cellar. Billie runs off as Jimmy enters, followed by a gaggle of chorus girls who invite him for a group swim, which Jimmy almost accepts (\"I've Got to be There\"). Eileen enters with a flourish, and just as she is about to let Jimmy touch her, he receives a telegram revealing that his last wife has refused to sign the annulment, and an irate Eileen storms off to get her father. That night in Jimmy's ritzy bedroom, Billie breaks in and tries to seduce him, badly (\"Treat Me Rough\"). Chief Berry, who has been pursuing Billie, barges in to arrest her. But Jimmy convinces him that Billie is actually his newest wife (\"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\") and Billie and Jimmy are forced to spend the whole night together in his bedroom. The next morning, Jeannie, a happy-go-lucky chorus girl, comes upon Duke, a lug from New Jersey, and mistakes him for an actual English Duke. Duke, who is perpetually nervous around women, tries to escape, but Jeannie does everything in her power to get him to notice her (\"Do it Again\"). In the ritzy living room, Jimmy and Billie realize that they are hopelessly in love (\"'S Wonderful\") But Eileen returns with her father \u2013 the ultra-conservative Senator Evergreen \u2013 and her aunt \u2013 the Duchess Estonia Dulworth \u2013 to demand that Jimmy and Eileen have a legal wedding. Jimmy has no choice but to marry Eileen, and Billie pretends to be a cockney maid so she can stick around and guard the bootleg. As Eileen beelines towards the cellar to get the wedding china, Jimmy and Cookie frantically distract the wedding party away from the basement (\"Fascinating Rhythm\") as the curtain falls. Act II On the ritzy terrace, the Vice Squad and Chorus Girls revel (\"Lady Be Good\"). Billie enters and realizes she'll never be as happy as the dancing revelers around her (\"But Not For Me\"). Cookie and Duke enter and, since they're all now disguised as servants, they plot how they can get the impending wedding luncheon over and done with as quickly as possible. The Duchess barrels on to instruct Cookie in the finer points of luncheon preparation. She insists on hiring a string quartet for entertainment, but Cookie has other ideas (\"By Strauss\" / \"Sweet and Lowdown - Reprise\"). As Billie sets the ritzy luncheon table, Jimmy makes one last attempt to appease her (\"Do, Do, Do\"). But Billie will have none of it. As the luncheon begins, Cookie and Duke frantically serve the luncheon guests, and the Duchess continues to annoy Cookie, who spikes her lemonade with Gin. Billie entertains them all with a cockney song (\"Hangin' Around With You\") which mainly serves as an excuse to keep pouring hot soup on Jimmy's lap. But Billie accidentally pours some steaming soup onto Eileen, who immediately fires her. The Duchess, now happily drunk, defends Billie and reveals a deep secret as she grabs onto Cookie, climbs on the luncheon table and swings from a chandelier (\"Looking for a Boy\"). After he drags off the Duchess, an angry Jimmy calls Billie a common criminal, and they realize that they can never be together. Jimmy goes to prepare for his wedding, as Jeannie enters looking for Duke, who Billie accidentally reveals isn't a real duke. Jeannie is furious, so Duke tries to win her over with a poem (\"Blah Blah Blah\"), but Jeannie rushes away. In the ritzy bedroom, Cookie is dressing Jimmy for his wedding as Billie enters to return his wallet. Jimmy and Billie both realize that this is the last time they'll ever see each other (\"Will You Remember Me?\"). The Chorus Girls and Vice Squad set up the wedding (\"I've Got To Be There - Reprise\"). As Senator Evergreen presides, Eileen makes her very grand entrance (\"I've Got a Crush on You\"). But just before vows are exchanged, Cookie and Duke rush in, pretending to be Prohibition Agents, though Chief Berry quickly enters and reveals their true identities. As they're arrested, Jeannie rushes in and proclaims her love for Duke, then the now sober Duchess proclaims her love for Cookie. Still, Senator Evergreen insists the bootleggers must be arrested, but Jimmy's mother, Millicent, makes an appearance, revealing the true nature of her son's heritage \u2013 Senator Evergreen is Jimmy's father. The senator proclaims the day a joyous one and all are free to pursue their new and surprising loves. Jimmy realizes that Billie has rushed to the boathouse to sail away forever, and he rushes to swear his devotion to her. Millicent follows and reveals that she happens to be the biggest rum-runner on Long Island, and she'd like Billie to marry her son and take over her business. Billie happily accepts (\"Someone to Watch Over Me - Reprise\"). And on the ritzy terrace under a starry night, love has blossomed, the bootleg is opened and the company celebrates their new found joy (\"They All Laughed!\"). ==Musical numbers== ;Act 1 * \"Sweet and Lowdown\" \u2013 Jimmy, Jeannie, Chorus Girls and Society Guys * \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" \u2013 Jimmy and Billie * \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" (Reprise) \u2013 Billie * \"Demon Rum\" \u2013 Duchess, Chief Berry, Senator and Vice Squad * \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" \u2013 Billie * \"Delishious\" \u2013 Eileen, Bubble Girls and Boys * \"I've Got to Be There\" \u2013 Jimmy, Jeannie and Chorus Girls * \"I've Got to Be There\" (Reprise) \u2013 Jeannie and Chorus Girls * \"Treat Me Rough\" \u2013 Billie * \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\" \u2013 Jimmy, Billie and Chief Berry * \"Do It Again\" \u2013 Jeannie and Duke * \"'S Wonderful\" \u2013 Jimmy and Billie * \"Fascinating Rhythm\" \u2013 Jimmy, Cookie and Company ;Act 2 * \"Lady Be Good\" \u2013 Orchestra * \"But Not for Me\" \u2013 Billie * \"By Strauss\" \u2013 Duchess * \"Sweet and Lowdown\" (Reprise) \u2013 Cookie * \"Do, Do, Do\" \u2013 Jimmy, Elliot, Vic and Floyd * \"Hangin' Around With You\" \u2013 Billie * \"Looking for a Boy\" \u2013 Duchess and Cookie * \"Blah, Blah, Blah\" \u2013 Duke * \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\" (Reprise) \u2013 Billie and Jimmy * \"Will You Remember Me?\" \u2013 Billie and Jimmy * \"I've Got to Be There\" (Reprise) \u2013 Chorus Girls and Vice Squad * \"I've Got a Crush on You\" \u2013 Eileen, Chorus Girls and Vice Squad * \"Blah, Blah, Blah\" (Reprise) \u2013 Jeannie and Duke * \"Looking for a Boy\" (Reprise) \u2013 Cookie and Duchess * \"Delishious\" (Reprise) \u2013 Chief Berry and Eileen * \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" (Reprise) \u2013 Jimmy and Billie * \"They All Laughed\" \u2013 Full Company ==Reception== Reviews of the Broadway production were mixed. Ben Brantley, in his New York Times review, wrote: \"Every now and then, a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of \u201cNice Work if You Can Get It,\u201d the pastiche of a 1920s musical featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. Most of this show, which opened on Tuesday night at the Imperial Theater, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of jokes and dance numbers performed by talented people who don\u2019t entirely connect with the whimsy of a bygone genre. [...] But then, all at once, there\u2019s a moment of delicate ridiculousness, of utterly credible improbability, that signals what Kathleen Marshall, the production\u2019s director and choreographer, must have been aiming for.\"Brantley, Ben. \"Theater Review. Falling in Love, Footstep by Footstep\" The New York Times, April 24, 2012 The USA Today reviewer wrote: \"[...] director/choreographer Kathleen Marshall and a stellar cast ensure that the show is as charming in execution as it is disheartening in theory. [...] For every sharp line, there are a couple that will make you wince \u2014 or would, if they weren't delivered with such disarming spirit and skill. [...] Broderick fares predictably well in the kind of role he does best: a sweetly deadpan social doofus. O'Hara proves once again that there's pretty much nothing she can't do on stage. [...] [T]he excellent Judy Kaye, playing a smug Prohibition advocate, sips spiked lemonade and gets flamboyantly frisky.\"Gardner, Elysa. Broderick and cast do a nice job with 'Nice Work'\" USA Today, April 24, 2012 The Newsday reviewer wrote: \"Kathleen Marshall [...] has put together a rowdy, dopey-smart, dance-driven screwball comedy that never shies from the extravagant edge of clunky silliness. Kelli O'Hara and Matthew Broderick may not seem a likely romantic couple. But their different styles -- her crisp and sublime professionalism, his sleepy-faced cunning naivet\u00e9 and low-watt skills -- spark unexpected chemistry. At least they are very sweet together. Joe DiPietro [...] has used some outlines of \"Oh, Kay,\" a genuine Prohibition fluff ball from 1926, for his new story. He switches the power of the illegal-hooch gang from the guys to a plucky woman in guy's clothes\u2014O'Hara.\"Winer, Linda. \"It is 'Nice Work If You Can Get It'\" Newsday, April 24, 2012 ==Original cast recording== An original Broadway cast recording was recorded in May 2012 for the Shout!
