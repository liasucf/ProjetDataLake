    "text": "In the Hebrew Bible, Gebirah (; , g\u0115v\u00eer\u00e2, -b\u00eer\u00e2; feminine of , g\u0115v\u00eer, -b\u00eer, meaning 'lord') is a title ascribed to several queen mothers of Israel and Judah. ==Description== Literally translated, the title means 'Great Lady' (\"Lady\" being the feminine counterpart etymologically to the male honorific \"Lord\"). However, given that this title is most often attributed to a queen mother, the two have become synonymous, and therefore g\u0115b\u00eer\u00e2 is most often translated as 'Queen Mother'. When romanised, g\u0115b\u00eer\u00e2 can be used as both a common noun (\"a gebirah\", \"the gebirah\") or a proper noun (\"the Gebirah\"), as with most royal titles. Although not present in the Masoretic Texts, the plural form g\u0115b\u00eer\u00f4t is commonly used by academics to avoid the intra-word switching of gebirahs. The gebirah is believed by some scholars to have held great power as counsel of the king. In 1 Kings 2:20, Solomon said to his Mother Bathsheba, seated on a throne at his right, \"Make your request, Mother, for I will not refuse you\". The position of the queen mother (g\u0115b\u00eer\u00e2) was a privilege of the highest honour, and was the highest authority for a woman in Israel or Judah. In fact, the only time a woman held higher office was in the case of Athaliah, who held the throne of Judah as queen in her own right, despite being illegitimate in the eyes of the scripture. To further complicate matters, the word g\u0115beret (; , also , g\u0115bir\u0115t, and , g\u0115b\u0101ret, meaning 'lady', 'mistress', or 'queen') occurs 9 times in the Masoretic Text. In comparison, g\u0115b\u00eer\u00e2 occurs only 6 times. Scholars generally take one of two stances with g\u0115beret: either classing it as an acceptable variation of the word g\u0115b\u00eer\u00e2 within the ketiv (featuring a common qere), or opting for a distinct separation of the two words, despite their converged meanings. ==In Christianity== William G. Most, a Catholic author, sees in the gebirah a type of Mary.Most, William G. \"Mary's Queenship\", Our Lady in Doctrine and Devotion, 1994. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * ==See also== * Asherah * Queen of Heaven * Queen of heaven (antiquity) * Queen mother * Rulers of Israel and Judah * Tawananna Category:Jewish royalty Category:Ancient Israel and Judah Category:Ancient queens Category:Queens consort of Israel and Judah ",
