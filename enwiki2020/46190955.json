For the church he painted what was once the main altarpiece with Saint Anthony Abbot, Francis Xavier, and Ignatius Loyola. He also painted five other canvases of Saints for the church. For the parish church of San Bartolommeo, he painted an Apostle and a Madonna del Soccorso, as well as Saints Jerome and Stephen.
