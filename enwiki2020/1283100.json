It is the capital of the remote and mountainous region of Sfaki\u00e1, and is a small town of just 265 inhabitants (2011 census). It lies on the south coast near the end of the Imbros Gorge, 74 km south of Chania. It has two small harbours, where the ferry boats from Agia Roumeli dock, which in the summer bring the hikers from the Samaria Gorge to take buses back to the northern coast. From H\u00f3ra Sfak\u00edon ferries also go to the nearby coastal town of Loutro and the island Gavdos. H\u00f3ra Sfak\u00edon is a small village with a main harbourfront of tavernas, two minimarkets, a butcher, and a bakery. There is a quiet local beach immediately west of the village, and several pebbly beaches nearby. H\u00f3ra Sfak\u00edon has a variety of tourist accommodations: rooms, studios, and apartments. The local economy is based on tourism, fishing, olive-oil production, and sheep and goat herding. H\u00f3ra Sfak\u00edon prospered during the Venetian and Turkish occupations and up to the 18th century carried on a flourishing trade with its own small fleet. It was said to have had a hundred churches, but it suffered badly from wartime bombardment during the Battle of Crete and the Allied evacuation that followed. H\u00f3ra Sfak\u00edon is famous as one of the centers of resistance against the occupying forces of both the Venetians and the Turks. The impenetrable White Mountains to the north combined with the rocky beaches on the south helped the locals fight off all invaders. Anopolis, a village near H\u00f3ra Sfak\u00edon, is the birthplace of one of the most celebrated Cretan revolutionaries, Daskalogiannis. ==See also== * Battle of Crete * Sfakians ==References== ==External links== * Portal site about the region of Sfaki\u00e1 * Live webcam from the village of H\u00f3ra Sfak\u00edon, Sfaki\u00e1 * Live beach webcam from the village of H\u00f3ra Sfak\u00edon, Sfaki\u00e1 * Local guide to Sfaki\u00e1 * More than 1,000 pictures of Sfakia - from the 1960s until nowadays * University of Lausanne history of Sfaki\u00e1 Category:Mediterranean port cities and towns in Greece Category:Populated places in Chania (regional unit) ",
