Seated as governor in 1948, Lingad served a single term, being defeated for re-election in 1951 due to the fall-out from the Maliwalu massacre. Had Lingad stayed on as governor though, he would have been appointed by President Elpidio Quirino to lead the Department of National Defense due to his stellar accomplishments at the time. After his term as governor, Lingad was still recognized as the political kingpin of Pampanga. And during the elections of 1949, Lingad nominated Diosdado Macapagal, who was then serving as second secretary of the Philippine embassy in Washington, D.C. to run for the 1st Congressional District of Pampanga.
