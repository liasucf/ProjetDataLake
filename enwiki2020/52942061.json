    "text": "A white-tailed ptarmigan, common above timberline. This is a comprehensive listing of the bird species recorded in Rocky Mountain National Park, a park in the U.S. state of Colorado. This list is based on one published by the National Park Service (NPS). Between when the NPS list was published and mid- July 2020, 18 more species have been added through eBird. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. This list contains 283 species and eight identifiable subspecies or forms. Unless otherwise noted, all are considered to occur regularly in Rocky Mountain National Park as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The tags below are used to designate the abundance of some less-common species. Some of the species which the NPS lists as unconfirmed have documented records in eBird. *(R) Rare - \"usually seen only a few times each year\" per the NPS (60 species) *(U) Uncommon - \"likely to be seen monthly in appropriate habitat and season and may be locally common\" per the NPS (82 species) *(O) Occasional - \"occur in a park at least once every few years, varying in numbers, but not necessarily every year\" per the NPS (75 species) *(H) Historical - \"not in park\" per the NPS, but historical records exist (6 species) *(Unc) Unconfirmed - \"Attributed to the park based on weak...or no evidence, giving minimal indication of the species' occurrence in the park\" per the NPS (12 species) *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to North America by humans (5 species) ==Ducks, geese, and waterfowl== Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae A female mallard Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.
