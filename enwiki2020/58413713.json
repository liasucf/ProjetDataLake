    "text": "The Rocket City Trash Pandas are a Minor League Baseball team of the Southern League expected to begin play in Madison, Alabama, in 2021. The team will be the Double-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. They will play their home games at Toyota Field, which was planned to open in 2020. ==History== In November 2017, BallCorps LLC purchased the Mobile BayBears from owners Michael Savit and HWS Group for the purpose of relocating the team to Madison, Alabama, in 2020. Upon relocation, the team will be called the Rocket City Trash Pandas. The name is a reference to both the area's association with the space industry and the determination and ingenuity of raccoons. The Trash Pandas were to begin their inaugural season on the road playing against the Birmingham Barons on April 9, 2020 and play their first home game on April 15; however, the start of the 2020 season was postponed before getting canceled on June 30 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing back their inaugural season by a year. In December 2019, the Rocket City Trash Pandas announced that they had sold over $2 million in merchandise in just over 13 months since announcing their branding. ==Roster== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Southern League (baseball) teams Category:Proposed sports teams Category:Professional baseball teams in Alabama Category:Baseball teams established in 2020 Category:2020 establishments in Alabama Category:Los Angeles Angels minor league affiliates Category:Raccoons in popular culture ",
