    "text": "The Four Major Cases of the early Ming dynasty (/ ) refers to the Hu Weiyong case (), the Lan Yu case (), the prestamped documents case () together with the Guo Huan case (). Occurring during Hongwu Emperor's reign, they were also called the Four Major Cases of the Hongwu era (/ ). They are bracketed together as practices of the emperor's key idea: ruling with severe punishment. Each case, except the prestamped documents case, led to large numbers of people being involved, and consequently, tens of thousands of executions. Traditionally, Hu-Lan (and their cliques) cases (/ ), a combined name of the former two cases against the meritorious officials and officers, was given by Chinese historians.\u660e\u53f2\u7d00\u4e8b\u672c\u672b, Vol. 13 while the targets of the rest were common officials. == Background == === Distrust and revolts === Long before the Yuan dynasty collapsed, the Hongwu Emperor had revealed his distrust of his senior generals. They were issued an order that their wives and children would be detained in the capital as hostages, if they were fighting outside.\u570b\u521d\u4e8b\u8de1, \"\u592a\u7956\u5617\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u8207\u6211\u53d6\u57ce\u5b50\u7684\u7e3d\u5175\u5b98\uff0c\u59bb\u5b50\u4ff1\u8981\u5728\u4eac\u4f4f\uff0c\u4e0d\u8a31\u642c\u53d6\u51fa\u5916\u3002\u300d\" This had probably the reverse effect. Shao Rong (), who was deemed the most skillful general in battle, was sentenced to death for his part in a 1362 coup attempt. Being treated unfairly, another general, Xie Zaixing () revolted later. Both of them were put down eventually. Nonetheless, there was a credibility gap developing between the emperor and his officers. According to Taizu Shilu, the emperor praised Zhao Pu () for his \"foresighted\" suggestion given to Emperor Taizu of Song: removal from their generals' power, when he read History of Song in 1365.Taizu Shilu, Vol.15 \u4e0a\u79a6\u5de6\u95a3\uff0c\u8b80\u300e\u5b8b\u53f2\u300f\uff0c\u81f3\u8d99\u666e\u8aaa\u592a\u7956\u6536\u8af8\u5c07\u5175\u6b0a\uff0c\u8b02\u8d77\u5c45\u6ce8\u8a79\u540c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u666e\u8aa0\u8ce2\u76f8\uff0c\u4f7f\u8af8\u5c07\u4e0d\u65e9\u89e3\u5175\u6b0a\uff0c\u5247\u5b8b\u4e4b\u5929\u4e0b\u672a\u5fc5\u4e0d\u4e94\u4ee3\u82e5\u4e5f\u300d === West Huai faction and East Zhe faction === Since the emperor came from the middle reaches of the Huai River, he installed the figures who also came from there at the imperial court. These people formed the West Huai faction, which headed by Li Shanchang at first, to dominate the court. Hu Weiyong established himself as a pivotal figure after Li's retirement. Beside this, there are some figures from Zhejiang such as Liu Ji, and their allies such as Yang Xian. As their status elevated, regionalism emerged and grew into the political struggle between the East Zhe faction and the West Huai faction. It was said that Hu spoke of his fears to Li\uff1a once Yang Xian was appointed as the chancellor, the people belonging to the West Huai faction would be emasculated and marginalised. Then they removed Yang by fair means or foul.\u570b\u521d\u4e8b\u8de1, \"\u80e1\u60df\u5eb8\u8b02\u5584\u9577\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u694a\u61b2\u70ba\u76f8\uff0c\u6211\u7b49\u6dee\u4eba\u4e0d\u5f97\u70ba\u5927\u5b98\u77e3\u3002\u300d\u61b2\u56e0\u52be\u6c6a\u5ee3\u6d0b\u4e0d\u516c\u4e0d\u6cd5\uff0c\u674e\u5584\u9577\u6392\u9677\u5927\u81e3\u3001\u653e\u8086\u70ba\u5978\u7b49\u4e8b\uff0c\u592a\u7956\u4ee5\u6975\u5211\u8655\u4e4b\u3002\" == Hu Weiyong case == === Second to the emperor === Hu served as a military clerk in former years. On Li Shanchang's recommendation, he was promoted to assistant chancellor and then the right chancellor. === The original convictions === ==== Poison Liu Ji ==== ==== Conceal the arrival of Champa envoys ==== ==== The informer: Yun Qi ==== Under the pretext of visiting a gush of divine spring at his yard, Hu invited the emperor to his residence for the plot: to assassinate this unsuspecting monarch. The latter was obstructed by a eunuch, Yun Qi, half way there. Then the emperor was given advance warning of Hu's attempted coup. He ascended the palace wall and noticed Hu's soldiers ambushed. That corroborated what Yun had warned. After the conspiracy was exposed, Hu was put to death. === The additional convictions after Hu's death === ==== \"Collude with the Japanese\": Lin Xian and Nyoyou event ==== ==== \"Collaborate with the Mongolian\": Feng Ji event ==== ==== Li's complicity ==== == Lan Yu case == == Prestamped documents case == The local officials in Yuan dynasty evolved a working method from which their successors had never departed, until 1376: the imperial court commanded that local governments send an official courier to report their figures about the items at year's end, with the stamped documents. The stamped documents would be cross-checked before they were submitted to the Ministry of Revenue eventually. If the figures didn't seem to tally, the courier had to return for a new stamped document to submit. To avoid traipsing from their seats to the capital, these officials decided to carry spare prestamped documents. However, the emperor couldn't condone such a practice. He affirmed that the participants probably cashed in on it. Thus, both the officials who held the stamps and the signatories were executed. Their accessories were exiled to the frontier. == Guo Huan case == Guo Huan, then Vice-minister of Revenue, was executed for embezzling seven million piculs of grain in May 1385. Among his accomplices, only a few ministers and vice-ministers had been spared,History of Ming, Vol.94 excluding Minister of Rites Zhao Mao (), Minister of Justice Wang Dihui (), Vice-minister (also the acting Minister) of Works Mai Zhide (). One consequence was certain: several ministries were rudderless for about three years. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; !Year !Minister of Personnel !Minister of Revenue !Minister of Rites !Minister of Defense !Minister of Justice !Minister of Works !Chief Senior Censors |- |1384 |Yu Xi () |Li Shu () \u2192 Guo Huan |Ren Ang () \u2192 Zhao Mao |Yu Lun () |Liu Kui () \u2192 Wang Huidi |Mai Zhide |Left: Zhan Hui () Right: Tang Yougong () |- |1385 |Yu Xi \u2192 Zhao Mao |Guo Huan \u2192 Xu Duo () \u2192 Ru Tais () |Zhao Mao |Wen Xiangqing () |Wang Huidi \u2192 Tang Duo () |Mai Zhide \u2192 Xu Ben () |Left: Zhan Hui Right: Tang Yougong |- |1386 |vacant |vacant |vacant |vacant |Tang Duo |Xu Ben |Left: Zhan Hui Right: Tang Yougong |- |1387 |vacant |vacant |Li Yuanming () |vacant |Tang Duo |vacant |Left: Zhan Hui Right: Tang Yougong |- |1388 |vacant |vacant |Li Yuanming |Tang Duo |Tang Duo |vacant |Left: Zhan Hui Right: Tang Yougong \u2192 Ling Han () |- |1389 |vacant |Yang Jing () |Li Yuanming |Tang Duo \u2192 Shen Jin () |Zhao Mian () |Qin Kui () |Left: Zhan Hui Right: vacant |- |1390 |Zhan Hui |Yang Jing \u2192 Zhao Mian |Li Yuanming |Shen Jin \u2192 Qin Kui \u2192 Ru Chang () |Zhao Mian \u2192 An Tong () \u2192 Yang Jing |Qin Kui \u2192 Shen Jin |Left: Zhan Hui Right: vacant |} Later, the emperor's Da Gao (; [Grand Pronouncement]) proclaimed that Guo and his gang had actually embezzled 24 million piculs, while the huge discrepancy between the two accounts was justified to avoid broadly-based popular suspicion. Allegedly, many southern landlords were complicit in these crimes. They were ordered to hand over the so-called loot, driving most of them into bankruptcy. They retaliated by mobilizing public opinion against the trial judge, Wu Yong (). This convenient scapegoat for the will of the Emperor was believed to be responsible for the wrongful death of many innocent people, so he was also executed eventually. == See also == * Literary Inquisition == Notes == == References == * * * * Category:Ming dynasty ",
