    "text": "Saint Catherine of Alexandra is a painting by the Italian Baroque artist Artemisia Gentileschi. It is in the collection of the Uffizi, Florence. Gentileschi likely used the same cartoon or preparatory drawing to create both this painting and the Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria (1615-1617), now in the National Gallery, London. == Scientific Analysis == Artemisia Gentileschi - Self-Portrait 5365 In 2019, this painting was examined by conservators in the Opificio delle Pietre Dure in Florence. Infrared, ultraviolet, and x-ray studies demonstrated that Gentileschi changed the composition while she was in the middle of painting it. The underpainting reveals a female head wearing a turban, oriented towards the viewer. This differs from Gentileschi's final composition in which St. Catherine wears a crown and looks up towards heaven. Tracings from the National Gallery's Self Portrait as St. Catherine of Alexandria were compared to this underpainting and the study concluded that Gentileschi used the same cartoon or preparatory drawings for both of these images. This conclusion provides evidence that Gentileschi used herself as a model when painting images of female martyrs. In addition, the x-rays revealed a third face that was completely painted over in the final version. This was likely an initial sketch for an unrealized work of art, demonstrating that Gentileschi reused her canvases. == References == Category:Paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi category:1610s paintings ",
