Loren put his music on hold to work with Travolta. In 1997, Loren had a small role in the movie The General's Daughter.

While filming From Paris with Love in Paris, France in December 2008, Loren suffered a severe broken ankle after a stunt went wrong and he fell three stories out of a window.

The DVD has been featured in O Magazine, on Dateline NBC's Pet Nation, Entertainment Tonight and The Insider.
