    "text": "is the as the wife of Naruhito, who ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019. ==Early life and education== was born on 9 December 1963 at Toranomon Hospital in Toranomon, Minato, Tokyo.Hills, p. 40. She is the eldest daughter of Yumiko Egashira (b. 1938) and Hisashi Owada (b. 1932), a senior diplomat and former president of the International Court of Justice. She has two younger sisters, twins named Setsuko and Reiko (b. 1966). Masako went to live in Moscow with her parents when she was two years old, where she attended Detskiy Sad (kindergarten in Russian) No. 1127 daycare.Hills, pp. 42\u201344. At the age of five, Masako's family moved to New York City, where she attended New York City public kindergarten No. 81.Hills, p. 45. In 1971, the Owadas returned to Japan, moving in with her maternal grandparents in Meguro while Hisashi returned to the Foreign Ministry office.Hills, p. 46. Masako entered Futaba Gakuen, a private Roman Catholic girls' school in Den-en-ch\u014dfu, Tokyo.Hills, p. 48. Established by the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus in 1872, Masako's mother and maternal grandmother had graduated from this school as well. It was here that Masako learned to play piano and tennis, joined a handicrafts club, and became interested in animals, tending several after school and deciding to become a veterinarian.Hills, p. 49. Masako also studied her fourth and fifth languages, French and German.Hills, p. 50. With a school friend, Masako revived Futaba's softball team, serving as third base and after three years bringing her team to the district championships.Hills, p. 52. In 1979, her second year of senior high school, Masako and her family moved to the United States and settled in the Boston suburb of Belmont, Massachusetts, where her father became a guest professor of international law at Harvard College's Centre for International Affairs.Hills, p. 92. In 1981, she graduated from Belmont High School, where she was president of the National Honor Society and participated in the school's math team and French club. Masako joined the school's softball team and won a Goethe Society award for her German poetry. Masako participated in a production of M*A*S*H. Masako enrolled in the Economics Department of Harvard University/Radcliffe College in 1981. When her father received a posting in Moscow after her high school graduation, it was decided that Masako would stay in Boston to attend school under the guardianship of her father's Harvard friends Oliver and Barbara Oldman.Hills, p. 95. At Harvard-Radcliffe Masako became chair of the school's Japan Society, \"became quite close friends with the then Japanese consul in Boston, and volunteered as a kind of self-appointed diplomat and cultural ambassador\"Hills, p. 101. in the wake of mounting Japan\u2013United States trade tension. Masako liked to ski and traveled overseas during vacations, staying with a host family in France and studying at the Goethe-Institut. Masako is fluent in English and French, which she learned in 1983 at the University Center for French Studies at Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes.cuef.univ-grenoble- alpes.fr, Masako Owada Masako worked with Jeffrey Sachs to obtain a B.A. magna cum laude in economics in March 1985.Hills, pp. 106\u2013107. ==Professional career== After graduation Masako moved back to Japan, where for six months (April to October 1986) she studied law at the University of Tokyo to prepare for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs's entrance examination.Hills, p. 115. Out of 800 applicants only 28 passed, Masako was one of them, along with two other women. \"She was assigned, first, to the oddly named Second International Organizations Division which deals with Japan's relations with international agencies, such as the OECD, a club of 30 rich countries committed to free trade and development. Her assignments included dealing with the OECD's environmental affairs committee ... by all accounts she acquitted herself well\u2014her command of spoken languages, so rare in Japan, was a huge advantage\u2014and was popular with most of her workmates.\"Hills, p. 116. During her free time, Masako attended cooking classes to, according to interviews with her instructor, \"be able to cook proper Japanese dishes when she was entertaining [foreigners].\"Hills, p. 119. Two years later, in 1988, Masako was chosen by the Ministry to be sponsored for two years' postgraduate study overseas with full pay, just as her father Hisashi had been years earlier.Hills, pp. 137, 155. Masako \"desperately wanted to go back to Harvard to do her master's\". According to her former Harvard adviser Oliver Oldman, she \"tried to re-enroll to work towards ... a Juris Doctor. However, Harvard's bureaucrats would not give her credit for her study-time at the University of Tokyo.\"Hills, pp. 152\u2013153. Therefore, Masako enrolled in her second choice, studying International Relations under Sir Adam RobertsHills, p. 139. at Balliol College, Oxford.Hills, p. 155. However, for unclear reasons Masako did not finish her thesisHills, pp. 140\u2013141. and instead returned to Japan in 1990. ==Courtship and marriage== 500-yen coin was issued to commemorate the Imperial Wedding Masako first met Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan, at a tea for Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo in November 1986,Hills, p .120. during her studies at the University of Tokyo. The prince was immediately captivated by herHills, pp. 120\u2013121. and arranged for them to meet several times over the next few weeks.Hills, p. 123. Because of this they were pursued relentlessly by the press throughout 1987.Hills, p. 136. However, Masako's name disappeared from the list of possible royal brides due to controversy about her maternal grandfather, Yutaka Egashira, who while working for the Industrial Bank of Japan was assigned to take over management of one of its creditors the Chisso Corporation to prevent it from financial collapse.Hills, p. 133. Chisso, built in the 1930s, dumped the methylmercury used to make acetaldehyde (a chemical in plastic) into the water surrounding Minamata and other towns, causing the infamous Minamata disease and the resulting scandal. Despite this controversy and Masako's travelling to Oxford University's Balliol College for the next two years, Naruhito remained interested in her. Masako refused to marry the prince because it would force her to give up her promising career in diplomacy and severely restrict her independence and freedoms. Masako finally accepted his third proposal on 9 December 1992. It was reported that he argued that serving as Crown Princess of Japan would only be \"another form of diplomacy\" before she finally accepted this third proposal. The Imperial Household Council formally announced the engagement on 19 January 1993; the engagement ceremony was held on 12 April 1993. Although many were surprised at the news, as it was believed that the prince and Masako had separated, the engagement was met with a surge of renewed media attention directed toward the Imperial family and their new princess. Masako married Crown Prince Naruhito in a traditional wedding ceremony on 9 June 1993.Hills, p. 2. By virtue of the marriage, Masako Owada assumed the formal style Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess of Japan. As tradition dictates, upon her entry into the imperial family and like other members, she received a personal emblem (): rosa rugosa (). In addition, she was placed in the Japanese Imperial Order of Precedence (used for the most formal occasions) behind her mother-in-law, Empress Michiko, and her grandmother-in-law, Empress Dowager Nagako. The orchid flower Dendrobium Masako Kotaishi Hidenka was named in her honour to celebrate the wedding. She became the third commoner to marry into the imperial family, after her mother-in-law and her sister-in-law, Princess Kiko. The then-Crown Prince and Crown Princess marked their 20th wedding anniversary in June 2013. ==Family== Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako in 2019 ===Children=== Masako's first pregnancy was announced in December 1999, but she miscarried. The Emperor and Empress have one daughter: . ===Succession=== Their daughter's birth, which occurred more than eight years after their marriage, sparked lively debate in Japan about whether The Imperial Household Law of 1947 should be changed from that of agnatic primogeniture to either cognatic or absolute primogeniture, which would allow a woman to succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne. A government-appointed panel of experts submitted a report on 25 October 2005, recommending that the Imperial Succession Law be amended to permit absolute primogeniture. On 20 January 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the Diet letting women ascend to the throne in order that the imperial throne be continued in a stable manner. Koizumi did not announce a timing for the legislation to be introduced nor did he provide details about the content, but he did note that it would be in line with the conclusions of the 2005 Government Panel. Plans to change the male-only law of Imperial succession were shelved after it was announced in February 2006 that Masako's brother-in-law and his wife, Prince and Princess Akishino, were expecting their third child. On 6 September 2006, Princess Akishino gave birth to a son, Hisahito, who was third-in-line to the Chrysanthemum Throne under the current law, after his uncle, the Emperor, and his father, Prince Akishino.. ==Public life== Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako attended the JET Programme 30th Anniversary Commemorative Ceremony at the Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo, November 2016 In 1994, the couple visited Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain. They visited Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan in 1995, and again traveled to Jordan in 1999. In 1999, they also went to Belgium to attend the wedding of Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant. In 2002, they paid a visit to New Zealand and Australia. In 2006, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess went to the Netherlands with their daughter, Princess Aiko, at the invitation of Queen Beatrix for a private visit. On 30 April 2013, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess were present at the inauguration of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, which was the Crown Princess's first official overseas appearance in eleven years. In October 2014, she was present at a banquet held in honour of King Willem- Alexander and Queen M\u00e1xima at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, which was her first appearance in such a ceremony in eleven years. She welcomed the couple during an official ceremony at the palace which was her first appearance in a welcoming ceremony after five years. In July 2015, Princess Masako traveled to Tonga with the Crown Prince in order to attend the Coronation of King Tupou VI. Over 40 members of the Japanese media covered the event, during which the happy-looking Crown Princess was warmly welcomed. In November 2015, the Crown Princess attended the Autumn Imperial Garden Party at Akasaka Imperial Garden. It was the first time for her to attend the event in twelve years. ==Health== Masako has remained largely out of the public eye since 2002, reportedly due to emotional disorders which many speculate are caused by the pressure to produce a male heir and adjusting to life in the Imperial Family. Alt URL In July 2004, she was diagnosed as suffering from adjustment disorder and was reported to be seeking treatment. On 11 July 2008, Naruhito sought public understanding for his ailing wife. He was on an eight-day trip to Spain without her: \"I would like the public to understand that Masako is continuing to make her utmost efforts with the help of those around her. Please continue to watch over her kindly and over the long term.\" Pressures to produce a male heir, to conform with the ancient traditions and a 1947 Imperial Household Law are perceived to be behind her illness, as well as negative media coverage of her behavior, the stress of royal responsibility and public life, and turf battles among the Imperial Household Agency.Schreiber, Mark, \"Japan's troubled royals put up a brave front\", Japan Times 1 January 2012, p. 13. In December 2012, at the time of her 49th birthday, Masako issued a statement thanking the Japanese people for their support and saying that she was still receiving treatment for her illness. The Japanese Constitution does not allow the members of the Imperial Family to engage in political activities. Naruhito made controversial comments about discourtesies and pressures placed on his wife by the Imperial Household Agency and his wife's desire to pursue the life of a diplomat. On her 55th birthday, Masako released a statement saying that she felt insecure about her future role as an empress, but added that she would like \"to make an effort for the happiness of the people.\" ==Titles, styles and honours== ===Titles=== *9 December 1963 \u2013 9 June 1993: **Miss Masako Owada (\u5c0f\u548c\u7530\u96c5\u5b50 Owada Masako) *9 June 1993 \u2013 30 April 2019: **Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess of Japan (\u7687\u592a\u5b50\u5983\u6bbf\u4e0b K\u014dtaishi-hi Denka) **Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess Masako (\u7687\u592a\u5b50\u5fb3\u4ec1\u89aa\u738b\u5983\u96c5\u5b50\u6bbf\u4e0b K\u014dtaishi Naruhito Shinn\u014d-hi Masako Denka) *1 May 2019 \u2013 present: **Her Majesty The Empress of Japan (\u7687\u540e\u965b\u4e0b K\u014dg\u014d Heika) ===Honours=== Imperial Standard of the Empress ====National==== * : Grand Mistress and Grand Cordon (Paulownia) of the Order of the Precious Crown * : Dame of the Decoration of the Red CrossMasako wearing Red Cross Medals * : Recipient of the Red Cross Medal ====Foreign==== * : Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash for Services to the Republic of Austria (1999) * : Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold (10 October 2016)Newm Royals * : Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer * : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (2000) * : Dame of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau (27 November 2017) * : Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (2012) * : Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (29 October 2014) * : Recipient of the King Willem-Alexander Inauguration Medal * : Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav (26 March 2001) * : Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry (2 December 1993) * : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (8 November 2008)Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado * : ** Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Queen S\u0101lote Tupou III (4 July 2015)Tonga ** Coronation Medal of H.M.

Her mother Yumiko is descended from the Egashira clan which served the Saga clans near Nagasaki on the island of Kyushu. One of the Egashiras, Yasutaro, went on to command a battleship in the Russo-Japanese War. Yumiko's father was a wealthy banker who was at the time of her marriage the managing director of the Industrial Bank of Japan.Hills, p. 39. ==See also== * Emperor of Japan: Succession * Japanese succession debate * Princess Masako: Prisoner of the Chrysanthemum Throne ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== Biographies: * Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress at the Imperial Household Agency website * Press Conference on the occasion of Her Imperial Highness the Crown Princess' Birthday (2002) * Australian author of Princess Masako biography receives death threats * Hello!
