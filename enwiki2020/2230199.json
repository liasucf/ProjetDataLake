    "text": "Roderich Fick (November 16, 1886 W\u00fcrzburg - July 13, 1955 Munich) was a German architect most prominent during the Nazi regime. Fick trained under Theodor Fischer, became professor at the Munich Technical University in 1935, designed the Munich residence of Rudolf Hess in 1936, joined the NSDAP in 1937, and thereby secured Nazi projects such as various buildings at Adolf Hitler's Obersalzberg complex such as SS barracks. Fick also was given the task of redesigning Linz. His work was part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. After the war Fick was officially classified as a Mitl\u00e4ufer, a 'fellow traveller', a person passively complicit in Nazi crimes. Fick participated in the reconstruction of Linz, and retired to practice in Bavaria. His first wife died 2. October 1938; in 1948 he married Catharina B\u00fcscher, 28 years younger. Daughter Friedrike was born 1950. ==See also== * Nazi architecture ==References== Category:1886 births Category:1955 deaths Category:20th-century German architects Category:People from W\u00fcrzburg Category:People from the Kingdom of Bavaria Category:Technical University of Munich faculty Category:Bavarian architects Category:Architects in the Nazi Party Category:Olympic competitors in art competitions ",
