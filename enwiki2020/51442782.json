Two days later, he made his List A debut for Surrey in the semi-final of the 2016 Royal London One-Day Cup against Yorkshire. He made his first-class debut on 28 March 2017 for Surrey against Oxford MCCU as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club University fixtures.

Pope went on to score 994 runs, including 3 centuries, and even received a commendation in the New South Wales parliament for his on & off-field exploits from MP Chris Patterson, who is also the club's vice-president. He then had a breakout year in 2018 where he averaged 70 in Surrey's County Championship-winning campaign and was awarded the PCA Young Player of the Year award.
