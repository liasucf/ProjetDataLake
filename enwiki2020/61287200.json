    "text": "Yunzhong Commandery () was a historical commandery of China. Its territories were located between the Great Wall and Yin Mountains, and correspond to part of modern-day Hohhot, Baotou and Ulanqab prefectures in Inner Mongolia. The commandery was created during King Wuling of Zhao's reign after a successful campaign against the Linhu (\u6797\u80e1) and Loufan (\u6a13\u7169) peoples.Records of the Grand Historian, Chapter 50. After the establishment of Han dynasty, the commandery became the frontier between Han and the Xiongnu. In early Han dynasty, the region saw frequent Xiongnu raids. However, from Emperor Wu's reign onwards, it became an important base of military operations in the wars against the Xiongnu.Book of Han, Chapter 64. In 127 BC, it was from Yunzhong that General Wei Qing led a 40,000-men strong cavalry force and conquered the modern Hetao and Ordos regions. In 2 AD, the commandery administered 11 counties, namely Yunzhong (\u96f2\u4e2d), Xianyang (\u54b8\u967d), Taolin (\u9676\u6797), Zhenling (\u6968\u9675), Duhe (\u72a2\u548c), Shaling (\u6c99\u9675), Yuanyang (\u539f\u967d), Shanan (\u6c99\u5357), Beiyu (\u5317\u8f3f), Wuquan (\u6b66\u6cc9) and Yangshou (\u967d\u58fd). The population totaled 38,303 households, or 173,270 people.Book of Han, Chapter 28. During Eastern Han, 3 counties were abolished, while 3 new counties were added from Dingxiang Commandery. In 140 AD, the population was 5,351 households, or 26,430 households.Book of Later Han, Chapter 113. Toward the end Han dynasty, the area's population decreased sharply as residents fled from invading northern nomadic peoples, and the commandery was dissolved.Book of Jin, Chapter 14. ==References== Category:Commanderies of the Han dynasty ",
