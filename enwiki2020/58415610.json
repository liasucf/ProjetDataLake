    "text": "The qualification process for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup will determine all 32 teams playing for the Women's World Cup, with the co-hosts Australia and New Zealand qualifying automatically. It is the ninth FIFA Women's World Cup, the quadrennial international women's football world championship tournament. The tournament is the first Women's World Cup to be hosted in multiple countries, the second by an AFC member association after the 1991 and 2007 Women's World Cups in China, the first to be held in the Southern Hemisphere, the first senior FIFA tournament in Oceania, and also the first FIFA tournament to be hosted across multiple confederations (with Australia in the AFC and New Zealand in the OFC). The field was expanded from 24 teams in the 2019 edition to 32 in the 2023 edition. ==Qualified teams== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Team !Qualified as !Qualification date !data-sort-type=\"number\"|Appearance in finals !Last appearance !Consecutive streak !Previous best performance |- |align=left| || || || 8th || 2019 || 8 ||align=left| |- |align=left| || || || 6th || 2019 || 5 || |} ==Qualification process== After FIFA increased the number of teams qualifying for the Women's World Cup, a new distribution of slots to each confederation is expected to be announced at a later date. ===Summary of qualification=== Qualifying matches are scheduled to start in 2021 and end in 2022. Matches will be played on dates within the FIFA International Match Calendar. Apart from the hosts Australia and New Zealand, 207 of 209 remaining FIFA member associations could qualify through their own confederation's qualifying process if they choose to enter. The only exception may be Russia after receiving a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency on 9 December 2019, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated laboratory data to investigators. However, the Russian women's team could still enter qualification, as the ban only applies to the final tournament. Russia's women's footballers could still potentially compete at the tournament were they to qualify, pending a decision from FIFA. Despite that, a team representing Russia, which uses its flag and anthem, is ineligible under the WADA decision. The decision is pending appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Confederation !Tournament !Available slots !Nations started !Nations eliminated !Nations qualified !Qualification start !Qualification end |- | AFC || 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup || ?+H || || || ?+H || 2021 || November 2022 |- | CAF || 2022 Africa Women Cup of Nations || || || || || 2022 || 2022 |- | CONCACAF || 2022 CONCACAF Women's Championship || || || || || 2022 || 2022 |- | CONMEBOL || 2022 Copa Am\u00e9rica Femenina || || 10 || || || 2022 || 2022 |- | OFC || 2022 OFC Women's Nations Cup || ?+H || 11 || || ?+H || 2022 || 2022 |- | UEFA || 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA) || || || || || 2021 || 2022 |- !
