The film follows Colonel Subash, an Indian Army intelligence officer who embarks on a globetrotting mission to hunt down a terrorist responsible for a bombing that resulted in deaths of his loved ones. Accompanied by his colleague Diya, Subash puts his combat skills and intelligence to use as the duo uncover another major conspiracy to rip apart India.The movie was praised for its action sequences.

He is then seen interrogating one of the men. The film then goes into a flashback before Subhash proceeds to shoot the last man. A few weeks ago, Subhash's father, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, retires to be succeeded by his elder son Saravanan. Subhash calls his whole family along with his lover, Meera. Meanwhile, Diya is also shown to be in silently love with Subhash. During a campaign involving the prime minister candidate, Saravanan finds out that his friend Deepak has flown away after extracting 40 billion rupees on loan. When he calls Deepak, Deepak instead tells him to get out of the ceremony. On the other hand, Subhash tries to converse with Meera during the campaign and sends her a message. Realizing she left her phone in the car, Meera goes to the parking lot where her phone gets exchanged with that of a killer. After noting the killer duo's vehicle number, Meera tries to escape but gets attacked and brutally stomped to death by a woman disguised as a cop. Retrieving the phone, she gives a call to the cell phone bomb placed in a cooler at the stage. The bomb goes off, knocking down Saravanan and his family while killing the prime minister candidate. Subhash gets shattered to find Meera's corpse, while Saravanan gets framed for the assassination with the help of Deepak. Having recorded a conversation with Deepak in which the latter told him to escape from the stage, Saravanan calls a press conference at his house amidst violent protests but is found hanging in his room, thus making the media believe he was involved. Subhash then finds out about the killer woman through the vehicle number Meera noted on her palm. Looking at the tattoo on her neck in the CCTV footage at the vehicle store and her phone's screen, Subhash manages to track her, through further investigations, to be a wanted contract killer in London. With the help of a hacker Jack, Subhash manages to trace the woman, fight off her henchmen and kill her by hanging her in the same way she killed and hanged Saravanan to death. Subhash then arrives in Istanbul and is joined by his brother-in-law and Diya. Targeting Deepak's account, they plan to pull off a money extracting mission. The mission goes as planned and Subhash succeeds in retrieving money from Deepak's account. However, when the trio goes to meet Deepak, the latter is found murdered and a chase ensues, resulting in a heroic escape. Subhash realizes a cop posing as a blind man has killed Deepak and framed him. They find that the cop is none other than the city commissioner of Istanbul. Using Diya as a bait, Subhash lures the cop and his henchmen into a trap and fights them off. Back to the present, Subhash threatens to kill the cop who then reveals it was Syed Ibrahim Malik, a Pakistan-based wanted terrorist, the real conspirator behind the explosion. Informing his captain, Subhash then decides to bring Malik in on his own and accompanied by Diya, goes to Lahore, Pakistan illegally where an undercover agent introduces him to Malik's location and armed forces. Learning of Malik's daughter's wedding, Diya enters the house with a fake identity card during the celebrations and secretly drops flammable balls that lead to a fire with the sunrise the next day. Malik is ordered by the Pakistan Military general Tahir Iqbal to accompany his officers to a safe house. Using the opportunity, Subhash chases after the vehicle and successfully takes Malik hostage. Following a car chase, he manages to escape while Diya and the agent wait for him at the airport. Malik is however left behind in the car and Tahir admits him to a hospital where he realises it's his body double who was ordered by Malik himself to accompany Tahir's army, due to being held on gunpoint by Subhash. The two fought, following which Subash captured him. Both disguised, they board the plane before Tahir intervenes and orders to stop it after the airport authorities identify Subhash. The flight to India is stopped and Tahir rushes inside, only to realize Subhash and his team took off in a flight to Nepal. Landing in Nepal, Subhash hands over Malik to the Indian Army.
