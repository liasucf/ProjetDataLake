Its armament includes a manned 30mm main gun, two 12.7mm and two 40mm AGL. It also has a RHIB embarked. == History == The vessel was conceived as a research and development project by Vice Admiral GTA Adekeye and Rear Admiral GJ Jonah, who were at the time Chief of Naval Staff and Chief of Naval Engineering respectively. The first Nigerian-built warship, it was named after the Andoni people of south-eastern Nigeria. \"We came up with the design, the expertise and about 60% of the materials were locally sourced. The engines, generators and navigation equipment came from outside. This is the beginning of the transformation and I believe in another 10 to 15 years, we can be thinking about starting a project to take Nigerians into the air,\" said President Goodluck Jonathan. == References == Category:Patrol vessels of the Nigerian Navy Category:2012 ships Category:Ships built in Nigeria ",
