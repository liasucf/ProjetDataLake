    "text": "June 16, 1992 F5 damage in Bridge Creek, Oklahoma from the May 3, 1999 tornado This is a list of tornadoes which have been officially or unofficially labeled as F5, EF5, or an equivalent rating, the highest possible ratings on the various tornado intensity scales. These scales \u2013 the Fujita scale, the Enhanced Fujita scale, and the TORRO tornado intensity scale \u2013 attempt to estimate the intensity of a tornado by classifying the damage caused to natural features and man-made structures in the tornado's path. Tornadoes are among the most violent known meteorological phenomena. Each year, more than 2,000 tornadoes are recorded worldwide, with the vast majority occurring in the United States and Europe. In order to assess the intensity of these events, meteorologist Ted Fujita devised a method to estimate maximum wind speeds within tornadic storms based on the damage caused; this became known as the Fujita scale. The scale ranks tornadoes from F0 to F5, with F0 being the least intense and F5 being the most intense. F5 tornadoes were estimated to have had maximum winds between and . Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999, engineers questioned the reliability of the Fujita scale. Ultimately, a new scale was devised that took into account 28 different damage indicators; this became known as the Enhanced Fujita scale. With building design and structural integrity taken more into account, winds in an EF5 tornado were estimated to be in excess of . The Enhanced Fujita scale is used predominantly in North America. Most of Europe, on the other hand, uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale (or T-Scale), which ranks tornado intensity between T0 and T11; F5/EF5 tornadoes are approximately equivalent to T10\u2013T11 on the T-Scale. In the United States, between 1950 and January 31, 2007, a total of 50 tornadoes were officially rated F5, and since February 1, 2007, a total of nine tornadoes have been officially rated EF5. Since 1950, Canada has had one tornado officially rated an F5. Outside the United States and Canada, seven tornadoes have been rated F5/EF5 or equivalent: two each in France, Germany, and Italy and one in Russia. Several other tornadoes have also been documented as possibly attaining this status, though they are not officially rated as such. The work of tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis revealed the existence of several dozen likely F5 tornadoes between 1880 and 1995. Grazulis also called into question the ratings of several tornadoes currently rated F5 by official sources. Many tornadoes officially rated F4/EF4 or equivalent have been disputed and described as actual F5/EF5 or equivalent tornadoes, and vice versa; since structures are completely destroyed in both cases, distinguishing between an EF4 tornado and an EF5 tornado is often very difficult.Grazulis, Significant Tornadoes, 143\u201345; 147\u201348. ==List of events== A map detailing the locations of all officially rated F5 and EF5 tornadoes in the United States from 1950 to 2013 The tornadoes on this list have been formally rated F5 by an official government source. Unless otherwise noted, the source of the F5 rating is the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS), as shown in the archives of the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Prior to 1950, assessments of F5 tornadoes are based primarily on the work of Thomas P. Grazulis. The NCDC has accepted 38 of his F5 classifications of tornadoes occurring between 1880 and 1950. In addition to the accepted ones, Grazulis rated a further 25 during the same period which were not accepted. From 1950 to 1970, tornadoes were assessed retrospectively, primarily using information recorded in government databases, as well as newspaper photographs and eyewitness accounts. Beginning in 1971, tornadoes were rated by the NWS using on-site damage surveys. Grazulis' work has identified 16 additional F5 tornadoes between 1950 and 1995, with four later being accepted by the NCDC. As of February 1, 2007, tornadoes in the United States are rated using the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which replaced the Fujita scale in order to more accurately correlate tornadic intensity with damage indicators and to augment and refine damage descriptors. No earlier tornadoes will be reclassified on the Enhanced Fujita scale, and no new tornadoes in the United States will be rated on the original Fujita scale. France and Canada also adopted the EF- Scale in subsequent years. ===Official F5/EF5 tornadoes=== Worldwide, a total of 62 tornadoes have been officially rated F5/EF5 since 1950: 59 in the United States and one each in France, Russia, and Canada. Of the 59 tornadoes in the United States, 50 are officially rated F5 on the original Fujita scale (with dates of occurrence between May 11, 1953, and May 3, 1999), and nine are officially rated EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale (with dates of occurrence between May 4, 2007, and May 20, 2013). An additional four tornadoes which occurred prior to 1950, all in Europe, have been officially rated F5 or equivalent by the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL) or the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO), bringing the worldwide total for official ratings of F5/EF5 or equivalent to 66. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |+ Tornadoes officially rated F5/EF5 or equivalent |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| Day ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\"| Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\"| State/Province ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16%;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Location ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\"| Fatalities ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| Rated by |- style=\"background:#BB8899;\" |- | | | Germany | Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | Woldegk | | This tornado was among the strongest ever recorded, with damage assessed at the highest level of the TORRO scale (T11).

Ground and pavement scouring occurred, and heavy manhole covers were removed from roads as well. On June 10, 2013, an engineering study found no evidence of EF5 structural damage in Joplin due to the poor quality of construction of many buildings. However, the EF5 rating stood as the National Weather Service in Springfield, Missouri, stated that survey teams found only a very small area of EF5 structural damage (at and around the hospital) and that it could have easily been missed in the survey, and the EF5 rating was mainly based on large vehicles being thrown long distances, along with non-conventional, non-structural instances of damage, such as removal of manhole covers, pavement, concrete porches, driveways, and parking stops, and the presence of wind-rowed debris. | SPC, NWS, Marshall |- | | | United States | Oklahoma | Hinton, Calumet, El Reno, Piedmont, Guthrie | | Tornado outbreak sequence of May 21\u201326, 2011 \u2013 Mobile radar recorded winds over .

Intense pavement and ground scouring occurred, with only bare soil left in some areas. | VORTEX, Grazulis |- | | | United States | Texas | Allison, Texas | | A National Weather Service damage survey was not conducted due in part to the extensive damage and injuries from another tornado in Pampa, Texas. Four homes were destroyed and more than 800 head of livestock were killed. An NCDC report states that \"all sighting reports would place this as an F5 tornado\" with storm spotters calling it \"one of the biggest and meanest appearing tornadoes they had ever seen.\" However, this tornado hit few man-made structures and a significant amount of time elapsed before damage could be examined, so it could not be rated higher than F4. | NWS, VORTEX |- | | | United States | Tennessee | Hardin County, Wayne County | | 1998 Nashville tornado outbreak \u2013 Originally considered part of a very long-tracked F5 tornado but was later determined to have been the first in a series of three separate, violent tornadoes. Multiple homes were reduced to their foundations. Although officially rated an F4, a re-analysis conducted in 2013 by the NWS Office in Nashville noted that the damage in Wayne County may warrant EF5; however, no tornadoes are rated using the enhanced scale that occurred prior to February 2007. | NWS |- | | | United States | South Dakota | Spencer | | DOW recorded maximum wind speeds at at 160 ft above ground level, which the NWS classified at almost ground level. Such wind speeds would fall well into the EF5 range on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, though the maximum damage intensity observed in the town of Spencer was F4. The town's water tower was toppled to the ground, an apartment building was leveled, and many homes were completely destroyed, a few of which were swept away. | Wurman |- | | | United States | Texas | Loyal Valley | | Officially rated high-end F4, though one survey revealed potential F5 damage. Two homes were completely swept away, with debris scattered over great distances. Large pieces of a pickup truck were found 3/4 of a mile away from the residence where it originated, and a 720-foot long stretch of pavement was scoured from a road. Ground scouring occurred, and numerous mesquite trees were completely denuded and debarked. A reporter who also witnessed the destruction at Jarrell said \"I hadn't seen anything like that. I couldn't believe what it did to animals, This was wiped clean, too, but the cattle - their hides had been ripped right off of them. Some of them were missing heads, and some were caught up and entwined in barbed wire.\" Had this tornado touched down in an urban area, the devastation likely would have rivaled that from Oklahoma City or the storm that leveled a subdivision in Jarrell in 1997. | Hecke |- | | | United States | Alabama | Tuscaloosa, Holt, Hueytown, Concord, Pleasant Grove, McDonald Chapel, Birmingham, Fultondale | | 2011 Tuscaloosa\u2013Birmingham tornado \u2013 Officially rated high-end EF4, though the final rating was a source of controversy, and one survey team rated some of the damage as EF5. Many homes, a large section of an apartment building, and a clubhouse were swept away, though these structures were either poorly anchored, lacked interior walls, or surrounded by contextual damage not consistent with an EF5 tornado. A manhole cover was removed from a drain and thrown into a ravine near the clubhouse. A railroad trestle support structure was thrown up a hill, and a coal car was thrown through the air. | NWS |- | | | United States | Oklahoma | Chickasha, Blanchard, Newcastle | | Tornado outbreak sequence of May 21\u201326, 2011 \u2013 Officially rated a high-end EF4; however, the survey conducted by NWS Norman mentions this tornado as being a \"plausible EF5\". Well-built homes with anchor bolts were swept away, pavement was scoured from roads and driveways, and vehicles were thrown up to away, some of which were torn into multiple pieces or stripped down to their frames. Trees were reduced to completely debarked stumps, and severe ground scouring occurred, with all grass and several inches of topsoil removed in some areas. A reinforced concrete dome home was severely damaged and cracked. | NWS |- | | | United States | Oklahoma | El Reno | | 2013 El Reno tornado \u2013 Largest tornado on record at wide. Initially rated EF5 based solely on mobile Doppler radar measurements, which recorded winds over . However, the most significant structural damage was rated EF3, as the tornado did not strike any buildings when the EF5 winds were recorded. The rating was eventually downgraded to EF3 because of this, though the practicality of the downgrade has been disputed by some meteorologists. | NCEI, CSWR, Wurman |- | | | United States | Arkansas | Mayflower, Vilonia | | Tornado outbreak of April 27\u201330, 2014 \u2013 Officially rated high-end EF4, though the rating was a major source of controversy, and meteorologist/civil engineer Timothy P. Marshall noted that the rating assigned was \"lower-bound\", and also noted \"the possibility that EF5 winds could have occurred\" despite the structural flaws responsible for the EF4 rating. Numerous homes were swept completely away with only bare slabs left, including one that was well-bolted to its foundation, and extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred. Trees were completely debarked and denuded, shrubs were shredded and debarked, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards and stripped down to their frames. In one instance, a well- built houses was swept away, but an EF5 rating was not assigned as it was just one house and it had been struck by debris from other buildings. A large 29,998-pound metal fertilizer tank was found approximately 3/4 of a mile away from where it originated. Extensive ground scouring occurred as well. | NWS, Marshall |- | | | United States | Kansas | Dodge City | | Tornado outbreak sequence of May 22\u201326, 2016 \u2013 During the initial stages of development, there was DOW data on this tornado. It intensified from 40 meters/second to 90 meters/second in a span of 21 seconds that lasted less than a minute at those velocities. This would have been enough to produce EF5 damage briefly, based on those velocities. As the tornado moved north into a housing addition just west of Dodge City, it showed multiple vortex characteristics and did EF2 Damage. One person was seriously hurt in a home that was heavily damaged. | NCEI, CSWR |- | | | United States | Kansas | Solomon, Abilene, Chapman | | Tornado outbreak sequence of May 22\u201326, 2016 \u2013 An anchor-bolted brick farm home was swept away and was ripped from its foundation so violently that part of the foundation was severely cracked, though the area surrounding the home was not swept completely clean. Vehicles and large pieces of farm machinery were thrown and mangled beyond recognition, and a section of metal railroad track was bent horizontally by the tornado. Officially rated EF4 with winds of 180 mph (290 km/h), though NWS Topeka damage surveyors later noted that based on the severity of the damage in rural areas, it \"could have very well been\" rated EF5 had it struck Chapman directly. | NWS |} ===Possible F5/EF5 tornadoes with no official rating=== Many other tornadoes have never been formally rated by an official government source but have nonetheless been described as F5/EF5 or equivalent, often by independent studies. Most of these tornadoes occurred prior to 1950, before tornadoes were rated according to standardized damage assessments, and their unofficial classifications as F5/EF5 or equivalent have been made in retrospect, largely on the basis of photographic analysis and eyewitness accounts. A few, such as the Tri-State Tornado of 1925, are widely accepted as F5/EF5 tornadoes, despite not being rated as such in official records. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |+ Tornadoes with no official rating, but which may have been F5/EF5 or equivalent |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| Day ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\"| Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\"| State/Province ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16%;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Location ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\"| Fatalities ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| Rated F5/EF5 by |- |- | | | United States | Illinois | West Prairie, Christian County | | Many \"well built\" homes were leveled and farms vanished.
