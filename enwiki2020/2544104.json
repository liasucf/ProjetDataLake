    "text": "Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom is a 1988 album by Tom Tom Club and included the band's cover of the Velvet Underground track \"Femme Fatale\" with David Byrne on backing vocals. The track \"Suboceana\" was released as a single in the UK in late 1988 and received some radio airplay. In the US, a 12-inch (5 track maxi-)single of the song was released, which featured a remix by Marshall Jefferson, and contains the track \"Devil, Does Your Dog Bite\".
