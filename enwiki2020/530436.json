    "text": "B\u0103l\u021bi (; , , , , , , ) is a city in Moldova. It is the second largest city in terms of population, area and economic importance, after Chi\u0219in\u0103u. The city is one of the five Moldovan municipalities. Sometimes also called \"the northern capital\", it is a major industrial, cultural and commercial centre and transportation hub in the north of the country. It is situated north of the capital Chi\u0219in\u0103u, and is located on the river R\u0103ut, a tributary of the Dniester, on a hilly landscape in the B\u0103l\u021bi steppe. ==Name== The word \"b\u0103l\u021bi\" (pl. of Romanian sing. \"balt\u0103\") in direct translation means \"puddle\". It is believed that the city had been named thus because it was founded on a hill dominating the wetland formed where the creek R\u0103u\u021bel (\"Little R\u0103ut\") falls into the river R\u0103ut. In addition to the official name B\u0103l\u021bi and the Russian name ('), between 1940\u20131989 in Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet, and after 1989 in Russian, the name was/is also rendered in Cyrillic as (). ==History and symbols== Saint Constantine and Elena Cathedral on June 2, 1935 ===Coat of arms=== Current coat of arms The current coat of arms and flag of B\u0103l\u021bi, elaborated by Silviu Tabac from the Moldovan State Commission for Heraldry, have been adopted by the Municipal Council in April 2006. A shield, with alternating six silvery strips (symbolizing water), and six blue strips (symbolizing earth) form the background (symbolizing the name of the city). The central element of the shield is an archer in red clothes, in the military outfit (yellow) of Stephen III of Moldavia (Romanian: \u0218tefan cel Mare) times (15th century). The archer represents the medieval military recruitment, formed by local free peasants.In medieval Moldavia Arca\u0219ii lui \u0218tefan (Stephen's archers) were free peasants paying tax only to the country's ruler and ready to serve at the first call. They formed the first line of defence against invaders, and often had to defend their villages and families themselves, or hide them in the forests, before the Principality's army would come to relief. Throughout the hilly part (i.e. most) of Moldova, many summits have an additional man-made earth addition of up to in some places, where warning fires were located in the early Middle Ages. One can easily recognize these spots on the Moldovan, now deforested, mainly cultivated landscape, all the way to the banks of the river Dniester, across from which the Asian steppe begins, and can observe a repeating peculiarity: From each of the summits the otherwise obscured neighbourhood is very well observable, with at least 3 other such spots in clear view, although possibly at a couple hours' walking distance. On top of the shield there is a silver crown in the shape of fortress wall, with seven towers. (The crown represents the fact that the locality is a city. Apart from B\u0103l\u021bi, only the capital Chi\u0219in\u0103u, and Tiraspol are allowed to have seven towers, while other cities must limit this number to three or five.) The shield is supported by two rearing silver horses (the white horse is the traditional symbol of the region, which was part of Ia\u0219i County before 1812). Under the shield there is a ribbon with the Latin inscription CEDANT ARMA TOGAE, meaning let arms yield to the toga. In the Middle Ages, the archer was featured on the coats of arms of the region. In the 19th century, the city and district coats of arms also featured a horse head. In the early 20th century, a shield representing an archer, standing on a hill, the sun, and three bullrush sticks (elements quite sufficient to identify the place where B\u0103l\u021bi is situated in the landscape of the north of Moldova) formed the coat of arms of the B\u0103l\u021bi county, while these and horse elements - the coat of arms of the city proper. ===Flag=== right The city's flag is composed of two horizontal strips: a blue one on the bottom, and a silver one on top. The shield and archer elements from the coat of arms are also present in the centre of the flag. ==Geography== B\u0103l\u021bi is situated on the tops and slopes of three hills and in two small valleys. The land in the north of Moldova is very fertile, mostly consisting of black earth or chernozem. Several extraction sites for raw materials used in the construction industry are also found in the vicinity of B\u0103l\u021bi. The creeks R\u0103u\u021bel, Cop\u0103ceanca, and Fl\u0103m\u00e2nd\u0103 cross the territory of the municipality, and flow into the river R\u0103ut. Also, several lakes are situated in B\u0103l\u021bi: City Lake, Komsolskoe Lake, Hunters and Fishermen Lake, Str\u00e2mba Lake. The municipality covers an area of , of which the city proper , the village Elizaveta (an eastern suburb) , and the village Sadovoe (a north-western suburb) .

R\u0103ut's affluent R\u0103u\u021bel separates another hill in the south, the slopes of which are the Podul Chi\u0219in\u0103ului district. The largest of the three hills dominates the valleys of the creek and river, and contains the city centre and the old town, and the neighbourhoods P\u0103m\u00e2nteni, Dacia, 6th district, 8th district, the city's main industrial area, and Moldova neighbourhood. The top of this hill is occupied by the medical facilities district. B\u0103l\u021bii Noi neighborhood is situated in the valley of the R\u0103u\u021bel creek.

The names of city neighborhoods reflect different historic influences, such as names of 19th century suburbs that are nowadays within city limits: P\u0103m\u00e2nteni, Slobozia, Molodova, Podul Chi\u0219in\u0103ului, B\u0103l\u021bii Noi; others are known by their Soviet-era names: 6th district, 8th district, 9th district.
