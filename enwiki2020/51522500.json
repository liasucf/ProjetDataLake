His mother tongue was the German language. Due to a congenital disorder affecting his left hand, Harrer chose an administrative career after finishing his secondary studies in Esztergom and Buda. Because of his family's financial situation, he was unable to start his studies in higher education. He entered civil service in 1848, working as a clerk at the \u00d3buda local government. He was appointed notary of \u00d3buda on 1 January 1850, when the town was administratively attached to Buda. In 1872, \u00d3buda received the status of \"town with settled council\" (or borough) from King Francis Joseph. Harrer was elected the first mayor of the town on 10 November 1872. He held the position until the election of the first Mayor of Budapest, K\u00e1roly Kamermayer, on 4 November 1873. Harrer actively supported the merger process. After the unification, Harrer functioned as prefect of \u00d3buda (3rd district or prefecture of Budapest, today called \u00d3buda-B\u00e9k\u00e1smegyer) until his retirement in 1886. His son was the jurist and MP Ferenc Harrer, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1919, and was a key promoter of the establishment of Greater Budapest. Harrer's life-size bronze statue sculpted by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kutas was unveiled on 5 March 2010 in \u00d3buda, next to the town hall. A local secondary grammar school is also named after him. ==Sources== * ==External links== * * * Category:1829 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Mayors of places in Hungary Category:People from \u00d3buda Category:Danube-Swabian people category:Hungarian people of German descent ",
