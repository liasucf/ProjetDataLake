    "text": "The term a sliding doors moment became a term popularised in the late 20th- century meaning seemingly inconsequential moments that nonetheless alter the trajectory of future events. ==Uses== Although the term originated from the 1998 film Sliding Doors, written and directed by Peter Howitt and starring Gwyneth Paltrow, examples of 'sliding doors moments' being used in modern vernacular vary to include: *Princess Diana's last minute decision to make a trip to Paris. *Decisions made by the Labour Party ahead of a UK general election. *The fortunes of the Croatian national football team ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in which they would eventually finish as runners-up despite struggling through qualifying. *Personal relationships. *The chequered history of Roxy Music. *The drop in funding of the NHS. * A round table discussion on the Set Piece Menu podcast on how football history might have changed if certain key moments had gone differently, such as England\u2019s 1966 World Cup victory masking wider deficiencies in the post-war state of English football, and the seemingly opportunistic 1992 signing of Eric Cantona by then Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, amongst others. * Bill Simmons frequently declares events to be sliding door moments in the history of the National Basketball Association and its players, teams, coaches and staff on the Bill Simmons Podcast and the Book of Basketball podcast. ==See also== * Butterfly effect * Time loop * Parallel universe * Blind Chance, Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, 1987, filmed in 1981 * Run Lola Run, Tom Tykwer, 1998 * Broad City season 4, episode 1, \"Sliding Doors\" * Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, season 4, episode 9, \"Sliding Van Doors\" ==References== Category:Popular culture ",
