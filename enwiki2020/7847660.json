    "text": "Carlton Aaron (born November 3, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player who played in England, Ireland and minor leagues within the United States. ==High school and college career== Born in The Bronx, Aaron attended high school at both South Bronx High in New York City and Atlantic Shores High in Virginia Beach before moving to Winchendon, Massachusetts in 1999 to attend The Winchendon School for his senior year. After managing just eight games for the Temple Owls in 2000\u201301,Carlton Aaron \u2013 FOX Sports Aaron transferred to UMKC and subsequently sat out the 2001\u201302 season due to NCAA transfer regulations. In three seasons for UMKC, he averaged 10.5 points and 7.3 rebounds in 86 career games.Carlton Aaron Stats ==Professional career== After graduating from UMKC, Aaron joined the Kansas City Steers of the NABL. He then moved to Europe, and after a trial run with the Cuxhaven BasCats of Germany, he signed with the Plymouth Raiders for the 2005\u201306 season. Following the BBL season, he returned to the United States and played for the Holland Blast (IBL) and the Grand Rapids Flight of the International Basketball League. His rookie season with the Raiders was dogged by a recurring ankle injury, but Aaron returned for the following season slimmer and fully fit, after declining an offer from an undisclosed European team. His game rapidly improved and within a month of his sophomore season, Aaron received the recognition he deserved. Aaron claimed the Player of the Month award for November 2006, after leading the Raiders on a six-game winning streak, and thus reaching the summit of the league table for the first time in their history. With a game-high 25 points and 12 rebounds, Aaron was awarded the MVP for Raiders' 74-65 win over Newcastle Eagles in the BBL Trophy Final on March 4, 2007. It was the first time the Raiders had won a top-flight title in their history, made all the more sweeter as Newcastle, the favourites for the clash, were playing with home court advantage. The previous week, the Raiders, playing without an injured Aaron, had lost on the road to Eagles 99-75, thus outlining Aaron's importance to the starting five. Aaron finished the BBL regular season as he league's top rebounder, averaging 12.4 boards per game, and was voted into the league's All-Star First Team, finishing fourth in the overall vote. In May 2007, following Raiders' quarter-final exit from the BBL Playoffs, Aaron returned to the United States where he signed a two-month contract with the Battle Creek Knights of the International Basketball League. On July 24, 2007, Aaron signed with the Guildford Heat for the 2007\u201308 season. Aaron's competitive debut in a Heat vest ironically came on a road trip against his former club the Raiders, in the first of a two-game series in the inaugural BBL Cup Winners' Cup. Upon entering his former home arena, he was greeted by a mixed reaction of applause and jeers from a partisan crowd at the Plymouth Pavilions. Despite reduced minutes compared to previous seasons, Aaron still posted some consistent numbers domestically in the BBL, including 12.4 points per game (and a lowly 6.2 rebounds by his standards), the dominating center could not adapt to the European game and struggled in each of his appearances in the ULEB Cup. In 39:10 minutes of ULEB play, Aaron mustered only 4 points, including the franchise's first ever 2 points in European competition, a lay-up in the 84-68 away loss to KK Bosna. On November 19, 2007, he parted ways with Guilford. In 2009, Aaron signed with the Shamrock Rovers Hoops for the 2009\u201310 Superleague season. In 16 games for the Rovers, he averaged a massive 32.8 points and 20.4 rebounds per game. ==References== ==External links== *Eurobasket.com profile *RealGM.com profile Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Ireland Category:American expatriate basketball people in the United Kingdom Category:Basketball players from New York (state) Category:British Basketball League players Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Surrey Scorchers players Category:Sportspeople from the Bronx Category:Plymouth Raiders players Category:Kansas City Roos men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players ",
