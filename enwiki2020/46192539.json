    "text": "Hellions is a 2015 Canadian horror film directed by Bruce McDonald, written by Pascal Trottier and starring Chloe Rose. The film was an official selection of the 2015 Sundance Film Festival lineup and also screened at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. == Plot == Dora (Chloe Rose) is an average teenager who just wants to have fun and get high with her boyfriend, Jace (Luke Bilyk), the day of Halloween. She is stunned when her doctor, Henry (Rossif Sutherland), tells her that she is four weeks pregnant, something she says should not be possible. Distraught, Dora goes home to wait for Jace to pick her up for a Halloween party while her mother (Rachel Wilson) takes her younger brother, Remi (Peter DaCunha), trick or treating. But before her boyfriend can pick her up, Dora is visited by several children in strange costumes. Their presence is increasingly threatening, culminating with one carrying the severed head of Jace in a bag. Dora must fight the monstrous children, who want her unborn child, a feat made more difficult by the fact that her pregnancy is progressing at a very fast and unnatural pace. == Cast == * Chloe Rose as Dora Vogel * Rossif Sutherland as Dr. Henry * Rachel Wilson as Kate Vogel * Peter DaCunha as Remi Vogel * Luke Bilyk as Jace * Robert Patrick as Mike Corman == Reception == On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 26%, based on 27 reviews with an average rating of 4.7/10.

At the same time, horror websites such as Shock Till You Drop and Bloody Disgusting reviewed it favorably and both outlets praised the film for its imagery and cinematic inventiveness.
