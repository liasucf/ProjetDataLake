In 2018 it was named by the Victorian Society as a heritage building at risk of disrepair. Initially built as a chapel for the Merseyside deaf community, the society said the \"once grand\" gothic structure was now in a \"terrible state\". For 20 years after it closed in 1986 it was run as a successful community centre for the local Igbo community but rising costs forced them out in 2007.Nikolaus Pevsner, Lancashire: Liverpool and the Southwest - Page 79 0300109105 Richard Pollard, Joseph Sharples - 2006 In the city centre there was the octagonal-plan Adult Deaf and Dumb Institute, Princes Avenue, 1886-7, by E.H. Banner. The Merseyside Society for Deaf People (MSDP) is now a charity situated on Queens Drive retail park, west Derby. It has over 30 staff providing services across Merseyside, and moved into a new building in 2017. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in Liverpool https://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends21/0001065021_AC_20180930_E_C.pdf ",
