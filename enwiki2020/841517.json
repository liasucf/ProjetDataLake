    "text": ", also known as Ajima Manz\u014d Chokuyen, was a Japanese mathematician of the Edo period.Smith, David. (1914). His Dharma name was (\u7956\u771e\u9662\u667a\u7b97\u91cf\u7a7a\u5c45\u58eb). ==Work== Ajima is credited with introducing calculus into Japanese mathematics. The significance of this innovation is diminished by a likelihood that he had access to European writings on the subject.Restivo, Sal P. (1992). Ajima also posed the question of inscribing three mutually tangent circles in a triangle;. these circles are now known as Malfatti circles after the later work of Gian Francesco Malfatti, but two triangle centers derived from them, the Ajima\u2013Malfatti points, are named after Ajima..C. Kimberling, Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers , X(179) and X(180). Ajima was an astronomer at the Shogun's Observatory (Bakufu Temmongaki).Jochi, Shigeru. (1997). ==Legacy== In 1976, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) honored Ajima by identifying a crater on the moon with his name. Naonobu is a small lunar impact crater located on the eastern Mare Fecunditatis, to the northwest of the prominent crater Langrenus.United States Geological Survey: Naonobu Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN)Naonobu lunar crater (in Japanese) ==Selected works== In a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Ajima Naonobu, OCLC/WorldCat encompasses roughly 20+ works in 30+ publications in two languages and 40+ library holdings.
