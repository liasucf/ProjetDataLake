    "text": "Spur 408, officially designated as \"Patriot Parkway\", is a connecting freeway between Loop 12 and Interstate 20, completely within the city of Dallas, Texas. The road is an integral part of the orbital road around Dallas, in conjunction with Interstate 635, and parts of Loop 12, Interstate 35E, and Interstate 20. ==Route description== The freeway passes through a generally undeveloped area of Dallas; there are no businesses located anywhere on the route that can provide services to motorists. It is designated as \"Patriot Parkway\" since it passes along the eastern side of the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery; however, it is locally referred to as Spur 408. Spur 408 also passes near Dallas Baptist University and The Potters' House, the megachurch pastored by T.D. Jakes. South of Interstate 20, Spur 408 ends and turns into Clark Road, a local thoroughfare. I-20 traffic can access Spur 408 but only traffic from eastbound I-20 can access Clark Road. Northbound Clark Road traffic accessing Spur 408 doesn't have direct access to I-20. ==History== Spur 408 was designated on March 31, 1965 on its current route. On December 12, 2007, the Dallas City Council and the Texas Department of Transportation entered an agreement to install lighting on Spur 408 at a cost of $2.5 million.Dallas City Council Agenda - December 12, 2007. TxDOT will cover the cost of construction, and the City of Dallas will cover the cost of maintenance and electricity.
