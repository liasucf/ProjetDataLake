He is from Chester Springs, Pennsylvania. ==Playing career== As a youth, Campanale played in the 2001 and 2002 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with the Philadelphia Flyers minor ice hockey team. Campanale played four seasons of collegiate hockey with the New Hampshire Wildcats men's ice hockey team before signing an amateur try-out contract with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the American Hockey League following the 2010\u201311 NCAA season.

He made his NHL debut the same day on April 6, 2011, playing over eight minutes on defense and picking up two penalty minutes in a 3-2 loss to the Boston Bruins.Concord Monitor, April 7, 2011: UNH's Campanale gets call In his first full professional season in 2011\u201312, Campanale signed in the ECHL with the Bakersfield Condors.
