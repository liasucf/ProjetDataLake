    "text": "The Bobbitt reaction is a name reaction in organic chemistry. It is named after the american chemist James M. Bobbitt (born 1930). The reaction allows the synthesis of 1-, 4-, and N-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines and also 1-, and 4-substituted isoquinolines. == General Reaction Scheme == The reaction scheme below shows the synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline from benzaldehyde and 2,2-diethylethylamine. Bobbitt reaction (general reaction scheme) == Reaction Mechanism == A possible mechanism is depicted below: proposed mechanism Bobbitt reaction First the benzaliminoacetal 3 is built by the condensation of benzaldehyde 1 and 2,2-diethylethylamine 2. After the condensation the C=N-double bond in 3 is hydrogenated to form 4. Subsequently, an ethanol is removed. Next, the compound 5 is built including the cyclization step. After that the C=C-double bond in 5 is hydrogenated . Thus, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 6 is formed. == Applications == The Bobbitt reaction has found application in the preparation of some alkaloids such as carnegine,. lophocerine, salsolidine, and salsoline. ==See also== * Pomeranz\u2013Fritsch reaction == References == Category:Nitrogen heterocycle forming reactions Category:Heterocycle forming reactions Category:Name reactions Category:Isoquinolines ",
