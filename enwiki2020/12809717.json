You mean I am boasting, In fact I'm so kind. Mistaken, it doesn't matter, Because I don't care it much. Don't ask me whether I'm fine, you'll get the answer when you see me. Eat well, sleep well, enjoy myself and laugh in good heart. Haha, I'm quite a happy blue cat. All want to me number one, who will be second? Being the first, without joy, is such a foolish thing. Life should be like this, growing up and studying merrily. Don't ask me what place I have got, just look at my face, you'll know all. Don't sigh, don't be sad. Work hard and be happy every day. Haha, I'm quite a happy, happy blue cat. |} ==References== Category:2008 Chinese television series debuts ",
