    "text": "Johan Peter Gumbert (23 January 1936 \u2013 18 August 2016), known in print as J.P. Gumbert, was a Dutch academic who specialised in medieval European manuscripts. From 1979 to 2001 he was Professor, and then Professor Emeritus, of Western Palaeography and Codicology at Leiden University. ==Personal life== Born in Nijmegen, Netherlands, Gumbert was the son of Hans Ludwig Gumbert (1903\u20131994), an antiquarian who managed the Utrecht bookshop and auction house J.L. Beijers. Following completion of his studies at Stedelijk Gymnasium Nijmegen, Gumbert went on to read classics at Leiden University where he met his wife, the classicist Marijke Hepp. The couple had three children, Eline, Max, and Barbara. ==Education and career== During the final year of his initial degree at Leiden, Gumbert became assistant to G.I. Lieftinck (1902\u20131994), Keeper of Manuscripts and (then) Lector in Medieval Manuscripts, joining the latter\u2019s staff after completion of his studies. In 1979, he succeeded his mentor Lieftinck to become the last Professor of Western Palaeography and Codicology at Leiden University. His 1972 doctoral dissertation, subsequently published in a trade edition, examined manuscript production by the monks of the Utrecht Charterhouse (known as Kartuize Nieuwlicht or Nova Lux), a Carthusian monastery in Utrecht. An internationally recognised authority on the medieval book, Gumbert was invited to take up research scholarships at multiple institutions throughout Europe, as well as in the United States and Israel, but elected to remain at Leiden. He sat on the editorial boards of numerous academic journals and scholarly series, organised several informal circles devoted to codicology and palaeography, and acted as both treasurer and committee member for the prestigious , Comit\u00e9 International de Pal\u00e9ographie Latine, for half a decade. In addition, he co- founded the academic journal Gazette du Livre M\u00e9di\u00e9val, and helped establish the Association Pal\u00e9ographique Internationale \u2014 Culture, \u00c9criture, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 in 1993. His 1989 Panizzi Lecture at the British Library was published in 1990 as The Dutch and Their Books in the Manuscript Age. A prolific and well-respected scholar, he published individual research and editorial works in multiple languages including Dutch, English, French, and German. A full bibliography of his output to 2003 is available in the special issue of Quaerendo published in his honour in 2003. ==Awards and honours== Regarded as \"unquestionably one of the most prominent codicologists the Netherlands has produced\", Gumbert was an elected member of the Comit\u00e9 International de Pal\u00e9ographie Latine, and, from 1997, a member of , Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen (Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences). In 2011 he was appointed Ridder (Knight) in the Orde van Oranje-Nassau for his contributions to scholarship. The scholarly journal Quaerendo published a special issue in his honour in 2003. ==Selected publications== ;Authored books * Bat Books: A Catalogue of Folded Manuscripts Containing Almanacs or Other Texts (Turnhout, Brepols, 2016). * Illustrated Inventory of Medieval Manuscripts in Latin Script in the Netherlands (Hilversum, Verloren, 2009\u20132011). * The Dutch and Their Books in the Manuscript Age.
