In 2011, the College reached its highest enrollment of 6,097 students. Prior to consolidation with Albany State University, the college offered 84 two-year transfer and career associate degrees, 4 four-year baccalaureate degrees, and 49 certificate programs. == History == The institution was founded as Albany Junior College in 1963 and offered its first classes in 1966. In 1987, a committee of faculty, staff, students and community members chose the name Darton College as part of its reclassification as a state college. \"Darton\" is an Old English word probably meaning \"town by the (River) Dearne,\" which refers to Albany's location on the Flint River. In November 2015, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia announced the consolidation of Albany State University and Darton State College and appointed Dr. Arthur Dunning as President of the University. The new combined institutions assumed the name and branding of Albany State University. The Darton campus became Albany State University West Campus and the location of the university's Darton College of Health Professions. The merger of the two institutions greatly decreased the combined enrollment. Fall 2013 enrollments were 6,195 for Darton State College and 4,260 for Albany State Universityhttp://www.usg.edu/assets/research/documents/enrollment_reports/SER_Fall_2013_Final.pdf while Fall 2017 enrollments for the new combined Albany State University were 6,615.http://www.usg.edu/assets/usg/docs/news_files/BOR_USG_Fall_2017_Enrollment_Report.pdf This represents a 27% decrease over that period. == Campus == The 186 acre campus on Albany's western edge included a 470-seat theater, library, fitness center, computer labs, and sports facilities such as tennis and racquetball courts, indoor swimming pool, indoor bowling alley and climbing wall, with surrounding nature trails, soccer fields, ball fields, and pecan trees. == Student population == At one time, Darton College enrolled more than half of the area's high school graduates and approximately 45% of the students were from Dougherty County.
