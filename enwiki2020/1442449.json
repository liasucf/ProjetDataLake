    "text": "In Peru, the people directly elect a head of state (the president) as well as a legislature. The president is elected by the people for a five-year term. The unicameral Congress (Congreso) has 130 members, also elected for a five- year term by proportional representation. Peru has a multi-party system, which effectively bars one party from becoming the sole influence in a decision- making process. As such, parties must work with one another to form coalition governments. The whole election process is held by the National Jury of Elections and the National Office of Electoral Processes. Peru has compulsory voting. ==Schedule== ===Election=== {|class=wikitable style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !Position !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 !! 2021 |- !Type | Presidential (April & June) National Congress (April) Gubernatorial (April & June)||colspan=4|None|| Presidential (April & June) National Congress (April) Gubernatorial (April & June) |- !President and vice president |President and vice president ||colspan=4|None ||President and vice president |- !National Congress |All seats ||colspan=4|None ||All seats |- !Provinces, cities and municipalities |All positions ||colspan=4|None ||All positions |} ===Inauguration=== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Position !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 !! 2021 |- !Type | Presidential (May) National Congress (May) Gubernatorial (May)||colspan=4|None|| Presidential (May) National Congress (May) Gubernatorial (May) |- !President and vice president |28 July ||colspan=4|None ||28 July |- !National Congress |28 July ||colspan=4|None ||28 July |- !Provinces, cities and municipalities |28 July ||colspan=4|None ||28 July |} ==Latest elections== ===Presidential election=== ===Parliamentary election=== ==Laws== * Sale of alcohol and carrying firearmes (except for Members of the Armed Forces and the National Police) are forbidden during an election. * Political gatherings are forbidden, while public gatherings of any sort are prohibited during voting hours, including religious liturgies and entertainment shows.
