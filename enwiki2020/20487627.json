It has broadcast on Channel 19 in Watertown since August 2008.http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2008/db0807/DOC-284364A1.pdf WTKJ was originally a low-power independent in Philadelphia, New York; the station was sold by Tammy M. Celenza in June 2007 to EICB TV for $7,000.http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6452452.html In 2017, WTKJ was transferred to Edge Spectrum, a company that seeks to use upcoming ATSC 3.0 standards to datacast via low-power UHF stations such as WTKJ. == Digital transition == As a low-power station, WTKJ-LP was not required to transition to digital broadcasting when full-power stations do so in 2009. It has voluntarily applied to flash-cut to digital operation on its existing frequency, UHF 19, with 1500 watts but has not yet made this transition. WTKJ may be subject to co-channel interference by adjacent-market WSYT-DT 19 Syracuse as that station goes to its full licensed digital power, having abandoned former analogue channel UHF 68 in Syracuse, New York. == References == == External links == * * TVfool coverage map for WTKJ-LP 19 Watertown * TVfool coverage for co-channel WSYT-DT 19 Syracuse TKJ-LP ",
