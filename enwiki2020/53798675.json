Sunrise at Greenwich Point ==History== The area of land that is now Greenwich Point was first used by the Sinawoy Indians as a fishing camp during the summer months. The Sinawoy Indians called the land Monakewego, meaning \u201cshining sands.\u201d In 1640, Captain Daniel Patrick and Robert and Elizabeth Feake purchased the land from the Indians for 25 coats and some small trinkets. The area came to be known as Elizabeth\u2019s Neck due to her love for the island, and she lived nearby in the Feake-Ferris House (c. 1645). In 1730, a member of the Ferris family bought the land. The family retained ownership over the land for more than 150 years. In the 1880s, the banker and railroad tycoon John Kennedy Todd purchased the land. Tod called his waterfront estate \u201cInnis Arden\u201d and constructed a causeway to provide access to the main land. Tod also constructed a lake from a tidal marsh and built a road around this lake. He erected a stone mansion, boat house, guest cottage, and several other buildings on his land. Many of these buildings are still in use today by the town. Tod also built a nine-hole golf course. Tod originally opened his property and golf course to Old Greenwich residents and guests staying at local inns. Eventually, he came to believe that his hospitality was being abused, so Tod closed the point to everyone but his invited guests. Tod died in 1925 and his wife, Marie Howard Potter Tod, died in 1939. The Tods had no heirs, so Tod willed the property to the Presbyterian Hospital of New York. The Hospital used the land as a retreat for nurses until World War II began. On December 13, 1944, the Trustees of Presbyterian Hospital sold the 148.5-acre property to the Town of Greenwich for $550,000. In 1946, Tod\u2019s stone mansion was converted into 13 family apartments for veterans returning from World War II. These apartments were used until 1961, when the mansion was demolished due to it falling into disrepair. ==Policies== Greenwich Point is open daily from 6:00 a.m. until sunset.
