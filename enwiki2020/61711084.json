    "text": "The Xixime were an indigenous people who inhabited a portion of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains in the present day states of Durango and Sinaloa, Mexico. The Xixime are noted for their reported practice of cannibalism and resistance to Spanish colonization in the form of the Xixime Rebellion of 1610. == Language == The Xixime spoke Xixime, a poorly documented, now-extinct Uto-Aztecan language. Dialects of Xixime included Hine and Hume (to the north and south of the Xixime territory, respectively). The exact classification of the language is unknown although it may belong to the Taracahitic branch. == Cannibalism == A considerable amount of the scholarship and media attention devoted to the Xixime has focused on the group's reported practice of cannibalism. While a variety colonial Spanish accounts of the Xixime report the culture engaged in frequent, ritual consumption of enemy peoples, the historical accuracy of the allegations is disputed. A number of historians including Susan M. Deeds apply theories developed by Gananath Obeyesekere on Aztec sacrifice to suggest that the practice of cannibalism was \"exaggerated or contrived\" by the Xixime to intimidate their Spanish enemies. In 2011 Jos\u00e9 Luis Punzo argued that newly discovered bones from Cueva del Mague, Durango constituted proof of the practice, citing evidence of \"boiling and defleshing.\" == Relationship with the Spanish == === Impressions === Conquistador Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n first documented the existence of the Xixime via reports collected by scouts during a 1530 expedition. In comparison with their neighbors, the Xiximes were regarded as relatively civilized by the Spanish given their urban settlements and stone buildings. === Xixime Rebellion of 1610 === Map of approximate Xixime and Acaxee territories Despite initially tolerating the presence of Spanish missions in neighboring territories, the Xiximes, in 1610, began organizing violent resistance to colonial incursions. The Xiximes solicited help from the Acaxees (their northern neighbors and historical enemies) and Tepehu\u00e1n arguing that Jesuit churches were \"temples of disease\" and that destroying them would bring immortality. In response to Acaxee unwillingness to cooperate in anti-Spanish rebellion, the Xiximes began organizing attacks on Acaxee villages. Francisco de Urdi\u00f1ola To fend off the attacks, the Acaxee requested protection from the Spanish. In response, Francisco de Urdi\u00f1ola attempted to secure peace through diplomatic means, though such efforts were spurned by the Xiximes. Aided by 200 Spanish soldiers and 1,100 indigenous allies, Urdi\u00f1ola attempted to quell the Acaxee-led. By October, the surrender of key rebel leaders had effectively ended the uprising. === Tepehu\u00e1n Revolt === The Tepehu\u00e1n Revolt of 1616, which proved significantly harder to contain than the Xixime Rebellion, enjoyed widespread Xixime support. == References == Category:Indigenous peoples of Aridoamerica Category:Indigenous peoples in Mexico Category:Extinct ethnic groups Category:Cannibalism in North America ",
