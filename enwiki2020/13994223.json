    "text": "The DAF 33 is a compact saloon car produced by the DAF company of Eindhoven, in the Netherlands between 1967 and 1974. Outwardly and technically it differed little from its predecessor, the DAF Daffodil. 1966 had seen the introduction of the Michelotti styled DAF 44 which appeared to compete in virtually the same market segment as the Daffodil-based design; but the 33, its development costs presumably long since amortised, remained in production with its new name. A more luxurious version became available in 1969. Thereafter the car changed very little: however, the 6 volt electrical system was replaced with a 12 volt one in 1972. The DAF 33, in common with other DAF cars, featured a continuously variable transmission system, the DAF Variomatic. == References == == External links == * Daf 33 estate 33 Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Cars powered by boxer engines Category:Sedans Category:Vans Category:1960s cars Category:1970s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1967 Category:Vehicles with CVT transmission Category:VDL Nedcar vehicles ",
