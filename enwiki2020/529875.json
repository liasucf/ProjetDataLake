    "text": "Jesuit High School is a private, non-profit, Catholic college-preparatory high school (grades 8-12) for boys run by the USA Central and Southern Province of the Society of Jesus in Mid-City New Orleans Louisiana. The school was founded in 1847 by the Jesuits and serves students of all religious faiths. ==Description== The mission of Jesuit High School as a Catholic, college preparatory school is to develop in its students the competence, conscience, and compassion that will enable them to be men of faith and men for others. A service program is an integral part of the Jesuit High experience. More than 99% of graduates go on to colleges and universities. Jesuit ranks among the top private schools in the nation in number of National Merit semifinalists. Of the 286 seniors in the Class of 2018, 35 of them were named National Merit Semifinalists and eight were named in the National Hispanic Recognition Program. Selective admission to Jesuit is based on previous academic performance, recommendations of teachers, principals, and/or church parish pastors, promise of future development, and the desire of the student to profit from the moral, spiritual, academic, and physical programs offered by the school. In the long history of the school, no student has been refused admission because his family could not afford to pay all or part of the tuition. For students who qualify for admission, but whose families cannot afford the tuition, Jesuit has a generous financial assistance program. In the 2012\u201313 academic year, Jesuit provided families with more than $650,000 in tuition assistance, based on financial need only. Jesuit does not award academic or athletic scholarships. Tuition is near the lowest among private schools in the New Orleans area, $9,150 in 2017\u20132018. Fees are assessed for retreats ($6\u2013$100, varies by grade), for computer class ($50), and for graduation ($100). In 1967, Jesuit became the first high school in the country to have a Marine Corps Junior ROTC program. For several years this program was mandatory for all students; the combination of Jesuit priests and Marine Corps JROTC instructors made the school's disciplinary system unique among American high schools. Guest speakers at Assembly have included alumnus Jay Thomas, authors Pat Conroy, Tony Hillerman, Sister Helen Prejean, Orson Scott Card, Dana Gioia, and Chaim Potok, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin, mayor and alumnus Marc Morial, actor Jim Caviezel, theologian George Weigel, environmental activist Luke Fontana, Jesuit Superior General Peter Hans Kolvenbach, ESPN announcer Mike Tirico, theologian and U.S. Ambassador Michael Novak, and President William Howard Taft. More recently, David F. Dixon is one of the very few non-alumni guest speakers invited to address students at Assembly. ==History== The College of the Immaculate Conception was founded in 1847 and opened in 1849. It was both a secondary school and college, and both were located in the Faubourg Ste. Marie of New Orleans (now the New Orleans Central Business District), a block upriver from the French Quarter, at the corner of Baronne and Common Streets. In 1911, the high school and college divisions were split, and the college division relocated to St. Charles Avenue, eventually becoming Loyola University New Orleans. The high school remained on Baronne Street until 1926, when it was moved to its current location at 4133 Banks Street in Mid-City. The Church of the Immaculate ConceptionImmaculate Conception Church, New Orleans, LA. Neworleanschurches.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-28. remains on the original campus and plays an active role in the Jesuit community. Since 1926, several additions have been made to the campus. In 1953 a wing was added along Palmyra Street; the addition included an auditorium, the Chapel of the North American Martyrs, a cafeteria, a library, several classrooms, and a band room. With the additions made to the school, the building, coincidentally, is now in the shape of a \"J\" when looking from a bird's eye view. In recent times, Fr. Raymond Fitzgerald, S.J., (class of 1976) served as school president and was succeeded by Fr. Anthony McGinn, S.J. In May 2015 it was announced that Fr. Chris Fronk, S.J., on active duty as a U.S. Navy chaplain, would serve as the school's 30th president, and he assumed office in November 2016.Fronk In January 2020, Fr. Chris Fronk, S.J. stepped down from school president. Fr. John Brown, S.J. is currently the interim president. The principal is Peter Kernion (Class of 1990). ===Mascot=== The mascot is a blue jay posed with his fists raised, designed by cartoonist Walt Kelly of Pogo fame. A contest among students was held to name the mascot, and the name \"Jayson\" won. The school's colors are blue and white to honor the Virgin Mary. Student athletes wore a white sweater with a blue letter \"J\" on it and were referred to as the \"Blue Js\", hence the mascot. As with most Jesuit schools, the school's motto is Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam (\"For the Greater Glory of God\").

The 1946 athletic year yielded undefeated state champions in baseball, basketball, track and field, and football all coached by G. Gernon Brown.New Orleans Times-Picayune, July 20, 2003 It has been said that Jesuit had \"All the Tricks in '46.\" In the 2004\u20132005 school year, Jesuit won state championships in baseball, cross country, soccer, tennis, wrestling, rugby, and swimming, and went to the state playoffs in football with an undefeated regular season. In 2012 Jesuit built Ryan stadium, a state of the art facility accommodating football, baseball, and soccer on a field covered entirely with artificial turf. In 2015, Jesuit was the first prep school in the States to get a germ- zapping robot, gift of an alumnus. Cross country: In 2005, Jesuit became the first 5A school in Louisiana history to win three state championships in a row in the sport of cross country. In 2006 they continued with an unprecedented 4th cross country state championship. Swimming: Jesuit swimming holds the LHSAA record for most consecutive state championships in any sport, with 18 straight. As of November 20, 2010, Jesuit Swimming has captured 36 state championships. The streak was broken in 2005 when the team, still feeling the effects of Hurricane Katrina, was only able to field 12 swimmers, yet managed to take second place, only a few points out of first. In 2006, however, the team was able to recapture the state championship. Wrestling: In wrestling within the state of Louisiana, Jesuit's rival Holy Cross was the perennial state champs under Br. Melchior Polowy in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Then in 1969 Jesuit hired Surachai \"Sam\" Harnsongkram as its new wrestling coach. In 1972 the Jesuit High School Blue Jays won the first of 18 State Championships under Coach Sam, including 11 in a row from 1988\u20131998. Prior to that 1972 win, Jesuit's only state championship was in 1951. And since that string-of-11 (ending in 1998) Jesuit has won 4 more state wrestling championships, with the last being in 2009. High School wrestling in Louisiana has become much more visible starting in the 1990s, resulting in other schools developing programs to challenge the \"leaders\". From 1999-til-2015, Jesuit has won 4 more state championships, and has been runner-up in the other years. Baseball: From 2007-09 Jesuit made it to the state tournament three times, and twice to the American Legion playoffs winning one championship. In August 2012, Jesuit's baseball team won the American Legion World Series. Jesuit's American Legion teams also won the national championship in 1946 and 1960. Football: In football, Jesuit High School vs. Holy Cross High School is the oldest continuous high school rivalry in Louisiana and one of the oldest continuous high school football rivalries in the United States. The first game was played in 1922 (Jesuit won by 52\u20130) and the two teams have played every year since (twice in 1963: once in regular season and another time for the state crown which Holy Cross won) Blue Jays vs. Tigers. The Jesuit Blue Jays Football team went to the State Championship for the 2014 season and played against the John Curtis Patriots and for the first time since 1978 against St. Augustine. Jesuit defeated John Curtis 17\u201314 to win the Division 1 state championship. Running back Charles Jackson was voted the game's most valuable player. Basketball: In February 1965, Jesuit's all-white basketball team played a secret game against St. Augustine, the city's all-male, all-black high school. The Purple Knights won the game, which was the basis for the 1999 motion picture Passing Glory. That same year, Jesuit won the 1965 Louisiana High School Athletic Association state championship in Class AAA (at the time the state's highest classification) while St. Augustine won the championship of the Louisiana Interscholastic and Literary Organization, the sanctioning body for the state's black schools. In the fall of 1967, St. Augustine joined the LHSAA and became a rival for the Blue Jays in the New Orleans Catholic League through the 2010\u201311 school year, when the Purple Knights were reclassified Class 4A by the LHSAA. Soccer: In the 1998\u20131999 season, 2006\u20132007 season, 2008\u20132009 season, and also the 2009\u20132010 season, Jesuit fielded one of the best soccer teams in the nation, winning the Louisiana state title and in all four cases ending the season undefeated. This record gave the Jesuit team a #3 (1998\u201399), a #2 (2006\u20132007), a #1 (2008\u20132009), and a #3 (2009\u20132010) rank in the nation. The 2006\u20132007 team is considered the best high school soccer team in LHSAA history. In the three seasons from 2009\u20132011, the soccer team had a 94-game unbeaten streak, which is the fourth longest unbeaten streak in the country. Rugby: In the 2007\u20132008 season, the rugby team won the State Championship for the sixth consecutive year with an undefeated season, only allowing 12 points while scoring over 300. Because of a conflict with the senior prom, the team was forced to play in the more difficult multi-school division at the Southern Regionals in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The team swept regionals and moved on to become 8th in the country in the multi-school division at the USA Rugby Boys High School National Championship. In 2017, the Blue Jays reclaimed the State Championship, winning the title for the first time since 2011, with an overtime victory over the Bayou Hurricanes, 25\u201322. In 2018, the Blue Jays remained the State Champions with a victory over the Brother Martin Crusaders, 22\u201312. Lacrosse: In 2014, Jesuit New Orleans won the 2014 Allstate Sugar Bowl Lacrosse Classic, with 14 schools competing from Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. Golf: Jesuit won the state championship twice in the late 1990s. Rear view of Jesuit from corner of Banks & S. Solomon ==Hurricane Katrina== When the flooding following Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, Jesuit High School was inundated, five feet (1.5 m) of water ruining the ground floor. When the school announced that it was closed indefinitely, many students enrolled in schools in cities to which they had evacuated. The largest concentration of students attended a satellite school at Strake Jesuit College Preparatory in Houston; at one point, approximately 420 displaced students attended classes at night with their own teachers and classmates. In mid-October, Jesuit opened another satellite school at St. Martin's Episcopal School in Metairie in unincorporated Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, which about 500 students attended until Thanksgiving. After Thanksgiving, Jesuit's students and faculty returned to their own campus, becoming the first flooded school in New Orleans to reopen \u2013 albeit with an unusable first floor. The school held its annual Thanksgiving Drive for the poor living in the surrounding neighborhoods. On 23 January 2006, 1285 of the 1450 students returned to attend Jesuit for the second semester. After the Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017, Jesuit hosted students from Colegio San Ignacio in Puerto Rico. ==Notable alumni== In chronological order: *Edward Douglass White (Class of 1865), Chief Justice of the United States *Larry Gilbert (Class of 1910), MLB player (Boston Braves) *F.
