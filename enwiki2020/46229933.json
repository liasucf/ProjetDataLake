She joined the Revolution in 1910 as a propagandist. She joined the Mexican Revolution supporting Francisco I. Madero, but on his assassination in 1913, joined the anti-Huerta Women's Loyalty Club, participating in demonstrations distributing propaganda for the Constitutionalists with Mar\u00eda Arias Bernal. That same year, her sister Concepci\u00f3n also joined the Revolutionary forces. \u00c1lvarez, working with Arias Bernal, Eulalia Guzm\u00e1n, and Dolores Sotomayor founded the Corregidor de Quer\u00e9taro Vocational School to help women improve their economic circumstances. In 1914, Carranza appointed \u00c1lvarez as the private governess and teacher of his children. After the overthrow of Huerta, Carranza gave \u00c1lvarez several commissions to interview revolutionary leaders in various states. Carranza also traveled with a group of teachers and professionals who he trusted to reform and reconstruct society by way of education and propaganda. He sent 44 teachers to Puebla, 27 to Quer\u00e9taro, 4 to Tabasco, 20 to Yucat\u00e1n, 5 to disseminate propaganda to General Obregon's army, and 27 teachers traveled with him. \u00c1lvarez was part of the group accompanying Carranza to Veracruz. In 1916, she was honored with a diploma for her revolutionary merit. \u00c1lvarez founded the Confederaci\u00f3n Femenil Mexicana (Mexican Women's Confederation). In the creation of the Mexican Women's Confederation in 1931 the communist women, including Cuca Garc\u00eda and Concha Michel were vocal about exploitation. They wanted measures to counter exploitation of Mexican women, including their access to education, free agency placements, restaurants for employees and workers, communal housing, health care for workers, a legal department, to female attendants, and protectionist laws.
