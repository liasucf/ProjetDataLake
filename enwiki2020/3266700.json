    "text": "Rhondda () was a local government district in the geographical area of the Rhondda Valley, south Wales. The district was initially created as Ystradyfodwg Local Government District from parts of Ystradyfodwg, Llanwonno and Llantrisant parishes, Glamorgan, in 1877, when the Local Government Act 1858 was adopted. A local board was formed to govern the area. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the area as Ystradyfodwg Urban District, with an elected urban district council replacing the local board. It was renamed Rhondda Urban District in 1897 after the River Rhondda. In 1955 Rhondda received a charter of incorporation to become the Municipal Borough of Rhondda.Archives Network Wales The Local Government Act 1972 completely reorganised local government in Wales in 1974. The Borough of Rhondda, with an identical area to the municipal borough, was one of six local government districts of the new county of Mid Glamorgan from 1974 to 1996. The borough was abolished in 1996, with its area passing to the unitary Rhondda Cynon Taf county borough. ==Coat of arms== On incorporation in 1955, the borough was granted a coat of arms. the blazon was as follows:Geoffrey Briggs, Civic and Corporate Heraldry, London, 1972 Vert a pall wavy argent on a chief indented sable a balance between two acorns leaved and slipped Or, and for a Crest out of a mural crown Sable a demi-dragon gules gorged with a riband pendant therefrom an escutcheon Or charged with three chevrons of the second and supporting a torch erect of the first enflamed proper. Supporters: On either side a sea-dragon sable the tail proper gorged with a collar checky argent and azure. In 1974 the arms were transferred to the Rhondda Borough Council.The Local Authorities (Armorial Bearings) Order 1974 (S.I. 1974/869) The shield was an heraldic map of the borough, with the white wavy \"pall\" depicting the confluence of the Rhondda Fach and Rhondda Fawr rivers. The indented edge of the \"chief\" or upper third of the shield represented the mountainous nature of the valley. The chief was coloured black symbolising coal-mining. On this were placed symbols in gold: acorns for the growth of new industries and a balance for balanced development. The crest featured a mural or walled crown symbolic of local government. From this rose the red dragon of Wales. The dragon supported a flaming torch for coal and allied industries. around the dragon's neck hung a shield bearing three chevrons, from the arms of the de Clares, Lords of Glamorgan. These formed the basis of the arms of both Glamorgan and Mid Glamorgan County Councils. The supporters were black sea-dragons, for Welsh sea-coal. Around their necks were silver and blue chequered collars. These were derived from the arms of the Marquess of Bute. The third Marquess was responsible for the initial exploitation of the coal reserves of the valley. == References == Category:1877 establishments in Wales Rhondda Category:Mid Glamorgan Category:Local Government Districts created by the Local Government Act 1858 Category:Rhondda Valley de:Rhondda ",
