    "text": "Sol Tax (30 October 1907 \u2013 4 January 1995) was an American anthropologist. He is best known for creating action anthropology and his studies of the Meskwaki, or Fox, Indians, for \"action-anthropological\" research titled the Fox Project, and for founding the academic journal Current Anthropology. He received his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1935 and, together with Fred Eggan, was a student of Alfred Radcliffe-Brown. Tax grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. During his formative years he was involved in a number of social clubs. Among these was the Newsboys Republic with which his first encounter was when he was \"arrested\" for breaking their rules. Tax began his undergraduate education at the University of Chicago but had to leave for lack of funds. He returned to school at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, where he studied with Ralph Linton. He later taught at the University of Chicago. Tax was a mentor to noted anthropologist Joan Ablon at the University of Chicago. He was the main organizer for the 1959 Darwin Centennial Celebration held at the University of Chicago. He was an organizer, along with the National Congress of American Indians, including Native American organizer Willard LaMere, of the 1961 American Indian Chicago Conference. He assisted in authoring the resulting Statement of Indian Purpose, the first major statement of the policy of tribal self-determination. The American Anthropological Association presented to him and Bela Maday its Franz Boas award for exemplary service to anthropology in 1977. He was the association's president in 1959. ==Action Anthropology== Sol Tax is known as a founder of \"Action Anthropology\", a school of anthropological thought that forwent the traditional doctrine of non-interference in favor of co-equal goals of \"learning and helping\" from studied cultures. ==Works== *(1937, revised 1955) contributions to Social Anthropology of North American Tribes, ed. by Fred Eggan.
