    "text": "The 2010 United States Senate election in Kentucky took place on November 2, 2010 alongside other elections to the United States Senate in other states as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Primaries for each respective party were held on May 18, 2010. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Jim Bunning decided to retire instead of seeking a third term. Republican nominee Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist and son of Congressman Ron Paul, won the open seat against Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway. == Bunning's controversies == In early 2009, incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Jim Bunning, who won reelection by a surprisingly narrow margin in 2004 said he would need to raise $10 million for his re-election campaign.\"U.S. Senator Jim Bunning to run in 2010, needs $10 million\", Fox/WDRB. Retrieved February 24, 2009. However, National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman John Cornyn pressured Bunning to retire due to concerns that he could lose a re-election bid. In July 2009, Bunning announced he would not run for re-election. In February 2009, Senator Bunning stated that another justice could soon be appointed to the United States Supreme Court because Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, would be dead within nine months, creating a significant amount of controversy, which resulted in an apology from Bunning. In late May 2009, Bunning called fellow Kentucky Senator and Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell a \"control freak\" and suggested that he did not need McConnell's endorsement. He also challenged Lexington Herald Leader editor John Stamper to an arm wrestling match over a question of being \"fit to serve.\" Additionally, Bunning created further controversy in February 2010 when he objected to a proposal of unanimous consent for an extension of unemployment insurance, COBRA, and other federal programs, citing that this extension was not pay-as-you-go. He proposed an amendment which sought to find the funds to pay for the bill from the Stimulus Bill of 2009, and declared that he supported the unemployed, but that a bill such as this only added to the growing deficit and that it should be paid for immediately. Senator Bob Corker joined Bunning, while other senators worked to cease his objections. When Senator Jeff Merkley urged him to drop his objections to vote on a 30-day extension of benefits, Bunning responded \"tough shit.\"Politico, Jim Bunning repeatedly block unemployment extension, February 25, 2010, http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0210/33566.html Bunning finally agreed to end his objection to the bill in exchange for a vote on his amendment to pay for the package. It failed 53\u201343 on a procedural vote. The extension of unemployment benefits then passed by a vote of 78\u201319. == Republican primary == === Candidates === * Rand Paul, ophthalmologist * Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky * Gurley L.

Scribner, businessman * John Stephenson, former Kentucky Superintendent of Public Education === Campaign === On August 20, 2009, a grassroots-planned moneybomb raised $433,509 for Rand Paul's campaign in a 24-hour period.\"RandPaulGraphs.com \u2013 Donation meter for August 20, 2009\", www.randpaulgraphs.com August 21, 2009 According to Paul, this set a new record in Kentucky's political fundraising history (for a 24-hour period). Republican Liberty Caucus endorsed Paul in November 2009.Republican Liberty Caucus. Republican Liberty Caucus Endorses Rand Paul, Peter Schiff... November 10, 2009 On December 22, 2009, Rand Paul picked up the endorsement of Concerned Women for America.\"Women 4 Rand\" , December 22, 2009 Paul embraced the Tea Party movement, and promoted \"small government principles\" one day after he officially entered the race for Kentucky's open seat. Paul ran a strong anti-Washington message. One commercial tied Grayson as part of the problem, noting that Grayson raised money with AIG executives in Washington. In another advertisement, Paul had also attacked Grayson as a career politician and a liar. Grayson created a new website that attacked Paul for his \"strange ideas,\" such as his opposition of the PATRIOT Act, and what Grayson alleged to be his support of closing down Guantanamo Bay and saying that Iran was not a threat. He also attacked Paul for being a Duke University fan. He sent out another TV ad and web video that stirred controversy by making the case that Paul believes that foreign policy decisions made prior to September 11, 2001 are partially to blame for the attacks. Paul immediately responded by launching a statewide television ad in which he expresses his \"outrage at terrorists who killed 3,000 innocents\" before accusing Grayson of a \"lie\" and a \"shameful\" tactic. Grayson accused the Fox News Channel of favoring Paul over him. On May 18, 2010, Paul won the Republican nomination. After conceding the election to Paul, Grayson said, \"It's time to put all differences aside, unite behind Dr. Paul, he needs our help and I for one stand ready to serve\".Cate Slattery.

Due to Conway's large margin of victory in his statewide campaign for attorney general, his fundraising ability, and the age difference between Conway and Bunning, Conway was described as a viable candidate. Both candidates were against the Senate version of the Affordable Care Act. When Mongiardo said that \"it was time to start over,\" he was criticized by Conway and labeled \"Dr. No.\" Both candidates supported the final version. Attorney General Conway refused to join a lawsuit claiming that health care reform is unconstitutional. On May 18, 2010, Conway won the Democratic nomination. === Endorsements === {| class=\"navbox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text- align:left; border:0; margin-top:0.2em\" |- ! style=\"background:#cff; font- weight:normal\" | ;List of individuals and organizations endorsing Jack Conway |- | style=\"border:solid 1px silver; padding:8px; background:white\" | * U.S. Congressmen Ben Chandler * U.S. Congressman John Yarmuth * Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives Greg Stumbo * Kentucky Finance/Administration Cabinet Secretary Jonathan Miller * Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson * Former U.S. Senator and former Governor of Kentucky Wendell Ford * Former Governor of Kentucky John Brown * Kentucky State Auditor Crit Luallen * The Courier-Journal * The Kentucky Enquirer * Lexington Herald- Leader |} {| class=\"navbox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:left; border:0; margin-top:0.2em\" |- ! style=\"background:#cff; font-weight:normal\" | ;List of individuals and organizations endorsing Daniel Mongiardo |- | style=\"border:solid 1px silver; padding:8px; background:white\" | * Governor Steve Beshear * State Senator and former Governor Julian Carroll * State Senator Perry Clark * State Senator Denise Harper-Angel * State Senator Walter Blevins * State Senator Tim Shaughnessy * State Senator Gerald Neal * Former State Senator David Karem |} === Polling === {| class=\"navbox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:left; border:0; margin-top:0.2em\" |- ! style=\"background:#cff; font-weight:normal\" | ;List of Democratic primary polling numbers |- | style=\"border:solid 1px silver; padding:8px; background:white\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- valign=top !

The county carried by Darlene Price is in brown. The counties carried by Dan Mongiardo are in blue. The counties carried by Jack Conway are in yellow. The primary race was extremely close with Conway narrowly prevailing by just over 4,000 votes. The race remained in doubt for much of the night. Finally with 99% of the vote counted the Associated Press declared Conway the winner. Mongiardo called Conway to concede at 10:08 P.M. EST. Mongiardo congratulated Conway and pledged him his full support for the general election. In terms of the break down of the results, Conway ran up margins in Jefferson County home of Louisville, and Fayette County home of Lexington. In terms of more rural counties Mongiardo and Conway split the vote. Conway performed well in central Kentucky, while Mongiardo performed well in coal country in east Kentucky and farm country in western Kentucky. In the end Conway's performance in the states most populated county, Jefferson County proved to be just enough to carry him to victory. The primary race was also notable because both Conway and Mongiardo received more votes than Republican Rand Paul. == General election == === Candidates === * Rand Paul (R), ophthalmologist and political activist * Jack Conway (D), Attorney General * Billy Ray Wilson (independent write-in) Kentucky's ballot access requirements allow Republicans and Democrats to run for office with two signatures, but require minor parties and independents to collect at least 5,000 signatures. The filing deadline for minor party and independent candidates was on August 10, and no candidate filed. Some speculate that the reason why no minor party or independent candidate filed is because Paul's candidacy helped discourage it. The Libertarian Party of Kentucky held its nominating convention for 2010 elections and failed to nominate a candidate for the U.S. Senate, as no one stepped forward to seek nomination to that office. Despite comments from some observers that Paul espouses libertarian beliefs, the Kentucky Libertarian Party issued an official press release stating \"Rand Paul is not a libertarian\" and detailing the differences between Paul's beliefs and libertarian principles. Similarly, the Constitution Party of Kentucky avoided the Senate race ostensibly because of Rand Paul's presence in that race and perhaps because of his more minarchist stance than Trey Grayson, especially if the latter had been the nominee. Billy Ray Wilson, an independent of London, filed as a write-in candidate.Candidate Filings with the Office of the Secretary of State Kentucky Secretary of State === Campaign === Conway began the race trailing Paul, but as he attacked his opponent's positions on social- welfare and criminal-justice policies, the polls began to tighten. Conway agreed to run an advertisement that linked Paul's policy stances to a college prank in which Paul reportedly demanded that a female classmate worship a bong named \"Aqua Buddha.\" Independent political analysts in Kentucky quickly warned that Conway would regret his decision. The ad's focus on religion led critics, including not just Republicans but also some liberals such as Hardball's Chris Matthews, to charge that Conway was improperly questioning Paul's faith, to which Conway countered that the ad was intended to question Paul's \"judgment.\" Nonetheless, Conway swiftly dropped again in the polls, a decline from which he never recovered. Conway ceased his defense of the commercial after the election, admitting that running it had been a mistake; he claimed that he had done so only reluctantly at the urging of national advisers despite finding it \"harsh as mule's breath.\" Conway saw one last opportunity before his final debate with Paul. One of Rand Paul's supporters stomped on a MoveOn activist after she approached Paul's vehicle, and a video of the event was later used in a Conway TV commercial. Paul and Conway condemned the attack and the supporter was banned from campaign events. The campaign attracted $8.5 million in contributions from outside groups, of which $6 million was spent to help Rand Paul and $2.5 million to help Conway. This money influx was in addition to the money spent by the candidates themselves: $6 million by Paul and $4.7 million by Conway. Paul was endorsed by The Kentucky Enquirer, The Richmond Register, and the Bowling Green Daily News; as well as by the National Federation of Independent Business,\"National Federation of Independent Business Endorses Dr. Rand Paul\" , September 23, 2010 Council for Citizens Against Government Waste,\"Council For Citizens Against Government Waste Endorses Dr. Rand Paul\" , September 23, 2010 National Right to Life,\"National Right to Life Endorses Rand Paul\" , September 17, 2010 US Chamber of Commerce,\"US Chamber of Commerce Endorses Rand Paul\" , September 15, 2010 National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition,\"Rand Paul Receives Endorsement of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition\", September 9, 2010 Mike Huckabee,\"Governor Mike Huckabee and Huck Pac Endorse Rand Paul for U.S. Senate in Kentucky\", September 16, 2010 and Tony Perkins/FRC Action PAC. Conway was endorsed by the Courier-Journal and the Lexington Herald Leader. === Debates === Rand Paul and Jack Conway debate, October 2010 There were 5 televised debates between the two candidates. The first debate on October 3, 2010, which was moderated by Chris Wallace, seemed to focus on President Obama's decisions during his 2 years as President. Paul stated, \"I think his agenda is wrong for America. I will stand up against President Obama's agenda.\" Conway responded, \"I am a proud Democrat. I'm certainly not going to be on the left of Barack Obama.\" At the time of the debate, the election's polls indicated the race was a dead heat. === Predictions === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
