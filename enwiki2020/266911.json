    "text": "The 2003-2010 logo for Northwest Airlink. Northwest Airlink was the trade name of Northwest Airlines' regional airline service, which flew turboprop and regional jet aircraft from Northwest's domestic hubs in Minneapolis, Detroit, and Memphis. Service was primarily to small-to-medium-sized cities and towns where larger aircraft might not be economical to operate and also to larger markets to either provide additional capacity or more frequent flights than could be justified using mainline aircraft. Beginning in July 2009, the Northwest Airlink trade name was phased out, and replaced by the Delta Connection trade name for Delta Air Lines as part of the Delta/Northwest merger. == History == Northwest Airlink was formed in December 1984 when Northwest Airlines took steps to enhance its domestic services by entering a marketing agreement with Mesaba Airlines. Mesaba at the time was the dominant airline serving Minneapolis/St Paul at the time. Under the agreement, Mesaba would operate as Northwest Orient Airlink. Mesaba initially operated commuter and regional turboprop aircraft. The Mesaba fleet at this time comprised fourteen Beechcraft 99 and one Fokker F27 Friendship aircraft. In 1985 Big Sky Airlines entered the Northwest Airlink agreement with 8-18 passenger seat aircraft including British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 and Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner commuter propjets.https://www.airliners.net, photos of Northwest Airlink / Big Sky Airlines aircraft Another Northwest Airlink operator was Fischer Brothers Aviation flying CASA C-212 commuter turboprops.http://www.airliners.net, photos of Northwest Airlink / Fischer Brothers aircraft An Official Airline Guide (OAG) flight schedule dated February 1994 lists the following commuter and regional air carriers operating Northwest Airlink service:Feb. 1994 OAG Pocket Flight Guide, North American Edition * Express Airlines I * Express Airlines II * Mesaba Airlines * Northeast Express Regional Airlines * Precision Airlines In 2001, Pacific Island Aviation was operating Northwest Airlink service with Short 360 commuter turboprop aircraft between Guam, Saipan and Tinian.http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 1, 2001 Pacific Islands Aviation/Northwest Airlink timetable Northwest Jetlink was subsequently formed to operate services with Avro RJ85 jets flown by Mesaba Airlines.

The plane descended struck the tops of trees and then two ridges and came to rest inverted on its right side. All 18 occupants (16 passengers and 2 crew) died.
