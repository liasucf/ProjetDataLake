Around the same time, Frijj was the main sponsor of ill fated dating show Elimidate hosted by ex Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona; the sponsorship of the show ceased at the end of its run in 2003. In 1993, Frijj was advertised on television, with a series of stop-motion animation adverts made by 3 Peach Animation, which featured bizarre cows,\"\" including some dressed as po going punks. July 2008 marked the introduction of a new advertising campaign for Frijj, the first since 2005. This included a series of five viral videos produced by the advertising agency Grey London, which parodied 1950s horror film The Blob. Further to this, a number of adverts ran on the sides of buses and a limited edition bottle design was produced.Frijj parodies The Blob in viral campaign The Guardian In August 2009, it was revealed that Frijj were going to be the new sponsors of Soccer AM, a weekly football based programme produced by British Sky Broadcasting, after signing a \u00a32 million sponsorship deal.Sky's Soccer AM secures Frijj sponsorship Digital Spy Frijj also sponsor Morden & District Sunday Football League team Epsom Downs FC. The 2011 \"circus\" flavours each had their own animal mascot appearing on the packaging; Magnus Monkee (monkey), Pablo Pooch (dog), Hugo Meeow (tiger), The Great Lazaro (rabbit) and Captain Roary (lion), animals commonly found in traditional circuses, to fit in with that range's theme. ===Thorpe Park offer=== For a short period in 2012, Frijj sold their milkshakes at normal prices in supermarkets, but with an offer to win great prizes, and to use the bottle as a free ticket to Thorpe Park. Those who bought the products in this time could enter a code on the bottle on the official Frijj website. The offer ended in the end of September 2012. ==Criticism== Liverpool City Council started a campaign against sugary drinks in May 2016. The campaign entitled \u201cIs your child\u2019s sweet tooth harming their health?\u201d, names Lucozade as the worst offender, with 62 grammes of sugar in a 500ml bottle, followed by Coca- Cola. Frijj chocolate milkshake was the third most sugary drink identified with 50.8 grammes in a 471ml bottle. Posters will be displayed in doctors' surgeries and hospitals. ==References== ==External links== *Official Website *Official Twitter Page *Official Facebook Page Category:Flavored milk ",
