    "text": "Transrapid is an extended play by German electronic artist Alva Noto. It was released in 2004 via Raster Noton label. ==Background== This is the first part of the transall tryptich that, according to the artist, respectively deals with one of three interrelated themes: the increased speed of information flow, utopias, and the fragmentation of ideas. The record is accompanied by an essay written by journalist and author Ulf Poschardt, addressing such issues as the acceleration of art, technology and culture and concluding that a key aspect of the contemporary is the embracing of both speed and stasis. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Carsten Nicolai \u2013 all sounds *Nibo, R-N Modul Berlin \u2013 design *Ulf Poschardt \u2013 liner notes ==References== ==External links== *Alva Noto official website Category:2004 albums Category:Alva Noto albums Category:Raster-Noton albums ",
