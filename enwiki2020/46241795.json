This section of the sports club PUC has disappeared from the landscape of the French elite basketball with the transition to professionalism (contrary to the purpose of a university team), and now evolving at a regional level. PUC was in the elite of the French basketball for fifteen years from 1947 where the club won its first league title until 1963 to win the double in domestic competitions. During this time, put it to the collection of two French Leagues and four national cups. Paris Universit\u00e9 has only one participation in European competitions in 1963-64 season and even the FIBA European Champions Cup. In the first round excluded Luxembourg Etzella Ettelbruck with two wins (73-57 in Ettelbruck and 72-57 in Paris) while in the round of 16 they faced the great Yugoslav OKK Belgrade of Radivoj Kora\u0107, Trajko Rajkovi\u0107 and Aleksandar Nikoli\u0107. Because Paris Universit\u00e9 couldn't travel to Belgrade to play the first leg after all fights to the Yugoslavian capital were cancelled due to adverse weather. Later, FIBA decided that this tie should be played as a single game in Paris (16 January 1964). PUC crashed in its homecourt with 63-105 score and eliminated. == Honours == French League * Winners (2): 1946\u201347, 1962\u201363 French Cup * Winners (4): 1953\u201354, 1954\u201355, 1961\u201362, 1962-63 == Notable players == * Roger Antoine * Jacques Flouret * Emile Frezot * Michel Rat * Jacky Renaud * Michel Longueville == See also == * F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Basket-Ball ==References== == External links == * Paris Universit\u00e9 Club official site Category:Basketball teams in Paris Category:Basketball teams established in 1906 Category:1906 establishments in France ",
