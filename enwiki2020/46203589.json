    "text": "The Slavic ethnonym (and autonym), Slavs, is reconstructed in Proto-Slavic as *Slov\u011bnin\u044a, plural Slov\u011bn\u011b. The earliest written references to the Slav ethnonym are in other languages. == Early mentions == Sporoi () or Spori was according to Eastern Roman scholar Procopius (500\u2013560) the old name of the Antes and Sclaveni, two Early Slavic branches. Procopius stated that the Sclaveni and Antes spoke the same language, but he did not trace their common origin back to the Veneti (as per Jordanes) but to a people he called Sporoi. He derived the name from Greek (\"I scatter grain\"), because \"they populated the land with scattered settlements\". He described their society as democratic, and their language as barbaric. Roman bureaucrat Jordanes wrote about the Slavs in his work Getica (551): \"although they derive from one nation, now they are known under three names, the Veneti, Antes and Sclaveni\" (); that is, the West Slavs, East Slavs, and South Slavs. He stated that the Veneti were the ancestors of the Sclaveni and the Antes, the two having used to be called Veneti but are now \"chiefly\" (though, by implication, not exclusively) called Sclaveni and Antes.Jordanes, Getica 5. Jordanes' Veneti and Procopius' Sporoi were used for the ethnogenetic legend of the Slavs, the ancestors of the Slavs (the subsequent ethnic group name). Thus, the Slav ethnonym at first denoted the southern group of the early Slavs. This ethnonym is attested by Procopius in Byzantine Greek as ('), ('), ('), ('), or \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ('),Procopius, History of the Wars, VII. 14. 22\u201330, VIII. 40. 5. while his contemporary Jordanes refers to the Sclaveni in Latin.Jordanes, The Origin and Deeds of the Goths, V. 33. In Ancient Greek there are no words with the root sl-, thus the original ethnonym was transformed into skl-, as that root was present (in skl\u0113r\u00f3s, \"hard\"). == Church Slavonic manuscripts == In East Church Slavonic manuscripts, the ethnonym is spelt Slov\u011bne (), such as in the Primary Chronicle, Sofia First Chronicle, Novgorod First Chronicle and Novgorod Fourth Chronicle. In the source dating to 898 included in the Primary Chronicle, the term is used both for East Slavic tribes and more often for a people (in the Kievan Rus' society, alongside Varangians, Chuds and Kriviches). == Etymology == The Slavic autonym *Slov\u011bnin\u044a is usually considered a derivation from slovo \"word\", originally denoting \"people who speak (the same language)\", i. e. people who understand each other, in contrast to the Slavic word denoting \"foreign people\", namely n\u011bmci, meaning \"mumbling, murmuring people\" (from Slavic *n\u011bm\u044a \"mumbling, mute\"). The latter word may be the derivation of words to denote \"Germans\" or \"Germanic peoples\" in many later Slavic languages: e. g., Czech N\u011bmec, Slovak Nemec, Slovene Nemec, Belarusian, Russian and Bulgarian \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446, Serbian \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0446, Croatian Nijemac, Polish Niemiec, Ukrainian \u041d\u0456\u043c\u0435\u0446\u044c, etc.,Stephen Barbour and Cathie Carmichael (eds.), Language and Nationalism in Europe (2000), p. 193. but another theory states that rather these words are derived from the name of the Nemetes tribe,The Journal of Indo-European studies, vol. 2 (1974) .Grzegorz Jagodzi\u0144ski, O przenoszeniu nazw lud\u00f3w . which is derived from the Celtic root nemeto-.Xavier Delamarre (2003). Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise. \u00c9ditions Errance, p. 233.John T. Koch (2006). Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, p. 1351. The word slovo (\"word\") and the related slava (\"glory, fame, praise\") and slukh (\"hearing\") originate from the Proto-Indo- European root (\"be spoken of, glory\"), cognate with Ancient Greek ( \"fame\"), whence comes the name Pericles, Latin (\"be called\"), and English . Alternative proposals for the etymology of *Slov\u011bnin\u044a propounded by some scholars have much less support. B. Philip Lozinski argues that the word *slava once had the meaning of \"worshipper\", in this context \"practicer of a common Slavic religion\", and from that evolved into an ethnonym.B. Philip Lozinski, \"The Name 'Slav'\", in: Essays in Russian History. A Collection Dedicated to George Vernadsky, edd. A. D. Ferguson and A. Levin. Archon Books, Hamden, Connecticut 1964, S. 19\u201332 (online text ). S. B. Bernstein speculated that it derives from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European ', cognate to Ancient Greek \u03bb\u03b1\u03cc\u03c2 (la\u00f3s) \"population, people\", which itself has no commonly accepted etymology.Bernstein 1961. Meanwhile, others theorize that Slavyane () is of toponymic origin, from a place named Slovo or a river named Slova; this, according to some, is implied by the suffix -enin. The Old East Slavic Slavuta for the Dnieper River was argued by Henrich Bartek (1907\u20131986) to be derived from slova and also the origin of Slov\u011bne.Etudes slaves et est-europ\u00e9ennes: Slavic and East-European studies, vol. 3 (1958), p. 107. The English term slave derives from the ethnonym Slav. In medieval wars many Slavs were captured and enslaved, which led to the word slav becoming synonym to \"enslaved person\". In addition, the English word Slav derives from the Middle English word sclave, which was borrowed from Medieval Latin sclavus or slavus, itself a borrowing and Byzantine Greek skl\u00e1bos \"slave,\" which was in turn apparently derived from a misunderstanding of the Slavic autonym (denoting a speaker of their own languages). The Byzantine term Sklavinoi was loaned into Arabic as Saqaliba (\u0635\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0629; sing. Saqlabi, \u0635\u0642\u0644\u0628\u064a) by medieval Arab historiographers. However, the origin of this word is disputed.F. Kluge, Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache, 2002, s. v. \"Sklave\".\u0424. \u041c. \u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439: \u0432 30-\u0442\u0438 \u0442. \u0422. 23. \u041c., 1990, \u0441. 63, 382. The popular Italian-language (and international) salutation Ciao is derived from the word. == See also == * Sclaveni * Sporoi == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * Category:Ethnonyms Category:Slavic history Category:Early Slavic people Slav ",
