He participated in the Macedonian Struggle (1904-1908), as well as in the struggle for the establishment of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus (1914). ==Early life== Soulios was born in the village of Orman Ciflik, at the outskirts of Korca (then Ottoman Empire, in present-day Albania). He took part in the Macedonian Struggle (1904-1908), as a leader of a Greek guerilla group which operated in the regions of Korca and Western Macedonia.Dakin, 1966: p. 363 After the Balkan Wars ended he became part of the personal guard of the local Orthodox Bishop of Korytsa (Korca), Germanos.Kaphetzopoulos, Flokas, Dima-Dimitriou, 2000: p. 184 ==Korca uprising== The following cession of his homeland to the newly established Principality of Albania catalyzed the uprising in the region of Northern Epirus (in modern southern Albania) against this decision and lead to the declaration of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus in March 1914. After the establishment of the newly arrived Albanian authorities in Korca, which were accompanied by Dutch officers of the International Gendarmerie, a local uprising broke out in favor of the Northern Epirus movement. Soulios was one of the leaders of the uprising, however, he was wounded in combat during an attempt to storm the enemy police headquarters of the city.Kaphetzopoulos, Flokas, Dima-Dimitriou, 2000: p. 185 In 1916, during World War I, the French Army that controlled the city, declared the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korce. Soulios was arrested and sent to concentration camps in France. After the end of the war he moved to Greece and lived in the village of Marina, Florina Prefecture. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:1927 deaths Category:Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus Category:Greek revolutionaries Category:Northern Epirotes Category:People from Kor\u00e7\u00eb Category:People of the Macedonian Struggle Category:Prisoners and detainees of France ",
