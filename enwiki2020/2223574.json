She produced the album We Are... by Digging Roots, which won the Juno Award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2010. ==Early Life== Starr's ancestry is indigenous, specifically Mohawk, through her father, Michael Starr. Starr attended Western Canada High School and Queen's University. After moving to Vancouver, Starr formed her first band in 1992. According to legend, the true extent of her talent was first revealed on trip to New York City, when a friend pushed her onstage at an East Village club's open-mic night, where her impromptu spoken-word poetry met an enthusiastic reception. ==Career== Following a self-released demo called Learning 2 Cook in 1995, she released her debut album Tidy in 1996, mixing rock, punk, pop, and hip-hop, along with her trademark spoken-word poetry. On that album, she rapped in three languages: English, Spanish, and French. Starr signed to major label group Island/Def Jam in 1997, following a massive bidding war during which Clive Davis personally flew out to dine the young artist to try and sign her to his roster of pop stars. The next year, Seagram bought Polygram, the parent company of Island Def Jam, and merged it into Universal Music Group. In the resulting upheaval, Starr felt she was lost in the shuffle and she asked to be released from her contract. The material she recorded for her first album with Island Def Jam, 1998's Mending was never released, though some record labels have talked of releasing the lost album. In 1997, Starr appeared on the Lilith Fair tour. In the late '90s and in 2004, she toured Canada with Veda Hille and Oh Susanna as part of the \"Scrappy Bitch Tour\". She performed in November 2000 at Lee's Palace in Toronto.\"LIVE: Kinnie Starr w/ Sook-Yin Lee & Tara Chase Tuesday November 07, 2000 @ 10:30 AM Nov. 3, 2000 Lee's Palace Toronto, ON\".

In 2011, Starr was honoured as a Pioneer in Canadian Hip Hop Culture by the ManifesTO festival. Her 2018 album, Feed the Fire explores finding one's truest self amidst the digital chaos of the 21st century. ===Musical style and influences=== Her musical style has been described as \"hip hop aggro groove\".
