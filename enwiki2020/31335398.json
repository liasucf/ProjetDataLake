WheelTug will accomplish this goal through twin electric motors installed in the nose wheels; Wall Street Journal article by Scott McCartney dated December 29, 2013, \"When an Airplane Needs a Taxi;\" https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-an-airplane-needs-a-taxi-1387917073?tesla=y these motors will be powered by the aircraft's Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). According to Aviation Week, the WheelTug system was projected to provide savings in ground turnaround time and increased aircraft utilization.Aviation Week article dated January 10, 2017; \"WheelTug Begins E-Taxi Certification and Promises Pushback Savings\" by Graham Warwick; http://aviationweek.com/technology/wheeltug-begins-e-taxi-certification-and- promises-pushback-savings Airports International online article dated June 21, 2010;\"WheelTug;\" http://www.airportsinternational.com/2010/06/wheeltug/5420 M.I.

Delta Air Lines issued a press release in 2007 that Delta would become a development partner and launch customer for Wheeltug expecting installation of first production units on Delta's Boeing 737s by late 2009.http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=20295&item;=123029 According to a Wheeltug press release, roller tests were conducted at Prague Airport in November 2010 in snowy and icy conditions, and the first fully 'in-wheel' demonstration unit was tested there June 2012. In December 2016, the FAA accepted the company's Supplemental Type Certification (STC) plan for the Boeing 737 Next Generation models. As of January 2017 Wheeltug claims that more than 20 commercial airlines accepted optional production slots over the years. The CEO states that he hoped WheelTug would enter service for the 737NG when the certification process was expected to be complete in late 2018, with Canadian carrier Air Transat as the launch customer.
