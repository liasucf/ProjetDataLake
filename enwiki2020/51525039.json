    "text": "The tenth season of the animated television series, Archer, known as Archer: 1999, premiered on May 29, 2019, on FXX. It is also the final season for Adam Reed as a full time show runner. ==Production== FXX announced that this season would see a change in the time period once again, with this series taking place in space. Along with the change in time period, the network announced that the same voice cast would return as in previous seasons, and they would again play different versions of their characters. This means that Archer, who was found shot in actress Veronica Deane's pool at the conclusion of season seven, remains in a coma, and the events of the season are of his imagination. These different versions have similar personalities to their \"normal\" counterparts but are in different jobs or roles and have different relationships. The season's premise sees Archer as the hard-drinking half- captain (with Lana Kane as the other half-captain) of the spacefaring M/V Seamus salvage ship. This is the first season where creator Adam Reed has not written every episode for the season. ==Synopsis== Sterling Archer in his comatose dreaming imagines that he is the captain of the \"M/V Seamus (934TXS)\", a space salvage freighter, co-captaining with his ex-wife Lana, with whom he is co-owner of the ship. Krieger is the android scientist/doctor onboard, while Cyril is the onboard accountant as well as Lana's lover, and Ray is a gay courtesan. Pam is a hulking grey alien, while Cheryl/Carole is a bloodthirsty/suicidal spacefighter pilot. \"Mother\", or Ms. Archer, is a glowing ball of light. The crew has the aesthetic of Ridley Scott's Alien's space trucker crew. The crew have sci-fi space adventures with the usual hijinks. Amongst the recurring characters are Barry-6, a robot space-pirate, and human space-captain Brett. At the end of the season, Sterling wakes from his coma in the hospital, three years after being shot. ==Episodes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Archer (2009 TV series) seasons Category:2019 American television seasons Category:Fiction set in 1999 Category:Space in fiction Category:Space Western television series Category:American adult animated space adventure television series ",
