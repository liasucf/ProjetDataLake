    "text": "Robert George McCutcheon (1841 - 20 October 1918) was an Irish-born Australian politician. He was born in Omagh to John McCutcheon and Margaret Bothwell. His family migrated to Victoria around 1858; Robert spent a year in Calcutta as a printer and then became a journalist in Ballarat and Port Fiary. On 13 December 1867 he married Mary Ebblewhite, a prominent member of the Australian Women's National League; they would have eight children. In 1873 he moved to Melbourne to assume his brother's place in the printing firm Mason, Firth & McCutcheon, which he owned exclusively from 1878. He was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for St Kilda; a Liberal, he nonetheless opposed Thomas Bent's government in 1908. He was a minister without portfolio from 1915 to 1916, when he resigned; he retired from politics in 1917. McCutcheon died in St Kilda in 1918. ==References== Category:1841 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Victoria Category:Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly Category:People from Omagh Category:Irish emigrants to Australia (before 1923) Category:Australian printers ",
