It was released by the well-known publishing house Dar al-Hilal that was also responsible for the publications of al-Fukaha, Kull Shay\u02be and Al Musawwar. The magazine consists of seven volumes with a total of 228 issues which were published weekly. The feature of the magazine did not only focus on Egyptian and international occurrences, but also illustrations pursuing a cultural focus. A considerable number of cartoons, photographies and high-quality illustrations increased the readership vastly, even among illiterates. In the course of this novel phase regarding the Egyptian media landscape, al-Dunya al-Musawwara seized on new topics, such as fashion, sports, culture, and tourism, and offered a great commercial platform to popular products of that time. ==References== Category:Arabic-language magazines Category:Defunct literary magazines Category:Defunct magazines published in Egypt Category:Literary magazines published in Egypt Category:Weekly magazines published in Egypt Category:Magazines disestablished in 1932 Category:Magazines established in 1929 Category:Magazines published in Cairo ",
