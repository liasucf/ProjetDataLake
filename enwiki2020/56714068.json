He served in World War II, Korea and during the early phase of Vietnam War and completed his career as commanding general of Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic. ==Early life== Richard G. Weede was born on September 26, 1911, in Sterling, Kansas, and, following high school, he enrolled the Kansas State Teachers College, but left during the second year there and entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1931. During his time at the academy, Weede was active in basketball team, competed in track and also was a member of Ring committee, which was responsible for final design of the class ring. He graduated on June 5, 1935, and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on the same date. Some of his classmates reached the general officer rank later: Robert E. Cushman Jr., Eli T. Reich, Eugene Fluckey, Ralph M. Metcalf or Arnold F. Johnston. Weede was subsequently ordered to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for his basic officer training which he completed in February 1936. With 124 students, it was the largest Basic School class to that date. This class provided two future Marine Corps Commandants (Leonard F. Chapman Jr. and Robert E. Cushman Jr.), five lieutenant generals (Lewis J. Fields, Frederick E. Leek, Herman Nickerson Jr., William J. Van Ryzin, Weede), five major generals (William R. Collins, William T. Fairbourn, Bruno Hochmuth, Raymond L. Murray, Carey A. Randall) and six brigadier generals (William W. Buchanan, Odell M. Conoley, Frederick P. Henderson, Roy L. Kline, John C. Miller Jr., Thomas F. Riley). He was subsequently attached to the 1st Battalion, 10th Marines at Quantico, Virginia. His unit was attached to the 2nd Marine Brigade in October 1936 and served in San Diego, California and Guam until July 1940. He was meanwhile promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in July 1938. ==World War II== Following his return to the United States, Weede was ordered to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina and attached to the newly activated 4th Defense Battalion under Major George F. Good. This new kind of Anti-aircraft/coastal defense units was designated for the defense of naval bases in South Pacific against potential threats. With the activation of 5th Defense Battalion at Parris Island in December of that year, Major Good transferred Weede to his unit. Weede was promoted to the rank of captain in March 1941. After the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, Captain Weede was transferred to 2nd Defense Battalion in January 1942. The battalion was already sent to the Pacific, and Weede served at American Samoa under Lieutenant Colonel Raymond E. Knapp as commanding officer of the 5-Inch Artillery Group. He was promoted to the rank of major in May 1942 and to lieutenant colonel in May 1943. Weede led his unit to Tarawa at the end of November 1943, following the main landing and the battalion under his command repelled several enemy bombing raids. He was subsequently ordered to the United States for instruction at Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma in January 1944, but rejoined his unit in May of that year. The 2nd Defense Battalion was already redesignated 2nd Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion and Weede served as its commander until October 1944. He was subsequently transferred to the 10th Marine Artillery Regiment, 2nd Marine Division and appointed commanding officer of 2nd Battalion. Under his command, 2nd Battalion took part in the practice for its next combat deployment \u2013 Okinawa. The 2nd Battalion was part of the floating reserve for the Okinawa invasion, but toward the end of June 1945, commanding general of 10th Army, Lieutenant general Simon B. Buckner requested fresh units to reinforce main forces exhausted by weeks of combat. The Second Marine Division provided 8th Marines under the command of Colonel Clarence R. Wallace and Weede and his 2nd Battalion to support them. Weede landed with his unit on Okinawa at the noon of June 16 and quickly deployed his battalion. He led artillery attack on the village of Makabe and helped destroy remnants of Japanese forces, which were preparing for counterattack. Three days later, the island was declared secured and Weede and his regiment were ordered back to Saipan. For his service during Tarawa and Okinawa campaigns, he was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V\". ==Postwar service and Korea== Lieutenant Colonel Weede returned stateside in July 1945 and was attached to the Bureau of Ordnance, Navy Department under Vice Admiral George F.

Following the breakdown of armistice negotiations in August 1951, the United Nations Command decided to launch a limited offensive in the late summer/early autumn to shorten and straighten sections of their lines, acquire better defensive terrain, and deny the enemy key vantage points from which they could observe and target UN positions. Colonel Weede led his 5th Marines to the action on September 15 and during the Battle of the Punchbowl and took part in the assault on the Kanmubong Ridge, where captured the Hill 812.

He was succeeded by Colonel Custis Burton Jr. and ordered to the United States under rotation policy. Weede received his second Legion of Merit for work as chief of staff and two Air Medals for his participation in liaison and reconnaissance flights over the frontline. Upon his return, Weede served at Headquarters Marine Corps as a member of the Fleet Marine Force Organizational Structure Board and of the Naval Examining Board until August 1952. He was then ordered for an instruction at Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, and graduated in June 1953. ==Later service and Vietnam== His next assignment was at Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, where he served as a member of Advanced Research Group.

He departed San Diego and was transferred to Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii in November 1959 and relieved Bridagier General Frederick L. Wieseman as commanding general of 1st Marine Brigade. His brigade served as the \"middleweight\" global crisis response force and was able to \"operate independently, as a service component, or to lead a Joint Task Force. While in this capacity, Weede was promoted to the rank of major general in August 1961. He left Hawaii at the beginning of February 1962 and sailed for Saigon, South Vietnam to be appointed Chief of Staff of newly created Military Assistance Command, Vietnam under General Paul D. Harkins. Within this joint-service command, Weede was co-responsible for all units operating in Vietnam until May 1964. He subsequently received Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his service in this capacity.
