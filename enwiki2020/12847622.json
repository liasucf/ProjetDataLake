Initially in its history, most of its worship services were held in Greek. In 1950, the church had to move due to city construction and because the parish had outgrown its old building. A new church was built on Yoakum Street in the Neartown area. Its capacity was about 475. The church was completed in 1952. A community hall named for longtime parishioner S.P. Martel was built next door to the church and still serves the community. In 1960, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America created archdiocesan districts to better serve the Greek Orthodox faithful throughout the country, and Houston was assigned to the 8th Archdiocesan District, which was served by a bishop in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1967 the seat of the bishop for district 8 was moved to Houston, and Bishop Iakovos of Catania arrived in Houston and consecrated the Annuciation Church as his new cathedral. At that time, the diocese included most of the states in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain region. Some of the larger parishes were in Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Omaha, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, Shreveport and Tulsa. The dean of the cathedral was Fr. Nicholas Triantafilou, who served as priest in Houston from 1965\u20131991.
