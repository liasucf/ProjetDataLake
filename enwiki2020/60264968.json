Each coach, in addition to the famous red button would have three small buttons with the names of the three other coaches. If a coach really desires having a certain candidate in his/her team and fears that the candidate may be picked by another coach, he/she can block that specific coach from actually pressing his red button for him/her. Coaches can only use this right for a single time during the blind audition segment of the season. However, the practice of using of mentor coaches during the duels was discontinued. Instead a \"super coach\" serving in similar series in another country would be invited to help the coaches and their contestants in preparing their songs in the period following the blind auditions. Also, four personalities would become \"honorary members\" of each team, and would prepare a joint song with their respective teams during the final. The honorary members were Corey Hart on \u00c9ric Lapointe's team,Richard Therrien, \"\u00abLa voix\u00bb: un premier blocage et Corey Hart\". Le Droit, February 10, 2019.
