    "text": "Patrick Huerre, born in 1947, is a French physicist in fluid mechanics. An engineer from the \u00c9cole centrale de Paris (1970), and a doctor of aeronautical sciences from Stanford University, he began his career at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. In 1989, he was appointed Professor of Mechanics at the \u00c9cole polytechnique where he created, with Jean-Marc Chomaz, and then directed the Laboratoire d'hydrodynamique (LadHyX), a joint CNRS- \u00c9cole polytechnique research unit. He is currently Director of Research Emeritus at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS). He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences. == Biography == === Training === He received an engineering degree from the \u00c9cole centrale de Paris in 1970. He then obtained a master's degree and a doctorate in aeronautical sciences from Stanford University (1971, 1976). === Career === During his PhD (1971-1975), Patrick Huerre was a Research Assistant in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. From 1976 to 1978, he was a postdoctoral fellow with David Crighton in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Leeds. In 1978, he was hired by Janos Laufer as Assistant Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. He will then be promoted to Associate Professor and then Professor. In 1989, he returned to France after his appointment as Professor of Mechanics at the \u00c9cole polytechnique, a position he held until 2012. In 1990, he and Jean-Marc Chomaz founded the Hydrodynamics Laboratory (LadHyX), which he managed until 2008. At the same time, from 1991 to 2012, he was Director of Research at the CNRS. He is currently Director of Research Emeritus. He was invited in 2015 as a Professor at the Miller Institute for basic research in science at the University of California at Berkeley. == Scientific work == Patrick Huerre's theoretical research focuses on fluid dynamics. Most of his work focuses on hydrodynamic instabilities to account for the transition to chaosMoon, H.T., Huerre, P. & Redekopp, L.G., \u00ab Transitions to Chaos in the Ginzburg-Landau Equation \u00bb, Physica D, (1983), vol. 7, p. 135-150 or turbulenceHo, C.M. & Huerre, P., \u00ab Perturbed Shear Layers \u00bb, Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, (1984), vol. 16, p. 365-424Huerre, P. & Rossi, M., \u00ab Hydrodynamic Instabilities in Open Flows\", in \"Hydrodynamics and Nonlinear Instabilities \u00bb, Godr\u00e8che, C. & Manneville, P. eds (Cambridge University Press), (1998), p. 81-294 in sheared flows.
