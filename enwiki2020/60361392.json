The Museum is staffed by Mississippi Records employees. ==History== At its founding, Werbel called the PMOMA she called it \"her fake museum.\" OPB noted that PMOMA is \"a tiny space that wittily challenges ideas about the nature of museums and the art-watching experience.\" The project has received recognition in Artforum, among others, and has been supported by the Precipice Fund, The Calligram Foundation, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and the Regional Arts & Culture Council. In September 2016, PMOMA hosted a residency series, Houseguest, on Pioneer Courthouse Square. The PMOMA showcases contemporary folk art. == References == == External links == * Category:2012 establishments in Oregon Category:Art museums established in 2012 Category:Art museums in Oregon Category:Museums in Portland, Oregon ",
