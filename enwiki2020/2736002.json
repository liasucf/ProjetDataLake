The plan was executed after his death with a plan to provide low-cost housing for working-class people. Sir John Sulman (1849\u20131934) planned the estate on crown land that had been reserved as a water conservation site.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon (Angus and Robertson) 1990, pages 76-77 Daceyville was listed on the Register of the National Estate in 1991. Astrolabe and Boussole Roads were named after the two ships commanded by La Perouse, the French explorer who arrived at Botany Bay just days after the First Fleet in 1788.Dictionary of Sydney ===Trams=== The Daceyville tram line opened in 1913 with services from Circular Quay via Waterloo. The line branched from the Botany Road line at Gardeners Road, and passed east along Gardeners Road to join the lines at Anzac Pde at what was known as Daceyville Junction. It included a large collection of sidings at the former Rosebery Racecourse, now the site of The Lakes Golf Course. Some services were extended to Maroubra Beach via the Anzac Parade lines. The line closed in 1957. ===Public school=== The school is situated on a five-acre site between Bunnerong Road and Banks Avenue. Application was originally made for a public school in the area in 1913, but only an infants school was initially approved. This opened at Astrolabe Road in 1914. It became a primary school in 1917.
