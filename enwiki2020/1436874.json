    "text": "Roger Ramjet is a 1965\u20131969 animated American television comedy series, starring Roger Ramjet and the American Eagle Squadron. The show was known for its simple animation, frenetic pace, and frequent references to pop culture which appealed to adults as well as children. The show gained a second life when aired on Cartoon Network from 1996 to 1998. ==Plot== Roger Ramjet is a patriotic and highly moral \u2014 if not very bright \u2014 hero, who is typically out to save the world, with help from his Proton Energy Pills (\"PEP\"), which give him \"the strength of twenty atom bombs for a period of twenty seconds\". The world is invariably saved by defeating the various recurring criminals who populated the series. On government missions assigned by General G.I. Brassbottom, Ramjet encounters various nemeses during his missions. Typically he is caught, and must be rescued by his crew of sidekicks, the American Eagles: Yank, Doodle, Dan and Dee (a play on \"Yankee Doodle dandy\"). Although his Eagles appear to be children, each of them, except for Dee, flies his own individual ramjet aircraft expertly, and they are obviously much more savvy than their leader. The various recurring criminals include: * Pint-sized gangster Noodles Romanoff and his evil organization N.A.S.T.Y. (National Association of Spies, Traitors and Yahoos). Noodles wears dark glasses, a fedora, and a trench coat. His hands are always jammed into his jacket pockets. His band of No Goods consist of several lookalike henchmen clad in hats and coats, who simultaneously utter incomprehensible phrases of agreement to whatever he says. * The Solenoid Robots, green metal gas mask-faced evildoers from outer space who have a unicycle-like wheel instead of legs and talk in barely understandable electronic voices. * Red Dog the Pirate, a redheaded short, squat scourge of the seven seas with an eye patch, peg-leg and a wiseacre parrot named Carl Bob for a sidekick. * Blond, long-nosed, Zsa Zsa Gabor-accented foreign spy femme fatale Jacqueline Hyde (a play on Jekyll and Hyde). * Dr. Frank N. Schwine, a Boris Karloff soundalike mad scientist who, with the help of his purple propeller beanie-wearing assistant Sidney, keeps creating huge hulking Frankenstein-style monsters only to have them defeated by Roger and become football players. * Count Batguy, a bald Nosferatu-style vampire from Transylvania complete with Bela Lugosi accent. * Dr. What, internationally feared evil genius. * Sexy senorita Tequila Mockingbird (a play on To Kill a Mockingbird) who teams up with her bandito boyfriends the Enchilada Brothers, Beef and Chicken, to stir up revolution in the tiny Latin American country of San Domino. Another recurring, non-criminal character in the series was sportscaster Vincent Yafnarro, who appeared in several sports-related episodes. Roger's tough little old mother, Ma Ramjet, appeared in several episodes; her voice was an imitation of Jonathan Winters' \"Maude Frickert\" character, and she had her own variation on her son's Proton Energy Pills, \"Ma Ramjet's Atomic Vitamins for Old People whose Get-Up-and-Go Got Up and Left.\" Lance Crossfire (a parody of actor Burt Lancaster), Ramjet's toothy test pilot rival for the affections of his short, Southern-accented sweetheart Lotta Love, is also likely to get in the way. When Lance and Roger cross paths, neither one of them wins: in one episode, the always fickle Lotta ends up going out with General Brassbottom, who promises the two men that he will take care of her. As is his way, Roger does not realize that they have both lost \u2014 unlike Lance, who inevitably ends these cartoons with the phrase, \"Oh, Roger \u2014 Shut up!\" ==Episodes== ===Season one (1965)=== # \"Dr. Ivan Evilkisser\" # \"The Sheik\" # \"Bat Guy\" # \"The Shaft\" # \"Kokomo\" # \"Baseball\" # \"The Cowboy\" # \"Dee Kidnap\" # \"Drafted\" # \"TV Crisis\" # \"Miss America\" # \"The Pirates\" # \"Revolution\" # \"Torture\" # \"The Race\" # \"Jack the Nipper\" # \"Ma Ramjet\" # \"The Cockroaches\" - this episode is a parody of The Beatles # \"Moon\" # \"Hi Noon\" # \"Bank Robbers\" # \"Sun Clouds\" # \"Football\" # \"Bullfighter\" # \"Bathysphere\" # \"Skydiving\" # \"Monkey\" # \"Dr. Frank N.

In Australia, in 1966 the show appeared on the ABC in the afternoon, and has been shown regularly on Australian television ever since.

Invariably, the name of the town was mispronounced. *The name \"Roger\" came about after producer Fred Crippen had an interview with a reporter named Roger Smith. Smith asked Crippen about his new TV series and then joked that the main character should be named Roger. *The theme song's lyrics are sung to the melody of Yankee Doodle. ==Other credits== * Associate Producers: Dick Reed, Paul Shively * Production Coordinator: Fred Calvert * Animation: Don Schloat, Alan Zaslove, Bill Hutton, George Nicholas, Fred Crippen * Background: Jack Heiter * Layout: Rosemary O'Connor, Sam Weiss, Joe Bruno, Dave Hanan, Bob Kurtz * Sound Effects: Phil Kaye * Ink and Paint: Constance Crawley * Checking: Dottie Mullens * Sound: TV Recorders, Western Recorders ==DVD release== On February 8, 2005, Classic Media (distributed by Sony Wonder) released Roger Ramjet: Hero Of Our Nation (Special Collector's Edition), a 3-Disc box set containing 119 of the 156 episodes of the series (although the box incorrectly states that 120 episodes are included).
