The men were recruited from Hickman, Fayette, Bullitt, Jefferson, Graves, Franklin, Harrison, Scott, Owen, Bourbon, and Anderson counties. In October of that same year, the regiment contained 832 men and, at the Battle of Fort Donelson, its force of 618 was captured. After being exchanged, the reconstituted regiment saw action at the Battle of Shiloh. It later was assigned to Hanson's, Helm's, and J.H. Lewis' Brigade. The 2nd Kentucky Infantry was involved in the battles of Murfreesboro and Chickamauga. It reported 13 killed, 70 wounded, and 21 missing at Murfreesboro, lost fifty- two percent of the 302 engaged at Chickamauga, and totaled 293 men and 214 arms in December 1863. The following summer, the regiment participated in the Atlanta Campaign. During fall 1864, the unit served as mounted infantry and took part in the defense of Savannah and the subsequent Carolinas Campaign in early 1865. On April 26, 1865, it surrendered with the Army of Tennessee at Washington, Georgia. ==Commanders== * Colonel Roger Weightman Hanson * Colonel James Morrison Hawes * Colonel Robert A.
