It is the band's first album since leaving Beggars Banquet (though the sleeve artwork still features the Beggars Banquet logo). The album reached #2 in the UK Albums Chart to widespread critical acclaim, receiving several perfect ratings and was voted the best album of 2007 by Kerrang! and Rock Sound. The album also reached #17 in Ireland, and #39 in the overall world charts. The album is certified Platinum in the UK, having sold over 300,000 copies. As of July 2016, it has sold 342,042 copies in the UK. This album is notable for having somewhat more straightforward song structures and a more melodic overall sound than their previous work, while still retaining some more unusual elements. ==Overview== The album was recorded from September to November 2006 at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and The Farm Studio in Gibsons, British Columbia. It was produced by Garth Richardson, engineered by Mike Fraser, mixed by Andy Wallace in New York, and mastered by Howie Weinberg at Masterdisk. The band said that they had 40 tracks to choose from,Rock Sound magazine interview with Biffy Clyro and that they had been recording with composer Graeme Revell and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra whilst making the album.Kerrang! magazine interview with Biffy Clyro The artwork for Puzzle and its subsequent singles was designed by Storm Thorgerson. It is possible that the artwork is a reference to the song \"Glitter and Trauma\", which includes the line \"your skin will break into jigsaw shaped pieces of meat.\" ==Lyric meaning and music stylistic changes== After the release of Infinity Land the band had stated that they felt they had pushed their original sound to its limit, and wanted to try a more straightforward approach to songwriting. Lyrically, the album deals mainly with the death of Simon Neil's mother Eleanor, who had died a few years prior to the recording of Puzzle. The most noticeable difference between Puzzle and the band's previous work is the more streamlined and accessible nature of the songs, with fewer of the abrupt structure and time signature changes which characterised their early material. Influences such as Sunny Day Real Estate and Red House Painters can be heard heavily on this album. ==Track listing== On the US & Japanese version the first track was split into \"Intro\" (1:25) & \"Living Is A Problem Because Everything Dies\" (3:53) On the iTunes and Spotify version, the tracks 2/15ths and 4/15ths are included at the beginning of \u201cA Whole Child Ago\u201d and \u201cLove Has A Diameter\u201d respectively, instead of at the end of the previous tracks. ===Unreleased tracks=== *\"Help Me Become Captain\" (Previously known as \"Angels Fall\") was later renamed \"Help Me Be Captain\" and released as a B-side to \"The Captain\". The song remained the same as the original version played at live shows in 2005. *\"Captain, Sir...\" (A counterpart to \"Help Me Become Captain\") was originally a counterpart to \"Help Me Become Captain\". It was developed into \"The Captain\" and was included on their 5th album \"Only Revolutions\" and released as the third single from the album. *\"I'm Probably In Your Pocket\" was originally set to be on \"Only Revolutions\" but it was cut from the album. The track was included on Biffy Clyro's sixth studio album Opposites under the title \"Pocket\". *\"The Ghouls of Bymbombidor\" Sections from this song were used in their 2006 cover of a Weezer song \"Buddy Holly\" (for Kerrang! magazine cover CD, High Voltage!: A Brief History of Rock) and in the Puzzle album track 9/15ths. ===Editions=== * A Standard CD * A Limited Edition CD/DVD which includes a bonus track, \"Drop It\" (a re-recording of a demo, \"Drop It Dickhead\"), as well as a bonus DVD, which includes a 40-minute documentary, The Making of Puzzle, as well as the videos for \"Semi-Mental\", \"Saturday Superhouse\" and \"Living is a Problem Because Everything Dies\". * Fans who pre-ordered the iTunes download received a 10-minute video entitled Pieces, which contains footage of the band at their four night run at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, Glasgow, Scotland, in December 2005, as well as two exclusive bonus tracks: **\"Semi-Mental (Acoustic)\" **\"As Dust Dances (Acoustic)\" These bonus features are as yet unavailable separately. ==Personnel== * Simon Neil \u2013 vocals, guitar, glockenspiel * James Johnston \u2013 vocals, bass guitar * Ben Johnston \u2013 vocals, drums * Garth \"GGGarth\" Richardson \u2013 producer * Andy Wallace \u2013 mixing * Mike Fraser \u2013 engineer * Howie Weinberg \u2013 mastering * Graeme Revell \u2013 string and choir orchestrations * Seattle Symphony Orchestra \u2013 violins, violas, cellos, choir * Ben Kaplan \u2013 keyboard * Mike Norman \u2013 keyboard, saxophone on \"Now I'm Everyone\" * Dorothy Lawson \u2013 cello on \"Machines\" * Ylber Sejdiu \u2013 Model on artwork * Carolyn Roper \u2013 Body artist on artwork ==Release history== Puzzle was released in various countries in 2007. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
