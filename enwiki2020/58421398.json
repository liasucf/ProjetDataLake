Her films and writing focus on issues of human rights, overlooked periods in history, and Asian-American diaspora. She is well known for her book and film of the same name, Silence Broken: Korean Comfort Women. Both the book and the film are award-winning historical accounts of Korean women forced into sexual servitude by the Japanese army during World War II. She has been recognized and funded by The Rockefeller Fellowship, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the MacArthur Foundation. Her awards and honors include the Asian American Media Arts Award, the Kodak Filmmaker Award, and CINE Golden Eagle. ==Early life== Kim was born in 1938 in Sincheon, Hwanghae Province, in an area which would later become part of North Korea after the division of the peninsula. Kim's early life coincided with the end of Japanese rule in Korea and World War II. During World War II, Korea was forced to support Japan's military, and 200,000 Korean and Chinese women and girls were forced into sexual slavery and labeled as \"comfort women.\" The history of Korea during this era has been a frequent subject of Kim's work. At age 7, in 1945, Kim and her family moved across the 38th parallel on foot into South Korea. Her family was deeply committed to the Korean independence movement and to Christianity. ===Education=== Dai Sil attended the Ewha Girls' High School in Seoul. She went on to obtain her master's degree in Theological Studies from the Methodist Theological Seminary in Seoul in 1960. In 1962 Kim moved to Boston, Massachusetts to attend Boston University, where she obtained her PhD in Religious Studies. She published her PhD dissertation in 1969, titled \"The Doctrine of Man in Irenaeus of Lyon.\" ==Career== After graduating from Boston University, Kim taught Religion at Mount Holyoke College from 1969 to 1978. In 1978, Kim began work at the National Endowment for the Humanities working on media programming grants. While working at NEH Kim met and worked with Don Gibson, whom she later married. From 1986 to 1988 Kim-Gibson worked as the Director of Media Programs for the New York State Council on the Arts. She left NYSCA in 1988 to begin freelance work as a filmmaker and author. The first film Kim-Gibson was involved in was released in 1991. America Becoming was sponsored by the Ford Foundation and directed by Charles Burnett. Kim-Gibson co-wrote the film with Burnett. The film considered growing diversity in America through the stories of newcomers and established residents in six American cities. In 1993, Kim- Gibson and two other Korean-American women, Christine Choy and Elaine Kim, released the documentary film Sa-I-Gu. Sa-i-gu is Korean for April 29, the date the Rodney King riot began in Los Angeles in 1992. Sa-I-Gu uses newsreel footage and interviews with Korean-American shopkeepers to tell the story of the King riots from their unique perspective. The film was aired by PBS as part of its independent film series POV (TV series) on September 10, 1993. Her 2004 film Wet Sand: Voices from LA (2004) also deals with the aftermath of the Rodney King riots. Kim-Gibson's third film was released in 1995, titled A Forgotten People: The Sakhalin Koreans. A Forgotten People tells the story of 43,000 Koreans who were brought by the Japanese to Sakhalin Island during World War II for forced labor. In 1999 Kim-Gibson released a book about the history of Korean comfort women during WWII and how the women's lives were impacted. In the year 2000 Kim-Gibson's film Silence Broken: Korean Comfort Women was released. In 2014 Kim-Gibson's most personal film People Are The Sky was released. Kim-Gibson returned to North Korea for the first time in almost 70 years for the film, exploring the social history of North and South Korea through her own story. The film uses \"interviews, epic images, and graceful musings\" to provide history and explore if North Korea is \"still home.\" === Film Festivals === In 2011 the fifth-annual Korean American Film Festival honored Kim-Gibson in Manhattan with a six-film retrospective and discussions led by her long-time collaborator, Charles Burnett. The United States' longest-running Asian film festival, the Asian American International Film Festival presented Kim-Gibson's latest film People are the Sky in 2016.
