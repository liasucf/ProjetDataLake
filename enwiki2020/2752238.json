    "text": "This is a list of established military terms which have been in use for at least 50 years. Since technology has changed, not all of them are in current use, or they may have been superseded by more modern terms. However, they are still in current use in articles about previous military periods. Some of them like camouflet have been adapted to describe modern versions of old techniques. ==Administrative== * Cantonment: a temporary or semi-permanent military quarters; in South Asia, the term cantonment also describes permanent military stations. * Logistics * Materiel (also mat\u00e9riel) * Military supply chain management * Staging area ==Intelligence== * Signals intelligence (SIGINT) and signals intelligence in modern history **Electronic intelligence (ELINT) ***High-frequency direction finding (nicknamed huff-duff) is the common name for a type of radio direction finding employed especially during the two world wars. **Communications intelligence (COMINT) * Human intelligence (HUMINT) * Imagery intelligence (IMINT) * Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) * Open-source intelligence (OSINT) ==On land== * Demilitarized zone (DMZ): not all are military * No man's land: land that is not occupied or, more specifically, land that is under dispute between countries or areas that will not occupy it because of fear or uncertainty, or for tactical or strategical considerations. No man's land was what the Allied Expeditionary Force under the command of General Pershing would refer to the land separating the fronts of the two opposing armies, as it was deadly to be there. ===Arms and services=== * Artillery includes any engine used for the discharge of large projectiles. * Artillery battery: an organized group of artillery pieces (previously artillery park). * Also see below Artillery ===Doctrinal=== These terms are used for talking about how armed forces are used.

The goal is to halt the importation of goods which could help the blockaded nation's war effort. * Booby trap * Breach: a gap in fortified or battle lines. * Breakout: exploiting a breach in enemy lines so that a large force (division or above) passes through. * Bridgehead and its varieties known as beachheads and airheads. * Charge: a large force heads directly to an enemy to engage in close quarters combat, with the hope of breaking the enemy line. * Chequered retreat, (retraite en \u00e9chiquier, Fr.) a line or battalion, alternately retreating and facing about in the presence of an enemy, exhibiting a deployment like chequered squares * Column: a formation of soldiers marching in files in which the files is significantly longer than the width of ranks in the formation. * Counterattack * Counter-battery fire * Coup de gr\u00e2ce: a death blow intended to end the suffering of a wounded soldier; also applied to severely damaged ships (called scuttling when applied to friendly ships). * Coup de main: a swift pre-emptive strike. * Debellatio: to end a war by complete destruction of a hostile state.

Instead, the besieger attempts to persuade the defenders to surrender through negotiation, inducement, or through privations such as starvation. This may be done because the fortress is too strong for the attackers to capture through bombardment and assault, or because if the fortification when captured is undamaged it immediately becomes a functional strong point for the former besiegers. ** Circumvallation: a line of fortifications built by the attackers around the besieged fortification facing towards it. ** Contravallation: a second line of fortifications behind the circumvallation facing away from the enemy fort to protect the besiegers from attacks by allies of the besieged. ** Escalade: the act of scaling defensive walls or ramparts with the aid of ladders, a prominent feature of siege warfare in medieval times. ** Chevaux de frise: sword blades chained together to incapacitate people trying to charge into a breach in the walls. ** Investment: surrounding an enemy fort (or town) with armed forces to prevent entry or escape. ** Military mining, undermining of defence positions either fortifications or enemy front line trenches (see also camouflet). ** Parallel trenches ** Sapping: digging approach trench towards enemy fortifications within range of the besieged guns. ** Siege engines: specialised weapons used to overcome fortifications of a besieged fort or town;
