She was a renowned queen in developing infrastructure such as roads, walkways, passenger rest houses, irrigation and gardens for small and remote villages far from the capital city of Madurai. Rani Mangammal was an accomplished and popular ruler, and her memory is still cherished in the countryside of the district. Mangammal specializes in civil administration, commerce and industry, irrigation and communications. Many irrigation channels were repaired, new roads were laid, and avenue trees were planted. The highway from Kanyakumari was originally built during the reign of Rani Mangammal, which was called 'Mangammal Road'. He also built many public works, especially for pilgrims. The Mangammal road which now passes through the village of Chatrapatti is called \"Vanniyampatti\" road. The 14 km long road connects the village of Chatrapatti to Srivilliputhur in the north and Mudukudi / Cholapuram in the south. This is the shortest route from Srivilliputhur to reach Sankarankovil/ Karivalamavantanallur. On the road was a Soultry (traveler's resting place - in Tamil it is called Chatra). The village derives its name from the Tamil word \"Sathram\" (a traveler's resting place) and \"Patti\" (suffix for a village). ==Climate== The village is a region of extreme heat and low humidity. The north east monsoon provides the bulk of rainfall during the months of October and November. Again the north east monsoon, which starts in June and lasting until mid August (Courtallam Season), provides showers and makes the region relatively cooler than in other months. ==Places== The village has Seven streets. They are: * North street * Middle Street * South Street * High School Street * Gnaniyar Koil Street * New Street * Vayakattu Street There is a huge bazaar in Middle street which remains filled with thousands of people in the evening as this place is the biggest marketplace east of Rajapalayam and there are two water storage dams namely 'vagaikulam' and 'kanakulam'. ==Education== The village people give a lot of importance to education.

The medium of instruction is Tamil. People go to Rajapalayam for English Medium Schools. Women's education has gained importance in the past few years due to economic reasons as wages from male members in the families of the society are not enough. == Mulaikottu & Thai Poosam == Mulaikottu is the famous festival in Chatrapatti.
