    "text": "Oh... Rosalinda!! is a 1955 British-German musical comedy film by the British director-writer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The film stars Michael Redgrave, Mel Ferrer, Anthony Quayle, Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina and Anton Walbrook and features Anneliese Rothenberger and Dennis Price. The film is based on the 1874 operetta Die Fledermaus (The Bat) by Johann Strauss, but updated to take place in post-war Vienna as occupied by the four Allied powers: the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the USSR. The music, played by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra under conductor Alois Melichar,TCM Music has new lyrics by Dennis Arundell, and professional singers dubbed for some of the actors. The choreography is by Alfred Rodrigues, and the production was designed by Hein Heckroth. Oh... Rosalinda!! is a light-hearted Technicolor romp that makes full use of the new CinemaScope process, and is not just a film of a staged production but a filmic operetta. As the film closes in the early hours at the party at the hotel Falke points the message to the representatives of the four powers, while thanking them for their presence: \"even the dearest friend loses his attraction if he overstays.... so if you don't mind, go home, please go home\"; at which the waltz \"Br\u00fcderlein, Br\u00fcderlein und Schwesterlein\"/\"Brothers, brothers and sisters\" ('Be my friend') starts up.Webber, Christopher. Opera on DVD and blu-ray : Oh \u2026 Rosalinda!!, after Johann Strauss. Opera, March 2020, Vol.71 No.3, p392-393. ==Plot== In 1955 Vienna, during its post-war occupation, the black-market dealer Dr. Falke (Anton Walbrook) moves freely through the French, British, American and Russian sectors, dealing in champagne and caviar amongst the highest echelons of the allied powers. After a costume party, French Colonel Gabriel Eisenstein (Michael Redgrave) plays a practical joke on a drunken Falke, depositing him, asleep and dressed as a bat, in the lap of a patriotic Russian statue, to be discovered the following morning by irate Russian soldiers. Falke is nearly arrested until his friend General Orlofsky (Anthony Quayle) of the USSR intervenes. A vengeful Falke plans an elaborate practical joke on his friend, involving Orlofsky, a British major (Dennis Price) who is sent to escort the French colonel to jail for his misdemeanor, Eisenstein's beautiful wife Rosalinda (Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina), her maid (Anneliese Rothenberger) and a masked ball where no one is what they seem. Complicating matters is American Captain Alfred Westerman (Mel Ferrer), an old flame of Rosalinda's who is determined to take advantage of her husband's absence deliberately taking the room next to hers. When Frank arrives to arrest Eisenstein he takes Alfred for her husband. At the party, Adele, wearing one of her mistress's gowns is spotted by Eisenstein, who is unable to do anything about it, and catches the eye of both Orlofsky and Frank. When the masked Rosalinda arrives Eisenstein pursues her but she flees with his watch \u2013 which Falke slyly tells him will reappear again at his home. At midnight Eisenstein presents himself at the jail but realizes that the man wearing his robe was courting Rosalinda, so he rushes home to confront her. She retorts by showing his the watch he had at the ball and he begs forgiveness. All this is overhead by the rest of Orlovsky's party guests in the gardens below and Falke admits that he was behind the charade. As all sing and dance, Alfred allows his American guards to arrest him instead of Einsenstein. ==Cast== {| width=\"67%\" |- | width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\" | *Anthony Quayle as General Orlovsky *Anton Walbrook as Dr. Falke *Dennis Price as Major Frank *Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina as Rosalinda *Michael Redgrave as Colonel Eisenstein *Mel Ferrer as Captain Alfred Westerman *Anneliese Rothenberger as Adele *Oskar Sima as Frosch *Richard Marner as Colonel Lebotov *Nicholas Bruce as Hotel receptionist *Arthur Mullard as Russian guard Singing voices: *S\u00e1ri Barab\u00e1s as Rosalinda *Alexander Young as Captain Alfred *Denis Dowling as Major Frank *Walter Berry as Dr. Falke | width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\" | Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina |} Cast notes: Among the ladies, gentlemen and dancers of the cast were John Schlesinger, Peter Darrell, Joyce Blair and Jill Ireland.BFI's Screenonline - full cast list.

Rosalinda was filmed at Elstree Studios in Boreham Wood, Hertfordshire and on location in London.IMDB Filming locations Powell and Pressburger had suffered through four box office disappointments in a row before this film, which is one reason that Bing Crosby, Maurice Chevalier and Orson Welles were approached about playing the roles of Alfred, Eisenstein and Orlovsky \u2013 however Oh... Rosalinda!! was not commercially successful.Angelini, Sergio Oh...Rosalinda!! (BFI Screen Online) Arundell had already worked with Powell and Pressburger, providing a translation for the film The Tales of Hoffmann.Milnes, Rodney. Obituary - Dennis Arundell. Opera, February 1989, Vol.40 No.2, p148-149. A reviewer of the 2019 Network British Film DVD restoration however notes Heckroth's \u201cstagey expressionism\u201d, \u201cdazzling cinematography aplenty\u201d, and suggests that it prefigures \u201cpolitical operetta deconstructions\u201d of more recent years. Several of the singing cast would later appear on stage and record in the original piece; Rothenberger and Barab\u00e1s together sang in excerpts from the operetta for Electrola around the time of the film, and Rothenberger made further full recordings under Hollreiser (1960), Danon (1964) and Boskovsky (1971), for the latter switching to Rosalinde. Walter Berry made five recordings of Fledermaus - singing Frank (1959, 1964, 1971) and Falke (1960, video 1980).\\- CAPON'S LISTS OF OPERA RECORDINGS (CLOR) 74 recordings of Die Fledermaus by Johann Strau\u00df II accessed 3 March 2020.
