The first game, entitled Badiya: Desert Survival, is a single-player sandbox survival RPGhttps://www.semaphorelab.com/badiya- desert-survival planned to be released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. An Early Access beta was launched via Steam on 11 November 2016.https://store.steampowered.com/app/545050/Badiya_Desert_Survival/ The second game, entitled Badiya: Battle Royale, is a multiplayer free-to-play battle royale online gamehttps://www.semaphorelab.com/badiya-battle-royale that has launched for iOS and Android devices in May 2020. ==Summary== The events of the game lie in the Arabian Desert in the 1920s, where the life is harsh, and players must explore and find the necessary supplies for survival. Although the desert is very vast, the players have the opportunity to discover the sites, villages, camps, ancient ruins, and are forced to deal with wildlife and residents of the area. ==Development== Badiya: Desert Survival, simply known as Badiya at the time, was originally announced by Semaphore in April 2016.Badiya Reveal Trailer - \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629 (23 April 2016) In an interview with Kill Screen, Semaphore's director of development Ahmad Jadallah hoped Semaphore's project would help clarify how the Arab world is represented in video games (as certain game titles by Western developers used stereotype and poorly researched interpretations), and explain the history of modern Saudi Arabia's unification, although the game will focus on an individual's survival in the desert amid the violence during that time period following instability after the end of the Great War. Using the game's infinite procedural generation, individual players may have unique gameplay experiences. Gameplay for Badiya was revealed during E3 2016. The game was originally announced for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows, and that an Early Access beta would be available via Steam later that year. Despite still being in Early Access, Badiya was retronymed with the subtitle Desert Survival when Semaphore announced Badiya: Battle Royale in April 2019.Badiya Battle Royale - Reveal Trailer (11 April 2019) Although it shares much of the same settings and content, Battle Royale is a separate build from Desert Survival that focuses on free-for-all online battle royale gameplay. Battle Royale officially launched for iOS and Android devices worldwide on 19 May 2020, with plans to release the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in the future. Badiya: Desert Survival is made with the Unity engine, whilst Badiya: Battle Royale is based on Unreal Engine 4. ==See also== * Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta \u2013 a 2013 game by the same company. == References == ==External links== * * * Desert Survival on Steam * Category:2020 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Battle royale games Category:Early access video games Category:First- person shooters Category:Free-to-play video games Category:iOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Open world video games Category:Survival video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Upcoming video games Category:Video games set in Saudi Arabia Category:Video games set in the 1920s Category:Video games developed in Saudi Arabia Category:Windows games ",
