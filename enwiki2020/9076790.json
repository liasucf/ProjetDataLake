    "text": "Chance is Manfred Mann's Earth Band's tenth album, released in 1980. The album cover art was an adaptation of Danish artist Ole Kortzau's poster \"Strandstole\" (deck chairs). The album marked the temporary return of guitarist and founding member Mick Rogers to the band. John Lingwood replaced drummer Geoff Britton, who left due to illness. It is also the last album that bassist Pat King appeared on. ==Track listing== ===Side one=== #\"Lies (Through the 80s)\" (Denny Newman) \u2013 4:37 #\"On the Run\" (Manfred Mann, Tony Ashton, Florrie Palmer) \u2013 3:53 #\"For You\" (Bruce Springsteen) \u2013 5:41 #\"Adolescent Dream\" (Mann) \u2013 2:42 #\"Fritz the Blank\" (Mann) \u2013 2:52 ===Side two=== # * \"Stranded\" (Mike Heron, Mann) \u2013 5:49 #\"Hello, I Am Your Heart\" (Dennis Linde) \u2013 5:19 #\"No Guarantee\" (Mann) \u2013 3:50 #\"Heart on the Street\" (Tom Gray) \u2013 4:56 ===Bonus Tracks (1999 CD re-issue)=== # * \"A Fool I Am\" (single B side) (Mann, Pat King, John Lingwood, Steve Waller) \u2013 4:16 #\"Adolescent Dream\" (single version) (Mann) \u2013 2:24 #\"Lies (Through the 80s)\" (single version) (Newman) \u2013 4:15 #\"For You\" (single version) (Springsteen) \u2013 3:53 == Charts == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1981) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|42 |} ==Personnel== ===The Earth Band=== * Manfred Mann \u2013 keyboards, vocals (\"Adolescent Dream\") * John Lingwood \u2013 drums * Pat King \u2013 bass, bass pedals * Mick Rogers \u2013 guitars * Steve Waller \u2013 guitars, vocals (\"This Is Your Heart\") * Chris Thompson \u2013 vocals (\"Lies Through The 80s\", \"On The Run\", \"For You\"; co-lead vocals on \"Stranded\") ===Additional musicians=== * Trevor Rabin \u2013 guitars * Robbie McIntosh \u2013 guitars * Geoff Whitehorn \u2013 guitars * Barbara Thompson \u2013 saxophone * Dyan Birch \u2013 vocals (\"No Guarantee\" and others) * Willy Finlayson \u2013 vocals (\"Heart On The Street\") * Peter Marsh \u2013 vocals (\"Stranded\") * Carol Stocker \u2013 backing vocals ===Technical=== * Manfred Mann \u2013 producer * Trevor Rabin \u2013 producer * Bernie Clarke \u2013 co-producer (Portugal) * Rik Walton \u2013 engineer * David Barratt, Edwin Cross, Laurie Latham, Robert Stewart \u2013 assistant engineers * Peter Schwier, Tim Summerhayes \u2013 assistant engineers (Portugal) * Martin Poole \u2013 design * Ole Kortzau \u2013 cover art ==References== ==External links== * Category:Manfred Mann's Earth Band albums Category:1980 albums Category:Albums produced by Trevor Rabin Category:Bronze Records albums Category:Warner Records albums ",
