    "text": "The Bradlee-McIntyre House is a Victorian Cottage Style house. It is now located in Longwood, Florida at 130 West Warren Avenue, after being moved there from Altamonte Springs. On March 28, 1991, the house was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Bradlee-McIntyre House was built circa 1885 for noted Boston architect Nathaniel Jeremiah Bradlee and family. It is the only surviving \"cottage\" in Orange and Seminole counties, a Queen Anne Style three-story, 13-room winter vacation house featuring an octagonal tower and \"ginger-bread\" trim typical of the flamboyant houses of the Victorian Period. Currently the Bradlee-McIntyre House is open to the public for tours on scheduled days as posted at the house. Museum tours are offered the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays and Sundays from 1-4 pm. ==References== ==External links== * Seminole County listings at National Register of Historic Places * Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs ** Seminole County listings ** Bradlee-McIntyre House * Longwood Historical Trail at Historic Hiking Trails Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Florida Category:National Register of Historic Places in Seminole County, Florida Category:Houses in Seminole County, Florida Category:1880s establishments in Florida Category:Queen Anne architecture in Florida Category:Longwood, Florida ",
