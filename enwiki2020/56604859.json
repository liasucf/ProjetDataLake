Lead single \"Strike\" was a minor hit in Canada, reaching #47 on the RPM charts. The second single, \"Special Girl\", was a top 20 hit on the Canadian Adult Contemporary charts. \"Special Girl\" became much better known in the U.S. for its near-simultaneous cover by the group America, whose version became a U.S. hit in September 1984. In the U.K., the song was a minor hit for Meat Loaf in early 1987. ==Track listing== ;A Side ;B Side ==Chart performance== ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1984 |rowspan=\"1\"|\"Strike\" |rowspan=\"1\"|RPM (Canada) Top 50 |align=\"center\"|47 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|\"Special Girl\" |rowspan=\"1\"|RPM (Canada) Adult Contemporary |align=\"center\"|20 |} ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. *Eddie Schwartz \u2013 lead vocals, background vocals, guitar *David Tyson \u2013 keyboards, bass, glockenspiel, background vocals *Rick Derringer \u2013 guitar solos *Peter Follett \u2013 guitar solos *Gary Craig \u2013 drums *Jimmy Bralower \u2013 drums ;Production team *Eddie Schwartz, David Tyson, Tony Bongiovi \u2013 producers ==References== Category:Eddie Schwartz albums Category:1984 albums Category:Warner_Music_Group_albums ",
