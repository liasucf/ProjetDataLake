In Canada, the DCT6412 is generally owned by the subscriber, purchased from their cable company or retail outlets such as Future Shop and Best Buy. The DVR can record two analog, digital, or High-definition television channels at once and play back a recorded show at the same time. The 6412 has a 120 gigabyte hard drive giving it an HDTV recording time of 12-20 hours and much more for analog or SD digital TV. There is also a 6416 model with a 160 gigabyte drive. The Motorola DCT3412 is similar to the Phase III 6412, but has no analog tuner and can only be used on cable systems where analog-digital simulcasting (ADS) is set up. The QIP6412 (or QIP6416) is similar to the Phase III 6412, and is used with services such as Verizon FiOS. ==See also== How to use a Motorola DVR, on WikiBooks Category:Digital video recorders DCT6412 Category:Set-top box ",
