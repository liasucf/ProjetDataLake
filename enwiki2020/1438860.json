    "text": "This biometric symbol is usually printed on the cover of biometric passports. A biometric passport (also known as an e-passport, ePassport, or a digital passport) is a traditional passport that has an embedded electronic microprocessor chip which contains biometric information that can be used to authenticate the identity of the passport holder. It uses contactless smart card technology, including a microprocessor chip (computer chip) and antenna (for both power to the chip and communication) embedded in the front or back cover, or centre page, of the passport. The passport's critical information is printed on the data page of the passport, repeated on the machine readable lines and stored in the chip. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is used to authenticate the data stored electronically in the passport chip, making it expensive and difficult to forge when all security mechanisms are fully and correctly implemented. Many countries are moving towards issuing biometric passports to their citizens. Malaysia was the first country to issue biometric passports in 1998. In December 2008, 60 countries were issuing such passports, which increased to 120 by June 2017. The currently standardised biometrics used for this type of identification system are facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, and iris recognition. These were adopted after assessment of several different kinds of biometrics including retinal scan. Document and chip characteristics are documented in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Doc 9303 (ICAO9303). The ICAO defines the biometric file formats and communication protocols to be used in passports. Only the digital image (usually in JPEG or JPEG2000 format) of each biometric feature is actually stored in the chip. The comparison of biometric features is performed outside the passport chip by electronic border control systems (e-borders). To store biometric data on the contactless chip, it includes a minimum of 32 kilobytes of EEPROM storage memory, and runs on an interface in accordance with the ISO/IEC 14443 international standard, amongst others. These standards intend interoperability between different countries and different manufacturers of passport books. Some national identity cards, such as those from the Netherlands, Albania and Brazil, are fully ICAO9303 compliant biometric travel documents. However others, such as the United States Passport Card, are not. ==Data protection== Biometric passports have protection mechanisms to avoid and/or detect attacks: ; Non-traceable chip characteristics: Random chip identifiers reply to each request with a different chip number. This prevents tracing of passport chips. Using random identification numbers is optional. ; Basic Access Control (BAC): BAC protects the communication channel between the chip and the reader by encrypting transmitted information. Before data can be read from a chip, the reader needs to provide a key which is derived from the Machine Readable Zone: the date of birth, the date of expiry and the document number. If BAC is used, an attacker cannot (easily) eavesdrop transferred information without knowing the correct key. Using BAC is optional. ; Passive Authentication (PA): PA is aimed at identifying modification of passport chip data. The chip contains a file, Document Security Object (SOD), that stores hash values of all files stored in the chip (picture, fingerprint, etc.) and a digital signature of these hashes. The digital signature is made using a document signing key which itself is signed by a country signing key. If a file in the chip (e.g., the picture) is changed, this can be detected since the hash value is incorrect. Readers need access to all used public country keys to check whether the digital signature is generated by a trusted country. Using PA is mandatory. According to a September 2011 United States Central Intelligence Agency document released by WikiLeaks in December 2014, \"Although falsified e-passports will not have the correct digital signature, inspectors may not detect the fraud if the passports are from countries that do not participate in the International Civil Aviation Organization's Public Key Directory (ICAO PKD). As of January 2017, 55 of over 60 e-passport-issuing countries belong to the PKD program. ; Active Authentication (AA): AA prevents cloning of passport chips. The chip contains a private key that cannot be read or copied, but its existence can easily be proven. Using AA is optional. ; Extended Access Control (EAC): EAC adds functionality to check the authenticity of both the chip (chip authentication) and the reader (terminal authentication). Furthermore, it uses stronger encryption than BAC. EAC is typically used to protect fingerprints and iris scans. Using EAC is optional. In the European Union, using EAC is mandatory for all documents issued starting 28 June 2009. ; Supplemental Access Control (SAC): SAC was introduced by ICAO in 2009 for addressing BAC weaknesses. It was introduced as a supplement to BAC (for keeping compatibility), but will replace it in the future. ; Shielding the chip: This prevents unauthorised reading. Some countries \u2013 including at least the US \u2013 have integrated a very thin metal mesh into the passport's cover to act as a shield when the passport cover is closed. The use of shielding is optional. To assure interoperability and functionality of the security mechanisms listed above, ICAO and German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) have specified several test cases. These test specifications are updated with every new protocol and are covering details starting from the paper used and ending in the chip that is included. ==Attacks== Since the introduction of biometric passports, several attacks have been presented and demonstrated. ; Non- traceable chip characteristics : In 2008 a Radboud/Lausitz University team demonstrated that it's possible to determine which country a passport chip is from without knowing the key required for reading it. The team fingerprinted error messages of passport chips from different countries. The resulting lookup table allows an attacker to determine from where a chip originated. In 2010 Tom Chothia and Vitaliy Smirnov documented an attack that allows an individual passport to be traced, by sending specific BAC authentication requests. In 2016 Avoine et al. published a survey on security and privacy issues in passport protocols, where a new technique to track passports is introduced, based on the response time of basic commands. ; Basic Access Control (BAC) : In 2005 Marc Witteman showed that the document numbers of Dutch passports were predictable, allowing an attacker to guess/crack the key required for reading the chip. In 2006 Adam Laurie wrote software that tries all known passport keys within a given range, thus implementing one of Witteman's attacks. Using online flight booking sites, flight coupons and other public information it's possible to significantly reduce the number of possible keys. In some early biometric passports BAC wasn't used at all, allowing attacker to read the chip's content without providing a key. ; Passive Authentication (PA) : In 2006 Lukas Grunwald demonstrated that it is trivial to copy passport data from a passport chip into a standard ISO/IEC 14443 smartcard using a standard contactless card interface and a simple file transfer tool. Grunwald used a passport that did not use Active Authentication (anti-cloning) and did not change the data held on the copied chip, thus keeping its cryptographic signature valid. : In 2008 Jeroen van Beek demonstrated that not all passport inspection systems check the cryptographic signature of a passport chip. For his demonstration Van Beek altered chip information and signed it using his own document signing key of a non-existing country. This can only be detected by checking the country signing keys that are used to sign the document signing keys. To check country signing keys the ICAO PKD can be used. Only 5 out of 60+ countries are using this central database. Van Beek did not update the original passport chip: instead an ePassport emulator was used. : Also in 2008, The Hacker's Choice implemented all attacks and published code to verify the results. The release included a video clip that demonstrated problems by using a forged Elvis Presley passport that is recognized as a valid US passport. ; Active Authentication (AA) : In 2005 Marc Witteman showed that the secret Active Authentication key can be retrieved using power analysis. This may allow an attacker to clone passport chips that use the optional Active Authentication anti-cloning mechanism on chips \u2013 if the chip design is susceptible to this attack. : In 2008 Jeroen van Beek demonstrated that optional security mechanisms can be disabled by removing their presence from the passport index file. This allows an attacker to remove \u2013 amongst others \u2013 anti-cloning mechanisms (Active Authentication). The attack is documented in supplement 7 of Doc 9303 (R1-p1_v2_sIV_0006)accessdate April 26, 2009 and can be solved by patching inspection system software. Note that supplement 7 features vulnerable examples in the same document that \u2013 when implemented \u2013 result in a vulnerable inspection process. : In 2014 Calderoni et al. show a procedure to bypass the security protocol that is commonly adopted to prove chip authenticity (Active Authentication) within first-generation electronic passports. The discussed breach is related to some metadata files (EF.COM, EF.SOD) and allows the attacker to conceal those data required by the inspection system during the protocol's execution. This breach may facilitate a malicious user in using fake documents cloned from original ones. ; Extended Access Control (EAC) : In 2007 Lukas Grunwald presented an attack that can make EAC-enabled passport chips unusable. Grunwald states that if an EAC-key \u2013 required for reading fingerprints and updating certificates \u2013 is stolen or compromised, an attacker can upload a false certificate with an issue date far in the future. The affected chips block read access until the future date is reached. ==Opposition== Privacy proponents in many countries question and protest the lack of information about exactly what the passports' chip will contain, and whether they impact civil liberties. The main problem they point out is that data on the passports can be transferred with wireless RFID technology, which can become a major vulnerability. Although this could allow ID-check computers to obtain a person's information without a physical connection, it may also allow anyone with the necessary equipment to perform the same task. If the personal information and passport numbers on the chip are not encrypted, the information might wind up in the wrong hands. On 15 December 2006, the BBC published an article on the British ePassport, citing the above stories and adding that: :\"Nearly every country issuing this passport has a few security experts who are yelling at the top of their lungs and trying to shout out: 'This is not secure. This is not a good idea to use this technology'\", citing a specialist who states \"It is much too complicated. It is in places done the wrong way round \u2013 reading data first, parsing data, interpreting data, then verifying whether it is right. There are lots of technical flaws in it and there are things that have just been forgotten, so it is basically not doing what it is supposed to do. It is supposed to get a higher security level. It is not.\" and adding that the Future of Identity in the Information Society (FIDIS) network's research team (a body of IT security experts funded by the European Union) has \"also come out against the ePassport scheme... [stating that] European governments have forced a document on its people that dramatically decreases security and increases the risk of identity theft.\"Budapest Declaration on Machine Readable Travel Documents, FIDIS NoE, Budapest, September 2006 Most security measures are designed against untrusted citizens (the \"provers\"), but the scientific security community recently also addressed the threats from untrustworthy verifiers, such as corrupt governmental organizations, or nations using poorly implemented, unsecure electronic systems. New cryptographic solutions such as private biometrics are being proposed to mitigate threats of mass theft of identity. These are under scientific study, but not yet implemented in biometric passports. ==Countries using biometric passports== Availability of biometric passports as of mid 2019 ===European Union=== It was planned that, except for Denmark and Ireland, EU passports would have digital imaging and fingerprint scan biometrics placed on their RFID chips. This combination of biometrics aims to create an unrivaled level of security and protection against fraudulent identification papers. Technical specifications for the new passports have been established by the European Commission.EC News article about the relevant regulations: Council Regulation (EC) 2252/2004, Commission Decision C(2005)409 adopted on 28 February 2005 and Commission Decision C(2006)2909 adopted on 28 June 2006 The specifications are binding for the Schengen agreement parties, i.e. the EU countries, except Ireland and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries\u2014Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 of 13 December 2004, see preamble 10\u201314 These countries are obliged to implement machine readable facial images in the passports by 28 August 2006, and fingerprints by 29 June 2009. The European Data Protection Supervisor has stated that the current legal framework fails to \"address all the possible and relevant issues triggered by the inherent imperfections of biometric systems\".Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States, 6 August 2008 Irish biometric passports only used a digital image and not fingerprinting. German passports printed after 1 November 2007 contain two fingerprints, one from each hand, in addition to a digital photograph. Romanian passports will also contain two fingerprints, one from each hand. The Netherlands also takes fingerprints and washttps://www.security.nl/posting/32771/Donner+stopt+opslag+vingerafdruk+paspoort the only EU member that had plans to store these fingerprints centrally. According to EU requirements, only nations that are signatories to the Schengen acquis are required to add fingerprint biometrics.

E-passports cost to with all taxes included. The cost varies depending on the number of pages and the validity of the e-passport. The e-passport is valid for either five years or ten years depending on the age of the applicant. Bangladesh is the first country in South Asia to issue e-passports for all eligible citizens. The electronic microprocessor chip embedded e-passport has forty-one different security features, including holographic images embossed in thin film laminate, which change colour under light and appear to move. Demographic and biometric information of the bearer including the fingerprints of all ten fingers, iris scan, color photograph of the face and digital signature are stored on the chip in the e-passport. The Government of Bangladesh issues three different types of e-passports. These are diplomatic passports with a red cover; official passports with a blue cover; and regular or ordinary passports with a green cover. ===Bosnia and Herzegovina=== Issued since 15 October 2009 and costing 50 KM (\u20ac25.65). Valid 10 years for adults and 5 years for younger than 18. On 1 June 2010 Bosnia and Herzegovina issued its first EAC passport. ===Bolivia=== Issued since 1 February 2019 and costing 550 BOB (USD79.13). Valid 6 years. The Bolivian ePassport has the same functions as the other biometric passports as regulations from OASI. ===Botswana=== Issued since 8 March 2010. ===Brazil=== Issued since December 2006. However, just in December 2010 it began to issue passports with microchips, first in the capital Bras\u00edlia and Goi\u00e1s state. Since the end of January 2011, this last is available to be issued all over Brazil. Valid for 10 years for adults and costs R$156.07 (approximately \u20ac35).

Valid for 5 years. ===China=== On 30 January 2011, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China launched a trial issuance of e-passports for public affairs. The face, fingerprint and other biometric features of the passport holder will be digitalized and stored in pre-installed contactless smart chip in the passport. On 1 July 2011, the Ministry began issuing biometric passports to all individuals conducting public affairs work overseas on behalf of the Chinese government. Ordinary biometric passports have been introduced by the Ministry of Public Security starting from 15 May 2012. The cost of a passport is 200 CNY (approximately US$31) for first time applicants in China and 220 CNY (or US$35) for renewals and passports issued abroad. Effective from 1 July 2017, cost of a biometric ordinary passport is reduced to 160 CNY (approximately US$24) for both first time applicants and renewal applicants. As of April 2017, China had issued over 100 million biometric ordinary passports. ===Colombia=== Issued since 1 September 2015, costing COP 166.000 (approx. US$51). ===Dominican Republic=== Issued since May 2004. However the Dominican biometric passports do not carry the \"chip inside\" symbol 20px. In January 2010, the cost of the passport was 1,250 DOP, about US$35\u201340 at that date. ===Ecuador=== Issued since 14 September 2020. ===Egypt=== Issued since 5 February 1991. ===Fiji=== Issued since 19 September 2019. ===Finland=== Issued since 21 August 2006. ===Gabon=== Issued since 23 January 2014. ===Georgia=== Issued since 2010. Valid for 10 years to adults, costing 100 Lari if issued at tenth business day. The same day issuance will cost 205 Lari. Price of the photo (3 Lari) needs to be paid additionally. There are discounts, e.g. 50% discount for persons under age of 18. ===Ghana=== Issued since 1 March 2010 and costing GH\u00a2 50.00\u2013100.00 for adults and children. The passports contain several other technological characteristics other than biometric technology. However the Ghanaian biometric passports do not carry the \"chip inside\" symbol (20px), which is mandatory for ICAO-standard electronic passports. ===Hong Kong=== In 2006, the Immigration Department announced that Unihub Limited (a PCCW subsidiary company heading a consortium of suppliers, including Keycorp) had won the tender to provide the technology to produce biometric passports. In February 2007, the first biometric passport was introduced. The cover of the new biometric passport remains essentially the same as that of previous versions, with the addition of the \"electronic passport\" logo at the bottom. However, the design of the inner pages has changed substantially. The design conforms with the document design recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization. The new ePassport featured in the 2008 Stockholm Challenge Event and was a finalist for the Stockholm Challenge Award in the Public Administration category. The Hong Kong SAR ePassport design was praised on account of the \"multiple state-of-the-art technologies [which] are seamlessly integrated in the sophisticated Electronic Passport System (e-Passport System)\". The cost for a HKSAR passport is HK$370 (or US$48) for a 32-page passport and HK$460 (or US$59) for a 48-page passport. ===Iceland=== Issued since 23 May 2006 and costing ISK5100 (ISK1900 for under 18 and over 67). ===India=== The Government of India issues three different types of passports \u2013 Diplomatic passports; Official passports; and regular or ordinary passports. India initiated the first phase deployment of Biometric e-Passport only for all diplomatic passport holders in India and abroad in 2008. The new passports have been designed indigenously by the Central Passport Organization, the India Security Press, Nashik and IIT Kanpur. The passport contains a security chip with personal data and digital images. Initially, the new passports will have a 64KB chip with a photograph of passport holder and subsequently include the holder's fingerprint(s). The biometric passport has been tested with passport readers abroad and is noted to have a 4-second response time \u2013 less than that of a US Passport (10 seconds). The passport need not be carried in a metal jacket for security reasons as it first needs to be passed through a reader, after which it generates access keys to unlock the chip data for reader access. On 25 June 2008 Indian Passport Authority issued the first e-passport to Pratibha Patil the President of India at the time. The e-passport project is under the first phase of deployment and will be initially restricted to diplomatic passport holders only. In mid 2019, the Government of India floated a three-stage international tender for the manufacture of e-passports for ordinary Indian citizens. Once the tendering and procurement process is complete, the government hopes to start issuing e-passports for ordinary Indian citizens sometime in the coming years. ===Indonesia=== Issued since 26 January 2011. The passport costs Rp655,000 ($66) for the 48-page valid for 5 years, and Rp405,000 ($41) for the 24-page passport valid for 5 years. ===Iran=== Issued since July 2007 for diplomatic and service passports, 20 February 2011 for ordinary biometric passports. The cost of a new passport was approximately 1,500,000IRR (less than 8 USD) if issued inside iran, 100 Euro if issued overseas. ===Iraq=== Issued since 1 February 2010, costing 25,000 dinars or about USD20. ===Ireland=== Issued since 16 October 2006. ===Israel=== Issued since July 2013 for a 2-year pilot project under the Biometric Database Law. This was optional. In August 2013, any passport expiring in more than 2 years could be replaced free of charge with a biometric one upon request. Passports expiring within 2 years were charged the full fee. The review of the pilot project (that was supposed to be concluded in 2015) was postponed by order of the Minister of the Interior to a later date, due to the controversy regarding the creation of the Biometric Database rather than storing the biometric data only in the passport's chip, as is the practice in many other countries. In 2015, the duration of the pilot project was extended until 2017. In May 2017, the pilot project ended. Newly issued passports were then required to be biometric. To obtain a biometric passport, an applicant must appear in an Interior Ministry office \"to be photographed by the special camera which records information such as facial bone structure, distance between one's eyes, ears to eyes and ratio of facial features one from another. The applicant will also be fingerprinted and all this information will be stored in the new high-tech electronic passport.\"Jewish News: The Yeshiva World, Israel Moving to Biometric Passport. ===Japan=== Issued since March 2006.

However, the chip is large enough (64 kilobytes) for inclusion of biometric identifiers. The U.S. Department of State first issued these passports in 2006, and since August 2007 issues biometric passports only. Non-biometric passports are valid until their expiration dates. Although a system able to perform a facial-recognition match between the bearer and his or her image stored on the contactless chip is desired, it is unclear when such a system will be deployed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at its ports of entry. A high level of security became a priority for the United States after the attacks of 11 September 2001. High security required cracking down on counterfeit passports. In October 2004, the production stages of this high-tech passport commenced as the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) issued awards to the top bidders of the program. The awards totaled to roughly $1,000,000 for startup, development, and testing. The driving force of the initiative is the U.S. Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the \"Border Security Act\"), which states that such smartcard identity cards will be able to replace visas. As for foreigners travelling to the U.S., if they wish to enter U.S. visa-free under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), they are now required to possess machine-readable passports that comply with international standards. Additionally, for travellers holding a valid passport issued on or after 26 October 2006, such a passport must be a biometric passport if used to enter the U.S. visa-free under the VWP.
