    "text": "This is a list of numbered county roads in Perth County, Ontario. For civic- addressing purposes (such as 911), nearly all rural roads in Perth County are numbered. Roads that run east and west, or southeast and northwest, are numbered \"Line 1\", \"Line 2\", and so on to \"Line 93\". Roads that run north and south, or northeast and southwest, are numbered \"Road 101\", \"Road 102\", and so on to \"Road 183\". The roads maintained by the County are numbered in accordance with this scheme; for example, \"Perth Line 9\" is the section of Line 9 that the county maintains, and \"Perth Road 151\" is the section of Road 151 that the county maintains. ==Main List== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" | Distance ! scope=\"col\" | Terminus ! scope=\"col\" | Terminus ! scope=\"col\" | Cities it passes by ! scope=\"col\" | Paved |- !scope=\"row\" | |11.41 km |NW Junction Highway 23 in Kirkton |SE Junction Perth Road 163 north of Rannoch |Kirkton |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |3.68 km |NW Eastern boundary of St. Marys |SE Junction Highway 7 (Road 119) |St. Marys |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |27.1 km |W Junction Huron CR 83 |SE Junction Highway 7 (Road 119) |Russeldale, Fullarton, St. Pauls Station |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |14.3 km |NW Junction Thames Road |SE Junction Highway 23 (Road 164) |Staffa |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |13.5 km |W Junction Highway 7 (Road 119) |E Tavistock |Harmony, Tavistock |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |4.1 km |NW Junction Perth Road 130 |SE Stratford boundary | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |9.4 km |W Junction Romeo Street, Stratford |E Junction Perth Road 107 |Stratford |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |1.7 km |NW Junction Perth Road 122 |SE Junction Perth Road 119 north of Stratford |Stratford |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |5.3 km |W Junction Romeo Street, Stratford |E Brocksden; junction Road 109 | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |15.9 km |W Junction Perth Road 119 |E Perth-Waterloo boundary |Amulree |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |28.6 km |NW Junction Perth Road 180 |SE Junction Perth Road 119 |Brodhagen, Bronholm |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |20.5 km |NW Junction Perth Road 180 |SE Junction Perth Road 119 |Monkton |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | (Waterloo RR 7) |8 km |NW Junction Perth Road 119 |SE Junction Road 105 |Topping, Nithburg |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |26.1 km |NW Junction Road 173 (Huron-Perth boundary) |SE Junction Road 116 |Newry, Donegal, Millbank |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |29.8 km |NW Junction Perth Road 178 |SE Junction Road 116 at Dorking |Molesworth, Listowel, Dorking |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |9 km |NW Perth Road 178 |SE Highway 23 |Mayne Corners, Kurtzville, Shipley, Gowanstown |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |4.5 km |NW Toronto Street |SE Junction Perth Road 140 |Palmerston |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | (Wellington CR 123) |5.7 km |NW Toronto Street |SE Junction Perth Road 140 (Wellington CR 9) |Palmerston, Teviotdale |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | (Oxford CR 24, Waterloo RR 1) |1.8 km |SW Tavistock |NE Junction Highway 7 & 8 (Line 34) |Tavistock |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |18.3 km |S Tavistock |N Junction Perth Line 56 (Waterloo RR 7) |Tavistock, Shakespeare, Amulree |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |4.1 km |S Junction Perth Line 26 |N Stratford city limits | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |7.6 km |S Junction Perth/Oxford Road |N Junction Highway 7 (Road 119) | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |2.1 km |S Junction Highway 7 (Elginfield Road) and Oxford CR 119 |N Junction Perth Line 9 | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |20.6 km |S Stratford city limits |N Junction Perth Line 55 and Perth Road 131 |Gadshill |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | (James Street South) |1.2 km |S Junction Highway 7 (Elginfield Road) |N St. Marys town limits | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |19.1 km |SW Junction Perth Line 55 |NE Junction Perth Line 86 (Wellington CR 86) |Millbank, Hesson |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | (Oloane Street) |2.2 km |SW Junction Highway 8 (Line 34), Stratford |NE Junction Perth Line 36 |Stratford |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |1.6 km |S Junction Highway 7 (Elginfield Road) |N St. Marys town limits | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |16.2 km |S St. Marys town limits |NE Junction Highway 8 (Line 34) |Avonton |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |17.2 km |SW Junction Perth Line 55 and Perth Road 119 |NE Junction Perth Line 86 (Wellington CR 86) |Milverton |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |16.5 km |SW Sebringville |NE Junction Perth Line 55 |Rostock, Wartburg |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |9 km |SW Prospect Hill |E St. Marys | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | (Wellington CR 9) |18.6 km |SW Junction Perth Line 86 (Wellington CR 86) |NE Junction Perth Line 93 (Wellington CR 123) |Teviotdale |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |10.2 km |SW Junction Perth Line 72 |NE Junction Perth Line 86 |Donegal, Britton |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |7.8 km |SW Junction Whalen Line |NE Junction Perth Line 8 | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | |20.6 km |S Rannoch |N Junction Highway 23 (Road 164) | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | (Huron CR 34, Wellington CR 4) |19.4 km |W Junction Perth Line 86 |E Junction Highway 23 (Road 164) | |Yes |- !scope=\"row\" | (Huron CR 14) |30.3 km |SW Junction Line 17 |NE Junction Perth Line 55 (Huron CR 25) | |Yes |} Reference: Minutillo, Carmine.
