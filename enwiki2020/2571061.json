In both finals he lost to fellow British player Arthur Gore. Caridia reached the singles semifinals of Wimbledon in 1903 (losing in four sets to Major Ritchie) and the quarterfinals in 1904 and 1909. Caridia was reportedly best on covered courts which suited his strong half- volley, he won the Welsh Covered Court Championships nine times between 1899 and 1909, playing at Craigside, Llandudno, Wales for 20 consecutive years. Caridia later became a member of the committee of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Association.
