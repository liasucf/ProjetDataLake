He became the political editor of Valeurs actuelles in 2015 and its editor-in-chief in 2016. He became the youngest editor-in-chief in France. As editor, he covered the whole spectrum of right-wing politics, from the far right to the centre right. He also hired several young journalists, with a focus on investigative journalism. In April 2017, he derided Le Monde, France's left-wing newspaper of record, for launching Decodex, a fact-checking app, and he suggested Valeurs actuelles should start fact-checking Le Monde. Lejeune is the author of a political novel in which conservative essayist \u00c9ric Zemmour is elected as the President of France. ==Works== * ==References== Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:French male journalists Category:21st-century French journalists Category:French male novelists Category:21st-century French novelists Category:21st-century French male writers Category:\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de journalisme de Paris alumni Category:People from Avignon ",
