The station first signed on the air on August 13, 1975 as an affiliate of the Spanish International Network (the predecessor of Univision), broadcasting on UHF channel 60; it was the Bay Area's first exclusively Spanish-language television station. It was originally owned by a local group headed by Spanish International Network executive Reynold Anselmo. In 1979, KDTV reached a deal with San Mateo-based PBS member station KCSM-TV (now KPJK, an independent non-commercial educational station) to transfer its full-power color facilities to that station; on March 5 of that year, KCSM and KDTV swapped transmitting facilities and channel assignments: KCSM moved to channel 60 and began transmitting from atop San Bruno Mountain's Radio Peak, while KDTV moved to UHF channel 14 and began transmitting from Mission Peak. KDTV was acquired by Univision outright in 1992, turning KDTV into the market's third owned-and- operated station (behind KGO-TV, channel 7, which has been owned by ABC since it signed on in 1949, and KSTS, channel 48, which has been owned by Telemundo since 1987). In 2016, the station moved into a new, state-of-the-art studio facility in San Jose to reduce the cost of doing business (which had become prohibitive in the city of San Francisco) and increase its focus on the expanding Hispanic population to the south in Santa Clara County. The station retains a smaller bureau in San Francisco covering news in the city, along with the northern and eastern portions of the region.Univision to move its Bay Area headquarters to San Jose from San Francisco San Jose Mercury News.

Enrique Gratas, former anchor of Univision's late night newscast Noticiero Univision \u00daltima Hora, was the original anchor of KDTV's newscasts when the station launched. In November 2007, KDTV had the highest-rated newscast in the Bay Area among adults 25 to 54 in the 6 p.m. timeslot. This was the first occurrence in the market in which a Spanish-language news program earned higher ratings than those of its English-language counterparts. In November 2011, KDTV introduced a new set, as well as standardized graphics package used by its Univision-owned news- producing sister stations. With the change, KDTV began broadcasting its local newscasts in 16:9 widescreen standard definition. On August 8, 2014 the station struck a news partnership with KGO-TV to share news content and cross- promote its newscasts. KDTV is the second Univision station to have a partnership with an ABC station, following a similar arrangement between Philadelphia sister station WUVP-TV and WPVI-TV. ==References== ==External links== *Official website (in Spanish) *https://web.archive.org/web/20140814055335/http://corporate.univision.com/2014/08/abc- kgo-tv-and-univision-kdtv-tv-work-together-to-better-serve-the-bay-area/ *Query the FCC's TV station database for KDTV-DT *Query the FCC's TV station database for KDTV-CD * Category:Univision network affiliates Category:GetTV affiliates Category:Court TV Mystery affiliates Category:Television channels and stations established in 1975 Category:1975 establishments in California Category:Peabody Award winners DTV-DT Category:Television in San Jose, California DTV-DT ",
