He previously served as Minister of the Interior in 2011. ==Early life, education and professional life== Born in Sousse in 1949, Essid received his master's degree in economics from Tunis University and added a masters programme in agricultural economics from the University of Minnesota. He started his career in the public sector, notably in the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1993, he was named cabinet director at the Ministry of Agriculture, remaining in that post until 1997. He later served as cabinet director at the Ministry of the Interior. In 2001, he was appointed as Secretary of State for Fishing and later on as Secretary of State for the Environment. From 2004 to 2010, Habib Essid was Executive Director of the International Olive Council, headquartered in Madrid. After the Tunisian Revolution, he was appointed as Minister of the Interior in the government of Prime Minister Beji Caid Essebsi on 28 March 2011.

Initially, he formed a government composed of two political parties: Nidaa Tounes and the Free Patriotic Union.
