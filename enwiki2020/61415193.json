    "text": "In the 1924 season of the Campeonato Carioca, two championships were disputed, each by a different league. == AMEA Championship == After Vasco da Gama's title in 1923, the larger clubs within LMDT attempted to pressure Vasco da Gama to exclude twelve black players from their team, accusing them of being professionals. When Vasco refused and LMDT took Vasco's side, these clubs split from the league and founded AMEA (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Metropolitana de Esportes Atl\u00e9ticos, or Metropolitan Athletic Sports Association); Most of the clubs that had been participating in the S\u00e9rie A joined the league, with the addition of SC Brasil, from S\u00e9rie B, and the recently-promoted Hell\u00eanico. The league at the time also had CBD's official backing. The edition of the Campeonato Carioca organized by AMEA kicked off on May 4, 1924 and ended on October 19, 1924. Eight teams participated, Fluminense won the championship for the 9th time. no teams were relegated. === Participating teams === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Club !! Home location !!
