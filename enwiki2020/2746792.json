Song Kang-ho and Kim Sang-kyung star as Detective Park and Detective Seo, respectively, two of the detectives trying to solve the crimes. The film was the second feature film directed by Bong, following his 2000 debut film Barking Dogs Never Bite.

It has been regarded by several publications as one of the finest films ever made. ==Plot== In October 1986, two women are found raped and murdered in a ditch. Local detective Park Doo- man, not having dealt with such a serious case before, is overwhelmed \u2014 evidence is improperly collected, the police's investigative methods are suspect, and their forensic technology is near non-existent. Park claims he has a way of determining suspects by eye contact. He decides to first question a scarred mentally handicapped boy, Baek Kwang-ho, who resides in the town. He uses his eye contact method, thinking Baek is responsible, and has his partner Cho beat confessions out of Baek. Seo Tae-yoon, a detective from Seoul, volunteers to assist them. However he and Park's methods clash. Seo deems Baek's hands too weak and scarred to be able to commit such an elaborate crime, clearing his name. After more murders are committed, they realize that the killer waits until a rainy night and only kills women wearing red. Officer Kwon Kwi-ok realizes that a local radio station is always requested to play a particular song during the nights the murders are committed. At the latest crime scene, Park, Cho and Seo all arrive to investigate in different ways, but a local man there masturbates in a woman's red lingerie. Park and Cho apprehend the man, brutally beating him. Seo finds a survivor of the killer with Kwon's help. Upon learning that the killer's hands were noticeably soft, Seo clears the man, as his hands are rough. Infuriated that they lost their suspect, Park scuffles with Seo until Kwon alerts them that the song on the radio is playing. They realize it's raining but arrive too late, finding another woman murdered. Park, Seo and Cho finally decide to work together. Upon doing an autopsy of the latest victim, they discover pieces of a peach in the body. Clues lead them to a factory worker, Park Hyeon-gyu. Seo notes that his hands are soft like the survivor had described. Hyeon-gyu begins to show discomfort when Seo presents the peaches and they think they've found the killer. Cho loses control and beats Hyeon-gyu, prompting their superior to ban him from the interrogation room. Park and Seo listen to Baek's earlier confession. Seo points out that he talks as if someone else did it and they realize he knew details of the murder because he witnessed it. They go to Baek's father's restaurant, only to discover a drunken Cho there. As people watch news and ridicule police officers, he beats everyone and Baek joins the fray, swinging a wooden board at Cho's leg and accidentally piercing it with a rusty nail. Park and Seo chase Baek and question him, but he gets frightened and runs into the path of an oncoming train, where he is hit and killed. Park learns that Cho's leg will have to be amputated because the nail caused tetanus, leaving him feeling guilty. They discover semen on one of the bodies, but because of lack of technology, the sample has to be sent to the United States to confirm if suspect Hyeon-gyu is the killer. That night, a young girl is killed. At the crime scene, Seo recognizes the girl as the same schoolgirl he had befriended while investigating. Enraged, he attacks Hyeon-gyu until he is interrupted by Park bringing the results from America. The sample does not match Hyeon-gyu's DNA. Park lets Hyeon-gyu go. In the end, the crimes remain unsolved. While visiting the crime scene years later in 2003, Park Doo-man, now a businessman, learns from a little girl that the scene had recently been visited by an unknown man with a 'normal' face, someone who looked very ordinary. The little girl had asked the man why he was looking at the ditch; the man had responded that he was reminiscing about something he had done there a long time ago. The film ends as Park, realizing the truth, looks straight at the camera, seemingly using his eye-contact method to spot the killer among the audience. ==Cast== * Song Kang-ho \u2013 Park Doo-man, the detective in charge of solving the murders * Kim Sang-kyung \u2013 Seo Tae-yoon, a younger but also much more experienced detective from Seoul who volunteers to help Park * Kim Roi-ha \u2013 Cho Yong-koo, Park's partner who beats suspects, and is popular among women * Song Jae-ho \u2013 Sergeant Shin Dong-chul, the detectives' superior * Byun Hee-bong \u2013 Sergeant Koo Hee-bong, another superior working on the case * Go Seo-hee \u2013 Officer Kwon Kwi-ok, a female police officer who works with the other detectives to solve the case * Park No-shik \u2013 Baek Kwang-ho, an intellectually disabled man and one of the suspects * Park Hae-il \u2013 Park Hyeon-gyu, a factory worker and another suspect of the case * Jeon Mi-seon \u2013 Kwok Seol-yung, Park Doo-man's girlfriend * Yeom Hye-ran \u2013 So- hyeon's mother ==Reception== Memories of Murder was critically praised by both critics and audiences, referred to as the best films in the crime genre, and one of the best South Korean films of all time.

As in the film, the investigators found bodily fluids suspected to belong to the murderer in the crime scenes, but did not have access to equipment to determine whether the DNA matched with the suspects until late in the investigations. After the ninth murder, DNA evidence was sent to Japan (unlike the film, where it was sent to America) for analysis, but the results did not correspond with the suspects.Hwang Ho-taek, DNA Evidence, donga.com, January 21, 2006, retrieved March 11, 2006. As in the film, at the time of its release, the actual murderer had not yet been caught.
