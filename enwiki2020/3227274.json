It is located in Uttara Kannada district, in Karnataka, India. The park is a habitat of Bengal tigers, black panthers and Indian elephants, amongst other distinctive fauna. The Kali River flows through the tiger reserve and is the lifeline of the ecosystem and hence the name. The Tiger reserve is spread over an area of 1300 square kilometers. ==History== The forest in the area was declared the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary on 10 May 1956. The state proposed carving out a section of the sanctuary to form the Anshi national park, and the proposal was implemented on 2 September 1987.Wildlife Institute of India Protected Areas in Karnataka state , (June 2000), URL accessed 2 April 2007 The initial proposal covered 250 square kilometres. When the final notification of the park area was issued in 2002, it was extended by another 90 square kilometres. It was renamed to Kali Tiger Reserve in Dec 2015. The park is home to several hydroelectric dams and a nuclear power station. ==Renaming of Anshi Tiger Reserve== It is notable that Anshi National Park and Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary were together granted the status of Project Tiger tiger reserve, being declared as 'Anshi Dandeli Tiger Reserve' in January, 2007. The Anshi park adjoins the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary, and together with six adjacent protected areas in the states of Goa and Maharashtra, forms an almost uninterrupted protected forest area of over . In December 2015, Dandeli Anshi Tiger reserve was renamed to Kali Tiger Reserve(JOIDA). The river Kali is the lifeline of the people of Uttara Kannada district and integrates Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS) spread across 400 km2 and Anshi National Park (ANP) spread across 500 km2. The river cuts across the whole park and the renaming has given the area a single identity. The change of name was also to bring focus and awareness to Kali River (Karnataka). The name change was prompted following a universal response from policymakers after the release of the movie Kalikali rename which brought to importance the role of Kali River to the ecosystem. ==Geography== Located in the Western Ghats range from l4\u00b054' to l5\u00b007' N latitude and 74\u00b0l6' to 74\u00b030\u2019 E longitude, Kali Tiger River's elevation varies from above MSL.
