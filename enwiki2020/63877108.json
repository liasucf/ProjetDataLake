A rockier number with a good dance pulse.\" In a review of The Road to Hell, David Law of The Charlatan commented: \"The angry but soulful \"That's What They Always Say\" intensifies the [album's theme of] despair, personalizing the plight of a gullible dreamer who believed the promises of politicians.\" ==Track listing== 7\" single # \"That's What They Always Say\" (Remix) \u2013 4:03 # \"1975\" \u2013 4:30 12\" single # \"That's What They Always Say\" (Rainbow Mix) \u2013 6:40 # \"That's What They Always Say\" (Remix) \u2013 4:08 # \"1975\" \u2013 4:33 CD single (German release) # \"That's What They Always Say\" (Remix) \u2013 4:12 # \"That's What They Always Say\" (Extended Remix) \u2013 5:45 # \"1975\" \u2013 4:39 # \"Driving Home for Christmas\" \u2013 3:59 ==Personnel== * Chris Rea - vocals, guitars, keyboards * Robert Ahwai - bass * Martin Ditcham - drums, percussion * Linda Taylor, Karen Boddington, Carol Kenyon - backing vocals Production * Chris Rea, Jon Kelly - producers * Neil Amor - engineer * Diane BJ Kon\u00e9 - assistant engineer * Bill Frutz, Jack Frutz - remixers on \"Rainbox Mix\" Other * The Leisure Process - sleeve design ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1989-90) !Peak position |- | Australian Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|123 |- | French Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|35 |- | UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|83 |} ==References== Category:1989 songs Category:1989 singles Category:Chris Rea songs Category:Warner Music Group singles Category:Songs written by Chris Rea ",
