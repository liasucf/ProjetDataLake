    "text": "Tomochichi and his nephew, Toonahawi Tomochichi (to-mo-chi-chi') (c. 1644 \u2013 October 5, 1739) was the head chief of a Yamacraw town on the site of present- day Savannah, Georgia in the 18th century. He gave his land to James Oglethorpe to build the city of Savannah. He remains a prominent character of early Georgia history. As the principal mediator between the native population and the new English settlers during the first years of settlement, he contributed much to the establishment of peaceful relations between the two groups and to the ultimate success of Georgia. == Life == Although much of his early life is unknown, Tomochichi was exiled from the Creek nation for unclear reasons and, along with several followers, first settled what is now Savannah, Georgia. Presumably, he was Creek and participated in their early activities with Englishmen in South Carolina, both peaceful and hostile. In about 1728 Tomochichi created his own tribe of Yamacraw from an assortment of Creek and Yamasee Indians after the two nations disagreed over future relations with the English and the Spanish. His group, approximately two hundred people, settled on the bluffs of the Savannah River because the location was the resting place of his ancestors and had close proximity to English traders. When General James Oglethorpe and his fellow settlers reached the region in February 1733, they realized the need to negotiate fairly with the neighboring Indian tribes or risk the success of their enterprise. Mary Musgrove, daughter of a Creek mother and an English father, and her husband, John, served as interpreters for the general and the chief. Tomochichi had had previous contact with English colonists, making him unafraid yet cautious. The aging warrior had several different options available, but he decided to receive the new arrivals and to give them permission to establish Savannah in order to take advantage of trading and diplomatic connections. By the time of the establishment of the colonial charter of Georgia in 1732 (the colonial charter was contributed in the same year), Tomochichi remaining a lifelong friend of the early English colonists, helping the settlers in Georgia negotiate a treaty with the Lower Creeks (as well as settling previous disagreements with the Creek). James Oglethorpe wrote the following account in a letter date June 9, 1733: > \"There seems a Door opened to our Colony towards the Conversion of the > Indians. I have had many Conversations with their chief Men, the whole > Tenour of which shews there is nothing wanting to their Conversion, but one, > who understands their Language well, to explain to them the Mysteries of > Religion; for as to the moral Part of Christianity they understand it and > assent to it. They abhor Adultery, and do not approve of Plurality of Wives. > Theft is a thing not know among the Creek Nation, tho' frequent, and even > honourable, amongst the Uchees. Murder they look upon as a most abominable > Crime, but do not esteem the killing of an Enemy, or one that has injur'd > them, Murder. The Passion of Revenge, which they call Honour, and > Drunkenness, which they learnt from our Traders, seem to be the two greatest > Obstacles to their being truly Christians: But upon both these Points they > hear Reason; and with respect to drinking of Rum, I have weaned those near > me a good deal from it. As for Revenge, they say, as they have no executive > Power of Justice amongst them, they are forced to kill the Man who has > injured them, in order to prevent others from doing the like; but they do > not think that any Injury, except Adultery, or Murder, deserves Revenge. > They hold, that if a Man commits Adultery, the injur'd Husband is oblig'd to > have Revenge, by cutting off the Ears of the Adulterer, which if he is too > sturdy and strong to submit to, then the injured Husband kills him the first > Time that he has an Opportunity so to do with Safety.

Dated the 9th of June Last [my note-June 1732]. James Oglethorpe presenting Tomochichi and other Yamacraw Indians to the Georgia Trustees, July 3, 1734, by William Verelst. From the Winterthur Museum and Country Estate Tomochichi wanted his people to be educated. He worked with Benjamin Ingham, a friend of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, to create an Indian school at Irene that opened in September 1736.Tomochichi at the New Georgia Encyclopedia During the first five years of English settlement, Tomochichi provided invaluable assistance to the new colony. One year after Oglethorpe's arrival, the Indian chief accompanied him back to England along with a small delegation of family and Lower Creek tribesmen. There, Tomochichi expertly fulfilled the position as mediator for his people during numerous meetings with important English dignitaries. He met King George II of Great Britain at Kensington Palace on August 1, 1734, and gave the King eagle feathers as a token of peace.Black, Jeremy (2007) George II: Puppet of the Politicians?, Exeter: University of Exeter Press, p. 32, Tomochichi's travel allowed him to be present for the ratification of the Articles of Friendship and Commerce, the treaty that both he and Oglethorpe established allowing Englishmen to settle in Yamacraw Bluff in what would be named Savannah. He politely followed English mannerisms in his public appearances while pushing for recognition and realization of the demands of his people for education and fair trade. Upon his return to Georgia, Tomochichi met with other Lower Creek chieftains to reassure them of the honest intentions of these new Englishmen and convinced them to ally with the English despite previous deceitful encounters with their northern neighbors in South Carolina. After Oglethorpe returned to Georgia in February 1736, the chief received John Wesley, minister of Savannah, his brother Charles, and their friend Benjamin Ingham. Tomochichi reiterated his requests for Christian education for his tribe, but John Wesley rebuffed him with complex replies. Ingham, on the other hand, assisted in creating an Indian school at Irene, which opened in September 1736 much to the delight of the elderly chieftain. The same year, Tomochichi and Oglethorpe participated in an expedition to determine the southern boundaries of Georgia and helped mediate interactions with the Spanish. Tomochichi exerted his best efforts to maintain peace, and Oglethorpe regularly asked his friend for advice and assistance in achieving this goal. In February 1739, the subject met with a diplomatic delegation of Choctaws who were meeting with English authorities in Savannah.\"America and West Indies: February 1739, 16-28.\" Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies: Volume 45, 1739. Ed. K G Davies. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1994. 37-50. British History Online. Retrieved 27 May 2019. During the summer of 1739 Oglethorpe made an unprecedented journey to Coweta, deep in Indian Territory, to bolster his connections to the Lower Creeks, which resulted in a mutually favorable treaty. Tomochichi was unable to partake directly in Oglethorpe's negotiations; instead, he lay at home in his village fighting a serious illness. ==Death and legacy== Tomochichi Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse (Chatham County, Georgia) Tomochichi died on October 5, 1739, and while sources differ over his exact age, historians and contemporary observers generally agree that he was 95 when he died. Before he died in 1739, he told the Creek Indians to remember how well the King treated them and he hoped that they would remain friends forever. He was given a public funeral by the colony. His contributions to the colony of Georgia were celebrated with an English military funeral, and the grave site was commemorated with a marker of \"a Pyramid of Stone\" collected from the vicinity. Senauki, his wife, and his nephew, Toonahowi, were left in charge of the tribe, but he appointed no one to take his place as the impartial mediator between the Indians and the English. The monument marking his gravesite was destroyed under unknown circumstances, the last known mention of the pyramid being in 1759. In the early 1870s, another monument was built on the site, this time an earthen mound with a decorative planter in the center, identical to at least four other mounds and planters built in other local squares. The planter is commonly mis-identified as the monument to Tomochichi, a mistake that arises from a 1937 Savannah Morning News article. The planter was later removed to make way for the William Washington Gordon Monument, honoring the founder of the Central of Georgia Railroad and the grandfather of Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts.\u201cCopy of Minutes of Meeting of the Board of Directors, Central Rail Road and Banking Company of Georgia. July 12, 1883,\u201d vertical file \u201cMonuments/Memorials \u2013 Savannah, Ga - Gordon Monument,\u201d Georgia Historical Society, Savannah, Georgia. Upset with the lack of monument for Tomochichi, Gordon's daughter-in-law, Nellie Gordon, had a new monument to his memory, a large granite boulder with a decorative copper plate, installed southeast of the original structure on April 21, 1899, by the Georgia Society of The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America.Tomochichi's Monument at the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America The Georgia Historical Commission later placed a large marker in Savannah's Wright Square, which details the achievements of the Yamacraw chieftain. Savannah's Tomochichi Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse was named in his honor. ==Notes== == References == * Lafarge, Oliver. A Pictorial History of the American Indian.
