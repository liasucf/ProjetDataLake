It now houses the Adam Mickiewicz Institute. ==History== In the second half of the 19th century, this site on Warsaw's ulica Mokotowska (Mokot\u00f3w Street) belonged to J\u00f3zef Kaczy\u0144ski. In 1877, on part of the parcel, a cottage was built for Kazimiera \u0106wierczakiewiczowa (n\u00e9e Kaczy\u0144ska). In 1907, the cottage was taken over by the first owner's descendant, Mieczys\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, who with Wac\u0142aw Cywi\u0144ski set up there a printing house, a lithography establishment, and a bag factory. In 1910, the building was leased by the Board of Lublin Province Sugar Producers \"Lubelskie\", \"Garb\u00f3w\", \"Lublin\", and \"Nielep\u00f3w\". About 1915, architect Tadeusz Zieli\u0144ski was commissioned to remodel the facility; according to some sources, it was completely rebuilt. In 1922, the Board of Lublin Province Sugar Producers (Zarz\u0105d Cukrowni Lubelskich) purchased the building, and its reconstruction was completed in 1926. The cottage, in the rear, was given a rococo stylization, and two wings were added in front, enclosing the entrance to a courtyard. In 1935, the palace was bought by Mieczys\u0142aw Broniewski, a sugar industrialist, who adapted the building as a family residence to a design by Antoni Jawornicki. The Board of Lublin Province Sugar Producers moved to 8 ulica Koszykowa in Warsaw. During World War II, the building was occupied by the German Gestapo. It was not destroyed, due to its location in Warsaw's \"German district\". After World War II, the building was renovated to house, among other institutions, the Polish Academy of Sciences Mathematics Institute. In 1987 the building underwent extensive renovation of its fa\u00e7ade. It now houses the Adam Mickiewicz Institute. ==Notes== ==External links== * * Adam Mickiewicz Institute website Category:Palaces in Warsaw ",
