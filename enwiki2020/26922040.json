Population as of 2005: 4. ==History== ===Soviet period=== The village was founded in spring 1965, hence its name, although local history records that the reason the settlement was so called was because spring was always said to come earlier to this part of Chukotka than any other part of the Okrug.History of Vesenny Twenty years after the foundation of the settlement, it boasted a health center and a clinic, sauna, laundry service, savings bank, two hotels, a kindergarten and 205 children enrolled in secondary school. The location of the settlement was initially not entirely successful. The first buildings were situated too close to the mine workings and so as the village began to grow new buildings were constructed further up the slope. there were also difficulties getting fresh water to the settlement. In the summer, tankers delivered water to the settlement from a nearby creek. In winter, water had to be brought from the Anyuy river some 40 km away. When neither of these options was feasible, water had to be used that had collected in reservoirs formed by the waste pits from mining activities. ===Post-Soviet period=== The settlement was abandoned when the extraction of gold was no longer economically viable.deadcities.ru - Vesenny The mines were declared unprofitable and that there was no possibility of developing any other form of economy in 1999 and the settlement was closed along with a number of others in Chukotka.\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0424 \u043e\u0442 2 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044f 1998 \u0433.
