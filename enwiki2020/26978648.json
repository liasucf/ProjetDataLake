It was built from 1933 to 1934 in neo-Romanesque style by Oswald Bieber and government architect William Hollweck. The new building was necessary due to the strong growth of the mother parish of St. Rupert. The Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth is shown on the relief over the portal of the church. ==References== == External links == * Photos of Mari\u00e4 Heimsuchung Category:Roman Catholic churches in Munich Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1934 Category:Cultural heritage monuments in Munich Category:1934 establishments in Germany ",
