    "text": "A Cambodian Shiva head showing a third eye The third eye (also called the mind's eye or inner eye) is a mystical and esoteric concept of a speculative invisible eye, usually depicted as located on the forehead, which provides perception beyond ordinary sight. ==Religious overview== In Dharmic spiritual traditions from India, the third eye refers to the ajna (or brow) chakra. The third eye refers to the gate that leads to the inner realms and spaces of higher consciousness. In spirituality, the third eye often symbolizes a state of enlightenment or the evocation of mental images having deeply personal spiritual or psychological significance. The third eye is often associated with religious visions, clairvoyance, the ability to observe chakras and auras,Leadbeater, C. W. The Chakras Wheaton, Illinois, USA:1927 Theosophical Publishing House Page 79. precognition, and out-of-body experiences. People who are said to have the capacity to utilize their third eyes are sometimes known as seers. In Hinduism and Buddhism, the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows, representing the enlightenment one achieves through meditation. Hindus also place a \"tilaka\" between the eyebrows as a representation of the third eye, which is also seen on expressions of Shiva. Buddhists regard the third eye as the \"eye of consciousness\", representing the vantage point from which enlightenment beyond one's physical sight is achieved. In Taoism and many traditional Chinese religious sects such as Chan (called Zen in Japanese), \"third eye training\" involves focusing attention on the point between the eyebrows with the eyes closed, and while the body is in various qigong postures. The goal of this training is to allow students to tune into the correct \"vibration\" of the universe and gain a solid foundation on which to reach a more advanced meditative state. Taoism teaches that the third eye, also called the mind's eye, is situated between the two physical eyes, and expands up to the middle of the forehead when opened. Taoism asserts that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth Chakra, forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.The doctrine of the elixir, R. B. Jefferson, Coombe Springs Press 1982, chapter 4: \"The Archaic Anatomy of Individual Organs\". In Taoist alchemical traditions, the third eye is the frontal part of the \"Upper Dan Tien\" (upper cinnabar field) and is given the evocative name \"muddy pellet\". According to the Christian teaching of Father Richard Rohr, the concept of the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), \"but they know not to confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes\u2014and yet goes further.\" Rohr refers to this level of awareness as \"having the mind of Christ\".Rohr, Richard The Naked Now: Learning to See as the Mystics See, The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2009, , . Adherents of theosophist H. P. Blavatsky have suggested that the third eye is in fact the partially dormant pineal gland, which resides between the two hemispheres of the brain.H. P. Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2, 1888, , pp. 289\u2013306. Reptiles and amphibians sense light via a third parietal eye\u2014a structure associated with the pineal gland\u2014which serves to regulate their circadian rhythms, and for navigation, as it can sense the polarization of light. C. W. Leadbeater thought that by extending an \"etheric tube\" from the third eye, it is possible to develop microscopic and telescopic vision. It has been asserted by Stephen Phillips that the third eye's microscopic vision is capable of observing objects as small as quarks.Phillips, Stephen Extrasensory Perception of Quarks Wheaton, Illinois, USA 1980 Theosophical Publishing House . According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland.Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine vol. II, (Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House, 1993), 295. Rick Strassman has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of DMT (dimethyltryptamine), an entheogen which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death. () == Philosophy == The use of the phrase mind's eye does not imply that there is a single or unitary place in the mind or brain where visual consciousness occurs. Philosopher Daniel Dennett has critiqued this view.Consciousness Explained, Daniel C. Dennett, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991. . == In popular literature == The 1959 novel The Third Eye by Lobsang Rampa (born Cyril Henry Hoskin, 19101981, a native of Plympton, Devonshire) introduced a fictional account of the third eye for the first time to a wide popular audience of English-speaking readers. ==See also== *Ajna chakra *Consciousness *Erlang Shen *Eye of Providence *Parietal eye *Pineal gland ==Notes== ==References== * Hale, Teresa (1999).
