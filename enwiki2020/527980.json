Aerial view from Northwest, \u00cele Saint-Louis in the background above \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 Map of \u00cele Saint-Louis The \u00cele Saint-Louis () is one of two natural islands in the Seine river, in Paris, France (the other natural island is \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9; the \u00cele aux Cygnes is artificial). The \u00cele Saint-Louis is connected to the rest of Paris by four bridges to both banks of the river and to the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 by the Pont Saint-Louis. This island was formerly used for the grazing of market cattle and stocking wood. The island is located within the 4th arrondissement of Paris and has a population of 4,453. ==History== One of France's first examples of urban planning, it was mapped and built from end to end during the 17th-century reigns of Henri IV and Louis XIII. A peaceful oasis of calm in the busy Paris centre, this island has only narrow one-way streets and two bus stops. Most of the island is residential, but there are several restaurants, hotels, shops, caf\u00e9s and ice cream parlours at street level, as well as one large church. Artists and intellectuals abound within its perimeters. The \u00cele Saint-Louis, an elegant neighborhood, was actually two natural islets in the Seine River \u2013 the \u00cele Notre Dame (which was the larger of the two) and the \u00cele aux Vaches (a small islet used as a cow pasture) \u2013 joined together in 1614. The \u00cele Saint-Louis is named after Louis IX (Saint Louis), King of France from 8 November 1226 to 25 August 1270. At the start of the 16th century, the island was not yet named after King Louis IX, who was canonized in 1297, less than 30 years after his death. It was King Louis XIII, who reigned from 1610 (age 8) to 1643, along with the queen mother Marie de M\u00e9dicis, who decided at the start of the 17th century to implement a great urban plan first devised by his father, King Henri IV, which transformed the two \u00celes. The responsibility for the development of the \u00cele Saint-Louis in the 17th century was given to Christophe Marie, general builder for Public Works. In exchange for his pro bono work, he was granted a license to build elegant residences. Along with the nobles, aristocrats, wealthy businessmen and politicians came here to live away from the noise of the inner city. Marie went into partnership with two builders, Lugles Poulletier and Fran\u00e7ois Le Regrattier, and chose Louis Le Vau as architect. In 1614 the ditch between the two islets was filled in; and townhouses were constructed between 1620 and 1650. The island project, an architectural revolution, used a carefully drafted urban plan for the first time in Paris. The urban planning was revolutionary, especially for Paris; it was only under Napoleon III, over 200 years later, that urban planning was implemented citywide. The option to build by just following the topography of the land was no longer available. The new streets were built straight and perpendicular to a central axis. So that the risk of fires was reduced, stone and slate replaced wood, plaster and thatched roofs. For the first time, dwellings were orientated towards the outside, rather than towards an inner courtyard, with windows and balconies looking out to river views. Courtyards were narrow, with the usual gardens almost nonexistent. Aimed towards wealthy denizens, much effort was focused on the interior design of the apartments. The majority of the fa\u00e7ades were rather sober, providing charm to the neighborhood. Only a few fa\u00e7ades were decorated with heads or faces (). Only a few of the balconies were adorned with ornate ironwork. The few monumental doors that horse-drawn coaches rushed through hinted at the wealth of the owners. Along with Faubourg Saint-Germain and Le Marais, \u00cele Saint-Louis was one of the most affluent neighborhoods in 17th and 18th century Paris. It is still today a quiet and respectable district, with apartments costing up to $4 million. It is one of the most authentic and unaffected 17th- and 18th-century neighborhoods in Paris. First constructed in 1622, the Eglise Saint-Louis-en-l'\u00cele, an atmospheric building designed by Fran\u00e7ois Le Vau, has a vast, stunning wooden door decorated with angels. Inside, it is impressive and immense; the ornate Baroque style interior is a stark contrast to the sober exterior. The Pont Saint-Louis entertainers (i.e., jazz bands, jugglers and mimes) perform on a small bridge that connects \u00cele Saint-Louis with \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. One mansion built in the 1600s is today the refined and elegant H\u00f4tel des Deux-\u00celes, offering 17 modern rooms, with the original blue earthenware tiles on the bathroom walls. Another large h\u00f4tel particulier, the H\u00f4tel Lambert, was owned by Marquis du Chatelet, a notable aristocrat. The H\u00f4tel Lauzun was its competitor. Until the Revolution, \u00cele Saint-Louis was often inhabited by aristocrats and nobles. This is recognized by the ornate h\u00f4tels particuliers and apartments from the 17th and 18th century. ==Bridges that connect to the \u00cele== West point of \u00cele Saint-Louis and the Pont Louis-Philippe. * Pont Saint-Louis from the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9; * Pont de la Tournelle from the Rive Gauche; * Pont Louis-Philippe from the Rive Droite; * Pont Marie from the Rive Droite; * Pont Sully from the Rive Droite and the Rive Gauche. ==See also== * Glaces Berthillon * H\u00f4tel Lambert ==References and sources== References Sources * : \"Island in the Seine\", pp. 10\u201317 * DeJean, Joan.
