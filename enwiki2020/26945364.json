The series was broadcast by ITV, and was billed as the return of the Survival brand. It was followed by Wild Britain with Ray Mears. Survival consists of three, hour-long, programmes, focusing on Mears' tracking of the world's top predators. He follows the leopard in Namibia, the bear in British Columbia, and the wolf in Central Idaho. An underpinning theme is the threats faced by each species: in Idaho the crew arrives with only days to countdown before the wolf's status as a protected species is lifted, and local farmers indicate their intention to begin hunting them; in British Columbia the impact of global warming on the salmon population is felt by the bear; and in Namibia the uneasy co-existence between leopards and local farmers is highlighted. ==Episode 1: Leopards== In the first episode of Survival, Ray Mears arrives at the 270 square-mile Erindi Game Reserve in Namibia, a territory he describes as \u2018one of nature\u2019s richest environments\u2019. The reserve is surrounded by farmland, and leopards that stray onto them risk being shot by farmers anxious to protect their livestock. He aims to track his favorite predator: the leopard, an elusive big cat which Mears believes is \u2018hardly understood.\u2019 He is joined by his duo of wildlife camera men \u2013 Isaac Babcock and Shane Moore, and Natasha De Woronin, who runs the Global Leopard Project. De Woronin needs Mear's tracking skills to help find male leopards, which have so far eluded her. They intend to fit the leopards with radio collars to help build a map of their movements across the reserve. ==Episode 2: Bears== In the second episode of Survival, Mears travels to the wilderness of British Columbia\u2019s Pacific Coast region. He aims to track grizzly and black bears, and especially the rare Kermode or Spirit bear, notable by its pure white fur. It is thought that there are only 400 alive today. Mears touches down at the fishing outpost of Klemtu, and hires a boat to the remote Mussel Inlet. He finds tracks of grizzly bears taking part in the annual salmon run which is in full swing. Prints eventually lead him to a grizzly mother and a couple of two-year-old bear cubs. The crew encounters a massive grizzly male, at which point they carefully retreat. Leading the team on a final search, Mears find white hairs on a bear trail near a babbling stream, evidence of the rare Spirit bear. ==Episode 3: Wolves== In the final episode, Mears and his wildlife crew turn their attention to tracking wolves in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. Wolves are secretive animals, which makes searching for them difficult. He has ten days to track them before they are taken off the state's endangered species list, after which point they can be hunted. From the town of Stanley, Mears hikes into the small valleys that drain into the Salmon River. He discovers the tracks of some elk, the principle prey for wolves, and soon finds the tracks of a wolf nearby. The following day the team get a sighting of a small group of wolves and eventually come across an entire pack of around a dozen, following the lead of a silver-backed alpha male. A young female dies during the night, at which point Mears becomes tearful. Worried that the rest of the pack might have suffered the same fate, Mears leads the team on an urgent search. Ultimately they make another sighting of the wolves preying on rodents. It is a relief for Mears and the whole team; providing an emotive finale to the series. ==See also== *Extreme Survival *Ray Mears' Bushcraft *Wild Food *Ray Mears' Northern Wilderness *Wild Britain with Ray Mears ==External links== *RayMears.com * * Category:2010 British television series debuts Category:2010 British television series endings Category:ITV (TV network) original programming Category:Works about survival skills Category:Television series by ITV Studios ",
