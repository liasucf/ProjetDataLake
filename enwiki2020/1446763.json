It was named after the English naval officer Sir Francis Drake, who purportedly landed in the area in 1579. The school's mascot is a pirate named Petey. The school was established in 1951 as the second high school in the Tamalpais Union High School District. It is located at 1327 Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, situated on a 21-acre (85,000 m\u00b2) campus bordered by two creeks. The site was formerly known as Cordone Gardens. Approximately 99% of Drake's 2015 students graduated. In 2020, the school board resolved to change the name from Sir Francis Drake to a new name to be determined, due to Drake's involvement in the slave trade. Until a new name is chosen, it is being officially referred to as \"High School 1327,\" a reference to its address. == History == Sir Francis Drake high school was founded in 1951 in San Anselmo, California, providing schooling for students from Fairfax, Forest Knolls, Lagunitas, San Geronimo, Woodacre, San Anselmo, and Nicasio grades 9\u201312. This was the second high school to be introduced into the Tamalpais Union High School District, the first being Tamalpais High School. Until 1958, Sir Francis Drake High School served other towns of Marin that are now served by Redwood High School, including Corte Madera, Ross, Larkspur, Greenbrae, and Kentfield. Between 1992 and 1995, Drake High School started a new program of small learning communities due to the poor performance of students, which was affecting the perception of the school. Drake has received two state grants for these programs; one in 1996\u20131997 and the other being in 2000. Since then, there have been four Freshman\u2013Sophomore Academies and two Junior\u2013Senior Academies. In 2020, Tamalpais Union School District released a letter explaining its decision to remove Drake's name from the school and detail a process for its renaming. == School awards == In 1990 the school was designated as a Next Century School by RJR Nabisco Foundation for its \"entrepreneurship in education.\" Drake was one of thirty schools to receive this award.
