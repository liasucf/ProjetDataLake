    "text": "Most common form (Hittite ka) in the Amarna letters. Sign for ka. Amarna letter EA 365-(Reverse), by Biridiya of Magiddo, \"Furnishing Corvee Workers\";Moran, William L. 1987, 1992. The Amarna Letters. EA 365, Furnishing Corvee Workers, p. 362. line 3 (1st sign for \u0161a: \"\u0161a it-ti-ia\", \"Who, (are) with...\"). (Very high resolution exandable photo. The 2-wedge strokes of line 3 \u0161a are very visible.) The cuneiform \u0161a sign is a common, multi-use sign, a syllabic for \u0161a, and an alphabetic sign used for \u0161, or a; it is common in both the Epic of Gilgamesh over hundreds of years, and the 1350 BC Amarna letters. Besides \u0161a usage in word components of verbs, nouns, etc., it has a major usage between words. In Akkadian, for English language \"who\", it is an interrogative pronoun; in the Akkadian language as \u0161a, (as \"that\", \"what\"; (\"that (of)\", \"which (of)\"Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Glossary, pp. 119-145, \u0161a, p. 139.), in English it used for who, what, which, etc.. ==\u0160a, and Ka, the stroke differences== The difference in the construction of the signs ka and \u0161a are as follows: \"ka\" when scribed in the Amarna letters often shows the distinctiveness of the right section of the sign, versus the left section. For \u0161a, the right section is constructed with two wedge strokes 100x24px (one scribed above the other), between the two verticals, at right. For ka, the right side mostly, in the Amarna letters has two verticals, 100x24px100x24px with two horizontals 100x24px that cross both of them; (the right side is like a two-step ladder shape--(for Hittite ka:--100x24px)). A good example of \u0161a, is shown for EA 365, Reverse (top half), where the 2-wedge strokes of \u0161a between the 2-right verticals is clear. (Note, the \u0161a of EA 365 appears to have 3-horizontals at left (differing lengths), then the 2-verticals with the 2-wedge strokes, at right.) ==\u0160a Usage numbers== ===Epic of Gilgamesh=== The usage numbers for \u0161a in the Epic of Gilgamesh are as follows:Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Sign List, pp. 155-165, Sign No. 019, \u0161a, p. 161. \u0161a-(66) times. There are no other sub-uses or sumerogramic uses for \u0161a in the Epic of Gilgamesh. ===Amarna letters=== Cuneiform \u0161a is common in the Amarna letters, found easily between words (as the pronoun), and especially in word constructs. Since it is similar in appearance to cuneiform ka, the large difference is that ka can easily be found as a suffix to words, for example in the Canaanite sub-corpus of letters as \"Servant-Yours\", 100x24px100x24px, (ARAD-ka). ==References== *Moran, William L. 1987, 1992.
