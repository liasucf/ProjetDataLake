Azorus or Azoros ( or \u1f08\u03b6\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) was a town and polis (city-state) in Perrhaebia in ancient Thessaly situated at the foot of Mount Olympus. Azorus, with the two neighbouring towns of Pythium and Doliche, formed a Tripolis. During the Roman\u2013Seleucid War, the Tripolis was ravaged by an army of the Aetolian League in the year 191 BCE. During the Third Macedonian War the three towns surrendered to the army of Perseus of Macedon in the year 171 BCE, but that same year the Romans reconquered the three. In the year 169 BCE troops arrived from the Roman consul Quintus Marcius Philippus who camped between Azorus and Doliche. The three cities minted a common coin with the inscription \"\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a0\u039f\u039b\u0399\u03a4\u0391\u039d\". The site of Azorus is the palaiokastro (old fort) at the modern village of Azoros. ==References== Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Cities in ancient Greece Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Perrhaebia Category:Mount Olympus Category:Thessalian city-states ",
