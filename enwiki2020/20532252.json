He is best known for introducing monasticism to the Beta Israel, and the tradition of Jewish monks continued down the centuries until the Great Famine of the 1890s decimated their monasteries in Lay Armachiho.Richard Pankhurst, \"The Falashas, or Judaic Ethiopians, in Their Christian Ethiopian Setting\", African Affairs, Vol. 91 (October 1992), pp. 567-582 He then later converted the son of king Zara Yaqob, Saga-Amlak, who adopted the religious name Abba Saga. Later Abba Sabra and Abba Saga established a separate kingdom in modern day Ethiopia in which Jews were not persecuted. ==References== Category:Ethiopian clergy Category:Ethiopian Jews Category:Ethiopian former Christians Category:Converts to Judaism from Oriental Orthodoxy Category:Oriental Orthodox monks Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:15th- century Ethiopian people Category:15th-century Jews Category:15th-century Christian monks ",
