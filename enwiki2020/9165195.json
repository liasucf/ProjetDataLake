Freeman is Professor of Aquatic Biogeochemistry in the College of Natural Sciences in Bangor.home page Freeman's research focuses on carbon cycling, with an emphasis on peatland carbon storagePeat bog gases 'accelerate global warming by Steve Connor and dissolved organic carbon dynamics. His work is best known for its description of a mechanism known as the \"peatland enzymic latch\" and observation of a rising trend in aquatic dissolved organic carbon concentrations. His work has been recognised with awards from the American Society for Limnology and OceanographyAwards by Lynne Williams 9 May 1997 in Times Higher Education and the Royal Society.The Royal Society Mullard Award (1967) 2007 winner The Royal Society ==Publications== *Freeman C, Ostle J, Kang H (2001).
