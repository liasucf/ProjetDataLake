In 2014, he began to gain recognition following the release of his second mixtape, A$ton 3:16. Matthews is also a part of the Los Angeles hip-hop trio Cutthroat Boyz alongside fellow Californian rappers Vince Staples and Joey Fatts. == Early life == Matthew Lopez was born October 30, 1989 in the city of Los Angeles, California. Born of Guatemalan immigrants, Lopez spent much of his formative years between Los Angeles, Hawaiian Gardens, Gardena, and Carson, California. Lopez, a self described multi-sport athlete, played varsity football throughout the duration of his high school career. It is during this time that he became a member of the West Side Pirus, a faction of the Bloods based in Carson, California. On May 31, 2008, Lopez was involved in an altercation at a house party where he was shot in his heart by a .40 caliber bullet, breaking his ribs, and tearing his stomach in the process. After making a full recovery, Lopez began to write and record songs about his life. == Career == === 2009-11: Career beginnings and NOFVCKSGIVEN === Following his recovery Lopez would practice writing, rapping, and recording one song a day for two years before releasing his first solo project. On November 4, 2011, Lopez would release \"NOFVCKSGIVEN.\" Lopez described his approach to the project in an interview with VICE as, \"I'm just gonna go in on a bunch of beats, make some random crazy shit and see what the fuck happens.\" NOFVCKSGIVEN largely narrated the events leading up to Lopez's shooting, as well as describing it from his own point of view on the song \"May 31st\" which also featured then rising rap artist ScHoolboy Q. When he began to rap himself, Lopez primarily studied the flow and musical patterns of Eminem, also citing Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, G-Unit, and The Diplomats as direct influences to his style.
