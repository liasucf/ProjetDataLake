Engineer, Asghar Ali. \"Dr Asghar Ali Engineer's Articles.\" Rutgers-Newark: The State University of New Jersey.

Engineer believed that women should be treated as equal to men, and said that people who support an unjust order, or remain silent in view of gross injustices were not religious people. Women's inequality topped his priority list of injustices. However, critics said that his interpretations of the Qur'an were not strong enough to get people to change their beliefs surrounding women's place in Islam. Sikand thought that Engineer's opinion was based on his interpretation of the Qur'an and his outlook on the 21st century instead of the interpretations that the Qur'an has now. \u201cHis understanding of Islam is indelibly shaped by his concern for social justice and inter-communal harmony, of course.\u201dSikand, Yoginder. \u201cAsghar Ali Engineer\u2019s Quest for an Islamic Theology of Peach and Religious Pluralism.\u201d Progressive Dawoodi Bohras.
