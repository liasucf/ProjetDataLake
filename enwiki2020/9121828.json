Although he lived during the Geonic period, he was never officially appointed as a Gaon, and therefore does not bear the title \"Gaon.\" Rabbinic sources often refer to Kayyara as Bahag, an abbreviation of Ba'al Halakhot Gedolot (=\"author of the Halakhot Gedolot\"), after his most important work. ==Name== The early identification of his surname with \"Qahirah,\" the Arabic name of Cairo (founded 980), was shown by Solomon Judah Loeb RapoportTeshuvot ha-Ge'onim, ed. Cassel, p. 12, Berlin, 1848 to be impossible. Neubauer's suggestionM.J.C. ii, p. viii of its identification with Qayyar in Mesopotamia is equally untenable. It is now assumed that \"Kayyara\" is derived from a common noun, and, like the Syro-Arabic \"qayyar,\" originally denoted a dealer in pitch or wax.Jewish Encyclopedia article for Simeon Kayyara, by Richard Gottheil and Max Schloessinger. == Halakhot Gedolot == According to both medieval authorities like Geonim Sherira and Hai ben Sherira, and modern scholars like Abraham Epstein, Kayyara is the author of Halachot Gedolot (\u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea), a work on Jewish law dating from the Geonic period. However, others have attributed the work to Yehudai Gaon. == References == * Robert Brody, The Geonim of Babylonia and the Shaping of Medieval Jewish Culture, Yale 1998 Its bibliography: * A.
