    "text": "Skid Hill is a 186 metres high hill of eastern Scotland, the highest of the Garleton Hills. == Geology == The old quarry The hill origin is volcanic and it shows both trachitic and basic lavas, recognisable thanks to the excavations connected to the disused quarry opened in its eastern flanks. == History == A hill fort was detected close to the top of Skid Hill, in one area now located on the northern edge of the disused quarry. == Access to the summit == Skid Hill trig point in winter Very close to the actual summit of Skid Hill stands a trig point. It can be easily accessed on foot from a road flanking the hill by a good track running along the South side of the hill and then by cattle tracks on its western side. ==See also== * List of mountains in Scotland * List of places in East Lothian ==References== == External links == * Description of the hill fort on ancientmonuments.uk Category:Hills of the Scottish Midland Valley Category:Mountains and hills of East Lothian ",
