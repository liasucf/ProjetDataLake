The John Morris Group principally serves the life sciences, vacuum research, environmental, petroleum, industrial and pharmaceutical industries. ==History== With original roots in Holland for 2 generations - John Morris Scientific was founded in April 1956 by John Leon Wyzenbeek and Morris Garlick to supply Australian research laboratories with quality products not available in the region. The original roots stem back to John's wife Hetty. Her father owned and ran a second generation, chemical and glassware distributor in Holland which was forced into closure during the second world war. The shell of this company was sold after the war and the proceeds were used to establish new roots in Australia. After working for a range of established Australian Scientific Instrument distributors including Townsend Mercer John Leon Wyzenbeek began a partnership with Morris Garlic leveraging the relationships from Hetty's childhood. Since inception, three generations of the Wyzenbeek family have worked in John Morris Scientific. At present, John's son Norbert is Chairman of the Board and Norbert's eldest son Andre is the Managing Director. In the early days, John would ride a bicycle to customers selling glassware until he had enough orders to place a shipment with his European suppliers. In 1987 John Morris transitioned from Glassware and Chemicals into instrumentation \u2013 investing in product specialist staff and service infrastructure. John Morris Scientific maintains knowledge of the latest technologies by providing personnel with regular factory training, attending vendors\u2019 facilities regularly and through involvement in key industry events. This company is the only third generation, privately owned, scientific instrument supplier in the South West Pacific region. John Morris Scientific has remained under the same family ownership for over 60 years. In 2016 John Morris Scientific changed its name to the John Morris Group to better reflect their growth and diversification into technical industries outside of the Laboratory. ==Service and training== Their technical services team is composed of 5 graduate application engineers, 15 product specialists and 15 technical engineers. These staff are regularly factory trained on specific instrumentation ensuring that their knowledge remains current. The John Morris Group team share expertise through user training (with installation) and ongoing support specific to application requirements. ==References== ==External links== *John Morris Scientific official website Category:Technology companies of Australia Category:Companies based in Sydney Category:Technology companies of New Zealand Category:Research support companies ",
