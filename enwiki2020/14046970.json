    "text": "Mino del Reame, also known as Mino dal Reame, was a 15th-century Neapolitan Italian Renaissance sculptor from Naples. ==History== He was active in Rome from about 1460 to 1480. Giorgio Vasari in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects recounts that Mino del Reame was a boastful sculptor whose work was inferior to that of his modest contemporary Paolo Romano. The Cleveland Museum of Art has sculptures by Mino del Reame in its collection. == References == * Douglas, R.
