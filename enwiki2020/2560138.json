    "text": "Cherrington is a village in Shropshire, England, in the civil parish of Tibberton and Cherrington. It was recorded as a manor in Domesday, when it was held by Gerard de Tournai, and was stated to have been held by a man named Uliet in the time of Edward the Confessor, although it was recorded as \"waste\", in an uncultivated state, by the time Gerard took possession of it.Eyton, R. W. Antiquities of Shropshire, v.VII, p.194 Its name is possibly derived from the Old English personal name Ceorl, or it may have originally been \"Ceorranton\" from the name Ceorra (\"the settlement of Ceorra's people\").Bowcock, E. W. Shropshire place names, Wilding & Son, 1923, p.68 Cherrington is near to the larger village of Tibberton, to the east; Waters Upton is to the west and Great Bolas to the north-west. Newport is the nearest town. It contains several half-timbered buildings including Cherrington Manor, which dates from 1635 and was probably built for a landowner and Member of Parliament, Sir Richard Leveson of Lilleshall (1598-1661). Cherrington Manor (or in some versions, the malt-house standing behind it) was popularly supposed to have been the building referenced in the nursery rhyme This Is the House That Jack Built.Bailey, Brian J. Portrait of Shropshire, R. Hale, 1981, p.61Auden, J. E. Shropshire, Methuen, 1918, p.217 The story is, however, a purely local attribution with no particular evidence to back it up. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Tibberton and Cherrington ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Shropshire Category:Telford and Wrekin ",
