It has around 1000 speakers in the remote towns of San Pedro J\u00edcora and San Juan Buenaventura in the Mezquital municipality, Durango, where they coexist with speakers of Low Southern Tepehu\u00e1n, and some 300 speakers in the Acaponeta municipality of Nayarit. There are significant differences between the varieties of San Pedro J\u00edcora on the one hand and San Agust\u00edn Buenaventura and Nayarit on the other. The language is vibrant and spoken by adults and children.Canger, Una. 1998.
