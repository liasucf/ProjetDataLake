    "text": "And the World Goes 'Round is a musical revue showcasing the songs of John Kander and Fred Ebb. The revue takes its title from a tune the songwriting team wrote for Liza Minnelli to sing in the film New York, New York (that song, however, is titled \"But the World Goes 'Round\"). ==Productions== The show consists of an eclectic collection of love songs, torch songs, and acerbically witty comic numbers. It was conceived by director Scott Ellis, choreographer Susan Stroman, and librettist David Thompson, who collaborated on such Kander and Ebb shows as Steel Pier and the 1996 revival of Chicago. David Loud created the vocal and dance arrangements. It opened on March 18, 1991 Off-Broadway at the Westside Theatre, and closed on March 8, 1992, after 408 performances. The original cast featured Karen Ziemba, Robert Cuccioli, Karen Mason, Brenda Pressley, and Jim Walton. Natalie Venetia Belcon, Joel Blum and Marin Mazzie were replacements later in the run. It won the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Musical, and Cuccioli received the Outer Critics Circle Award for his performance. Additional honors included Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Musical Revue, Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical (Ziemba), and Outstanding Director of a Musical.Drama Desk Awards, 1990\u201391 dramadesk.com, accessed April 2, 2009 An original cast recording was released by RCA Records. Starting in August 1992, Ziemba, Blum, and Mazzie were joined by John Ruess and Shelley Dickinson for a 10-month US national tour. With scenic and technical embellishments added and the title simplified to The World Goes 'Round, the revised edition included mostly upbeat, unfamiliar songs from the team's lesser musicals: The Happy Time, The Rink, The Act, Flora the Red Menace, and what was then a work-in-progress, Kiss of the Spider Woman.Klein, Alvin. \"Kander and Ebb's 'World' on Tour\",The New York Times, August 23, 1992 Throughout the years the revue has been staged by regional and community theatre groups and as a fringe theatre production in London.
