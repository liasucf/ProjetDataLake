In 1915 when a new building was constructed for the Trenton Lodge, the old building was moved half a block south to 102 Barrack Street. It has served as a Masonic Lodge, a school, a shop for a furnisher and upholsterer, a museum, and is now a tourist information center. HABS NJ-141 Written Historical and Descriptive Data, undated. In 1970 the building became part of the State House Historic District listed by the National Register of Historic Places. ==References== ==External links== * HABS drawings, photos and data Category:Buildings and structures in Trenton, New Jersey Category:Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Category:Historic district contributing properties in New Jersey Category:Houses completed in 1793 Category:Former Masonic buildings in New Jersey Category:National Register of Historic Places in Trenton, New Jersey ",
