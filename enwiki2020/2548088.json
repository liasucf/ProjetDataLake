FC K\u00f6ln and Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany and Panionios F.C. in Greece. ==Club career== Pr\u00f6ll was born in Rheinbach. He started his professional career with 1. FC K\u00f6ln before moving to Frankfurt for the 2003\u201304 season. He was elected by the German football magazine kicker as the Bundesliga's best goalkeeper of the first half of the 2006\u201307 season. Unfortunately he hardly could contend this title as he suffered of many injuries. ==Trivia== At the beginning of his career, Pr\u00f6ll became a target of some ridicule because his name \"Pr\u00f6ll\" literally means something like \"lout\" in German. ==References== ==External links== * Markus Pr\u00f6ll at eintracht-archiv.de * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:People from Rheinbach Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:German footballers Category:1.
