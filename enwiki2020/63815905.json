It was the band's only live album while together and was the last album by the band to be released under RCA. The album peaked at number 37 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was recorded at the Manchester Apollo, across three days in April 1980 (the 15th to the 17th April) as part of a 24 concert 'Tour of Britain' to promote the band's third album Facades which had been released in September 1979.
