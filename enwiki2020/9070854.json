    "text": "The new title card for \"The Vice\", used only during the fifth series, following Ken Stott's departure and a major overhaul of the series. The Vice is an ITV police drama about the Metropolitan Police Vice Unit, which ran for five series of varying lengths between 1999 and 2003. The main cast included Ken Stott, Caroline Catz and David Harewood, as well as Rosie Marcel, Marc Warren and Tim Pigott-Smith. The show experimented with different formats, two series of two-part, one-hour episodes; two series of ninety-minute episodes, and then a final series of self-contained one-hour episodes. The Portishead track \"Sour Times\" was used as the theme music to the show. \"Hooked\", although often referred to as the first episode of series five, and broadcast in 2003 prior to the broadcast of series five, was officially classified as the last episode of series four as it featured the last appearance of Pat Chappel, and was filmed during the filming block of series four. It was also the last episode to be ninety-minutes long, before the transfer to one-hour episodes, and it was also the last time that the original title card and sequence were used. == Main cast == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"20%\" | Cast member !
