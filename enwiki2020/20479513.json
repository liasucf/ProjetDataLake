    "text": "Antonio Pinilla Miranda (born 25 February 1971) is a Spanish retired footballer who played mainly as a forward. Best known for his stints with Tenerife and Gimn\u00e0stic \u2013 he began playing professionally for Barcelona, but had virtually no impact for its first team \u2013 he also served as general manager at the latter club, playing in more than 500 official matches for seven different clubs in exactly 20 years, 242 of those in La Liga over the course of 11 seasons (40 goals scored). ==Club career== ===Barcelona=== Born in Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Pinilla was formed in the youth ranks of FC Barcelona. During the 1989\u201390 season, a week before turning 19, Johan Cruyff gave him the chance to make his La Liga debut, on 18 February 1990 in a match against Rayo Vallecano: he appeared 25 minutes in the 4\u20131 away win, having come on as a substitute for Julio Salinas.Pinilla: debut feliz (Pinilla: happy debut); Mundo Deportivo, 19 February 1990 The following campaign, Barcelona won the league and Pinilla appeared in seven matches, scoring a decisive goal against Valencia CF. He also played in the final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, subbing in for veteran Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Alexanko in a 1\u20132 loss against Manchester United. However, strong competition in the emerging Dream Team meant Pinilla had to leave Bar\u00e7a on loan, and he joined RCD Mallorca, scoring four goals in a season which ended in top flight relegation. The following campaign he signed with top level newcomer Albacete Balompi\u00e9, only missing two games as the Castile-La Mancha club retained its league status. ===Tenerife / N\u00e0stic=== Pinilla was finally released in the summer of 1993, signing for CD Tenerife where he remained seven seasons, helping the Canary Islands team to the semi- finals of the 1996\u201397 UEFA Cup. He previously entered the club's history books when scoring its first goal ever in European competition, against AJ Auxerre on 15 September 1993; 1998\u201399 brought with it relegation, and the player followed the side into the second division. After one season with UD Salamanca, also in the second level, Pinilla joined Catalonia's Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona, freshly promoted into that tier. His seven goals, however, proved insufficient to prevent the team from being immediately relegated; in addition, a serious knee injury in the final months of the campaign forced him into the operating room which led two a six-month period of inactivity, in turn prompting his release.Pinilla: \"En Tenerife viv\u00ed cosas grandes, pero el N\u00e1stic me ha marcado m\u00e1s\" (Pinilla: \"In Tenerife i experienced great things, but N\u00e0stic touched me more\"); Marca, 4 June 2008 After recovering on his own, Pinilla was re-taken by Gimn\u00e0stic in the 2003 winter transfer window. Although he barely managed to make the team while they were in division three, he became a basic element in their return to the second level, adding five goals in the last ten days of 2005\u201306 in an historic return to the top flight. Pinilla served as captain during Gimn\u00e0stic's short-lived spell in the top division, netting twice from 28 appearances for the last-ranked team, against RCD Espanyol (4\u20130 at home) and against Athletic Bilbao (2\u20130, away). On 11 September 2007, the club was proclaimed champion of the Catalonia Cup for the first time after a 2\u20131 defeat of Barcelona \u2013 the player, who started the final, netted one of the Grana. At the end of the 2007\u201308 season, after helping N\u00e0stic retain its second tier status, Pinilla announced his retirement after having competed in 200 games overall with the club,Pinilla anuncia su retirada (Pinilla announces retirement) ; Mundo Deportivo, 13 June 2008 promptly being named its general managerAntonio Pinilla, nuevo director general del Nastic (Antonio Pinilla, new Nastic general manager); Marca, 17 June 2008 and leaving the post in early February 2010.Pinilla medita marcharse del N\u00e0stic cuanto antes (Pinilla considers leaving N\u00e0stic as soon as possible); Sport, 19 December 2009 ==International career== Pinilla never earned one full cap for Spain, but did represent the nation in various youth levels.

Pinilla also played seven matches with the unofficial Catalonia national team. ==Honours== ===Club=== Barcelona *La Liga: 1990\u201391 *Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: 1991 *UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: Runner-up 1990\u201391 Gimn\u00e0stic *Copa Catalunya: 2007 ===International=== Spain U23 *Summer Olympic Games: 1992 ==References== ==External links== * *Gimn\u00e0stic profile * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from Badalona Category:Spanish footballers Category:Catalan footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:FC Barcelona C players Category:FC Barcelona B players Category:FC Barcelona players Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:Albacete Balompi\u00e9 players Category:CD Tenerife players Category:UD Salamanca players Category:Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona footballers Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Spain under-21 international footballers Category:Spain under-23 international footballers Category:Olympic footballers of Spain Category:Footballers at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in football Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Spain ",
