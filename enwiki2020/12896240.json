    "text": "Application Development System Online (ADSO) is a tool used to expedite the writing and testing of modular applications using IDMS databases. Activities such as flow-of-control processing, data storage definition, data verification, editing, error handling, terminal input and output, menu creation and menu display are specified by using a series of screens instead of conventional detailed code. ADSO or ADS/O or just ADS is originally Cullinet product, later company was acquired by Computer Associates. == Components == ADS/O has three components ADSG, ADSA, ADSR. * ADSA (ADS Application): Used to develop and compile processes/applications * ADSG (ADS Map generator): Used to generate the screens/Maps for online application and compile the maps. * ADSR (ADS Run time): Is used to run the Maps and Application generated by ADSA and ADSG in live ADSR environment. == Tools == Other tools used along with ADS/O to develop ADS/O application are: * DME (Dictionary Module Editor) \u2013 This is an editor which is used to write the application programs. The programs created through IDD are stored in the IDD. * MAPC (Create Maps) \u2013 This utility is used to design user interfaces i.e. screens. * IDDM (Integrated Data Dictionary) \u2013 This is a menu driven utility which facilitates adding, modifying and querying objects in the Integrated Data Dictionary. ADSO can be used to develop online or batch applications. ==Benefits== * Prototype without writing much code * Review screen displays before coding process logic * Input records can be automatically edited and verified using the editing and error-handling facilities * Has a built-in debugging process * Monitors runtime performance and resource usage * Process logic can be added at any time * Testing abilities to view the data and change it if needed * Allows for step-by-step trace through application ==References== *Martin and Leben.
