    "text": "Prince of Gu\u00e9men\u00e9 is a title of French nobility associated with the fiefdom of Gu\u00e9men\u00e9-sur-Scorff in Brittany and held within the House of Rohan. The fiefdom was bought on 26 May 1377, for 3,400 sous d'or by Jean de Rohan, Viscount of Rohan. From his second marriage to Jeanne de Navarre (daughter of Philip III of Navarre) the couple had two children; the eldest Alain became the Viscount of Rohan. That branch became extinct in 1527. The youngest child, Charles, was given the fiefdom of Gu\u00e9men\u00e9. Charles was the founder of the Gu\u00e9men\u00e9 line of the House of Rohan. From this line, stem the Princes of Soubise (founded by Fran\u00e7ois de RohanYounger son of Hercule de Rohan, Duke of Montbazon) and the Princes of Rochefort (descended from Charles, Prince of Rochefort, son of Charles de Rohan). The present male line descendants live in Austria, the family having fled France due to the French Revolution. ==Lords of Gu\u00e9men\u00e9== * Jean de Rohan * Charles de Rohan (1375\u20131438) * Louis Ier (d. 1457) * Louis II (d. 1508) * Louis III (d. 1498) * Louis IV(d. 1527) * Louis V (1513\u20131557) * Louis VI (1540\u20131611) ==Princes of Gu\u00e9men\u00e9== * Louis VI (1540\u20131611) :married \u00c9l\u00e9onore de Rohan; :After the creation of the Lordship of Montbazon to a Duchy-Peerage, the principality of Gu\u00e9men\u00e9 was traditionally given to the heir of the Duke.
