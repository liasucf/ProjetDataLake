The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers at intermediate sprints (three seconds to first, two seconds to second and one second to third) and at the finish of mass-start stages; these were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages except for the individual time trial: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. The leader of the classification received a yellow jersey; it was considered the most important of the 2017 Tour de Suisse, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race. Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a black jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 5 in a stage. For winning a stage, a rider earned 10 points, with 8 for second, 6 for third, 4 for fourth and 2 for 5th place. Points towards the classification could also be accrued \u2013 awarded on a 6\u20133\u20131 scale \u2013 at intermediate sprint points during each stage; these intermediate sprints also offered bonus seconds towards the general classification as noted above. {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Points for the mountains classification |- ! scope=\"col\" | Position ! scope=\"col\" | 1 ! scope=\"col\" | 2 ! scope=\"col\" | 3 ! scope=\"col\" | 4 ! scope=\"col\" | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 20 || 15 || 10 || 6 || 4 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 12 || 8 || 6 || 4 || 2 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 8 || 6 || 4 || 2 || 1 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 3 || 2 || 1 ||colspan=2| 0 |} There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a blue jersey. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either hors, first, second, or third-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The fourth and final jersey represented the classification for Swiss riders, marked by a red jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born in Switzerland were eligible to be ranked in the classification. There was also a classification for teams, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time. In addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have been most active, or in the case of the individual time trials, the stage winner was automatically deemed the most active rider. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:smaller;\" |+ Classification leadership by stage |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\"| Stage ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16.5%;\"| Winner ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16.5%;\"| General classification link=General classification ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16.5%;\"| Mountains classification link=Mountains classification ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16.5%;\"| Points classification link=Points classification ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16.5%;\"| Swiss rider classification alt=A red jersey. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16.5%;\"| Team classification link= |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1 | Rohan Dennis |style=\"background:#FFEB64;\"| Rohan Dennis |style=\"background:lightcyan;\"| Not awarded |style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| Rohan Dennis |style=\"background:tomato;\" rowspan=2| Stefan K\u00fcng |style=\"background:#FFCD5F;\" rowspan=2| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2 | Philippe Gilbert |style=\"background:#FFEB64;\"| Stefan K\u00fcng |style=\"background:lightcyan;\" rowspan=8| Lasse Norman Hansen |style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| Nicolas Dougall |- ! scope=\"row\" | 3 | Michael Matthews |style=\"background:#FFEB64;\"| Michael Matthews |style=\"background:lightgrey;\" rowspan=2| Michael Matthews |style=\"background:tomato;\"| Michael Albasini |style=\"background:#FFCD5F;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 4 | Larry Warbasse |style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=2| Damiano Caruso |style=\"background:tomato;\" rowspan=6| Mathias Frank |style=\"background:#FFCD5F;\" rowspan=6| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 5 | Peter Sagan |style=\"background:lightgrey;\" rowspan=5| Peter Sagan |- ! scope=\"row\" | 6 | Domenico Pozzovivo |style=\"background:#FFEB64;\"| Domenico Pozzovivo |- ! scope=\"row\" | 7 | Simon \u0160pilak |style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=3| Simon \u0160pilak |- ! scope=\"row\" | 8 | Peter Sagan |- ! scope=\"row\" | 9 | Rohan Dennis |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Final !style=\"background:#FFDB00;\"| Simon \u0160pilak !style=\"background:cyan;\"| Lasse Norman Hansen !style=\"background:gray;\"| Peter Sagan !style=\"background:red;\"| Mathias Frank !style=\"background:#FFB927;\"| |} ==References== ===Sources=== * ==External links== * 2017 Category:2017 UCI World Tour Category:2017 in Swiss sport Category:June 2017 sports events in Europe ",
