    "text": "Martha daughter of Boethus (d. AD 70), in the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud, was one of the richest women in Jerusalem in the period prior to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 C.E. (Talmud Gittin 56a; see also Talmud Ketubot 104a.) After her first husband died, she became engaged to Joshua ben Gamala. (Mishnah Yevamot 6:4; Talmud Yevamot 61a.) Rav Assi said that she paid King Jannai (whom scholars identify with Herod Agrippa II) a quantity of money equal in size to 72 eggs to nominate Joshua to become High Priest of Israel (Talmud Yoma 18a), even though the Sanhedrin had not elected him to the post. (Talmud Yevamot 61a.) Even though the general rule was that a high priest should not marry a widow (Mishnah Yevamot 6:4), the couple went on to marry, and the Mishnah cites the event for the proposition that a priest who betroths a widow and subsequently becomes high priest may consummate the marriage. (Mishnah Yevamot 6:4; Talmud Yevamot 61a.) It was said of Martha's son, who was a priest, that he was so strong that he could carry up to the altar two sides of a huge ox without any lack of decorum. (Talmud Sukkah 52b.) The Talmud recounts the story of her last day during the Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70). (Talmud Gittin 56a.) At that time, Martha sent her manservant out to bring her some fine flour, but it had sold out. He told her that there was no fine flour, but there was white flour. She then sent him to bring her some white flour. By the time he went, the white flour had sold out. He told her that there was no white flour, but there was dark flour. She sent him to bring her some dark flour. By the time he went, the dark flour had sold out. He told her that there was no dark flour, but there was barley flour. She sent him to bring her some barley flour. By the time he went, the barley flour had also sold out. In desperation, without even putting on her shoes, she went out to see if she could find anything to eat. She stepped in some dung and died of shock. Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai thus applied to her the Biblical verse, \"The tender and delicate woman among you who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground.\" () Some report that she ate a fig left by Rabbi Zadok, became sick, and died. Rabbi Zadok observed fasts for 40 years in order that Jerusalem might not be destroyed. When he wanted to restore himself, they used to bring him a fig, and he used to suck the juice and throw the rest away. (Talmud Gittin 56a.) When Martha was about to die, she brought out all her gold and silver and threw it in the street, saying, \"What is the good of this to me,\" thus giving effect to the verse, \"They shall cast their silver in the streets.\" () (Talmud Gittin 56a.)
