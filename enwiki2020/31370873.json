TUC is responsible for providing a variety of local public services including roads, sanitation, drains, housing, libraries, public parks and recreational facilities. It has 12 members elected using the open list proportional representation system. ==History== Trincomalee was administered by a Local Board between 1884 and 1933. Between 1933 and 1939 the city administered by a Local Development Board. The city was promoted to an Urban Council on 1 January 1940. Trincomalee is one of the largest cities in Sri Lanka without municipality status. Cities and towns with much lower population than Trincomalee, such as Hambantota (home of President Mahinda Rajapaksa) and Akkaraipattu (home of Local Government Minister A. L. M. Athaullah), have been promoted to Municipal Council in 2011 but Trincomalee has been overlooked. ==Election results== ===1983 local government election=== Results of the local government election held on 18 May 1983: {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:right;\" ! valign=bottom align=left colspan=2|Alliances and parties !! valign=bottom align=center width=\"60\"|Votes !! valign=bottom align=center width=\"50\"|% !! valign=bottom align=center|Seats |- | bgcolor=| || align=left|Tamil United Liberation Front | 10,940 || 69.58% || 9 |- | bgcolor=| || align=left|United National Party | 2,542 || 16.17% || 2 |- | bgcolor=| || align=left|Sri Lanka Freedom Party | 2,135 || 13.58% || 1 |- | bgcolor=| || align=left|All Ceylon Tamil Congress | 106 || 0.67% || 0 |- | colspan=2 align=left|Valid Votes | 15,723 || 100.00% || 12 |- | colspan=2 align=left| Rejected Votes | 77 || colspan=2| |- | colspan=2 align=left| Total Polled | 15,800 || colspan=2| |- | colspan=2 align=left| Registered Electors | 24,529 || colspan=2| |- | colspan=2 align=left| Turnout | 64.41% || colspan=2| |} Point Pedro didn't have an elected local government for sporadic periods, this was due to various reasons.Lanka cannot afford to despise UN system Aljazeera, the Asiafoundation and the Daily Mirror attribute this to civil war;In Northern Sri Lanka, Local Governments Prepare for Post- War DevelopmentSri Lankans vote in local elections Reuters and the US State Department attribute this to calls for election boycotts by the LTTE (enforced with brutal reprisals for non compliance)Sri Lanka's war-weary north votes amid intimidation, mistrustUS State Department and the Tamilnet attribute it to The Sri Lankan government's suspension of all local government in the north and east of the country in 1983 using Emergency Regulations.
