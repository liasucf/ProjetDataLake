    "text": "Nagelkaas, also called Frisian Clove cheese,Nagelkaas (igourmet.com) is an unprotected name variant of kanterkaas, a Dutch cheese developed in the Frisian Islands of the Netherlands. It is a firm-textured gouda-style cheese made from skim pasteurized cow's milk. Its 23% butterfat content results in a mild flavor, which is augmented with the addition of cloves and cumin for a pronounced spicy taste. Its name comes from the Dutch word for clove, kruidnagel (literally 'spice nail', from the cloves's nail-like shape). It is locally known as \"nail cheese\" or, in Dutch, Nagelkaas. ==References== ==External links== *Description at Cheese.com *Encyclopedia of Cheese at igourmet.com Category:Dutch cheeses Category:Cow's-milk cheeses ",
