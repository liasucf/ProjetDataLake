He also advocates the U.S. Treasury to accept any major currency such as bitcoin and gold.

Like the party's platform, the campaign is opposed to gun control of any kind. They also oppose any attempt to go to war without a declaration of war by Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The platform also rejects letting women train or participate in combat due to the practices of dual qualification standards and forced integration undermining the \"integrity, morale, performance\" of the military organizations. Citing the 10th Amendment, the campaign supports the right of parents to provide for the education of their children, opposing any federal involvement in education. Castle advocates for the replacement of the current tax system with a \"tariff based revenue system supplemented by excise taxes\", along with repealing the 16th Amendment and abolishing the Internal Revenue Service. Citing James Madison, the platform and campaign favor a moratorium on immigration to the United States until proper security procedures and the discontinuation of all federal subsidies and assistance, except under extreme circumstances. They also reject giving citizenship to children of immigrants born in the country, extension of amnesty and bilingual ballots along with supporting English as the official language for all government business. ==Polling== ===Statewide=== ====Nevada==== Five-way race {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Poll source !Date administered !Democrat !% !Republican !% !Libertarian !% !IAPN !% !Unaffiliated !% !Lead margin !Sample size !Margin of error |- |Suffolk University | September 27\u201329, 2016 | |Hillary Clinton | |44% | Donald Trump | 38% | Gary Johnson | 7% | Darrell Castle | 1% | Rocky De La Fuente | 1% | align=\"center\" | 6 | 500 | \u00b1 4.4% |- | Suffolkhttp://www.suffolk.edu/documents/SUPRC/8_18_2016_Marginals.pdf | August 15\u201317, 2016 | | Hillary Clinton | align=center| 43.8% | Donald Trump | 41.6% | Gary Johnson | 4.8% | Darrell Castle | 1% | Rocky De La Fuente | 1% | align=center| 2.2 | 500 | \u00b1 4.4% |} ====South Dakota==== Four-way race {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Poll source !Date administered !Democrat !% !Republican !% !Libertarian !% !Other candidate !% !Lead margin !Sample size !Margin of error |- |Nielson Brothers Polling |October 24\u201326, 2016 |Hillary Clinton |35% ||Donald Trump ||49% |Gary Johnson |7% |Darrell Castle |1% | align=\"center\" |14 |600 |4% |- |Remington Research Group |October 19\u201321, 2016 |Hillary Clinton |37% ||Donald Trump ||48% |Gary Johnson |6% |Darrell Castle |2% | align=\"center\" |11 |1,115 |2.93% |} ====Utah==== Six-way race {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Poll source !Date administered !Democrat !% !Republican !% !Libertarian !% !Green !% !Constitution !% !Independent !% !Lead margin !Sample size !Margin of error |- |Dan Jones & Associates |September 1\u20139, 2016 | Hillary Clinton | 24% ||Donald Trump ||39% | Gary Johnson | 13% | Jill Stein | 0% | Darrell Castle | 2% | Evan McMullin | 9% | align=\"center\" |15 | 605 |\u00b1 3.98% |- | Public Policy Polling | August 19\u201321, 2016 | Hillary Clinton | 24% | | Donald Trump | | 39% | Gary Johnson | 12% | Jill Stein | 5% | Darrell Castle | 2% | Evan McMullin | 9% | align=\"center\" | 15 | 1,018 | \u00b1 3.1% |} ==Endorsements== ;People * Glenn Beck, radio hostrescinded endorsement in favor of Evan McMullin *Chuck Baldwin, 2008 Constitution Party Presidential Candidate *Matthew Carr, writer at Liberty Hangout *Sam Bushman, The host of Liberty Roundtable *Dan Phillips MD, Professor of Psychiatry *Rebecca Kiessling, International Pro-Life Speaker ;Organizations *Georgia Right to Life, A Pro-Life Political Action Committee ==References== ==External links== * Official campaign site * Constitution Party site Castle, Darrell Castle, Darrell Category:Constitution Party (United States) ",
