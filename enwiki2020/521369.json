In invertebrates, the term usually refers to tubular mouthparts used for feeding and sucking. In vertebrates, a proboscis is an elongated nose or snout. ==Etymology== First attested in English in 1609 from Latin proboscis, the latinisation of the Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03af\u03c2 (proboskis),\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03af\u03c2, Henry George Liddell, Robert S, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library which comes from \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc (pro) \"forth, forward, before\"\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library \\+ \u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9 (bosko), \"to feed, to nourish\".\u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library The plural as derived from the Greek is proboscides, but in English the plural form proboscises occurs frequently. Unidentified fly cleaning its proboscis ==Invertebrates== The most common usage is to refer to the tubular feeding and sucking organ of certain invertebrates such as insects (e.g., moths, butterflies, and mosquitoes, worms (including Acanthocephala, proboscis worms) and gastropod molluscs. ===Acanthocephala=== Scanning electron microscopy of proboscis of an Acanthocephala The Acanthocephala or thorny-headed worms, or spiny-headed worms are characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis, armed with spines, which it uses to pierce and hold the gut wall of its host. ===Lepidoptera mouth parts=== The mouth parts of Lepidoptera mainly consist of the sucking kind; this part is known as the proboscis or 'haustellum'. The proboscis consists of two tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. The proboscis contains muscles for operating. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction takes place due to the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head.Evans, W. H. (1927) Identification of Indian Butterflies, The Diocesan press. Introduction, pp. 1\u201335. A specific example of the proboscis being used for feeding is in the species Deilephila elpenor. In this species, the moth hovers in front of the flower and extends its long proboscis to attain its food. A few Lepidoptera species lack mouth parts and therefore do not feed in the imago. Others, such as the family Micropterigidae, have mouth parts of the chewing kind.Charles A. Triplehorn and Norman F. Johnson (2005). Borror and Delong's Introduction to the Study of Insects (7th edition). Thomson Brooks/Cole, Belmont, CA. The study of insect mouthparts was helpful for the understanding of the functional mechanism of the proboscis of butterflies (Lepidoptera) to elucidate the evolution of new form-function. The study of the proboscis of butterflies revealed surprising examples of adaptations to different kinds of fluid food, including nectar, plant sap, tree sap, dung and of adaptations to the use of pollen as complementary food in Heliconius butterflies. An extremely long proboscis appears within different groups of flower-visiting insects, but is relatively rare. === Gastropods === {| |Proboscis of a predatory marine snail Mitra mitra. |Kellet's whelks feeding on a dead fish using a long, prehensile proboscis. |} ==Vertebrates== The elephant's trunk and the tapir's elongated nose are called \"proboscis\", as is the snout of the male elephant seal. The proboscis monkey is named for its enormous nose. An abnormal facial appendage that sometimes accompanies ocular and nasal abnormalities in humans is also called a proboscis. Notable mammals with some form of proboscis are: * Aardvark * Anteater * Members of the elephant family (see elephant trunk) * Elephant shrews * Hispaniolan solenodon * Echidna * Elephant seal * Leptictidium (extinct) * Moeritherium (extinct) * Numbat * Proboscis monkey * Saiga * Members of the Tapir family ==References== Category:Animal anatomy ",
