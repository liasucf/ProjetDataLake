He won the old English First Division Football League with his beloved Everton in the 1914\u201315 season. Fleetwood later in his career signed for Oldham Athletic but returned to Everton as a scout then had the honour of becoming Chief Scout and had a large influence in the signing/scouting of The legendary 'DIXIE DEAN' & 'TOMMY LAWTON.
