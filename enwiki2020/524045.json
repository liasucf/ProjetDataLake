    "text": "The Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Time Zone observes Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Standard Time (HST), by subtracting ten hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC\u221210:00). The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time of the 150th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory. The zone takes its name from the two areas it includes: Hawaii and the portion of Alaska's Aleutian Islands west of 169\u00b0 30\u2032 W longitude. During daylight saving time (DST), the Alaskan portion observes Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Daylight Time (HADT, UTC\u221209:00), while Hawaii stays on standard time. From 1900 until 1947, UTC\u221210:30 was used as standard time in Hawaii. French Polynesia uses UTC\u221210:00 for its major cities. The Cook Islands also use the same time. These areas do not use DST. \"Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Time Zone\" is a U.S. term and for that reason the Polynesian areas are not considered to be a part of the Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Time Zone. The largest city in the Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Time Zone is Honolulu; the Honolulu Metropolitan Area is the largest metropolitan area in the zone. == Major metropolitan areas == *Honolulu, Hawaii *Hilo, Hawaii *Kahului, Hawaii *Kailua-Kona, Hawaii *Kapaa, Hawaii == Other significant places == *Adak Island, Alaska *Johnston Atoll ==See also== *Time zone *Time offset *Effects of time zones on North American broadcasting ==References== ==External links== *HST \u2013 Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Standard Time *HDT \u2013 Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Daylight Time *The official U.S. time for the Hawaii\u2013Aleutian time zone (Hawaii) dead link *The official U.S. time for the Hawaii\u2013Aleutian time zone (Aleutian Islands) dead link *What are the time zones in the United States?
