Anna Susanna was one of those.Sylvia Kl\u00f6tzer. Satire und Macht: Film, Zeitung, Kabarett in der DDR. B\u00f6hlau Verlag (2005). . Page 28. Although the film had a plot suiting the government's policy, the DEFA Board was very reluctant to allow Richard Nicolas, for whom the picture was his debut as a director, to make Anna Susanna. Nicolas had threatened to resign if he would not be allowed to direct it, and was eventually granted permission.Ralf Schenk. Das zweite Leben der Filmstadt Babelsberg. DEFA- Spielfilme 1946\u20131992. . Page 67. The film was also noted for being one of the first DEFA pictures to employ primitive special effects, such as building a miniature ship model that was wrecked in an aquarium.Werner Reff, Istv\u00e1n V\u00e1s\u00e1rhelyi. Der Filmtrick und der Trickfilm. Fotokinoverlag VEB (1963). ASIN B0000BT6IC. Pages 21\u201322. ==Reception== Heinz Kersten quoted an East German official who told that \"the times in which pictures like Anna Susanna, that damaged the image of DEFA in the eyes of the people... should not return.\"Heinz Kersten. Das Filmwesen in der Sowjetischen Besatzungszone Deutschlands. Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesamtdeutsche Fragen (1963). ASIN B0000BK48Q. page 38. The West German Catholic Film Service described it as \"rather well-developed, thrilling crime film... but filled with typical criticism of the capitalist system.\"Anna Susanna on the German Film Lexicon. ==References== ==External links== * *Anna Susanna original poster on ostfilm.de. *Anna Susanna on cinema.de. *Anna Susanna on DEFA Foundation's website. *Anna Susanna on PROGRESS' website.
