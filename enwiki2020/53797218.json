    "text": "Tony Lee Bradley Jr. (born January 8, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the University of North Carolina (UNC). A 6'10 center, Bradley was a primary substitute for the Tar Heels' 2017 NCAA championship team. He was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers with the 28th overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft. ==High school career== Born and raised in Bartow, Florida, Bradley played high school basketball for Bartow High School. He was named a McDonald's All-American in his senior year. Bradley chose North Carolina over Kansas, Florida, Florida State, Vanderbilt, Alabama, Miami and NC State. Bradley was rated as a five-star recruit and was ranked 17th in the ESPN 100 for the Class of 2016. ==College career== In his freshman season, Bradley served as the primary substitute for senior Kennedy Meeks, averaging 7.5 points and 5.1 rebounds in 14.6 minutes per game and providing strong offensive rebounding for the Tar Heels. Following the Tar Heels' championship win over Gonzaga, Bradley announced that he would declare his eligibility for the 2017 NBA draft without signing an agent, leaving open the opportunity to return to UNC for his sophomore season. Bradley ultimately chose to remain in the NBA Draft, becoming the third \"one-and-done\" player during Williams' tenure at UNC and the second among those to have won a national championship. ==Professional career== ===Utah Jazz (2017\u2013present)=== Bradley was selected 28th overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2017 NBA Draft with his draft rights traded to the Utah Jazz. On July 5, 2017, Bradley signed with the Jazz. He made his NBA debut on November 5 against the Houston Rockets. He was assigned to the Jazz' G League affiliate, the Salt Lake City Stars on November 7, and made his G League debut the next night, scoring 20 points in a loss to the Wisconsin Herd. ==Career statistics== ===NBA=== ====Regular season==== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Utah | 9 || 0 || 3.2 || .273 || .000 || 1.000 || 1.2 || .1 || .0 || .0 || .9 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Utah | 3 || 0 || 12.0 || .500 || \u2014 || .500 || 5.0 || .3 || .7 || .7 || 5.7 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Utah | 58 || 3 || 11.4 || .667 || 1.000 || .652 || 4.6 || .4 || .2 || .6 || 4.9 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 70 || 3 || 10.4 || .634 || .750 || .660 || 4.2 || .4 || .2 || .5 || 4.4 ====Playoffs==== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2018 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Utah | 1 || 0 || 2.0 || .500 || \u2013 || \u2013 || 1.0 || .0 || .0 || .0 || 2.0 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 2020 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Utah | 6 || 0 || 8.1 || .222 || \u2013 || .714 || 3.8 || .2 || .3 || .3 || 1.5 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text- align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 7 || 0 || 7.2 || .273 || \u2013 || .714 || 3.4 || .1 || .3 || .3 || 1.6 ===NBA G League=== ====Regular season==== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2017\u201318 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Salt Lake City | 24 || 24 || 29.6 || .581 || .000 || .814 || 10.0 || 1.3 || .7 || 1.3 || 15.4 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 24 || 24 || 29.6 || .581 || .000 || .814 || 10.0 || 1.3 || .7 || 1.3 || 15.4 ===College=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2016\u201317 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| North Carolina | 38 || 0 || 14.6 || .573 || \u2013 || .619 || 5.1 || .6 || .3 || .6 || 7.1 ==References== ==External links== *North Carolina Tar Heels bio Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:African- American basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players at the 2017 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from Florida Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Los Angeles Lakers draft picks Category:McDonald's High School All- Americans Category:North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Salt Lake City Stars players Category:Sportspeople from Bartow, Florida Category:Utah Jazz players ",
