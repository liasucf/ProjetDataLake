It is approximately 435 km from Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott. == Overview == The city sits within the \"Chemama\" Riverine zone along the north bank of the River Senegal where it connects with the Gorgol River. This region is one of the few areas of settled agriculture in the country. Culturally, the city is among the most diverse in Mauritania, consisting of ethnic \"White Moors\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0646) and \"Black Moors\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646), as well as Pulaar, and Soninke communities. Houses in Kaedi It is known as a market town, a medical centre, and a centre for local farmers. The market reflects the sub-Saharan culture of neighboring Senegal somewhat more than the Moorish-Arabic culture found further north in the country. Kaedi Regional Hospital Most of the architecture consists of brown, flat-roofed buildings, undistinguished except that most are surrounded by \"dutch brick\" enclosures. The one exception is the unusual architecture of the Ka\u00e9di Regional Hospital, which was constructed in 1989 and features multiple beehive-style domes. The award-winning architecture was designed by the Association for the Development of Traditional African Urbanism and Architecture (ADAUA), which aims to develop indigenous African urban architectural designs using local materials and technologies. Ka\u00e9di, like many cities along the Senegal River, was deeply affected by ethnic strife in 1989, and has yet to fully recover economically. == Transport == == See also == * Transport in Mauritania * Railway stations in Mauritania == References == Category:Gorgol Region Category:Regional capitals in Mauritania Category:Communes of Mauritania ",
