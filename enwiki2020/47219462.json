The submarine was laid down on 1 December 1941 at the Blohm & Voss yard at Hamburg, launched on 20 August 1942, and commissioned on 8 October 1942 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Hans- Harald Speidel. Attached to 5th U-boat Flotilla based at Kiel, U-643 completed her training period on 30 June 1943 and was assigned to front-line service. ==Design== German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-643 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri & Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-643 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and one twin C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. ==Service history== On 8 October 1943, while operating against convoy SC 143, U-643 was detected by Liberator R of No. 86 Squadron RAF. The aircraft strafed the U-boat but had to return to base short on fuel. Another British aircraft, Liberator Z of the same squadron, continued the attack on U-643, which attempted to dive. Four depth charged were dropped in the wake of the diving U-boat, which resulted in an oil spill. Liberator Z returned to the convoy, only to return an hour later to find Liberator T of No. 120 Squadron RAF attacking an U-boat, which turned out to be U-643. The two aircraft attacked with depth charges and strafed the U-boat. When two more Liberators arrived at the scene, the U-boat's crew prepared to abandon ship. Upon arrival of the destroyer the U-boat was scuttled, 18 survivors were picked up by Orwell. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==External links== * Category:World War II submarines of Germany Category:German Type VIIC submarines Category:1942 ships Category:Ships built in Hamburg Category:U-boats commissioned in 1942 Category:U-boats scuttled in 1943 Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean ",
