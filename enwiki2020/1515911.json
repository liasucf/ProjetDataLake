Pair of six-panel folding screens; color, ink, and gold on paper; 174.3 \u00d7 381.6 cm of Japanese painting was founded in the early Muromachi period (14th\u201315th centuries),,p.988 and was devoted to yamato-e, paintings specializing in subject matter and techniques derived from ancient Japanese art, as opposed to schools influenced by Chinese art, notably the Kan\u014d school (\u72e9\u91ce\u6d3e). Tosa school paintings are characterised by \"areas of flat opaque colour enclosed by simple outlines, where drawing is precise and conventional\", with many narrative subjects from Japanese literature and history. However, by the 17th century both Tosa and Kan\u014d artists broadened their range, and the distinction between these and other schools became less clear.Watson, pp. 38\u201339, 38 quoted; Paine & Soper, p. 202 The origins of this school of painting can be traced to (fl. first half 15th century), Encyclopedia of World Art\"\", pp. 1032\u20133 who first used the professional name of Tosa, though unverified claims to earlier origins were made later by Mitsunobu (1434?\u2013?1525) who formally founded the school. Mitsunobu served as the official painter (edokoro-azukari) at the imperial court, specializing in courtly subjects painted in the yamato-e (\u3084\u307e\u3068\u7d75) style. The Tosa school under Mitsunobu retained the position of () for three generations, until 1569, and regained the post 1634 under Mitsunori (See #History below). Until the 17th century, the Tosa school painted for the court and aristocratic patrons, which favored such painting subjects as scenes from the classic Tale of Genji (\u6e90\u6c0f\u7d75), but in later years, the school's range expanded to include bird-and-flower painting and other Chinese-inspired themes and styles. In general, the Tosa style is characterized by rather flat, decorative compositions, fine linework, great attention to detail, and brilliant color. ==History== It is starting with Tosa Mitsunobu that a definite art school (atelier, workshop) and family line can be established. But Mitsunobu purports that the origins of the school can be traced back further to who held the post of in 1355\u20131371. Encyclopedia of World Art\"\", pp.1032\u20131033> The earliest documentary evidence for an artist using the name Tosa are two early 15th-century references to a man named Fujiwara Yukihiro (\u85e4\u539f \u884c\u5e83) (fl. 1406\u20131434) who was also known as Tosa Sh\u014dgen (\u571f\u4f50 \u5c06\u76e3), a title derived from his position as governor of Tosa Province. Yukihiro's activity as a painter is known primarily from an inscription on illustrated handscrolls of the Stories of the Origin of Y\u016bz\u016b Nembutsu (\u878d\u901a\u5ff5\u4ecf\u7e01\u8d77); 1414, Seiry\u014dji (\u6e05\u6dbc\u5bfa), Kyoto. A bloodline descent from Yukimitsu to Mitsunobu (father-son?) is speculated, but the family document lacks records covering that period. Mitsunobu's daughter married Kan\u014d Motonobu, head of the Kan\u014d school, which increased the tendency of Kan\u014d artists, already using two distinct styles, to work in a Tosa style when occasion demanded.Paine & Soper, p. 180 The surviving paintings that can be attributed to Mitsunobu show less quality than his reputation in historical sources would suggest,Paine & Soper, p. 182 but many fine works remain from Mitsunobu's hand. Although he painted both Buddhist paintings and portraits in addition to the standard repertoire of courtly themes, he is best known for his illustrated handscrolls, emaki (\u7d75\u5dfb), such as The Legends of Kiyomizu-dera (\u6e05\u6c34\u5bfa\u7e01\u8d77). Illustration of the Genji Monogatari ch.42 \u2013 \u5302\u5bae Ni\u014d no Miya (\"The Perfumed Prince\") Credited to Tosa Mitsuoki (1617\u20131691). The Tosa school's art tradition was passed from Mitsunobu to (1496 \u2013 ) under whom the fortunes of the school began to decline, then to , but Mitsumochi perished in battle in 1569 causing the family to lose their position as head of the painting bureau (edokoro- azukari). The headship of the school passed to (1539\u20131613), whose relationship with his predecessors is uncertain. Mitsuyoshi eventually left the capital and his post and settled in the city of Sakai (\u583a), a port city near Osaka, where he sold paintings to the local townspeople. Mitsumochi also moved away from the traditional Tosa themes to specialize in bird-and-flower paintings. During this period, the stewardship of the imperial painting bureau passed from the Tosa school into the hands of Kan\u014d school painters. Mitsuyoshi's son, Mitsunori (\u5149\u5247) (1583\u20131638) continued to live and work in Sakai, painting for townsmen, until 1634, p.210 when he moved to the capital with his eldest son, Mitsuoki (\u5149\u8d77) (1617\u20131691) at the invitation of Emperor Go-Mizunoo, where Mitsunori began painting ceremonial fans for the court. Twenty years later, in 1654, Mitsuoki won back the position of edokoro-azukari for the family, which enabled him to revive the school. Mitsuoki rejuvenated the traditional Tosa style by introducing elements from Chinese painting. He is particularly noted for his elegant paintings of quail, as for example, the Chrysanthemum and Quail screens which he painted with the help of his son Mitsunari (\u5149\u6210) (1646\u20131710).Paine & Soper, pp. 210\u2013211 Mitsuoki's successors headed the Imperial painting bureau until the end of the Edo period, but their reliance on imitating the style of Mitsuoki, rather than developing new techniques or themes, led to the production of works that were increasingly static and conventional. However, Mitsusada (1738\u20131806), a dedicated practitioner of the Tosa traditions, managed to effect a temporary Tosa revival. British Museum, \"Tosa Mitsusada, Quails and Wheat, a hanging scroll painting\". Retrieved on 13 December 2013. Artists of the school but not the family were more significant, notably Sumiyoshi Jokei (1599\u20131670), a pupil of Mitsuyoshi, and his son Gukei Sumiyoshi (1631\u20131705), whose work revitalized the original tradition of small narrative scrolls with emphasis on details of everyday life. Reviving interest in Japanese history in the 18th and 19th centuries kept demand for Tosa style work alive, but the style of the school, with its thin line and reliance on detail was less suited to the larger hanging-scrolls that were now the format preferred by patrons. The interest in painting everyday life of the Tosa school was influential on the ukiyo-e school of paintings and prints, especially on the aristocratic painter Iwasa Matabei (1578\u20131650), who is regarded as one of the founders of ukiyo-e. ==Tosa artists of note== *Tosa Yukihiro *Tosa Mitsunobu *Tosa Mitsuoki * (1496 \u2013 c.1559) *Tosa Mitsumoto (fl. 1530\u20131569) *Tosa Mitsuyoshi (1539\u20131613) *Tosa Mitsunori (1583\u20131638) *Tosa Mitsusada (1738\u20131806) *Tosa Mitsuzane (1780\u20131852) *Iwasa Matabei *Awataguchi Takamitsu ==Notes== ==References== *Burke, Richard.
