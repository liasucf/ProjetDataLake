    "text": "Ones and Sixes is the eleventh studio album by Low, released on September 11, 2015. It was co-produced by the band and engineer BJ Burton, at Justin Vernon's April Base Studios in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Sub Pop released a promotional video for 'No Comprende' in advance of the album's release, on June 23, 2015. The album also features contributions from Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche. The album artwork was created by artist Peter Liversidge. The album's lyrics were nominated for an AML Award. ==Composition== Musically, a shift made itself evident to critics reviewing Ones and Sixes, reaping generally positive assessments. While its predecessor The Invisible Way saw Jeff Tweedy of Wilco handling the production duties, Ones and Sixes would feature Bon Iver associate B.J. Burton producing alongside Low for the first time. The change in technical personnel would result in the trio's sound being \"pushed, pulled and wrangled out of shape to devastating effect,\" \"striking a balance between their majestic, slow-moving melancholy and harsher experimental noise.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Low (band) albums Category:Sub Pop albums ",
