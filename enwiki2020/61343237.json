    "text": "Fluorooxoborate is one of a series of anions or salts that contain boron linked to both oxygen and fluorine. Several structures are possible, rings, or chains. They contain [BOxF4\u2212x](x+1)\u2212 units BOF32\u2212 BO2F23\u2212, or BO3F14\u2212. In addition there can be borate BO3 triangles and BO4 tetrahedrons. These can then be linked by sharing oxygen atoms, and when they do that, the negative charge is reduced. They are distinct from the fluoroborates in which fluorine is bonded to the metals rather than the boron atoms. For example KBBF, KBe2BO3F2 is a fluoroborate and has more fluorine and oxygen than can be accommodated by the boron atom. Common properties are a wide range of transparency from deep ultraviolet (DUV) to near infrared (NIR); non-linear optical response, meaning that a high intensity light will have some power converted to double the frequency; birefringence. The transparency deep into the ultraviolet corresponds to a large band gap, whereby it takes a lot of energy to shift an electron in the material. Compared to borates, fluorooxoborates are more likely to have lower dimensional structures such as layers or chains, as there is less oxygen connections available. Fluorooxoborates are more likely to be noncentrosymmetric as adding one fluorine atom to a boron reduces symmetry. ==Liquid state== When dissolved, the nature of the fluorooxoborate ions present depends on the boron to oxygen ratio. At the lowest oxygen levels BF4\u2212 exists, and is converted by oxygen to F3BOBF32\u2212. With boron to oxygen ratios near 1, the cyclic B3O3F63\u2212 ion predominates. ==Compounds== ===B1=== BaBOF3 contains a one-dimensional chain of -OBF2O-\u2212 and extra F\u2212 ===B2=== SnB2O3F2 crystal system rhombohedral space group P31m 250 nm UV cutoff Z = 1, a = 4.5072 \u00c5, c = 4.7624 \u00c5; stable up to 325 \u00b0C.
