Notable burials: heart of Antoine de Chabannes, whose body was laid to rest in Dammartin-en-Go\u00eble; burials of his wife Marguerite de Nanteuil (ca. 1422-1475), and of his son and successor Jean de Chabannes (1462-1503). * Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Fargeau (Saint-Fargeau Castle) mostly built in the 15th and 17th centuries. * Mus\u00e9e de l'Aventure du Son (Museum of Sound Discovery) displaying more than 1000 gramophones, radios and mechanical musical instruments. ==Personalities== * Antoine de Chabannes, a significant figure of France's 15th-century history, acquired Saint-Fargeau and other lands in Puisaye previously held by the disgraced Jacques Coeur. He reconstructed the castle in the late 1460s and made other investments in the town, including the foundation of a hospital. * In the early years of the reign of Louis XIV, the ch\u00e2teau was the home to his exiled cousin, the wealthy Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans.Wilson, Katharina M., \"An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers\", P863. Published 1991, Taylor & Francis. She lived in the ch\u00e2teau of the town, giving the building its present appearance. The building also has her monogram over its main entrance. She held the title of duchesse de Saint- Fargeau in her own right. A fire in 1752 and further damage in 1850 has largely destroyed the original building. * Jean d'Ormesson - a French novelist, mostly writing partially or totally autobiographic novels. He was brought up at the ch\u00e2teau and was born in 1925. * Robert Gall 1918 - 1990 - was a French lyricist. ==See also== *Communes of the Yonne department ==References== *INSEE == External links == * Official website(in French) * Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Fargeau * Museum of Sound Discovery Category:Communes of Yonne ",
