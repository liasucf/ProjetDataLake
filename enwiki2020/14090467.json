While still there he attended Un'ichi Hiratsuka's extracurricular woodblock printing course, and in the same year he became quality controller at the Takamizawa Woodblock Print Company. He was conscripted into the army in 1943. In 1945 he had lost his house, his atelier and nearly all his early works. Around 1950 he had sufficiently recovered to start painting again. At the same time he started making S\u014dsaku Hanga, both figurative and abstract prints. He was known as a constant innovator and he was generally considered one of the best post-World War II S\u014dsaku Hanga artists. ==External links== * Biography of Hideo Hagiwara * Gallery * Biography and prints of Hideo Hagiwara Category:1913 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Artists from Yamanashi Prefecture Category:20th-century Japanese painters ",
