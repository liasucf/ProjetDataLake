    "text": "The Pharmacy Guild of Australia is the Pharmacy Owners' representative, but not the Pharmacy Profession body. The 5,700 community pharmacies across Australia provide 450 million individual patient visits annually and employ over 65,000 Pharmacists and Pharmacy Assistants. The vast majority of the 300 million prescriptions dispensed under the Federal Government's subsidised Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). A major Guild activity at all levels is close liaison and negotiation with governments, manufacturers, wholesalers and other organisations in the health care delivery system. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia was established in 1928 as the Federated Pharmaceutical Services Guild of Australia and is registered under the federal Fair Work Act 2009 (Registered Organisations Act) as an employers' organization and as a Registered Training Organisation.https://training.gov.au/Search/SearchOrganisation?Name=pharmacy+guild&IncludeUnregisteredRtos;=true&IncludeUnregisteredRtos;=false&IncludeNotRtos;=true&IncludeNotRtos;=false&orgSearchByNameSubmit;=Search&AdvancedSearch;=&JavaScriptEnabled;=truehttps://www.guild.org.au/about- us ==Structure and function== The Pharmacy Guild of Australia is a single legal entity and is structured as follows: ===National Council=== The National Council is the supreme governing body.

The pharmacy agreements set out the amounts of the various fees ('pharmacy remuneration') pharmacies are paid to dispense PBS and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) medicines, as well as the estimated total cost of pharmacy remuneration over the life of the agreement. The more recent agreements also provide for the funding of various programs intended to improve the use of PBS and RPBS medicines in the community. The agreements also establish a Community Service Obligation (CSO) funding pool to be drawn on by pharmaceutical wholesalers that can meet specified service standards for supplying PBS and RPBS medicines to retail pharmacies. The estimated total cost of these successive agreements, including the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement (6CPA), is $64 billion.https://www.anao.gov.au/work/performance- audit/community-pharmacy-agreement-follow-on-audit ==The Guild Group of Companies== ===Guild Insurance=== Established in 1963, Guild Insurance provides business insurance, professional indemnity, home & contents and car insurance.https://www.guildgroup.com.au/company ===Guild Super=== Established in 1994, Guild Trustee Services Pty Limited (GTS) is the trustee for the Guild Retirement Fund (GRF), which includes GuildSuper, Child Care Super and GuildPension.https://www.guildsuper.com.au/about-guild-super ===Meridian Lawyers=== Established in 2004, with the aim of providing legal services.
