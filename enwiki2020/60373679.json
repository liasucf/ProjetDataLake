    "text": "{| |} Russian submarine Bars (\"Leopard\") was a warship, the lead submarine of her class, built for the Imperial Russian Navy during the First World War. She was active in the Baltic and was lost there in 1917. ==Design== Bars was ordered under the 1913 Programme for the Baltic Fleet, and was laid down at the Baltic shipyard in St. Petersburg. She was powered by diesel/electric propulsion, though a shortage of diesel engines meant the boats were equipped with a variety of machinery, as it became available. Armament, too, varied as to availability; Bars was armed with 2 x 63mm guns, as opposed to the single 63mm and single 37mm gun she was designed for.Conway p316 The design originally had external torpedoes as well as internal torpedo tubes; these were carried in drop-collars in recessed niches low in the hull. Trials with Bars showed these to be unsuitable and subsequent vessels had the niches and drop-collars moved to the upper deck; Bars was later refitted to this pattern, before their ultimate complete removal. Bars was launched on 2 June 1915 and entered service the following month. ==Service history== Bars entered service with the Baltic Fleet on 12 July 1915. She undertook numerous war patrols in the Baltic, targeting German warships during the 1915 ice-free season, but with little success.Halpern p202 In 1916 she was employed attacking German iron-ore shipments along the Swedish coast, though again with little success, due to the restrictions imposed by Swedish neutrality.Halpern p205 ==Fate== On May 1917 Bars left port on her last patrol, and did not return. It is suggested by some that she was sunk in a depth-charge attack by German patrol boats on 28 May 1917, though other sources suggest she was lost in a minefield off Norrk\u00f6ping.Bars at deepstorm.ru (Russian) The actual cause of her loss is unknown. ==Notes== ==References== * Gardiner R, Gray R (1985) Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1906\u20131921 * Halpern, Paul (1994) A Naval History of World War I US Naval Institute ==External links== * Bars at deepstorm.ru (Russian) * Loss of submarine Bars at dive-tek.ru (Russian) Category:Submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy Category:World War I submarines of Russia ",
