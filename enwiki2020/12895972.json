It is found in coastal and subcoastal semi-deciduous forests of Cuba (Pinar del R\u00edo and Oriente), the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and possibly Puerto Rico. Its habitat has been declining rapidly under pressure from charcoal makers, logging, and the clearing of forest for human habitation. ==References== valenzuelana Category:Plants described in 1850 Category:Vulnerable plants Category:Flora of Cuba Category:Flora of the Dominican Republic Category:Flora of Haiti Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
