He travelled extensively in a motor caravan (RV) that he designed and built himself. Weston was a pioneer of aviation in South Africa.Oberholzer H. \"Pioneers of early aviation in South Africa.\" Memoirs van die Nasionale Museum, Memoir No 7, 1974.Illsley J. W. \"In Southern skies a pictorial history of early aviation in Southern Africa 1816 - 1940.\" Jonathan Ball Publishers, 2003. In 1911, Weston founded the Aeronautical Society of South Africa. The Society hosts a bi- annual memorial lecture in his honour. Aeronautical Society of South Africa website.

Retrieved 11 April 2016. in an ox wagon at Fort Marshall, northern Natal, South Africa. His father's name is unknown. His parents may have been British. Weston's mother and sister, Lucy, died in China of cholera in 1928. His registration of birth is missing from the national records in Pretoria. ==Early career== In 1888 Weston was apprenticed as an engineer to the J. Jaspar company in Liege, Belgium and then worked for de Puydt and Poncin Lighting and Power Company, where he rose to the position of partner and technical advisor. In 1900 - 1901, Weston established M. Weston and Co., (Manufacture de la Lampe a arc, 1900) a company manufacturing electrical lights in Liege. Weston returned to South Africa during the Second Boer War to fight on the side of the Boers. Left poor after the war, Weston borrowed \u00a3100 from a friend and went to America.\"A Modern Voortrekker.\" Sunday Times, Johannesburg, Transvaal, 11 May 1924 In 1903, Weston applied for membership of the British Institute of Electrical Engineers and the company opened an office in Birkenhead, Liverpool. With the assistance of the Russian Embassy in Washington, Weston was employed as an engineer for the Chinese Eastern Railway, working on a stretch near Lake Baikal. It was here he learned to speak Russian. The railway was to be finished by 1905 but on 8 February 1904, Japan declared war on Russia. Initially stranded, Weston escaped via Port Arthur, Manchuria. Subsequently, he travelled widely to seek work. Weston was admitted as a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society on 17 September 1904. Weston returned to South Africa in early 1905. In August 1906, he married Elizabeth (Lily) Maria Jacoba Roux in Bloemfontein. The couple had three children: Anna MacDougal (b. 1908), Kathleen (b. 1912), and Maximilian John (b. 1915). Weston became a farmer in Doornpoort and later in Kalkdam. In May 1909, the family moved to Brandfort, Free State. ==Contribution to aviation== In 1907 - 1908, at Kalkdam, Weston built an aeroplane from a plan by Gabriel Voisin with a Panhard engine, but it was under-powered and never flew. On 14 September 1910, Weston arrived in England en route to France to pursue his interest in aviation.The National Archives. \"UK Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878\u20131960\". www.ancestry.co.uk ===France=== In France, Weston trained at the Henri Farman flying school at \u00c9tampes. On 30 December 1910, Weston flew solo at \u00c9tampes and on 5 January 1911, passed his pilot test.L\u2019Aero, 1 and 8 January 1911 He was granted aviator certificate No. 357 by the French Aero Club on 3 February 1911. ===Brandfort=== Weston returned to South Africa in 1911 with an aircraft powered by a 50 hp Gnome engine. The aeroplane was called the Weston-Farman. At Brandfort, Weston imported and sold aeroplanes and parts. These included the Bl\u00e9riot monoplane, the Farman and the Bristol biplane, Gnome engines and Chauvi\u00e9re propellers. ===Aeronautical Society of South Africa=== Weston was a founding member of the Aeronautical Society of South Africa. He also established the John Weston Aviation Company to raise funds for the establishment of a flying school with a permanent aerodrome. The company's wealthy sponsors funded flying demonstrations in South Africa and Mozambique. In December 1909, the Frenchman, Albert Kimmerling made the first powered flight in South Africa in East London. In June, 1911, Weston flew the Weston-Farman for eight and a half minutes at Kimberley. It was a South African record for the duration of a flight. Demonstrations of the company's five aircraft (one Weston-Farman, three Bristols and one Farman) followed at Johannesburg, Lorenzo Marques, Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Kenilworth, East London, King Williams Town and Queenstown. ===Difficulties=== In 1912, Weston was unsuccessful in his efforts to be appointed as an adviser to the government of Jan Smuts in the investment in military aircraft and pilot training. At that time, the flying demonstrations drew large crowds, but little investment. In January 1913, arrangements were made for flying demonstrations at Brandfort. A large crowd had assembled on the racecourse when a dust storm began and destroyed the aeroplane. Then, in early February, 1912, the Brandfort hangar was destroyed by arson. Weston dismissed the offer of a joint venture with aviator, Cecil Compton Paterson. On 1 July 1913, the Paterson Aviation Syndicate was registered in Kimberley and on 10 September 1913, Paterson and the Union government entered into an agreement concerning the training of the first South African military pilots for what would later become the South African Air Force. ==World War I== Weston had moved to the England in June 1913 and by October 1913 was working with the Willow's Aircraft Company on military dirigibles. In February 1914, he received British Aeronaut's Certificate No. 38 (for flying balloons) as well as Airship Pilot's Certificate No.23.\"Committee Meeting.\"Flight 7 February 1914. At the outbreak of World War I Weston joined the South African forces taking part in the South West Africa Campaign (present day Namibia). He was responsible for providing and maintaining airfields.L\u2019Ange G. \"Urgent imperial service: South African Forces in German South West Africa 1914 \u2013 1915.\" Ashanti. Rivonia, South Africa. 1991. On 6 February 1915 he joined the South Africa Air Corps (SAAC) with the rank of lieutenant. South African Military History organisation website. It was not until 1 May 1915 that aircraft were available to South Africa's military forces and they were then found to be unserviceable. However, Weston was able to place beacons for pilots as far afield as Garub, now in Namibia. \"The S. A. Aviation Corps and their doings in S. W. Africa\" Flight. 3 December 1915. After German forces capitulated in South West Africa on 9 July 1915, Weston and his family travelled to England, arriving in Tilbury on 9 September 1915. On 1 July 1916, he was commissioned as a temporary sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, for duties with the RNAS. His first posting was to No. 3 Aeroplane Wing, Manston.The London Gazette. 4 July 1916. On 28 September 1916, he was promoted to temporary acting lieutenant.RNR Pay and Appointing Ledger. Fleet Air Arm Museum Archive Department and Research Centre. No. 3 (Naval) Wing] formed during the spring of 1916. Weston's group was one of the first departures to an airfield at Luxeuil-les-Bains, operating over a strategically important German manufacturing region. Weston's role included calibration of compasses and provision of marked maps to observers and airmen, intelligence work and retrieving downed airmen. He also negotiated reparations for local farmers and residents affected by his unit's operations, since he spoke French.Dodds R. V. \"Britain's first strategic bombing force: no. 3 naval wing.\" The Roundel, July \u2013 August 1963, Vol. 15, No. 6. From 28 July 1916, Weston also worked as a translator.\"No. 3 Wing R.N.A.S. 1916\u20131917 - Britain\u2019s first strategic bombers.\" Appendix O, part 1. Fleet Air Arm Museum Archive Department and Research Centre. On 2 April 1917, Weston was posted as a compass officer to No. 2 wing, RNAS, at Moudros on the Greek island of Lemnos in the Aegean Sea. Weston also managed aerodrome construction, drainage and roadmaking. This posting included a short time as an intelligence officer in Port Said in Egypt. It also included training of pilots, crew and engineers of the Hellenic naval air service.Thanos M. L. \"Weston J.\" South African National War Museum file. Weston was recorded as \"a thorough and efficient mapping officer, very energetic and hardworking...a very capable 'E' officer\". He remained in Moudros at least until 1918. Between 1919 and 1921, Weston made two trips to the United States of America on Air Ministry business. He left the service on 22 November 1923.The London Gazette. 4 December 1923 On the formation of the Royal Air Force from the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps on 1 April 1918, Weston was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the RAF. In August 1918, while he was seconded to the British Naval Mission to Greece as head of the technical section, he was promoted to \"Major whilst specially employed\u201d.The London Gazette, 2 August 1918 On 9 January 1919, Weston was promoted to Major in recognition of his distinguished service.\"Supplement to The London Gazette\". 1 January 1919 In July 1919, Weston was awarded the cross of Officer of the Order of the Redeemer.\"Flight\" 31 July 1919 and in 1923 he was promoted to Vice-Admiral in the Royal Hellenic Navy. Weston later named his South African property, \u201cAdmiralty Estate\u201d. ==Travel== ===\"Suid Afrika\"=== Weston had a love of travel and encouraged this in his children. While in the US, between 1919 and 1921, Weston purchased a Detroit-manufactured Commerce one tonne truck with a Continental N engine. The truck was shipped to England where Weston converted it into a motor home which could sleep five.\"Free staters see the world in a caravan.\" The Friend, Bloemfontein, 17 June 1928. Weston painted the vehicle yellow with black trim and called it \"Suid Afrika\".\"Weston Caravan.\" Winterton Museum, South Africa. The Suid Afrika was essentially a large wooden structure on the rear chassis of the truck. Windows were placed at the front of the living quarters and in the sides of the lantern roof.Rosenthal E. A. \"South African caravans around the globe.\" The Outspan, 3 October 1930. The vehicle could be hoisted upright onto a ship's deck. A sign on the side read, \"Our mansion: 7 by 14 feet, Our field: the world, Our family: mankind.\" and surrounding this, in a circle, \"Round the World.\" Weston and his family took a tour of 18 weeks in the Suid Afrika from England to Greece. The Westons lived in Athens for two years then in May 1924, returned in the Suid Afrika to England and from there to South Africa. In 1925, Weston made extensive travels through southern Africa. In 1926, the family attempted to return to England, overland. In 1927, Weston found the motor home was not suitable for the trip and returned to Cape Town. (The house in Brandfort was sold in April 1928.) The motor home remains on display as an exhibit of the Winterton Museum. ===\"Prairie Schooner\"=== The Prairie Schooner was a second motor home built by Weston. It had a removable living area with a canvas cover and was water-proofed for river crossings. In 1931 - 1932, Weston travelled from Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa, to Belgrade, Bulgaria (and to England and back).A. D. N. \"Across Africa and Europe by car: the Weston family expedition.\" Egyptian Gazette. 24 February 1932. Weston used the Prairie Schooner for the remainder of his life. In 1975, the Prairie Schooner featured in the International Veteran and Vintage Car Rally from Durban to Cape Town. It was later donated to the Winterton Museum, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, by Weston's son in law, Carl Rein Weston. ==Later life== On his return to South Africa in 1933, Weston bought a farm in the Bergville district, near the Sterkfontein dam. On 24 July 1950, Weston and his wife were injured in an attack. Weston died three days later at the age of 78. His wife survived. She lived with her eldest daughter, Anna, in the Transvaal, and died at age 91. ==See also== *Winterton Museum *Maximilian John Ludwick Weston ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1950 deaths Category:South African people of World War I Category:South African aviators Category:German South West Africa Category:Royal Naval Air Service aviators Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War I Category:Hellenic Navy admirals Category:Boer military personnel of the Second Boer War Category:Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society Category:Electrical engineers Category:German aviation record holders Category:Recipients of the Order of the Redeemer ",
