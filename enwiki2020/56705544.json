    "text": "Xiaoye Sherry Li is a researcher in numerical methods at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where she works as a senior scientist. She is responsible there for the SuperLU package, a high-performance parallel system for solving sparse systems of linear equations by using their LU decomposition. At the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, she heads the Scalable Solvers Group. ==Education== Li graduated from Tsinghua University in 1986, with a bachelor's degree in computer science. She moved to the United States for graduate study, earning a master's degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1990 and a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996. Her doctoral dissertation, Sparse Gaussian Elimination on High Performance Computers, was supervised by James Demmel. ==Recognition== In 2016, she was elected as a SIAM Fellow \"for advances in the development of fast and scalable sparse matrix algorithms and fostering their use in large-scale scientific and engineering applications\". ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Chinese mathematicians Category:Chinese computer scientists Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:American computer scientists Category:Chinese women computer scientists Category:Tsinghua University alumni Category:Pennsylvania State University alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
