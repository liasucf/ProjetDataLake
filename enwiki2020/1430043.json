    "text": "\"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\" is a short story by Alan Sillitoe, published in 1959 as part of a short story collection of the same name. The work focuses on Smith, a poor Nottingham teenager from a dismal home in a working class area, who has bleak prospects in life and few interests beyond petty crime. The boy turns to long-distance running as a method of both emotional and physical escape from his situation. The story was adapted for a 1962 film of the same title. A new adaption of the story is in development. ==Plot== When he is caught by the police for robbing a bakery, Smith is sentenced to be confined in Ruxton Towers in Essex, a borstal (young offenders institution) for delinquent youths. He seeks solace in long-distance running, attracting the notice of the school's authorities for his physical prowess. Smith is offered a light workload for his last six months at Ruxton Towers if he wins in an important cross-country competition against a prestigious public school. For Ruxton Towers to win the cross-country race would be a major public relations boost for the borstal administrators. However, when the day of the race arrives Smith throws victory away: after speeding ahead of the other runners he deliberately stops a few metres short of the finishing line, though well ahead and easily able to win. He lets the other runners pass him and cross the finishing line, thereby losing the race in a defiant gesture aimed against his Ruxton Towers administrators. In deliberately losing the race, Smith demonstrates his free spirit and independence. The response of the borstal authorities to Smith's action is heavy-handed: Smith resigns himself to the drudgery of manual labour he is returned to. However, looking back on his actions, he has no regrets. == Literary analysis == ===The \"runner\" as a metaphor=== Long-distance running gives the character an ability to freely escape from society without the pressures of a team, which may be found in other athletic stories. Additionally, Sillitoe gave running a political perspective that changed the vision of a literary runner. Sillitoe's character Smith uses running as a way to mentally reflect, allowing Smith to give clarity to his political insights and share them with the reader. Through running, Smith begins to understand and become aware of the class divisions in Britain. During the period that Sillitoe wrote \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" the idea of the runner was changing dramatically. Helen Small states, \"\u2026the weight of literary attention seems to be focused on a 'pre- professional era'\u2014either written at that time or looking back at it for inspiration\". === The 'angry young men' and Sillitoe === Alan Sillitoe is considered to be a member of the \"angry young men\" movement by critics and colleagues (though Sillitoe himself disliked the label). This term was associated with writers who created main characters that were \"belligerent and opinionated\", such as Smith. \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" suggests a revolution to combat class issues of the time. Smith says \"in the end the governor is going to be doomed while blokes like me will take the pickings of his roasted bones and dance like maniacs around his Borstal's ruins\". It is suggested that Sillitoe was never simply an \"angry young man\" but, through his deep hatred for the British class system, someone who would continue to be bitter despite youth. It was suggested at the time of the story's publication that Sillitoe created a character to express extreme views, but with the passage of time it has become clear that Sillitoe's and Smith's views were not very different. ==References in culture== ===Music=== *The British heavy metal group Iron Maiden adapted the short story into the song of the same name on their Somewhere in Time album. *British Oi! and punk band the Angelic Upstarts included a song of the same name on their Reason Why? album. *Scottish indie group Belle and Sebastian adapted the title for the song \"Loneliness of a Middle Distance Runner,\" a B-side on their 2001 single \"Jonathan David\" which also appears on the critically acclaimed compilation Push Barman to Open Old Wounds. *American band Ruxton Towers takes its name from the reformatory school in the film. *Grindcore band Agoraphobic Nosebleed parodied the title with \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Drug Runner\" from their album Agorapocalypse. *Leeds anarchist pop band Chumbawamba samples audio from the film heavily in the song Alright Now on the unreleased album Jesus H.
