Da'ud ash- Shirazi (c. 1000 CE/390 AH \u2013 1078 CE/470 AH) was an 11th-century Isma'ili scholar, philosopher-poet, preacher and theologian of Persian origin. He served the Fatimid Caliph-Im\u0101m al-Mustansir Billah as a Da'i in varying capacities, eventually attaining the highest rank of Bab al-Abwab \"The Gate of Gates\" and Da\u2018i al-Du\u2018at \"Chief Missionary\" in the Fatimid Da\u2018wah. In his theological and philosophical writings he brought the Isma'ili spiritual heritage to its pinnacle.VERENA KLEMM,\"MO\u02beAYYAD FI\u2019L-DIN \u0160IR\u0100ZI\" in Encyclopaedia Iranica ==Life== Al-Mu'ayyad was born in Shiraz not later than 387/997 and died in Cairo Shawwal in 470 AH/1078 AD. He lived during the time of the Fatimid Caliphs Al-Hakim (386\u2013412 AH / 996\u20131021 AD), Al-Zahir (412\u2013427 AH / 1021\u20131036 AD) and Al-Mustansir (427\u201348AH / 1036\u20131094AD). He was buried in the Dar al-ilm where he had resided, worked and died.12.0 The Fatimid Da'i Al- Mu'ayyad: His Life, by Dr. Abbas Hamdani, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (U.S.A.) Al-Muayyad's real name was Hibatullah ibn Musa, born in the town of Shiraz, capital of the Fars Province (then Persia, now in modern-day Iran), in the year 1000 CE. His father, Musa ibn Dawud, served under the Fatimid Caliph- Imam al-Hakim bi Amr Allah as the Chief Missionary of the province of Fars, where the Isma'ili mission was active. Al-Muayyad was \"contemporary with the changeover from the Buyid to the Saljuq Sultanate under the Abbasid Caliphate, as well as the Arab bedouin Hilalian invasion of North Africa, the Fatimiid encouraged invasion of Baghdad by al-Basasiri, the Battle of Manzikert in Anatolia, the rise of the Sulayhids of Yaman and the advent of the Armnenian General Badr al-Jamali in Egypt\". During the reign of the Fatimid Caliph-Imam al-Zahir li-i'zaz Din Allah, Hibatullah ibn Musa was permitted to take over the da'wah office from his father. His title, Al-Mu'ayyad fi d-Din ('The one aided in religion') was probably accorded to him around this time. Al-Mu'ayyad was appointed to the Diwan al-insha' (secretariat) in 440 AH / 1048 AD on a monthly salary of 1000 dinars and wrote the religious sermons (al-Majalis) for al-Yazuri (as-Sira 89\u201390). Al-Mu'ayyad gives us an interesting information about the presence of a Buyid Prince Abu 'Ali in the Fatimid Court (as-Siras 87).12.0 The Fatimid Da'i Al-Mu'ayyad: His Life by: Dr. Abbas Hamdani, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (U.S.A.) Al-Muayyad (Hibatullah) gradually worked his way up the hierarchy of the da\u2018wa and was eventually appointed Chief Missionary under the Caliph-Imam al-Mustansir Billah. He was appointed the head of the Academy of Science (Dar al-'Iim, originally been founded by the Caliph al-Hakim in Cairo), which was also the headquarters of the Da'wa and became the residence of al-Mu'ayyad.. He directed the Da'wa affairs throughout the Fatimid sphere of influence particularly Persia, Yaman, Bahrayn and Northern and Western India ('Uyun - ms. - fols. 59-63, 65). In this position, he worked teaching missionaries from both inside and outside the Fatimid Empire and composing his theological works until the end of his life in 1078 CE. He founded the dynamic tradition of Fatimid da\u02bfwa ('religious mission') poetry that flourished after him for a thousand years through the succeeding Taiyabi da\u02bfwa and continues to thrive today. His poetry uses a unique form of esoteric t\u0101w\u012bl-based religious symbolism \u2013 metaphor, in fact, as manifestation, where what appears to be metaphor is the theological reality of the Imam. Al-Mu\u02bcayyad Al-Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b and Fatimid Da\u02bbwa Poetry: A Case of Commitment in Classical Arabic Literature; By: Tahera Qutbuddin; Brill, 2005 The primary source for details of Al-Mu'ayyad's life are his own memoirs, the Sirat al-Mu'ayyad fi d-Din, which was written in three stages between the years 1051 and 1063 CE. He is also mentioned in the works of Nasir Khusraw, another prominent Isma'ili scholar of the time, who had learned under al- Mu'ayyad. In a poem written in 455/1063 (Diwan, 173\u2013177) Nasir praises al-Mua- yyad as his master (teacher) and refers to him as the \"Warden of the Gate\" ('Bab'). There are other direct references in Nasir's Diwan (313\u2013314). Al- Mu'ayyad also taught Hassan-i Sabbah. ==Works== *Majalis ul-Muayyadiyah, written between 450 AH to 470 AH.

Since time is measured and delimited by the movement of celestial spheres and the rising and setting of the sun, it is impossible for time to have been measured before creation occurred. He argues that if creation had yet to occur, and God still had to create the sun, the earth, and the planets, how could these verses about a six-day creation refer to the passage of time? Al-Mu'ayyad also explains how the Qur\u2019anic verse describing the creation of the heavens and the earth taking God six days to complete, with each day spanning a thousand years, is also symbolic. The Creator with infinite power is not limited by time, in His creation. ==See also== * Ismailism * Nasir Khusraw al-Qubadiani * Imamah (Ismaili doctrine) * Imamah (Nizari Ismaili doctrine) * Nizari Ismailis ==References== ==Literature== * * ==External links== *MO\u02beAYYAD FI\u2019L-DIN \u0160IR\u0100ZI in Encyclopaedia Iranica * *Bab al-Abwab *The Institute of Ismaili Studies - Memoirs of a Mission: The Ismaili Scholar, Statesman and Poet, al-Mu\u2019ayyad fi\u2019l-Din al-Shirazi *A Short sketch of the Life of Syedna Al-Muayyad-Fid-Din Al-Shirazi, Head Missionary of the Ismaili Sect *Al Muayyad fid din al Shirazi Article at Amaana.org *Life and Lectures of Al Muayyad fid-din al Shirazi Majalis-ul Muayyadiya - by Al Muayyad fid-din Shirazi *Ismaili Web Poetry Page 1 - Al Muayyad fid-din Shirazi *Al Muayyad's protege Nasir Khusraw Category:1000s births Category:1078 deaths Category:11th-century people of the Fatimid Caliphate Category:11th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Muslim theologians Category:Islamic philosophers Category:Persian philosophers Category:Iranian Ismailis Category:11th-century Iranian people Category:People from Shiraz Category:11th-century philosophers Category:Medieval Persian philosophers Category:Chief missionaries of the Fatimid Caliphate ",
