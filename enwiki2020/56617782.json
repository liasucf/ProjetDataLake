Mercadal was considered an unlucky footballer who was set back by a couple severe injuries. ==Managerial career== Mercadal begun coaching professionally with Tours FC in the French Ligue 2 in 2016. After a series of unfortunate results he was let go, and spent 4 months waiting for his next opportunity. He joined Paris FC in the summer of 2017. Mercadal is a passionate coach, known for his extravagant praise. A self-admitted sore loser, Mercadal vomited after losses early in his career. On 8 June 2018, Mercadal was announced as the manager of Ligue 1 side Stade Malherbe Caen. On 25 May 2019, Mercadal was left the club by mutual consent, following the 0\u20131 defeat against Bordeaux and the relegation to Ligue 2. During 38 Ligue 1 games as the head coach of Stade Malherbe, Mercadal had 7 victories, 12 draws and 19 losses. At the end of the season Stade Malherbe had 33 points which was the lowest number of points the club ever had in Ligue 1. After being sacked by Stade Malherbe de Caen, Mercadal becomes the head coach of Cercle Bruge. However he is once again sacked after losing 10 games out of 11, leaving the team at the bottom of the league. On 16 May 2020, Mercadal was appointed as manager of USL Dunkerque, newly promoted to Ligue 2. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Team ! rowspan=\"2\" |Nat ! rowspan=\"2\" |From ! rowspan=\"2\"|To ! colspan=\"8\" |Record |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | Gap | | 1 July 2005 | 1 July 2008 |- |Dunkerque | | 3 June 2012 | 7 June 2016 |- |Tours | |13 June 2016 |18 February 2017 |- | Paris FC | |21 June 2017 |2 June 2018 |- |Caen | |8 June 2018 |25 May 2019 |- |Cercle Brugge | |19 June 2019 |7 October 2019 |- |Dunkerque | |16 May 2020 |Present |- !colspan=\"4\"|Total |} ==References== ==External links== *Paris FC Profile Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Manosque Category:French footballers Category:French football managers Category:French people of Corsican descent Category:Association football defenders Category:Championnat National players Category:Gap FC players Category:Ligue 1 managers Category:Ligue 2 managers Category:Stade Malherbe Caen managers Category:Paris FC managers Category:Tours FC managers Category:Cercle Brugge K.S.V. managers Category:Sportspeople from Alpes-de-Haute-Provence ",
