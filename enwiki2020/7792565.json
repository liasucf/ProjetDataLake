    "text": "Tiswadi is a sub-district of North Goa district in the state of Goa, India. The word Tiswadi itself means thirty settlements. It refers to the thirty settlements in which the Goud Saraswat Brahmins settled when they migrated to Goa. It is geographically an Island with the Mandovi River forming its northern boundary. The sub-district of Tiswadi includes the smaller islands of Chor\u00e3o, Divar, St Estevam, Cumbarjua and Vanxim. The present capital of Goa, Panaji, lies on this island. Tiswadi is also where the city of Old Goa, a World Heritage Site, was established. ==History== Tiswadi along with the rest of Goa regularly exchanged hands between the Muslim Bhahmani Sultanate and the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire of South India prior to the 14th Century. By the 15th century the Bijapur Sultanate under the Adil Shahi dynasty conquered Goa and it came under Muslim rule. The City of Goa was the regional capital of the Sultanates as well as a hub for the Hajj pilgrimage. Numerous temples were demolished under the rule of the sultanates. The Adil Shahi dynasty was defeated by a Portuguese-Vijayanagar alliance, and Ilhas de Goa was conquered under Afonso de Albuquerque in 1510. By the time Tiswadi was relived from Muslim rule, Hindus formed a minority in the region, and the Portuguese started conversion efforts against the Muslim majority. The populace was made to accept Christianity or leave the Islands. There was a mass exodus of natives who left the Islands, for the safer havens of Ponda and the Canara, Malabar Coast, Chandgad and Joida. The first temple to be built in Panjim was in the mid 1700s, when the Portuguese authorities granted permission to the Hindus to build their place of worship. The evangelization of Tiswadi was spearheaded by the Dominicans, who were assigned 15 villages, and the Jesuits, who were assigned the remaining part along with the smaller islands of Chor\u00e3o and Divar, by the Portuguese authorities. In 1552, the island of Chor\u00e3o had a population of 300 Christians out of 3,000 and, by this time, also had a small church which was visited by a Jesuit from St. Paul's every Sunday. By the end of 1559, over 1,200 had accepted baptism. The following year, the first bishop from the Jesuit order, Dom Jo\u00e3o Nunes de Barreto, set up residence in Chor\u00e3o, which eventually became a Noviciate. Most of Chor\u00e3o's population converted en masse to Roman Catholicism in mid-1560.Sarasvati's Children: A History of the Mangalorean Christians, Alan Machado Prabhu, I.J.A. Publications, 1999, pp. 100 \u2013 101 By January 1563, the Jesuit provincial claimed that Ilhas de Goa had been completely Christianized, with a population of 70,000, the great majority of which had converted in the last six years, corresponding to the terms of Viceroys Francisco Barreto and Constantino of Braganza, whose -year term saw between 25,000 and 30,000 conversions. ==Highlights== Panjim, Velha Goa and its monuments, Divar, Chor\u00e3o == Settlements == === Cities === {|class=\"wikitable\" !# !City !State !Population |- |1 |Panjim Municipal Corporation |Goa |40000 |} === Towns === {|class=\"wikitable\" !# !Town !State !Population |- |1 |Chimbel Census Town |Goa |15,289 |- |2 |Calapor or Santa Cruz, Goa Census Town |Goa |14,077 |- |3 |Murda, Census Town |Goa |7,517 |- |4 |Bambolim Census Town |Goa |6,885 |- |5 |Corlim Census Town |Goa |6,568 |- |6 |Mercurim Census Town |Goa |4,970 |- |7 |Cumbarjua Census Town |Goa |4,917 |- |8 |Goa Velha Census Town |Goa |4,322 |- |9 |Jua Census Town |Goa |4,134 |- |10 |Old Goa (Velha Goa) Census Town |Goa |2,550 |- |11 |Ribandar Census Town |Goa |2,450 |- |12 |Tiswadi Census Town |Goa |2,300 |} === Villages === {|class=\"wikitable\" !# !Villages !Administrative Division !Population |- |1 |Ambarim |Tiswadi |93 |- |2 |Azossim |Tiswadi |1,142 |- |3 |Bainguinim |Tiswadi |1,501 |- |4 |Batim |Tiswadi |1,489 |- |5 |Cap\u00e3o |Tiswadi |135 |- |6 |Caraim |Tiswadi |202 |- |7 |Carambolim |Tiswadi |5,179 |- |8 |Chor\u00e3o |Tiswadi |5,268 |- |9 |Curca |Tiswadi |2,518 |- |10 |Ella |Tiswadi |5,372 |- |11 |Gancim |Tiswadi |519 |- |12 |Gandaulim |Tiswadi |301 |- |13 |Goalim Moula |Tiswadi |441 |- |14 |Goltim |Tiswadi |1,634 |- |15 |Malar |Tiswadi |1,630 |- |16 |Mandur |Tiswadi |3,113 |- |17 |Naroa |Tiswadi |487 |- |18 |Navelim |Tiswadi |1,133 |- |19 |Neura-O-Grande |Tiswadi |1,440 |- |20 |Neura-O-Pequeno |Tiswadi |563 |- |21 |Sirid\u00e3o |Tiswadi |2,417 |- |22 |Talaulim |Tiswadi |972 |} ==See also== *Konkani people *History of Goa *Salcette *Bardez *Goan Catholics ==References== Category:Islands of the Indian Ocean Category:Islands of Goa Category:Taluks of Goa Category:Geography of North Goa district Category:Tourist attractions in North Goa district ",
