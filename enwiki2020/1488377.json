The satellite was developed by NPO Mashinostroyeniya. The aim of the project was to study high and ultra-high energy particles. The latest became Proton 4 (NORAD ID: 3544, NSSDC ID: 1968-103A) launched on November 16, 1968 by Proton-K rocket with a booster and was in orbit for 250 days.Proton 4 at NASA NSSDC Master Catalog The Proton satellites were the source of the name for the Proton (rocket family), which launched them as some of its first payloads. == Photos == Image:Proton satellite model.jpg|Proton satellite model at Tsiolkovsky State Museum, two solar panels dismantled to fit the hall Image:Proton satellite model closeup.jpg|Proton satellite model (closeup) ==References== == External links == * The history of \"NPO Mashinostroyenia\" * The INCA Project, Ionization-Neutron CAlorimeter - a modern continuation of Proton experiment project at Institute for Nuclear Research of Russian Academy of Sciences website Category:Earth observation satellites of the Soviet Union ",
