The firm's exact dates are unclear, but many art historians date its activity to between c. 1751 and 1860.Pushkin State Museum; Japanese PrintsNewland is less precise, describing Nishimuraya as active from the \"mid-eighteenth to mid-nineteenth century (2003, 475); Machotka chooses the period c. 1789\u20131830 (2009, 64), and Volker insists on 1738-1818 (1949, 20). According to Andreas Marks, Nishimuraya's \"success came from engaging the best artists and providing a broad range of prints to satisfy the public's interest.\"Japanese Prints One of the press' most significant products was Hokusai's Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, which appeared between c. 1830 and 1833.Newland 2003, 206 In addition to Hokusai, Nishimuraya Yohachi published prints by Eishi, Kuniyasu, Toyokuni I and Kunisada.Japanese Prints The store is immortalized in the 1787 print Scene of Print Buyers at the Shop of Nishimuraya Yohachi (Eijudou) on New Year\u2019s Day by Torii Kiyonaga (1752\u20131815).Part of the Gerhard Pulverer Collection currently housed at the Smithsonian's Freer Gallery. The seal used by the Yohachi shop for the release of Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji Yohachi is known to have been a member of the Fuji-k\u014d, an Edo period cult centred around Mount Fuji.Honolulu Museum Founded by an ascetic named Hasegawa Kakugy\u014d (1541\u20131646),Melton 2008, 231 the cult venerated the mountain as a female deity, and encouraged its members to climb it.Yamaguchi In doing so, they would be reborn, \"purified and... able to find happiness.\"Yamaguchi The cult waned in the Meiji period, and, though it persists to this day, it has been subsumed into Shint\u014d sects.Melton 2008, 231 The publisher's association with the Fuji-k\u014d gives clues not only to imagery in his portrait by Utagawa Toyokuni I, but also to his eagerness to participate in the production of Hokusai's series celebrating Mount Fuji. ==References== ==Sources== * Machotka, Ewa.
