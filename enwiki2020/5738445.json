    "text": "Mao in Yen'an. The Marshall Mission (; 20 December 1945 \u2013 January 1947) was a failed diplomatic mission undertaken by United States Army General George C. Marshall to China in an attempt to negotiate between the Communist Party of China and the Nationalists (Kuomintang) to create a unified Chinese government. ==Historical background== Committee of Three, from left, Nationalist representative Zhang Qun, George C. Marshall and Communist representative Zhou Enlai. Throughout the length of the Second Sino-Japanese War an uneasy stalemate had existed between the Chinese Communists (CCP) and the Chinese Nationalists (KMT), while prior to the war, both parties had been in open conflict with each other. During this period numerous US military personnel and private writers visited and reported on the Communist Part of China. In 1936, international journalist Edgar Snow traveled and interviewed leading members of the Communist Party of China. Snow reported that Mao was a reformer rather than a radical revolutionary,Brady p. 47. and many readers got the impression that the Chinese communists were \"agrarian reformers.\"Kenneth E. Shewmaker, \"The \"Agrarian Reformer\" Myth,\" The China Quarterly 34 (1968): 66-81. In the 1944 Dixie Mission, US Colonel John Service visited the Communists and praised them, claimed that they were democratic reformers, likening them to European socialists rather than Soviet Communists and claimed that they were less corrupt and chaotic than the Nationalists.John Service, Report No. 5, 8 March 1944, to Commanding General Fwd.

Norton & Co., 2018. http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294994542 US Ambassador to China Clarence Gauss recommended the United States \"pull up the plug and let the whole Chinese Government go down the drain\". General Patrick Hurley claimed that the Chinese Communists were not real communists. China Burma India Theater Commander Joseph Stilwell repeatedly claimed (in contradiction to Comintern statistics) that Communists were doing more than the KMT, and sought to cut off all US aid to China.Wesley Marvin Bagby, The Eagle-Dragon Alliance: America's Relations with China in World War II, p.96 American attempts during the Second World War to end the intermittent Chinese Civil War between the two factions had failed, notably the Hurley Mission: in 1944 General Patrick Hurley approached both groups, and believed that their differences were comparable to the Republicans and Democrats in the United States.Russel D. Buhite, Patrick J. Hurley and American Foreign Policy (Ithaca, NY: Cornell U Press, 1973), 160 \u2013 162. Throughout the war, both the CCP and the KMT had accused the other of withholding men and arms against the Japanese in preparation for offensive actions against the other. Thus, in a desperate attempt to keep the country whole, President Harry S Truman in late 1945 sent General George Marshall as his special presidential envoy to China to negotiate a unity government. ==Marshall arrives in China== Marshall arrived in China on 20 December 1945. His goal was to unify the Nationalists and Communists with the hope that a strong, non-Communist China, would act as a bulwark against the encroachment of the Soviet Union. Immediately, Marshall drew both sides into negotiations which would occur for more than a year. No significant agreements were reached, as both sides used the time to further prepare themselves for the ensuing conflict. In order to assist in brokering a ceasefire between the Nationalists and Communists, the sale of weapons and ammunition by the US to the Nationalists were suspended between 29 July 1946 to May 1947. Finally, in January 1947, exasperated with the failure of the negotiations, Marshall left China. Soon afterward, Marshall was appointed United States Secretary of State (foreign affairs secretary). ==Aftermath== The failure of the Marshall Mission signaled the renewal of the Chinese Civil War. George Marshall returned to the United States, became United States Secretary of State, and committed himself to the revitalization of Europe with the Marshall Plan, which was, to some considered a great success. However, primarily due to the policies of the Democratic regime of President Roosevelt, a similar scenario had already played out in Europe that will play out in Asia. The Marshall Plan did not involve countries like Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia because all had been permitted by Roosevelt and Truman to be, or eventually be, engulfed by the USSR. This is not including attempts by the USSR to engulf Greece, Italy and parts of Denmark and Norway or their attempts in Turkey and their success in setting up what amounted to a puppet regime in Finland.A map of the world by 1973 By 1949, the Kuomintang was driven from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan and the Communists established the People's Republic of China. ==Attack by McCarthy== On 9 June 1951, Douglas MacArthur charged that the post-war Marshall mission to China committed \"one of the greatest blunders in American diplomatic history, for which the free world is now paying in blood and disaster....\" in a telegram to Senator William F. Knowland. On 14 June 1951, as the Korean War stalemated in heavy fighting between American and Chinese forces, Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy attacked. He stated that Marshall was directly responsible for the \"loss of China,\" as China turned from friend to enemy.The speech was published as a 169-page book, America's Retreat from Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall (1951). McCarthy said the only way to explain why the US \"fell from our position as the most powerful Nation on earth at the end of World War II to a position of declared weakness by our leadership\" was because of \"a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man.\"Joseph McCarthy, Major Speeches and Debates (1951) p. 215 McCarthy argued that General Albert Coady Wedemeyer had prepared a wise plan that would keep China a valued ally but that it had been sabotaged; \"only in treason can we find why evil genius thwarted and frustrated it.\" McCarthy, Major Speeches and Debates (1951) pp. 264. Specifically, McCarthy alleged: > \"When Marshall was sent to China with secret State Department orders, the > Communists at that time were bottled up in two areas and were fighting a > losing battle, but that because of those orders the situation was radically > changed in favor of the Communists. Under those orders, as we know, Marshall > embargoed all arms and ammunition to our allies in China. He forced the > opening of the Nationalist-held Kalgan Mountain pass into Manchuria, to the > end that the Chinese Communists gained access to the mountains of captured > Japanese equipment. No need to tell the country about how Marshall tried to > force Chiang Kai-shek to form a partnership government with the > Communists.\"McCarthy, Major Speeches p. 191, from speech of March 14, 1951; > see also Thomas C. Reeves, The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy (1982) pp > 371-74. Public opinion on Marshall's record became bitterly divided along party lines. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower, while campaigning successfully for US President, denounced the Truman administration's failures in Korea, campaigned alongside McCarthy, and refused to defend Marshall's policies.Reeves, McCarthy 437-8 ==See also== * China White Paper, U.S. State Department defense of its actions issued in 1949 * Dixie Mission * China Burma India Theater, against Japan * Red Star Over China * Wartime perception of the Chinese Communists ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Brazinsky, Gregg. \"The Birth of a Rivalry: Sino\u2010American Relations during the Truman Administration\" in Daniel S.
