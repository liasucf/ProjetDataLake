    "text": "AT-121 is an experimental analgesic. It was designed to be bifunctional, acting as an agonist at both the \u03bc-opioid receptor and the nociceptin receptor. The interaction with the nociceptin receptor is expected to block the abuse and dependence-related side effects that are typical of opioids. A study in nonhuman primates found that AT-121 has morphine-like analgesic effects, but suppressed the addictive effects. == See also == * AT-076 * Cebranopadol * Oliceridine * PZM21 == References == Category:Mu-opioid agonists Category:Nociceptin receptor agonists Category:Sulfamides Category:Piperidines Category:Experimental drugs ",
