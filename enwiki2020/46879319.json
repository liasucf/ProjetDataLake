It was released in 2002 by record label Festival Mushroom in Australia, V2 in the US and Sony in the UK. It contains Puretone's 1998 top-20 single \"Addicted to Bass\" and features collaborations with Amiel Daemion, Dan the Automator and Paul Mac. The album includes a number of tracks from Abraham's 1998 album, Sweet Distorted Holiday. == Content == Billboard described the album as \"musically diverse [...] revelling in drum and bass, techno, chilled out ambience, and left-of-center pop\". == Reception == Richard M. Juzwiak of CMJ New Music Monthly wrote: \"Groove excites because it sprawls, not only over the course of the tracks, but within them, suggesting that Abrahams is anything but stuck.\" == Track listing == == References == == External links == * Category:2002 albums Category:Josh Abrahams albums ",
