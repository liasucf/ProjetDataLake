The battle was part of the civil war that was taking place in Iceland at the time between various powerful clans during the time known as the Age of the Sturlungs. The Battle of \u00d6rlygssta\u00f0ir was fought on 21 August 1238 between Sighvatur Sturluson (brother of Snorri Sturluson) and his son Sturla Sighvatsson on the one hand, and Kolbeinn ungi and Gissur \u00deorvaldsson (later Earl Gissur) on the other. Sighvatur had nearly 500 men but there is no evidence available of the size of Sturla's following. Nonetheless, historians estimate that the Sturlungar had a total of 1000 men. Gissur and Kolbeinn had almost 1700 men in total. The areas controlled by the Sturlungar were more populous but the settlements were more scattered which made it difficult for the Sturlungar to assemble fighting men. The \u00c1sbirningar and Haukd\u00e6lir clans emerged victorious after a short battle. Over 50 men were killed on that day, including Sighvatur and Sturla. According to the Saga of the Icelanders, Gissur only lost seven men whereas Kolbeinn lost none. Five others, including \u00de\u00f3rir J\u00f6kull Steinfinnsson, were executed by beheading following the battle. The names of those who perished on that day are recorded in the \u00cdslendinga saga which is included as a part of the Sturlunga saga. In 1988 a memorial was raised on the site of the battle, which describes the battle. == References == ==Other sources== * J\u00f3n J\u00f3hannesson, Magn\u00fas Finnbogason and Kristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn (eds.)
