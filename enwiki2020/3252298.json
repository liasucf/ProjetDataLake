It ran from 1 April 1978 to 27 January 1979 and consisted of 44 episodes. The name Daimos is derived from Deimos, one of the two moons of Mars. Tadao Nagahama, who directed the series, is often miscredited as the \"creator\" of the trilogy. It was actually created under the collective pseudonym Saburo Yatsude.

The first appearance of Daimos in the United States was in the late 1970s as a part of Mattel's Shogun Warriors line of imported Super Robot toys, and in the early 1980s, 3B Productions strung the pivotal episodes of the show together to form a compilation movie under the title Starbirds. ==Story== After the destruction of their home world, the survivors of the planet Baam head towards Earth with the goal of negotiating the purchase of land for emigration. Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Baam-seijin leader is assassinated by his second in command and the delegation from Earth is framed for the murder. In the ensuing chaos, Doctor Isamu Ry\u016bzaki of the Earth delegation is shot and killed. Shortly after the disastrous end of the talks, the Baam-seijin begin a campaign of terror against Earth. The only thing standing between the Earthlings and annihilation is the transforming, karate-using super robot, Daimos and its pilot, Kazuya Ry\u016bzaki. But that changes when he meets and falls in love with a mysterious girl named Erika, who turns out to be the daughter of the deceased Baam-seijin leader.

Popy released a diecast toy of Daimos during the series' run in 1978. Like its anime counterpart, the toy could transform from robot to Tranzer mode. Aside from its array of weapons, the toy came with two mini replicas of Kazuya's Tryper 75S car. The toy was imported into North America by Bandai as part of the Godaikin line in the 1980s. Popy also released a Jumbo Machinder version of Daimos, which was imported into the U.S. by Mattel as part of their Shogun Warriors line. In 2008, Bandai released a newer, smaller Daimos toy as part of their Soul of Chogokin line. This toy is more anime-accurate and more poseable than its Popy diecast predecessor. Unlike the original Popy toy, this toy has a more complex transformation in order to remain faithful to its anime design. In addition to its weapons and two miniature Tryper 75S cars, the toy comes with a larger-sized Tryper car that features an opening cockpit, movable wings and a Kazuya driver figure. A miniature replica of the Galva FX II plane is also included in the package. ==See also== *Super Robot - Suffer Reboot, a series of sculptures made by Filipino artist Toym Leon Imao depicting a mixture of Japanese mecha animated series and the injustices perpetrated during the 1970s martial law in the Philippines, with one of the sculptures, The Fright to Fight or Flight with Freights of Plights, based on T\u014dsh\u014d Daimos. ==References== ==External links== * * information on Daimos * information on Daimos contains images, names and descriptions for nearly all characters and robots.
