Xmi focuses on introducing the newest wave of multimedia products to the global market, starting with an objective of creating the smallest portable speaker with the highest quality sound possible. Xmi is more commonly known as X-mini\u2122 which is the brand name of its products. The main products that the company offers are compact and portable capsule speakers that have in-built rechargeable batteries which work mainly with smartphones, tablets and other smart devices. The newer capsule speakers produced by Xmi includes Bluetooth capabilities which allows wireless connection with smart devices. Xmi managed to break-even on all first year expenses within three months of launching of its first X-mini\u2122 Capsule Speakers. As of 2012, Xmi has sold close to three million units of the X-mini\u2122 Capsule Speakers. ==Products== Xmi introduced their first X-mini\u2122 speakers in 2007. The first batch of speakers had the Bass Xpansion System (BXS) which allows the speakers to compress for portability and expand to produce fuller sound. The X-mini\u2122 speakers had built-in rechargeable batteries to provide a direct energy source for the speakers. In 2009, Xmi launched the second generation speakers with a new function called \"buddyjack\" which enables users to connect multiple capsule speakers to a single source of music. In 2011, Xmi invested approximately $1million in a manufacturing plant in Shenzhen, China to help produce components and research for new ideas and improvements for its X-mini\u2122 products. The plant employs about 180 engineers and assembly workers. Till date, Xmi's product lines encompass largely different models of capsule speakers produced by the company such as X-mini\u2122 KAI, X-mini\u2122 MAX, X-mini\u2122 RAVE and X-mini\u2122 HAPPY. X-mini\u2122 HAPPY has a built-in MP3 player and a SD card reader which allows it to function like a flash drive when connected through USB. Xmi's products also include audio systems such as X-mini\u2122 CLEAR and also portable smartphone speakers such as X-mini\u2122 ME and X-mini\u2122 WE. According to Lee, Xmi is currently looking to diversify its product lines, moving to slightly larger speakers and looking at incorporating Wi-Fi functions into its speakers. ==Overseas Market== Xmi currently sells in over 80 countries across regions like Asia Pacific, Australia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and North America. In 2014, international sales of Xmi's products account for 95% of its total revenue. Since Xmi was established, it had taken a proactive stance on selling on the global market so as to have a larger consumer population. Lee understood that Xmi has to produce in large quantities to survive as a business. Xmi USA was officially incorporated in Los Angeles, California on 27 April 2012 which will serve the markets in North America and South America. After Xmi USA's incorporation, Xmi has managed to double its revenue in 2012. ==Awards== Over the years, Xmi's range of Capsule Speakers had various awards under its name for its innovation and design in particular the red dot design award with Xmi having won the award for five times. X-mini\u2122 speakers have also received award commendations from many major industry reviewer such as CNET, HardwareZone, PC Magazine, Stuff and T3. In addition, Xmi has also won business awards that recognize companies for entrepreneurship and brand development. In 2008, Lee was nominated as one of Asia's top young entrepreneurs by BusinessWeek. === 2016 === * DISTREE EMEA 2016 Diamond Award - X-mini\u2122 EVOLVE Headphone Speaker === 2014 === * Red Dot Design Award \u2013 X-mini\u2122 WE Thumb Size Speaker\u2122 * Airline Retail Conference Award For Best New Product \u2013 X-mini\u2122 WE Thumb Size Speaker\u2122 === 2013 === * Travel + Leisure Awards \u2013 X-mini\u2122 KAI Capsule Speaker\u2122 === 2012 === * Red Dot Design Award (X-mini\u2122 KAI Capsule Speaker\u2122) === 2011 === * Red Dot Design Award (X-mini\u2122 RAVE Capsule Speaker\u2122) * iF Design Award (X-mini\u2122 KAI Capsule Speaker\u2122) === 2010 === * Universal Design Award (X-mini\u2122 II Capsule Speaker\u2122 and X-mini\u2122 MAX II Capsule Speaker\u2122) * Red Dot Design Award (X-mini\u2122 HAPPY Capsule Speaker\u2122) * CNet Editor's Choice Award (X-mini\u2122 HAPPY Capsule Speaker\u2122) * Design For Asia Award * APEA Most Promising Entrepreneur Award === 2009 === * The Business Times Emerging Enterprises Award * SiTF Start-up Category Award * JCI The Outstanding Young Persons (TOYP) Merit Award * Hardware Magazine Gold Award * Singapore Prestige Brand Award * Asia Pacific ICT Start-up Category Award === 2008 === * Red Dot Design Award (X-mini\u2122 Capsule Speaker\u2122) * Red Dot Design Award (X-mini\u2122 MAX Capsule Speaker\u2122) * Infocomm Singapore Awards * T3 UK Gold Award * Hardware Magazine Silver Award * Malaysia CHIP Recommended Award ==Corporate Social Responsibility== Xmi had donated 10 percent of the profits from the sale of the X-mini\u2122 HAPPY Capsule Speaker model to the Children International to provide children in developing countries basic necessities such as food, education and healthcare.
