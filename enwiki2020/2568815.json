Founded as Farum Boldklub from the merger of the town's two football clubs Farum IK and Stavnsholt BK in 1991, the club changed its name to FC Nordsj\u00e6lland in 2003. FCN plays in the Danish Superliga, winning its first medal in the 2002\u201303 season, taking third place. Since then, the Wild Tigers have made four appearances in Europe under both the old UEFA Cup format in 2003\u201304, 2008\u201309 and in the UEFA Europa League during the 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312 seasons. In 2010, the club won its first Danish Cup and successfully defended it the following year in 2011, beating Midtjylland in both finals. FCN won the 2011\u201312 Danish Superliga in May 2012 which qualified the team to participate in the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League. Nordsj\u00e6lland plays its home matches at Right to Dream Park, which has a capacity of 10,100 of which 9,800 seating and 300 standing spectators. ==History== ===Farum BK (1991\u20132003)=== alt=refer to captionEstablished on 1 January 1991, from the merger of two football clubs, Farum Idr\u00e6ts Klub (formed in 1910) and Stavnsholt Boldklub af 1974, both from the then Farum municipality (now consolidated with V\u00e6rl\u00f8se as the Fures\u00f8 municipality), Farum BK would become one of the few merger success stories in Danish football, but not without controversy. The club was an initiative local Farum residence and of then local mayor Peter Brixtofte, whom took a personal interest in the club, as well as garnered sponsorship for the team. The club kit colours became a combination of the two merged clubs, the red and white of Stavnsholt with the yellow and blue of F.I.K. combined into a kit with yellow and red striped shirts and dark blue shorts and socks, which is still used in some form to this day. Colours were not the only thing the newly formed club inherited, as Thomas Andreasen who had been with Stavnsholt BK was carried over into the new Farum squad, Andreasen would go on to make a record 295 appearances, playing from the Denmark Series all the way to the Danish Superliga, until his departure from the club in 2007. Farum BK was placed in the second group of the Denmark Series, the fourth tier in the Danish football pyramid, though it gained promotion to the first group after the club's maiden season. J\u00f8rgen Andersen, a former goalkeeper for Hvidovre, took over as the club's first head coach in 1992; the club stayed in the Denmark Series first group for six years. Under the guidance of manager J\u00f8rgen Tideman, who took over in 1994, Farum qualified for promotion into the 2nd Division in the 1997\u201398 season and subsequently turned professional for the first time in club history. Farum's first full season as a professional club was a fruitful one, edging out Aalborg Chang and Skive to fifth place by one point, gaining promotion for the second time in two years into the 1st Division. The club's meteoric rise was slowed at first with the new challenge of playing in the Danish second tier, though it was not stopped however, ending the 1999\u20132000 campaign with a respectable eighth-place finish, winning the same number of games as it lost. Farum, however, remained unable to make any sort of impact in the Danish Cup, having lost in the first round for the last three years since making its debut in the tournament in the 1997\u201398 season. The following year saw some progression in both the league and cup, improving on the previous year's finish by finishing fifth, three spots and nine points behind second-placed promotion winners Vejle, as well as breaking out of the first round of the Danish Cup to eventually fall to Fremad Amager in the third round following a 2\u20131 loss. With the 2001\u201302 season, unconventional coach Christian Andersen was brought in to manage the team, building on the gradual footholds the club had been making in the 1st Division. Jeppe Tengbjerg played a pivotal role, brought in from B.93 the previous year; he scored 16 goals, becoming Farum's top goalscorer of the season and third overall in the league. The team went on to earn promotion into the Superliga after finishing in second place, 11 points clear of third-placed S\u00f8nderjylland, one point behind first-place winners K\u00f8ge, scoring a team total of 69 goals, the highest that season and losing only four games. Farum's 2002\u201303 appearance in the top flight of Danish football would be its first and last under the Farum BK name. it ended the season in third place, thus qualifying for the UEFA Cup for the first time in its history. The club's achievement, however, was overshadowed by the controversy involving Peter Brixtofte, who had helped form and fund the club, with deals involving his municipality deliberately overpaying for welfare services bought from private companies who in return would sponsor the Farum football team. Brixtofte was forced to step down as chairman and the club became close to bankruptcy. ===FC Nordsj\u00e6lland (2003\u2013present)=== alt=refer to caption In March 2003, Farum BK was bought by AKP Holding, the holdings company of local businessman Allan K. Pedersen, and in an effort to distance the club from the Brixtofte scandal, Farum BK was re-branded as FC Nordsj\u00e6lland, named after the North Zealand (Danish: Nordsj\u00e6lland) region to clarify the club was to represent both the region as well as the town in which the club is based. To reinforce the status as a regional team, a network of local football clubs from the surrounding area was created, consisting of around 66 teams, with the aim to highlight young talent in the region and bring it to national attention via FC Nordsj\u00e6lland. The network is known as Fodbold Samarbejde Nordsj\u00e6lland (FSN). The club's second year in the Superliga, first as Nordsj\u00e6lland, struggled to improve on the previous year's outing. With its worst goal difference since turning professional, not one FCN player ended in the top ten goal scorers, fighting to avoid relegation for most of the season, ending the campaign in ninth place. The Wild Tiger fans, however, were rewarded with European football with the club's first appearance in the UEFA Cup; it beat Armenian team Shirak 6\u20130 on aggregate in the qualifying round, but were eliminated in the first round by Greek team Panionios. Christian Andersen was sacked at the end of the 2003\u201304 season, replaced by Johnny Petersen as head coach. The following two years under Johnny Petersen were spent avoiding relegation, with no success to speak of in either the Superliga or Danish Cup. Petersen's reign was not completely amiss, as he was noted for creating a good young team and the emergence of players Mads Junker and Anders Due. For the 2006\u201307 season, Morten Wieghorst was promoted from assistant to head coach, a position the former Celtic player would retain for five years. Wieghorst's first dilemma in charge of FCN was to fill the gap left by top scorer Mads Junker, sale to Dutch side Vitesse the previous winter. Morten Nordstrand came in on a free from nearby Lyngby after scoring 29 goals in the 1st Division that previous season. Nordstrand would go on to make an instant impact, topping the goal scorers charts for the first half of the 2006\u201307 season and earning himself a call up to the Denmark national team. Helping the club to a fifth-place finish, Nordstrand ended the season with 18 goals after appearing in every league match that season. Danish champions Copenhagen purchased the player at the end of the season for a then record 15 million Danish kroner, becoming the largest transfer fee ever paid for a player between two Danish clubs. With lower-than-average attendance and issues still arising from the Brixtofte scandal, chairman Allan Kim Pedersen confirmed there had been discussions to move the club north to Hiller\u00f8d, where it would be able expand to other sports such as ice hockey and basketball. The move, however, never materialized. Nordsj\u00e6lland would find itself in a similar position the following season, again having sold its star striker Martin Bernburg to Copenhagen. The team only managed a ninth-place finish, yet qualified for the UEFA Cup for the second time via the UEFA Respect Fair Play rankings. 2008\u201309 would become a good year for the Wild Tigers in terms of cup competitions, making it to the quarter-finals in the Danish Cup for the second time in its history, and improving on its previous European outing with wins over TVMK Tallinn and Queen of the South, though later being knocked out by Greek side Olympiacos 0\u20137 aggregate. In October 2008, Allan K. Pedersen sold FC Nordsj\u00e6lland from AKP Holding to himself for a reported 500,000 Danish kroner, shortly before his holding company went bankrupt, a price Pedersen, however, denies. Following an investigation from his creditors, it was found that the sale was forced through without the bank's consent, and that the value for which the club was sold was too low, which ultimate reduced the finances the creators received for the sale. FCN was reevaluated to be worth 35 million kroner at the time of sale. The case has gone to the Supreme Court and is yet to be resolved; it speculated that it could take one-to-four years. The 2009\u201310 season saw Nordsj\u00e6lland lift its first trophy, the Danish Cup. FCN was not drawn against another Superliga team until the quarter-final meeting with Silkeborg, where it won 3\u20131 in extra time. The team would go on to face Midtjylland in Nordsj\u00e6lland's first cup final, winning in extra time 2\u20130 with goals from new signing Nicolai Stokholm and Bajram Fetai, and qualifying for European competition in the newly remodeled UEFA Europa League. The team would repeat this feat the following season, facing Midtjylland once again in the finals of the Danish Cup and winning the trophy for the second time with a 3\u20132 win. This would be Morten Wieghorst's last trophy with the Wild Tigers, however; he moved to manage the Denmark under-21 national team at the end of the 2010\u201311 campaign. Kasper Hjulmand was named Wieghorst's successor in June 2011, promoted from the coaching staff. In preparation for the 2011\u201312 season, the former Lyngby head coach brought in two Danish internationals in Mikkel Beckmann (from relegated Randers) and Patrick Mtiliga (on a free from M\u00e1laga). FCN sought to improve on the previous season's sixth-place finish and to defend its Danish Cup title for the second year running. It would go on to play in the Europa League for second year in a row, exiting the competition in the third qualifying round after losing to Sporting CP 2\u20131 aggregate, which had also eliminated Nordsj\u00e6lland from Europe the previous season. left FCN started the new season in good form, peaking as high as second in the Superliga, and an undefeated run at home in all competitions until the 30 October, including an impressive 0\u20130 draw with Portuguese side Sporting CP, making the start of the 2011\u201312 campaign one of its best starts in recent years. For the first time in club history, a total of five players were called up to the Denmark national team to face Sweden and Finland in November: Mikkel Beckmann, Andreas Bjelland and debutantes Tobias Mikkelsen, Jesper Hansen and Jores Okore. FCN ended the season as Superliga champions for the first time in its history. right In 2012\u201313, for the first time FCN participated in the UEFA Champions League, where it was drawn into a difficult group alongside defending champions Chelsea, Serie A champions Juventus and Ukrainian Premier League champions Shakhtar Donetsk. FCN played all its home matches at the Danish national stadium, Parken. It gained one point from the group stage \u2013 playing 1\u20131 against Juventus at home thanks to a direct free-kick goal from Mikkel Beckmann. In the last group match, a controversial goal became the talking point of the match, where Shakhtar Donetsk forward Luiz Adriano scored after a fair play situation to level the score; he received a one match ban from UEFA after the match. ==Players== ===Current squad=== ===Out on loan=== ===Retired numbers=== ;26 \u2013 Jonathan Richter (2005\u201309) ===Overall most appearances=== {| style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Rank !Nationality !Name !Years !Appearances |- align=center |1 | |align=left|Thomas Andreasen |1999\u201307 |295 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee |2 | |align=left|S\u00f8ren Christensen |2005\u201314 |233 |- align=center |3 | |align=left|Jesper Hansen |2001\u201313 |179 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee |4 | |align=left|Nicolai Stokholm |2008\u201314 |178 |- align=center |5 | |align=left|Henrik Kildentoft |2007\u201313 |155 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee |6 | |align=left|Morten Karlsen |2005\u201309 |145 |- align=center |7 | |align=left|Patrick Mtiliga |2011\u2013 |138 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee |8 | |align=left|Bajram Fetai |2007\u201310 |131 |- align=center |9 | |align=left|Michael Parkhurst |2009\u201312 |128 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee |10 | |align=left|Tobias Mikkelsen |2009\u201313,2016- |125 |} ===Overall top scorers=== {| style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Rank !Nationality !Name !Years !Goals |- align=center |1 | |align=left|Martin Bernburg |2007\u201309 |43 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee |2 | |align=left|Emiliano Marcondes |2012\u20132017 |38 |- align=center |rowspan=\"2\"|3 | |align=left|Joshua John |2012\u20132016 |30 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee | |align=left|Marcus Ingvartsen |2014\u20132017 |30 |- align=center |rowspan=\"2\"|5 | |align=left|Bajram Fetai |2007\u201310 |29 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee | |align=left|Tommy Olsen |2003\u201306 |29 |- align=center |7 | |align=left|Mads Junker |2004\u201306 |28 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee |8 | |align=left|Rawez Lawan |2009\u201313 |21 |- align=center |9 | |align=left|Morten Nordstrand |2006\u201307, 2012\u20132014 |20 |- align=center bgcolor=eeffee |rowspan=\"2\"|10 | |align=left|Thomas Kristensen |2005\u201308 |19 |- align=center | |align=left|Tobias Mikkelsen |2009\u20132013,2016\u2013 |19 |} ===Former players=== {| border=\"0\" align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| Denmark * Martin Bernburg * Andreas Bjelland * Anders Due * Carsten Fredgaard * Daniel Jensen * Mads Junker * Thomas Kristensen * Kasper Lorentzen * Tobias Mikkelsen * Nicki Bille Nielsen * Matti Lund Nielsen * Danny Olsen * Tommy Olsen * Nicklas Pedersen * Stephan Petersen * Thomas Rasmussen * Michael Ribers * Jonathan Richter * Simon Richter * Kris Stadsgaard * Jeppe Tengbjerg * Ulrich Vinzents Norway * Lars Bohinen Canada * Patrice Bernier * Issey Nakajima-Farran |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| Costa Rica * Bryan Oviedo Ghana * Enoch Kofi Adu * Francis Dickoh Japan * Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi Macedonia * Bajram Fetai * D\u017eevdet \u0160ainovski Malawi * Joseph Kamwendo Sweden * Pierre Bengtsson * Andreas Dahl * Benjamin Kibebe * Johnny Lundberg * Marcus Pode Turkey * Emre Mor United States * Michael Parkhurst * Heath Pearce |} ===Club captains=== Since 2001, seven players have held the position as club captain for Farum BK or FC Nordsj\u00e6lland.
