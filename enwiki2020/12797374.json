    "text": "The Individual Speedway European Championship is an annual individual speedway event organized by the European Motorcycle Union (UEM) to determine the champion of Europe. The competition was founded in 2001 and was initially staged as a one-off meeting before the single event was replaced by the Speedway European Championship series in 2012. As of 2020, the competition is staged over four rounds in a Grand Prix format, with the winner being the rider who accumulates the most points over the four rounds. The minimum age of a rider to compete is 16 years of age (starting on the date of the rider's birthday). The current champion is Robert Lambert from Great Britain who won the title in 2020. Russia along with Denmark are the most successful countries having had four champions, Emil Sayfutdinov (2014 and 2015), Grigory Laguta (2011) and Renat Gafurov (2009), for Russia and Jesper B. Jensen (2005), Nicki Pedersen (2016), Leon Madsen (2018) and Mikkel Michelsen in (2019) for Denmark. ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" |- align=center |width=35px |Year |width=140px |Venue |width=230px |Winners |width=230px |2nd place |width=230px |3rd place |- |align=center| 2001 | Heusden Zolder || Bohumil Brhel (14 pts) || Mariusz Staszewski (13 pts) || Krzysztof Cegielski (12+3 pts) |- |align=center| 2002 | Rybnik || Magnus Zetterstr\u00f6m (12+3 pts) || Krzysztof Kasprzak (12+2 pts) || Rafa\u0142 Szombierski (11+3 pts) |- |align=center| 2003 | Slan\u00fd || Krzysztof Kasprzak (12+3 pts) || S\u0142awomir Drabik (12+2 pts) || Magnus Zetterstr\u00f6m (11 pts) |- |align=center| 2004 | Holsted || Matej \u017dagar (14+3 pts) || Matej Ferjan (14+2 pts) || Hans N.
