She is a two-division world champion, having held the WBC female flyweight title since 2018 and previously the WBC light flyweight title from 2013 to 2017, as well as the WBA interim female minimumweight title from 2009 to 2011. ==Professional career== Silva made her professional debut on 5 May 2007, scoring a four-round unanimous decision (UD) victory against Ana Arrazola in Metepec, Mexico. Silva won her next fight via split decision (SD) against Esmeralda Moreno in August, before suffering her first career defeat by majority decision (MD) in a rematch with Moreno for the Mexico interim female flyweight title on 23 February 2008 in Toluca, Mexico. Two judges scored the bout 97\u201393 while the third scored it a draw at 96\u201396. Following two points decision (PTS) wins, she defeated Anabel Ortiz via PTS to capture the Mexico female light flyweight title on 21 November 2008 at Salon Marbet Plus in Ciudad Nezahualc\u00f3yotl, Mexico. In her next fight she challenged WBA light flyweight champion Y\u00e9sica Bopp on 8 August 2009 at Palacio Pe\u00f1arol in Montevideo, Uruguay. Silva suffered the second defeat of her career via UD, with the scorecards reading 97\u201393, 99\u201391 and 99\u201392. She moved down a weight class for her next fight to capture the WBA interim female minimumweight title on 5 September at the Roberto Dur\u00e1n Arena in Panama City, Panama, defeating Ana Fernandez via UD with scores of 88\u201382, 87\u201383 and 86\u201384. Silva successfully defended her interim title a month later against Marisol Molina via third- round technical knockout (TKO), before capturing the vacant WBC Youth female minimumweight title on 24 June 2010, defeating Patricia Hernandez by second- round TKO at the Jose Cuervo Salon in Mexico City. She successfully defended her WBC Youth title three times before facing WBA minimumweight champion Etsuko Tada on 17 April 2011, at the Yomiuri Bunka Hall in Toyonaka, Japan. Silva lost in her second attempt at a world title with scores of 96\u201394, 98\u201393 and 98\u201392. Following the defeat to Tada, Silva moved back up to light flyweight to capture the vacant WBC Youth female light flyweight title, defeating Susana Perez via third-round TKO on 11 June at Deportivo Trabajadores del Metro in Mexico City. She defended the title three times before losing it to Jessica Nery Plata by SD on 21 April 2012 at the Estadio Jos\u00e9 Lerma P\u00e9rez in Ocoyoacac, Mexico. She lost her next fight, again by SD, against Irma S\u00e1nchez in June. After a UD win against Fredee Gonzalez in January 2013, she defeated Naoko Shibata by SD to capture the vacant WBC female light flyweight title on 3 March 2013 at the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Japan. Two judges scored the bout 96\u201394 in favour of Silva while the third scored it 96\u201394 to Shibata. She would go on to defend her WBC light flyweight title eight times; against Maricela Quintero in June and Ava Knight in October 2013; Jessica Ch\u00e1vez in November 2014; Jolene Blackshear in May and a third fight with Esmeralda Moreno in September 2015; Mari Ando in March, Keisher McLeod-Wells in July and Nina Radovanovic in November 2016. Her title reign came to an end when she faced Esmeralda Moreno for the fourth time in her career, on 22 April 2017 at Unidad Deportiva Mart\u00edn Alarc\u00f3n in Metepec, Mexico. Two judges scored the bout 95\u201394 and 96\u201393 in favour of Moreno while the third scored it 96\u201393 to Silva. Six months after losing her WBC light flyweight title, she moved up a division to compete at flyweight, defeating Isabel Millan by UD in October before facing Melissa McMorrow for the vacant WBC female flyweight title. The bout took place on 26 May 2018 at the Teatro Moli\u00e8re in Mexico City. Silva defeated McMorrow by UD to become a two-weight world champion, with the scorecards reading 100\u201390 and 98\u201392 twice. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |37 | | |align=left| Edith Flores | |\u2013 (8) |30 Oct 2020 |align=left| | |- |36 |Win |30\u20136 |align=left| Chaoz Minowa |UD |10 |17 Nov 2018 |align=left| | align=left| |- |35 |Win |29\u20136 |align=left| Melissa McMorrow |UD |10 |26 May 2018 |align=left| | align=left| |- |34 |Win |28\u20136 |align=left| Isabel Millan |UD |10 |21 Oct 2017 |align=left| | |- |33 |Loss |27\u20136 |align=left| Esmeralda Moreno |SD |10 |22 Apr 2017 |align=left| | align=left| |- |32 |win |27\u20135 |align=left| Nina Radovanovic |TKO |3 (10), |26 Nov 2016 |align=left| | align=left| |- |31 |Win |26\u20135 |align=left| Keisha Wells |TKO |7 (10), |16 Jul 2016 |align=left| | align=left| |- |30 |Win |25\u20135 |align=left| Mari Ando |TKO |6 (10), |19 Mar 2016 |align=left| | align=left| |- |29 |Win |24\u20135 |align=left| Esmeralda Moreno |UD |10 |5 Sep 2015 |align=left| | align=left| |- |28 |Win |23\u20135 |align=left| Jolene Blackshear |RTD |6 (10), |23 May 2015 |align=left| | align=left| |- |27 |Win |22\u20135 |align=left| Suri Tapia |UD |10 |21 Mar 2015 |align=left| | |- |26 |Win |21\u20135 |align=left| Jessica Ch\u00e1vez |UD |10 |22 Nov 2014 |align=left| | align=left| |- |25 |Win |20\u20135 |align=left| Judith Rodriguez |UD |8 |5 Apr 2014 |align=left| | |- |24 |Win |19\u20135 |align=left| Ava Knight |UD |10 |26 Oct 2013 |align=left| | align=left| |- |23 |Win |18\u20135 |align=left| Marciela Quintero |RTD |8 (10), |29 Jun 2013 |align=left| | align=left| |- |22 |Win |17\u20135 |align=left| Naoko Shibata |SD |10 |3 Mar 2013 |align=left| | align=left| |- |21 |Win |16\u20135 |align=left| Fredee Gonzalez |UD |8 |12 Jan 2013 |align=left| | |- |20 |Loss |15\u20135 |align=left| Irma S\u00e1nchez |SD |10 |2 Jun 2012 |align=left| | |- |19 |Loss |15\u20134 |align=left| Jessica Nery Plata |SD |10 |21 Apr 2012 |align=left| | align=left| |- |18 |Win |15\u20133 |align=left| Guadalupe Bautista |UD |10 |3 Mar 2012 |align=left| | align=left| |- |17 |Win |14\u20133 |align=left| Tania Cosme | |5 (10), |22 Oct 2011 |align=left| | align=left| |- |16 |Win |13\u20133 |align=left| Yacksury Gordan |TKO |3 (10), |13 Aug 2011 |align=left| | align=left| |- |15 |Win |12\u20133 |align=left| Susana Cruz Perez |TKO |3 (10), |11 Jun 2011 |align=left| | align=left| |- |14 |Loss |11\u20133 |align=left| Etsuko Tada |UD |10 |17 Apr 2011 |align=left| | align=left| |- |13 |Win |11\u20132 |align=left| Nancy Franco |TKO |6 (10), |8 Jan 2011 |align=left| | align=left| |- |12 |Win |10\u20132 |align=left| Mayela Perez |TKO |5 (10), |16 Oct 2010 |align=left| | align=left| |- |11 |Win |9\u20132 |align=left| Linda Sanchez |MD |10 |17 Jul 2010 |align=left| | align=left| |- |10 |Win |8\u20132 |align=left| Patricia Hernandez |TKO |2 (10), |24 Jun 2010 |align=left| | align=left| |- |9 |Win |7\u20132 |align=left| Marisol Molina | |3 (10), |31 Oct 2009 |align=left| |align=left| |- |8 |Win |6\u20132 |align=left| Ana Fernandez |UD |9 |5 Sep 2009 |align=left| | align=left| |- |7 |Loss |5\u20132 |align=left| Y\u00e9sica Bopp |UD |10 |8 Aug 2009 |align=left| | align=left| |- |6 |Win |5\u20131 |align=left| Anabel Ortiz |PTS |10 |21 Nov 2008 |align=left| | align=left| |- |5 |Win |4\u20131 |align=left| Jessica Chavez |PTS |6 |7 Jun 2008 |align=left| | |- |4 |Win |3\u20131 |align=left| Momoko Kanada | |4 |26 Apr 2008 |align=left| | |- |3 |Loss |2\u20131 |align=left| Esmeralda Moreno | |10 |23 Feb 2008 |align=left| |align=left| |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |align=left| Esmeralda Moreno | |6 |2 Aug 2007 |align=left| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |align=left| Ana Arrazola | |4 |5 May 2007 |align=left| | |- |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:1989 births Category:Mexican women boxers Category:Mini-flyweight boxers Category:Light-flyweight boxers Category:Flyweight boxers Category:World Boxing Council champions ",
