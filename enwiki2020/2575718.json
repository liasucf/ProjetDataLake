    "text": "is a retired Japanese professional tennis player. A former Wimbledon quarter- finalist, Matsuoka won one singles title during his career, in Seoul in 1992. In the same year, he reached a career-high ranking of world No. 46. ==Professional career== Matsuoka turned professional in 1986. In 1989, he finished runner-up in the top-level tournament at Wellington, and captured the doubles title in Auckland. 1991 saw Matsuoka achieve his career-best Masters result, when he reached the quarter-finals of the 1991 Canada Masters in Montreal, beating Michael Chang in a dramatic 3-set battle en route. In 1992, Matsuoka became the first Japanese player to win a singles event on the ATP Tour when he captured the title in Seoul. He was also runner-up at the prestigious grass court tournament at Queen's Club that year. Matsuoka's best performance at a Grand Slam event came at Wimbledon in 1995, where he reached the quarter-finals, beating Karel Nov\u00e1\u010dek, Mark Knowles, Javier Frana and Michael Joyce before being knocked down by Pete Sampras. Matsuoka won the first set but Sampras came back to win in four sets. At the US Open in 1995, Matsuoka was left writhing in pain on the court after succumbing to blows from a stray tennis racquet during his first round match against Boris Becker. The rules at the time meant that Matsuoka would have forfeited the match if he had gotten medical attention, so he was left to suffer until he was defaulted for delaying the match. The incident led to a change in the rules of professional tennis to allow players to receive medical treatment during matches. Matsuoka's career-high rankings were world No. 46 in singles (in 1992) and World No. 95 in doubles (in 1989). His career prize-money earnings totalled $1,117,112. He retired from the professional tour in April 1998. ==Post retirement== Since his retirement from tennis Matsuoka has become a popular television sports commentator in Japan. He hosts the \"Shuzo Challenge\", an annual tennis camp for young children by the JTA. Kei Nishikori, former World No. 4 and Japanese No. 1, attended the camp when he was 12 years old. Known for his passionate and energetic character, Matsuoka has also appeared in numerous variety programs, as well as in a cameo role for a television drama series. In 2008 Matsuoka was featured in ten television commercials, tying him with Takuya Kimura for the celebrity to be featured in the greatest number of Japanese television commercials that year. ==Personal life== Matsuoka married former TV Tokyo announcer Emiko Taguchi in 1998, and has three children. His father, Isao Matsuoka, is chairman of Toho Co., Ltd., the Japanese film studio known for its Godzilla movies as well as numerous Akira Kurosawa films. ==Career finals== ===Singles (1 win, 2 losses)=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" |- |Legend (Singles) |- style=\"background:#f3e6d7;\" | Grand Slam (0) |- style=\"background:#ffffcc;\" | Tennis Masters Cup (0) |- style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" | ATP Masters Series (0) |- | ATP Tour (1) |} {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:30px\" class=\"unsortable\"|W/L !style=\"width:60px\"|Date !style=\"width:145px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:150px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:110px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss | 0\u20131 | Jan 1989 | Wellington, New Zealand | Hard | Kelly Evernden | 5\u20137, 6\u20131, 4\u20136 |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 1\u20131 | Apr 1992 | Seoul, Korea | Hard | Todd Woodbridge | 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 7\u20135 |- | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss | 1\u20132 | Jun 1992 | London, UK | Grass | Wayne Ferreira | 3\u20136, 4\u20136 |} ===Doubles (1 win, 1 loss)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:30px\" class=\"unsortable\"|W/L !style=\"width:60px\"|Date !style=\"width:145px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:150px\"|Partner !style=\"width:150px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:110px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 1\u20130 | Jan 1989 | Auckland, New Zealand | Hard | Steve Guy | John Letts Bruce Man-Son-Hing | 7\u20136, 7\u20136 |- | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss | 1\u20131 | Jan 1995 | Jakarta, Indonesia | Hard | Ronald Ag\u00e9nor | David Adams Andrei Olhovskiy | 2\u20136, 4\u20136 |} ==Filmography== * Crayon Shin-chan (2015), himself (voice) * Riku\u014d (2017), Joji Misono ==References== == External links == * * * * \u677e\u5ca1\u4fee\u9020\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 | SHUZO MATSUOKA OFFICIAL SITE Category:Japanese male tennis players Category:Olympic tennis players of Japan Category:Sportspeople from Tokyo Category:Tennis players at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Tennis players at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Tennis players at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Internet memes Category:1967 births Category:Living people ",
