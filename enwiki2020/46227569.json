    "text": "Sweet Valley is an electronic music duo consisting of Wavves member Nathan Williams and his brother, Joel \"Kynan\" Williams. The band describes themselves as \" a blood pact between two brothers, Nathan (of Wavves) & Kynan Williams, gone awesomely off the rails,\" or as \"a Bermuda Triangle-like place, where cannabis crumbs, spilt beer, record dust and that mysterious shit you had to blow out of game cartridges all collect as if pulled by some gigantic junkyard magnet.\" They originated, and are based, in Los Angeles, California. The two began in 2012, when Nathan asked his brother to create music with him, now that they were living in the same home, \"or else [Joel] would just be sitting around smoking my weed all day.\" As of 2014, the group is also working on an additional project titled Spirit Club, which recently released a full album. The band also makes remixes of songs of different genres available on an affiliated SoundCloud page. ==History== ===2012\u201313: Stay Calm, Eternal Champ, Tour, Jenova, & SV=== ====Stay Calm==== On August 7, 2012, the group released their first mixtape, Stay Calm, consisting of 9 songs, one of them only lasting for 30 seconds. They had teamed up with Rihanna producer John Hill to create the album. ====Eternal Champ==== On September 12 of that same year, Joel and Nathan Williams released a second album, titled Eternal Champ, which received a score of 6.6 on Pitchfork Media. This collection of 13 songs heavily employs sampling, from Lex Luger, to Three 6 Mafia. ====Tour with GZA==== Only two days after the release of the Eternal Champ kicked off the first concert along the tour with Brooklyn-born Wu-Tang Clan rapper Gza. The tour also included Hip-Hop artist Killer Mike, and post-punk band Bear Hands. ====Jenova==== Exactly three months later, December 12, 2012, watched the release of Jenova. This album contains a total of 17 songs, one of which, Hurricane, was played in the teaser released on YouTube for the album. ====SV==== On the 11 of July, 2013, Sweet Valley released their fourth album through Fool's Gold. This album, titled, SV, contains 12 tracks. ===2014-present: So Serene, Ghetto Cuisine, F.A.N.G, & MNDR: Dance 4 a Dollar=== ====So Serene==== The 10th of February, 2014, was the release date of Sweet Valley's $1, 27 minute, 33 second long \"song,\" So Serene. ====Ghetto Cuisine==== Early April, 2014, rapper DaVinci released an album titled Ghetto Cuisine, produced by Sweet Valley. Two music videos for songs off the album were released on the Fool's Gold Records website. ====F.A.N.G.==== The Sweet Valley album F.A.N.G. was released on 16 May 2014. Very little is known about the album, due to a lack of information or promotion available from Sweet Valley affiliates. The meaning behind the acronym F.A.N.G. is not known at this time. ====MNDR: Dance 4 a Dollar==== Likely the most known and most anticipated EP ever created by Sweet Valley, the collaboration album with pop music singer MNDR was released 17 February 2015. The song Liars, with MNDR, was used in the 2015 film, Entourage. ====Present==== Sweet Valley performed at SXSW on March 18, 2015. The team collaborated with rappers Soulja Boy and Juicy J to release the song \"Big Blue,\" released on 6 May 2015. They also released a collaboration with GZA (with whom they also toured in 2013) for a Converse CONS EP. Little is known about upcoming projects and release dates, although a new release is possible soon according to some videos uploaded by Joel on Instagram. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of Studio Albums ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:19em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:21em;\" | Album details |- | Eternal Champ || * Released: 17 September 2012 * Label: Fool's Gold * Formats: digital download |- | Jenova || * Released: 12 December 2012 * Label: Fool's Gold * Formats: digital download |- | SV || * Released: 11 July 2013 * Label: Fool's Gold * Formats: digital download |- | F.A.N.G. || * Released: 16 May 2014 * Label: Fool's Gold * Formats: digital download |- |Eternal Champ II | * Release: 20 April 2018 * Label: Ghost Ramp * Formats: digital download |} ===Collaboration Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ List of Collaboration Albums |- !
