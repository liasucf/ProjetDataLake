The current appearance derives from 18th- century renovations.Agentschap Onroerend Erfgoed 2017: Heilige Geestcollege, Inventaris Onroerend Erfgoed. Accessed 22 January 2017. When the French authorities confiscated the university buildings in 1797, the property was given to the city, which used it for a school.
