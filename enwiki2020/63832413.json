The Pierre river flows entirely in the forest zone. From the middle of XIXth Century, forestry was the dominant economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second. The lower part of this small valley is served by the Chemin de Parent. The river surface is generally frozen from mid-November to the end of April. Safe circulation on the ice is generally done from the end of December to the beginning of March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation. == Geography == The watersheds neighboring the Pierre River are: * north side: Mitchinamecus River; * east side: Lac de la Souris, lac Pothole; * south side: Lake Wagwabika, Lake Nemiscachingue, Lake Pothole; * west side: long lake, Mitchinamecus River. Lake Pierre (length: ; width: ; altitude: ) constitutes the head water of the Pierre river. It includes several marsh areas, especially on the south side and at the ends. It is supplied from the north by two lake outlets, four streams, as well as the outlet of eight lakes; and on the south side by the outlet (which empties into Sandy Bay, located at the far east of the lake) from seven lakes. Its mouth is located on the north shore of the western part of the lake. From the mouth (located to the south) of Lake Pierre, the Pierre River flows over , with a drop of , according to the following segments: * to the west by collecting the outlet (coming from the north) from Lac Paul, to the outlet (coming from the south) from Clair and Green lakes; * towards the north, bending towards the west at the end of the segment to go and cut the Chemin de Parent (north\u2013south direction), to its mouth.Atlas of Canada - Department of Natural Resources Canada - Pierre River - Distance and altitude measurements established from the application of site measurements. The Pierre river flows on the east bank of the Mitchinamecus River, in the southern part of Lac Long which is formed by a widening of the river. From there, the current crosses Long Lake to the southwest on , then follows the course of the Mitchinamecus River on , then the course of the river du Li\u00e8vre on which flows onto the north bank of the Ottawa River. == Toponymy == The toponym \"Rivi\u00e8re Pierre\" was formalized on January 24, 1992 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec - Pierre River == Notes and references == == Appendices == === Related articles === * Matawinie Regional County Municipality * Baie-Obaoca, a TNO * Mitchinamecus River * Rivi\u00e8re du Li\u00e8vre, a stream * Ottawa River, a stream * Mitchinamecus Reservoir, a body of water * List of rivers of Quebec === External links === Category:Rivers of Lanaudi\u00e8re ",
