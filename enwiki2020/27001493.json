At the onset of the Second Schleswig War, Hammer enlisted again and commanded a flotilla of Danish naval units in the North Frisian Islands with his headquarters in Wyk auf F\u00f6hr. Initially, he successfully fought off superior Austro-Prussian forces. But when requested reinforcements did not arrive and his opponents were able to capture the island of Sylt and then F\u00f6hr, Hammer himself was taken prisoner by Prussian Lieutenant Ernst von Prittwitz und Gaffron on 19 July 1864 in Wyk, and was held captive until August of that year.
