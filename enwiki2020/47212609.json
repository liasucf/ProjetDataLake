    "text": "The John F. Brewer House is a historic house on Arkansas Highway 9 in Mountain View, Arkansas, one block south of the Stone County Courthouse. It is a roughly rectangular single-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof and stuccoed exterior. Shed-roof dormers project from the sides of the roof, and a small gabled section projects forward on the left front facade, with a deep porch wrapping around to the right. There are exposed rafter ends at the eaves in the Craftsman style. This house, built in the 1920s, is believed to be the first Craftsman/Bungalow-style house built in Stone County. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Stone County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1924 Category:Houses in Stone County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Stone County, Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Mountain View, Arkansas ",
