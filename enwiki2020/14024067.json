    "text": "In the field of enzymology, a betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase also known as betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) is a zinc metallo- enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from trimethylglycine and a hydrogen ion from homocysteine to produce dimethylglycine and methionine respectively: * Trimethylglycine (methyl donor) + homocysteine (hydrogen donor) \u2192 dimethylglycine (hydrogen receiver) + methionine (methyl receiver) Diagram of the action of BHMT This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. This enzyme participates in the metabolism of glycine, serine, threonine and also methionine. ==Isozymes== In humans, there are two isozymes, BHMT and BHMT2, each encoded by a separate gene. {| | | |} ==Tissue distribution== BHMT is expressed most predominantly in the liver and kidney. ==Clinical significance== Mutations in the BHMT gene are known to exist in humans. Anomalies may influence the metabolism of homocysteine , which is implicated in disorders ranging from vascular disease, autism, and schizophrenia to neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida. ==See also== * Betaine ==References== == Further reading == * ==External links== * * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of known structure ",
