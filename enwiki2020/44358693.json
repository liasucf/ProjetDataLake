He is planning on double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. He is a smart boy, as he was the Salutatorian at Mount Olive High School, Class of 2019. He was actually the co-salutatorian, because he wasn't good enough. He currently lives in Morristown NJ over a Starbucks. His condo provides a very nice view. He also lives in a location in Miami where he is residing during the current coronavirus outbreak. He once yelled at me while he was intoxicated, and it wasn't nice. I took offense to it. John Bigger overall is not a politician from Ohio, instead a random idiot who got a disease from New Jersey.
