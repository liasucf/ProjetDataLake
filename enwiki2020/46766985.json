Most notably, music critic Jack Bowers gave the recording 4 and a half of 5 stars and notes, \"...Waldrop's first visit to a recording studio with his own big band was worth the wait.\"Bowers, Jack. All About Jazz, review of Time Within Itself, April 2, 2015 == Background == Early in 2013 Michael Waldrop forwarded a portfolio of songs (jazz instrumentals) to Jack Cooper in order to commission big band arrangements. After Cooper arrived back from a trip to England in the Summer or 2013 he was finally able to assess the tunes and make some decisions. Because of the high quality of Waldrop's compositions it was suggested he try to pursue a whole commercial CD that would feature Waldrop. A substantial grant ($10,000) was obtained by Waldrop from Eastern Washington University to doing a CD.Academic Affairs: Update\u2014Winter 2014, Eastern Washington University, Waldrop faculty research grant announcedCALE Newsletter from the University of Eastern Washington, \"Michael Waldrop Releases CD\", Spring 2015 Both a commercial big band CD and a 'Music Minus One' (for students drummers) types of projects were pursued. Due to the complexity of having both types of recordings and the many cost prohibitive factors involved, the decision was made to recorded during the Summer of 2014 in Dallas, Texas. The studio used was Crystal Clear Sound located in the northern part of the city. Soon after that recording session on July 11, 2014, John Bishop at Origin Records was approached about carrying the CD as a commercial recording (two other labels were in the running for this).Summit Records and Naxos Records were both solicited in addition to Origin Records The level of artists used on the recording was very high: many of these musicians are both established recording artists and full-time college educators.University of Southern Mississippi School of Music announcement for March 9, 2015, Lawrence Panella featured on \"Time Within Itself\" CDCommercial Appeal/University of Memphis School of Music announcement for March 2015, Jack Cooper featured on \"Time Within Itself\" CDUNC Charlotte announcement for March 18, 2015, Will Campbell featured on \"Time Within Itself\" CD] == Track listing == == Recording == * July 11, 2014 Recorded at Crystal Clear Sound, Dallas, Texas. == Personnel == === Musicians === *Conductor, arranger, composer: Jack Cooper *Alto Saxophone/flute/clarinet/soprano sax: Will Campbell *Alto Saxophone/flute/clarinet: Tim Ishii *Tenor Saxophone/flute/clarinet/soprano sax: Larry Panella *Tenor Saxophone/clarinet: Chris McGuire *Baritone Saxophone/bass clarinet: Paul Baker *Trumpet and flugelhorn: Keith Jourdan (lead), David Spencer, Larry Spencer, Mike Steinel *Trombone: Anthony Williams (lead), Tony Baker, Greg Waits, John Wasson (bass) *Guitar: Chris DeRose *Piano: Steve Snyder *Bass: Carl Hillman *Drums and Vibraphone: Mike Waldrop *Guitar/Vocal : Jimi Tunnell (guitar on tracks 2,6,7 vocals on track 2) *Guitar: Chad McLoughlin (guitar on track 3) *Vocal: Sandra Dudley (on tracks 6 & 7) *Percussion: Jos\u00e9 Rossy (on tracks 2,4,5,6,7) === Production === *Executive Producer: John Bishop *Producer: Michael Waldrop *Associate Producers: Jimi Tunnell, Jack Cooper, Tim Reppert *Recording engineer: Kent Stump at Crystal Clear Sound, July 11, 2014 *Recording engineer (additional and overdubs): Jimi Tunnell *Editing and mix engineer: Tim Reppert at Soundtrack Studios, Boston and REP Studio, Ithaca, NY. *Mastering: Robert Vosgien at Capitol Records, Los Angeles *Liner notes: Bill Milkowski *Cover design and layout: John Bishop *Cover Painting: Laurin Rinder *Liner photographs: Daniel Pardo and Ivana \u0106ojba\u0161i\u0107 *Jimi Tunnell vocal and guitar was recorded at Buffalo Sound in Denton, Texas, August 2014 *Vibraphone was recorded at Michael Lewis Music in Spokane WA, July 18, 2014 *Sandra Dudley was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee, August 8, 2014 by Brendan Harkin at Wildwood Recording. == Promotion == The 'Time Within Itself' CD was premiered in Memphis, Tennessee on March 7, 2015 by the Jazz Orchestra of the Delta as part of the University of Memphis Jazz Week performances.Richens, Mark.

Smart, carefully plotted arrangements, crisp, thoughtful solos, surprises at every turn and a consistently solid groove result in a big band set for people who never thought they\u2019d like big band music.' Jeff Tamarkin, Associate Editor, JazzTimes magazine '\u201cTime Within Itself\u201d is a state-of-the-art modern large jazz ensemble project that I highly recommend. Made up of some of my favorite people in the Dallas Fort Worth area as well as some imports, this band is magnificent. Standouts to me were Mike\u2019s wonderful drums and the thrilling guitar of Jimi Tunnell. When you add Sandra\u2019s (Dudley) voice to the mix, you get a great 21st Century texture that lifts this project up into the contemporary sizzle zone! I really enjoyed the masterful orchestrations and developmental writing of Jack Cooper. He has really developed a musical palette that can tell a story in a very evocative manner. Great stuff one-and- all!' Steve Wiest, multiple Grammy-nominated, multi-genre artist. \"Impeccable performance, great charts, a fresh new sound. Bravo!\" Chris Walden, 6 time Grammy nominated composer/arranger, for film, T.V. and numerous recording artists \"It is always refreshing to hear new original big band music. Michael Waldrop and Jack Cooper have struck a great balance on their new album from Origin Records; \u2018Time With Itself.\u2019 Nothing drives a band better than a drummer playing his own music; there is a special groove that comes out that feels just right. However, without great arrangements the music might turn into one long, funky drum solo; that is for sure not the case here. Cooper\u2019s colorful and inventive arrangements bring all the tunes to life, showcasing his style while bringing the out the best in Waldrop\u2019s tunes.\" Tim Davies, Grammy-nominated composer, orchestrator, and drummer. == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" !
