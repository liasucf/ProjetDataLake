    "text": "Sodexo Justice Services (formerly United Kingdom Detention Services and Kalyx), a subsidiary of Sodexo, is a company that provides custodial and post- release facilities for the United Kingdom Home Office. The company changed its name to Sodexo Justice Services in 2011. As of 2016 subsidiary the company operated 122 prisons in eight countries, including 42 in the Netherlands, 34 in France, and others in Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Chile. In the U.K. Sodexo Justice Services provides services to the Ministry of Justice: particularly design, construction, management and financing of contracts for PFI prisons. In December 2008, it opened a new prison in West Lothian on behalf of the Scottish Prison Service. ==Controversy== In August 2013, Sodexo Justice Services was criticised in an official report for subjecting a female prisoner to \"cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment\", which \"appears to amount to torture\" at HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, UK. The woman was kept segregated from other prisoners in an \"unkempt and squalid\" prison cell for more than five years. In October 2016 a video of naked Sodexo prisoners pretending to be dogs was found, prompting an investigation into the violence and humiliation by Sodexo.https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester- news/hmp-forest-bank-prison-crisis-15071274 Sodexo managed facility HMP Northumberland was featured in BBC Panorama 13.2.17, highlighting serious mismanagement issues related to widespread illegal substance abuse.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38931580 Soon after, Sodexo managed facility HMP Forest Bank was alleged to be having a 'spice' epidemic in an article in the Manchester Evening News: \"The devastated sister of a prisoner found dead in his cell says inmates are being regularly carried out of their cells high on Spice.\" http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater- manchester-news/forest-bank-prisoner-death-spice-12611488 In December 2018, Sodexo was accused of neglect and systemic failures resulting in the death of female prisoner Natasha Chin.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home- news/natasha-chin-death-prison-hmp-bronzefield-surrey-sodexo-inquest- neglect-a8683266.html Members of INQUEST have pointed to previous neglect- related deaths at the same prison and have suggested that no decisive actions have been taken to act in prevention of additional future deaths. In February 2019, Sodexo was criticized by the United Kingdom Ministry of Justice for failing to prevent repeated and systemic breaches of the human rights of inmates at the Sodexo-operated HMP Peterborough. This stemmed from a series of illegal strip-searches of prisoners at the jail in 2017, including one inmate who was menstruating and another who was transitioning from female to male. Justice Julian Knowles described the illegal procedures as \"humiliating and embarrassing.\" https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47334760 In October 2019 a woman gave birth alone in her cell at HMP Bronzefield. The baby died at the prison. Surrey police said in a statement: \u201cThe death is currently being treated as unexplained and an investigation is continuing to establish the full circumstances of what happened.\u201d The case raised serious questions about how the woman came to be unsupervised and without medical support during her labour and birth, and about the conditions at the privately run prison. Four women have died at Bronzefield since July 2016.The Guardian, 4 October 2019 baby dies in uk prison after inmate gives birth alone in cell ==Prisons managed== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name !!
