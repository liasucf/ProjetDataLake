    "text": "The Debenham Islands are a group of islands and rocks lying between Millerand Island and the west coast of Graham Land. The Debenham Islands were discovered and named by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) (1934\u201337) under John Riddoch Rymill; the BGLE base was on Barry Island, in the center of the group, during part of this time. They were named for Frank Debenham, who served as a member of the BGLE Advisory Committee. The Argentinian San Mart\u00edn Base is located on Barry Island. == See also == * Composite Antarctic Gazetteer * List of Antarctic islands south of 60\u00b0 S * Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research * Territorial claims in Antarctica == Further reading == \u2022 Ben Saul, Tim Stephens, editors Antarctica in International Law, P 269 ==References== * Category:Islands of Graham Land Category:Falli\u00e8res Coast ",
