    "text": "12 Bar Blues is the debut solo album from Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland. Its sound and style differ greatly from STP's previous releases. The design concept of the cover is a homage to the cover design of John Coltrane's Blue Train album. The title name comes from the simple chord progression known as \"twelve-bar blues.\" ==Development== In a 1998 interview on MTV's 120 Minutes, Weiland states that his then brother-in-law introduced him to Blair Lamb, who co-produced 12 Bar Blues with Weiland. ==Reception== Released in 1998 on Atlantic Records, the album was not a commercial success, but achieved some critical acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, declaring \"12 Bar Blues is an unpredictable, carnivalesque record confirming that Weiland was the visionary behind STP's sound. He's fascinated by sound, piling on layers of shredded guitars, drum loops, and keyboards, making sure that each song sounds drastically different from its predecessor.\"[ Allmusic] review, cited September 20, 2008 David Fricke of Rolling Stone awarded the album 3.5 out of 5 stars and declared that \"12 Bar Blues isn't really a rock album, or even a pop album. Weiland, out on his own, has simply made an honest album \u2013 honest in its confusion, ambition and indulgence. It was worth the risk.\" but also remarked that \"Maybe it's a little early for Scott Weiland to be going the solo way.\"Rolling Stone Rolling Stone Magazine review, cited September 20, 2008 Pitchfork Media stated upon its release that \"12 Bar Blues is easily the most innovative album Weiland has ever produced for public consumption,\" while Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"the LP's sheer invention and hooks will make your indulgence worthwhile.\" ==Track listing== *All Songs Written By Scott Weiland (Foxy Dead Girl Music).
