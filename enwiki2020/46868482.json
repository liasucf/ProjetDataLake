    "text": "Verticillium isaacii is a fungus inhabiting artichoke, spinach and lettuce, without necessarily being pathogenic. It causes verticillium wilt in some plant species. It produces yellow-pigmented hyphae and microsclerotia, while producing abundant chlamydospores and resting mycelium. It is most closely related to V. tricorpus and V. klebahnii. ==References== ==Further reading== *Inderbitzin, Patrik, et al. \"Identification and differentiation of Verticillium species and V. longisporum lineages by simplex and multiplex PCR assays.\" PLoS ONE8.6 (2013): e65990. *Stajner, Natasa. \"Identification and Differentiation of Verticillium Species with PCR Markers and Sequencing of ITS Region.\" Plant and Animal Genome XXIII Conference.
