Tanzania does not have embassy in Spain, but his embassy in Paris is accredited to this country.[v| List of foreign embassies in Spain] Spain has an embassy in Dar es Salaam and an honorary consulate in Zanzibar.Ficha de Tanzania Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Representation Data. == Bilateral relations == Bilateral relations with Tanzania are stable and positive, and for some time the priorities have centered around four main axes: Fishing, since half of the Spanish tuna fleet - based on Seychelles - works in these waters with their corresponding annual renewed Tanzanian licenses. Security, as Tanzania and part of the Mozambique Channel are part of the high-risk scenario for piracy activities and other maritime threats. Spanish vessels monitor the Tanzanian waters within the Operation Atalanta of the European Union and the Operation Shield of the Ocean of NATO and frequently arrive in Dar es Salaam, while the European Union is dealing with its allies (United States, Japan) to strengthen Tanzania's naval and security capabilities in the fight against piracy. Tanzania has been participating since 2013 in the EUCAP- Nestor mission of the European Union to strengthen maritime security capabilities in the region, in which Spain also participates. Tourism, a sector in which Spain is a world leader and has begun to be implemented in this market in a double way: the investment of Meli\u00e1 Hotels International in Zanzibar and the privileged annual participation of the Tanzanian tourism sector - both national and forming part of the regional organization EAC\u2014 in FITUR and its Investigation Forum INVESTOUR. Energy, for which there is a vast market and in which Spanish companies have carried out rural electrification projects and participate in the construction of generating plants (ISOLUX). There are also prospects for participation in the development of the oil and especially gas sectors. Commercial relations are scarce.Ficha de Tanzania Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Bilateral Relations. == Cooperation == Tanzania does not appear in the ranking of priority countries established by the current Master Plan for Spanish Cooperation (2013-2016), so it does not receive official development assistance bilaterally. From the multilateral point of view, in 2014, an aid of 1.5 M. USD was approved for Tanzania from the Spain-UNDP Trust Fund for the fulfillment of the Sustainable Objectives in the 2014-2016 period. The project will be implemented through the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF). Tanzania has also received some contributions in the recent past: \u20ac 6M 2008-2010 for the UN \u201cDelivering as One\u201d Program and other timely contributions such as to WFP in 2009 worth \u20ac 2M. In 2009, a grant of \u20ac2,000,000 was granted from the Food and Emergency Assistance Area to the World Food Program for the project \u201cAssistance to Refugees in Camps and Vulnerable Households among the Host Population in North-Western Tanzania\u201d. Spain also contributed \u20ac6 million in three years (2008-2010) to the \u201cDelivering as One\u201d United Nations Program.Ficha de Tanzania Office of Diplomatic Information.
