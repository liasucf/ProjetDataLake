    "text": "An SS-Rottenf\u00fchrer serving at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. Rottenf\u00fchrer (, ) was a Nazi Party paramilitary rank that was first created in the year 1932. The rank of Rottenf\u00fchrer was used by several Nazi paramilitary groups, among them the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Schutzstaffel (SS) and was senior to the paramilitary rank of Sturmmann. The insignia for Rottenf\u00fchrer consisted of two double silver stripes on a bare collar patch. On field grey SS uniforms, the sleeve chevrons of an Obergefreiter (senior lance-corporal) were also worn. ==Creation== Rottenf\u00fchrer was first established in 1932 as an SA rank due to an expansion of the organisation requiring a greater number of enlisted positions. Since early SS ranks were identical to the ranks of the SA, Rottenf\u00fchrer became an SS rank at the same time. Rottenf\u00fchrer was the first SS and SA position to have command over other paramilitary troops. They commanded a rotte (, equal to a squad or section) usually numbering no more than five to seven persons. A Rottenf\u00fchrer, in turn, answered to a Scharf\u00fchrer. After 1934, a restructure of SS ranks made Rottenf\u00fchrer junior to the new rank of SS-Unterscharf\u00fchrer, although in the SA the rank continued to rate immediately below that of Scharf\u00fchrer. ==Uses== Taken during the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The SS (and also SD) Rottenf\u00fchrer on the right is Josef Bl\u00f6sche. Within the Waffen-SS, Rottenf\u00fchrer was considered equivalent to an Obergefreiter in the German Wehrmacht. For pay purposes, a Rottenf\u00fchrer with more than five years of service was administratively known as Rottenf\u00fchrer (2. Gehaltsstufe) and paid the same rate as an Army Stabsgefreiter. There was no difference in the Rottenf\u00fchrer insignia and the Gehaltsstufe designation was only used in written correspondence and never in verbal addressing of rank. While having command over some troops, a Rottenf\u00fchrer in the Waffen-SS was not considered a non-commissioned officer rank. Those aspiring for promotion above Rottenf\u00fchrer were required to pass a promotion evaluation and combat skills assessment, during which time the Rottenf\u00fchrer was known by the title Unterf\u00fchrer-Anw\u00e4rter (). Waffen-SS Rottenf\u00fchrer also had the option to pursue an officer's commission through appointment as SS-Junker. Rottenf\u00fchrer was also a rank of the Hitler Youth where the position was considered a junior squad leader title. A rank of Oberrottenf\u00fchrer also existed in the Hitler Youth. ==Insignia== SS- Rottenf\u00fchrer.svg|SS Gorget patches WSS-Rottenf OF3 slv 1945.svg|SS Sleeve badge SS Mannschaften.jpg|Shoulder strap (all other enlisted ranks OR-1 to OR-3 of the Waffen-SS) HJ- Rottenf\u00fchrer.svg|HJ Shoulder strap HJ-Oberrottenf\u00fchrer.svg|HJ Oberrottenf\u00fchrer Shoulder strap NSFK-Rottenf\u00fchrer.svg|NSFK Gorget patches NSKK- Rottenf\u00fchrer.svg|NSKK Gorget patch SA-Rottenf\u00fchrer.svg|SA Gorget patch == See also == * Table of ranks and insignia of the Waffen-SS == Notes == == Bibliography == * * * * {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.5em auto; clear: both;\" |- |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Junior Rank Sturmmann |width=\"40%\" align=\"center\"|SS rank Rottenf\u00fchrer |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Senior Rank Unterscharf\u00fchrer |- |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Junior Rank Sturmmann |width=\"40%\" align=\"center\"|SA rank Rottenf\u00fchrer |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Senior Rank Scharf\u00fchrer |- |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Junior rank Gefreiter |width=\"40%\" align=\"center\"|Rank Wehrmacht (Heer) Obergefreiter |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Senior rank Unteroffizier |} Category:SS ranks ",
