    "text": "publisher's mark of Tsutaya J\u016bzabur\u014d 158 works and sketches survive of the Japanese artist known only by the art name T\u014dsh\u016bsai Sharaku. Almost all were made over a ten-month period in 1794\u20131795, divided into four periods: # 5th month of Kansei 6 (May\u2013June 1794) \u2013 28 \u014dban prints # 7th and 8th months of Kansei 6 (July\u2013September 1794) \u2013 8 \u014dban and 30 hosoban prints # 11th and intercalary 11th months of Kansei 6 (November 1794 \u2013 January 1795) \u2013 47 hosoban, 13 aiban, and 4 \u014dban prints # 1st month of Kansei 7 (February\u2013March 1795) \u2013 10 hosoban and 5 aiban prints The print sizes became progressively smaller and the focus shifts from busts to full-length portraits. The depictions become less expressive and more conventional. Two picture calendars dating to as early as 1789 and three decorated fans as late as 1803 have been attributed to Sharaku, but have yet to be accepted as authentic works of his. A number of hanshita-e preparatory drawings have also been found. ==Background== In Sharaku's time the Kawarazaki-za, the Kiri-za, and the Miyako-za were the three major kabuki theatre houses of Edo: the Edo San-za. Just over 600 copies of Sharaku's prints are known; only about 100 remain in Japan. As they are in collections scattered throughout the world general research on Sharaku's works has followed different threads in Japan and the West has proved time-consuming. Japanese researchers have better knowledge of and access to documents and literature related to Sharaku's time and conditions. On the other hand, Sharaku's works tend to be in Western collections, including prints for which only one copy is known\u2014of which there are about three dozen. Three of these are of unknown whereabouts, known only through published photographs. The largest Western collection is the 70 pieces at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 6 of which are unique; the Art Institute of Chicago (8 unique pieces), New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, and the Guimet Museum in Paris also have substantial collections. In 1920, K\u014djir\u014d Matsukata bought a large number of ukiyo-e prints in Paris and brought them back to Japan. These 70 pieces reside at the Tokyo National Museum, 3 of which are unique. The prints bear no titles, and descriptive titles vary in both Japanese and English. Amongst the variations in Japanese are the numbering for the generations of actors; for example, a second-generation actor's name might have nidai () or nidaime () prepended in some sources and nisei () in others, or the generation might be absent. The list here does not give variant titles, and the titles given are not official. ===Print sizes=== Sharaku's prints appeared in the common print sizes \u014dban, hosoban, and aiban. The approximate dimensions of these sizes are: *\u014dban \u2013 *hosoban \u2013 *aiban \u2013 ===Periodization=== Sharaku's prints are divided into four periods. The prints of the first two periods are signed \"T\u014dsh\u016bsai Sharaku\" (), and the latter two only # 5th month of Kansei 6 \u2013 28 \u014dban prints #: The 5th month of Kansei 6 fell from 29 May to 26 June 1794. # 7th and 8th months of Kansei 6 \u2013 8 \u014dban and 30 hosoban prints #: The 7th month of Kansei 6 fell from 27 July to 25 August 1794, and the eighth month from 26 August to 23 September 1794. # 11th and intercalary 11th months of Kansei 6 \u2013 47 hosoban, 13 aiban, and 4 \u014dban prints #: The 11th month of Kansei 6 fell from 23 November to 22 December 1794, and the intercalary 11th month from 23 December 1794 to 20 January 1795. # 1st month of Kansei 7 \u2013 10 hosoban and 5 aiban prints #: The 1st month of the 7th year of Kansei fell from 19 February to 20 March 1795. The print sizes progressively became smaller and the focus shifts from busts to full-length portraits. The depictions become less expressive and more conventional. Two picture calendars dating to as early as 1789 and three decorated fans as late as 1803 have been attributed to Sharaku, but have yet to be accepted as authentic works of his. ==First period== Sharaku's first period is made up of twenty-eight known prints, each in \u014dban size. They appeared in the 5th month of Kansei 6, which fell from 29 May to 26 June 1794. They depict actors in their r\u00f4les in the kabuki plays Hana-ayame Bunroku Soga, Katakiuchi Noriai-banashi, Koi Ny\u014db\u014d Somewake Tazuna, and Yoshitsune Senbon- zakura. === Hana-ayame Bunroku Soga === Playwright Matsui Y\u016bsuke's Hana-ayame Bunroku Soga (, \"Blooming Iris, Soga of the Bunroku Era\") is a kabuki adaptation of a true story of revenge, the early 18th-century in which the Ishii brothers Hanz\u014d and Genz\u014d spent 28 years to exact revenge on their father Uemon's murderer. The story enjoyed great popularity and had several theatrical adaptations. The play d\u00e9buted at the Miyako-za theatre in the 5th month of 6th year of Kansei. Many details of it are no longer known. Ishii Genz\u014d tries to kill his enemy Fujikawa Mizuemon, who instead kills Genz\u014d and his wife. The plot then follows Genz\u014d's retainer Tanabe Bunz\u014d and Genz\u014d's orphaned son, who set off to exact revenge. \u014cgishi Kurando plays a selfless, stately samurai who lends a hand, and Bunz\u014d's retainer Sodesuke serves as comic relief. Hakujin Onayo's r\u00f4le is unknown, but it is thought she helps out with the revenge. ====\u014ctani Tokuji I as the manservant Sodesuke==== alt= Sodesuke is a faithful foot-man of the Ishii family. He is present in the first scene, arriving late to meet his master Ishii Hy\u014dei () at a shrine in Hamamatsu in T\u014dt\u014dmi Province. He witnesses a group including Fujikawa Mizuemon ambush and kill Hy\u014dei before the shrine under cover of darkness. Sodesuke brings Hy\u014dei's body to Hy\u014dei's eldest son Genz\u014d, in the middle of Genz\u014d's wedding, and explains what has happened. Sharaku depicts a shockeded Sodesuke as he arrives at the scene of his master's murder. 18 copies are known of the \u014dban print of \u014ctani Tokuji I (1756\u20131807) as the manservant Sodesuke ( '); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Japan Ukiyo-e Museum, the Ukiyo-e \u014cta Memorial Museum of Art, the Baur Foundation, the Museum of Asian Art, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Harvard Art Museums, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Worcester Art Museum, and another is in a private collection. ====Sakata Hangor\u014d III as Fujikawa Mizuemon==== alt= The powerful Mizuemon, resentful at having lost a sword fight to his patron Ishii Hy\u014dei, murders Hy\u014dei and steals from him a secret book on Japanese swordsmanship. Hy\u014dei's sons attempt revenge, but in the third act Mizuemon kills Hy\u014dei's eldest son Genz\u014d and his wife at the Abe River in neighbouring Suruga Province. Sharaku depicts Mizuemon at the scene of his murder of Genz\u014d. The print pairs with the one of Band\u014d Mitsugor\u014d II as Ishii Genz\u014d. 13 copies are known of the \u014dban print of Sakata Hangor\u014d III as Fujikawa Mizuemon ( '); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Ukiyo-e \u014cta Memorial Museum of Art, the Yamatane Museum, the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Rijksmuseum, the Galerie Ber\u00e8s, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Guimet Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Allen Memorial Art Museum, and a private collection. ====Band\u014d Mitsugor\u014d II as Ishii Genz\u014d==== alt= When Ishii Genz\u014d learns of the murder of his father in the middle of his wedding, he commits himself to revenge.

Sharaku depicts Genz\u014d at his encounter with Mizuemon at the Abe River. The print pairs with the one of Sakata Hangor\u014d III as Fujikawa Mizuemon. 9 copies of the \u014dban print of Band\u014d Mitsugor\u014d II as Ishii Genz\u014d ( '); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Nara Prefectural Museum of Art, the Galerie Ber\u00e8s, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Royal Museums of Art and History, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Guimet Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ====Sanogawa Ichimatsu III as Hakujin Onayo of Gion and Ichikawa Tomiemon as Kanisaka T\u014dma==== alt= T\u014dma is one of Mizuemon's followers, and Onayo a prostitute of the Gion district. The print depicts the pair in the fourth act, when T\u014dma has fallen into such financial ruin that he takes on work as a giday\u016b reciter in bunraku puppet theatre. At this point, he becomes involved with Hakujin Onayo, a prostitute of the Gion district. 6 copies are known of the \u014dban print of Sanogawa Ichimatsu III as Hakujin Onayo of Gion and Ichikawa Tomiemon as Kanisaka T\u014dma ( '); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the Rijksmuseum, the Museum of Asian Art, the Royal Museums of Art and History, and the Art Institute of Chicago, and another is in a private collection. ====Sanogawa Ichimatsu III as Hakujin Onayo of Gion==== alt= Hakujin Onayo is a prostitute of Gion, played by Ichimatsu, an onnagata\u2014a male actor who performed female r\u00f4les. Her r\u00f4le in the narrative is unknown, but it is thought she helps out with the revenge. She may have played a r\u00f4le similar to that of Okaru in the Kanadehon Ch\u016bshingura; Okaru had herself sold into prostitution to raise funds a vendetta. She wears on her clothes the hiragana character \"\u3044\" (\"i\") enclosed in a circle\u2014the same mon crest the kar\u014d \u014cgishi Kurando wears. 10 copies are known of the \u014dban print of Sanogawa Ichimatsu III as Hakujin Onayo of Gion ( ').

He wears on his clothes a mon crest with the hiragana character \"\u3044\" (\"i\") enclosed in a circle, for which Mizuemon mistakes him for a member of the Ishiis in the fifth act and attacks him at a teahouse in Gion. Kurando discovers that his attacker is Mizuemon, and that he has the secret book of swordsmanship. Kurando goes on to help the Ishii brothers get their revenge in the seventh act. Sharaku depicts Kurando at the teahouse in the fifth act. 11 copies are known of the \u014dban print of Sawamura S\u014dj\u016br\u014d III as \u014cgishi Kurando ( '); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Harvard Art Museums, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art; two are in the collection of the Guimet Museum; and two are in private collections. ====Segawa Kikunoj\u014d III as Oshizu, wife of Tanabe Bunz\u014d==== alt= Oshizu is the wife of the Ishii foot-soldier Tanabe Bunz\u014d, who runs into financial ruin in faithful service to his masters. The print depicts Oshizu in the sixth act, as they struggle to repay a userer and resort to prostituting their daughter Omitsu. She wraps her head in a yamai hachimaki (, \"sickness headband\"), a purple headband of silk crepe often worn in kabuki to indicate sickness. Above it a yellow comb decorates the hair. The kimono is white with a faded violet pattern, under which are green and rose garments, all bound with a black obi sash.

In the sixth act, when the destitute Tanabe Bunz\u014d and his wife Oshizu are unable to repay a debt to him, Kinkichi has them sell him their daughter Omitsu as a prostitute. The actor Ry\u016bz\u014d was known as a master of villainous r\u00f4les, and Sharaku's print expresses his hard, unempathetic character in this scene. 22 copies are known of the \u014dban print of Arashi Ry\u016bz\u014d II as Ishibe Kinkichi the moneylender ( ').

He was considered a versatile actor who excelled at r\u00f4les as young girls and courtesans, but who lack in social graces, for which he was given nicknames such as Iya-Tomi or Niku-Tomi (both roughly \"Horrid Tomi\"). It is not known what scene this image represents, but it is assumed to be a different one from that of the other portrait of Yadorigi, as her clothes are different. Some have suggested the scene may be from Act 5. 10 copies are known of the \u014dban print of Segawa Tomisabur\u014d II as Yadorigi, wife of \u014cgishi Kurando ( '); one each are in the collections of the Tokyo National Museum, the , J\u014dsai University, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Royal Museums of Art and History, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and two at the Guimet Museum. ===Katakiuchi Noriai-banashi=== Katakiuchi Noriai-banashi (, \"A Medley of Tales of Revenge\") by the playwright d\u00e9buted at the Kiri-za in the 5th month of the 6th year of Kansei. The play combines two revenge tales: Katakiuchi Ganry\u016bjima (, \"Ganry\u016b-jima Revenge\") and Gotaiheiki Shiroishi Banashi (, \"The Tale of Shiroishi and the Taihei Chronicles\"). The play's villain Shiga Daishichi murders Matsushita Mikinoshin, whose death his daughters Miyagino and Shinobu spend years to avenge, with the help of Gorob\u0113, a fishmonger of San'ya. ====Onoe Matsusuke I as Matsushita Mikinoshin==== alt= Mikinoshin is a r\u014dnin who has fallen sick and fallen into poverty; he is the father of two daughters, Miyagino and Shinobu. Sharaku depicts him in a miserable state here in the third act, in which the villains Shiga Daishichi and an accomplice murder him.

Sharaku has nonetheless delineated their traits as carefully as he has those of the main characters. ===Koi Ny\u014db\u014d Somewake Tazuna=== Koi Ny\u014db\u014d Somewake Tazuna (, \"The Loving Wife's Particoloured Reins\") d\u00e9buted in 1751 in Osaka as a bunraku puppet play and arrived in Edo later the same year as a kabuki play at the Nakamura-za (later called the Miyako-za). The scene focuses on the adulterous relationship of Date no Yosaku, who is a retainer of the Yurugi clan of Tanba Province, and the woman-in-waiting Shigenoi. Trouble befalls the couple at the hands of those such as the wicked retainer Washizuka Happeiji, who has the manservant Edobei steal public funds from Yosaku.
