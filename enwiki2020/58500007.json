    "text": "Triple Punch (also sold as Knock Out!!) is a horizontally-scrolling grid capture game released in arcades by K.K. International (K.K.I.) in 1982. The goal is to color all of the lines on a grid while avoiding or punching pursuers. It was sold both as a conversion kit and as an upright cabinet. ==Gameplay== The player controls a character referred to as a carpenter who looks similar to Mario from the original Donkey Kong. Much like Amidar, the objective is to color the lines around all the rectangles, except in Triple Punch the game board is larger than the screen and scrolls horizontally. Completing multiple rectangles at the same time doubles or triples the bonus. Four enemies chase the player: an eraser, a ghost (\"Ottobake\"), a gorilla (\"Gorigon\"), and a fire. The eraser removes already painted lines. The eraser, ghost, and gorilla can be knocked out with three punches in rapid succession; an ambulance takes them away. The fire is always deadly. ==See also== *Pepper II ==References== ==External links== *Triple Punch gameplay video * category:1982 video games category:Arcade games category:Arcade-only games category:Maze games category:Video games developed in Japan ",
