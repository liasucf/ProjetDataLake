Fire Emblem is a series of tactical role-playing video games developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. Its first game released in Japan in 1990, and is credited with both originating and popularizing its genre. Counting original mainline games, remakes and spin-off titles, fifteen titles have been released as of 2016. Since the release of the seventh game in the series, Nintendo has localized all but one Fire Emblem title, Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem, for the West. Traditionally a hardcore series, incorporating permanent character death for units who fall in battle, the series has trended towards opening up to casual gamers with an optional casual mode, beginning with Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem in 2010. ==Main series== ==Remakes== ==Spin-offs== ==References== Fire Emblem Category:Fire Emblem Fire Emblem ",
