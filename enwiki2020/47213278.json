The film was given a limited release in the United States. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The film made a total of $6,035 from two theaters in the U.S. during its two-week run. ===Critical response=== The film was largely panned by film critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film received a rating of 10%, with a weighted average of 4.2/10, based on 20 reviews indicating \"no consensus yet\". Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \"Director Vivi Friedman's inability to successfully reconcile the film's duality undercuts an eclectic cast gamely committed to Mark Lisson's thematically ambitious, if scattered, script.\" Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine also gave a negative review, writing: \"Sadly, The Family Tree squanders all [the] promise for the usual trite, bluntly written, and poorly staged testaments to love and family. Who needs that when you have a cast this game? A truly troubled family isn't, at the very least, this deadly dull.\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times heavily criticized the film, describing it as a \"hyperactive screenplay by Mark Lisson that is so lacking in substance.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2011 films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:2011 comedy-drama films ",
