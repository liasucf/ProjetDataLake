The company was founded in 1999 in Surrey and is the UK's leading manufacturer of dash cams, as well as producing other in-car technology including DVD players. Nextbase is a registered trademark of Portable Multimedia Ltd. ==History== Nextbase was originally a manufacturer of portable entertainment systems such as DVD players that were used in the back of vehicles. More recently, Nextbase has pioneered a range of branded dashboard cameras, more commonly known as dash cams, digital camcorders, which are placed in-car for filming out through the windscreen. The benefits include capturing footage that can prove the driver\u2019s innocence in the event of a road traffic accident, which can help during the insurance claim process. According to data from independent retail analysts GfK, dashboard mounted digital cameras aka \"dash cams\" became the fastest growing area in consumer electronics, in 2015, with sales increasing by 395%. Of this market in the UK, Nextbase\u2019s range of dash cams now accounts for more than 68 per cent by volume and 73 per cent by value according to more recent GfK stats from March 2016. ==Technology== Launched in March 2016, the Nextbase 212 is the UK's first dash cam with a powered magnetic click and go mount, allowing users to quickly and easily remove the dash cam, saving time fixing the camera to its mount on every journey, as well as removing the need for a wired link between the mount and dash cam. Shortly after the 212 was launched, the 312GW entered the market as the first dash cam in the UK to include in-built Wi-Fi which allows motorists to upload footage to their social media channels, insurer or even the police. The Nextbase 512G is the first dash cam in the UK to have an integrated polarising filter to remove windscreen glare. Additional features include a Sony Exmor sensor and Six- Element Sharp Lenses. Nextbase\u2019s expansion to the in-car tablet mount sector in April 2016 saw it release the Universal Mount, the only tablet mount worldwide to have passed strict European ECE R17 safety tests, keeping a tablet securely fastened in the event of an accident.European ECE R17 Safety Testing:http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/r025r1e.pdf ==Insurance== In 2014, Nextbase pioneered an industry-first collaboration with insurance company Swiftcover. The deal gave customers purchasing an insurance premium through the insurer a 12.5% discount on their quote if they owned a Nextbase dash cam. Since then, various other insurance providers have followed suit, including AXA, who, in late 2014, began offering a discount of 10% to customers with a dash cam. In February 2015 Nextbase contacted 29 major UK insurers, to get their views on dash cams. All of the insurers contacted said that they would accept dash cam evidence in the event of claim. In June 2016, Nextbase agreed a deal with commercial insurance specialists Constructaquote.com, to offer reduced insurance to commercial van drivers and owners of fleets across the UK, who could benefit from 15% off their policy when a Nextbase dash cam is installed. In October 2016, Nextbase signed a partnership with insurance broker Sure Thing!, in turn announcing the largest discount on insurance policies in the industry. Sure Thing! offers a 20% discount on all policies to drivers who own a Nextbase dash cam. ==Awards== The Nextbase 402G model was awarded the first ever Which? Best Buy in the dash cam category in July 2014 and retained this in July 2015. The Nextbase 512G scooped the Which? Best Buy Award in July 2015 and retained this in July 2016. This accolade added to the Auto Express Best Buy award received in March 2016. Nextbase is a sponsor of Halfords Yuasa Racing for the 2016 British Touring Car Championship. ==Sponsorship== Nextbase signed as a sponsor of Halfords Yuasa Racing for the 2016 British Touring Car Championship, which sees driving pair Gordon Shedden, the reigning BTCC Champion, and Matt Neal partner each other for the seventh successive campaign. ==References== ==External links== *Nextbase UK Website *Nextbase Global Website Category:Electronics companies of the United Kingdom ",
