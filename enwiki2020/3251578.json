    "text": "Samuel Nicholas Hipa (born November 30, 1982) is an American heavy metal guitarist. He has performed with several notable acts. He is the current lead guitarist of Wovenwar and was a longtime member of As I Lay Dying. == Background == Hipa started his musical career with the band Evelynn. The band was signed to Pluto Records. In 2001, Evelynn toured with As I Lay Dying. As Evelynn started to disperse, Hipa joined As I Lay Dying in 2003. As I Lay Dying ran its course with the same lineup since 2007, up until Tim Lambesis' arrest, when Hipa, Phil Sgrosso, and Josh Gilbert departed from the band. Alongside AILD drummer Jordan Mancino and Oh, Sleeper and Hipa's former band- mate, Shane Blay, the group of friends formed Wovenwar. In a more recent interview, Mancino stated that AILD is still technically five members, himself, Lambesis, Hipa, Gilbert, and Sgrosso. Hipa performed lead guitars for Wovenwar, appearing on both Wovenwar (2014) and Honor Is Dead (2016) to date. In 2017, Lambesis reformed As I Lay Dying, with all new members, stating that none of the previous members, Hipa included, would return. On June 8, 2018, it was confirmed that Hipa along with the \"classic\" lineup of As I Lay Dying reunited with Lambesis with the release of \"My Own Grave\". On April 12, 2019, the band released a second single, titled \"Redefined\", which also features August Burns Red frontman Jake Luhrs. Hipa was featured on Billy on the Street. == Involvement in controversy == Lambesis, after his arrest, said negative things about the rest of the band, Hipa included. Hipa responded to these statements\u2013particularly accusations of the entire band secretly being atheists and lack of contact with Lambesis after the arrest\u2013calling them slanderous. In November 2016, Hipa stated that Lambesis was, at the time, still of the same mind and that the relationship between the two remained damaged. Hipa's tone however, changed in an October 2017 interview with Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta when asked about a potential As I Lay Dying reunion with the classic members\u2013Hipa replied: \"Man, I'm on the spot\u2026 people ask us about it a lot. But what it comes down to is what makes sense with what we have going on in our lives. And we've got a lot of important things going on that don't relate to that and we've made commitments to, and that's what we are honoring at this moment. Honestly it's just not something we try and consume our thoughts with. Because it's like we have families, businesses, professions, and a band\u2014and all these things we\u2019re super invested into. It's like all of our attention is there with that at the moment.\" In 2018, Hipa reunited with the band. == Christianity == Hipa was raised with Christian values. Over time, Hipa started to exhibit some skepticism, though only on a lower scale, never disclaiming the religion as a whole. == Bands == Hipa performing with As I Lay Dying Current * Wovenwar (2013\u2013present) Former * Evelynn (2001\u20132004) * As I Lay Dying (2003\u20132014, 2018\u20132020) == Discography == As I Lay Dying *Shadows Are Security (2005) *A Long March: The First Recordings (compilation, 2006) *An Ocean Between Us (2007) *The Powerless Rise (2010) *Decas (compilation, 2011) *Awakened (2012) * Shaped by Fire (2019) Wovenwar * Wovenwar (2014) * Honor Is Dead (2016) Guest performances * Total Brutal (2008) \u2013 Austrian Death Machine * Ghost Thief (2013) \u2013 Living Sacrifice * Skydancer (2015) \u2013 In Hearts Wake * Wanderer (2016) \u2013 Heaven Shall Burn Production * Void (2016) \u2013 Destroy the Runner (Teaser production) == References == ==External links== * Category:American heavy metal guitarists Category:Metal Blade Records artists Category:Christian metal musicians Category:Living people Category:American performers of Christian music Category:As I Lay Dying (band) members Category:Wovenwar members Category:1982 births Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:African-American guitarists ",
