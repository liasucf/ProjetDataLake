The cliffs are located near the town of Shaat and overlook the open Arabian Sea. This region of the Arabian Peninsula experiences a summer monsoon known as the Khareef. This leads to Ra's Sajir's green landscape in the summer months, unusual for much the Arabian region. Throughout history, Ra's Sajir has acted as a notable landmark for seafaring traders passing between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and India. ==References== Category:Geography of Oman ",
