Another version Marvel Super Heroes 4D: Avengers Battle in Bali was launched in Bali on November 22, 2013. ==London version== ===Plot=== Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Hulk, Wolverine, Captain America and Spider-Man are invited to the Buckingham Palace to receive awards from the Queen in recognition for their services. But instead the superheroes have to fight huge robots that attack London. Later the guardian of the palaces exposes himself as Doctor Doom. All together they defeat him and when Iron Man falls to ground he is saved by Ms. Marvel. ===Reception=== :Scifibulletin: \"Verdict: With some inventive use of \"traditional\" 3D as well, all it's lacking is a Stan Lee cameo for a Marvel nostalgia tour to be complete. Recommended. 8/10\" :Bleeding Cool: \"The effects are largely well judged \u2013 air jets at floor and head level from all directions, water sprays, and an unexpected claw-jab through the seat back from Wolverine all feature in addition to the traditional shaky floor.\" :Expert Reviews: \"The movie's plot is cleverly contrived too, literally bringing the action into the auditorium by the end. It's all a great finale to a classic London attraction.\" ==New York version== ===Plot=== After an attack on Stark Industries by Dr. Doom, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Captain America, Thor and The Hulk unite as The Avengers to defeat Dr. Doom, Loki and their army of robots. ==References== ==External links== * * * *Official site *Detailed information about the attraction at madametussauds.com Category:2010 3D films Category:Amusement park films Category:Animated films based on Marvel Comics Category:Animated short films based on comics Category:2010s animated superhero films Category:4D films Category:Short films based on Marvel Comics Category:3D animated short films ",
