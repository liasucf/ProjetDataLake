    "text": "Manica rubida is a species of ant in the subfamily Myrmicinae.ITIS ==Distribution== This species is present in Central and Southern Europe, in the Near East and in Georgia.AntwebDeutsche AmeisenschutzwarteFauna europaea ==Habitat== These ants prefer sunny mountain areas with poor vegetation, but can also be found in montane forests, at an elevation of above sea level. ==Description== A nest of Manica rubida Manica rubida can reach a length of in workers, of in queens, of in males. Workers are reddish brown, slender, usually with a darker head. Thorax and abdomen are very shiny and the abdomen is darker at the rear end. Queens are similar to workers, usually they have a slightly darker color than the worker, but often they are totally dark. Males are black and glossy. Queens and workers have a venomous sting and their stings are very painful, but not dangerous. ==Biology== These ants feed on insects and honeydew. They are a little aggressive, but they defend only their immediate nesting area. Usually they build their nests under stones, but nests can also occur in the soil. These nests often can reach up to 3 meters depth. Around the large opening of their nests they may deposit sand and earth to form a wide flat crater. Colonies are often polygynous and can reach the size of several hundred workers. Swarming occurs from late May to the early September. Hibernation occurs from October to March. ==Bibliography== *Attygalle, A.B., Cammaerts, M.-C., Cammaerts, R., Morgan, E.D., and Ollett, D.G. 1986b.
