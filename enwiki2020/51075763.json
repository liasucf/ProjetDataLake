The British Royal Navy captured her on 6 April 1800 and took her into service as HMS Florentina. She served in the Mediterranean until she returned to Britain in 1802 after the Treaty of Amiens. There the Admiralty had her laid-up in ordinary and she was sold in 1803. ==Spanish Navy service== Santa Florentina was commissioned in March 1787 under the flag of CdE Francisco de Borja, and sailed to Cadiz for trials. In November 1787 she was under CdF Jos\u00e9 Zurita, ferrying troops from Barcelona to Palma de Mallorca, where she arrived on 10 January 1788. In 1789, under CfF Jos\u00e9 Ussel de Guimbarda, she transported Spanish consuls to Algeria and Tunisia, . ==Capture== In April 1800, was on blockade duty at Cadiz as part of a squadron under Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth and including the 74-gun ships and , and the fireship . On 5 April the squadron sighted a Spanish convoy comprising thirteen merchant vessels and three accompanying frigates, and at once gave chase. Leviathan and Emerald eventually opened fire on the rigging of two Spanish frigates in order to disable them; shortly afterward, both Spanish frigates surrendered. Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen (Carmen or Carmine), Captain Don Fraquin Porcel, of 36 guns, 140 men, and 950 tons (bm), was sailing from Cadiz to Lima with a cargo of 1500 quintals of mercury, sundries of \"Cards\", and four 24-pounder guns stored for foreign service. She was newly coppered and had provisions for a four month voyage. She carried as a passenger Don Pedro Ynsencio Bejarano, Archbishop of Buenos Aires. Before she surrendered Carmen had 11 men killed and 16 wounded. Florentina, Lieutenant Manuel Novales, of 34 guns, 114 men, and 950 tons (bm), had been traveling from Cadiz to Lima with 1500 quintals of mercury and sundry \"Cards\", and five 24-pounder guns. Before she surrendered she suffered 12 killed and 10 wounded, including Norates and her second captains. On 7 April, the British sailed for Gibraltar with their prizes. On arrival they encountered Incendiary, which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. In all, the small British squadron managed to capture nine merchant vessels and two frigates. The Royal Navy took both frigates into service. ==British Navy service== Commander John Broughton, late of , was appointed to \"the Florentia [sic] frigate, of 36 guns, now off Malta.\"Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.80. In December Florentina was in company with the sloop and the gunvessel . On 5 December they captured the French polacre Union, bound from Alexandria to France with a cargo of rice and coffee. Two days later, the same three vessels captured the French brig Bon Pasteur Retrouve on the same route with rice, coffee, and sugar. Six days after that, the same three vessels captured the French brig Heureuse Clairon and her cargo of rice and coffee. On 8 January 1801 captured the French bombard St. Roche, which was carrying wine, liqueurs, ironware, Delfth cloth, and various other merchandise, from Marseilles to Alexandria. , Tigre, , , Florentina, and the schooner , were in sight and shared in the proceeds of the capture. In March 1801 Florentina was at the British landing at Abu Qir Bay. She is not among the vessels listed as having suffered casualties in the landing, but for his services, Broughton received a gold medal from Ottoman Sultan Selim.Official Catalogue and Guide (1891), n\u00b0 2617, p.277. Because Florentina served in the Navy's Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \"Egypt\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants. Broughton received promotion to post-captain on 3 August 1801.Gentleman's Magazine (1837), p.651. ==Fate== Florentine [sic] arrived at Portsmouth on 28 May 1802 with dispatches from Malta. She sailed eastward on 11 June to be paid off.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 7, p.530. She arrived at Deptford on 17 June and was laid up. The Principle Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered \"Florentina, 943 Tons, Copper-bottomed, lying at Deptford\", for sale on 1 December 1802. She did not sell until 1803. ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations References * Category:1786 ships Category:Frigates of the Spanish Navy Category:Captured ships Category:Frigates of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built in Cartagena, Spain ",
