In 1970, he took the decision to leave Paris to free himself from any restraints and dedicate himself to his art. Since then, he has been creating his works of art in seclusion. Denis Schneider started exhibiting again in 1998. During that year, a Strasbourg gallery provided him an exclusive platform to display his paintings. As a result, his talent was discovered by Ineke Voorsteegh, former curator of the Department of Modern Art and Education in Dordrecht Museum and presently owner of the In-Vorm Gallery in Dordrecht \u2013Netherlands. She offered him the opportunity to join her newly opened gallery to which belonged several other selected artists like Mark Brusse, Rein Dool, Hanskop Jansen, Peter Royen, Gerard Verdijk, Albert Verkade and others. In 2001, Denis Schneider exhibited his paintings alongside Mark Brusse\u2019s sculptures at the In-Vorm Gallery. He has since been exhibiting regularly in that gallery \u2013 on his own or with other artists. In 2002 and 2003, Schneider exhibited his large scale paintings at the G\u00e9rard Philipe Theatre of St Denis. He was also responsible for illustrating the theatre\u2019s various publications and playbills, including the one for Strindberg\u2019s play \"Sonate des spectres\".
