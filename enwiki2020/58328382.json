Sarikula was a direct descendant of Sharif Kabungsuwan, the first sultan of Maguindanao. He was the son of Sultan Bangkaya with his Matampay wife. Sarikula also had half brothers, Dimasangcay Adel and Buisan, who also reigned as sultans of Maguindanao before and after him. Sarikula was involved in a power struggle with Buisan, which ended on him being ousted by his younger brother to Sulu in 1597. Sarikula married Raja Putri, one of the daughters (or a sister) of Sultan Muwallil Wasit (Rajah Bongsu) from the Sulu Sultanate. Their daughter Putri Mampey married her first cousin, Sultan Kudarat, the son of Buisan. == See also == * Sultanate of Maguindanao * Kapitan Laut Buisan == References == Category:Filipino datus, rajas and sultans Category:Filipino Muslims Category:People of Spanish colonial Philippines Category:Filipino nobility ",
