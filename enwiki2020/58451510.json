Some of these stories are famous for being included in school textbooks. ==Works== The stories in the Lotus Creek collection are primarily set during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Chinese Civil War. Below is a summary of some stories in the collection: \u201cThe Reed Marshes\u201d is about an old man who ferries supplies through a Japanese blockade to guerillas, ferries two young girls, one gets hit by a bullet and he takes out his revenge on a small group of Japanese soldiers \"Lotus Creek\" is about women who are left behind by their husbands who go off to fight. They try to follow their men to give them more supplies, but get chased by a Japanese ship, which is then ambushed by a squad including their husbands. \"A Hamlet Battle\" is, as is clear from the title, about resistance from a hamlet with the Chinese repelling a Japanese advance. It includes Chinese forces assisted by a local boy who knows his way around tunnels. The Chinese forces are victorious. \"Caiputai\" is about a Town where collaborators drive the price of grain high and buy goods cheap, but the people resist and steal a shipment of grain as part of the resistance In \"Parting advice\" a soldier gets leave from his leader to visit his family for one night. It is a touching reunion, but his father has died in the eight years he\u2019s been away and he has a child he has never met. In the morning his wife takes him by sled back to his battalion. \"Honor\": Yuansheng is told by Xiumei that a nationalist deserter is alone with a gun so they steal it and Yuansheng goes off to war where he is fighting for 10 years. First the Japanese and then the nationalists. He is married before he leaves to a good- for-nothing who doesn\u2019t want to wait for him. His wife gets in a fight with Xiumei and gets a divorce. Xiumei takes care of Yuansheng\u2019s parents. He finally comes back and it seems as if this is a match made in heaven. \"Haoerliang\": A doctor and nurse take their wounded up into the mountains where the village chairwoman helps them. They fear the Japanese but also the landlords. \"The Guide\" is about a courageous female guide and the resistance from a mountain village. == References == ==Further reading == * \"Sun Li and his Baiyangdian\" http://www.bestchinanews.com/History/10456.html Category:1913 births Category:2002 deaths Category:20th-century Chinese male writers Category:20th-century Chinese writers Category:Short story writers from Hebei Category:Chinese male short story writers Category:Republic of China short story writers Category:People's Republic of China short story writers Category:People from Hengshui ",
