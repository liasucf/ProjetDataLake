    "text": "Phillip Ray Cates,Some sources cite \"Phillips\", instead of Phillip; one used the middle initial \"E\", instead of \"R\" for \"Ray\". known as Phil Cates (January 6, 1947 - July 13, 2014), was a lobbyist, who also served as a Democrat from 1971 to 1979 in the Texas House of Representatives. He represented some 10 mostly sparsely populated counties in the Texas Panhandle. ==Background== Cates was born in Pampa, the seat of government of Gray County, northeast of Amarillo, to Herman Ray Cates (1917-1998), a veteran of the United States Army Air Forces of World War II, and the former Lavern Robertson (1923-2009), a native of Beckham County, Oklahoma. He was reared in nearby Lefors, also in Gray County, where his parents are interred at Memorial Heights Cemetery. Cates left Lefors in 1965 to enroll at West Texas A&M; University in Canyon, then known as West Texas State University. There, he was elected four times to the Student Senate and was a member of the Baptist Student Union and Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. In 1998, West Texas A&M; named him a \"Distinguished Alumnus\". Cates married, in 1970, the former Nancy Holt (also born 1947), originally from Pampa. Their two sons are Andrew and John Cates. ==Career== In 1970, Cates was elected to succeed the two-term Republican Malouf Abraham, Sr., a wealthy businessman from Canadian in Hemphill County, whose District 84 was blended into revised District 79. Abraham instead ran unsuccessfully for the District 31 seat in the Texas State Senate against Democrat Max Sherman.Texas Almanac 1972/1973, Election returns from November 3, 1970 Cates won his own primary election in the spring by a margin of two votes. For his second term, Cates moved to Pampa in reconfigured District 66. Texas Monthly gave him unfavorable reviews in 1973; the publication called Cates part of \"the furniture\", a reference to those lawmakers who \"have no discernible ability to grasp what is going on, and who for that reason do not participate to any significant extent in the proceedings.\" By 1974, Cates was residing in Shamrock in Wheeler County for his third and fourth terms in the legislature. When he was moved to District 66 with the 1972 election, only Gray and Wheeler Counties were held over from his original District 79. After his four legislative terms, Cates became a lobbyist and worked in the capital city of Austin, first, with former Speaker Byron Tunnell from 1980 to 1989. He was a lobbyist for Tenneco of Houston for 9 years in 9 southeastern states. In Austin in 1989 and 1990, he was a lobbyist for the Texas Association of Business. In 1991, he joined the firm of former Speaker Bill W. Clayton, at which he remained until 1996, when he opened his own firm, Texas Stakeholders. He remained in that capacity until his death of lung cancer in 2014 at the age of 67. Cates, who had resided in Dripping Springs in Hays County near Austin, is interred at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, where graveside services were held on July 26, 2014, with his former legislative colleague Max Sherman among the speakers. ==References== Category:1947 births Category:2014 deaths Category:West Texas A&M; University alumni Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas Democrats Category:American lobbyists Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:People from Pampa, Texas Category:People from Shamrock, Texas Category:People from Austin, Texas Category:People from Dripping Springs, Texas Category:Baptists from Texas Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Texas Category:Burials at Texas State Cemetery Category:Military personnel from Texas ",
