At the age of eleven she made her debut at the Berlin Philharmonic Hall with Mozart's Piano Concerto KV 488. Her other teachers included Herbert Stessin, Lili Kraus, Claude Frank, Paul Badura- Skoda, Maria Tipo and Bruno Leonardo Gelber. Herbert von Karajan for whom she auditioned, invited her spontaneously to concerts with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra with conductors Klaus Tennstedt, Sir Colin Davis, Leopold Hager, Semyon Bychkov. Babette Hierholzer performed extensively in Europe, North and South America and Africa. Her artistic activities focused especially on the works of Robert and Clara Schumann. She played both: Clara Schumann's Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 7 and the lesser-known concerto movement in F Minor (1847). She published Clara Wieck's 'Quatre Polonaises pour le pianoforte' op. 1 for Ries & Erler, Berlin. In 1983, Ms. Hierholzer performed the soundtrack and double/stand-in role for Clara Schumann, played by Nastassja Kinski, in Peter Schamoni\u2019s Schumann movie 'Spring Symphony\u2019. In the early 1990s Hierholzer moved to the United States, where she continued her career. In addition to her solo commitments she founded the Duo Lontano together with pianist J\u00fcrgen Appell in 2004. The two artists can look back on years of successful concertizing on extended tours to Italy, Germany, Venezuela, Mexico, Russia, Poland, and the USA. Their engagements have included an invitation to Caracas, Venezuela, to perform Mozarts 'Concerto for two pianos and orchestra in E-flat-Major' with the Orquesta Juvenil Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar conducted by Gustavo Dudamel. In March 2016 Duo Lontano was invited to Havana, Cuba, to perform in addition to several four-hand piano recitals 'The Carnival of Animals' by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns for two pianos and orchestra with the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Nacional de Cuba under Enrique P\u00e9rez Mesa. Recent concert highlights have included appearances in W\u00fcrzburg (Germany), Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain), White Plains (USA), and Petr\u00f3polis (Brazil). In January 2019 they gave their debut in China.https://port-kreativ.nordanleger.de/sample- page/stralsund-new-york-xian Duo Lontano recorded for GENUIN Classics at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig (Germany).
