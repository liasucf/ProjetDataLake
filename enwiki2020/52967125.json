Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 24, 2019 == Reception == In the review on Allmusic, Ken Dryden noted \"These 2007 sessions by Kenny Barron are a bit unusual, as he works with several different groups, playing mostly originals\". On All About Jazz Mark F. Turner wrote \"The Traveler finds Barron once again on the move\u2014a colorful palette of ten tracks with excellent sounds\u2014featuring a new rhythm section and some very special guests. From the start of the title track, Barron's still got the touch\u2014panache, grace, fire, and empathy. The result is a perfect portrait of his repertoire and depth ... fine recording by one of jazz's most respected pianists\".Turner, M. F. All About Jazz Review, August 19, 2008 In JazzTimes Mike Joyce observed \"A rather unlikely group of musicians tag along with Kenny Barron on The Traveler, making the pianist\u2019s latest studio excursion all the more colorful and, at times, intriguing\".Joyce, M.
