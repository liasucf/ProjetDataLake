    "text": "Late church cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach refers to sacred cantatas he composed after his fourth cycle of 1728\u201329. Whether Bach still composed a full cantata cycle in the last 20 years of his life is not known, but the extant cantatas of this period written for occasions of the liturgical year are sometimes referred to as his fifth cycle, as, according to his obituary, he would have written five such cycles \u2013 inasmuch as such cantatas were not late additions to earlier cycles (e.g. chorale cantatas added to the chorale cantata cycle), or were adopted in his oratorios. Other cantatas of this period were written for special occasions such as the 200th anniversary of the Augsburg Confession in June 1730, funerals and weddings. Obviously some of the information and compositions of this period of writing and performing of cantatas are missing, leading to different ways of presenting and connecting what is known about them by Bach-scholars. For instance, in the 19th century Spitta considered almost all of Bach's chorale cantatas as late cantatas,Philipp Spitta, translated by Clara Bell and J.A. Fuller Maitland. Book V: The Final Period of Bach's Life and Work, ChapterIII: \"The later Chorale Cantatas\" pp. 64\u2013108 in Johann Sebastian Bach: His Work and Influence on the Music of Germany, 1685\u20131750 Volume 3. Novello & Co. 1884\u20131885. while later research connected the large majority of them to the composer's second year in Leipzig (1724\u201325). \"Introduction\", pp. 29\u201345 ==Occasions of the liturgical year== Several groups can be discerned in Bach's cantata production after the Picander cycle: * Chorale cantatas (see also Chorale cantata cycle \u00a7 Chorale cantatas composed after Trinity 1725): ** filling gaps in the chorale cantata cycle (the first two actually composed between the second and the 4th cycle): *** BWV 137 (1725) *** BWV 129 (1726) *** BWV 112 (1731) *** BWV 140 (1731) *** BWV 177 (1732) *** BWV 14 (1735) *** BWV 9 (1732\u201335) ** Cantatas for unknown occasions, probably for a wedding at first, possibly later reused for an occasion in the liturgical year, uncertain to which cycle they may have ultimately belonged: *** BWV 117 (1728\u201331) *** BWV 192 (1730) *** BWV 97 (1734) *** BWV 100 (1734\u201335) * Possible later additions to the third cycle: ** BWV 51 (1730) ** BWV 30 (1738) * Reuse of earlier material that else would only have received a single performance (or no performance at all): ** BWV 157 (Purification): originally a funeral cantata (6 February 1727) ** BWV 36 (First Sunday of Advent 1726\u201331): parody of BWV 36c (secular cantata, 1725) ** BWV 248 VI a (Michaelmas 1734?): after first movement of BWV 1160 (secular cantata, 25 August 1731).Bach Digital Works and ** BWV 30 (Feast of St. John the Baptist 1738): parody of the BWV 30a (secular cantata, 1737) ** BWV 191 (Christmas 1745?): based on the otherwise probably unperformed Gloria of the Mass for the Dresden court, BWV 232 I (1733) Bach's three extant oratorios also date from this period: the Christmas Oratorio (a set of six cantatas presented in the Christmas season of 1734\u201335), the Ascension Oratorio (1735, with the dimensions of a single cantata) and the Easter Oratorio (an Easter cantata of 1725 with slight alterations reworked into an Oratorio 1738). Several earlier church cantatas were restaged after the period of the Picander cycle, some of them in a new version. Bach had several students who produced church cantatas during their Leipzig formation years: * Carl Philipp Emanuel and Doles provided settings of librettos from the Picander cycle of 1728\u201329BDW at Bach Digital websiteDaniel R.

The final version of Schwingt freudig euch empor, BWV 36 was first presented on the first Sunday of Advent , with an earlier version of the cantata dated between 1725 and 1730.BDW and at Bach Digital website ===Christmas to Epiphany=== From Christmas 1734 to Epiphany 1735 Bach presented six cantatas, together known as the Christmas Oratorio (Weihnachts-Oratorium): * Christmas 25 December 1734: Jauchzet, frohlocket, auf, preiset die Tage, BWV 248I * Second day of Christmas 26 December 1734: Und es waren Hirten in derselben Gegend, BWV 248II * Third day of Christmas 27 December 1734: Herrscher des Himmels, erh\u00f6re das Lallen, BWV 248III * New Year 1 January 1735: Fallt mit Danken, fallt mit Loben, BWV 248IV * Sunday after New Year 2 January 1735: Ehre sei dir, Gott, gesungen, BWV 248V * Epiphany 6 January 1735: Herr, wenn die stolzen Feinde schnauben, BWV 248VI The D Major version of Bach's Magnificat may have been performed on Christmas from 1733 onwards. Other Christmas compositions with text in Latin are the Sanctus in D major, BWV 238 (repeat performance in 1735 or later) and the cantata Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191 (probably first performed in 1745), a composition based on the Kyrie\u2013Gloria mass of 1733 that would be expanded into his Mass in B Minor. The period after the fourth cantata cycle also saw repeat performances of his earlier Christmas cantatas Unser Mund sei voll Lachens, BWV 110, and Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ, BWV 91, the last one in a new version produced after 1740.D-B Mus. ms. Bach P 869 at Bach Digital website Another Christmas cantata, Uns ist ein Kind geboren, BWV 142, was probably not composed by Bach and likely originated before Bach's time in Leipzig.Classical Net Uns ist ein Kind geboren (Unto us a child is born), Classical Net, 1998 A new version of Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid, BWV 58, was performed on the Sunday after New Year or .BDW at Bach Digital website This cantata was however added to chorale cantata cycle,Alfred D\u00f6rffel. Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe Volume 27: Thematisches Verzeichniss der Kirchencantaten No. 1\u2013120. Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel, 1878. Introduction, pp. V\u2013IX even while not completely conforming to the chorale cantata format and in its first version performed on , a year after the bulk of that cycle had been composed.BDW at Bach Digital website ===Between Epiphany and Lent=== Gedenke, Herr, wie es uns gehet, BWV 217, a cantata for the first Sunday after Epiphany was probably not composed by Bach. Johann Christoph Altnickol has been named as its possible composer. Herr, wie du willt, so schicks mit mir, BWV 73, the cantata for the third Sunday after Epiphany of the first cycle, was restaged at least two times between 1731 and 1750. W\u00e4r Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit, BWV 14, first performed on the fourth Sunday after Epiphany , latest of Bach's extant chorale cantatas, was added to the chorale cantata cycle. There are no extant cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach for the fifth and sixth Sunday after Epiphany. The first version of Ich habe genug, BWV 82, had been performed on the Feast of Purification .BDW at Bach Digital website This version for soprano, flute, strings and continuo in E minor is associated with Bach's third cantata cycle, or alternatively the period \"between the third and the fourth cycles\".Tatiana Shabalina \"Recent Discoveries in St Petersburg and their Meaning for the Understanding of Bach\u2019s Cantatas\" pp. 77-99 in Understanding Bach 4, 2009 After 1729 Bach produced three further versions of this cantata: a version in C Minor for bass, oboe, strings and continuo, for performance in 1731, a third version for Bass or mezzo and a fourth version with an additional oboe da caccia.BDW , and at Bach Digital website Komm, du s\u00fc\u00dfe Todesstunde, BWV 161 is a Weimar cantata for the 16th Sunday after Trinity.BDW at Bach Digital website In the mid-1730s Bach had its score copied, adding \"item Festo Purific Mariae\" (also for the Feast of Purification) to the header of the manuscript.D-B Mus. ms. Bach P 124 at Bach Digital website Also Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin, BWV 125, the chorale cantata from 1725, was probably restaged after 1735.BDW at Bach Digital website Ich lasse dich nicht, du segnest mich denn, BWV 157 was a funeral cantata in 1727: later it was transformed into a cantata for Purification, a feast that always fell between Epiphany and Lent.BDW at Bach Digital website For Septuagesima (third Sunday before Lent) 1727 Bach had composed Ich bin vergn\u00fcgt mit meinem Gl\u00fccke, BWV 84, a cantata on a libretto that two years later appeared in a very different form in a libretto cycle published by Picander. The 1727 cantata is however rather associated with Bach's third cantata cycle than with his fourth cantata cycle, which were settings of the librettos Picander had published for church services in 1728\u201329. pp. 36\u201341 However, a few years later Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, still living with his father in Leipzig, set the three first movements of the 1729 version of Picander's libretto for Septuagesima, Ich bin vergn\u00fcgt mit meinem Stande. Bach restaged his first cycle Sexagesima cantata Leichtgesinnte Flattergeister, BWV 181, around 1743\u201346.BDW at Bach Digital website In the period from 1728 to 1731 Bach produced the final C minor version of his Weimar Estomihi cantata Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn, BWV 23, in four movements.BDW at Bach Digital website ===From Lent to Trinity=== In Lent only two occasions allowed for concerted music: * Annunciation (25 March, moved forward to Palm Sunday if that date fell in Good Week) \u2013 no known performance of an Annunciation cantata by Bach after 1728. * Good Friday, on which day a Passion was performed. The only new Passion Bach appears to have composed after 1729 is his (lost) St Mark Passion, BWV 247, staged on Good Friday 1731 and 1744. Bach's Passion settings are however not seen as cantatas. Der Himmel lacht! Die Erde jubilieret, BWV 31 was an Easter cantata Bach had composed in Weimar. He had already restaged it during his first year in Leipzig, and did so again on Easter . Apart from that he expanded his Easter cantata from 1725, Kommt, eilet und laufet, BWV 249 into an oratorio (several versions), and restaged it multiple times in the last 20 years of his office as Thomaskantor. For Easter Monday, Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden, BWV 6, and Erfreut euch, ihr Herzen, BWV 66, belonging to the second and the first cantata cycle respectively, were both restaged more than once after 1729. Der Friede sei mit dir, BWV 158 is a possibly incomplete Easter Tuesday cantata. Its second and third movement (from a total of only four movements) seem to be derived from an earlier Purification cantata.BDW at Bach Digital website It may have been performed as Easter Tuesday cantata of the second cycle (no other cantata for that occasion in 1725 extant) and/or shortly after the 4th cycle. Another Easter Tuesday cantata, Ein Herz, das seinen Jesum lebend wei\u00df, BWV 134, belonging to the first cycle, was restaged , and probably also . Am Abend aber desselbigen Sabbats, BWV 42, a cantata from the second cycle for the first Sunday after Easter (Quasimodogeniti), was restaged . Der Herr ist mein getreuer Hirt, BWV 112, premiered on the second Sunday after Easter (Misericordias Domini) , is a late addition to the chorale cantata cycle. Ihr werdet weinen und heulen, BWV 103, a cantata for the third Sunday after Easter (Jubilate) on a libretto, was probably restaged .BDW at Bach Digital website For the next two Sundays (Cantate and Rogate) it is not known which cantatas Bach may have performed in the last 20 years of his life. The Ascension Oratorio, Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen, BWV 11, was first performed on .BDW at Bach Digital website For the Sunday after Ascension (Exaudi) it is not known which cantatas Bach may have performed after the second cycle (1725). The third version of Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! BWV 172, a Weimar cantata, was first performed on Pentecost (second Leipzig version). The libretto for the Pentecost cantata of the 1728\u201329 Picander cycle, Raset und brauset ihr hefftigen Winde was set by Johann Friedrich Doles, then a student of Bach, in 1740. The cantata was possibly performed in Leipzig at the time. Erh\u00f6htes Fleisch und Blut, BWV 173, a cantata for Pentecost Monday composed between the third and the fourth cycles, and Erw\u00fcnschtes Freudenlicht, BWV 184, a first cycle cantata for Pentecost Tuesday, were restaged 14 and respectively. The incomplete cantata Nun danket alle Gott, BWV 192, possibly a Trinity Sunday chorale cantata premiered , was probably not composed for Leipzig.BDW at Bach Digital website Whether it can be associated with any cycle is unclear. An earlier Trinity Sunday cantata, H\u00f6chsterw\u00fcnschtes Freudenfest, BWV 192, had already seen three different versions before its second version (1724) was given a repeat performance on .BDW , and at Bach Digital website ===Between Trinity and Advent=== It is not known which cantatas Bach may have performed on the first, second and third Sundays after Trinity in the last 20 years of his life. Freue dich, erl\u00f6ste Schar, BWV 30 was first performed on the Feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, . It was a parody of the secular cantata BWV 30a, premiered in 1737. Picander probably wrote the librettos, as well for the original composition as for the parody.BDW and at Bach Digital website Durch die herzliche Barmherzigkeit is a cantata for St. John's Day composed by Johann Gottlieb Goldberg for which Bach helped copy out performance parts around 1745\u201346.BDW at Bach Digital website Lobt ihn mit Herz und Munde, BWV 220 is a St. John's Day cantata by an unknown composer.BDW at Bach Digital website Its oldest manuscript went lost but existed before 1761.Verschollen BWV 220 (1), Breitkopf at Bach Digital website Meine Seele r\u00fchmt und preist, BWV 189 is a cantata for Visitation (2 July), using a German paraphrase of the Magnificat as text. It is dated to before 1761, based on what remains from its 18th-century sources. Likely it was however composed by Melchior Hoffmann, in 1715 at the latest.D-LEsta 21081/7372 Nr. 7 and BDW at Bach Digital website Around 1733 Bach produced the D Major version of his Magnificat, which he possibly performed on Visitation .D-B Mus. ms.

Was frag ich nach der Welt, BWV 94, a chorale cantata for the ninth Sunday after Trinity, first performed in Bach's second year in Leipzig, was probably restaged around 1732\u201335.BDW at Bach Digital website Tue Rechnung! Donnerwort, BWV 168, a 1725 cantata for the same occasion, was possibly restaged after 1745.BDW at Bach Digital website For the tenth to thirteenth Sundays after Trinity it is not known which cantatas may have been performed in Leipzig after 1729. The chorale cantata for the 14th Sunday after Trinity Jesu, der du meine Seele, BWV 78, first performed in 1724, was restaged after 1735.BDW at Bach Digital website Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen, BWV 51, first performed on the 15th Sunday after Trinity , was designated for that Sunday or for any occasion.BDW at Bach Digital website Komm, du s\u00fc\u00dfe Todesstunde, BWV 161, a cantata for the 16th Sunday after Trinity or Purification, also exists in a later (Leipzig?) version, which was however probably not produced by the composer.BDW at Bach Digital website For the 16th Sunday after trinity Bach produced a second version in D major of the chorale cantata Liebster Gott, wenn werd ich sterben? BWV 8\\. Its first version, in E major, had been premiered in 1724.BDW and at Bach Digital website No performances of a cantata for the 17th Sunday after Trinity have been identified in Bach's last 20 years in Leipzig. The chorale cantata Herr Gott, dich loben alle wir, BWV 130, for Michaelmas, premiered in 1724, was restaged in a modified version around 1732\u201335.CH-CObodmer Ms.11625 and BDW / at Bach Digital website (also indicated as BWV 248a) is a fragment of a nameless (Michaelmas cantata), likely first performed in 1734, shortly before its music was almost entirely adopted in the last part of the Christmas Oratorio ()D-B Mus.ms. Bach St 112 VI, Fascicle 1 at Bach Digital website Michaelmas has also been suggested for (the cantata fragment?) Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft, BWV 50, which has however an unclear origin.BDW at Bach Digital website Herr Christ, der einge Gottessohn, BWV 96, a chorale cantata for the 18th Sunday after Trinity, first performed in 1724, was given a repeat performance with a modified orchestration on . The cantata was further restaged around 1746\u201347.BDW at Bach Digital website Bach's final version of the Reformation Day cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott, BWV 80 may have originated around 1735.D\u00fcrr/Jones o.c., p. 709 An earlier Leipzig version of the cantata, BWV 80b, was written 1727\u201331.F-Ppo A.

A modified version of the 1724 chorale cantata Wohl dem, der sich auf seinen Gott, BWV 139 for the 23rd Sunday after Trinity was presented around 1744\u201347.BDW at Bach Digital website No further cantatas performed on Sundays after Trinity are known for the period 1730\u201349, until the 27th and last possible Sunday after Trinity: on that Sunday in 1731 Bach premiered Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140, a late addition to the chorale cantata cycle.BDW at Bach Digital website ==Other occasions== ===New council=== The election or inauguration of a new town council was celebrated with a service. Normally this was an annual event. The cantata written for such celebrations were indicated with the term \"Ratswechsel\" (changing of the council) or \"Ratswahl\" (election of the council). In Leipzig the service was held at the Nikolaikirche on the Monday following Bartholomew (Bartholom\u00e4us), 24 August. Bach's Leipzig Ratswahl cantatas include: * Before 1730: ** Preise, Jerusalem, den Herrn, BWV 119, 30 August 1723 ** W\u00fcnschet Jerusalem Gl\u00fcck, BWV Anh. 4, 27 August 1725 (only Picander's text extant) ** Ihr Tore zu Zion, BWV 193 (incomplete), 25 August 1727Work at Bach Digital website * Bach's last 20 years in Leipzig ** Gott, gib dein Gerichte dem K\u00f6nige, BWV 1140 (formerly ), 28 August 1730 (only Picander's text extant)Work at Bach Digital website. ** Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir, BWV 29, 27 August 1731 (reused 31 August 1739 and 24 August 1749) ** (BWV 137, chorale cantata for Trinity XII: \"A performance on 25.8.1732 (Spitta II, p. 286f. and others) on the occasion of inauguration of the new city council is not proved.\")Work at Bach Digital website ** Herrscher des Himmels, K\u00f6nig der Ehren, BWV Anh. 193, 28 August 1740 (only text extant) ** Gott, man lobet dich in der Stille, BWV 120, 29 August 1742 ** Lobe den Herrn, meine Seele, BWV 69, 1743\u201348 (adapted from BWV 69a) ===200th anniversary of the Augsburg Confession=== 25 June 1730 was 200 years after the Augsburg Confession. In Leipzig the occasion was remembered by a three-day festival. Picander wrote three cantata librettos (later published in Ernst-Schertzhaffte und Satyrische Gedichte, Vol. III, 1732), one for each day of the celebration. Johann Sebastian Bach set these librettos. The music of these settings is however largely lost:Picander (=Christian Friedrich Henrici). Ernst-Schertzhaffte und Satyrische Gedichte, Volume III. Leipzig: Joh. Theod. Boetii Tochter (1732; 2nd printing 1737), pp. 73\u201379New Bach Edition (B\u00e4renreiter).

Apart from church cantatas for weddings Bach also composed secular wedding cantatas such as BWV 202 and 210. ===Funeral=== Funeral music of Bach's Leipzig period includes: * On , at the funeral of J. C. von Ponickau in Pom\u00dfen, a cantata in two parts was presented: ** Part I: Ich lasse dich nicht, du segnest mich denn, BWV 157, later reused as a cantata for Purification, see above. ** Part II: Liebster Gott, vergisst du mich, BWV Anh. 209, a lost cantata, composed on a 1711 libretto for the seventh Sunday after Trinity by G. C. Lehms. The cantata may have been composed in the Weimar period, or in the period between the second and the fourth cycle (possibly even as a Trinity XV cantata).BWV2a, p. 456BDW at Bach Digital websiteChristine Blanken. \"A Cantata-Text Cycle of 1728 from Nuremberg: a Preliminary Report on a Discovery relating to J. S. Bach's so-called 'Third Annual Cantata Cycle'\", pp. 9\u201330 in Understanding Bach, Vol. 10, 2015. * Klagt, Kinder, klagt es aller Welt, BWV 244a, , memorial service for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-K\u00f6then (the lost music of this cantata is related to the St Matthew Passion) * Schlie\u00dft die Gruft! ihr Trauerglocken, BWV Anh. 16 (1735, music lost)BDW at Bach Digital website * Mein Gott, nimm die gerechte Seele, BWV Anh. 17 (music lost)BDW at Bach Digital website Apart from church cantatas for funerals, Bach also composed secular mourning music (Trauer-Ode, BWV 198, ) and several funeral motets (e.g. O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118, 1736\u201337). ==Reception== Most of the cantatas of Bach's last 20 years in Leipzig probably went to Halle with Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, where most of it went lost. Extant parts of Bach's late cantata production include: * Late additions to the chorale cantata cycle: this cycle remained in Leipzig. Considering almost all chorale cantatas as late compositions, Spitta discussed them extensively in his 19th-century Bach-biography. * (Cantatas transformed into) oratorios: these were conserved in Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's legacy. * Revised versions of cantatas composed for earlier cantata cycles. * Cantatas composed for occasions outside the liturgical calendar (e.g. sacred cantatas for weddings), cantatas largely consisting of re-used material originally not composed for occasions of the liturgical calendar (e.g. BWV 191), and arrangements of compositions by others (e.g. BWV 200). * Cantatas composed by students in the period they were tutored by Bach. Whether there ever was a consistent fifth cycle of cantatas composed by Bach in the last twenty years of his life remains a matter of speculation: evidence of such cycle is remote and circumstantial, but it is a returning topic in scholarly literature. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Bach cantatas by period of composition Category:1730s in music Category:1740s in music ",
