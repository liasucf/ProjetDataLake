    "text": "\"Human Nature\" is a 1991 song performed by English singer and record producer Gary Clail. It is produced by Adrian Sherwood and features Lana Pellay on backing vocals. The song was released as the first single from his second album, Emotional Hooligan. The song peaked at number 10 in the UK. It was also the theme tune to BBC 2's TV-show \"Snub\". It was originally intended to use a sample of a speech by Billy Graham on the track, however his representatives refused permission, so the song used portions of the speech re-recorded by Clail. However some promo 12\" singles featuring the Billy Graham sample were pressed and distributed. ==Critical reception== Music & Media called it an \"outstanding\" song from the Emotional Hooligan album. Music Week said it's a \"bassily chugging angry roller\". James Brown from NME described it as \"another electrifying club track that brings the old On-U Sound up to date and bullies the social conscience with its words. Boxheads will recognize its staple technique as being the Snub signature tune, but of course there's more. Comic strip-per Lana Pellay adds a Bacchanalian chorus call, and Sherwood and Oakenfold do the business at the controls. Light, tight, and destined to beat up the charts. The man has presence.\" ==Chart performance== The single peaked at number 10 in the United Kingdom, number 27 in Ireland, and at number 69 in the Netherlands. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"Human Nature\" reached number 29 in April 1991. Outside Europe, it peaked at number 38 in Australia. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1991) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA Charts) | 38 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) | 29 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Ireland (IRMA) | 27 |- !scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Tipparade) | 16 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100) | 69 |- ! scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | 10 |- ! scope=\"row\"|UK Music Week Dance Singles | 3 |- |} ==References== Category:1991 singles Category:1991 songs Category:Perfecto Records singles Category:Electro songs Category:House music songs ",
