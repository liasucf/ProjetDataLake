    "text": "The RD-801 (Russian: ) is a Ukrainian liquid propellant rocket engine burning LOX and Kerosene (RG-1) in a staged combustion cycle. It has a single combustion chamber that provides thrust vector control by gimbaling of the nozzle in two axis by +/- 6\u00b0. It is being designed in Ukraine by Yuzhnoye Design Bureau for the prospective first stage propulsion of the Mayak rocket family. The RD-801 as well as the RD-810 are being designed based on the work of the RD-8 vernier and the maintenance and improvement of the RD-120 engines. The RD-801 can be used stand alone on a Mayak or in a cluster. ==Versions== The designers have proposed three versions of this engine: * RD-801 (version 0) (Russian: ): This is the basic module with no TVC. * RD-801 (version 01) (Russian: ): This is a version which includes a TVC by gimbaling of the nozzle in two axis by +/- 6\u00b0. * RD-801V (Russian: ): High altitude of the rocket engine with extended nozzle. ==See also== *Mayak \u2013 Prospective Ukrainian launch vehicle family for which the RD-801 is being developed. *RD-8 \u2013 The Zenit second stage vernier engine which was the technological base for the RD-801. *RD-120 \u2013 The Zenit second stage main engine which was the technological base for the RD-801 *RD-810 \u2013 A higher thrust engine of the same family. *Yuzhnoe Design Bureau \u2013 The RD-810 designer bureau. *Yuzhmash \u2013 A multi-product machine-building company that's closely related to Yuzhnoe and would manufacture the RD-RD-801. *YF-100 \u2013 A Chinese rocket engine of similar specifications based on RD-801 design. ==References== ==External links== * Yuzhnoye Design Bureau English-language home page Category:Rocket engines using kerosene propellant Category:Rocket engines using the staged combustion cycle Category:Yuzhnoye rocket engines Category:Yuzhmash rocket engines Category:Rocket engines of Ukraine ",
