The King James Version spells his name MahalaleelGenesis 5:12 in the Old Testament and MaleleelLuke 3:37 in the New Testament. == Family == In the Bible, Mahalalel is an ancestor of Noah, and thus, of all humanity. He appears in the Book of Genesis 5:12-17, and according to the book, he lived 895 years, placing him eighth in the records for the unusually long lifespans for the antediluvian patriarchs. Mahalalel was a son of Kenan, son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam in the Old Testament of the Bible. He was also the father of Jared. Later references to Mahalalel include 1 Chronicles 1:2, Jubilees 4:14\u201315 and Gospel of Luke 3:37. Enoch's first dream vision in 1 Enoch 83 recounts the dream that Enoch had in the house of Mahalalel his grandfather, and which Mahalalel explains to him.See the translation by R. H. Charles (1917) at sacred- texts.com Additionally, Mahalalel is also mentioned in Islam in the various collections of tales of the pre-Islamic prophets, which mentions him in an identical manner. ==Allusions== The pet cat that comes to the manor in the storm in Joyce Carol Oates's novel Bellefleur is named Mahalaleel. Thomas Hardy, in his novel, The Return of the Native, referenced Mahalaleel as one who betokened an advanced lifetime: \"The number of their years may have adequately summed up Jared, Mahalaleel, and the rest of the antediluvians, but the age of a modern man is to be measured by the intensity of his history.\" (London: Folio Society) (1971 [1880] at p. 150. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Torah people Category:Bereshit (parsha) ",
