In these countries, the terms \"cold meats\", \"cooked meats\", \"deli meats\", or \"sliced meats\" are used. === Latin America === In Guatemala, a lunch meat is a traditional dish eaten in November. It is eaten the first and second day of the month to celebrate El d\u00eda de Todos los Santos (All Saints' Day) and El d\u00eda de Todos los Difuntos (All Souls' Day). The two types are red and white. In Brazil, lunch meats and treats include olives, spam and mozzarella cheese. === Central Europe === Canned lunch meat came under investigation in Central Europe after an investigation into the Tulip Food Company, a Danish food processing company known worldwide for their specialization in canned meat. The investigation concluded that Tulip Food Company products do not contain 70% meat as expected (based on country standard). Rather, their products contained 18% pork meat, 39% mechanically separated chicken meat, and 18% mechanically separated pork meat. == Health == Most pre-sliced lunch meats are higher in fat, nitrates, and sodium than those that are sliced to order, as a larger exposed surface requires stronger preservatives. As a result, processed meats may significantly contribute to incidence of heart disease and diabetes, even more so than red meat. A prospective study following 448,568 people across Europe, showed a positive association between processed meat consumption and mortality caused by cardiovascular disease and cancer. Similarly, a prospective study in the US following half a million people flagged a similar association between death and increased processed meat consumption. The World Cancer Research Fund International guidelines on cancer prevention recommend avoiding all processed meats. == Safety == The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that those over age 50 reheat lunch meats to \"steaming hot\" and use them within four days. == See also == *Smallgoods *Delicatessen *Charcuterie *List of dried foods *List of sandwiches *Dagwood sandwich == References == == External links == * Category:Dried meat Category:Meat Category:Sandwiches Category:World cuisine Category:Lunch Category:Types of food Category:Sliced foods ",
