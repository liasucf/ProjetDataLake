The most infamous of these episodes was . The episode made headlines worldwide when it caused 685 children to experience seizures and seizure-like symptoms caused by a repetitive flash of light. Although the offending sequence was caused by Pikachu's actions, the episode's featured Pok\u00e9mon, Porygon, has rarely been seen in future episodes, with appearances limited to one brief cameo appearance in the movie Pok\u00e9mon Heroes and in one scene-bumper later in season 1. Its evolutions Porygon2 and Porygon-Z have only appeared in a brief part of the opening sequence of Pok\u00e9mon the Movie: Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice. Several other episodes have been removed from broadcast in Japan due to contemporary disasters that resemble events in the program; the 2004 Ch\u016betsu earthquake, the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the 2014 Sinking of MV Sewol all have caused cancellations or indefinite or temporary postponements of episode broadcasts. In the United States, the September 11 attacks in 2001 as well as 2005's Hurricane Katrina led to the temporary removal of two episodes from syndication. On September 1, 2006, China banned the series from prime time broadcasting (from 17:00 to 20:00), as it did Western animated series such as The Simpsons, to protect its struggling animation studios. The ban was later extended by one hour. On August 18, 2016, the XYZ episode (Down to the Fiery Finish! in the English dub) faced criticism from fans when Ash lost the Kalos League against Alain. The fans specifically criticized the episode due to misleading trailers that suggested that Ash would win the battle and because Ash had lost all of the Pok\u00e9mon Leagues in past seasons. Fans also disliked the outcome because they believed Ash's Greninja had many advantages over Alain's Charizard, including the fact that water-type Pok\u00e9mon resist Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon attacks, and that the rare Bond Phenomenon Ash's Greninja was subject to was said to be far more powerful than a conventional Mega Evolution. Several animators of the series also expressed disappointment that Ash had lost. TV Tokyo's YouTube upload of the teaser of the next episode received an overwhelming number of dislikes as a result of the outcome. ==See also== * List of television programs based on video games ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== ; Media * \\- Displays the dubbing process done by Sarah Natochenny ==External links== * Official website * Pok\u00e9mon seasons * Pok\u00e9mon anime website at TV Tokyo * Pok\u00e9mon TV Anime at Pok\u00e9mon JP official website * Category:Pok\u00e9mon anime Category:1997 Japanese television series debuts Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Animated television series about children Category:Anime television series based on video games Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Fantasy anime and manga Category:Japanese children's animated action television series Category:Japanese children's animated adventure television series Category:Japanese children's animated comedy television series Category:Japanese children's animated fantasy television series Category:Netflix original anime Category:TV Tokyo original programming Category:Television articles with disputed naming style Category:Viz Media anime Category:Works based on Nintendo video games Category:Cryptozoological television series ",
