    "text": "A Grand Compounder was a degree candidate at the University of Oxford who paid extra for their degree; \u00a330 rather than \u00a37 for a B.A., and \u00a340 rather than \u00a314 for an M.A. Undergraduates with a certain high level of income were required to do this; in 1817 this level was a benefice rated in the Kings Books at \u00a340, or other income in excess of \u00a3300. The practice was abolished in 1857. In exchange for their money, at their graduation a grand compounder was able to process from his college to the convocation house (and back again!) with the Vice-Chancellor, wearing a scarlet gown. In earlier times a trumpeter walked in front blowing his instrument. At the University of Cambridge the income threshold for a compounder was \u00a326 13s 4d. ==References== Category:History of the University of Oxford Category:History of the University of Cambridge ",
