    "text": "Andrew Mangiapane (born April 4, 1996) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previous played with the Barrie Colts of Ontario Hockey League (OHL), and was selected by the Flames in the sixth round, 166th overall, of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. His surname has provided him with the nickname of \"Bread\u201d among Flames fans. ==Playing career== Mangiapane would go undrafted in the OHL Priority Draft after the 2012-13 Greater Toronto Hockey League season with Toronto Jr. Canadiens U-18 AAA where he scored 14 goals and 22 assists in 32 games, and subsequently signed with the Barrie Colts as a free agent. In his first year with the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s Barrie Colts, Mangiapane's outstanding play was rewarded when he was named to the 2013\u201314 OHL First All- Rookie Team. Despite Mangiapane's success, he would go unranked by NHL Central Scouting Bureau and go undrafted in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. During the 2014\u201315 season, Mangiapane reached 100 points, scoring 43 goals and 104 points in 68 games played. The following season, he was named an alternative captain for the Colts. On March 23, 2016, Mangiapane was signed to an entry-level contract by the Calgary Flames, the organization which drafted him in the sixth round, 166th overall, in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, Mangiapane was listed as the 85th ranked North American skater by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. After attending the Flames' training camp ahead of the 2017\u201318 season, Mangiapane was reassigned to the club's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Stockton Heat, to begin the 2017\u201318 season. Recalled by the Flames, he made his NHL debut on January 31, 2017, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks. He was reassigned to the Heat on January 15, 2018, after playing seven games with Calgary. Mangiapane began the 2018\u201319 season in the AHL for Stockton. On November 30, 2018, he was called up by Calgary after recording 14 points in 13 games with the Heat. Although he was reassigned to the AHL on December 16, he was recalled a few days later after the Flames' Michael Frol\u00edk was placed on injured reserve. On January 13, 2019, Mangiapane earned his first NHL point in a 7\u20131 win over the Arizona Coyotes, assisting on captain Mark Giordano's first-period goal. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
