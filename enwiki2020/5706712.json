The Gerbert series was developed for children between the ages of 3 to 7. Gerbert teaches children about kindness and friendship, making good choices, the importance of loving your neighbor and learning a valuable lesson in life. The Gerbert series was co-produced by HSH Educational Media and CBN in 1987. HSH Educational Media was owned by Brad Smith and his brother Chris Christian. Chris Christian and Brad Smith were the executive producers of all the Gerbert TV shows. The Gerbert TV show first aired on the CBN Cable Network (1981-1988), which later changed its name to CBN Family Channel (1988-1990) and then to the Family Channel (1990-1998). The Family Channel was sold to Disney in 2001 and eventually became Freeform. The first shows were taped in Virginia Beach, Virginia at the CBN studios and all other shows were taped in Irving, Texas, at the Studios at Las Colinas. Gerbert first aired in the mornings on the CBN Family Channel (now Freeform) from February 15, 1988, to December 25, 1991, and was also sold as a VHS series in Wal-Mart and Christian book stores. It has aired on Christian television stations and networks continuously since its 1988 debut. A secular version, without religious content, was seen on many PBS stations in the early 1990s. The series aired in the late 2000s on KidMango. The show aired reruns on the Smile network until the series was pulled off the air in 2019. ==Cast== ===Season 1=== *Milton Clarke - Miles (Episodes: Surprise Party, The Lost Coin, Things Are Looking Up, Hop To It, I'm All Right & Miles Get Married) *Chris Frederick - Gerbert's Father (Episode: Look Before You Leap) *Molly Goodrich - Miss Deegan (Episodes: Surprise Party, The Cat's Meow, Things Are Looking Up, Gerbert Saves His Money & Forgive and Forget) *Andy Holmes - Gerbert *David Norris - Stu (Episodes: Surprise Party, A Clean Sweep, Things Are Looking Up, Some Days Are Like That, Forgive and Forget, Gerbert Saves His Money & Miles Gets Married) *Sharon Round - Gerbert's Mother (Episodes: Surprise Party, A Clean Sweep, The Lost Coin, Things Are Looking Up, Some Days Are Like That & I'm All Right) * Chris Christian (Episodes: Things Are Looking Up (cameo - recording studio segment) & Some Days Are Like That) * Shawn Dennsteadt (Episode: Forever Friends - credited as a 'Special Thanks to') * Luke Garrett (Episodes: Things Are Looking Up (cameo - recording studio segment) & Forever Friends) (uncredited) ===Season 2=== *Brad Arrington - Mr. Kramer, the School Principal (Episodes: The Crush, Jealously & Listening Is Loving) *John Berry - Phil Alpha (Episodes: Broken Promises & Listening Is Loving) *C.
