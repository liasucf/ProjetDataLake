    "text": "Luxembourg competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Since the nation's official debut in 1900, Luxembourgish athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games throughout the modern era, with the exception of the sparsely attended 1904 and 1908 Summer Olympics, and the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles at the period of the worldwide Great Depression. Luxembourg Olympic and Sporting Committee selected a team of 10 athletes to compete in five sports at the Games. The nation's roster in Rio de Janeiro was also a replication to those sent to Athens 2004, but had an equal share between men and women with five each. Among the sports represented by the athletes, Luxembourg staged its Olympic comeback in track and field from a 12-year absence. The Luxembourg team featured six returning Olympians. Five of them competed at London 2012, with the exception of professional road cyclist Fr\u00e4nk Schleck, who staged an eight-year comeback to his third and final Olympic circuit in Rio de Janeiro before retiring from the sport. Other notable Luxembourgian athletes were swimmers Rapha\u00ebl Stacchiotti and Laurent Carnol, table tennis player and four- time Olympian Ni Xialian, and world no. 44 tennis player Gilles M\u00fcller, who led the team as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Luxembourg, however, failed to win its first Olympic medal, since the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, where middle-distance runner Josy Barthel took home the men's 1500 m title. ==Athletics== Luxembourgish athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event), signifying the nation's Olympic return to the sport for the first time since 2004: ;Track & road events {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font- size:95%\" !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Charles Grethen |align=left|Men's 800 m |1:48.93 |5 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Charline Mathias |align=left|Women's 800 m |2:09.30 |8 |colspan=4|Did not advance |} ==Cycling== ===Road=== Luxembourgish riders qualified for the following quota places in the men's and women's Olympic road race by virtue of their best individual ranking in the 2015 UCI World Tour (for men) and top 22 national finish in the 2016 UCI World Ranking (for women). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Fr\u00e4nk Schleck |align=left|Men's road race |6:13:36 |20 |-align=center |align=left|Chantal Hoffmann |align=left|Women's road race |colspan=2|Did not finish |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Christine Majerus |align=left|Women's road race |3:56:34 |18 |-align=center |align=left|Women's time trial |48:16.17 |22 |} ==Swimming== Luxembourgish swimmers have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following events (up to a maximum of 2 swimmers in each event at the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT), and potentially 1 at the Olympic Selection Time (OST)): {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Laurent Carnol |align=left|Men's 100 m breaststroke |1:00.88 |=27 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Men's 200 m breaststroke |2:11.94 |21 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left rowspan=3|Rapha\u00ebl Stacchiotti |align=left|Men's 100 m freestyle |50.79 |47 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Men's 200 m individual medley |2:00.21 |21 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Men's 400 m individual medley |4:20.37 |23 |colspan=2 |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Julie Meynen |align=left|Women's 50 m freestyle |25.12 |26 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Women's 100 m freestyle |55.09 |25 |colspan=4|Did not advance |} ==Table tennis== Luxembourg has entered one athlete into the table tennis competition at the Games.
