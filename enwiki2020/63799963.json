LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically. Local authorities have a duty to care for them, and must control the sites by owning or leasing them, or by having an agreement with the owners. The local authorities can apply local byelaws to manage and protect LNRs. As of April 2020, there are 65 LNRs in Hampshire, of which 28 are Sites of Special Scientific Interest, 15 are Ramsar sites, 15 are Special Areas of Conservation, 16 are Special Protection Areas and one is a National Nature Reserve and one is a Nature Conservation Review site. Two sites are managed by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust. ==Key== ===Other designations and wildlife trust management=== *HIWWT = Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust *NCR = Nature Conservation Review site *NNR = National Nature Reserve *Ramsar = Ramsar site, an internationally important wetland site *SAC = Special Area of Conservation *SM = Scheduled Monument *SPA = Special Protection Area *SSSI = Site of Special Scientific Interest ==Sites== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" !scope=\"col\" | Site !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Photograph !scope=\"col\" data-sort- type=\"number\"| Area !scope=\"col\" | Location !scope=\"col\" | Borough !scope=\"col\" | Other !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Map and details !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description |- ! scope=\"row\"|Anton Lakes |alt=Anton Lakes | | Andover |Test Valley | | Map Details |The River Anton rises in the site and flows through former watercress beds into the lakes, which were created by gravel extraction.
