In 2010 the club separates from Baloncesto Le\u00f3n and two years later joins the Primera Divisi\u00f3n (fifth tier). The club promoted to Liga EBA in its first attempt, in 2013, by winning the Primera Divisi\u00f3n group of Castile of Le\u00f3n and finishing as runner-up in the promotion playoffs. Since its debut in EBA, the club always qualified to the promotion playoffs to LEB Plata, but never achieved its target. In July 2016, after its third attempt, Agustinos Eras achieved a vacant berth to play in this league. For its first season as a professional club, \u00c1ngel Jare\u00f1o, former manager of Baloncesto Le\u00f3n, was appointed to be the head coach of the team. ==Sponsorship naming== *Agustinos Eras E.Leclerc 2013\u20132014 *Agustinos Leclerc 2014\u2013 ==Season by season== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center\" !Season !Tier !Division !Pos. ! |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2010\u201311 | 6 || align=left|S\u00e9nior Prov. | 2nd | 12\u20136 |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2011\u201312 | 6 || align=left|S\u00e9nior Prov. | 3rd | 13\u20137 |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2012\u201313 | 5 || align=left|1\u00aa Divisi\u00f3n | bgcolor=#BBF3BB|1st | 19\u20131 |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2013\u201314 | 4 || align=left|Liga EBA | | 18\u20137 |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2014\u201315 | 4 || align=left|Liga EBA | | 26\u20133 |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2015\u201316 | 4 || align=left|Liga EBA | | 19\u20136 |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2016\u201317 | 3 || align=left|LEB Plata | 11th | 13\u201317 |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2017\u201318 | 3 || align=left|LEB Plata | bgcolor=#FFBBBB|15th | 10\u201320 |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2018\u201319 | 4 | align=left|Liga EBA | bgcolor=#FFBBBB| | 1\u201325 |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2019\u201320 | 5 || align=left|1\u00aa Divisi\u00f3n | | |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Club website Category:Basketball teams in Castile and Le\u00f3n Category:Basketball teams established in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in Spain Category:Former Liga EBA teams Category:Former LEB Plata teams ",
