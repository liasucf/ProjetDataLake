Located west southwest of the city, it is the eleventh-busiest airport in Canada, with 1,670,880 passengers and 121,680 aircraft movements in 2017. More than 10 airlines offer 360 weekly flights to destinations across Canada, the United States, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Europe. ==Overview== Inside the airport terminal The airport was established in 1939, a year after the closure of the A\u00e9rodrome Saint-Louis. First established as a training facility for air observers, the first flight occurred on September 11, 1941. First known as the A\u00e9roport de l'Ancienne Lorette, then the A\u00e9roport de Sainte-Foy, and later the A\u00e9roport de Qu\u00e9bec, it was renamed to A\u00e9roport international Jean-Lesage in 1993, in honour of the former Premier of Quebec, Jean Lesage. The airport is managed and operated by A\u00e9roport de Qu\u00e9bec inc., a non-profit and non-share corporation. The current terminal building has a capacity of 1.4 million passengers annually. Beginning in 2006, with a budget of $65.8 million, Qu\u00e9bec/Jean Lesage International Airport underwent a modernization designed to increase the terminal's capacity and substantially enhance the level of passenger service. The modernization included a reconfiguration of the terminal on 2 levels, a restructuring of the baggage handling area and arrivals area, as well as a reconfiguration and enlargement of the waiting rooms. Fifty-four percent of the financing was provided directly by A\u00e9roport de Qu\u00e9bec inc. Completed in June 2008, the new configuration of the airport now enables it to handle 1.4 million passengers a year. Based on the passenger figures for 2009 and 2010, it became clear that the terminal building would reach its design capacity by 2012. A\u00e9roport de Qu\u00e9bec inc. is therefore planning further investments of nearly $300 million to further expand the terminal building. Presently the terminal has 17 gates: 12 contact gates and 5 walk-out aircraft positions. This number will increase to 24 gates by 2025.A\u00e9roport de Qu\u00e9bec Master Plan On July 4, 2011, work began on the second phase of the airport expansion, which lasted until 2017. Partially funded through an Airport Improvement Fee, the terminal building doubled the size, at a cost of $224.8 million. The work included an expansion of the international facilities, construction work on the runways, taxiways and de-icing pads, as well as enhancements to customer service facilities. On September 19, 2013, runway 12/30 was renamed to runway 11/29. The airport charges an Airport Improvement Fee (AIF) to each passenger, it is amongst the highest in Canada at $35 per passenger. In 2015 the airport was the 12th- busiest airport by total passengers and in 2014 it was the 14th-busiest by aircraft movements in Canada. On 10 March 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the addition of the airport to the list of Canadian airports containing U.S. border preclearance facilities. On December 11, 2017, the first phase of YQB2018, the expansion project, was completed with the opening of the new international terminal. The new facility features more dedicated baggage carousels serving international flights, new customs area, expanded food court and restaurant areas including banners such as Starbucks, Pidz and Nourc, four new gates (34 to 37), improved and larger loading area for cars and buses and a larger capacity baggage area. The last expansion phase was completed in summer of 2019 with the domestic and international terminals being linked all together. Also added as part of the most recent expansion are 10 holes in the security fence placed at positions determined jointly by the airport authority and a local plane spotting group. These holes are sized to allow photographers to insert telephoto lenses, and are specifically reserved for their use. In 2019, the American website Digital Photography Review called the airport \"the number one spot for aviation photographers\". ==Facilities== ===Infrastructure=== YQB International Airport receives a wide variety of long-, mid- and short-haul aircraft. The airport has two runways. Its longest runway northeast-southwesterly direction is 06/24, having a length of 2,743 meters (9,000 feet) long and 46 meters (150 feet) wide. Runway 24 is YQB's main approach pattern equipped with RNAV, RNP and NDB approach. Runway 06 has the same approaches with the addition of ILS and VOR/DME. There are six taxiways, Alpha (connecting the main apron with RWY24), Bravo (connecting the main apron with RWY29), Charlie, Delta (parallel to the 06/24), Echo (connecting the main apron with RWY24), Golf (which links Delta to RWY06 threshold) and Hotel (between Golf and RWY11/29) . The airport aprons can accommodate light to large aircraft (12 aerobridge and 9 remote) simultaneously and is designed to accommodate Wide-body jet airliners as large as the Boeing 747-400. YQB doesn't have a Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS) or Parallax Aircraft Parking Aid (PAPA), all stands are assisted by Ground Operations using marshalling wands\u2013handheld illuminated beacons. Ramp 3 is where all the Flight Schools and private airlines are located. Chrono Aviation, Skyjet/Air Liaison, Orizon Aviation, CFAQ, Strait Air and Avjet/TSAS are the main users of this apron. ===Runway and aprons=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+Runway at YQB |- ! class=\"text\" | RWY !! class=\"number\" | Length !! class=\"number\" | Width !!
