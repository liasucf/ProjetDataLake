UNU-IIST opened its door in 1992 with the blessing of the governments of Portugal, China and Macau, also the initial donors of the institute. As part of the United Nations, the institute was to address the pressing global problems of human survival, development and welfare by international co-operation, research and advanced training in software technology. ==Recent history during the 2000-2010 decade== UNU-IIST positions as both a university and an organ of United Nations. For nearly a generation, it has been committed to providing vital research on critical software systems while mentoring exceptional academics from around the developing world. As the world of information and communication technology (ICT) has changed immensely over the decades, it has defined a new mission along with a four-year strategic plan in 2010. The plan calls for UNU-IIST to embark on a more dramatic and focused response to the new computing environment and its potential to serve the cause of sustainable development (SD). Eventually, UNU decided to evolve the former IIST into a new Institute on Computing and Society (ICS). ==Administration== The current Director of UNU-CS is Dr. Jingbo Huang. ;Former directors * Prof. Michael Best (2015-2018) * Prof. Peter Haddawy (2010-2015) * Prof. Mike Reed (2005-2010) * Prof. Zhou Chaochen (1997-2002) * Prof. Dines Bjorner (1992-1997) ==Center for Electronic Governance== The Center for Electronic Governance at UNU-IIST is an International Center of Excellence on research and practice in Electronic Governance.
