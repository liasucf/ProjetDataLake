The district contains three high schools, four junior highs, four middle schools, eighteen elementary schools, and a school of innovation. Established in 1884, the district and its schools are accredited by AdvancED. It is the state's largest school district, with more than 23,000 students. The district is headquartered in the Old Springdale High School. ==History== ===Formation and early history=== 1923 Washington School Beginning with log cabin schools in the area established by early settlers, an educational partnership among schools coalesced into Springdale School District #50 on January 7, 1884. When high school curriculum became required in 1947, Springdale adopted many small surrounding districts that did not offer high school, such as Accident School in Accident. The last such school consolidated into Springdale was Tontitown Elementary, which was closed after the 1986-87 school year. ===Expansion, new high schools=== On the heels of rapid growth in Northwest Arkansas and Springdale in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Springdale had reached capacity in many of its existing schools. Land for a second high school was purchased in 2002 on the west side of Springdale. This property was developed into Har-Ber High School and Hellstern Middle School, both opened in 2005. Population growth continued and Springdale used 24 portable buildings to house an overflow of about 600 students for the 2005-06 school year as building continued. A \"super complex\" of four schools on nearby properties was proposed in the rapidly-growing southeast part of Springdale in 2006. In 2006, Har-Ber HS was projected to be at capacity by 2009. == Secondary education == Springdale School District provides education programs for students in grades six through twelve in eleven facilities: High Schools * Springdale High School\u2014serving students in grades 10\u201312. * Har-Ber High School\u2014serving students in grades 10\u201312. * Archer Learning Center\u2014serving students in grades 8\u201312. * Don Tyson School of Innovation\u2014serving students in grades 6\u201312.
