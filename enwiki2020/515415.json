It is the biggest and best known spa town in Slovakia and has around 28,000 inhabitants. ==Etymology== The name Pie\u0161\u0165any comes from Slovak Piesok (sand), referring to local sandbanks. The etymology is straightforward \u2013 Pie\u0161\u0165anci \u2013 people who live on the sandy site and Pie\u0161\u0165any \u2013 their settlement. ==History== Venus of Moravany The first human settlement in the area is dated to the prehistoric times, about 80,000 years ago. People were attracted to the site by abundance of game in the vicinity of the thermal springs that did not freeze in winter. A small female statue called Venus of Moravany was found in the nearby village Moravany nad V\u00e1hom. It is made of mammoth ivory and is dated to 22,800 BC. It currently resides in the Bratislava Castle museum. In another nearby village, Krakovany-Str\u00e1\u017ee, a treasure consisting of luxury items made of glass, bronze, silver, and gold was discovered in three graves from 200\u2013300 AD. The surroundings of Pie\u0161\u0165any also include the Great Moravian castle of Ducov\u00e9. Pie\u0161\u0165any was first mentioned in written records in 1113 (under the name Pescan). At that time it consisted of several smaller settlements. The medicinal springs were already popular in the Middle Ages. They were visited by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. The first book mentioning the Pie\u0161\u0165any springs was De admirandis Hungariae aquis hypomnemation (About the Miraculous Waters of the Hungarian Monarchy) by Georgius Wernher, published in 1549 in Basel. In the 16th century, the Pie\u0161\u0165any spa was also mentioned by two prominent physicians, Johann Crato de Crafheim (who served to several Holy Roman Emperors) and Andrea Baccius Elpidianus (a personal surgeon of the Pope). The first monography (Schediasma de Thermis Postheinsibus by J\u00e1n Justus Torko\u0161 was published in 1745. But in the 16th and 17th centuries, Pie\u0161\u0165any also suffered from Turkish raids and anti-Habsburg uprisings. Throughout the centuries Pie\u0161\u0165any was owned by several noble families; the last of them, the Erd\u0151dys, owned the area from 1720 to 1848, and the spa until 1940. The Erd\u0151dy family built the first spa buildings in 1778. They were damaged by a destructive flood in 1813. In 1820 the spa buildings were expanded and remodeled in neo-classical style and named Napoleon spa. The Erd\u0151dy family also established the Spa park in this period. In the years 1889 to 1940 the Winter family rented the spa from the Erd\u0151dys and brought it to international fame. The Winters improved spa treatment as well as accommodation and entertainment for visitors. They built several spa buildings and hotels. The spa attracted many aristocratic visitors, including Ludwig van Beethoven. In 1917, three monarchs (Wilhelm II of Germany, Karl I of Austria-Hungary, and Ferdinand I of Bulgaria) orchestrated their war strategy during the negotiations in the Thermia Palace hotel. In 1945 Pie\u0161\u0165any received the official status of a town. In 1959, S\u013a\u0148ava water reservoir was built south of the town. In the late 1960s and 1970s more spa buildings were built. In 1973 the village of Banka, located on the left bank of the V\u00e1h river, was amalgamated with Pie\u0161\u0165any, but it regained independence after a referendum in 1995. In 1996 the town became the seat of a district. The 1938 World Fencing Championships were held in Pie\u0161\u0165any. On January 4, 1987, at the final match in the World Junior Championships of ice hockey between Canada and the Soviet Union there was a bench-clearing brawl, now famously known as the Punch-up in Pie\u0161\u0165any. Both teams were disqualified from competition as a result. On July 5, 2001 three members of the Real Irish Republican Army were arrested in Pie\u0161\u0165any. They were lured into a trap by agents of the British Security Service MI5 who were posing as arms dealers from Iraq. The V\u00e1h river in Pie\u0161\u0165any ==Geography== Pie\u0161\u0165any is situated in the western part of Slovakia, in the valley of the V\u00e1h river, at an elevation of . The Pova\u017esk\u00fd Inovec mountains form the eastern boundary of this part of the V\u00e1h valley. The highest hill of these mountains, Inovec , is about north of the town. The hills immediately east of the town ( away) reach a height of about . On the western side, the valley boundary is formed by the Little Carpathians, which are somewhat lower and further away from the town. The valley is open to the south, and thus has a warm and sunny temperate climate. Most of the town is located on the right bank of the river. South of the town is the S\u013a\u0148ava water reservoir created by a dam on the V\u00e1h river. The artificial canal Biskupick\u00fd kan\u00e1l and the main river branch join in the town. Another short branch of the river (Obtokov\u00e9 rameno) creates the Spa Island. The hills of Pova\u017esk\u00fd Inovec are mostly covered with deciduous forests. These consist of oak and hornbeam in the lower elevations, and beech in the higher elevations. The V\u00e1h valley is used for agriculture.

The municipality operates a local public transport system with 11 bus routes (). ==Main sights== Because of frequent floods in the past, most buildings are dated to the 19th and 20th century. The most notable exception are the ruins of a medieval monastery from the 13th century. The Napoleon Spa is a complex of Neoclassicist spa buildings built between 1822 and 1862. The town\u2019s Catholic church dates from the same era.
