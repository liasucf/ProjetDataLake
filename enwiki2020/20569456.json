    "text": "Gibson guitars marketed a new hybrid in 1982. Developed with guitarist Chet Atkins and Kentucky luthier Hascal Haile, the Chet Atkins CEC (Cutaway Electric Classical) merged solid-body electric guitar with classical guitar, resulting in a nylon-string instrument that could be played at high volumes in large auditoriums without feedback. Classical guitarists have given the innovation little credence, but pop and rock music stars like Sting, Earl Klugh, Zappacosta, David Gilmour, Jack Johnson and Gipsy Kings have played it to millions of concert-goers. Gibson also manufactured a model called the Chet Atkins CE which had a smaller 1-7/8\" nut width. Gibson discontinued the CEC on January 1, 2006 Category:Electric guitars ",
