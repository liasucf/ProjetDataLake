Mainly a right-sided defender, Tavanti has also been utilised further forward on the right-hand side in a wide midfield role. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Tavanti began his career in the youth teams of Viareggio in Tuscany, near to where he was born. In July 2010, Serie A side Genoa took Tavanti on loan within their youth sector, as he was still only 15 years old. He spent a year in Liguria before being signed by Italian giants Juventus upon his return to Viareggio in 2011. ===Juventus=== Tavanti began playing for the Juventus youth teams, beginning in the under-17 team and making his way up to the under-19 team by 2014.

He was loaned to Santarcangelo in 2014, making 2 first team appearances before returning to Juventus at the beginning of February 2015.

In July 2015, Carrarese took Tavanti on a one-year loan, during which he made 16 appearances; 14 coming in the league and a further 2 in the Coppa Italia.
