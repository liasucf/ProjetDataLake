    "text": "Vittorio Santoro, New York, 2011 Vittorio Santoro (born 3 September 1962) is an Italian/Swiss visual artist living in Paris and Zurich. He is primarily known for his multimedia approach including installations, audio works, sculptures, works on paper, real-time activities and his artist books.Fourgeaud, Nicolas. 2010. Vittorio Santoro, La lenteur de l\u2019esprit. In: art21, Paris, Nr. 25, pp. 9-17, Paris. , PDF == Education == Essentially an autodidact, Santoro has attended the International Center of Photography (NYC) and the programs at Watermill Art Center with Robert Wilson (Long Island, NY). == Work == Plateau (Antim\u00e9ridien/Postm\u00e9ridien), 2016, Sculpture Santoro initially developed a literary practice in Italian (his parents emigrated from Sicily, Italy, to Switzerland before his birth.) In 1985, he published the collection of poems entitled La Voce e le Mani, Progetto per una poesia inumana (Lalli Editore, Poggibonsi). His work with the medium of language continues to this day and was even reinforced after meeting with artist Jenny Holzer in the early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, he increasingly turned to photography as a means of expression.Groos, Ulrike. 2006. Between \u201cMerely\u201d Seeing and \u201cAlready\u201d Reading. In: Vittorio Santoro, Everything\u2019s Not Lost, Revolver, pp. 31-34, Frankfurt a. Main. In close collaboration with the American writer Paul Bowles, he publishes The Time of Friendship / Ten Photographs (Memory/Cage Editions, Zurich, 1995). He then gradually expanded the spectrum of media towards sculpture, installation and video/film. Images, space, signs, sounds and language are intertwined in works such as F. Dostoyevsky: C. and P., Page 67 (Penguin Popular Classics), divided vertically, 2007/2011, Untitled (Mask), 2007, Monologism As Poetry, 2009, Reciprocal Scrutiny (bordereau), 2009, Gagarin, I-II, 2012, Good-bye Darkness, IV, 2010, and In/Voluntary Movement Diagram (Josef K.), 2014.Fl\u00fcckiger, Gabriel. 2014. Vittorio Santoro. In: Kunstbulletin, N\u00b05/14, p. 73, Zurich. His works are based in everyday observations, but go beyond them to show latent historical, aesthetic, sociopolitical, or even metaphysical realities. His characteristically intricate visual sensibility conceals a tension between the referential possibilities of objects and the choreographic nature of their placement in context. For each work Santoro chooses specific ways to manipulate conventions to desired effects believing that creativity is an ongoing process of continual change and reaction. In an artist statement for the installation Reciprocal Scrutiny (bordereau), 2009, shown at Galerie Xippas in Paris, the artist has stated: \u201cI like to think that the different elements of the work will serve as triggers and incite the viewer to form connections between the literary, political, historical and perceptual sources. And, furthermore, encourage a rigorous parlay between one\u2019s own subjectivity and an \u2018impassive\u2019 art object. This interplay between abstract data, geometric and linguistic forms, historical facts and fictional information can be negotiated and interpreted in any number of ways. I would enjoy that the piece would dilate like a web of associations, interferences and allusions. The center of the project space remains empty and my interest is to explore what, in this vacuum, might now be possible.\u201d Artist's statement, 2009, official website, PDF In 2017, it was nominated for the prestigious Prix Marcel Duchamp 2017. He proposes the installation Une porte doit \u00eatre ouverte ou non ferm\u00e9e, 2017, presented at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. It is a sort of initiation ritual itinerary in two parts; one at the museum the other disseminated through elements in the city. The viewer is invited to experience the piece in a quest for its relationship to the world and to itself. His work is represented by Counter Space, Zurich. ==Selected works== Gagarin I (Impenetrable Corner-108 Minutes A Day), 2012, Installation In-Voluntary Movement Diagram (Josef K.), 2013, Installation * Expire (Josef K.\u2019s Relation Diagram to 17 of the Characters in The Trial), 2019 \u2013 Wall sculpture *We Stare, We Talk\u2026October 2018\u2013March 2019, 2018-2019 \u2013 Time-based text work *Memories of a Bird, I-IV, 2017 \u2013 Sculptures * Beginning/Conclusion, 2016 \u2013 Sculpture * Plateau (Antim\u00e9ridien/Postm\u00e9ridien), 2016 \u2013 Sculpture * Giovanni Drogo\u2019s Surreal Delay (Pulsar CP19191), I-IV, 2016 \u2013 Photo work * Pulleys, I, 2016 \u2013 Installation * \u201eAvant\u201c se trouve apr\u00e8s \u201eapr\u00e8s\u201c, 2016 \u2013 Sculpture * Mirror of the Sea (Hangzhou I + II), 2015 \u2013 Sculpture * In/Voluntary Movement Diagram (Josef K.), 2014 \u2013 Installation * Untitled (Pier Paolo Pasolini), 2013-14 \u2013 Installation * A Game of Mental Chess (Raskolnikov/Porfiry Petrovich), 2013 \u2013 Sculpture * Une certaine id\u00e9e de l\u2019histoire de mon p\u00e8re, I-IV, 2013 \u2013 Installation * Whether It, 2012 \u2013 Neon- Installation * 00:00:1.20s, 2012 \u2013 Sculpture * Searching For...
