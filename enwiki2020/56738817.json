The tournament was held on 4 August 1924 in London, United Kingdom. == Events == After the successful first 1922 Women's World Games in Paris and the three Women's Olympiads (1921 Women's Olympiad, 1922 Women's Olympiad and 1923 Women's Olympiad) in Monaco the interest for women's sports also grew internationally. In 1922 the \"Women's Amateur Athletic Association\" (WAAA) was founded in the UK: the WAAA organised the first official British women championships in track and field (WAAA Championships) on 18 August 1923 at the Oxo Sports Ground in Downham outside London. In the US the \"Amateur Athletic Union\" (AAU) organised the first official American women championships in track and field on 29 September 1923 at Weequahic Park in Newark, New Jersey. The 1924 Women's Olympiad was organised in cooperation with the newspapers News of the World, Sporting Life and Daily Mirror in cooperation with the WAAA and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Sportive F\u00e9minine Internationale (FSFI) under chairwoman Alice Milliat. The games were attended by participants from 8 nations: Belgium, Canada (exhibition events only), Czechoslovakia, France, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the USA (exhibition events only). The tournament was a huge promotion for women's sports. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Team !Nation !Participants |- | 1 |align=left| | ? |- | 2 |align=left| | ? |- | 3 |align=left| | ? |- | 4 |align=left| | ? |- | 5 |align=left| | ? |- | 6 |align=left| | ? |- | 7 |align=left| | ? |- | 8 |align=left| | ? |} The athletes competed in 12 events: running (100 yards, 250 metres, 1000 metres, Relay race 4 x 110 yards and 4 x 220 yards and 120 yards, Racewalking 1000 metres, high jump, long jump, discus throw, shot put and javelin. The tournament also held exhibition events in cycling (two-thirds of a mile bicycle sprint), netball and gymnastics. The multi-sport event was held at \"Stamford Bridge\" in Fulham in southwest London. The games attended an audience of 25,000 spectators. == Results == Almost all medals went to athletes from France and the United Kingdom. During the games 7 world records were set: Mary Lines in hurdling 120 yd and running 250 m, Edith Trickey in running 1000 m, Albertine Regel in walking 1000 m, Elise van Truyen in high jump, Violett Morris in discus and Louise Groslimond in javelin. Poorly performed measuring however led to that only 2 records, Trickey in running 1000 metres and Regel in walking 1000 metres, later were ratified.
