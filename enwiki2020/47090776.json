He serves as an editor in multiple academic journals such as The Journal of Engineering (UK), Frontiers in Bioscience (USA), Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology. ==Biography== Arata's family is the male line descendant of the Prince of Goeku in Ryukyu Kingdom, Sh\u00f4 Ry\u00fbtoku, the fourth prince of the King Sh\u014d Shin, the third of the line of the Second Sh\u014d Dynasty. He spent his childhood in Belmont, Massachusetts, while his father, a theoretical physicist who obtained his doctorate under the supervision of Masao Kotani (the tutor of the Emperor Akihito), worked at Harvard University under Martin Karplus (Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2013).Ryukyushinpo April 27th. 2008 His mother is a cousin of Yoko Gushiken, a famous Tarento in Japan and former Light flyweight boxing champion of World Boxing Association (WBA). After graduating from Japanese La Salle Academy, he received his BS, MS, and PhD degrees all in electrical engineering, specialized in MEMS and Bio-MEMS, from the University of Tokyo. In accordance with the advice by Phillip Allen Sharp (Nobel Prize in Medicine 1993), he moved into the field of single molecule biophysics under the advisory of Jean- Louis Viovy at Curie Institute (Paris). After his postdoctoral training at Harvard\u2013MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, and at RIKEN, he was appointed as a Group Leader/Designated Associate Professor at Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University in 2011 at the age of 31. After his appointment as a Visiting scholar (Visiting Associate Professor) at Harvard University with David Weitz,http://weitzlab.seas.harvard.edu/group/alumni Experimental Soft Condensed Matter Group he joined Milliman Inc. Tokyo office since 2015. His serious activity as an amateur pianist drove American composer Frederic Rzewski to dedicate Nanosonata (2006), the later Nanosonatas Book I, No. 1, to him. He also actively held concerts, such as \u201cOkinawa-US friendship concert\u201d at the base chapel, by the attendance of the commanding officer, in Camp Courtney, a U.S. Marine Base located in Uruma City, Okinawa. During his stay in Paris, he studied the piano under Olivier Gardon. He also studied under Pascal Rog\u00e9 and Philippe Entremont at Conservatoire de Nice summer academie, and Gabriel Tacchino at Mozarteum University of Salzburg. ==Honors and awards== Arata received numerous awards from organizations and institutions in various fields of science and technology, including Young Engineers Award by the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers (jp) (2005, the youngest awardee),http://www.jsme.or.jp/English/awards/awardsy05.html The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers Young Innovator Award by CHEMINAS (jp) (2013), ITbM Research Award (2014), The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry Award for Younger Researchers(jp) (2014), Ishida Prize by Nagoya University (2014), and The Young Scientists' Prize by Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (2015). He is an alumnus of the 61st.
