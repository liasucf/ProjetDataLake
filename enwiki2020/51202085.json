It has been covered by numerous artists. ==Background== The song was first recorded by The Shades of Blue. While at Golden World, they were recording background vocals and some demos. Edwin Starr happened to be there. Hearing them sing and liking the way they sounded, he had an unfinished song that he had an idea to do more with. He sat down with the group and they worked out the chorus and wording. According to group member Nick Marinelli, they actually contributed some of the wording and chorus, but weren't credited for that. He cites their youth and inexperience for not knowing what their crediting should have been. The song was recorded in the late fall of 1965. They took the record to Harry Balk at Impact Records. He signed them into a contract. The record was released in March 1966 and in no time went straight to no. 1 in the locals. Nationally it got to no. 12 in the pop charts and no. 7 in the R&B; charts.Carolina Beach Music from the '60s to the '80s: The New Wave, By Rick Simmons Pae 151 ==Other versions== A version of the song by Blinky and Edwin Starr was released in the Gordy label in 1969.Billboard, August 2, 1969 Page 64, Spotlight Singles On the week ending August 23, 1969, in the Billboard Hot 100, the song had climbed from 99 where it was the previous week to 92.Billboard, August 23, 1969 Page 99 Billboard Hot 100 for week ending August, 23, 1969 A version by Herb McQuay was released on the Ode label in 1980.National Library of New Zealand Catalogue Oh how happy, Edwin Starr ; (performed by) Herb McQuay.
