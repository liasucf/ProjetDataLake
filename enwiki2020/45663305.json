Like Sexto Sentido (1994) and Luz no Meu Caminho (1995), T\u00f4 de Bem com a Vida was designed with the aim of appealing to both children and teenagers, as the Xuxa audience continued to follow their work. The album has as its main bet the Ax\u00e9.

The highlight of the album is the mix of Brazilian rhythms and themes. Ax\u00e9 came as the biggest bet with songs like T\u00f4 de well with Life and Xuxax\u00e9, in addition to Carnaxuxa that portrays how is the carnival in the different corners of Brazil. Still in the Culture of Brazil issue, was composed \"A Caravela De Cabral\", who talks about the history of the discovery of Brazil and \"Vaqueiro Vai Buscar Meu Boi\", which brings a bit of folklore to the album. \"Ai, Ai, Ai\" was originally composed for the singer Falc\u00e3o. When Z\u00e9 Henrique (songwriter) showed the song to the manager of Xuxa at the time, Marlene Mattos, she decided that the presenter would record the song for the album, arguing that the singer was irreverent and would marry the proposal of the album. The track \"Brincar De Rimar\" is a re-recording of Fof\u00e3o, but with the letter altered. In the passage that quotes the character, his name is replaced by that of Xuxa. The song \"Amiga\", composition in homage to Marlene Mattos, was recorded without the manager knew. The music video was also recorded as a surprise to the manager. The album was entirely produced by Michael Sullivan. ==Release and reception== T\u00f4 de Bem com a Vida It was released by Som Livre on October 5, 1996 in CD, cassette and LP being the last released in this format.
