It is one of the smallest communes of the \u00cele-de-France by land area, but is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe. It is located on the edge of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, near the Porte de Vincennes and the Porte de Saint-Mand\u00e9. The motto of the city is Cresco et Floresco, which means \"I grow and I flourish\". ==History== On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, about two-thirds of the commune of Saint-Mand\u00e9 was annexed to Paris, and now forms the neighborhoods of Bel-Air and Picpus, in the 12th arrondissement of Paris. In 1929, the commune of Saint-Mand\u00e9 lost one-quarter of its territory when the city of Paris annexed the Bois de Vincennes, a small part of which belonged to Saint-Mand\u00e9, leaving Saint-Mand\u00e9 as a small rump commune after the territorial losses of 1860 and 1929. ==Personalities== *Juliette Benzoni, novel writer *Charles Berling, actor *Maurice Boitel, painter *Armand Carrel, political writer, who died there in a duel *Ga\u00ebtan Charbonnier, footballer *Claudette Colbert, actress *Georges Courteline writer and lampoonist *Bruno Cremer, actor *Alexandra David-N\u00e9el, Asian scholar *Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Diefenthal, actor *Juliette Drouet, mistress of Victor Hugo *Alfred Gr\u00e9vin, caricaturist, founder of Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin * Jacqueline Lamba Breton, (1910\u20131993) was a French painter and married (1934\u20131943) to Andr\u00e9 Breton *Paul Nicolas, footballer *Christine Nougaret, archivist *Charles Nungesser, aviator ==Transport== The municipality is crossed by a principal north\u2013south axis, the Avenue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle (formerly Rue de la R\u00e9publique), and by an east\u2013west axis, the Avenue de Paris (RN 34).
