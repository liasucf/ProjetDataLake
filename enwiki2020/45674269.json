    "text": "A hemi-cuboctahedron is an abstract polyhedron, containing half the faces of a semiregular cuboctahedron. It has 4 triangular faces and 3 square faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. It can be seen as a rectified hemi-octahedron or rectified hemi-cube. It can be realized as a projective polyhedron (a tessellation of the real projective plane by 4 triangles and 3 square), which can be visualized by constructing the projective plane as a hemisphere where opposite points along the boundary are connected. == Dual== Its dual polyhedron is a rhombic hemi-dodecahedron which has 7 vertices (1-7), 12 edges (a-l), and 6 rhombic faces (A-F). :File:Rhombic_hemi-dodecahedron.png == Related polyhedra== It has a real presentation as a uniform star polyhedron, the tetrahemihexahedron. :160px == See also == *Hemi-dodecahedron *Hemi- icosahedron == References == * == External links== * The hemicubeoctahedron Category:Projective polyhedra eo:Duon-dekduedro ",
