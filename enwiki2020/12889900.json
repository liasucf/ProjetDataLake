    "text": "Barbro Charlotte Rohlin (born 2 December 1980) is a Swedish former footballer who played as a defender and captained Damallsvenskan club Link\u00f6pings FC. She won 77 caps for the Sweden women's national football team between 2007 and 2015. ==Club career== Rohlin began playing for Link\u00f6pings in 1987, while they were still attached to BK Kenty, and progressed up through the youth teams. In 2009 Rohlin rejected an approach from Philadelphia Independence of the American Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), to extend her contract with Link\u00f6pings. She decided to retire from football at the end of the 2015 season, taking a position in the club's marketing department. At the time of her retirement, Rohlin was the player with most appearances for Link\u00f6pings with more than 300 matches played in all competitions (232 of them in the league). ==International career== Rohlin at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup At the 2007 edition of the Algarve Cup, Rohlin made her debut for the senior Sweden team in a 3\u20130 win over Finland. Her first appearance in the squad for a major tournament came at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She was selected for UEFA Women's Euro 2009 and scored Sweden's first goal at the tournament, in their 3\u20130 group stage win over Russia. Rohlin was also part of the team which secured third place at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany. She featured in Sweden's 3\u20131 semi-final defeat to eventual winners Japan in Frankfurt. Sweden secured third place by beating France 2\u20131 in Sinsheim. Rohlin missed the 2012 London Olympics with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. After a year out, she returned to club football in spring 2013 and immediately targeted a place in Sweden's squad for UEFA Women's Euro 2013. Although selected for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Rohlin was no longer first choice due to Nilla Fischer's switch to centre-back and the emergence of younger players such as Emma Berglund and Amanda Ilestedt. When Sweden performed poorly and crashed out without winning a game, Rohlin criticised the tactics of coach Pia Sundhage. ===Matches and goals scored at World Cup & Olympic tournaments=== Charlotte Rohlin appeared Sweden in one World Cup (Germany 2011) and one Olympic Games (Beijing 2008). She was on the roster for the 2007 and 2015 World Cups, but did not see playing time in either of those tournaments. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"fontsize:90%;\" |- ! Goal ! Match !
