    "text": "The 1872 Cup \u2013 also known as the 1872 Challenge Cup \u2013 is a men's rugby union tournament contested every year between the two Scottish professional clubs Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby. Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby use their Pro14 league matches against one another to decide the Cup winners. The highest aggregate score in the home and away ties decides the 1872 Champions. Not only is the Glasgow \u2013 Edinburgh fixture the oldest inter-district rugby match in the world,https://www.pro14rugby.org/2010/12/22/the-original-derby/ but the derby is classed as one of the biggest in world rugby. Former Edinburgh coach, the South African Alan Solomons states: \"These games are massive. For me, this is one of the big derbies of world rugby.\" ==History== The 1872 Cup marks the history of the world's oldest representative match. On 23 November 1872 a Glasgow District side met an Edinburgh District side at Burnbank Park, the home ground of Glasgow Academicals. Rugby Union was 20 a side in those days. Edinburgh won the first match. However, there was no cup to be won \u2013 and no cup was won until 1995. ===District sides=== Scotland was to have 4 District Sides: North and Midlands; South; Glasgow District and Edinburgh District. These sides would regularly play each other and a Scottish Inter-District Championship was introduced in 1953. A Scottish Exiles side was also introduced in the later McEwans District Championship. ===Professionalism and the Inter-City Cup=== The 4 District Sides North and Midlands, South, Glasgow and Edinburgh were to become Caledonia Reds, Border Reivers, Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby with professionalism. These teams challenged in the Inter-District Championship for European qualification to the Heineken Cup. A Cup was offered by the Sponsors, the estate agents Slater, Hogg and Howison in 1995. In 1997\u201398 the competition received a new sponsor: Inter-City Trains \u2013 and the Cup became known as the Inter-City Cup. When Caledonia Reds and Border Reivers were merged into the Glasgow and Edinburgh sides, Glasgow and Edinburgh played one-off matches for the Inter-City Cup from 1998 to 2002. The Cup became the Virgin Trains Cup with sponsorship in 2001\u201302 with the Welsh-Scottish League matches between the pair being used to determine the winner. When the Border Reivers were revived in 2002 the Inter-City Cup was forgotten about and it sat in the old Glasgow & District Rugby Union office in Somerset Place, Glasgow for a few years. Unfortunately the Reivers folded again in 2007. ==1872 Cup begins== The Cup was revived and rebranded by Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby as the 1872 Cup in season 2007\u201308. 1872 thus marking the date of the oldest derby match in rugby union history between the original Glasgow and Edinburgh amateur district sides on which the professional clubs were founded. ==Format of the Challenge Cup== Previously, the two league encounters of the Pro12 were used to decide the winner of the 1872 Challenge Cup. Usually, these fixtures were scheduled as double-headers; home/away to rival one week and away/home to rival the next. These double- headers were often scheduled around the weekends of Christmas and New Year. The 2016-17 season's 1872 Cup matches did not follow the double header format.http://www.edinburghrugby.org/news/16/07/13/guinness-pro12-reveal- fixtures-201617-season The aggregate score of Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby in the fixtures is taken into account in deciding the winner. Where the aggregate score is tied the holder retains the trophy. The format of the 1872 Cup for the 2017-18 season will be over 3 Pro14 matches.http://www.glasgowwarriors.org/news/17/08/01/important-information- season-ticket-members ==Sponsorship== The cup was originally sponsored by Greaves Sports. Crabbie's have been announced as the sponsor of the 2016-17 season's 1872 Cup.http://www.theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2016/10/rugby-1872-cup-edinburgh-v- glasgow/ ==List of results== ===Two-match format (2007\u201308 to 2016\u201317)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
