A member of the Roman Senate, he first turns up in the historical record around the year 149 BC, where he appeared as the senior witness to a Senatus consultum sent to Corcyra.Brennan, pg. 225; Sherk, pg. 37 Egnatius was elected Praetor sometime prior to 146 BC, and following this he was assigned the newly created province of Macedonia as its Proconsular governor, replacing Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus who had just finished pacifying the new province.Broughton, pg. 84; Brennan, pg. 225 During his tenure as governor of Macedonia, Gnaeus Egnatius began the construction of the eponymous Via Egnatia which was begun in 146 BC and completed in 120 BC. His portion of the Roman road began at the Adriatic Sea, crossed the Pindus mountains and travelled eastward into central Macedonia, ending at Thessalonica.Lintott, Andrew, The Romans in the Age of Augustus (2010), pg. 8 Nothing further is known of his tenure as governor of Macedonia, or of his subsequent career. ==Sources== * Brennan, T.
