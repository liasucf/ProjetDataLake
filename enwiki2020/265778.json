    "text": "Peter Gary Tatchell (born 25 January 1952) is a British human rights campaigner, originally from Australia, best known for his work with LGBT social movements. Tatchell was selected as the Labour Party's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey in 1981. He was then denounced by party leader Michael Foot for ostensibly supporting extra-parliamentary action against the Thatcher government. Labour subsequently allowed him to stand in the Bermondsey by-election in February 1983, in which the party lost the seat to the Liberals. In the 1990s he campaigned for LGBT rights through the direct action group OutRage!, which he co-founded. He has worked on various campaigns, such as Stop Murder Music against music lyrics allegedly inciting violence against LGBT people and writes and broadcasts on various human rights and social justice issues. He attempted a citizen's arrest of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in 1999 and again in 2001. In April 2004, he joined the Green Party of England and Wales and in 2007 was selected as prospective parliamentary candidate in the constituency of Oxford East, but in December 2009 announced he was standing down due to brain damage he says was caused by a bus accident as well as damage inflicted by Mugabe's bodyguards when Tatchell tried to arrest him in 2001, and by neo-Nazis in Moscow while campaigning for gay rights. Since 2011 he has been the Director of the Peter Tatchell Foundation. ==Early life== Peter Tatchell at his home in 2007 Tatchell was born in Melbourne, Australia. His father was a lathe operator and his mother worked in a biscuit factory. His parents divorced when he was four and his mother remarried soon afterwards. Since the family finances were strained by medical bills, he had to leave school at 16 in 1968. He started work as a sign-writer and window-dresser in department stores. Tatchell claims to have incorporated the theatricality of these displays into his activism.\"Is This Your Life?\" television programme, Channel 4, 5 August 1995. Raised as a Christian, Tatchell says that he \"ditched [his] faith a long time ago\" and is an atheist. It is widely reported that Tatchell is a vegan; however, Tatchell himself only states that he eats no meat, but does eat eggs, cheese, and, according to Richard Fairbrass, wild salmon, meaning Tatchell is a pescatarian. He became interested in outdoor adventurous activities such as surfing and mountain climbing. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions about how insurance and legal risks were making British teachers reluctant to take pupils on outdoor adventures, he said outdoor activities helped him develop the courage to take political risks in adult life. ===Campaigns in Australia=== Tatchell's political activity began at Mount Waverley Secondary College, where in 1967 he launched campaigns in support of Australia's Aboriginal people. Tatchell was elected secretary of the school's Student Representative Council. In his final year in 1968, as school captain, he took the lead in setting up a scholarship scheme for Aborigines and led a campaign for Aboriginal land rights. These activities led the headmaster to claim he had been manipulated by communists. He joined the Australian campaign against the death penalty. Prompted by the impending hanging of Ronald Ryan in 1967, Tatchell went round his local area painting slogans against the hanging, a fact he did not reveal until nearly 30 years later.\"Bermondsey ten years on\", Gay Times, February 1993. Ryan was accused of killing a prison warder while escaping from Pentridge Prison in Coburg, Victoria. Tatchell claimed, unsuccessfully, that the trajectory of the bullet through the warder's body probably made it impossible that Ryan could have fired the fatal shot. In 1968, Tatchell began campaigning against the American and Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, in his view a war of aggression in support of a \"brutal and corrupt dictatorship\" responsible for torture and executions. The Victoria state government and Melbourne city council attempted to suppress the anti-Vietnam War campaign by banning street leafleting and taking police action against anti-war demonstrations.New Statesman: Volume 137, Issues 4891\u20134903, 2008. In 2004, he proposed the renaming of Australian capital cities with their Aborigine place names. === Gay Liberation Front === Original UK Gay Liberation Front activists, including Bette Bourne (on the left), at an LSE 40th anniversary celebration. Tatchell is fourth from the left. To avoid conscription into the Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971.Jorge Morales, \"Tatchell's Long Crusade\", The Advocate, 2 May 1995; page 23. He had accepted being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading member of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve \"poofs\" and protests against police harassment and the medical classification of homosexuality as an illness. With others he helped organise Britain's first Gay Pride march in 1972. In 1973, he attended the 10th World Youth Festival in East Berlin on GLF's behalf. His actions triggered opposition within and between different groups of national delegates including the Communist Party of Great Britain and National Union of Students. He was banned from conferences, had his leaflets confiscated and burned, was interrogated by the secret police (the Stasi) and threatened and assaulted by other delegates, mostly communists. Tatchell later claimed that this was the first time gay liberation politics were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of decriminalisation and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than in Britain and much of the West.Peter Tatchell, \"GLF at the World Youth Festival, GDR 1973\", in Gay Marxist No 3 (October 1973). Describing his time in the Gay Liberation Front, he wrote in The Guardian that: === Graduation === After taking A levels at evening classes, he attended the Polytechnic of North London (PNL), now part of London Metropolitan University, where he obtained a 2:1 BSc (Hons) in sociology. At PNL he was a member of the National Union of Students Gay Rights Campaign. On graduating he became a freelance journalist specialising in foreign stories, during which he publicised the Indonesian annexation of West Papua and child labour on British-owned tea farms in Malawi.\"Britain's profitable brew\", New Statesman, 20 July 1979, p. 88\u201389 == Political activity == rainbow flag, the international LGBT symbol Tatchell popularised the phrase \"sexual apartheid\" to describe the separate laws that long existed for gays and heterosexuals.Tim Ross (19 March 2011). \"Peter Tatchell bids to overturn gay marriage ban at European Court of Human Rights\". The Daily Telegraph (London).Megan Murphy (31 July 2006). \"British Lesbians Lose Bid to Validate Their Marriage\" , Bloomberg News (New York). ===Labour candidate for Bermondsey=== In 1978, Tatchell joined the Labour Party and moved to a council flat in Bermondsey, south-east London. At the Bermondsey Constituency Labour Party's (CLP) AGM in February 1980, the left group won control and Tatchell was elected Secretary. When the sitting Labour MP, Bob Mellish, announced his retirement in 1981, Tatchell was selected as his successor, despite Arthur Latham, a former MP and former Chairman of the Tribune Group, being considered the favourite. While Militant was cited as the reason for Tatchell's selection, Tatchell disagrees and ascribes his selection to the support of the \"older, 'born and bred' working class; the younger professional and intellectual members swung behind Latham\".Peter Tatchell (1983). The Battle for Bermondsey. Heretic Books. p. 50. In an article for a left-wing magazine, Tatchell urged the Labour Party to support direct action campaigning to challenge the Margaret Thatcher-led Tory government, stating \"we must look to new more militant forms of extra-parliamentary opposition which involve mass popular participation and challenge the government's right to rule\".London Labour Briefing, November 1981. Social Democratic Party MP James Wellbeloved, arguing the article was anti-Parliamentary, quoted it at Prime Minister's Questions in November 1981. Foot denounced Tatchell, stating that he would not be endorsed as a candidate and a vote at the Labour Party National Executive Committee denied Tatchell's endorsement. However, the Bermondsey Labour Party continued to support him and it was eventually agreed that when the selection was rerun, Tatchell would be eligible, and he duly won. When Mellish resigned from Parliament and triggered a by-election, Tatchell's candidacy was endorsed, and the ensuing campaign was regarded as one of the dirtiest and most violent in modern British history. Tatchell was assaulted in the street, had his flat attacked, and had a death threat and a live bullet put through his letterbox in the night. Although the Bermondsey seat had long been a Labour stronghold, the Liberal candidate, Simon Hughes, won the election. During the campaign, allegations were made that some Liberal canvassers stirred up xenophobia and homophobia on the doorsteps, playing up the fact that Tatchell was born in Australia and making an issue of his homosexuality. Members of the Liberal Gay Action Group campaigned wearing lapel badges with the words, \"I've been kissed by Peter Tatchell\" following the suggestion that he was attempting to hide his sexuality. One of Hughes' campaign leaflets claimed the election was \"a straight choice\" between Liberal and Labour,. Hughes has since apologised for what may have been seen as an inadvertent slur and later came out as bisexual in 2006. === Democratic Defence === Tatchell's book Democratic Defence was published in 1985. This outlined how defence of the United Kingdom might be assured after the nuclear disarmament that he and the Labour Party were then committed to. (Labour has since abandoned this policy.)History of the Labour Party , Labour Party website, accessed 21 March 2014. It argued that the British military was still organised on an imperialist strategy of basing troops abroad rather than on a strategy of defending the UK itself against foreign attacks. Citing the problems that the British army was facing in Northern Ireland, he argued that their long-established methods were ineffective against guerilla warfare., for troops to be allowed to join trade unions and political parties, and to end strict adherence to \"petty regulations\". He favorably noted the World War 2 era British Home Guard as an example of a citizens' army, as well as the armed forces of Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia as positive examples. The book also argues for withdrawal from NATO and for the establishment of a European Self-Defence Organisation, independent of both the United States, whom he felt that Europe had become too dependent on their military protection, and the Soviet Union, which he condemned for their invasions of Czechoslovakia and of Afghanistan, as well its internal repression. He quoted with approval Enoch Powell's argument that the threat from the Soviet Union to the UK was exaggerated. ===Green issues=== Peter Tatchell at the Cowley Road Carnival in Oxford in July 2007 In February 2000 Tatchell resigned from Labour, citing the treatment of Ken Livingstone during the nomination of a candidate for Mayor of London, and of similar cases in the Scottish and Welsh elections, as evidence that the party \"no longer has any mechanism for democratic involvement and transformation\".Peter Tatchell: Why I Resigned from Labour , petertatchell.net, 23 February 2000. He fought unsuccessfully for a seat on the London Assembly as an Independent candidate within the Green Left grouping, in support of Livingstone. On 7 April 2004 he announced that he had joined the Green Party of England and Wales but did not envisage standing for election. However, in 2007, he became the party's parliamentary candidate for Oxford East. On 16 December 2009, he withdrew as a candidate claiming brain damage from an assault while protesting in Brussels in 2001, while protesting in Moscow in 2007 and in a bus accident in July 2009. Tatchell opposes nuclear power; instead he advocates concentrated solar power.Peter Tatchell, \"Economic Democracy\" \u2013 How The Light Gets In, 5 June 2012 In Tribune, he pointed out the adverse effects of climate change: \"By 2050, if climate change proceeds unchecked, England will no longer be a green and pleasant land. In between periods of prolonged scorching drought, we are likely to suffer widespread flooding.\" For many years, he supported a green\u2013red alliance. More recently, he helped launch the Green Left grouping within the Green Party. He urged links between trade unions and the Greens. On 27 April 2010, he urged Green Party supporters to vote for Liberal Democrats in constituencies where they had an incumbent MP or a strong chance of winning.BBC News: Live coverage \u2013 General Election 2010, 27 April 2010, 16:03 === Iraq War === Tatchell opposed the war in Iraq, and its subsequent occupation. For nearly three decades he had previously supported the Iraqi Left Opposition, helping them remove the government of Saddam Hussein because of the gross violations of human rights that Hussein had committed against democrats, left-wingers, trade unionists, Shia Muslims and the Kurdish people, and because under Saddam's dictatorship there were no opportunities for peaceful, democratic change. He advocated military and financial aid to opponents of the Saddam government, suggesting that anti-Saddam organisations be given \"tanks, helicopter gun-ships, fighter planes, heavy artillery and anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles\".Peter Tatchell (19 March 2003). \"Iraq: the third way\". The Guardian (London). While opposing western intervention, he advocated regime change from within in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria.\"ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT IGNORES SADDAM'S CRIMES Tatchell has written that on 12 March 2003 he ambushed Tony Blair's motorcade in an anti-Iraq war protest. He forced Blair's limousine to stop, and then unfolded a banner that read \"Arm the Kurds! Topple Saddam\". He added that in terms of the political struggle within Britain (as opposed to struggles against absolute tyrants like Hitler and Saddam, where violent resistance can be the lesser of two evils): \"I remain committed to the Gandhian principle of non-violence\".\"Diary\" \u2013 Peter Tatchell. New Statesman (London), 24 March 2003. After the war he signed the 'Unite Against Terror' declaration, arguing that \"the pseudo-left reveals its shameless hypocrisy and its wholesale abandonment of humanitarian values\" by supporting resistance and insurgent groups in Iraq that resort to indiscriminate terrorism, killing innocent civilians. In 2003, Tatchell said he supported giving \"massive material aid\" to Iraqi opposition groups, including the \"Shi'ite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq\" (SCIRI), to bring down Saddam. But in 2006 Tatchell noted that SCIRI had become markedly more fundamentalist and was endorsing violent attacks on anyone who did not conform to its increasingly harsh interpretation of Islam. He claimed that SCIRI, the leading force in Baghdad's ruling coalition, wanted to establish an Iranian-style religious dictatorship, with a goal of clerical fascism, and had engaged in \"terrorisation of gay Iraqis\", as well as terrorising Sunni Muslims, left- wingers, unveiled women and people who listen to western pop music or wear jeans or shorts.Peter Tatchell, \"Iraq \u2013 Ayatollah Sistani Says Death to Gays; Sistani fatwa encourages terror against queers. Shia Badr Corps execute sodomites, Sunnis and others. UK fetes Sistani and hosts Badr's political wing, despite anti-gay murders.\" , 15 March 2006.; News story about protest- Marc Shoffman, \"Iraqi Ayatollah sparks outrage after decreeing death to gays\", Pink News, 17 March 2006. In September 2014, Tatchell advocated arming the Kurdistan Workers Party to fight against ISIS, and argued that the US and EU had been wrong to designate it as a terrorist organisation. In November 2015, Tatchell condemned the conviction of British teenager Silhan \u00d6z\u00e7elik for trying to join the Kurdistan Workers Party. ===Syrian civil war=== A previous supporter of the Stop the War Coalition, Tatchell and many other public personalities expressed concern with the coalition's allegedly unduly favourable view of Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, and has called for the Labour leader and former Stop the War Chair Jeremy Corbyn not to attend the Coalition's Christmas fundraiser 2015. In December 2016, Tatchell and others disrupted Corbyn's speech on human rights on the basis that the Labour leader had responded insufficiently to the bombing of Aleppo and urged him to condemn Russian military intervention in Syria. === Balochistan === Since 2006, he expressed concern for the Baloch people facing military operations in their homeland, Balochistan in Pakistan. From 2007 to 2009, he campaigned in defence of two UK-based Baloch Muslim human rights activists, Hyrbyair Marri and Faiz Baluch, accused of terrorism charges and tried in London. Both men were acquitted in 2009. He alleged British and U.S. collusion with the suppression of the Balochs, including arms sales to Pakistan, which he says were used to bomb and attack Baloch towns and villages.Peter Tatchell, \"Balochistan: UN Speech\", delivered to Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization; Human Rights in Pakistan conference held at the United Nations in Geneva on 11 March 2010 parallel to the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council. The conference was co-hosted by UNPO and Interfaith International. () === Activities in Moscow === In May 2006 Tatchell attended the first Moscow Pride Festival. He appears in the documentary Moscow Pride '06 featuring this event. In May 2007 Tatchell returned to Moscow to support Moscow Pride and to voice his opposition to a ban on the march, staying at the flat of an American diplomat. On 27 May 2007, Tatchell and other gay rights activists were attacked. He was punched in the face and nearly knocked unconscious, while other demonstrators were beaten, kicked and assaulted. A German MP, Volker Beck, and a European Parliament deputy from Italy, Marco Cappato, were also punched before being arrested and questioned by police. Tatchell later said \"I'm not deterred one iota from coming back to protest in Moscow.\"http://pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4499.html On his release, Tatchell made a report on the incident to the American Embassy. On 16 May 2009, the day of the final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Moscow, Russian gay rights activists staged a protest in Moscow in defiance of the city's mayor, Yuri Luzkhov, who had long banned gay demonstrations and denounced them as \"satanic\". Tatchell was among 32 campaigners arrested when they shouted slogans and unfurled banners. === NUS politics === On 14 February 2015, Tatchell was one of a number of signatories to a letter criticising the trend in the British National Union of Students to apply a No Platform policy to feminists who criticised the sex industry or challenged demands made by certain groups of trans people. In particular, the letter cited the denial of a platform to Kate Smurthwaite at Goldsmith's College and to Germaine Greer at the University of Cambridge. Tatchell received death threats after signing the letter. He later stated that he would have worded the letter differently to clarify that he supported the human rights of trans people and sex workers, but that he had signed the letter nonetheless because he believed in the message of free speech on campuses. He said that the initial draft that he signed contained the sentence \"Some of us have disagreements with the views expressed [by feminist critics of trans people]\", and that he was \"not happy\" that this was cut out of the final letter. On 13 February 2016, Fran Cowling, the national LGBT representative for the NUS, refused to share a platform with Tatchell at Canterbury Christ Church University to discuss the topic of \"re- radicalising queers\". Cowling said that Tatchell supported speakers who are \"openly transphobic and incite violence\" against transgender people, and also that Tatchell had used \"racist language\". Tatchell responded that no evidence could be produced to support either claim, and that Cowling had never consulted the NUS membership before deciding to make pronouncements on their behalf, and said \"This sorry, sad saga is symptomatic of the decline of free and open debate on some university campuses. There is a witch-hunting, accusatory atmosphere. Allegations are made without evidence to back them \u2013 or worse, they are made citing false, trumped-up evidence.\" ===2015 Labour Party leadership election=== In August 2015, Tatchell endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He tweeted: \"Jeremy Corbyn is the best hope for a progressive shake up of UK politics @jeremycorbyn @Corbyn4Leader #SignUp4Corbyn\". Since then he has criticised Corbyn, tweeting in August 2018: \"For all of us who support Jeremy Corbyn's UK social justice policies, his repeated praise for, & collusion with, anti-semites & Islamist fascists is very disturbing. He has NEVER recanted or apologised.\" Tatchell urged his followers to read a piece on Corbyn's links to Raed Salah. == Campaigns == Peter Tatchell being interviewed by Natalie Thorne, deputy editor of Fyne Times, at a 'First Sunday' event, November 2007 === OutRage! === Tatchell took part in many gay rights campaigns over issues such as Section 28. Following the murder of actor Michael Boothe on 10 May 1990, Tatchell was one of thirty people to attend the inaugural meeting of the radical gay rights non-violent direct action group OutRage! \u2013 although he was not a co-founder \u2013 and has remained a leading member. The group fuses theatrical performance styles with queer protest. As the most prominent OutRage! member, Tatchell is sometimes assumed to be the leader of the group, though he has never claimed this, saying he is one among equals.See, e.g., Ian Lucas, \"OutRage! \u2013 an oral history\", Cassell 1998. In 1991, a small group of OutRage! members covertly formed a separate group to engage in a campaign of outing public figures who were homophobic in public but gay in private. The group took the name FROCS (Faggots Rooting Out Closeted Sexuality). Tatchell was the group's go-between with the press, forwarding their news statements to his media contacts. Considerable publicity and public debate followed FROCS's threat to out 200 leading public personalities from the world of politics, religion, business and sport. With Tatchell's assistance, members of FROCS eventually called a press conference to tell the world that their campaign was a hoax intended to demonstrate the hypocrisy of those newspapers that had condemned the campaign despite having themselves outed celebrities and politicians.Ian Lucas, \"OutRage! \u2013 an oral history\", Cassell 1998, pp. 63\u201371 Some OutRage! activities were highly controversial. In 1994, it unveiled placards inviting ten Church of England bishops to \"tell the truth\" about what Outrage! alleged was their homosexuality and accusing them of condemning homosexuality in public while leading secret gay lives. Shortly afterwards the group wrote to twenty UK MPs, condemning their alleged support for anti-gay laws and claiming they would out them if the MPs did not stop what they described as attacks on the gay community. The MP Sir James Kilfedder, one such opponent of gay equality,http://www.scotsgay.co.uk/text/sg3.txt who had received one of the letters, died two months later of a sudden heart attack on the day one of the Belfast newspapers planned to out him. In a comment in The Independent in October 2003, Tatchell claimed the OutRage! action against the bishops was his greatest mistake because he failed to anticipate that the media and the church would treat it as an invasion of privacy. On 12 April 1998, Tatchell led an OutRage! protest, which disrupted the Easter sermon by George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with Tatchell mounting the pulpit to denounce what he claimed was Carey's opposition to legal equality for lesbian and gay people. The protest garnered media coverage and led to Tatchell's prosecution under the little-used Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860 (formerly part of the Brawling Act 1551), which prohibits any form of disruption or protest in a church.Garner, Clare (30 November 1998). \"Stars of stage and pulpit will support 'indecent' Tatchell\". The Independent (London).Garner, Clare (1 December 1998). \"Protest in the cathedral 'political', says Tatchell\". The Independent (London). Tatchell failed in his attempt to summon Carey as a witness and was convicted. The judge fined him the trivial sum of \u00a318.60, which commentators theorised was a wry allusion to the year of the statute used to convict him.\"Tatchell defends Mugabe 'arrest'\". BBC News. 6 March 2001.Summerskill, Ben (23 February 2003).\"The Observer Profile: Peter Tatchell: Just a zealous guy\". The Observer (London). The LGBT press dubbed him \"Saint Peter Tatchell\" following further OutRage! campaigns involving religion. A number of African LGBTI leaders signed a statement condemning the involvement of Tatchell and OutRage! in African issues, which led Tatchell to respond that he favoured working with the radical LGBTI groups in Africa rather than the more conservative (according to him) leaders who had signed the statement. Tatchell and OutRage! published a refutation of the allegations. OutRage!'s protest against Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, who supported the idea of genetic engineering to eliminate homosexuality,\"If we could by some form of genetic engineering eliminate these trends, we should\u2014so long as it is done for a therapeutic purpose\" \u2014 letter to the Jewish Chronicle, 16 July 1993 led to accusations that Tatchell was antisemitic, following OutRage!'s leaflets citing the similarity of Jakobovits ideas for the eradication of homosexuality to those of Heinrich Himmler were distributed outside the Western and Marble Arch Synagogue on the Rosh Hashanah in September 1993. Rabbi Dame Julia Neuberger, who had campaigned for gay rights, said \"Drawing a comparison between Lord Jakobovits and Himmler is offensive, racist and [...] makes OutRage appear antisemitic\". She stated that the action and leaflet would \"alienate Jews who are sympathetic to gay rights\".Jason Bennetto, \"Is this comparison odious?\", The Independent, 31 October 1993. ==== Stop Murder Music campaign ==== Tatchell argues that a number of Afro- Caribbean artists produce music that glorifies murder of homosexual men, and incites violence against homosexuals. He argued that British laws against incitement to violence were not being enforced on foreign artists traveling to the UK. He also organised protests outside the concerts of singers whose lyrics he says incite violence, mainly Jamaican dancehall and ragga artists who he says glorify violence toward lesbians and gay men, including murder. Tatchell's campaign began in 1992 when Buju Banton's song \"Boom bye-bye\" was released. He has picketed the MOBO Awards ceremony to protest at their inviting performers of what he terms \"murder music\". Tatchell argues that murder is not legal in Jamaica, and glorification of murder is not a legitimate form of Afro-Caribbean culture. In response Tatchell received death threats and was labelled racist. He defended himself by noting that the campaign was at the behest of the Jamaican gay rights group J-Flag, and the UK-based Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, with which he works closely. He pointed to what he described as his life's work campaigning against racism and apartheid and stated that his campaigns against \"murder music\" and state- sanctioned homophobic violence in Jamaica were endorsed by black Jamaican gay rights activists such as Jamaican Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-FLAG), and by many straight human rights activists in Jamaica (male homosexuality remains illegal in Jamaica). The campaign has had positive effects with seven of eight original murder music singers signing the Reggae Compassion Act, which says that signatories will not \"make statements or perform songs\" that incite hatred or violence.Leah Nelson, \"Jamaica's Anti-Gay 'Murder Music' Carries Violent Message\" Intelligence Report, Winter 2010, Issue Number: 140. Members of the Rastafari movement accused Tatchell of racism and extremism, saying, \"He has gone over way over the top. It's simply racist to put Hitler and Sizzla in the same bracket and just shows how far he is prepared to go.\"Alicia Roache, Staff Reporter. \"Black Music Council Defends DJ's\" , The Sunday Gleaner (sosjamaica.org). 13 December 2004. Tatchell denies equating Sizzla with Hitler. ===Age of consent laws and Pedophile Information Exchange=== In 1996, Tatchell led an OutRage! campaign to reduce the age of consent in the UK to 14 years, to adjust for studies that showed nearly half of all young people had their first sexual experiences prior to 16 years old, regardless of sexuality. He stated that he wished to exempt these people from being \"treated as criminals by the law,\" and that the campaign claimed there should be no prosecution if the difference in ages of the sexual partners was no more than three years, provided that these youths are given a more comprehensive sex education at a younger date. He was quoted in the OutRage!'s press release as saying \"Young people have a right to accept or reject sex, according to what they feel is appropriate for them\".OutRage! press release, 21 February 1996 Leo McKinstry, in The Sun, called the release \"a perverts' charter\".McKinstry, Leo (24 February 1996). \"Gays Homing in on Kids\". The Sun (London). Tatchell has since reiterated that he does not condone adults having sex with children. On his personal website, under the subsection Age of Consent, he writes: On 10 March 2008, in the Irish Independent, he repeated his call for a lower age of consent to end the criminalisation of young people engaged in consenting sex and to remove the legal obstacles to upfront sex education, condom provision and safer sex advice. Alt URL In 1998 and 2008, he supported relaxation of the then strict laws against pornography, arguing that pornography can have some social benefits, and he has criticised what he calls the body-shame phobia against nudism, suggesting that nudity may be natural and healthy for society. In 2006, he opposed the appointment of Ruth Kelly as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government as Kelly had not supported equal treatment of lesbians and gay men in any parliamentary votes. Tatchell said \"her appointment suggests the government does not take lesbian and gay rights seriously\", adding \"Tony Blair would never appoint someone to a race-equality post who had a lukewarm record of opposing racism\". ====Paedophile Information Exchange==== Tatchell has written an obituary in The Independent for Paedophile Information Exchange founder Ian Dunn, as well as an essay for a pro-paedophile activist and Paedophile Information Exchange member Warren Middleton in the book \"Betrayal of Youth (BOY)\". The actor and activist, John Connors described Tatchell as a \"paedophile apologist\" and other critics (such as the British National Party) have suggested that he is personally pro-paedophile, which he strongly denies - stating that: He also comments on an interview he conducted in the late 1990s on the subject of paedophilia and child prostitution, in which he interviewed a 14-year-old boy (under the pseudonym \"Lee\") who had had sex with older men, in some cases for money. In this interview, Tatchell makes various counterarguments against Lee's point of view, such as: \"How can a young child understand sex and give meaningful consent?\", \"Perhaps your friends were particularly mature for their age. Most young people are not so sophisticated about sex\", \"Many people worry that the power imbalance in a relationship between a youth and an adult means the younger person can be easily manipulated and exploited\", \"Many people fear that making sex easier for under-age teenagers will expose them to dangers like HIV. Isn't that a legitimate worry?\". In 1997 Tatchell wrote a letter to The Guardian, defending an academic book about \"boy-love\", calling the work \"courageous\", before writing: On Tatchell's personal website he clarifies, > My Guardian letter cited examples of youths in Papuan tribes and some of my > friends who, when they were under 16, had sex with adults (over 18s), but > who do not feel they were harmed. I was not endorsing their viewpoint but > merely stating that they had a different perspective from the mainstream > opinion about inter-generational sex. They have every right for their > perspective to be heard.\" Following the publication of a photo of Tatchell alongside the Irish Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Roderic O'Gorman, on Twitter, at a Pride event and subsequent moral panic, O'Gorman issued a statement outlining that the apparent views in Tatchell's letter were \"abhorrant\" to him, and his appreciation that Tatchell clarified his own position. ===Civil partnerships=== Tatchell has pledged his support for opposite-sex couples to be allowed to have civil partnerships, stating that some opposite-sex couples dislike the \"sexist, homophobic history of [the institution of] marriage\", and allowing them into civil partnerships \"is simply a matter of equality\". Writing for his organisation the Peter Tatchell Foundation, he wrote: Writing for Pink News, he continues: === Foreign politics === ==== Imperialism ==== While still at school, Tatchell campaigned in favour of better treatment of, and full human rights for, the Aboriginal people of Australia.(Tatchell, 1983) p.13 He believes that Australian cities should be renamed with their original Aboriginal place names, to sever ties with the colonial era. For example, he wants the Tasmanian capital Hobart to be renamed Nibberluna, arguing that this would be a fitting tribute to Australia's Aboriginal heritage, which he says has been discarded and disrespected for too long. His anti-imperialist activism began in 1968 and involved campaigns against the war in Vietnam. He participated in the mass Vietnam Moratorium protests in his Melbourne in 1970. The same year he founded and was elected secretary of the inter-denominational anti-war movement, Christians for Peace. Later, on moving to London in 1971, he was active in solidarity work with the independence movements in Mozambique, Angola, Guinea Bissau, Namibia, Eritrea, Oman, New Hebrides, Western Sahara, Palestine, East Timor and West Papua. In 2002, he brought an unsuccessful legal action in Bow Street Magistrate's Court for the arrest of the former U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, on charges of war crimes in Vietnam and Cambodia. ====Zimbabwe==== Part of Tatchell's political activism and journalism in the 1970s involved the Bush War (or Second Chimurenga) in Rhodesia, in which he supported the black nationalist movement, including the Zimbabwe African National Union and its military wing. Mugabe's denunciation of male homosexuality in 1995 led Tatchell to help organise a protest for LGBT rights in Zimbabwe outside the Zimbabwe High Commission in London. Two years later, he passed through police security disguised as a TV cameraman to quiz Mugabe during the \"Africa at 40\" conference at Methodist Central Hall, Westminster. Mugabe told him that allegations of human rights abuses were grossly exaggerated; he became agitated when Tatchell told him that he was gay. Mugabe's minders summoned Special Branch guards, who ejected Tatchell. On 26 October 1997 a letter from Tatchell to The Observer argued that the United Kingdom should suspend aid to Zimbabwe because of its violence against LGBT people. Tatchell researched the Gukurahundi attacks in Matabeleland in the 1980s, when the Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade attacked supporters of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union. He became convinced that Mugabe had broken international human rights law during the attack, which is estimated to have involved the massacre of around 20,000 civilians. Then in 1999, journalists Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto were tortured by the Zimbabwe Army. The arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London seemed to him a precedent that human rights violations could be pursued against a head of state, thanks to the principle of universal jurisdiction. On 30 October 1999 Tatchell and three other OutRage! activists approached Mugabe's car in a London street and attempted to perform a citizen's arrest. Tatchell opened the car door and grabbed Mugabe. He then called the police. The four OutRage! activists were arrested, on charges including criminal damage, assault and breach of the peace; charges were dropped on the opening day of their trial. Mugabe responded by describing Tatchell and his OutRage! colleagues as \"gay gangsters\", a slogan frequently repeated by his supporters, and claimed they had been sent by the United Kingdom government. On 5 March 2001, Tatchell believed Mugabe was about to visit Brussels. He went there and attempted a second citizen's arrest. Mugabe's bodyguards were seen knocking him to the floor. Later that day, Tatchell was briefly knocked unconscious by Mugabe's bodyguards and was left with permanent damage to his right eye. The protest drew worldwide headlines, as Mugabe was highly unpopular in the Western world for his land redistribution policy. Tatchell's actions were praised by Zimbabwean activists and many of the newspapers that had previously denounced him. Tatchell ultimately failed in his attempt to secure an international arrest warrant against Mugabe on torture charges. The magistrate argued that Mugabe had immunity from prosecution as a serving head of state. In late 2003, Tatchell acted as a press spokesman for the launch of the Zimbabwe Freedom Movement, which claimed to be a clandestine group within Zimbabwe committed to overthrowing the Mugabe government by force. The civic action support group Sokwanele urged Tatchell to check his sources, speculating that it might have been by the Zimbabwe government to justify violent action. This speculation proved to be unfounded. The Mugabe regime dismissed the ZFM as a \"hoax.\" However, two Central Intelligence Organization members were spotted and turned away from the ZFM launch, as shown in the film \"Peter Tatchell: Just who does he think he is?\" by Max Barber. ====South Africa==== Following a protest against the ANC, Tatchell described himself as a long-time anti-apartheid activist, in an essay for the book 'sex and politics in South Africa', he claimed that his lobbying of the ANC in 1987 contributed to it renouncing homophobia and making its first public commitment to lesbian and gay human rights and that in 1989 and 1990, he helped persuade the ANC to include a ban on anti-gay discrimination in the post-apartheid constitution (claiming he assisted in drafting model clauses for the ANC)Sex and Politics in South Africa (Double Storey Books, Cape Town, 2005), pp. 140\u201349. After Tachell was named as one of the UKs most \"hate filled bigots\" in the 'Desi Express' newspaper, Aaron Saeed, Muslim Affairs spokesperson for the gay human rights group OutRage!, claimed that Tatchell was involved in the anti-apartheid movement for over 20 years.Galloway Activist Urges: Assault Tatchell: Respect Member Stirs Homophobia, Violence and Xenophobia Against Gay Activist , UK Gay News, 16 January 2006. ==== Gaza and the West Bank ==== In a tweet condemning the Palestinian Authority, Tatchell describes himself as a long-term supporter of Palestine. In May 2004, he and a dozen other lesbians and gay men from OutRage! and the Queer Youth Alliance joined a London demonstration organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Their placards read \"Israel: stop persecuting Palestine! Palestine: stop persecuting queers!\". Tatchell claims that others present accused him of being a Mossad agent sent to disrupt the march, of being a racist or a Zionist, a supporter of Ariel Sharon or an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency or MI5. Tatchell has written a number of articles in The Guardian on the issue. ====2008 Olympics==== In April 2008, Tatchell attempted to disrupt the procession of the Olympic torch though London. As a protest against China's human rights record he stood in front of the bus carrying the torch along Oxford Street while carrying a placard calling on Beijing to \"Free Tibet, Free Hu Jia\" (the name of a recently jailed human rights activist). Tatchell was taken away by police but was not charged.Scott Anthony \"Police forced to call in reinforcements as protesters disrupt Olympic torch relay\", The Guardian, 6 April 2008. Retrieved on 4 September 2008. In an interview Tatchell called on the world to boycott the opening ceremony of the Olympics, or to take other visible action. ====Iran==== Tatchell is a critic of capital punishment in Iran. Within Iran, the criminal code has parts based on sharia, and punishments are prescribed for zina offenses, including consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners. Iranian members of parliament publicly support the death penalty for homosexuality.Gays should be hanged, says Iranian minister; The Times, 13 November 2007; Retrieved on 1 April 2008 Iran is a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child which forbids the execution of juveniles, however, Iran kills juvenile offenders. In 2005, Iran executed two teenage boys, Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni, aged 16 and 18. The Iranian government, and Iranian state media, reported that the pair were executed for raping a 13-year-old boy at knifepoint. Tatchell argued that Iran has a history of arresting political activists on false charges and extracting false confessions from death penalty convicts, and declared that he believed the original crime was consensual sex between the two, which is illegal in Iran. Tatchell reiterated his long-standing view that Iran is an \"Islamo-fascist state\". He argued that information from Iranian exile groups with contacts inside Iran was that the teenagers were a secret gay party before they were arrested. International human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch preferred campaigners to focus on the Convention on the Rights of the Child violations rather than the weak allegation of a connection to gay sex. Faisal Alam, founder of American Gay Muslim group Al-Fatiha, argued in the magazine Queer that Iran was condemned before the facts were certain, and in 2003 the United Nations Committee Against Torture noted that \"from different and reliable sources that there currently is no active policy of prosecution of charges of homosexuality in Iran\". ====Russia==== Tatchell has written articles condemning the Russian LGBT propaganda law. In 2014 Tatchell protested Valery Gergiev's support for Vladimir Putin. Tatchell protested the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi over the gay rights stance of Russia, comparing the event to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Tatchell was arrested at the Moscow Pride parade in 2011 amid a spate of anti-gay violence by Neo-Nazis. Tatchell argues that the Russian police collude with Neo-Nazi elements, and that some in the Neo-Nazi group were undercover police officers. In February 2007, the Mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, visited London mayor Ken Livingstone for an annual meeting that also involved the Mayors of Berlin and Paris, with the mayor of Beijing present as well. Nikolay Alexeyev, one of the organizers of the Moscow gay pride parade, joined Tatchell in protesting the visit. A notice of the protest quoted Talgat Tadzhuddin saying that the Moscow pride marchers should be flogged. Livingstone asserted that he supports gay rights, and said \"In Moscow the Russian Orthodox church, the chief rabbi and the grand Mufti all supported the ban on the Gay Pride march with the main role, due to its great weight in society, being played by the Orthodox church. The attempt of Mr Tatchell to focus attention on the role of the grand Mufti in Moscow, in the face of numerous attacks on gay rights in Eastern Europe, which overwhelmingly come from right-wing Christian and secular currents, is a clear example of an Islamophobic campaign.\" Tatchell retorted that Livingstone's remarks were \"dishonest, despicable nonsense\", adding \"The Grand Mufti was not singled out\". He further said the Mayor had brought his \"office into disrepute\" and \"has revealed himself to be a person without principles, honesty or integrity.\"Gay Pride Parade Wars: Livingstone Attacks Tatchell and Alexeyev Attacks Livingstone \u2013 UK Gay News, 1 March 2007. ====Israel==== Following the vote by the Knesset, the Israeli legislature, in 2007 in favour of bills to ban lesbian and gay pride parades in Jerusalem, the Lesbian and Gay Coalition Against Racism criticised Tatchell, saying: Tatchell issued a statement opposing any boycott of Israel as a result of this.Peter Tatchell, \"Don't Boycott World Pride in Jerusalem \u2013 Tatchell\" , UK Gay News, 19 June 2006. ===Anglican and Catholic churches=== Peter Tachell behind Richard Dawkins, protesting Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom Tatchell criticised the Catholic Church and Pope Benedict XVI, whom he described as \"the ideological inheritor of Nazi homophobia\".\"Interview: Peter Tatchell's 40 years of campaigning\", Pink News, 15 December 2007, Antonio Fabrizio \"He'd like to eradicate homosexuality, but since he can't put LGBT people in physical concentration camps, is doing his best to put them in psychological concentration camps.\" Channel 4 indicated in June 2010 that Tatchell would be the presenter of a documentary film examining \"the current Pope's teachings throughout the world\". The announcement sparked criticism from some prominent British Catholics including Conservative politician Ann Widdecombe, who accused Channel 4 of trying to \"stir up controversy\". Tatchell stated as part of the announcement that the documentary \"will not be an anti-Catholic programme\". With respect to Anglicanism, he stated that \"it's very sad to see a good man like the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, going to such extraordinary lengths to appease homophobes within the Anglican Communion\".Irish Times, 25 July 2008, pg. 17 On 15 September 2010, Tatchell, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter, published in The Guardian, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK. In 2017 Tatchell praised the Church of England's new 'Valuing all God's Children' scheme for schools, which seeks to stop homophobic and transphobic bullying. ===Multiculturalism=== Tatchell has occasionally been moderately critical of multiculturalism. In 2010 he gave a speech to the Libertarian Alliance at the National Liberal Club arguing that British people are increasingly \"fragmented according to their different and sometimes competing identities, values, and traditions. These differences are prioritised over shared experiences and interests. Our common needs and the universalities of human rights are downplayed in favour of religious and racial particularities.\" ====Free speech==== In 2006, during the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Tatchell spoke at a 25 March 2006 rally called the Freedom of Expression Rally. At the rally, Tatchell argued for the \"disestablishment of the Church of England and the freedom to insult the Queen, Prime Minister and Archbishop of Canterbury.\" Tatchell said that the far-left is \"Mired in the immoral morass of cultural relativism, they no longer endorse Enlightenment values and universal human rights. Their support for free speech is now qualified by so many ifs and buts. When push comes to shove, it is more or less worthless.\"Gays in Eurabia \u2013 Muslim immigrants to Europe are threatening the rights of gays, women and free speech, metroweekly.com, 20 April 2006. In 2007, he wrote a Guardian opinion piece, arguing that \"The best way to tackle prejudice is by presenting facts and using reasoned arguments, to break down ignorance and ill-will.\" In 2016, Tatchell made threats to free speech in Britain the topic of his British Humanist Association annual conference lecture. Speaking with reference to a number of censorship controversies in the 2010s, he said that \"the recent trend against freedom of speech means that we must fight the battles of the Enlightenment all over again.\" Tatchell himself was accused of censorship when he threatened to sue an independent feminist book publisher for publishing a book that suggested that he was Islamophobic. The book publisher yielded, published a lengthy apology, and stopped publishing the book, but was eventually forced to shut down. In 2018 Tatchell voiced his support for Mark Meechan's conviction under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 for posting a \"grossly offensive\" video on YouTube. ===Islam=== Tatchell is critical of Islam, and first wrote about its rise in Britain in 1995. In 1995, he wrote that \"although not all Muslims are anti-gay, significant numbers are violently homophobic [...] homophobic Muslim voters may be able to influence the outcome of elections in 20 or more marginal constituencies.\" At the 2019 Conservative Party Conference he said he was \"jealous\" of Trevor Phillips when Mr. Phillips was nominated to be Islamophobe of the year - though he later suggested this was an ironic joke. He is critical of the UK government's All- Party Parliamentary Group definition of Islamophobia, suggesting that he tries \"to avoid the term\", that Muslimness is a vague and subjective term, and that the Islamophobia term is a \"a de facto threat to free speech and liberal values\" and \"virtue-signalling\". Tatchell has described the entire Sharia, which is the moral code that Muslims try to live by, as \"a clerical form of fascism\" and was the keynote speaker at a 2005 protest at the Canadian High Commission, demanding that Ontario's arbitration law, which permitted religious arbitration in civil cases for Jews and Christians, not be extended to Muslims. In 2017, Tatchell wrote to the organisers of Pride in London to defend the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain. The organisation, set up by Maryam Namazie, had previously held placards stating \"Allah is Gay\", \"Fuck Islam\", \"Islamophobia is an Oxymoron\" and \"East London Mosque incites murder of LGBT\". The East London Mosque, who had previously condemned homophobia and worked with Tatchell himself on seeking ways to combat it, disliked the placards but understood that they fell under the banner of free speech. However, he strenuously objected the suggestion that they incited murder as defamatory and brazenly incorrect. Tatchell stated \"East London Mosque has refused all dialogue with LGBT community. It refuses to meet LGBT Muslims. I have asked them 11 times since 2015\". Tatchell has previously condemned Islamophobia, saying \"any form of prejudice, hatred, discrimination or violence against Muslims is wrong. Full stop\". He described the Qur'an as \"rather mild in its condemnation of homosexuality\". He points out that much of his prison and asylum casework involves supporting Muslim prisoners and asylum seekers\u2014heterosexual, as well as LGBT. In 2006, he helped stop the abuse of Muslim prisoners at a Norwich jail and helped secure parole for other Muslim detainees.Sue Simkim, Anna Thomas-Betts, \"Prisoners or Detainees?\" Independent Monitor, The Association of Members of Independent Monitoring Boards, March 2008, Issue 93, pp. 12\u201315. Half his asylum cases are, he reports, male and female Muslim refugees. Two of his highest-profile campaigns involved Muslim victims\u2014Mohamed S, who was framed by men who first tried to kill him and then jailed him for eight years, and Sid Saeed, who brought a racism and homophobic harassment case against Deutsche Bank.Jamie Doward, \"Fallen City star claims gay bigotry: Deutsche Bank faces allegations of sexual discrimination against vice-president\", The Observer, 20 February 2005. Tatchell chose Malcolm X as his specialist subject when appearing on Celebrity Mastermind, explaining that he considered him an inspiration and hero (his other inspirations are Mahatma Gandhi, Sylvia Pankhurst and Martin Luther King Jr.). However, his endorsement of Bruce Perry's biography, in an article calling for black gay role models, led to criticism.Peter Akinti, the editor of Black in Britain, described the claim of homosexuality as \"shocking\" and \"inappropriate\", due to Perry's claim that Malcolm X had male lovers in his youth.According to Perry's book, Little (Malcolm X) occasionally engaged in sex with other men, usually, though not always, for money. In a Michigan boarding house, he raised rent money by sleeping with a gay transvestite ... Later, in New York, Little and some friends raised funds by being fellated by men at the YMCA where he lived (pg. 77) In Boston a man paid Little to undress him, sprinkle him with talcum powder, and bring him to orgasm.(Perry, pp. 82\u201383). In February 2010, Women Against Fundamentalism defended Tatchell against allegations of Islamophobia and endorsed his right to challenge all religious fundamentalism: \"WAF supports the right of Peter Tatchell and numerous other gay activists to oppose the legitimisation of fundamentalists and other right wing forces on university campuses, by the Left and by the government in its Preventing Violent Extremism strategy and numerous other programmes and platforms\". ====Muslim Council of Britain==== Tatchell describes the Muslim Council of Britain as \"anti-gay\", asking how can \"they expect to win respect for their community, if at the same time as demanding action against Islamophobia, they themselves demand the legal enforcement of homophobia?\". He noted that the MCB had joined forces with the \"rightwing Christian Institute\" to oppose every gay law reform from 1997 to 2006. In January 2006, the MCB Chairman Iqbal Sacranie said that homosexuals are immoral, harmful and diseased on BBC Radio 4. Tatchell argued that \"Both the Muslim and gay communities suffer prejudice and discrimination. We should stand together to fight Islamophobia and homophobia\". Tatchell subsequently criticised Unite Against Fascism for inviting Sacranie to share its platforms, describing him as a \"homophobic hate-mongerer.\" When the MCB boycotted Holocaust Memorial Day, partly because it was \"not sufficiently inclusive\", Tatchell wrote that \"the only thing that is consistent about the MCB is its opposition to the human rights of lesbians and gay men\". ====Muslims and gay rights==== In 2006, Tatchell wrote an opinion column in The Guardian arguing that Muslims deliberately conflate offence with violence, in an effort to suppress Muslim reformers in Britain. He argued that Islamist groups like Hizb ut-Tahrir in Britain see \"any criticism of Islam is an insult and that all such insults are unacceptable\" in order to suppress the \"free exchange of ideas\". The Muslim gay rights organisation IMAAN criticised Tatchell, saying, \"OutRage! doesn't understand our cultural and religious sensitivities. Often, the way they word and phrase their press releases can and does antagonise Muslims. Much as we\u2019ve invited them to meetings so we can talk about the best way to tackle Muslim LGBT issues, they insist on doing things their way.\" In the book \"Out of Place: Interrogating Silences in Queerness/Raciality\", in a chapter called \"Gay Imperialism: Gender and Sexuality Discourse in the 'War on Terror'\", Jin Haritaworn, Tamsila Tauqir and Esra Erdem wrote, \"rather than help, politics such as Tatchell's have worsened the situation for the majority of queer Muslims. It has become increasingly difficult for groups such as the Safra Project, who are forced into the frontline of the artificially constructed gay v. Muslim divide, to contest sexual oppression in Muslim communities. The more homophobia is constructed as belonging to Islam, the more anti-homophobic talk will be viewed as a white, even racist, phenomenon, and the harder it will be to increase tolerance and understanding among straight Muslims [...] The dialogue which Safra and other queer Muslim groups have long sought over this is more often than not ignored or disregarded, and white gay activists such as Tatchell have proved indifferent to the fact that the mud which they sling onto Muslim communities lands on queer Muslims themselves.\" Despite previously attending a \"rally for free expression\", where the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons were celebrated, Tatchell sued the small publisher Raw Nerve Books, who issued an apology, and replaced links to the book on their site with that apology, but were later forced to shut down. The Monthly Review described this as censorship, adding, \"the violent suppression of \"Gay Imperialism\" and the book in which it appeared also works as a warning to the authors, editors, and other critics and potential critics of Tatchell to better keep their mouths shut.\" ====Yusuf al-Qaradawi==== In July 2004, then- Mayor of London Ken Livingstone invited Yusuf al-Qaradawi to attend a talk called \"A woman's right to choose\" about the wearing of the hijab. Livingstone had read positive coverage of Qaradawi in The Guardian and The Sun. In October 2004, 2,500 Muslim academics from 23 countries condemned Qaradawi, and accused him of giving \"Islam a bad name and foster[ing] hatred among civilizations\" and \"providing a religious cover for terrorism\". Tatchell argued that Qaradawi expresses liberal positions to deceive the Western press and politicians, while being \"rightwing, misogynist, anti-semitic and homophobic\", using his books and fatwas to advocate female genital mutilation, blame for rape victims who dress immodestly, and the execution of apostates, homosexuals, and women who have sex outside marriage. Livingstone issued a 2005 dossier praising Qaradawi as a moderate, based on positive press coverage he had received previously. Livingstone pronounced that Tatchell has \"a long history of Islamophobia\", and asserted that he is in a \"de facto alliance with the American neo-cons and Israeli intelligence services.\" Tatchell strenuously denied the accusations, pointing out that he has never said any of the things that Livingstone accused him of saying. Livingstone continued to describe Qaradawi as \"one of the leading progressive voices in the Muslim world\" in 2010, after having been denied entry to the UK for his extremist views. Two years after condemning Tatchell, Livingstone stated he \"probably shouldn't\" have called Tatchell an \"Islamophobe\". ====Adam Yosef==== In December 2005, Respect Party activist Adam Yosef came under criticism for an article in Desi Xpress opposing registered civil partnerships. He asserted that Tatchell needed \"a good slap in the face\" and his \"queer campaign army\" should \"pack their bent bags and head back to Australia\". Desi Xpress staff expressed regret to Tatchell and gave him a right of reply, while Yosef apologised and retracted his article, claiming the \"slap in the face\" remark was a \"figure of speech\" and the remark about Australia was not racist. Yosef later backed Tatchell's 2009 election campaign. ===Secondary issues=== ====Environmental issues==== For over 20 years, Tatchell has written and campaigned about environmental problems including global warming and resource depletion, pointing out that they often have a disproportionately negative impact on developing countries. In the late 1980s, he was co-organiser of the Green and Socialist Conferences, which sought to ally reds and greens. He championed energy conservation and renewable energy; in particular tidal, wave and concentrated solar power. On 24 May 2009, he appeared on the BBC Daily Politics programme to oppose the Elephant and Castle regeneration scheme, which he said would bring few benefits to local working-class people. However, most of his campaigning continues to be in the areas of human rights and \"queer emancipation\". In August 2008 Tatchell wrote about speculative theories concerning possible atmospheric oxygen depletion compared to prehistoric levels, and called for further investigation to test such claims and, if proven, their long-term consequences.Peter Tatchell The Oxygen Crisis, The Guardian, Comment Is Free 13 August 2008. ==== Animal rights ==== Tatchell is an active supporter of animal rights, saying \"human rights and animal rights are two aspects of the same struggle against injustice\", and that he advocates for a \"claim to be spared suffering and offered inalienable rights\" for both humans and animals. ====Cornwall==== Tatchell campaigned on the issue of the constitutional status of Cornwall. In November 2008, The Guardian carried an article by him entitled Self-rule for Cornwall, in which he said: This article received the largest number of comments to any Guardian article, according to This is Cornwall. Over 1,500 comments were made, and while some comments were supportive, Tatchell found himself \"shocked and disgusted\" by the anti-Cornish sentiment shown by many commenters. ==Columnist and other pursuits== Tatchell has written numerous articles in newspapers and magazines related to his various campaigns. He was highly critical of the media coverage of the Admiral Duncan pub bombing, claiming than the homophobic attitudes of news outlets had helped fuel the attack, and that the press concerned themselves almost exclusively with the one heterosexual victim, rather than the two other deaths and the dozens of maimed patrons, saying that: On 5 August 1995 Tatchell was interviewed at length by Andrew Neil on his one-on-one interview show Is This Your Life?, made by Open Media for Channel 4.Listing on IMDb , he has been an Ambassador for the penal reform group, Make Justice Work. In 2011, he became the Director of the Peter Tatchell Foundation, a human rights organisation that seeks to promote and protect the human rights of individuals, communities and nations, in the UK and internationally, in accordance with established national and international human rights law. Tatchell is a patron of Humanists UK, an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society National Secular Society. Retrieved 27 July 2019 and a committed secularist, saying, \"As an atheist, secularist and humanist I believe that reason, science and ethics \u2013 not religious superstition \u2013 are the best way to understand the world and promote human rights and welfare.\" He contributes to The Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2. == Awards == In 2006, New Statesman readers voted him sixth on their list of \"Heroes of our time\".New Statesman Library \u2013 Articles by Peter Tatchell In 2009, he racked up multiple awards. He was named Campaigner of the Year in The Observer Ethical Awards, London Citizen of Sanctuary Award, Shaheed Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti Award (for reporting the Balochistan national liberation struggle), Evening Standard 1000 Most Influential Londoners (winning again in 2011), Liberal Voice of the Year and a Blue Plaque in recognition of his more than 40 years of human rights campaigning. In 2010 he won Total Politics Top 50 Political Influencers. A diary journalist reported rumours that he had been recommended for the award of a life peerage in the British New Year Honours. He was said to have turned it down. In 2012, the National Secular Society awarded Tatchell Secularist of the Year, in recognition of his lifelong commitment to the defence of human rights against religious fundamentalism. On 21 September 2012, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement award at the UK's first National Diversity Awards. Alongside Misha B, Jody Cundy, Peter Norfolk and others he was a patron for 2013 National Diversity Awards. In January 2014, Tatchell was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by De Montfort University. == Legacy == The Peter Tatchell Papers are held at the London School of Economics in the Hall Carpenter Archive.Peter Tatchell Papers, Hall-Carpenter Archives, the London School of Economics.
