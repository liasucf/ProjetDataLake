    "text": "Tripoli is a 1950 American adventure film directed by Will Price and written by Winston Miller. The film is a fictionalized account of the Battle of Derna at Derna, a coastal town in modern eastern Libya in April 1805 against Tripoli, one of the four Barbary states in North Africa and stars John Payne, Maureen O'Hara, Howard Da Silva, Phillip Reed, Grant Withers, Lowell Gilmore and Connie Gilchrist. The film was released on November 9, 1950, by Paramount Pictures. ==Plot== In 1805, the USS Essex is part of a blockade of the port of Tripoli by the small United States Navy Mediterranean squadron, targeting pirates menacing American shipping. American diplomatic Consul William Eaton (Herbert Heyes) comes on board to recruit a small commando squad for a secret mission. Lt. Presley O'Bannon, of the U.S. Marine Corps (John Payne) and Lt. Tripp (Lowell Gilmore) volunteer to raise a force to seize Derna, a strategic coastal town to the east. Hamet Karamanly (Phillip Reed), exiled former Pasha of Derna, supplies men in exchange for being restored to his throne which was taken by his brother. Countess Sheila D\u2019Areneau (Maureen O'Hara) stays with the Pasha, and everyone presumes she is his mistress, while she angles into persuading him to marry her. O'Bannon recruits a native force of mercenaries - Greeks, Turks and Arabs - to accompany his Marines and some American soldiers and Navy midshipmen. O'Bannon and Countess D\u2019Arneau meet and are attracted to each other, but both refuse to admit it to themselves. D\u2019Arneau convinces Hamet that the Americans plan to turn him over to his brother, but O\u2019Bannon gets him to change his mind. D\u2019Arneau defies O\u2019Bannon and accompanies the expedition from Alexandria, Egypt, across the North African deserts, but he forces her to travel with the camp followers. After a waterhole is poisoned, the expedition has to cross a dune sea to reach the next waterhole ahead of the poisoners. O\u2019Bannon kisses the countess and the force has to endure a sandstorm. Hamet\u2019s brother offers him a deal: half the kingdom in return for getting rid of the Americans. They reach the coast twelve days late and the American navy squadron under Commodore Samuel Barron is not yet there. There is almost a mutiny before the ships arrives. Hamet tells his brother the plan of attack on Derna. When the countess learns of this, she rides to warn O\u2019Bannon. He leads a surprise attack on the city and captures it. Lt. O\u2019Bannon and the countess become a couple. == Cast == *John Payne as Lt. Presley O'Bannon, USMC (1776-1850) *Maureen O'Hara as Countess Sheila D'Arneau *Howard Da Silva as Capt.
