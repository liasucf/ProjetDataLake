At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 he won Best Male Artist and Best Blues & Roots Album for his second album, Get Out While You Can (November 2009).

In 2017, Sultan's record Killer was nominated for three ARIA awards: Best Male Artist, Best Rock Album, and Best Independent Release. Sultan's debut children's music album Nali & Friends was named Best Children's Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2019. ==Early life== Daniel Leo Sultan was born in 1983. He spent much of his early life in Fitzroy (a suburb of Melbourne). His father is of Irish descent, a lawyer who once worked for the Aboriginal Legal Service. His mother, Roslyn Sultan, is an Indigenous Australian of the Arrernte and Gurindji people. When Sultan was three, the family visited his mother's ancestral lands in Yuendumu (300 kilometres north-west of Alice Springs) in the Tanami Desert; soon after they returned to Melbourne. When a teenager, his parents separated and he lived with his mother in Cairns for three years. At seventeen he returned to Fitzroy. Sultan started playing guitar at four and wrote his first song at ten. His mother's friend gave him an \"old, clapped-out electric guitar\" and, when living in Fitzroy, he began singing at local pubs. In 2000 he met Scott Wilson, a guitarist, at a Williamstown pub's karaoke night and the pair began writing tracks together. Wilson later recalled \"What struck me at first was that he could play piano and guitar and he was a great foil for what I was doing... After a while playing together he said, 'Can I sing this one?' I said, 'Do you know the words?'... [he had a] mighty voice. A lot of people can play guitar... Not many can sing like that.\" ==Personal life== ===2020 indecent assault charges=== On 28 February 2020, Sultan was charged with indecent assault by Victoria Police over a September 2008 incident in Coburg, Victoria. The charges led Sultan to withdraw from performing at the Perth Festival (which he was headlining), the Port Fairy Folk Festival (both scheduled to take place the following week), and the Parrtjima Festival in Alice Springs in April 2020. In a statement, police said: > \"A man from Connells Point, New South Wales has been charged with one count > of indecent assault.
