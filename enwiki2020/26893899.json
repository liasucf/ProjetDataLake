    "text": "Rabbi Shlomo HaKohen (; 1828\u20131905) was the famed Av Beis Din (supreme justice of a rabbinical court) and Posek (decider of Jewish Law) of Vilna. In 1828, Shlomo was born to Rabbi Yisroel Moshe HaCohen, a dayan in the rabbinic court in Vilna. As a young child, Shlomo was known for his diligence and devotion to Torah study. When Shlomo was thirteen years old, he became deathly sick and his doctors told him that he must stop studying Torah because the intensity of his studies was adversely affecting his weak heart. Nonetheless, Shlomo refused to relent, and continued to study Torah, as he reasoned that Torah is his life.Talelei Oros, English, Bamidbar HaKohen's glosses on the Talmud were published in the Vilna Edition Shas under the name \"Cheshek Shlomo\" (\u05d7\u05e9\u05e7 \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4). Rabbi Shlomo's halachik responsa were published under the title \"Binyan Shlomo\" (\u05e9\u05d5\"\u05ea \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05df \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4). HaKohen was a childhood friend of Rabbi Alexander Moshe Lapidus,Rav Alexander Moshe Lapidus ZT\"L, The Forgotten Gadol:A First- Time Comprehensive Biography also a native of Vilna. Rabbi Shlomo also corresponded with Rabbi Chaim Hezekiah Medini, who frequently praised and quoted from Rabbi Shlomo in his magnum opus, Sdei Chemed. His responsa have gained a position of prominence in halachic literature, and are frequently quoted. Rabbi Shlomo HaKohen was the editor of the Vilna Edition Shas, where he pored through various manuscripts to verify and establish an accurate version of the Talmud without the mistakes so prevalent in previous editions of the Talmud.Letter by Letter: The Story of the Romm Publishing House and the Vilna Shas As a critical scholar, Rabbi Shlomo HaKohen researched the text of Ketuvim based on various writings of the Vilna Gaon.The Vilna Gaon: A Man of Piety Rabbi Shlomo HaCohen was allegedly an enthusiastic supporter of the Mizrachi Religious Zionism movement. However, claims that Rabbi Shlomo honored Theodor Herzl by greeting him with a Torah scroll in hand and described him as the equivalent of the Jewish kings of the Biblical era are false. Rabbi Shlomo HaKohen was a great-grandfather of Rabbi Nochum Partzovitz.\"Sunset\", Hanoch Teller ==External links== * Responsa Binyan Shlomo (Volume 1, Volume 2) * Responsa Atzei Broshim (on Yoreh Deah) ==References== Category:Kohanim writers of Rabbinic literature Category:Lithuanian Orthodox rabbis Category:1828 births Category:1905 deaths Category:Rabbis of Vilnius Category:Exponents of Jewish law Category:Authors of books on Jewish law ",
