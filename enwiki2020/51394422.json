    "text": "The \u0160ahovi\u0107i massacre was a massacre of the Muslim population of the Yugoslav village of \u0160ahovi\u0107i (modern-day Toma\u0161evo in Montenegro) and neighbouring villages in the region of the Lower Kola\u0161in. It was committed on 9 and 10 November 1924 by a mob of 2,000 Orthodox Christian men from Kola\u0161in and Bijelo Polje that sought revenge for the earlier murder of Bo\u0161ko Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, governor of the area. The massacre was fueled by rumors which targetted local Muslim, anti-Yugoslav leader Jusuf Mehonji\u0107 as the perpetrator. In time, it became known that Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 was killed by members of a rival clan, the Rov\u010dani. In the aftermath of the massacre many Muslims fled from the region. ==Background== Bo\u0161ko Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, chief of Kola\u0161in county The motive for the massacre was the murder of Bo\u0161ko Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, the chief of the Kola\u0161in county. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 was murdered in an ambush by unknown assailants on 7 November 1924, while he travelled from Mojkovac to \u0160ahovi\u0107i. In this period, in much of Lower Kola\u0161in a group of anti-Yugoslav rebels were active. Their leader was Jusuf Mehonji\u0107 from \u0160ahovi\u0107i. The local Montenegrin authorities singled out Jusuf Mejonji\u0107 and the population of \u0160ahovi\u0107i as having being active in Bo\u0161kovi\u0107's murder and issued an order was issued on the same day to confiscate all weapons in possession of the population of \u0160ahovi\u0107i and Pavino Polje. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 was buried on 9 November 1924. In the speeches held during his funeral, the Orthodox population of \u0160ahovi\u0107i accused the Muslim population of \u0160ahovi\u0107i for his death. Adil Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107 emphasizes that \u0160ahovi\u0107i and Pavino Polje had been disarmed two days before the massacre. Local authorities arrested 31 men from \u0160ahovi\u0107i on 7 November 1924. After the events of the massacre, it emerged that the murderers of Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 were clan members from Rovca, a rival tribe to his own. ==Massacre== Jusuf Mehonji\u0107, local rebel Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107 concluded that the massacre was committed by armed men from Kola\u0161in and Bijelo Polje who coordinated their attack on \u0160ahovi\u0107i and Pavino Polje on the 19 km wide frontline. There are different estimates of the number of victims. Some sources estimate 600, while some sources up to 900, all of them emphasizing that many women and children were among victims. Some sources estimate the number of victims to be 3,000. According to the official report, the massacre was committed by villagers from Polja village in Kola\u0161in, members of the brotherhood of the murdered Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, who killed 120 Muslims and burned and robbed 45 houses. The massacre was described by Milovan \u0110ilas in the book Land without Justice, based on the testimony of his father Nikola, who participated in the massacre. == Aftermath == Muslim notables and leaders from \u0160ahovi\u0107i who survived the massacre wrote a memorandum to Yugoslav king. In the absence of appropriate reaction from Yugoslav government, all Muslims from \u0160ahovi\u0107i emigrated from their village, most of them to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many Muslims from the area of Bijelo Polje fled the region and emigrated to Turkey. == References == == Further reading == * * Alamanah, 45-46, ISSN 0354-5342, pages: 299-365, Podgorica, 2009 Category:Anti-Muslim violence in Europe Category:Mass murder in 1924 Category:Massacres in the 1920s Category:Persecution of Muslims by Christians Category:Bijelo Polje Municipality Category:Massacres in Yugoslavia Category:1924 in Yugoslavia Category:Bosniaks of Montenegro Category:November 1924 events Category:Massacres of Muslims ",
