Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a grade of B, commenting that \"there's an undeniable allure to the way the movie hovers in an ambiguous space between Luc's passions and their problematic connotations.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing, \"It is a watchable, insouciant love story with some great incidental performances, although there is a sense of the shark being jumped 30 minutes from the end.\" Boyd van Hoeij of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"Though set in the present, the grainy black-and-white images and [Jean-Louis] Aubert's familiar-sounding, piano-led score again lend the story something timeless.\" Meanwhile, Diego Semerene of Slant Magazine gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, writing, \"[Philippe] Garrel illustrates the absurdity behind the myth of the complementary couple with the same cynicism that permeates his previous work but none of the humor or wit.\" Guy Lodge of Variety wrote, \"A minor romantic roundelay that deviates little from the essential template of his last three films, it's very much the work of an artist less preoccupied with innovation than with signature craftsmanship.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 films Category:French drama films Category:French-language films Category:Films directed by Philippe Garrel Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:French films Category:Swiss films Category:Swiss drama films ",
