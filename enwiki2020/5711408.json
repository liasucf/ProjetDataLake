This decision could be due to potential future competition from the Starlink and OneWeb satellite constellations. One of the key technical differences is that low earth orbit satellites provide shorter latencies, because the signal doesn't have to travel 35,786 km (22,236 mi) back and forth to the geostationary orbit. ==Controversy== In March 2013, it was reported that American authorities were investigating the subsidiary for bribery.
