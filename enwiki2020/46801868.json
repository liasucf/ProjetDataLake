    "text": "Modimelanotide (INN) (code names AP-214, ABT-719, ZP-1480) is a melanocortinergic peptide drug derived from \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) which was under development by, at different times, Action Pharma, Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie, and Zealand for the treatment of acute kidney injury. It acts as a non-selective melanocortin receptor agonist, with IC50 values of 2.9 nM, 1.9 nM, 3.7 nM, and 110 nM at the MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5 receptors. Modimelanotide failed clinical trials for acute kidney injury despite showing efficacy in animal models, and development was not further pursued. == See also == * Afamelanotide * BMS-470,539 * Bremelanotide * Melanotan II * PF-00446687 * Setmelanotide == References == == External links == * Modimelanotide - AdisInsight * ZP1480 (ABT-719) Publications - Zealand Pharma Category:Melanocortin receptor agonists Category:Peptides Category:Abandoned drugs ",
