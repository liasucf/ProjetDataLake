    "text": "Wisconsin was settled largely by European immigrants in the late 19th century. This immigration led to the popularization of galops, schottisches, waltzes, and, especially, polkas. Classical composers and conductors from Wisconsin include Hans Balatka, Hugo Kaun, Eugene Luening, Theodore Steinmetz and Sarge Boyd. Among Wisconsin's contributions to rock music were Les Paul, an electric guitar pioneer known as the \"Wizard of Waukesha\". The Steve Miller Band, with Milwaukee's Steve Miller, had three #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 from 1973 to 1982. The Chordettes from Sheboygan, Bon Iver from Eau Claire, and Garbage from Madison all had albums on the Billboard 200. ==Genres== ===Indigenous music=== ===German- and Norwegian-American music=== The 1830s and 1840s brought European dances like the schottische, waltz, galop and, most importantly, the polka. The 1840s also saw massive immigration from Germany to Milwaukee, which became known as Deutsche Athen (German Athens). Groups formed, such as the Milwaukee Musical Society, to celebrate ethnic German music. Some important figures from this era include Christopher Bach, Hans Balatka, Eugene Luening and Hugo Kaun. While Germans moved to Milwaukee and eastern Wisconsin, Norwegians moved en masse to southern and western Wisconsin, and surrounding areas. Norwegian musicians, such as the violinist Ole Bull, were popular in Madison. New Glarus and Monroe saw a host of Swiss immigrants settle in the mid-1800s. Much like their German counterparts, these Swiss people established polka societies, many of which are still active today. ===Blues and jazz=== Musical output came from Grafton, Ozaukee County during the 1920s when Paramount Records released a series of blues and jazz recordings by artists from the South. Waukesha's Les Paul, enjoyed a long career as a blues, country, and jazz guitarist and musical innovator. known as the \"Wizard of Waukesha\" for his technological tinkering, was one of the pioneers of the solid-body electric guitar, helping to create the Gibson Les Paul and later the Gibson SG. Among the musicians he partnered with were his wife Mary Ford, with whom he recorded a version of How High the Moon in 1951. He also played with Jim Atkins, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters.
