Brings with her a rich humor for her authentic contextualizations, playing with the mannerisms of both eras, placing us as spectators who observe these outside universes, and even be able to signal the ridiculous aspects with which we have become accustomed by virtue of familiarization.\" However, she adds that her first three episodes \"stagger\", with the series proving to be more interesting in the ensuing episodes, for its symbolic veracity created between the 80's and 2010. Doktor Bruce of Freak Pop, said that the series \"it's simply ingenious\", and considers it one of the best Brazilian comedies, addressing the absurdities that occurred on Brazilian TV in the 80's, and that it seeks current elements about those people who try to remain in the media at all costs. ==References== ==External links== * Samantha! on Netflix * Category:2010s Brazilian television series Category:2018 Brazilian television series debuts Category:Brazilian comedy television series Category:Portuguese- language Netflix original programming Category:Portuguese-language television shows Category:Television shows filmed in S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Television shows set in S\u00e3o Paulo ",
