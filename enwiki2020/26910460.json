Hulbert became one of the studio's top stars during the early 1930s, often appearing with his wife Cicely Courtneidge. ==Critical reception== BFI Screenonline called the film a \"sublime musical comedy.\" and British Pictures called it \"one of those charmingly amateurish British musicals the 30s produced so well. It proclaims: we may not have dancers like Fred and Ginger, or songwriters like Gershwin or Berlin, or directors like Busby Berkeley, but when it comes to endearing silliness we're world class...Love on Wheels is never going to make the critics Top 100 list, it certainly leaves a smile on your face.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1932 films Category:British musical comedy films Category:1932 musical comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Victor Saville Category:Gainsborough Pictures films Category:Films set in London Category:British films Category:British black-and-white films Category:Films with screenplays by Franz Schulz Category:Films with screenplays by Victor Saville Category:1932 comedy films ",
