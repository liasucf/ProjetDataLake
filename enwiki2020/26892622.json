    "text": "Les mari\u00e9s de la tour Eiffel (The Wedding Party on the Eiffel Tower) is a ballet to a libretto by Jean Cocteau, choreography by Jean B\u00f6rlin, set by , costumes by Jean Hugo, and music by five members of Les Six: Georges Auric, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc and Germaine Tailleferre. The score calls for two narrators. The ballet was first performed in Paris in 1921. ==Background== The ballet had its genesis in a commission to Jean Cocteau and Georges Auric, from Rolf de Mar\u00e9 of the Ballets su\u00e9dois. Cocteau's original title for his scenario was The Wedding Party Massacre. It has been suggested that Raymond Radiguet, the young writer close to Cocteau at the time, made some contribution to the libretto.NYT, 17 April 1988, Dance View: The Irreverence of Cocteau Sparkles Once More Running short of time, Auric asked his fellow members of Les Six to also contribute music, and all of them did except Louis Durey, who pleaded illness. It was staged by the Ballets su\u00e9dois at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris on 18 June 1921, the principal dancers being C. Ari, J. Figoni, and K. Vahlander. The orchestra was conducted by D\u00e9sir\u00e9-\u00c9mile Inghelbrecht. The narrators were Jean Cocteau and Pierre Bertin.Classics online It had a brief moment of fame and even scandal, but then fell into oblivion, although it was given in New York City in 1923. A new production opened there in 1988. ==Story== The story of the ballet is somewhat nonsensical: : The new couple have a wedding breakfast on Bastille Day (July 14) at a table on one of the platforms of the famous tower. A guest makes a pompous speech. When a humpbacked photographer bids everyone to \"watch the birdie,\" it appears that a telegraph office suddenly springs into existence on the platform. A lion comes in and eats one of the guests for breakfast and a strange figure called \"a child of the future\" appears and kills everybody. Nevertheless, the ballet concludes with the end of the wedding.Classical Archives When asked what the ballet was about, Cocteau replied: \"Sunday vacuity; human beastliness, ready-made expressions, disassociation of ideas from flesh and bone, ferocity of childhood, the miraculous poetry of everyday life.\"Boise Weekly On 29 July 1923, in a letter, Francis Poulenc described the work as \"toujours de la merde ... hormis l'Ouverture d'Auric\" (\"yet more shit ... apart from Auric's Overture\").Barbara L. Kelly, Tradition and style in the works of Darius Milhaud 1912-1939 ==The ballet== The sections of the ballet are: * Overture (14 July) - Georges Auric * Marche nuptiale - Darius Milhaud * Discours du General (Polka) \u2013 Francis Poulenc * La Baigneuse de Trouville \u2013 Poulenc * La Fugue du Massacre \u2013 Milhaud * La Valse des Depeches \u2013 Germaine Tailleferre * Marche fun\u00e8bre \u2013 Arthur Honegger (in which he quotes the Waltz from Gounod's Faust) * Quadrille \u2013 Tailleferre * Ritournelles \u2013 Auric * Sortie de la Noce \u2013 Milhaud.Naxos ==Recordings== The score was unpublished until the first full recording of the work in 1966, which was supervised by Darius Milhaud.cocteau, satie & les six Les Mari\u00e9s was performed by the Delft student music company \"Krashna Musika\" in Delft, the Netherlands, on 2 May 1975, as part of the Student Music Festival \"Muzikaal Totaal\", conceived by Guus Ranke.
