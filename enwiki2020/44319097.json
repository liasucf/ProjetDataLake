Shortflix launched in May 2017 with the first five short films exploring subjects including black gay dancehall culture in London, homophobia in an Afro-Caribbean hair salon in Sheffield and a suicidal young man in Bath. In an interview with Game of Thrones actress, Ellie Kendrick, Norbury explains that the organisation was set up \"to combat the challenge that whilst talent might be everywhere, opportunity is not\" adding that Shortflix enables \"talented new filmmakers from diverse backgrounds to tell their story about their community and identity\". In 2020, Carrie Battram, Johnny Massahi, Danny Seymour, John Akinde, and Isabella Culver were announced as the next recipients of the scheme which also received a boost in funding from ScreenSkills, a London-based non-profit specialising in the promotion of new film talent. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Arts organisations based in England Category:British Film Institute Category:Film organisations in England Category:2011 establishments in England Category:Governance of England Category:Government agencies established in 2011 ",
