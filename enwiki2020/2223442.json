    "text": "The Little Hungarian Plain or Little Alf\u00f6ld (Hungarian: Kisalf\u00f6ld, Slovak: Mal\u00e1 dunajsk\u00e1 kotlina, German: Kleine Ungarische Tiefebene) is a plain (tectonic basin) of approximately 8,000 km\u00b2 in northwestern Hungary, south- western Slovakia (Podunajsk\u00e1 n\u00ed\u017eina \u2013 Danubian Lowland), and eastern Austria. It is a part of the Pannonian plain which covers most parts of Hungary. ==Geography== The territory of the LHP in Hungary Eszterh\u00e1zy family. Such buildings are typical in the area Its borders are the Carpathians on the north, the Bakony-V\u00e9rtes Hills in the south, the Gerecse Hills in the east, and the Leitha Mountains and the foothills of the Alps in the west. In Hungary, it includes most of Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron and Vas counties, and the western part of Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom and Veszpr\u00e9m. The plain is roughly cut in half by the Danube which is split up into many arms between Bratislava and Kom\u00e1rno, forming large islands. Its main tributaries are the V\u00e1h, the R\u00e1ba, the R\u00e1bca and the Marcal rivers. Smaller microregions of the Little Alf\u00f6ld are Hans\u00e1g, Seewinkel, Neusiedl Basin, R\u00e1bak\u00f6z, Szigetk\u00f6z, Marcali Basin, Moson Plain, Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom Plain and \u017ditn\u00fd ostrov. The neighbouring regions of Kemenesh\u00e1t, Sopron-Vas Plain and Steirisches H\u00fcgelland are sometimes classified as belonging to the Little Alf\u00f6ld, but Hungarian and Austrian geographers use the term in a more narrow meaning. ==History== The plain has been an important area of agriculture since the Neolithic Age. The southern part of it belonged to the Roman province of Pannonia between the 1st and 5th centuries and later was inhabited by Germanic and Slavic peoples and since about 900 also by Hungarians. Since about 1000, the region became part of the Kingdom of Hungary. After World War I the Little Alf\u00f6ld was divided between Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Austria. In the 1990s Slovakia built a large dam and power plant at Gab\u010d\u00edkovo. ==Population== Country borders don't closely follow linguistic boundaries, especially in the case of the northern part of the plain where Hungarians are a majority in the two southernmost districts Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda and Kom\u00e1rno and a minority in the remaining districts. There are also smaller groups of Croats in the tri-state border region. Important cities in the region are Gy\u0151r (HU), Kom\u00e1rom (HU), Kom\u00e1rno (SK), Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda (SK), Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky (SK), and Mosonmagyar\u00f3v\u00e1r (HU). ==See also== * Great Alf\u00f6ld * Sedimentary basin * Lowland Category:Plains of Austria Category:Landforms of Burgenland Category:Neusiedl am See District Category:Plains of Slovakia Category:Plains of Hungary Category:Geography of Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron County Category:Historical regions in the Kingdom of Hungary Category:Pannonian Plain ",
