    "text": "Luxembourg was represented by Dutch singer David Alexandre Winter, with the song '\"Je suis tomb\u00e9 du ciel\", at the 1970 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 21 March in Amsterdam. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster RTL. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Winter performed 8th in the running order, following the United Kingdom and preceding Spain. At the close of voting \"Je suis tomb\u00e9 du ciel\" had failed to pick up a single point, placing Luxembourg last of the 12 entries. This was the third and last time Luxembourg finished the evening at the foot of the scoreboard, and their only nul-points result. Winter's blank was the last zero prior to the introduction of the current 12 points voting system in 1975, and the next song to be totally shunned by all national juries would not come along until 1978.ESC History - Luxembourg 1970 ==See also== *Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1970 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970 Category:Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1970 in Luxembourg ",
