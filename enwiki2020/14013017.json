    "text": "What We Have Sown (2007) is the sixth album by The Pineapple Thief, recorded over the span of eight weeks during the development of Tightly Unwound (compare with 8 Days and 8 Days Later). The record was released through Cyclops Records as a \"thank you\" to the label for supporting the band before their departure for Kscope. Most of the album's songs are holdovers from earlier albums; \"All You Need to Know\" was written for 10 Stories Down, and \"Well, I Think That's What You Said?\" (formerly titled \"Blood on Your Hands\") and \"Take Me with You\" are outtakes from Little Man. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:The Pineapple Thief albums Category:2007 albums ",
