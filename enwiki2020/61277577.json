    "text": "Mount Tilley is a mountain summit located in the Gold Range of the Monashee Mountains in British Columbia, Canada. Situated west of the Columbia River and Upper Arrow Lake, this peak is visible from the Trans-Canada Highway, Revelstoke, and Revelstoke Mountain Resort ski area. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Begbie, to the east, with Tilley Lake set in the saddle between the two peaks. ==History== Mount Tilley was named for Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley (1818\u20131896), a Canadian politician and one of the Fathers of Confederation.Canadian Mountain Place Names - The Rockies and Columbia Mountains, Glen W. Boles, Roger W. Laurilla, William L. Putnam, Rocky Mountain Books, 2006, page 250. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1968 by Bruce Haggerstone and David P. Jones. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Tilley is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. Despite the modest elevation, the climate supports a small pocket glacier on the northeast face. Precipitation runoff from Mount Tilley drains north into Begbie Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River, or southwest into Wap Creek, a tributary of the Eagle River, which in turn is a tributary of the Fraser River. ==References== ==External links== * Weather: Mount Tilley * Mt.
