Barney in 1852. In 1862, the first Postmaster-General for the state of Queensland Thomas Lodge Murray Prior was appointed. A small convict era building was used as for postal services but was too far from the telegraph office. The Postmaster-General choose a half hectare site which was centrally located. The GPO in 1931 The building already located at the Queen Street site which once hosted women convicts was demolished in 1871. Freestone and bricks were sourced from local materials. The GPO was opened on 28 September 1872. In 1873, the Queensland Museum was housed in the General Post Office building, but moved in 1879 to the William Street building. In the same year a second wing, which was constructed by John Petrie was completed which allowed the telegraph office to move to the building, pleasing business customers. The building features deep verandahs and high ceilings. A clock mounted in the pediment positioned above the main entrance was once illuminated by a gas powered light. It was replaced by a smaller, electric clock. The first typewriter to be used in any post office in any Australian city was used at the GPO in 1892. Stamps and money orders were once available to customers outside the building via windows are now closed. The building has been listed on the Brisbane City Council Heritage Register. ==Gallery== Image:Brisbane_CBD.jpg|view of ANZAC Square, Post Office Square and the General Post Office, as seen from the Sofitel Hotel Image:Central-Station-and- Anzac-Square-from-Brisbane-GPO.jpg|View from Brisbane GPO - showing Post Office Square, Sofitel Hotel and Central Station File:Post Office Square and General Post Office in the background, Brisbane, February 2020.jpg |General Post Office, Brisbane -- as seen from Post Office Square Image:GPO- sunshine.jpg|General Post Office -- as seen from Post Office Square ==See also== * Other General Post Offices ==References== ==External links== * Further historical details Brisbane Category:Buildings and structures in Brisbane Category:Government buildings completed in 1872 Category:1872 establishments in Australia Category:Commonwealth Heritage List places in Queensland Category:Italianate architecture in Brisbane Category:Neoclassical architecture in Australia Category:Brisbane Local Heritage Register Category:Brisbane central business district Category:FDG Stanley buildings Category:Queen Street, Brisbane ",
