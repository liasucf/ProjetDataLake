The principality located on present-day Cambodia\u2013Vietnam border. It was ruled by Chinese refugees. The name of the principality was variously spelled as Hexian Zhen (\u6cb3\u4ed9\u93ae), Nangang (\u5357\u6e2f), Gangkou (\u6e2f\u53e3), Bendi (\u672c\u5e95) or Kundama (\u6606\u5927\u55ce) in Chinese, Phutthaimat () or Banthaimat () in Thai, Ponthiamas, Pontheaymas and Pontiano in French, Panthai-mas, Bantaimas, Pontiamas, Pontaimas, Bantay-mas, Banteay M'eas, Pontiamas, Pontiamasse, Po- taimat, Can Cao, Cancar, and infinite other variations.Nicholas Sellers, The Princes of H\u00e0-Ti\u00ean (1682-1867): the Last of the Philosopher-Princes and the Prelude to the French Conquest of Indochina: a Study of the Independent Rule of the Mac Dynasty in the Principality of H\u00e0-Ti\u00ean, and the Establishment of the Empire of Vietnam, Brussels, Thanh-long, 1983, p. 164. Many of the pronunciations were similar to Banteay Meas, thus confusing H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean with a nearby town Banteay Meas. ==History== H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean and its nearby area had been a part of Cambodia for a long time. In 18 century, a Chinese refugee, Mo Jiu (M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu), was granted the Khmer title Oknha (, \"marquess\") by Cambodian king. He was allowed to build a small town in the mouth of Mekong Delta. The colonial town was known as H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean in Vietnamese sources, while Cambodian called it Peam (). This area had a dual political structure: M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu ruled Chinese and Vietnamese; while local Khmers continued to be ruled by a Khmer governor, called Oknha Reacheasetthi (). However, Siamese sources called the H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean rulers Phraya Rachasethi (), thus confusing them with the Khmer governor. M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu switched allegiance to the Nguy\u1ec5n lords of Vietnam in 1707, just after an invasion by Siam. He received the Vietnamese rank h\u1ea7u (\"marquess\") from Nguy\u1ec5n lords. Since then, H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean was treated as a semi- autonomous region of Vietnam. However, as a vassal of Cambodia, H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean still paid taxes to Cambodian court. M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu died in 1736, his son M\u1ea1c Thi\u00ean T\u1ee9 (Mo Shilin) succeeded. A Cambodian army invaded H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean in 1739 but was utterly defeated. From then on, Cambodia did not try to resume H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean, H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean enjoyed full independence from Cambodia thereafter. M\u1ea1c Thi\u00ean T\u1ee9's reign saw the golden age of H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean. In 1758, H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean established Outey II as puppet king of Cambodia. After War of the second fall of Ayutthaya, M\u1ea1c Thi\u00ean T\u1ee9 tried to install Prince Chao Chui (, Chi\u00eau Th\u00fay in Vietnamese) as the new Siamese king, but was defeated by Taksin. H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean was completely devastated by Siamese troops in 1771, M\u1ea1c Thi\u00ean T\u1ee9 had flee to Tr\u1ea5n Giang (modern C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1). In there, he was sheltered by Nguy\u1ec5n lord. Two years later, Siamese army withdrew from H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean, and M\u1ea1c Thi\u00ean T\u1ee9 retook his principality. After T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion broke out, H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean supported Nguy\u1ec5n lords. Nguy\u1ec5n lords' regime was overthrown in 1777, M\u1ea1c Thi\u00ean T\u1ee9 refused to surrender to T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebels, and fled to Siam. He was thrown into prison by Taksin in 1780, most of his family members were executed. In this situation, a power vacuum developed. After Rama I crowned the new Siamese king in 1782, a Siamese general Phraya Thatsada (, Th\u00e1t X\u1ec9 \u0110a in Vietnamese) was sent to capture H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean. The town was occupied by rebels but soon was captured by Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh. However, \u00c1nh had to abandon it because he was attacked by T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army. In 1785, a Siamese army under Krom Luang Thepharirak was sent to help Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh. In the same time, M\u1ea1c T\u1eed Sinh was sent back to H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean by Rama I. When the Siamese fleet landed in Banteay Meas, an army under M\u1ea1c T\u1eed Sinh and Phraya Thatsada was to reinforce them. However, Siamese fleet was defeated by T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army in Battle of R\u1ea1ch G\u1ea7m-Xo\u00e0i M\u00fat. M\u1ea1c T\u1eed Sinh and Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh fled to Siam. Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh returned to Vietnam and retook Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh (present-day H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City) in 1787. In the same time, M\u1ea1c T\u1eed Sinh was sent back to help Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh. Chinese researcher Dai Kelai (\u6234\u53ef\u6765) stated that M\u1ea1c T\u1eed Sinh was probably a puppet ruler installed by Siam. Not long after M\u1ea1c T\u1eed Sinh died, Ng\u00f4 Ma (\u5433\u9b54) briefly served as acting ruler. Ng\u00f4 Ma was probably the same person Th\u00f4ng ng\u00f4n A Ma (\u901a\u8a00\u963f\u6469, lit. \"A Ma, the interpreter\"), a Siamese who served as a Vietnamese interpreter during Taksin's reign. Maha Sura Singhanat appointed M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng B\u00ednh as the new ruler of H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean in 1789. However, when M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng B\u00ednh arrived in Vietnam, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh appointed him the governor of Long Xuy\u00ean. It made Singhanat very angry, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh had to send him back to H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean. M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng B\u00ednh died in 1792; two generals, Tr\u1ea7n Hanh (\u9673\u4ea8) and Tr\u1ea7n T\u00f4 (\u9673\u8607) were appointed acting rulers by Siam. In 1800, M\u1ea1c T\u1eed Thi\u00eam was appointed the new ruler by Siam, and sent back to H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean. Since 1803, H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean was subjected to the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh (Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Th\u00e0nh). M\u1ea1c T\u1eed Thi\u00eam went to Bangkok to attend Anurak Devesh's funeral in 1807. During his absence, M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng Du was appointed the acting ruler by Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh. M\u1ea1c T\u1eed Thi\u00eam died in 1809. Since then, Vietnamese Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty managed to appoint the ruler of H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean directly. Feared of provoking Siamese, Ng\u00f4 Y Nghi\u1ec5m (\u5433\u4f9d\u513c) and L\u00ea Ti\u1ebfn Gi\u1ea3ng (\u9ece\u9032\u8b1b) were appointed quy\u1ec1n l\u0129nh tr\u1ea5n s\u1ef1 (\u6b0a\u9818\u93ae\u4e8b, \"acting governor\") instead of tr\u1ea5n th\u1ee7 (\u93ae\u5b88, \"governor\"). The Vietnamese managed to eliminate the influence of M\u1ea1c family in this area. In 1818, M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng Du was appointed the ruler of H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean, however, he was only an official under Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty. M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng Du retired in 1829, his younger brother M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng T\u00e0i succeeded. H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean tr\u1ea5n was disestablished in 1832. H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean Province was formed in its area. L\u00ea V\u0103n Kh\u00f4i revolt broke out in 1833, M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng Du, M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng T\u00e0i, their sons M\u1ea1c H\u1ea7u Hy (\u911a\u4faf\u71ba) and M\u1ea1c H\u1ea7u Di\u1ec7u (\u911a\u4faf\u8000), accepted official posts from rebels. All of them were arrested and taken to Hu\u1ebf. In the same year, M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng Du and M\u1ea1c C\u00f4ng T\u00e0i died in prison. Later, M\u1ea1c H\u1ea7u Hy fled to Siam. ==List of H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean rulers== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Personal name ! Vietnamese title ! Siamese title ! Khmer title ! Reign !
