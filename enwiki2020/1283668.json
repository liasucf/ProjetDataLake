    "text": "Burkholderia is a genus of Proteobacteria whose pathogenic members include the Burkholderia cepacia complex, which attacks humans and Burkholderia mallei, responsible for glanders, a disease that occurs mostly in horses and related animals; Burkholderia pseudomallei, causative agent of melioidosis; and Burkholderia cepacia, an important pathogen of pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The Burkholderia (previously part of Pseudomonas) genus name refers to a group of virtually ubiquitous Gram-negative, obligately aerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that are motile by means of single or multiple polar flagella, with the exception of Burkholderia mallei, which is nonmotile. Members belonging to the genus do not produce sheaths or prosthecae and are able to use poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) for growth. The genus includes both animal and plant pathogens, as well as some environmentally important species. In particular, B. xenovorans (previously named Pseudomonas cepacia then B. cepacia and B. fungorum) is renowned for being catalase positive (affecting patients with chronic granulomatous disease) and its ability to degrade chlororganic pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls. The conserved RNA structure anti-hemB RNA motif is found in all known bacteria in this genus. Due to their antibiotic resistance and the high mortality rate from their associated diseases, B. mallei and B. pseudomallei are considered to be potential biological warfare agents, targeting livestock and humans. ==History== The genus was named after Walter H. Burkholder, plant pathologist at Cornell University. The first species placed in the genus were transfers from Pseudomonas, on the basis of various biochemical tests. Until recently, the genus Burkholderia was inclusive of all Paraburkholderia species. However, the genus Paraburkholderia is phylogenetically distinct, and can be distinguished from all Burkholderia species on the basis of molecular signatures that are uniquely found for each genus. ==Taxonomy== Burkholderia species form a monophyletic group within the Burkholderiales order of the Betaproteobacteria. Currently, the 48 validly named species can be distinguished from related genera (i.e. Paraburkholderia) and all other bacteria by conserved signature indels in a variety of proteins. These indels represent exclusive common ancestry shared among all Burkholderia species. The genus has three distinct monophyletic clusters. One group consists of all species belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex, another clade comprises B. pseudomallei and closely related species, and the last clade encompasses of most of the phytogenic species within the genus, including B. glumae and B. gladioli . Conserved signature indels are specific for each of these subgroups within the genus that aid in demarcating members of this extremely large and diverse genus. ==Species== List of species: *Burkholderia alpina *Burkholderia ambifaria *Burkholderia anthina *Burkholderia arboris *Burkholderia cenocepacia *Burkholderia cepacia *Burkholderia contaminans *Burkholderia diffusa *Burkholderia dolosa *Burkholderia gladioli *Burkholderia glumae *Burkholderia humptydooensis *Burkholderia lata *Burkholderia latens *Burkholderia mallei *Burkholderia metallica *Burkholderia multivorans *Burkholderia oklahomensis *Burkholderia plantarii *Burkholderia pseudomallei *Burkholderia pseudomultivorans *Burkholderia puraquae *Burkholderia pyrrocinia *Burkholderia seminalis *Burkholderia singaporensis *Burkholderia singularis *Burkholderia stabilis *Burkholderia stagnalis *Burkholderia territorii *Burkholderia thailandensis *Burkholderia ubonensis *Burkholderia vietnamiensis ==See also== *MAEB RNA motif ==References== ==External links== * Burkholderia genomes and related information at PATRIC, a Bioinformatics Resource Center funded by NIAID * Pathema-Burkholderia Resource * Burkholderia Genome Database Category:Burkholderiales Category:Bacteria genera Category:Anti-agriculture weapons ",
