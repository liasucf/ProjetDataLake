    "text": "International versions of Dancing with the Stars (map correct ) Dancing with the Stars is the name of various international television series based on the format of the British TV series Strictly Come Dancing, which is distributed by BBC Studios, the commercial arm of the BBC. Currently the format has been licensed to 60 territories. Versions have also been produced in dozens of countries across the world. As a result, the series became the world's most popular television program among all genres in 2006 and 2007, according to the magazine Television Business International, reaching the Top 10 in 17 countries. The show pairs a number of well known celebrities with professional ballroom dancers, who each week compete by performing one or more choreographed routines that follow the prearranged theme for that particular week. The dancers are then scored by a panel of judges. Viewers are given a certain amount of time to place votes for their favorite dancers, either by telephone or (in some countries) online. The couple with the lowest combined score provided by the judges and viewers is eliminated. This process continues until there are only two or three couples left; when they have competed for the last time one couple is declared the champion and wins a trophy. ==DWTS Global== ===International versions=== Original Version Currently airing Upcoming season Status unknown No longer airing Canceled for Covid 19 reasons {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:95%; line-height:18px; width:100%;\" |- !

In mainland China it is aired on Hunan Television and in Hong Kong on TVB Jade.

Each broadcaster provides five male and five female dancers, for a total of twenty. Pairs were determined by audience SMS votes. The programme began airing in late 2007, in order to mark the anniversary of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the UK to the People's Republic of China. ===India=== The Indian version is called Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa.

The celebrity dancers on Nach Baliye are real life couples, and work with an assigned choreographer. The dancers on Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa have one celebrity paired with a trained dancer/choreographer.

This one ran from 8 April 2006, to 17 March 2007 on NTV-4. ===South Korea=== The show () has aired on MBC TV since June 10, 2011, and is hosted by Lee Deok-hwa, with co-host Lee So-raIntroduction of two hosts at the official website.Introduction of contestants at the official website. in Season 1 while former contestant Kim Gyu-ri co-hosted the second season.
