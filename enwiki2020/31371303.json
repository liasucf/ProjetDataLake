The 1020 was based on a plotter mechanism manufactured by ALPS. The same mechanism formed the basis of several other low-cost plotters produced around the same time, including the Commodore 1520, the Oric MCP40, the Tandy/Radio Shack CGP-115, the Texas Instruments HX-1000 and the Mattel Aquarius 4615. However, the 1020 connected via the Atari 8-bit's proprietary SIO interface,ANTIC VOL. 4, NO. 5 / SEPTEMBER 1985 / PAGE 42 (), \"the 1020 daisy chains right into one of your disk drive ports\" eliminating the need for an 850 serial/parallel interface module, but limiting its use to Atari 8-bit computers. The 1020 was capable of 20-, 40- and 80-column text and graphics using a friction-fed roll of paper approximately 11.5 cm (4.5 inches) in width. Graphics were generated using one of four coloured pensThe Atari 1020 Color Printer Owners' Guide to draw lines, using a combination of the horizontally moving pen barrel and the vertically scrolling paper to create diagonal lines. Control of the plotter was possible from Atari BASIC.ANTIC VOL. 4, NO. 10 / FEBRUARY 1986 / PAGE 29 () ==References== ==External links== * COMPUTE!
