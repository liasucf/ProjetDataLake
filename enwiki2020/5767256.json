    "text": "The Horn family coat of arms features a black drinking horn on yellow background Horn () is a Swedish noble family from Finland, known since the 14th century. Its first known member, Olof Mattsson, is documented between 1381 and 1415, having a seat in Halikko parish.Carlquist, Gunnar (red.) (1932). Svensk uppslagsbok. Malm\u00f6: Svensk Uppslagsbok AB:s f\u00f6rlag, band 13 s. 312. His seal featured the figure of a drinking horn. Like other Swedish noble families of medieval origin, the family name wasn't used as a surname before the 16th century. Several descendants of Olof Mattsson have been ennobled under extended versions of the family name. Today, only one of these branches still exists, as recognized by the Swedish House of Nobility. After the Finnish war, the Horn family remained in Sweden, and was not introduced in the new Finnish House of Nobility. ==Branches== ===Horn af \u00c5minne=== After Klas Horn, raised to baron (sw. friherre) under the name Horn af \u00c5minne in 1561. In 1772 brothers Fredric and Gustaf Adolf Horn af \u00c5minne were raised to counts under the same name. The name derives from the manor \u00c5minne in Halikko, which was in the possession of the family from the 14th century to 1782. Members of the Horn af \u00c5minne branch include: * Klas Horn af \u00c5minne (1517\u20131566), admiral of the Swedish navy. * Clas Fredrik Horn af \u00c5minne (1763\u20131823), part of the conspiracy to murder King Gustav III. * Catharina Ebba Horn af \u00c5minne (1720\u20131781) * Henric Horn af \u00c5minne (1880\u20131947), participant in the 1912 olympics. ===Horn af Kanckas=== Registered as a noble family in 1625.
