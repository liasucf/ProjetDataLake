    "text": "The Affiche rouge The Affiche Rouge (Red Poster) is a famous propaganda poster, distributed by Vichy France and German authorities in the spring of 1944 in occupied Paris, to discredit 23 French Resistance fighters, members of the Manouchian Group. The term Affiche Rouge also refers more broadly to the circumstances surrounding the poster's creation and distribution, the capture, trial and execution of these members of the Manouchian Group. == Background == In mid-November 1943, the French police arrested 23 members of the Communist Francs-Tireurs et Partisans de la Main d'Oeuvre Immigr\u00e9e (FTP-MOI), who were part of the French Resistance.St\u00e9phane Courtois, Denis Peschanski and Adam Rayski: Le Sang de l'\u00e9tranger. Les Immigr\u00e9s de la MOI dans la R\u00e9sistance, Fayard, Paris 1989 They were called the \"Manouchian Group\" after the commander, Missak Manouchian. The group was part of a network of about 100 fighters, who committed nearly all acts of armed resistance in the Paris metropolitan region between March and November 1943.Ars\u00e8ne Tchakarian: Les franc-tireurs de l'affiche rouge, Messidor/\u00c9ditions sociales, 1986 Its membership included men of different backgrounds. 22 of them were Poles, five Italians, three Hungarians, two Armenians, three Spaniards, 1 French man and a Romanian woman; eleven members of them were of Jewish.Laurent L\u00e9vy, \"M\u00e9moire du groupe des \u00e9trangers: \u00c0 propos d\u2019une chanson c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\", Les mots sont important, Septembre 2009, accessed 3 Sep 2010 origin After having been tortured and interrogated for three months, the 23 were tried by a German military court. To discredit the Resistance, the authorities invited French celebrities (from the world of the cinema and other arts) to attend the trial and encourage the media to give it the widest coverage possible. All but one of the Manouchian Group's members were executed before a firing squad in Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien on 21 February 1944. Olga Bancic, who had served the group as a messenger, was taken to Stuttgart, where she was beheaded with an axe on 10 May 1944. In the spring of 1944, the Vichy authorities launched a propaganda campaign, designed to discredit the Manouchian Group and defuse public anger over their execution. They created a poster, which became known as , due to its red background. It featured ten men of the group, with nationality, surnames, photos and descriptions of their crimes; the Germans distributed an estimated 15,000 copies of the poster. Along with these posters, the Germans handed out flyers that claimed the Resistance was headed by foreigners, Jews, unemployed people, and criminals; the campaign characterized the Resistance as a \"foreigners' conspiracy against French life and the sovereignty of France\": > \"Si des Fran\u00e7ais pillent, volent, sabotent et tuent... Ce sont toujours des > \u00e9trangers qui les commandent. Ce sont toujours des ch\u00f4meurs et des criminels > professionnels qui ex\u00e9cutent. Ce sont toujours des juifs qui les inspirent. > C\u2019est l\u2019arm\u00e9e du crime contre la France. Le banditisme n\u2019est pas > l\u2019expression du Patriotisme bless\u00e9, c\u2019est le complot \u00e9tranger contre la vie > des Fran\u00e7ais et contre la souverainet\u00e9 de la France.\" Although the poster attempted to depict the group as \"terrorists\", the campaign seems to have had the effect of highlighting the feats of people whom the general public considered to be freedom fighters.Film documentary on the website of the Cit\u00e9 nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration Legend has it that supporters scribbled the words MORTS POUR LA FRANCE across the posters (\"They died for France\" - the phrase used on official monuments to soldiers of France who died in combat) and put flowers beneath some of the posters. In 1975, historian Philippe Ganier Raymond claimed that there was no historical record of such activity.Philippe Ganier Raymond, L'Affiche rouge: La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur les partisans sacrifi\u00e9s, Fayard, 1975 But more recent research has in fact confirmed that such additions by residents took place. == Legacy == Memorial to the Manouchian GroupIn 1955, Louis Aragon wrote a poem memorializing the Manouchian Group, \"Strophes pour se souvenir\". The poem was published in 1956 in Le roman inachev\u00e9. In 1959 L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9 set it to music and recorded it as . Rouben Melik and Paul \u00c9luard also wrote poems in honour of the Manouchian Group.R\u00e9sistance. Rouben Melik, \"l\u2019Affiche rouge Fusill\u00e9s\" , reprinted, L'Humanit\u00e9, 21 February 2004 Paul \u00c9luard, \"L\u00e9gion\" (poem) , in L'Humanit\u00e9, 21 February 2004 In 1997, at the prompting of Robert Badinter, a French senator and former Minister of Justice, the French Parliament authorized a monument to commemorate the execution at Mont-Val\u00e9rien of 1,006 citizens and members of the French Resistance, including the Manouchian Group, between 1940 and 1944. The sculptor Pascal Convert was commissioned to create the monument and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin dedicated it on 20 September 2003. == Controversy == In the 1980s, some French political factions suggested that, because of political infighting, some members of the Resistance had been complicit in the capture of many of the members of the Manouchian Group. A film documentary by St\u00e9phane Courtois and Mosco Boucault, Des terroristes \u00e0 la retraite, broadcast by Antenne 2 in 1983, included interviews of surviving FTP-MOI members and families of the victims. Bouscault accused the French Communist Party (PCF) of having deliberately sacrificed the fighters in the power struggle with the Gaullists for control over the National Council of Resistance (CNR). He suggested this was done because the fighters' foreign origins undermined French depictions of the Resistance as a native patriotic movement. The film was rebroadcast in 2001, minus 12 minutes deleted to reflect more recent historical research.\"Avec ou sans guillemets\" , L'Humanit\u00e9, 18 February 2004 La traque de l'Affiche rouge, a documentary produced by Denis Peschanski and Jorge Amat, broadcast by France 2 on 15 March 2007, refuted Courtois and Boucault's allegations.Denis Peschanski \u2013 Jorge Amat, La traque de l\u2019Affiche rouge, 72 minutes, compagnie des Phares et Balises en collaboration avec la Fondation Gabriel P\u00e9ri et L\u2019Humanit\u00e9, 2006. Resume of the film \"Les h\u00e9ros de l\u2019Affiche rouge\" , L'Humanit\u00e9, 13 February 2007 Quoting the historian Denis Peschanski, who had access to new documents from the Russian, French and German archives, the new documentary alleged that the fall of the Manouchian Group had been due exclusively to the French police. The two newly created branches of the Renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux (RG) intelligence agency\u2014the Brigades sp\u00e9ciales 1 and 2\u2014had trailed the R\u00e9sistance fighters for months. On 28 September 1943, Marcel Rayman, with several others, shot and killed the SS General Julius von Ritter.Susan Zuccotti, The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews, University of Nebraska Press, 1999, p. 270; Jewish partisans in France , United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Accessed 2013-02-02. Ritter organized the forced labor of the Service du travail obligatoire (STO). At that time, Rayman had already been under surveillance for two months. The French Milice arrested and dismantled the Manouchian Group after the attack, aided by information given by some members under torture. In September 2009, the dramatic film L'Arm\u00e9e du crime opened in France, featuring the story of the Manouchian Group. Directed by Robert Gu\u00e9diguian, a Marseille-based filmmaker of German and Armenian parentage, it was adapted from a story by Serge Le P\u00e9ron. It reflects some of the divisions among the R\u00e9sistance.STEPHEN HOLDEN, \"'The Army of Crime': Outsiders in French Society, Battling Occupiers and Collaborators\", New York Times, 19 Aug 2010, accessed 17 Nov 2010 In association with the film's release, reporters interviewed the last surviving member of the FTP-MOI group, Ars\u00e8ne Tchakarian. He decisively refuted the allegation that the PCF had betrayed the Manouchian Group and said that 35 members of the 40 in the group were communists.\" 'L\u2019Arm\u00e9e du crime': An Interview with Ars\u00e8ne Tchakarian.
