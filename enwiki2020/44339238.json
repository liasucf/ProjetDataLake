The original Top Cat cartoon, which ran on ABC from 1961 to 1962, has already gained massive popularity in Latin America during the time of its run, mainly due to the show's well-performed dubbing and translation. The film was in development for 10 months. While expressing their 'confidence', getting the rights of a Hanna-Barbera property was difficult for the producers. The company's rights to develop a film based on Top Cat has been previously accomplished for the 2011 film, so Warner Bros., the current owner of all HB properties, have maintained the same 'confidence' of working with the Mexican animation studio. Producer Jose C. Garcia de Letona called the film \"a work of persuasion and persistence\" since he also stated that the company \"knows and understands the character\". Director Andr\u00e9s Couturier, who has also directed another film adaptation of a classic animation property, Kung-Fu Magoo based on Mr. Magoo, has been attached to direct the animated prequel film since he has grew up watching the original Hanna-Barbera cartoon, stating that the character has \"influenced\" him. \"Some people say that the Don Gato (Top Cat) [character] in this movie looks a lot like me, [and] I think I [do] look a lot like him because my whole childhood was very influenced by the character, so I worked with a character who was with you during all your childhood [which] is incredible,\" said Couturier. ===Animation=== Unlike the previous film, which was animated in 2D Adobe Flash, the film was animated entirely in computer- generated imagery, according to producer Jose Garcia de Letona. Animation production is handled by Discreet Arts Productions in India, which previously collaborated with \u00c1nima's past CG project, Guardians of Oz. The animation process was an 'important' step for the entire company. Producer Garcia de Letona has admitted that, despite the studio's interest for 2D animated productions, they wanted to reach a wider market focused on CG distribution. \"[It's] a style that catches the attention of distributors,\" he said. Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez, the film's art director, stated that the film's animation was a \"challenge\" due to the production's full transition to CG. \"It was a challenge[.] [I]t seemed important to preserve the graphic and aesthetic essence of the original series [-] that the character was still Don Gato (Top Cat) despite having been translated into this new volumetric universe,\" said Gonz\u00e1lez. Gonz\u00e1lez, who also worked for the preceding film, was not a fan of the original cartoon at the time, but recognizing the popularity between in Latin America and the United States. \"I did not watch the series at the time[.] I knew it was broadcast, but I think it was very small,\" he said. Gonz\u00e1lez also added that he, \"had a great opportunity in the first film, [where] I had to do conceptual art, which is a great pride. I did not live in that era of Don Gato (Top Cat), so it was my turn when interest opened with the new film and now, with 'Don Gato, El Incio de la Pandilla' (Top Cat: The Start of the Gang), we are trying to present a new version for the new generations.\" ===Writing=== The film's screenplay is written by James Krieg (known for writing the Scooby-Doo television shows), Doug Langdale, and Jorge Ram\u00edrez-Su\u00e1rez. To help the plot match the premise of the original cartoon, Warner Bros. Animation has accompanied with the film's writing process, to which producer Garcia de Letona calls it \"welcom[ing] and grateful[...]\" ===Casting=== For the English version, Jason Harris Katz, the voice of Top Cat and other characters from the first film, has announced via his Twitter that he will reprise his role as the same character. It was also announced that voice actors Chris Edgerly, Bill Lobley, Hope Levy, and David Hoffman, have also joined the English cast. ===Soundtrack=== The film was composed by Leoncio Lara, who said \"we wanted to show the spirit of the original show and that meant the music we wanted to keep that jazz Broadway feel to the movie but update it so it can fit the cinematic approach\". The film also had popular pop and recognisable songs to get the kids to see the movie. ==Release== The film's Mexican release trailer premiered on 1 July 2015, followed by second trailer, released on 14 September 2015. The film was released on 30 October 2015 in Mexico, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures Mexico and confirmed to release in the rest of Latin America. The film is followed by a United Kingdom release on 27 May 2016, distributed by Kaleidoscope Film Distribution and Warner Bros. Pictures UK. \"We are very excited to be working with \u00c1nima Estudios, [by] bringing this latest chapter of Top Cat to a worldwide audience,\" said Spencer Pollard, CEO of KFD. \"As a leading global animation brand, we\u2019re looking forward to T.C. and his friends hitting [the] screens everywhere in 2016.\" The film's UK release and English-language trailer was released on 8 March 2016.Top Cat Begins UK TRAILER 1 (2016) YouTube ===Box office=== On its opening weekend in Mexico, the film debuted at No. 3 with a gross of $18.1 million pesos ($1.09 million USD), performing weaker than its predecessor.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 17%, based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 3/10. (in Spanish) (in Spanish) Carlos Del R\u00edo of Cine Premiere gave this film a 1 star rating, saying that the film has \"[c]heated again. [The] Top Cat film fails to approach the spirit and humor of the TV series.\" (in Spanish) Eddie Harrison, writing in The List, gave the film 3/5 stars, saying, \"The feline favourite returns for a likeably familiar, knockabout animation. As with J. J. Abrams' first Star Trek movie, there's a reasonable amount of fun in seeing how the iconic characters originally met each other...director Andr\u00e9s Couturier's film wisely scales things down as it attempts to get back to the comedic values of its source material.\" British critic Mark Kermode was scathing, describing the film as \"tooth-gratingly terrible\". ==See also== * Top Cat * Top Cat: The Movie * \u00c1nima Estudios * List of films based on Hanna- Barbera cartoons ==References== ==External links== *Official website (in Spanish) * * Category:Top Cat films Category:Top Cat Category:2015 films Category:2015 3D films Category:2015 computer-animated films Category:2010s American animated films Category:2010s children's comedy films Category:2010s children's fantasy films Category:English-language films Category:Animated films about cats Category:Films based on television series Category:Films using computer-generated imagery Category:Mexican fantasy films Category:Mexican animated films Category:Indian animated films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Warner Bros. animated films Category:\u00c1nima Estudios films Category:Hanna-Barbera animated films Category:2010s children's animated films Category:Films set on trains Category:3D animated films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Animated films based on animated series Category:2015 comedy films ",
