    "text": "Lahamu (also Lakhamu, Lachos, Lumasi, or Assyro-Akkadian Lammasu) was the first-born daughter of Tiamat and Abzu in Akkadian mythology. With her brother Lahmu she is the mother of Anshar and Kishar, who were in turn parents of the first gods. Lahamu is sometimes seen as a serpent, and sometimes as a woman with a red sash and six curls on her head. It is suggested that the pair were represented by the silt of the sea-bed, but more accurately are known to be the representations of the zodiac, parent-stars, or constellations. == References == Michael Jordan, Encyclopedia of Gods, Kyle Cathie Limited, 2002 Category:Mesopotamian goddesses Category:Dragons Category:Offspring of Tiamat Category:Characters in the En\u00fbma Eli\u0161 ",
