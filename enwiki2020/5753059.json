He has also played in the NBA for the Chicago Bulls, Oklahoma City Thunder, Atlanta Hawks, and Utah Jazz, in the Turkish Basketball League for the Fenerbah\u00e7e, in France for \u00c9lan Chalon, in Italy for Angelico Biella, and in Switzerland for Vevey Riviera Basket. In 2006, he became the first player from Switzerland to play in the NBA, and in 2013, he was labelled the best Swiss basketball player of all-time by Swiss newspaper Freiburger Nachrichten.Der neue Nati-Trainer Petar Aleksic soll das Unm\u00f6gliche m\u00f6glich machen ==Early life== Sefolosha was born in Vevey, Switzerland to Patrick Sefolosha, a black South African musician, and Christine Sefolosha (n\u00e9e Beck), a Swiss artist. In his youth, he has visited and lived in several countries. He speaks French, Italian and English.\"Thabo Sefolosha: Coming to America.\" NBA: September 14, 2006. ==Professional career== ===Early years (2001\u20132006)=== Sefolosha was invited to join the junior Swiss national basketball team, and at 17 he began a professional career with Tege Riviera Basket, in Switzerland's top domestic league. On a team trip to France, Sefolosha was approached by a French talent scout to play with Elan Chalon in the premier pro league in France. Sefolosha spent his first year in Chalon- sur-Sa\u00f4ne playing with the junior under-21 squad, which traveled alongside the senior club. The following year (2002\u201303), he earned a rotation spot on the senior club, where he played 30 games and averaged 4 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1 assist per game. The following season, Sefolosha earned a starting spot on the senior team, which he helped lead to a third-place finish in the French league, where his team advanced to the playoffs semifinals. During the season, he averaged 9.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 1 steal in 30.7 minutes per game. Before the start of his fourth season with Elan Chalon, a contract dispute between Sefolosha and the team arose. Sefolosha's agent and the team president could not reach an agreement on a new contract, so Sefolosha signed with Italian team Angelico Biella. \"Last summer, I had the chance to re-negotiate my contract with the club. We were supposed to reach an agreement, but when my agent and the president started talking, they couldn't agree on a contract. They wanted to keep me, but at the same time I had this offer from Italy. That's when I decided that the best thing for my career was to play in Biella. Yes, there was a little bit of trouble, but in the end it was OK.\"HoopsHype interview with Sefolosha URL last accessed September 27, 2006 ===Chicago Bulls (2006\u20132009)=== Sefolosha was taken with the 13th pick of the 2006 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers and promptly traded to the Chicago Bulls for the 16th pick (Rodney Carney), and cash considerations.ESPN article on the 2006 NBA Draft URL last accessed September 27, 2006 In an article on Bulls.com, Sefolosha was quoted saying \"I was certainly surprised (at the draft) when someone came up and said that I was the next to be picked. I thought maybe he had made a mistake or something. But a few minutes later he came back and told me that not only was I going to be picked, but that I was going to be traded to Chicago, which really got me excited.\" Former Bulls head coach Scott Skiles cited Sefolosha's wingspan and past pro basketball experience as reasons why the Bulls were interested in him. \"Thabo's got great physical gifts that, frankly, a lot of guys in the league just don't have. He's got tremendous length and has really quick hands, he grabs your attention whenever you watch him play. It's easy to see that he knows what he's doing out there. You can tell he likes to play defense, too. He's eager to get after it.\" After the NBA summer leagues finished, ESPN asked several NBA talent scouts and executives to rank the summer league players and Sefolosha scored high. \"He excelled at just about everything\", reported one of the professionals. \"Thabo Sefolosha showed that he's going to be able to step in right away and contribute to the Bulls.\" ===Oklahoma City Thunder (2009\u20132014)=== On February 19, 2009, the trade deadline, Sefolosha was traded by the Bulls to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Denver's 2009 first-round draft pick, which Chicago used to draft Taj Gibson. Sefolosha was selected to the All-NBA Defensive Second Team for the 2009\u201310 NBA season. In October 2011, during the 2011 NBA lockout, Sefolosha signed with Fenerbah\u00e7e \u00dclker in Turkey, but only for Euroleague matches. His deal had an out-clause that allowed him to return to Oklahoma City at the end of the lockout. He played 7 matches with Fenerbah\u00e7e \u00dclker during the 2011\u201312 Euroleague season. In 2012, Sefolosha and the Thunder reached the NBA Finals, but were defeated by the Miami Heat. ===Atlanta Hawks (2014\u20132017)=== Sefolosha defending LeBron James.

During the altercation, the NYPD officers broke Sefolosha's right leg, shutting him down for the rest of the season. He underwent surgery on April 16, to repair a fractured tibia and ligament damage. The prosecution offered Sefolosha a plea bargain, which would have involved a dismissal of the charges after six months, but Sefolosha refused it on September 9, 2015, even though his attorney, Alex Spiro, urged him to take it. Sefolosha said that he wanted to let the case proceed to trial instead; at the same time, charges against Anti\u0107 were dropped. Sefolosha's court hearing was set on October 5, 2015. On October 9, a Manhattan jury found him not guilty of all three misdemeanor charges: obstructing government administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. On October 21, 2015, Sefolosha announced he would be suing the city of New York as well as eight police officers for up to $50 million in damages. On April 9, 2017, it was announced Sefolosha had settled with the NYPD for $4 million, a \"substantial portion\" of which he donated to Gideon's Promise, a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating public defenders. In October 2017, Sefolosha revealed that he saved a woman the previous month from drowning while he and his family were on a rafting trip down the Provo River. == See also == * * List of European basketball players in the United States ==References== ==External links== * Sefolosha's official website * Thabo Sefolosha at euroleague.net * * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Atlanta Hawks players Category:Chicago Bulls players Category:\u00c9lan Chalon players Category:Swiss expatriate basketball people in France Category:Swiss expatriate basketball people in Turkey Category:Swiss expatriate basketball people in the United States Category:Fenerbah\u00e7e men's basketball players Category:Houston Rockets players Category:National Basketball Association players from Switzerland Category:Oklahoma City Thunder players Category:Pallacanestro Biella players Category:People from Vevey Category:Philadelphia 76ers draft picks Category:Shooting guards Category:Small forwards Category:Swiss expatriate basketball people in Italy Category:Swiss men's basketball players Category:Swiss people of South African descent Category:South African expatriate sportspeople in France Category:South African expatriate sportspeople in Italy Category:South African expatriate sportspeople in Turkey Category:South African expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Utah Jazz players Category:Vevey Riviera Basket players ",
