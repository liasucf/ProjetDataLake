It was founded in 1923 in \u017dilina, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). Trains from railway stations in the cities of \u017dilina and Brno transported 1078 people (including mainly Czechs and Slovaks, but also Hungarians, Ruthenians and other nationalities, and including both direct members and their families) to Kyrgyzstan. Its members made many products on the \u2018green meadow\u2019. The famous Slovak politician Alexander Dub\u010dek also participated in this cooperative in his youth.
