It is endemic to eastern Australia, where it inhabits bogs. Griseargiolestes eboracus is a medium-sized damselfly, black-green metallic in colour with yellow markings; adults have pruinescence on the body, but not the tail. Like other members of the family Megapodagrionidae, it rests with its wings outspread. Griseargiolestes eboracus appears similar to Griseargiolestes griseus which is found south of the Hunter River in New South Wales. ==Gallery== Grey-chested Flatwing (8061685993).jpg | Female Grey-chested Flatwing (8061684650).jpg | Female from above Griseargiolestes eboracus female (11775427674).jpg | Tip of female tail Griseargiolestes eboracus male (11775400855).jpg | Tip of male tail Griseargiolestes eboracus female wings (34664989132).jpg | Female wings Griseargiolestes eboracus male wings (34018428503).jpg | Male wings ==See also== * List of Odonata species of Australia == References == Category:Megapodagrionidae Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Insects of Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Taxa named by Robert John Tillyard Category:Insects described in 1913 Category:Damselflies ",
