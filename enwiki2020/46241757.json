    "text": "At. Long. Last. ASAP (stylized as AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP) is the second studio album by American rapper ASAP Rocky. It was released on May 26, 2015, by ASAP Worldwide, Polo Grounds Music, and RCA Records. The record serves as a sequel from Rocky's previous studio effort Long. Live. ASAP (2013). The album's executive production was provided by Danger Mouse, mentor ASAP Yams and Rocky himself, featuring production by Rocky and Danger Mouse, as well as a variety of several high-profile producers, including co-executive producers Hector Delgado and Juicy J, Jim Jonsin, FnZ, Frans Mernick, Kanye West, Thelonious Martin, and Mark Ronson, among others. The album features guest appearances from Bones, Joe Fox, Future, Schoolboy Q, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, and A-Cyde, among others. At. Long. Last. ASAP was supported by three singles: \"Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LPFJ2)\", \"Everyday\", and \"LSD\". The album received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200. It is Rocky's second US number-one album. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). ==Background== On March 16, 2014, announcements were made for two releases; including their first instrumental mixtape, Beauty and the Beast: Slowed Down Sessions (Chapter 1), and the ASAP Mob's collaborative album, L.O.R.D. ASAP Rocky revealed that he had been working on his second album. On September 26, 2014, ASAP Mob's founder ASAP Yams announced on his Tumblr account that the group scrapped the release for their collective's album, L.O.R.D., and instead named Rocky's second album as the label's next release. On October 2, 2014, Rocky announced that he signed a contract for worldwide representation with William Morris Endeavor. On January 18, 2015, ASAP Rocky's mentor and business partner Yams died at the age of 26, which greatly affected the album's development. Upon ASAP Yams' death, Rocky revealed that his second album would be executive produced by himself and Yams, alongside rapper Juicy J, and record producer Danger Mouse; as well as collaborating with artists such as FKA Twigs and Lykke Li, with production by Clams Casino. ==Title== After performing at the 2015's South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, ASAP Rocky revealed to Billboard, that the title to his second album would be A.L.L.A.. On March 26, 2015, in an interview with GQ, Rocky deciphered the album's title: \"I'm claiming ownership of my legacy. Look at it: At.Long.Last.A$AP. A-L-L-A. Like slang for 'Allah.' It's the return of the god MC. I'm named after Rakim, and I'm finally facing what it means: I was born to do this shit. And I hope I get to do it for a very long time.\" ==Composition== Upon the release of the song \"M's\" (stylized \"M'$\"), Rocky revealed that he had also worked with New York City rapper Mos Def, as well as up-and-coming British musician Joe Fox (who is prominently featured on many tracks on the album). Hector Delgado and Rocky say that they met Joe Fox while roaming the streets of London: \"I met the man. He was a street performer. [I met him in] London. I was at Dean's Studio until 4 a.m. I came outside and we waiting for our Uber to go to Starbucks, tired. This kid comes with his guitar and stuff. He was out there playing and stuff and he comes,\" Rocky explained of his first encounter with Fox. \"It was about 4 a.m. so there's nobody in the streets. He tried to give me a CD and shit. I was like, 'I'm not about to listen to that, man. Play something. You got your guitar.' He played it and I was just like, 'Stop man. Come on let's go.' That's where it started.\" ==Release and promotion== Danger Mouse served as an executive producer, and contributed production on several of the album's tracks. On October 2, 2014, ASAP Yams and ASAP Rocky posted links to their website FlackoJodyeSeason.com, and then announced that Rocky's new single would be releasing at midnight. On October 3, Rocky released the album's promotional single, \"Multiply\" featuring Memphis-based rapper Juicy J. The song was accompanying by the music video (directed by ASAP Rocky and Shomi Patwary), which was officially released at midnight on the website, which had previously displayed a countdown timer. Upon the release, Rocky teased the release of his second studio album, which gave no further details. On April 8, 2015, a song that was called \"M's\" debuted during Rocky's interview with the Red Bull Music Academy, and the song was released two days later on the iTunes Store. However, Rocky denounced the song as an official single from the album. The album version includes a re- worked version of the track, replacing Rocky's second verse, with a guest verse from New Orleans-based rapper Lil Wayne. On May 7, Rocky announced that the release date for the album is on June 2, 2015. On May 9, Rocky unveiled the album's cover art on his Instagram page, with the caption \"AT LONG LAST....\" On the same day, he also released the album's alternative artwork. On May 25, 2015, the album was leaked online, approximately one week before its expected release. Rocky later tweeted to announce that the album had to be released at midnight, advancing the date to a week early. The album was released to digital retailers on May 26, 2015, by ASAP Worldwide, Polo Grounds Music and RCA Records. On August 30, Rocky performed \"M's\" and \"LSD\" at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. ==Singles== On January 7, 2015, ASAP Rocky released the album's lead single, titled \"Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LPFJ2)\". The song was produced by the duo Nez & Rio. The music video, which was directed by Rocky, was released on February 11, 2015. On May 8, 2015, Rocky released the album's second single, titled \"Everyday\". The track features guest appearances from musician Rod Stewart, American R&B; recording artist Miguel, and Mark Ronson (who also produced the track as well, alongside Emile Haynie). On May 19, 2015, Rocky released a music video for \"LSD\" (stylized \"L$D\", which stands for Love, $ex, Dream). The song was produced by Hector Delgado, Jim Jonsin and Finatik N Zac. The music video was directed by Dexter Navy. \"LSD\" was officially released as the album's third single on May 21, via digital distribution. ==Critical reception== At. Long. Last. ASAP was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 76, based on 33 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.7 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Album of the Year assessed the critical consensus as 74 out of 100, based on 30 reviews. In The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick called it a \"big, bold, madly ambitious album\" on which Rocky \"made a frequently dazzling spectacle, another reminder that hip hop is currently setting the bar very high indeed\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said the rapper \"doesn't absorb and repurpose his guests' styles. He's fully formed, a rapper who understands his talent in relation to that of his peers and that of his influences, unafraid of showing you his blueprint.\" Alex Denney of NME said, \"Playground misogyny aside, ALLA is a thrillingly focused follow-up that betrays its anxieties even as it mostly makes do with extolling the virtues of vice.\" Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone credited the producers for sustaining the album's \"expensive vibe\" with \"a sound that's at once tough and transporting \u2014 from the gospel-steeped 'Holy Ghost' to the interplanetary ass-shaker 'Electric Body' to the Rod Stewart- sampling soul fantasia 'Everyday' (featuring Miguel). Even at his trippiest, Rocky makes sure things never swirl off in a haze of incense and peppermints, with steely lyrics that often focus on inescapable truths.\" Ben Thomas of The Guardian said, \"Some might call it retrograde in the year of To Pimp a Butterfly, but rap is big enough to contain multitudes \u2013 including self-regard when it's this perfectly delivered.\" Rebecca Haithcoat was less impressed in Spin, highlighting the upbeat production of \"LSD\", \"Excuse Me\", and \"Westside Highway\", but finding the rest of the record often \"despondent\". Jonathan Hatchman of Clash said, \"As a collected body of work At.Long.Last.A$AP is far from dreadful, but taken as a whole it lacks the elements of depth and star quality that\u2014having set the bar incredibly high with his debut\u2014many expect from A$AP Rocky.\" Mojo reviewer Andy Cowan gave it a lukewarm assessment, writing that while \"there are few lyrical miracles in these scattershot songs obsessed with sex, drugs and shopping, in this intuitive stylist's mouth the words themselves are often beside the point.\" Brooklyn Russell of Pretty Much Amazing said, \"Even if we were to give ALLAs abysmal lyrics a pass, the production doesn't help, either.... Still, Rocky can, at times, be an engaging figure that radiates charisma when he wants.\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+Year-end lists |- ! scope=\"col\"| Publication ! scope=\"col\"| List ! scope=\"col\"| Rank ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Consequence of Sound | Top 50 Albums of 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Entertainment Weekly | The 40 Best Albums of 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Fuse | The 20 Best Albums of 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| NME | NMEs Albums of the Year 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Noisey | The 50 Best Albums of 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spin | The 50 Best Hip-Hop Albums of 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Time Out | The 25 Best Albums of 2015 | | |} ==Commercial performance== At.
