    "text": "The Pluton missile was a French nuclear-armed tactical ballistic missile (short-range ballistic missile, SRBM) system launched from a transporter erector launcher (TEL) platform mounted on an AMX 30 tank chassis. It was designed to provide the tactical part of French nuclear deterrence during the Cold War. == Development == The Pluton came in replacement of the U.S.-built Honest John missile. It had an operating range between , with a CEP of 150 m. This short range only allowed strikes on targets in West Germany or within France itself, which led to the development of the longer ranged Had\u00e8s missile. The system was relatively light-weight, which allowed its deployment in difficult conditions. A CT-20 drone was available to provide last-minute information about the target before launch, making the Pluton system battle- capable. There were five Pluton regiments in the North of France, each having six launchers: *3rd Artillery Regiment in Mailly *4th Artillery Regiment in Laon *15th Artillery Regiment in Suippes *32nd Artillery Regiment in Oberhoffen *74th Artillery Regiment in Belfort A project for an updated version, called Super-Pluton, was dropped in favour of the Had\u00e8s project, and the aging Pluton was gradually discarded until completely retired in 1993.https://fas.org/nuke/guide/france/theater/pluton.htm ==Operators== ; *French Army ==See also== *The American MGM-52 Lance missile. == References == ==External links== * Pluton on astronautix.com ==Bibliography== * CERMA Hors- s\u00e9rie n7 (2013) Histoire de l'artillerie nucl\u00e9aire de Terre fran\u00e7aise 1959-1996 ( // ISSN 1950-3547).
