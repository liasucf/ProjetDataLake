    "text": "The Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) was the elite series tour name of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) competitions from 2003 to 2017. The BFTS kicked off its tour on November 16, 2002 with the Mohegan Sun Invitational in Uncasville, Connecticut. Six of the series events were broadcast on NBC. The entire series was broadcast on Outdoor Life Network (OLN). Telemundo broadcast two events. The first run of the series was held in 29 cities. == 2003 inaugural season == In its inaugural season, the BFTS featured the world's top 45 riders at each event throughout the season. And those 45 riders who earned the most money qualified to compete in the PBR BFTS World Finals at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. If a rider failed to maintain his ranking by not earning enough money, he could be replaced by another rider from the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company Challenger Tour who earned more money. In 2003, the Bud Light Cup Series became the Built Ford Tough Series. This was also the first season on the PBR where the World Champion received a $1 million bonus.2017 PBR Media Guide, The PBR - Celebrating 25 Years, p.8. == 2004 season change == In 2004, the PBR introduced an enhanced scoring system to the BFTS World Finals to make sure the champion is not determined prior to the event. First, 5,500 potential points were available, that ensured any of the top ten riders headed to the event had a chance to win the title. The first place competitor in a round scored 400 points. The second place competitor scored 350 points. Riders placing between third and 10 were awarded points on an incremental scale down to 15. And riders also received the points they earned for a qualified ride.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough World Finals Scoring-In 2004 New Scoring System, p.29. There were six rounds in the PBR World Finals. All of the riders competed in the first five rounds. The top 15 riders advanced to the Championship Round. The rider who won the Finals event received 2,500 BFTS points and $250,000. Second place received 2,250 points. And the riders placing between 3rd and 10th received points on an incremental scale down to 250.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough World Finals Scoring-New Scoring System World Finals, p.29. == 2005 season change == In 2005, a change was made to the tour. Wherein upon the conclusion of every fifth event on the series, the five lowest ranked riders were sent down to the Challenger Tour. It was based on money earned. Then the top five Challenger Tour riders were sent up to the BFTS. This shifting ensured the best riders competed at the right levels of competition. The Challenger Tour was used as a means as providing talent to the BFTS. Additionally, BFTS riders could freely compete in the Challenger Tour and the Hump n' Horns Tour events assuming no conflicts would occur. BFTS riders might have done this because money earned at lower level tours also counted towards reaching the desired top-ranked 45 riders standings. == 2007 season change == In 2007, the Built Ford Tough Series practiced the \"First to Fail\" format, where the order of the top 5 riders going into the championship round of the event was reversed, meaning the leader would ride first and the 5th-place rider would ride last. This format proved unpopular with fans and the championship round was reverted to its original format in 2008. == 2009 season change == In 2009, the PBR BFTS World Champion was determined by the bull rider who earned the most BFTS points. The world finals event champion was determined by the highest aggregate score from 8 rounds. == 2014 season changes == In 2014, the BFTS was then known as the nationally televised elite tour of the PBR. At that time, the tour was composed of the world's top 35 bull riders facing down the world's toughest bulls. The tour made 27 stops in 19 states that year. It opened with its first event at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. It concluded in Las Vegas, Nevada, with the PBR BFTS World Finals. The PBR BFTS World Finals were bull riding's richest and it awarded almost $2.3 million that year if the $1 million bonus to the world champion is counted as well as the $10,000 belt buckle.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-Elite Tour, p.45. In 2014, the BFTS followed these rules. The PBR BFTS World Champion was the bull rider who accumulated the most points while competing in events in the regular season and in the world finals event. The BFTS used the point system to be certain the most consistent rider became the World Champion Bull Rider. Points were earned at each event for a rider's finish in each round and in the event. First place received 100 points. Second place received 90 points. Remaining riders between third and 10th place received points on an incremental scale.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-2014 Rules, p.45. Each BFTS event contained a round with 35 bull rides. For a two-day event, the 35 bull riders will compete in Round 1 and 2. The top 15 scores advanced to the BFTS Championship Round. The event winner was the rider with the highest combined score from all three rounds. The winner received 300 points. The second place finisher received 270 points. Riders placing between third and 10th received points in an incremental scale down to 30.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-Two Day Event Rules, p.45.

In 2004, the PBR introduced an enhanced scoring system to the BFTS World Finals to make sure the champion is not determined prior to the event. These rules were still followed until 2015, when they were slightly modified by removing qualified ride scores from World Standings points totals. First, 5,500 potential points were available, that ensures any of the top ten riders heading to the event had a chance to win the title. The first place competitor in a round scored 400 points. The second place competitor scored 350 points. Riders placing between third and 10 were awarded points on an incremental scale down to 15. And riders also received the points they earned for a qualified ride.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough Series Scoring-2004 Rule Change, p.29.

Riders could qualify for the PBR BFTS World Finals in several ways. One way was by competing in BFTS events throughout the season. They could also compete in the Tour Pro Division and international events. Countries where they could compete are Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough Series Scoring-Qualification, p.29. == 2015 season changes == For 2015 and beyond, the PBR modified the PBR BFTS points system. The BFTS World Champion Bull Rider is the one who accumulated the most world points during the regular season and the World Finals combined. Prior to 2015, the points system was focused on making sure the most consistent rider became the World Champion. However, the PBR's founders have always desired the bull rider who wins consistently be the one who wins the most events; thus, the championship. So starting in 2015, a new points system went into effect. The change affected all of the PBR's tours, the 15/15 Bucking Battle, and the international tours in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico. Qualified ride scores no longer were included in the World Standings point totals. They were, however, used to determine placements in event rounds and event aggregates, and to determine both event and World Standings.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough Series Scoring-2015 Rule Change, p.28. Each BFTS event contained a round with 35 bull rides. For a two-day event, the 35 bull riders will competed in Round 1 and 2. The top 15 scores advanced to the BFTS Championship Round. The event winner was the rider with the highest combined score from all three rounds. For a three-day event, the 35 bull riders will completed in Rounds 1, 2, and 3. The top 15 scores advanced to the BFTS Championship round. The event winner was the rider with the highest combined score from all three rounds.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR USA Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-Elite Tour, p.43. There were four events on the BFTS that were considered major events. They are New York City, New York; Arlington, Texas; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Nashville, Tennessee. Major events offer competition in different formats, bonus bulls, and more prize money. These major events are broadcast on CBS. Together, these four major events compose the PBR Grand Slam Series.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR USA Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-PBR Majors, p.43. The 15/15 Bucking Battles were offered at some PBR BFTS events. This type of event matched the top 15 bull riders in the PBR against the top 15 bulls at the event. The matching was random. There was a separate purse for this event. Points were earned at the rate of 1 and 1/2 times the round points. Points did not factor into the winner but did count toward the World Standings. The winner was the bull rider with the highest ride score.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR USA Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-15/15 Bucking Battle, p.43. Qualifying for the PBR BFTS World Finals was based on points. Points could be earned on all of the PBR's tours: Built Ford Tough Series, Velocity Tour, Pro Touring Division and the International tours. International tours included Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico. The top 35 ranked riders in the World Standings according to points earned competed at the World Finals.

They remained at the arena until 1998. In 1999, the PBR moved their World Finals to the Thomas & Mack Center. The PBR was stretching its current arena's limits and really needed a bigger arena. They wanted to stay in Las Vegas, and on the Thomas & Mack Center. The PBR BFTS was held at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, from 1999 until 2015. The 2015 World Finals was the 17th and last time it was hosted there. In 2016, the PBR moved their World Finals event from the Thomas & Mack Center to the T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip. ==See also== *Professional Bull Riders *Unleash the Beast Series *Bud Light Cup Series == References == == Bibliography == * * * == External links == * PBR World Finals * Professional Bull Riders Category:Ford Motor Company Category:Equestrian sports competitions in the United States Category:Rodeo competition series Category:Professional Bull Riders Category:Bucking bulls Category:Bull riders Category:Sports competitions in Las Vegas ",
