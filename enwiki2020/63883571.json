The star was given the formal name Irena by the International Astronomical Union in January 2020.The IAU announces names for WASP exoplanets The star is known to host one exoplanet, designated WASP-38b or formally named 'Iztok'. == Star characteristics == The study in 2015 utilizing Chandra X-ray Observatory, have failed to detect any X-ray emissions from the star during planetary eclipse, which may indicate an unusually low coronal activity or the presence of absorbing gas ring formed by atmosphere escaping planet WASP-38 b. == Planetary system == The \"hot Jupiter\" class planet WASP-38 b, later named 'Iztok', was discovered around HD 146389 in 2010. The planet is losing significant amount of gas, estimated to 0.023 Earth masses per billion years. In 2013, it was found the planetary orbit is surprisingly well aligned with the rotational axis of the parent star, despite of the noticeable orbital eccentricity. The study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, have determined the orbital plane of WASP-38b is poorly constrained but probably aligned with the equatorial plane of the star, misalignment equal to 15\u00b0. == References == Category:Planetary systems with one confirmed planet Category:Hercules (constellation) Category:F-type main- sequence stars Category:Planetary transit variables Category:Henry Draper Catalogue objects Irena 38 J16155036+1001572 ",
