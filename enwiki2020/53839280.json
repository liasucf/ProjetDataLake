(Notice that this is the way to show the pronunciation of this name, not meaning he has an appearance like an animal.) ==Legends== ===The great flood=== Coqsse\u02bbleel\u02bbee was seen as the survivor from the great flood. In Naxi mythology, this disaster was caused by the filth to world which come from the incest between Coqsse\u02bbleel\u02bbee's five brothers and six sisters. Coqsse\u02bbleel\u02bbee was the unique survivor with the help of the god and the goddess. ===The two goddesses=== After the flood, human had come into extinction, and the god advised him to find a goddess as wife to last human: \"There are two goddess lived under the mount, the one have \"vertical\" blue eyes who is beautiful, another have \"horizontal\" blue eyes who is goodness. You should select the second one as your wife.\" However Coqsse\u02bbleel\u02bbee forgot his advise and select the beautiful one, which caused his son and daughter as tree, monkey, bear and other creature. Coqsse\u02bbleel\u02bbee was disappointed and had to find another wife to give birth to human being. ===Marriage with Ceilheeqbbubbeq=== The god advised another goddess named Ceilheeqbbubbeq to Coqsse\u02bbleel\u02bbee. however, Ceilheeqbbubbeq's father, god Zzeelaq'apv, was opposed this marriage, and figured out many ways to kill him.
