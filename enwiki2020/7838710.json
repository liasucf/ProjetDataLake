    "text": "Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. () is an Italian manufacturer of coffee products. Founded in Turin in 1895 by Luigi Lavazza, it was initially run from a small grocery store at Via San Tommaso 10. The business of Lavazza S.p.A. is currently administered by the third and fourth generations of the Lavazza family. ==Coffee== Lavazza imports coffee from around the world, including Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Uganda, Indonesia, United States and Mexico. Sustainable production concerns have led the company to develop the \u00a1Tierra! project, a sustainable agriculture program in Honduras, Colombia and Peru, that seeks to improve the quality of coffee as well as the environmental and working conditions of those communities. Branded as \"Italy's Favourite Coffee,\" the company claims that 16 million out of the 20 million coffee purchasing families in Italy choose Lavazza. Among its offerings today are products such as: Qualit\u00e0 Oro, Qualit\u00e0 Rossa, Club, Caff\u00e8 Espresso, Il Perfetto Espresso, Caff\u00e8 Crema, Gran Aroma Bar, Super Crema, Crema e Gusto, Crema e Aroma, Top Class, Grand'Espresso, Dek (decaffeinated), and coffee capsules A Modo Mio, \"Espresso Point\" and Lavazza Blue. Also Lavazza produces Nespresso Compatible Capsules (NCC). ==Retail== The company operates a number of retail coffee shops (\"Il Caff\u00e8 di Roma\" and \"Espression\"). The shops offer traditional coffee drinks as well as whole bean and ground coffee for home use. ==Company== Advertising for Lavazza: Transport of coffee in Indochina Lavazza, established in Turin, Italy, in 1895, has been owned by the family of the same name for four generations. The world's seventh ranking coffee roaster, Lavazza has a market share by sales of over 36% in Italy, 3800 employees and revenue of \u20ac2.24 billion (2019). The company has six production sites, three in Italy and three abroad, and operates through associated companies and distributors in more than 90 countries. Lavazza exports 46% of its production. Lavazza credits itself with inventing the concept of blending, \"the art of combining different types of coffee from different geographical areas\", in its early years and claims this as a distinctive feature of all its products. The company also has 25 years experience in the production and sale of portioned coffee systems. Today, through ongoing partnerships with an international network of universities and scientific research centers, Lavazza operates four platforms in this segment. In 1979 the company established the \"Luigi Lavazza Centre for coffee research\" which is \"devoted to the study of espresso\" and has evolved into the Lavazza Training Centre, a network of over 50 coffee schools worldwide, where 30 thousand people receive training each year. Among the activities promoted by the Lavazza Foundation, established in 2002, is the Tierra project which, in partnership with the Rainforest Alliance, performs research into achieving the \"finest end product quality\", with a focus on the living conditions of people in coffee producing countries. Lavazza is the official coffee in the Italian Pavilion at the Expo 2015 in Milan. Lavazza acquired the Carte Noire and Merrild brands from Jacobs Douwe Egberts in February 2016. Lavazza purchased an 80% stake in Canadian-based Kicking Horse Coffee in May 2017. In 2019, with PepsiCo, Lavazza launched canned ready-to-drink cappuccino in Europe. A lawsuit was filed in 2019 alleging Lavazza brought false intellectual property lawsuits against American resellers on Amazon.com in an attempt to prevent them from reselling products.https://www.law.com/njlawjournal/2019/11/12/online-reseller-accuses- lavazza-coffee-of-bringing-phony-ip-infringement- claims/?slreturn=20200611005445 ==Sponsorship== Lavazza became a sponsor of Liverpool F.C. in 2018, and the Williams Racing team in the 2020 Formula One season.
