    "text": "Detroit is an album by the Gerald Wilson Orchestra recorded in 2009 and released on the Mack Avenue label.Mack Avenue catalog, accessed August 26, 2016 ==Reception== AllMusic rated the album with 4 stars; in his review, Michael G. Nastos noted: \"A quite spirited and energetic music is heard here from the 90-year-old Wilson, whose charm and wit would rival anyone many decades his junior. It's a swinging affair molded in the traditional big-band visage of Count Basie, Ernie Wilkins, or early Quincy Jones, with Wilson's deft touch for embellishing the blues\". In JazzTimes Owen Cordle wrote: \"Wilson\u2019s chord progressions, chord voicings and rhythmic figures for the ensemble are strong characteristics of his writing. He also has a flair for atmospheric themes. One could quibble about the combo-esque strings of solos and the scarcity of ensemble interludes. Nevertheless, his writing style continues to serve him well\".Cordle, O. JazzTimes review November 2009 On All About Jazz Robert J. Robbins noted: \"Gerald Wilson's six-movement \"Detroit Suite\" demonstrates that after nearly seven decades in the music business, the nonagenarian composer and arranger still has a great deal to offer in terms of musical creativity\".Robbins, R.
