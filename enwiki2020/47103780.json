He also possesses good close control, technique, and quick footwork, which enable him to get past opponents when in possession, while his vision, intelligence, personality, and incisive passing also allow him to set the tempo of his team's play in a more creative role as a regista deep in midfield, and create goalscoring opportunities for his teammates after winning back the ball. His height and strong frame also enable him to act as a \"target man\" in an advanced midfield role; he has even played as a second striker on occasion. Although his acceleration is not particularly impressive, he is also a mobile player, who is capable of pressing opponents further up the pitch. Moreover, he has also drawn praise in the media for his composure and quick- thinking both with and without the ball. Due to his precociousness, talent, maturity, and wide range of skills, he is considered to be a highly promising young player in the media. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|Continental !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=4|Boca Juniors |2015 |rowspan=3|Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |18||0||6||0||1Appearances in the Copa Libertadores||0||0||0||25||0 |- |2016 |11||1||3||0||5||0||0||0||19||1 |- |2016\u201317 |22||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||22||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !51!!1!!9!!0!!6!!0!!0!!0!!66!!1 |- |rowspan=5|Juventus |2017\u201318 |rowspan=4|Serie A |20||0||2||0||5Appearances in the UEFA Champions League||0||0||0||27||0 |- |2018\u201319 |31||2||1||0||7||0||1Appearances in the Supercoppa Italiana||0||40||2 |- |2019\u201320 |30||0||5||1||7||0||1Appearances in the Supercoppa Italiana||0||43||1 |- |2020\u201321 |3||0||0||0||1||0||0Appearances in the Supercoppa Italiana||0||4||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !84!!2!!8!!1!!20!!0!!2!!0!!114!!3 |- !colspan=3|Career total !135!!3!!17!!1!!26!!0!!2!!0!!180!!4 |} ===International=== :As of 13 October 2020 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | Uruguay |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2017||4||0 |- |2018||13||0 |- |2019||12||0 |- |2020||2||0 |- !Total||31||0 |} ==Honours== Boca Juniors * Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 2015, 2016\u201317 * Copa Argentina: 2014\u201315 Juventus * Serie A: 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319, 2019\u201320 * Coppa Italia: 2017\u201318 * Supercoppa Italiana: 2018 Uruguay U20 * South American Youth Football Championship: 2017 Uruguay * China Cup: 2018, 2019 ==References== ==External links== * * *Rodrigo Bentancur at Juventus Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:People from Nueva Helvecia, Uruguay Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Uruguay international footballers Category:Uruguay under-20 international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Boca Juniors footballers Category:Juventus F.C. players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Serie A players Category:Uruguayan expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Argentina Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Argentina Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Italy Category:2018 FIFA World Cup players Category:2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica players ",
