In mid-November, she got into a feud with Aliyah and Vanessa Borne, getting back-to-back singles victories over the duo on the November 13 and 27 episodes of NXT, the latter of which saw her get attacked by NXT Women's Champion Shayna Baszler, Marina Shafir and Jessamyn Duke afterwards.

On the May 6 episode of NXT, Li had a match with Chelsea Green, which she lost due to a distraction from Aliyah. This led to another match between the two on the June 17 episode of NXT, with Aliyah getting the victory after Robert Stone distracted Li by vomiting in the ring. On the September 16 episode of NXT, she teamed up with Jessi Kamea in a losing effort against Kayden Carter and Kacy Catanzaro, with Li refusing to shake hands with them after the match. The following week, she competed in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the NXT Women's Championship, which was won by Candice LeRae. Li went against Carter on the September 30 episode of NXT, losing the match and pushing her to the mat after being extended a hand. == References == == External links == * * * Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Chongqing Category:Chinese wushu practitioners Category:Chinese female professional wrestlers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
