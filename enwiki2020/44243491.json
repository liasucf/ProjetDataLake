The blue that symbolises the working class is darker and the red string is replaced by a red V collar. Dror-Israel () is a pioneering educational movement whose mission is to effect meaningful, long-term educational and social change in Israeli society in order to promote solidarity, social activism, democracy and equality. Dror- Israel aims to form the grassroots nucleus of an exemplary society in Israel based on the vision of the prophets of Israel and the founders of Zionism. Dror Israel emphasizes participation from every sector of Israeli society, including Ethiopian and Russian immigrants, Arab Israelis, Druze and Bedouins, and middle class and working class communities. In the past decade, Dror Israel has established 16 educators' kibbutzim in the social and geographic periphery of Israel. There are currently 1,200 young adults living in these kibbutzim, aged 20\u201340, who work daily in the organization's educational, cultural and social activities with over 100,000 children, teens and adults. Sukot at Dror-Israel's Kibboz Mehanhim Beer Sheva ==History== Dror Israel was founded in 2006 by graduates of HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed (Working and Studying Youth) youth movement. HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed was founded in 1924 by youth working to defend their rights. HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed founded more than one hundred kibbutzim between 1930 and 1980. In the 1990s, along with the decline of the kibbutz movement, HaNoar HaOved VeHalomed began re-examining the ideal life path of its members, which had encouraged settling kibbutzim in Gar'inim (core groups) after finishing their mandatory period of army service. In place of this path, a model started to be put forward in which graduates of the movement formed small urban communes working in society, particularly in education. As part of this process of change, Dror Israel was founded to give a name to this new movement, and today includes HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed as its daughter youth movement. As of 2014, there are about 1,200 members of Dror Israel, graduates of HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed living in small communes in cities or kibbutzim and working in Israeli society \u2013 mostly in education and the youth movement. Dror-Israel is named after the historical \"Dror\" Zionist youth movement. ==Educators' kibbutzim== The Dror-Israel center in Tel-Aviv Dror Israel's 16 educators' kibbutzim throughout Israel are made up of 1,200 active young people who live together in communities and commit to bettering Israeli society, working in various social, educational and community projects. The educators' kibbutzim strive for a new way of life that enables the members to actualize the Jewish values of Zionism, equality and social responsibility in the reality of Israel's geographic and socio-economic periphery. * 30\u2013100 educators live in each kibbutz in accordance with local needs and the preferences of group members * Each educators' kibbutz is responsible for a wide variety of activities specific to the needs of the local community * The educators' kibbutzim are located throughout Israel \u2013 urban and rural areas, the center and the periphery * Some 100 young members of Dror Israel join the educator's kibbutzim each year ==Objectives and activities== Dror Israel believes that Jewish values are the foundation of a humanist, Zionist, democratic and egalitarian worldview. These values manifest themselves in all of the movement's programs for youth and adults, as well as in the members' own culture and lifestyle. ===Work with youth at-risk behavior=== Dror Israel educates and assists children and youth in disadvantaged communities throughout Israel, most of whom live in Israel's social periphery and are exposed to poverty, inequality, drug use, neglect, violence, and discrimination.

The members value community activity and leave their home branches to become leaders at branches and centers in disadvantaged communities. Youth movement alumni have gone on to become social, political, military and cultural leaders in Israel, including former prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and former president and prime minister, Shimon Peres. After their army service, many youth movement graduates choose to join Dror Israel educators' kibbutzim. ===Jewish\u2013Arab co-existence=== Youth guides from the Arabic sector of HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed Dror Israel operates unique educational initiatives for encounters between Jews and Arabs \u2013 with dozens of educators and thousands of children and youth participating each year.
