Regarding Kipnis' success, Arizona State coach Pat Murphy observed: \"I love that kid. He's tough as nails, and really hard on himself.\" Moreover, Paul DePodesta, San Diego Padres front office assistant and former Los Angeles Dodgers general manager, described him as \"a pesky player who is a very tough out, hitting the ball to all fields and running the bases aggressively ...

Baseball America ranked him the fifth-best player in the league. During this time, Baseball Prospectus rated him the Indians' eighth-best prospect, describing Kipnis as \"fitting great baseball intelligence, a lot of intensity, and surprising tools into a small package.

What's that about? > He goes out and hits for the cycle. For 2010, Kipnis led the Indians minor league system in hits (159) and runs (96).

He seems to handle both fastballs and breaking stuff well, makes adjustments, and can handle left-handed pitching just fine.\" Baseball Prospectus ranked him as the 28th-highest prospect in baseball (\".300 hitter, with 12\u201318 home runs\") and the best in the organization.

Baseball America initially ranked him as the 54th-best prospect in baseball, the second-best second base prospect and the second-best prospect in the Indians organization.
