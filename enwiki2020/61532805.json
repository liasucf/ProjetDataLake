After retiring from UIC in 2012, he joined Tsinghua University as a full-time professor. ==Research== Among Yau's research interests are bioinformatics, complex algebraic geometry, singularities theory, and nonlinear filtering. He published nearly 300 papers and established the \"Yau algebra\" and the \"Yau number\". He served as Chairman of the IEEE International Conference on Control and Information and co-founded the Journal of Algebraic Geometry in 1991. He founded the journal Communications in Information and Systems in 2000, and has served as Editor-in-Chief since its inception. ==Awards== Yau was awarded the Sloan Research Fellowship in 1980 and the Guggenheim Fellowship in 2000.
