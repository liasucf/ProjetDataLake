Retrieved 26 May 2015. The number of participating countries was thirteen; Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Great Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, United States, Soviet Russia and Yugoslavia. == The games == In addition to competitive sports, the games featured mass artistic displays, choral recitals, political plays and singing of revolutionary songs. According to the reports of the Finnish Workers' Sports Federation, the competitions were poorly organized, but the mass gymnastic displays were spectacular. The most successive country was Finland, whose athletes won every sport they competed in. This was a great surprise for all, even for the Finns themselves. Their intention was to meet the \"top athletes of the world\", but instead, the Finns found themselves on the top. Main reason for their success was the totally different culture; while the Finns focused in competing, the other European organizations were more interested of the educational aspects in labor sports.Hentil\u00e4, Seppo: \u2033Ty\u00f6v\u00e4en Urheiluliitto ja kansainv\u00e4linen ty\u00f6l\u00e4isurheilu\u2033 (in Finnish).
