    "text": "The \u00c9tat l\u00e9gal (English: \"legal state\"), also called \"legicentric state\", is a doctrine of continental European legal thinking, originated in French constitutional studies, which argues for the primacy of the law over constitutional rights. Contrary to the police state \u2013 where the law is arbitrary, unequally applied, and its making outside of non-state control \u2013 and to the Rechtsstaat \u2013 in which constitutional rights are viewed as preceding and superseding the authority of the law \u2013 the \u00e9tat l\u00e9gal is a form of rule of law where the law is applied equally \u2013 i.e. to the people and to the state \u2013 as it is decided, that is without or with reduced constitutional limits to the will of the law maker. In democratic regimes enforcing universal suffrage, the \u00e9tat l\u00e9gal gives absolute primacy to the decision of the majority of the voters \u2013 generally via their elected representatives \u2013 which can lead to decisions possibly detrimental to the rights of minorities or contrary to human rights. As defined by constitutional jurist Dominique Rousseau, the \u00e9tat l\u00e9gal \"subjects the executive power, administration and justice to the rule of law passed by Parliament, a rule which, as the expression of the general will, is indisputable and cannot therefore be judged.\" == Concept == The concept of \u00e9tat l\u00e9gal was theorized by French jurist Raymond Carr\u00e9 de Malberg in his 1920 book Contribution \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'\u00c9tat. He distinguished three differents forms of states: the police state, in which the power acts freely in an arbitrary way; the \"state of rights\" (\u00e9tat de droits or Rechtsstaat), where the authority of the law is limited by constitutional rights; and the \"legal state\" (\u00e9tat l\u00e9gal), a rule of law which gives primacy to the authority of the law over constitutional rights. In a democratic state, where the power is entrusted to the people \u2013 generally via universal suffrage \u2013 the difference between the \u00e9tat l\u00e9gal and the Rechtsstaat has a significant consequence. In the first situation, the decision of the majority is set in law as decided, and thereafter applied by the state; whereas in the Rechsstaat, the state (or the majority) is limited in the nature of the laws it is able to introduce by a set of rules protecting fundamental rights and minorities (e.g., the American constitutional amendments, or the German constitutional fundamental rights). == References == Category:Forms of government Category:Philosophy of law Category:Theories of law ",
