    "text": "Gas is the debut album by Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project, released on 29 November 1996 on the Mille Plateaux label. Gas solidifies the sound of the project, moving away from dance floor-ready techno by incorporating lengthy pieces of ambient music, under which is a sole kick drum. It is the only album by Gas not to feature the forest motif in its artwork. On vinyl, each song took up one side of each vinyl disc. The CD pressing features edits of tracks 1, 2, 5 and 6, so that the contents would fit within the time constraints of the disc. For Gas' inclusion as part of the Nah und Fern box set, tracks 1 and 3 were replaced with entirely different pieces, while the other four songs appeared in slightly extended forms from their CD counterparts. Track 4 was also heavily remixed for Nah und Fern. ==Track listing== ===Vinyl pressing=== ===Compact disc pressing=== ==References== Category:1996 debut albums Category:Gas (musician) albums ",
