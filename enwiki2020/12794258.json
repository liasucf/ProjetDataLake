    "text": "Whitland RFC are a Welsh rugby union club based in Whitland, West Wales. They are the presently members of the Welsh Rugby Union playing in Division One West and is a feeder club for the Llanelli Scarlets. ==Early history== Whitland RFC is thought to have been founded around 1910, but little verifiable information exists to support a definite date. Club development stalled during the Great War years, but in the 1919/20 season Whitland RFC took part in the Pembrokeshire Knock Out Cup. As with many Welsh teams, the inter-war years were difficult and the team disbanded in January 1930. The club reformed for the 1938-39 season and has existed in that form since. Mike Phillips (Ospreys, Wales & British and Irish Lions), Jonathan Davies (Scarlets, Wales & British and Irish Lions) and James Davies (Scarlets & Wales) brother of Jonathan played their club rugby for Whitland as have Aled Davies (Scarlets, Ospreys & Wales) and Scott Williams (Llanelli Scarlets & Wales).Whitland RFC Official Website.
