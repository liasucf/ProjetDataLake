It's located between districts Ipiranga and Vila Prudente, in the neighbour hood of Vila Independ\u00eancia, in S\u00e3o Paulo. ==History== 250px After World War II, Brazil started to encourage the nationalization of automotive industry. Therefore, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo was the destination of many multinational companies from the automotive branch. These companies, taking advantage of Anchieta Highway and Santos-Jundia\u00ed Railway, getting installed in the surroundings of these corridors, most notably in the ABC zone. The Distribuidora de Autom\u00f3veis Studebaker Ltda., founded in 1945, was installed next to the km 70 of the Santos Jundia\u00ed Railway, between S\u00e3o Caetano and Ipiranga stations, and dedicated itself initially to vehicle mounting of the American homonymous and other like Studebaker, Massey Harris, Scania Vabis, Kenworths and Ferguson in regime SDK/CKD. The production growth motivated the hiring of many workers, whose mobility was difficult because of the distance between the factory and Ipiranga station. Motivated by the increasing demand originated by the factory, Santos-Jundia\u00ed created the Studebaker Stop, made of two side platforms and used only in the entrance and exit times of the factory. Despite the stop was in the time table of Santos-Jundia\u00ed, it didn't appear in the maps until 1964, when it was promoted to the category of station. In the 1950s, Studebaker was renamed to Ve\u00edculos e M\u00e1quinas Agr\u00edcolas S.A. (Vemag) and started a process of conversion of its industrial plant to be the automobile manufacturer under licence of the German company DKW. Vemag's growth attracted dozens of small industries suppliers of auto parts, lubricants, and fuel, consolidating that region as an industrial area. Therefore, the small stop became used more, until it was promoted to the condition of regular passengers station, in 1964, when new installations were opened. After Vemag's closing in 1967, Vemag station was renamed to Tamanduate\u00ed, though the old name was made by the companies in the zone and by the media until mid-1970s. Since its creation, the station suffered from flooding of Tamanduate\u00ed River, which stops the train traffic sometimes. Slowly, the installation of the station became outdated and didn't attend the modern accessibility rules, being predicted the station remodeling. ===Rebuilt=== The original Tamanduate\u00ed station was deactivated on 21 September 2010, being replaced by the current one, built away from the old station. With the construction of the new train and metro station, the old building was demolished.. The new station was built to attend the CPTM Line 10-Turquoise, as well as the Metro Line 2-Green, with the Metro platforms being elevated. A proposal made by State Deputy Edson Ferrarini (PROS) was published to rename the station to Tamanduate\u00ed-Imperador do Ipiranga, but then-Governor Alberto Goldman vetoed the project and the Legislative Assembly confirmed the veto, archiving the project. ===Infrastructure problems=== Five months after the station opening, it already presented five gutters, being one in the CPTM platform and two in the Metro area. The company stated that the repair would be made by the builder, without burden. Local residents heard by Jornal da Tarde on April 2011 complained about the supposed neglect to the surroundings of the station, as the desert region facilitated robbery. Metro responded the complaints saying that there was project of the reurbanization of the area, and the reform was scheduled to start in the second semester of 2011. on 15 December 2011, the surroundings of the station were flooded, due to the overflow of Tamanduate\u00ed River. In the occasion, employees who arrived to work where obligate to go to Vila Prudente station, where they would take the metro to Tomanduate\u00ed. According to an employee hear by Jornal da Tarde, the water have reached the escalators in the Avenida Presidente Wilson entrance. Passengers who arrived to the station needed to wait for the water level to decrease and, even after this happen, had to deal with much mud throughout that day. The Metro directory emphasized that the station operation wasn't interrupted, because the it was project above the region flooding quota, that has \"cronichal problems with floodings\". One of these measures predict a reinforcement in the surface water draining, but it's enough only if the river doesn't flood. ==Characteristics== The station is located between Avenida Presidente Wilson and Rua Guamiranga, having accesses to both roads. The Metro station is elevated with side platforms, while the CPTM one is a surface station with two island platforms. Its mezzanine is common to both Metro and CPTM. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1947 Category:Railway stations opened in 2010 ",
