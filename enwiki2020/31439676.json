After Amstrad withdrew from the PC market place, Tkachuk became CEO of Viglen. ==The Apprentice== He came to UK public recognition through his direct style of job interviewing on The Apprentice, having appeared in the first six series. Notable events during these interviews include discovering that the eventual Series 4 winner Lee McQueen had lied on his CV about his time spent at university and that Series 6 contestant Stuart Baggs had exaggerated his telecommunication operations. In the latter interview, he incorrectly told Baggs that \"ISP\" stood for \"Internet Service Protocol\" (instead of Internet Service Provider).Barry Collins, Why Lord Sugar needs to fire his \u201ctechnical expert\u201d 16 December 2010 PC Pro.
