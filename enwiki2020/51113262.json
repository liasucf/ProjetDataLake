The church became a place of pilgrimage. Leland visited it around 1540, shortly before its destruction during the Suppression of the Chantries. He described the church as \"not very great...but exceeding fair.\"Charles Billson, Mediaeval Leicester, (Leicester, 1920) ==Use as a burial place== The church became an important burial place of notable members of the Lancastrian dynasty.Kenneth Fowler, The King's Lieutenant: Henry of Grosmont (London, 1969)Anthony Goodman, John of Gaunt, (London, 1992) Those buried here included: * Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster * Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster -- son of the above, grandfather of Henry IV of England. * Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster -- second wife of John of Gaunt, daughter of Peter of Castile. * Mary de Bohun -- first wife of Henry IV, who died before he took the throne. She was the mother of Henry V of England. * Mary Hervey, a member of John of Gaunt's household, who died c.1408, and whose alabaster tomb effigy was moved across the road to the chapel of the Trinity Hospital, where it still stands. Early sources (the Frowyk Chronicle and the Ballad of Bosworth Field) strongly suggest that the church was where the naked corpse of Richard III of England was displayed after his death at Bosworth Field and prior to his burial in the Greyfriars priory.Annette Carson, John Ashdown-Hill et al, Finding Richard III (Imprimis Imprimatur, 2014) ==Current state== DMU heritage centre, Leicester Only two arches survive from the original building, preserved in situ under what is now the Hawthorn Building of De Montfort University, where the public can see them in what is now the university's heritage centre. ==See also== Leicester's other museums *Jewry Wall Museum *New Walk Museum *Abbey Pumping Station *Leicester Guildhall *Also, List of museums in Leicestershire ==References== Category:14th-century churches Category:History of Leicester ",
