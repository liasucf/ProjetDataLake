    "text": "In computability theory and mathematical logic the Tarski\u2013Kuratowski algorithm is a non-deterministic algorithm which produces an upper bound for the complexity of a given formula in the arithmetical hierarchy and analytical hierarchy. The algorithm is named after Alfred Tarski and Kazimierz Kuratowski. ==Algorithm== The Tarski\u2013Kuratowski algorithm for the arithmetical hierarchy consists of the following steps: # Convert the formula to prenex normal form. (This is the non-deterministic part of the algorithm, as there may be more than one valid prenex normal form for the given formula.) # If the formula is quantifier-free, it is in \\Sigma^0_0 and \\Pi^0_0. # Otherwise, count the number of alternations of quantifiers; call this k. # If the first quantifier is \u2203, the formula is in \\Sigma^0_{k+1}. # If the first quantifier is \u2200, the formula is in \\Pi^0_{k+1}. ==References== *Rogers, H.
