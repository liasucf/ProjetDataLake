    "text": "The Church of Stigmatisation of Saint Francis () is a Catholic Church built in the mid-18th century, in the Baroque style, located in Buda, Budapest, in the immediate vicinity of the Batthy\u00e1ny t\u00e9r square. == History == During the Turkish occupation of Buda, it was the place of the Pashtun Magt\u00fal Mustafa mosque. The spiritual care of Catholic believers was carried out from the middle of the 17th century by Bosnian Franciscan monks, who remained in the city after 1686, and in 1703 began the construction of a monastery and church. The architect was Hans James. The foundation stone of the present church was laid in 1731 and consecrated in 1757 by K\u00e1roly Zbisk\u00f3. Most of the Baroque items that are still visible today (altars, pulpit and benches) were made by the monks' own workshop. However, according to a decree of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, it had to be handed over in 1785 to the Nursing nuns from Vienna, who transformed the monastery into a hospital. They continued their care service for \"unsupervised patients\" until the dissolution of the communist dictatorship in 1950. Then 69 sisters had to leave. With the end of the dictatorship in 1990, only a few could return. During the years of dictatorship, the hospital and the monastery used to be a nursing home, now run by the Maltese Charity Service, known as the House of Care for the Elderly. The church has been in use since 1989 by the priests of German- speaking Catholics in Budapest. ==Architecture== The rich ornamentation of the interior of the church is mainly the work of Franciscan artists from the 18th century. ==Gallery== File:Budapest, Batthy\u00e1ny t\u00e9r..JPG|Rear facade File:Erzs\u00e9betiek k\u00f3rh\u00e1za \u00e9s a Szent Ferenc Sebei templom, 2016 V\u00edziv\u00e1ros.jpg|Tower File:Facade upper part.
