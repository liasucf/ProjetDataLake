It has Foreign Language College status and offers A-Levels. == History == The school was founded before World War II as the Canterbury Technical School for Girls. It shared the old hospital site on the north side of Longport, along with the equivalent for boys (which became Chaucer School) and the Technical College (which became Canterbury College). It moved across the road to the present site in 1945. Past Headmistresses were Miss E. Blackith (who retired in 1967) and followed by Mrs V. Arnold. ===Past Curricula === In September 2007 the school replaced A-levels with the International Baccalaureate. From September 2011 the school re-introduced A-levels but kept the International Baccalaureate, giving students the option to do either. The school held a Foreign Language College status, and the school has transferred to the International Baccalaureate award scheme for those pupils in Years 12 and 13. Study of this course has begun from September 2007,The International Baccalaureate at Barton Court and the first set of official results were published on 6 July 2009. The results were above the world average, and the school put the Middle Years Program (a version of the International Baccalaureate for younger pupils) into use. MYP (Middle Years Program) was stopped shortly before the end of 2010 and was replaced on the timetable by ICT. The International Baccalaureate was also discontinued in 2015. ===Academy governance=== On 1 September 2011, Barton Court Grammar School became an Academy. Barton Court did not change its name as it wished to keep it the same. == Campus == The school stands on what was the farm of St Augustine's Abbey across the road; 'Barton' stems from 'bere tun' or 'barley enclosure'. The school is built around the lake in which the monks of the Abbey farmed fish. The campus has the sixth Ginkgo tree to be introduced in England from China. The other five were planted in Kew Gardens. The main house of the school was built in 1750 as a manor house with the name 'Barton Manor'; the other buildings include a 1961 block, which is now the hall and corridor, a language block in 2001 and technology classrooms in 2007. == Curriculum == Kent is one counties in England that retains selection.
