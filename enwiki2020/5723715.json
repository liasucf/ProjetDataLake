The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brechin or Diocese of Angus was one of the thirteen pre-Reformation dioceses of Scotland. == History == The diocese was believed to have been founded by Bishop Samson in 1153, and based at the cathedral in Brechin, Angus. At the Reformation, the cathedral, churches and jurisdiction of the diocese were transferred to the Church of Scotland, its line of episcopacy having been continued without breaks by the Scottish Episcopal Church, which separated from the Church of Scotland in 1690. The Diocese has been led by the Bishop of Brechin (Episcopal), sole successor to the early Catholic Bishop of Brechin. == Parishes == # Brechin # Buthergill (now Burghill) # Catterline # Cortachy # Crebyauch (now Kirkbuddo) # Dun # Dundee # Dunnichen # Farnell # Fothenevyn (now Finavon or Oathlaw) # Glenbervie # Glenisla # Guthrie # Kilmoir # Kingornie # Kingoldrum # Lethnot # Maryton # Menmuir # Monikie # Montrose # Navar # Panbride # Stracathro # Strathmartine and in the Mearns # Garvock # Strachan == References == Category:Christianity in Dundee Category:Christianity in Angus Category:Pre- Reformation dioceses of Scotland Category:Religious organizations established in the 1150s Category:Dioceses established in the 12th century Brechin Category:1153 establishments in Scotland Diocese ",
