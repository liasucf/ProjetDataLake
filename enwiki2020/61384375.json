    "text": "Bestansur is a Neolithic site located in Sulaimaniyah province, Kurdistan Regional Government, Iraq in the western Zagros foothills. The site is located on the edge of the Shahrizor Plain, 30 km to the south-east of Sulaimaniyah. The archaeological site consists of a 2.5 km wide 7m high settlement mound, with occupation dating to the Early Neolithic period, 7600-7100 BC, and the Neo-Assyrian and Sasanian periods. == Excavation History == Excavations have been undertaken at Bestansur since 2012 by the University of Reading and the University of British Columbia, co-directed by Roger Mathews, Wendy Matthews and Kamal Rasheed Raheem. Surface survey has recorded evidence of a spread of Neolithic artefacts, including chert and obsidian. Test trenches were excavated to establish the extent of Early Neolithic occupation, which is thought to cover an area of 100 x 50m. A gradiometry survey has recorded evidence for Neo-Assyrian activity. Bestansur is on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. == Architecture == Occupation at the site consists of mud- brick and pis\u00e9 rectangular buildings. The use of plaster has been recorded. An infrared microspectroscopic study of plasters and pigments discovered from Building 8 found evidence for red and black pigments. A large-porticoed building, Building 5, contained a large oven. Evidence for activities taking place in the external areas surrounding the buildings include hearths, butchery and stone-working waste. == Community == Numerous burials have been discovered beneath floors at the site, including 72 individuals beneath the floor of a single-room in Building 5. == References == == External links == * Bestansur - MENTICA project Category:Archaeological sites in Iraq Category:Neolithic sites of Asia Category:Neolithic settlements Category:World Heritage Tentative List Category:Sulaymaniyah Governorate Category:Former populated places in Iraq ",
