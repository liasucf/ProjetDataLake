    "text": "\"It Only Takes a Minute\" is a 1975 song by Tavares. The song was the group's only Top 10 pop hit in the United States, peaking at number 10, and their second number one song on the American soul charts. On the US Disco chart, \"It Only Takes a Minute\" spent five weeks at #2 and was the first of four entries on the chart. The song was subsequently covered by Jonathan King performing as 100 Ton and a Feather in 1976 and by boy band Take That in 1992. ==Charts== Tavares did not release their original version in the UK until 1986 when it could only reach No 46 in the UK Singles Chart. It was the last of their ten hits in the UK. Jonathan King's version peaked at number nine for two weeks in July 1976, and number 10 in Ireland. It would prove to be the last of his six Top ten UK singles in a career that started in 1965 with \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\". ===Weekly charts=== ;Tavares {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1975) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|17 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990 - | style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- |US Billboard Hot Soul Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 |align=\"center\"|10 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1986) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|46 |- |} ;One Hundred Ton and a Feather/Jonathan King {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1976) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- | |- |UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1975) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |CanadaBac-lac.gc.ca | style=\"text-align:center;\"|114 |- |US Billboard Hot 100Musicoutfitters.com | style=\"text-align:center;\"|86 |- |US Cash Box | style=\"text-align:center;\"|70 |- |} ==Take That version== Released in June 1992, by boyband Take That, it was the fourth single from the band's debut album, Take That & Party.
