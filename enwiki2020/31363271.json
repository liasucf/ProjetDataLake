From 1524 till 1527, he also acted as an imperial governor in the second Imperial Government. == Life == Philip was the fifth son of the Margrave Christopher I of Baden and Ottilie of Katzenelnbogen. His father intended to avoid splitting the inheritance and regarded Philip as his most capable son, so he wanted Philip to inherit the sovereignty over all his territories. He intended Philip to marry with Joan, the heiress of Margrave Philip of Hachberg- Sausenbergaccording to August Huber: About Basel's share of the R\u00f6tteln succession dispute in 1503, In: Basler Journal of the History and Archaeology, Volume 4 (1905), p. 84, Philip was educated at the court of Philip of Hachberg-Sausenberg and his father Rudolf IV \u2014 a junior branch of the House of Baden branch line, so that Philip would become sovereign of a considerable territory. The plan failed due to resistance of the French king. Because of the resistance of Philip's worldly brothers,four other brothers had chosen a career in the church Christopher later changed his will twice. Philip's brother Bernhard III inherited the holdings on the left bank of the Rhine, his brother Ernest inherited the baronies Hachberg, Usenberg, Sausenburg, R\u00f6tteln and Baden Castle in Badenweiler in South Baden. Philip fought on the French side in the Italian Wars. In 1501 he commanded a ship in the French fleet, that supported the Venice in the war against the Turks. During his reign, Philip was confronted a wave of rebellions all over southern Germany. In a continuation of the Bundschuh movement and again under the leadership of Joss Fritz the peasants stood up and fought for their rights. This often led to abuse and violence. The rebels marched through Durlach to the monastery Gottesaue, which was looted and completely destroyed \u2014 under the eyes of the Margrave. He responded by attacking the homes of the rebels and for example in Berghausen three houses were set on fire. The real aim, however, was the territory of the bishop George of Speyer, who finally escaped to the court of the Elector Palatine in Heidelberg. It wasn't until 1525 that Elector Louis V and his army managed to end the insurgency. On 25 May 1525, Philip I concluded the Treaty of Renchen with his peasants. He died in 1533 without male heirs. Of his six children only his daughter Maria Jakob\u00e4a (1507\u20131580) survived him. In 1522, she married Duke William IV of Bavaria. His two brothers, Ernest and Bernhard III divided his estate among themselves \u2014 the resulting margraviates of Baden-Durlach and Baden-Baden were reunified in 1771. == Grave == grave of Philip I of Baden The grave of the Margrave Philip I of Baden is located in the Collegiate Church in Baden-Baden.
