PBL had an enrollment of 472 students for the 2016\u201317 school year. ==History== In 1990, declining enrollment at Buckley-Loda High School led to a consolidation with Paxton High School. A new school building was constructed to field all of the students, and the histories of the individual schools were left behind as the new PBL collaboration took effect. The current high school draws students from five Illinois counties, but the bulk of the student body hails from Ford and Iroquois counties. ==Demographics== PBL is 93 percent white, six percent Hispanic, and one percent black. ==Academics== Paxton- Buckley-Loda offers Advanced Placement classes. About a third of PBL students take an AP class. ==Performing arts== PBL has a competitive show choir, nicknamed \"Unlimited\". ==References== Category:Educational institutions established in 1990 Category:Public high schools in Illinois Category:Education in Ford County, Illinois Category:1990 establishments in Illinois ",
