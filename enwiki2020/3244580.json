    "text": "Bisade Ologunde (in Lagos, 1960) is a Nigerian afrobeat musician, singer- songwriter and percussionist. Widely known as L\u00e1gb\u00e1j\u00e1 for his signature use of mask which covers his identity. He believes in social reform through music. ==Identity== Ologunde adopted the name L\u00e1gb\u00e1j\u00e1 (meaning \u2018anonymous\u2019 or \u2018faceless one\u2019 in Yoruba) as he embarked on his career in the early 90s. His name was reflected in his choice of stage attire - a slitted textile and rubber mask adopted so that the artist represented the \u2018common man\u2019 in keeping with the carnival tradition of his Yoruba tribe. He formed his first small band in 1991 in Lagos after he had taught himself to play the saxophone. With a high quotient of percussion instruments including congas and talking drums Lagbaja's album We Before Me (IndigeDisc/PDSE) released in 2000 demanded honesty from politicians and urged brotherhood and unity. He shared lyrics of his songs with a backup singer, Ego Ihenacho,and equally plays tenor saxophone. With a firm, brawny tone akin to that of John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders, he emblazoned the melodies of the songs, sometimes with Ego scat- singing along. == Awards == *2006 Channel O Music Video Awards \u2013 Best Male Video (\"Never Far Away\")BBC: Channel O Spirit Of Africa Music Video Awards 2006 == Discography == * 'Ikira', 1993 * Lagbaja, 1993 * Cest Un African Thing, 1996 * ME, 2000 * WE, 2000 * We and Me Part II, 2000 * ABAMI, 2000 * Africano... the mother of groove, 2005 * Paradise, 2009 * Sharp Sharp, 2009 * 200 Million Mumu (The Biiter Truth), 2012 ==See also== *List of Yoruba people ==References== ==External links== *Lagbaja's official home page Category:Nigerian male musicians Category:Nigerian saxophonists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Nigerian songwriters Category:Yoruba musicians Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Lagos Category:20th- century Nigerian musicians Category:21st-century Nigerian musicians Category:English-language singers from Nigeria Category:Yoruba-language singers Category:20th-century saxophonists Category:21st-century saxophonists Category:20th-century male musicians Category:21st-century male musicians ",
