    "text": "Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild is the second studio album by American alternative rock band CKY. Recorded between November 2001 and February 2002 at studios in Hawaii, Pennsylvania and California, it was produced by the band's lead guitarist and backing vocalist Chad I Ginsburg with lead vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller and released on September 24, 2002 by Island Records. The album was the band's first to chart, reaching number 99 on the US Billboard 200. In contrast to CKY's 1999 debut album Volume 1, the songwriting for which was originally credited solely to the band's frontman Miller, Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild featured equal songwriting credits for all three members of the band, including lead guitarist Ginsburg and drummer Jess Margera. Once again, bass on the album was performed by Miller (as well as some by Ginsburg), with live bassist Vernon Zaborowski (who replaced Ryan Bruni in 2000) left off the record completely. Much like its predecessor, Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild was praised by a number of music critics for its wide range of musical styles, as well as specific elements such as its guitar riffs. Music videos were produced by Bam Margera and Joe Frantz for all ten tracks on the album, which were released on the video album Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild: The Video Album in 2003. \"Flesh Into Gear\" was released as a single in 2002, reaching number 38 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. ==Recording and production== Recording for Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild took place at Audio Resource in Honolulu, Hawaii, Studio 4 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and 4th St. Recording and Westlake Audio in Santa Monica, California; mixing was completed at Westlake Audio. Production was led by guitarist Chad I Ginsburg, with vocalist Deron Miller credited as a co-producer. Ginsburg also mixed the album, which was mastered by Howie Weinberg. Recording began in November 2001 and was completed by February 2002. Many of the songs featured on the album were written and recorded in the form of demos years previously: early recordings of \"Flesh Into Gear\" (originally titled \"Sinking Fast\"), \"Sink Into the Underground\", \"Attached at the Hip\", \"Plastic Plan\" (originally titled \"No Such Thing\"), \"Inhuman Creation Station\" and \"Sporadic Movement\" were featured on the videos CKY2K and CKY 3, and an early version of \"Close Yet Far\" (under the title \"Fairman's Song\") was included on the original pressing of Volume 2. Unlike on Volume 1, where songwriting was credited to Miller alone, writing for Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild was credited to all three band members: Miller, Ginsburg and drummer Jess Margera. The album is also the band's first to feature synthesizers, which were performed by Miller and Ginsburg. At least one song was intended for inclusion on the album, but later removed \u2013 \"Dropped and Doublecrossed\", an early version of which was released under the name \"Dropped\" on Volume 2, which was later reworked and released on the band's 2009 fourth studio album Carver City under the name \"Plagued by Images\". ==Promotion and release== CKY continued its affiliation with the video series of the same name, as several early recordings of songs from Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild were featured on the videos CKY2K and CKY3 prior to the release of the album. The album was released on September 24, 2002 as an enhanced CD featuring music videos for \"Flesh Into Gear\" and \"Attached at the Hip\", although the original pressing had a glitch which prevented the videos from playing. \"Flesh Into Gear\" was also released as a single, reaching number 38 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. The group began touring the US in promotion of the album, but in November was invited by Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose to perform in Vancouver, British Columbia as the opening warm-up act for the Chinese Democracy Tour, just three days before it was due to begin. However, due to a delayed flight blamed on \"mechanical troubles\", Rose failed to arrive to Vancouver in time and the show had to be cancelled, inciting riots started by audience members. It was later announced that CKY would return to perform on the remainder of the United States leg of the tour, which was ultimately cancelled almost a month early. CKY toured extensively in promotion of the album, with high-profile slots supporting bands such as Metallica. In November 2003 the band released Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild: The Video Album, featuring music videos for all ten tracks on the album, as well \"96 Quite Bitter Beings\" and \"Disengage the Simulator\", behind the scenes footage, a photo gallery, and a documentary titled \"CKY: Chopped & Sliced\". ==Composition== ===Lyrics=== Speaking about the lyrics on Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild, PopMatters writer Nikki Tranter proposed that many of the songs on the album are written about \"the decaying state of humanity\", in contrast to the possibly more common themes of \"odes to ex-girlfriends or a corrupt governmental structure\". The reviewer also noted that many songs \"deal with [a] need for some kind of freedom\", noting \"Close Yet Far\", \"Attached at the Hip\", \"Frenetic Amnesic\" and \"Sink Into the Underground\" as examples of this description. \"Escape from Hellview\" is the third song in the band's \"Hellview\" song series, which started with previous band Oil's \"Thanks for the Ride\" and Volume 1 opening track \"96 Quite Bitter Beings\". The track is described by Bradley Torreano of music website AllMusic as an \"infectious tale of friends hanging from trees and the deafening silence of loneliness\". ===Music=== Many reviews of the album noted the variety of musical styles present on Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild, which was described in a positive manner. AllMusic's Torreano dubbed \"Escape from Hellview\" a \"metal anthem\", suggested that \"Plastic Plan\" showcased a \"disco beat and lifting melodies\", and described \"Sporadic Movement\" as \"gothic metal\". Tranter of PopMatters offered many of the same descriptions in her review, also describing \"Close Yet Far\" as a \"sultry pop-rock ballad\" and including \"Flesh into Gear\" and \"Frenetic Amnesic\" alongside \"Escape from Hellview\" in the bracket of \"neat heavy rock tunes\". She concluded that the album is \"impossible to label\". A review on Punknews.org suggested that many bands mix musical genres and \"end up sounding pieced together and unnatural\", contrasting that CKY's attempt gave them \"a sound distinctly their own\", highlighting the guitar riffs, electronic elements, and distortion effects as contributing factors. Sputnikmusic identified stylistic similarities with stoner rock, punk rock and groove metal acts, while Billboard magazine described its sound as \"sometimes reminiscent of classic metal ... [with] a jagged punk edge\", describing the material as \"aggressive, yet melodic\". ==Reception== ===Commercial=== Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild was the first album released by CKY to register on a music chart, reaching number 99 on the US Billboard 200. Outside of the US, it also reached number 108 on the UK Albums Chart and number 10 on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart. According to Miller, as of August 2015 the album had sold over 315,000 copies, making it the best-selling CKY album. ===Critical=== Media response to Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild was generally positive. AllMusic's Torreano awarded the album four out of five stars, describing it as \"an irony-free exploration of heavy music that goes straight for the gut and keeps on punching\". He praised the band's variety of styles on the release, highlighting tracks such as \"Escape from Hellview\" and \"Sporadic Movement\". PopMatters writer Tranter was similarly positive, describing IDR as \"an album of expert modern rock tunes, bursting with intelligent ... lyrics and first- rate, progressive musical experimentation\". Punknews.org's review praised the album's writing and production, noting that it is \"a definite progression from their previous work\" but claiming that it \"has some brief moments that become almost too poppy for its own good\", namely on \"Plastic Plan\". Sputnikmusic's review also named \"Plastic Plan\" as a particularly weak point of the album, criticising the \"crowbarred into place\" chorus and claiming that it lets the album down. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Deron Miller \u2013 lead vocals, guitars, bass, Moog synthesizers, co-production *Chad I Ginsburg \u2013 guitars, vocals, bass, Moog synthesizers, production, mixing, photography *Jess Margera \u2013 drums *Donat Kazarinoff \u2013 engineering, mix engineering *Marty Bolin \u2013 engineering *Phil Nicolo \u2013 engineering *Joe Fisher \u2013 additional engineering *Jeff Kahn \u2013 additional engineering *Jesse Gorman \u2013 mix engineering *Roger Lian \u2013 digital editing *Howie Weinberg \u2013 mastering *t42design \u2013 art direction, design *Jina Dierolf \u2013 additional artwork *Adam Wallacavage \u2013 photography *Lance Dawes \u2013 photography *Ryan Gee \u2013 photography *Bam Margera \u2013 music video direction *Joe Frantz \u2013 music video direction ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Chart !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Albums (OCC) |108 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Rock & Metal Albums (OCC) |10 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200 |99 |} ==See also== *Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild: The Video Album ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 albums Category:CKY (band) albums Category:Island Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Westlake Recording Studios ",
