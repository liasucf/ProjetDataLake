    "text": "Ignacio Pi\u00f1eiro Mart\u00ednez (May 21, 1888 - March 12, 1969) was a Cuban musician, bandleader and composer whose career started in rumba and flowered in the rise of the son. He was one of the most important composers of son music; in total he wrote about 327 numbers, mostly sones.Giro, Radam\u00e9s (2007). Diccionario enciclop\u00e9dico de la m\u00fasica en Cuba, Vol. 3. Havana, Cuba: Letras Cubanas. p. 236. Pi\u00f1eiro was a brilliant rumbero who worked with musical groups from 1903 onwards. In 1906, was a member of the Timbre de Oro coro de clave y guaguanc\u00f3 (a vocal group precursor of contemporary guaguanc\u00f3), and later directed Los Roncos, another famous coro de guaguanc\u00f3. He was taught the double bass by Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera, and in 1926 he was a member of her band, Sexteto Occidente, which recorded in New York City. In 1927 he founded the Sexteto Nacional de Ignacio Pi\u00f1eiro, later simply known as Sexteto Nacional, in which he was the director and songwriter. With the addition of a trumpet the band became the Septeto Nacional. For financial reasons, Pi\u00f1eiro quit the group in 1935; it was then led by trumpet player L\u00e1zaro Herrera until the group disbanded in 1937. Pi\u00f1eiro became for some years the leader and principal songwriter of Los Roncos. The Septeto Nacional was recreated several times from 1954 onwards, initially under Pi\u00f1eiro's direction, and it continues to perform. Pi\u00f1eiro's composition \"\u00c9chale salsita\" (written on a train to Chicago in 1930, and the first song use of the world \"salsa\" in son) influenced George Gershwin's Cuban Overture. The two met when Gershwin visited Cuba in February 1932.\"George Gershwin and his Cuban overture\". Cubasi.com. Many of Pi\u00f1eiro's songs have been performed by other artists like Ray Barretto (\"Don Lengua\") and Ren\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez (\"A la lae la la\"). In 1999, Pi\u00f1eiro was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame. == Compositions == *\"D\u00f3nde estabas anoche\" (1925) *\"Asturias, patria querida\" (lyrics, 1926) *\"Don Lengua\" *\"A la lae la la\" *\u201dEsas no son cubanas\" *\"Mentira\" *\"Bardo\" *\"Mayeya, no jueges con los santos\" *\"Las cuatro palomas\" *\"Noche de conga\" *\"Coco mai mai\" *\"Suavecito\" (1929) *\"\u00c9chale salsita\" (1930) *\"Lindo yamb\u00fa\" *\"Guaguanc\u00f3 callejero\" *\"Lejana campi\u00f1a\" *\"Buey viejo\" *\"Lleg\u00f3 la tora\" == References == Category:1888 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Cuban bandleaders Category:Cuban songwriters Category:Male songwriters Category:Cuban bassists Category:Rumba musicians Category:Cuban people of Asturian descent Category:People from Havana Category:Son cubano musicians ",
