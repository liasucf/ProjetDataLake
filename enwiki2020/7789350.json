The southern half of the lake is located within the cities of Menasha and Neenah. The name \"Butte des Morts\" was given by French settlers, and means \"Mound of the Dead\" in reference to a nearby Indian burial mound.

In 1716, during the Fox Wars, French expeditionary forces laid siege to the fort, in the battle of the Siege of Little Butte des Mortes, and massacred most of the inhabitants.
