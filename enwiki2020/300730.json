    "text": "In sound processing, the mel-frequency cepstrum (MFC) is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound, based on a linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear mel scale of frequency. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are coefficients that collectively make up an MFC. They are derived from a type of cepstral representation of the audio clip (a nonlinear \"spectrum-of-a-spectrum\"). The difference between the cepstrum and the mel-frequency cepstrum is that in the MFC, the frequency bands are equally spaced on the mel scale, which approximates the human auditory system's response more closely than the linearly-spaced frequency bands used in the normal cepstrum. This frequency warping can allow for better representation of sound, for example, in audio compression. MFCCs are commonly derived as follows: # Take the Fourier transform of (a windowed excerpt of) a signal. # Map the powers of the spectrum obtained above onto the mel scale, using triangular overlapping windows. # Take the logs of the powers at each of the mel frequencies. # Take the discrete cosine transform of the list of mel log powers, as if it were a signal. # The MFCCs are the amplitudes of the resulting spectrum. There can be variations on this process, for example: differences in the shape or spacing of the windows used to map the scale,Fang Zheng, Guoliang Zhang and Zhanjiang Song (2001), \"Comparison of Different Implementations of MFCC,\" J. Computer Science & Technology, 16(6): 582\u2013589. or addition of dynamics features such as \"delta\" and \"delta-delta\" (first- and second-order frame-to-frame difference) coefficients.S.

MFCCs are also increasingly finding uses in music information retrieval applications such as genre classification, audio similarity measures, etc. ==Noise sensitivity== MFCC values are not very robust in the presence of additive noise, and so it is common to normalise their values in speech recognition systems to lessen the influence of noise. Some researchers propose modifications to the basic MFCC algorithm to improve robustness, such as by raising the log-mel-amplitudes to a suitable power (around 2 or 3) before taking the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), which reduces the influence of low-energy components.V. Tyagi and C. Wellekens (2005), , in Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2005. Proceedings. (ICASSP \u201905).

Sometimes both early originators are cited. Many authors, including Davis and Mermelstein, have commented that the spectral basis functions of the cosine transform in the MFC are very similar to the principal components of the log spectra, which were applied to speech representation and recognition much earlier by Pols and his colleagues.L.
