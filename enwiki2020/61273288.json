    "text": "Juan Bravo (Llico, Arauco, 1865 - ?) was a Chilean Navy sailor of mapuche origin, hero of the naval Battle of Punta Gruesa during the War of the Pacific. Juan Bravo distinguished himself in the Battle of Punta Gruesa where he while onboard of the schooner Covadonga sniped down numerous Peruvians on board of the ironclad Independencia. == Early years == He was born in Llico (Arauco). His parents were both mapuches, and the name of his father probably was Manuel Millacura. Juan escaped from home along with his friends when he was 12 years old. He changed his surname to Bravo and enlisted in the Chilean Navy as Cabin Boy in 1877. == War of the Pacific == In 1879, the War of the Pacific broke out the war of Chile against Bolivia and Per\u00fa. The Cabin Boy Bravo was part of the crew of the schooner Covadonga, a ship that participated in the blockade of city of Iquique. On May 21, 1879, two Peruvians ships, the monitor and the armored frigate Independencia, arrived to Iquique with the intention of lifting the siege to the port. Both ships fought against the two Chilean ships in charge of the blockade: the wooden-hulled steam corvette and the schooner Covadonga, commanded by Captains Arturo Prat Chac\u00f3n and Carlos Condell, respectively. While the Esmeralda faced the Hu\u00e1scar in the naval Battle of Iquique, the Covadonga headed south and moved towards the Cheura\u00f1ete Bay, being pursued by the Independence frigate. Finally, the two containers met in the so-called naval combat of Punta Gruesa. Bravo climbed into the top of the mast of the Covadonga and used his Comblain rifle to contain the artillerymen of the Independence, killing 16 Peruvian sailors, leaving the cannon of the bow unused until the surrender of the Peruvian ship. Upon arriving in Valpara\u00edso, he was rewarded for his participation in combat. At that time he was only 14 years old. ==References== Category:1865 births Category:Chilean people of Mapuche descent Category:People from Arauco Province Category:Chilean Navy personnel of the War of the Pacific Category:19th-century Chilean Navy personnel Category:19th-century Mapuche people Category:Military snipers Category:Mapuche sailors Category:Year of death missing ",
