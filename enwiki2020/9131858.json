    "text": "Lori Copeland (born June 12) is an American author of over 95 novels. ==Biography== Lori Copeland had a relatively late start in writing, breaking into publishing in 1982 when she was forty years old. Over the next dozen years, Copeland's romance novels achieved much success, as was evidenced by her winning the Romantic Times Reviewer's Choice Award, The Holt Medallion, and Waldenbooks' Best Seller award. Despite her success in more mainstream romantic fiction, in 1995, Copeland decided to switch focus. Her subsequent books have been in the relatively new subgenre of Christian romance. She has also collaborated with author Angela Elwell Hunt on a series of Christian romance novels. Copeland has been inducted into the Missouri Writers Hall of Fame. She and her husband of over forty years, Lance, live in Springfield, Missouri. They have three grown sons. Copeland and her husband are active supporters of mission work in Mali, West Africa. ==Bibliography== ===Malone Family=== *Darling Deceiver (1990) *Built to Last (1992) *A Taste of Temptation (1992) ===Harlequin Love and Laughter=== *Dates and Other Nuts (1996) *Fudgeballs and Other Sweets (1998) ===Brides of the West=== *Faith (1998) *Faith, June, Hope (omnibus) (1998) *June (1999) *Hope (1999) *Glory (2000) *Glory, Ruth and Patience (omnibus) (2000) *Ruth (2002) *Patience (2004) ===Morning Shade Mysteries=== *A Case of Bad Taste (2003) *A Case of Crooked Letters (2004) *A Case of Nosy Neighbors (2004) ===Island of Heavenly Daze=== *The Island of Heavenly Daze (2001) (with Angela Elwell Hunt) *Grace in Autumn (2001) (with Angela Elwell Hunt) *A Warmth in Winter (2001) (with Angela Elwell Hunt) *A Perfect Love (2002) (with Angela Elwell Hunt) *Hearts at Home (2003) (with Angela Elwell Hunt) ===Belles of Timber Creek=== *Twice Loved (2008) *Three Times Blessed (2009) *One True Love (2010) ===Men of the Saddle=== *The Peacemaker (2005) *The Drifter (2005) *The Maverick (2005) *The Plainsman (2006) ===Seattle Brides=== *A Bride for Noah (Oct 2013) *Rainy Day Dreams (Apr 2014) ===Sisters of Mercy Flats=== *Promise Me Today (1992) *Promise Me Tomorrow (1993) *Promise Me Forever (1994) ===Western Sky=== *The Courtship of Cade Kolby (1997) *Outlaw's Bride (2009) *Walker's Wedding (2010) ===The Dakota Diaries Series=== #Love Blooms in Winter (2011) #Under the Summer Sky (2012) ===The Amish of Apple Grove Series=== #The Heart's Frontier (with Virginia Smith) (2011) #A Plain & Simple Heart (with Virginia Smith) (August 2012) #A Cowboy at Heart (with Virginia Smith) (March 2013) ===Novels=== *Playing for Keeps (1983) *A Tempting Stranger (1983) *Only the Best (1984) *A Winning Combination (1984) *All or Nothing (1984) *Out of Control (1984) *Rainbow's End (1984) *Forever After (1985) *Spitfire (1985) *More Than She Bargained for (1985) *A Love of Our Own (1986) *Hot on His Trail (1986) *Out of This World (1986) *Tug of War (1986) *When Lightning Strikes (1986) *Passion's Folly (1987) *The Trouble With Thorny (1988) *Tale of Love (1988) *Sweet Talkin' Stranger (1989) *Dancy's Woman (1989) *Tall Cotton (1990) *Fool Me Once (1990) *Avenging Angels (1990) *Tiz the Season (1990) *Sweet Hannah Rose (1991) *Passion's Captive (1991) *Melancholy Baby (1991) *Squeeze Play (1991) *Forever, Ashley (1992) *Like Father, Like Son?
