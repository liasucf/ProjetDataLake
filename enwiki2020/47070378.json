    "text": "Torradovirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently six species in this genus including the type species Tomato torrado virus. Diseases associated with this genus include: torrado disease: severe necrosis of leaves and fruits. ==Taxonomy== Group: ssRNA(+) ==Structure== Viruses in Torradovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries, and T=pseudo3 symmetry. The diameter is around 30 nm. Genomes are linear and segmented, bipartite, around 25.4kb in length. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Structure || Symmetry !! Capsid !! Genomic arrangement !! Genomic segmentation |- |Torradovirus||Icosahedral||Pseudo T=3||Non- enveloped||Linear||Monopartite |} ==Life cycle== Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by tubule-guided viral movement. Plants serve as the natural host. The virus is transmitted via a vector (whitefly). Transmission routes are vector and mechanical. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Host details !!
