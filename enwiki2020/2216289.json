    "text": "Salami tactics, also known as the salami-slice strategy or salami attacks, is a divide and conquer process of threats and alliances used to overcome opposition. With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated \"slice by slice\" until it realizes, usually too late, that it is virtually gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several factions within the opposing political party and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the 'sliced' sides to protest. Salami tactics are most likely to succeed when the perpetrators keep their true long-term motives hidden and maintain a posture of cooperativeness and helpfulness while engaged in the intended gradual subversion. ==Origins== It was commonly believed that the term salami tactics () was coined in the late 1940s by Stalinist dictator M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi to describe the actions of the Hungarian Communist Party in its ultimately successful drive for complete power in Hungary.Bullock, Alan, edited by Alan Bullock and Oliver Stallybrass The Harper dictionary of modern thought, Harper & Row, 1977. R\u00e1kosi claimed he destroyed the non-Communist parties by \"cutting them off like slices of salami.\"Time Magazine. \"Hungary: Salami Tactics\" Time Magazine (April 14, 1952). Retrieved March 15, 2011 By portraying his opponents as fascists (or at the very least fascist sympathizers), he was able to get the opposition to slice off its right-wing, then its center, then most of its left-wing, so that only fellow travellers willing to collaborate with the Communist Party remained in power.Safire, William, Safire's Political Dictionary, Oxford University Press, 2008 (revised), p.639, , . However, no verified source for the origins of the \"salami tactics\" term has ever been discovered. According to historian Norman Stone, the term might have been invented by the leader of the Hungarian Independence Party Zolt\u00e1n Pfeiffer, a hardline anti-communist opponent of R\u00e1kosi. ==Later usage== The People's Republic of China has been accused by Indian army officials, Brahma Chellaney, and the Observer Research Foundation of using salami tactics for territorial expansion against its neighbors like India, Japan and countries in the South China Sea region, Tibet, Aksai Chin, and the Paracel Islands. ==Cultural references== ===In television=== Salami tactics are discussed by the British Chief Scientific Adviser in the Yes, Prime Minister episode, \"The Grand Design\". ===In film=== In the 2016 film Arrival, Agent Halpern mentions a Hungarian word meaning to eliminate your enemies one by one. It is thought that this alludes to szal\u00e1mitaktika. Indeed, this is cited in Amazon Prime X-Ray (1:07:50). ==See also== *Boiling frog *Creeping normality *Entryism *Salami slicing *Wedge issue ==References== ==Further reading== *Horvath, John. 2000.
