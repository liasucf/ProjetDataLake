The settlement is surrounded by vineyards in the east and west. The Zalaszentiv\u00e1n Train Station is not far from the village. It has a bus connection to the county seat in Zalaegerszeg. ==History== Its first written mention was made in 1414, called \"Possessio Olywanchfalwa\". In the 16th century, the Turks repeatedly destroyed the village. By the end of the century, it had become uninhabited. On November 6, 1699, Hungarian King Leopold I donated an estate to T\u00f3r\u00f3dy Mih\u00e1ly and his wife, Mih\u00e1ly Farkas, S\u00e1godi \u00c9va P\u00e9ter. At the beginning of the 18th century Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI donated a landholding to the Boldogfai Farkas family in 1716 and gradually re-established the village. In 1871 it was united with the originally independent port of Lukafa. From the 1950s, a significant portion of Alibaanfa's population was working in Zalaegerszeg, but Zalaszentiv\u00e1n holds most of the administrative and educational institutions. == References == Category:Populated places in Zala County ",
