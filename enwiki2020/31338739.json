    "text": "St. Florian's Cathedral, more formally known as the Cathedral of St. Michael the Archangel and St. Florian the Martyr (), is a Catholic church and historic landmark at ul. Floria\u0144ska 3 () in eastern Warsaw. The 75-meter towers of St. Florian\u2019s Cathedral dominate eastern Warsaw's Praga district and highlight the cathedral\u2019s role as a form of protest against the erstwhile Russian domination of Poland. ==History== There has been a Catholic church presence in or around the site of the future church since 1583, but the impetus for creating a lasting and substantial church did not arrive until the late 19th century. The map of Europe was redrawn during the Congress of Vienna and the resulting territorial maneuvers placed the Duchy of Warsaw under the control of the Russian Empire, transforming it into the Congress Poland.Nicolson, Sir Harold (2001). The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity: 1812\u20131822 Grove Press; Rep. Ed. pp. 140-164. Among other intrusions, over twenty Russian Orthodox churches were built in Poland.Wortman, Richard S. (2000). Scenarios of Power: Myth and Ceremony in Russian Monarchy. Volume Two: From Alexander II to the Abdication of Nicholas II. Princeton University Press. pp. 254\u2013255. . To protest against the perceived imposition of a foreign church, and in direct reaction to the monumental Orthodox Church of Mary Magdalene built down the street, St Florian\u2019s was built with two commanding 75-meter (250-foot) towers between 1897-1904.

The church is named after St. Florian, the patron saint of professions associated with fire, such as firefighters, steelworkers, chimney sweeps, potters and bakers. ==World War II destruction== During and after the Siege of Warsaw, churches were used as a hiding place for Jews, the Warsaw Army (Armia Warszawa) and as a general refuge for civilians. St. Florian's was destroyed by the Germans as they withdrew from Poland in 1944 after the Warsaw Uprising.Warsaw Uprising 1944, WarsawUprising.com, developed and maintained by Project InPosterum. Retrieved March 30, 2011. The church remained in ruins for several years, but by the 1950s a reconstruction effort slowly began with support from Praga residents. The rebuilt church was reopened in 1972. ==Role in church hierarchy== St Florian's is the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Warszawa- Praga and by order of the Holy See was raised to the rank of minor basilica in 1992. Over four hundred priests form the ministry in this diocese covering 1,274 square miles, divided into 160 parishes and serving approximately one million Polish Catholics.Cheney, David M., \"The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church\", Catholic-Hierarchy.org. Retrieved March 30, 2011. ==Notable features== St Florian's is built in a Gothic Revival style distinguished by two twenty-story towers facing Al. Solidarno\u015bci (English: Solidarity Avenue), capped with bronze spires. Most of its exterior is made of red brick. Over the entrances are mosaic depictions of Jesus Christ and the emblem of the first bishop of Warsaw-Praga, Kazimierz Romaniuk, while the interior is decorated in red or white plaster and brick. ==See also== *Places of worship in Warsaw *National Temple of Divine Providence *St. Florian's Church, Krak\u00f3w ==Gallery== File:Bazylika Katedralna Sw Floriana.JPG File:PL Warsaw Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015aw.
