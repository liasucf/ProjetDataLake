    "text": "Louis Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Baillon (20 January 1778 \u2013 3 December 1855) was a French naturalist and collector. He was born in Montreuil-sur-Mer and died in Abbeville. His father, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Emmanuel Baillon (1742-1801), a lawyer and correspondent of the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle, introduced him to natural history. In 1798, Baillon began work at as an assistant at the Jardin des Plantes, a position he relinquished following the death of his father. Afterwards, he settled in Abbeville, and like his father, became known for his correspondence with famed naturalists. In his studies, the younger Baillon maintained correspondence with Franco Andrea Bonelli, \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied.Gouraud, C. (2015).

During his career, he continued and developed an ornithological collection that was initiated by his father, a collection that eventually grew to 6000 items. Baillon's collection (birds only) is now conserved in \"Mus\u00e9e George Sand et de la Vall\u00e9e noire\" in La Ch\u00e2tre. In addition to birds from France, it contains exotic specimens from French voyages of exploration, notably birds from the expeditions of Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re and Jules Dumont d'Urville.Gouraud, C.
