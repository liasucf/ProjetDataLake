    "text": "Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo (2 September 1921-29 July 1973) was the 34th President of El Salvador, in office from 1962 to 1967. Rivera was born in Zacatecoluca, El Salvador. He was a military officer who helped to orchestrate a coup in 1961. From January to September of that year, he was a member of the Civic-Military Directory which ruled El Salvador at that time. In 1962 he was elected President for a 5-year term as the candidate of the National Conciliation Party. As president, he signed the Alianza para el Progreso with the United States and accepted a good amount of money to build low-cost housing for Salvadorans, such as the Zacamil buildings and other public works. The Times Magazines from March 16, 1962, said \"Colonel Julio Rivera, is loosening the control of \"the 14,\" a group of land and banking families who have ruled the country since Spanish colonial days\", and recognized the biggest effort from the 19 Latin American countries that signed the document during the term of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. At the same time, he started a Secret Service called ANSESAL and the head of this agency was Coronel Medrano, a CIA informant. He is known to have started Death Squads in El Salvador using military intelligence and personnel. They would interrogate and eliminate leftist suspects in both the countryside and in the capital. After leaving public office he went on to serve as Ambassador of El Salvador to the United States and the United Nations. During his tenure as president, he was often seen driving through the streets of San Salvador on his 1965 Harley-Davidson motorcycle. From 1968 to 1973, he served as Ambassador to the United States. He died on July 29, 1973, aged 51. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:1973 deaths Category:People from La Paz Department (El Salvador) Category:Salvadoran people of Spanish descent Category:National Coalition Party (El Salvador) politicians Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:Salvadoran military personnel Category:Ambassadors of El Salvador to the United States Category:Permanent Representatives of El Salvador to the United Nations ",
