It was released on Thirsty Ear's Blue Series. ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek states \"Art of the Improviser serves as a testament to Shipp\u2019s achievements, yet it is also a continuation of the discovery in his developmental musical language.\" In a review for JazzTimes Mike Shanley says about the solo date \"Shipp tumbles around the keyboard but his ideas always seem fully developed no matter how rapidly he travels.\"Shanley, Mike. Art of the Improviser review at JazzTimes The All About Jazz review by Mark Corroto states \"With the release of Art Of The Improviser, he has essentially summed up his first fifty years on two CDs of resolute and committed music.\"Corroto, Mark.
