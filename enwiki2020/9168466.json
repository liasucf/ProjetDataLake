    "text": "Two Ocean Lake is located in Grand Teton National Park, in the U. S. state of Wyoming. The glacially formed lake is long and can be reached from a parking area adjacent to the lake. The Two Ocean Lake Trail is long and circles the lake passing through forests and clearings. The larger Emma Matilda Lake is one mile (1.6 km) to the south. Two Ocean Lake, in the northeastern portion of the park near Moran, was named for Two Ocean Pass about to the northeast where Atlantic Creek flows east and Pacific Creek flows west. Two Ocean Lake only flows into Pacific Creek so the name is a misnomer. ==See also== *Geology of the Grand Teton area ==References== Category:Lakes of Grand Teton National Park Category:Lakes of Teton County, Wyoming ",
