    "text": "The Siemens Desiro is a family of diesel or electric multiple unit passenger trains developed by Siemens Mobility, a division of the German Siemens AG conglomerate. The main variants are the Desiro Classic, Desiro ML, Desiro UK and the later Desiro City, Desiro HC and Desiro RUS. The trains are mostly used for commuter and regional services, and their rapid acceleration makes them suitable for services with short distances between stations. The design is flexible, and has become common in many European countries. ==Desiro Classic== === Austria === Austrian Federal Railways (\u00d6BB) is using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains designated as \u00d6BB 5022. These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have some additional safety equipment. === Bulgaria === A Bulgarian State Railways-operated Desiro train on the Sofia-Lakatnik line near Thompson. In 2005 and 2006, the Bulgarian State Railways began operating Desiro trains as part of a 67 million Euro deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them operating on the Sofia- Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another 117 million Euro deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BDZ and Siemens AG are intending to establish a joint venture company. The EMUs are designated classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas. === Czech Republic === Private railway company Arriva vlaky operates with two Desiro trains borrowed from Deutsche Bahn (DB).https://www.arriva.cz/cs/o-spolecnosti/novinky/siemens-desiro-na- lince-s49-11058 === Denmark === In Denmark, DSB has rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The trains were originally used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia, although they have since been moved to service on Lille Syd. On 2 July 2009 DSB signed a contract for eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen, with an option for 92 more.. The trains entered service on 12 December 2010, also servicing Odderbanen from December 2012. Grenaabanen and Odderbanen shut in 2016 for their re-purposing for a light rail network in Aarhus and its satellite towns. The trainsets were moved to Svendborgbanen, whose rolling stock was in turn moved to Lille Syd. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its operations. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains. === Germany === Two Class 642s in Germany Germany's Deutsche Bahn introduced two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of , these Class 642 units are mainly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units purchased by DB in 2007, various private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs. The Class 642 is equipped with two MTU diesel engines with an output of each and hydro- mechanical transmission with retarders. It typically contains 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be operated together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the M\u00fcglitz Valley Railway, have encouraged greater passenger numbers. Originally DB intended to operate together modern DMUs purchased from different manufacturers, but due to software incompatibilities this proved to be impossible. Therefore, the Class 642 can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the Class 643. === Greece === OSE Desiro EMU In Greece eight diesel DMU-2 Desiro trains (OSE class 660) were temporarily in service with the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE) during 2004\u20132006, and again in 2007 on the Athens\u2013Chalkida line and on the Athens suburban railway lines (Proastiakos). Afterwards they were returned to their owner (Hellenic Shipyards S.A.) in December 2007. In the late 2008 Hellenic Shipyards/MAN-FERROSTAAL leased the eight units to Hungary with a contract for 20 years. OSE owns and TrainOSE operates twenty electric Desiro EMU-5 (OSE class 460) equipped for the 25-kV overhead catenary system. They operate on the Athens - Kiato, Athens - Athens International Airport and Athens - Chalkis suburban lines and as a stopping service on the mainline between Thessaloniki and Larissa, which is also advertised as a suburban service. OSE is in litigation with the joint venture of Siemens & Hellenic Shipyards for the supply of those 20 Desiro. === Hungary === At present 31 diesel Desiros are in service with M\u00c1V (including the eight units from Greece), mainly as suburban trains on the regional line between Debrecen - Nagykereki and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an express train between Budapest and Baja. Also used as local trains between F\u00fczesabony and Debrecen and InterRegio train between Gy\u0151r and Balatonszentgy\u00f6rgy via Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagram on the north shore of the Lake Balaton. === Malaysia === KLIA Ekspres-operated Desiro ET 425 M Electric Multiple Unit train The Express Rail Link line, an airport rail link service between KL Sentral railway station in central Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur International Airport to the south, uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units (which are technically similar to DBAG Class 425 sets in Germany).Siemens - Express Rail Link Kuala Lumpur 12 trainsets are currently in operation: Eight trains are used for the non-stop KLIA Ekspres service between KL Sentral and the airport, while another four trains call at three intermediate stations in between, including one serving Putrajaya. These EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of making them the fastest trains currently operating in Malaysia. === Romania === A Desiro train in Romania at Otopeni Aeroport Station C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne (CFR), Romania's national railway operator, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets (as the light train variant). CFR, which is currently undergoing modernisation, has bought 120 diesel Desiro trainsets and uses them for both its \"Inter Regio\", and \"Regio\" services, but mainly on its \"Regio\" trains. The trains are nicknamed \"S\u0103geata Albastr\u0103\" (Blue Arrow). There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were considered to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mainly on its medium- and short-distance routes. For example, it is planning to use them as part of a proposed commuter link in Bucharest and Ilfov county. For more information on routes, see C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne. === Slovenia === S\u017d Series 312 at Ljubljana station Slovenian Railways operates 30 electric Desiro units that are designated as Desiro EMG 312 SR 31E. They are used as commuter stopping trains on electrified lines, i.e., from Ljubljana to Koper, Jesenice (via Kranj), Maribor and Dobova (via Zidani Most). === United States === SPRINTER of San Diego The Sprinter light rail system employs VT642 Desiro diesel units. It serves Northern San Diego County, California, United States between Oceanside and Escondido along a railway line. Twelve married pairs were delivered in August 2006 to the operator North County Transit District (NCTD). Service began on 9 March 2008, serving fifteen stations. Mountain Rail, one of two competing coalitions bidding on a large portion of FasTracks in Denver, appeared to be proposing a Siemens Desiro ML derived vehicle that is Federal Railroad Administration compliant. Both EMU and DMU units would have been used for the Northwest Corridor, North Metro Corridor and Gold Line. Electric traction was eventually chosen for the project. == Desiro Mainline == === Austria === Wien Floridsdorf train station in Vienna In April 2010 \u00d6BB signed a framework agreement for up to 200 Desiro ML trains.Desiro ML framework to meet \u00d6BB's expansion plans. Railway Gazette International 20 April 2010. The first such trains entered service on the Vienna S-Bahn in 2015, branded as cityjet. === Belgium === Antwerpen-Centraal in Antwerp In 2008 NMBS/SNCB ordered 305 Desiro ML trains. In 2013, the order of the final 250 trains was suspended because of technical problems with the trains already running. The company is seeking damages from Siemens for these problems which caused many delays. Siemens had already been fined \u20ac25 million for the late delivery of the first batch of trains. The order for all units was confirmed in 2013 and in March 2015 the last two arrived. In August 2014 the head of the NMBS/SNCB explained to the newspapers that the Desiro trains need repairing too often, i.e., at a rate of one technical intervention per 8000 kilometers.Les nouveaux trains Desiro, pas fiables?, La Libre Belgique, 13 August 2014 The trains are used heavily on the Brussels Regional Express Network, but also InterCity lines between Antwerp and Ghent and on lines electrified with 25kV AC in the Belgian Ardennes where they replaced diesel- trains. === Germany === German class 460 Desiro ML Mittelrheinbahn is used by the private rail operator trans regio for regional services between Cologne and Mainz on the left bank of the Rhine. The EMUs are leased from Angel Trains and received the class number 460 by the Eisenbahnbundesamt, the federal railway authority (the unpowered middle carriages have the class number 860). The 15 kV AC overhead line EMUs have a top speed of ; however they are limited by the EBA to on account of insufficient braking power from . All cars use conventional bogies and additional middle carriages can be added later. == Desiro RUS == === Russia === First Russian Lastochka Desiro RUS, designated ES1, is broad gauge electric commuter and regional train developed for Russian railways, which calls them Lastochka (). In January 2013 RZD began putting into service the first 18 trains from the initial order for 38. In mid-2013 a joint venture between Siemens and Ural Locomotives began production of the second batch of 16 trains at a factory in Ekaterinburg. The first train was assembled in June 2014. 62% of its components were produced locally. The factory is expected to supply 240 trains by 2021. In 2011 RZD ordered 1,200 cars from Ural Locomotives. Local content is to be increased to 80 percent. Siemens also has an order for maintenance of rolling stock for a period of 40 years. The contracts with the Siemens is estimated at 2.5 billion euros. ES2G is an urban version being used since 2016 on the . A total of 207 trainsets of all Lastochka types were delivered as of January 2020. == Desiro UK == === Thailand === Desiro for Suvarnabhumi Airport Link's city line, Bangkok, Thailand Nine 25 kV AC Desiro UK EMUs based on the Heathrow Connect Class 360/2 are used for the Suvarnabhumi Airport Link which provides express and local services between Phaya Thai Station and Suvarnabhumi Airport.Bangkok Airport Express to change city travel. Railway Gazette International 1 December 2005. === United Kingdom === Siemens uses the name Desiro UK for the DMU and EMU trains operated by various United Kingdom train operators. These trains have a completely different design to the lighter Desiro Classic variant. The trainsets have modern equipment such as toilet waste retention tanks, ergonomic seats, and automated information displays with spoken announcements. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Class !! Image !!
