    "text": "The Chamber Music Society of Detroit, founded in 1944, is the tenth oldest chamber music series in the United States as recognized by Chamber Music America. The core of the Chamber Music Society of Detroit's offerings is a nine-concert chamber music series and a three-concert piano series which bring world-class performers to metropolitan Detroit. Complementing the concert series are a comprehensive education program in Detroit area schools, an international classical music award, a Pre-Concert Talk series and other events. The Chamber Music Society presents its concerts at Seligman Performing Arts Center, located on the campus of Detroit Country Day School in Beverly Hills, Michigan. ==History== The Chamber Music Society of Detroit presents its series at the 724-seat Seligman Performing Arts Center, located on the campus of Detroit Country Day School in Beverly Hills, Michigan. Founded in 1944 by radio musical educator Dr. Karl Haas, the Chamber Music Society of Detroit began as an informal association of people brought together for the purpose of listening to chamber music. Dr. Haas instituted lectures (the forerunners to his \"Adventures in Good Music\" internationally syndicated radio programs) at the Detroit Public Library to inform the public about upcoming concerts. During its first ten seasons, the Chamber Music Society of Detroit (known in its earliest years as the Chamber Music Festival) presented its concerts at the Detroit Institute of Arts Lecture Hall. Until the late 1960s, Chamber Music Society of Detroit ensembles often comprised the first chair musicians of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, including such artists as Josef Gingold and Mischa Mischakoff, as well as Dr. Haas himself as pianist. In 1969, the leadership of the Chamber Music Society passed from Karl Haas to Dr. Zalman \u201cTiny\u201d Konikow; from this point forward, the Chamber Music Society of Detroit invited touring artists and ensembles from around the globe to perform on its series. During his 25-year tenure as president, Tiny Konikow showcased the talents of many up-and-coming musicians. Most notable are the Chamber Music Society of Detroit's early presentations of Emanuel Ax, Gidon Kremer, Yo-Yo Ma, Murray Perahia and the Tokyo String Quartet, as well as near-annual performances by the Guarnieri Quartet and the Beaux Arts Trio. Under Tiny Konikow's leadership, the Chamber Music Society of Detroit played a crucial role in the preservation and renovation of Detroit's Orchestra Hall by becoming, in 1978, its first permanent tenant since the Detroit Symphony had left the hall decades before.\"Ushering in the Musical Greats,\" Detroit Free Press, October 6, 1976; See also: Chamber Music Society of Detroit archive files, Detroit Public Library, Department of Music and Performing Arts In 1995, Lois R. Beznos became President of the Chamber Music Society of Detroit, after serving as Chair of the Board of Trustees since 1987. Under Lois Beznos' tenure as president, the Chamber Music Society more than tripled its subscriber base and its budget while developing community collaborations, adding professional staff and instituting comprehensive education programs. She established a collaboration with the Wayne State University Department of Music in 1995, introducing master classes by Chamber Music Society of Detroit series artists. Gradually increasing its scope over the years, the education program has evolved into an intensive Two-Week Ensemble Residency Program encompassing 15 or more school and community collaborations throughout metropolitan Detroit. In 1996, the Chamber Music Society of Detroit, along with seven other Chamber music presenters in the United States, including the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and the Freer Gallery of Art at the Smithsonian Institution, was selected to present in perpetuity the winner of the Cleveland Quartet Award.http://www.chamber- music.org/programs/gr_awards.html\"awards Then, in 2001, Lois Beznos worked with the members of the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio and nineteen other presenters nationwide to establish a biennial award to recognize and provide performance opportunities for a gifted early-career piano trio. The Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson International Trio Award continues to be managed by the Chamber Music Society of Detroit. In December 2010, Lois R. Beznos stepped down from the presidency of the Chamber Music Society of Detroit. After a national search, she was succeeded by Dr. Stephen Wogaman, a pianist and former student of Beaux Arts Trio pianist Menahem Pressler. ==Chronology== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | 1944 | Founded by Karl Haas |- | 1944\u20131968 | Karl Haas, President |- | 1969\u20131994 | Zalman \"Tiny\" Konikow, President |- | 1995\u20132010 | Lois R.

Over 3,500 students participate each year, and 1,400 students participate in the culminating feature of the program: student concerts presented at the same venue where Chamber Music Society of Detroit series concerts are presented. The program has reached many thousands of students since its inception in 1995. The Borromeo String Quartet, Brentano String Quartet, Cypress String Quartet, Miami String Quartet, Pacifica Quartet and Shanghai Quartet have participated in the Two-Week Residency Program.

In addition to these participating ensembles, pianist Menahem Pressler, violinists Joseph Silverstein and William Preucil and clarinetist Richard Stoltzman have presented master classes. In 2010-2011, two members of The Romeros conducted the residency, marking the first time a guitar ensemble has participated in the program. ==Kalichstein- Laredo-Robinson International Trio Award== Chamber Music Society of Detroit president Lois Beznos formulated the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson International Trio Award (KLRITA), which was announced at Carnegie Hall in 2001. The KLRITA has a twofold purpose: a biennial piano trio award, it derived its impetus first from the desire to honor the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio during its then 25th anniversary season and in perpetuity. Secondly, the award was created to encourage and enhance the careers of accomplished and extraordinarily promising young piano trios, to be chosen every other year in perpetuity. The KLRITA is supported in part by a contribution to its endowment fund made by each of twenty participating chamber music presenters. Presenters then have the benefit of an endowed concert, paid for by the award endowment fund, every other season in perpetuity. The winning trios are presented on the series of all of the following twenty participating trio award presenters during a two-year award tour period: Ames Town & Gown Chamber Music Association (IA); Arizona Friends of Chamber Music (AZ); Carnegie Hall (NY); Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts (CA); Chamber Music Cincinnati (OH); Chamber Music Monterey Bay (CA); Chamber Music Sedona (AZ); Chamber Music Society of Detroit (MI); Chamber Music Society of Louisville (KY); Chamber Music Society of Utica (NY); El Camino College Center for the Arts (CA); Friends of Chamber Music - Kansas City (MO); Irving S.

Kravis Center for the Performing Arts (FL); Naples Philharmonic Center for the Arts (FL); Purdue Convocations - Purdue University (IN); San Antonio Chamber Music Society (TX); Thomasville Entertainment Foundation (GA); University of Chicago Presents (IL) In addition to being presented on the series of these twenty presenters, winning trios are awarded a CD recording contract provided by Azica Records and benefit from the services of string instrument dealer Kenneth Warren & Son, Ltd., one of the oldest string instrument dealerships in the U.S. The following trios are the winners of the first four cycles of the KLRITA: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |- | 2003 | Claremont Trio | Tour period: 2004-2005, 2005\u20132006 |- | 2005 | Trio con Brio Copenhagen | Tour period: 2006-2007, 2007\u20132008 |- | 2007 | ATOS Trio | Tour period: 2008-2009, 2009\u20132010 |- | 2009 | Morgenstern Trio | Tour period: 2010-2011, 2011\u20132012 |} == References == == Sources == *Cohn, Fred (January/February, 2009). \u201cMaking Good in Motown\u201d, Chamber Music Magazine. *Heyman, Barbara B.
