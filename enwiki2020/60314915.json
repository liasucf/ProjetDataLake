    "text": "In the field of numerical analysis, particle methods discretize fluid into particles. Particle methods enable the simulation of some otherwise difficult types of problems, at the cost of extra computing time and programming effort. Some of particle methods are meshfree methods and vice versa. ==History== One of the earliest particle methods is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, presented in 1977.Gingold RA, Monaghan JJ (1977). Smoothed particle hydrodynamics \u2013 theory and application to non-spherical stars.

The main drawbacks of SPH are inaccurate results near boundaries and tension instability that was first investigated by Swegle.Swegle, J.W., Hicks, D.L., Attaway, S.W. (1995). Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Stability Analysis. Journal of Computational Physics. 116(1), 123-134 In the 1990s a new class of particle methods emerged. The reproducing kernel particle methodLiu, W.K., Jun, S., Zhang, Y.F. (1995), Reproducing kernel particle methods, International Journal of Numerical Methods in Fluids. 20, 1081-1106. (RKPM) emerged, the approximation motivated in part to correct the kernel estimate in SPH: to give accuracy near boundaries, in non-uniform discretizations, and higher-order accuracy in general. Notably, in a parallel development, the Material point methods were developed around the same timeD. Sulsky, Z., Chen, H. Schreyer (1994). a Particle Method for History-Dependent Materials.

During the 1990s and thereafter several other varieties were developed including those listed below. ==List of methods and acronyms== The following numerical methods are generally considered to fall within the general class of \"particle\" methods.
