    "text": "The Salmon Bay Bridge, also known as Bridge No. 4, is a Strauss Heel-trunnion single-leaf bascule bridge spanning across Salmon Bay and connecting Magnolia/Interbay to Ballard in Seattle, Washington. The bridge is located just west of Commodore Park. It carries the main line of the BNSF Railway on its way north to Everett and south to King Street Station and Seattle's Industrial District. The Salmon Bay Bridge, which is located west of the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, is the last bridge to span the Lake Washington Ship Canal before it becomes Puget Sound. Built in 1914 by the Great Northern Railway, it has an opening span of and has two tracks. Additionally, vessel clearance when lowered is 13.1 meters (43 feet) at mean high tide, and up to 15.3 meters (50 feet) at low tide. A project to replace the current single-leaf bascule bridge with a vertical-lift bridge is currently being planned by BNSF Railway. left Salmon Bay Bridge from the Ballard Locks left ==References== == External links == left *Essay on the bridge by Greg Pierce Category:Bridges in Seattle Category:Bascule bridges in the United States Category:BNSF Railway bridges Category:Railroad bridges in Washington (state) Category:Bridges completed in 1914 Category:Great Northern Railway (U.S.) bridges Category:1914 establishments in Washington (state) Category:Steel bridges in the United States ",
