    "text": "The Cheers were an American vocal group, that had a string of novelty hits in the mid-1950s starting with \"(Bazoom) I Need Your Lovin'\" which hit number three on the U.S. chart in 1954. This was the first hit written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller to chart on the pop chart in the United States, and was one of the first rock and roll hits by a white group (after The Crew Cuts and Bill Haley and the Comets). The following year, they followed it with \"Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots\" (also written by Leiber and Stoller), a song about a wild-living leather-jacketed motorcyclist, which went to number six on the charts, and became a million-selling record. The Cheers' members included Bert Convy (1933-1991) who would later serve as host of several daytime television game shows such as Tattletales, Super Password, Win, Lose or Draw and 3rd Degree, Susan (Sue) Allen and Gil Garfield (1933-2011). All three were living in Los Angeles at the time they began making records: Garfield was attending the University of Southern California and Convy had just graduated from UCLA when they teamed up with vocalist Allen. \"The Terrors of Highway One O One.\" Hit Parader, January 1956, p. 5.
