The French captured her in 1805 during her second voyage for the East India Company and sold her to Danish owners. The British recaptured her in January 1808, and within a year thereafter she was again in her former owner's hands. She then made several more voyages for the company. ==Career== ===First EIC voyage (1803\u20131804)=== Captain Thomas Larkins sailed Warren Hasting for China, leaving The Downs on 6 April 1803 and arriving at Whampoa on 28 August.British Library: Warren Hastings (2). Before she arrived she rescued a dozen or so Chinese sailors. A gale had caught their three \"tchuans\" and sunk them, causing the loss of some 500 people. The same gale had also caught the East Indiaman , causing her loss, together with that of the 120 or so people aboard her.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 15, p.467. Larkins had left Britain during the Peace of Amiens so he did not apply for a letter of marque. However, the Peace broke down in May 1803. Larkins received a letter of marque on 16 September, while he was in China. Homeward bound, Warren Hastings crossed the Second Bar on 1 February 1804. Warren Hastings was traveling in convoy with the fleet of East Indiamen returning from China, and under the command of Commodore Nathaniel Dance. On 14 February the China fleet encountered a small French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois. some shots were exchanged, but the East Indiamen were able to bluff Linois into withdrawing. Warren Hastings was directly engaged and the Indiamen reached Malacca on 19 February and Penang on 1 March. Warren Hastings was at St Helena on 7 June and arrived at The Downs on 8 August. ===Second EIC voyage and capture (1805)=== Larkins sailed Warren Hastings for Benkulen and China on her second voyage, leaving Portsmouth on 17 February 1805. She spent May\u2013July at St Helena and September\u2013October at Benkulen. However, on 21 June 1806, as Warren Hastings was on her way back from Canton, the French frigate Pi\u00e9montaise, under the command of Captain \u00c9pron, captured her at , in a noteworthy single-ship action.James (1837), Vol. 4, pp.239\u201344. Larkins put up a stubborn resistance for four hours. Casualties on Warren Hastings from the engagement amounted to seven killed and 13 wounded; casualties on Pi\u00e9montaise amounted to seven killed and five wounded. After Warren Hastings struck, the French boarding party stabbed Larkin, wounding him severely, and wounded four other officers and crew. Her captors took Warren Hastings to Mauritius where they arrived on 4 July. Thereafter the French initially used her as a prison ship. On 11 December 1806, Warren Hastings was sold with \"her tackle and apparel.\" The purchaser was a Danish company. One report has the Danish East India Company purchasing Warren Hastings as a replacement for Holstein, which had arrived at Port Louis on 21 July 1806 and been condemned.Publications... (1902), Vol. 20, p.369. (A report in the Madras Courier dated 10 February 1807 stated that the Danish company's ship Holstein was sailing from Copenhagen to Serampore when she was dismasted off Ceylon. She sailed to Mauritius for repairs.\"SHIP NEWS\". Morning Chronicle (London, England), Monday, September 21, 1807; Issue 11964.) The Danish East India Company named their newly-bought ship Holsten (II).Marcussen - Holsten (II) record card Reportedly she was wrecked in a cyclone at Bourbon Island towards end-December.

She left Calcutta on 11 September 1809, reached Madras on 24 September, and the Cape on 16 December. She was at St Helena on 27 January 1810 and arrived at Portsmouth on 8 April and Blackwall on 24 April.British Library: Warren Hastings (4). ===Fourth EIC voyage (1811\u20131812)=== Captain Gunter Lyde Browne sailed Warren Hastings to the Cape and China, leaving Portsmouth on 8 April 1811.
