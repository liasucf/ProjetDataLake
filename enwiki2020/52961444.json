Lawson and Councilwomen Carrie Johnson, Sadie E. Balsley, Mittie Josephine Golden, Emma K. Hamilton, and Hanna P. Morse. Mary D. (McGaha) Lowman (January 27, 1842 \u2013 June 12, 1912) was a schoolteacher and the mayor of Oskaloosa, Kansas, in the late 1880s. She was the first woman in Kansas to be elected mayor with a city council composed entirely of women. ==Biography== Mary D. McGaha was born on a farm in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. She became a schoolteacher and in 1866 married a man named George W. Lowman, with whom she had two children. They moved to Kansas and settle in the small town of Oskaloosa, where she became a teacher of recently emancipated black students. In 1885, she became the city's deputy county clerk and deputy register of deeds. In 1888, the women of Oskaloosa, dissatisfied with poor city management, decided to run an entire slate of women for municipal office. (Although American women did not yet have a national right to vote, Kansas women had been given the right to vote in some municipal elections one year earlier.) The \"Oskaloosa Improvement Ticket\" won by a two-to-one margin, making Lowman the first woman in Kansas to serve as mayor with a city council composed entirely of women. Newspapers across the country covered the unusual election of an all-women municipal administration. Lowman was elected only a year after Susanna M. Salter became the nation's first woman mayor. When Lowman and her council took office, the city treasury was empty and the city in debt. Lowman and her 5-member council were re- elected after their first year in office, with two members of the council being replaced by other women. After two years in office, Lowman and her council left the city with a replenished treasury. Lowman died in 1912 of burns received when her clothing caught fire at a cookstove. ==References== Category:1842 births Category:1912 deaths Category:Women mayors of places in Kansas Category:19th-century American politicians Category:People from Oskaloosa, Kansas Category:Deaths from fire in the United States Category:Mayors of places in Kansas Category:Accidental deaths in Kansas Category:People from Indiana County, Pennsylvania Category:19th-century American women politicians Category:Schoolteachers from Pennsylvania Category:Schoolteachers from Kansas Category:19th-century American educators Category:American women educators Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century Category:19th-century women educators ",
