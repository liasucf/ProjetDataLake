KJV *\"This is a faithful saying\" (, ): is a formula assuming 'general acceptance' and is stated 5 times in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 1:15; 3:1; 4:9; 2 Timothy 2:11; Titus 3:8). ===Verse 10=== :For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.
