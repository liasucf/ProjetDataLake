He made his competitive debut in the 2017 Singapore Community Shield, which doubled up as the first league game of the season, against Tampines Rovers FC. Although he missed glaring chances in the game, he managed to win his first piece of silverware as the White Swans came out 2-1 winners in an ill-tempered match. He scored his first goals for the club in a 5-0 demolition of the Garena Young Lions in match day 2 of the 2017 S.League season, bringing his tally to 2 goals in 2 games. He scored another brace in a 2-0 win over Hougang United FC, bringing his tally for the season to 5 goals in 5 games and helping his team to the top of the table. Tsubasa scored his 7th and 8th goals in the next match, helping Albirex to the top of the table and condemning Warriors FC to their first defeat of the season. It proved to be a good season for Sano and the White Swans as the Japanese satellite club swept all four pieces of silverware on offer in Singapore for a second consecutive year. Sano proved to be hugely influential, scoring 26 league goals to finish as the 2017 S.League top scorer as well as scoring a goal in the 2017 Singapore Cup final to help Albirex secure their fourth piece of silverware of 2017. In total, he had 31 goals in all competitions. === Roasso Kumamoto === After his impressive season in the S.League, Sano secured a move to J2 League side Roasso Kumamoto. ==Club career statistics== As of February 26, 2020.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./\u65e5\u672c\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u4f01\u753b\u51fa\u7248\u793e, \"J1&J2;&J3;\u9078\u624b\u540d\u9451\u30cf\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u7248 2019 (NSK MOOK)\", 9 February 2019, Japan, (p. 245 out of 289)Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./\u65e5\u672c\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u4f01\u753b\u51fa\u7248\u793e, \"J1&J2;&J3;\u9078\u624b\u540d\u9451\u30cf\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u7248 2018 (NSK MOOK)\", 7 February 2018, Japan, (p. 236 out of 289) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | League Cup ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
