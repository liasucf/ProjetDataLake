    "text": "Heidi is a Germanic feminine given name. It became an internationally popular first name as a direct result of the Swiss children's book, Heidi. It is an affectionate diminutive of the name Adelheid (English: Adelaide), which means \"nobility\" or, more loosely, \"of noble birth\". The name began to be used in the English-speaking world shortly after the 1937 Shirley Temple movie adaptation of the novel. In German-speaking countries, Heidi is also used as a diminutive for other names, such as Heidrun, Heidelinde, and Heidemarie. *Heidi Alexander (born 1975), British politician *Heidi Allen (born 1975), British politician *Heidi Andersson (born 1981), Swedish armwrestler *Heidi Andreasen (born 1985), Faroese swimmer *Heidi Androl (born 1980), candidate for The Apprentice:Los Angeles (US Season 6, 2005) *Heidi Astrup (born 1972), Danish handball player *Heidi Baker (born 1959), American missionary in Africa *Heidi Barrett (born 1958), Californian winemaker *Heidi Becker (born 1940), Austrian Playboy Playmate *Heidi Behrens-Benedict, American politician *Heidi Berry (born 1958), American singer-songwriter *Heidi Biebl (born 1941), German alpine skier *Heidi Blickenstaff (born 1971), American actress *Heidi Bohay (born 1959), American actress *Heidi Burge (born 1971), American basketball player *Heidi Chu (born 1977), Miss Hong Kong contestant *Heidi Collins (born 1967), CNN correspondent *Heidi Cortez (born 1981), American model *Heidi W.
