She is capable of performing geophysical survey and 3D sampling at the seabed in a depth up to . The vessel features a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), which can perform observations and sampling at a depth up to . Additional equipment allows survey of ocean current and analysis of physical, chemical and biological properties with the help of a CTD device for conductivity, temperature and depth. The vessel features a 12 t-capacity helipad for a helicopter suitable for day/night landing and take off. == Controversies == On August 13, 2020, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan announced that any attack on Oru\u00e7 Reis will incur a \"high price\" and suggested that Turkey had already acted on that warning.
