    "text": "Vision of Spain, also known as The Provinces of Spain, is a 1913\u201319 series of 14 monumental canvases by Spanish painter Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla depicting the customs, costumes, and traditions of regions of Spain. The series was commissioned by Archie Huntington for the Hispanic Society of America. ==Background== In 1911, Sorolla met Huntington in Paris and signed a contract to paint a series of oils on life in Spain. These 14 magnificent murals, range from 12 to 14 feet in height, and total 227 feet in length. The major commission of his career, it would dominate the later years of Sorolla's life. Huntington had envisioned the work depicting a history of Spain, but the painter preferred the less specific Vision of Spain, eventually opting for a representation of the regions of the Iberian Peninsula, and calling it The Provinces of Spain.Muller, Priscilla: \"Sorolla and America\", The Painter Joaquin Sorolla, p. 65. Despite the immensity of the canvases, Sorolla painted all but one en plein air, and travelled to the specific locales to paint them: Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Elche, Seville, Andalusia, Extremadura, Galicia, Guipuzcoa, Castile, Leon, and Ayamonte, at each site painting models posed in local costume. Each mural celebrated the landscape and culture of its region, panoramas composed of throngs of laborers and locals. By 1917 he was, by his own admission, exhausted.Muller, p. 67. He completed the final panel by July 1919.\"Yesterday afternoon I was able to do quite a lot of work on the picture, so that I hope to finish it today, the feast of St. Peter. That will be the end of more than six years' work, of suffering and struggle, with so much that was good and bad, especially at this stage\". (F.P. Sorolla, p. 29.) The Sorolla Room, housing the Provinces of Spain at the Hispanic Society of America, opened to the public in 1926.Felipe Gar\u00edn and Facundo Tom\u00e1s Visi\u00f3n de Espa\u00f1a.
