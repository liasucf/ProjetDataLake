Sycamore's service area includes twenty-six southern Indiana counties: Bartholomew, Brown, Clark, Crawford, Dubois, Daviess, Floyd, Gibson, Greene, Harrison, Jackson, Knox, Lawrence, Martin, Monroe, Morgan, Orange, Owen, Perry, Pike, Posey, Scott, Spencer, Vanderburgh, Warrick, and Washington. ==Conservation Successes== Since its founding in 1990, Sycamore has protected more than 9,000 acres of land on 100 parcels. Sycamore protects land by owning nature preserves, and by holding permanent conservation easements on privately owned land. Properties span fifteen Indiana counties, including Bartholomew, Brown, Crawford, Gibson, Greene, Harrison, Knox, Lawrence, Martin, Monroe, Morgan, Orange, Owen, Pike, and Vanderburgh Counties. Many of the properties that Sycamore owns outright have hiking trails and are open to the general public. In September, 2012, in its largest land protection project to date, Sycamore Land Trust acquired 1,043 acre tract adjoining the Patoka River National Wildlife Refuge and Management Area, one of three national wildlife refuges in Indiana. The property features forested wetlands, upland forests, and planted prairies which provide habitat for several threatened species such as the Indiana bat, bobcat, river otter, and copperbelly watersnake.http://sycamorelandtrust.org/news In August, 2012, Sycamore partnered with Capriole Farm in Greenville, IN to permanently protect the historic farmstead that gave rise to the internationally recognized Capriole Goat Cheese. Capriole is now the last working dairy farm in Floyd County. Earlier that summer, Sycamore acquired its first property in Vanderburgh County, Eagle Slough Natural Area. Due to its landscape of wetlands and bottomland forest, Eagle Slough provides an excellent habitat for more than 150 different species of birds. The property is also home to some of the largest bald cypress trees in the state of Indiana.http://sycamorelandtrust.org/news ==Nature Preserves== Beanblossom Bottoms Preserve.
