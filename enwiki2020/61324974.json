    "text": "Dale Schroeder (1919-2005) was a carpenter who worked 67 years for the same firm, Moehl Millwork, in Des Moines, Iowa. He lived frugally, owning only two pairs of blue jeans - one for work and one for attending church on Sundays. He never married or had children and his $3 million estate paid for the college education of 33 Iowans. Schroeder grew up poor and wanted to help people like himself attend college. As a result of his generosity, 33 beneficiaries have graduated from college or university without debt. They include both men and women. Many have trained as medical doctors and teachers. The final beneficiary received the final $80,000 of Schroeder's bequest and graduated as a therapist in 2019. ==See also== *Albert Lexie *Robert Morin (librarian) *Richard Leroy Walters ==References== Category:People from Des Moines, Iowa Category:American carpenters Category:1919 births Category:2005 deaths ",
