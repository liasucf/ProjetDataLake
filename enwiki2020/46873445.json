    "text": "T\u00fcllingen (Alemannic: D\u00fcllige) is a district of L\u00f6rrach, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. It is located on T\u00fcllinger Mountain, which is also known as T\u00fcllinger Hill or simply the T\u00fcllinger. Upper and Lower T\u00fcllingen were merged into the T\u00fcllingen district in 1935. ==Geography== ===Location=== T\u00fcllingen is a small village in the southwestern region of Germany in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Its coordinates are: Latitude 47\u00b036'07.6\"N (47.6021100\u00b0), Longitude 7\u00b038'39.3\"E (7.6442500\u00b0). The T\u00fcllinger Mountain (in Switzerland called T\u00fcllinger Hill) is of geological importance, elevated above the southern part of the city to a height of . It offers a view of the tri-border area as well as the so-called \"Rhine-Knee\" and surrounding cities like L\u00f6rrach, Weil am Rhein and Basel Today, large areas of the T\u00fcllinger have been declared a special area of conservation in order to preserve a space for local recreation.Landesarchivdirektion Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Landkreis L\u00f6rrach (Hrsg.): Der Landkreis L\u00f6rrach, Band II (Kandern bis Zell im Wiesental), Jan Thorbecke Verlag Sigmaringen 1994, , S. 84. Subsequently, the mountain has been designated as a protected area by the Habitats Directive. Due to the region's mild climate, the southwestern slope of the mountain is optimal for growing grapes, which are popular for regional products such as Markgr\u00e4fler Wine. As well, the exposed position of the mountain allows many weather stations to measure data for the weather forecasting. A small part of the T\u00fcllinger above the former public swimming pool in Riehen, Im Schlipf, is in Swiss territory. ===Neighbouring communities=== In the south, T\u00fcllingen shares a border with another village named Riehen, which is located on the Swiss border. The district of Stetten is located southeast of T\u00fcllingen. Further north is the center of L\u00f6rrach. North of T\u00fcllingen lies Tumringen, as well as \u00d6tlingen and Haltingen, which are districts of Weil am Rhein. Situated to the southwest of T\u00fcllingen is Alt-Weil (Old-Weil), which is located on the hillside. ===Geology and agriculture=== T\u00fcllinger Mountain is situated predominantly in the T\u00fcllinger softwater molasse. The molasse comprises vryenen marl and parts of the Alsace molasse. The mountain was created through a fracture zone.Mineralienatlas - T\u00fcllinger Berg The soil on T\u00fcllinger Mountain comprises loess, clay-saboulous, and chalky soils, which allows for the cultivation of grapes and other fruit. Closed vine-areas are located in the south between Baselweg, Lichsenweg, and the lower Wagenkehrweg in the direction of Alt-Weil. ==History== The first documented mention of T\u00fcllingen dates back to the year 1113 when Walcho von Waldeck donated his possessions to the St. Blaise Abbey, indicating that the settlement's name possibly derived from a personal name. In 1173, the village is mentioned in a writ of protection addressed to St. Blasien by the then Pope Callixtus III, in which the T\u00fcllinger Churches' possessions are named. The village has developed into becoming the road to R\u00f6tteln. T\u00fcllingen, among other villages, was affected by the Thirty Years War and the destruction of R\u00f6tteln in 1679 by French troops. On October 14, 1702, the Battle at K\u00e4ferholz resulted in heavy damage to the village. In 1767 the public water supply came from a new source, discovered between Higher- and Lower-T\u00fcllingen. The same year, the borders to R\u00f6tteln were confirmed. In the 17th and 18th century, disputes of allegiance occurred between T\u00fcllingen and neighbouring communities.Landesarchivdirektion Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Landkreis L\u00f6rrach (Hrsg.): Der Landkreis L\u00f6rrach, Band II (Kandern bis Zell im Wiesental), Jan Thorbecke Verlag Sigmaringen 1994, , S. 160. T\u00fcllingen officially became a district of L\u00f6rrach on October 1, 1935. ==Public buildings== The children's home Kinderheim T\u00fcllingerh\u00f6he can be found in Higher T\u00fcllingen. The Protestant church is responsible for the home. The children's home consists of an administration block, a canteen kitchen, a basic primary school, a secondary modern school, a special school and a junior high school that goes up to the seventh grade. There are eight living groups, therapy facilities, a gym and a sports field as well. Two of the living groups belonging to the children's home are located in Lower T\u00fcllingen. The old St.Ottilien Church in Higher T\u00fcllingen is illuminated and visible from a great distance in the evening. The L\u00f6rrach Channel is also located in Higher T\u00fcllingen. ==Emblem== The Emblem of T\u00fcllingen consists of two crossed golden swords on a blue background. It was introduced in 1901 to commemorate the Battle of Friedlingen which took place on October 14, 1702. ==Infrastructure== L\u00f6rrach and Weil am Rhein are separated by the T\u00fcllinger Mountain, a winding road leading over the T\u00fcllinger Mountain, and a railroad tunnel, built between 1888 and 1890. For decades, the communities had tried to reach an agreement on a tunnel that goes through Swiss territory in order to bypass the road over the T\u00fcllinger Mountain. In October 2013, the \"Zollfreie\" (literally: \"toll- free\") was opened. ==Well-known inhabitants== * Adolf Glattacker (1878\u20131971), German Painter and graphic artist. == Literature == * Stadt L\u00f6rrach (Hrsg.): Unser L\u00f6rrach 1972, eine Grenzstadt im Spiegel der Zeit.
