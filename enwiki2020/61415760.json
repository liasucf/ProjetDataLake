    "text": "Alexandre Vardin (born 18 September 1989) is a French footballer who plays as a full back for Ligue 2 club Le Mans. ==Life and career== Vardin began his football career at the age of 15 with Caen, courtesy of a youth development partnership in his native Guadeloupe. He went on play regularly for the club's B team. After six years at the club, he moved on to Quevilly, and was a member of their team that eliminated Olympique Marseille and Rennes from the 2011\u201312 Coupe de France to reach the final, in which they lost 1\u20130 to Lyon. He spent the 2012\u201313 season with another third-tier club, Boulogne, and then joined Sedan, newly demoted to the fifth-tier Championnat de France Amateur 2. He won two consecutive promotions with Sedan and played for them in the third tier before moving on in 2016 to Le Mans, where he went one better, winning three consecutive promotions, from fifth tier to second. He was included in France under-20's 28-man training camp ahead of the 2009 Jeux de la Francophonie, but did not make the cut. ==Honours== US Quevilly * Coupe de France runners-up: 2011\u201312 ==References== Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Guadeloupean footballers Category:French footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Stade Malherbe Caen players Category:US Quevilly-Rouen players Category:US Boulogne players Category:CS Sedan Ardennes players Category:Le Mans FC players Category:Championnat National 2 players Category:Championnat National players Category:Championnat National 3 players Category:Ligue 2 players ",
