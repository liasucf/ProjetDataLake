    "text": "Silver Bells is a 2005 Hallmark Hall of Fame Christmas made-for-television drama film starring Anne Heche and Tate Donovan based on the 2004 novel of the same name by Luanne Rice. It originally aired on CBS on November 27, 2005. ==Plot summary== Every year, widower Christy Byrne (Tate Donovan) has traveled from Nova Scotia with his children to sell their homegrown Christmas trees in New York City. His teenage son Danny (Michael Mitchell) is not into his father's business, but instead has a true passion for photography. One year in New York City, Danny is grounded by Christy after an argument until he gets his priorities straight, but runs away, leaving Christy and his 10-year-old daughter Bridget (Courtney Jines) to return home without him. The next year, the two return to New York City to sell the trees while Christy goes out every night looking for Danny. Catherine (Anne Heche) lives in the same New York neighborhood and hasn't celebrated Christmas since the year her husband died. Every year Christy has tried to sell her a tree, but Catherine politely refuses. Neither of them realize that their lives are connected by Danny. While Christy is back in Nova Scotia with Bridget, Catherine pays Danny for photographs that he takes and puts them in the newspaper. When Christy comes back the following year, Catherine does not tell him that she knows where Danny is because Danny made her promise not to. Catherine does tell Christy afterwards when Danny injures himself by falling off the roof of the Belvedere Castle and into a frozen pond. In the hospital, Christy tells Danny that he is allowing him to stay in New York City to become a photographer. ==Cast== * Anne Heche as Catherine O'Mara * Tate Donovan as Christy Byrne * Courtney Jines as Bridget Byrne *Michael Mitchell as Danny Byrne * John Benjamin Hickey as Lawrence * Lourdes Benedicto as Lizzie * Victoria Justice as Rose ==External links== * *\"Silver Bells\" at Hallmark Movie Channel Category:2005 television films Category:2005 films Category:2000s Christmas drama films Category:American films Category:American Christmas drama films Category:Christmas television films Category:Hallmark Hall of Fame episodes Category:CBS network films Category:Films directed by Dick Lowry Category:Films based on American novels Category:Television shows based on American novels ",
