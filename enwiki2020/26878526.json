He married twice and was the grandfather of the Mar\u00e9chal de Soubise. His first wife was the daughter of Madame de Ventadour. He is known in contemporary texts as the prince de Rohan. ==Biography== Born in Paris, he was the fourth of eleven children of Fran\u00e7ois de Rohan and Anne Julie de Rohan, whose marriage gave rise to the Soubise line of the House of Rohan. His family claimed ancestry from the reigning Dukes of BrittanyBy the time of Hercule M\u00e9riadec's birth, the Duchy of Burgundy had long been absorbed into the Kingdom of France which was then ruled by the House of Bourbon. Louis XIV was on the throne at the time of his birth and at the French court were allowed the rank of Foreign Prince. This entitled them to the style of Highness and other privileges at court. His mother was one-time mistress of Louis XIV. At the time, it was suspected that his younger brother Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan was in fact fathered by Louis XIV. Hercule M\u00e9riadec's mother bought the Lordship of Soubise to the family, styling themselves as Prince. Anne Julie herself was Princess of Soubise suo jure. The second son, Hercule M\u00e9riadec, became heir apparent in 1689 at the death of his elder brother Louis, who died aged 22. He was styled Prince of Maubuisson (prince de Maubuisson) till 1714 when he was made the Duke of Rohan-Rohan (as opposed to the Duke of Rohan, the title held by his cousins). He married twice, firstly to Anne Genevi\u00e8ve de L\u00e9vis, daughter of Louis Charles de L\u00e9vis and Charlotte de La Motte Houdancourt (better known as Madame de Ventadour, governess of the young Louis XV). Anne Genevi\u00e8ve had been widowed in 1692 having married Louis de La Tour d'Auvergne, son of Godefroy Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne and Marie Anne Mancini. He died in battle and she and Hercule M\u00e9riadec were married in Paris on 15 February 1694. The marriage produced five children, three of whom would have progeny. He lost her only son Jules to smallpox in 1724 as well as his daughter in law Anne Julie de Melun. His grandson Charles, Prince of Soubise, was born in 1710 and after the death of his parents, was raised by Hercule M\u00e9riadec himself to become a man of the court. Charles was later a great friend of Louis XV and the great-grandfather of the murdered Duke of Enghien through his eldest daughter Charlotte. His second daughter Charlotte Armande succeeded her aunt Anne Marguerite de Rohan as Abbess of Jouarre in 1721. Hercule M\u00e9riadec was responsible for some interior d\u00e9cor at the H\u00f4tel de Soubise engaging Germain Boffrand in the process. This dates from 1730 to 1740. He outlived his wife by 22 years; Anne Genevi\u00e8ve died in March 1727. The widowed Hercule M\u00e9riadec remarried on 2 September 1732 to Marie Sophie de Courcillon who was born in 1713 and had been a mistress of the famous womaniser Louis Fran\u00e7ois Armand de Vignerot du Plessis. Marie Sophie was the daughter of Philippe Egon de Courcillon and Fran\u00e7oise de Pompadour, Duchesse de La Valette. She was also the granddaughter of Philippe de Courcillon, marquis de Dangeau, and Princess Sophia of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort. He died in Paris on the Rue de Paradis.
