Bird became known for his images of nudes and jointly set up a studio, Photo Centre Ltd., with John Everard and Horace Roye in 1939. From 1958 he was chief photographer for J. Russell & Sons, eventually purchasing the business in 1961. From 1958 to 1967 he was the official photographer for the National Photographic Record, initiated by the National Portrait Gallery to record important and influential citizens. He was a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society. ==Life and work== Early in his career Bird worked mostly on advertising commissions and portraits that were published in periodicals such as Theatre World and Tatler. He shared his studios at Kinocrat House, 85, Cromwell Road, London with the photographer Joan Craven. He became famous for his images of nudes and was a rival of the photographers John Everard and Horace Roye. As the intense competition was harming their business, they eventually decided to cooperate instead, which led to them in 1939 setting up a joint company called Photo Centre Ltd. They made their headquarters in a suite of rooms above Bird\u2019s studio in Savile Row. Eves without Leaves (1940) was their first joint publication, which proved popular with Allied troops during the Second World War.Photographer John Everard In September 1940, however, the photographic studios were severely damaged by the German Luftwaffe during a bombing raid. During the war Bird served with the Crown Film Unit, before re-establishing his business at 46 Queen's Gate, London.'Obituary.
