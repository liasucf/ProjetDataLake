    "text": "Coat of arms of Quebec bearing the motto . ' () is the official motto of Quebec, a province of Canada. The motto, translated literally into English, means \"I remember\". It may be paraphrased as conveying the meaning \"We do not forget, and will never forget, our ancient lineage, traditions and memories of all the past\".Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, 1934 == Origins == \u00c9tienne-Paschal Tach\u00e9, of \"last cannon shot\" fame, is widely credited with having popularized the phrase.Donald Lowry, \"The crown, empire loyalism and the assimilation of non-British white subjects in the British world: An argument against 'ethnic determinism\" The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 31 No. 2 (2003), 103. In 1883, his son Eug\u00e8ne-\u00c9tienne Tach\u00e9, Assistant Commissioner for Crown lands in Quebec and architect of the provincial Parliament building, had the motto carved in stone below the coat of arms of Quebec which appears above the Parliament Building's main entrance door.Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec. \"La devise du Qu\u00e9bec\", in the site of the Government of Quebec, updated January 14, 2008, retrieved August 19, 2008 The motto then came into official use, even though the coat of arms was not adopted until 1939.Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"La devise \u00ab Je me souviens \u00bb\", in , online since September 14, 2001, updated May 20, 2006, retrieved August 19, 2008 == Meaning == on changing the guard ceremony in Quebec City Royal 22e R\u00e9giment badge at Citadelle of Quebec includes regimental motto Tach\u00e9 appears not to have left an explanation of the motto's intended meaning but, however, wrote a letter to Sim\u00e9on Lesage that showed what he intended to accomplish with the statues on the building's fa\u00e7ade and describing what they were intended to remind people of.Long excerpt of the letter found in ANQ- Qu\u00e9bec, Minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics, L.R. 768/83, dated April 9, 1883. Lesage was the deputy Minister of Public Works. All around the Parliament building are 24 statues of historical figures. They originally included founders (Jacques Cartier, Samuel de Champlain and de Maisonneuve), clerics (de Laval, de Br\u00e9beuf, Marquette and Olier), military men (de Frontenac, Wolfe, de Montcalm and de Levis), Amerindians, French governors (D'Argenson, de Tracy, de Calli\u00e8res, de Montmagny, d'Aillesbout, de Vaudreuil) and, in the words of Tach\u00e9, \"some English governors the most sympathetic to our nationality\" (Murray, Dorchester, Prevost and Bagot) and Lord Elgin, who was given a special place for he was seen as an important player in obtaining \"responsible government\". Tach\u00e9 purposely left blank spaces to allow future generations to add their own statues. His contemporaries, however, did not have any trouble interpreting its meaning. The first interpretations that can be cited are those of historian Thomas Chapais and civil servant Ernest Gagnon. Chapais, during a speech given for the occasion of the unveiling of a bronze statue honouring de L\u00e9vis, on June 24, 1895, said: \"the province of Quebec has a motto of which she is proud and which she likes enough to carve it on her monuments and palaces. This motto has only three words: ; but these three words, in their simple economy of expression, are worth more than the most eloquent speeches. Yes, we remember. We remember the past and its lessons, the past and its misfortunes, the past and its glories.\"\"\" In 1896, Gagnon wrote that the motto \"admirably sums up the of Champlain and Maisonneuve's Canada as a distinct province in the confederation.\"\"\" - Ernest Gagnon. \"\" in , Documents de la session, 1896, 1, doc. 7, p. 115-116. In 1919, seven years after Tach\u00e9's death, the historian Pierre-Georges Roy underlined the symbolic character of the three-word motto: \"which says so eloquently in three words, the past as well as the present and the future of the only French province of the confederation.\"\"\" - Pierre-Georges Roy (1919). , L\u00e9vis, 1919, p. 285. This sentence would be cited or paraphrased several times afterwards. Various scholars have attempted to discover the source of Tach\u00e9's words. The ethnologist Conrad Laforte has suggested that they might derive from the song , or possibly Victor Hugo's poem . Writer Andr\u00e9 Duval thought the answer was simpler and closer at hand: In the hall of the Parliament building in which the motto is carved above the door, are the arms of the Marquess of Lorne whose motto was (\"do not forget\"). Consequently, Duval believed \"the motto of Quebec to be at the same time the translation of the Marquess of Lorne's motto and the answer of a French-Canadian subject of Her Majesty to the said motto.\" Research published in English before 1978 led to the same conclusions regarding the motto's origin, the number of words it has and its interpretation. A 1934 biographical notice about Tach\u00e9 reads: \"M. Tach\u00e9 is also the author of the beautiful poetic and patriotic motto which accompanies the official coat of arms of the Province of Quebec \u2014 \u2014 the full significance of which cannot perhaps be readily expressed in English words but which may be paraphrased as conveying the meaning 'We do not forget, and will never forget, our ancient lineage, traditions and memories of all the past'.\" Encyclopedias and quotation dictionaries, including those of Wallace, Hamilton, Colombo or Hamilton and Shields, all provide the same information as the French-language sources. In 1955, the historian Mason Wade added his opinion by writing: \"When the French Canadian says , he not only remembers the days of New France but also the fact that he belongs to a conquered people.\"Mason Wade, The French Canadians, 1760\u20131945, Toronto, 1955, p. 47. == Controversy and \"second motto\" == Since 1978, the Quebec licence plate has featured the phrase \"Je me souviens\" In 1978, replaced the tourist-oriented motto on Quebec's vehicle registration plate. According to the historian Gaston Desch\u00eanes, this event marks the start of a new period of attempts to reinterpret the meaning of the motto in the mainstream media of Canada. On February 4, 1978, Robert Goyette signed an article entitled \"Car owners argue over motto\" in The Montreal Star. This article attracted the attention of a reader, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne P\u00e2quet, a granddaughter of Tach\u00e9 who replied on February 15 in an open letter entitled \". It reads in part: The lily refers to France while the rose refers to England, both relating to the floral emblems of the nations. The idea that the motto had a lesser known second part spread widely. This new piece of information had a long life in the media before it was investigated by Desch\u00eanes in 1992. When Desch\u00eanes contacted H\u00e9l\u00e8ne P\u00e2quet in 1992, she was unable to specify the origin of text she quoted in her letter. Her statements were not conformable to those of her father, Lieutenant-Colonel \u00c9tienne- Th\u00e9odore P\u00e2quet Jr.,Son of \u00c9tienne-Th\u00e9odore P\u00e2quet, a provincial MLA. who on March 3, 1939, wrote in a letter to John Samuel Bourque, T\u00e2ch\u00e9's son-in-law, and Minister of Public Works, that \"the one who synthesized in three words the history and traditions of our race deserves to be recognized\" as much as Routhier and Lavall\u00e9e who composed the \"O Canada\". The origin of the second part is today known to be a second motto, created by the same Eug\u00e8ne-\u00c9tienne Tach\u00e9, many years after the first one, and originally destined to be used on a monument honouring the Canadian nation, but which was never built. The monument was to be a statue of a young and graceful adolescent girl, an allegoric figure of the Canadian nation, bearing the motto: \"N\u00e9e dans les lis, je grandis dans les roses / Born in the lilies, I grow in the roses\". While the project was never realized, the idea was \"recycled\" in a commemorative medal for the 300th anniversary of the foundation of Quebec City, created by Tach\u00e9, on which is written (\"Born under the lilies, God helping, Champlain's work has grown under the roses\")., 1608-1908, Qu\u00e9bec, 1911, p. 22-23. == Other uses == is also the motto of the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment, a Francophone regiment of the Canadian Forces.Royal 22e R\u00e9giment Traditions ==See also== * , documentary film * List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols * , 1842 song by Antoine G\u00e9rin-Lajoie that includes == Notes == == References == ; English * Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"Je me souviens\", in HistoryWire, March 26, 2009 * Deschenes, Gaston. \"Gaston Deschenes on the motto mystery: deciphering the true meaning of Quebec's famous slogan, Je me souviens\", in The Beaver: Exploring Canada's History, February 1, 2008 excerpt ; French * Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"La devise qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise \u00ab Je me souviens \u00bb\", in , February 1, 2011 * Desch\u00eanes, Gaston. \"La devise \u00ab Je me souviens \u00bb\", in , online since September 14, 2001, updated on May 20, 2006 * Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec. \"La devise du Qu\u00e9bec\", in the site of the Government of Quebec, updated January 14, 2008 * Albert, Madeleine and Gaston Desch\u00eanes. \"Une devise centenaire : Je me souviens\", in , 14, 2 (April 1984), p. 21-30.
