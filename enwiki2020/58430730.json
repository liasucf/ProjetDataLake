    "text": "Michael David Kirchmann (born July 5, 1972) is an American real estate developer, architect, and designer and the founder and CEO of development and architecture firm GDSNY. His firm has designed and developed high end residential and commercial office properties such as 25 Mercer in SoHo, 177 Franklin Street in TriBeCa which was the Shinola flagship and headquarters, and the Emerson at 500 West 25th Street, adjacent to the High Line. The firm is currently developing class A office buildings at 205 West 28th Street, 120 Tenth Avenue, and 1245 Broadway, which is scheduled to open in 2021. Kirchmann's firm has also designed and renovated more than 4,000 units of affordable housing in New York City, including Campos Plaza in the East Village, Bronxchester Houses in the Bronx, Marcus Garvey Village in Brooklyn, and Arverne View in Rockaway, Queens. Formerly a Design Director at architecture firm Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, Kirchmann worked on projects across the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. ==Career== In 1997, he joined SOM in New York City, where he became a Director of the New York office. Notable completed projects include the corporate headquarters of Oracle in Paris, the Arcapita headquarters in Bahrain, and the Park Hotel in Hyderabad, which is the first LEED Platinum certified hotel in India. Kirchmann worked with SOM partner Roger Duffy on these projects. In 2007, and after a 10-year tenure at SOM, Kirchmann founded GDSNY, a design and real estate development firm with offices in New York. Notable projects include the Bahrain Bay master plan, 149 Kent Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the Dogpound gyms in New York and Los Angeles, and 25 Mercer. Kirchmann is a frequent lecturer and juror at Harvard University, New York University, Cityscape, MIPIM, the Architectural Association, Parsons School of Design, and the University of Pennsylvania. He taught in the Masters of Science in Real Estate program at Columbia University from 2010 to 2015 with SOM partner Chris Cooper and Vishaan Chakrabarti. ==Projects== Kirchmann has designed more than 4,000 units of low-income housing that have been completed in New York City, including the redevelopment at Arverne View (formerly known as Ocean Village) in Rockaway, Queens, a region that was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In 2015 Kirchmann designed the extensive renovation of the low income, 625-unit Marcus Garvey Village spread across nine city blocks, in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. Originally designed in 1973 by Kenneth Frampton, the project achieved notability at the time for its innovative urban planning approach to low-rise, high-density affordable housing. The renovated property was awarded the Building Brooklyn Award for Affordable Housing Preservation and the Affordable Housing Magazine Award of Excellence. In 2016 Kirchmann collaborated with Fabien Baron to design the Dogpound, an exclusive gym located in the West Village and reportedly frequented by Hollywood celebrities, Olympic athletes, and Victoria's Secret Angels, including Elsa Hosk, Adriana Lima, Josephine Skriver, and Romee Strijd. Kirchmann appeared in the 2017 season of Bravo\u2019s Million Dollar Listing New York with real estate broker Fredrik Eklund, who shows several units from Kirchmann's development at 25 and 27 Mercer Street. Kirchmann collaborated with American artist Leo Villareal to create enhanced environments integrating LED and video elements into the architecture at the Bahrain International Airport. Prior to starting renovation work on 25 and 27 Mercer Street for what would eventually become a luxury condominium development in two historic cast-iron buildings in SoHo, Kirchmann collaborated with British artist Shantell Martin, who installed drawings on two floors of the buildings, as well as light artist Matthew Schreiber, American Ballet Theatre dancer Kathryn Boren, and fashion photographer Nigel Barker. Some of Martin's drawings remained intact throughout construction and became part of the foundation of the building. ===GDSNY=== * 1245 Broadway, New York, New York (2020) * 205 West 28th Street, New York, New York (2021) * 118 10th Avenue, New York, New York (2022) * 177 Franklin Street, Tribeca, New York City (2012) * Marcus Garvey Apartments, Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York (2015) * Arverne View, Far Rockaways, Queens, New York (2015) * 25\u201327 Mercer Street SoHo, New York City (2016) * 149 Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, New York (2016) * Campos Plaza, East Village, New York (2016) * Bronxchester, Bronx, New York (2016) * The DOGPOUND, West Village, New York (2016) * The DOGPOUND, West Hollywood, California (2019) * 500 West 25th Street, Chelsea, New York (2018) ===Skidmore, Owings and Merrill=== * Portes de la Defense, Oracle Headquarters, Paris, France * Arcapita Bank Headquarters, Manama, Bahrain * The Park Hotel, Hyderabad, India * The Four Seasons Hotel, Manama, Bahrain * Defense Plaza, Paris, France * Arcs de Seine, Paris, France ==See also== *Roger Duffy *T.
