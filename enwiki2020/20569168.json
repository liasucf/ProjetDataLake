    "text": "The Jerring Award ( or \"Radiosportens Jerringpris\") is a prize established by Radiosporten, the sport section of Sveriges Radio, voted by its radio audience who choose the Swedish athlete or team that has made the best sport performance of the year. The prize is named after Swedish radio personality Sven Jerring. It is also called \"the prize of the people\", since it is the radio audience who vote. There has around 2010-2019 been criticism on the fact that there has been campaigns within sports with many amateurs, so that golf and horse jumping has been awarded. The first prize was awarded in 1979, and the winner was the alpine skier Ingemar Stenmark, and the person who has been awarded the most times is the biathlete Magdalena Forsberg, with four awards. ==All winners== Annika S\u00f6renstam has received the prize twice, in 1995 and 2003 Magdalena Forsberg has received the most Jerring Awards with four, in 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 *1979 - Ingemar Stenmark, alpine skiing *1980 - Ingemar Stenmark, alpine skiing *1981 - Annichen Kringstad, orienteering *1982 - IFK G\u00f6teborg, football men *1983 - Mats Wilander, tennis *1984 - Gunde Svan, cross-country skiing *1985 - Gunde Svan, cross-country skiing *1986 - Tomas Johansson, wrestling *1987 - Marie-Helene Westin, cross-country skiing *1988 - Tomas Gustafson, speed skating *1989 - Jan Bokl\u00f6v, ski jumping *1990 - Sweden national handball team *1991 - Pernilla Wiberg, alpine skiing *1992 - Pernilla Wiberg, alpine skiing *1993 - Torgny Mogren, cross-country skiing *1994 - Sweden national football team *1995 - Annika S\u00f6renstam, golf *1996 - Ludmila Engquist, athletics *1997 - Magdalena Forsberg, biathlon *1998 - Magdalena Forsberg, biathlon *1999 - Ludmila Engquist, athletics *2000 - Magdalena Forsberg, biathlon *2001 - Magdalena Forsberg, biathlon *2002 - Carolina Kl\u00fcft, athletics *2003 - Annika S\u00f6renstam, golf *2004 - Stefan Holm, athletics *2005 - Tony Rickardsson, speedway *2006 - Susanna Kallur, athletics *2007 - Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, football *2008 - Charlotte Kalla, cross-country skiing *2009 - Helena Jonsson, biathlon *2010 - Therese Alshammar, swimming *2011 - Rolf-G\u00f6ran Bengtsson, horse show jumping *2012 - Lisa Nord\u00e9n, triathlon *2013 - Henrik Stenson, golf *2014 - Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, swimming *2015 - Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, swimming *2016 - Peder Fredricson, horse show jumping *2017 - Peder Fredricson, horse show jumping *2018 - Hanna \u00d6berg, biathlon *2019 - Tove Alexandersson, orienteering, ski mountaineering, ski orienteering and skyrunning ==Wins per sport== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- |Wins |Sport |Years won |- |6 |Biathlon |1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2009, 2018 |- |5 |Athletics |1996, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006 |- |5 |Cross-country skiing |1984, 1985, 1987, 1993, 2008 |- |4 |Alpine skiing |1979, 1980, 1991, 1992 |- |3 |Football |1982, 1994, 2007 |- |3 |Golf |1995, 2003, 2013 |- |3 |Horse show jumping |2011, 2016, 2017 |- |3 |Swimming |2010, 2014, 2015 |- |2 |Orienteering |1981, 2019 |- |1 |Tennis |1983 |- |1 |Wrestling |1986 |- |1 |Speed skating |1988 |- |1 |Ski jumping |1989 |- |1 |Handball |1990 |- |1 |Speedway |2005 |- |1 |Ski mountaineering |2019 |- |1 |Ski orienteering |2019 |- |1 |Skyrunning |2019 |} ==See also== *Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal ==References== ==External links== Category:Sport in Sweden Category:Awards established in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in Sweden Category:Swedish sports trophies and awards ",
