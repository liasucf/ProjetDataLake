The company's headquarters are located in Toronto, and it also has corporate offices in New York City, London, Rio de Janeiro and Sydney. ==History== The company was founded in 1899, as the S\u00e3o Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company by William Mackenzie and Frederick Stark Pearson. Operating as in construction and management of electricity and transport infrastructure in Brazil. In 1904, the Rio de Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company was founded by Mackenzie's group. In 1912, Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company was incorporated in Toronto as a public company to develop hydro-electric power operations and other utility services in Brazil, becoming a holding company for S\u00e3o Paulo Tramway Co. and Rio de Janeiro Tramway Co. In 1916, Great Lakes Power Company was incorporated to provide hydro-electric power in Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma District in Ontario. In 1966, Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company changed its name to Brazilian Light and Power Company, and again in 1969, changed its name to Brascan Limited. Brascan is a portmanteau of \"Brasil\" and \"Canada\". In 1979, the company's Brazilian assets were transferred to Brazilian ownership (Eletropaulo and Light S.A.), the company meanwhile having diversified to other areas. The company provided electricity and tram services in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and the Brazilian side after a later restructuring still operates as Light S.A., short for Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Co. Ltd. In 2005, after 37 years, Brascan Corp. was renamed to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. In November 2008, in a process supervised by the Alberta courts, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed receiver of a separate public company, Birch Mountain Resources, after Birch Mountain had defaulted on its debts. Birch Mountain's assets of $50 million were transferred to Tricap Partners Ltd, which operates under the Hammerstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Brookfield Special Situations Group.\"Birch Mountain names receiver\" ,Calgary Herald, Canada, 7 November 2008 Retrieved 22 July 2012 In September 2010, a group called Birch Mountain Shareholders for Justice filed a lawsuit with the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, against Brookfield Asset Management challenging this acquisition and transfer of assets.Gray, Jeff. \"Squeezed-out Birch Mountain shareholders take on Brookfield\",The Globe and Mail, Canada, 15 November 2011 Retrieved 22 July 2012 After five years of litigation the case was dismissed.McDonald v Brookfield Asset Management Inc , 2015 ABQB 281 In May 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal which was also dismissed. In 2009, Brookfield sued financial and insurance giant American International Group (AIG) in a Manhattan federal court, alleging that AIG's collapse caused default provisions in interest-rate swaps. The suit stemmed from AIG's acceptance of a $182.3-billion bailout package from the federal government. The lawsuit backfired and the litigation ended with Brookfield agreeing to pay $905 million to settle the lawsuit. In 2013, a Brazilian prosecutor filed charges against the company's local division, alleging the company paid bribes to local officials, which is also a violation of U.S. federal criminal law. The bribes were allegedly used to pave the way for Brookfield to build a shopping center in S\u00e3o Paulo. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also opened a formal investigation into the company about the bribery charges. The company denied the charges. The U.S. Department of Justice also opened a criminal investigation into the company regarding these allegations, and did not end up making any arrests. According to the Stanford Law School Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Clearinghouse, which studied the case, the investigation and filing of charges was initiated by a whistleblower and anonymous tip. The company disclosed the investigations on several 6-K forms between 2013 and 2015.
