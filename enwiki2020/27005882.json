    "text": "Khoda Afarin Dam (also spelled as Khodaafarin Dam or Hudafarin Dam) is an earth-fill embankment dam on the Aras River straddling the international border between Iran and Azerbaijan. It is located west of Khomarlu in East Azerbaijan Province, Iran and southwest of Soltanl\u0131 in Jabrayil District, Azerbaijan. De facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic took control of the area in 1993, during the Nagorno-Karabakh War and it has remained under Armenian control ever since. Azerbaijani claims of recapturing the dam during the September 2020 War were unfounded. The purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power generation and irrigation. It was conceived as a joint project with the Soviet Union and both sides reached an agreement in October 1977. Designs were finalized in 1982, revised in the early 1990s and construction began in 1999. According to Armenian media reports, Iran made a secret agreement with Armenia (which controls Nagorno-Karabakh) to complete the project. The dam was complete and began to impound water in 2008. It was inaugurated in 2010. The irrigation works are still underway. During construction, several Bronze Age sites were discovered, including the grave of a Saka-Scythian warrior. The reservoir filling, or impoundment, was delayed in 2008 to accommodate excavations. The dam's power plant has an installed capacity of and is designed to irrigate .http://www.farab.com/en/field_of_activities/prjList.asp?abv=H ==See also== *List of power stations in Iran ==References== Category:Dams completed in 2008 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2008 Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Iran Category:Dams in Iran Category:Dams in Azerbaijan Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Azerbaijan Category:Earth-filled dams Category:Iran\u2013Soviet Union relations Category:Azerbaijan\u2013Iran relations Category:2008 establishments in Azerbaijan Category:2008 establishments in Iran ",
