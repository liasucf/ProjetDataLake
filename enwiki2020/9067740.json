The short was released on July 25, 1938, and stars Porky Pig. ==Plot== Porky Pig begins ploughing his land and planting seeds, with some help from his dog Streamline. They plant many kinds of vegetables. But when the crops are ripe, a rooster sells tickets to other chickens who make a self-servicing cafe out of the field. Porky notices and tries to chase them off, but they persist. He tries everything to get the chicken to leave from a scarecrow to sending his dog Streamline but to no avail. To protect the last of his crops, Porky makes a deal with the chickens to plant a separate vegetable garden for them. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:Warner Bros.
