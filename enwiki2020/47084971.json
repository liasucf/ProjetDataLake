    "text": "Jan Ziarnko, also known as Jean Le Grain, Kern and Grano, was a Polish draughtsman and printmaker. He was born in Lviv circa 1575 into a family with German ancestry and he died sometime around 1630, possibly in the same town. He is one of Poland\u2019s most respected graphic artists of the period. Not much is known about his early life and artistic formation; although in 1596\u20137 he appears as a member of the Brotherhood of Catholic Painters in Lviv. After training in his native country, he travelled through Italy and Germany to France in about 1598. Ada Palka has suggested that Ziarnko may have come into contact with artists involved in painting anamorphic scenes at this time.Ada Palka, \u2018Jan Ziarnko\u2019s Anamorphic Print A Pair of Lovers Embracing\u2019, in Print Quarterly XXXII, no. 2 (March, 2015), pp. 3\u201313. The Death of Ravaillac Ziarnko spent most of his adult years in Paris, between 1605 and 1629, where the vast majority of his known works were created. These comprise around thirty-five individual prints as well as three extensive print series. Around seventy-five prints made after drawings by Ziarnko also exist.J. Telibska, Grafika XVII wieku w Polsce, Funkcje, o\u015brodki, arty\u015bci, dzie\u0142a (Warsaw, 2011), p. 45. He designed bookplates and images for wall almanacs in addition to depicting aerial views and portraits, as well as historical and contemporary events. One of his more unusual works is a folding anamorphic etching of 1608. When folded into a cone, this reveals an image of two lovers embracing. This derives from Marcantonio Raimondi\u2019s Modi, a collection of erotic prints that illustrate various sexual positions. The Latin inscription and several vignettes which surround it are also taken from another source in the form of Matth\u00e4us Greuter\u2019s The Power of Venus of 1587. However, Ziarnko\u2019s use of a circular grid to create a deformation mesh which produces the anamorphic distortion appears to be highly novel. Ziarnko\u2019s expertise in perspective is attested to by his treatise of 1619, Perspectivae Stereo Pars Specialis (Three-dimensional Pictorial Perspective, Special Part). This outlines methods for constructing anamorphic images. As such, it played an important role in shaping later literature on the subject, such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Niceron\u2019s La Perspective Curieuse of 1638, which was voluminous in seventeenth-century France. Examples of Ziarnko\u2019s work can now be seen in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France in Paris, the British Museum in London, the Czartoryski Museum in Krak\u00f3w, and The National Library of Poland in Warsaw (digital version here). ==Notes== ==References== *\u0141odzi\u0144ski, W, Sprawozdanie komisyi do bada\u0144 historyi sztuki w Polsce [Report of a commission enquiring into the history of art in Poland], iv (1891), p. 59; v, p. 47\\. *Palka, A, \u2018Jan Ziarnko\u2019s Anamorphic Print A Pair of Lovers Embracing\u2019, in Print Quarterly XXXII, no. 2 (March, 2015), pp. 3\u201313. *Potocki, W, Katalog dzie\u0142 Jana Ziarnki, malarza, rytownika, polskiego z XVI i XVIIw, z \u017cyciorysem artysty [Catalogue of the works of Jan Ziarnko, a Polish painter and engraver from the 16th and 17th centuries, with a biography of the artist] (Krak\u00f3w, 1911). *Rastawiecki, E, S\u0142ownik malarz\u00f3w polskich tudzie\u017c obcych w Polsce osiad\u0142ych lub czasowo w niej przebywaj\u0105cych [A dictionary of Polish painters as well as foreign-born painters who settled or worked for a period in Poland], iii (Warsaw, 1857), pp. 79\u201384. *Rastawiecki, E, S\u0142ownik rytownik\u00f3w polskich tudzie\u017c obcych w Polsce osiad\u0142ych lub czasowo w niej przebywaj\u0105cych [A dictionary of Polish engravers as well as foreign-born engravers who settled or worked for a period in Poland] (Pozna\u0144, 1886), pp. 304\u20139. *Telibska, J, Grafika XVII wieku w Polsce, Funkcje, o\u015brodki, arty\u015bci, dzie\u0142a (Warsaw, 2011).
