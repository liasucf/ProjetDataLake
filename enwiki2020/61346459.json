It was situated on the little river Bathys, on the road from Dorylaeum to Pessinus, and in Roman times belonged to the conventus of Synnada. In the Synecdemus it appears as Medaium or Medaion (\u039c\u03b5\u03b4\u03ac\u03ca\u03bf\u03bd). The town, as its name indicates, must have been built by one of the ancient kings of Phrygia, and has become celebrated in history from the fact that Sextus Pompeius, the son of Pompey the Great, was there taken prisoner by the generals of Marcus Antonius, and afterwards put to death. It has been supposed, with some probability, that the town of Mygdum, mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus, is the same as Midaeium. It was the see of a bishop in antiquity; no longer a residential bishopric, under the name Mida\u00ebum it remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.Catholic Hierarchy Its site is located near Karah\u00fcy\u00fck, Eski\u015fehir, Asiatic Turkey. ==References== Category:Populated places in Phrygia Category:Populated places of the Byzantine Empire Category:Roman towns and cities in Turkey Category:Catholic titular sees in Asia Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:History of Eski\u015fehir Province Category:Han District ",
