    "text": "In January 2014, Nauru's President Baron Waqa fired the country's only magistrate Peter Law, and cancelled the visa of its Chief Justice Geoffrey Eames (both Australian-based justices). Law was fired after issuing an injunction to temporarily halt the deportation of three foreign nationals. Eames issued an injunction in an unsuccessful attempt to temporarily halt Law's deportation. Eames was in Australia at the time and his visa was cancelled, preventing his return to Nauru. In the same month, the application fee for visas for foreign journalists was raised from $200 to $8000. In May and June 2014, Waqa suspended 5 of the 7 members of Nauru's Opposition from Parliament indefinitely. Three of the MPs, Mathew Batsiua, Kieren Keke and Roland Kun, were suspended in May 2014 for making comments to international media critical of the government and the alleged breakdown of the rule of law. Another two, Sprent Dabwido (a former president) and Squire Jeremiah were suspended a month later for behaving in an unruly manner. In June 2015, Jeremiah, Dabwido, and Batsiua were arrested and Kun had his passport cancelled amid claims that they had been trying to destabilise the Government by talking to foreign media. 19 people were charged with unlawful assembly and other offences following a protest outside the Parliament of Nauru on 16 June 2015. 3 pleaded guilty and the District Court sentenced 2 to imprisonment for 3 months and the 3rd to 6 months imprisonment. The Supreme Court of Nauru allowed an appeal, finding that the sentences were manifestly inadequate and increased them to 14 months and 22 months imprisonment. The High Court of Australia quashed the decision and remitted it to the Supreme Court \"differently constituted, for hearing according to law.\" The charges against Jeremiah, Dabwido, and Batsiua had a long and complex history. On 21 June 2018 Justice Geoff Muecke in the Supreme Court of Nauru ordered Nauru to pay their costs of defending the charges, in the amount of $224,021.90. Nauru did not pay this amount and on 13 September 2018 Justice Muecke ordered a permanent stay of the proceedings against them., unreported 13 September 2018, Supreme Court of Nauru. The Nauru government is appealing this decision to the Nauru Court of Appeal and will be heard by Michael Scott, the former Chief Justice of Tonga, John Muria, the Chief Justice of Kiribati and Nicholas Kirriwom, a judge of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea. ==References== ==External links== *Nauru government denies suspending MPs for 'damaging comments' amounts to censorship Sydney Morning Herald, May 15, 2014 *Court delay keeps Nauru opposition MPs Squire Jeremiah and Sprent Dabwido in custody until Tuesday Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 21 June 2015 * Nauru MPs Arrested In Crackdown On Dissent Pacific Islands Report, 22 June 2015 *Nauru Opposition MPs suspended, others arrested for 'trashing' state 22 June 2015 * Government and Police in Nauru escalate attacks on Opposition MPs Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 24 June 2015 *New Zealand Government seeks reassurances from Nauru after protests Radio NZ, 26 June 2015 *Odds stacked against Nauru MPs, says former Chief Justice Radio NZ, 26 June 2015 *Former top judge says NZ response to Nauru weak Radio NZ, 27 June 2015 *McCully quizzed on Nauru Otago Daily Times, 27 June 2015 *Abbott government under pressure to cut Nauru aid after New Zealand crackdown Sydney Morning Herald, 4 September 2015 Category:Politics of Nauru Category:2014 in Nauru Category:2015 in Nauru ",
