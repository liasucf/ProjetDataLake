He left behind his sonatas for cello and piano (1915), flute, viola and harp (1915), and violin and piano (1916\u20131917). == History == From 1914, the composer, encouraged by the music publisher Jacques Durand, intended to write a set of six sonatas for various instruments, in homage to the French composers of the 18th century. The First World War, along with the composers Couperin and Rameau, inspired Debussy as he was writing the sonatas. Durand, in his memoirs entitled Quelques souvenirs d'un \u00e9diteur de musique, wrote the following about the sonatas' origin: > After his famous String Quartet, Debussy had not written any more chamber > music. Then, at the Concerts Durand, he heard again the Septet with trumpet > by Saint-Sa\u00ebns and his sympathy for this means of musical expression was > reawoken. He admitted the fact to me and I warmly encouraged him to follow > his inclination. And that is how the idea of the six sonatas for various > instruments came about.Roger Nichols (ed.), Debussy Remembered (Faber and > Faber, 1992), p. 242. In a letter to the conductor Bernard Molinari, Debussy explained that the set should include \"different combinations, with the last sonata combining the previously used instruments\". His death on 25 March 1918 prevented him from carrying out his plan, and only three of the six sonatas were completed and published by Durand, with a dedication to his second wife, Emma Bardac. ==Sonatas== ===Sonata for cello and piano=== The sonata for cello and piano, L. 135, was written in 1915, and is notable for its brevity, most performances not exceeding 11 minutes. It is a staple of the modern cello repertoire and is commonly regarded as one of the finest masterpieces written for the instrument. The work has three movements: *I. Prologue: Lent, sostenuto e molto risoluto *II. S\u00e9r\u00e9nade: Mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment anim\u00e9 *III. Finale: Anim\u00e9, l\u00e9ger et nerveux The two final movements are joined by an attacca. Instead of sonata form, Debussy structures the piece in the style of the eighteenth-century monothematic sonata, and was particularly influenced by the music of Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. The piece makes use of modes and whole-tone and pentatonic scales, as is typical of Debussy's style. It also utilises many types of extended cello technique, including left-hand pizzicato, spiccato and flautando bowing, false harmonics and portamenti. The piece is considered technically demanding. Whether descriptive comments related to characters of the Commedia dell'arte were actually given by Debussy to cellist Louis Rosoor remains unclear.Moray Welsh. \u00ab Behind the Moon-eyed Mask \u00bb.

The first performance of the Sonata took place in Boston, at Jordan Hall in the New England Conservatory, on November 7, 1916. The performers were members of a wind ensemble called the Longy Club, which had been founded by the principal oboist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, George Longy. The first performance in France was a private one that occurred on December 10, 1916, at the home of Debussy's publisher, Jacques Durand.Nichols, Roger: The Life of Debussy (2001) p 158 The first public performance in France was thought to be at a charity concert on March 9, 1917. However, Thompson (1968) reported a performance of the sonata at London's Aeolian Hall by Albert Fransella, Harry Waldo Warner and Miriam Timothy on 2 February 1917 as part of a concert otherwise given by the London String Quartet. A typical performance lasts between 17 and 18 minutes. According to L\u00e9on Vallas (1929),Cited in Debussy initially planned this as a piece for flute, oboe and harp. He subsequently decided that the viola's timbre would be a better combination for the flute than the oboe's, so he changed the instrumentation to flute, viola and harp. The instrumentation would later become a standard ensemble instrumentation. The work has three movements: *I. Pastorale: Lento, dolce rubato *II. Interlude: Tempo di Minuetto *III. Finale: Allegro moderato ma risoluto ===Sonata for violin and piano=== The sonata for violin and piano in G minor, L. 140, was written in 1917. It was the composer's last major composition and is notable for its brevity; a typical performance lasts about 13 minutes. The premiere took place on 5 May 1917, the violin part played by Gaston Poulet, with Debussy himself at the piano. It was his last public performance.Sleeve note of the Supraphon CD (SU 3547-2 101) The work has three movements: # Allegro vivo # Interm\u00e8de: Fantasque et l\u00e9ger # Finale: Tr\u00e8s anim\u00e9 ===The unfinished sonatas=== Debussy wrote in the manuscript of his violin sonata that the fourth sonata should be written for oboe, horn, and harpsichord,L\u00e9on Vallas Claude Debussy et son temps. \u00e9d. Albin Michel, 1958 \u2013 441 pages. page 412. and the fifth for trumpet, clarinet, bassoon and piano.Henry Pruni\u00e8res La Revue musicale, Num\u00e9ros 258 \u00e0 259. \u00c9ditions Richard-Masse, 1964. page 140. For the final and sixth sonata, Debussy envisioned a concerto where the sonorities of the \"various instruments\" combine, with the gracious assistance of the double bass,Christian Goubault Claude Debussy : la musique \u00e0 vif. \u00e9d. Minerve, 2006. 236 pages . page 44. making the instrumentation: :Flute :Oboe :Clarinet :Bassoon :Horn :Trumpet :Harp :Piano :Harpsichord :Violin :Viola :Cello :Double bass The idea of combining the instruments oboe, horn, and harpsichord, inspired Thomas Ad\u00e8s to write his Sonata da Caccia, and the combination of the instruments trumpet, clarinet, bassoon and piano, inspired Marc-Andr\u00e9 Dalbavie to write his Axiom. The Australian composer Lyle Chan has written three sonatas for the same combinations of instruments as in the three unfinished Debussy sonatas.Australian National Academy of Music, \"Music Makers\", Vol. 26, May 2018, p. 3 == Bibliography == * ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * *Thompson, K.L.
