The flag stop both predated and outlived its namesake west of Chilliwack on the BCER. ==History== ===Railway=== Kidd, like Bend to its northwest, and Urling to its southeast, was an original train station (1914) on the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway1914 Timetable scanned (the Canadian National Railway after nationalization). Kidd lies at Mile 51.9, Fraser Subdivision (about Mile 141 during the line's construction). By August 1913, the railway track had been laid from Mile 53 (T\u00eate Jaune) to Mile 138, and then Mile 142.Fort George Tribune: 2 & 9 Aug 1913 Dome Creek has historically described both a specific place and the general area several miles on either side, such as Mile 141,Fort George Herald, 30 Aug 1913 or Mile 142.Fort George Herald: 17 & 31 May 1913 The area may have comprised 2,000 workers housed in construction camps stretching from Mile 141 to 146. The Railway Commission having handed over control to operate this section, the first GTP passenger arrived at Mile 141 that month. O.E. Hood & Co., which ran stores at the Mile 53 (T\u00eate Jaune), Mile 79 and Mile 142 camps, was erecting a modern building in Fort George.Fort George Herald, 31 May 1913 In 1962, a five-car derailment occurred at Mile 49.Prince George Citizen, 8 Jan 1962 Months later, a mechanical defect derailed 19 cars near the middle of a 120-car freight train between Kidd and Urling. The westbound passenger train was delayed about six hours.Prince George Citizen, 25 Sep 1962 Built in 1914, the standard-design Plan 100\u2010152 (Bohi\u2019s Type E) station building was demolished in 1953, and replaced by a GTP era freight shed conversion, which was in turn removed before the 2000s. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Mel McKenzie, the manager, badly fractured an ankle when his speeder jumped the track.Prince George Citizen: 9 Apr 1951 & 19 Jul 1951 Wilf Leboe (1919\u20132010)Prince George Citizen, 2 Nov 2010 operated Leboe Lumber a mile to the east by the river, which he sold to Jim Chambers (1924\u2013?) from Penny, but it closed by the late 1950s. During the 1970s, Glen Hooker from Bend ran a portable mill on his property at Kidd. ===Community=== White and Stewart may have operated a restaurant in the latter 1910s, but this could be a confusion with the one run by James Stewart at Dome Creek, likely around Mile 54. The school at Mile 48 operated from the late 1920s to at least the mid-1930s. to Teachers included Marjorie Giles, P. Haslam (probably Pearl), Elsie Eccles,Prince George Citizen, 16 Apr 1931 and Nancy Sanders.Prince George Citizen, 27 Apr 1933 The population was 29 in 1929. The following were pioneer farmers.

In an environment with limited eligible females, Martin Dayton's attempts to find a bridePrince George Herald, 27 Nov 1915 appear unsuccessful.

Jensen (1888\u20131952),Prince George Citizen, 14 Feb 1952 arrived during the 1910s, he appears to have lived closer to Dome Creek from the late 1920s. Ernest H. Jensen (1890\u20131966),Prince George Citizen, 3 Jan 1966 the first brother to arrive in the area, was a hunter, who sold the meat to the railway construction camps.

Emmet Baxter (Shorty) Haynes (?\u20131953) guided the initial police search to the subject's cabin, which was in an area upstream from Dome Creek (probably closer to Urling) on the Fraser. Comments Goodson had previously made to James Stewart at Dome Creek, and notes in his cabin, indicated that Haynes had threatened his life. Further searches revealed no traces of a body and it remains a cold case.Prince George Citizen: 11 Mar 1926 & 13 May 1926 Five years later, when Haynes was two weeks overdue in checking in at the Dome Creek post-office, concerns arose as to the popular trapper's wellbeing.Prince George Citizen, 14 May 1931 By 1914, Haynes, was described as a well-known old-timer, who was over six-foot tall. Research by novelist Jack Boudreau of Penny indicated that Goodson was suspected of stealing from others' traplines. Apparently, Haynes and Goodson had been feuding for years.
