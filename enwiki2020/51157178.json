After his death in 1996, the remaining volumes were produced by his company, Fujiko F. Fujio Pro. The last six volumes have the company's name on their covers instead of his name. The series was adapted to a line of Doraemon films and various remakes, released in Japan cinemas between 1980 and 2004, and back into a separate manga series with screenshots taken from the films. The first 17 were released digitally on Amazon Kindle in color, translated in English for the North American market, on December 27, 2017. ==History== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:smaller\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | VOL!! rowspan=\"2\" | No!! rowspan=\"2\" | Title!! colspan=\"2\" | Release Time!! colspan=\"2\" | Times!! rowspan=\"2\" | Note |- !
