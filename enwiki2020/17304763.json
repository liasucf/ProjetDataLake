    "text": "Self-portrait Thomas Schweicker (December 21, 1540 - October 7, 1602) was a German artist and calligrapher. He was noted for being a painter even though he had no arms or hands. == Life == Schweicker was born in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall, to Hans and Dorothea Schweicker. His father was a baker and a councilor, and later a judge. Schweicker was the 6th of 8 children, and had four brothers and three sisters. He was born without arms, presumably due to amniotic band syndrome. Nevertheless, he learned not only to master every day tasks like washing and dressing himself, but also to write, by using his feet. By age seven, he began his schooling, and by age twelve, he was enrolled in the Schw\u00e4bisch Hall Latin school. ==Calligraphy and Celebrity Status== Schweicker had a talent for calligraphy, and soon became adept at creating elaborate documents. This, combined with his \u2018unusual\u2019 technique soon made him a celebrity. Many visitors came to Schw\u00e4bisch Hall to see him, watch him work, and buy a piece of his art. In 1570, he met both Kaiser Maximilian II and Prince-elector August of Saxony, and impressed them with his work. In 1584 he was invited to come to Heidelberg, to perform at court for audiences. Schweicker stayed there until 1598, working mainly as a painter. == Death == Schweicker died in the early morning hours of October 7, 1602 following a short illness.
