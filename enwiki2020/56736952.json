With lane violations being disqualified aggressively already at these championships, Brazier knew his fate and jogged the rest of his race. Led by \u00c1lvaro de Arriba, heat 1 turned out to be significantly faster than the final. The final started with Mostafa Smaili taking the advantage at the break, edging out Sa\u00fal Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez took up a position on Smaili's shoulder, the rest of the field lined up behind them until two laps to go. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez moved out to the lead, and 2014 silver medalist Adam Kszczot moved from the back to quickly to take up the second position with Drew Windle covering the move. For the next lap, Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez kept looking over his shoulder while keeping Kszczot at bay. At the bell, Kszczot cruised into the lead, the rest of the field, led by Elliot Giles swarmed forward, leaving Windle out the back. Through the final lap, Kszczot just extended his lead to take a four-metre victory. Behind him, Windle squeezed past \u00c1lvaro de Arriba and Smaili on the inside, then slid to the outside on the home straightaway to pass Giles and with a lean at the line, Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez to take silver. Following the race, Windle was disqualified for obstruction. The decision was later reversed on appeal, reinstating his silver medal.https://www.flotrack.org/articles/6129445-drew-windles-800m-silver- reinstated-after-dq-drama-at-iaaf-world-indoors ==Results== ===Heats=== The heats were started on 2 March at 19:13.Heats results {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !!
