    "text": "\"The Bard's Song (In the Forest)\" is a single by the German power metal band Blind Guardian, released in 2003. It contains five different versions of this track, one of their most popular songs, which originally appeared on the album Somewhere Far Beyond. The song is a folk rock ballad, in contrast to the band's usual power metal sound. The single's cover art was painted by Leo Hao. At concerts, it is not unusual for Hansi K\u00fcrsch to only sing the first and third lines of the song, then possibly the final verse or chorus, and leave the audience to sing the rest. The song has been covered by German a cappella metal band van Canto on their album Hero. == Track listing == # \"The Bard's Song (In the Forest)\" (New Studio Version) \u2013 3:30 # \"The Bard's Song (In the Forest)\" (Live, Milano, October 10, 2002) \u2013 4:32 # \"The Bard's Song (In the Forest)\" (Live, Munich, May 5, 2002) \u2013 4:29 # \"The Bard's Song (In the Forest)\" (Live, Madrid, June 4, 2002) \u2013 4:30 # \"The Bard's Song (In the Forest)\" (multimedia track: Live, Stuttgart, May 6, 2002) \u2013 4:18 ==Charts== #40 Germany #31 Italy == Personnel == * Hansi K\u00fcrsch \u2013 vocals and strings arrangement * Andr\u00e9 Olbrich \u2013 acoustic lead guitar and backing vocals * Marcus Siepen \u2013 acoustic rhythm guitar and backing vocals == References == Category:1992 songs Category:2003 singles Category:Blind Guardian songs Category:Virgin Records singles Category:Songs written by Hansi K\u00fcrsch Category:Songs written by Andr\u00e9 Olbrich ",
