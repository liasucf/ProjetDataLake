    "text": "William Henson (1 August 1826 - 19 March 1903) was an Australian politician. He was born in Sydney to soldier William Henson and Caroline Blades. His father had been sent to New South Wales on detachment and remained, setting up business in George Street but dying while his children were still young. The younger William was educated at St Phillips School at Church Hill and then managed a sheep station. He spent time on the goldfields at Ophir and Bendigo, meeting with enough success to settle comfortably at Ashfield. In 1880 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Canterbury. He was defeated in 1882, but returned in 1885 and was re-elected in 1887. He did not contest the 1889 election, although he did run again, unsuccessfully, in 1891. Henson died at Ashfield in 1903. ==References== Category:1826 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Free Trade Party politicians Category:19th-century Australian politicians ",
