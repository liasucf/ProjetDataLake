    "text": "Rory Michael Fallon (born 20 March 1982) is a New Zealand former professional footballer who played predominantly as a forward. He previously played for Barnsley, Shrewsbury Town, Swindon Town, Swansea City, Plymouth Argyle, Ipswich Town, Yeovil Town, Aberdeen, St Johnstone, Bristol Rovers, Scunthorpe United, Dorchester Town. He was also capped by New Zealand a total of 24 times, scoring 6 goals. He represented his country at both the 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Nations Cup. He was born and raised in Gisborne. His father Kevin managed New Zealand over a four-year period in the 1980s. He retired from professional football in November 2017. ==Playing career== ===Club career=== Born in Gisborne, Fallon started his career at Barnsley, becoming a professional in 1999 after moving up through their trainee programme. He had just begun to cement his place in the first-team when he suffered a stress fracture of his foot, which saw him struggle to regain his place. Fallon was signed for an undisclosed fee by Swindon Town in November 2003 after a number of impressive performances against them with Barnsley, which caught the eye of manager Andy King. After breaking into the team he scored a number of important goals in the 2003\u201304 campaign; including an overhead kick from the edge of the box to secure a point against Bristol City. Despite the departure of Tommy Mooney, Fallon found himself regularly on the bench in the 2004\u201305 season. He was loaned out to Yeovil Town to increase his confidence and he scored on his debut against Scunthorpe United. He failed to score in the remainder of the season, but a red card for kicking Huddersfield Town defender David Mirfin in the face meant he missed the opening two games of the following season. After Sam Parkin was sold in summer 2005, Fallon was given greater opportunities to play at Swindon, scoring on his return to action against Nottingham Forest. He signed for League One team Swansea City in January 2006 for a fee believed to be \u00a3300,000, the second highest fee ever paid by the Welsh club. A productive year followed for the striker, scoring 13 goals in all competitions from 48 appearances. This prompted interest from Championship side Plymouth Argyle and they paid \u00a3300,000 for Fallon on 19 January 2007. Fallon had only started a handful of games for Plymouth Argyle, and had struggled to get into the team. He went without a competitive goal at Home Park until 19 January 2008, exactly one-year after he signed for the club, when he scored a second half equaliser against Southampton. It was only his fourth goal for the Pilgrims. The 2007\u20132008 campaign saw Fallon continue to be a regular bench warmer, but he continued with his optimistic attitude that he can become a first team regular, and even rejected a \u00a3250,000 move to League One side Southend United, in January 2008. On 29 September 2009, Fallon scored the winning goal for Plymouth against Peterborough United earning the Pilgrims their first win of the season after seven straight defeats, lifting them off the bottom of the table. Fallon then scored the opening goal in Argyle's next game against Scunthorpe United which they also won 2\u20131. On the opening day of the 2010\u201311 season, Fallon played the full 90 minutes and was the provider for Luke Summerfield's winning goal in Plymouth's 1\u20130 win over pre-season promotion favourites Southampton. In November, he joined Ipswich Town on short loan, returning to Plymouth in January. In August 2011, Fallon signed a one-month contract with Yeovil Town after a short trial and featured in all five of Yeovil's games during that period. In September 2011, he signed a two-year deal with Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen. Fallon's time at Aberdeen was notable for his performances in the 2011\u201312 Scottish Cup. After scoring in Aberdeen's 4\u20130, 4th round victory over Forfar Athletic, he set up Aberdeen's opener in the 5th round 2\u20131 win over Queen of the South. Fallon then scored both goals in the 2\u20131 quarter final win against Motherwell to become the Player of the Round. Although Aberdeen lost the semi-final at Hampden Park 2\u20131 against Hibernian, Fallon's second half equaliser went on to be voted the PFA Goal of the Season. On 13 May 2013 Fallon was released by Aberdeen having scored three league goals in 35 appearances. Fallon joined Scottish Premier League side St Johnstone in July 2013 on a free transfer, the deal was completed in time for Fallon to play a part, if called upon, in St Johnstone's UEFA Europa League second qualifying round tie against Norwegian Tippeligaen side Rosenborg.http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2014/matches/round=2000466/match=2012289/prematch/player- lists/index.html On 31 January 2014, Fallon left St Johnstone by mutual consent. In February 2014, Fallon joined Crawley Town until the end of the 2013\u201314 season. In September 2014, Fallon joined Scunthorpe United on a short- term deal. Fallon scored on his Scunthorpe d\u00e9but in a 3\u20132 loss to Oldham Athletic on 27 September 2014. In January 2016, Fallon joined Bristol Rovers on non-contract terms until the end of the season. He made his debut as a 76th-minute substitute, in a 1\u20130 loss to Accrington Stanley F.C.. In the summer of 2016, he Joined National League South club, Truro City F.C. as a player-coach but had his contract cancelled by mutual consent in December 2016. On 26 July 2017, Fallon joined National League side Torquay United, on non-contract terms, ahead of the 2017\u201318 season. He played one match for Dorchester Town. ===International career=== Despite being born in New Zealand and having a father who coached New Zealand at the 1982 World Cup, Fallon chose to represent England at junior level. He played international football for England at U16, U17, U18, U19 and U20 levels and switched when FIFA changed the eligibility rules. He did, however, represent New Zealand in an unofficial U-16 World Cup in France in 1998 where Wynton Rufer was the coach. Shortly after, he departed for England to be an apprentice at Barnsley. In January 2006, New Zealand coach Ricki Herbert suggested that Fallon might still get a chance to represent New Zealand at senior level. Herbert claimed that the only reason why Fallon wasn't picked was due to lack of correspondence from FIFA regarding this matter. Fallon had until he was 21 years old to get clearance from FIFA to change nationalities. It found, however, that Fallon did not apply in the 2004 window to change allegiance for over-21s players. This year-long window was made available by FIFA upon introduction of a rule which allows players with dual nationality to switch their allegiance before their 21st birthday. Under this criterion Fallon could not be available for New Zealand. On 3 June 2009, FIFA Congress passed a motion removing the age limit for changing associations for players who had already played for a country's national team at youth level under article 18 of the Regulations Governing the Application of the FIFA Statutes. This allowed for the possibility of Fallon again representing New Zealand. In August 2009, Fallon was called up to the New Zealand squad for a friendly against Jordan the following month and the crucial two-legged World Cup play- off matches against Bahrain later in the year. Fallon scored on debut in the match against Jordan, which New Zealand won 3\u20131. On 14 November 2009, Fallon scored the only goal in the second leg of New Zealand's World Cup qualifier against Bahrain, to send New Zealand to the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, their first appearance at the finals in 28 years. Fallon played in all three of New Zealand's finals games. He recalled into the New Zealand camp for their World Cup play-off loss to Peru. On November 2017, following the matches, he announced his international retirement. ==Coaching career== After retiring, Fallon worked with Plymouth Argyle's under-14 players.Former Argyle striker Rory Fallon joins New Zealand's coaching staff for international double- header, plymouthherald.co.uk, 14 November 2019 In mid-October 2019, Fallon was appointed assistant manager for the New Zealand national football team under manager Danny Hay.New All Whites coach Danny Hay calls on Rory Fallon to be one of his assistants, stuff.co.nz, 21 October 2019 ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Reference accessdate=29 November 2017 accessdate=1 December 2017 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Barnsley |1999\u20132000||rowspan=\"3\"|First Division |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2000\u201301 |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2001\u201302 |9||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||10||0 |- |2002\u201303||rowspan=\"2\"|Second Division |26||7||1||0||1||0||1||0||29||7 |- |2003\u201304 |16||4||0||0||1||0||1||0||18||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !52!!11!!1!!0!!3!!0!!2!!0!!58!!11 |- |Shrewsbury Town (loan) |2001\u201302||Third Division |11||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||11||0 |- |rowspan=4|Swindon Town |2003\u201304||Second Division |19||6||0||0||0||0||2||1||21||7 |- |2004\u201305||rowspan=\"2\"|League One |31||3||3||0||2||0||3||1||39||4 |- |2005\u201306 |25||12||1||1||1||0||2||1||29||14 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !77!!22!!4!!1!!3!!0!!7!!3!!91!!26 |- |Yeovil Town (loan) |2004\u201305||League Two |6||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Swansea City |2005\u201306||rowspan=\"2\"|League One |17||4||0||0||0||0||3||1||20||5 |- |2006\u201307 |24||8||3||0||1||0||0||0||28||8 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !41!!12!!3!!0!!1!!0!!3!!1!!48!!13 |- |rowspan=6|Plymouth Argyle |2006\u201307||rowspan=\"4\"|Championship |15||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||15||1 |- |2007\u201308 |29||7||1||0||2||0||0||0||32||7 |- |2008\u201309 |44||5||1||0||1||0||0||0||47||5 |- |2009\u201310 |33||5||2||0||1||0||0||0||36||5 |- |2010\u201311||League One |28||4||1||0||1||0||1||0||31||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !149!!22!!5!!0!!5!!0!!1!!0!!160!!22 |- |Ipswich Town (loan) |2010\u201311||Championship |6||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||1 |- |Yeovil Town |2011\u201312||League One |5||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||6||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Aberdeen |2011\u201312||rowspan=\"2\"|Scottish Premier League |21||2||5||4||1||1||0||0||27||7 |- |2012\u201313 |14||1||2||1||0||0||0||0||16||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !35!!3!!7!!5!!1!!1!!0!!0!!43!!9 |- |St Johnstone |2013\u201314||Scottish Premiership |8||1||1||0||1||0||2||0||12||1 |- |Crawley Town |2013\u201314||League One |8||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||8||0 |- |Scunthorpe United |2014\u201315||League One |4||3||0||0||0||0||1||0||5||3 |- |Bristol Rovers |2015\u201316||League Two |3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0 |- |Truro City |2016\u201317||National League South |12||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||14||0 |- |Torquay United |2017\u201318||National League |5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0 |- |Dorchester Town |2017\u201318||Southern League Premier Division |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !423!!76!!21!!6!!15!!1!!19!!4!!478!!87 |} ===International goals=== :New Zealand score listed first, score column indicates score after each Fallon goal. {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+ International goals by date, venue, cap, opponent, score, result and competition |- !scope=col|No. !scope=col data-sort-type=date|Date !scope=col|Venue !scope=col|Cap !scope=col|Opponent !scope=col|Score !scope=col|Result !scope=col|Competition |- !scope=row|1 |9 September 2009||King Abdullah II Stadium, Amman, Jordan||1||||2\u20131||3\u20131||Friendly |- !scope=row|2 |14 November 2009||Wellington Regional Stadium, Wellington, New Zealand||3||||1\u20130||1\u20130||2010 FIFA World Cup qualification |- !scope=row|3 |4 June 2010||Ljudski vrt, Maribor, Slovenia||7||||1\u20131||1\u20133||Friendly |- !scope=row|4 |19 November 2013||Wellington Regional Stadium, Wellington, New Zealand||17||||2\u20133||2\u20134||2014 FIFA World Cup qualification |- !scope=row|5 |28 May 2016||Sir John Guise Stadium, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea||19||||2\u20130||3\u20131||2018 FIFA World Cup qualification |- !scope=row|6 |31 May 2016||Sir John Guise Stadium, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea||20||||4\u20130||5\u20130||2016 OFC Nations Cup |} ==Personal life== Fallon's mother, Mere, is of M\u0101ori descent.
