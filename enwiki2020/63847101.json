    "text": "Sacred Defense cinema () refers to a genre of Iranian films that deals with various aspects of the Iran-Iraq war of 1980\u20131988. Although little noticed in the West, the genre has produced more than 200 movies. The first examples of Sacred Defence cinema were released while the war was still going on. Since then the genre has gone from strength to strength, producing both critical and commercial hits. Some of Iran's most noted directors have engaged with the genre, among them Ebrahim Hatamikia, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Majid Majidi and Kamal Tabrizi. Hatamikia is one of the most prolific and successful proponents of the genre. In 2007, Iranian war cinema retrospectives were curated by Pedram Khosronejad and held in New York and at the Barbican Centre in London. The first comprehensive academic study in the West was published in 2012: Iranian Sacred Defence Cinema: Religion, Martyrdom and National Identity by Pedram Khosronejad. == Notable directors == * Morteza Avini * Ebrahim Hatamikia * Mohammad Bozorgnia * Rasoul Mollagholipour * Shahriar Bahrani * Ahmad Reza Darvish * Mohsen Makhmalbaf * Abolqasem Talebi ==Notable films== *A Boat Towards the Shore, 1984 *A Military Base in Hell, 1982 *Abadanians, 1993 *Bashu, the Little Stranger, 1990 *Bravados, 1981 *Crossing, 1988 *Deliverance, 1983 *Fence, 1983 *From the Karkhe to the Rhine, 1993 *Horizon, 1988 *Identity, 1986 *Journey to Chazabeh, 1996 *Lover's Place, 1983 *Man and Weapon, 1988 *Mohajer, 1990 *Passage, 1986 *Snake Fang, 1989 *The 5th Kilometer, 1980 *The Eagles, 1984 *The First Bell (Fatemi) *The Glass Eye, 1991 *The Little Soldier (Bakhshaian) *The Scout, 1988 *The Sergeant, 1991 *The Stranded Bearer, 1985 *Two Semi Blind Eyes (Makhmalbaf) *Union of the Good, 1992 *We Are Standing (Hor) == References == == Sources== * == Further reading == * * * * Category:Cinema of Iran ",
