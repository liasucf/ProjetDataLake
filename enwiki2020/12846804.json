    "text": "Another Time, Another Place was Bryan Ferry's second studio album as a solo artist. The album reached #4 in the UK charts in 1974. Recording took place in London at Island, Ramport and AIR studios. Like These Foolish Things, Another Time, Another Place is essentially a cover album, with the exception of the last song, which gave its title to the album and was written by Ferry. It featured a Bob Dylan song (\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" on the former LP, \"It Ain't Me Babe\" on the latter) and a standard (the title track of These Foolish Things, \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" on Another Time, Another Place) but while These Foolish Things emphasized an early-'60s girl-group repertoire, Another Time, Another Place turned to soul music (Sam Cooke, Ike & Tina Turner) and country music (Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Joe South). ==Critical reception== Reviewing for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett wrote of the album \"The album as a whole feels a touch more formal than its predecessor, but Ferry and company, plus various brass and string sections, turn on the showiness enough to make it all fun. A harbringer of solo albums to come appears at end -- the title track, a Ferry original.\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/another-time- another-place-mw0000650140 And the critic Robert Christgau wrote of the album \"Comedy routines are rarely as funny the second time around, especially when you've used up your best lines--\"The `In' Crowd\" is the only zinger Ferry comes up with here.\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Bryan+Ferry ==Track listing== Side 1 Side 2 ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1974) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Australian (Kent Music Report)||21 |} ==Personnel== Soloists: *Bryan Ferrylead vocal, harmonica and organ *David O'Listguitar *John Porterguitar *John Wettonbass guitar, fiddle *Henry Lowthertrumpet *Chris Mercertenor saxophone *Ruan O'Lochlainnalto saxophone *Chris Pynetrombone *Paul Thompsondrums Also featuring: (instruments are mentioned tentatively based on the credits of other Bryan Ferry records) *Vicki Brown, Helen Chappelle, Barry St. John, Liza Strike backing vocals *Strings arranged by Ann Odell *Brass arranged by Martyn Ford *Engineer: John Punter *Assistant engineers: Rhett Davies, Mark Dodson, Gary Edwards, Sean Milligan *Cover concept: Bryan Ferry *Photography: Eric Boman *Design: Nicholas de Ville *Artwork: Bob Bowkett (C.C.S.) *Fashion: Antony Price ==References== ==External links== *RoxyRama.com entry *British certification Category:1974 albums Category:Bryan Ferry albums Category:Albums produced by John Punter Category:Covers albums Category:Island Records albums ",
