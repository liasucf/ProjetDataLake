    "text": "Jan \u0160\u0165astn\u00fd (c.1764 \u2013 c.1830) (also Stiasny, Stiastny) was a Czech composer and cellist from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century. He is considered one of the founders of Czech national violoncello school. Information on \u0160\u0165astn\u00fd's life is rather sketchy. He was born around 1764 in Prague, was taught music by his father, and played in a Prague theatre orchestra by 16 years. In 1810, \u0160\u0165astn\u00fd was court cellist in Frankfurt (c. 1810\u20131814). He then worked in Mannheim, and was music director in Nuremberg around 1820. Apparently at some point he lived and worked in England, where in London he met Czech singer and composer Josef Theodor Krov, who called \u0160\u0165astn\u00fd, the \"Beethoven of the violoncello\". Traces of \u0160\u0165astn\u00fd disappear after 1826. \u0160\u0165astn\u00fd's cello and basso continuo composition is regarded, in the opinion of violinist, conductor, and cello music historian Wilhelm Joseph von Wasielewski, as one of the best examples of antique cello compositions. He composed cello pieces (11 opus numbers), duets, variations, sonatas, divertimento, instructive pieces, concertino, Grand Trio. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1764 births Category:1830 deaths Category:Czech classical cellists Category:Czech classical composers Category:Czech male classical composers Category:Musicians from Prague Category:Place of death unknown ",
