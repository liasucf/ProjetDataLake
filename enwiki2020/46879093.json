She became the leading exponent of the genre during the 1930s, being nicknamed La Emperatriz del Danzonete (The Empress of the Danzonete). Her greatest hit was the song \"Rompiendo la rutina\", the first danzonete, composed by Aniceto D\u00edaz in 1929. In 1960 she recorded her only LP record. ==Life and career== ===Early life and career=== Paulina \u00c1lvarez was born Raimunda Paula Pe\u00f1a \u00c1lvarez on June 29, 1912 in Cienfuegos, Cuba. By the time she was eight or nine years old she was singing at parties and school functions. In 1926, at age 14, her family moved to Havana, where she started her professional singing career in societies, theatres and radio shows. She sang boleros and canciones, but quickly became specialized in a new style of sung danz\u00f3n influenced by the son cubano called danzonete. In 1931 she became the singer for Orquesta Elegante, directed by Edelmiro P\u00e9rez and featuring pianist Obdulio Morales. ===Rise to fame=== Paulina \u00c1lvarez with Orquesta Elegante in 1931. Shortly after joining La Elegante, she rose to fame with \"Rompiendo la rutina\", the very first danzonete, which had been composed by Aniceto D\u00edaz in 1929. Such hit earned her the title \"La Emperatriz del Danzonete\" (The Empress of the Danzonete), given to her by presenter Ruiz del Vizo. Other early hits were the boleros \"L\u00e1grimas negras\" (Miguel Matamoros) and \"Mujer divina\" (Agust\u00edn Lara). Nonetheless, it was not easy for her to achieve success due to the sexist bias of band directors at the time. She then sang with the orchestras of Luis del Castillo (Castillito), Ernesto Mu\u00f1oz, Cheo Bel\u00e9n Puig, Hermanos Mart\u00ednez and Neno Gonz\u00e1lez. In 1938 she established her own band including director/flautist Manolo Morales, pianist Everardo Ordaz, double bassist Rodolfo O'Farrill and g\u00fciro player Gustavo Tamayo. With this band she recorded several singles for Victor in 1939 and 1940, including not only danzones but also guarachas and rumbas. ===Later years=== By the 1940s, the popularity of son conjuntos and the decline of danz\u00f3n orchestras forced \u00c1lvarez to go on hiatus. She took this time to study solf\u00e8ge and music theory, and took up the guitar and the piano at the Academia Municipal de La Habana (current Amadeo Rold\u00e1n Conservatory). She also improved her vocal technique, wanting to become a better singer. After her studies, she founded a new orchestra with his husband, violinist Luis Armando Ortega, and in 1943 they got a programme at the CMQ radio station. The new band featured flautist Jos\u00e9 Fajardo and pianist Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez. After another brief hiatus in the late 1940s and early 1950s, she resumed performing in 1956. In 1959, she recorded the definitive version of \"Rompiendo la rutina\" backed by la Gran Orquesta T\u00edpica Nacional, directed by Gilberto Vald\u00e9s. In 1960, \u00c1lvarez recorded her only LP record at Havana's EGREM studios (the former Panart studios) with Rafael Somavilla's orchestra, an album that included famous boleros such as \"Campanitas de cristal\" (Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez) and \"Obsesi\u00f3n\" (Pedro Flores). Her last public appearance took place on May 18, 1965 in the television show M\u00fasica y Estrellas, where she performed the bolero \"Honda pena\" together with famous danz\u00f3n singer Barbarito D\u00edez and the popular charanga Orquesta Arag\u00f3n. Paulina \u00c1lvarez died on July 22, 1965, in Havana. ==Legacy and influence== Paulina \u00c1lvarez is considered one of the most influential popular female singers in Cuba, as acknowledged by salsa star Celia Cruz who considered herself a disciple of \u00c1lvarez. In 2010, famous bolero singer Omara Portuondo recorded a tribute album to \u00c1lvarez called Rompiendo la rutina, which was awarded one of the special prizes at Cubadisco 2011. ==References== Category:1912 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Cuban female singers Category:Danz\u00f3n singers Category:20th-century Cuban singers Category:People from Cienfuegos Category:People from Havana Category:20th-century women singers ",
