It is housed in a group of shops and commercial premises \"unified by a classical parapet with classical cappings and balusters\" constructed by the Windsor family in 1908. == Motor Museum== The museum was a proposal of James Harwood, who suggested Peter Briggs buy a building for his motor vehicle collection. Harwood and Briggs had been collecting vehicles since the 1960s. For Briggs, that involvement came through local motor sports. In the late 1960s he won the MG Car Club Annual Championship three times and established himself as a broker of vintage vehicles and aeroplanes. The museum opened on 8 December 1979 with 1,100 square metres of floor space. In 1984, the Museum won the Sir David Brand Award for tourism. For more than 15 years, the curator of the museum was Peter Harbin, who had a history of motor racing. The museum offers three main galleries of cars, motor bikes and bicycles, two general areas and one specialising in the history of motor sport. The museum has 60 cars and 16 motor cycles and other vehicles as well as motor memorabilia. A number of vehicles are on loan from the Western Australian Museum and other collectors but most vehicles are still part of Briggs' collection. The York Motor Museum is staffed by volunteers and is open every day from 9 am to 4 pm. There is a small admission fee. The museum started the York Festival of Motoring, which is now the York Motor Show. Although the museum remains very involved in it, the Show is now run by the York Branch of the Veteran Car Club of WA, and draws thousands of car enthusiasts. Since 2017 the museum has been owned by the non-profit Avon Valley Motor Museum Association and is a community venture. == Cars == Cars in the Museum include: *Australian Six 1919 *B\u00e9d\u00e9lia 1910 *Benz 1901 *BSA cars 1910 *BMW Isetta 1956 *Cadillac 1906 *Cadillac Eldorado 1958 *Cl\u00e9ment 1901 *Falcon XK 1962 *Ford Model T 1910 *Ford Prefect Ute 1951 *Holden FE 1957 *Holden FX 1951 *Holden Torana 1972 *Holsman 1906 *Hupmobile 1910 *Leyland P76 1974 *Maybach 1955 *Morris 1100 1968 *Morris Cowley 1926 *Morris Minor 1948 *Morris Oxford 1954 *Offenhauser 1954 *Oldsmobile 1903 *Packard 1927 *Peugeot B\u00e9b\u00e9 1913 *Porsche 356 *Rover 1904 *Studebaker 1926 *Subaru 1961 *Toyota Corolla 1978 *Toyota Corona 1967, 1977 *Toyota Prius pre December 1997 *Toyota S800 *Wolsley police car 1948 *Vauxhall Viva 1964 *Volvo 244 1976 *VW Beetle 1945 == History of the property == From the late 1830s to 1859, the property was part of the Government Farm surrounding various government buildings such as the court house and survey office.Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News 30 November 1855, p.3. As York Town Lot 101, the property was granted by the government to builder, wheelwright and furniture maker George Wansbrough on 12 May 1859 for \u00a310; he constructed a cottage on the site which also had an oven, indicating the original use for the building was as a bakery.Landgate Crown Grant ET 1655. The substantial increase in price on the sale to Joseph Hardey indicates that buildings had been constructed on the site before sale. Also refer to R Erikson: Dictionary of Western Australians re Henry Thielemann and the next reference. The first known baker at this location was Henry Beard in 1863. Henry was only there a short time and then became publican of Monger's York Hotel, before being sent to gaol for sheep stealing.Bill Marwick: Mary Marwick of York, The Life and Times of Mary Ann Taylor, 2016, p.54. He appears to have been replaced by John Thompson.The Inquirer and Commercial News, 14 August 1867, p.2. The property was sold to Joseph Hardey in 1864 for \u00a3218.Hardey was noted as the proprietor in May 1864 in an advertisement offering the property for sale: West Australian Times, 12 May 1864, p.2. The property was described as \"substantially built cottage, oven and premises\". The deed of assignment of sale was registered in 1865: Landgate Deeds Index VI/302/1872 dated 24 April 1865. Hardey, of Peninsula Farm, one of the early settlers in Western Australia, died in May 1874R Erikson: Dictionary of Western Australians. and the property continued to be owned by his executors. Henry Beard returned to the premises as a baker but then moved out in 1877.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 8 December 1877, p.2. The next known tenant of these first buildings is James Archdeacon, who commenced business as a baker in the premises in 1879.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 28 June 1879, p.2, 2 August 1879, p.4, the bakery being described as \"next door to the courthouse\". Archdeacon left to go to Geraldton in 1883. This business was successively taken over by George Scrivener and then Henry Thielemann. Thielemann was the son of a baker and had learned his trade in England. He continued to run the bakery until 1907.R Erikson: Dictionary of Western Australians, who describes the bakery building as a two storeyed building; Eastern Districts Chronicle, 21 December 1907, p.3. At the time, the building was also occupied by JJ Lawler.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 21 September 1907, p.3. In 1907 the council ordered that both buildings on the property be removed \"owing to their dilapidated condition\".Eastern Districts Chronicle, 20 April 1907, p.3; 11 May 1907, p.3; 8 June 1907, p.4; 21 September 1907, p.3. The property then became a vacant block. One of the problems of the property was that the Avon Terrace footpath was above the building line. In April 1907, the local manager of the Union Bank, J C Windsor asked the York Council to lower the footpath level to a \"normal level\" to facilitate construction of a \"decent building\" on the site. \"How could people be expected to build if they do not know the proper levels\", asked Cr Harris at a council meeting. The council agreed to lower the footpath at a cost of between \u00a370 and \u00a375.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 20 April 1907, p.3. Windsor's wife, Adeline Hannah Windsor, then bought the property from the executors of Hardey's estate on 18 January 1908 for \u00a3733 five shillings.Landgate Deeds Index XV/247/984. At the time, the property was rated as having a capital value of \u00a31,200.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 14 March 1908, p.3. The capital value was actually \u00a31,500 but the council allowed this to be reduced this to \u00a31,200. Adeline was the daughter of Tasmanian engineer and successful foundry owner Ishmael Ernest Eldon Salisbury and the brother of engineer William Robert Peel Salisbury.Ancestry.com Parker Family Tree, Australian Dictionary of Biography. The Windsors also owned Central Buildings (and constructed the 1907 section) and a machinery store in Howick Street.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 14 March 1908, p.3. == Construction of Windsor\u2019s buildings == In August 1908, the tender of J W Rebonds was accepted by the Windsors for the erection of offices and shops on the site. \"The work will be started almost immediately\".Eastern Districts Chronicle, 15 August 1908, p.2. Plans were approved by the council on 19 August 1908.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 22 August 1908, p.3. The buildings were constructed by the end of November 1908 as tenants started advertising that they had moved their businesses to \"Windsor\u2019s Buildings\". == Tenants == Former tenants of the building include: *J J Lawler bailiff, land agentEastern Districts Chronicle, 28 November 1908, p.2. *Thorn & Stewart, from 1910 Thorn & Brownlie, machinery agents, being agents for Massey Harris, Dalgety & Co, Splatt, Wall & Co, Chas AtkinsEastern Districts Chronicle, 5 December 1908, p.3, 19 December 1908, p.3, 10 June 1910. *JA Trask, solicitor *York Roads BoardLaurie Davies: York, Its Horse and Hey Days, L Davies, 1982, p.viii; The Beverley Times, 13 April 1951, pp.21 and 27. *Alfred G Mattiske, draper (1910)York Town Council rate book, 1910. *Mrs Mary Ellen Lansell, women's clothing, frocks and hats (1928)York Town Council rate book, 1928; York Chronicle, 3 February 1928,p 2. *M L (Toby) Evans (to 1950) and Roly Iddison (Evans & Iddison from 1950), solicitorsLaurie Davies: York, Its Horse and Hey Days, L Davies, 1982, p.viii; The Beverley Times, 13 April 1951, p.6. *E T Hick and G E L Wrench, general store, with liquor licenceEastern Districts Chronicle, 17 November 1916, p.2.

The petrol bowser in front of the building was placed there by the Eastern Districts Trading Co in 1936. That company requested the council to declare the parking bays in front of the bowsers non-parking but the council declined this request.York Chronicle, 4 December 1936, p.2.
