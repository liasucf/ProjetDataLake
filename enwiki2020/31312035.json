    "text": "Stuck with Hackett is a television show created and produced by Silver Machine for the Science Channel. It was commissioned as a pilot in 2010 and picked up as a nine-part series which began airing on August 18, 2011. It follows the trials and tribulations of artist Chris Hackett, founder of the Madagascar Institute as he turns everyday trash, into new and unexpected machines or mechanisms. == Format == Each episode takes Hackett to a different abandoned location. In season one, Hackett visits a variety of places, including a rail yard, a munitions factory, and a log cabin. After deciding what he\u2019s going to create to make his stay in the abandoned location more enjoyable, Hackett begins to collect various pieces of \"obtainium\", a term he uses for anything from trash to scrap metal to large pieces of machinery that are being repurposed. Hackett then proceeds to construct the desired completed object, with \"off camera support\" of his production team. == Chris Hackett == Chris Hackett is an artist who grew up in New York. He creates large, interactive art installations. He is the founder of The Madagascar Institute, an artist cooperative space based in Brooklyn, New York. == Episodes == Episodes broadcast in 2011.\"Episode Guide : Stuck with Hackett : Science Channel\".

This is the guy I want to be lost with when the [apocalypse] comes...\" In Wired, Dave Giancaspro recommended the series to viewers. Common Sense Media used \"cool\", \"exceptional\", \"clear\" and \"compelling\" to describe the science lessons embodied in the show, while cautioning that kids should be taught not to follow Hackett's example of tearing apart his environment, and occasionally blowing things up; the non-profit group rated the show as appropriate for ages 9 and up. In Media Life Magazine, Tom Conroy found the show \"fun, engrossing and informative\", except for Hackett's overuse of the word \"obtainium.\" Of the pilot episode, Conroy wondered if an abandoned rail yard would have a working pump car, a working gasoline engine, and nearby fueled-up lawn mowers, and wondered how much \"support\" Hackett received during the project. He found what Hackett achieved to be \"amazing\" nonetheless, and beyond the show's educational content, declared Hackett \"fun\". == References == == External links == *Stuck with Hackett Official Site *Silver Machine Company Site *Madagascar Institute Official Site Category:Science Channel original programming Category:2010 American television series debuts Category:2011 American television series endings ",
