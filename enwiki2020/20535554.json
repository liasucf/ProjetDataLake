    "text": "Swiss Travel System\"Swiss Travel System\" is a brand used by the Swiss Federal Railways \"Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS)\" since 1989 or earlier to promote a range of public transportation tickets aimed at foreign visitors of Switzerland. By extension, the name is also frequently used by non-Swiss sources to refer to Switzerland's public transport network as a whole, which does not in fact bear that name. __NOTOC__ ==Travel passes== The Swiss Travel System offers various passes as detailed below. They are not available to residents of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, and can be purchased over the internet with electronic delivery, or at staffed Swiss train stations. ===Swiss Travel Pass / Swiss Travel Pass Flex=== The Swiss Travel Pass allows unlimited ticket-less travel on the Swiss public transport network (trains, buses, ships and tramways) for a certain number of days (3, 4, 8 or 15 consecutive days), as well as free or discounted entry to most Swiss museums. Discounts apply to mountain transport (lifts, funiculars, cogwheel trains). Some mountain transport is free of charge.\"MySwissAlps | Swiss Travel Pass\" The Swiss Travel Pass Flex works exactly like the Swiss Travel Pass, but can be used to travel on 3, 4, 8 or 15 consecutive or non-consecutive days within one month.\"MySwissAlps | Swiss Travel Pass Flex\" ===Swiss Half Fare Card=== The Swiss Half Fare Card allows unlimited travel for one month at half the regular fare.\"MySwissAlps | Swiss Half Fare Card\" Tickets need to be purchased for each trip. ===Swiss Transfer Ticket=== The Swiss Transfer Ticket is no longer available from January 1, 2019. It was a return ticket from the Swiss border or an airport to any destination. ==References== Category:Public transport in Switzerland Category:Passenger rail transport in Switzerland ",
