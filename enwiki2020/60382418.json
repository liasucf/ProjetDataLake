In 2013, Charaipotra co- founded CAKE Literary, a \"boutique book development company with a decidedly diverse bent\", with her Tiny Pretty Things co-author Dhonielle Clayton. The two friends met at The New School at the beginning of their MFA and bonded over a shared feeling that they were unrepresented in children and YA books growing up and wanting to change that. They founded CAKE Literary on the belief that \"rich, diversity-infused reads that are still compulsively readable \u2014 and very relatable\" are possible. The company focuses on developing readable, high concept ideas to middle grade, YA, and women's fiction. Charaipotra is a team member of We Need Diverse Books, a non-profit organization focused on increasing diversity in book publishing. She is also a screenwriter, whose projects have been developed by MTV films. == Selected works == Her solo debut, Symptoms of a Heartbreak, was inspired by shows like Doogie Howser, M.D. Charaipotra saw the novel as an opportunity to write a similar story with Indian protagonists.
