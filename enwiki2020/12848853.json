Boris was the son of Mikhail Yaroslavich Khorobrit, who was the younger brother of Aleksandr Nevsky, and would thus have been Daniil's uncle. Boris' father was briefly Grand Prince of Vladimir in 1248, but Boris never seems to have held that title. Following Boris' death, Daniil took control of Moscow only in about 1283.K.
