    "text": "The perimetrium (or serous coat of uterus) is the outer serosa layer of the uterus, equivalent to peritoneum. It is embrionically derived from visceral peritoneum. The perimetrium consists of superficial mesothelium, and a thin layer of loose connective tissue beneath it. The posterior surface of the uterus is completely covered by the perimetrium, but the anterior surface only partially.Manual of Obstetrics. (3rd ed.). Elsevier. pp. 1-16. . thumb Anteriorly it lies over the fundus and the body where it is folded on to the upper surface of the urinary bladder. This fold of peritoneum forms of Vesicouterine Pouch. Posteriorly the peritoneum covers the fundus, the body and the cervix, then it folds back on to the rectum to form the Rectouterine pouch. ==References== ==External links== * - \"The Female Pelvis: The uterus\" * - \"Mammal, uterus (LM, Low)\" Category:Mammal female reproductive system ",
