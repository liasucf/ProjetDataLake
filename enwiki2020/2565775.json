    "text": "A Q-Star, also known as a grey hole, is a hypothetical type of a compact, heavy neutron star with an exotic state of matter. Such a star can be smaller than the progenitor star's Schwarzschild radius and have a gravitational pull so strong that some, but not all light, cannot escape. The Q stands for a conserved particle number. A Q-Star may be mistaken for a stellar black hole. ==Types of Q-stars== *SUSY Q-ball *B-ball, stable Q-balls with a large baryon number B. They may exist in neutron stars that have absorbed Q-ball(s). ==See also== *Black hole **Stellar black hole *Compact star **Exotic star ***Boson star ***Electroweak star ***Preon star ***Strange star ***Quark star ==References== ==External links== *Abstract, Are Q-stars a serious threat for stellar-mass black hole candidates?, Miller J.C., Shahbaz T., Nolan L.A, 1997 *Abstract, No observational proof of the black-hole event-horizon, Marek A.
