After his death, she became the world's leading authority on Spiritism. ==Early life== She was the only daughter of Julien Louis Boudet, notary, and Julie-Louise Seigneat of Lacombe, teacher. Growing up, she was known by the nickname \"Gaby.\" ==Marriage== On February 9, 1832, she married Allan Kardec. ==Career== According to the biographer Henri Sausse, she was a first-class teacher who founded the first Escola Normal Leiga with the guidance of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi on Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris, where she lived all her life. She graduated from the \u00c9cole Normale and became a primary school teacher, and later a professor of literature and of the fine arts. She is the author of three books: Fabulae Primaveris (1825), Notions de Dessin (1826), and L'Essentiel dans les Beaux-arts (1828). She was also a poet and artist, and was said to have a mastery of traditional techniques. ===Role in the creation of Spiritism=== Beginning in 1856, Am\u00e9lie Boudet aided her husband in codifying Spiritism, served as his secretary, and gave him advice, of which he took great account. When Allan Kardec was asked to found the Revue Spirite, the spiritualist bookshop and local Parisian Society of Spiritist Studies, it was Boudet who encouraged him to devote himself to this publication despite many detractors.Article : Compte Rendu des Obs\u00e8ques de Madame Allan Kardec, La Revue Spirite, January 1883 After the death of her husband in 1869, Boudet assumed all the necessary responsibilities for the management of Spiritism in France and the world. She assumed the management of the Revue Spirite and its publications, gaining rights to the spiritualist works of Kardec. ==Death== grave at Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re Lachaise. The inscription says Naitre, mourir, renaitre encore et progresser sans cesse, telle est la loi (\"To be born, die, again be reborn, and so progress unceasingly, such is the law\"). Boudet died in her Paris home on 21 January 1883 and was buried next to her husband in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. ==Published works== * Fabulae Primaveris (1825) * Notions de Dessin (1826) * L'Essentiel dans les Beaux-arts (1828) ==Honours== In 2004, a Parisian spiritual center of Spiritism, L'Institut Am\u00e9lie Boudet, was named after her. ==Bibliography== Souto Maior, Marcel.
