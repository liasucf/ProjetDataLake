    "text": "Richard Andrew Ryder, Baron Ryder of Wensum, (born 4 February 1949) is a British Conservative Party politician. A former Member of Parliament (MP) and government minister, he was made a life peer in 1997 and is now a member of the House of Lords. ==Early life== He was educated at Radley College and Magdalene College, Cambridge. In the 1981 Birthday Honours Ryder was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for political service. ==Parliamentary career== Having unsuccessfully fought the Labour seat of Gateshead East in February and October 1974, Ryder was elected at the 1983 general election as MP for the Mid Norfolk constituency. From 1990 to 1995 he was the government's Chief Whip. This period includes the Conservative backbench rebellion over the Maastricht Treaty. The maverick MPs, known as the Maastricht Rebels, were under intense pressure from the government whips but still brought the administration of John Major close to collapse. Ryder retired from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, and was created a life peer as Baron Ryder of Wensum, of Wensum in the County of Norfolk on 22 November 1997. ==Outside Parliament== He became Vice-Chairman of the BBC on 1 January 2002 for a four-year term. Ryder was appointed Acting Chairman of the BBC following the resignation of Gavyn Davies on 28 January 2004. Davies resigned following the criticism of the BBC in the Hutton Report, which was set up to investigate \"the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr David Kelly\". One of Ryder's first acts as Chairman was to give a televised statement, during which he offered an unreserved apology for the mistakes made during the Dr. Kelly affair. This apology was criticised by many, including departing Director General, Greg Dyke, as overdone. In the same statement Ryder announced that the process to select a new Chairman had begun, and that he would not be putting his name forward. Michael Grade was appointed on 2 April 2004 and took up his post on 17 May; Ryder resumed the post of Vice- Chairman. Ryder resigned early on 1 August 2004, after which the position was assumed by Anthony Salz. Ryder is the Chairman of the Institute of Cancer Research, and is a director of Ipswich Town F.C.. ==Family== He is a nephew of the late Sue Ryder, the Baroness Ryder of Warsaw. ==References== == External links == * *BBC News Profile |- |- |- |- |- |- |- Category:1949 births Category:Alumni of Magdalene College, Cambridge Category:BBC Governors Category:Chairmen of the BBC Category:Conservative Party (UK) life peers Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Living people Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People educated at Radley College Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997 Category:United Kingdom Paymasters General Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire ",
