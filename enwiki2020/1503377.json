They are the opposite of monsters like Muma P\u0103durii. These characters make positive appearances in fairy tales and reside mostly in the woods. They can also be considered the Romanian equivalent of fairies and of the Germanic elf. They vary in size and appearance, though they can polymorph to the extent of blending into their surroundings for protection and cover. They can appear openly in the woods and coax travelers to follow them in order to help them find their way. They can also hide in the woods and quietly guide those who need help through signs and \"breadcrumbs\" through the forest. They give life to fetuses in utero and bestow upon them great gifts like the art of dancing, beauty, kindness, and luck. In folk tales, it is told not to upset them because they also have the power to do bad things or put a curse on the wrongdoer. They also act like guardian angels, especially for children who enter the woods, or for other good people. The word z\u00e2n\u0103 comes from the Roman goddess Diana (as does Astur-Leonese xana). She is the one who has all the beauty, and is the one that gives it away. Z\u00e2n\u0103 is also used in current Romanian slang to refer to an attractive girl, though it is not necessarily the kindest way to do so. ==References== http://www.creepyhollows.com/faq/index.php?action=artikel&cat;=7&id;=1572&artlang;=en Category:Romanian mythology Category:Fairies Category:Romanian legendary creatures ro:Z\u00e2n\u0103 ",
