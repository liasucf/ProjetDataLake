    "text": "Re Londonderry's Settlement [1965] Ch 918 is an English trusts law case concerning the duty of trustees to provide information to beneficiaries. It has been heavily criticised and possibly doubted by Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd.[2003] UKPC 26 ==Facts== A beneficiary did not like the small sums proposed to be distributed to her. She wanted information about the reasons for the decision. ==Judgment== The Court of Appeal held that there was no need for disclosure of reasons, because it could cause family strife, fruitless litigation or make the trustees\u2019 role impossible. ==See also== *Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd [2003] UKPC 26 *Hartigan Nominees v Rydge (1992) 29 NSWLR 405, Kirby P said it would not be unduly burdensome for professional trustees to provide reasoned decisions and that would be likely to cause less strife than no reasons at all. *Hawkesley v May [1955] 3 WLR 569, obligation to inform beneficiaries of their status as beneficiaries when they turn 18. *Re Manisty\u2019s Settlement [1971] Ch 17, no necessary duty to inform objects of a power of their status, only the primary objects, who are identifiable only as a question of fact *Murphy v Murphy [1999] 1 WLR 283, a settlor had to provide information to a discretionary beneficiary. A more remote beneficiary may not have gained disclosure. ==Notes== ==References== *R Walker, \u2018Some Trust Principles in the Pensions Context\u2019 in AJ Oakley (ed) Trends in Contemporary Trust Law (Clarendon, Oxford 1996) 123, 131 *Lord Browne-Wilkinson, \u2018Equity and its relevance to superannuation today\u2019 (Leo Cussen Institute) cited in Crown v Stevedoring Employees Retirement Fund [2003] VSC 316, [34] *DJ Hayton and C Mitchell, The Law of Trusts and Equitable Remedies (Sweet and Maxwell 2005) 9-295, 677, says that in \u2018my firm opinion\u2019 it is undermined by Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd on its own terms in family trusts, also citing agreement from Lord Hoffmann and Lightman J. ==External links== * Category:English trusts case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:1965 in British law Category:1965 in case law ",
