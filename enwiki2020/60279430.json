The telenovela is set in Argentina in the 1930s, in times of prosperity and progress as well as the wave of mainly European immigration in Argentina and political and economic decline.

At the end of the 30s, Bruno arrives in Argentina, in order to avenge Torcuato's treachery and rescue his sister Julia, who fell into the clutches of a pimp. Bruno gets asylum in a typical conventillo in Buenos Aires and from there he begins to plot his revenge plan. However, while plotting his plan, Bruno falls madly in love with Luc\u00eda Morel, the young and beautiful fianc\u00e9e of Torcuato Ferreyra. Luc\u00eda is an intelligent, feminist and sensitive young woman who only agrees to marry Torcuato at the insistence of her vile mother to get money for the operation of her father, who is sick with tuberculosis. Meanwhile, Aldo, a good-hearted hustler who is dedicated to convincing Spanish immigrants to embark towards Argentina under the pretext of being the land of opportunities, will do his best to rescue a young and beautiful Polish girl, Raquel, from the brothel where Julia is. Other subplots of the telenovela include the romance between two young boys, Nino and Malek, the repressed homosexuality of Lucia's mother and the unrequited love of Alicia, Torcuato's sister, for Aldo. == Cast == === Main === * Benjam\u00edn Vicu\u00f1a as Torcuato Ferreyra * Gonzalo Heredia as Aldo Moretti * Mar\u00eda Eugenia Su\u00e1rez as Raquel Liberman * Albert Bar\u00f3 as Bruno Salvat * Delfina Chaves as Luc\u00eda Morel * Fern\u00e1n Mir\u00e1s as Samuel Trauman * Andrea Frigerio as Madama Ivonne * Virginia Innocenti as Libertad Morel === Recurring === * Mercedes Funes as Alicia Ferreyra * Julia Calvo as Serafina * Malena S\u00e1nchez as Francesca Moretti * Candela Vetrano as Anna Moretti * Diego Dom\u00ednguez as C\u00f3rdoba * Ruggero Pasquarelli as Toro * Mat\u00edas Mayer as Gallo * Federico Salles as Gabriel Morel * Gast\u00f3n Cocchiarale as Lowenstein * Minerva Casero as Lidia Morel * Tom\u00e1s Kirzner as Juli\u00e1n * Ana Pauls as Edith * Fausto Bengoechea as Alambre * Franco Quercia as Malek * Ariel P\u00e9rez de Mar\u00eda as Al\u00ed Moretti * Joaqu\u00edn Flamini as Nino * Juan Manuel Correa * Laura Minguell == Television rating == == References == Category:2019 telenovelas Category:2019 Argentine television series debuts Category:El Trece original programming Category:Argentine telenovelas Category:Spanish-language telenovelas Category:Pol-ka telenovelas ",
