He later told friends that he left the Air Force Academy because he learned, after he'd already enrolled, that his height and size (6-foot-5, 230 lb.) precluded him from ever becoming a fighter pilot. He received All-Western Athletic Conference and honorable mention All- America honors in 1976. Billick was selected in the 11th round with the 295th overall pick of the 1977 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, but was released by both the 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys that year and never played in the NFL. ==Coaching career== ===College=== In 1977, after being cut by the 49ers, Billick appeared as a contestant on TV's Match Game PM in 1977, losing to Marla Marshall.Match Game PM #3-19 Panelist Richard Dawson remarked after Billick's loss: \"Football: Failed.

Billick worked as a graduate assistant at Brigham Young for one season (1978) before joining the 49ers as the assistant director of public relations for two years (1979-1980). He returned to coaching with San Diego State University, serving as the tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator for five seasons (1981-1985) under Doug Scovil.https://www.si.com/vault/1981/10/12/826002/air-aztec-is-flying-high- coach-doug-scovil-a-master-at-developing-quality-quarterbacks-has-san-diego- state-winging-once-more-and-it-has-zoomed-to-three-straight-wins-on-the-road After being named the offensive coordinator of Utah State University, Billick improved the second-worst offense in Division I-A into a top-10 offense in three seasons (1986-1988). Billick was then hired as the assistant head coach and tight ends coach at Stanford by Dennis Green, serving both roles for three seasons (1989-91). ===National Football League=== ====Assistant coach==== Billick was hired as an Assistant coach by the Vikings. The Vikings made the playoffs during six of the seven seasons (1992-1998) that Billick spent with the team, and set several offensive records in the process. In 1998, Minnesota set an NFL record for most points scored in a season (556) (which has since been broken by the 2007 Patriots and the 2013 Broncos), and set a team record with 41 touchdown passes. His work under Minnesota head coach Dennis Green put Billick in the Bill Walsh coaching tree. ====Head coach==== Billick became the second head coach in Baltimore Ravens history on January 20, 1999 when he was appointed to replace Ted Marchibroda.Denlinger, Ken. \"Billick Named Coach of Ravens,\" The Washington Post, Wednesday, January 20, 1999. Retrieved May 13, 2018 He had an 85-67 record in nine seasons (1999-2007) with the team, including 5-3 in the playoffs. He won a Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXV over the New York Giants. Although Billick had the opportunity to interview for the head coaching job of the reactivated Cleveland Browns and was rumored to be their top candidate, he chose to interview with the Ravens first. He signed with Baltimore in under 24 hours after his initial interview. In his first season with the Ravens, Billick led the team to its first non-losing record (8-8) in the franchise's four-year history.

The next season, the Ravens finished with a 12-4 record and earned their first playoff berth. Prior to reaching the playoffs, Billick forbade his players from using either the term \"playoffs\" or the term \"Super Bowl,\" with the idea of keeping them focused on winning each game instead of on a more distant prize. Billick felt this approach would help them reach that goal, and went so far as to fine Tony Siragusa for violating the rule. In response, the players borrowed the term \"Festivus\" from the television series Seinfeld for the playoffs, and the term Festivus Maximus for the Super Bowl. When they reached the playoffs, Billick lifted this ban. The Ravens took advantage of their vaunted defense, which allowed an NFL record- low 165 points in the regular season (for a point differential of 168; the Ravens also led the league in turnover differential at +23) during the playoffs to advance to Super Bowl XXXV against the New York Giants. It was a blowout 34-7 victory, giving Billick his first and only Super Bowl. Billick led the Ravens to a 10-6 record and a victory over the Miami Dolphins in a 2001 wild card playoff game before losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional Round. Baltimore finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs in 2002, but bounced back in 2003 with a 10-6 record and the franchise's first division title; the key game of this season was a wild 44-41 overtime win over the Seattle Seahawks in which the Ravens scored 20 unanswered points from the 10:14 mark of the fourth quarter through overtime; the win launched the then 5-5 Ravens into the division title. The Ravens lost to the Titans, 20-17, in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. The Ravens missed the playoffs in 2004 with a 9-7 record and in 2005 with a 6-10 record before bouncing back in the 2006 season. Billick fired offensive coordinator Jim Fassel on October 17, 2006, assuming the role for the remainder of the season, as the Ravens earned a franchise best 13-3 record, won the AFC North, and earned the first playoff bye in team history. Baltimore, however, lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts, 15-6, in the divisional round. Billick was fired on December 31, 2007, one day after the conclusion of a 5-11 season punctuated by a Week 15 22-16 overtime loss to the previously winless Miami Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium on December 16.\"Ravens fire head coach Billick after 5-11 season,\" The Associated Press, Monday, December 31, 2007.
