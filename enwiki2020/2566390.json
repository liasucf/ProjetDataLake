    "text": "Zlatan Muslimovi\u0107 (; born 6 March 1981) is a Bosnian former professional footballer who played as a forward. ==Early career== As a teenager, Muslimovi\u0107 played for the Swedish teams Habo IF and Husqvarna FF. He went on to play for the Swedish team IFK G\u00f6teborg youth team in 1998 and 1999, before coming to Italy in 2000. Muslimovi\u0107 was also a goalkeeper for the Brandstorps IF floorball club's team for boys' born in 1981 during the 1994\u201395 season. ==Club career== ===Italy=== Muslimovi\u0107 signed his first professional contract with Udinese. During the 2004\u201305 season, he was the top scorer of Serie C1/A side Rimini, with 15 goals in 32 matches, helping his team in winning the league and being promoted to Serie B. In 2006\u201307 he was loaned to Parma. In June 2007, he signed for Serie A side Atalanta (in a direct swap with Marco Motta) but suffered from lack of playing time under head coach Luigi Delneri. ===PAOK=== On 22 July 2008, Muslimovi\u0107 signed with Greek club PAOK on a three- year deal. He instantly became a fan favourite and largely contributed to PAOK's successful run in the 2008\u201309 season. He scored his first goal for PAOK in a friendly against Udinese and his first league goal in a home game against AEK Athens. He received the nickname \"Alani\" by the Gate 4 fans. During the 2009\u201310 season, however, he began facing many injury problems and managed to score only four times while his playing time kept diminishing. His most memorable goal was in the 2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League play-offs, when he netted a 101st minute 1\u20131 equalizer against Fenerbah\u00e7e, sending PAOK through to the group stages. After another disappointing season, however, it was decided that his contract would not be renewed; his last official game for PAOK was against Olympiakos Volou on 25 May 2011, where he also scored. ===Guizhou Renhe=== On 20 February 2012, after being without a club for nine months, Muslimovi\u0107 signed with Chinese Super League side Guizhou Renhe. On 8 April, scored his first goal for the senior Guizhou Renhe side. ==International career== Muslimovi\u0107 has made 28 appearances for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team (as of 17 October 2011) since making his debut in 2006 in a friendly match against France as a second-half substitute. He also played for the team in their UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying matches against Malta (twice), Hungary, Norway and Turkey. Against Croatia, he scored a hat-trick. One of Muslimovi\u0107's most memorable current games was the encounter with Norway in Oslo. He and midfielder Zvjezdan Misimovi\u0107 scored early goals in the first half giving Bosnia a night to remember on 24 March 2007 with a 2\u20131 victory. He turned in another solid performance in the match against Turkey by slotting home a pass from Misimovi\u0107 past R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Re\u00e7ber to level the score at 1\u20131. Bosnia went on to win the game 3\u20132 with 89th-minute substitute Adnan \u010custovi\u0107 heading in from a corner. Muslimovi\u0107 is one of only six national players (with Elvir Boli\u0107, Elvir Balji\u0107 [who scored four goals in one game], Zvjezdan Misimovi\u0107, Vedad Ibi\u0161evi\u0107 and Edin D\u017eeko) to ever score a hat-trick for Bosnia, doing so during a friendly against Croatia. In the qualifying rounds for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa in November 2009, Bosnia was eliminated by Portugal; Muslimovi\u0107's shot hit the goalpost during the match in Lisbon. == International goals == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |+ !
