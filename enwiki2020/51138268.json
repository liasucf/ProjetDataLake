    "text": "\"S\u00f3 Dan\u00e7o Samba\" (aka \"Jazz 'n' Samba\") is a bossa nova song composed in 1962 by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, with lyrics by Vinicius de Moraes. English lyrics were later written by Norman Gimbel. On occasion, it has also been known as \"Jazz Samba\" and \"I Only Dance Samba\", an English translation of the original Portuguese title. In Bossa Nova: The Story of the Brazilian Music That Seduced the World, author Ruy Castro suggests that the song was part of a failed movement to invent a bossa nova dance. \"Jobim, who had never danced in his life, had just finished writing 'S\u00f3 dan\u00e7o samba' [Jazz 'n' Samba] with Vinicius, but it was without much conviction. So much so, in fact, that on hearing 'S\u00f3 dan\u00e7o samba' for the first time, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto asked him, 'What's this Tomzinho? A boogie-woogie?'\"Castro, Ruy, Bossa nova: the story of the Brazilian music that seduced the world, A Cappella Books, Chicago, IL, 2000. The song was first performed by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Os Cariocas in August 1962 at the Au Bon Gourmet restaurant in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, at what Castro calls \"the bossa nova show to end all bossa nova shows\", as it featured Jobim, Gilberto, Vin\u00edcius de Moraes and Os Cariocas on stage together for the first and last time. A few months later, Gilberto and Os Cariocas performed the song again in the Italian film, Copacabana Palace (1962),IMDB \u2013 Copacabana Palace (1962) in which they are briefly shown singing together.
