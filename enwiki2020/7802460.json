    "text": "The is a suburban electric multiple unit (EMU) train type operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in the Kant\u014d region of Japan since 1994. ==Design== Introduced in 1994 to replace the 113 series EMUs running on the S\u014dbu Line (Rapid) and Yokosuka Line, it was the first outer-suburban train type in Japan to feature four pairs of doors per side on car. The basic design was developed from the 209 series commuter EMUs. It replaced all the Yokosuka Line 113 series trains by 1999. The trains were built jointly by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Tokyu Car, and JR East (Niitsu and Ofuna factories). They use Mitsubishi IGBT transistors (formerly GTO) and VVVF inverters with Mitsubishi MT68 traction motors. Gear ratio is 97:16. ==Operations== * Kashima Line (Sawara - Kashima-Jing\u016b) * Narita Line (Chiba - Narita Airport, Sawara) * S\u014dbu Main Line (Tokyo - Narut\u014d) * Sotob\u014d Line (Chiba - Kazusa-Ichinomiya) * Uchib\u014d Line (Chiba - Kimitsu) * Yokosuka Line ===Former operations=== * T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line (Tokyo - Atami) (March 2006 - March 2015) * Airport Narita (name discontinued March 2018) ==Formations== ===Current formations=== ====11-car Yokosuka/S\u014dbu Line sets==== , 51 11-car sets (Y-01\u2013Y-51) are based at Kamakura Depot and formed with four motored (\"M\") cars and seven non- powered trailer (\"T\") cars. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |style=\"background- color:#ccc;\"| |colspan=\"11\"| \u2190 Kimitsu, Narita Airport Kurihama \u2192 |-style=\"line-height: 1.5px; background-color: #2222dd;\" |colspan=\"12\" style=\"padding:0; border:0;\"| |-style=\"line-height: 5.5px; background-color: #ffeebb;\" |colspan=\"12\" style=\"padding:0; border:0;\"| |-style=\"line-height: 3px; background-color: #2222dd;\" |colspan=\"12\" style=\"padding:0; border:0;\"| |- !

In March 2006, three 15-car trains were reformed as 10+5-car sets and transferred to K\u014dzu depot for use from 14 March 2006 on T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line duties out of Tokyo alongside E231 series trains. The sets were repainted into the same Shonan color scheme of orange and green bodyside stripes as applied to the E231s. These sets were all transferred back to Yokosuka/S\u014dbu Line services by March 2015. A programme of refurbishment on the fleet commenced from 2008 and was completed in 2012. Externally, sets received lighter blue and cream stripes. The sets are to be replaced by the newer E235-1000 series from fiscal 2020. ==Incidents== On December 25, 2014, an 11+4 car train consisting of sets Y12 and Y129 broke down on the Yokosuka Line due to electrical problems; another 11+4 car train consisting of sets Y23 and Y130 was sent to tow the faulty set from Tokyo Station to Kamakura Depot, creating an immensely long thirty-car train. While this was happening, the entire train did not stop at any stations to pick up any passengers. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * JR E217 series Category:Electric multiple units of Japan Category:East Japan Railway Company Category:Train- related introductions in 1994 Category:Tokyu Car rolling stock Category:Kawasaki rolling stock ",
