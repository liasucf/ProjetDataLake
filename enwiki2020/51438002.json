A modern church 0.5 km to the north-east serving the area was constructed in 1844. Archer and Smith describe it as similar in purpose to other churches constructed at Killeen and Dunsany. ==Location== Rathmore Church is located northeast of Athboy, to the west of Jamestown Bog. ==History== Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket was a lawyer and judge of the mid-15th century, serving as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1461 and 1463. He was married to Marion Cruise (Mary Anne Cruys) and died in 1471; the couple are buried together at Rathmore, Marion's hereditary seat. Lieutenant-General Thomas Bligh (d. 1775) of the 20th Regiment of Foot has a monumental tablet in the church. He fought at Dettingen, Val, Fontneay, and Melle. He was also commander of the British troops at Cherbourg. p. 120https://www.libraryireland.com/topog/R/Rathmore-Lune-Meath.php The baptismal font was stolen in April 2013 but recovered in May of that year. ==Church== Rathmore Church is a nave and chancel church with a three-storey sacristy and a tall bell tower. Features include a piscina, sedilia, carved heads and labyrinth stone. The effigy of Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket is in good condition; he wears armour and a dog sleeps at his feet.
