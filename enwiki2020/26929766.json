She lists her obsessions as water, ancient Rome, infrastructure, SuperFund, airplanes, silent film, panopticons, P. T.

Strand describes Flight as \u201cthe echoes and overlaps of four voices.\u201d The story takes places in the days leading up to a wedding in rural Michigan as the Gruens, a Midwestern family, struggle with their individual private dramas. Strand's second book was nonfiction, Inventing Niagara: Beauty, Power, Lies, and published by Simon & Schuster in early 2008. The book combines history, reportage, and personal narrative to build a cultural history of natural wonder at Niagara Falls. Strand writes about how Niagara Falls has been depicted and used throughout America's history, and how its natural environment has been altered. In researching her second book, Strand used handbills, guidebooks, travelogues, treaties, and images in the American Antiquarian Society's collections. The book chronicles Strands' fascination with infrastructure, which she calls \"a culture's dream made visible.\u201d Inventing Niagara received positive reviews in the New York Times Book Review, Newsweek, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. The book was a finalist for the 2008 Orion Magazine Book Award and was picked as one of summer 2008's best non-fiction books by Fresh Air on NPR. Strand's third book,Killer on the Road: Violence and the American Interstate was published by the University of Texas in 2012. The book looks at the links between serial murder and our Interstate Highway System, and was described in the New York Times as \"part true-crime entertainment, part academic exegesis, part political folk ballad.\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/books/killer-on-the-road-by-ginger- strand.html Profiling highway killers such as Charles Starkweather, Edmund Kemper, Wayne Williams, Roger Kibbe, and Bruce Mendenhall, Strand describes how they utilized the interstates and how the highways themselves serve as what she calls \"analogs of cultural psychosis.\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/lost-highway-revisited-ginger- strands-killer-on-the-road/#! Her fourth book The Brothers Vonnegut: Science and Fiction in the House of Magic was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2015. It traces the lives of brothers Kurt Vonnegut and Bernard Vonnegut during the time when both were working at General Electric in the 1940s, Kurt as a public relations man, and Bernard as a scientist in the General Electric Research Laboratory. It depicts how Bernard's involvement in early experiments in weather modification influenced the early writings of his brother Kurt.
