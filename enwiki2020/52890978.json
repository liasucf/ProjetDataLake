Regarding the interplay between Kepl and Holub, Spicer found it \"convincing and compelling, with a genuine sense of dialogue\". In his review of SololoS, jazz critic Dave Foxall noted the album's various moods, starting with an \"uneasy sawing of the strings\", followed by \"slower, steadier exploration\" and \"overwhelming zeal\". He summarized his impression of the album as \"50+ minutes of pure sonic brio\". Foxall is a frequent contributor to Jazz Journal magazine. Bob Rush of Cadence (magazine) thinks about Violet Spins' spin that \"it is very enjoyable and probably even more so if viewed/heard live\" Daniel Barbiero from Avant Music News detects on the album that Violet Spin \"tends to favor the sound of solo voice soaring over a support of pulsing ostinato, chordal vamps or walking lines\" and that they \"deliver a precise sound when called for, but they can also reach beyond those constraints into the looser language of creative extemporising\", while Michael Ternai of MICA Austria writes: \"Skilfully and passionately making room for their musical and stylistically diversified originality - that\u2019s exactly what Viennese string quartet Violet Spin is doing on their debut album \u2018spin\u2019.\u201d ==Awards== * Gustav Mahler Prize (2012) \u2013 Second-place prize for her composition \"Rise\" * Theodor K\u00f6rner Prize for music and composition (2014) ==General references== * The entry at this database provides lists of compositions, general biographic detail, and other information.
