He would make his debut senior appearance for Dalian with his youth teammate Yang Boyu on 25 June 2008 against Liaoning FC in a 2\u20131 win. As a promising midfielder, L\u00fc would play in several more games for Dalian during the season and was one of the few bright aspects in a disappointing season for the club which saw Dalian flirt with relegation. After surviving relegation, the club would introduce Xu Hong as their new club manager and he would over overhaul the entire squad with many of youngsters that were tried out in the previous season, being one these youngsters L\u00fc gained significant playing time and would aid Dalian to an eighth-place finish at the end of the 2009 season. The next season would see teammate and Chinese international Zhao Xuri move to Shaanxi Renhe, which allowed L\u00fc to be permanently promoted as the club's first choice starter in midfield. At the beginning of the 2013 season, Dalian Shide were taken over by their top tier rivals Dalian Aerbin and L\u00fc would be part of the squad that transferred to the newly enlarged Dalian Aerbin squad. Unfortunately for him, the merger saw his new club exceed the Chinese Football Association's rules on their quota of how many transfers each club was allowed to have, which saw L\u00fc dropped to the club's reserve's until after the summer transfer window opened and he eventually made his debut for the club on 6 July 2013 in a league game against Shandong Luneng that ended in a 1\u20131 draw. On 30 January 2015, L\u00fc transferred to China League One side Beijing Enterprises. He moved to Chinese Super League side Beijing Guoan on 19 January 2017. ==International career== L\u00fc was called up to the Chinese national team by the Chinese Head coach Gao Hongbo and played against Costa Rica on 26 March 2011 where he would start the game and help guide the team to a 2\u20132 draw. ==Career statistics== ===Club statistics=== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Dalian Shide Siwu |2008 |S.League |14||3||1||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||16||3 |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Dalian Shide |2008 |rowspan=\"5\"|Chinese Super League |12||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||12||0 |- |2009||18||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||18||0 |- |2010||28||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||28||0 |- |2011||29||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||29||0 |- |2012||29||0||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||30||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !117!!0!!1!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!118!!1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Dalian Aerbin |2013 |rowspan=\"2\"|Chinese Super League ||15||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||19||0 |- |2014||22||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||22||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !37!!0!!4!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!41!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Beijing Enterprises |2015 |rowspan=\"2\"|China League One |29||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||32||0 |- |2016||29||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||30||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !58!!1!!4!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!62!!1 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Beijing Guoan |2017 |rowspan=\"3\"|Chinese Super League |9||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||9||0 |- |2018||6||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||9||0 |- |2019||12||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||3||0||1||0||19||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !27!!0!!6!!0!!0!!0!!3!!0!!1!!0!!37!!0 |- ! colspan=3 | Career total !252||4||16||1||1||0||3||0||1||0||273||5 |} ===International statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | National team |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2011||2||0 |- |2012||7||0 |- !Total||9||0 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Beijing Guoan *Chinese FA Cup: 2018 == References == == External links == * * * Player profile at sodasoccer.com * Player stats at sohu.com Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese footballers Category:Footballers from Dalian Category:China international footballers Category:Dalian Shide F.C. players Category:Dalian Professional F.C. players Category:Beijing BSU F.C. players Category:Beijing Sinobo Guoan F.C. players Category:Chinese Super League players Category:China League One players Category:Footballers at the 2010 Asian Games Category:Association football midfielders Category:Asian Games competitors for China ",
