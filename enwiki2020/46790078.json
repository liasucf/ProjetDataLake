    "text": "The Winner () is a 2014 Hungarian short film directed by D\u00e1vid G\u00e9czy, starring Andor Luk\u00e1ts and Iv\u00e1n Kamar\u00e1s. The film is supported by Media Council Film and Media Funding Scheme. == Plot == It is a short fiction movie about an old swimming coach, Istv\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs (Andor Luk\u00e1ts), who won a gold medal at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow in swimming. He gets a life-changing medical diagnosis. As a result, he has to abstain from any physical activity. By now all his fame and honour has faded, and he's stuck coaching undisciplined, useless children who'd never understand what it means to strive for something and achieve it. Every day he races against the younger version of himself (Iv\u00e1n Kamar\u00e1s), unable to come to terms with his present circumstances. He decides to swim his top score from back at the Olympics. But this battle defeats him. The film focuses on the question \"is a winner really a winner?\" == Cast == Andor Luk\u00e1ts Iv\u00e1n Kamar\u00e1s * Andor Luk\u00e1ts (old swimming coach and former Olympic swimming winner in 2014) * Iv\u00e1n Kamar\u00e1s (the young Olympic swimming winner in 1980) * Eszter F\u00f6ldes (his wife) * Simon Szemz\u0151 (Simon, child) * Tam\u00e1s Racsek (Tomi, child) * M\u00e1t\u00e9 Veczel (M\u00e1t\u00e9, child) * Adam Lux (doctor) * Gerg\u0151 Mikola (Ivan Popov, russian swimmer) * Askar Shalov (Mongolian Swimmer) * L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Zinner (politician) == Premiere and festival screenings == * _TV premiere_ : M1 (TV channel) - 30 August 2014 * _Budapest premiere_ : Cinema City MOM Park - 23 September 2014 *Hungarian Film Week - October 2014 *25.
