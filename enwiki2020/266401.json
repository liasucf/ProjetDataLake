His elder brother was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Monod. He was born in Copenhagen, where his father, Jean Monod (Sept. 5, 1765 \u2013 April 23, 1836; himself the eldest son of pastor Gaspard Jo\u00ebl Monod /1717-1782/ and his wife Suzanne Madeleine Puerari /1739-1799/),http://www.monodgraphies.eu/vie/vie%20familiale/parents/jean- monod_bio_en.html was a pastor of the French Reformed church and where Jean Monod met his wife and consequently Adolph's mother, Louise-Philippine de Coninck (1775-1851). Educated at Paris and Geneva, Adolph began his life-work in 1825 as founder and pastor of a Protestant church in Naples, moving to Lyon in 1827. Here his evangelical preaching, and especially a sermon on the duties of communicants (Qui doit communier?), led to his deposition by the Catholic Minister of education and religion. Instead of leaving Lyon he began to preach in a hall and then in a chapel. On 2 September 1829 he married Hannah Honyman (1799-1868)http://www.monodgraphies.eu/vie/vie%20familiale/hannah/hannah_en.html in Lyon. They had seven children, including pastor Andr\u00e9 John William Honyman Monod (1834\u20131916), philanthropist and feminist Alexandrine Elisabeth Sarah Monod (1836\u20131912), \u00c9milie Monod, Camille Monod (1843\u20131910). In 1836 he took a professorship in the theological college of Montauban, removing in 1847 to Paris as preacher at the Oratoire. He died in Paris on 6 April 1856.Adolphe Monod (1802-1856) data.bnf.fr. Monod was considered by some the foremost Protestant preacher of 19th-century France (e.g. Guillaume Guizot (1833-1892), son of the French statesman and Protestant historian Fran\u00e7ois Guizot (1787-1874)https://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/francois- guizot-1787-1874-2/ referred to him in an article published in the \u201cJournal des d\u00e9bats politiques et litt\u00e9raires\u201d (Journal of political and literary debates) on April 11, 1856, i.e. a few days after Adolphe Monod's funeral, as \"one of the foremost Christian speakers of his time.\"http://www.monodgraphies.eu/perception/guizot_en.html He published three volumes of sermons in 1830, another, La Cr\u00e9dulit\u00e9 de l'incr\u00e9dule in 1844, and two more in 1855. Two further volumes appeared after his death.
