    "text": "Steve McCarthy (born 30 July 1962 \u2013 30 June 2017) was a British former boxer who had been British light heavyweight champion in 1990. ==Career== Southampton local McCarthy began his professional career in February 1987 with a win over Russell Burnett. He was unbeaten in his first 10 fights, which included a win over Serg Fame in November 1988 to take the BBBofC Southern Area light heavyweight title at Applemore Recreation Centre, and a points victory over former Belgian Light Heavyweight and Cruiserweight championYves Monsieur. Highly rated and tipped for potential stardom, he suffered his first defeat in September 1989 to Tony Wilson in an eliminator for the English title at Southampton Guildhall, in one of boxing's most unusual fights. Entering the fight as the underdog against the former British Champion, McCarthy dominated the opening stanzas proceeding to knock Wilson down in the third round and was looking to finish the fight with Wilson pinned on the ropes. The fight was stopped when Wilson's 62-year-old mother climbed into the ring and started attacking McCarthy with her shoe, and Wilson's corner man also entered the ring. McCarthy believed he had won and left the ring, but bizarrely referee Adrian Morgan insisted that the fight should continue. McCarthy refused (the injury caused by Wilson's mother required four stitches) and Wilson was declared the winner by technical knockout.\"British Boxer's Mom Takes Bout Into Her Own Hands\", Jet, 16 October 1989, pp. 52-53.

McCarthy suffered his first defeat at the hands of another boxer in April 1992 when he was disqualified in the ninth round against German Olympic gold medallist Henry Maske in D\u00fcsseldorf. He also lost via disqualification to Dariusz Michalczewski in Hamburg in September that year.
