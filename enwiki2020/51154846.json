The imagery arises from a translation of an aphorism of the philosopher Democritus, \"Of truth we know nothing, for truth is in a well\". (Greek \u1f10\u03c4\u03b5\u1fc7 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f34\u03b4\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd: \u1f10\u03bd \u03b2\u03c5\u03b8\u1ff7 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f21 \u1f00\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, ete\u00eai d\u00e8 oud\u00e8n \u00eddmen: en buth\u00f4 g\u00e0r h\u0113 al\u1e17theia, [literally] \"in reality we know nothing; for the truth is in an abyss\".) The nudity of the model may arise from the expression la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 nue, \"the naked truth\". At the Champs Elys\u00e9es Salon of 1895, G\u00e9r\u00f4me showed a painting entitled Mendacibus et histrionibus occisa in puteo jacet alma Veritas (English: The nurturer Truth lies in a well, having been killed by liars and actors), in which he depicted \"naked Truth killed by Falsehood, her body flung into a well and the mirror after her, from which flashes of light are cast as it lightens the dark abyss\". At the next Salon in 1896, G\u00e9r\u00f4me showed Truth Coming Out of Her Well. It has been assumed that both paintings (like a similar, later work by \u00c9douard Debat-Ponsan) were comments on the Dreyfus affair, but art historian Bernard Tillier argues that G\u00e9r\u00f4me's images of Truth and the well were part of his ongoing diatribe against Impressionism.Bertrand Tillier.

In a preface for \u00c9mile Bayard's Le Nu Esth\u00e9tique published in 1902, G\u00e9r\u00f4me uses the metaphor of Truth and the well to characterize the profound and irreversible influence of photography: G\u00e9r\u00f4me kept a least one of the paintings. When he died in 1904, \"the maid found him dead in the little room next to his atelier, slumped in front of a portrait of Rembrandt and at the foot of his own painting, Truth\"\u2014but the source for this anecdote, the biographer Moreau-Vauthier, does not specify which painting of Truth. Since 1978, Truth Coming Out of Her Well has been part of the permanent exhibition at the Mus\u00e9e Anne de Beaujeu in Moulins, France. In 2012, after the painting traveled to Los Angeles, Paris and Madrid,As part of the touring exhibit The Spectacular Art of Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me. the museum featured the exhibition La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 est au mus\u00e9e (\"Truth is at the Museum\"), which collected numerous drawings, sketches, and variants made by G\u00e9r\u00f4me, and by other artists, relating to the painting and its theme. The multiple interpretations of the painting's enigmatic meaning prompted one of the museum's curators to say, \"C'est notre Joconde \u00e0 nous.\" (\"This is our Mona Lisa.\") File:G\u00e9r\u00f4me - La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 au fond d'un puits.jpg|Truth at the Bottom of a Well (study for a painting of 1895) by Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me, Mus\u00e9e Georges-Garret, Vesoul.
