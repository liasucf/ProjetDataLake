    "text": "Neg\u00fcbei was a khan of the Chagatai Khanate (1271-1272?). He was the son of Sarban. In 1271 Neg\u00fcbei was appointed by Kaidu as head of the Chagatai Khanate. A year after his enthronement, however, he rebelled against his master, possibly in conjunction with the revolts launched by the sons of Alghu and Baraq. Kaidu responded by sending an army against Neg\u00fcbei, and the latter was forced to flee to the east. Soon afterward, he was killed and subsequently replaced by Buqa Tem\u00fcr.
