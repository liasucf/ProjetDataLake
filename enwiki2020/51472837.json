    "text": "The 2018 CAF Confederation Cup (officially the 2018 Total CAF Confederation Cup for sponsorship reasons) was the 15th edition of Africa's secondary club football tournament organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), under the current CAF Confederation Cup title after the merger of CAF Cup and African Cup Winners' Cup. Raja Casablanca won the title for the first time, defeating AS Vita Club in the final, and earned the right to play against the winners of the 2018 CAF Champions League in the 2019 CAF Super Cup. TP Mazembe were the two-time defending champions, but as they qualified for the 2018 CAF Champions League and reached the group stage, they were not able to defend their title. ==Association team allocation== All 56 CAF member associations may enter the CAF Confederation Cup, with the 12 highest ranked associations according to their CAF 5-Year Ranking eligible to enter two teams in the competition. As a result, theoretically a maximum of 68 teams could enter the tournament (plus 16 teams eliminated from the CAF Champions League which enter the play-off round) \u2013 although this level has never been reached. For the 2018 CAF Confederation Cup, the CAF uses the 2012\u20132016 CAF 5-Year Ranking, which calculates points for each entrant association based on their clubs\u2019 performance over those 5 years in the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup. The criteria for points are the following: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !CAF Champions League !CAF Confederation Cup |- !Winners |5 points |4 points |- !Runners-up |4 points |3 points |- !Losing semi-finalists |3 points |2 points |- !3rd place in groups |2 points |1 point |- !4th place in groups |1 point |1 point |} The points are multiplied by a coefficient according to the year as follows: *2016 \u2013 5 *2015 \u2013 4 *2014 \u2013 3 *2013 \u2013 2 *2012 \u2013 1 ==Teams== The following 54 teams from 42 associations entered the competition. *Teams in bold received a bye to the first round. *The other teams entered the preliminary round. Associations are shown according to their 2012\u20132016 CAF 5-Year Ranking \u2013 those with a ranking score have their rank and score indicated. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Associations eligible to enter two teams (Ranked 1\u201312) |- !width=250|Association !width=200|Team !width=450|Qualifying method |- |rowspan=2| Egypt |Zamalek |2016\u201317 Egyptian Premier League third place |- |Al-Masry |2016\u201317 Egypt Cup runners-up |- |rowspan=2| Tunisia |Club Africain |2016\u201317 Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 third place |- |US Ben Guerdane |2016\u201317 Tunisian Cup runners-up |- |rowspan=2| DR Congo |DC Motema Pembe |2016\u201317 Linafoot third place |- |AS Maniema Union |2017 Coupe du Congo DR winners |- |rowspan=2| Algeria |USM Alger |2016\u201317 Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1 third place |- |CR Belouizdad |2016\u201317 Algerian Cup winners |- |rowspan=2| South Africa |Cape Town City |2016\u201317 South African Premier Division third place |- |SuperSport United |2016\u201317 Nedbank Cup winners |- |rowspan=2| Morocco |Raja Casablanca |2016\u201317 Botola third place |- |RS Berkane |2016\u201317 Botola fourth place |- |rowspan=2| Sudan |El-Hilal El-Obeid |2017 Sudan Premier League third place |- |Al-Ahly Shendi |2017 Sudan Cup winners |- |rowspan=2| Ivory Coast |AS Tanda |2016\u201317 C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Ligue 1 third place |- |Africa Sports |2017 Coupe de C\u00f4te d'Ivoire winners |- |rowspan=2| Zambia |Nkana |2017 Zambia Super League third place |- |Green Buffaloes |2017 Zambia Super League fourth place |- |rowspan=2| Congo |CARA Brazzaville |2017 Congo Ligue 1 third place |- |CS La Mancha |2017 Congo Ligue 1 fourth place |- |rowspan=2| Mali |Djoliba |2016 Malian Premi\u00e8re Division third place |- |Onze Cr\u00e9ateurs |2016 Malian Cup winners |- |rowspan=2| Nigeria |Enyimba |2017 Nigeria Professional Football League third place |- |Akwa United |2017 Nigerian FA Cup winners |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Associations eligible to enter one team |- !width=250|Association !width=200|Team !width=450|Qualifying method |- | Cameroon |New Star |2017 Cameroonian Cup winners |- | Libya |Al-Ittihad Tripoli |2017 Libyan Premier League CAF competition playoff runners-up |- | Ghana |Asante Kotoko |2017 Ghanaian FA Cup winners |- | Tanzania |Simba |2016\u201317 Tanzania FA Cup winners |- | Angola |Petro de Luanda |2017 Ta\u00e7a de Angola winners |- | Ethiopia |Welayta Dicha |2017 Ethiopian Cup winners |- | Benin |Energie |2017 Benin Premier League runners-up |- | Botswana |Jwaneng Galaxy |2016\u201317 Mascom Top 8 Cup winners |- | Burkina Faso |\u00c9toile Filante |2017 Coupe du Faso winners |- | Burundi |Olympique Star |2017 Burundian Cup winners |- | Comoros |Ngazi Sport |2017 Comoros Cup winners |- | Djibouti |Gendarmerie Nationale |2017 Djibouti Cup winners |- | Equatorial Guinea |Deportivo Niefang |2017 Equatoguinean Cup winners |- | Gabon |AS Mangasport |2016\u201317 Gabon Championnat National D1 runners-up |- | Gambia |Banjul Hawks |2017 Gambian Cup winners |- | Guinea |Hafia |2017 Guin\u00e9e Coupe Nationale winners |- | Kenya |AFC Leopards |2017 FKF President's Cup winners |- | Liberia |ELWA United |2017 Liberian Cup runners-up |- | Madagascar |Fosa Juniors |2017 Coupe de Madagascar winners |- | Malawi |Masters Security |2017 Malawi FAM Cup losing semi-finalists |- | Mauritania |FC Nouadhibou |2017 Coupe du Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique winners |- | Mauritius |AS Port-Louis 2000 |2017 Mauritian Cup winners |- | Mozambique |Costa do Sol |2017 Ta\u00e7a de Mo\u00e7ambique winners |- | Niger |Sahel |2017 Niger Cup winners |- | Rwanda |APR |2017 Rwandan Cup winners |- | Senegal |Mbour Petite-C\u00f4te |2017 Senegal FA Cup winners |- | Seychelles |Anse R\u00e9union |2017 Seychelles FA Cup runners-up |- | South Sudan |Al-Hilal Juba |2017 South Sudan National Cup runners-up |- | Swaziland |Young Buffaloes |2017 Swazi Cup winners |- | Zanzibar |Zimamoto |2016\u201317 Zanzibar Premier League runners-up |} ;Notes A further 16 teams eliminated from the 2018 CAF Champions League entered the play-off round. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Losers of 2018 CAF Champions League first round |- | Saint George | Zanaco | Williamsville AC | Aduana Stars |- | CF Mounana | MFM | G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Foot | Young Africans |- | Gor Mahia | Plateau United | Al-Hilal | ASEC Mimosas |- | UD Songo | AS Vita Club | Bidvest Wits | Rayon Sports |} ;Associations which did not enter a team * Cape Verde * Central African Republic * Chad * Eritrea * Guinea-Bissau * Lesotho * Namibia * R\u00e9union * S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe * Sierra Leone * Somalia * Togo * Uganda * Zimbabwe ==Schedule== The schedule of the competition was as follows (matches scheduled in midweek in italics).
