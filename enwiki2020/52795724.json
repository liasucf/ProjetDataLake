It has an area of . The park is in the caatinga biome. The Areia Vermelha is a sandbar that is uncovered only at low tide, separated from the sea by the line of reefs that protects the whole length of the Para\u00edba coastline. It is about from the Praia de Camboinha, a beach in Cabedelo. The sandbank attracts many visitors on the weekends who walk, swim and investigate the pools. It is surrounded by corals with typical fauna. ==History== The Areia Vermelha Marine State Park was created by state law 21.263 of 28 August 2000. It is administered by the Environmental Management Superintendence of Para\u00edba (Sudema). Studies prepared during development of the Management Plan showed serious degradation of the environment by intense and uncontrolled human activities and by practices incompatible with maintenance of the fauna and flora. On 12 November 2015 an agreement was made between the state and municipal government to better protect the park. As of January 2016 new rules were implemented that included prohibition of the sale of consumption of food and beverages in the park, and a ban on motor boats, carts, grills, tables and chairs. The food prohibition was because left-overs were attracting catfish, upsetting the delicate ecological balance of the reef. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * Category:State parks of Brazil Category:Protected areas established in 2000 Category:2000 establishments in Brazil Category:Protected areas of Para\u00edba ",
