As some of the other frigates of the 1970s and 1980s, they featured a COGOG (combined gas or gas) propulsion system with separate cruise and sprint gas turbines. Ten were built by de Schelde in Vlissingen and two by Wilton-Fijenoord in Schiedam between 1978 and 1982. Only 10 served with the Royal Netherlands Navy: two were sold to Greece while still under construction and replaced by two frigates which are basically an anti-air warfare (AAW) variant of the Kortenaer class. The Greek frigates were renamed the . Eight similar ships were built by Germany during the same period as the . == History== Authorised in the late 1960s, the 'Kortenaer' class was designed to replace older ASW vessels in service in the Dutch navy. Propulsion and machinery were based on gas turbines, giving the maneuverability and speed needed when hunting fast nuclear-powered Soviet submarines. These frigates did not receive substantial upgrades during their careers. ==Service== By 2003 all ships were transferred to the navies of Greece and the United Arab Emirates. In Dutch service the frigates were armed with a Goalkeeper CIWS placed on top of the helicopter hangar. In Greek service the Goalkeepers were replaced with Phalanx CIWS due to high maintenance costs. Both ships of the United Arab Emirates, Al Emirat and Abu Dhabi are being converted into a super luxury Giga yachts known as Swift 141 (launched as ) and Swift 135. Two ships, Elli and Limnos, were built for the Greek Navy in 1981, they are referred to as the Elli-class frigates by the Hellenic Navy and have different equipment and weapons from the Dutch ships. The Imperial Iranian Navy ordered eight modified ships from Royal Schelde but the contract was canceled after the Iranian Revolution. ==Ships in the class== The ships were named after Dutch captains and admirals: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" |- !
