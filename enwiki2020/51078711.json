    "text": "The Danish rock band Nephew has released six studio albums, three live albums, nine EPs, one compilation album, one box set, and nineteen singles. The band was formed in 1996 by Simon Kvamm, Kristian Riis, Jonas Juul Jeppesen, and S\u00f8ren Arnholt. In 1998, Jeppesen, who was until then the bassist in the band, left the band and was replaced by the current bassist Kasper Toustrup. That year, they proceeded to release two demo albums, Tunes and Things to Do; the demo Downtown Europe was released in 1999. In 2000, the band debuted with Swimming Time, on the small label Martian Records. The album was received well by both critics and fans, but despite the band's success, the members got bored and decided to take a break. During their 2001 farewell concert in Germany, the band rediscovered their passion for music and decided to stay together. After being signed to Copenhagen Records, the band released their second studio album USADSB in 2004, which was very well received and is seen as their \"breakthrough\" album. It gained double platinum status in Denmark, and aside from there has been released in Japan, Germany, and Norway. Later in 2004, the En Wannabe Darth Wader single release came to be, which contains both the Danish and English versions of Nephew's song \"En Wannabe Darth Vader\".https://www.discogs.com/Nephew-En-Wannabe-Darth-Vader/master/471276 October 2006 came the album Interkom Kom Ind, which received many positive reviews and has fared well commercially both in Denmark and other countries in Europe. It was certified 3x platinum. \"Igen & Igen &\" is its lead single. The Mexico Ligger i Spanien Remix EP was released later in 2007, which contains remixes of the song \"Mexico Ligger i Spanien\" by Mofus and Klovn, as well as an extended mix and a short intro version.https://www.discogs.com/Nephew- Mexico-Ligger-I-Spanien-Remix-EP/master/128486 In November 2007, Nephew released a live box set (Live-CD/2DVD) entitled Roskilde 07.07.07 based upon a much-acclaimed live performance at Orange Scene at the 2007 Roskilde Festival. The Live CD features songs from the albums USADSB and Interkom Kom Ind, including a special version of \"Hospital\" which features a guest performance by Danish rapper L.O.C.. The Special Edition of the box also includes the band's remix of the Timbaland track \"The Way I Are\". On the Danish constitution day in 2009, Nephew released their fourth studio album, Danmark/Denmark, which was certified 2x platinum. In 2010, the Police Bells & Church Sirens EP was released, containing a radio edit, a \"Dainty Doll's Trend Mix\", and \"Nephew's Nightlife Mix\" (mixed by Ren\u00e9 Munk Thalund of Nephew) of the song \"Police Bells & Church Sirens\". The EP also contains one previously unreleased track, \"Jesus Jesus\".https://www.discogs.com/Nephew-Police-Bells- Church-Sirens-EP/master/471275 In November 2012, Nephew released Hjertestarter, which went straight to the number one most sold album (in Denmark) that month and the Danish iTunes store. On 18 November 2013, Nephew released an album boxset, 1-2-3-4-5, as well as a compilation of singles, Igen & Igen &. 1-2-3-4-5 contains Nephew's five studio albums along with 15 bonus songs; early renditions of the songs \"USADSB\", \"Mexico Ligger i Spanien\", \"Hospital\", \"007 Is Also Gonna Die\", and \"Hjertestarter; a remix of \"Downtown Europe\" by \u00d8rtz/Mofus; an alternative version of \"Worst/Best Case Scenario\"; an early version of \"Superliga\"; the previously unreleased demo songs \"Swedenborg\" and \"Marking Princess\"; and premixes of the previously unreleased \"Pasfotografier\", \"Automatisk Mig\", \"Stop Nu Hj\u00e6lp Nu\", \"The Day I Laminate My Heart\", and \"Jeg Kan Se\". It also contains \"Statusopdaterer At Jeg Statusopdaterer\" featuring Johnson. Igen & Igen & is a collection of all of Nephew's singles currently released at that time. Nephew released their sixth studio album, Ring-i-Ring, on 27 September 2018. ==Albums== ===Studio albums=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:11em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak position ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:7em;\"| Certification |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"|DEN |- | Swimming Time | *Release date: 3 May 2000 *Record label: Martian Records *Re-released: 14 February 2005 *Record Label Copenhagen Records *Format: CD |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 15 | |- | USADSB | *Release date: 30 June 2004 *Record label: Copenhagen Records *Format: CD |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1 | *7\u00d7 Platinumhttp://www.ifpi.dk/certificeringer-0?page=1 |- | Interkom Kom Ind | *Release date: 6 October 2006 *Record label: Copenhagen Records *Format: LP, CD, download |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1 | *3\u00d7 Platinum |- | Danmark/Denmark | *Release date: 5 June 2009 *Record label: Copenhagen Records *Format: LP, CD, download |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1 | *2\u00d7 Platinum |- | Hjertestarter | *Release date: 2 November 2012 *Record label: Copenhagen Records *Format: LP, CD, download |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1 | *Platinum |- | Ring-i-Ring | *Release date: 27 September 2018 *Record label: Copenhagen Records *Format: LP, CD, download |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1 | |} ===Live albums=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:left;\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:2em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Album ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\"|DEN |- |2004 |USADSB 10 x s\u00e5 live |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- |2007 |Roskilde 07.07.07 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2 |- |2013 |Hjertestarter 10 x s\u00e5 live |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 25 |} ===Compilation albums=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:2em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Album ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"|DEN |- |rowspan=2|2013 |Greatest Hits - Igen & Igen & |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 8 |} ===Box sets=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:left;\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:2em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Album ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\"|DEN |- |rowspan=2|2013 |1-2-3-4-5 (Greatest Hits Box) |style=\"text-align:center;\"| 15 |} ===EPs=== *1998: Tunes (demo) *1998: Things to Do (demo) *1999: Downtown Europe (demo) *2007: Mexico Ligger i Spanien Remix EP *2010: Police Bells & Church Sirens EP *2018: Vinter-i-Ring *2018: For\u00e5r-i-Ring *2018: Sommer-i-Ring *2018: Efter\u00e5r-i-Ring ==Singles== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:2em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Single ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak position ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:7em;\"| Certification ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:7em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\"|DEN |- |2007 |\"Hospital\" feat.
