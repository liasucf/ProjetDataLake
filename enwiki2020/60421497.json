    "text": "Decolonization, also bacterial decolonization, is a medical intervention that attempts to rid a patient of an antimicrobial resistant pathogen, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or antifungal-resistant Candida. By pre-emptively treating patients who have become colonized with an antimicrobial resistant organism, the likelihood of the patient going on to develop life-threatening health care-associated infections is reduced. Common sites of bacterial colonization include the nasal passage, groin, oral cavity and skin. ==See also== *Antibiotic *Antifungal *Antiviral drug ==References== Category:Bacteria and humans ",
