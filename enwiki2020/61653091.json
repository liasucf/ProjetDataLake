    "text": "Novotorzhsky Uyezd was an administrative-territorial unit (uyezd) of the Tver Governorate as part of the Russian Empire and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The uyezd town was Torzhok. ==Geography== The county was located in the central part of the Tver Governorate. The area of the uyezd was 4,602.4 square versts. The surface of the uyezd was a flat hill, gradually descending from the northwest to the southeast. A branch of the Valdai Mountains enters the uyezd from the west, forming a marshy hill, from which the county river originates (Osuga, Big Kosh and others). The main river \u2013 Tvertsa, crosses the uyezd for 97 versts; the following fall into Tvertsa: Osuga (125 versts) with Poved (74 versts), Logovyazh (63 versts) and others. In the northeast along the border of the uyezd is Medveditsa (15 versts), in the south \u2013 Tma (25 versts), in the west \u2013 Bolshaya Kosha (25 versts), the last three flow into the Volga outside the uyezd. Only Tvertsa is navigable, rafting along all the named rivers, excluding Logovyazh. The riverbanks are densely populated: the city of Torzhok and 39 villages, with 35 thousand inhabitants, are located along Tvertsa; in Osuga \u2013 44 (7 thousand inhabitants), in the Poved \u2013 20 (3 thousand inhabitants), in the Logovyazh \u2013 23 (3 thousand inhabitants). Tsna and Bolshaya Kosha belong to the upper reaches of the uyezd and flow among the forests. There are two mills and several sawmills in Osuga. On the banks of Osugi, Poved, Logovyazh and Tma are good floodplains. ==History== The name of the county came from the ancient name of the city of Torzhok \u2013 Novyy Torg.

In 1708, the uyezd was assigned to the Ingermanland Governorate, in 1719 to the Tver Province of Saint Petersburg Governorate, in 1727 \u2013 to the Novgorod Governorate. In 1775 it became part of the Tver Viceroyalty, renamed in the governorate in 1796. After this, the borders of the uyezd did not change until March 1924, when part of the territory of the liquidated Staritsky Uyezd passed to it.
