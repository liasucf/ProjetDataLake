    "text": "\"Especially for You\" is a song performed by the Australian recording artists Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan, from Donovan's debut album Ten Good Reasons (1989). The song was released as his album's second single on 28 November 1988 and was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. \"Especially for You\" received many positive reviews from older and contemporary critics, who deemed it one of the strongest of each singer's album, but also dubbed the song a classic. The song had commercial success, reaching number one in the UK, Ireland, Greece and Belgium and peaking inside the Top 5 in countries including Australia, New Zealand, France, Finland and Switzerland. In 2015 the song was voted by the British public as the nation's 20th favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV. Kylie Minogue also performed this song as a duet with Kermit the Frog on the show An Audience with... Kylie Minogue in 2001. ==Background== Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan both appeared on the Australian TV series Neighbours but before they recorded the song, both left the series to concentrate on a music career. Kylie released the album Kylie, while Donovan was working on his studio album Ten Good Reasons. Both singers' production company Stock, Aitken & Waterman wrote a song for the singers so they could sing a duet on the track. The song was released as a single on 28 November 1988 but later was included on the American version of Kylie Minogue's second album, Enjoy Yourself. The single release came shortly after the UK broadcast of the Neighbours episode in which Kylie & Jason's characters, Charlene Mitchell and Scott Robinson, got married, and the singers were also a couple in real life at the time. In an interview with Sara Cox on BBC Radio 2 on Sounds of the 80s, broadcast 15 December 2017, Pete Waterman stated the original idea for the release of the duet between the two stars was suggested to the label by retail chain Woolworths who said they would order 250,000 copies of the record. The song has been included on the following compilations released by the singers: ; Kylie Minogue's compilations * Greatest Hits (1992) * Greatest Hits 1987\u20131999 (2003) * Greatest Hits 87\u201397 (2003) * Ultimate Kylie (2004) * Step Back In Time: The Definitive Collection (2019) ; Jason Donovan's compilations * Greatest Hits (1991) * Greatest Hits (2006) ==Chart performance== \"Especially for You\" debuted at number two in Australia and stayed at that position for four consecutive weeks.
