The championship was due to take place between April and August 2020, however, due to the coronavirus pandemic in Ireland new provincial draws and formats were adopted. The championship eventually began on 17 October 2020 and is scheduled to end in December 2020. Galway are the defending champions. ==Format changes== On 29 June 2020, the Munster Council announced that they were abandoning the round robin for one year and reverting to a straight knockout format. Kerry joined the championship for the first time since 2014. A day later, the Leinster Council also announced a new format and fixtures. The changes saw the adoption of a straight knockout format, while the championship was also spilt in two with the top 9 teams in the province participating. The four \"weakest\" teams contested the Leinster Minor B Championship. The All-Ireland quarter-final round robin was also abandoned, with the Leinster champions receiving a bye to the All-Ireland final, while the Munster champions will play Galway in a lone semi-final. ==Leinster Minor Hurling Championship== ===Fixtures/results=== ====Leinster round 1==== ====Leinster quarter-finals==== ====Leinster semi-finals==== ====Leinster final==== ==Munster Minor Hurling Championship== ===Fixtures/results=== ====Munster quarter-finals==== ====Munster semi-finals==== ====Munster final==== ==All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship== ===Fixtures=== ====All- Ireland semi-final==== ====All-Ireland final==== ==Championship statistics== ===Top scorers=== ;In a single game {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
