Strong's style merges genres such as documentary, animation and more traditional narrative driven storytelling. Her background is in photography, illustration, and media. She often works collaboratively, such as in her films Indigo and Mia. The themes of reclamation of Indigenous histories, lineages, languages and cultures often appear in her works. Strong is the founder of Spotted Fawn Productions, a production studio that provides mentorship and training opportunities for emerging and diverse artists. Strong engages with communities by curating, facilitating, programming, and teaching youth across Canada. As Strong has stated, \"Connecting with my Indigenous roots has allowed me to explore these personal themes in my work as well as my involvement with native and vulnerable youth\". She engages with Indigenous youth through her work with the Indigenous Routes Collective, a sustainable cross-cultural training program for Indigenous young people and the Media Creatorz Collective. == Personal life and education == She is from Vancouver, British Columbia, but grew up in Mississauga, Ontario and has lived in Toronto, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec.
