    "text": "Sudsy Malone's Rock 'n Roll Laundry & Bar was a music venue in the Corryville neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, across the street from Bogart's near the University of Cincinnati. John Cioffi was the owner. Cioffi opened other clubs including Sudsys in Louisville. The site often showcased many indie music and punk music bands. As the name suggests, the bar also housed a laundromat. The site had difficulty staying in business over the years, closing and reopening its doors several times, finally closing for good in 2008. In addition to the nightly shows by local and regional acts, many more established musicians and bands played the site, including Beck, Afghan Whigs, Guided By Voices, The White Stripes, Smashing Pumpkins, Morphine, Ass Ponys, Sleater-Kinney, Neutral Milk Hotel, Modest Mouse, Over the Rhine, Rigor Mortis, Betty Blowtorch, Vains of Jenna, and many other up-and-coming bands of the punk/grunge/alternative music scene of the late 1980s and 1990s.Sleater-Kinney SetlistsJake Grieco, \"Allman Brothers, Grateful Dead, Nirvana in Clifton\", The News Record, February 4, 2014 In the fall of 2020, the former Sudsy's was demolished. ==References== ==Further reading== * Albert Pyle, \"Saturday at Sudsy Malone's: A Lot of Noise, A Jug of Tide and Thou,\" Cincinnati Magazine, August 1987, pp. 40\u201341. * Steven Rosen, \"Sudsy Malone's: The Leader of the Laundromats,\" Cincinnati Enquirer, Sept. 28, 1986, pp. 28, 30. * * Andrew Risch, \"Cincinnati\u2019s Rock \u2018n Roll Laundromat: Sudsy Malone\u2019s CincyMusic, Category:Defunct companies based in Cincinnati Category:Former laundry buildings Category:Music venues in Cincinnati Category:Nightclubs in the United States ",
