    "text": "James White (10 April 1922 Glasgow \u2013 19 February 2009) was a British Labour Party politician. White was Member of Parliament for Glasgow Pollok from 1970 to 1987, when he retired. He served in the Eighth Army under Field Marshal Montgomery during World War II. White was solidly anti-abortion and devoted many efforts to limiting it; for example, sponsoring legislation to tighten the restrictions on the Abortion Act 1967. In 1975 White introduced a bill in parliament to make abortion more difficult. A demonstration was arranged to protest at his proposed restriction to the then legal access to abortion. This demonstration led to the formation of National Abortion Campaign. He died on 19 February 2009 and was survived by his daughters, Ann and Doris and son Jim. == References == * The Times Guide to the House of Commons, Times Newspapers Ltd, 1983 * == External links == * Category:1922 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Scottish Labour Party MPs Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Glasgow constituencies ",
