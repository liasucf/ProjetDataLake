His great-grandfather \u2013 the gadyatsky colonel Stepan Troshchinsky \u2013 was the nephew of hetman Ivan Mazepa. Dmitry's father, Prokofy Troshchinsky, was a Bunchuk comrade in the Hetman country. At the end of the course at the Kiev Academy, Dmitry Troshchinsky joined the Little Russian Collegium. He received the rank of regimental clerk in 1773. Being sent to Moldavia at the disposal of Prince Nikolai Repnin, Troshchinsky soon attracted the attention of the prince, who did not part with him until 1787, by his industriousness and efficiency. This year, Catherine II took a trip to the Crimea; she was accompanied by Count Alexander Bezborodko. Prince Repnin recommended to him Troshchinsky, as a reliable and experienced official. In 1793, Troshchinsky was appointed a member of the Main Post Office and elevated to the rank of Secretary of State. This gave him the opportunity to attract the attention of Catherine II. In 1796, he received from the empress the town of Kagarlyk in the Kiev Governorate, the entire Kagarlyk village headquarters, as well as two village headquarters in the Podolsk Governorate. Troshchinsky accompanied emperor Paul I to Moscow for the coronation and was appointed senator and present in the council established at the educational society of noble maidens. In 1800, he was dismissed from all posts and (according to Nathan Eidelman) took part in a conspiracy against Paul I. After the coup of 1801, he was reinstated in all posts and appointed by Emperor Alexander I a member of the Permanent State Council and head of the Postal Directorate of the empire, and when the ministries were established, he became the Minister of Allotments. Troshchinsky is also known for the fact that he wrote the famous manifesto on the accession to the throne of Alexander I, in which the tsar abdicated the policies of Paul I and solemnly vowed \"to rule by God, as the people handed over to us according to the laws and in the heart of God, the honourable grandmother of our sovereign Empress Catherine the Great\".

The Poltava nobility chose him as the provincial marshal. From 1814 to 1817, Troshchinsky was the Minister of Justice. Having retired, he remained in Saint Petersburg for about five years, and then moved to Kibintsy, where he gathered the local landowners. Among the latter were the Gogol\u2013Yanovsky family, the relatives of Troshchinsky by brother. Thanks to Troshchinsky, Nikolai Gogol was enrolled in the Nizhyn gymnasium. He had extensive possessions in the Poltava Region, the Kiev Region, in Podolia and the Voronezh Province (over 70,000 dessiatins). In last years, Troshchinsky lived in his Khorbintsy estate in Mirgorod. He was a friend and patron of many Ukrainian writers and artists, in particular Vasily Kapnist, Pavel Koropchevsky, Miklashevsky, Yakov Markevich, Vasily Lomikovsky, Vasily Gogol, Vladimir Borovikovsky, Artemy Vedel. Through his friend Osip Kamenetsky, Troshchinsky was one of the initiators of the first edition of the Aeneid by Ivan Kotlyarevsky (1798). In Kibintsy, Troshchinsky had a home theater, which he directed from 1812 with the help of Vasily Kapnist and Vasily Gogol- Yanovsky. Troshchinsky collected a rich library, sold in parts after his death in different hands. He died of \"dropsy in the chest\" on February 26, 1829 in Kibintsy, leaving a very significant condition: 6 thousand souls of serfs, a house in Petersburg and Kiev, movable property worth about 1 million rubles.Russian Antiquity. 1882.

Their daughter Praskovya Ivanovna (1804\u20131829) became the wife (1827) of Major General Baron Stanislav Karlovich Osten-Saken (1789\u20131863). According to a contemporary, Troshchinsky \"loved her granddaughter dearly, meanwhile, she was completely convinced that she was his only heiress and eagerly expected what her fate would be decided. When reading the spiritual, the old man called her a pupil and left her 800 souls in the Kiev province. This news struck her so much that she fell ill, soon gave birth, and died three weeks after the death of Troshchinsky, leaving her husband and little orphan daughter\",Sophia Kapnist\u2013Skalon.
