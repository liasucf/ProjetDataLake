Her work appeared in anarchist journals, such as A Lanterna, El Libertario, A Voz da Uni\u00e3o, A Plebe, and A Voz dos Gar\u00e7ons. ==Biography== Soares was an anarchist writer and promoter of Brazilian feminist anarchism during the 20th century. She lived in Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo from 1910-1914 with her family, where she was introduced to anarchism, partly influenced by her brother Florentino de Carvalho (n\u00e9 Primitivo Raimundo Soares) and partly influenced by her stepmother Paula Soares. She worked as an embroiderer. In 1914, she returned to S\u00e3o Paulo, living on Calle Bresser in the Br\u00e1s neighborhood. Here, she actively participated in local anarchist organizations. She began by helping her brother produce and distribute the newspaper, Germinal-La Barricata, which was published in Portuguese and Italian. Then, she taught in libertarian schools, one on Avenida Celso Garcia, and another on Rua de Oriente. Her first article for the anarchist press, \"A Guerra\" was published in the newspaper A Lanterna, edited by Edgard Leuenroth. She collaborated with the newspaper A Voz da Uni\u00e3o, produced by Souza Passos, and the newspaper A Voz dos Gar\u00e7ons, edited by Nicolau Parada. She also wrote for \"A Plebe\" and the magazine Phrometeu, edited by her nephew, Ars\u00eanio Palacio, and O Libert\u00e1rio, published by Pedro Catal\u00f3 in the 1960s. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Angelina also helped found and manage for the Centro Femenino de Educaci\u00f3n (Women's Center of Education). In 1923, the Soares family traveled to Rio de Janeiro and took up residence on Rua Maria Jose in the Penha barrio. In Rio, Soares and her sisters Matilde, Antonia, and Pilar formed Grupo Renova\u00e7\u00e3o e M\u00fasica. She died in Rio de Janeiro in 1985. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Brazilian feminist writers Category:Brazilian anarchists Category:Brazilian non-fiction writers Category:20th-century Brazilian women writers Category:20th-century non- fiction writers ",
