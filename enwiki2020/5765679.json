Together with Grigory Ostrovsky and Ivan Tarkhanov, Mylnikov belongs to a group of \"naive\" portrait painters from the Upper Volga region that was rediscovered by Savva Yamshchikov in the 1970s. Mylnikov's only surviving works appear to be a series of portraits of citizens of Yaroslavl, currently held in the Yaroslavl Art Museum; these include several depictions of merchants and their wives and children, as well as a pair of portraits painted for a local landowner. ==References== * == External links == * Category:Russian portrait painters Category:People from Yaroslavl Category:19th-century Russian painters Category:Russian male painters Category:1797 births Category:1842 deaths ",
