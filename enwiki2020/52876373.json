    "text": "OpenNIC (also referred to as the OpenNIC Project) is a user-owned and -controlled Alt URL top-level Network Information Center that offers a non- national alternative to traditional Top-Level Domain (TLD) registries such as ICANN. As of January 2017, OpenNIC recognizes and peers all existing ICANN TLDs, for compatibility reasons. However, OpenNIC has not yet evaluated and does not hold a formal position on future ICANN TLDs. In addition to resolving hostnames in the ICANN root, OpenNIC also resolves hostnames in OpenNIC- operated namespaces, as well as within namespaces with which peering agreements have been established. Some OpenNIC recursive servers (Tier 2 servers) are known for their high speeds and low latency, relative to other more widely used DNS recursors, as well as their anonymizing or no-logging policies. Many servers offer DNSCrypt. Tier 2 servers are operated by community volunteers across a multitude of geographic locations. Like all alternative root DNS systems, OpenNIC-hosted domains are unreachable to the vast majority of Internet users, because they require a non-default configuration in one's DNS resolver. == History == On June 1, 2000, an article was posted on kuro5hin.org advocating a democratically governed domain name system. Alt URL The first OpenNIC servers went into operation July of that year. == OpenNIC TLDs == === OpenNIC namespaces === These TLDs are currently served by OpenNIC and were constructed with the approval of the OpenNIC community. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Intended use !Date introduced !Restrictions !Notes !Status |- |.bbs |Bulletin Board System servers, and related BBS websites and services. |2000-12-29 |Domain must provide BBS type services. | | |- |.chan |A Top Level Domain \"for imageboards and communities related to imageboard culture.\" |2015-10-21 | | | |- |.cyb |Cyberpunk-related content. |2017-08-14 | | | |- |.dyn |Dynamic DNS pointers. |2014-05-30 |Only A, AAAA, RP and TXT records can be modified. |Unused domains are removed after 28 days. | |- |.epic |General purpose domain for anything of an \"epic\" nature. |2019-09-03 | | | |- |.free |Organizations that encourage the Non-Commercial use of the Free Internet. | |Non-Commercial use only.

Currently they provide .ku (Kurdish people), .te (Tamil Eelam), .ti (Tibet), and .uu (Uyghur people). ==== FurNIC ==== FurNIC aims to bring a unique identity to Furries, Furry Fandom, and other Anthropomorphic interest websites across the internet. FurNIC and OpenNIC work closely, with .fur (Furry fandom) generally being treated as part of OpenNIC for most purposes, rather than a separate peer entity. ==== Emercoin ==== On January 15, 2015, domains registered in Emercoin's blockchain became accessible to all users of OpenNIC DNS. Emercoin DNS supports the domain zones .coin, .emc, .lib and .bazar. However, Emercoin DNS records can be registered/maintained from within the Emercoin software, and not as part of OpenNIC's management system. === Technical zones === OpenNIC operates some special-use TLDs, which are meant for technical or organizational purposes. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Intended use !Restrictions !Notes !Status |- |.opennic.glue |Provides hostnames for Tier 1 DNS servers and organizational websites and services. |Domains cannot be registered.

Domains are automatically created upon the approval of a Tier 2 server. |Example: \"ns1.any.dns.opennic.glue\" | |} === Suspended peering === ==== Namecoin ==== In July 2019 the OpenNIC community voted 13-2 for dropping support for .bit domains due to them \"being used as malware hubs\" as a result of their \"anonymous nature\". A similar proposal was made in December 2018 but it did not reach the voting stage. Until then OpenNIC resolved .bit (Namecoin) domains through the use of a centralized server which generated a DNS zone from the Namecoin blockchain. Access was provided through a Tier 1 server which bridges the OpenNIC system and Namecoin. Some OpenNIC DNS servers made use of a Spamhaus-maintained blacklist of malicious .bit domains.https://wiki.opennic.org/api/blacklisthttps://lists.opennicproject.org/sympa/arc/discuss/2017-08/msg00019.htmlhttps://api.opennicproject.org/acl/filter/ == See also == * ICANN * Namecoin * Open Root Server Network * Public recursive name servers ** OpenDNS ** Google Public DNS ** CloudFlare Public DNS == References == == External links == * Category:Domain Name System Category:Alternative Internet DNS services ",
