It is a two-story masonry structure, built of brick an terra cotta. The front facade is symmetrical, with ornately decorated elements rising to a parapet. It was built in 1921 to house the headquarters of the state chapter of the Mosaic Templars of America, an African-American fraternal society founded by former slaves after the American Civil War. The building was part of a complex which originally included three buildings, one of which was the organization's national headquarters; the other two buildings were destroyed by fire.
