A ruckman, Ishchenko was born in Perth W.A. and made his VFL debut in 1987 with the inaugural West Coast side. After two seasons at the club he moved to Brisbane and played with the Bears before finishing his career at North Melbourne. He is a part-time ruck coach for North Melbourne in the AFL. His nickname is \"The Russian\" and this has led to the confusion about his place of birth, and potential racial vilification by those using that name. His father was born in Ukraine and is of Ukrainian ancestry.
