The species is widely cultivated and is reportedly naturalized in Guinea, the Maldive Islands, Mauritius, R\u00e9union, Java, the Cook Islands, Chiapas, Central America, and the Caribbean. ==Description== It is a scrambling deciduous shrub growing to 2\u20134 m tall. The leaves are opposite, 5\u201312 cm long, pinnate with 5\u201311 leaflets. The flowers are produced in open cymes, the individual flowers are white having corolla with a basal tube 13\u201325 mm long and five lobes 13\u201322 mm long.Flora of China v 15 p 313: Jasminum grandiflorum The flower's fragrance is unique and sweet. ==Subspecies== Two subspecies are recognized: *Jasminum grandiflorum subsp. floribundum (R.Br. ex Fresen.)

Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiete der Beschreibenden Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Frankfurt am Main 2: 16. \\- African and Arabian portions of natural range *Jasminum grandiflorum subsp. grandiflorum - South Asian plants as well as cultivars and naturalized populations ==Uses== In India, its leaves are widely used as an Ayurvedic herbal medicine and its flowers are used to adorn the coiffure of women. In Pakistan, it grows wild in the Salt Range and Rawalpindi District at 500\u20131500 m altitude.Flora of Pakistan: Jasminum grandiflorum It is closely related to, and sometimes treated as merely a form of, Jasminum officinale.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . The plant is known as \"saman pichcha\" or \"pichcha\" in Sri Lanka. Buddhist and Hindu temples use these flowers in abundance. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm temperate and subtropical regions. By method of solvent extraction the Jasmine flowers are converted into Jasmine Concrete and Jasmine Oleoresin (sold as Jasmine Absolute). Both products have a huge demand in the fragrance industry. Methyl jasmonate isolated from the jasmine oil of Jasinum gradiflorum led to the discovery of the molecular structure of the jasmonate plant hormones. Jasminum grandiflorum ==Etymology== 'Jasminum' is a Latinized form of the Persian word, 'yasmin' for sweetly scented plants.Gledhill, David (2008). \"The Names of Plants\".
