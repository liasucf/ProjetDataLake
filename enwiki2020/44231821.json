When the time came to choose high schools, instead of going to Seih\u014d High School, a known baseball powerhouse in Nagasaki, he opted to go to Hasami High School instead, for the reason that he wanted to reach the Koshien using his own abilities. During his junior year, his team joined the 83rd Spring Koshien, where they defeated Yokohama High School in the first round (score: 5-1), but were eliminated when they lost to Hy\u014dgo Prefecture's Kakogawa Kita Kout\u014d High in the next (0-2).\u30c7\u30a4\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4 2011\u5e7410\u670828\u65e5\u53f7 12\u7248B The next summer, his team also participated in the Summer Koshien but were again eliminated in the second round by Seiryo High (1-5). ==Hanshin Tigers== In October 27, 2011, he was chosen as the Hanshin Tigers 5th pick in the annual autumn baseball draft.

He debuted during the July 13 match with the BayStars in Koshien, where he pitched one shutout inning in relief. Since then, he pitched 18 scoreless innings in 17 appearances without surrendering an earned run, until Hisayoshi Chono hit a walk-off homer from him on the 10th inning of the August 29 game.

Even after his first earned run, he managed to maintain an ERA below 1.0, until he gave away 5 more, 3 of which were home runs, in the 2/3 inning that he pitched in September 8. He was taken off the active roster afterwards, but was registered again on the 21st.

He only appeared in 6 games during the season, but helped the Tigers sweep the Giants by pitching 2 shutout innings in relief in games 3 & 4 of the Climax Series. 2015 He started the year with a blast when he pitched in relief during the season opener with the Dragons.
