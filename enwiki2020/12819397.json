    "text": "Minmi is an outer western suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, located from Newcastle's central business district. It is part of the City of Newcastle local government area. Minmi was an important coal mining centre in the second half of the nineteenth century, particularly under the ownership and management of J & A Brown. Minmi's mines were connected by a private railway line across the Hexham Swamp to J & A Brown's loading facilities on the Hunter River at Hexham. J & A Brown's engineering workshops were also located at Hexham. ==History== === Pre-European Colonisation === Prior to white settlement, the area of present-day Minmi was home to the Pambalong people for approximately 40,000 years. The Pambalong people were thought to be a sub-tribe of the Lake Macquarie Awabakal nation. Pambalong territory extended from the south bank of the Hunter River, west to Tarro and the foothills of the Sugarloaf Range and south to Lake Macquarie. By 1893 there was no trace of the Pambalong people in the Minmi district. === Timeline === The following information is largely taken from a sign in Minmi Park (see photo in image gallery below). 1835 \u2013 Coal discovered by Harry Styles. 1848 \u2013 First coal mines opened by William Robson and the Turner Brothers. 1850s \u2013 Coal mining by Eales and Brown Brothers. 1860s \u2013 J & A Brown acquire all land and mining rights in Minmi. 1861 \u2013 Public education begins.
