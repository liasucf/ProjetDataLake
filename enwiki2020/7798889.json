According to art critic Coline Milliard, Donkor's works are \"\"genuine cornucopias of interwoven reference: to Western art, social and political events, and to the artist's own biography\".Coline Milliard, \"Kimathi Donkor - 'Queens of the Undead'\" (review), Blouinartinfo, 2 November 2012. ==Early life and education== Donkor was born in Bournemouth, England, in 1965.Agnaldo Farias; Moacir dos Anjos; Adrian Piper; et al. 29th Bienal de S\u00e3o Paulo catalogue: there is always a cup of sea to sail in. S\u00e3o Paulo: Fundac\u0326\u00e3o Bienal de S\u00e3o Paulo, 2010. ; . He has said of his background: \"I was born in the UK to an Anglo-Jewish mother and Ghanaian father, but was raised by my adopted parents who were from Jamaica and the UK. We lived for a time in Zambia, Central Africa, where my adopted dad worked as a vet. I finished my schooling in the west of England, then moved to London, where I eventually settled. In the meantime, my adopted parents had divorced and remarried, so the family diversity actually increased, as Zambians also joined the party. This sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord life induced an early sense of the wondrous, and sometimes maddening, complexity of identities and histories, which, I think, has been reflected in my artworks. Precisely because I was such an intimate witness to the multiple crossings and re-crossings of stories, images and journeys from around the world.\"Philip Kaisary, \"An interview with Kimathi Donkor\", Lacuna Magazine, 18 February 2015. Donkor received an Art Foundation Diploma from Bournemouth and Poole College of Arts followed by a BA (Hons) degree in fine art from Goldsmiths College, University of London, and a master's degree in fine art at Camberwell College of Arts.Yvette Gresl\u00e9, \"Kimathi Donkor: \u2018Daddy, I want to be a black artist\u2019 @ Peckham Space\", FAD, 3 October 2013.

His history paintings \"fearlessly tackle key, dramatic, monumental moments of African diaspora history ... with a painterly preciseness that borders on aesthetic frugality\", according to art historian Eddie Chambers.Eddie Chambers (2013): \"Reading the Riot Act\", Visual Culture in Britain, Volume 14, Issue 2, 2013. DOI:10.1080/14714787.2013.782156. In 2005, Time Out magazine reported that officers from London's Metropolitan Police had entered the Bettie Morton Gallery to demand the removal of one the artist's paintings, Helping With Enquiries (1984), from his solo exhibition Fall/Uprising (which addressed policing controversies). Gallery staff refused to comply and police later issued a statement that \"no further action\" would be taken against the painter.Rebecca Taylor, \"Brixton Gallery raided by Met\", Time Out, 9\u201316 November 2005, p. 16.

Caroline Menezes suggested that Donkor's work, \"articulates a hidden history, tales of the past and chronicles of suppressed voices\", with figures such as Nanny of the Maroons, Nzinga Mbande, Stephen Lawrence, Joy Gardner, Toussaint L'OuvertureDerek Turner (2013): \"Modernity in a medieval city\", Quarterly Review, 17 January 2014. and Jean Charles de Menezes among the subjects addressed.Annie Ridout, \"Queens of the Undead \u2013 Black history brought up to date\", Hackney Citizen, 1 October 2012. Writing about his 2013, London solo show, Daddy, I want to be a black artist, Yvette Gresl\u00e9 proposed Donkor as \u201cone of the most significant figurative painters, of his generation, working in the United Kingdom today\u201d.
