The entire highway is part of the National Highway system: in the Northern Territory it is assigned National Route 66; the Queensland portion is designated as National Route A2. An upgrade of the Queensland section of the highway between Mount Isa and Camooweal was completed in 2008 and despite floods of 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Queensland sections of road were in good condition (as of 2015). The Northern Territory section has a speed limit of 130 km per hour along most of its length. It is the main transport route between Queensland and the Northern Territory, consequently many road trains use it.
