She was designed by Sir John Henslow as one of the large class 74-gun ships, and was the only ship built to her draught. Unlike the middling and common class 74-gun ships, which carried 18-pounder long guns, as a large 74-gun ship, Courageux carried 24-pounders on her upper gun deck. At the end of January 1801, a French squadron under Admiral Honor\u00e9 Ganteaume comprising seven ships-of-the-line and two frigates, and carrying 5,000 troops, escaped from the port of Brest. It was spotted on 27 January by a British frigate which conveyed the news to Plymouth on 3 February. Believing its destination to be the West Indies, a similar sized force, under Sir Robert Calder was sent in pursuit. As one of the fastest two- deckers available at the time, Courageux was selected to take part in this unnecessary expedition.Clowes p. 449 On 1 January 1804 a convoy of leaving Portsmouth for the West Indies.

In mid-1804, Courageaux escorted a convoy from St Helena back to Britain. The convoy consisted of the East Indiamen City of London, Ceylon, Calcutta, and Wyndham, two vessels from the South Seas, Lively and Vulture, and the ship Rolla, which had transported convicts to New South Wales.The Times, 12 October 1804. On the way the convoy ran into severe weather with the result that Prince of Wales, which had also left St Helena with the rest, foundered with the loss of all on board; this had been her maiden voyage.National Archives: Prince of Wales (8) - accessed 31 July 2015. In 1806 and 1807 Courageux is known to have been under the command of James Bissett.Commissioned Sea Officers of the Royal Navy, David Bonner Smith Shortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812, on 12 August, Courageaux shared in the seizure of several American vessels: Cuba, Caliban, Edward, Galen, Halcyon, and Cygnet. ==Fate== Courageux was placed on harbour service in 1814, and was broken up in 1832. ==Notes, citations, and references== ;Notes ;Citations ;References * *Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650\u20131850.
