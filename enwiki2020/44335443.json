After adding their friends Sean Humphrey and Jordan Modro to the mix, the band knew this was the final lineup. Here on January 4, 2011 in Dallas, Texas, Avion Roe was formed. Our band started on Jan 4th, 2011. We had thought we would be a five piece band but when we flew Jordan down to try out we knew we had it. We were immediately four brothers. We released our full length record in spring and jumped on the Vans Warped Tour. We shot a music video for our first single \u2018Who I Am\u2026\u2019 and then jumped on a national tour with Madina Lake and Me Talk Pretty. We have had two songs on MTV and are shooting our second music video next week. This band is only beginning to unfold. Avion Roe were the first independent artist to release a 3D Music Video. The video was recorded for their song called 'The Escape'. It was released on October 1, 2013. === The Art of Fiction (2011\u201314) === Avion Roe's debut album \"The Art of Fiction\" was released on May 3, 2011, which only took four months to make after the band formed in early January of the same year. The album has an emo, emo pop and post-hardcore sound to it such as bands like Escape The Fate, Taking Back Sunday and The Used. The most popular song on the album is their debut song Who I Am\u2026 (which now has over 2 million views on the music video) but songs such as The Difference Between Us and I'm Not Afraid To Die received popularity by their fans as well. === Into The Rest and In Separation (2015\u2013present) === Avion Roe released \"Into The Rest - Single\" which features Kellin Quinn of Sleeping with Sirens on September 25, 2015.
