Marc Buxton of Den of Geek expressed that despite failing to produce a new ongoing which it was trying to lead into the series still stands out as a highlight of 1990s Marvel. ==Prints== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | Number | Title | Cover date | Comic Book Roundup rating | Estimated sales (first month) |- | #1 | Hell Hath No Fury, Part One: Cherchez La Femme | April 1995 | | 25.8 thousand, ranked 84th in North America |- | #2 | Hell Hath No Fury, Part Two: Stop in the Name of Love | May 1995 | | 23.1 thousand, ranked 153th in North America |- | #3 | Hell Hath No Fury, Part Three: Stand By Your Man | June 1995 | | 20.0 thousand, ranked 173th in North America |- | #4 | Town without Pity | July 1995 | | 20.94 thousand, ranked 189th in North America |} ==See also== * 1995 in comics ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1995 comics debuts Category:1995 comics endings Category:Nick Fury titles Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. titles Category:Comics by Howard Chaykin ",
