    "text": "The 11th Hour with Brian Williams is a one-hour nightly news and politics television program airing weeknights at 11:00 pm ET on MSNBC that premiered on September 6, 2016, as the network's flagship evening newscast. It is hosted by Brian Williams, the network's chief anchor and former host of NBC Nightly News. == History == The show launched on September 6, 2016, as a temporary program wrapping up the election news of the day, while previewing stories that will be top-ticket news items the next morning. It replaced a rerun of All In with Chris Hayes. The program is Williams' second show in MSNBC's primetime schedule, as he formerly hosted The News with Brian Williams, which aired on the network from 1996 to 2002 before moving to CNBC. Originally the program was Monday to Thursday only, and despite its name, aired for only a half hour, which some commenters considered ironic given Williams's removal from NBC Nightly News for embellishing a speech about his experience during the Iraq War. The last half hour of Hardball aired following the half hour program. At times the program was extended due to breaking news coverage. The program expanded to Friday nights in January and on March 20, 2017 was extended to one hour daily. On April 13, 2017 MSNBC officially extended the program to an hour long. The program primarily features interviews with reporters covering the major stories of the evening, panels composed of former government officials and subject matter experts, and the occasional politician. Williams eschews the conflict-ridden panels of competing opinion shows. Interviews with newsmakers are either live or to tape as close to air time as possible, to maintain immediacy. Similar to the original Nightline which focused on the Iran hostage crisis, the program focuses primarily on the actions of the presidency of Donald Trump and Williams leads each broadcast noting the number of days of the Trump presidency. After the 2016 election, the program continued to air despite its initial billing as a temporary program. In February 2019, the New York Post labeled the show as a \"legit hit,\" noting it had been \"beating CNN and Fox News for three months straight.\" NBC News contributors Nicolle Wallace and Eugene Robinson provided commentary on most of the 2016 editions. Wallace also served as a substitute anchor in Williams' absence. Wallace's duties on the program resulted in her hosting her own show, Deadline: White House. ==References== Category:2016 American television series debuts Category:2010s American television news shows Category:2020s American television news shows Category:English-language television shows Category:MSNBC original programming Category:Flagship evening news shows ",
