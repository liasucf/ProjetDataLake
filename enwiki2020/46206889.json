    "text": "The Lyth Valley looking north towards the Cumbrian Mountains. The Lyth Valley is on the edge of the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England. It gives its name to an electoral ward (one of 45 in South Lakeland). The valley is sheltered by limestone hills and enjoys a relatively mild micro-climate for northern England. It is noted for its damson orchards. Lyth Valley from Helsington Barrows ==Literary associations== *Mrs Humphrey Ward in her Helbeck of Bannisdale celebrated the valley in springtime, with its \u201cmists of fruit blossoms. For the damson trees were all out, patterning the valleys\u201d.Quoted in G. Lindop, A Literary Guide to the Lake District (London 1993) p. 20 *Margot Robert Adamson, the Scottish Renaissance poet, wrote of this \u201cWide silent valley/Beneath whose scree-faced hill the sea birds call\u201d.Quoted in G. Lindop, A Literary Guide to the Lake District (London 1993) p. 20 *Alfred Wainwright maintained that \u201cThe supreme joy of the Lyth valley is its annual springtime renewal\u201d, with damson blossom \u201cappearing as white puffs of smoke all over the valley\u201d.A. Wainwright, Wainwright in the Valleys of Lakeland (London 1996) p. 73 ==Drainage== The flat bottom of the valley was originally bog, but it has been drained for the benefit of farmers. In recent years there has been controversy about the cost of the pumps which keep the valley drained. For some years the pumping has been funded by the Environment Agency, but the Agency decided that there were more significant rpobelms in the area. The creation of an Internal drainage board has been discussed as an alternative. The Agency committed itself to keeping the pumping stations in operation until 2020 to allow more time for a decision on how water level management would to be organised in future. ===Ecological implications=== There have been objections from environmentalists to a drainage regime which does not take account of the valley's contribution to biodiversity. It is argued that a less intensive drainage scheme would benefit wildlife, and still allow farming or paludiculture. ==References== Category:Valleys of Cumbria Category:Wards of Cumbria ",
