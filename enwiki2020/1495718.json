    "text": "Selfportrait of Richard Peter Richard Peter (* 10. May 1895 in Klein Jenkwitz; \u2020 3. October 1977 in Dresden) was a German press photographer and photojournalist. He is best known for his photographs of Dresden just after the end of World War II. Richard Peter was born and raised in Klein Jenkwitz, Silesia, working as a smith and a miner while dabbling in photography. He was drafted into the German army in 1914 to serve in World War I. After the war he settled in Halle and later in Dresden. He joined the labor movement and the Communist Party of Germany. During the 1920s and early 1930s he published his photographs in various left-wing publications. Because of this he was promptly barred from working as a press photographer when the Nazi Party rose to power in 1933. During the Third Reich he worked in advertising, before being drafted again to serve in World War II. Peter returned to Dresden in September 1945 to find the city destroyed after the bombing of Dresden in February 1945. His personal archive and equipment had been completely destroyed in the raids. Starting over with borrowed equipment, he began to document the damage to the city and the beginnings of its reconstruction. His photographs were published in 1949 in a volume called Dresden, eine Kamera klagt an (\"Dresden, a photographic accusation\", ). In 1949 Peter was expelled from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the successor of the Communist Party, when he investigated corrupt party officials. He continued to work as a freelance art photographer in Dresden until his death in 1977, and eventually won some international recognition for his work. Peter's more than 5,000 negatives and prints were acquired by the Saxon State Library in 1983. ==Gallery== File:Fotothek df ps 0000180 Abseil\u00fcbung am Zirkelstein.jpg|Abseiling at the Zirkelstein File:Fotothek df ps 0000106 Blick vom Turm des Neuen Rathauses.jpg|The ruins of Dresden by Richard Peter File:Fotothek df ps 0001993 Landschaften ^ H\u00fcgellandschaften - Gebirgslandschaften.jpg |Zakopane and chairlift File:Fotothek df ps 0005825 Portale ^ Wohnhausportale - Haust\u00fcren.jpg |Stralsund in the 20th century ==Sources== * Deutsches Historisches Museum Berlin, Richard Peter sen.
