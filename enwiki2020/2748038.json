The depot is the oldest train station on the west coast. The track in front of the depot is the former Southern Pacific, currently Union Pacific, Coast Line, and also UP's Newhall Yard, where freight trains are made up and change crews. Both passenger and freight trains pass the depot. They include Caltrain, the Altamont Corridor Express, the Amtrak Capitol Corridor, the Amtrak Coast Starlight, and various UP freight trains. Inside the museum there is a library, artifact displays, 2 large model railroad layouts (HO and N scale), and a boardroom that is available to rent.
