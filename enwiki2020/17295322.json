    "text": "Giuseppe \"Bepi\" Moro (; 16 January 1921 \u2013 28 January 1974) was an Italian footballer who played as a goalkeeper. An eccentric and athletic player, who was also an excellent shot-stopper, he is regarded as one of Italy's most spectacular keepers of all time; he was also known for his penalty\u2013stopping abilities: with 16 saves in 270 appearances between 1947 and 1955, he has stopped the fifth\u2013highest number of penalties in Serie A. ==Club career== In eight season in Serie A, Giuseppe Moro defended the goal of six different teams: Fiorentina, Bari, Torino, Lucchese, Sampdoria and Roma. ==International career== Moro made his debut with the Italian national team in 1949, producing some notable saves against Hungary. During his second appearance, in a classic England\u2013Italy match played in London, he showcased his best-known block: Stan Mortensen tried to get past Moro with a powerful and accurate shot which the Italian goalkeeper brilliantly denied. Moro kept a clean sheet for 75 minutes, before giving up goals to Jack Rowley and Billy Wright, which did not diminish his outstanding performance. He also appeared with Italy in the 1950 World Cup in a win against Paraguay, replacing the first-choice goalkeeper Lucidio Sentimenti, who had played the two previous matches. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1921 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Italian footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:A.S.
