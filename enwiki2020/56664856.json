    "text": "\u00c7aml\u0131k railway station is a railway station near \u00c7aml\u0131k, Turkey, in south \u0130zmir Province. The station is the southernmost station within the province as well as the last station before Ayd\u0131n Province. TCDD Ta\u015f\u0131mac\u0131l\u0131k operates daily regional train service from \u0130zmir to Denizli, Nazilli and S\u00f6ke. The original station is located about north of the current station. The original station was opened on 1 July 1866 by the Ottoman Railway Company as part of their railway from \u0130zmir (Smyrna) to Ayd\u0131n. The Ottoman Railway Company, along with all its assets, were acquired by the Turkish State Railways in 1934. The 1866-station remained in service until 1976, when the railway was realigned through the hills north of \u00c7aml\u0131k and the current station was built. In 1991 the \u00c7aml\u0131k Railway Museum acquired the former station, as well as the old right-of-way, and is home to the largest steam-locomotive collection in Turkey. ==References== ==External links== *TCDD Ta\u015f\u0131mac\u0131l\u0131k Category:Railway stations in \u0130zmir Province Category:Railway stations opened in 1866 Category:1866 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Sel\u00e7uk District ",
