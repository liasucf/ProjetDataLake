In 1835 he was appointed by the Connecticut State Legislature judge of probate for the district of Hartford, and held the office for one year. In 1830 he was nominated by the Whigs for secretary of state, but was defeated, with all his associates on the ticket. He removed in 1838 to Troy, N. Y., where he was subsequently mayor of the city, and for two years (1854 and 1855) a member of the New York State Legislature. He was married, March 1, 1837, to Maria Champion, of Colchester, Conn.
