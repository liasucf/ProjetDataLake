    "text": "Distinction is a principle under international humanitarian law governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict, whereby belligerents must distinguish between combatants and civilians.Civilian in this instance means civilians who are non-combatants. Article 51.3 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions explains that \"Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities\". Distinction and proportionality are important factors in assessing military necessity in that the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not \"excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated\" by an attack on a military objective.Article 52 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides a widely accepted definition of military objective: \"In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage\" (Source: ). ==Codification== Distinction is covered by Protocol I (Additional to the Geneva Conventions), Chapter II: \"Civilians and Civilian Population\". Article 50 defines who is a civilian and what is a civilian population; article 51 describes the protection which should be given to civilian populations; and chapter III regulates the targeting of civilian objects. Article 8(2)(b)(i) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court also prohibits attack directed against civilians. Not all states have ratified Protocol I or the Rome Statute, but it is an accepted principle of international humanitarian law that the direct targeting of civilians is a breach of the customary laws of war and is binding on all belligerents. Luis Moreno-Ocampo was the Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court who investigated allegations of war crimes during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He published an open letter containing his findings; in a section titled \"Allegations concerning War Crimes\", he elucidates this use of distinction: ==See also== * International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons * Civilian casualty ratio ==Footnotes== ==References== * *.
