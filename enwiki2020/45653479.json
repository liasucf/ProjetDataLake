    "text": "Cly is a castle in the Italian town of Saint-Denis, overlooking the Dora Baltea () river, in Aosta Valley, northwest Italy. It belongs to the so-called primitive style of castle, consisting of a keep with a surrounding wall. The ruins rise from a bed of metamorphic rock, on the edge of a fault line which extends to the Castle of Quart.Francesco Prinetti, Andar per sassi. Le rocce alpine fra natura e cultura. Valle d'Aosta, Canavese, Valsesia, Quart (AO), Musumeci, 2010, pp. 36-37, . ==History== Cly was first mentioned in a document from 1207, in which the \"chapel sancti Mauricij (Saint Maurice) de castro Cliuo\" is mentioned among the goods of the Vicarage of Saint-Gilles in Verr\u00e8s,Martini Multimedia, \"Castello di Cly\", 2015 accessed on March 15, 2015 at http://www.inalto.org/it/schede/beni_culturali/castello_di_cly but the keep has been dated to 1027 using an analysis of the tree rings in its timbers (dendrochronology). Originally a fief held from the Counts of Savoy, in 1376 the direct ownership passed to the Duchy of Savoy, which installed a castellan to administer it for them until abandoned in 1550. The castle fell to ruins in the centuries that followed.Massetti, E. \"Aosta Valley Castles\" http://www.naturaosta.it/castles.htm accessed on 12 March 2015. == The castle today == Eventually the castle ruins became the property of the nearby town of Saint-Denis.
