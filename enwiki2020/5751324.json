    "text": "The \"Carnival of Venice\" is based on a Neapolitan folk tune called \"O Mamma, Mamma Cara\" and popularized by violinist and composer Niccolo Paganini, who wrote twenty variations on the original tune. He titled it \"Il Carnevale Di Venezia,\" Op. 40. In 1829, he wrote to a friend, \"The variations I've composed on the graceful Neapolitan ditty, 'O Mamma, Mamma Cara,' outshine everything. I can't describe it.\"https://www.greatsayings.net/sayings-about-germi/ Since then, the tune has been used for a number of popular songs such as \"If You Should Go to Venice\" and \"My Hat, It Has Three Corners\" (or in German, Mein Hut, der hat drei Ecken). A series of theme and variations has been written for solo cornet, as \"show off\" pieces that contain virtuoso displays of double and triple tonguing, and fast tempos. Since Paganini, many variations on the theme have been written, most notably those by Jean-Baptiste Arban, Del Staigers, Herbert L. Clarke for the cornet, trumpet, and euphonium, Francisco T\u00e1rrega and Johann Kaspar Mertz for classical guitar, Ignace Gibsone and Louis Moreau Gottschalk for piano, and Giovanni Bottesini for double bass. Chopin's \"Souvenir de Paganini\", dedicated to the composer and violin virtuoso Niccol\u00f2 Paganini, is another variation on this theme. The popular novelty song, \"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\", written and recorded in 1952, is based on the tune. The piece has also been arranged for tuba, notably played by John Fletcher and available on the CD The Best of Fletch. Also Roger Bobo on Tuba Libera (cd). Another tubist whose performance of the piece is noteworthy is \u00d8ystein Baadsvik, a Norwegian tubist. Dick Manning and Buddy Kaye wrote a popular song based on \"Carnival of Venice,\" named \"A Carnival in Venice,\" recorded by The Mills Brothers in 1954. Between 2015 and 2018, German crossover violinist David Garrett gained wide recognition with the tune, playing variations of Paganini's variations in movies and with various orchestras and bands.https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v;=I0CM0x45XRU and elsewhere ==Arrangements== *Jean-Baptiste Arban (1825-1889): Variations on 'Carnival of Venice' (for trumpet or cornet) *Nicolas-Charles Bochsa Le Carnaval de Venise for pedal harp *Giovanni Bottesini Introduction and Variations on Carnival of Venice (Double Bass) *Giulio Briccialdi Carnival of Venice for flute and orchestra Op.77 *Ernesto Cavallini Carnival of Venice (Eb Clarinet or any Eb instrument like Eb Piccolo Violin) *Charles Dancla The Carnival of Venice (for violin) *Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst (1812\u20131865) Le carnaval de Venise (for Violin) *F\u00e9lix Godefroid Carnaval de Venise pour harpe *Elgar Howarth: The Carnival of Venice Variations (for Brass Ensemble) *Paul Jeanjean (1874-1928): Venice Carnival (for clarinet) *Bob McChesney Variations on 'Carnival of Venice' for Trombone *Carlo Munier for mandolin and guitar *Paganini: Il carnevale di Venezia (for violin: Scordatura comes in: Tune the Violin up a Half Step) *Francisco T\u00e1rrega (1852-1909): Variations on Carnival of Venice (for guitar) *Eduardo Zerega Le Carnival de Venise pour mandoline et piano *Franz Liszt Variations sur Le Carnaval de Venise *Frederick Hemke The Carnival Of Venice (Introduction and Variations: opus posthumous) (for Eb alto saxophone) ==Recorded versions== *\"(The) Carnival of Venice\", Arban, arr.
