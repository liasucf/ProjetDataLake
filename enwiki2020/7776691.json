    "text": "Cascade Mall is an enclosed shopping mall in Burlington, Washington, United States. Opened in November 1989, the mall's anchor stores are AMC Theatres and TJ Maxx. There are 4 vacant anchor stores that were once 2 Macy's stores, Eagle Furniture, and JCPenney. Macerich owned the property before selling it to Merlone Geier Partners in January 2017. The mall permanently closed on June 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some stores will be allowed to stay open if they provide essential services, including those on the outer perimeter. ==History== Cascade Mall was built in 1989 by Winmar Company. Its original anchor stores were JCPenney, The Bon March\u00e9, Troutman's Emporium, and Sears. Winmar also built an adjacent strip mall called Cross Court, featuring a Target store. The opening of the mall caused many stores to close in nearby Anacortes. The Emporium store later became a second Bon March\u00e9 before both Bon March\u00e9 stores were re-branded as Macy's. In 2012, mall management removed the food court and replaced it with a TJ Maxx. On October 16, 2014, it was announced that Sears would be closing in January 2015. JCPenney followed suit in 2018. In January 2020, Macy's announced that it would close both of its stores as part of a plan to close 125 stores nationwide, leaving AMC Theatres and TJ Maxx as the only remaining anchor stores left. Cascade Mall was sold to Merlone Geier Partners in January 2017 for $25 million. ===Mass shooting=== Five people were killed in a mass shooting at the mall on September 23, 2016. The shooter was Arcan Cetin, a 20-year-old emigrant from Turkey. ==Closure== On June 9, 2020, Cascade Mall announced that it would close permanently on June 30 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The interior is set to close, while exterior-facing tenants will be able to continue to operate. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990 establishments in Washington (state) Category:Burlington, Washington Category:Shopping malls established in 1990 Category:Shopping malls in Washington (state) Category:Tourist attractions in Skagit County, Washington Category:Shopping malls disestablished in 2020 ",
