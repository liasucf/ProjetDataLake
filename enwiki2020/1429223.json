    "text": "The Des Moines Register is the daily morning newspaper of Des Moines, Iowa. ==History== ===Early period=== The first newspaper in Des Moines was the Iowa Star. In July 1849, Barlow Granger began the paper in an abandoned log cabin by the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon River. In 1854, The Star became the Iowa Statesman which was also a Democratic paper. In 1857, The Statesman became the Iowa State Journal, which published 3 times per week. In 1870, The Iowa Statesman became the Iowa State Leader as a Democratic newspaper, which competed with pro-Republican Iowa Daily State Register for the next 32 years. In 1902, George Roberts bought the Register and Leader and merged them into a morning newspaper. In 1903, Des Moines banker Gardner Cowles, Sr. purchased the Register and Leader. The name finally became The Des Moines Register in 1915. (Cowles also acquired the Des Moines Tribune in 1908. The Tribune, which merged with the rival Des Moines News in 1924 and the Des Moines Capital in 1927, served as the evening paper for the Des Moines area until it ended publication on September 25, 1982.) Under the ownership of the Cowles family, the Register became Iowa's largest and most influential newspaper, eventually adopting the slogan \"The Newspaper Iowa Depends Upon.\" Newspapers were distributed to all four corners of the state by train and later by truck as Iowa's highway system was improving. ===Nationwide development=== In 1906, the newspaper's first front-page editorial cartoon, illustrated by Jay Norwood Darling, was published; the tradition of front-page editorial cartoons continued until December 4, 2008 when 25-year veteran cartoonist Brian Duffy was let go in a round of staff cuts. The Register employed reporters in cities and towns throughout Iowa, and it covered national and international news stories from an Iowa perspective, even setting up its own news bureau in Washington, D.C. in 1933. During the 1960s, circulation of the Register peaked at nearly 250,000 for the daily edition and 500,000 for the Sunday edition\u2013more than the population of Des Moines at the time. In 1935, the Register & Tribune Company founded radio station KRNT-AM, named after the newspapers' nickname, \"the R 'n T.\" In 1955, the company, renamed Cowles Communications some years earlier, founded Des Moines' third television station, KRNT-TV, which was renamed KCCI after the radio station was sold in 1974. Cowles eventually acquired other newspapers, radio stations and television stations, but almost all of them were sold to other companies by 1985. In 1943, the Register became the first newspaper to sponsor a statewide opinion poll when it introduced the Iowa Poll, modeled after Iowan George Gallup's national Gallup poll. Sports coverage was increased under sports editor Garner \"Sec\" Taylor \u2013 for whom Sec Taylor Field at Principal Park is named \u2013 in the 1920s. For many years the Register printed its sports sections on peach-colored paper, but that tradition ended for the daily paper in 1981 and for the Sunday Register's \"Big Peach\" in 1999. Another Register tradition \u2013 the sponsorship of RAGBRAI \u2013 began in 1973 when writer John Karras challenged columnist Donald Kaul to do a border-to-border bicycle ride across Iowa. The liberal-leaning editorial page has brought Donald Kaul back for Sunday opinion columns. Other local columns have faded and given way to Gannett-distributed material. ===Under Gannett ownership=== In 1985, faced with declining circulation and revenues, the Cowles family sold off its various properties to different owners, with the Register going to Gannett. At the time of sale, only The New York Times had won more Pulitzer Prizes for national reporting. In 1990, the Register began to reduce its coverage of news outside of the Des Moines area by closing most of its Iowa news bureaus and ending carrier distribution to outlying counties, although an \"Iowa Edition\" of the Register was still being distributed throughout most of the state. Many of the Register's news stories and editorials focus on Des Moines and its suburbs. The Register opened a new printing and distribution facility on the south side of Des Moines in 2000. The news & advertising offices remained in downtown Des Moines. After 95 years in the Des Moines Register Building at 715 Locust Street, the Register announced in 2012 that they would move to a new location in 2013, settling for Capital Square three blocks to the east.. On June 15, 2013, the Register moved to its new location from 715 Locust Street to 400 Locust Street. In 2014, the old building has been sold for $1.6 million and will be redeveloped into a combination of apartments and retail space. In 2019, the Register switched from two print editions - a State and Metro edition - to one edition statewide. The Register came under scrutiny in September 2019 after uncovering a pair of controversial tweets made by Carson King, a 24-year-old Iowa man whose beer sign on ESPN College GameDay resulted in over $3 million in contributions to a children's hospital. King was 16 at the time of the posts. According to Carol Hunter, the paper's executive editor, the Register elected to include the information toward the end of a story about King. \"Reasonable people can look at the same set of facts and disagree on what merits publication. But rest assured such decisions are not made lightly and are rooted in what we perceive as the public good,\" she explained after receiving complaints from readers. Some readers later found social media comments previously made by the reporter, Aaron Calvin, which contained racial slurs and condemnation of law enforcement. The Register defended its decision and announced that they would launch an investigation into the \"inappropriate social media posts\" made by a staff member, though it did not name anyone involved. On September 27, the Register announced that Calvin was no longer employed by the newspaper.\"Des Moines Register Responds to Outcry Over Carson King Article; Reporter No Longer with Paper,\" WHO-DT, September 27, 2019. Accessed 09-27-2019. Calvin later wrote an op-ed in the Columbia Journalism Review blaming Gannett and the Register for what he considered to be an \"unfair\" firing. ==Editorial philosophy== In the three decades before the Cowles family acquired the Register in 1903, the Register was a \"voice of pragmatic conservatism.\"William B. Friedricks, \"Covering Iowa: The History of the Des Moines Register and Tribune Company, 1849-1985,\" pp. 40-44 (Blackwell Pub. 2000), . However, Gardner Cowles Sr., who served as a Republican in the Iowa General Assembly, was a delegate to the 1916 Republican National Convention, and served in the administration of President Herbert Hoover,Herbert Strentz, \"Gardner Cowles, Sr.,\" at Cowles Family Publishing Legacy, Drake University (accessed 2009-03-08). was an advocate of progressive Republicanism. The new owners presented a variety of viewpoints, including Darling cartoons that frequently made fun of progressive politicians.Editorial Cartoons of J.N. 'Ding' Darling (Iowa Digital Library: University of Iowa Libraries) - Cartoons referencing or depicting progressivism or progressives (accessed 2009-03-09). During the Cowles family's ownership, the Registers editorial page philosophy was generally more liberal in its outlook than editorial pages of other Iowa newspapers, but there were notable exceptions. The publishers strongly supported Republican Wendell Willkie's 1940 presidential campaign against Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt.Herbert Strentz, \"Gardner (Mike) Cowles, Jr.,\" at Cowles Family Publishing Legacy, Drake University (accessed 2009-03-08). The newspaper also supported Republican Dwight Eisenhower's campaigns for the Republican nomination and general election in 1952, and again in 1956. Although the Register endorsed presidential candidates Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964,\"How Iowa Dailies See Candidates\", Des Moines Register, October 25, 1964 at 6-F. Hubert Humphrey in 1968,Editorial, \"Difficult Choice for President\", Des Moines Register, October 27, 1968 at 12-T. and Jimmy Carter in 1976,Editorial, \"The Presidential Ticket\", Des Moines Register, October 24, 1976, at B1. it endorsed Richard Nixon in 1960 and 1972.Editorial, \"The Choice for President\", Des Moines Register, 1972-10-29 at 10-C. The paper was a severe critic of George W. Bush's warrantless wiretapping strategy and claimed that in doing so, \"President Bush has declared war on the American people.\" In December 2007, two weeks before the 2008 Iowa caucuses, the Register endorsed Hillary Clinton (in the Democratic caucuses) and John McCain (in the Republican caucuses).\"'Des Moines Register' backs McCain, Clinton,\" USA Today, 2007-12-17 (accessed 2009-03-08). In October 2008, it endorsed Barack Obama for president in the general election.Register editorial board endorses Obama for President, Des Moines Register, 2008-10-25 (accessed 2009-03-08). In 2011, 24 days before the 2012 Iowa caucuses, the newspaper endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican Iowa Cucuses. The Register endorsed Romney over Obama ten days before the general election on October 27, 2012, the first time that it supported a Republican for president since 1972. On July 24, 2015, the newspaper announced that it had been denied press credentials to cover a Donald Trump presidential campaign family picnic in Oskaloosa, Iowa, because of an editorial the previous week that had called on Trump to drop out of the race. On January 23, 2016, it endorsed Republican Senator Marco Rubio for the GOP nomination and Hillary Clinton for the Democratic candidate. On October 13, 2018, the Register endorsed all Democratic candidates standing for the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections and stated that Republicans have \"failed to govern.\" On January 25, 2020, the newspaper endorsed Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren for her party's presidential nomination. ==Register and Tribune Syndicate== In 1922, Gardner Cowles' son John launched the Register and Tribune Syndicate. At its peak, the syndicate offered other newspapers some 60 to 75 features, including editorial cartoonist Herblock and commentaries by David Horowitz, Stanley Karnow, and others. The cartoons and comic strips included Spider-Man. Will Eisner's The Spirit was part of a 16-page Sunday supplement known colloquially as \"The Spirit Section\". This was a tabloid-sized newsprint comic book sold as part of eventually 20 Sunday newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. The most successful comics feature was The Family Circus, eventually distributed to more than 1,000 newspapers. In 1986, the Register and Tribune Syndicate was sold to Hearst and the King Features Syndicate for $4.3 million.Strentz, Herb. \"John Cowles,\" Cowles Family Publishing Legacy: Drake University, Cowles Library.
