Brandolini stated that he was inspired by reading Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow right before watching an Italian political talk show with journalist Marco Travaglio and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi attacking each other. ==Similar concepts== In 2005, Russian physicist Sergey Lopatnikov has anonymously published an essay where he introduced a following definition: A similar concept, the \"mountain of shit theory\", was formulated by the Italian blogger Uriel Fanelli in 2010, roughly stating the same. Another similar concept was formulated by economist Roy Radner in 1993, who considered the performance of an organization that processes information in terms of (1) number of processors required to review data items and (2) the time delays associated with processing data items.Radner, R. (1993). The Organization of Decentralized Information Processing. Econometrica, 61(5), 1109-1146. doi:10.2307/2951495 Yet another similar concept is the Gish gallop, a technique used during debating that focuses on overwhelming an opponent with as many arguments as possible, without regard for accuracy or strength thereof. ==References== ==See also== * Godwin's law * Poe's law * Hitchens' razor * List of eponymous laws Category:Adages Category:Internet terminology Category:Asymmetry ",
