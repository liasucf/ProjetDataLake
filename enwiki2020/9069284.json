    "text": "Papiss Demba Ciss\u00e9 (; born 3 June 1985) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a striker for S\u00fcper Lig club Fenerbah\u00e7e and the Senegal national team. Formerly of SC Freiburg, he once held the record of most goals scored by an African player in a single Bundesliga campaign \u2013 22 in the 2010\u201311 season. That same season, Ciss\u00e9 won the EFFIFU award for being the most efficient striker in the league. A full international since 2009, Ciss\u00e9 has earned over 30 caps for Senegal and played for the country at the 2012 and 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Ciss\u00e9 began his career with G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Foot and Douanes Dakar before transferring to the French side Metz in summer 2005. After only one month during the 2005\u201306 season, he left Metz and was loaned to French side Cherbourg. During the season, Ciss\u00e9 played 26 matches and scored 11 goals for the Normandy club. After the season, Ciss\u00e9 returned to Metz for a further two years before being loaned again to Ch\u00e2teauroux in January 2008 and before returning to Metz in July 2008 for a third stint. ===Freiburg=== Ciss\u00e9 signed for German Bundesliga side Freiburg on 28 December 2009 for a fee of \u20ac1.62 million. He initially became a transfer target for Freiburg in the summer of 2009 after he scored a goal and assisted on another in a 2\u20131 friendly win for Metz over the club. However, a transfer fee could not be agreed upon at the time. Hannover 96 also expressed interest in the player. In his first partial season at Freiburg, Ciss\u00e9 appeared in 16 matches, scoring six goals. During the 2010\u201311 Bundesliga season, which was his first full season with Freiburg, Ciss\u00e9 was ranked second in the league in terms of goals scored, only behind Mario G\u00f3mez of Bayern Munich, who scored 28. Ciss\u00e9 also set a club and league record; his 22 goals during the course of the season set the single-season goal record by a Freiburg player, as well as setting a new record for the most goals scored by an African in a single Bundesliga season. The record was previously held by Tony Yeboah, who scored 20 goals with Eintracht Frankfurt in 1992\u201393. That same season, Ciss\u00e9 won the EFFIFU award for being the most efficient striker in the league. ===Newcastle United=== ====2011\u201312 season==== On 21 January 2012, Ciss\u00e9 signed for Newcastle United on a five-and-a-half-year deal for an estimated fee in the region of \u00a39.3 million, linking up with fellow Senegal striker Demba Ba in the process. He was subsequently handed the number 9 shirt, formerly worn by Newcastle legend Alan Shearer. On 5 February, Ciss\u00e9 made his debut for Newcastle in the 2\u20131 league win against Aston Villa at St James' Park. He replaced the injured Leon Best in the 14th minute before scoring the winning goal in the 71st minute with a breath-taking volley, chesting it before volleying with his left into the top left corner of the net. On 11 February, he made his first start for the club in the 5\u20130 away league defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. On 25 February, he scored in the sixth minute in a 2\u20132 home draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 25 March, he scored two first-half goals in Newcastle's 1\u20133 league victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, but he was denied a hat-trick early in the second half by a save by West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster. Ciss\u00e9's brace against West Brom made him the quickest player since Les Ferdinand to hit the five-goal mark for Newcastle. Ciss\u00e9 scored his sixth and seventh goals, against Liverpool, in a 2\u20130 home win. He scored a third consecutive brace at Liberty Stadium in a 0\u20132 away win against Swansea City on 6 April, bringing his tally to nine goals in eight matches. This made him Newcastle's most prolific goals per-game goalscorer of all-time, ahead of Hughie Gallacher. On 9 April, he scored his tenth goal in nine matches for Newcastle against Bolton Wanderers in a 2\u20130 home win. On 21 April, Ciss\u00e9 scored his 11th goal in ten matches during a 3\u20130 win against Stoke City. He then managed to score his 12th and 13th Premier League goals in a 0\u20132 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 2 May 2012, the second of which he curled the ball with the outside his foot from 37 yards out. Ciss\u00e9 described the goal as the best of his career, and was subsequently chosen as the BBC's Goal of the Season. At the end of his first half season with Newcastle, he was known for his consistent goalscoring, with astonishing goals firing the North East club into a fifth place spot in the table. ====2012\u201313 season==== On 4 July 2012, it was reported that Newcastle had blocked an offer from the Senegalese Football Federation for Ciss\u00e9 to play for Senegal at 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The reason behind the decision was that Newcastle wanted their key striker fit for a tough season ahead, playing European football. Ciss\u00e9 scored his first goal in the 2012\u201313 season with a header in the League Cup against Manchester United. He scored Newcastle's third goal in their Europa League defeat of Bordeaux on 4 October 2012, Newcastle's 100th match in European competition. He scored his first Premier League goal of the season in a 2\u20131 win over West Bromwich Albion on 28 October 2012, as a shot taken by Sammy Ameobi deflected off Ciss\u00e9 and into the net. The striker's scoring was scarce throughout the opening four months of the season, only scoring his second league goal of the season on 28 November, a 2\u20131 away defeat to Stoke City. Ciss\u00e9 started against Everton alongside Shola Ameobi and scored a header in the second minute in a 2\u20131 defeat on 2 January 2013. Ciss\u00e9 scored a spectacular 25-yard volley in Newcastle's 4\u20132 win over Southampton on 24 February, helping the club come from behind to secure a crucial victory over fellow relegation strugglers. Ciss\u00e9 scored an injury time winner at home to Stoke City on 10 March, sending Newcastle into 13th place. On 14 March, in the second leg Europa League Round of 16 tie at home to Anzhi Makhachkala, Ciss\u00e9 headed in a 94th-minute winner as Newcastle progressed to the quarter-finals with a 1\u20130 aggregate victory. Ciss\u00e9 also scored the first goal in a 3\u20131 loss away to Benfica in the first leg of Newcastle's Europa League quarter-final tie on 4 April. Three days later, he scored an injury time winner in a 1\u20130 victory over Fulham, causing him to jump into the crowd and sent manager Alan Pardew, in celebration, running in also. Ciss\u00e9 scored his fourth goal of the Europa League campaign in a 1\u20131 home draw with Benfica, but it was not enough to see Newcastle into the semi-finals of the competition as they fell 4\u20132 on aggregate. ====2013\u201314 season==== On 25 September 2013, Ciss\u00e9 opened his account for the 2013\u201314 season in a 2\u20130 win for Newcastle against Leeds United in the third round of the Football League Cup. Ciss\u00e9 scored his first Premier League goal of the season in a 5\u20131 home rout of Stoke City on Boxing Day, converting a late penalty. On 22 March 2014, he scored a last-minute winner to claim all three points for Newcastle in a 1\u20130 victory at home to Crystal Palace, only his second league goal of the season.

In June, it was revealed that Ciss\u00e9 would return from his injury earlier than expected and would return to Newcastle for pre-season training along with the rest of the first-team squad. On 10 September 2014, Newcastle manager Alan Pardew confirmed that Ciss\u00e9 would return to the Newcastle squad for their home match against Hull City on 20 September. Ciss\u00e9 made his return from injury against Hull on 20 September, replacing Emmanuel Rivi\u00e8re in the second half, and scoring both goals for Newcastle as they came back from two goals down to rescue a 2\u20132 draw. Ciss\u00e9 celebrated both goals by lifting up his jersey to reveal a message dedicated to team-mate Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez, who recently revealed that he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer. Two weeks later, another brace by Ciss\u00e9 earned Newcastle an identical result at Swansea City. On 5 December, he came on as a substitute for R\u00e9my Cabella and scored both of Newcastle's goals as they defeated leaders Chelsea 2\u20131, inflicting on their opponents a first defeat of the season.

On 7 March 2015, Ciss\u00e9 was handed a six- match ban by the FA after a spitting incident with Manchester United defender Jonny Evans, and one more for elbowing Everton's S\u00e9amus Coleman. All together, it was a seven-match ban. Ciss\u00e9 returned to the team as a second-half substitute in Newcastle's 1\u20131 draw with West Brom on 9 May. ====2015\u201316 season==== Ciss\u00e9 started the first match of the season at home against Southampton, scoring after chesting the ball in from close range to make the score 1\u20131. Despite scoring, however, he was substituted for new signing Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107, who had recently joined from Anderlecht. The match finished in a 2\u20132 draw. On 28 November 2015, he opened the scoring in an eventual 5\u20131 loss to Crystal Palace.
