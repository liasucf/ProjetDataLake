    "text": "Scott Lindsley McConnell is an Australian politician. He has been a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly since 2016, representing the electorate of Stuart. Elected as a Labor MP, he was one of three MPs excluded from the Labor caucus on 21 December 2018 over criticism of the government; he then resigned from the party on 19 February 2019.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-19/scott-mcconnell-quits-nt-labor- party-after-jeff-collins/10825938 ==Early life and career== McConnell was born in Alice Springs while his parents were based at Willowra Station in the Northern Territory. He spent his childhood at Napperby Station. McConnell was a park ranger with the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission, and then worked in Aboriginal enterprises Ikuntji Community Council in Amata. He then became CEO of the Ingkerreke and Ngurratjuta/Pmara Ntjarra Aboriginal Corporation. ==Politics== In 2016, McConnell won the Labor nomination in the remote seat of Stuart, held by Bess Price of the Country Liberal Party. During the campaign, McConnell travelled over 60,000 km while husting in the vast electorate, which stretches from northeastern Alice Springs all the way to the Western Australia border. He was endorsed by Alison Anderson, the retiring independent MP for neighbouring Namatjira and a prominent indigenous activist. MacDonnell won the seat on a swing of almost 31 percent on 75 percent of the two-party vote, the largest swing of the election\u2014enough to revert Stuart to its traditional status as a comfortably safe Labor seat in one stroke. He actually won 73 percent of the primary vote, more than enough to win without the need for preferences. On 3 February 2018, McConnell announced he would not contest the next election, saying he had made a \"huge error of judgement\" in thinking he could influence government policy in remote areas. He resigned from the Labor Party to sit as an independent on 19 February 2019.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-19/scott-mcconnell-quits-nt-labor- party-after-jeff-collins/10825938 ==References== Category:Living people Category:Members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
