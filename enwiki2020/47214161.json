Approximately 2,300 spectators attended the stadium's first event. The official opening of the stadium was on November 22, 1948.Grand Falls Advertiser, November 27, 1948 An exhibition game was played between two teams from the Maritime Senior Hockey League, the Halifax Crescents and the Halifax St. Mary's.
