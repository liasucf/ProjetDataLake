It was established in 1980.It is one of the top private Engineering Colleges in the state of Telangana.The college allows undergraduate students through the statewide EAMCET & JEE exam conducted every year. It offers the Bachelor and masters in Engineering and MBA courses. == History == The Government of Andhra Pradesh realized in the late 1970s the popular demand for enhancement of facilities for technical education. It decided to adopt a progressive policy of encouraging philanthropic organizations to establish and manage technical institutions. The elite philanthropists of Warangal City, with the sole aim of imparting quality technical education, established Kakatiya Institute of Technology & Science, Warangal (KITSW) in 1980 under the aegis of the Ekasila Education Society (EES). The former Prime Minister of India, the late P.V. Narasimha Rao Garu, laid the foundation stone for the institute. The members of the EES encompass many sections of society, including educationists, agriculturists, industrialists, doctors, and social workers. They are highly respected personalities of the city and known for their generosity in social activities. The main objective of the EES is to develop KITS Warangal into a major technical institution imparting a quality education to the students of the Telangana region. The institution started functioning in 1980 with two B.Tech programs (Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering) in a sprawling lush green campus of 65 acres, in an area well connected by rail ( Kazipet and Warangal ) and road. It is a self-financing co-education autonomous institution and is the first private engineering college in the Telangana region. The institute has the distinction of being the first in the country to offer a B.Tech program in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, since 1981. Started as an undergraduate institution, KITSW has recorded impressive progress and today it is a full-fledged postgraduate institution with nine B.Tech. programs, and seven postgraduate programs. Six academic departments are recognized as the research centres by the NIT Warangal & Kakatiya University, Warangal to offer doctoral programs. The campus is now Wi-Fi enabled and OFC connected with 40 Mbit/s internet bandwidth. The undergraduate programs (with an intake of 900 per year from 2017\u201318) leading to B.Tech are Civil Engineering (120), Computer Science & Engineering (180), Electrical & Electronics Engineering (120), Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering (60), Electronics & Communication Engineering (180), Information Technology (60) and Mechanical Engineering (180).Two more programs Computer Science & Engineering, Networks (60) and Electronics Communication and Instrumentation Engineering (60) were added from the academic year of 2019. The postgraduate programs (with an intake of 247 per year from 2012\u201313) leading to M.Tech are Structural & Construction Engineering (24), Design Engineering (24), Digital Communication (25), Software Engineering (36), VLSI & Embedded System Design (18), MCA (60) and MBA (60). The total number of research scholars working in the research centres of this institute is 42. == Campus and location == The KITS campus covers 65 acres with a lush green atmosphere.
