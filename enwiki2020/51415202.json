He wrote, \"director Ben Smallbone (brother of the movie's lead player) is adept at generating suspense, particularly during a scene in which James attempts a phone conversation with his daughter while bad guys lurk outside his motel room, and manages to persuasively convey the seediness, desperation, and danger that define the demimonde that Garo rules with a whim of iron. To put it another way: Priceless achieves greater impact through understatement and implication than many other similarly plotted movies do with R-rated explicitness.\"Film Review: \u2018Priceless\u2019 (Variety) Susan Wloszczyna of RogerEbert.com was negative about the film, criticizing it as \"cheap and generic.\" She wrote, \"The main intention behind 'Priceless,' besides allowing For King & Country to become involved in the movie business, seems to be a genuine desire to raise awareness of the horrors of the crime of trafficking, not that this PG-13 drama shows anything too graphic. But, on a purely entertainment level, all I know is when the end credits started rolling, I said to myself, 'Thank God.'\" Kimber Myers of the Los Angeles Times was more positive, characterizing it as a \"lean drama that relies more on emotion than well-crafted dialogue or character development\" and saying, \"Though its obvious message may not translate well outside its intended audience, the converted will likely be entertained by the well-produced package the moving themes are delivered in.\" ==Accompanying media== For King and Country recorded Priceless, a song which serves on the film's soundtrack. It was released as a single, and has reached #4 on the Hot Christian Songs chart. The film was adapted into a novel, titled Priceless: She's Worth Fighting For, which was released on September 6, 2016.
