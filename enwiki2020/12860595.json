    "text": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid. A GABA receptor agonist is a drug that is an agonist for one or more of the GABA receptors, producing typically sedative effects, and may also cause other effects such as anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects. There are three receptors of the gamma-aminobutyric acid. The two receptors GABA-\u03b1 and GABA-\u03c1 are ion channels that are permeable to chloride ions which reduces neuronal excitability. The GABA-\u03b2 receptor belongs to the class of G-Protein coupled receptors that inhibit adenylyl cyclase, therefore leading to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). GABA-\u03b1 and GABA-\u03c1 receptors produce sedative and hypnotic effects and have anti-convulsion properties. GABA-\u03b2 receptors also produce sedative effects. Furthermore, they lead to changes in gene transcription. ==GABAA receptor== ===Agonists=== * Abecarnil * Barbiturates (in high doses) * Eszopiclone * Bamaluzole * Fengabine * GABA * Gabamide * GABOB * Gaboxadol * Ibotenic acid * Isoguvacine * Isonipecotic acid * Muscimol * Pantherine * Phenibut * Picamilon * Progabide * Propofol * Quisqualamine * SL 75102 * Thiomuscimol * Topiramate * Zolpidem ===PAMs=== * Alcohols (e.g., ethanol, isopropanol) * Avermectins (e.g., ivermectin) * Barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital) * Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam) * Bromides (e.g., potassium bromide) * Carbamates (e.g., meprobamate, carisoprodol) * Chloral hydrate, chloralose, petrichloral, and other 2,2,2-trichloroethanol prodrugs * Chlormezanone * Clomethiazole * Dihydroergolines (e.g., ergoloid (dihydroergotoxine)) * Etazepine * Etifoxine * 2-Substituted phenols (e.g., thymol, eugenol) *Imidazoles (e.g., etomidate) * Kavalactones (found in kava) * Loreclezole * Neuroactive steroids (e.g., allopregnanolone, ganaxolone) * Nonbenzodiazepines (e.g., zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone) * Propofol * Piperidinediones (e.g., glutethimide, methyprylon) * Propanidid * Pyrazolopyridines (e.g., etazolate) * Quinazolinones (e.g., methaqualone) * Skullcap constituents * Stiripentol * Disulfonylalkanes (e.g., sulfonmethane, tetronal, trional) * Valerian constituents (e.g., valeric acid, valerenic acid) * Volatile organic compounds (e.g., chloroform, diethyl ether, sevoflurane) ==GABAB receptor== ===Agonists=== * 1,4-Butanediol * Baclofen * GABA * Gabamide * GABOB * gamma- Butyrolactone (GBL) * gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) * gamma-Hydroxyvaleric acid (GHV) * gamma-Valerolactone (GVL) * Lesogaberan * Phenibut * Picamilon * Progabide * SL-75102 * Tolgabide ===PAMs=== * ADX-71441 ==GABAA-\u03c1 receptor== ===Agonists=== * CACA * CAMP * GABA * GABOB * N4-Chloroacetylcytosine arabinoside * Picamilon * Progabide * Tolgabide ===PAMs=== * Neuroactive steroids (e.g., allopregnanolone, THDOC, alphaxolone) ==Discussion== Many commonly used sedative and anxiolytic drugs that affect the GABA receptor complex are not agonists. These drugs act instead as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and while they do bind to the GABA receptors, they bind to an allosteric site on the receptor and cannot induce a response from the neuron without an actual agonist being present. Drugs that fall into this class exert their pharmacodynamic action by increasing the effects that an agonist has when potentiation is achieved. Most general anaesthetics are PAMs of GABA-A receptor. Positive allosteric modulators work by increasing the frequency with which the chloride channel opens when an agonist binds to its own site on the GABA receptor. The resulting increase in the concentration of Cl\u2212 ions in the postsynaptic neuron immediately hyperpolarizes this neuron, making it less excitable and thus inhibiting the possibility of an action potential. However, some general anesthetics like propofol and high doses of barbiturates may not only be positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors but also direct agonists of these receptors. Alcohol is an indirect GABA agonist. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and GABA-like drugs are used to suppress spasms. Alcohol is believed to mimic GABA's effect in the brain, binding to GABA receptors and inhibiting neuronal signaling. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Drugs acting on the nervous system Category:GABA receptor agonists ",
