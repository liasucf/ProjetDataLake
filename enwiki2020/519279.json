It was built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler of Punjab to celebrate his capture of the Koh-i-Noor diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani in 1813. Its construction was completed in 1818. The pillars support delicate cusped arches. The central area, where Maharaja Ranjit Singh held court, has a mirrored ceiling. The pavilion consisted of two storeys until it was damaged by lightning in 1932. ==Images== File:Hazuri Bagh basement 3 (WCLA).jpg|The baradari's basement contains subterranean chambers File:Hazuri Bagh basement 2 (WCLA).jpg|Basement of the structure File:Baradari_of_Hazuri_Bagh.jpg|The baradari is accessed through archways File:Hazuri Bagh Bardari HD.jpg File:HAZOORI_BAGH_2.jpg|The baradari is in the centre of the Hazuri Bagh quadrangle File:Hazuri Bagh and corner of Baradari.JPG Image:Bara Dari East & North facing sides of The 12 door building July 1 2005.jpg|East and North sides of the Baradari, Lahore, Pakistan Image:Hazuri Bagh bardari-2.jpeg|Closeup Image:Hazuri Bagh Baradari with Lahore Fort.jpg|Hazuri Bagh Baradari with Lahore Fort, in background.
