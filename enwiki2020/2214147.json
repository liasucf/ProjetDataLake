    "text": "Dames at Sea is a musical with book and lyrics by George Haimsohn and Robin Miller and music by Jim Wise. The musical is a parody of large, flashy 1930s Busby Berkeley-style movie musicals in which a chorus girl, newly arrived off the bus from the Midwest to New York City, steps into a role on Broadway and becomes a star. It originally played Off-Off-Broadway in 1966 at the Caffe Cino and then played Off-Broadway, starring newcomer Bernadette Peters, beginning in 1968 for a successful run. The show has enjoyed a London run, a television adaptation and a number of revivals, before its Broadway premiere in October 2015. ==Production history== The musical was originally a short sketch,Klein, Alvin. \"Theater; Not So Good: Goodspeed Revives A Revival\" The New York Times (webcache.googleusercontent.com), May 26, 2002 based loosely on the Gold Diggers movies, written by George Haimsohn, Jim Wise, and Robin Miller. The character of \"Ruby\" was suggested by the Ruby Keeler-type from those early movies. It was lengthened to a 50-minute production, and director Robert Dahdah prepared it for its first staging. After the original actress who was to play \"Ruby\" withdrew during rehearsals, choreographer Don Price recommended newcomer Bernadette Peters for the role. The show opened in May 1966 as Dames at Sea, or Golddiggers Afloat at the Caffe Cino, a small coffee house/performance space in New York City's Greenwich Village, where it continued for 148 performances. The original Caffe Cino cast featured Peters as Ruby, Joe McGuire as Frank, David Christmas as Dick, Jill Roberts as Joan, Norma Bigtree as Mona and Gary Filsinger as the Director and Captain. Peters was replaced by her sister, Donna Forbes (now DeSeta) during the run.Stone, Wendell C. (2005). Caffe Cino: The Birthplace of Off-Off Broadway.

Mona Kent is its temperamental diva star, Joan a wise-cracking chorus girl, and Hennesy the producer/manager/director. The naive Ruby arrives from Utah, with \"nothing but tap shoes in her suitcase and a prayer in her heart\",Kerr, Walter. The New York Times, January 5, 1969, p. D1 determined to be a Broadway star. She promptly faints into the arms of Dick, a sailor and aspiring songwriter (\"It's You\"). Ruby gets a job in the chorus, but Hennesy informs the cast that the theater must be torn down, and they must find another place for the show. Joan and Lucky, another sailor and her former boyfriend, renew their romance (\"Choo-Choo Honeymoon\") while Ruby admits her feelings for Dick (\"The Sailor of My Dreams\"). Dick and Lucky persuade their Captain to volunteer the use of their ship (\"Dames at Sea\"). Mona recognizes the Captain as a former boyfriend (\"The Beguine\"). When Mona kisses Dick, to persuade him to give her one of his songs, Ruby sees and is despondent (\"Raining In My Heart\"). Dick explains the misunderstanding and the couple make up (\"There's Something About You\"). While rehearsing on the actual ship, Mona becomes sea sick (\"The Echo Waltz\"); Ruby steps in to save the show and becomes a star (\"Star Tar\"). The three couples decide to marry (\"Let's Have A Simple Wedding\"). ===Other elements=== John Wilson in The New York Times pointed out that the music is a mixture of parody, such as the torch song \"That Mister Man\", pastiche (\"Raining in My Heart\"), and the real thing. Wilson wrote that \"The pastiche songs, built around phrases borrowed from or close to actual songs of the genre, usually project an appealing period flavor.\"Wilson, John. The New York Times, \"Happily Afloat with 'Dames at Sea' \", July 6, 1969, p. D24 The joke was that, while spoofing the large, lavish movie musicals, Dames at Sea did it with a cast of six, 2 pianos and percussion, and a tiny stage.Mordden, Ethan. Open a New Window: The Broadway Musical in the 1960s (2002), p. 184, Palgrave Macmillan, In the 2015 Broadway production, director Randy Skinner noted that this was \"...the first time in New York that 'Dames at Sea' will be heard with an orchestra, and the show will have more dancing than ever before with all new dance and vocal arrangements by Rob Berman...' \" This production opened with movie credits projected onto a screen, reproducing exactly the font used by Warner Bros. in the early 1930s. Skinner received a 2016 Tony Award nomination for his choreography. == Musical numbers== Original 1968 Cast recording amazon.com ;Act I * \"Overture\" * \"Wall Street\" - Mona * \"It's You\" - Dick and Ruby * \"Broadway Baby\" - Dick * \"That Mister Of Mine\" - Mona and Company * \"Choo-Choo Honeymoon\" - Joan and Lucky * \"The Sailor of My Dreams\" - Ruby * \"Singapore Sue\" - Lucky and Company * \"Broadway Baby\" (reprise) - Hennesey * \"Good Times Are Here To Stay\" - Mona, Joan and Company ;Act II * \"Dames At Sea\" - Company * \"The Beguine\" - Mona and Captain * \"Raining In My Heart\" - Ruby and Company * \"There's Something About You\" - Dick and Ruby * \"Raining In My Heart\" (reprise) - Ruby * \"The Echo Waltz\" - Mona, Joan, Ruby and Company * \"Star Tar\" - Ruby and Company * \"Let's Have A Simple Wedding\" - Company ==Major Casts== {| class=\"wikitable\" width:90%;\" |- ! scope\"col\" | Character ! scope\"col\" | Original Off-Off-Broadway (1966) ! scope\"col\" | Original Off- Broadway (1968) ! scope\"col\" | TV Movie (1971) ! scope\"col\" | Workshop (2014) ! scope\"col\" | Original Broadway (2015) |- ! scope=\"row\"|Ruby |align=\"center\" colspan=\"2|Bernadette Peters |align=\"center\"|Ann-Margret |align=\"center\"|Laura Osnes |align=\"center\"|Eloise Kropp |- ! scope=\"row\"|Dick |align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|David Christmas |align=\"center\"|Harvey Evans |colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|Cary Tedder |- ! scope=\"row\"|Joan |align=\"center\"|Jill Roberts |align=\"center\"|Sally Stark |align=\"center\"|Anne Meara |colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|Mara Davi |- ! scope=\"row\"|Lucky |align=\"center\"|Joe McGuire* |align=\"center\"|Joseph R.

The show is wonderfully helped by its cast. The star I suppose is Bernadette Peters as the wholly sweetly silly small-town chorine who taps her way from the bus station to stardom in 24 hours.\"Barnes, Clive. The New York Times, December 22, 1968, p. 54 Walter Kerr, in his Sunday Times feature article, added \"You'll find the show cheerful and ingratiating, I think... Miss Peters is a real find... She is extremely funny, and endearing on top of that.\" The Time Magazine review noted that the show had \"three thoroughly engaging stars and some of the most ingenious staging currently on or off Broadway. Tamara Long, as the slinky heavy, brandishes a flaming Morganitic torch for her Mister Man, and Sally Stark, as Ruby's peroxided pal, belts a note almost as plangent as the great Merman's. The comic delight of the show, though, is Bernadette Peters, whose Ruby can simultaneously sing and dance up a storm that puts all New York (including Queen Mane of Rumania) at her feet.\"\"Friends from the '30s\" Time Magazine, January 3, 1969 The review of the production at the Off-Broadway Bouwerie Lane Theatre (2004) in the Gay City News: > Director David Fuller has filled his production with such subtle touches, > which make the show seem intriguingly contemporary, and far from the > saccharine and serious treatments this chestnut usually receives, he\u2019s > restored the true Off-Broadway spirit that used the establishment\u2019s own > forms to tweak its foibles. First staged during the Vietnam War era, the > musical seems more relevant than ever as it takes precise aim at the sunny > outlook that comes from near-psychotic denial of reality. The review praises the cast: \"The cast does a great job... Individually, Kathleen White as Ruby is deliciously comic, with expressions and physical comedies that recall Lucille Ball... Chrysten Peddie as Joan has the tough dame attitude down cold. She\u2019s got a warm presence, is a great dancer and has a strong voice.\"Gay City News, Vol. 3, Issue 339, September 23\u201339, 2004 The USA Today reviewer of the 2015 production wrote: \"So why bring this trifle to Broadway, for the first time, 49 years after its downtown premiere? Never mind; just check your cares and pretensions at the door of the Helen Hayes Theatre, ... and prepare to be thoroughly charmed. Through it all, happily, Skinner keeps everyone dancing, providing exuberant tap routines that his cast executes with joyful facility.\"Gardner, Elysa. \"Broadway's new 'Dames At Sea' is a dance-driven delight\" USA Today, October 22, 2015 Steven Suskin, in reviewing for the Huffington Post wrote: \"The surprise, today, is that the show remains viable; this first Broadway production is impeccably staged and loaded with entertainment, and should delight its target audience ... The songs ... hit all the bases, reminding us of all those wonderful Harry Warren songs; but they are mostly lightweight pastiches, never quite as memorable as the real thing. The show--which was heretofore performed with two pianos and a drummer--is now fully orchestrated.\"Suskin, Steven. \"Aisle View: 'Dames' on Broadway\" Huffington Post, October 22, 2015 ==Television== An adaptation for television starred Ann-Margret as Ruby, Ann Miller as Mona, Anne Meara as Joan, Harvey Evans as Dick, Fred Gwynne as Hennesy and Dick Shawn as the Captain.Dames at Sea (1971) (TV) imdb.com, accessed July 21, 2009 According to Ethan Mordden in Open A New Window (2002), p. 184, Shawn played the Captain It was broadcast on the Bell System Family Theater on NBC on November 15, 1971.
