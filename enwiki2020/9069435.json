    "text": "Heart - Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the American rock band Heart. It is the sixteenth of the band's album releases. This compilation collects Heart's hits from 1975 through 1983, with one all-new studio recording, the Diane Warren penned \"Strong, Strong Wind\". The collection, which was limited to release in the US and Japan, acted as a 'first volume' of two greatest hits releases, the companion being the widely released Greatest Hits: 1985\u20131995. Other territories confusingly experienced the Capitol release of These Dreams: Greatest Hits instead of this collection, which featured a selection of tracks from 1976\u20131995. ==Track listing== # \"Strong, Strong Wind\" (Diane Warren) - 4:28 # \"Magic Man\" (Ann Wilson, Nancy Wilson) - 5:28 # \"Crazy on You\" (A.
