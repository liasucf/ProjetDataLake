A butterfly house, or conservatory is a facility which is specifically intended for the breeding and display of butterflies with an emphasis on education. Some butterfly houses also feature other insects and arthropods. Butterfly houses are owned and operated by museums, universities, non-profit corporations, and private individuals as part of their residence; as well as small businesses that are owner operated. The pattern of butterfly parks isn't new. In fact, such exhibits of butterflies were extremely popular in England by the year 1970. Penang Butterfly Farm in Malaysia was introduced on March 29, 1986, which was tropical world's first creepy crawly and live butterfly haven. United States had its initially butterfly stop, Butterfly World, opened for open review in Coconut Creek, Florida in the year 1988.Butterflies Parks [butterfly](http://www.flowera.in/) ==Americas== ===Canada=== * Butterflies & Blooms, Georgina, Ontario * Cambridge Butterfly Conservatory, Cambridge, Ontario * F.
