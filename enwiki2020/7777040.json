He competed for the United States in the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan in the discus throw where he won the bronze medal, an achievement magnified by the fact that he had only finished third the 1964 US Olympic Trials. He also finished third on three occasions in the US AAU championships. In 1967 he threw his personal best of 62.99m at the Sacramento Invitational Meet, although this was not enough to win the event and he finished third. ==References== Category:American male discus throwers Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in track and field Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Category:Stanford Cardinal men's track and field athletes Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Track and field athletes from California Category:Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics ",
