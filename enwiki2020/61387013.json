    "text": "G/O Media Inc. is a media company that runs Gizmodo, Kotaku, Jalopnik, Deadspin, Lifehacker, Jezebel, The Root, The A.V. Club, The Takeout, The Onion, and The Inventory. G/O was formed in April 2019 when Great Hill Partners, a private equity firm, purchased the websites from Univision for $20.6 million. Prior to the sale, the former Gawker Media properties had operated as Gizmodo Media Group after being acquired by Univision following the conclusion of the Bollea v. Gawker lawsuit and subsequent bankruptcy in 2016. Former Forbes executive Jim Spanfeller became the CEO of G/O Media. == Conflict with leadership == G/O Media's leadership, introduced after the purchase from Univision, has been subject to frequent criticism by employees. Complaints include closer advertiser relationships, a lack of diversity, and suppression of reporting about the company itself. In October 2019 Deadspin's editor and chief, Barry Petchesky, was fired for refusing to adhere to a directive that the site \"stick to sports.\" Soon after, the entirety of Deadspin staff resigned in protest leaving the site inactive. In January 2020 the GMG union, which represents the staff of G/O media, announced a vote of no confidence in CEO Jim Spanfeller citing, among other issues, a lack of willingness to negotiate for \"functional editorial independence protections.\" == References == == Further reading == * * * == External links == * == See also == * Vox Media Category:Mass media companies established in 2019 Category:Gawker Media ",
