    "text": "Kingston is a southern suburb of Wellington, New Zealand, south of Brooklyn and Mornington. The suburb was developed in the 1960s, when there was more \"cut and fill\" earthworks in new subdivisions to provide flat sections. In 2013 and 2017 there were slips of unstable land, and a Wellington City Council spokesman blamed the \"cut and fill\" for the slips, though after a previous slip some local residents suggested that broken or faulty water mains or stormwater drains could be responsible. In 2014 a \"slip-prone\" Kingston house was demolished. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, the area including Mornington has a population of 2,208, a decrease of 48 people since the 2006 census. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Wellington City ",
