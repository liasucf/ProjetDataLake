IRMA boards supported both Control Unit Terminal (CUT) and Distributed Function Terminal (DFT) mode, although the later required additional software\u2013DFT mode supported multiple simultaneous mainframe sessions. IRMA boards were invented by Technical Analysis Corp. (TAC), acquired by Digital Communications Associates, Inc. (DCA) who manufactured and marketed the Irma products from 1982 on. DCA of Alpharetta, Georgia, was acquired in 1994 by Attachmate of Bellevue, Washington. A board with all the capabilities of that which would eventually be called IRMA was originally developed in-house by Amdahl Corp in 1977, but it was not actively marketed by Amdahl. ==See also== *IBM 3270 PC *Terminal emulator program ==References== Category:Mainframe computers Category:History of computing hardware ",
