BE 7042, 21 January 1859 He was an editor of the Dutch photography magazine and member of the Amsterdam photographers' society Helios. == Legacy == Asser died in Amsterdam and he is considered the father of photography in the Netherlands. His descendants gave 200 of his earliest photos from 1839-1860 to the national collection in 1993. Since then they have been kept in the Rijksmuseum. Besides using art studio techniques for still lifes, Asser took many pictures of his family, most notably a childhood portrait of Tobias Asser. == References == == External links == * Website for early photography in the Netherlands an initiative of Mattie Boom (curator of photography at the Rijksmuseum), Saskia Asser (his great-great- granddaughter and curator at Huis Marseille), and the Photography Foundation in Amsterdam * Eduard Isaac Asser in the Rijksmuseum * Eduard Isaac Asser in the Joods Historisch Museum Category:1809 births Category:1894 deaths Category:People from Amsterdam Category:Dutch photographers ",
