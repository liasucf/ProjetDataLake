    "text": "Mayric's was a concert events venue in Manila that featured new and upcoming artists in the Philippine music scene in the 1980s and 1990s. It helped launch the career of many Filipino artists or, at the least, served as a regular venues for their live performances. Those artists included The Dawn (band), Eraserheads, Half Life Half Death, The Jerks, Sandwich (band), Slapshock, Sugar Hiccup, Yano, and The Youth (band). Some journalists subsequently tagged the venue as \"Where All the Great Bands Are Born.\" In 2009, independent concert producer and promoter Sazi Cosino bought the rights to the business and renamed it Sazi's Music Bar. It eventually shut down operations on May 31, 2012, due to building management and renovation changes. ==References== https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/arts-and-entertainment/6-gig-places-in- the-90s-that-shaped-filipino-music-today-a1915-20170803-lfrm https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/content/262320/sazi-s-mayric-s- music-bar-bows-out-after-almost-three-decades/story/ Category:Music venues in Metro Manila Category:Buildings and structures in Sampaloc, Manila Category:Former buildings and structures in Manila ",
