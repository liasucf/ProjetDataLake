    "text": "Be\u0142\u017cec () is a village in Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Be\u0142\u017cec. It lies approximately south of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski and south-east of the regional capital Lublin. The village is located in the historical region Galicia. During World War II it was the site of the Nazi Belzec extermination camp. ==History== Already in 1887 Be\u0142\u017cec received rail connection to Lw\u00f3w, one of the largest agglomerations in the region, via Rawa Ruska (now in western Ukraine). Be\u0142\u017cec became a full-fledged rail hub in 1916, with the brand new connection to Lublin via Rejowiec and a layover yard with a big engine-house. During World War II, the village laid on the border of three new districts of General Government created by Nazi Germany: Distrikt Lublin with the capital in Lublin, Distrikt Krakau centered on Krak\u00f3w, and District Galizien (created on 1 September 1941 soon after Operation Barbarossa) with the capital in Lw\u00f3w. Some 1 million Polish Jews lived there during the Holocaust in occupied Poland in the so-called Lublin reservation. That's why, at a nearby Kozielsk Hill some from the railway station, Nazi Germany built the first stationary gas chambers of the Final Solution to the Jewish Question. Between 430,000 and 500,000 people are believed to have been murdered at the Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp between March and December 1942. The Be\u0142\u017cec station was bombed by a Soviet warplane on July 4, 1944, setting fire to munitions and explosives from the German military cargo train. The ensuing explosions and fires consumed over 50 nearby buildings along with the train station itself. Several railway workers were killed. The historic train station was never rebuilt. A new one was erected half-a-kilometre distance in postwar Poland. ==Points of interest== File:Poland Belzec - extermination camp mausoleum.jpg | Extermination camp mausoleum File:Belzec lubelskie wies cerkiew 012.JPG | Orthodox church of St. Vasily, 1756 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Villages in Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski County Category:Holocaust locations in Poland ",
