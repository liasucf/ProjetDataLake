Worship of My\u014dken is mainly associated with the Nichiren, Shingon and Tendai schools of Japanese Buddhism. ==Origins== Sud\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di (My\u014dken) is thought to have originated from Chinese folk beliefs regarding the northern pole star and/or the Big Dipper syncretized with Buddhism, though an Indian origin has also been proposed. Despite being called a 'bodhisattva' (bosatsu), My\u014dken is more accurately described as a deva. During the Tang dynasty, Chinese Buddhism adopted Taoist Big Dipper worship, borrowing various texts and rituals which were then modified to conform with Buddhist practices and doctrines. The cult of the Big Dipper was eventually absorbed in the cults of various Buddhist divinities, My\u014dken being one of these. The earliest source on My\u014dken is The Divine Spells of the Great Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs Taught by the Seven Buddhas and Eight Bodhisattvas (traditional: \u4e03\u4f5b\u516b\u83e9\u85a9\u6240\u8aac\u5927\u9640\u7f85\u5c3c\u795e\u5492\u7d93, Pinyin: Q\u012bf\u00f3 b\u0101 p\u00fas\u00e0 su\u01d2shu\u014d d\u00e0 tu\u00f3lu\u00f3n\u00ed sh\u00e9nzh\u00f2u j\u012bng; T. 1332), translated some time during the Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420 CE). In the text, My\u014dken introduces himself as \"the bodhisattva of the north star (\u5317\u8fb0\u83e9\u85a9), by name called 'Wondrous Vision' (\u5999\u898b, Pinyin: mi\u00e0oji\u00e0n, Japanese: my\u014dken).\" By the Tang period, esoteric texts and rituals centered on My\u014dken proliferated; a number of astral mandalas with My\u014dken as the primary divinity, drawing directly on the Tang texts, have been preserved in Japan. Ennin's diary of his travels in China in 838 suggests that the cult of My\u014dken was still flourishing there during the late Tang period. ==Spread to Japan== \u5343\u8449\u795e\u793e) in Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture Originally an 11th century Buddhist temple dedicated to My\u014dken, converted into a Shinto shrine during the Meiji period The cult of My\u014dken is thought to have been brought in Japan during the 7th century by immigrants (toraijin) from Goguryeo and Baekje. During the reign of Emperor Tenji (661\u2013672), the toraijin were resettled in the easternmost parts of the country; as a result, My\u014dken worship spread throughout the eastern provinces. By the Heian period, pole star worship had become widespread enough that imperial decrees banned it for the reason that it involved \"mingling of men and women,\" and thus caused ritual impurity. Pole star worship was also forbidden among the inhabitants of the capital and nearby areas when the imperial princess (sai\u014d) made her way to Ise to begin her service at the shrines. Nevertheless, the cult of the pole star left its mark on imperial rituals such as the emperor's enthronement and the worship of the imperial clan deity at Ise Shrine. Worship of the pole star was also practiced in Onmy\u014dd\u014d, where it was deified as Chintaku Reifujin (\u93ae\u5b85\u970a\u7b26\u795e). My\u014dken worship was particularly prevalent among clans based in eastern Japan (the modern Kant\u014d and T\u014dhoku regions), with the Kanmu Taira clan (Kanmu Heishi) and their offshoots such as the Chiba and the S\u014dma clans being among the deity's notable devotees. One legend claims that Taira no Masakado was a devotee of My\u014dken, who aided him in his military exploits. When Masakado grew proud and arrogant, the deity withdrew his favor and instead aided Masakado's uncle Yoshifumi, the ancestor of the Chiba clan. Owing to his status as the Chiba clan's ujigami (guardian deity), temples and shrines dedicated to My\u014dken are particularly numerous in former Chiba territories. My\u014dken worship is also prevalent in many Nichiren-sh\u016b Buddhist temples due to the clan's connections with the school's Nakayama lineage. My\u014dken riding a tortoise Veneration of My\u014dken as a god of war is believed to derive from the practice of worshiping the easternmost star of the Big Dipper, Alkaid (\u03b7 UMa), known in Chinese as the 'Broken Army' or the 'Destroyer of Armies' (\u7834\u8ecd\u661f, Pinyin: P\u00f2j\u016bn x\u012bng; Japanese: Hagunsei) to bring success in battle. The Sutra of the Big Dipper for Prolonging Life (\u5317\u6597\u4e03\u661f\u5ef6\u547d\u7d93, Pinyin: B\u011bid\u01d2u q\u012bx\u012bng y\u00e1nm\u00ecng j\u012bng; T. 1307) identifies Alkaid with the buddha Bhaisajyaguru (Yakushi Nyorai), so that My\u014dken is thus sometimes considered to be a manifestation of Bhaisajyaguru. In other traditions My\u014dken was also associated with Kissh\u014dten (Mah\u0101\u015br\u012b, one of the Seven Lucky Gods). Indeed, some early depictions of My\u014dken shared similar attributes to those of Kissh\u014dten that a number of what are commonly believed to be depictions of Kissh\u014dten may have originally been My\u014dken statues. Depiction of My\u014dken with four arms During the late Edo period, the kokugaku scholar Hirata Atsutane identified the Big Dipper with the primordial deity Amenominakanushi-no-Kami. Due to the separation of Buddhism and Shinto, many shrines (and some temples) dedicated to My\u014dken officially became Amenominakanushi shrines. Myoken has also been identified (albeit less commonly) with the star god Amatsumikaboshi. ==Iconography== Depictions of My\u014dken have varied greatly over time. Aside from representations which conform to standard bodhisattva iconography, My\u014dken is also portrayed as a youth or as an armored, stern-faced figure holding a sword above his head. He can be shown standing or sitting atop a cloud, a dragon or a tortoise (the symbol of the north in Chinese cosmology). Artistic portrayals of My\u014dken, particularly those showing him with a sword, are thought to be influenced by depictions of the Taoist deity Xuanwu, who is also venerated as the god of the north. == See also == * Xuanwu (god) * Black Tortoise * Dhruva * Big Dipper * Little Dipper * Buddhism in Japan * Mount My\u014dken ==Notes== == References == Category:Buddhist gods Category:Bodhisattvas Category:Japanese gods Category:Stellar gods Category:Vajrayana Category:Nichiren Buddhism Category:Dharmapalas Category:War gods Category:Onmy\u014dd\u014d deities Category:Polaris ",
