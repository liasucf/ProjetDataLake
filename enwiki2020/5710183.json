The song released in 1996 becoming a UK hit achieving platinum status. The song released worldwide in 1998 (together with his debut solo album) and simultaneously featured in the Bollywood blockbuster Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya, starring Salman Khan and Kajol. The soundtrack went on to sell over 10 million copies and the success of the movie has widely been attributed by film pundits to the popularity of Kamaal's debut song. As a result of his successful debut single, Kamaal was signed by record label HMV (EMI India) in December 1997. As a playback singer, he has sung numerous songs for most of the well known music directors in the Indian film industry such as A.R.

He went on to achieve further success with his solo albums O Oh Jaane Jana, Suno To Deewana Dil and Kal Raat. MTV Award- winning director Shivraj Santhakumar collaborated with Kamaal to shoot a music video for Kal Raat in Rome. The music video caught the eye of Bollywood director Rahul Rawail and landed Kamaal his debut acting role. Kamaal has also worked with two time Oscar-winning Musical Director A. R. Rahman (Slumdog Millionaire).
