    "text": "USA Hockey is recognized by the International Olympic Committee and the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee as the governing body for organized ice hockey in the United States and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. Before June 1991, the organization was known as the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS). The organization is based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Its mission is to promote the growth of ice hockey in the U.S. USA Hockey programs support and develop players, coaches, officials, and facilities. USA Hockey also has junior ice hockey and senior ice hockey programs, and supports a disabled ice hockey program. USA Hockey provides certification programs for coaches and officials. Members of the organization receive a subscription to USA Hockey Magazine. ==History== The Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) was founded on October 29, 1937, in New York City by Tommy Lockhart. When he first started operating AHAUS, the paperwork fit into a shoebox in his apartment.Allen, Kevin (2011) Star-Spangled Hockey The need for a national governing body for hockey came from the desire to efficiently manage the growing game of ice hockey, rather than having several different groups which included the Amateur Athletic Union. In September 1938, Lockhart reached signed an agreement with W. G. Hardy of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) which regulated international games in North America, set out provisions for transfer of players between the organizations, and recognized of each other's authority. In 1940, he led AHAUS into a union with the CAHA by establishing the International Ice Hockey Association, and served as its vice-president. AHAUS was admitted as a member of the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace in 1947, being recognized as the international governing body of hockey in the United States instead of the Amateur Athletic Union which was previously recognized by the IIHF. Lockhart established the first national ice hockey tournaments for pre-high school boys in 1949. He announced the establishment of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame on May 19, 1968, to be located in the town of Eveleth, Minnesota. Lockhart was succeeded as president by William Thayer Tutt in 1972. ===Presidents=== *Tommy Lockhart (1937\u20131972) *William Thayer Tutt (1972\u20131986) *Walter Bush (1986\u20132003) *Ron DeGregorio (2003\u20132015) *Jim Smith (2015\u2013present) ===Executive directors=== *Hal Trumble (1972\u20131987) *Bob Johnson (1987\u20131990) *Baaron Pittenger (1990\u20131993) *Dave Ogrean (1993\u20131999) *Doug Palazzari (1999\u20132005) *Dave Ogrean (2005\u20132017) *Pat Kelleher (2017\u2013present) ===Hall of fame=== ==Structure== ===Playing levels=== USA Hockey formerly used different division names (Mite, Squirt, etc.) in their youth levels and to indicate the age level of the players.

The program's goal is to prepare student-athletes under the age of 18 for participation on U.S. national teams and continued success throughout their future hockey careers. The NTDP consists of two teams; the U.S. National Under-18 Team, and the U.S. National Under-17 Team. The teams compete in the United States Hockey League in addition to playing NCAA colleges and in International competition. Until 2009, the NTDP competed in the North American Hockey League. Numerous NTDP alumni have gone on to play in the NHL. In the 2012\u201313 season, 60 former NTDP players suited up for NHL teams. In the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, six first-round selections (including no. 1 pick Erik Johnson) were former members of the NTDP. In 2007, four NTDP members were selected in the first round, with Patrick Kane and James van Riemsdyk going 1st and 2nd overall respectively. Through 2013, some 228 NTDP players had been selected in the NHL Entry Draft. The NTDP plays home games at USA Hockey Arena.
