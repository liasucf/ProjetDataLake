He also filmed the funeral of Boles\u0142aw Prus in May 1912. Before World War I he was among the founding members of the Association of Professional Photographers and the Society of Photography Professionals.

In 1925 he also published a history of photojournalism in Poland Zaranie fotografii dziennikarskiej w Polsce. Fuks also collaborated on a number of feature silent films, notably the 1912 silent film Ob\u0142\u0105kany starring Stefan Jaracz and Carewicz, based on a play by Gabriela Zapolska and directed by William Wauer.
