    "text": "In Turkic languages, Il Khan, also il-khan, ilkhan, elkhan, etc. is a title of leadership, of \"khan\" with exact meaning depending on the context to interpret the Turkic word 'el'/'il' with meanings 'tribe'/'clan', 'the people', 'nation', '(home)land', state, tribal union, etc. \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044e\u0440\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c ('), Leningrad, Nauka Publishers, 1969, pp. 168\u2014169. Accordingly, the meanings are: *\"Tribal Chief\". Of note is the use of this lesser meaning as the title for the rulers of Hulagu's state, commonly known as the Ilkhanate. Here the lesser \"khanship\" intended to indicate the initial deference of Khulagu to M\u00f6ngke Khan and his successor Great Khans of the Mongol empire. The title \"Ilkhan\", borne by the descendants of Hulagu and later other Borjigin princes in Persia, does not materialize in the sources until after 1260.Peter Jackson, The Mongols and the West, p.127 *Khan of the nation. The earliest mention of a similar title in the second meaning, namely \"Illig Qaghan\", refers to Bumin Qaghan and dates by 552 C.E. (In fact, Nikolai Gumilyov transcribes Bumin's title as \"ilkhan\".)\u0413\u0443\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0451\u0432 \u041b. \u041d. \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u044e\u0440\u043a\u0438. \u2014 \u0421\u041f\u0431., 2002. \u2014 \u0421. 113\u2014115. ==See also== *Elbasy (\"Head of the Nation\") ==References== Category:Titles of national or ethnic leadership Category:Turkic words and phrases Category:Men's social titles ",
