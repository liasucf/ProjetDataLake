    "text": "Pseudophyllanthus is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Phyllanthaceae. It is one of the eight genera in the tribe Poranthereae. Its closest relative is Poranthera. Its sole species is Pseudophyllanthus ovalis. It is a dioecious, or rarely monoecious, shrub or small tree, native to southern Africa. It had been included in the genus Andrachne, but in 2007 a molecular phylogenetic study of DNA sequences showed that it did not belong there.Maria S. Vorontsova, Petra Hoffmann, Olivier Maurin, and Mark W. Chase. 2007. \"Phylogenetics of tribe Poranthereae (Phyllanthaceae).\" American Journal of Botany 94(12):2026-2040. In 2008, the new genus Pseudophyllanthus was created for it.Maria S. Vorontsova and Petra Hoffmann. 2008. \"A phylogenetic classification of tribe Poranthereae (Phyllanthaceae).\" Kew Bulletin 63(1):41-59. == References == Category:Monotypic Malpighiales genera Category:Phyllanthaceae Category:Flora of Southern Africa Category:Phyllanthaceae genera ",
