    "text": "Chesuncook Lake is a reservoir in the North Maine Woods and Piscataquis County, Maine. It is formed by the damming of the West Branch Penobscot River, by dams built in 1835, 1903, and 1916. Mark Shanahan, \"Searching for Thoreau\", Portland Press Herald, 1997 It is approximately long and 1\u20134 miles wide, with a surface area of and a maximum depth of . It is the third-largest body of fresh water in Maine. The lake was named \"goose place\" by combining the call of the Canada goose schunk with auke (the Abenaki word for place) to form Chesuncook. Henry David Thoreau visited Chesuncook (village) and lake in 1853 and wrote about its beginnings in his book \"The Maine Woods\" Chesuncook Part 4; 'Ansell Smith's the oldest and principal clearing about this lake,...' Thoreau observed no geese on the lake during his visit.Thoreau, Henry David The Maine Woods Apollo edition (1966) Thomas Y. Crowell Company pp.162,414-416&423 The original lake was enlarged by construction of Ripogenus Dam in 1916 to cover Ripogenus Lake, Caribou Lake, and Moose Pond. The enlarged lake became less suitable for Lake trout because of fluctuating reservoir levels for generating hydroelectricity. The lake is on the Northern Forest Canoe Trail. ==In fiction== In H.P. Lovecraft's horror short story The Thing on the Doorstep, the ill-fated Edward Derby found himself lost in the town of Chesuncook, \"close to the wildest, deepest, and least explored forest belt in Maine.\" Chesuncook Lake features in First Lensman by EE \"Doc\" Smith as a clandestine handover point for a shipment of illegal drugs. ==Chesuncook Village == Chesuncook Village is a small settlement located on the northwestern shore of Chesuncook Lake with a year-round population of approximately 10 people on this otherwise uninhabited lake. It is in an unorganized township in the heart of the east coast's largest unsettled logging forest and is considered to be the last wilderness area on the eastern seaboard of the United States. It is approximately 60 miles from the nearest towns of Greenville and Millinocket, Maine. It is completely off grid with no infrastructure. The only public land within the village is maintained by the state as a pasture and public boat launch/beach area. There is a non denominational meeting house which is used by seasonal churches, as a meeting place, and for foul weather refuge by those traveling through the area. ===History=== Chesuncook \"Village\" was settled in 1849 by Ansel A. Smith as a logging outfit. The historic Chesuncook Lake House Inn, built in 1864 is still in operation 150 years later by its current owners the Surprenant family.Chesuncook Lake House Inn-open as of 2017 Set on the shoreline of Chesuncook Lake and facing Mount Katahdin in the distance, the Lake House and its acreage are one of the few remaining North Woods \"logging hotels\" which at one time were built at intervals of every 14 miles (this was the average distance a man could walk in one day) through the logging regions in order to house and feed the logging industry as well as visiting travelers and sportsmen such as Henry David Thoreau. The rest of the village which is actually a 1920s subdivision that never really took off, supports a scattering of privately owned seasonal camps and a few permanent year-round residents. In 2003 Chesuncook Village celebrated the 150 year anniversary of the original publication of Henry David Thoreau's book \"The Maine Woods\". ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *Chesuncook Village Website *Chesuncook Village Historical Preservation Association website *\"Chesuncook Village, Maine\" website \u2014 a non profit publication. *\"The Suncooker\" website \u2014 Chesuncook Village news, photos and general info. *Chesuncook Lake House website *Chesuncook Village Property Owners Association website *Trails.com entry * Columbia Encyclopedia entry Category:Reservoirs in Maine Category:Lakes of Piscataquis County, Maine Category:North Maine Woods Category:Northern Forest Canoe Trail Category:Penobscot River ",
