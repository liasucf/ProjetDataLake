    "text": "Square Enix Collective is a self-titled \"service provider for Indie developers which helps get a developer's game published while maintaining their creative control. They are a subsidiary of Square Enix, with a focus on generating indie awareness. ==History== In 2016, the process for developers interested in working with the Collective looked like this: developers would submit a pitch to the company on a rolling basis. The pitches would then be presented to the public through the Collective's website, and a polling process would take place once a week, with anyone welcome to vote on the projects that excited them. While the polling process was not the sole determinate for which developers the Collective would assist, it played a pivotal role. Square Enix took five percent of the games revenue after fees. They have run campaigns for 167 games, in addition to publishing 12 games through Kickstarter fundraising and work with parent company Square Enix. Notable campaigns include Moonlighter and Moon Hunters. In October 2018, the company announced they would be closing their platform for campaign curation, instead focusing on larger and specific products without the element of public polling. ==Games== {| !
