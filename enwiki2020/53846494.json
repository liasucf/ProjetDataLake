The recipient of Israel's President's Award for Technology and Innovation, he is the co-founder of BillGuard and the founder and chairman of Israel Tech Challenge. ==Early life== Ouzan was born in Reims, France. His father, James Elisha Ouzan, is a cardiologist and his mother Francoise is a historian. When he was 10, he read about computers in a video gaming magazine and began to study programming on the internet via a dial-up connection he had persuaded his parents to install. After learning the programming languages C and C++, he began to build websites for businesses, becoming a professional coder at 13. Growing up, Ouzan visited Israel several times with his family. He had limited opportunity to further his programming studies in Reims, and seeking to learn more about technology and entrepreneurship, he moved to Jerusalem in 2003 through Na'ale Elite Academy, an organization for young Jewish people to make Aliyah independently. Through Na'ale, Ouzan attended Boys Town Jerusalem, a high school. In 2006 Ouzan won the Israel-Intel Young Scientists Prize for a computer-based surveillance system that detects and follows the movement of an intruder in three dimensions. Originally developed as required coursework at Boys Town, it placed first in the 2005 Israel Department of Education national competition for projects related to Comprehensive Interdisciplinary Technology. Ouzan was awarded the prize at the residence of Israel's president as the recipient of the President's Award for Technology and Innovation. The national Intel prize qualified Ouzan to represent Israel at the International Intel Science competition, where he won second prize. In addition to a cash award, a planet was named after him in honor of his win. Following his high school graduation, Ouzan served in the Israel Defense Forces.
