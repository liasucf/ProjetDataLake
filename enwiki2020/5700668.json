    "text": "SEEBOARD, formerly South Eastern Electricity Board (SEEB), was a British electricity company. The electrical power industry in the United Kingdom was nationalised by the Electricity Act 1947, when over 600 electric power companies were merged into twelve Area Boards, one of which was the South Eastern Electricity Board. It acquired the former Princes Hotel on the seafront in Hove, East Sussex, and converted it into its headquarters. The building was refurbished and substantially extended between 1979 and 1981. The key people on the Board were: Charles George Morley New (d.1957) (1948\u201355), Chairman Harold V. Pugh (1964), E. Sinnott (1967), Deputy Chairman E. Sinnott (1964), A.G. Milne (1967), Full time member E. Peel (1964, 1967). The total number of customers supplied by the board was: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Customers supplied South Eastern Electricity Board !Year !1948/9 !1960/1 !1965/6 !1970/1 !1975/6 !1978/9 !1980/1 !1985/6 !1987/8 !1988/9 |- !No. of Customers, 1000s |1482 |1787 |1848 |1849 |1844 |1872 |1787 |1849 |1887 |1909 |} The amount of electricity, in GWh, sold by the South Eastern Electricity Board over its operational life was:{ \"version\": 2, \"width\": 600, \"height\": 200, \"data\": [ { \"name\": \"table\", \"values\": [ { \"x\": 1949, \"y\": 1999 }, { \"x\": 1956, \"y\": 3723 }, { \"x\": 1961, \"y\": 5910 }, { \"x\": 1966, \"y\": 8675 }, { \"x\": 1967, \"y\": 8891 }, { \"x\": 1968, \"y\": 9583 }, { \"x\": 1969, \"y\": 10249 }, { \"x\": 1970, \"y\": 10865 }, { \"x\": 1971, \"y\": 11380 }, { \"x\": 1972, \"y\": 12586 }, { \"x\": 1976, \"y\": 13175 }, { \"x\": 1978, \"y\": 13442 }, { \"x\": 1979, \"y\": 14118 }, { \"x\": 1980, \"y\": 13986 }, { \"x\": 1981, \"y\": 13170 }, { \"x\": 1982, \"y\": 14730 }, { \"x\": 1987, \"y\": 15888 }, { \"x\": 1988, \"y\": 16123 }, { \"x\": 1989, \"y\": 16552 } ] } ], \"scales\": [ { \"name\": \"x\", \"type\": \"ordinal\", \"range\": \"width\", \"zero\": false, \"domain\": { \"data\": \"table\", \"field\": \"x\" } }, { \"name\": \"y\", \"type\": \"linear\", \"range\": \"height\", \"nice\": true, \"domain\": { \"data\": \"table\", \"field\": \"y\" } } ], \"axes\": [ { \"type\": \"x\", \"scale\": \"x\" }, { \"type\": \"y\", \"scale\": \"y\" } ], \"marks\": [ { \"type\": \"rect\", \"from\": { \"data\": \"table\" }, \"properties\": { \"enter\": { \"x\": { \"scale\": \"x\", \"field\": \"x\" }, \"y\": { \"scale\": \"y\", \"field\": \"y\" }, \"y2\": { \"scale\": \"y\", \"value\": 0 }, \"fill\": { \"value\": \"steelblue\" }, \"width\": { \"scale\": \"x\", \"band\": \"true\", \"offset\": -1 } } } } ] } == Post privatisation == On 31 March 1990 the area electricity boards were changed to independent regional electricity companies (REC), and SEEBOARD plc was formed. On 11 December 1990 the RECs were privatised. The Hove headquarters was closed in 1994, but some jobs were transferred to a nearby SEEBOARD office in Portslade. Seeboard Powerlink, a company owned by SEEBOARD, BICC and ABB, was awarded (on 13 August 1998) a 30-year contract to operate, maintain, finance and renew London Underground's high-voltage power distribution network, under the terms of the UK government's private finance initiative. Seeboard Powerlink became responsible for distribution of high-voltage electricity supplies to London Underground's substations and more than 400 kilometres of track. The contract included significant capital construction and installation works on the LUL power system valued at approximately \u00a3100 million. In 2002 SEEBOARD joined 24seven Utility Services under the ownership of the LE Group, which then rebranded in 2003 to become EDF Energy Networks, the UK branch of \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France, before being acquired by Cheung Kong Holdings and renamed UK Power Networks. ==Bibliography== * ==References== ==External links== * EDF Energy website * EDF Energy's Fuel Mix for 2006 * BalfourBeatty press release 1998-08-13/ Category:Companies based in Brighton and Hove Category:\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France Category:Former nationalised industries of the United Kingdom Category:Electric power companies of the United Kingdom Category:Utilities of England Category:1947 establishments in England ",
