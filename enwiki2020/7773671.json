It was also used by Kansas State University for track and field. ==Stadium history== The stadium was built and named in tribute to Kansas State students who died in World War I. The west stands were built in 1922, and the stands on the east side of the stadium were completed two years later. Its general seating capacity was 17,500 people when completed, although attendance sometimes exceeded 20,000. The stadium was built at the location of Ahearn Field, and as late as 1938 the field was still known as Ahearn Field at Memorial Stadium. The original plans for the stadium included an enclosed bowl, but the final phase of the stadium was never built. In 2015\u201316, both sides of the stadium were renovated, with much of the seating bowl converted to gardens. The stadium was officially re- dedicated as \"World War I Memorial Stadium\" on April 21, 2017. ==Football history== Memorial Stadium, 1924 The first game held at the stadium was on October 6, 1922, when only the west wing of the stadium was complete.

Four years later in 1928, a two- story wooden press-box was added to the east wing. The upper level was for press, while the lower level featured boxes for distinguished alumni and guests. A pre-World War II record crowd of 17,545 attended the Wildcats' game against #6 Oklahoma on November 11, 1939. Kansas State lost the game 13\u201310.
