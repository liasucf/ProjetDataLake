The scroll form and the presence of the uncontracted word \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 (not in nomina sacra form) suggest that it is of Jewish rather than Christian origin. The text of the fragment consists mainly of a letter of Ahasuerus that Jerome moved to form chapter 16:1\u201324 of the Vulgate. It is also referred to as Addition E and in the Septuagint text stood between verses 8:12 and 8:13 of the shorter Masoretic Text.James C. Vanderkam, An Introduction to Early Judaism (Eerdmans 2001), p. 85 According to Richard H. Hiers addition E \"makes much pious reference to the power and justice of God\". The Masoretic Text of Esther makes no mention whatever of God under any title, although God is mentioned throughout the Septuagint text of the book and even more often in the independent \"Alpha Text\".Jean-Daniel Macchi, Esther (Kohlhammer Verlag 2019)Brittany Melton, Where is God in the Megilloth?: A Dialogue on the Ambiguity of Divine Presence and Absence (BRILL 2018), p. 69Aaron Koller, Esther in Ancient Jewish Thought (Cambridge University Press 2014), p. 35 This manuscript comes from Bahnasa, Oxyrhychus, Egypt.
