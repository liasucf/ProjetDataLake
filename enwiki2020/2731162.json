    "text": "Giovanni Marradi, 1888 Giovanni Marradi (1852\u20131922) was an Italian poet born at Livorno and educated at Pisa and Florence. At the latter place he started with others a short-lived review, the Nuovi Goliardi, which made a literary sensation. He became a teacher at various colleges, and eventually an educational inspector in Massa Carrara. He was much influenced by Carducci, and became known not only as a critic but as a charming descriptive poet, his principal volumes of verse being Canzone moderne (1870), Fantasie marnie (1881), Canzoni e fantasie (1853), Ricordi lirici (1884), Poesie (1887), Nuovi canti (1891) and Ballati moderne (1895). He is the great-grandfather of the expressionist musician Giovanni Marradi. == References == * Category:1852 births Category:1922 deaths Category:People from Livorno Category:Italian poets Category:Italian male poets ",
