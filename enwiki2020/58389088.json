In addition, elplural.com has an Autonomous communities' section, focused on Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Andalusia. The latter, since 26 September 2016, is formed by the integration of the Andaluces Diario newspaper, led by the journalist Antonio Avenda\u00f1o, who joined from P\u00fablico. The Opinion section is composed of conventional articles and analysis, as well as cartoons from the series \"Los Calvitos\", by humorist Patricio Rocco, aka Pat.
