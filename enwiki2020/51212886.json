    "text": "On Friday July 29, 2016 the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reported that its computer systems had been infiltrated . It is strongly believed by US intelligence sources that the infiltrator groups are Russian foreign intelligence groups that breached the Democratic National Committee's computer systems . These groups are known as Fancy Bear \"...linked the DNC attack to a Russian hacker group that went by many names, including Sofacy and Fancy Bear.\" and Cozy Bear (or \"Sofacy\"). CrowdStrike assisted with efforts to deal with the DCCC breach. There is significant concern that the Russians are attempting to influence the 2016 Presidential campaign. Note: Dmitri Alperovitch is a CrowdStrike co-founder, CTO, and cybersecurity expert. Russian cyber intrusions into United States government and private sector computer systems significantly increased after the U.S, imposed sanctions on Russia after its invasion of the Crimea in Ukraine. It has been President Obama's preference to publicize cyber attacks. ==See also== *Cold War II *Democratic National Committee cyber attacks *Foreign electoral intervention *Russian espionage in the United States *Russian interference in the 2018 United States elections *Social media in the 2016 United States presidential election ==References== Category:Computer security Category:Espionage in the United States Category:Russian intelligence agencies Category:2016 scandals Category:Data breaches in the United States Category:Controversies of the 2016 United States presidential election Category:Hacking in the 2010s Category:2016 in computing ",
