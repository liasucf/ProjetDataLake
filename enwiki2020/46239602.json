The waters drop about from the outlets. A 2003 study found the spring to have a consistent flow, averaging a day. The waters contain sulfur and other minerals, with the sulfur content measuring 230.8 parts per million. As such, the waters are considered to have healing properties by local residents, and the springs are used to treat skin conditions and rheumatism. The sulfuric waters of Pancuran Tujuh pour down the slope, and over the centuries have left a mineral deposit. Waters from Pancuran Tujuh also pool in nearby caves. These include Sarabadak, where Mbah Atas Angin and his followers are held to have lived, as well as Kembar, Selirang, and Sri Warna. Sarabadak serves as a petilasan (monument) to Mbah Atas Angin, with its entrance located next to the springs. The path to Pancuran Tujuh overlooks nearby Purwokerto, with the cities of Purbalingga and Cilacap visible on clear days. ==References== ==Works cited== * * * * * * ==External links== * Category:Hot springs of Indonesia Category:Tourist attractions in Central Java Category:Banyumas Regency ",
