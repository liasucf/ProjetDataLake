While serving as the president of AWP Punjab he took part actively in organising the slum dwellers of the capital territory of Islamabad against forced evictions and moved a petition against Capital Development Authority (CDA) to stop evictions from slums. Akhtar served as chairman of the All-Pakistan Alliance for Katchi Abadis (informal settlements or slums) which was an association of slum-dwellers from across Pakistan, formed in 1999 to protect the rights of the millions of slum residents across the country, against forced evictions and homelessness and to speak for the need for low-income housing in Pakistan. In 2001, under Pervez Musharraf\u2019s era according to the Katchi Abadi Policy 2001, kachi abadis were given orders to provide urban squatters security through re-settlement and regularization. Despite this policy, forced evictions of residents from katchi abadis continued which led to protests and demonstrations by the All Pakistan Katchi Abadi Alliance. In 2002, residents of four abadis were alloted plots in Alipur Farash under \u2018Modern Shelter Urban Programme\u2019, according to which out of the total 41 Katchi Abadis of the capital, only 11 have been recognized by the CDA, the rest were to be demolished without providing alternative shelter for the residents. Despite having pledged to transform Alipur Farash into a \u201cmodel town\u201d for the working class, the CDA failed to provide even basic amenities for its residents, development has remained incomplete for years. Female members of All Pakistan Katchi Abadi Alliance from Alipur Farash protested many times for provision of basic facilities. In 2014, hundreds of kachi abadis' residents along with All-Pakistan Alliance for Katchi Abadis, held protests against the Capital Development Authority\u2019s (CDA) plans to bulldoze katchi abadis in Islamabad. On July 30, 2015, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) along with rangers, police and local administration demolished dozens of houses in informal settlement of I-11/1,Islamabad which were built 30 years ago. On August 2, 2015, to stop these forced evictions and to find ways for urban housing crisis in informal settlements of I-11/1, Akhtar along with residents from Kachi Abadis, filed a petition in the Supreme Court for the case on the right to housing.

On August 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered the federal government and other departments to stop further demolishing of houses in katchi abadi I-11, Islamabad.
