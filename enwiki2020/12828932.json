The station is owned by the University of Southern California (USC) and rebroadcasts the classical music format of KUSC in Los Angeles. ==History== The station first signed on May 1, 1991 as KWWV and broadcast an adult contemporary music format. KWWV was acquired by Salisbury Broadcasting in 1994. The station changed its format to smooth jazz by 1998. In 1999, KWWV changed its call letters to KKAL and adopted a top 40 format. In October 2006, Mapleton Communications announced that it was purchasing the station, then bearing the call letters KXTY, from Salisbury for $1 million. However, this transaction was not completed. On August 20, 2007, Lazer Communications acquired the rights to purchase KXTY station, then airing a talk format, from Mapleton.http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6470001.html On November 19, Lazer changed the format of KXTY to romantica (Spanish-language adult contemporary) music. On February 11, 2009, the University of Southern California purchased KXTY for $1.2 million, adding the signal to its network of stations relaying KUSC, a non-commercial station in Los Angeles airing classical music. In preparation for the format change, KXTY went silent on April 22 (according to 100000watts.com). On May 13, 2009, the station began rebroadcasting KUSC's signal with new call letters KESC. ==References== ==External links== * * ESC Category:Classical music radio stations in the United States Category:Mass media in San Luis Obispo County, California Category:NPR member stations Category:Morro Bay Category:San Luis Obispo, California ",
