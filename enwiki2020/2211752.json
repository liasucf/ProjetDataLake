    "text": "Ricardo Elvio Pavoni C\u00faneo (born August 8, 1943 in Montevideo) is an Uruguayan former football defender who played the majority of his career for Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente in the Argentine First Division. ==Career== ===Club=== Pavoni began his football career with the Montevidean club Defensor. Disillusioned with life as a footballer, he was on the point of abandoning the game completely and going to work in a casino as a croupier until he was convinced to play football for Independiente of Argentina. The left-sided full-back has been described as a natural leader and the perfect man-marker. He was also responsible for scoring 57 goals. He arrived to Independiente at age 21 to replace Tom\u00e1s Rolan, another Uruguayan who had suffered a serious injury. His first match for Independiente was on March 24, 1965, in a Copa Libertadores match. Independiente beat Boca Juniors by two goals to nil. For twelve seasons (1965\u20131976) he was idolised by the Independiente fans. He was particularly remembered for his powering runs along the left wing, putting away free kicks with his left foot and for his frequent last-ditch efforts to clear the ball from the goal-line. He is considered by many to be the archetypal Uruguayan footballer. Pavoni (affectionately known as \"el Chivo\") won many honours during his career, including the Argentine first division championships three times, the Copa Libertadores five times, the Copa Interamericana on three occasions and one Copa Intercontinental. He was also a member of the Uruguayan squad that took part in the World Cup of 1974, in West Germany. Since retirement, he has been involved with the club as a trainer with reserve and youth teams. He has also been caretaker manager of the first team on several occasions. ===International=== Pavoni played 13 times for the Uruguay national team between 1962 and 1974, scoring two goals.rsssf: Uruguay record international footballers He was part of the Uruguay squad for the 1974 FIFA World Cup.rsssf: Uruguay 1974 World Cup Squad ==Honours== ;Independiente *Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n (3): Nacional 1967, Metropolitano 1970, Metropolitano 1971 *Copa Libertadores (5): 1965, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975 *Copa Interamericana (3): 1973, 1974, 1976 *Intercontinental Cup (1): 1973 ==References== ==External links== * Futbol Factory profile Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Montevideo Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Defensor Sporting players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente footballers Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Uruguayan expatriate footballers Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Argentina Category:Expatriate footballers in Argentina Category:Uruguay international footballers Category:1974 FIFA World Cup players Category:Association football defenders ",
