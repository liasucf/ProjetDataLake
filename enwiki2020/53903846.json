The zamindari came into being during the later part of the 16th century when Man Singh of Amer was the Dewan/Subahdar of Bengal (1594\u20131606). Their territory was centered around present-day Jhargram district. Jhargram was never an independent territory since the chiefs of the family held it basically as the zamindars of the British Raj in India after Lord Cornwallis's Permanent Settlement of 1793. Although its owners were both rich and powerful, with the chiefs of the family holding the title of Raja, the Jhargram estate was not defined as a Princely State with freedom to decide its future course of action at the time of Indian independence in 1947.Rajput Provinces of India Later, the Vice-Roy of India agreed to recognize Jhargram as \"Princely State\" after the Second World War, but the proposal taken back as the British had decided to give independence to India. Cooch Behar was the only princely state in Bengal and Tripura. There were several princely states in neighboring Orissa, especially Mayurbhanj that had a presence in Kolkata. ==History== Palace of the Rajas Jhargram Raj was founded around 1592 AD by Sarveshwar Singh who along with his elder brother were Generals under Man Singh of Amer and came to conquer Bengal when Emperor Akbar granted Subehdari of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa to Raja Man Singh. He defeated and vanquished the local Mal tribal kings who were ruling the region known as Junglekhand, even today in order to commemorate this victory, every year an idol of Mal Raja is made and slain on Vijayadashami day. As a reward, Raja Man Singh, granted mansabdari of the entire region of Junglekhand to his victorious generals Sarveshwar Singh and his elder brother, under suzerainty and subordination as a tributary vassal state to the Mughal Emperor Akbar. He named his capital Jhargram which means a village surrounded by deep forests, hence the rulers of Jhargram assumed the title \u201cMalla Deb\u201d.Royal Families of India The first fortress was supposed to have existed in Old Jhargram, but the ruins of the fortress are said to have gone underground due to some unknown reasons. He took the title of Raja and named the state capital Jhargram, which means a forest village which is surrounded by walls and canals. It was known as Ugal in the local language. Even today, the day after Durga Ashtami, the four corners (Ugals) are worshiped for the protection of the erstwhile kingdom. The man who was the hero or bull within the surrounded wall and canal were called Ugal Sanda. As such, the full name of the Raja of the State was known as Raja Sarveshwar Malla Ugal Sanda Deb, and the title has been continued up to Raja Narasingha Malla Ugal Sanda Deb. During the Maratha invasion of Bengal between 1741\u201351,the king of Jhargram Raja Man Govind Malla Dev joined his armed forces with the Raja of Bishnupur and the Nawab of Bengal to fight a war against them, and they were victorious. Jhargram remained an independent kingdom until 1767, when The East India Company, led by Robert Clive, came from Midnapore, via Radhanagar to capture the Jhargram fort. The then king of Jhargram Raja Vikramjit Malla Ugal Sanda Deb took part in the Chuar Rebellion to protect his independent status and revolted against the British, but he ultimately surrendered. The kingdom was then recognized as a Zamindari estate under the law of primogeniture, and the ruler was given the title of Raja. Jhargram fell twice into the Court of Wards, after the death of Raja Raghunath Malla Ugal Sanda Deb and Raja Chandi Charan Malla Ugal Sanda Deb, respectively; but was later released when the Raja Narasingha Malla Deb attained majority. In this connection, it may be mentioned that in 1944\u201345, the then Vice-Roy of India agreed to recognize Jhargram as a feudatory state; but at that time, the whole of India was going through turmoil and was moving towards independence. The Cabinet mission came to negotiate with Congress, the Muslim League, and other parties. The proposal for the feudatory status of Jhargram Raj has put aside then. ===Rajas of Jhargram Raj=== Raja Narasingha Malla Deb *Raja Sarveshwar Malla Ugal Sanda Deb, 1st Raja of Jhargram, founder of Royal family of Jhargram. He fortified the new capital with a canal-ed fort known as \u201cUgal\u201d in local language, and respectfully the title of \u201cUgal Sanda\u201d (Lord of the Fort) became part of the name and style of the rulers of Jhargram; married and had issue. ==Administration== The Governor of Bengal at Jhargram Palace The royal family were Zamindars of Jhargram under the British government rule, they were politically powerful and financially wealthy.

Later, similar hospitals were established in every tehsil to serve nearby villages. The raja donated land to the Roman Catholic Church of India and to the Muslim community to build Nurrani Jama Masjid, a mosque, in Jhargram. In 1947, more land was acquired, and the Rani Binode Manjuri Government Girls' School\u2014now one of the premier schools in West Bengal\u2014was built.
