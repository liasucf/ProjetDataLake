Described as \"The British police team was searching Zack Knight and Jasmin Walia for stolen money from the bank. Later, seem they was counting the money.\" The video background was at party club. Background music was composed by Zack Knight. The music tune was made with unique bits, with some English rap. A remake version of this song had changed some lyrics with Knight's vocals and made more Punjabi bits with heavy EDM. The chorus of the song samples vocals from a Bengali folk song, found in a Voice of India sample pack. == Critical reception == Kat Bein of Billboard wrote: \"This track is a super-catchy tune that already featured some great electro elements over its Indian influence.\" Dillon Francis said, \"It's great to see that the original 'Bom Diggy' single was one of the biggest tracks of last year. The remix is a great way to be involved in something with cross- cultural appeal and it's exciting to be involved with a platform that supports independent artists.\" == Music video == The Bom Diggy official music video was released on 24 August 2017 on YouTube. The video was directed by Luke Biggins, Roger Russell and Knight himself. The music video starred Knight and Jasmine Walia.
