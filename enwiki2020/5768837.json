The Lebbas' main contribution to the Kaniyapuram society is the establishment of The Muslim High School, Kaniyapuram. The school was founded by late S Ahmed Kunju Lebba in 1947.

However, this industry is currently on doldrums and struggling for survival. Until three decades, water transport was the main mean of goods transportation from Kaniyapuram. Coconuts and coir products were transported to Kollam and Alappuzha from Kaniyapuram, through Parvathi Puthannaar and Kadinam Lake in large covered wooden boats (kettuvallam) and were loaded from the jetties located at Kadavil, Anakkapilla and Channankara. The water transportation through Parvathi Puthannaar which played a crucial role in the lives of many traders in Kaniyapuram came into disuse after the advent of railways and the National Highways.
