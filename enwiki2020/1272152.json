Rueter's trademarks were his fast-paced pitching style and his large ears. Rueter resides in Nashville, Illinois, with his wife and two daughters and his home is famous for its \"Shed\", a large recreational facility filled with games and sports memorabilia. Rueter also resided at the Shed during the off-seasons of his playing career. When the Giants made trips to St. Louis during the baseball season, Rueter invited the team to relax at his Shed.

His fastball rarely hit 90 mph. He threw changeups, fastballs, sinkers, curveballs, cut fastballs, and sliders. He also was an exceptional fielder, ranking highly in defensive metrics throughout his career.Rueter's Baseball- Reference.com Bullpen page describes him as one of baseball's all-time best fielding pitchers. He posted a career .988 fielding percentage with only seven errors in 581 total chances covering 1918 innings. Some credited the effects of the QuesTec umpiring system to his decline, because Rueter's success came mostly from being able to \"paint the corners\" of the strike zone and the system effectively took that ability away from him because it encouraged umpires to call a tighter strike zone. Rueter was never a strikeout pitcher; he struck out more than a hundred batters in a season only twice in his career. Former teammate Rich Aurilia said, \"He was very, very capable of winning with his stuff because he had confidence in what he could do. He always pitched to what his strengths were.\" ==Personal== Although Rueter never attended the University of North Carolina, he is an avid fan of Tar Heels basketball. ==References== ==External links== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Baseball players from Illinois Category:Fresno Grizzlies players Category:Gulf Coast Expos players Category:Harrisburg Senators players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Montreal Expos players Category:Murray State Racers baseball players Category:Ottawa Lynx players Category:People from Centralia, Illinois Category:People from Nashville, Illinois Category:People from Washington County, Illinois Category:Phoenix Firebirds players Category:Rockford Expos players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Sumter Flyers players ",
