    "text": "Francesco Morini (; born 12 August 1944) is a retired Italian football player, who played as a defender. He competed for the Italian national team in the 1974 FIFA World Cup and earned a total of 11 caps. He played for clubs such as U.C. Sampdoria and, most notably, Juventus F.C., with which he achieved great success. Morini was a fast, strong, and tenacious centreback, with good technique, who was known for his tackling ability, as well as his tight marking of opposing forwards. He was given the nickname \"Morgan\" the pirate as he excelled as a powerful ball-winner; despite his physical style of play, he was also known for his correct behaviour on the pitch, and he rarely committed aggressive challenges. On the pitch, he was also well known for his rivalry with Inter forward Roberto Boninsegna, who later became his teammate. After his retirement he worked as Juventus's sporting director for several years. ==Biography== Morini has two sons; one is Jacopo Morini, who is known for his role in the Italian television program \"Le Iene\", and the other, Andrea, is a singer and guitarist in a band. ==Club career== Morini (left) playing for Juventus in 1974 against his iconic rival of Inter Milan, and future Juventus teammate, Roberto Boninsegna.

He made 387 appearances in Serie A, as well as 30 in Serie B with Sampdoria during the 1966\u201367 season, during which he won the title. During a highly successful domestic and European stint with Juventus, Morini won five Serie A titles, a Coppa Italia during the 1978\u201379 season, and an UEFA Cup during the 1976\u201377 season, also reaching the European Cup final during the 1972\u201373 season, and the semi-final of the European Cup Winners' Cup during the 1979\u201380 season, his final season at the club.
