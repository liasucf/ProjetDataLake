    "text": "Empowerment Statue in front of Waterside Shopping Centre Empowerment is a public sculpture in the centre of the city of Lincoln in England. Designed by the artist Stephen Broadbent, sponsored by Alstom Power (now Siemens), and completed in 2002, the sculpture spans the River Witham in Lincoln's City Square. It takes the form of two aluminium-and-steel human figures reaching to each other across the water. The design is intended to echo the shape of turbine blades, in recognition of Lincoln's industrial heritage. At 16 metres tall, Empowerment is the largest sculpture in Lincolnshire. Increasingly, it is used alongside more traditional images of Lincoln \u2014 the cathedral and castle \u2014 as a recognisable 'tourist emblem' of the cityVisit Lincolnshire (similar to the adoption of the Angel of the North as a symbol of North East England). == References == ==External links== *The sculptor's web site Category:Buildings and structures in Lincoln, England Category:Outdoor sculptures in England Category:Tourist attractions in Lincolnshire Category:2002 sculptures Category:Aluminium sculptures in the United Kingdom Category:Steel sculptures in England ",
