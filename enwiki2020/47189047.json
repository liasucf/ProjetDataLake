She also meets Cole (Tyron Leitso), who owns Cole's Pet Stop. She meets Jonathan (Oliver Rice) at an art gallery; he has a dog named Eve, a dalmatian.

David Hinckley of New York Daily News wrote: \"You wouldn't think a Hallmark movie that stars a plucky, winsome blond and several lovable dogs could miss. My Boyfriends' Dogs almost does. It's got too much of the right stuff to be a complete mutt, but most Hallmark movies are better written and crafted than this one.\" Nancy Dunham of The Washington Times gave a mixed review, writing: \"Erika Christensen brings a sense of realism to the role, even when some dialogue seems a bit preachy and scenes might stretch credibility a tad far... Like Walt Disney films, My Boyfriends' Dogs isn't going to make a huge impact on art, but it might show the best way to be true to one's heart.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 television films Category:American television films Category:American films Category:American comedy films ",
