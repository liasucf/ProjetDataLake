    "text": "The Smoking Stump was a band formed in 1983 in Dallas, by brothers Dick and Richard Van Richard (Dick) Interview with the Smoking Stump: Rolling Stone, issue 361, vol. 2, page 1.. Dick was playing cowbell at the time, though he quickly switched to rhythm guitar. Richard continued to play bass guitar with his custom six-string basses. They recruited Dan Chuckup for lead vocals, Wayne Lyle Gary Dwayne on keyboards and trumpet, Dack \u2018Animal\u2019 Dackey on drums, their mother, who goes to college, and Floyd (no last name known) on lead guitar. After two months, however, Floyd was kicked out by Dick during an argument over the relative merits of weed and crack. After a long search, the two Richards found a guitar player and innovator named Dim Phlubber. With him, they were ready to perform, and they began regularly playing at Dallas shows through the end of 1983Interview with the Smoking Stump: Rolling Stone, issue 361, vol. 2, page 3.. == Rise to popularity == After several offensive and tasteless names, the band decided on calling the band Smoking Stump Interview with the Smoking Stump: Rolling Stone, issue 361, vol. 2, page 13. They began playing larger and larger gigs, extremely underpricing tickets so that they would have an audience. Nonetheless, they continued to get more and more popular, mostly due to the band\u2019s onstage antics. Chuckup\u2019s style of singing, which included only singing in the range higher than when his voice would crack, drew girls from all around, and Phlubber\u2019s increasing experimentation kept audiences on their feet.Interview with the Smoking Stump: Rolling Stone, issue 361, vol. 2, page 15. This included tuning all his strings to F# and playing his guitar not with a pick, but rubbing the whole guitar against a double bass. Coupled with Dick\u2019s power chord rhythms, this created a dynamic sound that brought newfound popularity. === Heck and collapse of the band === With their newfound touring wealth, the band was ready to go into the studio and record their first album. It was originally entitled Hell, but the Richard\u2019s mother contacted them and told them they were not allowed to say curse words, so the title was changed to Heck (Our Mother Wouldn\u2019t Let Us Say Anything Else.) Though many people assumed this was a joke, it was not. The album was recorded with producer Johnny Holmes at Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. The album sold 500,000 copies, bolstered by their two singles \u2018Fire is Fun\u2019 and \u2018 Couch Potato.\u2019Billboard Hit Singles list, 1985. Both of these featured Richard\u2019s two-handed tapping on his custom six-string basses for the guitar solos. But the real seller for the album was Dick\u2019s guitar showcase, the sixteen-minute epic \u2018Ford Prius.\u2019 Dick had spent several weeks building a 148-string guitar synthesizer out of phosphorus, which had to be kept in an enormous tank of milk to avoid exploding. Linked to an enormous stack of twenty-three Fender AC30 amps, Dick created a sound incomparable to anything else previously recorded. Playing his guitar, nicknamed \u2018The Bowling Ball,\u2019 in the tank of milk with a scuba mask, Dick played one take of the song for sixteen straight minutes, while Richard jammed along on bass and Animal broke his drumsticks seven times 'The Incredible True Story of 'Ford Prius' by the Smoking Stump,' Guitar World interview, August 1986 issue, page 37.. The resulting tune was incredible. Very unfortunately, as the Stump watched mesmerized, the final epic virtuoso solo played so loud it cracked open the tank of milk, exposing the phosphorus-bodied guitar to the air. Immediately it exploded, engulfing the Stump in flames as their producer watched in horror. In that moment, the entire glorious future of the Stump was destroyed, in the creation of one of the greatest guitar moments in the history of the universe. All the other songs were already finished, and Holmes released the album on Halloween, 1984, to popular acclaim. Two years later he released an outtake and live track album entitled Don\u2019t Cross the Devil.
