    "text": "South Page Community School District, or South Page Schools, is a small, rural, public school district headquartered in College Springs, Iowa. It is entirely in Page County, and includes College Springs, Blanchard, Braddyville, Coin, and Shambaugh. ==History== It was formed in 1959 by combining the Braddyville, Coin, Amity (College Springs), and Blanchard consolidated districts which included Shambaugh. Although the elementary and grades 7\u201312 are housed in College Springs, at one time there were two elementary schools located in Braddyville and Coin. The high school has always been located in College Springs. The 1960 K\u201312 enrollment was approximately 600 but enrollment has plummeted to less than 200 students. Although some of the sharp decline is due to an open enrollment policy in Iowa, the great majority is due to population shift in rural areas as a result of smaller families, larger farms and lack of economic opportunity. ==Schools== The district operates two schools on one campus in College Springs: *South Page Elementary School *South Page Senior High School ===South Page High School=== ==== Athletics==== The Rebels compete in the Corner Conference in the following sports: *Cross Country (boys and girls) **Boys' 2-time State Champions (1959, 1960) *Volleyball *Football *Basketball (boys and girls) *Wrestling *Track and Field (boys and girls) *Golf (boys and girls) *Baseball *Softball ==Notable Alumni== *Joe Henderson, a former state champion miler and now a leading author on running *Norman Johnston, one of America's top decathletes in the 1960s. ==See also== *List of school districts in Iowa *List of high schools in Iowa ==References== ==External links== * South Page Community School District * Category:Education in Page County, Iowa Category:School districts established in 1959 Category:School districts in Iowa Category:Public high schools in Iowa Category:1959 establishments in Iowa ",
