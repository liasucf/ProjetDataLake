Drowned drumlin in Clew Bay, Ireland A drumlin, from the Irish word droimn\u00edn (\"littlest ridge\"), first recorded in 1833, in the classical sense is an elongated hill in the shape of an inverted spoon or half-buried eggMenzies(1979) quoted in Benn, D.I. & Evans, D.J.A. 2003 Glaciers & Glaciation, Arnold, London (p431) formed by glacial ice acting on underlying unconsolidated till or ground moraine. Clusters of drumlins create a landscape which is often described as having a 'basket of eggs topography'.http://geoschol.com/counties/CAVAN_GEOLOGY.pdf ==Morphology== Drumlins occur in various shapes and sizes, including symmetrical (about the long axis), spindle, parabolic forms, and transverse asymmetrical forms; their long axis is parallel to the direction of movement of the formative flow at the time of formation. Drumlins are typically long, less than high and between wide. Drumlins generally have a length:width ratio of between 1:2 and 1:3.5, with the questionable assumption that more elongate forms correspond to faster ice motion. That is, since ice flows in laminar flow, the resistance to flow is frictional and depends on area of contact; elongate, subglacial landforms produced by ice would represent relatively slow flow rates. ==Occurrence== Drumlins and drumlin clusters are glacial landforms composed primarily of glacial till. They form near the margin of glacial systems, and within zones of fast flow deep within ice sheets, and are commonly found with other major glacially-formed features (including tunnel valleys, eskers, scours, and exposed bedrock erosion). Drumlins are often in drumlin fields of similarly shaped, sized and oriented hills. Many Pleistocene drumlin fields are observed to occur in a fan-like distribution. The M\u00falaj\u00f6kull drumlins of Hofsj\u00f6kull are also arrayed in a splayed fan distribution around an arc of 180\u00b0. == Composition == Drumlins may comprise layers of clay, silt, sand, gravel and boulders in various proportions; perhaps indicating that material was repeatedly added to a core, which may be of rock or glacial till. Alternatively, drumlins may be residual, with the landforms resulting from erosion of material between the landforms. The dilatancy of glacial till was invoked as a major factor in drumlin formation.Smalley, I.J., Unwin, D.J. 1968. The formation and shape of drumlins and their distribution and orientation in drumlin fields. Journal of Glaciology 7, 377-390 In other cases, drumlin fields include drumlins made up entirely of hard bedrock (e.g. granite or well-lithified limestone).Lesemann, J., Brennand, T.A., 2009. Regional reconstruction of subglacial hydrology and glaciodynamic behaviour along the southern margin of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in British Columbia, Canada and Northern Washington State, USA. Quaternary Science Reviews 28, 2420\u20132444. These drumlins cannot be explained by the addition of soft sediment to a core. Thus, accretion and erosion of soft sediment by processes of subglacial deformation do not present unifying theories for all drumlins\u2014some are composed of residual bedrock. == Formation == There are two main theories of drumlin formation: constructional, in which they form as sediment is shaped, for example by subglacial deformation; and remnant/erosional, which proposes that drumlins form by erosion of material from an unconsolidated bed. A hypothesis that catastrophic sub-glacial floods form drumlins by deposition or erosion challenges conventional explanations for drumlins.Shaw, J., 2002. The meltwater hypothesis for subglacial bedforms. Quaternary International 90, 5-22. It includes deposition of glaciofluvial sediment in cavities scoured into a glacier bed by subglacial meltwater, and remnant ridges left behind by erosion of soft sediment or hard rock by turbulent meltwater. This hypothesis requires huge, subglacial meltwater floods, each of which would raise sea level by tens of centimetres in a few weeks. Studies of erosional forms in bedrock at French River, Ontario, Canada provide evidence for such floods. The recent retreat of a marginal outlet glacier of Hofsj\u00f6kull in IcelandA satellite image of the region of Hofsj\u00f6kull where drumlin growth has been observed (see ). The drumlins can be observed between pools of water. exposed a drumlin field with more than 50 drumlins ranging from in length, in width, and in height. These formed through a progression of subglacial depositional and erosional processes, with each horizontal till bed within the drumlin created by an individual surge of the glacier. The above theory for the formation of these Icelandic drumlins best explains one type of drumlin. However, it does not provide a unifying explanation of all drumlins. For example, drumlin fields including drumlins composed entirely of hard bedrock cannot be explained by deposition and erosion of unconsolidated beds. Furthermore, hairpin scours around many drumlins are best explained by the erosive action of horseshoe vortices around obstacles in a turbulent boundary layer.Paik, J., Escauriaza, C., Sotiropoulos, F., 2007. On the bimodal dynamics of the turbulent horseshoe vortex system in a wing-body junction. Physics of Fluids, 19, 045107 1-20.Shaw, J., 1994. Hairpin erosional marks, horseshoe vortices and subglacial erosion. Sedimentary Geology 92, 169-283. Erosion under a glacier in the immediate vicinity of a drumlin can be on the order of a meter's depth of sediment per year, with the eroded sediment forming a drumlin as it is repositioned and deposited. ==Soil development on drumlins== Recently formed drumlins often incorporate a thin \"A\" soil horizon (often referred to as \"'topsoil'\" which accumulated after formation) and a thin \"Bw\" horizon (commonly referred to as \"'subsoil'\"). The \"C\" horizon, which shows little evidence of being affected by soil forming processes (weathering), is close to the surface, and may be at the surface on an eroded drumlin. Below the C horizon the drumlin consists of multiple beds of till deposited by lodgment and bed deformation. On drumlins with longer exposure (e.g. in the Lake Ontario drumlin field in New York State) soil development is more advanced, for example with the formation of clay-enriched \"Bt\" horizons. ==Examples of drumlins== Drumlin field in Western New York state. The drumlins align with glacial flow. ===Europe=== The retreat of Icelandic glacier M\u00falaj\u00f6kull, which is an outlet glacier of Hofsj\u00f6kull, recently exposed a 50 drumlin cluster, which serves as the basis for improved understanding of drumlin formation. The literature also documents extensive drumlin fields in England, Scotland and Wales, Switzerland, Poland, Estonia (Vooremaa), Latvia, Sweden, around Lake Constance north of the Alps, County Leitrim, County Monaghan, County Mayo and County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland, County Fermanagh, County Armagh, and in particular County Down in Northern Ireland, Germany, Hindsholm in Denmark, Finland and Greenland. ===North America=== The majority of drumlins observed in North America were formed during the Wisconsin glaciation. The largest drumlin fields in the world formed beneath the Laurentide Ice Sheet and are found in Canada \u2014 Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, northern Saskatchewan, northern Manitoba, northern Ontario and northern Quebec.Shaw, J., Sharp, D., Harris, J., 2010. A flowline map of glaciated Canada based on remote sensing data. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. 47, 89-101. Drumlins occur in every Canadian province and territory.
