He received the customary knighthood on his appointment. He was elected to an honorary fellowship of Jesus College in 1972. He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1973 and was sworn as a member of the Privy Council accordingly. He had a reputation as a hard-working judge.

He was a member of the Parole Board from its foundation in 1967 to 1970 (serving as deputy-chairman in 1970). He chaired the 1971 Tribunal of Enquiry into the failure of the Vehicle and General Insurance Company. He later led the committee considering the distribution of work between the Crown Courts and the Magistrates' Courts, which reported in 1976. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Warwickshire in 1967, and was a Trustee of the Barber Institute of Fine Arts from 1974 until his death. He always considered himself to be a Birmingham man and continued to live there despite his judicial appointments in various locations. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:Royal Pioneer Corps soldiers Category:Royal Corps of Signals officers Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Warwickshire Category:English barristers Category:Lords Justices of Appeal Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People educated at Caterham School Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Queen's Bench Division judges Category:Queen's Counsel 1901\u20132000 ",
