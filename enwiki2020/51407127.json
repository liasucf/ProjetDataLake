    "text": "The Logan Express is an airport bus shuttle which operates between Boston Logan International Airport and Massachusetts suburbs. The service, which is funded by Massport, consists of five routes that run between all of Logan Airport's terminals and the towns of Braintree, Framingham, Peabody, Woburn, and the Boston neighborhood of Back Bay. Each route runs direct between the airport and its suburban terminus on a set schedule. The Logan Express operates using motorcoach-style buses on most of its routes, except for Back Bay, which uses Massport owned airport shuttle buses. Passengers traveling to Logan Airport on the service are dropped off at each terminal's departures level, while passengers taking the service from the airport are picked up on the arrivals level at designated curbs. Buses make onboard announcements detailing which terminal stop passengers should disembark at, depending on which airline they are flying. Massport considers the Logan Express to be a part of its strategy to reduce traffic congestion at the airport, improving passenger experience and reducing the environmental impact of traveling to the airport. Riders are encouraged to park at lots located at each of the suburban terminals (except for Back Bay). ==Routes== In addition to their suburban terminus, all Logan Express routes make five stops at Logan Airport: Terminal A, two stops at Terminal B, Terminal C, and Terminal E. On outbound trips, buses depart Terminal A at the time listed on their schedule, with departures from the following terminals occurring sequentially after. ===Back Bay=== A Back Bay Logan Express bus, the only route to use transit-style buses Buses to Back Bay are operated by Massport and make two stops in the neighborhood, at Hynes Convention Center and the MBTA's Back Bay station.

Currently, a route to North Station is in the planning stages, primarily fueled by the success of the intra-city Back Bay route. Additionally, a new route to an undisclosed suburban location is expected within the next five years, along with online ticket reservations. Massport states that their future Logan Express improvement plans are expected to double ridership and will remove up to three million vehicle trips from the roads in and around Logan Airport. ==References== ==External links== * Logan Express Site Category:Logan International Airport Category:Bus transportation in Massachusetts Category:Bus transportation in the Boston area Category:Transportation in Braintree, Massachusetts Category:Airport bus services ",
