Das gro\u00dfe Lexikon der DEFA-Spielfilme. . Page 384. It was a musical comedy, one of the pictures which authors Antonin and Mira Liehm considered as an attempt by DEFA to balance the effects its heavily ideological works had on the public.Miera Liehm, Antonin J. Liehm . The Most Important Art: Soviet and Eastern European Film After 1945. . Page 265. Although it was light-hearted, director G\u00fcnter Reisch emphasized the happiness experienced by the citizens in the socialist system and the importance of the chemical plants' development - one of them served as the setting for the plot. The director's decision was influenced by the response to his last film, the 1957 Trail in the Night, which was negatively received by the State Film Board due to a scene featuring rock-and-roll music.Dagmar Schittly.

West Germany's Catholic Film Service noted that the picture \"had a weak script, but its momentum and cabaret scenes compensate for it.\" In the same time, the comical character of the eccentric politician Frisch was criticized by the East German Film Board. The Liehms considered it as one of \"the two smoothest\" among the \"poorly crafted, simple minded\" East German comedies of the late 1950s, along its 1960 sequel New Year's Eve Punch. Ralf Schenk wrote that the film was an attempt to create comedy combined with \"slogans praising the Socialist society and the qualities of chemical ingredients.\"Ralf Schenk.
