    "text": "Gibbaeum is a genus of about 21 species of small succulent plants of the family Aizoaceae, indigenous to the Little Karoo region of South Africa. The name \"Gibbaeum\" comes from the Latin gibbosus (hunchback) ==Description== Gibbaeum pubescens in natural habitat. These dwarf succulents are characterized by distinctively asymmetrical pairs of leaves, mostly globular or sometimes thick and arcuate. The sizes of the leaves of each pair are nearly always different. Gibbaeums grow in clumps and produce pink or white flowers in spring.http://www.succulentguide.com/cactus/?genus=Gibbaeumhttp://redlist.sanbi.org/genus.php?genus=114 ==Distribution== Genus Gibbaeum is predominantly indigenous to the Little Karoo region of the Western Cape Province, South Africa. A few species extend outside of this region. Three species extend north into the Great Karoo region: Gibbaeum gibbosum, Gibbaeum heathii and Gibbaeum nuciforme. Two extend south into the Overberg region: Gibbaeum esterhuyseniae and Gibbaeum hartmannianum. ==Cultivation== Sunny exposure and well drained soil. Their natural range spans the boundary between winter and summer rainfall areas of southern Africa, and their growth period (emergence of new leaves and flowering) is therefore in summer for some species and in winter for other ones. However, overall most species can be watered primarily in winter. Temperature must stay above 10 \u00b0C in winter. Propagation can be done by cuttings or by seeds. Many of the species hybridise easily - with each other and with the related genus Muiria. ==List of species== * Gibbaeum album * Gibbaeum angulipes * Gibbaeum blackburniae * Gibbaeum comptonii * Gibbaeum dispar * Gibbaeum esterhuyseniae * Gibbaeum geminum * Gibbaeum gibbosum * Gibbaeum hartmannianum * Gibbaeum heathii * Gibbaeum luckhofii * Gibbaeum nebrownii * Gibbaeum nuciforme * Gibbaeum pachypodium * Gibbaeum petrense * Gibbaeum pilosulum * Gibbaeum pubescens * Gibbaeum schwantesii * Gibbaeum velutinum File:Z Gibbaeum album growing among rocks - RSA.jpg|Gibbaeum album File:Gibbaeum dispar IMG 2483.jpg|Gibbaeum dispar File:Gibbaeum geminum - SBG 2.jpg|Gibbaeum geminum File:4 Gibbaeum gibbosum -Touwsrivier - Copy.jpg|Gibbaeum gibbosum File:5 Gibbaeum hartmannianum - Overberg Malgas - Copy.jpg|Gibbaeum hartmannianum File:Gibbaeum heathii varieties.jpg|Gibbaeum heathii forms File:Gibbaeum velutinum barrydale.jpg|Gibbaeum velutinum File:6 Gibbaeum petrense Brandvlei Rd - Copy.jpg|Gibbaeum petrense File:Gibbaeum pubescens - N Barrydale 2.jpg|Gibbaeum pubescens File:1 Gibbaeum shandii - Kirstenbosch gardens.jpg|Gibbaeum pubescens var. shandii File:Gibbaeum schwantesii IMG 1568.jpg|Gibbaeum schwantesii File:Gibbaeum pilosulum in cultivation - cape town.jpg|Gibbaeum pilosulum File:Gibbaeum nuciforme.jpg|Gibbaeum nuciforme File:Gibbaeum nebrownii.jpg|Gibbaeum nebrownii ==References== ==External links== * photos on www.AIAPS.org Category:Aizoaceae genera ",
