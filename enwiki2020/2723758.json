It was one of the first neighborhoods in the greater Minneapolis area to adopt organic waste recycling, a relatively new waste management solution, and has been used as an example of a successful organics recycling. The city of Minneapolis placed a curbside organic waste pickup pilot program in ECCO in 2015. ECCO also has pioneered programs such as \"Waste Watchers\", a recycling and organics program designed to raise awareness and strengthen community ties to waste reduction, as well as the Turn Off Lights Behind You (TOLBY) program, designed to help families and children remember to turn off lights in unoccupied rooms in their households to reduce energy consumption. ==References== ==External links== *Minneapolis Neighborhood Profile - East Calhoun *East Calhoun Community Organization Category:Neighborhoods in Minneapolis ",
