    "text": "Mandy Wilkinson (born 1970, Manchester) is a British painter. She graduated from Cumbria College of Art and Design with a first class degree in 1994. Predominantly an abstract painter whose individual paintings cross the boundaries between the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional, gestural painterliness and flat monochrome blocks of colour. In August 2009 her dealer, David Godfrey, claimed she was the most copied living artist. Both Wilkinson and Godfrey, the curator of Central London's Gallery 94, said mass production art studios in China had made her a favourite and reproduced countless numbers of her works which had returned to the market as 'originals'. Wilkinson sells her paintings for \u00a32,000 to \u00a36,000 while the Chinese copies were selling for \u00a345. Reading the article of The Independent, published September 3rd 2009, Mrs. Wilkinson notes that she never placed a signature on the front of one of her paintings. This reference may help to identify the originality of a canvas. Wilkinson lives in near Llangollen, North Wales. ==References== ==External links== *Gallery at 94 *Mandy Wilkinson on AxisWeb *Article in The Independent 3 September 2009 Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Manchester Category:British women painters Category:Abstract painters Category:20th-century British women artists Category:21st-century British women artists ",
