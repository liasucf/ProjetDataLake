    "text": "Piastowski Square is a large and important square in downtown Bydgoszcz, bearing several buildings registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. ==Location== Piastowski Square is settled north of Dworcowa Street, west of Gda\u0144ska Street. It is delineated by \u015aniadecki, Chrobrego, Wile\u0144ska and Sowi\u0144skiego streets. It has approximately the size of a 140m by 100m rectangle, with its longer axis oriented NW-SE. ==History== This vast square dates back to the creation of Sniadecki Street, after the second half of the 19th century. It has always kept its original functions, as a marketplace, hence its original name Elisabethmarkt, after Elisabeth Stra\u00dfe, original name of Sniadecki Street. The area is roughly depicted on an 1857 map of Bromberg,1857 Plan_von_Bromberg_u_Umgegend_Berlin 1857 but earliest documented reference appears in the 1870s, with a mention in the 1872 city address book. Through history, the square bore the following names: * 1870s-1920, Elisabeth Markt, in honor of Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria, wife of the reigning King of Prussia, Frederick William IV of Prussia * 1920\u20131940, Piastowski Square;Plan Miasta Bydgoszczy, 1933 * 1940\u20131945, Dr. Goebbels Platz;Stadt Bauamt, Bromberg, 10 VII 1941 * Since 1945, Piastowski Square (). The current namesake comes from the Piast dynasty, first historical ruling dynasty of Poland, which started with Prince Miesko I in 960 and ended with Casimir III the Great in 1370. ==Main places and buildings== ===Tenement at No.1, corner with Sowi\u0144skiego Street=== 1889 Eclecticism The first owner of the building at Elisabeth Markt 10 was August Zu\u00df.

File:Piastowski 3.jpg|Current facade on the square ===Tenement at No.4=== 1895-1896 Eclecticism Original address was Elisabeth Markt 12: its first owner was a wood manufacturer, Julius Gendal. The main elevation displays its original architectural details, in contrast with No.2. Facade shows symmetric features, left and right of the main gate, especially stacked balustrade areas, either balcony or loggias on both extremities.

Although deprived from some architectural details, one can still appreciate the symmetric facade centered on the two balconies, the first floor windows with pediments, cartouches, balustrade, and the top thin frieze with floral motifs. File:Piastowski 7.jpg|View of the main elevation from the square ===Tenement at No.9=== 1884-1885 Eclecticism First address was Elisabeth Markt 6a, first owner was August Kopplow, an administrative assistant.

File:Piastowski 9.jpg|Main frontage ===Tenement at No.11, corner with Wile\u0144ska Street=== 1886-1887 Eclecticism First address was Elisabeth Markt 6, the first owner being a rentier, Fritz D\u00f6rnbrack, who lived at Elisabeth Stra\u00dfe 11, now \u015aniadecki Street 37. The elevation, recently refurbished (2016), shows evident Neo-Classicist features. Symmetry of both facades, plain pedimented windows and carved cartouches with children figures. The main gate is flanked by two lean columns.

In 1910, the edifice moved to the hands of Carl Rose, a famous architect in Bromberg living on Danzigerstra\u00dfe 29. The renovated corner house displays several architectural details, characteristic of Eclecticism. One can underline in particular: * the corner tower, with a large balustrade-corbel featured balcony, topped by a tented roof cupola ; * bay windows on each facade, with loggias, columns and a pediment showing a floral decorated tympanum; * round pediments on the first floor, with floral ornament.

First owners were: \\- August G\u00fcnther (No.13 and 15), a wood trader, living at No.13; \\- Adolf R\u00f6hr (No.17) a restaurateur, who ran his business at the same address. Today, the place still houses a restaurant. The architect Karl Bergner realized these buildings with the same pattern in mind. No.13 and 15 mirrored each other in perfect symmetry: only some ornamentation details differ. One can appreciate the large gates with a round glass transom light, crowned with a stylish motif and the pedimented first floor windows. No.13 facade retains bit more architectural details, such as additional head figures, and a left part of the elevation with richer decoration (pilasters, stucco ornaments). No.17 breaks the symmetry, with thicker bossage lines on the ground level and the absence of architectural details present at No.13 and 15. Still noticeable is the main gate with a transom light, flanked by pilasters topped by floral and puttoes motif.

He also owned the tenement at \u015aniadecki Street No.57. Recently renovated, the elevation is remarkable by its wooden bay window capped by a tented roof, overhanging the corner. A long frieze runs on both frontages.

The building strikes by its original shape and its rich architectural decoration. The facade is asymmetrical, the only bay window is unbalanced, with quarter circle wrought-iron balconies flanking its left side. Both balconies have a bear cub holding a shield that stands in the corner: it is a reminder of the past activity of a metal craftwork company in the district. A elaborate frieze runs between first and second level, and two windows are topped with triangular pediments: the one on the right side is adorned with a bas-relief of bearded male head with a hat. On the top of the facade stands a sundial, neighboured by two finials. At street level, one can notice the grand portal, crowned by a mask of a beast.

No.47 was the one he was registered as living in. The long facade, with only one floor boasts a beautiful decoration on top of the gate, with two sphinx like woman figured shapes support another vegetal decoration with a mask. Traces of pilasters are still visible on the first floor, crowned by a full-length balustrade. The two ogee gables are also ornamented.

In Bromberg's time, address was Elisabethstra\u00dfe 25.: owners were registered as \"Ms Sendler and Genossen\". In 1915, an architect, Walter Findeisen, lived in this house. The building houses today the Honorary Consul of the Federal Republic of Germany in Bydgoszcz The tenement stands out of the local urban environment with its lean and high features. Due to its late inception (1910s), the building has been erected according to late Art Nouveau canons, thus it catches the eye among late 19th century edifices. The house architecture is underlined on the one hand by long vertical lines without any ornament (art), broken up on the first floor by horizontal bossages, and on the other hand by two massive bay windows and a modest bartizan. Building's elevation has been refurbished in 2015\u20132016.

The building was designed for renting. The elevation is essentially remarkable by the impressive decorated balconies with Neo-Baroque accents: balustrades, heavy corbels, pilasters around the openings and a highly ornamented grand lintel on the second floor.

The building has been home place of Szczepan Jankowski, a Polish blind composer, organist and conductor of the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. A memorial plaque has been unveiled on November 8, 2010.Uchwala No.LXVIII/1061/10 Rady Miasta Bydgoszczy, 30th June 2010 Compared to No.53, No.55 is even more remarkable by its Neo-Baroque balconies complex. Both balconies flank a large bay window adorned with bossage and pilasters. Railings are adorned with wavy circle shapes placed like rosettes.

Since 1956, the left tenement houses the family-run bakery \"KP\", established in 1922 by Franciszek Po\u0107wiardowski. Today the ground floor of the right building houses 1956-established ice cream firm \"Lodziarnia \u017bak\". Although from the 1870s, the left elevation has been rebuilt and presents early Art Nouveau elements like the vegetal ornaments on the wavy shaped gable. Right facade displays early modernist elements, expressed in the very shape of the elevation, with the round bay window topped by a balcony, and the multitude of narrow and thin openings.
