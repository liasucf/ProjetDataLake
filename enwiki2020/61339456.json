    "text": "The 2019\u201320 HockeyAllsvenskan season was the 15th season that the second tier of Swedish ice hockey has operated under that name. The series consisted of 14 teams playing a regular season in which each team played each other team four times, twice at home and twice away. This was followed by a series of promotion and relegation tournaments, with the teams finishing first through eight participating in promotion playoffs, and the teams finishing 13th and 14th forced to requalify to avoid relegation to the Hockeyettan. However, after the regular season, on 15 March 2020 the Swedish Ice Hockey Association (SIHA) cancelled the post-season due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. No teams will be promoted nor relegated to or from HockeyAllsvenskan, and the next season of HockeyAllsvenskan will feature the same teams. https://www.swehockey.se/Nyheter/nyheterfransvenskaishockeyforbundet/2020/Mars2020/svenskaishockeyforbundetsstyrelseharenhalligtbeslutatattavslutasasongen20192020/ Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6ven won the regular season with a record-setting 121 points, beating the previous record of 109 points. ==Participating teams== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
