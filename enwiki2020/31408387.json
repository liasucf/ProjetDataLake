    "text": "Wassonite is an extremely rare titanium sulfide mineral with chemical formula TiS. Its discovery was announced in a 2011 NASA press release as a single small grain within an enstatite chondrite meteorite called \"Yamato 691\", which was found during a 1969 Japanese expedition to Antarctica. This grain represents the first observation in nature of the synthetic compound titanium(II) sulfide. The mineral was named after John T. Wasson, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and was approved by the International Mineralogical Association. == References == Category:Sulfide minerals Category:Titanium minerals Category:Trigonal minerals ",
