In 1886, 78.4% of the Christian population of the Florina kaza (district) - a part of Manastir Vilayet (province) - was aligned with the Ecumenical Patriarchate and 21.6% with the Bulgarian Exarchate, however by 1900 the Patriarchatists had dropped to 50.9% and Exarchatists had risen to 49.1%.Richard Clogg, Minorities in Greece: Aspects of a Plural Society, pp. 123-124 In 1914 the majority of the Christian population of the Florina district was recorded as Bulgarian (59%), 70% of whom were monolingual in Bulgarian only. The 1920s was a period of deportation and migration, during which the Greek government aimed the systematic removal of the Bulgarophone population. In 1925, according to the Prefect of Florina 52% of the population were schismatics(up from about 20% in 1886), 25% were Patriarchists, 15% were refugees, 6% were Vlachs and 3% were indigenous Greeks. According to government source in 1925 there were 45,527 Slav speakers, of whom 34,234 former Exarchists and 11,293 former Patriarchists; 7449 Greek refugees; 3590 Vlachs; 1882 native Greeks; 349 Jews and 27 Muslims Albanians. According to Kollopoulos in 1925 the recorded Slav Macedonians were 64,465 and constituted 64% of the population of the district of Florina, of whom 28,673 were schismatic. The 1928 census showed 38,562 Slavic speakers in the nome of Florina or 31% of the population, but according to contemporary Greek authors the numbers of this census \"clearly\" do not reflect the actual strength as a result of official policy of the Greek government of reluctance. According to the Prefect of Florina P. Kalligas in 1930 there were 76,370 (61%), of whom 61,950 (49% of the population) lacked Greek consciousness, while his successor V. Balkos estimates those speaking Bulgarian as 75-80% of the population of the nome in 1931. According to the Prefect of Florina, in 1935 of 11,683 families 56% had Slavic national consciousness , while 41.3% were \"foreign speakers\" with Greek national consciousness According to the 2011 census, the population of Florina regional unit was 51,414 people. The local Greek population includes a linguistic minority of bilingual Slavophones, who in the early 1990s formed about 64% of the rural population and about 16% of the prefecture's total population.Usage des langues minoritaires dans les d\u00e9partements de Florina et d\u2019Aridea (Mac\u00e9doine); Riki Van Boeschoten Anastasia Karakasidou estimated that 80% of the population of Florina Prefecture is either Slavic-speaking or descended from Slavic-speaking families. There are also around 1,200 Slavophones\u2014approximately 2% of the local population\u2014who profess an ethnic Macedonian identity.In the 2009 European elections in Greece, 1,195 people from Florina Prefecture voted for the Rainbow Party, which represents what it regards as the ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece.
