    "text": "is a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Ishikawa Prefecture. He made his debut in March 2017 and wrestles for Miyagino stable. His highest rank has been maegashira 4. He is shorter and weighs significantly less than the vast majority of sumo wrestlers in the upper ranks, but has learned to use his small stature and size for maximum advantage, becoming known for toppling larger opponents. He has achieved one special prize for Technique. ==Early life and sumo background== Y\u016bya Nakamura's father supported the family by working at a newspaper. Nakamura first started practicing sumo at the age of five, due to the influence of his older brother. In primary school he also was goal keeper for a school water polo team. At the area middle school, he was in the sumo club with the future Kagayaki. In his 3rd year, the team that he and future Kagayaki were members of took the team championship in the middle school prefectural tournament. Nakamura went on to Kanazawa Gakuin, a high school in his city. In his third year there he took the gold medal in the 2012 World Junior Sumo Championships in the lightweight division. He continued to Kanazawa Gakuin University and majored in sports medicine. In his first year, he was the champion of the West Japan New Student Athlete Sumo Tournament, and in his second and third years he won the World Amateur Sumo Championship two years in a row. In all, he acquired ten titles. Seriously interested in joining pro sumo, Nakamura was interviewed at a number of stables before graduating, and upon finishing university, he joined Miyagino stable.Sumo Magazine\u300e\u76f8\u64b2\u300f2018 March issue p.22-23 ==Career== Nakamura became an attendant and apprentice to yokozuna Hakuh\u014d. Hakuh\u014d chose the shikona Enh\u014d for him, with \"en\" meaning fiery and \"h\u014d\" meaning the Chinese mythological bird Peng, which is also the h\u014d in the yokozuna's own name. He participated in maezum\u014d in the March 2017 tournament alongside future Wakatakakage. In the ceremony to debut new recruits on day 5, he wore the ceremonial apron, or kesho-mawashi, that his mentor Hakuh\u014d was to start using from that day. However, Hakuh\u014d ended up taking injury leave from the tournament on that same day. \"In Enh\u014d's new recruits debut ceremony he says the yokozuna's kesho-mawashi is \"heavy\" Nikkan Sports 2017 March 17 Enh\u014d's first pro tournament was the following May, starting at the bottom in the jonokuchi division. He was undefeated at 7\u20130 and took the championship. After this tournament he changed his second name in his full shikona title from his real name Y\u016bya, to the name Akira. The name Akira honored his mentor at his dojo, named Akira, who died in a motorcycle accident nine years previously. In the following July tournament, he again had a perfect 7\u20130 record, and after a playoff took the championship. In the playoff, he beat former makuuchi wrestler Masunoyama who was in his first full tournament back in sumo, after a series of injury leaves. The win against Masunoyama was shitatenage which would become Enho's signature move. For the following September tournament, Enh\u014d was promoted to the sandanme division and once again took a perfect 7\u20130, this time winning a playoff versus Matsuda. For the November tournament he was promoted to the makushita division. In this tournament Enh\u014d was approaching an all time record for consecutive wins from entry into sumo. However, in his first bout he lost to former komusubi J\u014dk\u014dry\u016b who himself holds the record for most consecutive wins upon entering sumo. Enh\u014d ended the tournament with a 5\u20132 record. In the following January tournament, he was ranked at makushita 6 and achieved a 4\u20133 winning tournament. In most cases, at his rank with this record he would not have been promoted to the next division, the salaried ranks of j\u016bry\u014d. However, several j\u016bry\u014d wrestlers had records bad enough to be demoted from the division, and Enh\u014d was promoted to fill one of the many open slots there. Not including makushita tsukedashi wrestlers, who are allowed to debut at a higher rank, this promotion meant Enh\u014d tied the record for the fastest ever wrestler promoted to sekitori at six tournaments from his professional debut. For this March 2018 tournament, Enh\u014d was ranked at the bottom rung, at j\u016bry\u014d 14. As is often the case for a first timer in the salaried ranks, the wall was too high and he only managed a losing tournament record of 4\u201311 and was demoted back to makushita. After two strong performances of 5\u20132 in the upper ranks of makushita, Enh\u014d was re-promoted to j\u016bry\u014d for the September tournament. In this tournament and the next two, he recorded three straight 9-6 records. In the following March tournament, he made the news after he came back from a near loss to Tokush\u014dry\u016b on day 9. Enh\u014d's haunches came within 10 centimetres of the dohy\u014d, before he bounced back, grabbing his opponent's legs with both hands and toppling him. This move called ashitori would also become one of his regular techniques. He ended this tournament with an 8\u20137. \"Enho with 3 straight wins, bounces back after haunches come within 10cm of dohyo\" 2019 March 18 Nikkan Sports This record was enough for Enh\u014d to be promoted to the makuuchi top division for the May 2019 tournament, the first tournament of the Reiwa era. He was the only wrestler on the banzuke listed as being under . He won his first top division bout on the opening day, and earned his first kensh\u014dkin or cash prize provided by a sponsor of the match. As it was Mother's Day, Enh\u014d gave the prize money to his mother. He again garnered attention when on day 4, he took down Daish\u014dh\u014d, who was almost twice his size, with his now well-known shitatenage. However, after reaching the cusp of a winning tournament on his top division debut on day 9 with a 7\u20132 record, he then lost six bouts in a row and ended up with a losing tournament. His losing streak was exacerbated by a thigh injury he suffered on Day 13. However, Enh\u014d's record was enough to leave him ranked in makuuchi for the following July tournament. In this tournament, he again had a similar situation of having seven wins this time on day 10. He lost three bouts in a row after this, but finally managed his first top division winning tournament with a win versus veteran My\u014dgiry\u016b on day 14. He would end the tournament with a 9\u20136 record and was also awarded the technique prize. After another 9\u20136 record in September, he reached maegashira 6 in the November 2019 tournament. In the January 2020 tournament, fighting at a career-high rank of maegashira 5, he defeated \u014dzeki G\u014deid\u014d on Day 9. Since accurate records began in 1975, he is believed to be only the third wrestler under 100 kilos to defeat an \u014dzeki, after Chiyonofuji (against Asahikuni in May 1978) and Mainoumi (against Takanohana in July 1994 and Takanonami in July 1995). He finished with an 8\u20137 record, failing to win the match on the final day that would have given him the Technique Prize. ==Fighting style== Enh\u014d is about lighter, and shorter, than the average for the top makuuchi division. Due to his small size he relies on speed and technique to outwit his opponents. He is known for coming in very low at the tachi-ai or initial charge and attempting to grab his opponent's mawashi with an inside left hand grip (hidari-yotsu). His favourite winning kimarite is shitatenage or underarm throw. In addition, more than a third of wins his come from either leg grabs or pulling underarm throw (shitatedashinage), when the average for a typical wrestler is just two percent. However his lack of weight means he can also easily be thrown, shoved, or picked up and placed out of the ring, making his matches unpredictable and popular with audiences. ==Career record== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of active sumo wrestlers ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Ishikawa Prefecture Category:20th-century Japanese people Category:21st-century Japanese people ",
