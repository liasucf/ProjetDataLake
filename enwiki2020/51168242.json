    "text": "Loving You is a 1997 album by the jazz pianist and singer Shirley Horn. The album peaked at 4 on the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart. ==Reception== Scott Yanow reviewed the album for Allmusic and wrote: \"De-emphasizing her piano, Horn sings one very slow ballad after another. The intimate music...has very little variety and should be listened to in small doses. Horn's singing is full of subtle emotion and sensuality...but no real surprises occur and the consistently dreamy mood has the potential to become quite sleepy\". == Track listing == # \"Loving You\" (Artie Butler, Norman Martin) \u2013 4:21 # \"The Man You Were\" \u2013 4:11 # \"Dreamy\" (Luiz Bonf\u00e1) \u2013 4:03 # \"Someone to Light up My Life\" (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, Gene Lees, Vin\u00edcius de Moraes) \u2013 4:36 # \"In the Dark\" \u2013 5:17 # \"Should I Surrender\" \u2013 4:06 # \"Love Dance\" (Ivan Lins, V\u00edtor Martins, Paul Williams) \u2013 5:36 # \"Kiss and Run\" (Sam Coslow) \u2013 4:48 # \"The Island\" (Alan and Marilyn Bergman, Lins, Martins) \u2013 7:55 # \"It Amazes Me\" (Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh) \u2013 2:36 # \"(All of a Sudden) My Heart Sings\" (Harold Rome, Jean Marie Blanvillain, Henry Herpin) \u2013 5:58 == Personnel == *Shirley Horn \u2013 piano, vocals *Alex Acu\u00f1a \u2013 percussion *George Mesterhazy \u2013 guitar, keyboards, piano *Steve Novosel \u2013 double bass *Steve Williams, Terrence \"Bearwolf\" Williams \u2013 drums ==References== Category:1997 albums Category:Shirley Horn albums Category:Verve Records albums ",
