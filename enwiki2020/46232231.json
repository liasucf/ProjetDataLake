Robert Desnos, surrealism, and the marvelous in everyday life. University of Nebraska Press, LincolnSpiteri, R. (2011). \"Surrealism and its Discontents: Georges Bataille, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, and the 1929 Crisis of Surrealism\". French History & Civilization, 4. Savitry exhibited in 1929 at dealer Zborowski's gallery a sellout show, the catalogue essay of which was penned by celebrated Surrealist poet Louis Aragon (1897-1982). p.26ff. However, though on the threshold of artistic famep.18 he decamped to Polynesia. Commentators propose different reasons for this decision; \"He had more than one string to his art,\" wrote Claude Roy in 1972, \"painting, photography, travel (and doing nothing). But what did not interest him was to be successful.\" (and as a wealthy man, despite the 1929 recession, Savitry did not need the proceeds of success); Barbara Creed notes that \"The Surrealists saw travel as a means to achieve a state of d\u00e9paysement \"; p.162 while another factor may have been the disagreements between the Surrealists over their association with Communism, which reached a climax with Andr\u00e9 Breton's letter of provocation to the group, and meeting with them on 11 March 1929, on the issue of working collectively, to which idea Savitry was amongst the majority of the group in responding positively, innocently naming the reluctant, and soon to be expelled, Desnos as a desirable collaborator .Conley, Katharine (2003).

University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln p.56 Savitry was accompanied on his journey to the tropics by surrealist painter Georges Malkin\"...who was inspired to make the journey by the MGM film, White Shadows in the South Seas directed by Willard Van Dyke in 1928\". Creed, B. (2007) 'The Unheimlich Pacific of Popular Film: Surreal Geography and the Darwinian Sublime' in Papers of Surrealism Issue 6 Autumn 2007 and Yvette Ledoux, a young American woman whom he'd just met. On arrival she chose to go with Malkin. Savitry had taken a Gaumont Block-Notes 6x9 camera, so named for its shape and its ingenious sheet magazine (see: http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Gaumont_Block-Notes), and happened upon an beached 'ghost ship'.p. 67 Friedrich W. Murnau, in the middle of shooting his ill- fated movie Tabou, was impressed by Savitry's boat picture and engaged him on his team to research Polynesian iconography and to make film stills. ==Photojournalism== On return to Paris in 1930 Savitry commenced a career as a photographer, co-founding with Charles Rado, Brassa\u00ef and Ergy Landau in 1933 the Rapho agency. For Rapho, he covered the massive refugee influx into the South of France from the Spanish Civil War. His reportage for Match and other magazines also features his close friend Django Reinhardt, whom he met in ToulonFor one of the fullest accounts of this meeting see Michael Dregni (2004).

Mobilized in September 1939, he joined the battalion of Engineering in Avignon. On 2 April 1940, at Hy\u00e8res, he married the Argentinean painter and illustratorPr\u00e9vert, Jacques (1947) Contes pour enfants pas sages: Illustrations de Elsa Henriquez. France: F.

They had a son, Francis \"Paco\" Dupont. After the war, he helped to revive the Rapho agency in Paris, joined there by Robert Doisneau and Willy Ronis.
