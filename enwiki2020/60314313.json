He only featured for their reserves, prior to leaving for Torneo Federal A's Uni\u00f3n Aconquija in 2018. He scored his first goal in February versus Deportivo Maip\u00fa, who he scored against again in the succeeding March. Uni\u00f3n suffered relegation to tier four in 2017\u201318. Izaguirre joined Central C\u00f3rdoba of Primera B Nacional in June 2018. He made his professional football bow for the Santiago del Estero club on 23 March 2019 during a victory away to Santamarina. Izaguirre was released in June 2019, with the forward subsequently rejoining Ben Hur in the succeeding December. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Ben Hur |2017 |rowspan=\"1\"|Torneo Federal B |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Uni\u00f3n Aconquija |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"1\"|Torneo Federal A |10||3||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||10||3 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Central C\u00f3rdoba |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Ben Hur |2020 |rowspan=\"1\"|Federal Amateur |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !14!!3!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!0!!0!!14!!3 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:People from Paran\u00e1 Department Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Torneo Federal A players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Club Sportivo Ben Hur players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n footballers Category:Central C\u00f3rdoba de Santiago del Estero footballers ",
