    "text": "Dianol is a synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogen that was never marketed. It is a dimer and impurity of anol, and was, along with hexestrol, involved in erroneous findings of highly potent estrogenic activity with anol. Although a potent estrogen, it requires a dose of 100 \u03bcg to show activity, whereas hexestrol shows activity with a mere dose of 0.2 \u03bcg. ==See also== * Anethole * Dianethole * Diethylstilbestrol * Stilbestrol ==References== Category:Phenols Category:Synthetic estrogens ",
