    "text": "Clement Tudway (1734\u20131815) was a British lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons for 54 years from 1761 to 1815, being Father of the House from 1806. Tudway was the eldest son of Charles Tudway and his wife Hannah. He matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford in 1751. In 1752 he entered Middle Temple 1752 and was called to the bar in 1759. He married Elizabeth Hill, daughter of Sir Rowland Hill, 1st Baronet on 7 June 1762. In 1770, he succeeded his father. He became recorder of Wells and was Mayor of Wells ten times. Tudway was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Wells on his father's interest at the 1761 general election. At the 1768 general election there was a contest at Wells, but he topped the poll because his father could command enough votes. He was also returned as MP for Midhurst as a Government candidate at the 1774 general election but decided to sit for Wells where he was returned unopposed. By 1806 he was the longest standing MP in the House, but by this time his absences though ill-health were becoming frequent. Tudway died while still an MP on 7 July 1815. He and his wife Elizabeth had no children. ==References== Category:1734 births Category:1815 deaths Category:People from Somerset Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1761\u20131768 Category:British MPs 1768\u20131774 Category:British MPs 1774\u20131780 Category:British MPs 1780\u20131784 Category:British MPs 1784\u20131790 Category:British MPs 1790\u20131796 Category:British MPs 1796\u20131800 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1801\u20131802 Category:UK MPs 1802\u20131806 Category:UK MPs 1806\u20131807 Category:UK MPs 1807\u20131812 Category:UK MPs 1812\u20131818 ",
