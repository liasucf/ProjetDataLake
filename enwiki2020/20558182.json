    "text": "Acridone is an organic compound based on the acridine skeleton, with a carbonyl group at the 9 position. A yellow solid. ==Synthesis and structure== The molecule is planar. Optical spectra reveal that the keto tautomer predominates in the gas-phase and in ethanol solution. Acridone can be synthesized by the condensation of aniline and 2-chlorobenzoic acid. It can also be prepared by heating N-phenylanthranilic acid. ==History== One of the first who were able to prove the compound's existence was Karl Drechsler, Student of G. Goldschmiedt, at the k.u.k. Universit\u00e4t Wien (Vienna, Austria) in 1914.Austrian National Library, Reports of the monthly meetings of the Academy of Sciences ==Derivatives== Acridone constitutes the scaffold of some synthetic compounds with diverse pharmacological activities. 3-Chloro-6-(2-diethylamino-ethoxy)-10-(2-diethylamino-ethyl)-acridone has shown promise as an antimalarial drug. ==See also== * Quinacridone ==References== Category:Aromatic ketones Category:Acridines ",
