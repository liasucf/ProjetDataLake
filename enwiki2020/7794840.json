    "text": "Diacetone alcohol is an organic compound with the formula CH3C(O)CH2C(OH)(CH3)2, sometimes called DAA. This colorless liquid is a common synthetic intermediate used for the preparation of other compounds, and is also used as a solvent. ==Synthesis and reactions== :none First identified by Heintz,Heintz, Ann. 169, 114 (1873) one standard laboratory preparation of DAA entails the Ba(OH)2-catalyzed condensation of two molecules of acetone. It undergoes dehydration to give the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone, mesityl oxide: Hydrogenation of mesityl oxide gives the industrial solvent, methyl isobutyl ketone (\"MIBK\"). Hydrogenation gives hexylene glycol. Condensation with urea give diacetone-monourea. ==Uses== Diacetone alcohol is used in cellulose ester lacquers, particularly of the brushing type, where it produces brilliant gloss and hard film and where its lack of odor is desirable. It is used in lacquer thinners, dopes, wood stains, wood preservatives and printing pastes; in coating compositions for paper and textiles; permanent markers;MSDS: Sharpie Chisel Tip Permanent Marker - \"Household products database\" US Department of Health and Human Services in making artificial silk and leather; in imitation gold leaf; in celluloid cements; as a preservative for animal tissue; in metal cleaning compounds; in the manufacture of photographic film; and in hydraulic brake fluids, where it is usually mixed with an equal volume of castor oil. ==Safety== The (oral, rats) is 4 g/kg. ==References== Category:Tertiary alcohols Category:Aldols ",
