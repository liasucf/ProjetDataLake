He was Latvia's first classical composer, having composed instrumental pieces and cantatas. Jurj\u0101ns also studied and collected more than 6000 pieces of Latvian folklore, among them 3000 songs, which he compiled in six books, called Latvju tautas m\u016bzikas materi\u0101li (Materials of Latvian Folk Music). == Biography == Andrejs Jurj\u0101ns was born in 1856 in \u0112rg\u013ci. Active is music from a young age, Jurj\u0101ns decides to become a musician after participating as a choir singer in the First Latvian Song Festival in 1873. In 1875, he studied music at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, attending composition, organ and French horn classes with Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov and German organists Louis Homilius and Friedrich Homilius. In 1877, he published his first composition. From 1882 to 1916 Jurj\u0101ns taught music in the Russian Imperial Music Society Conservatory in Kharkiv, Ukraine. At the same time, he took an active part in Latvian musical life as a collector, researcher and arranger of national folk songs. His five-volume work, \"Materials of the Latvian Folk Music\" encompasses about 2,000 tunes. Jurj\u0101ns laid the foundation for further research in this area. Together with his brothers and musicians Juris, P\u0101vuls and P\u0113teris he regularly took part in the Latvian Song Festival as the Jurj\u0101ns' French horn quartet. Around 1910 Jurj\u0101ns' hearing became weaker and in 1916 he retires from his teaching career. Seriously ill, in 1920 he returns to Latvia, where he dies in 1922. After the death of Jurj\u0101ns, the 6th part of his work was published posthumously by his brother P\u0101vuls. == Compositions == Jurj\u0101ns composed 15 symphonic works, 5 vocal and instrumental works, as well as many solo songs, choir and folk songs. He is the first person to detail the Latvian folk song characteristics, thus attempting to turn the public's attention to common features in Latvian and Russian folklore. Jurj\u0101ns often used folk song intonations and fragments in his compositions. Jurj\u0101ns called on the new generation of Latvian composers to learn from Russian classical music, namely, from the work of composer Mikhail Glinka. === Selected folk songs === * \"P\u016bt, v\u0113ji\u0146i\" * \"\u010cu\u010di, mana l\u012bgavi\u0146a\" * \"Kur tu skriesi, vanadzi\u0146i\" * \"Es kar\u0101i aiziedams\" * \"Aiz up\u012btes es uzaugu\" * \"Tautu meita, melnac\u012bte\" * \"St\u0101d\u012bju ievi\u0146u\" * \"Tautie\u0161am roku devu\" * \"Kur g\u0101ji, puis\u012bti\", etc. === Selected choir songs === * \"Nevis slinkojot un p\u016bstot\" * \"L\u016bk, roze zied\" * \"Ozold\u0113li, liepas meitas\" * \"Nakts dziesma\" * \"Dievozolu trijotne\", etc. === Symphonic music === * Symphonic allegro (1880) * Latvju dejas (Latvian Dances) suite (1884) * T\u0113vijai (To the Fatherland) cantata (1888) == References == Category:1856 births Category:1922 deaths Category:Latvian composers Category:Latvian musicologists Category:Saint Petersburg Conservatory alumni ",
