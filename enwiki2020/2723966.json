In the Moscow Metro Volodya unexpectedly makes a friend, Kolya (Nikita Mikhalkov), who is returning home after a hard night shift. Volodya wants to stay at his old friends' home, but he doesn't know where the necessary street is so Kolya decided to help him to find it. Unfortunately, a dog bites Volodya near Clean Ponds. Then Kolya decided to help his new friend again \u2013 they both came to Kolya's home where Kolya sews Volodya's trousers and introduces him to Kolya's large family. Volodya recognised that his old Moscow friends aren't in Moscow (they left for south) and Volodya stays at Kolya's. Then Volodya goes for a walk. At last alone, Kolya decided to sleep, but then came his old friend Sasha (Evgeny Steblov).

Though its plot is a bit naive and unpretentious, it showed how wonderful life was, gives hope and tries to look at the unpleasant things in an optimistic way. The song by the same name from the film is still popular and became the unofficial hymn of Moscow youth.\u0410 \u044f \u0438\u0434\u0443\u2026 The popularity of this film was low in the 1970s but rose again in the 1980s in contrast to contemporaneous \"chernukha\" (\"black\") films, gloomy satirical and social dramas with philosophical motifs. Nowadays it is still very famous. There are new versions of the song by some 1990s Russian rock groups (for example, Nogu Svelo!) and also a film remake, The Heat, which was commercially successfully but critically panned.\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u0432 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e == References == ==External links== * * * Walking the Streets of Moscow on MosFilm video channel Category:1964 films Category:Soviet films Category:Russian-language films Category:1964 romantic comedy films Category:Mosfilm films Category:Films set in Moscow Category:Films directed by Georgiy Daneliya Category:Soviet romantic comedy films Category:Russian romantic comedy films Category:Russian films Category:1964 comedy films ",
