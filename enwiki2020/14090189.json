He is famous for having carried three shells to an artillery piece during the Allied attempt to force the Dardanelles on 18 March 1915. ==Personal life and military career== Born in the village of Havran, he enlisted into the army in April 1909. After serving in the Balkan Wars of 1912\u20131913, he was transferred to Mecidiye Coastal Battery defending the Mediterranean entrance to the \u00c7anakkale. Following the heavy naval bombardment of the forts guarding the Narrows on 18 March 1915, the gun he was serving in the Mecidiye fort remained operational, but its shell crane had been damaged and the other gunners in the area were injured. Corporal Seyit, by himself, is said to have carried three artillery shells each weighing 275 kg to the 240/35 mm gunhttp://www.navyingallipoli.com/heavy_a.html and enabled it to continue firing on the Allied Fleet. He shot three rounds to the British pre- dreadnought which was trying to fish sailors of hit and disabled by a mine earlier.Burt, p. 174 His first two shots didn\u2019t inflict much damage but his third shot inflicted a severe injury to HMS Ocean. The shot fell under the water mechanism of the ship, causing the ship to lie down, drift towards and hit one of the mines that the mine crew of Nusret had dumped. HMS Ocean capsized shortly after. Following the repulse of the naval assault, Seyit was promoted to corporal and publicized as an iconic Turkish hero. After the Battle of \u00c7anakkale, he was asked to have his picture taken with the shell which he famously carried. Corporal Seyit could not move the shell no matter how hard he tried. Afterwards, Corporal Seyit uttered the famous words \"If war breaks out again, I'll lift it again.\" After that, his photo was taken with a wooden shell. He was discharged in 1918 and became a forester and later a coal-miner. He took the surname \u00c7abuk in 1934 with the passing of the Surname Law. He died of pneumonia in 1939. A statue of him carrying a shell was erected in 1992, just south of Kilitbahir Castle on the Gelibolu Peninsula == Further reading == * * * * French Battleship Bouvet * Naval Operations in Dardanelles Campaign * Dardanelles Fortified Area Command * Coastal artillery of the Dardanelles Strait ==References== ==External links== * Picture of Seyit \u00c7abuk * * * Category:1889 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Deaths from lung disease Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:People from Havran, Bal\u0131kesir Category:Ottoman military personnel of World War I Category:Gallipoli campaign ",
