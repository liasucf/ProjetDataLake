Members of this wing serve in the same roles as their male counterparts, including combat roles. Women were first admitted to the Sri Lanka Air Force in 1972 when female officers joined the Volunteer Air Force. The Women's Wing was formed on 27 February 1983 with the assistance of Women's Royal Air Force (Britain). Initially, women could not become pilots.Raj K. Mehta, Lost Victory: The Rise & Fall of LTTE Supremo, V. Prabhakaran, p. 135, Pentagon Press, 2010 . However, in 1998 women were recruited to train for the elite pilots' wing to replace losses to the Tamil Tigers in their insurgency. 800 women applied for the 33 available places to fly transport planes.Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board, Canada, \"Sri Lanka: Organization and structure of the Sri Lankan Airforce including ranks, units, squadrons and the duties assigned to different personnel; location of squadrons and departments\", UNHCR Refworld, Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 14 March 2001.
