    "text": "The 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League was the 62nd season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 25th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. The final was played between Juventus and Real Madrid at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. It was the second time that the two teams faced each other in the competition's decisive match, having previously met in the 1998 final. Real Madrid, the defending champions, beat Juventus 4\u20131 to win a record-extending 12th title. With this victory, Real Madrid became the first team to successfully defend their title in the Champions League era, and the first to successfully defend a European Cup since Milan in 1990. As winners, Real Madrid qualified as the UEFA representative for the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League, Manchester United, in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup, ultimately triumphing in both competitions. ==Association team allocation== A total of 78 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations were expected to participate in the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league, and Kosovo, whose participation was not accepted in their first attempt as UEFA members). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: *Associations 1\u20133 each had four teams qualify. *Associations 4\u20136 each had three teams qualify. *Associations 7\u201315 each had two teams qualify. *Associations 16\u201354 (except Liechtenstein) each had one team qualify. *The winners of the 2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League and 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League were each given an additional entry if they did not qualify for the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league. Because a maximum of five teams from one association can enter the Champions League, if both the Champions League title holders and the Europa League title holders were from the same top three ranked association and finish outside the top four of their domestic league, the fourth-placed team of their association would be moved to the Europa League. For this season: **The winners of the 2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid, qualified through their domestic league, meaning the additional entry for the Champions League title holders was not necessary. **The winners of the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla, did not qualify through their domestic league, meaning the additional entry for the Europa League title holders was necessary. ===Association ranking=== For the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2015 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2010\u201311 to 2014\u201315. Apart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below: * \u2013 Additional berth for Europa League title holders {| |-valign=top style=\"font- size:90%\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Rank !Association !Coeff. !Teams !Notes |- !1 | Spain |align=right|99.999 |align=center rowspan=3|4 | |- !2 | England |align=right|80.391 | |- !3 | Germany |align=right|79.415 | |- !4 | Italy |align=right|70.510 |align=center rowspan=3|3 | |- !5 | Portugal |align=right|61.382 | |- !6 | France |align=right|52.416 | |- !7 | Russia |align=right|50.498 |align=center rowspan=9|2 | |- !8 | Ukraine |align=right|45.166 | |- !9 | Netherlands |align=right|40.979 | |- !10 | Belgium |align=right|37.200 | |- !11 | Switzerland |align=right|34.375 | |- !12 | Turkey |align=right|32.600 | |- !13 | Greece |align=right|31.900 | |- !14 | Czech Republic |align=right|29.125 | |- !15 | Romania |align=right|26.299 | |- !16 | Austria |align=right|25.675 |align=center rowspan=4|1 | |- !17 | Croatia |align=right|23.500 | |- !18 | Cyprus |align=right|22.300 | |- !19 | Poland |align=right|21.500 | |} | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Rank !Association !Coeff. !Teams !Notes |- !20 | Israel |align=right|21.000 |align=center rowspan=18|1 | |- !21 | Belarus |align=right|20.750 | |- !22 | Denmark |align=right|19.800 | |- !23 | Scotland |align=right|17.900 | |- !24 | Sweden |align=right|17.725 | |- !25 | Bulgaria |align=right|16.750 | |- !26 | Norway |align=right|14.375 | |- !27 | Serbia |align=right|13.875 | |- !28 | Slovenia |align=right|13.625 | |- !29 | Azerbaijan |align=right|12.500 | |- !30 | Slovakia |align=right|11.250 | |- !31 | Hungary |align=right|11.000 | |- !32 | Kazakhstan |align=right|10.375 | |- !33 | Moldova |align=right|10.000 | |- !34 | Georgia |align=right|9.375 | |- !35 | Finland |align=right|8.200 | |- !36 | Iceland |align=right|8.000 | |- !37 | Bosnia and Herzegovina |align=right|7.500 | |} | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Rank !Association !Coeff. !Teams !Notes |- !38 | Liechtenstein |align=right|6.000 |align=center|0 | |- !39 | Macedonia |align=right|5.875 |align=center rowspan=16|1 | |- !40 | Republic of Ireland |align=right|5.750 | |- !41 | Montenegro |align=right|5.625 | |- !42 | Albania |align=right|5.375 | |- !43 | Luxembourg |align=right|5.125 | |- !44 | Northern Ireland |align=right|4.875 | |- !45 | Lithuania |align=right|4.500 | |- !46 | Latvia |align=right|4.250 | |- !47 | Malta |align=right|4.208 | |- !48 | Estonia |align=right|3.500 | |- !49 | Faroe Islands |align=right|3.500 | |- !50 | Wales |align=right|2.875 | |- !51 | Armenia |align=right|2.750 | |- !52 | Andorra |align=right|0.833 | |- !53 | San Marino |align=right|0.499 | |- !54 | Gibraltar |align=right|0.250 | |- !55 | Kosovo |align=right|0.000 |align=center|0 | |} |} ;Notes ===Distribution=== In the default access list, the Champions League title holders enter the group stage.

Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. ===First qualifying round=== The draws for the first and second qualifying rounds were held on 20 June 2016. The first legs were played on 28 June, and the second legs were played on 5 and 6 July 2016. ===Second qualifying round=== The first legs were played on 12 and 13 July, and the second legs were played on 19 and 20 July 2016. ===Third qualifying round=== The third qualifying round was split into two separate sections: Champions Route (for league champions) and League Route (for league non-champions). The losing teams in both sections entered the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League play-off round. The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 15 July 2016. The first legs were played on 26 and 27 July, and the second legs were played on 2 and 3 August 2016. ==Play-off round== The play-off round was split into two separate sections: Champions Route (for league champions) and League Route (for league non-champions). The losing teams in both sections entered the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League group stage. The draw for the play-off round was held on 5 August 2016. The first legs were played on 16 and 17 August, and the second legs were played on 23 and 24 August 2016. ==Group stage== The draw for the group stage was held on 25 August 2016, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles (introduced starting 2015\u201316 season): *Pot 1 contained the title holders and the champions of the top seven associations based on their 2015 UEFA country coefficients. *Pot 2, 3 and 4 contained the remaining teams, seeded based on their 2016 UEFA club coefficients. In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the round of 16, while the third- placed teams enter the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League round of 32. The matchdays are 13\u201314 September, 27\u201328 September, 18\u201319 October, 1\u20132 November, 22\u201323 November, and 6\u20137 December 2016. The youth teams of the clubs that qualify for the group stage also play in the 2016\u201317 UEFA Youth League on the same matchdays, where they compete in the UEFA Champions League Path (the youth domestic champions of the top 32 associations compete in a separate Domestic Champions Path until the play-offs). A total of 17 national associations are represented in the group stage. Leicester City and Rostov made their debut appearances in the group stage. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |- !Tiebreakers |- |The teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied in the order given to determine the rankings (regulations Article 17.01): #higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question; #superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question; #higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question; #higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question; #if, after having applied criteria 1 to 4, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 4 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 6 to 12 apply; #superior goal difference in all group matches; #higher number of goals scored in all group matches; #higher number of away goals scored in all group matches; #higher number of wins in all group matches; #higher number of away wins in all group matches; #lower disciplinary points total based only on yellow and red cards received in all group matches (red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points); #higher club coefficient. |} ===Group A=== ===Group B=== ===Group C=== ===Group D=== ===Group E=== ===Group F=== ===Group G=== ===Group H=== ==Knockout phase== In the knockout phase, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows: *In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners are seeded, and the eight group runners-up are unseeded. The seeded teams are drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other. *In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other. ===Bracket=== ===Round of 16=== The draw for the round of 16 was held on 12 December 2016. The first legs were played on 14, 15, 21 and 22 February, and the second legs were played on 7, 8, 14 and 15 March 2017. ===Quarter-finals=== The draw for the quarter-finals was held on 17 March 2017. The first legs were played on 11 and 12 April, and the second legs were played on 18 and 19 April 2017. ===Semi-finals=== The draw for the semi-finals was held on 21 April 2017. The first legs were played on 2 and 3 May, and the second legs were played on 9 and 10 May 2017. ===Final=== The final was played on 3 June 2017 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the semi-final draw. ==Statistics== Statistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round. ===Top goalscorers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !Player !Team !Goals !Minutes played |- |1 |align=left| Cristiano Ronaldo |align=left| Real Madrid |12 |1200 |- |2 |align=left| Lionel Messi |align=left| Barcelona |11 |810 |- |rowspan=2|3 |align=left| Edinson Cavani |align=left| Paris Saint- Germain |rowspan=2|8 |720 |- |align=left| Robert Lewandowski |align=left| Bayern Munich |794 |- |5 |align=left| Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang |align=left| Borussia Dortmund |7 |708 |- |rowspan=2|6 |align=left| Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 |align=left| Monaco |rowspan=2|6 |536 |- |align=left| Antoine Griezmann |align=left| Atl\u00e9tico Madrid |1068 |- |rowspan=5|8 |align=left| Sergio Ag\u00fcero |align=left| Manchester City |rowspan=5|5 |541 |- |align=left| Dries Mertens |align=left| Napoli |571 |- |align=left| Radamel Falcao |align=left| Monaco |666 |- |align=left| Karim Benzema |align=left| Real Madrid |954 |- |align=left| Gonzalo Higua\u00edn |align=left| Juventus |1039 |} ===Top assists=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !Player !Team !Assists !Minutes played |- |1 |align=left| Neymar |align=left| Barcelona |8 |797 |- |2 |align=left| Cristiano Ronaldo |align=left| Real Madrid |6 |1200 |- |rowspan=2|3 |align=left| Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 |align=left| Borussia Dortmund |rowspan=2|5 |769 |- |align=left| Dani Carvajal |align=left| Real Madrid |975 |- |rowspan=4|5 |align=left| Benjamin Mendy |align=left| Monaco |rowspan=4|4 |525 |- |align=left| Raheem Sterling |align=left| Manchester City |577 |- |align=left| Eduardo Salvio |align=left| Benfica |628 |- |align=left| Thomas Lemar |align=left| Monaco |895 |} ===Squad of the Season=== The UEFA technical study group selected the following 18 players as the squad of the tournament. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! !Player !Team |- |rowspan=2| |align=left| Gianluigi Buffon |align=left| Juventus |- |align=left| Jan Oblak |align=left| Atl\u00e9tico Madrid |- |rowspan=5| |align=left| Diego God\u00edn |align=left| Atl\u00e9tico Madrid |- |align=left| Leonardo Bonucci |align=left| Juventus |- |align=left| Dani Carvajal |align=left| Real Madrid |- |align=left| Sergio Ramos |align=left| Real Madrid |- |align=left| Marcelo |align=left| Real Madrid |- |rowspan=6| |align=left| Casemiro |align=left| Real Madrid |- |align=left| Toni Kroos |align=left| Real Madrid |- |align=left| Luka Modri\u0107 |align=left| Real Madrid |- |align=left| Isco |align=left| Real Madrid |- |align=left| Miralem Pjani\u0107 |align=left| Juventus |- |align=left| Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko |align=left| Monaco |- |rowspan=5| |align=left| Antoine Griezmann |align=left| Atl\u00e9tico Madrid |- |align=left| Lionel Messi |align=left| Barcelona |- |align=left| Cristiano Ronaldo |align=left| Real Madrid |- |align=left| Robert Lewandowski |align=left| Bayern Munich |- |align=left| Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 |align=left| Monaco |} ===Players of the Season=== New UEFA Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season, Defender of the Season, Midfielder of the Season, and Forward of the Season positional awards were introduced for the 2016\u201317 season.
