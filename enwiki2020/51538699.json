    "text": "The 2017 Major League Baseball season began on April 2 with three games, including the 2016 World Series champions Chicago Cubs facing off against the St. Louis Cardinals, and ended on November 1. The postseason began on October 3. The World Series began October 24 and Game 7 was played on November 1, in which the Houston Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games, to capture their first World Series championship in franchise history. The 88th Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held on July 11 at Marlins Park, the home of the Miami Marlins. For the first time since 2002 when the game ended in a tie, the All Star Game did not determine home field advantage for the World Series. Instead, home field advantage was awarded to the team with the better regular season record. The American League won 2\u20131 in 10 innings. After the 2019 season, Mike Fiers alleged that the 2017 Astros used technology to illicitly steal their opponents' signs and relay it to their hitters. The Astros used this method throughout the 2017 season, and part of the 2018 season. MLB and the Astros opened an investigation into this sign stealing allegation. MLB found the Astros used technology to cheat during their 2017 season and suspended Hinch and Astros' general manager Jeff Luhnow for one year; the Astros fired Luhnow and Hinch the same day. Alex Cora, who was the Astros bench coach in 2017 and the Red Sox manager from 2018-19, parted ways with the Red Sox after the scandal broke. ==Schedule== As has been the case since 2013, all teams played their four division opponents 19 times each for a total of 76 games. They played six or seven games against each of the other ten same-league opponents for a total of 66 games, and 20 inter-league games. The primary inter-league match-ups were AL East vs. NL Central, AL Central vs. NL West, and AL West vs. NL East. Teams also played four games against a designated interleague rival. On March 9, it was announced that the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals would play a game at the minor league BB&T; Ballpark in Williamsport, Pennsylvania on August 20. The game coincided with the Little League World Series, held annually in nearby South Williamsport, and was exclusively attended by Little League players and their families. ===Effect of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma=== As a consequence of Hurricane Harvey damaging the Houston area, the three-game Lone Star Series between the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros from August 29 to 31 was moved from Minute Maid Park to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. Although the Astros were the designated home team, they wore their away uniforms during the series while the Rangers wore their home uniforms. The Astros returned to Minute Maid Park for a three-game series with the New York Mets, beginning with a split doubleheader on September 2. The Tampa Bay Rays' three-game set with the New York Yankees from September 11 to 13 was moved from Tropicana Field to Queens' Citi Field due to Hurricane Irma's impending landfall on the Tampa Bay Area. Irma's damage to South Florida also forced the Miami Marlins' three-game set with the Milwaukee Brewers from September 15 to 17 to move from Marlins Park to the Brewers' home field at Miller Park, with the Marlins as the designated home team. Similar to the Rangers\u2013Astros series in Tampa Bay, the Marlins wore their away uniforms as the 'home' team, while the Brewers wore their home uniforms as the 'away' team. ==Standings== ===American League=== ===National League=== ==Postseason== ===Bracket=== ==Rule changes== In March 2017, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association agreed to seven rule changes. *The start of a no-pitch intentional walk, allowing the defensive team's manager to signal a decision to the home plate umpire to intentionally walk the batter. Following the signal of the manager's intention, the umpire will immediately award first base to the batter. This new rule was put into play to speed up the process of game time. *A 30-second limit for a manager to decide whether to challenge a play and invoke replay review. *When a manager has exhausted his challenges for the game, Crew Chiefs may now invoke replay review for non-home run calls beginning in the eighth inning instead of the seventh inning. *A conditional two-minute guideline for Replay Officials to render a decision on replay review, allowing various exceptions. *A prohibition on the use of any markers on the field that could create a tangible reference system for fielders. *An addition to Rule 5.07 formalizes an umpire interpretation by stipulating that a pitcher may not take a second step toward home plate with either foot or otherwise reset his pivot foot in his delivery of the pitch. If there is at least one runner on base, then such an action will be called as a balk under Rule 6.02(a). If the bases are unoccupied, then it will be considered an illegal pitch under Rule 6.02(b). *An amendment to Rule 5.03 requires base coaches to position themselves behind the line of the coach's box closest to home plate and the front line that runs parallel to the foul line prior to each pitch. Once a ball is put in play, a base coach is allowed to leave the coach's box to signal a player so long as the coach does not interfere with the play. ==Managerial changes== ===General managers=== ====Offseason==== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !Team !Former GM !Reason For Leaving !New GM !Story/Accomplishments |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" |Arizona Diamondbacks | style=\"text-align:center;\" |Dave Stewart | style=\"text- align:center;\" |Fired | style=\"text-align:center;\" |Mike Hazen |On October 3, 2016, General Manager Dave Stewart was fired, along with field manager Chip Hale.

It would finish the season hitting a combined 6,105 home runs across Major League Baseball. ==Other news== * August 12: The Miami Marlins announced that a signed agreement to sell the franchise had been forwarded to the MLB main offices for review. Under the agreement, Jeffrey Loria would sell the team for $1.2 billion to a group led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, with Derek Jeter in charge of business and baseball operations.

The new system uses a doppler radar to calculate pitch speed based on maximum velocity (typically from the release of the pitch), rather than the speed measured from home plate. The change in data source has led to discrepancies in pitch speed reports between those reported in 2016 and 2017, with some pitches registering slightly higher speeds than with the previous system. ==Uniforms== ===Wholesale changes=== The Arizona Diamondbacks tweaked their uniform set that was unveiled last season. The pant stripes now reach to the hip, while the gradient below was removed. The road uniform lettering is also changed to improve visibility. The San Diego Padres unveiled new home and road uniforms, with noticeable changes such as the team name and the removal of yellow on the home uniforms, the bowtie-shaped lettering in the city name on the road uniforms, and the interlocking \"SD\" on both uniforms. ===Alternate changes=== The Kansas City Royals unveiled an updated version of their gold-trimmed white uniform, featuring gold numbers and blue lettering. It was paired with a blue cap featuring the gold 'KC' lettering, and was worn on Friday home games. The Washington Nationals unveiled a white alternate uniform featuring the 'curly W' logo in a Stars and Stripes design. It was paired with two caps featuring the 'curly W' Stars and Stripes design: a navy cap with red brim, and a red cap with navy brim. The uniforms were worn during patriotic-themed and weekend day games. Coinciding with Canada's 150th anniversary, the Toronto Blue Jays unveiled a red alternate uniform featuring a monochrome red rendition of the team's logo, complete with red belts, socks and cleats, and a red cap featuring the maple leaf logo. It was worn on Sunday home games and select other games in the month of July. They also promoted their white-paneled home caps to alternate status after wearing them once the past two seasons. The Cleveland Indians retired their cream alternate uniforms. The red caps that were formerly paired with the cream uniforms will now be worn with the navy alternates at select home games. The Cincinnati Reds changed their caps on Military Appreciation nights from camo to olive, with a white horseshoe \"C\". The Pittsburgh Pirates changed their caps on Thursday home games to mustard, while still wearing their camo jerseys. The New York Mets changed the brim of their home alternate caps from orange to blue, while the Mr. Met patch on both alternate uniforms were replaced with the primary Mets logo. ===Spring Training changes=== All Spring Training uniforms in 2017 featured a pattern on the names and numbers.

The first use of the special uniforms was on August 20 by the Cardinals and Pirates for the MLB Little League Classic, played in Williamsport, Pennsylvania during the 2017 Little League World Series in nearby South Williamsport. Players Weekend also coincided with the final days of the LLWS. The uniforms dramatically differed from regular uniforms in several respects: * All jerseys were pullovers with contrasting sleeves. Apart from the Reds and Phillies, which respectively used white and off-white for the main body of the jersey, all teams used colors in that area. * All jerseys had player names on the back; players were encouraged (but not required) to use nicknames instead of family names (or, in the case of Ichiro Suzuki, his given name). Notably, Players Weekend marked the first time that an official Yankees jersey had a name on the back. * The jerseys were complemented with special colored caps. Many featured slight modifications of the teams' current logos, but some used completely new logos. For example, the Phillies' cap logo for Players Weekend was a blue Liberty Bell. * The jerseys and caps featured a special logo showing a player's progression from youth to adulthood. The design drew cues from the official Little League and MLB logos. * The aforementioned logo also appeared on a special \"Thank You\" sleeve patch on each jersey. This patch included a blank space that allowed each player to write in the name of a key figure in his baseball development. * All teams used special multi-colored socks, all with the same design. * Normal color restrictions on accessories such as shoes and batting gloves were relaxed to allow more self-expression. ===Throwback uniforms=== The Indians and Royals wore Negro Leagues throwbacks May 7.
