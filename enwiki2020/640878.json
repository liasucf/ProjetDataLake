They contain sites of particular ecological, historical and aesthetic value. Regulated tourism is permitted.\"About Special Protected Nature Areas\", a Russian Federation federal law of March 14, 1995.Biodiversity Conservation Centre Moscow The area of each park is divided into zones according to various functions. There should be a strictly protected area managed as a zapovednik, and also recreational and buffer zones in which economic activity is allowed, such as tourism, traditional land use, and benign forms of agriculture and forestry. The strictly protected function is sometimes fulfilled by a neighbouring official zapovednik; for instance, Barguzin Zapovednik adjoins Zabaykalsky National Park on the east side of Lake Baikal. In 2001 Vodlozersky National Park received UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status, followed by Smolenskoye Poozerye and Ugra National Park in 2002, and two others (Valdaysky and Kenozersky) in 2004. The newest park is Bikin National Park, created in late 2015.
