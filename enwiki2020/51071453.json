Milliken Distinguished Service Emeritus Professor, Departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Chemistry; Enrico Fermi Institute; and the College of University of Chicago.The Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics | Takeshi Oka ==Education== Oka was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1932. He received his BS and PhD degree in 1955 and 1960, respectively, from the University of Tokyo. ==Career== In 1963, Oka worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Harry Kroto at Gerhard Herzberg's laboratory,Sir Harold Kroto - Biographical National Research Council of Canada. Among them, Kroto and Herzberg have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, furthermore, the Nobel laureate Robert Curl was also Oka's colleague.Robert F. Curl Jr. - Biographical From 1960 to 1963, Oka was a Fellow at JSPS, the University of Tokyo. Afterward, he was successively worked at Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics (1963-1981), and the University of Chicago (1981-). His research group's studies specialized in the field of the quantum mechanics and dynamics of fundamental molecular ions and their behavior in astronomical objects. In 1980, Oka discovered in his laboratory the infrared spectrum of . which is thought to be the starting point for gas phase chemistry in interstellar \"molecular clouds.\" Following a lengthy search Thomas R. Geballe and Oka spectroscopically detected in two interstellar clouds. Since then Oka and his colleagues have published numerous papers on their observations of interstellar . Oka is currently an emeritus professor at the University of Chicago. ==Recognition== Oka was on the list of ChemBank's prediction for the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.Nobel Predictions | ChemBark ===Awards=== *2004 - Davy Medal. *2004 - Norman MacLean Faculty Award. *2002 - E.
