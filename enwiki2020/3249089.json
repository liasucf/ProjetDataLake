After sailing to England in February 1917, the battalion was transferred to the 8th Battalion, Canadian Railway Troops. The 218th Battalion, CEF, had one officer commanding: Lieutenant- Colonel J. K. \"Peace River Jim\" Cornwall. On October 11, 1916, soldiers from the 218th Battalion led an effort to overcome the local police in Calgary. \"The city virtually is in the hands of the soldier mob.\" Sergeant Morris \"Two Gun\" Cohen was implicated as a leader of the events during a series of trials held in the city; however, he was acquitted after successfully defending himself in court.Levy, D.S.
