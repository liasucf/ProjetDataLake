Together with the songs \"Imperfections\" and \"Lying Down\", it was released as a digital download on 18 September 2019, the day Dion started her Courage World Tour, promoting upcoming album Courage. \"Courage\" is an emotional piano ballad, dealing with the loss of a loved one. Previously, Moccio co-wrote for Dion her 2002 single, \"A New Day Has Come\". ==Critical reception== The song received positive critical reviews. According to A Bit of Pop Music, \"Courage\" has a very personal content. It is a piano and strings based emotional power ballad, dealing with the loss of a person close to you. With the death of her husband Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil in 2016, this song must be close to Dion's heart and she sings it with emotive vocals and a lot of passion. Mike Wass from Idolator described \"Courage\" as a simple piano ballad that lets Dion pull the vocal trigger as she shares important life lessons. It is raw and very emotional. ==Music video== The audio of \"Courage\" was uploaded on YouTube on 18 September 2019. The music video, directed by Se Oh and was filmed entirely in black and white and premiered on 13 November 2019.
