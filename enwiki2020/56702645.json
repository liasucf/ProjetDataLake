The game was held at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. Clemson emerged victorious and became the 2018 ACC champions, beating Pitt 42\u201310. ==History== The 2018 Championship Game was the 14th in the Atlantic Coast Conference's 66-year history. Last season, the ACC Championship Game featured the Clemson Tigers, champions of the Atlantic Division, and the Miami Hurricanes, champions of the Coastal Division. Clemson won the game 38\u20133 and went on to the 2017 College Football Playoff. ==Teams== ===Clemson=== The Clemson Tigers finished the season with a 12\u20130 undefeated record. This is the Tigers' fourth straight appearance in the championship game. They have won the previous three championship games. During the season, they defeated Georgia Tech, Syracuse, Wake Forest, NC State, Florida State, Louisville, Boston College and Duke in conference play. Their season was also highlighted by 2 wins over SEC teams (Texas A&M; and South Carolina). The Tigers come into the game ranked #2 in both the AP and Coaches poll. ===Pittsburgh=== The Pittsburgh Panthers finished the season with a 7\u20135 overall record and a 6\u20132 record in ACC play.
