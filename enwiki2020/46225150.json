    "text": "The William Welch House is a historic house on Main Street in Canehill, Arkansas. It is a 1-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a side-gable roof, chimneys at the sides, and additions to the rear giving it a rough T shape. A gable-roofed portico shelters the entrance, which is centered in the main three-bay facade. The portico's gable, along with the house's gable ends and roofline, have been decorated with scalloped woodwork, probably added in the 1870s. The house itself was probably built in the 1850s, and is one of Canehill's few antebellum houses, offering a distinctive combination of vernacular Greek Revival and later Victorian stylistic touches. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Greek Revival houses in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1850 Category:Houses in Washington County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Arkansas ",
