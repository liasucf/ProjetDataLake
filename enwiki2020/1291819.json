    "text": "CBS Sports is the sports division of the American television network CBS. Its headquarters are in the CBS Building on W 52nd Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, with programs produced out of Studio 43 at the CBS Broadcast Center on W 57th Street. CBS' premier sports properties include the National Football League (NFL), Southeastern Conference (SEC) football, NCAA Division I college basketball (including telecasts of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament), and PGA Tour golf, including the Masters Tournament and the PGA Championship. The online arm of CBS Sports is CBSSports.com. CBS purchased SportsLine.com in 2004, and today CBSSports.com is part of CBS Interactive. On February 26, 2018, following up on the success of their online news network CBSN, CBS Sports launched CBS Sports HQ, a 24/7, online only, linear sports news network. The network focuses entirely on sports news, results, highlights and analysis. (CBS Sports college sports and golf programming that it distributes over the air is generally made available for free via separate streams, as are a limited number of NFL national telecasts; the remainder requires a CBS All Access subscription to be viewed online, with CBS Sports Network programming requiring a TV Everywhere subscription.) CBS Sports was honored at the 59th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Advanced Media Technology for Synchronous Enhancement of Original Television Content for Interactive Use for its program March Madness on Demand. On August 31, 2013, CBS Sports rolled out its previous graphics and animation package that was first used in the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLVII. Additionally, in compliance with the Active Format Description #10 code, CBS Sports switched to a 16:9 aspect ratio letterbox presentation used for all sports programming, including the SEC on CBS and the NFL on CBS broadcasts. On November 30, 2015, CBS Sports released a new logo in order to coincide with the network's coverage of Super Bowl 50. The network also created a new on-air graphics package that debuted as part of the network's Super Bowl week programming. Following the game, the graphics package began to be utilized across all of their programming events, including their joint production of NCAA March Madness with Turner Sports. The Masters, which retains heavy production control over their event, continued to use the network's older graphical style originally unveiled in 2007 until 2019, when they debuted a new graphics package. Also, the network's Thursday Night Football game broadcasts continued to use the graphical style originally used since its debut in 2014 until its rights to that package expired in 2018. ==Programs throughout the years== ===Current programs=== * PGA Tour on CBS (1956\u2013present) ** The Masters (1956\u2013present) ** PGA Championship (1991\u2013present) * CBS Sports Spectacular (1960\u2013present) * College football (1950s\u20131966, 1968\u2013present) ** Sun Bowl (1968\u2013present) ** SEC on CBS (First pick of SEC games, 1996\u2013present) ** Army\u2013Navy Game (1962\u20131963, 1982, 1984\u20131990, 1996\u2013present) * College Basketball on CBS (1981\u2013present) ** NCAA Tournament (1982\u2013present) * NFL on CBS (1956\u20131993, 1998\u2013present) ** The NFL Today (1975\u20131993, 1998\u2013present) ** Super Bowl: I (shared with NBC), II, IV, VI, VIII, X, XII, XIV, XVI, XVIII, XXI, XXIV, XXVI, XXXV, XXXVIII, XLI, XLIV, XLVII, 50, LIII and LV * PBR on CBS (2013\u2013present) * Big3 (2019\u2013present) * Tennis on CBS ** World TeamTennis (2019\u2013present) ** Davis Cup (2020\u2013present) (USA matches only for qualifiers) * Soccer on CBS Sports ** NWSL (2020\u2013present) ** UEFA Champions League (2020\u2013present) *** UEFA Champions League final ** UEFA Europa League (2020\u2013present) ** UEFA Super Cup (2020\u2013present) * WNBA (2019\u2013present) ===Former programs=== * Major League Baseball on CBS (1947\u20131950, 1955\u20131965, 1990\u20131993) ** World Series: (Games 3 and 4), \u2013, \u2013 * Thoroughbred Racing on CBS (1952\u20131985) ** Kentucky Derby (1952\u20131974) ** Preakness Stakes (1960\u20131976) ** Belmont Stakes (1960\u20131985) * Little League World Series (1953) * College Football on CBS ** Orange Bowl (1953\u20131961; 1996\u20131998) ** Gator Bowl (1956\u20131963, 1986\u20131987, 2007\u20132010) ** Cotton Bowl Classic (1958\u20131992, 1996\u20131998) ** Blue-Gray Football Classic (1965) ** Fiesta Bowl (1974\u20131977, 1996\u20131998) ** Blockbuster/CarQuest Bowl (1991\u20131995) ** Peach Bowl (1978\u20131985) ** Big Ten Conference (1982\u20131986) ** Pac-10 Conference (1982\u20131986) ** College Football Association (1987\u20131990) ** Big East Conference (1996\u20132000) ** Navy\u2013Notre Dame (1996\u20132018, even-numbered years only) ** Mountain West Championship Game (2013\u20132014) ** Division I-AA Championship Game (1982, 1990\u20131994) * NFL on CBS (1956\u20131993, 1998\u2013present) ** Pro Bowl (1966\u20131971, 1973, 2007) ** Thursday Night Football (2014\u20132017) * NBA on CBS (1973\u20131990) * NHL on CBS (1956\u20131960, 1966\u20131972, and 1980) * Olympics on CBS ** Winter Olympic Games (1960, 1992, 1994, 1998) ** Summer Olympic Games (1960) * NASCAR on CBS (1960\u20132000) ** Daytona 500 (1979\u20132000) * National Professional Soccer League (1967) * Tennis on CBS ** US Open (1968\u20132014) ** Dockers / Visa Open (1994-2009) ** French Open (1980\u20131982) ** Miami Open (2000\u20132013) ** US Open Series (2004\u20132014) * North American Soccer League (1969, 1974\u20131976) * 1974 FIFA World Cup * Formula One (1960-1961, 1977\u20131981, 1983\u20131988, 2005\u20132006) * NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship (1982\u20131995) * NCAA Tightrope Championships (1985-2003) * Tour de France (1987\u20132010) * College World Series on CBS (1988\u20132002) * Championship Auto Racing Teams (1989\u20131991, 2002\u20132003, 2005\u20132007) * Indy Racing League (1997\u20131998) * Professional Bowlers Tour (1998\u20131999) * PGA Tour on CBS ** LPGA Championship (1999\u20132005) ** Senior Players Championship (2001\u20132006) ** Kraft Nabisco Championship (2006\u20132010) ** English Open (1996-2009) * American Le Mans Series (2005\u20132006, 2010) * Elite Xtreme Combat (2008) * Strikeforce (2009\u20132010) * Major League Lacrosse (2013\u20132017) * Arena Football League on CBS (2013\u20132018) * Alliance of American Football (2019) ==Notable personalities (present)== https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/cbs-sports/bios ===Present=== ====Play-by-play==== * NFL on CBS \u2013 Jim Nantz, Ian Eagle, Greg Gumbel, Kevin Harlan, Spero Dedes, Andrew Catalon, Tom McCarthy, Beth Mowins * PGA Tour on CBS \u2013 Jim Nantz, Verne Lundquist * SEC on CBS \u2013 Brad Nessler, Carter Blackburn * College Basketball on CBS \u2013 Jim Nantz, Verne Lundquist, Ian Eagle, Kevin Harlan, Spero Dedes, Brian Anderson, Andrew Catalon, Carter Blackburn, Tom McCarthy, Brad Nessler * NCAA March Madness \u2013 Jim Nantz, Ian Eagle, Kevin Harlan, Spero Dedes, Brian Anderson, Andrew Catalon, Carter Blackburn, Brad Nessler, * UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League on CBS -
