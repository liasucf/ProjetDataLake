    "text": "Hay's bridge is used to determine the Inductance of an inductor with a high Q factor. Maxwell's bridge is only appropriate for measuring the values for inductors with a medium quality factor. Thus, the bridge is the advanced form of Maxwell\u2019s bridge. One of the arms of a Hay's bridge has an accurately characterized capacitor used to balance the unknown inductance value. The other arms contain resisters. == References == Category:Electrical meters Category:Bridge circuits Category:Measuring instruments ",
