Thompson also collaborated with Harri Hursti in the Black Box Voting projects in Leon County, Florida and Emery County, Utah. Thompson's GEMS central tabulator hack was achieved by inserting a Visual Basic script onto the GEMS server machine at election headquarters. Both the Visual Basic script hack by Thompson and the memory card hack by Hursti Hack can be seen in HBO's \"Hacking Democracy\" where Hursti and Thompson hacked into Diebold Election Systems's voting machines and central tabulator system in Leon County, Florida proving its vulnerability.HBO's documentary \"Hacking Democracy\" ==Education== Thompson completed his bachelors, masters and Ph.D. in applied mathematics at the Florida Institute of Technology. ==Books== * Sullivan, Bob, and Hugh Thompson.
