    "text": "James Richard Clausen (born September 21, 1987) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) from 2010 to 2015. He played college football at Notre Dame, and was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He was also a member of the Chicago Bears and Baltimore Ravens. ==High school career== Hall Trophy, January 2007 Clausen had an outstanding prep career at Oaks Christian School in Westlake Village, California. In 2006, he threw 49 touchdown passes for the season to lead the Lions to their first ever Division III state title over Cardinal Newman High School (Santa Rosa, CA). Clausen never lost a football game he started in his prep career (42\u20130). He threw for 10,677 yards in his career at Oaks Christian. As a senior, Clausen won the 2006 Hall Trophy for the nation's top high school football player and was also named \"Offensive Player of the Year\" by the USA Today. Clausen was also named the Co Player of the Year, along with USC running back Joe McKnight, by Parade Magazine. As the younger brother of two former NCAA Division I quarterbacks\u2014Casey and Rick Clausen, who both played at Tennessee\u2014Jimmy Clausen gained media attention very early. Beginning in eighth grade, his parents paid his tutelage under professional quarterbacks coach Steve Clarkson. During his junior season, a Sports Illustrated feature dubbed him \"The Kid with The Golden Arm\". Recruiting analysts considered him a \"once in a decade\" quarterback talent and ranked him as the #1 overall prospect of the 2007 high school class. Because of his quick release, some in the media compared him to Joe Namath. Critics have questioned whether Clausen's success in high school was largely a product of his team\u2014containing almost a dozen players that went on to play for NCAA Division I Bowl Subdivision teams, including a highly ranked running back, Marc Tyler\u2014and the inferior talent level of its opponents. Many of these critics pointed to the 2007 U.S. Army All-American Bowl in which Clausen was outplayed by fellow 2007 quarterback recruit, Ryan Mallett. Further, Clausen's age is a subject of criticism: he started kindergarten at six and repeated sixth grade, thus he was 19 years old at the time of his early graduation. On April 22, 2006, Clausen verbally committed to the University of Notre Dame. He was the most highly touted recruit for the Fighting Irish since the arrival of Ron Powlus in 1993. Clausen announced his verbal commitment at the College Football Hall of Fame in South Bend, Indiana, after arriving in a stretch Hummer limousine. He also said his goal was to win multiple national titles with the Irish. ===High school awards and honors=== *2006 Hall Trophy *2006 USA Today Offensive Player of the Year ==College career== Michigan. Clausen in 2007. Clausen, who graduated from high school one semester early, enrolled at Notre Dame on January 16, 2007. In Notre Dame's only preseason practice open to the media, Clausen threw only a number of short passes, casting some doubt on the strength of his arm after off-season elbow surgery. Following Notre Dame's opening loss to Georgia Tech in the 2007 season, Clausen was named the starting quarterback, but would win only one of his first six starts (against UCLA) and was replaced by backup quarterback Evan Sharpley during Notre Dame's loss to Boston College on October 13, 2007. Citing non-specific injuries to Clausen (who had been sacked 23 times), head coach Charlie Weis named Sharpley as the starting quarterback for Notre Dame's game against USC on October 20, 2007. After sitting out Notre Dame's losses to USC and Navy, Clausen was again named the starter for their game against Air Force. Clausen finished his freshman year having completed 56.3% of his passes for 1,254 yards, with 7 touchdowns (plus two rushing TDs) and 6 interceptions and a passing efficiency of 103.85, and he was sacked a team-record 34 times. During his sophomore season, he completed 60.9% of his passes for 3172 yards, 25 touchdowns and 17 interceptions and a 132.5 efficiency rating which placed him as the 44th ranked quarterback in NCAA Division I FBS. He led the Fighting Irish to a 7\u20136 record, culminating in a 49\u201321 victory against Hawaii in the Hawaii Bowl \u2014 which ended Notre Dame's NCAA-record nine-game bowl losing streak. Clausen set Notre Dame bowl records with 406 yards passing and five touchdowns and was named the bowl's co-MVP. In his junior season, Clausen was named midseason All-American by Sporting News. He finished the season with 3,722 yards passing, a 68.8% completion rate, 161.42 passer rating, 28 touchdowns, and four interceptions. On Monday, December 7, 2009, Clausen declared that he would forgo his senior season at Notre Dame and enter the NFL draft following news of the firing of head coach Charlie Weis. Clausen returned to Notre Dame during the 2011 off-season to finish his degree in sociology. ===Statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! rowspan=2 | Year !! rowspan=2 | Team !! colspan=8 | Passing !! colspan=4 | Rushing |- ! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! |- | 2007 || Notre Dame || 138 || 245 || 56.3 || 1,254 || 5.1 || 7 || 6 || 103.9 || 62 || \u2212187 || \u22123.0 || 2 |- | 2008 || Notre Dame || 268 || 440 || 60.9 || 3,172 || 7.2 || 25 || 17 || 132.5 || 54 || \u221273 || \u22121.4 || 0 |- | 2009 || Notre Dame || 289 || 425 || 68.0 || 3,722 || 8.8 || 28 || 4 || 161.4 || 59 || \u221295 || \u22121.6 || 3 |- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"background:#eee;\" | colspan=2 | Career || 695 || 1,110 || 62.6 || 8,148 || 7.3 || 60 || 27 || 137.2 || 175 || \u2212355 || \u22122.0 || 5 |} Source: ===College awards and honors=== * 2008 Hawaii Bowl Co-MVP with Golden Tate * 2009 Second- team All-America (CBS Sportsline) ==Professional career== Clausen announced his intention to enter the 2010 NFL Draft on December 7, 2009. Clausen was expected to be one of the top quarterbacks available in the draft, along with former Heisman Trophy winner Sam Bradford. He was projected by many to be a Top-10 pick. Surprisingly, however, he was not selected in the first round of the draft, with Bradford and Florida's Tim Tebow selected ahead of him. He was selected by the Carolina Panthers with the 16th pick of the 2nd round (48th overall). Analysts attributed his slide to his cocky demeanor and \"persnickety smirkness.\" ===Carolina Panthers=== On July 28, 2010, Clausen signed a four- year, $4.2 million contract with the Panthers, which includes $2.53 million in guarantees. Clausen made his NFL debut in a loss against the New York Giants in the 2010 season opener, after starting quarterback Matt Moore was sidelined with a concussion. After poor play by Matt Moore in a week 2 matchup against the Buccaneers, Clausen took over late in the game. He completed 7 of 13 passes for 59 yards and an interception and one fumbled snap, and led a 17-play drive that was stopped inside the 5-yard line.http://www.nfl.com/players/JimmyClausen/gamelogs?id=CLA709185 NFL.com Jimmy Clausen gamelogs The following week, Clausen started his first NFL game against the Bengals, completing 16 of 33 passes for 188 yards and an interception and three fumbled snaps, losing two. During the game TV cameras caught wide receiver Steve Smith walking over to Clausen, who was talking with an assistant coach, and screaming at the rookie. Smith walked away, but returned and said something else before being escorted away by tight end Jeff King. At that point, Smith threw down a cup of Gatorade. The incident was later downplayed by Smith.Associated Press Retrieved October 1, 2010 It was the second time there had been communication issues between Smith and Clausen. On May 6, 2010, a report on the website \"Pro Football Talk\" stated that, \"Steve Smith 'basically thinks Jimmy is a punk.'\" The website later reported that Smith sent a text message to Clausen that the report was \"B.S.\".Pro Football Talk.com Retrieved October 1, 2010Pro Football Talk.com Retrieved October 1, 2010 In Clausen's 2nd NFL start (a week 4 match-up against the New Orleans Saints), Clausen went 11 of 21 for 146 yards and completed his 1st NFL touchdown pass to RB Jonathan Stewart. After just three NFL starts and being pulled in week 5, Clausen was benched after completing 47 percent of his passes with one touchdown and three interceptions.

Clausen finished the 2010 season with 157 completions out of 299 attempts (52.5%), 1,558 yards with 3 touchdowns and 9 interceptions. He was sacked 33 times and fumbled 9 times, losing two.Yasinkas, Pat. (October 18, 2010) \"Panthers to start Matt Moore again\" ESPN.com Retrieved October 18, 2010. In 2011, the Panthers used their number one overall draft pick to select Cam Newton of Auburn. After a four- game preseason competition, Panthers coaches decided that Newton would be named the starter for the 2011 NFL Season. Clausen had no improvement over his 2010 regular season performance in the 2011 preseason, finishing 24/46 passing (52.2%) and 260 yards and a 5.70 average with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions and was sacked 7 times in 53 dropbacks and had a quarterback rating of 58.2, similar to his 2010 regular season performance. The Panthers also signed veteran QB Derek Anderson to the team. Clausen was then demoted to third string. In the 2012 pre-season, Clausen was 19 for 37 (51.4%) 252 yards and two touchdowns and like 2011 never took the field in regular season play. On August 31, 2013, the Panthers waived an injured Clausen. He passed through waivers unclaimed, and ended up on the Panthers' injured reserve list. ===Chicago Bears=== Clausen in 2014. Clausen was signed by the Chicago Bears on June 5, 2014. During the preseason he competed with Jordan Palmer for the second string spot; Clausen eventually won the job. On December 17, Marc Trestman announced that Clausen would take over the starting quarterback position from Jay Cutler. Clausen completed 26 of 48 passes for 181 yards, two touchdowns, one interception and a 77 passer rating in a 20\u201314 loss to the Detroit Lions.

He was driving someone who was of legal drinking age to a liquor store to buy alcohol. According to published reports, Clausen entered a pre-trial diversion program that erased the citation since he stayed out of trouble for the following 12 months. On November 22, 2009, Clausen was involved in an altercation outside of a South Bend bar. Sources indicate that Clausen was there with family and teammates following the team's senior day loss to Connecticut. It was reported that upon his departure, Clausen was punched in the face outside of the pub. A South Bend Police Department spokesperson stated that no police report was filed over that weekend involving Clausen. Reports indicate that Clausen was left with a black eye, which was clearly visible in the broadcast of Notre Dame's next football game. A later report of this incident indicated that the other subject involved in this incident allegedly shoved Clausen's girlfriend. It was reported that Clausen then shoved the subject away prior to Clausen being punched. ==Further reading== *. ==References== ==External links== * Chicago Bears bio * Carolina Panthers bio * Notre Dame Fighting Irish bio Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Carolina Panthers players Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Baltimore Ravens players Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football players Category:People from Thousand Oaks, California Category:Players of American football from California Category:Sportspeople from Ventura County, California ",
