Musicweb-international.com CD Review, Les Rarissimes de Andr\u00e9 Jolivet, Hubert Culot, 2004. ==Background== Jolivet associated the sound of the flute with \"the breath of life\" and was particularly fascinated by its \"primitive\" connotations.Musicweb-international.com CD Review, Dominy Clements In 1944, he wrote Chant de Linos for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire. Jean-Pierre Rampal won the First Prize and he and Jolivet became close friends. Five years later, the composer wrote the Flute Concerto for Rampal. ==Overview== The concerto is cast in four short movements that follow a slow-fast-slow-fast structure reminiscent of the 17th-century Italian sonata da chiesa. Although tonally adventurous,Musicweb-international CD Review, Brian Reinhart the work is notable for its melodic simplicity and lack of gratuitous virtuosity, which sets it apart from the Romantic tradition of showy concertos. The piece starts with a soft, melancholy melody but gets more and more agitated and dissonant as the strings enter, although some brighter passages still appear occasionally. After the dark slow movement the work ends with an Allegro risoluto and a propulsive, thrilling finale.Allmusic.com Work Description, Chris Morrison As critic Antoine Gol\u00e9a remarked: ==Movements== # Andante cantabile # Allegro scherzando # Largo # Allegro risoluto == Recordings == * Jean-Pierre Rampal (flute) - Orchestre Lamoureux - Conductor: Andr\u00e9 Jolivet - Recorded in 1966, Warner - Erato 2564 61320-2 (2004). * Alexander Korneev (flute) - Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra - Conductor: Andr\u00e9 Jolivet, Melodia D-017-995-8 (1966). * Aur\u00e8le Nicolet (flute) - Orchestre R\u00e9gional Provence C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur - Conductor: Philippe Bender, Lyrinx 8211/029 (1983). * Susan Milan (flute) - City of London Sinfonia - Conductor: Richard Hickox, Chandos Records CHAN 8840 (1989). * Petri Alanko (flute) - Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra - Conductor: Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Ondine Records - ODE 802-2 (1993). * Manuela Wiesler (flute) - Tapiola Sinfonietta - Conductor: Paavo J\u00e4rvi, Bis Records - 739 (1996). * Sarah Louvion (flute) - Ensemble du Festival Fl\u00fbte- Haubois en Livradois - Conductor: Ariel Zuckermann, Farao Classics - B108032 (2008). ==References== Category:Compositions by Andr\u00e9 Jolivet Jolivet, Andre, 1 Category:1949 compositions ",
