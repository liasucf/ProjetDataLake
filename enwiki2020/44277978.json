    "text": "Hamsanadam (pronounced hamsan\u0101dam) is a r\u0101gam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is a pentatonic scale (audava r\u0101gam, which means \"of 5\"), as it is sung in current days.Raganidhi by P. Subba Rao, Pub. 1964, The Music Academy of Madras It is a derived scale (janya r\u0101gam), as it does not have all the seven swaras (musical notes), from the 60th Melakarta r\u0101gam Neetimati. == Structure and Lakshana == Hamsanadam scale with shadjam at C Hamsanadam, as it is sung now-a-days, is a symmetric scale that does not contain gandharam and dhaivatam. It is called an audava r\u0101gam, in Carnatic music classification (as it has 5 notes in both ascending and descending scales). Its \u0101roha\u1e47a-avaroha\u1e47a structure is as follows (see swaras in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms): *\u0101roha\u1e47a : *avaroha\u1e47a : This scale uses the notes shadjam, chatusruti rishabham, prati madhyamam, panchamam and kakali nishadam. == Other structures == Earlier structure of this scale were as follows:Ragas in Carnatic music by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications *Ascending scale : *Descending scale : In the above, shatsruti dhaivatam is added in the scale compared to current usage (shadava scale with 6 notes in ascendinga and descending scale), with a vakra prayoga (zig-zag descending scale). === Graha bhedham === Hamsanadam's notes when shifted using Graha bhedham, yields two pentatonic r\u0101gams, Gambhiranata and Bhupalam. Graha bhedham is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the shadjam to the next note in the r\u0101gam. For more details and illustrations of this concept refer Graha bhedham on Gambhiranata. == Popular compositions == Hamsanadam has a few popular compositions: *kalyANa rAmA by oottukkADu Sri vEnkaTAkavi *Bantureethi Koluvu by Tyagaraja *Niye Paramukham by Papanasam Sivan *Kripanidhe by Muthiah Bhagavatar *pADa vENDumE by Sri MM Dandapani Desikar *Bharama Ee Baluni by G N Balasubramaniam == Film Songs== ===Language:Tamil=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Song !Movie !Composer !Singer |- |Iravum Nilavum |Karnan |Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy |P.
