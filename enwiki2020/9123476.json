Steve Bloomer scored for Derby. ==Background== This was an FA Cup final between local rivals Nottingham Forest and Derby County. The two teams had faced each other in the First Division only 5 days previously. In that game Derby had won 5-0 making them favourites for the final. Though in that game only 5 of the 11 players for Forest also played in the final. ==Route to the Final== ===Nottingham Forest=== ===Derby County=== ==Match== Forest went ahead early after a goal from Capes, but Bloomer scored an equalizer with a header. The turning point was near the midway point. Richards tried to lob from a Mcinnes cross, but Fryer was easily first to it. The custodian, however, dropped the ball at the feet of Capes, who turned it in to the empty net. Forest lost a player with an injury, but McPherson killed off the contest.Derby County: The Story of a football club (abridged sample, page 20), Anton Rippon, 2013, A match report taken from the back of a John Player's cigarette cardJohn Player & Sons cigarette card, No.4 of 50 in a series \"Association Cup Winners\": Notts Forest, 1898 (with the front showing photographs of the winning players). reads: \"John Goodall who played on the right wing for Derby County unselfishly summed up this game by his remark \"the best team won\". All the famous critics had predicted an easy victory for Derby, and credit must be extended to the Forest not only for their fight against redoubtable opponents but against popular sentiment. The Forest forwards were much more in touch with each other than was the case with the opposition front line. Forman, McPherson and Wragg forming a combination that would be hard to equal. Capers [sic] scored twice for the Forest, McPherson scoring their third goal. Bloomer scored the only goal for Derby. Result: Notts Forest 3 goals, Derby County 1 goal.\" The post match photograph of Nottingham Forest with the cup was taken wearing Derby County's white shirts as the Garibaldi Red of Forest was considered too dull so the photograph was retaken.
