Expelled from Spain in 1492, he settled at Tunis, where in 1507 he wrote Sefer ha-Zikkaron, a supercommentary on Rashi. The manuscript remained unprinted till 1845, when it was discovered in a Jewish library in Tunis. The work has several prefaces, one of which, written by the author himself, recounts his sufferings at the time of the expulsion from Spain. == Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography == *David Caz\u00e8s, Notes Bibliographiques sur la Litt\u00e9rature Juive Tunisienne ==References== * Category:Jewish writers Category:Spanish rabbis Category:15th-century births Category:16th-century deaths Category:Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 ",
