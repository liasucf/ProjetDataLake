    "text": "Carlton Your Doorman is a 1980 television pilot for an animated spin-off of the live-action sitcom Rhoda (1974\u201378) that was never picked up as a series. It originally aired as a \"CBS Special Presentation\" on May 21, 1980 and has never been rebroadcast. The episode relates the adventures of Carlton, the Doorman (voiced by Lorenzo Music), the previously off-screen character from Rhoda who was heard via the intercom but almost never seen (except only his arm would occasionally appear from doors and he was once shown dancing while wearing a gorilla mask). It was produced by MTM Enterprises and was the only animated production from MTM, although The Duck Factory \u2013 a sitcom set in an animation production company \u2013 included cartoon segments, and the closing credits of many MTM series included animated clothing and accessories superimposed on Mimsie the Cat. ==Synopsis== Carlton is a New York City doorman and a misfit who seeks to better himself and his position in society. In the pilot episode, Carlton seeks a replacement for his boss's wife's dog, Punkin, who died while in his care. He tries everything to replace the dog so his boss doesn't find out.Terrace, Vincent.
