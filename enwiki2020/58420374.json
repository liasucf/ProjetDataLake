    "text": "Axial and sagittal CT views of a vertebral hemangioma T1, T2, and STIR MRI images of a vertebral hemangioma A vertebral hemangioma (VH) is a vascular lesion within a vertebral body. Commonly, these are benign lesions that are found incidentally during radiology studies for other indications. Vertebral hemangiomas are a common etiology estimated to be found in 10-12% of humans at autopsy.Blecher, R., et al., Management of symptomatic vertebral hemangioma: follow-up of 6 patients. J Spinal Disord Tech, 2011. 24(3): p. 196-201.Halpern, C.H. and M.S. Grady, Neurosurgery, in Schwartz's Principles of Surgery, 10e, F.C. Brunicardi, et al., Editors. 2014, McGraw-Hill Education: New York, NY.Pastushyn, A.I., E.I. Slin'ko, and G.M. Mirzoyeva, Vertebral hemangiomas: diagnosis, management, natural history and clinicopathological correlates in 86 patients. Surg Neurol, 1998. 50(6): p. 535-47. They are benign in nature and frequently asymptomatic. Symptoms, if they do occur, are usually related to large hemangiomas, trauma, the hormonal and hemodynamic changes of pregnancy (causing intra-spinal bleeding), or osseous expansion and extra-osseous extension into surround soft tissues or epidural region of the spinal canal.Chi, J.H., G.T. Manley, and D. Chou, Pregnancy-related vertebral hemangioma. Case report, review of the literature, and management algorithm. Neurosurg Focus, 2005. 19(3): p.

Journal of Orthopaedic Case Reports, 2017. 7(2): p. 7-10. == Etiology and epidemiology == Vertebral hemangiomas are hamartomatous lesions, meaning that they arise from dysembryogenetic origin. They are made up of thin-walled vessels infiltrating the medullary cavity between bone trabeculae and are usually confined to the vertebral body.Rodallec, M.H., et al., Diagnostic imaging of solitary tumors of the spine: what to do and say. Radiographics, 2008. 28(4): p. 1019-41. VHs are commonly seen incidentally while obtaining imaging for other indications. Only around 1% of hemangiomas become symptomatic. When symptomatic, they can cause pain and myelopathy by intra-spinal bleeding, bony expansion or extra- osseous extension into surround soft tissue or the posterior neural elements. Highly vascular (cavernous type) hemangiomas can produce neurologic deficits without prominent evidence of spinal cord compression. The deficits in these cases are probably attributable to blood flow disturbances in the spinal cord. == Imaging characteristics == On computed tomography (CT) or radiograph, VHs can cause rarefaction with vertical striations (often referred to as corduroy pattern) or a coarse honeycomb appearance. A polka-dot appearance on CT scan represents a cross-section of reinforced trabeculae.Slon, V., et al., Vertebral Hemangiomas and Their Correlation With Other Pathologies. Spine (Phila Pa 1976), 2016. 41(8): p. E481-8. Baudrez, Galant, and VandeBerg found that MRI appearance is dictated by histology of the tumor\u2014Vascularity, interstitial edema, and interspersed fat.Baudrez, V., C. Galant, and B.C. Vande Berg, Benign vertebral hemangioma: MR-histological correlation. Skeletal Radiol, 2001. 30(8): p. 442-6. The presence of high or moderate signal intensity on both T1 and T2 images is related to the ration of fat to vessels and edema. For example, a VH with a high concentration of fat and a relatively low make-up of vessels and edema would show a high signal intensity on T1-weighted spin-echo images and intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted fast spin echo images. Whereas a VH made-up of nearly equal portion of fat and vessels and edema would show intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. == Differential diagnosis == The differential diagnosis for lesions with similar radiologic appearance to VH includes but is not limited to hemangioblastoma, lymphangioma, bone metastasis, Ewing Sarcoma, and spinal dural arteriovenous fistula.Bemporad, J.A., et al., Pseudohemangioma of the vertebra: an unusual radiographic manifestation of primary Ewing's sarcoma.

Clin Nucl Med, 2017. 42(5): p. 368-370. == Treatment == Symptomatic VHs have been treated with surgery, transarterial embolization, direct ethanol injection, radiotherapy, and vertebroplasty, each with varying degrees of success. Each of these methods can be indicated in specific clinical settings. ==References== Category:Vertebral column disorders Category:Lesion ",
