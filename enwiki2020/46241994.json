    "text": "The American Civics Test (U.S. Civics Test / American Citizenship Test / U.S Citizenship Test) is an examination that all immigrants must pass to gain United States citizenship. The test is prepared in English and the candidate must score at least 60 percent for a successful pass. There are 100 civics questions that cover various topics in U.S. history, constitution and government. For the naturalization process the applicant will be asked 10 randomly selected questions. Arizona became the first state requiring students to pass the civics test before high school graduation. It is expected that all states will have implemented this requirement by September 17, 2017, the 230th anniversary of the United States Constitution. Civics Education Initiative led by the nonprofit Joe Foss Institute aims to promote the knowledge to all students countrywide. As of 2019, it is still not required by all 50 states.https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-passes-law-requiring-students-pass- civics-test-231736007.html ==References== Category:Citizenship Category:United States law Category:United States nationality law ",
