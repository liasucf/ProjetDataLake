It is classified as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1948. The custom house was built in 1358 and enlarged in 1389. It was heavily damaged by British and American bombing raids on 11 August 1944 and left as a ruin for almost two decades before being rebuilt according to the medieval plans by architect Robert Will (1910\u20131998). The Ancienne Douane currently houses a restaurant and a covered market. ==References== ==External links== *Ancienne Douane on archi-wiki.org *Marie Marty: Quand l\u2019Ancienne douane \u00e9tait le Rungis de Strasbourg, Rue89 Strasbourg, 24 December 2015 Category:Gothic architecture in Strasbourg Category:14th-century architecture Category:Custom houses Category:Tourist attractions in Strasbourg Category:Monuments historiques of Bas-Rhin Category:Restaurants in Strasbourg Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1358 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1389 Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1965 ",
