    "text": "An Foras \u00c1iseanna Saothair (), referred to in English as the Training and Employment Authority and commonly known as F\u00c1S (), was a state agency in Ireland with responsibility for assisting those seeking employment. It was established in January 1988 under the Labour Services Act, 1987 and was run by a board appointed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, composed of employer and trade union representatives. ==Overview== The authority, whose Irish language name literally translates as \"the Labour Facilities Foundation\", was the successor to An Chomhairle Oili\u00fana (\"the training council\", commonly referred to as AnCO), the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency. The Irish word f\u00e1s formed by the acronym means \"growth\", and the authority was created in 1980s Ireland during the long economic downturn of the time. The authority ran a number of JobCentres in Ireland to facilitate those seeking employment, however it had occasionally been criticised, not least for the perception that it is simply a scheme to remove people from unemployment statistics \u2013 it had also been criticised for the expense of running it at almost \u20ac1 billion per annum. The authority ran training courses in various fields, through regional centres, although some of this work was transferred to institutes of technology \u2013 including the apprenticeships in various fields that it regulated. ==Apprenticeships== Apprenticeships regulated by F\u00c1S include: {| |- |valign=top| *Agricultural Mechanic *Aircraft Mechanic *Brick and Stonelaying *Cabinet Making *Carpentry and Joinery *Construction plant fitting *Electrical *Electrical Instrumentation *Electronic Security Systems |valign=top| *Fitting *Floor and Wall Tiling *Heavy Vehicle Mechanics *Industrial Insulation *Instrumentation *Metal Fabrication *Motor Mechanics *Painting and Decorating |valign=top| *Plastering *Plumbing *Print Media *Refrigeration and Air Conditioning *Sheet Metalworking *Toolmaking *Vehicle Body Repairs *Wood Machining |} ==Geoghegan controversy== Traditionally, the Director General of F\u00c1S was a board member of Forf\u00e1s. Brian Geoghegan (spouse of Mary Harney, former Minister for Health and Children) retired as Chairman of F\u00c1S at the end of 2005 and was replaced by Peter McLoone. There had been some controversy regarding Geoghegan's position when it emerged he was also a board member of IBEC, the employer's union of Ireland. IBEC were critical of F\u00c1S at times claiming, at various intervals, that some F\u00c1S courses and schemes were a waste of money, taking potential employees off the live register who could otherwise be employed in mainstream positions. The fact that Geoghegan was married to then-Minister Mary Harney, who was formerly the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, led to some claims he had a conflict of interest. ==Expenses scandal== In September 2008, the then-Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Mary Coughlan announced that the Comptroller and Auditor General would undertake an investigation of F\u00c1S expenditure in light of what she saw as the evident public disquiet on the issue. The annual budget for F\u00c1S at the time was around \u20ac1 billion. In November 2008, The D\u00e1il Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also began an investigation. However, it was information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by journalist and Senator Shane Ross which he published in the Sunday Independent that brought the F\u00c1S expenses scandal to a head.In the spotlight: How spending saga unfolded The documents obtained by Senator Ross showed that some \u20ac643,000 had been spent over the course of four years on transatlantic travel promoting the agency's Science Challenge Programme. The expenses included items such as first class air fares, business class air fares and fares paid for by F\u00c1S for spouses, rounds of golf as well as nail and beauty treatment. It also revealed that three Government ministers and two junior ministers had attended in that time for inconsequential reasons. This revelation caused major controversy and pressure was brought to bear on F\u00c1S Director General Roddy Molloy to resign, although then-Taoiseach Brian Cowen spoke in support of Molloy both publicly and in the D\u00e1il. Molloy went so far as to appear on the Pat Kenny Show on RT\u00c9 Radio 1 to defend the expenses incurred. However, under ever increasing pressure, Molloy resigned as Director General on 25 November 2008. In September 2009 the board announced it would resign and the Irish Times announced that legislation to restructure the organisation was expected in the following four weeks. The report into the breakdown of internal controls in F\u00c1S by the Comptroller and Auditor General was published in 2010.Special Report 73: Internal Control and Governance in F\u00c1S, January 2010 ==Dissolution== In July 2011 the Minister for Education and Skills announced that F\u00c1S would be replaced by a new agency, named SOLAS, that would have responsibility for all public funding of further education and training. The training function of F\u00c1S was absorbed into the restructured local Vocational Education Committees which were retitled Education and Training Boards in July 2013.27 July, 2011 \u2013 New further education and training authority, SOLAS, launched by Minister Quinn- Government agrees to wind down F\u00c1S ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Career and technical education Category:Former state-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland Category:Apprenticeship Category:Labour in Ireland Category:1988 establishments in Ireland Category:2013 disestablishments in Ireland ",
