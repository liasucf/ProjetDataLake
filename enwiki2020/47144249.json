The daughter of painter George de Forest Brush, she produced a biography of him in 1970, and her own memoirs published posthumously. She was married firstly to the artist William Robert Pearmain, and later to Dr. Harold Bowditch. She became involved in costume work for plays but sought spiritual concerns and found the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1926, going on Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pilgrimage and serving in the arts inside and outside the religion's community She was active in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith community of Greater Boston, elected as Chair of the Boston Spiritual Assembly and later to the first local assembly of Peterborough, New Hampshire. ==Early years== Nancy Douglas Bowditch, was born Nancy Brush in Paris on July 4, 1890, daughter of painter George de Forest Brush, and Mary \"Mittie\" Taylor (Whelpley) Brush, a sculptor and inventor. In Dublin the family was neighbors and close friends with Samuel Clemens and his daughter Jean Clemens, who died about 1909, and then the Clemens moved away. Nancy met William Robert Pearmain in America in 1906 and he followed her in 1907 to Europe. They married in 1909, she betrothed as \"Nancy Douglas\", and he a student of her father's. They had a daughter born May 1911. The Brush family interacted with \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in the area in July and August 1912, especially during an annual out-of-doors play as well he visited their farm. Pearmain died unexpectedly in September. Nancy moved from place to place until she married Harvard graduate Dr. Harold Bowditch in October 1916. ==Spiritual search== Bowditch became more involved with costume work for theatre productions. While her life was going well she also felt \"something was wanting in my existence and couldn't put a finger on ... I then began to seek for that missing link, going to most every church and attending various meetings. ... (and) hearing of a meeting to be held in Boston about the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\" > I'll never forget entering the large hall and seeing around me such a > different type of gathering from the usual Boston crowd. Here were both rich > and poor, along with every race. Many were black. I listened to a wonderful > talk on the Faith by Mr. Harry Randall and was so thrilled! Afterwards I > made my way straight to the table where books were being sold in order to > learn more about the subject. I picked out as many as could be comfortably > carried home on the streetcar, then found to my dismay that I didn't have > enough money with which to pay for them! The person at the book stand told > me it was all right to take them home and pay at the next meeting. This may have been an event the Boston Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community hosted called a \"World Unity Conference\" in 1926 as part of a series sponsored by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of the United States and covered in the Boston Evening Transcript.
