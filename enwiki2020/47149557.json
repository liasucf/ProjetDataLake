    "text": "Convento de Santa Dorotea The Convento de Santa Dorotea is an Augustinian nun's convent in Burgos, Castile and Le\u00f3n, Spain. It is a Gothic construction, and dates back to 1387, when Dorotea Rodriguez Valderrama, along with other devout women formed a nun's community at the old church of Santa Maria la Blanca. The community adopted the rule of St. Augustine in 1429 with the support of Bishop Pablo de Santamar\u00eda. In 1457 they moved to the church of San Andr\u00e9s, until in 1470 they settled in the current location in the barrio of San Pedro y San Felices. Among the many benefactors who favored the monastery was King John II of Castile. Tombs of note include those of Alonso de Ortega (died 1501), and Bishop Juan de Ortega, the work of Nicholas de Vergara, 1516. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Burgos Category:Monasteries in Castile and Le\u00f3n Category:Gothic architecture in Burgos Category:1387 establishments in Europe Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1470 Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1470 Category:14th- century establishments in Castile ",
