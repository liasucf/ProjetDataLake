The Auburn Tigers won the SIAA. ==Composite eleven== Big Thigpen of Auburn was a unanimous selection. The composite All- Southern eleven formed by the selection of 18 sporting writers culled by the Atlanta Constitution included: *Enoch Brown, end and captain for Vanderbilt, unanimous selection. Known as \"Nuck,\" he was also a Rhodes Scholar. *Tom Brown, tackle for Vanderbilt, unanimous selection. He played professional football with the Toledo Maroons and was later a prominent physician of Toledo. \"He had no peers in his orthopedic ability and contributed greatly to Toledo medicine.\" *Red Harris, fullback for Auburn. One writer describes his featured role in the offense: \"Coach Donahue loved the fullback dive and would run the play over and over again before sending the elusive Newell wide on a sweep.\" *R. N. MacCallum, guard for Sewanee. MacCallum was later a reverend serving several parishes. *Bob McWhorter, halfback for Georgia. He was the school's first All-American, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954. Sportswriter Dick Jemison said \"When you mention football to an Athens fan its definition is Bob McWhorter, and vice-versa.\" He was selected for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869-1919 era. McWhorter later had a lengthy law career. *Kirk Newell, halfback and captain for Auburn. Newell gained 1,707 yards that year, 46% of the team's entire offensive output; and 5,800 yards rushing, 350 yards receiving, and 1,200 yards on punt returns for his career. *David Paddock, quarterback for Georgia. He is the only player in school history to have a petition circulated by the student body requesting that he play for the Bulldogs. *Boozer Pitts, center for Auburn. He later coached and was once professor of mathematics at Auburn. *Robbie Robinson, end for Auburn. Robinson is selected at the end position for several all-time Auburn teams. *Big Thigpen, guard for Auburn, unanimous selection. The Atlanta Constitution claimed he \"rated as good as, if not better than, any guard in the south.\" *Paul Turner, tackle for Georgia. His defensive work in the rivalry game against Georgia Tech was cited as helping the Bulldogs on the way to a 14-0 victory. ==Composite overview== Enoch Brown, Tom Brown, and Big Thigpen were unanimous selections. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"27%\" | Name ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"13%\" | Position ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"14%\" | School ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"10%\" | First-team selections |- align=\"left\" | Enoch Brown ||End || Vanderbilt||18 |- align=\"left\" | Tom Brown ||Tackle || Vanderbilt || 18 |- align=\"left\" | Big Thigpen ||Guard || Auburn || 18 |- align=\"left\" | Bob McWhorter ||Halfback ||Georgia|| 17 |- align=\"left\" | Kirk Newell ||Halfback ||Auburn || 16 |- align=\"left\" | Boozer Pitts || Center|| Auburn || 14 |- align=\"left\" | David Paddock || Quarterback|| Georgia || 13 |- align=\"left\" | Robbie Robinson || End|| Auburn || 11 |- align=\"left\" | Red Harris|| Halfback || Auburn|| 9 |- align=\"left\" | Ammie Sikes|| Fullback || Vanderbilt|| 9 |- align=\"left\" |Paul Turner||Tackle||Georgia||7 |- align=\"left\" |Tom Dutton||Tackle/Guard||LSU||7 |- align=\"left\" | Hugh Morgan|| Center|| Vanderbilt|| 7 |- align=\"left\" | Red Rainey || Halfback|| Tennessee|| 6 |- align=\"left\" | R.
