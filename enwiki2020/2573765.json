    "text": "Woronora Heights is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Woronora Heights is located 29 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. Woronora is a separate suburb, to the north. Most streets in Woronora Heights are named after birds. ==History== Woronora is derived from an Aboriginal word wooloonora, meaning 'black rock'. It is believed to have been named by Surveyor Dixon in 1828.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 250 ==Landmarks== Woronora Heights is bounded by the Woronora River in the west, the top of the escarpment in the north and the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board pipeline in the east and south. The Woronora Reservoir is one of the sources of Sydney's water supply. The Woronora Plateau, is a geographical region adjacent to the Sydney Plain. Slightly higher in altitude, it is capped with Hawkesbury Sandstone. It is often hotter in summer and colder in winter than Sydney. The Woronora River flows through the deeply dissected plateau to the Georges River from near the sources of the Port Hacking, within the Sutherland Shire. ==Fire trail protests== There have been various protests organised relating to proposals to open the fire trail linking Woronora Heights to the Woronora valley to the north to through traffic. While some residents want the trail to be opened to general traffic, the majority of residents in Woronora Heights and the Woronora valley want to preserve the fire trail for emergency access and to protect the wildlife that use the bushland corridor the fire trail runs through. In 2006 a proposal to open the fire trail for bus access was reviewed by an Independent Hearing and Assessment Panel organised by Sutherland Shire Council. After reviewing submissions from resident groups supporting and opposing the proposal, the Panel agreed unanimously that opening the fire trail to buses is not in the public interest. In the same week, the State Government declared the fire trail area \"environmentally protected\", making opening the fire trail to buses or other through traffic a prohibited development. In July 2014 Sutherland Shire Council confirmed that the fire trail would remain closed to through traffic (except when emergency access is required). This was a unanimous vote by all 15 councillors.Fire trail to remain off-limits St George :Leader 24 July 2014 However, not all residents agreed.Open this fire trail, as an extension of Bundanoon Rd Woronora Heights Fix My Street 16 July 2014 ==Transport== Transdev NSW operates bus route 993 to Engadine and Miranda. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Sutherland Shire ",
