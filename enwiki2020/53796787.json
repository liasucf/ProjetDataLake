    "text": "In algebra, the center of a ring R is the subring consisting of the elements x such that xy = yx for all elements y in R. It is a commutative ring and is denoted as Z(R); \"Z\" stands for the German word Zentrum, meaning \"center\". If R is a ring, then R is an associative algebra over its center. Conversely, if R is an associative algebra over a commutative subring S, then S is a subring of the center of R, and if S happens to be the center of R, then the algebra R is called a central algebra. ==Examples== *The center of a commutative ring R is R itself. *The center of a skew-field is a field. *The center of the (full) matrix ring with entries in a commutative ring R consists of R-scalar multiples of the identity matrix. *Let F be a field extension of a field k, and R an algebra over k. Then Z(R \\otimes_k F) = Z(R) \\otimes_k F. *The center of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra plays an important role in the representation theory of Lie algebras. For example, a Casimir element is an element of such a center that is used to analyze Lie algebra representations. See also: Harish-Chandra isomorphism. *The center of a simple algebra is a field. ==See also== *Center of a group *Central simple algebra *Morita equivalence ==Notes== ==References== *Bourbaki, Algebra. * Richard S.
