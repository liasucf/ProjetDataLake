    "text": "Transspray is an extended play by German electronic artist Alva Noto. It was released in 2005 via Raster Noton label. ==Background== This is the third and final part of the transall tryptich that, according to the artist, respectively deals with one of three interrelated themes: the increased speed of information flow, utopias, and the fragmentation of ideas. ==Reception== A reviewer of Boomkat wrote \"**Part 3 of 3** This release is presented in three CDs: Transrapid, Transvision and finally, Transspray. Across the 3 installments special emphasis is put on the rhythmic aspects of minimalism, utilising Carsten Nicolai's maverick minimal intricacies in brilliant white surroundings. There's a crisp clarity to Nicolai's construction's that's very hard to dissect - you know that you shouldn't be able to relate to this music's sparse trajectory emotionally, and yet, in between moments of microscopic dissection and malfunctioning arrangements - the material works on an incredibly moving level. Carsten Nicolai has been working on this material for over two years, these three releases also adhering to Raster Noton's strict aesthetic emphasis - housed in absolutely sublime booklet-sized die-cut packaging that visually reflects the contents to be found within. Incredible music\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Carsten Nicolai \u2013 sounds *Marco Peljhan \u2013 liner notes *Nibo, R-N Modul Berlin \u2013 design ==References== ==External links== *Alva Noto official website Category:2005 albums Category:Alva Noto albums Category:Raster-Noton albums ",
