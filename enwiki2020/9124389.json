    "text": "The black-capped chickadee is the state bird of Massachusetts. This list of birds of Massachusetts includes species documented in the U.S. state of Massachusetts and accepted by the Massachusetts Avian Records Committee (MARC). As of September 2019, there are 504 species included in the official list. Of them, 179 are on the review list (see below), six have been introduced to North America, three are extinct, and one has been extirpated. An additional eight species are on a supplemental list of birds whose origin is uncertain. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check- list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in Massachusetts as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following codes are used to denote categories of species: *(n) Nesting - confirmed nesting records within Massachusetts *(xn) Extralimital nester - record of nesting, but recorded only once or twice *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to North America by the actions of humans, either directly or indirectly *(E) Extinct - a recent species that no longer exists *(Ex) Extirpated - a species no longer found in Massachusetts but existing elsewhere *(R) Review list - birds that if seen require more comprehensive documentation than regularly seen species. These birds are considered irregular or rare in Massachusetts. Note: Birds marked with (*) are not identified to species, but are distinct enough to be considered as a separate entry. ==Ducks, geese, and waterfowl== Canada goose at Spy Pond in Arlington American black duck Common eider Long-tailed duck Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. Forty-eight species have been recorded in Massachusetts. *Black- bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis (R) *Fulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor (R) *Snow goose, Anser caerulescens *Ross's goose, Anser rossii (R) *Greater white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons *Pink-footed goose, Anser brachyrhynchus (R) *Brant, Branta bernicla *Barnacle goose, Branta leucopsis (R) *Cackling goose, Branta hutchinsii *Canada goose, Branta canadensis (n) *Mute swan, Cygnus olor (I) (n) *Trumpeter swan, Cygnus buccinator (R) *Tundra swan, Cygnus columbianus *Wood duck, Aix sponsa (n) *Garganey, Spatula querquedula (R) *Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors (n) *Cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera (R) *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata (n) *Gadwall, Mareca strepera (n) *Eurasian wigeon, Mareca penelope *American wigeon, Mareca americana (n) *Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos (n) *American black duck, Anas rubripes (n) *Northern pintail, Anas acuta (n) *Green-winged teal, Anas crecca (n) *Canvasback, Aythya valisineria *Redhead, Aythya americana *Ring-necked duck, Aythya collaris (n) *Tufted duck, Aythya fuligula (R) *Greater scaup, Aythya marila *Lesser scaup, Aythya affinis *Steller's eider, Polysticta stelleri (R) *King eider, Somateria spectabilis *Common eider, Somateria mollissima (n) *Harlequin duck, Histrionicus histrionicus *Labrador duck, Camptorhynchus labradorius (E) (R) *Surf scoter, Melanitta perspicillata *White-winged scoter, Melanitta deglandi *Black scoter, Melanitta americana *Long-tailed duck, Clangula hyemalis *Bufflehead, Bucephala albeola *Common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula *Barrow's goldeneye, Bucephala islandica *Hooded merganser, Lophodytes cucullatus (n) *Common merganser, Mergus merganser (n) *Red-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator (n) *Masked duck, Nomonyx dominicus (R) *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis (n) ==New World quail== Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. One species has been recorded in Massachusetts. *Northern bobwhite, Colinus virginianus (n) ==Pheasants, grouse, and allies== Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae Phasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from the underside of the beak and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller than the male (the tom) and much less colorful. With wingspans of 1.5-1.8 meters (almost 6 feet), the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are game and are sometimes hunted for food. In all Massachusetts species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Five species have been recorded in Massachusetts. *Wild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo (n) *Ruffed grouse, Bonasa umbellus (n) *Willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus (R) *Greater prairie-chicken, Tympanuchus cupido (R) (ex) *Ring-necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus (I) (n) ==Grebes== Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds.

Three species have been recorded in Massachusetts. *Common nighthawk, Chordeiles minor (n) *Chuck-will's-widow, Antrostomus carolinensis *Eastern whip-poor-will, Antrostomus vociferus (n) ==Swifts== Order: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae The swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. Two species have been recorded in Massachusetts. *Chimney swift, Chaetura pelagica (n) *Apus species, Apus sp. (*) (R) ==Hummingbirds== Ruby-throated hummingbird Order: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. Six species have been recorded in Massachusetts. *Ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris (n) *Black- chinned hummingbird, Archilochus alexandri (R) *Calliope hummingbird, Selasphorus calliope (R) *Rufous hummingbird, Selasphorus rufus (R) *Allen's hummingbird, Selasphorus sasin (R) *Broad-billed hummingbird, Cynanthus latirostris (R) ==Rails, gallinules, and coots== Virginia rail Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe.
