His decades-long effort to breed domesticated silver foxes was described by The New York Times as \u201carguably the most extraordinary breeding experiment ever conducted.\u201d A 2010 article in Scientific American stated that Belyayev \u201cmay be the man most responsible for our understanding of the process by which wolves were domesticated into our canine companions.\u201d Beginning in the 1950s, in order to uncover the genetic basis of the distinctive behavioral and physiological attributes of domesticated animals, Belyayev and his team spent decades breeding the silver fox (Vulpes vulpes) and selecting for reproduction only those individuals in each generation that showed the least fear of humans. After several generations of controlled breeding, a majority of the silver foxes no longer showed any fear of humans and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. They also began to display spotted coats, floppy ears, curled tails, as well as other physical attributes often found in domesticated animals, thus confirming Belyayev\u2019s hypothesis that both the behavioral and physical traits of domesticated animals could be traced to \"a collection of genes that conferred a propensity to tameness\u2014a genotype that the foxes perhaps shared with any species that could be domesticated\". Belyayev\u2019s experiments were the result of a politically motivated demotion, in response to defying the now discredited non-Mendellian theories of Lysenkoism, which were politically accepted in the Soviet Union at the time. Belyayev has since been vindicated in recent years by major scientific journals, and by the Soviet establishment as a pioneering figure in modern genetics. ==Early life and education== Belyayev was born on 17 July 1917, in Protasovo, a town in the Russian province of Kostroma. He was his family's fourth and youngest son. His father, Konstantin Pavlovich, was a priest. His brother Nikolai, who was 18 years his senior, was a prominent geneticist who worked with Sergei Chetverikov (1880\u20131959), a pioneer of population genetics. \"It was his brother's influence that caused him to have this special interest in genetics\", Belyayev's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Lyudmila Trut, later said. Both Belyayev brothers were Darwinists and believers in Mendelian genetics. At the time Belyayev came of age, however, life was dangerous in the Soviet Union for geneticists with such views, because the Stalinist regime supported the scientific theories of agronomist Trofim Lysenko and outlawed research inspired by the rival views of Gregor Mendel. As Trut recalled, \"genetics was considered fake science.\" Indeed, under the rule of Stalin, leading geneticists who believed in Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics were considered enemies of the state. Several of them were sent to prison, and at least one, Nikolai Vavilov, was sentenced to death, and died of starvation in prison in 1943. ==Early career== The next year, Belyayev graduated from the Ivanovo Agricultural Institute and began working in the Department of Fur Animal Breeding at the Central Research Laboratory in Moscow, which was affiliated with the Ministry of Foreign Trade. In 1941, he was conscripted into the military, and was wounded and received several military decorations. He then resumed work at the laboratory. Despite the persecution of adherents of Darwinism and Mendelian genetics, Belyayev wrote a dissertation on \"The variation and inheritance of silver-colored fur in silver-black foxes\" and continued to hold fast to his belief in evolution and Mendelian genetics. Still, to be safe, he disguised his genetics research as studies in animal physiology. Nonetheless, his known interest in genetics led in 1948 to his dismissal from his position as head of the Department of Fur Animal Breeding. After the death of Stalin in 1953, the Soviet persecution of geneticists began to ease. From 1958 to the end of his life, Belyayev worked for the Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences, which he helped found. In 1963, he became Director of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics (IC&G;) in Novosibirsk, and held that position until his death. Under his leadership, according to one source, \"the institute became a center of basic and applied research in both classical genetics and modern molecular genetics.\" He was appointed an academician in 1973. ==Fox experiment== Domesticated silver fox The domesticated silver fox is a form of the silver fox which has been domesticated - to some extent - under laboratory conditions. The silver fox is a melanistic form of the wild red fox. Domesticated silver foxes are the result of an experiment which was designed to demonstrate the power of selective breeding to transform species, as described by Charles Darwin in On the Origin of Species. The experiment explored whether selection for behaviour rather than morphology may have been the process that had produced dogs from wolves, by recording the changes in foxes when in each generation only the most tame foxes were allowed to breed. Many of the descendant foxes became both tamer and more dog-like in morphology, including displaying mottled or spotted coloured fur. ==Death== Belyayev died of cancer in 1985. After his death, his experiment was continued by his assistant Lyudmila Trut, who brought international attention to it with a 1999 journal article. In 2017, the sculpture \"Dmitriy Belyaev and Domesticated Fox\" was built near Institute of Cytology and Genetics (Novosibisrk) in the honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Dmitry Konstantinovich Belyaev. The tamed fox gives the scientist a paw and wags its tail. Konstantin Zinich, sculptor (Krasnoyarsk): \"The philosophy of touching a fox and a man is rapprochement, kindness, there is no aggression from the fox - it was wild, and he made it genetically domesticated.\"\u0412 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0441 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439 Its opening was held as part of the Belyaev Conference 2017.Belyaev Conference, Novosibirsk, August 7-10, 2017Evolutionary Biology at Belyaev Conference \u2013 2017 ==Selected writings== * Belyayev, D.
