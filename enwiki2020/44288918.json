    "text": "The Living Bridge () is a pedestrian bridge across the River Shannon linking the University of Limerick\u2019s premises in County Limerick and County Clare. The bridge was designed by Wilkinson Eyre Architects to provide social and cultural space to encourage pedestrians to rest a while as they cross along the gently curved structure. At this point on the Shannon it is wide and shallow with many wooded islands which provide varied views and support for the piers. The deck is supported by two underslung catenary cables. Financed through a Public-private partnership, construction was undertaken by Eiffel Constructions Metalliques and completed in November 2007 at a cost of \u20ac12 million. At 350 metres it is the longest pedestrian bridge in Ireland. ==Awards and commendations== RIBA European Awards and Institution of Structural Engineers winner structural awards 2008 (Pedestrian Bridges). French Steel Construction Syndicate declared it as the most beautiful steel work (Bridges Category) in 2008. ==References== Category:Pedestrian bridges in the Republic of Ireland Category:Bridges in the Republic of Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in Limerick (city) Category:Buildings and structures in County Limerick Category:Buildings and structures in County Clare Category:Bridges completed in 2007 Category:River Shannon Category:University of Limerick ",
