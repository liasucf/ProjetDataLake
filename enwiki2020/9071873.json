    "text": "Saint-Thib\u00e9ry (Sant Tib\u00e8ri in Occitan) is a commune in the H\u00e9rault d\u00e9partement in the Occitanie region in southern France. The village of Saint-Thib\u00e9ry is built at the confluence of the Rivers Thongue and H\u00e9rault. The old Roman road \"Via Domitia\" runs through the village (Grand Rue) and some of the houses date back to the 15th century. Saint-Thib\u00e9ry is situated between the larger towns of Agde and P\u00e9zenas and the cities B\u00e9ziers and Montpellier and is a short distance to Mediterranean Sea. Over 4000 years old, this former Celtic village was once called \"Cessero\". ==Saint-Thib\u00e9ry Abbey and Church== The Benedictine Abbey (l\u2019abbaye b\u00e9n\u00e9dictine) and Church sit in the heart of the village. It was founded in the late 8th century by Atilio, a disciple of Benedict Aniane, near the tomb of three local martyrs. The Abbey Church has an unusual underground altar. During the 15th century, the church was rebuilt on its original Romanesque bases, in a Gothic style. The bell-tower was erected in 1509 and had eight bells. In the past the Church attracted many pilgrims who believed that relics kept there had special healing powers. Saint-Thib\u00e9ry is also on one of the old Santiago de Compostela Pilgrimage routes. ==Saint- Thib\u00e9ry mill== This corn (wheat) mill (moulin \u00e0 bled) was built in the 13th century and is one of the best preserved mills in the region. It has four wheels powered by water from the H\u00e9rault. A Romanesque tower was used to store the grain. The mill once belonged to the Benedictine abbots and is situated beside the so-called Roman bridge. ==Volcano== Mount Ramus, an extinct volcano, offers some magnificent views of the Languedoc, the Pyrenees mountains and the Mediterranean Sea with Spain off in the distance. In the village of Saint-Thib\u00e9ry there are some interesting volcanic features such as the basalt \u201corgan\u201d columns. There is an ancient fort on the volcano, dating from the 5th century BC. It overlooks the village and the H\u00e9rault valley. ==Saint-Thib\u00e9ry rivers== Saint-Thib\u00e9ry is situated where the River Thongue joins the H\u00e9rault. (The H\u00e9rault department is named after the latter.) The Thongue is the smaller river and flows down from the Languedoc mountains. The H\u00e9rault is 148 kilometres (92 mi) and flows from the C\u00e9vennes mountains. It reaches the Mediterranean Sea at Grau d'Agde. ==Population== File:St-Thibery (vue generale2).JPG|General view File:St-Thibery Mairie.JPG|Mairie File:St- Thibery-maison.JPG|House File:St-Thibery-moulin4.JPG|Mill File:Saint-Thib\u00e9ry mill race.JPG|Mill race File:St-Thibery orgues basaltiques1.JPG|Basalt organ File:St-Thibery-Ste-Marie.JPG|Church of Ste Marie File:St-Thibery eglise Ste Marie1.JPG|Church of Ste Marie File:St-Thibery-Tour.JPG|Tower File:Christian cross near Saint-Thib\u00e9ry cf01.jpg|A Christian cross in border of a road ==See also== * Roman Bridge * Via Domitia * Communes of the H\u00e9rault department ==References== *INSEE *Saint-Thib\u00e9ry Guide Category:Communes of H\u00e9rault ",
