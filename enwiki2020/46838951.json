    "text": "Paula S. Kassell (1917 \u2013 August 20, 2012) was an American feminist leader who founded New Directions for Women, which was the first national feminist news publication in the United States, was an early board member and officer of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press and successfully pushed The New York Times to use the term \"Ms.\" in reference to women.Townsend, Cara. \"Paula Kassell, feminist pioneer and Dover resident, dies at 94\" , Daily Record (Morristown), September 1, 2012. Accessed May 29, 2015. \"Kassell was a long- time women's rights activist who in 1972 founded the news tabloid, New Directions for Women, and later convinced the New York Times to use Ms. in addition to Miss and Mrs. on the paper's pages.\" ==Early life == Kassell grew up in Yonkers, New York. Her father was a stockbroker and her mother was a housewife. Kassell graduated from Barnard College in 1939. Kassell was inspired to become a feminist after reading anthropological works of Margaret Mead while at Barnard.Cook, Joan. \"Voice for Women\", The New York Times, November 6, 1977. Accessed May 29, 2015. She started working for Bell Labs in 1955, where she was the first woman employed as a technical editor.Staff. \"Paula S. Kassell, 94, of Dover\", Parsippany Life, September 19, 2012. Accessed May 29, 2015. == Career == In 1971, she became one of the co-founders of New Directions for Women and used money raised by its inaugural May 1971 conference to create a magazine that she edited out of her home together with other volunteers. The newspaper, which started with a press run of 2,000 copies reproduced by mimeograph and had grown to printing 50,000 copies that were sent to 15 states and to readers in Canada by March 1973, was cited as \"the country's first statewide feminist newspaper\".Cook, Joan. \"Feminist Paper for Women Is a Success; A 12-Page Tabloid\", The New York Times, March 25, 1973. Accessed May 29, 2015. \"A quarterly newspaper staffed entirely by women volunteers is helping to raise the consciousness levels of both sexes. Called New Directions for Women in New Jersey, it is said to be the country's first statewide feminist newspaper.\" Nationwide distribution of the newspaper began in 1975 and by 1977 the paper had relocated to offices in Westwood, New Jersey. Kassell bought shares of The New York Times and attended the company's April 1986 shareholder meeting, where she spoke about the inconsistent use of the titles \"Miss\" and \"Mrs.\" used to refer to women and the fact that this usage created confusion and inaccuracies about the marital status of those women mentioned in the paper. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the publisher of the paper, agreed to look into the issue and make a \"rational decision\" on the topic after discussion with usage experts.Wade, Betsy. \"Explaining the Origins of Ms.\", The New York Times, November 5, 2009. Accessed May 29, 2015. \"The minutes of the Times stockholders meeting of April 30, 1986, show that the publisher at the time, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, recognized Paula Kassell, a stockholder and feminist publisher who had long been on this case. Kassell challenged the publisher to convene a debate with language experts to reach a 'rational decision' on the question.\" Sulzberger agreed with her argument and the paper started using the term Ms. as stated in an editor's note published on June 20, 1986, citing the fact that the term had \"become a part of the language\" in its decision to change its policy.\"Editors' note\", The New York Times, June 20, 1986. Accessed May 29, 2015. \"Beginning today, The New York Times will use Ms. as an honorific in its news and editorial columns.\" She remained involved with the Morris County, New Jersey chapter of the National Organization for Women until her death. == Personal life == A resident of Dover, New Jersey, Kassell died in her home at the age of 94 on August 20, 2012. Her husband, Gerson G. Friedman, died before her, as did a daughter who died of breast cancer. She was survived by a son and two grandchildren. ==References== Category:1917 births Category:2012 deaths Category:American feminists Category:Barnard College alumni Category:People from Dover, New Jersey Category:People from Yonkers, New York Category:20th-century American newspaper founders ",
