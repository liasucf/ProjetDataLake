Elphinstone, George Robertson, Richard Strand). ==History== Until the late 19th century, the Kom were a sub-group of the Siah-Posh Kafirs (\"black-robed unbelievers\") and their political (factional) headquarters was at Kombrom. They gave allegiance to the Mehtar (crown prince) of Chitral. At that time, following their conquest by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan, the Kom converted to Islam. Kafiristan (\"Land of Unbelievers\") was renamed Nuristan (\"Land of Light\") and its inhabitants became collectively known as Nuristanis (sometimes loosely translated as \"enlightened ones\"). By the end of the 19th century, the Kom were concentrated in the lower part of the Bashgul Valley and came to control it.George Scott Robertson Hence the valley became also known as Kam,George Scott Robertson, Kamdesh in the Khowar language, and as Kamoz in Pashto. The country of the Kom is also known as Komstan. While they have never regarded as numerous, the Kom have been respected for their military prowess by neighboring peoples, including the Chitralis and Pashtuns. ==See also== * Nurestan * Nuristani people * Nuristani languages * Katir * Kamviri * Kambojas ==References== * George Scott Robertson (1896), The Kafirs of Hindukush * Mountstuart Elphinstone (1815), An Account of the Kingdom of Caubol, London * J.
