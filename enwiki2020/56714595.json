    "text": "The 1955 European Rowing Championships for men were rowing championships held in the Belgian city of Ghent. The venue was the Watersportbaan, which was built for these championships and was part of Belgium's preparation for their bid to host the 1960 Summer Olympics. The competition for women had been held earlier in the month in Bucharest. The event in Ghent was held from 25 to 28 August and they competed in all seven Olympic boat classes (M1x, M2x, M2-, M2+, M4-, M4+, M8+). Some 400 competitors form 21 countries competed. ==German participation== The National Olympic Committee of the GDR was granted provisional membership in 1955 and as a next step, East Germany tried to gain membership of the individual sporting organisations that participated in Olympic disciplines. In July 1955, the East German rowing association applied for a license from FISA, the International Rowing Federation, to be able to nominate their rowers at the European Championships in Bucharest (women) and Ghent (men). FISA's response was that the next congress, to be held just prior to the championships in Ghent, will decide on the matter. Therefore, East German teams could not compete in 1955. At the congress, East Germany was unanimously accepted as a new member. West Germany was represented in Ghent in six boat classes. ==Medal summary \u2013 men's events== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Event ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:gold;\"| Gold ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:silver;\"| Silver ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#c96;\"| Bronze |- | style=\"background:gold;\"| Country & rowers | style=\"background:gold;\"| Time | style=\"background:silver;\"| Country & rowers | style=\"background:silver;\"| Time | style=\"background:#c96;\"| Country & rowers | style=\"background:#c96;\"| Time |- | M1x | Teodor Kocerka | | Yuriy Tyukalov | | Rob van Mesdag | |- | M2x | Heorhiy Zhylin Ihor Yemchuk | | Albert Krajmer Franti\u0161ek Reich | | Perica Vla\u0161i\u0107 Nikola Lucsin | |- | M2- | Igor Buldakov Viktor Ivanov | | Michel Knuysen Bob Baetens | | Jorge Gluzzman Eduardo Gluzzman | |- | M2+ | Gottfried Kottmann Rolf Streuli Walter Ludin (cox) | | Veli Lehtel\u00e4 Toimi Pitk\u00e4nen Matti Niemi (cox) | | Claude Martin \u00c9douard Leguery Daniel Forget (cox) | |- | M4- | Tiberiu Macean Anton Sinceac Nicolae Radu \u0218tefan Pongratz | | Ib Jensen Bent Br\u00f6nnum Leif Hermansen Bj\u00f6rn Br\u00f6nnum | | Jorma Salonen Reino Poutanen Eero Lehtovirta Kauko H\u00e4nninen | |- | M4+ | Juan Ecker Emilio Czerner Jorge Schneider Alfredo Czerner Gerardo Santos (cox) | | Evert Gunnarsson Ivar Aronsson G\u00f6sta Eriksson Olle Larsson Bertil G\u00f6ransson (cox) | | Jorma Salonen Reino Poutanen Eero Lehtovirta Kauko H\u00e4nninen Rolf Tuominen (cox) | |- | M8+ | Yevgeny Brago Vladimir Rodimushkin Slava Amiragov Yevgeny Samsonov Igor Borisov Leonid Gissen Aleksey Komarov Vladimir Kryukov Vladimir Petrov (cox) | | Evert Gunnarsson Ivar Aronsson Rune Andersson Lennart Hansson Bo Gustavsson G\u00f6sta Eriksson Olle Larsson Bertil G\u00f6ransson (cox) | | Hans Betz G\u00fcnter Harms Roland Freihoff Heinz Z\u00fcnkler Hans Wielath Walter Gisske Herbert Gossel Hermann Semrau Friedel Iserloh (cox) | |} ==References== Category:European Rowing Championships European Rowing Championships Rowing Rowing Category:Rowing competitions in Belgium ",
