    "text": "Gymnopus biformis is a North American species of agaric fungus in the family Omphalotaceae. The species was originally described by Charles Horton Peck in 1903 as Marasmius biformis. The specific epithet biformis refers to the two distinct cap shapes, which Peck noted could be either campanulate (bell- shaped) or flattened. Roy Halling transferred the fungus to Gymnopus in 1997. ==See also== *List of Gymnopus species ==References== ==External links== * Category:Fungi described in 1903 Category:Fungi of North America Category:Marasmiaceae ",
