    "text": "The coat of arms of Adelaide was granted by the Herald's College on 20 April 1929. ==Blazon== ===Shield=== The arms consist of a blue shield with a gold cross, which is surmounted by a red cross. * The top left corner, or first quarter, shows a three-masted ship in full sail. The ship represents the importance of commerce to the City and is a reminder of the form of transport of the early settlers from Great Britain to South Australia, and of any return voyage, as well as being the mail link between the two countries. * The top right corner, or second quarter, shows a golden fleece, representing the sheep farming interest and the wool trade. * The lower left corner, or third quarter, shows a bull\u2019s head, representing the cattle interests. * The lower right corner, orfourth quarter, shows a golden wheatsheaf in full ear. It represents the extensive agricultural interests. ===Crest=== Above the shield is a golden mural crown, This supposedly derives from the crown or garland given to the soldier in Ancient Roman times who was the first to scale the wall of a besieged town. which is a common element in the arms of municipalities. Above the mural crown is the crest of the Corporation. It is a right arm holding a miner\u2019s pick, representing another of the industries of the early years which contributed so much to the wealth of South Australia and Adelaide. The arm is resting on a wreath of the colours of the city, namely blue and gold. ===Supporters=== On the right side of the shield there is a kangaroo, and on the left side a lion, which guard and uphold the shield. The lion represents the English origin of the settlers who established South Australia and the kangaroo represents the country they helped to build. The lion simultaneously represents Aion, the god of time, and the lion of dominion. The red kangaroo represents the Kaurna people's totem, the red kangaroo dreaming. ===Base=== The base of the shield stands on a grassy green field of rising ground. ===Motto=== A scroll below the arms has a Latin motto Ut Prosint Omnibus Conjuncti which translates as \"united for the common good\". ==See also== *Flag of Adelaide *Coat of arms of South Australia ==References== *City of Adelaide Coat of Arms Adelaide Category:Adelaide Adelaide Adelaide Adelaide Adelaide Adelaide ",
