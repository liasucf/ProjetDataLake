    "text": "Juan Carlos Acevedo (born May 5, 1970) is a Mexican former professional baseball player. He was a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1995 and 2003. He pitched in the Mexican League after his MLB retirement. ==Biography== Acevedo attended Dundee-Crown High School in Carpentersville, Illinois, where as a senior he had an 8\u20130 record in baseball. After high school, Acevedo attended Parkland College in Champaign, Illinois. He was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in 1992 as a 14th round amateur pick. Acevedo signed with them June 3, 1992 and debuted April 30, 1995. During his career, Acevedo served primarily as a relief pitcher, starting only 34 of his 366 games played. Known as a journeyman, Acevedo played for the Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers, Florida Marlins, Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, and Toronto Blue Jays during an eight- year career. He was a part-time closer for the Cardinals in 1998, taking over in the second half of the season for struggling veteran Jeff Brantley. He finished his MLB career with a 4.33 ERA and a 28\u201340 win\u2013loss record. His 28 saves in a season for Detroit in 2002 is a record for a Mexican-born pitcher. He retired after the 2003 season. Rob Neyer and Bill James credit Acevedo as having thrown a mid-90s four seam fastball and a cut fastball. In early 2002, Acevedo married Sonja Ptach. They have three children together. Soon after their marriage, Acevedo retired as an MLB player and began pitching for Monterrey of the Mexican League. Ptach filed for divorce in 2005 for irreconcilable difference and mental cruelty. The divorce was settled with Acevedo being ordered to pay off their former home. Throughout his MLB career Acevedo made upwards of $4.5 million, but a failed restaurant investment, credit card and cell phone debt, along with money owed to the Illinois Department of Revenue caused Acevedo to not pay off his mortgage as ordered. In March 2010, Acevedo was sentenced to six months in jail for contempt of court. The charge was related to a violation of the financial terms of his divorce settlement. ==See also== * Best pitching seasons by a Detroit Tiger ==References== ==External links== Category:1970 births Category:Baseball players from Chihuahua Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from Mexico Category:Mexican expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Mexican expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Living people Category:Colorado Rockies players Category:New York Mets players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:Florida Marlins players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:People from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Category:Sportspeople from Chihuahua (state) Category:Visalia Oaks players Category:Bend Rockies players Category:Central Valley Rockies players Category:New Haven Ravens players Category:Colorado Springs Sky Sox players Category:Norfolk Tides players Category:Memphis Redbirds players Category:Mexican League baseball pitchers Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Nashville Sounds players Category:Sultanes de Monterrey players Category:Dorados de Chihuahua players Category:Rojos del \u00c1guila de Veracruz players Category:Rieleros de Aguascalientes players Category:Parkland Cobras baseball players ",
