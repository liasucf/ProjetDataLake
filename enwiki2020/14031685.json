After receiving his doctoral degree, he went to England to study at the University College London, where he investigated the metabolism of the heart. On his return from England, he joined the prestigious team at the Institute of Physiology, with Luis Federico Leloir, Juan Fasciolo, Juan Mu\u00f1oz, and Alberto Taquini to work for a few years on the mechanism of nephrogenic hypertension. He made the most important discovery in his career during this research, that of angiotensin, in 1939. Hypertension (vol. 32, 1998). In Memoriam: Professor Alberto C. Taquini.

Braun-Men\u00e9ndez also helped to create the important scientific journal Ciencia y Investigaci\u00f3n which published its first issue in 1945. It was directed by him until 1959, the year that he died. Another of his initiatives included the Acta Physiologica Latinoamericana, a publication written in multiple languages for the publication of the work of Latin American physiologists. Dr. Braun- Men\u00e9ndez died in a plane crash near Mar del Plata with his daughter on January 16, 1959. The accident was Austral Air Lines' first. ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1959 deaths Category:People from Punta Arenas Category:Argentine people of Latvian-Jewish descent Category:Argentine people of Spanish descent Category:Chilean emigrants to Argentina Category:Naturalized citizens of Argentina Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni Category:University of Buenos Aires faculty Category:Argentine physiologists Category:Argentine scientists Category:Argentine cardiologists ",
