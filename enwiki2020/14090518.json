The Hokkien name implies that Ong Sum Ping was a native of Fujian, China. ==Career and personal life== According to Wen Xiongfei \u6e29\u96c4\u98de in the \u300a\u5357\u6d0b\u534e\u4fa8\u53f2\u300b, Ong Sum Ping came to Brunei in 1375 during the early years of China's Ming dynasty.Muhammad Jamil Al-Sufri (1990). Tarsilah Brunei- Sejarah Awal dan Perkembangan Islam. Bandar Seri Begawan: Jabatan Pusat Sejarah The Brunei History Centre presents a rather incredible story in which Ong Sum Ping later married Princess Ratna Dewi, the daughter of Sultan Muhammad Shah of Brunei. For that he was conferred the nobility title of Pengiran Maharaja Lela and elected Chief of Kinabatangan.Pusat Sejarah Brunei http://www.pusat- sejarah.gov.bn/sultanbrunei.htm Muhammad Jamil Al-Sufri.(1990). Tarsilah Brunei- Sejarah Awal dan Perkembangan Islam. Bandar Seri Begawan: Jabatan Pusat Sejarah Local Brunei Malay folklore suggest that there was a Chinese settlement in present-day Kinabatangan, Sabah. Linguistic evidence does not support the view held commonly by the Brunei History Centre that \"Kinabatangan\" could mean \"Chinese river\". According to early accounts which survive only in copies dating back to the 19th century such as Salasilah Raja- Raja Brunei (Genealogy of the Brunei Kings) which was possibly first compiled during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Hassan (1582\u20131598) and subsequently copied and updated from time to time and also the Sejarah Melayu (written by Tun Seri Lanang in 1612), Ong Sum Ping \"succeeded his father-in-law. He was known as Sultan Ahmad and ruled Brunei\". This version, however, contradicts later account engraved on the Batu Tarsilah (Genealogical Tablet of the Sultans of Brunei) founded in 1807 that Sultan Ahmad was a brother of Sultan Muhammad Shah and he was not Ong Sum Ping. The latter version is the accepted official history of Brunei.Muhammad Jamil Al-Sufri.(1990).Tarsilah Brunei- Sejarah Awal dan Perkembangan Islam. Bandar Seri Begawan: Jabatan Pusat Sejarah During the Brunei Civil War (1661-1673), Sultan Muhyiddin of Brunei called for the assistance of Sultan of Sulu to help defeat Sultan Abdul Hakkul Mubin promising them independence as well as the territory of present-day (north- eastern) Sabah to be given to the Sultan of Sulu.Rozan Yunos (2008).Civil war wrecks chaos in the country The promised territory was or included Kinabatangan. In the early 20th century, a Chinese trader, Huang Zhuoru \u9ec4\u5353\u5982 claimed that he visited the tomb of Ong Sum Ping located on a hill 1 li (about half km) from the Brunei capital at that time and there were Chinese inscriptions \u9ec4\u603b\u5175\u4e4b\u5893 on the tombstone which meant 'Tomb of Commander Huang'.\u300a\u9a6c\u661f\u534e\u4eba\u5fd7\u300bhttp://www.intimes.com.my/yeo-html/yeo591a.htm In another version of this story a Chinese trader from Guangzhou, Huang Qhuo Qi, allegedly discovered the tomb of Ong Sum Ping by accident in 1942, during a business trip to Brunei. . However, the present whereabouts of this tomb is unknown and remains a mystery. In 1947, a reef in the South China Sea for a short while was named 'Senping reef' \u68ee\u5c4f\u7901 by the Government of the Republic of China in honour of Ong Sum Ping. In the Brunei capital of Bandar Seri Begawan, there is a street named after him, Jalan Ong Sum Ping, which is the only street in Brunei with a Chinese name. ==In popular culture== Ong Sum Ping has been repeatedly cited as one of the main subjects in the legend of Mount Kinabalu. The legend tells of two Chinese delegates of the Ming \u2014 Ong Sum Ping and his well-built assistant Wang Kong \u2014 sent to capture a precious gemstone from the mountain which was being guarded by a dragon. Using his wits, Ong Sum Ping swapped the pearl for a lit glass bottle. Wanting to get all the credit, Wang Kong snatched the retrieved treasure and ran away. Bitterly appalled by his trusted assistant's behaviour, Ong Sum Ping chose to stay behind in Brunei. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Ming dynasty people Category:Bruneian royalty Category:Bruneian people of Chinese descent Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
