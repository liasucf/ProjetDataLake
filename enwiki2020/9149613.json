In 1945, together with Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Szalai helped save hundreds of Hungarian Jews in the Budapest ghetto. In 2009, he was honored by Israel as Righteous among the Nations.

This friendship continued in the critical months 1944 - 1945 while P\u00e1l Szalai, high-ranking member of the police force supported Raoul Wallenberg. Szalai was from 1939 to 1942 an idealistic member of the Arrow Cross Party. He left the party in 1942 disillusioned, and returned to a high-ranking police force position in October 1944 to help people in mortal danger from the Holocaust. Szalai's friend K\u00e1roly Szab\u00f3 was an employee of the Swedish Embassy. Dr. Otto Fleischmann Doctor of Medicine and psychologist of the Swedish Embassy motivated K\u00e1roly Szab\u00f3 to play active role in the rescue actions of Raoul Wallenberg. P\u00e1l Szalai supported his friend with important personal documents, signed from the German command in the Battle of Budapest.J\u00f3zsef Szekeres: Saving the Ghettos of Budapest in January 1945, P\u00e1l Szalai \"the Hungarian Schindler\" , Budapest 1997, Publisher: Budapest Archives, Page 41 Szalai agreed to meet Raoul Wallenberg at the Swedish Embassy in the night of December 26, 1944. ===The ghetto in Budapest=== Szalai provided Raoul Wallenberg with special favors and government information. In the second week of January 1945, Raoul found out that Adolf Eichmann planned a massacre in the Budapest ghetto. The only one who could stop it was the man given the responsibility to carry the massacre out, the commander of the German troops in Hungary, Major General Gerhard Schmidhuber. Through Szalai, Wallenberg sent Schmidhuber a note promising that he, Raoul Wallenberg, would make sure the general was held personally responsible for the massacre and that he would be hanged as a war criminal when the war was over. The general knew that the war would be over soon and that the Germans were losing. The massacre never took place.Incredible People: Wallenberg According to Giorgio Perlasca, who posed as the Spanish consul- general to Hungary in the winter of 1944 and saved 5218 Jews, P\u00e1l Szalai lied to save his life during his criminal trial, and the history of the saving is different.United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Oral history interview with Giorgio Perlasca, 5 September 1990Interview by Enrico Deaglio to Giorgio Perlasca, from: Mixer, Giorgio Perlasca, Giovanni Minoli, Rai, 1990VareseNews, Gli uomini giusti muoiono di sabato, 22 May 2010Interview by Enrico Deaglio to Giorgio Perlasca, from: Fondazione Giorgio Perslasca, Giorgio Perlasca - il mixer israeliano in ebraico, 1990 Raoul Wallenberg saved hundreds of people but was not directly involved in the plan to save the ghetto. While Perlasca was posing as the Spanish consul-general, he came to know about the intention to burn down the ghetto. Shocked and incredulous, he asked for a direct hearing with the Hungarian interior minister G\u00e1bor Vajna, in the basement of the Budapest City Hall where he had his headquarter, and threatened fictitious legal and economic measures against the \"3000 Hungarian citizens\" (in fact, a much smaller number) declared by Perlasca as residents of Spain, and the same treatment by two Latin American governments, to force the minister to withdraw the project. This actually happened in the following days. ===After the war=== After the war, Szalai was one of few high-ranking members of the Arrow Cross Party not executed. He was set free in recognition of his cooperation with Wallenberg. ===Show trial preparations 1953 in Hungary=== Preparations for a show trial started 1953 in Budapest to \"prove\" that Wallenberg had never been in the Soviet Union, nobody had dragged off Wallenberg in 1945, least of all the Soviet Army. Everything was ready for a trial designed to prove that Wallenberg had been the victim of cosmopolitan Zionists. Three leaders of the Jewish community of Budapest Dr. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Benedek, Lajos St\u00f6ckler, and Miksa Domonkos, as well as two additional \"eyewitnesses\" P\u00e1l Szalai and K\u00e1roly Szab\u00f3 were arrested and tortured. The preparations for the show trial were initiated in Moscow, as part of Joseph Stalin's increasing antisemitic and anti-Zionist campaign - e.g. Solomon Mikhoels murder, Night of the Murdered Poets (of the World War II time Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee), Slansky Trial, Doctors' Plot. After Stalin's death on March 5, 1953 and as Lavrentiy Beria was executed, the trial was aborted and the arrestees released in fall 1953. Due to severe torture Miksa Domonkos died shortly after being released and Lajos St\u00f6ckler became psychologically impaired.Book: M\u00e1ria Ember, They Wanted to Blame Us, 1992 ) ===Emigration and death=== He emigrated 1956 to the United States and lived in New Jersey then moved to California. He died on January 16, 1994 in Los Angeles, California under the name \"Paul Sterling\".Social Security Death Index; 141-32-9949 some biographies incorrectly list January 18, 1994 ==See also== *K\u00e1roly Szab\u00f3 *popular Hungarian actor K\u00e1lm\u00e1n R\u00f3zsahegyi ==References== ==Further reading== *A Man for All Connections, The Wallenberg- Szalai connection, Andrew Handler, Praeger/Greenwood, 30 January 1996; .
