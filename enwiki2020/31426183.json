    "text": "The Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide it is designed for pop recordings by duo/groups or collaborative performances (vocal or instrumental) and is limited to singles or tracks only. The award goes to the performing artists. The producer, vocal arranger, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate. It was one of several new categories for the annual Grammy Awards ceremony to start from 2012. It combines the previous categories for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards and to eliminate the distinctions between collaborations and duo or groups. ==Recipients== ===2010s=== 2012 winner Amy Winehouse received her first posthumous award along with Tony Bennett Three-time nominee and 2015 winner alt=A blonde woman wearing a black gown singing into a microphone. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=75% |- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\" ! width=\"10%\" | Year ! width=\"50%\" | Artist ! width=\"40%\" | Work |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2012 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Tony Bennett and Amy Winehouse | \"Body and Soul\" |- | The Black Keys | \"Dearest\" |- | Coldplay | \"Paradise\" |- | Foster the People | \"Pumped Up Kicks\" |- | Maroon 5 featuring Christina Aguilera | \"Moves Like Jagger\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2013 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Gotye featuring Kimbra | \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" |- | Florence and the Machine | \"Shake It Out\" |- | Fun featuring Janelle Mon\u00e1e | \"We Are Young\" |- | LMFAO | \"Sexy and I Know It\" |- | Maroon 5 featuring Wiz Khalifa | \"Payphone\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2014 2015 Nominees |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Daft Punk featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers | \"Get Lucky\" |- | Pink featuring Nate Ruess | \"Just Give Me a Reason\" |- | Rihanna featuring Mikky Ekko | \"Stay\" |- | Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams | \"Blurred Lines\" |- | Justin Timberlake featuring Jay-Z | \"Suit & Tie\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2015 2014 Nominees |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | A Great Big World and Christina Aguilera | \"Say Something\" |- | Iggy Azalea featuring Charli XCX | \"Fancy\" |- | Coldplay | \"A Sky Full of Stars\" |- | Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj | \"Bang Bang\" |- | Katy Perry featuring Juicy J | \"Dark Horse\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2016 2014 Nominees |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars | \"Uptown Funk\" |- | Florence and the Machine | \"Ship to Wreck\" |- | Wiz Khalifa featuring Charlie Puth | \"See You Again\" |- | Maroon 5 | \"Sugar\" |- | Taylor Swift featuring Kendrick Lamar | \"Bad Blood\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2017 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Twenty One Pilots | \"Stressed Out\" |- | The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey | \"Closer\" |- | Lukas Graham | \"7 Years\" |- | Rihanna featuring Drake | \"Work\" |- | Sia featuring Sean Paul | \"Cheap Thrills\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2018 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Portugal.
