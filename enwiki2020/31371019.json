It is part of the Kobuleti Municipality and is situated on the administrative boundary of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara with the rest of Georgia, specifically with the region of Guria. ==History== The Soviet collectivization campaign of the 1920s and 1930s made this otherwise non- notable village a part of a larger subtropical agricultural area.
