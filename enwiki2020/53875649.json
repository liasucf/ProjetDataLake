During 1948\u20131949 \u00d3 Gallchobhair briefly conducted the Radio \u00c9ireann Light Orchestra (today the RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra). In 1962, he succeeded Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada as conductor of the Abbey Theatre ensemble until it was dissolved after a few years. During this time, he is said to have lived on Pembroke Road. \u00d3 Gallchobhair was a composition teacher for students including John Kinsella. In old age he lived with his wife for parts of the year in Spain and Italy. He died in Alicante (Spain). ==Music== \u00d3 Gallchobhair was a prolific composer and arranger of Irish traditional music for a wide range of instrumentations. He played in a number of orchestras and chamber ensembles for which he frequently wrote or arranged music. Many of these were very popular during his lifetime and were frequently performed or broadcast. Between 1935 and 1942 he wrote eleven \"Dance Dramas\", ballets on folklore themes, with one of the latter commissioned by Joan Denise Moriarty. This included the 2,5 hour production Cath\u00e1ir Linn (1942). He also wrote five light operas, or operettas, on Irish (Gaelic) texts, between 1944 and 1963, including Nocturne sa chearn\u00f3g (1942), Tr\u00e1gadh na Taoide (1950), \u00cdoc-shl\u00e1inte an ghr\u00e1 (1954) and An mhaighdean mhara (1960). Later he gained some fame through Hollywood film scores, including John Ford's The Rising of the Moon.Axel Klein: Die Musik Irlands im 20. Jahrhundert (Hildesheim; Georg Olms Verlag, 1996, p. 446. \u00d3 Gallchobhair was a major representative of the conservative side in Irish twentieth-century art music. He consciously eschewed contemporary styles and techniques of composition and argued repeatedly that Irish art music should be based on traditional music.See, for example, \u00c9. \u00d3 Gallchbhair: \"Music \u2013 Atavism\", in: Ireland To-day vol. 1 (1936), no. 1, p. 56\u20138. With this position he stood in stark contrast to contemporary Irish composers such as Aloys Fleischmann, Frederick May, or Brian Boydell. ==References== Category:1906 births Category:1982 deaths Category:20th-century Irish people Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Alumni of the Royal Irish Academy of Music Category:Irish classical composers Category:Irish film score composers Category:Irish opera composers Category:Male opera composers Category:Musicians from Dublin (city) Category:People from Dundalk Category:Male film score composers Category:20th-century male musicians ",
