GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2015-07-02. ==Doping== Doping was widespread at the 2003 USA Championships. A year after the competition, hurdler Brenda Taylor revealed she was offered banned substance modafinil and claimed that she thought she was \"the only person that didn't take it\".Hurdler offered stimulant at U.S. meet. Associated Press (2004-08-12). Retrieved on 2010-06-30. This followed the revelation that several athletes had tested positive for that drug at the championships and received bans from the sport, including Kelli White, Chryste Gaines, Sandra Glover and Eric Thomas and John McEwen. The governing body USA Track & Field was criticised for not acting more quickly in reporting the failed tests. Despite the failed drug test, the American body failed to report this to the International Association of Athletics Federations until after she had won gold medals in both the 100 m and 200 m at the World Championships.US officials admit drug tests. BBC Sport (2003-12-31). Retrieved on 2010-06-30. Others to later have their national championship results be disqualified for doping were: Regina Jacobs, Damu Cherry, Melissa Price, Tim Montgomery, Calvin Harrison, Alvin Harrison and Kevin Toth. Many of these athlete bans were related to the BALCO scandal and the use of Tetrahydrogestrinone (THG). ==World Championships qualification== ===Automatic byes=== A total of five American athletes were eligible for automatic byes into the 2003 World Championships in Athletics as a result of their being the defending champions from the 2001 World Championships in Athletics. All the athletes used their byes.USA Team Roster. USATF (2003-08-13). Retrieved on 2015-07-02.Team USA for the World Championships in Paris . IAAF (2003-08-14). Retrieved on 2015-07-02. *Maurice Greene (athlete): men's 100 meters *John Godina: men's shot put *Allen Johnson: men's 110 m hurdles *Anjanette Kirkland: women's 100 m hurdles *Stacy Dragila: women's pole vault ===Non-top three selections=== Men's shot put fourth placer Christian Cantwell would have been given the fourth national team spot due to Godina's bye, but was omitted as Kevin Toth, whose performance was later disqualified for doping, was chosen instead. Sam Burley, sixth in the men's 800 m, was given the third national team place as the highest finisher with the \"A\" qualifying standard. Chris Phillips, fourth in the men's 110 m hurdles, was selected as a result of Allen Johnson's bye. Tora Harris was given the third men's high jump spot for his fifth-place finish as he was the only other athlete with the \"A\" standard. Low finishers in the men's discus were selected by merit of having the standard \u2013 Nick Petrucci had come fifth while Casey Malone was ninth nationally. None of the top three finishers in the women's 5000 m had the \"A\" qualifying standard so Lauren Fleshman, fourth in Palo Alto, was the United States' sole World Championships representative in the event. Women's discus third placer Seilala Sua did not reach the standard so fourth place Kris Kuehl was selected instead. ==References== Results *Full Results - Open. USATF. Retrieved on 2015-07-02.
