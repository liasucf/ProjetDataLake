    "text": "The Iran national football team (), also known as Team Melli (), represents Iran in international football and is controlled by the Iran Football Federation. From December 2014 until May 2018, the men's national football team of Iran remained the highest-ranked team in Asia, representing the longest continuous period of time a team has been top of the continent in the rankings. Iran is one of the most successful men's national teams in Asia with three Asian Cup championships (1968, 1972, and 1976). Iran's best performance at the Olympics was reaching the quarterfinals in the 1976 Montreal Games. Iran has qualified for the World Cup five times (1978, 1998, 2006, 2014, and 2018) but has never advanced past the group stage. They have, however, won two matches in the World Cup, one against the United States in 1998, and their opener against Morocco in 2018. ==History== ===Early years=== The very first Iran selection football team that traveled to Baku in 1926. The Iranian Football Federation was founded in 1920. In 1926 Tehran XI (selected players from Tehran Club, Toofan F.C. and Armenian Sports Club) traveled across the border to Baku, USSR, this was the first away football match for an Iranian team. This Tehran Select team is the predecessor of Iran's national football team and Azerbaijan national football team. The first match that Team Melli played was on 23 August 1941, away at Kabul in a 1\u20130 win against British India, while Iran's first FIFA international match was on 25 August 1941, away at Afghanistan. Iran won the Asian Cup three consecutive times (1968, 1972, 1976), to which the team has not been able to add since. Dunai and Ghelichkhani at the 1972 Summer Olympics ===1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina=== :Additional information: 1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC and OFC) :Additional information: 1978 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group 4 Iran's squad playing in '78 World Cup match against Scotland in Cordoba, Estadio Cordoba, Argentina on 7 June 1978 (16:45) In 1978, Iran made its first appearance in the World Cup after defeating Australia in Tehran. Iran lost two of three group stage matches against the Netherlands and Peru. Team Melli managed to surprise the footballing community by securing one point in its first ever World Cup appearance against Scotland which saw Iraj Danaeifard cancel out an own goal scored by Andranik Eskandarian for the 1\u20131 draw. ===After the Revolution=== After the 1979 Revolution, football was somewhat neglected and cast aside. During the 1980s, the Iranian national team did not feature in World Cup competitions due to the Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u201388) and domestic football suffered the inevitable effects of conflict. The national team withdrew from the Asian qualifiers for the 1982 World Cup, and refused to participate in the qualifiers for the 1986 World Cup because of having to play on neutral ground. The war and political upheavals left Iran without major club competitions until 1989 when the Qods League was established. A year later, the Qods League was renamed the Azadegan League. Despite failing to qualify for either the 1990 or the 1994 World Cups, it was during this period that a number of quality players burst onto the Iranian football scene, laying the foundation for third place in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup (memorable victories in that tournament included a 3\u20130 victory against Saudi Arabia and an impressive 6\u20132 victory against South Korea) and their second stab at World Cup glory in 1998. ===1998 FIFA World Cup in France=== :Additional information: 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC\u2013OFC play-off) :Additional information: 1998 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group F In November 1997, Iran qualified for the 1998 World Cup after eliminating Australia in a close playoff series. Both games finished undecided, but Iran managed to qualify due to the away goals rule. Iran held Australia to a 1\u20131 draw at home, and a 2\u20132 draw in Melbourne; however, since Iran had scored more away goals, they were able to qualify for the Cup. At their first game of the Group F at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Iran played well against Yugoslavia, losing narrowly 1\u20130, only to a free kick goal by Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107. Iran recorded their first World Cup victory in the second game, beating the United States 2\u20131, with Hamid Estili and Mehdi Mahdavikia scoring goals for Iran. The Iran vs USA World Cup match was preheated with much excitement because of each country's political stance after the Iranian revolution and the Iran hostage crisis. However, in an act of defiance against all forms of hatred or politics in sports, both sides presented one another with gifts and flowers and took ceremonial pictures before the match kickoff. Following defeat against Iran, the United States was eliminated from the World Cup. Iran played against Germany in the third game. The game was lost 2\u20130. The goals were scored by Oliver Bierhoff and J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann. The one win and two losses meant Iran came third in the final group standing and failed to make it to the next round. (Farhad Majidi and Mehdi Fonounizadeh were important absentees in the tournament.) ===2000 AFC Asian Cup=== Iran finished first in the group stage of the tournament, but lost to South Korea in the quarter-finals. ===2002 FIFA World Cup qualification=== :Additional information: 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC) Iran failed to qualify for World Cup 2002 after an aggregate defeat to the Republic of Ireland, losing 2\u20130 in Dublin and winning 1\u20130 in Tehran.

Iran finished second in this group. In quarter-final clash against South Korea, Iran won 4\u20133 in normal time. In the semi-final, Iran lost to the host, China on penalty kicks.

The qualification round both in 2001 and 2004\u201305 resulted in mass celebrations, hysteria and rioting, causing internal chaos and unrest between youth and government officials. The Iran versus Japan leg of the 2006 World Cup qualifiers in Tehran, played on 24 March 2005, was the highest attended qualifying match among all confederations. The match ended in tragedy with 5 fans killed and several others injured as they left the Azadi Stadium at the end of the match. Iran started their 2006 FIFA World Cup appearance with high expectations from fans and media. Their first match was against Mexico in Group D. The game was level 1\u20131 at the half-time, but Iran lost at the end because of a defensive mistake. The final score, 3\u20131, was brought about by goals from Omar Bravo and Sinha for Mexico, with Yahya Golmohammadi scoring the only Iran goal. Iran played against Portugal in the second game. The game was lost 2\u20130. The goals were scored by Deco and Cristiano Ronaldo (penalty). The two losses meant Iran was eliminated from the competition, before their third and final game against Angola. Iran drew 1\u20131 with Angola on 21 June 2006, Sohrab Bakhtiarizadeh scoring the Iran goal. ===Temporary suspension=== Iran's squad in August 2006 against Syria, Manager: Amir Ghalenoei Standing left to right: Nekounam, Enayati, Nikbakht, Shakouri, Fekri, Sadeghi Sitting left to right: Taleblou, Madanchi, Khatibi, Teymourian, Mahdavikia In November 2006, Iran was suspended by FIFA from all participation in international football, on the grounds of governmental interference in the national football association. The ban lasted less than a month, and as a dispensation was given to allow the Iran under-23 team to participate in the football competition of the 2006 Asian Games, fixtures were unaffected. ===2007 AFC Asian Cup=== :Additional information: 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group C IRIFF appointed Amir Ghalenoei as head coach of the Iran national football team on 17 July 2006 to succeed Branko Ivankovi\u0107. After finishing first in the qualifying round 2 points ahead of South Korea and then finishing first in the group stage of the final tournament in Malaysia, Iran lost to South Korea in a penalty shoot-out of the quarterfinal match and was eliminated from the 2007 Asian Cup. Ghalenoei was heavily criticized by the press. After a period of discussion in the Iranian football federation, his contract was not renewed and Team Melli was left with a caretaker manager for several months. ===2010 FIFA World Cup qualification=== :Additional information: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC) Ali Daei was chosen to become the new coach after Spanish coach Javier Clemente had been close to signing on as Iran's national team manager but talks collapsed when he refused to live full-time in the country. Iran was in the same FIFA World Cup qualifying group as Kuwait, Syria and United Arab Emirates in the third round. They played home and away against each of the other three teams in group 5. In the middle of the fourth round, Ali Daei was let go from his position as the Iranian national coach on 29 March 2009. He was replaced by Afshin Ghotbi. Iran failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup after ranking 4th overall in its group. ===2011 AFC Asian Cup=== :Additional information: 2011 AFC Asian Cup Group D Iran's squad in July 2011 against Maldives, Manager: Carlos Queiroz Standing left to right: Aghili, Hosseini, Haddadifar, Ansarifard, Zare, Pooladi Sitting left to right: Heydari, Norouzi, Rahmati, Khalatbari, Karimi Iran renewed the contract with Afshin Ghotbi until the end of 2011 AFC Asian Cup and the team qualified to the tournament with 13 points as the group winners. During the final qualification match against South Korea, several Iranian players started the match wearing green armbands or wristbands, a symbol of protest at the outcome of the Iranian presidential election. Most removed them at half-time. The newspaper Iran reported that Ali Karimi, Mehdi Mahdavikia, Hosein Kaebi, and Vahid Hashemian had received life bans from the Iranian FA for the gesture. However, the Iranian FA denied this claim in a response to FIFA's inquiry saying that \"the comments in foreign media are nothing but lies and a mischievous act.\" Head coach Afshin Ghotbi also confirmed that it was a rumour and Iranian FA \"has not taken any official stand on this issue.\" Afshin Ghotbi was able to qualify for 2011 Asian Cup and finished second in West Asian Football Federation Championship 2010 just a few months before the 2011 Asian Cup. Iran was able to gain all nine points in the group stage of the 2011 Asian Cup but after an extra time goal from South Korea, Iran was yet again unable to get to the semifinals of the competition. ===2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil=== ====Qualification==== On 4 April 2011, former Real Madrid manager Carlos Queiroz agreed to a two-and-a-half-year deal to coach the Iranian national team until the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Under Queiroz, Iran began their World Cup qualification campaign successfully, defeating the Maldives 4\u20130 in the first leg of their second round of qualifiers. After winning 5\u20130 on aggregate, Iran advanced to the third round of qualifiers, where they were drawn with Indonesia, Qatar and Bahrain. Iran highlighted their position at the top of their group by defeating Bahrain 6\u20130 at home in the Azadi Stadium, as well as inviting former German youth international, Ashkan Dejagah, who scored twice on his debut against Qatar. After a 4\u20131 win at Indonesia, Iran qualified for the final round of direct qualifiers, the fourth round. In the fourth round, Iran was drawn with South Korea, Qatar, Uzbekistan, and Lebanon in their group. Queiroz made new foreign-based additions to his squad, adding players such as Reza Ghoochannejhad to his team. Iran started their fourth round of Asian qualifiers with a 1\u20130 win in Uzbekistan. Team Melli then drew Qatar and lost in Lebanon before defeating South Korea at the Azadi on 16 October with a goal from captain Javad Nekounam. After a 1\u20130 loss in Tehran against Uzbekistan, Iran defeated Qatar 1\u20130 in Doha and Lebanon 4\u20130 at home. In their last qualification match, Iran defeated South Korea 1\u20130 in Ulsan Munsu with a goal from Ghoochannejhad, resulting in their qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup as group winners with 16 points. Thus, Iran became the third team that Queiroz has managed to qualify for the World Cup, having reached the 2002 edition with South Africa and the 2010 edition with Portugal, leading the latter to a knockout stage finish. Iran continued their winning streak, securing qualification to the 2015 Asian Cup months later as well. ====Foreign-based call-ups==== Since Queiroz's role as manager of the Iranian national team, he has been renowned for introducing players from the Iranian diaspora to the national squad.

These two teams were among the strongest Asian national football teams during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, the teams have developed one of Asia's greatest rivalries. Although the teams only had one chance to play against each other in the final match of the AFC Asian Cup, in 1972, they faced each other five consecutive times at the quarterfinals stage from 1996\u20132011.

In the contemporary era, especially during the reign of Saddam Hussein, the two countries had bad relations and fought the Iran\u2013Iraq War for 8 years. In 2001, for the first time in decades, an Iran-Iraq match was not held at a neutral venue. The rivalry was escalated after Iraq knocked Iran out of the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in controversial circumstances; Iran lodged a complaint to the AFC that one of Iraq's players had submitted a positive doping test months before, hoping to see Iraq removed from the tournament and themselves reinstated in their place, but the complaint was rejected.
