    "text": "I Can See Your House from Here is the seventh studio album by English progressive rock band Camel. Released in 1979, a new line up was introduced with founding members Andrew Latimer (guitar) and Andy Ward (drums) joined by bassist Colin Bass (to replace Richard Sinclair) and keyboardists Jan Schelhaas (who joined in 1978 for the Breathless tour) and Kit Watkins (ex- Happy The Man) who replaced Dave Sinclair. At one point, the album was going to be called Endangered Species.John Tracy's liner notes on I Can See Your House from Here album's Decca 1989 CD editionCamel - I Can See Your House from Here (1979) album review at www.rajaz.co.uk == Recording == Work started on the album in summer 1979, collaborating with producer Rupert Hine, at the Farmyard Studios in Little Chalfont. The process also took place in an Elizabethan country house, a residential recording studio that suited the band well. The orchestral overdubs were added at London's AIR Studios. Mel Collins (who also worked with Caravan) contributed to the band's sound on the saxophone, while Genesis' drummer/vocalist Phil Collins was chosen to play percussion. Andy Latimer was pleased with the end product, saying Hine \"was great fun to work with, he was really up and zappy. I enjoyed making that record. We did it rather quickly and it wasn't a lengthy production.\" The album was released in October 1979. It spent three weeks in the chart in late October and early November, reaching No. 45\\. An accompanying single was planned, but shelved. Instead a maxi single containing an edited version of Andy Latimer and Kit Watkins \"Remote Romance\" was backed with \"Rainbow's End\" from Breathless (1978) and a Camel / Mick Glossop production of \"Tell Me\", first released on Rain Dances (1977). It did not reach the charts. The single \"Your Love is Stranger than Mine\" / \"Neon Magic\" followed in February 1980. == Cover artwork == The cover image is based on a joke that was somewhat popular at the time, in which Jesus, while hanging up on the Cross dying, calls out for his disciple Peter to come to him, who does so with great difficulty. The punchline is that Jesus merely wants to tell Peter, \"I can see your house from here.\" http://www.magenta.co.il/camel/humour/injokes.htm ==Tour== The world tour began on 8 October at The Dome, Brighton, England, following France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and ended on 29 January 1980 in Koseinenkin Hall of Tokyo, Japan. == Track listing == ;Side one #\"Wait\" (Andrew Latimer, John McBurnie) \u2013 5:02 #* Andrew Latimer \u2013 guitar, backing vocals #* Kit Watkins \u2013 Yamaha electric grand and Rhodes electric pianos, Hammond C3 organ, Solina and Moog synthesizers #* Jan Schelhaas \u2013 Yamaha electric grand piano, Yamaha CS-80, Prophet-5 and Moog synthesizers #* Colin Bass \u2013 bass, lead vocals #* Andy Ward \u2013 drums #\"Your Love Is Stranger Than Mine\" (Colin Bass, Latimer, Jan Schelhaas, Andy Ward) \u2013 3:26 #* Andrew Latimer \u2013 guitar, backing vocals #* Kit Watkins \u2013 Prophet-5 synthesizer #* Jan Schelhaas \u2013 Yamaha electric grand piano, Minimoog #* Colin Bass \u2013 bass, lead vocals #* Andy Ward \u2013 drums #* Mel Collins \u2013 alto saxophone #\"Eye of the Storm\" (Kit Watkins) \u2013 3:52 \u2013 this was an updated version of a track that Watkins had played with his previous band Happy the Man #* Andrew Latimer \u2013 guitar #* Kit Watkins \u2013 Hohner Clavinet, flute, Solina and Moog synthesizers #* Colin Bass \u2013 fretless Wal bass #* Andy Ward \u2013 drums, massed marching military snares #\"Who We Are\" (Latimer) \u2013 7:52 #* Andrew Latimer \u2013 guitar, lead vocals, flute, autoharp #* Kit Watkins \u2013 Solina and Moog synthesizers #* Jan Schelhaas \u2013 grand piano #* Colin Bass \u2013 bass, backing vocals #* Andy Ward \u2013 drums #* Simon Jeffes \u2013 orchestral arrangements ;Side two # * \"Survival\" (Latimer) \u2013 1:12 #* Simon Jeffes \u2013 orchestral arrangements #* Gavin Wright \u2013 leader of the orchestra #\"Hymn to Her\" (Latimer, Schelhaas) \u2013 5:37 #* Andrew Latimer \u2013 guitar, lead vocals, flute, autoharp #* Kit Watkins \u2013 Hohner Clavinet, Hammond C3 organ, Solina and Moog synthesizers #* Jan Schelhaas \u2013 grand piano #* Colin Bass \u2013 bass, backing vocals #* Andy Ward \u2013 drums #\"Neon Magic\" (Latimer, Vivienne McAuliffe, Schelhaas) \u2013 4:39 #* Andrew Latimer \u2013 guitar, lead vocals #* Kit Watkins \u2013 Hammond C3 organ, Yamaha CS-80 and Solina synthesizers #* Jan Schelhaas \u2013 Yamaha electric grand piano, Solina, Yamaha CS-80 and Moog synthesizers #* Colin Bass \u2013 bass #* Andy Ward \u2013 drums #\"Remote Romance\" (Latimer, Watkins) \u2013 4:07 #* Andrew Latimer \u2013 guitar #* Kit Watkins \u2013 Hohner Clavinet, Yamaha CS-80 and Moog synthesizers, EMS sequencer #* Jan Schelhaas \u2013 EMS sequencer #* Andy Ward \u2013 drums, percussion, loops #\"Ice\" (Latimer) \u2013 10:17 #* Andrew Latimer \u2013 guitar #* Kit Watkins \u2013 Yamaha electric grand and Rhodes electric pianos, Hammond C3 organ, Solina and Moog synthesizers #* Jan Schelhaas \u2013 grand piano #* Colin Bass \u2013 bass #* Andy Ward \u2013 drums Camel - I Can See Your House from Here (1979) album releases & credits at Discogs.com ;2009 Expanded & Remastered Edition # * \"Remote Romance\" (Single version) #\"Ice\" (Live 1981) \u2013 7:15 == Personnel == ;Camel * Andrew Latimer \u2013 guitars, flute, backing vocals; autoharp on \"Who We Are\"; lead vocals on \"Who We Are\", \"Hymn to Her\" and \"Neon Magic\" * Colin Bass \u2013 bass, backing vocals; lead vocals on \"Wait\" and \"Your Love Is Stranger Than Mine\" * Kit Watkins \u2013 Hammond C3 organ, Solina synthesizer, Yamaha electric grand piano, Rhodes electric piano, Moog synthesizer, Minimoog, Hohner Clavinet, Prophet-5, Yamaha CS-80, EMS Sequencer, flute * Jan Schelhaas \u2013 Yamaha CS-80, Yamaha electric grand piano, grand piano, Prophet-5, Moog synthesizer, Minimoog, EMS Sequencer * Andy Ward \u2013 drums, percussion ;Additional musicians * Mel Collins \u2013 alto saxophone on \"Your Love Is Stranger Than Mine\" * Phil Collins \u2013 percussion * Rupert Hine \u2013 backing vocals * Simon Jeffes \u2013 orchestral arrangements on \"Who We Are\" and \"Survival\" ==References== ==External links== * Camel - I Can See Your House from Here (1979) album review by Matthew Plichta, credits & releases at AllMusic.com * * Camel - I Can See Your House from Here (1979) album review by Shachar Sagui, credits & user reviews at SputnikMusic.com * Camel - I Can See Your House from Here (1979) album to be listened as stream at Play.Spotify.com Category:1979 albums Category:Camel (band) albums Category:Deram Records albums Category:Albums produced by Rupert Hine ",
