Between January 2005 and May 2009, Love served as the Executive Director for the MCC denomination. Love was appointed Executive Director of the liberally-oriented (although still based on the Apostle's and Nicene Creeds) Metropolitan Community Church in January 2005. Love is also the author of Would Jesus Discriminate? The 21st Century Question. This book is part of a broader campaign to prompt churches to consider the ways that religious attitudes against homosexuality may contribute to wider discrimination against gays and lesbians. Although the campaign began in 2006, it continues to influence the discussion. News articles from 2009 show that churches are still hosting \"town halls\" on the issue in places like Anchorage, Alaska, and that people are still using the slogan at marriage-equality rallies in Bloomington, Indiana and in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. ==Personal== Love has two children from her first marriage. In 2005 she married Sue Jennings in Canada after the country introduced legislation permitting same-sex marriages. They later announced plans to marry under Californian law at a ceremony to be conducted in Los Angeles on June 24, 2008. ==References== ==External links== * Gay Religious Leader Addresses Congressional Summit on Katrina Relief * Would Jesus Discriminate? project website Category:LGBT Protestant clergy Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Living people Category:Metropolitan Community Church clergy Category:Abilene Christian University alumni Category:People from Abilene, Texas Category:Louisiana Tech University alumni Category:Texas Tech University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American business executives Category:Activists from Texas ",
