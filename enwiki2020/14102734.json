    "text": "Mandageria fairfaxi (Pronunciation: Man-daj-ee-ree-a fair-fax-i) is an extinct lobe-finned fishAge of Fishes Museum, Canowindra that lived during the Late Devonian period (Frasnian \u2013 Famennian). It is related to the much larger Hyneria; although Mandageria was smaller, it probably hunted in the same way. The generic epithet, Mandageria, refers to the Mandagery Sandstone, outcropping near Canowindra, Australia, where the fossils were found. The specific epithet, fairfaxi, honors the philanthropist James Fairfax. M. fairfaxi is the state fossil emblem for New South Wales. ==Description== Mandageria was a large predator about long. It had a long torpedo-shaped body and large tail fins. Mandageria also had large pectoral fins which could have helped it manoeuvre around submerged logs when preparing to attack its prey. Mandageria had a functional neck joint, an otherwise uncommon feature among fish - Tiktaalik, Tarrasius, placoderms (esp. Arthrodira) and seahorses being other exceptions. ==References== ==External links== * Mandageria at Palaeos * Review of Mandageria * The braincase and palate of Mandageria fairfaxi * The fossil skull of Mandageria * Reconstruction of Mandageria * Mandageria page and size comparison to a person and other lobe-finned fish Category:Tristichopterids Category:Prehistoric lobe-finned fish genera Category:Devonian bony fish Category:Prehistoric fish of Australia ",
