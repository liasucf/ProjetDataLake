    "text": "The Palatine Northern Railways Company (Gesellschaft der Pf\u00e4lzischen Nordbahnen) \u2013 abbreviated to Palatine Northern Railway (Pf\u00e4lzer Nordbahn) - was founded on 17 April 1866 as the last of the three major private railway companies in the Bavarian province of the Palatinate. From the outset it left the management and running of its railways to the Palatine Ludwigsbahn. Because the Ludwigsbahn company and the Palatine Maximilian Railway had already built their railway networks in central and southern Palatinate, the Palatine Northern Railway was only left with the region north of the line Ludwigshafen\u2013Kaiserslautern\u2013Homburg for its area of operations. It began working on 22 September 1868 with the opening of the 29 km long Landstuhl\u2013Kusel railway: Landstuhl\u2013Glan-M\u00fcnchweiler\u2013Altenglan\u2013Kusel. On 1 January 1870 as it agreed to merge with the other two Palatine railway organisations into the managerial and operating company of the United Palatine Railways, it also took over the entire shareholding of the Neustadt\u2013D\u00fcrkheim Railway Company, whose railway line, opened in 1865, had been run by the Palatine Ludwigsbahn to that point in time. The construction of the most important northern railway lines was then started: *The Alsenz Valley Railway\u2014Hochspeyer\u2013Enkenbach\u2013Langmeil\u2013Winnweiler\u2013Bad M\u00fcnster (49 km)\u2014ran on 29 October 1870 to Winnweiler and was completed on 16 May 1871. From Alsenz station a narrow gauge line branched off to Obermoschel (opened on 1 October 1903). *The Zeller Valley Railway (opened 23 October 1872) ran from Marnheim to what became the Donnersbergbahn and enabled a link via Harxheim- to the Rhine-Hessian hub at Monsheim. *The Palatine Northern Railway from Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe, D\u00fcrkheim ran via Freinsheim\u2013Gr\u00fcnstadt\u2013Bockenheim\u2013Kindenheim to Monsheim (22 km) along the present-day \"wine road\" (Weinstra\u00dfe). On 15 October 1877 a cross-link from Freinsheim to Frankenthal (14 km) was added. *The Donnersberg Railway\u2014Langmeil\u2013Marnheim\u2013Kirchheimbolanden\u2013Alzey (35 km)\u2014appeared in 1873/74 and included the Kaiserslautern\u2013Eselsf\u00fcrth\u2013Enkenbach section (13 km), which joined it on 15 May 1875. *The Eis Valley Railway (opened 24 June 1876) ran from Gr\u00fcnstadt via Ebertsheim station to Eisenberg (9 km) with a branch from Ebertsheim Hp\u2013Hettenleidelheim (4 km) opened in 1895. *The Lauter Valley Railway (taken into service 15 November 1883)\u2014Kaiserslautern\u2013Wolfstein\u2013Lauterecken-Grumbach (35 km)\u2014was extended in 1896/97 in the Glan valley by 21 km from Meisenheim to Odernheim\u2013Staudernheim and on 1 May 1904 on the right bank of the Nahe river from Odernheim to Bad M\u00fcnster am Stein (16 km). *On 15 September 1900 Gr\u00fcnstadt station became the departure point for a link to Weiler Neuoffstein on the Worms-Offstein railway run by the South German Railway Company (7 km) and on 1 March 1903 for the Leiningen Valley Railway to Altleiningen (11 km). *Finally on 1 May 1904 the opening of the Homburg\u2013Glan-M\u00fcnchweiler (22 km) and Altenglan\u2013Offenbach- Hundheim\u2013Lauterecken-Grumbach (20 km) sections of the Glan Valley Railway enabled through trains to run between Mainz and Saarbr\u00fccken, something which was also desirable for military reasons. On 1 January 1909 the company was nationalised and absorbed into the Royal Bavarian State Railways. ==See also== *Royal Bavarian State Railways Category:Defunct railway companies of Germany Category:Railway lines in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Railway companies established in 1866 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1870 Category:German companies established in 1866 Category:1870 disestablishments in Germany ",
