    "text": "The Wehra Dam () is a dam which impounds the River Wehra near Wehr in the county of Waldshut in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Its reservoir forms the lower basin of the Hornberg stage (Wehr Power Station) and it is thus part of the Schluchseewerk network. The upper basin of the pumped-storage power station is the Hornberg Basin; the cavern with its power station lies inside the mountain about half way between the two basins. == See also == *List of dams in Germany == References == == Literature == *Peter Franke, Wolfgang Frey: Talsperren in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland.
