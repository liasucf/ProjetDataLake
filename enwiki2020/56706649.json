Name is derived from tit (sjenice in Croatian) and the municipality of Lasinja. On 21 September 1897, residents of Sjeni\u010dak Lasinjski rose in rebellion (known as Sjeni\u010dak rebellion, Croatian: Sjeni\u010darska buna) against (perceived) Hungarisation and loss of privileges previously granted to them as border guards. A number of young men from the village, Dr. Gojko Nikoli\u0161 being one of them, went to Spain to fight as members of the International Brigade in 1936-1937. Sjeni\u010dak Lasinjski suffered significant demographic losses in the World War II with 352 of its residents perishing. Out of those, 137 were civilian victims of fascism, 68 were fallen partisans and 111 succumbed to typhoid.Du\u0161an Bai\u0107 \"Kotar Vrginmost u NO borbi 1941-1945.\"/\"District of Vrginmost during National Liberation War 1941-1945: Sjeni\u010dak Lasinjski\", pages 60-623, 1980 ==Culture== The first Serbian Orthodox Parish in the village, which included the village of Prkos Lasinjski, was established in 1715.
