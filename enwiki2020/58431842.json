    "text": "Chinese Taipei is expected to compete at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games have been postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Chinese Taipei\" is the designated name used by Taiwan to participate in some international organizations and almost all sporting events, including the Olympic Games. Neither the common name \"Taiwan\" nor the official name \"Republic of China\" can be used due primarily to opposition from the People's Republic of China. It will also be the nation's tenth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics. ==Archery== Taiwanese archers qualified each for the men's and women's events by reaching the quarterfinal stage of their respective team recurves at the 2019 World Archery Championships in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands. The Taiwanese archery team for the Games, led by two-time Olympian Tan Ya-ting and reigning world champion Lei Chien-ying in the women's individual recurve, was announced on 16 January 2020, based on the results at the Olympic Team Trials. ;Men {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Ranking round !Round of 64 !Round of 32 !Round of 16 !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !colspan=\"2\"|Final / |- style=\"font-size:95%\" !Score !Seed !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Rank |- align=center |align=left|Deng Yu-cheng |align=left rowspan=3|Individual | | | | | | | | | |- align=center |align=left|Tang Chih- chun | | | | | | | | | |- align=center |align=left|Wei Chun-heng | | | | | | | | | |- align=center |align=left|Deng Yu-cheng Tang Chih-chun Wei Chun-heng |align=left|Team | | |colspan=2 | | | | | |} ;Women {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Ranking round !Round of 64 !Round of 32 !Round of 16 !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !colspan=\"2\"|Final / |- style=\"font-size:95%\" !Score !Seed !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Rank |- align=center |align=left|Lei Chien-ying |align=left rowspan=3|Individual | | | | | | | | | |- align=center |align=left|Lin Chia-en | | | | | | | | | |- align=center |align=left|Tan Ya-ting | | | | | | | | | |- align=center |align=left|Lei Chien-ying Lin Chia-en Tan Ya-ting |align=left|Team | | |colspan=2 | | | | | |} ;Mixed {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Ranking round !Round of 16 !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !colspan=\"2\"|Final / |- style=\"font-size:95%\" !Score !Seed !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Rank |- align=center |align=left| |align=left|Team | | | | | | | |} == Boxing == Chinese Taipei entered four female boxers into the Olympic tournament.
