The clerk's office, dating from the 1780s, is the oldest extant government office building in West Virginia. The kitchen building (c. 1750) is the oldest extant component of the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House and the oldest extant building in Romney. Throughout the course of its history, the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House has also been known as the Andrew Wodrow House, the Mytinger Family Home, and the Mytinger House. The earliest recorded person residing on Lot Number 48 in Romney was Hugh Murphy. In 1763, Colonel George William Wilson received a patent to Lot Number 48 from Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron to purchase the lot from Murphy. Wilson served as major of the Hampshire County militia during the French and Indian War. Wilson relocated to Pennsylvania, and in 1770, George Washington spent the night in a log cabin on the northeastern corner of Lot Number 48. Andrew Wodrow arrived in Hampshire County during the latter phase of the American Revolutionary War or shortly after its close, and in 1782, he was named clerk of court for Hampshire County. Wodrow completed the clerk\u2019s office building in the 1780s, and the complex assumed its current composition by 1790. Wodrow served as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County until his death in 1814, after which ownership passed to Wodrow\u2019s son-in-law John McDowell, a Dr. McClinoch, and the Mytinger family. who retained the property for about 100 years. Manning H. Williams purchased the house, and restored it in 1962. The Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House was purchased by Dr. Herbert P. Stelling in 1973, and it was opened as a museum and an arts and handicrafts shop known as Colonial Craftsmen. While under Stelling family ownership, the house was listed to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. In 1985, the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House was purchased by its current owners, Old Hampshire, Ltd. == Geography and setting == The Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House property is located at 51 West Gravel Lane near the center of Romney, West Virginia, within the eastern section of town Lot Number 48 and the western section of Lot Number 58. Taggart Hall, a late 18th-century residence, is located to the property's immediate east, and serves as the headquarters for the Fort Mill Ridge Foundation, the Hampshire County Convention and Visitors Bureau, and the Hampshire County Chamber of Commerce. Across West Gravel Lane to the immediate south of the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House is the parking lot of the Romney Volunteer Fire Department, which was formerly the location of the town's Old Presbyterian Church and Cemetery on Lots No. 59 and 60. == History == === Background === Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron The land upon which the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House is located was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a land grant that the exiled Charles II awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the English Interregnum. Following the Restoration in 1660, CharlesII finally ascended to the English throne. He renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantees Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper, and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington, in 1672. In 1681 Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, who received a new charter for the entire land grant from James II in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, in 1719. The area surrounding present-day Romney remained sparsely populated by European settlers until the middle of the 18th century, when tensions with Native Americans began to alleviate. Around this time, Lord Fairfax desired to have the lands of his Northern Neck Proprietary utilized and enticed European settlers to relocate there. This initiative by Lord Fairfax led to the establishment of population centers, such as Romney. After Lord Fairfax settled at Greenway Court near Winchester, he personally oversaw the selling and settling of his proprietary lands. One of his surveyors, George Washington, noted in 1748 that a number of people were living in the vicinity of present-day Romney. County records also indicated that Lord Fairfax began selling land within present-day Hampshire County in 1749. However, the name of the first person to own or build on the lot on which the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House stands is not currently known. By 1754, Hampshire County was formed from parts of Frederick and Augusta counties. Gravel Lane, the present-day street upon which the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House is located, is aligned to an old trail utilized by Native Americans prior to the arrival of European settlers. Gravel Lane was Romney's original main street, and according to the Federal Writers' Project in its Historic Romney 1762\u20131937 (1937), Gravel Lane \"is the most historic lane in the town\u2014and perhaps in the Northern Neck.\" === Wilson family === The earliest known person to own Lot Number 48, on which the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House is located, was Hugh Murphy. In 1763, Colonel George William Wilson received a patent to Lot Number 48 from Lord Fairfax and purchased the lot from Murphy. Wilson arrived in Romney sometime between 1761 and 1763. According to a report by George Washington to the Virginia House of Burgesses in November 1764, Wilson served as major of the Hampshire County militia during the French and Indian War. Washington praised Wilson for his earnestness and courage. Wilson's residency in Romney was brief, and sometime between 1764 and 1768, he relocated to Pennsylvania. Colonel George Washington, by alt=Painting of Washington, by Charles Wilson Peale, standing in a formal pose, in a colonel's uniform, right hand inserted in shirt. On the night of October 9, 1770, George Washington purportedly stayed the night in an old log house at the northeastern corner of Lot Number 48. This night was his final visit to Romney. In his diary, Washington wrote: Wilson became a justice of the peace for newly established Bedford County, Pennsylvania in 1771. Wilson was involved with the Pennsylvania\u2013Virginia boundary dispute, and was also selected by the Pennsylvanian faction at Fort Pitt to supervise the election of delegates to the constitutional convention from Pennsylvania. He encouraged support for the American Revolution and became the lieutenant colonel of the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment during the American Revolutionary War. He died of illness during the regiment's march to join Washington in New Jersey in January 1777. Wilson's daughter Mary Ann married Andrew Wodrow, and following Wilson's death, the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House passed to his son-in-law Wodrow. === Wodrow family === Andrew Wodrow was born in Scotland, possibly in Glasgow, in 1752. Wodrow was descended from a family of scholars and professors. His father Robert Wodrow was a historian of the Church of Scotland with a \"national reputation\" and published his history in 1752, the same year as Wodrow's birth. Wodrow immigrated to the Colony of Virginia in 1768. During the 1770s, he established and expanded what became a thriving import business in Fredericksburg. Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, he abandoned his business rather than import and sell goods from the Kingdom of Great Britain. Following the cessation of his import business, Wodrow was appointed to serve in the political post of clerk for the Revolutionary Committee for King George County on May 6, 1775. Wodrow arrived in Hampshire County during the latter phase of the American Revolutionary War or shortly after its close, and in 1782, he was named clerk of court for Hampshire County. Although he was the third person to hold this office, Wodrow was the first clerk to reside in the county. As a key official, Wodrow played an important role in the conveying and settling of lands and was a prosperous landholder in his own right. Wodrow is credited with giving the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House complex its current form. He completed the grouping of the three sections of the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House and his association with the property lent the complex significance for its listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In the 1780s, Wodrow built the frame structure (the last of the house's three structures) on the property for use as a clerk's office. At that time, Gravel Lane was the main street of Romney and the function and architectural beauty of the clerk's office made it a center of activity in the town. According to West Virginia Antiquities Commission research assistant Phillip R. Pitts and historian James E. Harding, the clerk's office \"might have served as a sign that [the Romney community] was developing in a manner indicative of the end of a frontier existence and the start of an established position.\" By the beginning of the 19th century, Romney and Hampshire County had become a settled area with an agriculturally based economy that maintained a fairly constant growth. By 1790, the three structures constituting the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House probably assumed their present arrangement. In 1790, the trustees of the Town of Romney commissioned John Mitchel to draft a cadastral survey map of Romney. Prior to this survey, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron had commissioned a similar cadastral survey of the town sometime before its incorporation on December 23, 1762. On June 30, 1790, Mitchel submitted to the trustees a \"Plan of the Town of Romney\" that divided the town into 100 land lots of equal size, including the two lots on which the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House was located (Lots Number 48 and 58). Wodrow remained in his post as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County until his death in 1814. Successive owners included Wodrow's son-in-law John McDowell, Dr. McClinoch who was one of Romney's first physicians, and the Mytinger family, in whose hands the property remained for about 100 years. ===Mytinger family=== Tobias Mytinger acquired the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House property in 1861. The Mytinger family possessed the house among its members for the longest period of any of the house's owning families, for almost 100 years. Manning H. Williams purchased the house from the Mytinger family in 1959. === Williams family and restoration === The effort to restore the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House complex began in 1962 while it was under the ownership of Manning H. Williams. Up until that time, much of the structures' original building materials and architectural details remained extant, although in a state of deterioration. Modern conveniences, including electricity, plumbing, and a central heating system, had not been installed. The restoration project commenced with the clerk's office in June 1962. During the restoration of the clerk's office, the structure's doors, woodwork, stairs, floors, and the majority of its plaster were retained. Replicas of the second story windows were fabricated, and old glass was collected from around the area and placed in the wooden sashes of the replica windows. Some of the structure's weatherboards were also replaced, and afterward, the exterior of the clerk's office was painted white. Ceilings with radiant electric heating were installed, and insulation was building insulation was added between the walls. During the painting of the structure's walls and woodwork, a concerted effort was made to duplicate the original or period paint colors. The residential structure, also known as \"the dwelling,\" required more extensive rehabilitation. Its floor beams were completely rebuilt, its rafters were replaced, and a new roof of red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) roof shingles were installed. Much of the brickwork of the residential structure's double chimneys had to be repaired. A section of the interior eastern wall of the largest first floor room was removed to unmask the half-timber construction, and another section was opened to expose the hand-riven lath. The structure's northern elevation retained some of its original siding, due to its protection by the porch, so it's siding was duplicated around the remainder of the exterior and painted white. The rear kitchen building was cleaned, repaired, and covered with new weatherboards, both its interior and exterior were painted white, and it was topped with cedar shakes. All the surrounding porches were rebuilt and roofed with cedar shingles, a brick walk was placed along the western (front) side of the clerk's office and around the residential structure to the rear of the property, and a white picket fence was built around the property. === Stelling family and Colonial Craftsmen === The Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House was purchased by Dr. Herbert P. Stelling of Barre, Massachusetts in May 1973. In October 1973, the house was opened as a museum and an arts and handicrafts shop known as Colonial Craftsmen. The museum and store were operated by four proprietors: Stelling's daughters Rebecca Stelling, Deborah Stelling, and Rhetta Stelling, and Gary Winkles. Colonial Craftsmen featured demonstrations of old craft skills and the sale of traditional craftsmen wares. While under Stelling family ownership, the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House was listed to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on August 22, 1977. It was only the second historic property in Hampshire County to be listed on NRHP after the Sloan\u2013Parker House. ===Old Hampshire, Ltd.=== In October 1985, the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House was purchased by Old Hampshire, Ltd., which consisted of Bob and Estelle Odle, Tom Stump, Lowell Hott, and Dottie Eddis. Hott and Eddis originally planned to convert the complex into a bed and breakfast; however, since 1988, they have utilized the residential house as the Romney satellite office for their Augusta Animal Hospital veterinary clinic. Hott and Eddis have continued to maintain and restore the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House, and have completed large construction projects, including a renovation of the kitchen building's crumbling stone chimney and a replacement of the roof's shingles from the 1962 restoration in December 2019. In a 2019 interview with the Hampshire Review regarding their continued maintenance and restoration of the property, Hott remarked, \"It's really been a labor of love for us.\" === Old Presbyterian Church and Cemetery === Headstones relocated to Indian Mound Cemetery from the Old Presbyterian Cemetery Immediately south of the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House, across East Gravel Lane, is the former location of Romney's Old Presbyterian Church and Cemetery. The church and cemetery were associated with the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House, as Andrew Wodrow was a dynamic and influential member of the Presbyterian Church and granted Lots No. 59 and 60 in his will for the construction of the church and the establishment of the cemetery. Wodrow's executor, James Dailey, deeded the two land lots on April 1, 1816, to Mount Bethel Congregation trustees James Beach, William Inskeep, Adam Hare, and John Lawson for these purposes. Wodrow was interred in this cemetery, which was located atop the hill of the two lots. The Presbyterian church was built near the corner of West Gravel Lane and South High Streets between 1812 and 1816. The Old Presbyterian Cemetery fell into neglect by the late 19th century and was destroyed around 1940 when the hill on which it was located was cut away and leveled for the construction of a factory. Although some human remains and headstones were relocated to Indian Mound Cemetery, Wodrow's remains were likely lost during the destruction of the cemetery. == Architecture == The Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House is a complex composed of three independent structures varying in size, type of construction, building orientation, and purpose. Architectural historian S. Allen Chambers characterized the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House complex as, \"a charmingly informal assemblage\" and \"wonderfully forthright.\" The three component structures were built between the 1740s and the 1780s, and consist of the one and one-half-story kitchen structure (c. 1750), the one and one-half-story residential structure, and the two and one-half-story clerk's office (1780s). The kitchen structure is the rear (northern) component of the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House, the residential structure is the middle component, and the clerk's office is located to the front (southern end) of the property along West Gravel Lane. All three structures are positioned in close proximity to one other and have been connected by a series of one-story porches throughout the majority of their existence, which has facilitated their use as a single building. According to West Virginia Antiquities Commission research assistant Phillip R. Pitts and historian James E. Harding, the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House represents \"a sophistication in building style and design that was unusual, if not unique, in the frontier environment of the area during the second half of the eighteenth century.\" Pitts and Harding further stated that the architecture of the three contributing structures is \"representative of a time period spanning much of the early history and development of Romney and what is now eastern West Virginia.\" === Kitchen structure (c. 1750) === alt=A one and one-half-story white wooden building The rear (northern) structure contributing to the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House dates from around 1750, and is thought to be the oldest extant building on the property and in Romney. It is assessed to have been utilized as a kitchen throughout the majority of its existence. The kitchen structure is one and one-half stories in height and measures by . It is constructed of hand-hewn logs, its exterior is sheathed in white-painted beaded weatherboard siding, and its gable roof is topped by red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) roof shingles. The kitchen structure is accessible by a single entryway situated on its southern fa\u00e7ade, which is connected to the adjacent residential structure of the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House by a covered porch. A large stone chimney dominates the kitchen structure's northern side, directly opposite the entryway on its southern side. One single six-over-three-light wooden sash window is located in the center of each of the building's long sides on the ground floor, and two four-light wooden sash windows are located in the southern gable opposite the fireplace to provide light to the upper story. An enclosed stairway provides access to the upper story and is situated opposite the fireplace side of the building. The interior walls of the kitchen structure are painted white. Between 2009 and 2014, the kitchen building's stone chimney began to crumble, and it was rebuilt using some of the original stones. In addition, the cedar shingles from the 1962 restoration were replaced in December 2019. === Residential structure === The residential structure or \"the dwelling\" of the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House is located immediately in front of the rear kitchen structure. The residential structure is one and one-half stories in height and measures by . It is built of frame construction with brick nogging, and its exterior is sheathed in white-painted beaded weatherboard siding. The structure is topped by a gable roof. Its exterior is symmetrically arranged, with the exception of the prominent double brick chimneys situated on its western side, which are connected by a pent on the ground floor. Central entryways are positioned on both the rear (northern) and front (southern) fa\u00e7ades, with six-over-six-light wooden sash windows positioned on either side of each respective doorway. The upper level of the residential structure is illuminated by wooden sash windows located in both its east and west gables. The two windows on the western gable with the double chimneys are small four- light wooden sash windows, and the two windows on the eastern gable are six- over-six-light wooden sash windows. alt=A one and one-half-story white wooden building with double brick chimneys. The residential structure consists of four rooms: two traversing the ground level lengthwise and two traversing the upper level lengthwise. The front room on both the ground and upper levels is long and narrow in shape. The double chimneys on the structure's western side allow for fireplaces in each of the four rooms. The western fireplace walls in each of the four rooms are enveloped by raised wooden panelling. West Virginia Antiquities Commission research assistant Phillip R. Pitts and historian James E. Harding stated that the raised-panel fireplace walls \"give the building a far more residential quality than the log structure behind it.\" The raised panelling of the western walls is modest in design and includes a pent closet flanking the left side of the segmental-arched fireplace opening in each of the four rooms. A bolection molding frames the segmental-arched fireplace opening, however, there is no mantel shelf. A simple cornice with a cavetto molding runs the length of the raised panelling. With the exception of the fireplace wall, the interior walls of the ground floor rooms are made of painted plaster and the second floor rooms' walls are made of painted flush boards. The structure's upper level is accessed by an enclosed stairway along the eastern wall of the larger rear rooms opposite the paneled fireplace walls. According to Pitts and Harding, the architectural style and construction pattern of the residential structure were similar to buildings in Tidewater Maryland built in a period before 1730. They averred that regardless of the structure's origin, it would have been \"an expensive and pretentious structure\" for the Romney area during that period of time. The half-timber construction with brick nogging, the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger Housedouble brick chimneys with a connecting pent, and the medieval floor plan are features generally not associated with present-day West Virginia. The residential structure was possibly constructed for Lord Fairfax or his land agent. However, it is not known whether the kitchen structure was a preexisting pioneer home or a contemporary kitchen. Pitts and Harding theorized that if Lord Fairfax constructed the residential structure, he did so \"to encourage development of the area by emphasizing that the Indian menace had abated and the location was suitable to a settled and prosperous existence.\" === Clerk's office (1780s) === The largest and most imposing structure contributing to the Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House complex is the two and one-half-story \"clerk's office.\" This building is the oldest extant public office building in the state of West Virginia. It is built of wooden frame construction and measures by , with its southern gable facing perpendicular toward Gravel Lane and its main entryway positioned on the structure's western (front) elevation. Both the front (western) and rear (eastern) fa\u00e7ades are three bays wide, with nine- over-nine-light wooden sash windows in the ground floor bays, and six-over- six-light wooden sash windows in the second floor bays. The symmetry of the front fa\u00e7ade's windows is interrupted with the placement of the main entryway in the most southern of the three bays, which is spaced slightly further to the right of the above bay. The structure's main fa\u00e7ade is adjoined with a one-story shed-roofed porch supported by chamfered wooden columns. On the structure's eastern fa\u00e7ade, the six bays are symmetrically placed with three six-over-six-light wooden sash windows on the second story and three nine- over-nine-light wooden sash windows on the ground floor. alt=A two-story white wooden house viewed from the street According to Pitts and Harding, the placement of the window bays and the front entryway bay are \"a rather sophisticated indication of the interior room arrangement.\" Each of the structure's floors is divided between a large room and a narrow stair hall (in a side-hall plan), which connects the two stories by an open dog-leg stairway. The large room on each floor has a paneled fireplace wall on its northern end. On the first floor of the clerk's office, the segmental-arched fireplace opening is bordered by a single crossette architrave. Pitts and Harding describe the wooden panelling on the fireplace wall as being \"exceptional.\" The fireplace mantel's shelf support exhibits moldings identical to the cornice, including a \"wall of Troy\" motif. The fireplace wall is separated into three sections by fluted pilasters; the sections consist of the segmental-arched fireplace with mantelpiece and the end segments of raised wooden panelling on either side of the fireplace. On the second floor, the wooden panelling is more simple in design, and the fireplace wall is divided into three segments with raised wooden panels. The fireplace wall is only adorned with a mantelpiece containing a \"wall of Troy\" motif and a cornice with dentils. All other interior walls within the clerk's office structure are painted plaster. === Old log house === The Wilson\u2013Wodrow\u2013Mytinger House property formerly contained an old log house where George Washington purportedly stayed in 1770 during his final visit to Romney. The house stood at the northeastern corner of Lot Number 48 until it was demolished in 1932. == See also == * List of historic sites in Hampshire County, West Virginia * National Register of Historic Places listings in Hampshire County, West Virginia == References == === Explanatory notes === === Citations === == Bibliography == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Category:Buildings and structures in Romney, West Virginia Category:Colonial architecture in West Virginia Category:Former government buildings in the United States Category:Georgian architecture in West Virginia Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Historic house museums in West Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1750 Category:Houses completed in 1780 Category:Houses in Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Log buildings and structures in West Virginia Category:Museums in Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:Office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Vernacular architecture in West Virginia ",
