    "text": "The 1928 United States presidential election in Delaware took place on November 6, 1928. All contemporary 48 states were part of the 1928 United States presidential election. Delaware voters chose 3 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president. Delaware was won by Republican Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California, who was running against Democratic Governor of New York Alfred E. Smith. Hoover's running mate was Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis of Kansas, while Smith's running mate was Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson of Arkansas. Hoover won with a majority of 65.03% of the vote to Smith's 34.60%, a margin of 30.43%. Socialist candidate Norman Thomas finished a distant third, with 0.31%. Hoover\u2019s performance is easily the best by any presidential candidate in Delaware, surpassing its nearest rival from Barack Obama in 2008 by 3.12%. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" ! colspan=\"6\" | 1928 United States presidential election in Delaware |-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\" ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes |- ! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican | Herbert Hoover | align=\"right\" | 68,860 | align=\"right\" | 65.03% | align=\"right\" | 3 |- ! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic | Alfred E.
