    "text": "James Charles Jones (born 13 February 1996) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for League One club Lincoln City. ==Club career== Jones was born in Dundee. He made his first-team debut for Crewe Alexandra as a 76th-minute substitute for Danny Haynes in Crewe Alexandra's 1\u20131 away draw to Crawley Town on 1 November 2014. He scored his first Crewe goal in a 3\u20132 win at Colchester United on 7 February 2015. In April 2017, Crewe triggered a contract clause keeping Jones at Crewe until June 2018. In August 2017, a potential transfer to an unnamed Championship side (later named as Preston North End) was cancelled due to concerns about a prolonged recovery from a hernia operation and a related pelvis issue. In mid-November 2017, he resumed light running on grass, having suffered some set-backs in his rehabilitation, but he suffered a medial ligament injury in training and in January 2018 was ruled out for the rest of the season, though he recovered to make six appearances, scoring once, before the season's end. On 1 May 2018, Jones signed a new two-year contract until summer 2020. At Milton Keynes on 19 January 2019, Jones suffered a suspected broken fibula (later diagnosed as severe lateral ligament damage) that ruled him out for six weeks. In June 2020, after the 2019-20 season was terminated prematurely during the COVID-19 pandemic, Jones was offered a new contract by Crewe manager David Artell, but was linked with a move to Lincoln City. This was confirmed on 6 July 2020, Jones joining Lincoln on a free transfer, having signed a 3-year contract. He made his debut for Lincoln starting the game in the EFL Cup on 5 September 2020 and in the following round, he scored his first goal for Lincoln City in a 5-0 win over Bradford City. ==International career== After making six appearances for Scotland U19s, Jones was selected to play for Scotland in the U21 European Championship qualifiers against Iceland and Macedonia in October 2016. He played the full 90 minutes of Scotland U21s' 2\u20130 defeat by Iceland in Reykjav\u00edk on 5 October, and 88 minutes of the following game, a 2\u20130 defeat by Macedonia in Skopje on 11 October. He then played in two friendlies: the November 2016 match against Slovakia and the March 2017 match against Estonia. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=6|Crewe Alexandra |2014\u201315 |League One||24||1||2||0||0||0||0||0||26||1 |- |2015\u201316 |League One||31||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||32||0 |- |2016\u201317 |League Two||45||10||2||1||2||0||1||0||50||11 |- ||2017\u201318||League Two||6||1||-||-||-||-||-||-||6||1 |- ||2018\u201319||League Two||38||5||-||-||1||0||3||1||42||6 |- ||2019\u201320||League Two||23||2||1||0||2||0||3||0||29||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !167!!19!!6!!1!!5!!0!!7!!1!!185!!21 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Lincoln City |2020\u201321 |League One |7||0||0||0||3||1||1||0||11||1 |- !colspan=3|Career total !174!!19!!6!!1!!8!!1!!8!!1!!196!!22 |} == Honours == Crewe Alexandra * EFL League Two: Runners-up: 2019-20 == References == ==External links== * * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Dundee Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland youth international footballers Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
