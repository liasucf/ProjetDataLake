    "text": "Artavasdes I (also spelled Artawazd, ) was the Artaxiad king of Armenia from 159 BC to 115 BC. He was the son and successor of Artaxias I. Artavasdes' name is the Latin attestation of an Old Iranian name \u1e5atavazd\u0101, identical to the Avestan A\u0161avazdah, presumably meaning \"powerful/persevering through truth\". In , the Parthian king Mithridates II () defeated Artavasdes I and made him acknowledge Parthian suzerainty. Artavasdes was forced to give the Parthians Tigranes as a hostage, who was either his son or nephew. According to Professor Cyril Toumanoff, Artavasdes I can be identified with the Armenian king who, according to the medieval Georgian annals, interfered in Iberia at the request of local nobility and installed his son, Artaxias, on the throne of Iberia, thereby inaugurating the Iberian Artaxiad dynasty. == References == == Sources == * * * * Category:123 BC deaths Category:2nd-century BC kings of Armenia Category:2nd-century BC rulers Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Artaxiad dynasty Category:Vassal rulers of the Parthian Empire ",
