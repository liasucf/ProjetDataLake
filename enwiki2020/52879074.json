    "text": "The Glorious Revolution of 1688 rearranged the political map of Europe, and led to a series of wars with France that lasted well over a century. This was the classic age of sail; while the ships themselves evolved in only minor ways, technique and tactics were honed to a high degree, and the battles of the Napoleonic Wars entailed feats that would have been impossible for the fleets of the 17th century. Because of parliamentary opposition, James II fled the country. The landing of William III and the Glorious Revolution itself was a gigantic effort involving 100 warships and 400 transports carrying 11,000 infantry and 4,000 horses. It was not opposed by the English or Scottish fleets. ==Historical overview== Naval operations in the War of the Spanish Succession (1702\u201313) were with the Dutch against the Spanish and French. They were at first focused on the acquisition of a Mediterranean base, culminating in an alliance with Portugal and the capture of Gibraltar (1704) and Port Mahon in Menorca (1708). In addition Newfoundland and Nova Scotia were obtained. Even so, freedom of action in the Mediterranean did not decide the war, although it gave the new Kingdom of Great Britain (created by the Union of England and Scotland in 1707) an advantage when negotiating the Peace of Utrecht, and made Britain a recognized great power. The British fleet ended Spanish occupation of Sicily in 1718 and in 1727 blockaded Panama. The subsequent quarter-century of peace saw a few naval actions. The navy was used against Russia and Sweden in the Baltic from 1715 to 1727 to protect supplies of naval stores. It was used at the Cape Passaro in 1718, during the Great Northern War, and in the West Indies (1726). There was a war against Spain in 1739 over the slave trade. In 1745 the navy transported troops and stores to Scotland to defeat the Jacobite rising. The War of Jenkins' Ear (1739\u201348) saw various naval operations in the Caribbean under different admirals against Spanish trade and possessions, before the war subsequently merged into the wider War of the Austrian Succession (1740\u20131748). This, in turn, brought a new round of naval operations against France. In 1745 the navy twice defeated the French off Finisterre but their convoys escaped. The Navy also defended against invasion by Charles Edward Stuart the \"Young Pretender\". By the end of the war, the Navy was fully engaged in the worldwide protection of British trade. The Seven Years' War (1756\u201363) began somewhat inauspiciously for the Navy, with a French siege of Menorca and the failure to relieve it. Menorca was lost but subsequent operations went more successfully (due more to government support and better strategic thinking, rather than admirals \"encouraged\" by Byng's example), and the British fleet won several victories. The French tried to invade Britain in 1759 but their force was defeated at Quiberon Bay. Spain entered the war against Britain in 1762 but lost Havana and Manila, though the latter was given back in exchange for Florida. The Treaty of Paris that ended the war left Britain with colonial gains, but isolated strategically. At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383), the Royal Navy dealt with the fledgling Continental Navy handily, destroying or capturing many of its vessels. France soon took the American side, and in 1778 a French fleet sailed for America, where it attempted to land at Rhode Island and nearly engaged with the British fleet before a storm intervened Spain and the Dutch Republic entered the war in 1780. Action shifted to the Caribbean, where there were a number of battles with varying results. The most important operation came in 1781 when, in the Battle of the Chesapeake, the British failed to lift the French blockade of Lord Cornwallis, resulting in a British surrender in the Battle of Yorktown. Although combat was over in North America, it continued in the Caribbean and India, where the British experienced both successes and failures. Though Menorca had been recaptured, it was returned to the Spanish. ==Organization eighteenth century== ===Admiralty of Great Britain=== File:English White Ensign 1620.svg|English Navy White Ensign 1700\u20131707 File:Naval Ensign of Great Britain (1707-1800).svg|British Navy White Ensign 1707\u20131801 File:White Squadron Ensign 1702-1707.svg|White Squadron Ensign 1702\u20131707 ====Commander in chiefs==== *Queen Anne *King George I *King George II *King George III ====Naval Lords of England and Great Britain==== *Office of the Lord High Admiral of England **Office of the Vice-Admiral of England ***Office of the Rear-Admiral of England *Office of the Lord High Admiral of Great Britain **Office of the Vice-Admiral of Great Britain ***Office of the Rear-Admiral of Great Britain ====Civil administration of the Navy==== =====Board of Admiralty===== The Board of Admiralty and the Lord's Commissioners executing the office of the Lord High Admiral *the Board of Admiralty **Private Office of the First Lord of the Admiralty, and member of the English government to 1706, member of the British government (1707\u20131801). ***Office of Private Secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty ***Office of the Clerk of the Admiralty ***Office of the Admiralty Clerk of the Journals appointed,(1638 - 1741). ****Messenger of the Admiralty, appointed, 1687. ****Housekeeper of the Admiralty appointed, (1687 - 1799) ****Doorkeeper of the Admiralty, 1687. ****Gardner of the Admiralty appointed (1687 - 1799) ****Office of the Translator to the Admiralty, (1755 - 1869) Civil Commissioner **First Secretary to the Admiralty (1652 - present) ***Office of the Chief Clerk of the Admiralty, appointed, (1694 - 1870). **Deputy Secretary to the Admiralty (1728 - 41), (1744 - 6), (1756 - 9), (1764 - 83). **Joint Secretary to the Admiralty (1741 - 1742). **Office of the Second Secretary to the Admiralty (1702 - 1766), (1759 - 1763), Naval Lords *Naval Lord Commissioners (1700 - 1762) * Senior Naval Lord from (1689 - 1860) Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty 609 commissioners served during 18th century Notes: Between 1693 and 1830 the commission always included either 1 or 2 additional naval lords accept from 1757 until 1782 when it was just the Senior Naval Lord after 1830 the Naval Lords are titled, First, Second, Third, Fourth until 1904 when they are re- syled Sea Lord.

At that time there were three such Courts, appointed by Admirals responsible for waters to the north, south and west of England. In 1483 these local courts were amalgamated into a single High Court of Admiralty, administered by the Lord High Admiral of England. ====Vice admiralty courts==== Vice-Admiral of the Coast was responsible for the defence of one of the twenty maritime counties of England, the North and South of Wales, Scotland and Ireland As a Vice-Admiral, the post holder was the chief of naval administration for his district. His responsibilities included, deciding the outcome of the Prize court (captured by pirate ships), dealing with salvage claims for wrecks, acting as a judge in relation to maritime issues.

Thus, the \"vice\" tag denoted that whilst it was a separate court, it was not equal to the \"mother\" court. In the case of the courts abroad, a right of appeal lay back to the British Admiralty Court, which further reinforced this superiority. In all respects, the court was an Imperial court rather than a local Colonial court.
