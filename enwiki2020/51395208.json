    "text": "Naked Attraction is a British television dating game show, broadcast on Channel 4. A clothed person is faced with six naked people who are initially hidden in booths. Their bodies and faces are gradually revealed through successive rounds, from the feet up. At each round, the chooser eliminates one naked person until only two are left, when the chooser also takes off their clothes to make the final choice. The chooser then decides which person they wish to go out with, and the two (or, occasionally, three) then go for a fully clothed date. The programme then presents their feedback after the date. It premiered on 25 July 2016 and is presented by Anna Richardson. In November 2016, Naked Attraction was renewed for a second series, which began airing on 29 June 2017. In February 2018, the show was renewed for a third series, which began airing on 24 August 2018. A fourth series aired the same year, a fifth in 2019, and a sixth in 2020. Numerous complaints about the programme were made by viewers to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom due to the full-frontal nudity that is featured in the programme. Ofcom chose not to investigate as there was nothing that breached their rules: the show was purely a dating show and did not contain any sexual activity, and was shown after the watershed. ==Production== Each episode can take up to twelve hours to film, although the contestant choosing a date only has to disrobe for fifteen minutes. The resultant date takes place at 9:00 am the next day. The picker has to have someone with him/her at all times to make sure they do not accidentally bump into one of the contestants, and if one of the contestants needs a toilet break, they must be escorted out by a member of staff so the picker does not see them leave their coloured booth. Contestants do not receive payment for participating, but standby contestants are given \u00a375 for being in the room. == Series overview == ==Episodes== ===Series 1 (2016)=== ===Series 2 (2017)=== ===Series 3 (2018)=== ===Series 4 (2018)=== ===Series 5 (2019)=== ===Series 6 (2020)=== ==See also== * Dating Naked * Adam Zkt.
