    "text": "Hafsa Sultan (; 1478 \u2013 March 1534) was the wife of Selim I and the first valide sultan of the Ottoman Empire as the mother of Suleiman the Magnificent. During the period between her son's enthronement in 1520 and her death in 1534, she was one of the most influential persons in the Ottoman Empire.Pietro Bragadin, Venetian Republic's ambassador in the early years of Suleiman the Magnificent's reign notes \"a very beautiful woman of 48, for whom the sultan bears great reverence and love...\" ==Origins== The traditional view holding that Hafsa Sultan was the daughter of Me\u00f1li I Giray (1445\u20131515), the khan of the Crimean Tatars for much of the period between 1466 and 1515, resting on seventeenth century western authors accounts, has been challenged in favor of a Christian slave origin based on Ottoman documentary evidence.Encyclopedia of Islam vol. IX (1997), s.v. Suleyman p.833 Several historians still follow the traditional view though, including Brian Glyn Williams. Re\u015fat Kasaba mentions the marriage between Selim I and Hafsa Sultan as the \"last marriage between an Ottoman sultan and a member of a neighboring Muslim royal family\". Esin At\u0131l, however, states that whilst some historians state that she was the daughter of Giray, others have mentioned that the Crimean princess named \"Ayse\" was another one of Selim I's wives and that \"Hafsa\" may have been of slave origin. Ilya Zaytsev claims that \"Ayshe (daughter of Mengli-Giray I)\" first married \u015eehzade Mehmed, the governor of Kefe, and that she later married his brother Selim I; consequently, her marriage into the Ottoman dynasty was one of two noted instances of wedlock between the Girays and the Ottomans (the other being the marriage of Selim I's daughter to Saadet-Giray). Alan W. Fisher, Leslie Peirce, and Feridun Emecen all see Hafsa as of slave origin and not the daughter of the Crimean Khan. * * * ==Life== The k\u00fclliye built on the orders of Hafsa Sultan in Manisa. It is part of the adjoining Sultan Mosque Having resided in the city of Manisa in western Turkey with her son, Suleiman, who administered the surrounding region between 1513 and 1520 (the town functioned as one of the traditional residences for Ottoman crown princes (\u015fehzade) in apprenticeship for future power), Hafsa Sultan initiated the Manisa's \"Mesir Festival\", a local tradition continued today. She also had a large complex built in the city consisting of a mosque known as the Sultan Mosque, a primary school, a college, and a hospice. She was also the first Ottoman imperial women who held title \"sultan\" after her given name, replacing title \"hatun\". This usage reflected the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as \"family prerogative\". Consequently, the title valide hatun (title for living mother of the reigning Ottoman sultan before 16th century) also turned into valide sultan, making Hafsa the first valide sultan. Her era signalled the shifting status of the sultan's mother and her increased share in power. She was also the first harem woman confirmed to have a kira - Strongilah.

The mausoleum was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 1884, a reconstruction effort started in the 1900s (decade) having been left discontinued, and her tomb today is much simpler than it was built originally. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1534 deaths Category:Valide sultan Category:Queen mothers Category:Wives of Ottoman Sultans Category:15th-century people of the Ottoman Empire Category:16th-century Ottoman royalty Category:Suleiman the Magnificent ",
