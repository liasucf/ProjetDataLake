    "text": "Rohan Ferguson (born 6 December 1997) is a Scottish footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Queen of the South, having previously played for Airdrieonians and Motherwell. ==Career== ===Airdrieonians=== After stepping out the pro- youth system for several years to play for local boys club Bathgate Rose, Ferguson signed with Airdrie on 15 August 2013. He originally formed part of the club's youth team before making his first team debut, aged just 17, on the last day of the 2014\u20132015 season against Dunfermline at the Excelsior Stadium. Although considered back-up to then Airdrie stopper Neil Parry in the 2015\u20132016 season, his reputation was growing and on the eve of Airdrie's Scottish Cup Fourth Round tie with Dundee United in January 2016, the Tannadice club launched a bid for the player, rejected by the Diamonds. They had a further bid rejected before another of Ferguson's former clubs, Hearts, showed interest. He spent some time on trial with then Airdrie boss Eddie Wolecki Black saying: \u201cRohan is recognised now as one of the hottest young prospects in the game. He sparkled in our recent 1\u20130 Scottish Cup defeat by Dundee United and relished the experience of training with Hearts. We will need to see what develops in the months to come.\u201d He penned a new two-year deal as Airdrie turned full-time and, with Parry no longer at the club, Ferguson blossomed after being given the nod as the 'number one' for the 2016\u20132017 campaign, even winning the League One player of the month award for November 2016.https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/14963258.airdrie-bag- awards-double-as-mark-wilson-and-rohan-ferguson-are-named-league-one-manager- and-player-of-the-month/ He completed the season with the Diamonds having played 45 matches but couldn't help his side to promotion after they lost to Alloa in the League 1 / Championship Play-offs Semi Final. ===Motherwell=== On Friday 18 August 2017, Ferguson joined Motherwell on a three-year contract, but was immediately sent back out on loan to Airdrie for the remainder of the 2017\u20132018 season. Youngsters Jake Hastie and Luke Watt were also sent to Airdrie on loan as part of the deal. He played a further 24 matches for Airdrie whilst on loan, taking his total appearances for the Diamonds to 80. Ferguson's first competitive game in Motherwell colours came in the Scottish Challenge Cup when he lined up for their Colts team against East Stirlingshire at the Falkirk Stadium. Ferguson made his first-team debut on 3 April 2019, coming on as a substitute for the injured Mark Gillespie in a 3\u20131 defeat at Aberdeen. On 19 July 2019, Ferguson moved on loan to Linfield for the 2019-20 season. Ferguson was released by Motherwell in May 2020. === Queen of the South === On 17 September 2020, Ferguson signed a one-year deal with Scottish Championship club Queen of the South. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Club ! rowspan=\"2\" | Season ! colspan=\"3\" | League ! colspan=\"2\" | National Cup ! colspan=\"2\" | League Cup ! colspan=\"2\" | Other ! colspan=\"2\" | Total |- !
