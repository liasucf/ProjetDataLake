It became a suburb out of one of the Tygerberg\u2019s original farms. ==History== On 17 October 1714, the Governor of the Cape Colony award the farm Blommesteijn to Theuns Dirksz van Schalkwyk. Van Schalkwyk was a Dutch immigrant. In September 1732, the farm was granted to van Schalkwyk\u2019s daughter Anna Dirksz Brommert (Nee van Schalkwyk). At the same time Anna also received Door de Kraal farm, which previously belonged to Tryntje Theuinisse. These two farms became one and was known as Door de Kraal. Johan Albrecht Dell was the new owner in 1814. Cornelis Valkenburg de Villiers bought the farm in 1866, and his son JH de Villiers inherited it in 1899. He divided the farm in four parts; one part remained Door de Kraal, one part he sold to Hume Pipe Company (This company mined clay in Bellville's Quarry), one part he gave his son JJH de Villiers (it was called de Bron) and the fourth part to PHT de Villiers (it was called Witboom). PHT de Villiers sold Witboom for residential development in 1948. It then became Kenridge. (PHT de Villiers part was the old Blommesteijn farm).Book: Durbanville-Drie eue van Wellewendheid (Translated: Durbanville three centuries of good life) Stimie, C.M, Marianne Moore Communications 2006 p6, 9,88 and 140 ==Municipal dispute== In 1969, a dispute arose between the municipalities of Bellville and Durbanville, as to under whose jurisdiction Kenridge fell.
