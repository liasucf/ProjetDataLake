He had four siblings: Lisa (born 1960), Cheryl (born 1961), Brian (born 1963), and Heather (born 1970). ==Career== John performed Muppet character Sweetums starting in 1992 following the death of Richard Hunt (who trained John Henson in performing Sweetums). The role has since been passed to different puppeteers, including David Rudman, Noel MacNeal, Rob Mills and Matt Vogel. Vogel officially assumed the role in 2009. In addition to his work with the Jim Henson Company, John produced independent films, worked as a production designer, animator, writer, wood worker, artist and builder. Zelda Catwoman of Queens, a short film he co-wrote and produced with long time collaborator and childhood friend filmmaker Alex Halpern, won the student Academy Award in the experimental division, just prior to his father's death in 1990. ==Death== Henson died of a heart attack on February 14, 2014, at age 48, at his home in Saugerties, New York. His family had a private funeral for him. He was cremated and his ashes were given to his family.Muppets' John Paul Henson dies at 48 ==Filmography== ===Television=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Title !
