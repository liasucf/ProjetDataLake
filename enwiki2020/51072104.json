    "text": "Serena Williams was the two-time defending champion, but withdrew before the tournament began due to injury. Angelique Kerber was in contention for the world No. 1 ranking, which she would have attained had she won the title. However, by losing in the final she remained No. 2. Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 won her sixth WTA singles title, defeating Kerber in the final, 6\u20133, 6\u20131. The two would play each other three weeks later, in the final of the US Open. Having already claimed the No. 1 ranking following Williams' defeat in the semifinals, Kerber avenged her loss by beating Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 in three sets. ==Seeds== All seeds received a bye into the second round. ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ==Qualifying== ===Seeds=== ===Qualifiers=== ===Lucky losers=== ===Qualifying draw=== ====First qualifier==== ====Second qualifier==== ====Third qualifier==== ====Fourth qualifier==== ====Fifth qualifier==== ====Sixth qualifier==== ====Seventh qualifier==== ====Eighth qualifier==== ====Ninth qualifier==== ====Tenth qualifier==== ====Eleventh qualifier==== ====Twelfth qualifier==== ==References== * *Qualifying Draw ==External links== Western and Southern Open Category:2016 Western & Southern Open ",
