    "text": "Marrisa Shen () was a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl whose body was found in a wooded area in Central Park in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada on July 19, 2017. Shen had been reported missing by her parents a day earlier when she failed to return home. The police used the GPS device in her mobile phone to locate her body in the public park. The RCMP said the attack appeared to be random. After Shen's death, RCMP told parents to talk to their kids about safety and warned the public to be vigilant. Days later, the police said that based on its investigations, the case would be considered a homicide. At its peak, nearly three hundred officers were involved in the investigation. Some \"2,000 persons of interest\" were investigated and were ruled out in the case. There was little progress in the case for more than a year and on the one-year anniversary of Shen's death, her family issued a letter asking the public's assistance in locating and bringing her attacker to justice.marrisashen.org: One year anniversary of the homicide of Marrisa Shen == Suspect == In a breakthrough in the case, and after a 14-month impasse from the date of the murder, on September 7, 2018, the Canadian police arrested Ibrahim Ali (born in 1990 in Syria) as a primary suspect for the murder of Marrisa Shen. Police had used a DNA dragnet technique to identify the suspect. On September 10, 2018, RCMP's integrated homicide investigation team (IHIT) gave details of his alleged involvement in a press conference saying Ali was arrested on September 7, 2018. Ali had arrived in Canada as a refugee from Syria in April 2017 just months before her murder, police say. He has been charged with first-degree murder of Shen. Now a permanent resident of Canada, police say he had no previous criminal history. He briefly appeared in court on September 14, with trial set on October 12, 2018. Ali's status as a recent Syrian refugee raised questions about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's immigration policy. Ali's court appearances were picketed by protesters calling for \"comprehensive security screening\" for immigrants and to \"hold Trudeau accountable\". The discussion surrounding the killing became a major point of contention during the February 2019 federal by-election for Burnaby South. A spokesperson for Marrisa Shen's mother communicated that while she appreciates the attention given to Marrisa's murder, she does not want the case to become political \u2014 instead, \"they should focus on the violence against women and children in our society, especially women of colour.\" == References == == External links == * Marrisa Shen website (Archived on September 11, 2018) * Marrisa Shen murder protest outside Vancouver court house at 222 Main Street (June 4, 2019) Category:2010s murders in Canada Category:2017 crimes in Canada Category:2017 in British Columbia Category:2017 deaths Category:July 2017 crimes Category:July 2017 events in Canada Category:Child deaths Category:Deaths by person in North America Category:Canadian murder victims Category:Burnaby Category:Female murder victims ",
