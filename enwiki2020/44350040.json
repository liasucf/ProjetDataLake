    "text": "Charles Reed (later Charles Verelst) (1814 \u2013 13 December 1859) was an English architect. He practised in Birkenhead, which was then in Cheshire and later in Merseyside. Reed was an illegitimate son of Arthur Charles Verelst (1779\u20131843). He was brought up by an uncle. When his father's brother William Verelst (1784\u20131851) died, Reed inherited the estate at Aston Hall, Yorkshire, and changed his surname to Verelst. During the 1840s and 1850s he worked for Sir William Jackson in laying out a housing estate in Claughton, and designing villas within that development. Two roads in the estate, Charlesville and Reedville, are named after him. In 1852\u201354 he was president of the Liverpool Architectural Society. In addition to designing buildings locally, Reed also carried out works further afield, including in North Wales, the Lake District, and Lytham, Lancashire. He was a commissioner of Birkenhead for many years. He died in Claughton, Birkenhead. ==See also== *List of works by Charles Reed ==References== Citations Sources * * Category:1814 births Category:1859 deaths Category:19th-century English architects Category:People from Birkenhead Category:Architects from Cheshire ",
