    "text": "Eugene Keefe Robinson (born May 28, 1963) is a former professional American football player who played free safety. He played collegiately at Colgate University. In his 16-year NFL career, Robinson played for the Seattle Seahawks from 1985 to 1995, the Green Bay Packers from 1996 to 1997, Atlanta Falcons from 1998 to 1999, and Carolina Panthers in 2000. He won Super Bowl XXXI with the Packers over the New England Patriots. ==Professional career== ===Seattle Seahawks=== After a college career at Colgate University, Robinson spent his first 11 NFL seasons with the Seahawks, being selected to the Pro Bowl twice in 1992 and 1993. Robinson is the Seahawks' 2nd all-time tackle leader and second in interceptions. ===Green Bay Packers=== After the 1995 season, Robinson signed with the Packers. That year, he recorded 55 tackles and led Green Bay with eight interceptions. After the 1996 season, the Packers went on to win Super Bowl XXXI 35\u201321, over his hometown team, the New England Patriots, earning Robinson his first and only championship ring. Then again, after the 1997 season, Robinson and the Packers went to Super Bowl XXXII, however they lost 31\u201324, to the Denver Broncos. With his team trailing 24\u201317 in the third quarter, Robinson intercepted a pass from Broncos quarterback John Elway in the end zone, preventing Denver from building a bigger lead and setting up a touchdown on Green Bay's ensuing drive to tie the game. He also recorded an interception of Steve Young that set up a touchdown in the Packers 23\u201310 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC title game two weeks prior. During Super Bowl XXXII, Robinson not only declared to his teammates that the Broncos were like the Colts (the worst team in football that year, but who defeated the Packers 41\u201338 in week 12), but also declared, \"This team is not better than us; they're not even good!\" ===Atlanta Falcons=== After the 1997 season, Robinson joined the Atlanta Falcons in 1998. During the season, Robinson recorded 46 tackles, two fumble recoveries, four interceptions, and one touchdown return, earning his third career Pro Bowl selection. After making a game-saving play in the NFC Championship game (breaking up an otherwise certain winning touchdown to Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss) Robinson made it back to the Super Bowl (the Falcons' first appearance ever) for the third year in a row, and again faced the Broncos. The night prior to Super Bowl XXXIII, Robinson was arrested by an undercover police officer for soliciting a prostitute. Earlier that day, Robinson received the Athletes in Action/Bart Starr Award, given annually to a player who best exemplifies outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community. After the arrest, Robinson agreed to return the award. The next day, without much sleep the night before due to the prostitution incident, Robinson gave up an 80-yard touchdown reception to Broncos receiver Rod Smith, giving the Broncos a 17\u20133 lead over the Falcons. Later, in the fourth quarter, he missed a tackle on Denver running back Terrell Davis that enabled Davis to break a long run to the Atlanta 10-yard line. The Atlanta Falcons ended up losing the game, 34\u201319, and Robinson was widely denounced by the press and fans for the previous night's incident. The next season was Robinson's last with the Falcons. ===Carolina Panthers=== After leaving the Falcons, Robinson joined the Carolina Panthers, and retired following the 2000 season. ===Career summary=== In his 16 seasons, Robinson recorded 1,415 tackles, 57 interceptions, 762 return yards, 22 fumble recoveries, 71 return yards, and two touchdowns (one fumble return, one interception return), and 7.5 sacks. His 57 interceptions have been exceeded by just 11 players, four of whom are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ==Coaching and broadcasting career== Robinson served as a color analyst for the Carolina Panthers Radio Network from 2002-18. He currently serves as a varsity football and wrestling coach at Charlotte Christian School in Charlotte, North Carolina. Beginning in January 2015, Robinson is a co-host of the morning television show Charlotte Today on WCNC-TV, Charlotte, NC. ==Personal life== Robinson is a Christian. ==References== ==External links== * Stats at Database football Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:American football safeties Category:Atlanta Falcons players Category:Carolina Panthers broadcasters Category:Carolina Panthers players Category:Colgate Raiders football players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:High school football coaches in North Carolina Category:High school wrestling coaches in the United States Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:National Football League announcers Category:Players of American football from Connecticut Category:Seattle Seahawks players Category:Sportspeople from Hartford, Connecticut Category:Super Bowl champions ",
