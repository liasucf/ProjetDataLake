    "text": "Pixter was the first portable handheld touch screen drawing toy for children invented by Rehco, LLC and marketed by Fisher Price from 2000 through 2007. Pixter was pre-programmed with fun content and repeatable play. Pixter also could accept cartridge-based games and other activities. Pixter was originally marketed successfully with a black-and-white display but later was upgraded to a color display. The Pixter line has become something of an obscurity, with little information left on the internet about the history of it, sales records, original pricing, release dates, etc. The Pixter remains, as of 2017, the second to last console Mattel has ever released, after the HyperScan. However, Pixter is Fisher Price's first and only handheld game system. ==Gameplay== The original Pixter had a black and white LCD display. Its touch- sensitive LCD screen was activated by a drawing stylus. It used 4 AA batteries. ==Models== ===Pixter=== (2000-2002) The original Pixter came in several colors. Otherwise, they are the same unit. * Purple * Green * Blue ===Pixter Plus=== (2002) Similar to the original Pixter, except with a \"Plus\" subcategory of additional activities in the Pixter's main menu. It also has a flexible screen light. ===Pixter 2.0=== (2003) Played the same cartridges as the original, but included digital drawing and quick-paint tools, as well as a wireless link. The wireless link could be used to send messages and pictures between other Pixter 2.0's. It used 4 AA batteries. ===Pixter Color=== (2003-2005) Eventually, Fisher Price made the Pixter Color. Pixter Color is extremely similar to the original Pixter, but as the version title says, it is in color. It used newer cartridges that could not be used with the original Pixter. However, with the use of an adapter, the Pixter Color could play original Pixter titles. It used 4 AA batteries. ===Pocket Pixter=== (2004-2006) The Pocket Pixters were key-chain sized dedicated consoles that included a drawing program centered around a theme and a built-in game. They used three Button Cell (LR44) batteries. ====editions==== *Pets *Fashion *Sports *Dino *Hearts ===Pixter Multi-media system=== (2005) The Pixter Multi- Media System reportedly had 100 creative tools, games, & activities-built in, including a touch screen with stylist and had streaming video capabilities. There were also exclusive cartridges available for the system. It used 4 AA batteries. ==Games/Media released== ===Pixter, 2.0, Plus=== * Action Art * Arcade * Art Safari * Art Safari 2 * Barbie: Fashion Show * Cool Wheels * Crazy Word Factory * Dino Draw * Dinosaurs Adventure * Disney Fun * Disney's Doug * Enchanted Princess * Learning Fun * Monster Shop * Music Studio * Music Video * On the Go Games * PB&J; Otter * Rescue Heroes: Mission Masters * Rocket Power * SpongeBob SquarePants * Sports * Story Composer * Toy Designer ===Color=== * Alphabet Forest * Arcade * Arthur's Birthday * Barbie Fashion Show * Barbie Writing * Cars * Clifford the Big Red Dog * Creative Genius * Cyberchase * Dino Draw * Disney's Doug * Dora the Explorer * Global Passport * Hot Wheels * Just Grandma and Me * Math Mansion * PB&J; Otter * Pet Shop * Puzzles and Games * Rescue Heroes * Scooby-Doo! * SpongeBob * Starter Learner Game * Symphony Painter * Teen Titans * The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius * The Angry Beavers * The Fairly OddParents * Word Island * \u00a1Mucha Lucha! ===Multimedia system=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" id=\"softwarelist\" !Title !Released |- |The Best of Dora with Cartoon Creator Software | |- |The Best of Monster Jam World Finals 4 with Video Creator Software | |- |The Best of SpongeBob SquarePants with Cartoon Creator Software | |- |The Best of Winter X Games with Video Creator Software | |- |Walking with Dinosaurs with Scene Creator Software | |- |Winx Club with Scene Creator Software | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Pixter Homepage * Fisher-Price Homepage * Sell games and consoles Category:2000 video games Category:Fisher-Price Category:Handheld game consoles Category:Mattel Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Sixth-generation video game consoles ",
