    "text": "The 2020 NCAA Division I FBS football season is the 151st season of college football games in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at its highest level of competition, the Football Bowl Subdivision. It began on September 3, 2020. The season is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States; all of the Power Five conferences initially announced plans to play a fall football season beginning on August 29, but largely limiting non-conference games to reduce the extent of interstate travel. The ACC, Big 12, and SEC, as well as several other Group of Five conferences, began their seasons in September (though with some conferences delaying their start, and all \"Week 0\" kickoff games having been scratched due to the aforementioned restrictions on non-conference play), while independent Notre Dame agreed to play a full conference schedule with the ACC. In August, the Big Ten, Pac-12, MAC, Mountain West, and several independents announced that they would delay their football seasons indefinitely due to concerns regarding the pandemic, targeting the possibility of playing in spring 2021 instead. By late September, however, the four conferences had reversed their decisions and announced plans to play shortened seasons. The postseason will conclude on January 11, 2021 with the College Football Playoff National Championship at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida; this will be the seventh season of the College Football Playoff championship system. Prior to the season, the CFP announced that it would still go on with its rankings and games for teams playing in the fall, and would delay its final rankings in order to accommodate delayed championships, but not conferences that had planned to delay their seasons to the spring. ==Conference realignment== ===Membership changes=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !School !Former conference !New conference |- | UConn Huskies | The American | Independent |- |Notre Dame Fighting Irish |Independent |Atlantic Coast Conference (2020 only) |} ==Rule changes== The following playing rule changes were approved by the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel for 2020: * Players ejected for targeting will now be permitted to remain in the bench area. Previously, players ejected for targeting had to return to the locker room. * Restricting the number of players on a team wearing the same uniform number to two; such players still cannot be on the field at the same time and must play different positions. * Including the number \"0\" as a legal uniform number. * Extending the official's jurisdiction prior to kickoff from 60 to 90 minutes, requiring a coach from each team be on the field during warm-ups, and identifying each player by number. * Defensive teams are allowed to briefly have twelve players on the field to anticipate the offensive formation, however having twelve (or more) players on the field at the snap is a live- ball five-yard penalty for illegal substitution. Previously this foul was a dead-ball foul, called if the defense had twelve (or more) players on the field for at least three seconds. * Adopting as a guideline a maximum of 2 minutes for instant replay reviews. Exceptions will be allowed in \"exceptionally complicated\" or end-of-game situations. * On personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties committed by the defense during a play that results in a touchdown or after a touchdown but before the try, the offense has the option to enforce the penalty on the try, the ensuing kickoff, or on the succeeding spot (if in overtime). * If the game clock expires at the end of a half, replay determines that time was remaining, and the game situation calls for the clock to start on the referee's signal, the half ends unless the replay determines that the clock should have stopped with 3 or more seconds left. ==Other headlines== * February 18 \u2013 The NCAA announced that it was considering a proposal that would allow student-athletes in all sports a one- time waiver to transfer to a new school without having to sit out a season. This would place all NCAA sports under the same transfer rules; currently, first-time transfers are only required to sit out a season in baseball, men's and women's basketball, football, and men's ice hockey. The existing criteria for the waiver would be extended to these five sports\u2014namely, a player must receive a transfer release from his or her previous school, leave that school academically eligible, maintain academic progress at the new school, and not be under any disciplinary suspension. * February 20 \u2013 Pitt's football program has been placed on three years' probation as part of a series of violations announced by the Division I Committee on Infractions on Thursday, which also included violations from their men's basketball team and former head coach Kevin Stallings. The football infractions result from a scheme where non- coaching \"quality control\" staffers performed coaching duties. If people from outside the football program were present at practice, music would be played to alert the staffers to their presence so they could leave. Pat Narduzzi was present at a football practice these three staff members performed coaching duties and was ordered to be held out of practice for two days in August. The school received other sanctions. * February 26 \u2013 The new LA Bowl was announced on February 26, matching the Mountain West's No. 1 team against the Pac-12's No. 5. Beginning in December, the game will be held at SoFi Stadium, the new 70,240-seat home of the Los Angeles Chargers and Rams in Inglewood, California. The LA Bowl is locked in at SoFi from 2020 to 2025. == Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic == === Season preparations === Multiple universities and conferences had already cancelled their spring football games as part of the wider, nationwide suspension of organized sports and athletics due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. On March 13, the NCAA announced a suspension of all Division I on-campus and off-campus recruiting until April 15. In regards to its impact on the regular season, NCAA president Mark Emmert stated on May 8 that individual decisions on fall semester sports would likely begin to appear as early as June or around July 4. He suggested that the operation of athletics programs would depend on students being present on- campus to a degree (but not necessarily \"up and running in the full normal model\"), explaining that \"you have to treat the health and well-being of the athletes at least as much as the regular students\", but that \"this is going to be a very unusual school year, and we just have to make the best of it\". The NCAA Division I Council prohibited on-campus activities through May 31; on May 20, the Council voted to end the moratorium and allow voluntary on-campus activity in football and basketball to begin June 1, subject to new safety protocols. On June 17, the Division I Council approved a timetable for a season assumed to begin September 5, including beginning non-voluntary training activities on July 13. On June 24, USA Today reported that at least 37 FBS schools had reported positive cases of COVID-19 among student-athletes or staff since practices resumed. Amidst a spike in cases in the Southern U.S. since late-June, several state governors, including Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Georgia's Brian Kemp, and South Carolina's Henry McMaster, have warned that football season could be threatened if cases do not subside in time. On July 15, the Rose Parade was cancelled due to the pandemic. The 2021 Rose Bowl Game itself is still tentatively scheduled. The same day, the NCAA announced that FBS teams would be permitted to count two wins against FCS teams, instead of the usual one, towards bowl eligibility. On July 16, the NCAA released a series of recommendations regarding protocols for fall sports, including that all participants in \"high contact risk sports\" be tested with results within 72 hours of play. President Emmert noted, however, that the guidelines presumed that the infection rate would be \"manageable\", and that \"If there is to be college sports in the fall, we need to get a much better handle on the pandemic.\" The American Athletic Conference announced the same day that it will adhere to this protocol; commissioner Mike Aresco stated that \"with the proper quarantine and the proper canvassing of close contacts, we think at this point it would be safe to play games.\" On July 18, the SEC announced that it would still honor scholarships for players who opt out of the fall season due to safety concerns. On July 28, by request of the Football Oversight Committee, the NCAA announced that it had issued a blanket waiver to allow any team to play in \"Week 0\", in order to allow for greater scheduling flexibility amid changing conditions. In the event that conditions do not improve by the traditional timeframe of football season, the possibility of delaying the football season entirely to spring 2021 was suggested by several coaches. However, it was largely considered by them to be a last resort. Aresco commented that such a delay would likely require practices to be held over the winter indoors\u2014environments that have been shown to exacerbate spread of COVID-19. === Conference responses === All of the Power Five conferences initially announced that they would go on with their season as scheduled, but with cuts to non-conference games in order to overcome logistical concerns and reduce interstate travel. The Big Ten, Pac-12, and SEC were all limiting play to in-conference opponents only. The ACC and Big 12 would allow one non- conference game each, with the ACC restricting them to in-state opponents. The ACC also suspended the use of divisions, with the top two teams in conference play by winning percentage advancing to the ACC Championship Game. The restrictions complicated matters for FBS independents; the first four games of the BYU Cougars were all against Big Ten and Pac-12 teams, while Notre Dame lost three of its marquee games of the season\u2014including one against Wisconsin that was to be played at Lambeau Field, and traditional rivalry games against Stanford (not held for the first time since 1996) and USC (postponed for the first time since 1945 due to World War II). Notre Dame and Navy had also cancelled a planned international game in Dublin, Ireland, and tentatively rescheduled it for Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. Some FCS conferences (such as the Patriot League) have cancelled or postponed football season outright, affecting games against FBS opponents. On July 29, the ACC announced that Notre Dame (which is an ACC member in all other sports outside of football and ice hockey) would participate as a member of the conference for the 2020 season, being incorporated into its scheduling model (including 10 games against ACC opponents, expanding from six already scheduled) and being eligible to compete for the conference championship. Notre Dame will pool its media rights revenue from NBC with that of the ACC's other media rights, and be eligible to receive a share of the total revenue. Among the Group of Five conferences, Conference USA announced on August 7 that it had approved an eight-game schedule with up to four non-conference games. The next day, however, the Mid-American Conference (MAC) announced the postponement of all fall sports for the 2020 season, including football. The conference stated that it would pursue attempts to play in spring 2021. With this decision, the MAC became the first FBS conference to cancel or postpone the football season. Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher stated that \"there are simply too many unknowns to put our student-athletes into situations that are not clearly understood.\" The cancellation of non-conference games by the Power Five conferences\u2014especially the Big Ten\u2014was also expected to have a financial impact on its schools, with the Big Ten games alone expected to bring $11 million. In the wake of the decision, ESPN reported on August 9 that the commissioners of the Power Five conferences had held an emergency meeting to discuss possible options for fall sports, amid the worsening state of the pandemic in the United States. On August 10, the Mountain West Conference (MWC) followed the MAC as the second Group of Five conference to postpone fall sports indefinitely. Despite the postponement, Air Force will still contest the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy games against Navy and Army. On August 11, the Big Ten became the first Power Five conference to postpone fall sports, followed shortly thereafter by the Pac-12. The Nebraska Cornhuskers of the Big Ten disclosed an intent to attempt non-conference play in the fall, although the logistical aspects of such a move (including scheduling) and possible repercussions within the conference were unknown. Commissioner Kevin Warren confirmed that Nebraska could not do so as a member of the Big Ten. A major factor in the Big Ten's decision was cardiovascular complications from the virus, while the Pac-12 cited that rapid testing capabilities would be needed to resume play. Following the decisions, the ACC, Big 12, and SEC all issued statements affirming their intent to play as scheduled in the fall. The Big Ten's decision became politicized, with President Donald Trump having criticized closures of university campuses, and having pushed in particular for the Big Ten to play in the fall. After the decision to postpone the season, the Big Ten formed a taskforce to investigate options for a return to play. On September 16, the Big Ten approved an eight-game conference season that would begin October 24, and conclude on December 19 with cross-division matchups between each seed (with the game between the top seeds played as the Big Ten Championship Game). The conference is instituting a daily antigen testing protocol beginning September 30; PCR tests will be used to confirm positives found via antigen testing. Players who test positive on both tests will be removed from play for at least 21 days and undergo cardiac tests during this period, and will have to be cleared by a cardiologist before they can return to play. Positivity rates among participating teams and the local population will also be a factor: teams with a positivity rate above 5% or a population positivity rate above 7% will be required to halt all activity for seven days. In response to the Big Ten's reversal, Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott stated that the conference was awaiting authorization by health officials in California and Oregon to resume full-contact practices, and that it was also monitoring the air quality impact of ongoing wildfires in the western United States. The conference secured a provider for rapid testing earlier in the month. On September 24, the Pac-12 officially announced that it would allow football, basketball, and winter sports seasons to resume, with plans to play a seven-game conference season that will begin on November 6 and conclude with the Pac-12 Championship Game on December 18. The same day, the Mountain West announced that it too had approved an eight-game conference season beginning October 24. The next day, the MAC unanimously approved a six- game season beginning in November. === Impact on the postseason === On August 5, the College Football Playoff announced that it would delay the announcement of its final rankings and matchups for the 2021 Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl from December 6 to December 20, in order to accommodate conferences that had delayed their championship games to mid-December. Following the postponements of fall play by multiple conferences, the CFP announced that it would still go on as scheduled, with only the teams playing in the fall being eligible for consideration in its rankings. === Player responses === Several players from the Pac-12 announced a unity group titled #WeAreUnited to negotiate with the conference and league with specific demands in regards to the 2020 football season. Including some players willing to boycott if their ultimatum was not satisfied. Players from the Big Ten, created a similar unity which calls for increase in testing and safety protocols. Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence sparked a trend on Twitter with the hashtag, #WeWantToPlay, on August 9. Other players such as Justin Fields (Ohio State), Najee Harris (Alabama), and Chuba Hubbard (Oklahoma State), help contribute to make the hashtag No. 1 in the United States on Twitter. President Donald Trump shared Lawrence's tweet, stating \"The student-athletes have been working too hard for their season to be cancelled.\" as well using the #WeWantToPlay hashtag. Later #WeAreUnited and #WeWantToPlay merged with players across the Power 5, with the goal of creating a union. Nick Saban joins other coaches, Jim Harbaugh and Ryan Day, by joining the movement, by stating players will be safer from the virus together as a team than at home. Eight Nebraska players sued the Big Ten in late-August 2020, claiming that the conference's council did not actually vote on postponing the football season. === Teams opting out === *The newly independent UConn Huskies announced that they would opt out of the 2020 season. *The Old Dominion Monarchs of Conference USA announced that they would opt out of the 2020 season. *Independent New Mexico State Aggies announced that they would opt out of playing fall football and try to play in spring 2021. *Independent UMass Minutemen initially announced that they would opt of playing fall football and hoped to construct a season in spring 2021, but the university reversed the decision in late September and announced its intention to play beginning in mid-October. === Attendance restrictions === Some teams announced that they tentatively planned to allow spectators at their games at a percentage of normal capacity, such as the Texas Longhorns (Darrell K Royal\u2013Texas Memorial Stadium was already to have slightly reduced capacity this season due to renovations) and the North Carolina Tar Heels. In the state of New York, current health orders require all sporting events be played behind closed doors, and Governor Andrew Cuomo stated that this would apply to college sports as well. === Postponed or Cancelled games === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Games Postponed or Cancelled due to COVID-19 Pandemic !Week !Match-Up !Make-Up Date |- | rowspan=2|Week 1 |Jacksonville State at FIU |October 23, 2020 |- |Rice at Houston | |- | rowspan=4|Week 2 |SMU at TCU | |- |FIU at No. 21 UCF | |- |Marshall at East Carolina | |- |Louisiana Tech at Baylor | |- | rowspan=5|Week 3 |Charlotte at North Carolina |Cancelled |- |No. 21 BYU at No. 22 Army | |- |Houston at Baylor | |- |Florida Atlantic at Georgia Southern | |- |Central Arkansas at Arkansas State |October 10, 2020 |- | rowspan=5|Week 4 |No. 7 Notre Dame at Wake Forest |December 12, 2020 |- |Georgia State at Charlotte | |- |Tulsa at Arkansas State | |- |South Florida at Florida Atlantic | |- |North Texas at Houston | |- | rowspan=2|Week 5 |Rice at Marshall | |- |Troy at South Alabama | |- | rowspan=2|Week 6 |Florida Atlantic at Southern Miss | |- |UAB at Rice | |- | rowspan=6|Week 7 |No. 7 Oklahoma State at Baylor |December 12, 2020 |- |No. 8 Cincinnati at Tulsa |December 5, 2020 |- |LSU at No. 10 Florida |December 12, 2020 |- |Southern Miss at UTEP | |- |Vanderbilt at Missouri |December 12, 2020 |- |FIU at Charlotte | |- | rowspan=1|Week 8 | New Mexico at Colorado State | Cancelled |- |} ==Stadiums== ===Upcoming=== * The 2020 season will be the first for South Alabama at Hancock Whitney Stadium replacing Ladd\u2013Peebles Stadium. The team is scheduled to play its first game there on September 12 against Grambling State. The Senior Bowl post-season all-star game (which was played at Ladd\u2013Peebles) is also moving to the new stadium for this season's edition in January 2021. * The 2020 season will be the last season for UAB at Legion Field before moving to Protective Stadium on the grounds of the Birmingham\u2013Jefferson Convention Complex in 2021. The Blazers are scheduled to play their final game at Legion Field on November 28 against Southern Miss. * The 2020 season will be the first for UNLV at Allegiant Stadium replacing Sam Boyd Stadium. The team was scheduled to play its first game there on August 29 against California. ===Renamed=== * Georgia State renamed their stadium to Center Parc Stadium in a naming rights agreement with the Atlanta Postal Credit Union. *UCF renamed their stadium to Bounce House. Their previous naming rights deal with Charter Spectrum expired after the 2019 season. A potential naming rights deal with RoofClaim.com was vetoed by the Florida Legislature. ==Kickoff games== All kickoff games were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ===\"Week Zero\"=== The regular season was scheduled to begin on August 29 with various \"Week 0\" games, but all were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were two especially notable Week Zero games: Originally, Marshall was set to play at East Carolina, to honor the 50th anniversary of the plane crash that killed 75 people, including 37 from the Marshall University football team. The crash occurred as the Thundering Herd were returning from a game at East Carolina. Additionally, the Emerald Isle Classic at Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland was scheduled to occur during Week 0, featuring Navy versus Notre Dame. However, on June 2, 2020, the game was moved from Dublin to Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland. Eventually, the game was canceled altogether. The game would have been be the first in the history of the Navy\u2013Notre Dame football rivalry to be played at Navy's home stadium. The series will resume in 2021. ===Week 1=== The majority of FBS teams were scheduled to open the season on Labor Day weekend. However, most conferences delayed the start of their seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the ACC and Big 12 conferences are scheduled to begin play the weekend of September 12, while the SEC conference will begin conference-only play the weekend of September 26. Four neutral-site \"kickoff\" games were scheduled to be held but were also cancelled. * ~~Texas Kickoff (NRG Stadium, Houston): Baylor vs. Ole Miss~~ (Cancelled) * ~~Chick- fil-A Kickoff Games (Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta):~~ ** ~~Florida State vs. West Virginia~~ (Cancelled) ** ~~Georgia vs. Virginia~~ (Cancelled) * ~~Advocare Classic (AT &T; Stadium, Arlington): Alabama vs. USC~~ (Cancelled) ===Week 2=== * ~~Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game (Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta): Auburn vs. North Carolina~~ (Cancelled) ==Regular season Top 10 matchups== Rankings reflect the AP Poll. Rankings for Week 11 and beyond will list College Football Playoff Rankings first and AP Poll second. Teams that fail to be a top 10 team for one poll or the other will be noted. *Week 5 **No. 4 Georgia defeated No. 7 Auburn, 27\u20136 (Sanford Stadium, Athens, Georgia) *Week 6 **No. 1 Clemson defeated No. 7 Miami (FL), 42\u201317 (Memorial Stadium, Clemson, South Carolina) *Week 7 **No. 2 Alabama defeated No. 3 Georgia, 41\u201324 (Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium, Tuscaloosa, Alabama) ==Upsets== So far during the season, 16 unranked teams have defeated a ranked team. The highest-ranked teams that lost to an unranked opponent were No. 3 Oklahoma and No. 6 LSU in week 4, and No. 5 North Carolina in week 7. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Unranked teams who defeated ranked teams !Week ! colspan=\"2\" |Winning Team ! colspan=\"2\" |Losing Team |- | Week 2 |Louisiana |31 |No. 23 Iowa State |14 |- | Week 3 |Marshall |17 |No. 23 Appalachian State |7 |- | rowspan=2|Week 4 |Kansas State |38 |No. 3 Oklahoma |35 |- |Mississippi State |44 |No. 6 LSU |34 |- | rowspan=6|Week 5 |TCU |33 |No. 9 Texas |31 |- |Tulsa |34 |No. 11 UCF |26 |- |Arkansas |21 |No. 16 Mississippi State |14 |- |Iowa State |37 |No. 18 Oklahoma |30 |- |NC State |30 |No. 24 Pittsburgh |29 |- |SMU |30 |No. 25 Memphis |27 |- | rowspan=2|Week 6 |Missouri |45 |No. 17 LSU |41 |- |Oklahoma (4OT) |53 |No. 22 Texas |45 |- | rowspan=4|Week 7 |Florida State |31 |No. 5 North Carolina |28 |- |South Carolina |30 |No. 15 Auburn |22 |- |Kentucky |34 |No. 18 Tennessee |7 |- |Coastal Carolina |30 |No. 21 Louisiana |27 |- |} ==Conference standings== {| cellpadding=\"5\" |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |- |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |- |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |- |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |} ==Rankings== ==Postseason== Due to a sponsorship change, what had been the Camping World Bowl played in Florida was renamed the Cheez-It Bowl, and the former Cheez-It Bowl played in Arizona reverted its name to Cactus Bowl. Also due to a sponsorship change, what had been the Belk Bowl was renamed as the Duke's Mayo Bowl. On July 31, the Redbox Bowl was canceled by its organizers. Although the COVID-19 pandemic was cited as a justification, Levi's Stadium not renewing its agreement to host the game was an additional factor. On October 2, ESPN announced that it had cancelled the 2020 editions of the Bahamas Bowl and Hawaii Bowl due to travel restrictions related to the pandemic. Three new bowls have planned to debut during the 2020\u201321 bowl season: Myrtle Beach Bowl (Conway, South Carolina), Fenway Bowl (Boston, Massachusetts), and LA Bowl (Inglewood, California). ==Coaching changes== ===Preseason and in-season=== This is restricted to coaching changes taking place on or after May 1, 2020, and will also include any changes announced after a team's last regularly scheduled game but before its bowl game.
