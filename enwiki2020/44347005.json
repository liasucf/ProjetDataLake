(Craigflower House was built in 1860 by David Bryce who designed Fettes College and the Bank of Scotland headquarters on The Mound in Edinburgh.) The school's founder, F.G. Wailes, was educated at Malvern College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge and was Joint Headmaster at St Ninian's School, Moffat from 1913 to 1923. As of July 1946 there were reportedly 55 boys in attendance at the school. He was succeeded by John Stephens who ran the school until 1968 assisted by his wife Veronica, when Mark Reynolds succeeded. Craigflower School closed in December 1979 with two masters and most of the boys transferring to Cargilfield Preparatory School in Edinburgh. The Cargilfield school library contains two silver plaques from Craigflower, the Webster plaque and the Stewart shield for head of school.
