They included three members of Festered Vestoons and one from Toxic Avengers, by June 1990 they were named as Clowns of Decadence and had \"adopted a performance image of wearing clown makeup and silly clothes to back up their politico-protest leanings\". They toured interstate with gigs in Sydney and Melbourne. In 1993 the group issued a four-track extended play on Homegrown Artists, Kamikaze Karnival. The disc was produced by Tony Nesci and recorded at his studios. One of the tracks, \"Alien Sex Romp\", was co-written by Mark Fenech, Stephen Hards (JJ Hi-jinx/Hardsy), Matt Jonsson (Trolla Bolla Snatcha Razoo), Colin Morris, Craig Spencer (Cappo Skum-fakir/Spako Airhead) and Craig Stone. By 1994 they released a second EP, Dirty Tricks Incorporated, on Siren Records, with five tracks including \"Snake Like a Tongue\". The latter track appeared on a various artists' compilation album, Lot's: The CD (1994), which was included with Lot's Wife, a student newspaper at Monash University.. In 1995 they released Too Ugly for Airplay, a four-track EP including \"New Age Neurotic\". It was produced by Mick Wordley, Evan James and the Clowns of Decadence; and recorded at Mixmasters Studios. Clowns of a Lesser God followed in 1996, it was a full- length studio album.
