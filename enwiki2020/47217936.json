    "text": "Pitakataik (; also spelt bidagat taik and pitaka taik) is a library of Buddhist scriptures, including the Tipi\u1e6daka. ==History== The pitakataik dates to the pre-colonial era. During the Pagan Kingdom era, Anawrahta commissioned a square-shaped pitakataik that measured , built in the style of a temple with a central plinth surrounded by a corridor, located from the Tharabha Gate. Subsequent monarchs, including Kyansittha, Htilominlo, and Kyaswa, continued the tradition of building pitakataiks during their reigns, ushering in a tradition of royals and laypersons alike commissioning pitakataiks. By the First Toungoo Empire era, the pitakataik was considered a requisite edifice for a royal capital, and was built in Bayinnaung's capital of Hanthawaddy (now Bago, Myanmar). By the Konbaung dynasty, the pitakataik was one of the seven integral structures (\u1014\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1010\u100a\u103a \u101e\u1010\u1039\u1010\u100c\u102c\u1014) whose foundations had to be laid in establishing a royal capital, demonstrating its importance. A royal pitakataik was built in each of the Konbaung kingdom's royal capitals, including Amarapura, Inwa, and Mandalay. According to an contemporaneous British account in 1795, the Pitakataik at Amarapura was described as the largest library between the Danube and China. During the establishment of Mandalay as a royal capital, King Mindon Min commissioned the construction of a pitakataik at the foot of Mandalay Hill. Copies of Tipi\u1e6daka texts were relocated from the Amarapura Pitakataik and deposited at the newly constructed library in January 1864. In October 2013, the Sitagu Sayadaw announced a donation to rebuild the Mandalay Pitakataik, along with the Thudhamma Zayat and Maha Pahtan Ordination Hall, with the consultation of Tampawaddy U Win Maung. ==See also== *Pitakataik (Bagan) *Pitakataik (Mrauk U) *Pitakataik (Thaton) *Pitakataik (Mandalay) *Pitakataik (Shwebo) *Ho trai ==References== Category:Libraries in Myanmar Category:Buddhist libraries ",
