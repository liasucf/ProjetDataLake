It is located in the former city of North York, on the north- west corner of Bathurst Street and Finch Avenue West. Its capacity is 3,000 and is currently the home of North Toronto Nitros of League1 Ontario and FC Vorkuta of the Canadian Soccer League. York University's football team were former tenants of the stadium from the 1980s to 1995 until a football field was built on campus (see York Stadium). The stadium plays host to many sporting events including Canadian football, soccer, and athletics. The stadium has hosted the majority of CPSL/CSL Championship finals from 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2014. The stadium was built in June 1984, and was originally named North York Civic Stadium. It was renamed in 1988 in honour of former City of North York Councillor Esther Shiner. In 2004, the stadium was closed for refurbishment, and it reopened on September 15, 2005 with a new artificial playing surface and a running track. ==See also== * Centennial Park Stadium - City of Toronto * Varsity Stadium - University of Toronto * Lamport Stadium - City of Toronto * Monarch Park Stadium - Toronto District School Board * Metro Toronto Track and Field Centre - City of Toronto * Rosedale Field - City of Toronto * York Lions Stadium - York University ==References== Category:Soccer venues in Ontario Category:Sports venues in Toronto Category:North York Category:Athletics (track and field) venues in Ontario Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in Canada Category:North York Astros Category:FC Vorkuta Category:Sports venues completed in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in Ontario ",
