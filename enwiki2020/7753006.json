Drouet soon overcame much of this skepticism by writing poems before witnesses without her mother present. In one such test, she wrote a poem to gain admission to France's Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers.Kitten on the Keys Time Magazine Jan. 28, 1957. Drouet also studied piano and guitar. Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, Drouet toured as an author and musician. Jean Cocteau said famously of Drouet, \"Tous les enfants ont du g\u00e9nie sauf Minou Drouet\" (In English: \"All children nine years old have genius, except Minou Drouet\"Barthes, Roland (2012/1957). Mythologies, p.174. Translated from French by Richard Howard and Annette Lavers. Hill and Wang. .). Michel Attenoux named his \"Minou Drouet Stomp\", featuring Sidney Bechet, after her. After her grandmother became ill around 1966, Drouet worked as a nurse for two years before returning to public life as a singer-songwriter and children's novelist. She wrote one adult novel; its title in English translation was Donatella. Gottlieb, Robert. \"A Lost Child\", The New Yorker. 6 November 2006, pp. 70-77. Eventually, Drouet returned to her childhood home in La Guerche-de- Bretagne. She now lives with her husband Jean-Paul Le Canu and has left public life except to publish a memoir, Ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, in 1993. New Yorker critic Robert Gottlieb describes Ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 as \"reticent and skimpy,\" saying that it focuses on facts rather than subjective interpretations of Drouet's childhood. ==Bibliography== ===Works in English === *Arbre, mon ami, translator Christine Tacq.
