He was elected as a representative from La Union to the Philippine Assembly in 1910, and served in that capacity until 1912. That year, he was named a provincial fiscal for Ilocos Sur. In 1917, he was appointed city fiscal of Manila. He was later appointed as a trial court judge.Justices of the Supreme Court, p. 156 In 1927, while serving as a judge, D\u00edaz was appointed to head a commission tasked with revising the penal code of the Philippines. By 1930, his committee had finished drafting the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, which remains as the basic penal law in the Philippines. D\u00edaz was appointed to the Supreme Court by the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 20, 1933. Among his more notable opinions was in People v. Cu Unjieng, 61 Phil. 236 (1935), which was one of the more widely talked-about criminal cases of its day. D\u00edaz's service in the Court was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. The ensuing Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941 effectively prevented the Supreme Court organized under the Commonwealth government. When the Japanese reestablished the Court in 1942, none of the incumbent members of the old Court were appointed to the new tribunal headed by Jos\u00e9 Yulo. ==Death== D\u00edaz was one of two Supreme Court Justices who were executed by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Battle of Manila in 1945. On February 10, the then-paralyzed D\u00edaz and two of his sons were among 300 men herded by the Japanese army and lined up along the corner of Taft Avenue and Padre Faura in Ermita, Manila. Japanese soldiers then opened machine gun fire, killing D\u00edaz and his sons as well as scores of others.By Sword and Fire, p. 253-255 Two days later, Diaz's colleague on the Court, Antonio Villa-Real, was murdered by Japanese forces in nearby Pasay. The area where D\u00edaz was executed would later become part of the Supreme Court compound when the Court relocated to Padre Faura after the war. ==References== * * ==Notes== Category:1878 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Executed Filipino people Category:Filipino lawyers Category:Filipino judges Category:People executed by Japanese occupation forces Category:People from La Union Category:Spanish- language writers of the Philippines Category:Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from La Union Category:People executed by Japan by firing squad Category:Members of the Philippine Legislature ",
