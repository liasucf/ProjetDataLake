    "text": "Pat Mora (born January 19, 1942 in El Paso, Texas) is an American poet and author of books for adults, teens and children. Her grandparents came to El Paso from northern Mexico. A graduate of the University of Texas at El Paso, she received Honorary Doctorates from North Carolina State University and SUNY Buffalo, and is an Honorary Member of the American Library Association. A literacy advocate, in 1996, she founded Children's Day, Book Day, in Spanish, El d\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os, El d\u00eda de los libros now celebrated across the country each year on April 30. ==Career== Pat Mora taught for the El Paso Public Schools, the El Paso Community College, and the University of Texas at El Paso where she then became Assistant to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and later Assistant to the President. ===Writing=== Mora began professionally writing in the early 1980s. She has produced writing for all age groups, creating picture books, poetry and biographies. Her choice of subject matter and theme is often shaped by life on the Mexico\u2013United States border where she was born and spent much of her life. she says: \"The desert, mi madre, is my stern teacher...The Southwestern landscape has been my world, my point of reference.\" she needs help her writing highlights the human and cultural diversity of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. She writes of the rich sense of \"diversity within Mexican American experience.\" Mora celebrates diversity and is opposed to the idea of an American monoculture; therefore, she is very concerned with preserving cultural heritage: \"I write because I believe that Mexican Americans need to take their rightful place in U.S. literature. We need to be published and to be studied in schools and colleges so that the stories and ideas of our people won't quietly disappear.\" Mora is a strong advocate of bilingual literacy. Early in her career, she coined a concept she named \"bookjoy\" which describes the pleasure of reading. Mora's style of writing often incorporates code switching between English and Spanish words. As a writer, she allows a free-flow of ideas in her first draft: she doesn't question her motivation for writing and writes using \"as little conscious analysis as possible.\" She prefers to use her critical eye for editing her own work later. Mora has collaborated with her daughter, Libby Martinez, on two children's books: I Pledge Allegiance and Bravo, Chico Canta! Bravo!, for which Martinez is the illustrator. ===Children's Day, Book Day=== In the mid-nineties, Mora founded the community-based, family literacy initiative, El d\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os, El d\u00eda de los libros/Children's Day, Book Day (D\u00eda). In 1997, she received the official endorsement of REFORMA, the National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-Speaking for the project. Mora based Dia on Mexican National Children's Day festivities held since 1925. The two part celebration of D\u00eda includes a commitment to promote literacy and bookjoy, and culminates in book celebrations that unite communities. When choosing a date to kick off D\u00eda, she chose April 30 because it was the last day of National Poetry month. The first Dia took place in 1996. Children's Day, Book Day, has grown in the U.S. to include all children, languages and cultures. Mora has expressed the desire to have books, celebrations and materials for Dia to include \"all languages spoken in the United States.\" In 2004, the Association for Library Services to Children's (ALSC) division of the American Library Association became an active partner for Dia. Mora says, \"If we want our nation to be a country of readers...[we] need to work together to inspire communities in nurturing reading families.\" == Awards == Mora in 2015, along with authors Sarah Bird (left) and Carmen Lomas Garza (center) *Texas Writer Award (2015) *International Latino Book Award, Best Children's Fiction Picture Book: The Beautiful Lady: Our Lady of Guadalupe, (2013). *Loretto Legacy Award for Arts and Literature (2012). *Con Tinta Achievement for Literary Activism from Association of Writers & Writing Programs (2012) *Gelett Burgess Children's Book Award: Gracias~Thanks, (2011). *Eureka!
