    "text": "Arroz con pollo (rice with chicken) Cuban cuisine is a blend of African, Spanish, and other Caribbean cuisines. Some Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish and African cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. This results in a blend of the several different cultural influences. A small but noteworthy Chinese influence can also be accounted for, mainly in the Havana area. There is also some Italian influence. During colonial times, Cuba was an important port for trade, and many Spaniards who lived there brought their culinary traditions with them.Rodriguez, H. Cuban Food Profile: Cuban Food History ==Overview== As a result of the colonization of Cuba by Spain, one of the main influences on the cuisine is from Spain. Other culinary influences include Africa, from the Africans who were brought to Cuba as slaves, and French, from the French colonists who came to Cuba from Haiti.Rodriguez, H. \"Cuban Food Profile: Cuban Food History\" Another factor is that Cuba is an island, making seafood something that greatly influences Cuban cuisine. Another contributing factor to Cuban cuisine is that Cuba is in a tropical climate, which produces fruits and root vegetables that are used in Cuban dishes and meals.Murray, J. Cuban Cuisine, Cuba History and Their Food A typical meal consists of rice and beans, cooked together or apart. When cooked together the recipe is called \"congri\" or \"Moros\" or \"Moros y Cristianos\" (black beans and rice). If cooked separately it is called \"arroz con frijoles\" (rice with beans) or \"arroz y frijoles\" (rice and beans). ==Cuban sandwich== A typical Cuban sandwich (picture from South Florida) A Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a mixto, especially in Cuba) is a popular lunch item that grew out of the once-open flow of cigar workers between Cuba and Florida (specifically Key West and the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa) in the late 19th century and has since spread to other Cuban American communities. The sandwich is built on a base of lightly buttered Cuban bread and contains sliced roast pork, thinly sliced Serrano ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, and yellow mustard. In Tampa, Genoa salami is traditionally layered in with the other meats, probably due to influence of Italian immigrants who lived side- by-side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City. Tomatoes and lettuce are available additions in many restaurants, but these are considered by traditionalists as an unacceptable Americanization of the sandwich. After assembly, the Cuban sandwich may be pressed in a grooveless panini-type grill called a plancha, which both heats and compresses the contents. ==List of Cuban dishes and foods== Ropa vieja (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer * Arroz con leche * Arroz con maiz * Arroz con pollo * Batido * Bistec de Palomilla * Boliche * Bu\u00f1uelo * Butifarra * Camarones * Chivirico * Churros * Croqueta * Cucurucho * Dulce de leche * Empanada * Flan de calabaza * Flan de coco * Flan de guayaba * Flan de huevos * Elena Ruz * Frijoles negros * Frita * Fuf\u00fa de Pl\u00e1tano * Guayaba * Majarete * Medianoche * Mermelada * Mojo Criollo * Morcilla * Moros y Cristianos * Natilla * Papa rellena * Papitas fritas * Pasteles * Picadillo * Platano maduro frito * Pud\u00edn de pan * Pulpeta * Ropa vieja * Sandwich Cubano * Sopa de pollo * Tamale * Tortilla de patatas * Tasajo * Tostada * Tostones * Tres leches cake * Turrones * Vaca Frita * Yuca con mojo * Yuca frita ==List of Cuban drinks== Two Cuba Libres * Batido - Milkshake coming in flavors such as guanabana and trigo (wheat) * Cafe Cubano - Cuban espresso * Cuba Libre \u2013 Rum, Coca-Cola, sugar, and lime * Daiquiri - Rum, Lime, syrup (variations with fruit) * El Presidente * Guarapo \u2013 juice made from pressed sugar cane * Hatuey beer * Ironbeer * Malta (soft drink) \u2013 malt beverage * Materva * Mojito \u2013 Rum, mint, sugar, lime, and club soda * Jupina - pineapple soda * Cortadito - Cuban espresso and steamed evaporated milk * Carajillo - Cuban Espresso, Liquor 43 * Pi\u00f1a Colada - rum, pineapple, and coconut ==See also== * Caribbean cuisine * Flattop grill ==References== ==Bibliography== * Ar\u00f3stegui, Gonzalo, et al.: Manual del Cocinero Criollo, Cuba, 19th century. * Buchmann, Christine. \"Cuban Home Gardens and Their Role in Social\u2013Ecological Resilience.\" Human Ecology: An Interdisciplinary Journal 37.6 (2009): 705-721. 16 Jan. 2010. * Cancio-Bello, Carla. \"The Growing Popularity of Cuban Cuisine.\" (2012): http://www.cubancuisine.co.uk * Carris Alonso, Cynthia. \"A Taste of Cuba: A Journey Through Cuba and its Savory Cuisine.\" Apollo Publishers, 2018 *Folch, Christine. \"Fine Dining: Race in Prerevolution Cookbooks.\" Latin American Research Review 43.2 (2008): 205-223. 3 Feb. 2010. * Hunt, Nigel. \"The Agriculture History in Cuba.\" Cuba Agriculture. 2008.
