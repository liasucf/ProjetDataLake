    "text": "Thomas' cyclically symmetric attractor.In the dynamical systems theory, Thomas' cyclically symmetric attractor is a 3D strange attractor originally proposed by Ren\u00e9 Thomas. It has a simple form which is cyclically symmetric in the x,y, and z variables and can be viewed as the trajectory of a frictionally dampened particle moving in a 3D lattice of forces. The simple form has made it a popular example. It is described by the differential equations :\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sin(y)-bx :\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\sin(z)-by :\\frac{dz}{dt} = \\sin(x)-bz where b is a constant. b corresponds to how dissipative the system is, and acts as a bifurcation parameter. For b>1 the origin is the single stable equilibrium. At b=1 it undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation, splitting into two attractive fixed points. As the parameter is decreased further they undergo a Hopf bifurcation at b\\approx 0.32899, creating a stable limit cycle. The limit cycle the undergoes a period doubling cascade and becomes chaotic at b\\approx 0.208186. Beyond this the attractor expands, undergoing a series of crises (up to six separate attractors can coexist for certain values). The fractal dimension of the attractor increases towards 3. In the limit b=0 the system lacks dissipation and the trajectory ergodically wanders the entire space (with an exception for 1.67%, where it drifts parallel to one of the coordinate axes: this corresponds to quasiperiodic torii). The dynamics has been described as deterministic fractional Brownian motion, and exhibits anomalous diffusion. ==References== Category:Nonlinear systems Category:Dynamical systems Category:Chaotic maps ",
