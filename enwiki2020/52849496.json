    "text": "Matthewstown Passage Tomb is a passage tomb situated in County Waterford, Ireland. ==Location== The tomb is located 1.6 km (1 mile) north of Fenor. Most of the surrounding countryside is visible, to the Comeragh Mountains. ==History== Matthewstown Passage Tomb dates to 2500\u20132000 BC. It is locally known as Thomas McCabe's Bed; this may have been the name of a local outlaw who supposedly spent a night here: cf. the many \"Diarmuid and Gr\u00e1inne's Beds\" This is one of a group of small passage tombs in Co. Waterford with affinities to the tombs in Cornwall and the Scilly Isles, hence the name \"Scilly-Tramore group,\" suggesting that the builders were seafarers from Cornwall. ==Description== Matthewstown Passage Tomb is 4.5 m (fifteen feet) long and about 1.8 m (six feet) wide. There are two rows of five orthostats protruding above the ground to about 1 metre (three-and-a-half feet). This grave was covered by four large stone slabs. ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in County Waterford Category:Buildings and structures in County Waterford Category:National Monuments in County Waterford ",
