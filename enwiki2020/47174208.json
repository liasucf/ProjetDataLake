    "text": "Unidentified decedents are a group of people who have died but officials were unable to discover who they were when they were alive. Several victims are not identified for several years or even decades after their deaths, one case being that of Barbara Precht, who died in 2006 and was identified in 2014. Around 40,000 decedents still remain unidentified in the United States. ==Los Angeles County Does (1921\u20131951)== Retouched morgue photograph of the female victim killed in a dynamite explosion between 1921 and 1951. Two children were witnessed playing with sticks of dynamite in Los Angeles County, California between the years of 1921 and 1951. Poor record keeping resulted in the exact date of the incident being unknown; the time range was established from the thirty-year career of the particular crime scene photographer. The dynamite subsequently exploded and killed both the victims, one male and one female. Very little is known about these two victims, especially the male child, as it was impossible to create a reconstruction from his body due to the injuries he suffered. He wore dark colored loafers; dark socks; medium toned pants; possibly a dark colored long sleeved shirt. The female was in much better condition. She was most likely a teenager, though a wider possible age range is not known. Her height, weight, hair and eye color are unknown; though she most likely was Caucasian. She was wearing a light-colored long sleeved top; dark colored skirt or pants; dark colored socks with stripes at top. ==San Bernardino County John Doe (1930)== San Bernardino County John Doe, killed by a truck in 1930.

The victim had been walking alongside the road and was presumed to have been killed as soon as the vehicle collided with his body. He had hazel eyes, a beard and gray hair. His height and weight were five feet eight inches and 180 pounds, respectively. The unidentified man's fingerprints have since been obtained, but his dental records were not and his DNA was not possible to use to create a genetic profile to compare to potential matches. ==Los Angeles County Jane Doe (1968)== left An African-American female was found dead on September 30, 1968 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. The woman was estimated to be over the age of twenty five and was at a height of five feet three inches tall and weighed about 110 pounds. Her hair was black and her eyes were brown, coinciding with her race. The teeth were left in a natural condition, as no evidence of dental work was noted. Her wisdom teeth had yet to erupt. The woman wore a pullover shirt, pants, black shoes and matching socks. The colors of the pants and shirt are unknown. She may have died of a drug overdose and her body was abandoned behind a building, presumably transported from the place of death. It is believed she was seen alive immediately prior to her death, but this has not led to the discovery of her identity. == \"Leroy\" == On April 4, 1974, a young white man was found unresponsive in his hotel room by a group of coworkers in Oxnard, California.
