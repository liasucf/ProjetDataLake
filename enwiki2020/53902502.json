    "text": "Actinium fluoride (AcF3) is an inorganic compound of actinium and fluorine. == Synthesis == Actinium fluoride can be prepared in solution or by a solid-state reaction. In the first method, actinium hydroxide is treated with hydrofluoric acid and the product precipitates: :Ac(OH)3 + 3HF -> AcF_3(v) + 3H2O In the solid-state reaction, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride gas at 700 \u00b0C in a platinum crucible.Meyer, Gerd and Morss, Lester R. (1991) Synthesis of lanthanide and actinide compounds. Springer. . pp. 87\u201388 == Properties == Actinium fluoride is a white solid that reacts with ammonia at 900\u20131000 \u00b0C to yield an actinium oxyfluoride: :AcF3 + 2NH3 + H2O -> AcOF + 2NH4F While lanthanum oxyfluoride is easily formed by heating lanthanum fluoride in air, a similar treatment merely melts actinium fluoride and does not yield AcOF. ==References== Category:Actinium compounds Category:Fluorides Category:Metal halides ",
