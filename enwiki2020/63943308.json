    "text": "Philippines's 6th senatorial district, officially the Sixth Senatorial District of the Philippine Islands (), was one of the twelve senatorial districts of the Philippines in existence between 1916 and 1935. It elected two members to the Senate of the Philippines, the upper chamber of the bicameral Philippine Legislature under the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands for each of the 4th to 10th legislatures. The district was created under the 1916 Jones Law from the southern Luzon provinces of Albay, Ambos Camarines and Sorsogon. Ambos Camarines was split into the provinces of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur in 1919, and Masbate was added in 1920 upon its re-establishment as a regular province separate from Sorsogon. The district was represented by a total of seven senators throughout its existence. It was abolished in 1935 when a unicameral National Assembly was installed under a new constitution following the passage of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act which established the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Since the 1941 elections when the Senate was restored after a constitutional plebiscite, all twenty-four members of the upper house have been elected countrywide at-large. It was last represented by Jos\u00e9 O. Vera of the Nacionalista Dem\u00f3crata Pro-Independencia and Domingo Imperial of the Nacionalista Democr\u00e1tico. ==List of senators== {| class=wikitable |- ! colspan=7 | Seat A | rowspan=99 | ! rowspan=3 | Legislature | rowspan=99 | ! colspan=7 | Seat B |- style=\"height:3em\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history |- !Start!!End !Start!!End |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Leoncio Imperial | rowspan=\"2\" | October 16, 1916 | rowspan=\"2\" | June 6, 1922 | rowspan=\"2\" | Nacionalista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1916. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4th | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 1 | style=\"background:;\" | | Mario Guari\u00f1a | October 16, 1916 | June 3, 1919 | Nacionalista | Elected in 1916. |- | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 5th | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2 | style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Vicente de Vera | rowspan=\"2\" | June 3, 1919 | rowspan=\"2\" | June 2, 1925 | Nacionalista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1919. |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#0000FF| | rowspan=\"2\" | Juan B.
