    "text": "Robbin' the Hood is the second album by the Southern California ska punk band Sublime, which was released in 1994. It is noted for its experimental nature, low production values, and numerous samples and interpolations of other artists. ==Music and background== Robbin' the Hood is notable for having low production values (the album sleeve boasts of its \"13 self produced 4-track home recordings\"), as well as including multiple samples and lyrics from other artists. The album also features 'Raleigh Soliloquies,' selections from a rant recorded by a man with schizophrenia named Raleigh Theodore Sakers. == Follow up == Some of the songs on the album contain parts that were later reused by the band on other albums. For example, the principle chord progression in the instrumental \"Lincoln Highway Dub\" was featured again in the band's later hit \"Santeria\", and elements of \"Work That We Do\" would later appear in \"Under My Voodoo\". Incidentally, it was during the recording of Robbin' the Hood, that the band recorded demos of \"What I Got\" and \"Garden Grove.\" == Influences and covers == Gwen Stefani, of No Doubt, contributes guest vocals on the track \"Saw Red\", notably before either Sublime or No Doubt enjoyed mainstream success. Many of Sublime's melodies and riffs have not only been influenced by, but directly taken from, other reggae artists and bands. \"Steppin' Razor\", originally written by Joe Higgs, was covered by The Wailers and later popularized by Peter Tosh in his solo career. In \"Greatest Hits\", Nowell mentions The Ziggens, their \"brother\" band signed to the same label. The guitar riff and associated rhythm in the song was borrowed from Yellowman. Boss D.J. is partially a cover of a song by British reggae band Aswad, \"Roots Rocking\". The Free Loop Dub borrows melody from the song \"Loaded\" by Scottish alternative rock band Primal Scream. \"STP\"s lyrics \"Baby you wanna give me kisses ... but a taste of honey is worse than none at all\" are borrowed from \"I Second That Emotion\".http://sublimestp.com/?page=pages/robbinwis A number of other bands are either mentioned explicitly, alluded to, or sampled including: Steady B, Barrington Levy, Geto Boys, The Doors, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bob Marley, Flavor Flav, Just-Ice, Beastie Boys and Jack Owens. == Reception == Pitchfork magazine, reviewing Sublime's debut album 40oz. to Freedom and legacy in 2018, made a brief acerbic mention of Robbin' the Hood, offering that Robbin' the Hood, \"was so haphazard and caustic that only the most devoted fan could tolerate any significant time with it (it was recorded in a crack house, and it sounded like it).https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sublime-40oz-to-freedom/. Sputnikmusic gives a more generous review with 4.5/5 stars, reviewing in 2008 and noting the prescience of front man Bradley Nowell's lyrics, \"the messages within Robbin\u2019 the Hood leave timeless impressions. They preach real-life problems and solutions, and Bradley\u2019s Nowell\u2019s lyrics were far ahead of his time,\" a nod mostly to Nowell's prediction that one day his substance abuse problems would prove fatal (\"one day I\u2019m gonna lose the war...\u201d). The article praises the album's ability to mix its eclectic influences, all the while, \"there isn\u2019t one noticeable mistake anywhere on the album\". The article conjectures that odd inclusion of the Soliloquies was for the sake of conveying the ethos of the band, \"they really explain what Sublime was all about...fun.\"https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/15445/Sublime-Robbin-the- Hood/ An irregularly run column in Red Bull Music Academy called The Weird One called it a \"heady, offbeat musical collage\" and noted that the album broke a number of conventions about musical albums, \"...not only does away with allegiances to genre, but also traditional album structure and form.\"http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2017/07/the-weird-one-sublime- robbin-the-hood The article calls the album a \"coherently incoherent\" \"mess\", praising the earnestness and charm of the album as a \"great mixtape\", devoid of \"self-consciousness\". == Track listing == All songs written by Sublime unless otherwise noted # \"Waiting for Bud\" \u2013 1:02 # \"Steady B Loop Dub\" \u2013 1:23 (Contains samples of \"Badfish\",and \"Bring the Beat Back\" by Steady B.
