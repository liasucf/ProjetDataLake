RPGFan review illustrated this mixed sentiment, asserting that while the developers accurately recreated the feel of classic JRPGs, this mean they recreated much of the good and the bad parts of the genre, stating that \"Although it clearly has its flaws, I enjoyed the roughly 40 hours I spent with it all the same...Semisoft wished to create a \"love letter\" to JRPGs, and perhaps it did that in a most unintentional way. Legrand Legacy manages to capture much of the indelible charm of the JRPGs to which it pays homage through its rough-around-the-edges execution.\"http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Legrand_Legacy_Tale_of_the_Fatebounds/index.html ==References== ==External links== * Category:Role-playing video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in Indonesia Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:2018 video games Category:Single-player video games ",
