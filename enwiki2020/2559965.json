    "text": "Homebase is the fourth studio album released by hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. The album was released on July 23, 1991, reaching #12 on the Billboard 200 charts and #5 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop albums chart. It received generally favorable reviews from critics. The album was certified Platinum and won an American Music Award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album in 1992. ==Album information== The second track on the album, \"Summertime\", earned the duo a second Grammy Award for Best Single in early 1992. Will Smith admitted that he tried to make his voice sound deeper than usual for this album, as many fans enjoyed the track \"Then She Bit Me\" from the duo's previous album, And in This Corner..., which was sung in this style. \"You Saw My Blinker\" is one of only two instances in which Smith uses obscenities in his music. However, the song reached #20 Billboard Hot 100 and #22 Hot R&B;/Hip Hop singles. Four singles were released from the album: \"Summertime\", \"The Things That U Do\", \"Ring My Bell\" and \"You Saw My Blinker\". ==Track listing== ==Singles== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Single ! cowspan=\"3\"| Chart positions |- style=\"font- size:smaller;\" ! width=\"40\"| US Pop ! width=\"40\"| Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs |- | rowspan=\"2\"|1991 | align=\"left\"| Summertime | 4 | 1 |- | align=\"left\"| Ring My Bell | 20 | 22 |- | rowspan-\"1\"|1992 | align=\"left\"| The Things That U Do | \u2014 | 43 |- |} ==Charts== === Chart positions === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
