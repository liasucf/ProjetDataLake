The stories told by N\u00e4tti made him a legendary figure, particularly in Lapland. N\u00e4tti was born to a six-member family in Karstula, Central Finland, in August 1890. His parents were log driver Juho N\u00e4tti and hostess Maija N\u00e4tti. He had three sisters. N\u00e4tti migrated with other members of his family to the Northern logging sites, and worked there for most of his life. He was a well-known lumberjack who was known in Tervola, Pisa, Muurola and Rovaniemi. ==Life== N\u00e4tti was also a known clubfoot: his left leg foot had turned back. N\u00e4tti was paralyzed from the mid-1950s and was admitted to the Rautiosaari nursing home, part of the Department of the Rural Municipality of Rovaniemi. N\u00e4tti died in the forestry worker's home on August 4, 1964. He was buried in the cemetery of Rovaniemi in a common burial place. N\u00e4tti got his own tomb marked in the Rovaniemi Viirinkangas cemetery in the summer of 2006; unveiling took place on 25 August 2006. ==N\u00e4tti-Jussi name used for other purposes== In the late 1990s the N\u00e4tti room Muurola restaurant was established in former rural municipality of Rovaniemi.
