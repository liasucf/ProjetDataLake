The old church was in a poor state of repair and neglect when the Robertsons acquired the estate and was rebuilt in 1832. Unfortunately the handsome Gothic spire was struck by lightning some four years later, demolishing half of the spire and breaking all the glass windows. The remaining spire was then removed and the church rebuilt yet again at a cost of \u00a310,000 in the period 1888-1895. This involved considerable financial help from the Robertson (Robinson) family. A tower replaced the spire and has three bells. The churchyard is ornamentally planted with evergreens.White's Directory of Nottinghamshire 1853White's Directory of Nottinghamshire 1853 During the civil war two soldiers that were killed at the Battle of Willoughby Fields nearby were buried in the graveyard.
