Her parents died when she was two years old. Following the death of her parents, Savage and her siblings went to live with her aunt, who moved the family to New Jersey. At age 10, Savage met First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt when she was selected to hand the First Lady flowers on behalf of the New Jersey State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs. Although told not to say anything, Savage thanked Roosevelt which led to the two becoming pen pals for the remainder of Roosevelt's life. At 12 years old, she joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). ==Civil rights leader== At only 13 years old, Savage helped to integrate the Capital Theater in Trenton, New Jersey, when she refused to sit in the balcony, which was the designated seating area for blacks. Savage's first job was in the sheriff's office, where she continued to speak out against discrimination. In 1957, while Savage was raising funds for King's Southern Leadership Conference, she was introduced to civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, became Savage's close friends. After Martin's death, Savage worked with Coretta to found the King Center. In 1964, Savage and then first lady of New Jersey Helen Meyner went on a presidential mission to integrate a school in Mississippi. Savage and Meyner met with local women in an effort to convince the locals to allow for the school to be integrated peacefully. Later that same year, she organized the New Jersey Democratic Coalition. In 2017, she was a keynote speaker at the Women's March in Trenton. ==Other activities== Savage was the coordinator of the Mid-Atlantic States Poor People's Campaign of SCLC in 1968.
