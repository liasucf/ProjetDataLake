In 2013, unlike other Island class cutters, she was not commanded by a commissioned officer, she was commanded by a Chief Warrant Officer. In 2013 the Sapelo seized a shipment of 1.3 tons of cocaine, estimated to be worth $34 million United States dollars. In June 2015, the Homer News reported that a sister ship of Sapelo, Roanoke Island, stationed in Homer, Alaska, was being retired. They reported that, since the Sapelo had been replaced by a new Sentinel class cutter, she would be brought to Homer to replace Roanoke Island. The previous crew of Roanoke Island would then cross- deck to Sapelo in a crew swap. ==Design== The Island-class patrol boats were constructed in Bollinger Shipyards, Lockport, Louisiana.

Its hull is constructed from highly strong steel, and the superstructure and major deck are constructed from aluminium. The Island-class patrol boats have maximum sustained speeds of . It is fitted with one machine gun and two M60 light machine guns; it may also be fitted with two Browning .50 Caliber Machine Guns.
