    "text": "Piekenierskloof Pass is a mountain pass that is part of the N7 national road, running south of Citrusdal in the mountains west of the Olifants River in Western Cape, South Africa. The name comes from the pikemen (lancers equipped with pikes) posted in the area by the Dutch East India Company to protect farmers from Khoikhoi raids. Thomas Charles John Bain built the first pass there in 1857, whence it was named Grey's Pass until 1960, when it gained its current moniker. The pass peaks at 519 m above sea level and has a maximum grade of 1:16. == See also == * List of mountain passes of South Africa == Sources == * Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa, vol 8.
