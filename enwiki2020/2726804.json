    "text": "The Vendicatori, or Avengers, were a secret society of rebel-vigilantes formed about 1186 in Sicily to avenge popular wrongs. The society was finally suppressed by William II of Sicily (1155-1189), who hanged the grand master and branded the members with hot irons. The vindicosi, or vindicators, are described as a historical sect by Francesco Maria Emanuele Gaetani Villabianca (1720\u20131802) in his Diari palermitani (Palermo diaries). According to this author, they may date back to 1185. ==See also== * Beati Paoli ==References== Attribution: * ==Further reading== * Cities of the Underworld: Real Mafia Underground History Channel documentary on the proto-Mafia Avengers and their catacomb networks in Palermo and Sicily Category:Medieval Sicily Category:History of the Sicilian Mafia Category:Secret societies related to organized crime Category:Vigilantes ",
