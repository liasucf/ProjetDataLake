Native Sons compete in the Can-Am League, sanctioned by First Nations Lacrosse Association. Native Sons Junior affiliate are the Seneca WarChiefs of First Nations Junior B Lacrosse League. ==History== Formed in 2015, Native Sons were welcomed to the league by losing four of their first five games. The remaining portion of their Can-Am season was another story as the Sons finished 11\u20135 (third place) in their first season. Native Sons swept the opening round series against Pinewoods Smoke then eliminating Newtown Golden Eagles in three-straight. Their season would come to an end in the finals losing to Onondaga Redhawks in five games. Year two saw the Native Sons finish just one point of the regular season championship with a record of 11\u20131\u20131. They would cruise through the opening two rounds eliminating Tonawanda Braves in two straight before eliminating Pinewoods Smoke in four games. The Can-Am finals would be a rematch against Onondaga, which Native Sons would avenge their loss of the previous season defeating the Redhawks in a four-game sweep. That earned the Native Sons a berth to the President's Cup. Native Sons would go 2\u20131 in Pool play and earn a spot in the President's Cup quarterfinals where they would defeat Calgary Mountaineers. A semi-final loss to St. Albert Miners would send the Sons to the Bronze Medal game where they were defeated by Brooklin Merchants. ==Season-by-season== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Season !W !L !T !Pts !Result !Playoff Result !W !L |- |2015 |11 |5 |0 |22 |3rd of 9 |Lost Finals vs Onondaga Redhawks |6 |4 |- |2016 |11 |1 |1 |23 |2nd of 9 |Won League |9 |1 |} ==References== ==External links== * Twitter * Cattaraugus Community Center website * Can-Am Lacrosse League website Category:Lacrosse of the Iroquois Confederacy Category:Lacrosse teams in New York (state) Category:2015 establishments in New York (state) Category:Lacrosse clubs established in 2015 Category:Chautauqua County, New York ",
