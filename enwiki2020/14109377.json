That year they approached the Isle of Man's Department of Education with their request. The school opened in September 2001. At the time it had one class and shared premises at Ballacottier School in Douglas. In January 2003 it moved to its own building in the old St John's School.\"History of The Bunscoill Ghaelgagh\" , Isle of Man Schools, August 2007. Accessed 4 January 2006 The school won the annual Reih Bleeaney Vanannan award in January 2006 for its efforts in preserving and promoting Manx language, culture and heritage. It was presented by the then Speaker of the House of Keys, James \"Tony\" Brown, chairman of the Manx Heritage Foundation.\"Honour for History-Making School\" , Isle of Man Today, 26 January 2006 ===Enrolment=== Numbers continued to increase, from nine in 2001 when the school moved to its current premisesOgmios 46 Foundation for Endangered Languages (Dec 2001) to 47 in 2006, then to 65 in 2009\"It's a good time to learn Manx Gaelic\" Eoin \u00d3 Conch\u00fair, Learn Irish Gaelic, 17 November 2009 and 69 in 2012. Manx School celebrates ==Manx language== The school is considered successful and is part of the Manx language revival.\"Isle's Gaelic heritage celebrated\", BBC News, 4 November 2005\"Islanders celebrate Manx language\", BBC News, 31 October 2005 After UNESCO listed the language as extinct in 2009, pupils wrote letters asking \"If our language is extinct then what language are we writing in?\", and the classification was later changed to \"critically endangered\".Sarah Whitehead, \"How the Manx language came back from the dead\", The Guardian, 2 April 2015 Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (Ealish ayns \u00c7heer ny Yindyssyn) is read in translation after 30 copies were presented to the by the Manx Gaelic Society when the book was officially launched.\"Manx Translation Is Wonder To Behold\" , Isle of Man Today, 22 December 2006 The school itself refers to studies that have been made in Finland that demonstrate advantages from bilingual education. Researcher Aini- Kristiina J\u00e4ppinen examined the achievement of 334 pupils in 12 schools on 'content and language-integrated learning' programmes and compared them with 334 pupils studying only in Finnish. She concluded that a foreign language adds to the learning process and seems to improve results.Results look better in English, Times Education Supplement, 9 January 2004 According to J\u00e4ppinen, \"When pupils have to conceptualise and grasp issues in a foreign language as well as their mother tongue, it will help develop an ability to understand complex and multifaceted relationships between various themes.\" The Finnish research used pupils who were studying three different languages (French, Swedish and English) and found that \"the choice of (Second) language did not seem to have a major impact on performance\" in a number of subjects including maths and geography. As the school notes, this conclusion is not universal to other previous studies. Studies at Luton University have shown that there can be a \"trivial\" delay in language development but the overall benefits in the long run outweigh this temporary disadvantage.\"Two languages are better than one\", The Guardian, 3 March 2004 ==See also== * Bilingual education * Gaelic medium education - Scottish Gaelic medium education * Gaelscoil - Irish medium education * Language nest ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:Schools in the Isle of Man Category:Educational institutions established in 2001 Category:Manx language Category:Celtic medium education Category:Minority schools ",
