Situated on the Weiti River immediately south of the Whangaparaoa Peninsula in the Rodney District, it is part of the area known as the Hibiscus Coast. ==History of Stillwater== In the early 19th century Silverdale was established as a port for transporting kauri logs to Auckland. Stillwater was also used as a secondary landing to transport logs, kauri gum and later fruit produce from orchards established on cleared land at Stillwater, Silverdale and Dairy Flat. As there was no roading sea was the only form of transport available. The last shipment of kauri gum to leave Stillwater was in 1890. The pack horse tracks from Dairy Flat are still clearly visible on the Weiti Station property. The first settler in Stillwater in 1852 was Andrew Weatherspoon Thorburn and his family. Part of his original holding is now a reserve and memorial park bequeathed on their farm. Several houses were built on the river's edge in the early days as more land was cleared and made available for farming. Some live stock was introduced, but fruit from orchards seemed to be the major produce transported to Auckland from Stillwater. Other early settlers included the Dacres, Percy, Blackshaw and McPike brothers families. In 1950 the McPike brothers subdivided their farm to form what has become the Stillwater settlement known today. After the Second World War the motor camp was developed and a road from East Coast Road constructed. Prior to this there existed only a farm track to Stillwater with a ford crossing at Doctor's Creek. The original bridge built was gradually improved over the years to the two lane concrete bridge today. In 1980 the Council began tar- sealing the road. In 1985 Stillwater was connected to the Whangaparaoa sewerage system and more substantial houses were built in the area. By the year 2000, most of the power and telephone cables were put underground and footpaths formed the length of Stillwater Crescent. Houses were built on almost all the original sections developed and Stillwater could no longer be called a holiday resort; it had become a well established marine suburb. In time Coastal Heights was developed followed by the adjoining Inlet Views property and new coastal development is taking place over the river opposite the Stillwater Boat Club. Buildings continue to appear as land is cleared. ==References== ==External links== * Photographs of Stillwater held in Auckland Libraries' heritage collections.
