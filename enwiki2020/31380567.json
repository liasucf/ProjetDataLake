This off-year election featured several special elections to the United States Congress; two gubernatorial races; state legislative elections in a few states; and numerous citizen initiatives, mayoral races, and a variety of other local offices on the ballot. The Democrats picked up the governorship in Virginia as Terry McAuliffe was elected to replace term-limited Republican Bob McDonnell. Meanwhile, Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was re- elected to a second term. Congressional special elections were held throughout the year. In total, two Senate seats and six House seats were contested. None of the House seats changed party hands as well as the Massachusetts senate seat. Democrats however regained the senate seat in New Jersey which was held by a Republican appointee. == United States Senate== ===Massachusetts=== On December 21, 2012, President Barack Obama nominated Massachusetts U.S. Senator John Kerry as Secretary of State. Kerry was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 29, 2013, by a vote of 94\u20133. Following the vote, Kerry resigned his Senate seat effective at February 1, 2013, at 4 p.m. Massachusetts law required a special election within 145 to 160 days after the vacancy occurred and allowed Gov. Deval Patrick to appoint an interim senator until the winner of the special election can be sworn in. Patrick announced on January 30, 2013, that he would appoint his former Chief of Staff Mo Cowan to serve as the interim senator. Cowan was sworn-in by Vice President of the United States Joe Biden on February 7, 2013. Cowan did not run in the special election. Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin set the dates for the election with the primaries on April 30, 2013, and the general election on June 25, 2013. Democratic Congressman Ed Markey declared his candidacy on December 27, 2012, and was the favorite of the Democratic establishment, receiving endorsements from Kerry, Victoria Kennedy (the widow of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy) and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch also sought the Democratic nomination. Former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown was considered the overwhelming Republican favorite, but announced on February 1, 2013, that he would not run in the special election. Kerry was re-elected in 2008 with 66 percent of the vote. On April 30, 2013, Markey easily defeated Lynch to secure the Democratic nomination taking over 57 percent of the over 550,000 cast. Gabriel Gomez, a former Navy SEAL won the Republican nomination taking 51 percent of about 190,000 votes cast; defeating former United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and former Acting Director Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Michael Sullivan who had 36 percent and state Rep. Daniel Winslow, who had 13 percent. Markey easily defeated Gomez on June 25, 2013, capturing over 625,000 votes of approximately 1.2 million cast, garnering approximately 55 percent to Gomez's 45 percent and less than 1 percent for Richard Heos, nominee of the Twelve Vision's Party. ===New Jersey=== 89-year-old Sen.
