    "text": "Nadine Elizabeth Louise Coyle (born 15 June 1985) is an Irish singer, actress and model. In 2002, Coyle was selected as a member of the girl group Girls Aloud, with whom she has been successful in achieving a string of 20 consecutive UK top ten singles (including four number ones), two UK number one albums, five consecutive platinum selling studio albums and received nominations for five BRIT Awards, winning Best Single in 2009 for \"The Promise\". Coyle released her debut solo album Insatiable and its title track was released on 8 November 2010 through her own label, Black Pen Records, in partnership with supermarket giant Tesco. In late 2017, she released her new single \"Go to Work\" on Virgin EMI Records. The single charted at number 57 on the Official Singles Sales Chart, and at number 52 on the Scottish Singles Chart. Coyle released her Nadine EP the same year, reaching number 1 on iTunes chart. In 2019, her single \"Fool for Love\" was released under Xenomania. In 2020, her single \"All That I Know\" was released, which reached 62 on the Official UK Charts. ==Early life== Coyle was born on 15 June 1985 to Lillian and Niall Coyle in Derry, Northern Ireland. Her parents first noticed her talent for singing at the age of two, when she sang The Drifters' \"Saturday Night at the Movies\". Coyle was uninterested in her education but received good marks. She recorded a demo CD, which was distributed to Louis Walsh and The Late Late Show. The CD included cover versions of \"Fields of Gold\", \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\", \"Love Is\", and the aria \"Summertime\". ==Career== ===2002\u20132009: Girls Aloud=== Girls Aloud performing live While attending Thornhill College in 2001, Coyle auditioned for the Irish version of the reality television talent show Popstars, on which Louis Walsh was a judge. She won a place in the band Six, but it was later revealed that she had lied about her age. She was just 16 years old, two years younger than the minimum age requirement of 18. Coyle said she was \"exploited\" by RT\u00c9. She returned to Thornhill College in Derry. She later revealed how she had a cancer scare when she found a lump in her breast when she was 17. Walsh encouraged Coyle to enter Popstars: The Rivals, the second British series of the international Popstars franchise. The series' goal was to create two winning pop groups \u2013 a boy band and a girl group, each consisting of five members who would then partake in \"a battle of the sexes\" as they vie for the Christmas number one on the UK Singles Chart. Several thousand applicants attended auditions across the UK in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Walsh, Pete Waterman, and Geri Halliwell. These finalists then took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating weekly between the girls and boys). Following her performance of \"Fields of Gold\", Walsh told her she gave the \"performance of the night. Stole the show for me,\" while fellow judge Halliwell said, \"I'd love to buy a single of yours already\". Coyle joined Cheryl Tweedy, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts, and Kimberley Walsh to comprise the new girl group Girls Aloud, formed through the show by a public vote on 30 November 2002. The group's debut single \"Sound of the Underground\" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the 2002 Christmas number one. Girls Aloud hold the record for the shortest time between formation and reaching number one. The group released their debut album Sound of the Underground in May 2003, which entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) later the same year. Their singles \"I'll Stand by You\", \"Walk This Way\", and \"The Promise\" have charted at number one. Two of their albums have reached the top of the UK Albums Chart: their greatest hits album The Sound of Girls Aloud and 2008's Out of Control, both of which entered the chart at number one, with over one million copies of the former being sold. They also achieved seven certified albums and have been nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for \"The Promise\". The group's musical style is pop, but throughout their career they had experimented with electropop and dance-pop. Girls Aloud's collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim,Girls Aloud Critical Acclaim due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group became one of the few UK reality television acts to achieve continued success, amassing a fortune of \u00a330 million by May 2010. Guinness World Records lists them as \"Most Successful Reality TV Group\" in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for \"Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group\" in the 2008 edition, and are credited again for \"Most Successful Reality TV Group\" in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom's biggest selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone. ===2009\u20132013: Insatiable and Girls Aloud reunion=== Coyle after show in 2009 In 2009, Girls Aloud decided they would partake in a hiatus to pursue solo projects. That same year, Coyle collaborated with Boyz II Men for their album Love, recording a cover of the Take That song \"Back for Good\", although the song was cut from the final track listing. Coyle also worked with Jay Sean, although the duet was later scrapped. Coyle announced plans to release a solo album during Girls Aloud's hiatus. She enlisted Barbara Charone, who has worked with Madonna and Christina Aguilera, as a publicist and Bruce Garfield as her manager. Early reports indicated three major record labels interested in Coyle, In April 2010, it was reported she had signed to Geffen Records. The deal later fell through. In August 2010, Coyle officially signed a deal with grocery store chain Tesco's new record label, releasing the album through her own Black Pen Records imprint. She worked with a number of famous songwriters and producers during recording sessions, such as Desmond Child, Guy Chambers, Mike Elizondo, Steve Booker, Toby Gad, Tony Kanal and newcomer Ricci Riccardi. According to an interview with Booker, Coyle had worked on song ideas using GarageBand which she then presented to Booker in England to work on together further. The producer said, \"She was singing her songs to loops, and then I took the loops out and rewrote the music from scratch to her ideas.\" He described her songs as \"very pop\". Booker also worked on songs to show off Coyle's vocals: \"Because she\u2019s got such a belting voice, I tried a couple of things where she could really belt,\" he said. The album was preceded by the release of her debut single, the title track \"Insatiable\". Co-written with Guy Chambers and produced by Ricci Riccardi, the song has an \"80s feel\" and \"a harder, guitar- led sound.\" The single peaked at number twenty-six in the UK Singles Chart. In November 2012, Coyle reunited with the rest of Girls Aloud to celebrate their tenth anniversary. On 18 November 2012, the band released their new single \"Something New\" which was also the official charity single for Children in Need.

In December of that year, Coyle announced that she will have another track called \"All That I Know\" which will be released in 2020. ==Other ventures== As a member of Girls Aloud, Coyle has also appeared in the fly on the wall documentary Girls Aloud: Home Truths, the E4 documentary series Girls Aloud: Off the Record, and a one-off variety show entitled The Girls Aloud Party.

This led to her constantly commuting back and forth between the US and the UK for her projects with Girls Aloud and as a solo artist. Whilst living in Los Angeles, Coyle opened an Irish pub restaurant in Sunset Beach, California named Nadine's Irish Mist in 2008 as a family business, which would allow family members to live near her and help her run the business.

She further confirmed her reunion with ex-fianc\u00e9 Jason Bell, who is the father of her daughter. Their daughter, Ana\u00edya Bell, was born on 10 February 2014. In 2015, after nine years in Los Angeles, Coyle closed down Nadine's Irish Mist and moved back to Northern Ireland to raise her daughter Ana\u00edya. She stated that she decided to close the restaurant as the business gradually took a toll on her overworked family members, and that she was tired of being approached by film and television producers who wanted to use the restaurant for their projects.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzhZ05iMiI She also stated that she was becoming homesick for Northern Ireland whilst living in Los Angeles. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| IRL ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SCO Peak positions for albums in Scotland: * For Insatiable: ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| Insatiable | * Released: 8 November 2010 * Label: Black Pen, Tesco * Formats: CD, digital download | 20 || 51 || 47 |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of EPs ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Nadine | * Released: 22 March 2018 * Label: Virgin EMI * Formats: Digital download |} ===Singles=== ====Lead==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of singles, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| IRL ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SCO Peak positions for singles in Scotland: * For \"Insatiable\": * For \"Go to Work\": * For \"All That I Know\": ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Insatiable\" | 2010 | 20 || 23 || 26 | Insatiable |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Sweetest High\" | 2011 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | rowspan=\"3\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Go to Work\" | 2017 | \u2014 || 52 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Fool for Love\" | 2019 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"All That I Know\" | 2020 | \u2014 || 62 || \u2014 | |- |colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:9pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes album that did not chart or was not released |} Note ====Collaborations==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of non- single guest appearances, with other performing artists, showing year released and album name ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:19em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:13em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I Could Be\" (with Shane Filan) | 2015 | Right Here |- |} ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Television |- !
