She won three WTA singles titles, reached the quarterfinals of the 2003 Wimbledon Championships and achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 11 in May 2002. Farina Elia won her first ITF title at Caltagirone in 1991 and her first WTA tournament at Strasbourg in 2001. She made her d\u00e9but Grand Slam appearance at the 1991 French Open and was coached by husband Francesco Elia, whom she married September 1999. ==Career== Farina Elia made steady progression on the ITF circuit during the early 1990s and finished her first year in the top 100 in 1991. She completed her first victory over a top ten player (Gabriela Sabatini, Roland Garros) in 1994 and won her first doubles title the next year. In 1996, she represented Italy at the Atlanta Olympics. 1998 was considered her breakthrough year, reaching the final of four tournaments and in the process securing a place in the year end top 20. She was 26 at the time and thus considered a \"late bloomer\". She only reached one singles final in 1999 but made a greater impact in doubles, winning three tournaments. In 2001, Farina Elia won a belated first WTA Tour title, at the Internationaux de Strasbourg. She ended the year No. 14, what was to be her best year end finish and played in the WTA Tour Championships of 2001 and 2002. She consolidated the Strasbourg win with two more wins at the tournament. In 2003, she achieved her best Grand Slam result at the unlikely venue of Wimbledon, home of her least favourite surface, losing to Kim Clijsters, 7\u20135, 0\u20136, 1\u20136 in the quarterfinals. Farina Elia represented Italy at nine Federation Cups and also at three Olympics. On Monday 24 October 2005 she announced her retirement from the tour due a recurrence of a shoulder, saying, \"My body has given all it can.\" ==Personal life== Farina Elia began playing tennis aged 10; introduced to the sport by her mother, who played recreationally. Her parents are both insurance agents, as is her sister, Olga. Her brother, Enrico, restores furniture. She married Francesco Elia on 22 September 1999 and described the prospect of life after tennis as \"exciting\".Sony Ericsson WTA Tour ==WTA career finals== ===Singles: 13 (3\u201310)=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |Legend |- bgcolor=\"#f3e6d7\" | Grand Slam (0) |- bgcolor=\"#ffffcc\" | Tier I (0) |- bgcolor=\"#ccccff\" | Tier II (0) |- bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" | Tier III (3) |- bgcolor=\"#66CCFF\" | Tier IV-V (0) |} {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:75px\"|Outcome !style=\"width:20px\"|No. !style=\"width:115px\"|Date !style=\"width:200px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:60px\"|Date !style=\"width:200px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:140px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- bgcolor=\"#66CCFF\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 1. | 21 July 1991 | San Marino | Clay | Katia Piccolini | 6\u20132, 6\u20133 |- bgcolor=\"#66CCFF\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 2. | 11 January 1998 | Auckland, New Zealand | Hard | Dominique van Roost | 4\u20136, 7\u20136(9\u201311), 7\u20135 |- bgcolor=\"#66CCFF\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 3. | 26 April 1998 | Budapest, Hungary | Clay | Virginia Ruano Pascual | 6\u20134, 4\u20136, 6\u20133 |- bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 4. | 19 July 1998 | Warsaw, Poland | Clay | Conchita Mart\u00ednez | 6\u20130, 6\u20133 |- bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 5. | 1 November 1998 | Luxembourg City, Luxembourg | Carpet (i) | Mary Pierce | 6\u20130, 2\u20130 ret. |- bgcolor=\"#66CCFF\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 6. | 14 February 1999 | Prost\u011bjov, Czech Republic | Carpet (i) | Henrieta Nagyov\u00e1 | 7\u20136(7\u20132), 6\u20134 |- bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 7. | 7 January 2001 | Gold Coast, Australia | Hard | Justine Henin | 7\u20136(7\u20135), 6\u20134 |- bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" | bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner | 1. | 26 May 2001 | Strasbourg, France | Clay | Anke Huber | 7\u20135, 0\u20136, 6\u20134 |- bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" | bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner | 2. | 25 May 2002 | Strasbourg, France | Clay | Jelena Doki\u0107 | 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20133 |- bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" | bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner | 3. | 24 May 2003 | Strasbourg, France | Clay | Karolina \u0160prem | 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 6\u20134 |- bgcolor=\"#66CCFF\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 8. | 17 January 2004 | Canberra, Australia | Hard | Paola Su\u00e1rez | 3\u20136, 6\u20134, 7\u20136(7\u20135) |- bgcolor=\"#ccccff\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 9. | 22 February 2004 | Antwerp, Belgium | Hard (i) | Kim Clijsters | 6\u20133, 6\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#ccccff\" | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 10. | 10 April 2005 | Amelia Island, United States | Clay | Lindsay Davenport | 7\u20135, 7\u20135 |} ===Doubles: 17 (9\u20138)=== ;Wins (9) *2004: Warsaw (w/ Francesca Schiavone) *2001: Strasbourg (w/ Iroda Tulyaganova) *2000: Palermo (w/ Rita Grande) *1999: Auckland (w/ Barbara Schett) *1999: 's Hertogenbosch (w/ Rita Grande) *1999: P\u00f6rtschach (w/ Karina Hab\u0161udov\u00e1) *1998: Prague (w/ Karina Hab\u0161udov\u00e1) *1997: Palermo (w/ Barbara Schett) *1995: Maria Lankowitz (with Andrea Temesv\u00e1ri) ;Runners-up (8) *2005: Gold Coast (w/ Maria Elena Camerin) *2004: Paris (w/ Francesca Schiavone) *2003: Linz (w/ Marion Bartoli) *2000: Hannover (w/ Karina Hab\u0161udov\u00e1) *1997: Gold Coast (w/ Ruxandra Dragomir) *1996: Moscow (w/ Barbara Schett) *1993: Palermo (w/ Brenda Schultz) *1990: Taranto (w/ Rita Grande) ==ITF finals== ===Singles (2\u20131)=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" !
