UK & Ireland Eurosport - Sport News | African Cup of NationsGoogler @ Lane Cove: Huang commentating on Italy vs. Australia This commentary has been compared to Bj\u00f8rge Lillelien's \"Your boys took one hell of a beating\". He shouted himself hoarse in the process, and celebrated the Socceroos' exit from the Cup: :... \"Penalty! Penalty! Penalty! Grosso's done it! Grosso's done it! Don't give the Australians any chance.\" :... \"The great Italian left back! He succeeded in the glorious traditions of Italy! Facchetti, Cabrini and Maldini, their souls are infused in him at this moment! Grosso represents the long history and traditions of Italian soccer; he's not fighting alone at this moment! He's not alone!!\" :... \"Totti, Totti is facing the spot kick. He is facing the expectations from Italian soccer fans all over the world.\" :... \"Schwarzer has saved two spot kicks in the World Cup qualifying tournaments, both of these were during the playoffs of the world cup qualification. Totti should have known this. Will he still be able to face the man in front of him with a smile? How about his expression after 10 seconds?\" :... \"Goooooal! Game over! Italy win! Beat the Socceroos! They do not fall in front of Hiddink again! Italy the great! Italian left back the great! Long live Italy! Happy birthday to Maldini!! Forza Italia!!\" :... \"He didn't let the Italians down. This penalty kick was an absolute one-off! Absolute one-off! Italy have made the final eight!\" :... \"The victory belongs to Italy, to Grosso, to Cannavaro, to Zambrotta, to Buffon, to Maldini, to everyone who loves Italian soccer!!\" :... \"The hell with them!\" (Background voice) :... \"The Socceroos might regret, Hiddink! He played too conservatively and too calmly with one more player (than Italy) in the second half, he lost all his courage. Faced with the long history and traditions of Italian soccer, he didn't attack as fiercely as he did in the group matches. He finally reaped fruits which he had sown! They should go home. They don't need to go as far away as Australia as most of them are living in Europe. Farewell!\" Huang was initially unapologetic for his controversial commentary in the post-game linkup with CCTV. He stated that he could not be impartial all the time and he did dislike the Socceroos because the team reminded him of the New Zealand team which defeated and eliminated the Chinese national team under controversial circumstances in the 1981 World Cup qualifying tournament. World Cup Commentator Apologizes for Biased Comments Huang's commentary sparked a barrage of complaints as well as several press criticisms the following day. His commentary was replaced with another commentator's when the video of the match was replayed by CCTV. After reviewing his commentary, Huang eventually apologised on the state-run CCTV the next day, and posted an apology on its website for his unwarranted prejudice. He did not commentate on the next game. Huang appeared live on CCTV again while he acted as commentator to the Germany vs. Argentina (BallackVSTangoBrigade) match on 30 June 2006, which quashed the rumour that he has been dismissed by CCTV. He commentated on many subsequent matches, including the final between France and Italy held in Berlin on 9 July 2006. In all these matches, Huang was paired with a fellow commentator. === Post-match reactions === Huang's outburst caused an uproar and then sparked a huge debate online and offline in China, \u9ec4\u5065\u7fd4\u89e3\u8bf4\u4e89\u8bae\u4e8b\u4ef6_2006\u4e16\u754c\u676f_\u65b0\u6d6a\u7f51 as well as in Australia. His superior Zhang Bin, the director of CCTV Sports Channel, criticised Huang for first losing his voice (\u5931\u58f0), next losing his cool (\u5931\u6001) then losing his politeness (\u5931\u793c), and finally losing his mind (\u5931\u5e38). Others criticised Huang for ceasing to be a neutral commentator at an official media and opined he should resign immediately. On the other hand, people supporting Huang public voiced their opinions on several online forums to prevent his dismissal. A number of on-line parodies of Huang's match commentary became available on the Chinese websites such as on NetEase and Sina. On November 16, 2006, Huang Jianxiang announced his resignation from CCTV, citing he needed a break from his busy schedule.
