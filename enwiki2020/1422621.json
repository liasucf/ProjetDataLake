    "text": "Fuji Rock Festival is an annual rock festival held in Naeba Ski Resort, in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The three-day event, organized by Smash Japan, features more than 200 Japanese and international musicians, making it the largest outdoor music event in Japan. In 2005, more than 100,000 people attended the festival. Fuji Rock Festival is named so because the first event in 1997 was held at the base of Mount Fuji. Since 1999 the festival has been held at the Naeba Ski Resort in Yuzawa, Niigata. == Festival grounds == The Green Stage There are seven main stages and other minor stages scattered throughout the site. The Green stage is the main stage and it has a capacity for almost 50,000 spectators. Other stages include the White Stage, the Red Marquee, Orange Court, and Field of Heaven. The walks between some of the stages can be long, and some of the trails can be hilly, but the walks are beautiful, often taking you through forests and over sparkling streams. Dragondola \u2013 the longest gondola lift in the world, carries festival goers up to the top of the mountain overlooking the festival site. The hub of the site is called Oasis where more than 30 food stalls from around the world gather. The main site closes each night after the final act, but Oasis continues to stay open until late at night, as well as the Red Marquee where an all-night rave continues until 5am. The site re-opens at 9am. The night before the festival (Thursday night) features an opening party which is free entry, featuring bon-odori (traditional Japanese folk dance), prize draws, food stalls and a fireworks display. The festival's stated aim is to be \"The cleanest festival in the world\"; great effort is also put into recycling. == Accommodation == Although Naeba, being a ski resort, offers a number of accommodation options such as hotels, ryokan and minshuku within walking distance of the festival site, competition for these is fierce and they tend to book out very quickly. Many festival goers find accommodation in nearby ski resorts such as Tashiro, Asagai and Mitsumata \u2013 the free shuttle bus linking JR Echigo-Yuzawa Station (in the town of Yuzawa to the festival site can be used for these areas which are en route. Some even find accommodation in the numerous options available in Yuzawa itself. The shuttle bus takes between 40 minutes to an hour each way and runs until 2am each night. Alternatively, there is a campsite on a golf course next to the festival site which costs \uffe53000 for the weekend (2011), complete with toilets, showers and food stalls. About 17,000 festival goers choose to spend their nights here every year. The campsite is hilly in many places and flat spots are taken quickly, however, the manicured putting greens, which are the flattest areas are generally out of bounds to campers. In previous years many took the option of sleeping rough \u2013 a relatively common practise amongst young Japanese during the warmer months thanks to a low crime rate \u2013 in the vicinity of the site and Echigo-Yuzawa Station, however this is now prohibited. == Access == The festival is a free 40\u201360-minute shuttle bus ride from JR Echigo-Yuzawa Station in the town of Yuzawa, on the Joetsu Shinkansen (bullet train) line which link it to Tokyo station in about 1.5 hours. JR Shinkansen ticket, Tokyo to Echigo-Yuzawa is 6,490 Yen one way (for a reserved seat). Car parking also available for 3,000 Yen per day at the festival site area.Travel Japan Guide \u2013 The Fuji Rock Festival 2008 == History == Campsite at Fuji Rock Field of Heaven The first year of the festival, held on Tenjinyama Ski Resort near Mt Fuji (and hence the name), was a disaster. It was scheduled to be a two-day event, but by sheer bad luck the first day of the event was struck by a typhoon. The Red Hot Chili Peppers' headline set, played through a storm despite Anthony Kiedis having a broken arm, is almost legendary amongst Fuji Rock veterans. The festival-goers were poorly prepared for the heavy rain and strong winds, and many needed medical attention from hypothermia (although no deaths occurred). The organisers decided to cancel the second day of the event (which turned out to be sunny), and thus ended Japan's first outdoor rock festival. The organizers were criticized for being poorly prepared for bad weather, and for not organising enough buses to link the site to the nearest train station.Blog of music writer Dai Onojima (a transcript from his article on Music Magazine Sept., 1997 Issue (Japanese) The second year, the festival moved to a temporary location in Toyosu, on Tokyo's waterfront. Although the event was a success, many found the searing heat of mid-summer Tokyo too much to bear, and it was decided that the next event was to return to the relative coolness of the mountains. It was in 1999 the festival found its home in Naeba, Niigata prefecture. Naeba is not anywhere close to Mt. Fuji, however, the festival still retains its original name. After the horrific first year, the organizers have been running the festival smoothly up until present. === 2020 === The festival was scheduled for Friday 21 August through Sunday 23 August 2020, with headline acts to include Tame Impala (Friday), The Strokes (Saturday), Kiyoshiro Imawano Rock 'n' Forever tribute and Denki Groove (both Sunday). On 5 June 2020, this iteration of the festival was postponed to August 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the 2020 Fuji Rock Festival was put together from past performances and broadcast live on YouTube on the original scheduled dates. === 2019 === The festival ran from Friday 26 July until Sunday 28 July in 2019. Headline performers on The Green Stage were The Chemical Brothers, The Cure, and Sia. About 36 percent of the acts were in the rock genre, while the rest of the lineup was composed of pop, R&B;, hip hop, and electronic artists. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | colspan=\"3\" style=\"text- align:center;\"| Green Stage |- !Friday !Saturday !Sunday |- | style=\"text- align:center; vertical-align:top; width:250px;\"| The Chemical Brothers Ellegarden Janelle Mon\u00e1e Route 17 Rock'n'Roll Orchestra Anne-Marie Red Hot Chili Pipers | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top; width:250px;\"| Sia Martin Garrix Asian Kung-Fu Generation Cake Ging Nang Boyz Dohatsuten | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top; width:250px;\"| The Cure Jason Mraz Superfly Hiatus Kaiyote never young beach Hanggai Special Guest: G&G; Miller Orchestra |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| White Stage |- !Friday !Saturday !Sunday |- | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top; width:250px;\"| Thom Yorke Tomorrow's Modern Boxes Tycho Shikao Suga Gary Clark Jr. King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard Tavito Nanao Lucky Tapes | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top; width:250px;\"| Death Cab for Cutie American Football Clammbon Courtney Barnett Unknown Mortal Orchestra ZOO Gezan | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top; width:250px;\"| James Blake Vince Staples KOHH Hyukoh Interactivo Banda Bassotti Sanabagun. |} Other major acts include: Mitski, Toro y Moi, Kaytranada, The Lumineers, The Waterboys, Daniel Caesar, Alvvays, Ego-Wrappin', George Porter Jr., Chon, The Comet Is Coming, and Khruangbin. === 2018 === The festival ran from Friday 27 July until Sunday 29 July in 2018.
