Qatar occupies a small desert peninsula that is around 80 km (50 miles) from east to west and 160 km (100 miles) from north to south.Anthony, J. D., & Crystal, J. A. (2019, March 30). Qatar. Retrieved from https://www.britannica.com/place/Qatar The climate is hot and humid with sporadic rain. Majority of the country is flat with an annual rainfall average of less than 3 inches.Anthony, J. D., & Crystal, J. A. (2019, March 30). Qatar. Retrieved from https://www.britannica.com/place/Qatar Arnebia hispidissim blooms yellow flowers annually in sandy soil.Boulos, Loutfy. \"Materials for a Flora of Qatar.\" Webbia 32.2 (1978): 369-96. Web. Glossonema edule has edible fruits with brownish-yellow flowers.Boulos, Loutfy. \"Materials for a Flora of Qatar.\" Webbia 32.2 (1978): 369-96. Web. Vegetation is extremely sparse in the hamada landscape due to the heavily weathered soil. A native species of tree, Vachellia tortilis (known locally as samr) is well adapted to the desert environment and one of the most common forms of vegetation in the country. Tetraena qatarensis and Lycium shawii also grow in this landscape.Casey & Vine (1992), p. 78 Shallow depressions referred to as rawdat constitute a more varied selection of plants since rainwater run- off is more likely to accumulate. Ziziphus nummularia favors deeper soil in this type of habitat, whereas the grass Cymbopogon parkeri is found in shallower soils. In the south of the peninsula, where groundwater is scarce, Panicum turgidum and V. tortilis grow in the wind-blown soils. Vegetative distribution in the south is mostly concentrated in rawdas and in wadis fed by run-off from nearby hills. ==Natural areas== Mangroves in Al Thakhira Dense clumps of Panicum turgidum growing in Al Maszhabiya reserve, southern Qatar Mangroves on Qatar's eastern shore A flowering plant near Jebel Jassassiyeh Natural areas in Qatar include: * Al Shahaniyah Park in Al-Shahaniya * Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation * Khor Al Udeid Fish Sanctuary * Al Reem Biosphere Preserve (designated in 2007) is part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves in the Arab States * Ras Ushairij Gazelle Conservation Park * Al Thakira Nature Reserve in Al Thakhira * Khor Al Adaid in Khor Al Adaid * Ras Abrouq Nature Reserve (also known as Bir Zekreet (Zekreet Beach) in Ras AbrouqNatural Landmarks Qatar Tourism Authority * Umm Tais National Park ==Taxonomy== ===Class: Psilotopsida=== ====Order: Ophioglossales==== *Family: Ophioglossaceae **Genus: Ophioglossum ***Ophioglossum polyphyllum (native) ===Class: Magnoliopsida=== ====Order: Asterales==== *Family: Asteraceae **Genus: Reichardia ***Reichardia tingitana (native) (common names: , , and ) ====Order: Caryophyllales==== *Family: Amaranthaceae **Genus: Suaeda ***Suaeda aegyptiaca **Genus: Salsola ***Salsola rosmarinus *Family: Caryophyllaceae **Genus: Silene ***Silene Arabica (native) *Family: Polygonaceae **Genus: Calligonum ***Calligonum comosum (native) ====Order: Malpighiales==== A large bush of Tetraena qatarensis growing in a saline wasteland in the West Bay area of Doha *Family: Euphorbiaceae **Genus: Mercurialis ***Mercurialis annua (introduced) ====Order: Fabales==== *Family: Fabaceae **Genus: Taverniera ***Taverniera spartea (native) **Genus: Senna ***Senna occidentalis (introduced) ====Order: Zygophyllales==== *Family: Zygophyllaceae **Genus: Tetraena ***Tetraena qatarensis (native) ==Cultural significance== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
