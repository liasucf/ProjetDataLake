Jushin was part of the Seiwa Genji Imagawa clan of the Sengoku period. When the once powerful Imagawa clan fell to the conquests of Oda Nobunaga, Jushin decided to dedicate his life to martial arts training. He left the castle for the Atago Mountains where he underwent intense physical and spiritual training. The result of that training became known as Sekiguchi ShinShin Ry\u016b, and rumors of the wanderer and of his art rang throughout the country. Tokugawa Yorinobu, head of the Kishu Han (modern day Wakayama Prefecture) had heard about Jushin and after meeting him Jushin was asked to be a permanent guest of the Han at Wakayama castle and teach Sekiguchi-ry\u016b. From there the art spread all the way to Edo Tokugawa where the 8th Tokugawa sh\u014dgun, Tokugawa Yoshimune, became a menkyo kaiden of Sekiguchi Ryu.Bushinjuku During World War II many of the ry\u016bs documents containing history and techniques were lost in fires from Allied bombing. After a 15-year pause in training, Yoshitaro, the 12th S\u014dke, with the help of head student Fujimura Shigeru restored the art and passed it on to the present soke, 13th generation, Sekiguchi Yoshio. ==See also== * Gosho Motoharu ==Notes== Category:Ko-ry\u016b bujutsu Category:Japanese martial arts ",
