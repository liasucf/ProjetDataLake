    "text": "\"Krusty Krab Training Video\" is an episode of the American animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. It is the second part of the 10th episode of the third season, and the second half of the 50th episode overall. The episode was written by Aaron Springer, C. H. Greenblatt, and Kent Osborne, and the animation was directed by Frank Weiss. Springer and Greenblatt also served as storyboard directors, and Caleb Meurer served as storyboard artist. The episode originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on May 10, 2002. The series follows the adventures and endeavours of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob is depicted as a trainee in an industrial training video for new employees of the Krusty Krab restaurant. The video details the beginnings of the restaurant, its various implements, and what it takes to become a good Krusty Krab employee. \"Krusty Krab Training Video\" received critical acclaim from online critics, who praised its originality and meta-humour for being a parody of industrial videos. ==Plot== The episode is formatted as an industrial training video, with the narrator (Steve Kehela) beginning by congratulating the newly hired employee of the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob asks if he can now make a Krabby Patty burger, with the narrator rebuffing his question for now, and first shares how the restaurant was not always the success it is at present. The narrator briefly tells about its owner, Mr. Krabs, who suffered from a long depression after \"the war\" before deciding to acquire a bankrupt retirement home and turn it into a restaurant. In present day, the restaurant has since tried to modernize itself and maintain customer satisfaction by acquiring the \"latest\" fast food technology, such as the spatula and the cash register among others. For the restaurant's employees, the narrator differentiates the characteristics of a potentially good employee and a bad employee through the examples of SpongeBob and Squidward respectively. SpongeBob repeats his question from earlier, to which the narrator replies that he must first know about the acronym \"P.O.O.P.\" (short for \"People Order Our Patties\") before he can make Krabby Patties. Other matters discussed by the narrator include personal hygiene, the work station, and how to interact with the manager Mr. Krabs, all while SpongeBob impatiently awaits the chance to make a Krabby Patty. With the narrator finished telling SpongeBob about all the basics of being an employee, he asks if SpongeBob is ready to prepare a Krabby Patty. As SpongeBob vigorously answers yes, the narrator is about to tell the burger's secret formula before the training video abruptly cuts to the credits. ==Release== \"Krusty Krab Training Video\" originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on May 10, 2002.
