    "text": "York H\u00f6ller (; born 11 January 1944) is a German composer and Professor of composition at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik K\u00f6ln. ==Biography== H\u00f6ller was born in Leverkusen. Between 1963 and 1970 he studied at the Cologne Musikhochschule: composition with Joachim Blume and Bernd Alois Zimmermann, piano with Else Schmitz-Gohr and Alfons Kontarsky, and orchestral conducting with Wolfgang von der Nahmer. In parallel to this he studied musicology and philosophy at the University of Cologne. He did further musical studies at the Internationale Ferienkurse f\u00fcr Neue Musik in Darmstadt with Pierre Boulez, and in 1967 sat his examination in music education. H\u00f6ller was active for a short time as a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur at the Staatstheater Bonn. At the Electronic Music Studio of WDR in 1971\u201372, he \"continued his studies with Karlheinz Stockhausen\" or, alternatively, \"was given the chance, at Stockhausen\u2019s invitation, to realize works of his own\" . In any case, the technique he developed at this time\u2014a form of extended serialism which he calls \"Gestalt composition\"\u2014bears a resemblance to the older composer\u2019s formula composition (; ), and in 1982 H\u00f6ller dedicated his orchestral work Schwarze Halbinseln to Stockhausen . He quickly gained international recognition with his works. From the mid-1970s H\u00f6ller also composed at the Paris research institute IRCAM, where Pierre Boulez had invited him, and in 1989 his opera Der Meister und Margarita (after the novel of the same name by Mikhail Bulgakov) was premi\u00e8red at the Grand Op\u00e9ra. From 1986 to 1990 H\u00f6ller was lecturer in analysis and music theory at the Musikhochschule K\u00f6ln. Subsequently, he succeeded Stockhausen as artistic director of the WDR Studio for Electronic Music from 1990 to 1999. In 1993 he accepted a call to the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Hanns Eisler in Berlin as professor of composition. As a successor to Hans Werner Henze he moved in 1995 in this same capacity to the Cologne Musikhochschule. In addition, H\u00f6ller has presented lectures and held composition courses at many European and American colleges. Since 1991 York H\u00f6ller has been a member of the Academy of Arts, Berlin. ==Honors== York H\u00f6ller has received numerous distinctions: *The Bernd Alois Zimmermann Prize of the City of Cologne *The F\u00f6rderpreis of the State of North Rhine\u2013Westphalia *The Prize of the International Composers\u2019 Forum of UNESCO *The Rolf Liebermann Prize for Opera Composers *The Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1986 bestowed by the French Minister of Culture *The 2010 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition for the orchestral work Sph\u00e4ren ==Works== ===Compositions=== *F\u00fcnf St\u00fccke, for piano (1964) *Diaphonie, for two pianos (1965, rev. 1974) *Drei St\u00fccke, for string quartet (1966) *Herr, es ist Zeit (text: Rainer Maria Rilke), for soprano, flute, harp, harpsichord, celesta, and string quartet (1966) *Topic, for large orchestra (1967) *Sonate informelle, for piano (1968) *Sonata, for solo cello (1968) *Epitaph f\u00fcr Jan Palach, for violin and piano (1969) *Piano Concerto no. 1, for piano and orchestra (1970) *Horizont, electronic music (1971\u201372, rev. 1975) *D\u00e9collage, for two speaking choirs, electric guitar, electrically amplified cello, electronic organ, and tape (1972) *Tangens, for cello, electric guitar, piano, electric organ, and two analog synthesizers (1973) *Chroma, for large orchestra and live electronics (1972\u201374) *Klanggitter, for cello, piano, synthesizer, and tape (1975\u201376) *Antiphon (String Quartet no. 1), for string quartet and electronically transformed string quartet on tape (1976, rev. 1984) *Arcus, for 15 instruments, percussion, and tape (1978) *Moments musicaux, for flute and piano (1979) *Mythos, tone poem for 13 instruments, percussion, and electronic sounds (1979\u201380) *Umbra, for large orchestra and tape (1979\u201380) *R\u00e9sonance, for orchestra and computer-generated sounds on tape (1981) *Schwarze Halbinseln, for large orchestra, with vocal and electronic sounds on tape (1982) *Pas de trois, for viola, cello, contrabass (1982) *Traumspiel (text: August Strindberg), for soprano, large orchestra, and electronics (1983) *Magische Klanggestalt, for large orchestra (1984) *Improvisation sur le nom de Pierre Boulez, for 16 instrumentalists (1984) *Piano Sonata no. 2 (Hommage \u00e0 Franz Liszt) (1986) *Der Meister und Margarita, opera in two acts after the novel by Mikhail Bulgakov (1984\u201389) *Fanal, for trumpet and orchestra (1989) *Aura, for large orchestra (1992, rev. 1996) *Pens\u00e9es (Piano Concerto no. 2), for piano, orchestra, and electronics (1993) *Pas de deux, for cello and piano (1993) *Tagtr\u00e4ume, for violin, cello, and piano (1994) *Gegenkl\u00e4nge, for 18 instruments (1996) *Double, for orchestra (1996) *Partita, for two pianos (1996) *String Quartet no. 2 (1997) *Initium, for piano (1998) *Widerspiel, for two pianos and large orchestra (1996\u201399, rev. 2009) *Movement, for large orchestra (1998\u201399) *Herbsttag (text: Rainer Maria Rilke, for mezzo-soprano, flute, harp, harpsichord, celesta, and string quartet (1999) *Verzweigung, for piano (1999) *Aufbruch, for orchestra (1999) *Ex tempore, for flute, oboe, clarinet (doubling bass clarinet), percussion, violin, viola, cello, harp, and piano (2001) *Trias, for alto saxophone, percussion, and piano (2001) *Der ewige Tag, for chorus, orchestra, and electronics (2001) *Monogramme, for piano (1998\u20132003) *Klangzeichen, for wind quintet and piano (2003) *Scan, for solo flute (2003) *Feuerwerk, for 17 instrumentalists (2004) *Fluchtpunkte, for flute, English horn, clarinet, piano, and percussion (2006) *Sph\u00e4ren, for orchestra (2001\u201306) *Piano Quintet, Zweigestalt (2007) *Doppelspiel for piano (two or four hands) (2006\u201309) *Mouvements for cello and piano (2009), later expanded into the Cello Concerto *Cello Concerto (2010\u201311) *Piano Sonata no. 3 (2010\u201311) *Aufschwung con tenuto, for clarinet, viola and piano (2012) *Crossing, for ensemble and electronics (2012\u201313) *Voyage for orchestra (2013\u201314) *Konzert f\u00fcr Viola und Orchester (2016\u201317) ===Writings (selective list)=== * 1982.
