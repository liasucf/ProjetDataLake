He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1941, under the supervision of Cyrus Colton MacDuffee. ==Contributions== ===Number theory=== In 1952, the first edition of his book, Theory of Numbers, was published.Review of Theory of Numbers by H. Bergstr\u00f6m, . Stewart's contributions to number theory also include a complete characterization of the practical numbers in terms of their factorizations, which he published in 1954, a year before Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski's independent discovery of the same result. ===Geometry=== In 1970 he published a book, Adventures among the toroids. A study of orientable polyhedra with regular faces, in which he discussed what are now called Stewart toroids. The book was handwritten in calligraphy with many formulas and illustrations. Like the Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, and Johnson solids, the Stewart polyhedra have regular polygons as faces. The first three categories are all convex, whereas Stewart toroids have polygonal-faced tunnels.\"Bonnie Stewarts Hohlk\u00f6rper\", by Christoph P\u00f6ppe, Spektrumdirekt (website of the German edition of Scientific American). ==Selected publications== * B.
