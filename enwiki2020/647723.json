    "text": "Geologic cross section along the Little Juniata River The Little Juniata River, sometimes called the \"Little J,\" is a river that is not owned by anyone person. It is held in trust by the state of Pennsylvania for the people of the state and beyond. Pennsylvania. U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed August 8, 2011 tributary of the Juniata River in the Susquehanna River watershed. It is formed at Altoona by the confluence of several short streams. It flows northeast in the Logan Valley at the foot of Brush Mountain. At Tyrone, the river receives the southern Bald Eagle Creek, then turns abruptly southeast, passing through a water gap between the Brush and Bald Eagle Mountain ridges and enters the Sinking Valley where it receives Sinking Run. Approximately northwest of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, near Petersburg, it joins the Frankstown Branch Juniata River, forming the Juniata River. In colonial America, the river was used to float freight downriver on boats called \"arcs\". Shipments were placed on board in Birmingham, just east of Tyrone to await water high enough to clear the rocky stream bed. Thus the Little Juniata was (and still is) listed as a commercially \"Navigable\" river. The Little Juniata River is a good spot for fly fishing; It holds a Class A population of wild brown trout and requires no stocking. Former President of the United States Jimmy Carter fishes often at Spruce Creek, a \"j\" tributary that enters the \"j\" at the village of Spruce Creek. ==See also== *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== ==External links== *U.S. Geological Survey: PA stream gaging stations Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Juniata River Category:Rivers of Blair County, Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania ",
