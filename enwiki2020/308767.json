    "text": "In the First Folio, the plays of William Shakespeare were grouped into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies; and modern scholars recognize a fourth category, romance, to describe the specific types of comedy that appear in Shakespeare's later works. ==Plays== This alphabetical list includes everything listed as a comedy in the First Folio of 1623, in addition to the two quarto plays (The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles, Prince of Tyre) which are not included in the Folio but generally recognised to be Shakespeare's own. Plays marked with an asterisk (*) are now commonly referred to as the romances. Plays marked with two asterisks (**) are sometimes referred to as the problem plays. * All's Well That Ends Well** * As You Like It * The Comedy of Errors * Love's Labour's Lost * Measure for Measure** * The Merchant of Venice * The Merry Wives of Windsor * A Midsummer Night's Dream * Much Ado About Nothing * Pericles, Prince of Tyre* * The Taming of the Shrew * The Tempest* * Twelfth Night * The Two Gentlemen of Verona * The Two Noble Kinsmen* * The Winter's Tale** * Cymbeline* ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ",
