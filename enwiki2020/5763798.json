    "text": "CDuce is an XML-oriented functional language, which extends XDuce in a few directions. It features XML regular expression types, XML regular expression patterns, XML iterators. CDuce is not strictly speaking an XML transformation language since it can be used for general-purpose programming. CDuce conforms to basic standards: Unicode, XML, DTD, Namespaces are fully supported, XML Schema is partially supported. == Benefits of CDuce == * static verifications (e.g.: ensure that a transformation produces a valid document); * smooth and safe compositions of XML transformations and incremental programming; * static optimizations and efficient execution model (knowing the type of a document is crucial to extract information efficiently). * complete integration with OCaml (OCaml libraries can be straightforwardly imported and CDuce programs can be exported to OCaml). * integration with Ocsigen via the OcCDuce module == Features particular to CDuce == * XML objects can be manipulated as first- class citizen values: elements, sequences, tags, characters and strings, attribute sets; sequences of XML elements can be specified by regular expressions, which also apply to characters strings; * functions themselves are first-class values, they can be manipulated, stored in data structure, returned by a function,... * a powerful pattern matching operation can perform complex extractions from sequences of XML elements; * a rich type algebra, with recursive types and arbitrary boolean combinations (union, intersection, complement) allows precise definitions of data structures and XML types; general purpose types and types constructors are taken seriously (products, extensible records, arbitrary precision integers with interval constraints, Unicode characters); * polymorphism through a natural notion of subtyping, and overloaded functions with dynamic dispatch; * a highly-effective type-driven compilation schema. == External links == * CDuce Category:XML-based programming languages Category:Functional languages ",
