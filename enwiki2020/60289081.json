Golson carefully chooses the tunes, including the lovely \"Greensleeves,\" as well as four by Golson and one by Sanders. Most relate to Trane in some way, although Golson wisely eschews any kind of retrospective. Thankfully, too, the saxophonists never engage in any cutting, so the results are uniformly delightful, if somewhat conservative\". == Track listing == All compositions by Benny Golson except where noted # \"Jam the Avenue\" \u2013 5:01 # \"Greensleeves\" (Traditional) \u2013 6:28 # \"Origin\" (Pharoah Sanders) \u2013 4:25 # \"A Change of Heart\" \u2013 7:25 # \"Times Past (This Is for You, John)\" \u2013 7:55 # \"Page 12\" \u2013 5:25 # \"Vilia\" (Franz Leh\u00e1r) \u2013 6:21 == Personnel == *Benny Golson, Pharoah Sanders \u2013 tenor saxophone *Cedar Walton \u2013 piano *Ron Carter - bass *Jack DeJohnette \u2013 drums ===Production=== *Benny Golson, Fumimaru Kawashima \u2013 producer *David Baker \u2013 engineer == References == Category:Benny Golson albums Category:John Coltrane tribute albums Category:1984 albums Category:Baystate Records albums Category:Timeless Records albums ",
