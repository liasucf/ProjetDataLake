Thorpe, Nicholson was born in Melbourne, and educated at Methodist Ladies' College and the University of Melbourne. She was active in the Sisters Publishing. She was managing director, and later sole owner, of D.W. Thorpe Pty Ltd, from 1968 until 1987, when the firm was sold. She authored over 25 books, many of them dealing with children and women. In 1983, Nicholson was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM), for \"service to literature and the book publishing industry\". She married Harvey Nicholson and had four children: Peter, Hilary, Wendy, and Michael. Nicholson sponsored the Joyce Thorpe Nicholson Collection, a collection of books by and about Australian women at Melbourne University. It includes rare nineteenth century material, as well as scarce twentieth century political ephemera. The Joyce Thorpe Nicholson Hall of Fame Award is sponsored by Thorpe Bowker and presented periodically to a designer whose body of work has made a significant contribution to the standards of book design in Australia. ==Timeline== (Details from an online biography) * 1935\u20131946: junior typist, secretary and sub-editor at D W Thorpe Pty Ltd (Melbourne) * 1940: vice-president of the Student Representative Council at the University of Melbourne * 1943: married George Harvey Nicholson (dec.1980).
