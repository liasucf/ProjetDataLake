    "text": "Isola is an album released in 1997 by the Swedish band Kent. It was followed in 1998 by an English version, for which a new song, \"Velvet\", was recorded. The album name comes from Ed McBains books about the 87th police district and is a paraphrase for New York City, and Isola is mentioned in the song \"Oprofessionell\"/\"Unprofessional\". The album is said to have been largely influenced by Radiohead despite the difference in its sound. The ending song from the album, 747, has become a fan favourite and is usually one of the songs Kent use to close their concerts. ==Track listing== ===Swedish version=== ===English version=== * \"OWC\" stands for Off World Colonies, a reference to the film Blade Runner.
