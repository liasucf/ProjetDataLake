    "text": "The Green Party of Florida is the state party organization for Florida of the Green Party of the United States. == History == The Green Party of Florida was organized in 1992. At that time the State of Florida had a very stringent standard applied to what were considered minor party candidates in elections. To have statewide ballot status, minor parties had to file a petition with at least 3% of all registered voters. To keep this status, they had to maintain a number of party members equal to 5% of all registered voters. In 1998 state law concerning access to the state ballot was eased. In February 1999 the state legislature implemented changes allowing any party organized on a state basis to field candidates in elections. This allowed the Green Party and other parties to qualify to field candidates on the ballot. The Green Party has retained its statewide ballot status ever since. The Florida Green Party has opposed the presence of nuclear power plants in Florida. In fact, the party intervened in the licensing process of the proposed Levy County Nuclear Power Plant, which has yet to be built. In April 2010 the Florida Green Party and the People's Lobby Coalition for Public Funding Only of All Elections held a public forum at the National Press Club in Washington, DC. The purpose of the forum was to press for only public funding of elections. ==Registration== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year !
