    "text": "\"Take Your Time\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music singer Sam Hunt. It was released to country radio, by MCA Nashville on November 24, 2014 as the second single from his debut studio album Montevallo (2014). Capitol Records headed the song's further promotion to pop and adult pop radio stations in the spring of 2015. The song became Hunt's second consecutive single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in February 2015. The song was written by Hunt, Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne. ==Content== The song is a mid-tempo ballad with a \"half-spoken, half- sung delivery\" about a man approaching a woman and expressing a desire to know her more closely. It was written by Hunt, Josh Osborne, and Shane McAnally, and was produced by McAnally and Zach Crowell. ==Critical reception== Giving it an \"A\", Jon Freeman of Country Weekly noted the \"futuristic production\" and said \"It's an incredibly seductive bit of songcraft, heightened by the way Sam confidently glides from his breathy speaking voice to his silky smooth, R&B-influenced; vocal instrument\". Billy Dukes of Taste of Country also gave the song a positive review, saying that \"As a singer, the Georgia-born ex- footballer holds his own, but doesn\u2019t make any attempts to prove he\u2019s the next Ronnie Dunn. Vocally, he\u2019s more about style than power on \u2018Take Your Time,\u2019 a sincere ballad about meeting a beautiful woman at the bar.\" Website For The Country Record was less favorable, praising Hunt's vocals but criticizing the lack of a country influence. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Tim Mattia and premiered on March 13, 2015. The video's storyline involving domestic violence is much different than that of the song's wherein a young man wanting simply to talk to a young woman at a bar. In the video, Hunt's character witnesses several instances of a tattooed man abusing his young girlfriend in public, including at a biker bar and a coin-operated laundry. Together, the two have a baby. Hunt and several others see the witness but do nothing. Then, near the end of the video, the woman tries to leave with her baby, when the boyfriend comes outside to stop her. When he begins hitting her, Hunt, who happens to be walking by the tattooed man's house, sees this and begins to fight with the man, keeping him occupied long enough to give the woman and her baby time to drive away and escape the relationship. Scenes of Hunt performing the song in the biker bar are also seen. ==Chart performance== In the United States, \"Take Your Time\" debuted at number 55 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of November 29, 2014. It also debuted at number 35 on the Hot Country Songs chart for the week of November 15, 2014, and peaked at number one for the week of February 21, 2015. It entered the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 93 for the week of January 17, 2015, and peaked at number 20, becoming Sam Hunt's second highest-charting single on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also debuted at number 40 on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart for the week of April 25, 2015.
