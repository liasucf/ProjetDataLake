    "text": "{| |} The Church Midwing JC-1, a.k.a. Church Mid-Wing Sport, is a midwing racing aircraft designed by James Church using the fuselage of a Heath aircraft. ==Design and development== The Church Midwing was designed to be an affordable homebuilt aircraft. Church marketed kits for $190. The open cockpit midwing aircraft featured windows in the wings for visibility downward. ==Operational history== Built to be a pylon racer, a Church Midwing placed third in the 1930 National Air Races. The Church used many parts from the Heath Parasol design. In 1931 the prototype was modified with an installation of a 38 hp inline air-cooled Church designed engine and a cowling modification to accommodate the cylinders protruding upward in the pilot's line of sight. A 1931 advertisement placed by Heath in Popular Mechanics extolled the virtues of its first-place finish with its parasol configuration, compared to the Church's midwing planform. ==Variants== ;RW4 RagWing Midwing Sport Replica :An ultralight replica of the JC-1, produced by RagWing Aircraft Designs. ;Church Racer :Essentially a Midwing fitted with a model J-3 46hp Church Marathon engine. ==Aircraft on Display== *EAA AirVenture Museum, Oshkosh, Wisconsin - 1 A Basket case 5 year restoration completed in 1971 by Gene Chase, outfitted with a Heath-Henderson B-4 engine. ==Specifications (Church Midwing JC-1) == ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Aerofiles Category:1920s United States sport aircraft Category:Homebuilt aircraft Category:Mid-wing aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1928 ",
