    "text": "Basil or Vasi\u013e Hopko (21 April 1904, Hrabsk\u00e9 -- 23 July 1976) was an eparch (bishop) of the Slovak Greek Catholic Church. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II for his martyrdom under Communist occupation. ==Life== Basil Hopko was born in the Rusyn village of Hrabsk\u00e9, in the S\u00e1ros County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day eastern Slovakia). His parents, Basil and Anna n\u00e9e Petrenko, were landless peasants. While Hopko was still an infant, his father was struck by lightning and died. His mother left him in care of her father, while she emigrated to the United States in search of work. When Hopko was 7 he was sent to live with his uncle Demeter Petrenko, a Greek Catholic priest. He attended the Evangelical gymnasium in Pre\u0161ov, then Czechoslovakia, graduating with honors in 1923. Hopko studied at the Eparchial Seminary in Pre\u0161ov. He had dreams of joining his mother in America, and of pursuing his priestly vocation there, but the cost of recurring health problems left him unable to afford to travel. He later wrote that when he finally decided to stay and to serve in his homeland, he was suddenly cured, and realized he had been given a sign about his calling. He was ordained a Greek Catholic priest on 3 February 1929. He served as a pastor (1929-1936) at the Greek Catholic parish in Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, where he was known for his focus on the poor, the unemployed, and students. His mother returned from America after 22 years and rejoined her son in Prague, becoming his housekeeper at the parish rectory. In 1936 he returned to teach in Pre\u0161ov's Eparchial Seminary, and was awarded the title of monsignor. He had already begun graduate studies at Charles University while in Prague, and he completed his Doctor of Theology in 1940 at Comenius University in Bratislava. In Pre\u0161ov he headed the eparchy's publishing division, where he edited a monthly periodical. After World War II, a growing Soviet Communist influence caused Bishop Pavol Peter Gojdi\u010d of Pre\u0161ov to ask the Holy See for an Auxiliary Bishop to help defend the Greek Catholic Church. Hopko was appointed to the post on 11 May 1947. The Communist take-over of Czechoslovakia wrought havoc on the Greek Catholic Church. In 1950 it was officially abolished by the state as a religious organization, and its assets were turned over to the Russian Orthodox Church. Bishop Gojdi\u010d was arrested and was imprisoned for life. Bishop Hopko was arrested on 28 April 1950 and kept on starvation rations and tortured for weeks. Eventually he was tried and sentenced to 15 years for the \"subversive activity\" of staying loyal to Rome. He was repeatedly transferred from prison to prison. His health, physical and emotional, failed, and in 1964 he was transferred to a home for the aged. He never recovered his health. During the Prague Spring the Czechoslovak government legally cleared Hopko on 13 June 1968 and the Pre\u0161ov Eparchy was restored. However, activists insisted that a Slovak bishop be appointed to the see, and the Holy See named the Slovak priest J\u00e1n Hirka as Bishop Hopko's successor. Bishop Hopko died in Pre\u0161ov at age 72 on 23 July 1976. On 14 September 2003 Pope John Paul II beatified him at a ceremony in Bratislava, Slovakia. ==References== * Bishop Basil Hopko - The Carpathian Connection * Category:1904 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Bardejov District Category:People from the Kingdom of Hungary Category:Rusyn people Category:Slovak Greek Catholic bishops Category:Slovak beatified people Category:20th-century Eastern Catholic martyrs Category:Eastern Catholic beatified people Category:Comenius University alumni Category:Czechoslovak prisoners and detainees Category:Slovak prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Czechoslovakia Category:Czechoslovak Socialist Republic rehabilitations Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century Eastern Catholic bishops Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II ",
