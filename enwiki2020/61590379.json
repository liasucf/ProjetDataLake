    "text": "The 2000 OFC Nations Cup was an international football tournament that was held in Papeete, Tahiti from 19 to 28 June 2000. The 6 national teams involved in the tournament were required to register a squad of players; only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament. The 2000 Melanesia Cup and the 2000 Polynesia Cup were used to find the four qualifiers for the finals tournament (Fiji and Solomon Islands from Melanesia and Tahiti and Cook Islands from Polynesia respectively), to move on and join Australia and New Zealand at the main tournament. Vanuatu (as the Melanesian 3rd placer) replaced Fiji in the final tournament, due to civil unrest in Fiji following the 2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat. Players marked (c) were named as captain for their national squad. Players' club teams and players' age are as of 19 June 2000 \u2013 the tournament's opening day. ==Squad lists== ===Australia=== Coach: Frank Farina ===Cook Islands=== Coach: Alan Taylor ===New Zealand=== Coach: Ken Dugdale ===Solomon Islands=== Coach: George Cowie ===Tahiti=== Coach: Leon Gardikiotis ===Vanuatu=== Coach: Juan Carlos Buzzetti == Player representation == === By club nationality === {| class=\"wikitable\" !
