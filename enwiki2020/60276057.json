From 1999 to 2002 he studied at the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California on a Fulbright scholarship.

The film was screened at the 2004 Himalayan Film Festival and received mixed reviews from critics and audiences; according to Nyay Bhushan of Phayul.com, it \"attempts to deconstruct the image of Tibetans as peaceful monks awash in Technicolor glory in Hollywood\".
