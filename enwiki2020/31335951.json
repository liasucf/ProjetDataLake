During the Edo period, a Shimoyashiki (\u4e0b\u5c4b\u6577) was a smaller residence or retreat of a lord, as opposed to his \"upper\" or main residence, called Kamiyashiki (\u4e0a\u5c4b\u6577). The size of the original residence was about 130,000 tsubo (\u576a; about ). After Lord Mitsutomo died, the grounds of the residence were divided and held by three senior vassal families of the Owari Tokugawa: the Naruse, the Ishiko, and the Watanabe families. After the Meiji Restoration in 1869, the Owari Tokugawa reacquired the estate, and rebuilt the family's residence to be suitable for the newly elevated rank in 1900. The role of the residence became less relevant during and after the Taish\u014d era (1911-1925). In 1931, Tokugawa Yoshichika (1886-1976), the 19th head of the Tokugawa family, decided that the time had come to present the property to the community, and donated the of land and buildings to the City of Nagoya. The city maintained the estate and buildings, and opened the Tokugawa-en Garden to the public the next year. Marquess Yoshichika established the Owari Tokugawa Reimeikai Foundation in 1931 to protect the treasures of the Owari Tokugawa family from being broken up. Today the Owari Tokugawa Reimeikai Foundation is named the Tokugawa Reimeikai Foundation. He opened the Tokugawa Art Museum in 1935 and donated the treasures to the foundation. Although the residence was destroyed during the Bombing of Nagoya in World War II, the main building of the museum survived. The garden was heavily damaged but later restored in 2004, and the main Black Gate (Kuro-mon) remained intact. Today, the complex houses the Tokugawa Art Museum, the H\u014dsa Library and the Tokugawa Garden. Together, they are a showcase of the might and culture of the Owari Tokugawa. It can be accessed by public transport via Morishita Station on the Seto line or \u014czone Station by the Meijo line. == Images == File:Tokugawa Residence Ozone Nagoya 06.jpg|Interior view File:Tokugawaen1.JPG|Garden with pond of the \u014czone Oshitayashiki == See also == * Kamiyashiki of Matsudaira Tadamasa in Edo * Sankei-en and Rinshunkaku in Yokohama * Ma (negative space) == References == == External links == Category:Owari Tokugawa family Category:Tourist attractions in Nagoya Category:Buildings and structures in Nagoya ",
