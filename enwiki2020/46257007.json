The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) \u2013 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government.

With the addition of certain areas in the southern parts of the city, the number of wards increased from 75 to 144. ==Geography== Ward No. 11 is bordered on the north by the junction of Bidhan Sarani and Acharya Prafulla Chandra Sarani (Panch Mathar Morh); on the east by Acharya Prafulla Chandra Sarani; on the south by Raja Rajkrishna Street; and on the west by Bidhan Sarani.Kolkata: Detail Maps of 141 Wards with Street Directory.
