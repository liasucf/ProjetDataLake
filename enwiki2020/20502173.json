    "text": "Full House is a 1980 album by British pop group The Dooleys. It included the singles \"Love Patrol\", \"Body Language\", \"In a Riddle\" and the UK top ten hit \"The Chosen Few\" among its 16 tracks. It was produced by Ben Findon. == Overview == This was the group's third studio album and featured the singles \"Love Patrol\", \"Body Language\" and \"In a Riddle\". As well as this, top 10 hit \"Chosen Few\" was added to the album, despite it being featured on the group's previous album, The Chosen Few. In fact, most of the previous album's songs appeared on this 16-track collection.The Pop Fantasia - Full House album page This cost-cutting measure was a disappointment to fans expecting an album of new songs. However, seven of the tracks were new, although these included the three already-released singles and some cover versions. The only two completely new and original songs out of the 16 were \"I Spy\" - a song written by the group themselves and one that had been released as a single in Japan - and \"Meet Me Halfway\". As well as this, the previously released track \"Whispers\" was included here in a newly recorded version (although had appeared as a B-side to \"Body Language\"). The album's chart position was marginally improved on the previous album, reaching No.54 (two places higher), but \"Body Language\" was their last regular hit single.Official Charts - Full House Chart detailsOfficial Charts - The Dooleys Chart history In Japan however, their success continued with \"Body Language\" becoming their second number one.Japanese import No.1s - \"Body Language, 1980\" Another album was released there around this time titled Pop Fantasia, which while including some tracks recycled from here and from B-sides, it featured four tracks never released in the UK: \"Only the Music's Changed\" (also released as a single), \"How Am I Ever Gonna Live it Down\", \"Situation Vacant\" and \"A Little Bit Special\".Full House CD Liner notes, Phil Hendricks, December 2012.
