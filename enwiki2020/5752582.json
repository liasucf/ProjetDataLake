    "text": "\"Strings Of My Heart\" was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001, performed in English (the first time the country had not sung at least partially in Croatian) by Vanna. The song was performed tenth on the night, following Latvia's Arnis Mednis with \"Too Much\" and preceding Portugal's MTM with \"S\u00f3 sei ser feliz assim\". At the close of voting, it had received 42 points, placing 10th in a field of 23. For her Eurovision appearance, Vanna wore a top and trousers of a colour seemingly chosen to match her hair- a light, golden colour. She was joined on stage by five backing performers- a female violinist, two singers (one male, one female), who provided vocal accompaniment, and two male singers who entered the stage for the last chorus, and provided vocal accompaniment. The song is a love ballad, with the singer asking her lover to \"play the strings of my heart\" rather than leave. It was succeeded as Croatian representative at the 2002 contest by Vesna Pisarovi\u0107 with \"Everything I Want\".
