An open mic (or open mike) (derived from the expression \"open microphone\") is a live show at a coffeehouse, nightclub, comedy club, strip club, institution or pub at which audience members who are amateur or professional may perform on stage, often for the first time, or to promote an upcoming performance. Typically, as the name suggests, the performer is provided with a microphone which is plugged into a PA system, to make the individual's performance loud enough for the audience to hear. Often the performers sign up in advance for a time slot with the host or master of ceremonies, typically an experienced performer or the venue manager or owner. The master of ceremonies may screen potential candidates for suitability for the venue and give individuals a time to perform in the show. These events are focused on performance arts like poetry and spoken word, music (often singer-songwriters who accompany themselves on guitar), and comedy. Less commonly, small groups, such as a small rock band duo/trio or a comedy duo may appear. Group performances are uncommon, because of the space and the logistics of loading in and soundchecking such a group. In strip club terms, amateur night is a contest for everyday women and men who compete for a cash prize by taking their clothes off just like professional strippers. Open mic nights may have no cover charge, or a very low cover charge, although the venue may have a gratuity jar, \"pass the hat\" for donations or hold a raffle with various prizes. Venues that have no charge make revenue from selling alcoholic beverages and food. The performers are not typically paid, although the venue may recompense the performers with a beverage or meal. The host or MC, as an experienced professional, is usually paid for their services. The host or MC may perform at some point during the evening, either a full set or to fill in when an amateur member is not available for their slot. Open mic events are somewhat related to jam sessions, in that in both cases amateur performers are given the opportunity to sing or play instruments. The difference is that jam sessions often involve musical ensembles, possibly even a house band or rhythm section and a jam session may involve the participation of professional performers, especially at a high-end jazz club. ==Music== A musician performs open mic at No Name Bar in Sausalito, California. These shows provide an opportunity for emerging musicians to gain experience performing to a live audience without having to go through the process of getting normal music gigs, which is very difficult to do without experience or a demo recording. Open mics provide an outlet for singer-songwriters. Prior to their popularity, the only outlet generally were folk clubs, which were not always friendly towards creators of new music, preferring traditional, well-known music. They also suggested that music performed by acoustic musicians or solo artists in this manner would necessarily be folk music, a misconception that still commonly exists today. Some organizers have chosen the title \"acoustic night\" or \"acoustic club\" in an attempt to indicate an event run broadly on the lines of a folk club, but with a much wider range of musical styles. Open mic events are most commonly held in the middle of the week or at the very end of the weekend when footfall through venues is low. They rarely occur on the hallowed Friday and Saturday night time slots when venues are busy with weekend revellers and any live performance is usually specifically booked, professional artists. The most common night for a UK open mic event is Thursday, followed by Wednesday. In the United Kingdom, the largest ongoing open mic-styled music contest is Open Mic UK, which regularly attracts 10,000 participants of all genres. The grand prize for the contest is an investment up to \u00a330,000. The size of the event has necessitated that all participants sign up for performance slots beforehand, instead of simply walking onstage. Open mic blue jam, 2015 A popular open mic arrangement in the United States is the \"Blues Night\". In this format a bar or club will dedicate a particular night, usually in the middle of the week, as being \"open mic blues night\". The establishment may supply a house band, typically guitar, bass and drums, sometimes a keyboard. Singers, guitarists, harmonica performers who wish to play sign up, usually with the master-of-ceremonies or host. This person is tasked with screening the performers, choosing and ordering, and getting the performers on and off stage in a polite manner. Since the songs chosen need to be simple enough so that a band of musicians who have not played together can perform them without practice, blues standards are used. Songs might be announced as a \"12-bar fast shuffle in C\" or \"slow 12-bar blues in F\", or similar phrases, that should be familiar to all concerned. Lead singers, keyboards, horn players, (usually saxophones) and various percussion instruments are common additions. ==Comedy== Comedy, open-mic nights can be held at established comedy clubs, but they are more commonly held at other venues with or without a stage, often the upstairs or back room of a pub or bar, bookstores, colleges, rock clubs, and coffeehouses. They are also held in uncommon areas such as strip clubs and comic book shops. Open mic nights give emerging comedians the opportunity to practice stand-up comedy, something they cannot do without a live audience. The audience for a typical comedy open mic is other comedians. Those underage must have their parents attend clubs with them. More experienced comedians may use open mics as an unpaid opportunity to work out newer material or a new character. Open-mic comedy nights are most widespread in larger English- speaking cities with a well-established stand-up comedy scene (esp. London and New York City). Stand-ups also use open mics for networking to find both paid and unpaid work opportunities. ===Comedy format=== Stand-up comedy performances always use microphone and amplification as an industry standard. Open mics have no minimum requirements or experience needed to perform. The average format is \"show and go.\" In a typical open mic night, acts will get three to seven minutes of stage time. A first-time open mic-er needs approximately three minutes of material for a five-minute slot. All stand-up performed must be an original creation. An open mic should be no longer than ninety minutes or be more than fifteen acts. A comedy open mic will not normally exceed 30 people. Open mic hosts try to seat audience members close together and near the stage; a lack of close seating leads to less enjoyable shows. Performing first on an open mic roster puts the comic at a disadvantage, due to the audience being \"cold,\" and is considered the most challenging spot to perform. It is common practice for stand-ups to record their sets for later review and rehearsal. ===The light=== A comedian will get \"the light\" (often a mobile/cell-phone) one minute before their set is over, to finish up the joke they're on. Those who ignore the light might get banned from that mic. ===Other types of comedy open mics=== Other types include booked shows and bringer shows. Booked shows have a normal format, but performers reserve spots (one week to month) in advance. Bringer shows are presented in a showcase format, with each performer mandatorily bringing 5\u201315 people (with a cover charge and a two-drink minimum, per person) and is seen as exploitative. ==Poetry, rapping, and spoken word== Poetry and spoken word open mics feature a host, who is normally a poet or spoken word artist, poets and spoken word artists, and audience members. Sometimes open mic nights have featured readers, or are part of a writing workshop, but generally a sign-up sheet is available for anyone interested in participating. Each participant is then called to come to the microphone and read a selection or two. Writers may attend an open mic to try out a new piece for an audience or to find out more about the local writing community. Others attend poetry open mics just to listen. Poetry/spoken word open mics range from laid back, serene settings to lively sessions where readers and/or performers compete for audience applause. They are usually held in libraries, coffee houses, cafes, bookstores and bars. Each poet or spoken word artist is often asked to keep their performances to a minimum/specified time slot, giving each performer enough time to share some of their work with the audience. The host or MC acts as a \"gatekeeper\", determining which performers are suitable for the event. If a performer goes over their time limit, the host diplomatically thanks the performer for their contribution and asks them to yield the stage for the next performer. ==Strip club== In most strip clubs, amateur night is a contest held by the clubs themselves where women and men compete for cash by stripping just like their stripper counterparts. ==Rarer niche variations== The terms \"open deck\" (where deck refers to the kind of turntable used by a DJ) and \"open reel\" (where reel refers to a 35 mm film reel) are used for more niche open mic events where keen amateurs can meet to exhibit and critique their skills/artform. A decrease in the cost of consumer video technology combined with the powerful editing capabilities of modern PCs has caused an increase in the popularity of DJing and amateur filmmaking, but these types of events are still very rare. ==See also== *Open Mic UK (music competition in the UK, 2008\u2013) *The Raving Poets (open mic poetry with live musical backing 2000\u20132010) ==References== ==External links== * Aldredge, Marcus. \"Negotiating and Practicing Performance: An Ethnographic Study of a Musical Open Mic in Brooklyn, New York.\" * Aldredge, Marcus. 2013.
