    "text": "Donna House (born c. 1953/1954) is a Din\u00e9/Oneida Native American ethnobotanist and a contributing designer of the National Museum of the American Indian. House was born in Washington, D.C., where her father was a guard at The Pentagon, and grew up in the Navajo Nation Reservation at Oak Springs and later Fort Defiance, Arizona. She states that she is \"of the Towering House People Clan of the Din\u00e9 and Turtle Clan of the Oneida\". House was born into a family of nine children and raised by traditional Navajo values. She went to the University of Utah and became the first person from Oak Springs to graduate from university. House initially read molecular biology and wanted to become a doctor, however she then changed major to environmental science to investigate the relationships between people and the land around them. She joined The Nature Conservancy for eight years as a botanist and sought to protect native plants in the lands of Native Americans in the south-west US, especially those which were endangered but of importance to the tradition of indigenous people. This included efforts to find habitats of Kearney's blue star, one of the rarest flowers in Arizona, located on lands of the Tohono O\u02bcodham. For eleven years House was on the planning committee at the Smithsonian Institution for the construction of the National Museum of the American Indian. She represented her native nations, alongside colleagues from other tribes including Douglas Cardinal, Johnpaul Jones, Ramona Sakiestewa and Lou Weller. Her main contributions to the project included positioning the building entrance to face away from the main road and towards the East to align with the movement of the sun and elements of the solar calendar. Additionally House found and cultivated 189 native plant genera for the gardens surrounding the museum, arranged to represent four microcosms representing old habitats of the area; upland hardwood forest, eastern meadowlands, traditional croplands and lowland freshwater wetlands (a homage to Tiber Creek which runs beneath the site). All the land and seeds used were blessed before being incorporated into the construction. == References == Category:1950s births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Native Americans Category:21st-century Native Americans Category:Ethnobotanists Category:Navajo scientists Category:Oneida people Category:University of Utah alumni ",
