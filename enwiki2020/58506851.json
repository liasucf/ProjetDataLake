The script of Touching the Void was published by Faber and Faber on 6 September 2018. ==Synopsis== The play is set in 1985, on Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. It follows Joe Simpson and Simon Yates as they climb the west face of the Siula Grande, becoming the first climbers to reach the summit using the west face. Descending down the north ridge tragedy struck as Simpson slipped down an ice cliff, breaking his right leg. With Simpson incapacitated Yates lowered Simpson off the North Ridge by tying two 150-foot lengths of rope together to make one rope. With worsening conditions, frost bite and complications with the knots Yates inadvertently lowered Simpson off a cliff and Simpson accidentally dropped one of the cords required to ascend the rope. Simpson could not climb up the rope, Yates could not pull him back up, the cliff was too high for Simpson to be lowered down, and they could not communicate. Yates had to make the hard decision to cut the rope in order to save his own life. Yates cut the rope, plummeting Simpson down the cliff into a deep crevasse. Exhausted and suffering from hypothermia, Yates dug himself a snow cave to wait out the storm. Assuming Simpson was dead Yates carried on descending the mountain by himself. Simpson, however, was still alive. He had survived the 150-foot fall despite his broken leg and had landed on a small ledge inside the crevasse. When Simpson regained consciousness, he discovered that the rope had been cut and realized that Yates would presume that he was dead. He therefore had to save himself. It was impossible for Simpson to climb up to the entrance of the crevasse, therefore his only choice was to lower himself deeper into the crevasse and hope that there was another way out. After lowering himself, Simpson found another small entrance and climbed back onto the glacier via a steep snow slope. In all Simpson spent three days without food and with almost no water, crawling and hopping five miles back to their base camp. Exhausted and almost completely delirious, he reached base camp only a few hours before Yates intended to leave the base camp and return to civilisation. ==Principal roles and original cast == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Character ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Bristol Old Vic & 2018/19 tour |- ! scope=\"row\" |Joe Simpson | align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Josh Williams |- ! scope=\"row\" |Simon Yates | align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Edward Hayter |- ! scope=\"row\" |Richard | align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Patrick McNamee |- ! scope=\"row\" |Sarah | align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Fiona Hampton |- |} ==References== Category:2018 plays Category:Scottish plays Category:Plays based on novels Category:Plays based on actual events Category:West End plays ",
