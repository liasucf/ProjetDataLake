    "text": "Bulgarian law is a largely civil, as opposed to a common, law system, based on epitomes in the French and German systems. It still contains elements of Soviet legal thinking, although these are now increasingly on the wane. This makes the approach to criminal law inquisitorial as opposed to adversarial, and is generally characterised by an insistence on formality and rationalisation, as opposed to practicality and informality. Commercial law is of an increasingly excellent drafting quality and the market in Bulgarian legal services that are slower to emerge than those elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe and increasingly competitive. == See also == * Constitution of Bulgaria == References == * World Factbook of Criminal Justice Systems, * Freedom House on the effectiveness of the Bulgarian system == External links == ",
