    "text": "Visualization of intensity of aftershocks in the first few days Map of aftershocks until March 14 (first 4 days) This is a list of foreshocks and aftershocks of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake. Japan had experienced 900 aftershocks after the M9.1 earthquake on March 11, 2011 with about 60 aftershocks being over magnitude 6.0 and three over magnitude 7.0. For conciseness, only earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 7.0 or an intensity greater than lower-6 on the shindo scale are listed here. Mw refers to the moment magnitude scale, while Mjma, Mjma, or Mj refer to the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale. == Foreshocks == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Japan Time !
