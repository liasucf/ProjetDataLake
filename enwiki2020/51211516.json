    "text": "Echoes of the Tortured is the debut album by metal supergroup Sinsaenum. It was released on July 29, 2016. ==Background== Guitarist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq, who composed all music on the album and co-wrote all lyrics, had some death metal demos but his commitments to DragonForce prevented them seeing the light of day. However, he eventually showed the demos to Loudblast frontman St\u00e9phane Buriez who, along with ex-Slipknot and Murderdolls drummer Joey Jordison, founded the band. They recruited Sean Zatorsky of D\u00e5\u00e5th and Attila Csihar of Mayhem as dual lead vocalists and finally Heimoth of Seth on bass. They released their debut single and video for \"Splendor and Agony\" on July 12, 2016. They announced the release date as July 29, 2016, and released a two- song EP for streaming on June 6. Jordison described the music in an interview as \"fucking powerful\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Sinsaenum *Sean Zatorsky \u2013 vocals *Attila Csihar \u2013 vocals *Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq \u2013 guitars, bass guitar, synthesizers *St\u00e9phane Buriez \u2013 guitars *Heimoth \u2013 bass guitar *Joey Jordison \u2013 drums ;Additional personnel *Marcel Schirmer \u2013 vocals on \"Army of Chaos\" *Mirai Kawashima \u2013 vocals on \"March\" and \"Army of Chaos\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 127 |- |} ==References== Category:2016 debut albums Category:Sinsaenum albums Category:Edel AG albums Category:Albums produced by Jens Bogren ",
