    "text": "Konrad Hofmann (14 November 1819 in Kloster Banz - 30 September 1890 in Waging am See) was a German philologist, who specialized in Old French and German literature. He initially studied medicine for three years at the University of Munich, where his interests ultimately changed to philology. He then furthered his education at the universities of Erlangen, Berlin and Leipzig, receiving his doctorate in 1848 as a student of Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer. After graduation, he traveled to Paris, where he carried out research of the French Middle Ages. In 1853 he succeeded Johann Andreas Schmeller as an associate professor at Munich, becoming a full professor in 1856. In addition to his lectures on French and German philology, he also held classes in Sanskrit and paleography.ADB:Hofmann, Konrad In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB).
