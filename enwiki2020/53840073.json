It is predominantly of the 15th century. John Prichard undertook renovations in 1847. Further work was undertaken by Richard Creed in 1884-5, including the reconstruction of the top of the tower. St Teilo's is no longer an active church, the high cost of repairs leading to its closure in 2013. ==Architecture and description== The church is built of sandstone rubble, in a Decorated style. The interior contains a number of funerary monuments, including an obelisk in white marble, erected in memory of Elizabeth Jones.
