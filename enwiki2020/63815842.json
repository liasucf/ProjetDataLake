The Advisory Group was composed of 19 members \"with relevant experience, including senior leadership positions in United Nations agencies, government and international humanitarian non-governmental organizations.\" The Advisory Group was chaired by David Nabarro. For continuity, two of its members were on the subsequently-established first IAOC. The Advisory Group's final report was on the DG's desk in time for the April 2016 meeting of the WHA. WHO budgeted an additional $494 million for this programme in the first year of its operation, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. ==Executive Director== In 2019, Michael J. Ryan became Executive Director of the WHOHEP, replacing Peter Salama in an internal reshuffle. ===Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee=== The Advisory Group issued a final report from which was drawn the Term of Reference document, which the WHA agreed would be the guidance to DGWHO in the form=ation of the HEP.
