Bish\u014djo is not listed as a word in the prominent Japanese dictionary K\u014djien. A variant of the word, refers to a pretty girl before the age of adolescence. ==In manga and anime== Bish\u014djo characters are seen in almost all genres of anime and manga, especially in dating sims and visual novels (also known as bish\u014djo games), and harem anime and manga. It is sometimes confused with the similar-sounding sh\u014djo (\"girl\") demographic, but bish\u014djo refers to the gender and traits of the characters it describes, whereas sh\u014djo refers to the gender and age of an audience demographic - manga publications described as \"sh\u014djo\" are aimed at young female audiences. Although bish\u014djo is not a genre but a character design, series which predominantly feature such characters, such as harem anime and visual novels, are sometimes informally called bish\u014djo series. The characters and works referred to by the term bish\u014djo are typically intended to appeal to a male audience. Since one of the main draws of these series is typically the art and the attractive female characters, the term is occasionally perceived negatively, as a genre which is solely dependent on the marketability of cute characters rather than content or plot. This is not to be confused with bish\u014dnen - beautiful boy. It is also not to be confused with moe - which is a definition for a genre of entertainment which features cute/adorable girls rather than \"sexy\" girls. ==Contests== A televised beauty pageant, the Japan Bish\u014djo Contest, has been run since 1985. Singer Aya Ueto first became famous through this contest, at the age of twelve. Model and actress Ryoko Yonekura also won a bish\u014djo contest in 1992. ==See also== * * game * * (slang) ==References== Category:Female stock characters in anime and manga Category:Japanese slang ",
