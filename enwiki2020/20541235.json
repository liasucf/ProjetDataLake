Rather naughty I think.\" Letter from Nancy to Evelyn Waugh (, p. 391) edited by Nancy Mitford, illustrated by Osbert Lancaster, caricaturist of English manners, and published by Hamish Hamilton. The anthology comprises four brief essays by Nancy Mitford, Alan S. C. Ross, \u201cStrix\u201d and Christopher Sykes, a letter by Evelyn Waugh, and a poem by John Betjeman. Until Nancy Mitford wrote \"The English Aristocracy\" in an article published in 1955, England was blissfully unconscious of 'U' ('Upperclass') usage. Her article sparked off a public debate, whose counterblasts are collected in this book, published one year later.Nancy Mitford \u2014 Noblesse Oblige Although the subtitle rather dryly suggests it as an enquiry into the identifying characteristics of members of the English upper-class, it is really more of a debate, with each essayist entertaining and convincing. ==Overview== This collection of essays started with Nancy Mitford's article The English Aristocracy, published in 1955 in the magazine Encounter, in response to a serious academic article by the British linguist Ross (below). The expressions 'U' (upper class) and 'non-U' (non-upper class) came to prominenceDebrett's in this article, which sold out the edition of the magazine immediately after publication. The article caused a great deal of light-hearted controversy. The book was published one year later. There is sharp disagreement among the Us who have contributed to this book. Considered one of the most gifted comic writers of her time, Mitford, who had had an aristocratic upbringing along with her sisters, said she wrote the article about her peers \"In order to demonstrate the upper middle class does not merge imperceptibly into the middle class\". She said differences of speech distinguish the members of one social class in England from another. The daughter of a Baron, she was therefore an \"Hon\" \u2212 honourable. Deborah Cavendish, the Duchess of Devonshire, the youngest of the famously (and sometimes infamously) unconventional Mitford sisters, wrote a letter to EncounterQuoted by Russel Lynes, in his introduction to the first edition of Noblesse Oblige published by Harper & Brothers (1956), in the United States, p. 10 about the article saying: \"... as the co-founder, with my sister Jessica,Decca \u2014 The Letters of Jessica Mitford, Alfred A. Knop of the Hons Club, I would like to point out that ... the word Hon meant Hen in Honnish... We were very fond of chickens and on the whole preferred their company to that of human beingsLacey, Hester (18 March 2011). \"Chicken-keeping with the FT: Deborah Devonshire\". Financial Times (London). ...\". ==Reviews== Noblesse Oblige was reviewed favorably by Time magazine in May 1956: Two decades later, in its obituary upon Mitford's death, the New York Times had this to say about the book: ==Contents== ===\"The English Aristocracy\"=== Nancy Mitford writes in the first essay that the English aristocracy is the only real aristocracy left in the world today, even if it may seem to be on the verge of decadence:http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1955sep-00005 it has political power through the House of Lords and real social position through the Queen. Then she explains the order of precedence of dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, barons, members of a noble family, young sons, baronets, knights and knights of the Garter. Accused of being a snob, she quotes from Professor Alan Ross of Birmingham University who points out that \u201cit is solely by their language that the upper classes nowadays are distinguished since they are neither cleaner, richer, nor better-educated than anybody else\". Miss Mitford says Professor Ross invented the U and non-U English useful formula. Though she doesn't agree completely with the Professor's list, she adopts his classification system, and adds a few suggestions of her own.\"A Penguin a Week \u2014 A blog about vintage Penguin paperbacks\" She gives many examples of U and non-U usage and thoroughly explains the aristocracy saying, for example, dukes are rather new creations, the purpose of the aristocrat is most emphatically not to work for money, and nobility in England is based on title and not on bloodline. The ancestors of the lords spent months abroad, buying pictures and statues, which they cheerfully sell in order to spend months abroad, she writes. ===\"U and Non-U \u2014 An Essay in Sociological Linguistics\" by Alan S. C. Ross=== The second article is a condensed and simplified version of Professor Ross\u2019 \"Linguistic Class-Indicators in Present-Day English\",An Essay in Sociological Linguistics by Alan S. C. Ross \u2014 Encounter, November 1955 which appeared in 1954 in the Finnish philological periodical Neuphilologische Mitteilungen. For him the English class-system was essentially tripartite \u2014 there exists an upper, a middle, and a lower class. Solely by its language it is possible to identify them. In times past (e.g. in the Victorian and Edwardian periods) this was not the case. In fact the Professor says there are, it is true, a few minor points of life which may serve to demarcate the upper class, but they are minor ones, and he is concerned in this essay only with the linguistic demarcation.\"A U and non-U exchange of the upper class\". The Independent on Sunday. 5 June 1994. This line, for the Professor, is, often, a line between, on one hand, gentlemen and, on the other, persons who, though not gentlemen, must at first sight appear, or would like to appear, as such. Thus, habits of speech peculiar to the lower classes find no place in this article. He also addresses the written language, considering the following points: names on envelopes, etc., beginning of letters, names on cards, postal addresses on envelopes, etc. at the heads of letters, and on cards; finally, letter-endings. ===\"An open letter\" by Evelyn Waugh=== Evelyn Waugh wrote the third contribution, An open letter to the Honble Mrs. Peter Rodd (Nancy Mitford) on a very serious subject from Evelyn Waugh, which also first appeared in Encounter.Encounter, December 1955 Widely regarded as a master of style of the 20th century, Waugh, who was a great friend of Nancy Mitford,\"The Letters of Nancy Mitford and Evelyn Waugh\". The New York Times. added his own thoughts to the class debate and points out that Nancy is a delightful trouble maker to write such a thing but also someone who only just managed to be upper class and now resides in another country, so \u2014 he asks \u2014 who is she really to even bring it all up?Brogan, Denis W. The Saturday Review. 28 July 1956. p. 17. Although this may seem offensive, Nancy Mitford said that \"everything with Evelyn Waugh was jokes. Everything. That's what none of the people who wrote about him seem to have taken into account at all\".Nancy Mitford in a television interview. Quoted in Byrne, p. 348. ===\"Posh Lingo\" by \u201cStrix\u201d=== A shorter version of \u201cStrix's\u201d article appeared in The Spectator and this is the fourth essay of the book. \u201cStrix\u201d, pseudonym of Peter Fleming,Mitford, 1956 \u2014The University of Hull was a British adventurer and travel writer, who was James Bond author Ian Fleming\u2019s elder brother and a friend of Nancy. He begins saying that Nancy Mitford's article has given rise to much pleasurable discussion. Before pushing on to the less etymological aspects of her theme, he addresses how language evolves and changes naturally,Savidge Reads and U-slang, attributing to it a sense of parody. He says interest in the study of U-speech has been arbitrarily awakened and considers this interest unhealthy and contrary to the \"national interest\". He closes his article hoping (ironically) that the U-young will strive for a clear, classless medium of communication in which all say \"Pardon?\" and none say \"What?\", and every ball is a dance and every man's wife is \"the\" wife, but then saying that he will be surprised and disappointed if they do anything of the sort. ===\"What U-Future?\" by Christopher Sykes=== All groups talk a particular language. Thus begins the fifth essay of the book. It is the natural way of things that you say something one way which the lawyer says another way. Same with doctors. A doctor who can only talk like a text book may leave you in serious doubt as to your state of health, Sykes says. Same with sailors, same with all other craftsmen. Then he comments from Shakespeare, for whom language was a vast instrument at his command, to what he calls the irrational little vocabulary of the movements of fashion: newspaper fashion, pub fashion, cinema fashion, popular song fashion. But, for this English author, the great, the most desired fashion has always been that of \u201cthe best society,\u201d of \u201cthe fashionable\u201d, of \u201cthe chic\u201d, which is kept by snobbism. After further analyzing the use of U and non-U habits and its progress, reflecting either by stress or reaction the mood of any time. Pursuing his argument he introduces Topivity \u2014 T-manners and T-customsNoblesse Oblige, Harper & Brothers (1956), Published in the United States, First Edition \u2014 What U-Future? pp. 150-156 etc., meaning the likely social conventions of a remote future in which the peerage has survived by infiltrating the trade union movement on a large scale. Abandoning \"U\", he ends the article with \"T\" stating that one big T-point remains constant: nobody wants a really poor peer: it is very un-T not to be rich. However, T and non-T do not seem to have become popular though. ===\"How to Get on in Society\" by John Betjeman=== The last essay of Noblesse Oblige is a poem taken from A Few Late Chrystanthemums. ==See also== *Noblesse oblige *U and non-U English * Decca; The Letters of Jessica Mitford, Alfred A.
