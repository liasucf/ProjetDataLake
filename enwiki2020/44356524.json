    "text": "The Terra Nova locomotive is a diesel-mechanical locomotive used mainly for heavy shunting operations and light line service. It is produced at Electroputere VFU-Reloc Craiova, Romania and it had its official launching in May 2014, having 4 axles and the possibility to be adapted to all types of gauges.https://www.romania-insider.com/american-caterpillar-builds-new- locomotive-in-romania-with-local-group-grampet-mainly-for-export/122359/ ==History== SC. RELOC SA and Electroputere VFU became part of Grampet Group in 2013, being responsible for the part of construction of new innovative locomotives, research, design of new products and sustainable technologies, but also repairing, manufacturing, modernization of existing locomotives. Since 2014, it has started to produce the Terra Nova locomotive, its future plans for 2015-2018 being to build a new 2500 HP diesel electric locomotive and a new 6500 kW electric locomotive. ==Technology== The Terra Nova locomotive is a 1260 horsepower machine powered by 2 x Cat C18 Engines of 630 HP each with Cat TR43 Locomotive Transmission packages being able to provide a tractive effort of 230 kN. Built for short-line (20\u201330 miles) railroad operations or shunting procedures, the Terra Nova is ideal for making line switches and organizing cars within a rail yard. Cat engines and transmissions are worldwide known for their reliability, efficiency, and environmental friendliness, Terra Nova being thus an innovative product which can deliver both increased tractive effort and low consumption of resources, making it compatible with different working environments and tailored on the needs of the customers. It is a versatile locomotive and was designed to run on narrow gauge, medium and large railways, being easily adaptable to different markets and operating conditions depending on specific characteristics. The production line for this locomotive can be configured. In this respect, it will be available in different versions. On the basis of the quality, circulation safety and environmental protection imposed by this industrial market, Terra Nova will be manufactured under different levels of performance, gauge, price versions and electronic equipment. Using technology from Caterpillar for the motorization and electronic control of the consumption of fuel and oil, the level of resources used is thus kept at a minimum being adapted to the activities conducted, but in the same time delivering high traction performances. It is fitted with a start-stop system which ensures an even more efficient use of resources, electronic systems for monitoring and control, accessory operating system, centralized informatics systems for commanding and diagnosis. The ergonomically and modern driving post enables easy reach of all technical equipments, delivering a comfortable and safe operation. The locomotive has all the necessary equipments mounted in the driver`s cabin, however, a large variety of optional equipment is available for fixing according to the needs of the customers. It is fitted with two diesel engines and two transmissions, which means that it can adjust the delivery of power according to the tractive effort which needs to be generated. For light loads, one engine can be used for optimum fuel economy. If the locomotive comes to a steep grade, the second engine can be turned on and the transmission is engaged before losing speed. The locomotive incorporates eight wheel drive to eliminate wheel slip for most operating conditions. Having two engines, it can easily adapt its traction force depending on the number of handled tones, the distance travelled, but at the same time having an efficient consumption and low CO2 emissions. Moreover, its manufacturing can be easily adapted to all types of gauges to be able to service a multitude of markets. The Terra Nova engine incorporates green sustainable technologies which deliver low and efficient consumption of resources, the filters and technologies used enabling a reduced level of pollution in line with European Standards for Environmental Protection. The Terra Nova locomotive participated at 2014 edition of Innotrans Berlin Fair, the largest exhibition of rolling stock worldwide, attracting approx. 6 million visitors. == References == == External links == * Caterpillar Official Site * mainlinediesel.net * Romania Insider * think- railways.com * railwaypro * railwaygazette Category:Diesel locomotives Category:Locomotives of Romania Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 2014 ",
