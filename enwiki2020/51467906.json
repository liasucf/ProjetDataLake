By the evening of 30 August, the rebels also managed to seize the town of Taybat al-Imam, as well as two other nearby villages. The next day, the rebels managed to enter the town of Suran, but were subsequently pushed back after failing to capture the town's center. However, four hours later, a second rebel attack was launched which ultimately ended in the rebel capture of Suran.
