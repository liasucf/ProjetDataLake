Ferraro and John Veneziano, Triumph Books, Chicago, Illinois, 2007, The Saints were 11-point favorites before the game, and fans booed as the Buccaneers scored. \"Eleven years I've supported this franchise!\" one shouted, adding, \"With all this money I've spent on this lousy team I could have bought some land in Colombia and raised pot\". Losing to a team with a 0-26 losing streak was so humiliating that safety Tom Myers said, \"We've been made the laughingstocks of the business ... I'm too embarrassed to say that I play for the team that got beat by Tampa Bay\". Said head coach Hank Stram, \"We're all very ashamed of what happened today.
