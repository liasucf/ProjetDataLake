    "text": "George Solomon is a former sports editor and columnist at The Washington Post and was the first ombudsman for ESPN. Solomon is a 1963 graduate of the University of Florida. He began working at the Post in 1972. He served as assistant managing editor for sports from 1975 to 2003. From 2003 to his retirement, he was an assistant editor for the paper. He continues writing a weekly Sunday column for the paper. As ESPN's ombudsman, Solomon has been open about several potential conflicts of interest he may have. His son, Aaron Solomon, is a producer for ESPN's panel show Around the Horn. Pardon the Interruption co-hosts Michael Wilbon and Tony Kornheiser, World Series of Poker announcer Norman Chad, and reporters Rachel Nichols and Ric Bucher all were co-workers of Solomon's during his time at the Post. As ESPN's ombudsman, Solomon has notably criticized the network for airing Bonds on Bonds, a reality series on Barry Bonds in which the controversial baseball player was able to exercise some creative control, for devoting too much coverage to the actions of controversial wide receiver Terrell Owens, for not making clear the difference between commentary and reporting on their shows, and for generally having too much sensationalism and not enough journalism in their stories. He has also defended the network's choice of games to broadcast and their coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was criticized by many soccer fans. Solomon stepped down from this position at the end of his contract. On April 1, 2007, Le Anne Schreiber, a former sports editor of The New York Times, became the new ombudsman for ESPN and will serve a fixed two-year term. He edited Shirley Povich's book All Those Mornings at the Post. Beginning in 2003, Solomon has taught Sports journalism classes at the University of Maryland, College Park. Also in 2003, Solomon was honored by the Associated Press Sports Editors, who awarded him the Red Smith Award, which is America\u2019s most prestigious sports writing honor. == Notes == Category:American sportswriters Category:ESPN.com Category:Living people Category:Red Smith Award recipients Category:The Washington Post journalists Category:University of Florida alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:University of Maryland, College Park faculty ",
