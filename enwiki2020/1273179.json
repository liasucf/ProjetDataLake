    "text": "televised Christmas Message, broadcast in 1957 The Queen's Christmas Message (also known as The King's Christmas Message in the reign of a male monarch, formally as Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech) is a broadcast made by the sovereign of the Commonwealth realms to the Commonwealth of Nations each Christmas. The tradition began in 1932 with a radio broadcast by King George V on the British Broadcasting Corporation's Empire Service. Since 1952, the message has been read by Elizabeth II; today, it is broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet via various providers. ==History== George V giving the 1934 Royal Christmas Message The idea for a Christmas message from the sovereign to the British Empire was first proposed by the \"founding father\" of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), John Reith, in 1922 when he approached King George V about making a short broadcast on the newly created radio service. The King declined, however, believing that radio was mainly an entertainment. Reith approached the King again ten years later, in 1932, as a way to inaugurate the Empire Service (now the World Service) and the King finally agreed after being encouraged to do so by Queen Mary and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. That year, George V read the first Royal Christmas Message; the King was originally hesitant about using the relatively untested medium of radio, but was reassured after a summertime visit to the BBC and agreed to carry out the concept and read the speech from a temporary studio set up at Sandringham House. The broadcast was introduced from Ilmington Manor by 65-year-old Walton Handy, a local shepherd, with carols from the church choir and the bells ringing from the town church, and reached an estimated 20 million people in Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, South Africa and the United Kingdom. While his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated just before his first Christmas as king, George VI continued his father's Christmas broadcasts; it was in his 1939 reading delivered in the opening stages of the Second World War that he uttered the famous lines: \"I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year.\" For many years, the King's speech came at the end of an hour- long broadcast of greeting from various parts of the British Empire and Commonwealth which typically included interviews with ordinary people of many occupations such as an innkeeper in an English village, a minder in South Africa, and a lifeguard in Australia with the King's speech serving as a bond tying the Commonwealth together. George's daughter and successor, Elizabeth II, gave her first Christmas message to the Commonwealth of Nations from her study at Sandringham House, at 3:07 PM on 25 December 1952, some 11 months after her father's death. Five years later, the tradition was first broadcast on television and, from then until 1996, was produced by the BBC; only in 1969 was no message given because a special documentary film, Royal Family, had been made during the summer in connection with the investiture of the Prince of Wales. It was therefore decided not to do a broadcast at Christmas, but the Queen issued a written message instead. The Queen ended this monopoly, however, announcing that the message would, from 1997, be produced and broadcast alternately by the BBC and its main rival, Independent Television News (ITN), with a biennial rotation. It was reported by The Daily Telegraph that this decision was made after the BBC decided to screen an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, on its current affairs programme Panorama. This was denied by Buckingham Palace which said the new arrangements \"reflect the composition of the television and radio industries today\". Beginning in 2011, Sky News was added to the rotation. Sky News recorded the Queen's Christmas message for Christmas 2012, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year, and for the first time it has been recorded in 3D. Buckingham Palace are reported to have explained: \"We wanted to do something a bit different and special in this Jubilee year, so doing it for the first time in 3D seemed a good thing, technology wise, to do.\" The themes and direction of the speech are decided by the Queen and the text is largely written by the Queen herself, sometimes with assistance from Prince Philip and her staff. In recent years, the speech has become more personal and religious in tone. ==Broadcast== The message typically combines a chronicle of that year's major events, with specific focus on the British Empire originally and later the Commonwealth of Nations, with the sovereign's own personal milestones and feelings on Christmas. It is one of the few instances when the sovereign speaks publicly without advice from any ministers of the Crown in any of the monarch's realms. Planning for each year's address begins months earlier, when the monarch establishes a theme and appropriate archival footage is collected and assembled; the actual speech is recorded a few days prior to Christmas. In the United Kingdom and on the Internet, broadcast of the Queen's Christmas message is embargoed until 15:00 GMT on 25 December. In other parts of the Commonwealth, the message is first broadcast in New Zealand at 18:06 local time by Radio New Zealand on RNZ National, then again at 18:50 by Television New Zealand on TVNZ1, in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 15:20 local time, and in Canada by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at noon local time on television, 14:50 local time on CBC Radio One and CBC Music. Outside of the Commonwealth, C-SPAN in the United States also airs the Queen's Message although the times that the message airs can vary, depending on C-SPAN's schedule. No US radio station airs the broadcast, although some bordering areas in Canada can also receive the message via the CBC. ==Messages== ===George V=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:88%;\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\" | Broadcast partner |- | 1932 | Written by Rudyard Kipling, the speech touched on the advance of technology that permitted the King to deliver an intimate message to all parts of the world, as well as mentioning the need for work towards peace and counselling listeners to aim for \"prosperity without self-seeking.\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"4\" | BBC |- | 1933 | In his second Christmas address, George V expressed his gratitude to his subjects for their Christmas greetings and reassured listeners that \"the past year has shown much progress towards world recovery [from the Great Depression] and the setting in order of our respective communities\" and spoke of his \"hope and confidence\" for the future. He also spoke of the improvements in worldwide communications brought by technology and the benefits that brings in dealing with problems in a timely fashion. |- | 1934 | King George V spoke of the British Empire as being \"bound to me and to one another by a spirit of one great family\" and of how he and Queen Mary were moved by the way \"this spirt was manifested\" at the marriage that year of his son, the Duke of Kent and Princess Marina. He added, in reference to the ongoing economic and international political crises of the decade, that he wished this spirit within the Empire would deepen and widen in response to a restless world adding that \"The clouds are lifting, but we have still our own anxieties to meet. I am convinced that if we meet them in the spirit of one family we shall overcome them.\" He also referred to the importance of the emerging Dominions within the Empire asserting that \"Through them the family has become a commonwealth of free nations, and they have carried into their homes the memories and traditions of the Mother Country.\" He also addressed the growing demands for Indian independence by assuring the people of British India \"of my constant care, and I desire that they will all fully realise and value their own place in the unity of the one family.\" |- | 1935 | The speech mentioned the King's 25th anniversary of his accession to the throne and his place as a personal link between his peoples, as well as the marriage of his son, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and the death of his sister, Princess Victoria. He also referred to his desire for peace and goodwill among all nations saying this will also bring a solution to the Great Depression economic troubles of the period. The King offered his sympathy to all those in the Empire suffering personal distress and also called for hope and cheer united by the bonds of service which would give people the resoluteness needed to overcome their difficulties. |} ===George VI=== ====1930s==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:88%;\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\" | Broadcast partner |- | 1936 | No message was delivered.

George VI said he could not aspire to replace his father's broadcasts but that nevertheless, as this was his first Christmas as King, he thanked the Empire for its support and loyalty during his first year on the throne. He expressed his pledge to be worthy of his subjects' support. Looking back on 1937, he noted the \"shadows of enmity and of fear\" hanging over parts of the world and expressed his hope that the spirit of peace and goodwill shall prevail. | style=\"text-align: center;\" | BBC |- | 1938 | No message was delivered. | |- | 1939 | Delivering his message on the first Christmas of the Second World War the King spoke live from Sandringham House to offer a message of reassurance. He spoke of Christmas as a festival of peace and lamented that \"it is the tragedy of this time that there are powerful countries whose whole direction and policy are based on aggression and the suppression of all that we hold dear for mankind.\" He continued, saying: \"It is this that has stirred our peoples and given them a unity unknown in any previous war. We feel in our hearts that we are fighting against wickedness, and this conviction will give us strength from day to day to persevere until victory is assured.\" He spoke of his pride in the Royal Navy's courage and devotion in its battles in the first months of the war as well as the courage of the merchant marine. He also expressed thanks to the British Expeditionary Force and other armies of the Empire saying that \"Their task is hard. They are waiting, and waiting is a trial of nerve and discipline. But I know that when the moment comes for action they will prove themselves worthy of the highest traditions of their great Service.\" He referred to the nations and colonies of the Empire as a \"Family of Nations which is prepared to sacrifice everything that freedom of spirit may be saved to the world\" and referred to the assistance Britain has received from the rest of the Empire. George VI referred to \"the cause of Christian civilisation\" as what unites the Empire and its Allies, adding that \"On no other basis can a true civilisation be built.\" He concluded with words of encouragement from the poem God Knows by Minnie Louise Haskins: 'I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, \"Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.\" And he replied, \"Go out into the darkness, and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light, and safer than a known way.\"' | style=\"text-align: center;\" | BBC |} ====1940s==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:88%;\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\" | Broadcast partner |- | 1940 | King George spoke of separation and unity: the sadness brought by separation during wartime for members of the Armed Forces and their families and for British families whose children were evacuated overseas to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States and the unity brought by facing common perils and suffering at home and at the front by civilians and military alike and of the fellowship springing up among the British people in the face of adversity and of his hopes that this newfound spirit of unity a fellowship will continue into peacetime and among all the nations of the world. | style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"10\" | BBC |- | 1941 | The King focused on our \"one great family,\" stating: \"[it is] in serving each other and in sacrificing for our common good that we are finding our true life.\" He spoke of \"the men who in every part of the world are serving the Empire and its cause with such valour and devotion by sea, land and in the air\" as well as the women \"who at the call of duty have left their homes to join the services, or to work in factory, hospital or field\" and also remembered the suffering of the wounded, bereaved and prisoners of war and his confidence that the service and sacrifice of the British people for the sake of the common good will win the war and a lasting peace and called on the people to go into the coming year with courage, strength and good heart to overcome the perils that lie ahead. |- | 1942 | The King spoke of the confidence given him by recent Allied military victories and of the contributions by the United States and the Soviet Union in the war against Nazi Germany as well as by Americans and Australians in the Pacific Theatre against Japan. He also spoke to the mobilization of the Indian people against the threat of Japanese invasion and of other outposts of the British Empire, speaking directly to British forces serving there referring to the \"Commonwealth of Nations as a \"family circle, whose ties, precious in peaceful years, have been knit even closer by danger.\" He also spoke to those who have lost loved ones or been parted from them and of his and the Queen's feelings of sorrow, comfort, and also pride. He referred as well to his visits across the country witnessing the increase in agricultural production for the war effort and his thankfulness to and admiration of those who work the land. He also spoke of the foreign government leaders and officials who have sought refuge in Britain and called on them to be welcomed in the spirit of brotherhood. |- | 1943 |On behalf of himself and the Queen, King George sent greetings and good wishes to \"each one of you all the world over\", to those serving in the military around the world, those wounded lying in hospital, as well as civilians at work or at home and remarked that the thoughts or all are in \"distant places\" and their hearts are with the ones they love. The King also spoke of his thanks for the victories of the past year and his thankfulness for the contribution of the United States, the Soviet Union and China and of the unity of the \"United Nations\" (the Allies) as well as his thoughts for France and occupied lands. He also spoke of the spirit of the people saying \"We know that much hard working, and hard fighting \u2013 perhaps harder working and harder fighting than ever before \u2013 are necessary for victory. We shall not rest from our task until it is nobly ended.\" |- | 1944 |The King spoke of hope in his message saying that \"the lamps which the Germans had put out all over Europe were being rekindled and were beginning to shine through the fog of war.\" He added that \"at this Christmas time we think proudly and gratefully of our fighting men wherever they may be. May God bless and protect them and bring them victory\" adding as well his good wishes to the sick and wounded in hospital and the medical staff caring for them, and of prisoners of war and the relatives at home waiting for them to return. He also spoke of the hard work and sacrifice of people throughout the Empire who have helped bring victory nearer and of the goal of creating after the war \"a world of free men, untouched by tyranny.\" |- | 1945 | He said that although much of great price had been given up to attain victory, that which had been saved was beyond value and that the vision of world peace he had spoken of in previous broadcasts during the war had become a reality. |- | 1946 | The King reviewed the privations of the war years, the difficulties of postwar adjustment, and added words of encouragement to his subjects, and advised patience saying -\"We cannot expect the world, so grievously wounded, to recover quickly, but its convalescence can certainly be hastened by our continued endurance and goodwill\" adding that though the previous year due to shortages and the burdens of post-war reconstruction had not been easy \"Better days lie ahead and our task is to mobilise the Christmas spirit and apply its power of healing to our daily life.\" |- | 1947 | The King stated that \"the unity and steadfastness of the British Commonwealth and Empire saved the liberties of the world\" and called on listeners to remember that and not to doubt their \"power and will to win through\" in the face of post-war challenges and adversity. |- | 1948 | King George VI delivered his Christmas message from Buckingham Palace for the first time as he was unable to travel outside London, to his Sandringham retreat, due to ill health. He recalled that the year had seen the silver anniversary of his marriage to his consort as well as the birth of his grandson, Prince Charles. He also spoke of his illness and his regret at having to cancel a planned tour of Australia and New Zealand as a result. He referred to the \"evolution\" of the British Commonwealth and his pride at its \"widening the bounds of freedom wherever our people live.\" |- | 1949 | The King reassured people of his recovery from illness and expressed his gratitude to the United States of America for its sympathy and help in Britain's effort towards recovery; at the time, Britain was the largest beneficiary of the Marshall Plan. |} ====1950s==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:88%;\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\" | Broadcast partner |- | 1950 | With the deepening Cold War, the Korean War, Malayan Emergency as well as the risk posed by thermonuclear weapons, the King spoke of \"the grim shadow of war\" hanging over the world. He took as the theme of his message John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, its story of going forward, only to fall back while keeping \"our eyes fixed on the far-off, delectable mountains of peace and good will\" as took from the book the motto \"Whatever comes or does not come. I'll not be afraid\" and the need for each individual to bear his burden, even if it seems insurmountable. The King also expressed his wish for peace saying \"if our world is to survive in any sense that makes survival worthwhile, it must learn to love and not to hate, and to create and not destroy\" warning that mankind must choose between these two paths. | style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\" | BBC |- | 1951 | George VI's final Christmas message was the only broadcast that he pre-recorded, as he had recently undergone lung surgery. He spoke of his recovery and the goodwill messages he had received: \"From my peoples in these islands and in the British Commonwealth and Empireas well as from many other countriesthis support and sympathy has reached me and I thank you now from my heart...\" |} ===Elizabeth II=== ====1950s==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:88%;\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\" | Broadcast partner |- | 1952 | In her first Christmas message, from the same desk and chair used by her father and grandfather before her, the Queen spoke of carrying on the tradition of Christmas broadcasts passed on to her by George V and George VI and said she would strive to carry on their work to unite the peoples of the Empire and maintain their ideals and thanked her people for their loyalty and affection in the first months of her reign. She also referred to the British Commonwealth and Empire as an \"immense union of nations\" that was like a family and which \"can be a great power for good \u2013 a force which I believe can be of immeasurable benefit to all humanity\". This message, and the ones until 1957, were simulcast on television in sound only in the United Kingdom. | style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"8\" | BBC |- | 1953 | This message was broadcast from Auckland, New Zealand, during the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's six-month royal tour of the Commonwealth and spoke of her trip so far and what she hoped to learn and accomplish from the tour. The Queen referred to the Crown as a \"personal and loving bond\" between herself and her people and spoke of feeling at home in Auckland despite its distance from London. She spoke of the Commonwealth as a \"fellowship\" which bears no resemblance to the empires of the past and in which Britain is but an equal partner. She finished the broadcast with a note of sympathy to those affected by the Tangiwai disaster the night before. |- | 1954 | The Queen broadcast this message from Sandringham House at the end of a year in which she and her husband, The Duke of Edinburgh, had travelled around the world. |- | 1955 | Broadcast live from her study at Sandringham House, the Queen's theme was the opportunities arising from membership of the Commonwealth of Nations. With the launch of ITV in the UK, the sound-only television broadcast was simulcast on both ITV and the BBC Television Service from this year on. |- | 1956 | The Duke of Edinburgh spoke from HMY Britannia during a voyage around the Commonwealth before the Queen made her speech live from Sandringham House in which she referred to the Duke's message as the one that gave her and her children the greatest joy listening to and wished him a good journey before expressing her sadness at being separated from him. She also expressed her sympathies to those who, unlike her, do not enjoy a united family or cannot be at home for Christmas or who are alone or have been driven from home and asked listeners to think especially of those who have been driven from their homelands by war or violence, refugees, asking that they be given true refuge and, in a reference to the story of Christ's birth, be given room at the inn. As in previous messages, she compared the Commonwealth to a family in which, despite its differences, \"for the sake of ultimate harmony, the healing power of tolerance, comradeship and love must be allowed to play its part.\" The broadcast was criticised for the Queen's continued refusal to have it televised and for having \"too many ponderous platitudes written into it by her officials\" and for presenting \"a false picture of the Commonwealth as one big happy British family \u2013 all Anglo-Saxons under the skin.\" |- | 1957 | This year's message, read from the Long Library at Sandringham House, was the first to be televised and was also the 25th anniversary of the first Christmas broadcast on radio. The Queen noted the milestone and the advance of technology that allowed her message to be viewed in her subjects' homes. She added that while change might be bewildering, it is important to hold on to ageless ideals and values such as the importance of religion, morality, honesty and self-restraint and spoke of the need for courage to stand up for what is right, true and honest. During this season freak radio conditions caused by sunspots resulted in American police radio transmissions interfering with British television broadcasts. One occasion of interference occurred during the Queen's speech, causing listeners to hear an American police officer say, \"Joe, I'm gonna grab a quick coffee.\" |- | 1958 | The reading, coming from the Long Library at Sandringham House, focused on the importance of spiritual and family values and some of the journeys soon to be made around the Commonwealth by the Queen and members of the Royal Family. The Queen also responded to requests that her children be shown in the broadcast by saying that after a great deal of thought she and her husband decided against it as they want their children to grow up as naturally as possible. This was the final Christmas message to be delivered live. |- | 1959 | The Queen pre- recorded her Christmas message for the first time. The message was filmed in Buckingham Palace a week prior to broadcast and lasted about one minute. It conveyed the Queen's best wishes and her gratitude for the warm wishes she had received. Being pre-recorded allowed the message to be shipped abroad in advance and to be broadcast in Australia and New Zealand on Christmas Day for the first time as time differences and the International Date Line meant that many previous live broadcasts were actually heard on Boxing Day in Australia and New Zealand. As a result of the success of the recording, all subsequent Christmas messages have also been pre-recorded. |} ====1960s==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:88%;\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\" | Broadcast partner |- | 1960 | The Queen spoke from Buckingham Palace and described an eventful year in which she gave birth to Prince Andrew; her sister, Princess Margaret, married Anthony Armstrong-Jones; and Nigeria gained its independence while remaining part of the Commonwealth.

The Queen's written message acknowledged the end of the 1960s and the decade's significance for being the time when men first walked on the moon. She also stated that she was looking forward to her visit the next year to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga and northern Canada. She also expressed her concern that \"the lonely, the sick and the elderly\" all feel the warmth and companionship of Christmas. | |} ====1970s==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:88%;\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\" | Broadcast partner |- | 1970 | Once again televised, the speech recounted some of the trips made by the Queen during the year; it included film shot in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. | style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"10\" | BBC |- | 1971 | Focusing on the theme of families, the television version showed Prince Andrew and Prince Edward looking at a family photograph album. |- | 1972 | The production included scenes from the celebration of the Queen's 25 years of marriage to The Duke of Edinburgh and Elizabeth mentioned the violence in Northern Ireland, as well as the preparations for Britain to join the European Economic Community. |- | 1973 | Interspersed with footage of the Queen giving her oration was film shot during the wedding of the Queen's daughter, Princess Anne, to Captain Mark Phillips. |- | 1974 | In a more sombre tone, the Christmas message alluded to problems such as the continuing violence in Northern Ireland and the Middle East, that year's famine in Bangladesh, and the floods in Brisbane, Australia. |- | 1975 | Broadcast from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, it was the first time the message had been recorded outdoors, and acknowledged a year of record inflation and unemployment in the UK and worldwide. |- | 1976 | To mark the United States Bicentennial, the Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh undertook a state visit to the United States of America; that visit, and the theme of reconciliation after disagreements, formed the focus of the message. |- | 1977 | The Queen recalled the year's celebrations for her Silver Jubilee, and expressed hope for reconciliation in Northern Ireland, where she had visited in August for the first time in 11 years. |- | 1978 | The future was the subject selected by the Queen, with the broadcast including footage of her with her new grandson, Peter Phillips, and Princess Anne, as well as recordings of earlier broadcasts going back to George V. |- | 1979 | 1979 was the Year of the Child, and the Christmas message addressed the theme of children and young people.
