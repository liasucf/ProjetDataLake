    "text": "Lewis Thornet Bandt (26 February 1910 \u2013 18 March 1987) was an Australian car designer, most famous for designing and building the first ute (coup\u00e9 utility) cars in the 1930s. ==Early life== Bandt was born the eldest of five children in the South Australian town of Moonta. The family moved to Adelaide after World War I, and in 1924 he began a fitting and turning apprenticeship with Duncan & Fraser Ltd who specialised in modifying Model T Fords. He moved to Victoria in 1927 and worked for the Melbourne Motor Body & Assembling Company. In 1929 he moved to the Ford factory in Geelong as the subsidiary's first designer. ==Ute design== The design of the ute was a result of a 1932 letter from an unnamed Victorian farmer's wife asking for \"a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays\". In response, Bandt developed the ute and the model called a \"coupe utility\" at the time was released in 1934. When the Australian version was displayed in the US, Henry Ford nicknamed it the \"Kangaroo Chaser\". A convertible version, known as the roadster utility was produced in limited numbers by Ford in the 1930s.http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/history/history.html ==Later career== During World War II, Bandt helped to design long-range fuel tanks for Spitfire and Thunderbolt fighter planes. He also worked on design innovations for the UK-sourced Ford Zephyr, the 1967 Australian Ford Fairlane, and the never- approved Falcon convertible, of which six were built outside Ford in 1962. ==Personal life== Bandt married Nellie Rowe on 6 September 1941. He was a lifelong member of the Methodist (later Uniting) Church. He was known for his charity work. Lewis and Nellie had three daughters: Sylvia, Val and Ros. Later in life he also had four grandchildren: Brad, Tate, Eden and Joe. He was an accomplished artist, and painted Ford\u2019s nativity scene at Christmas. He retired in 1975. ==Death== Bandt was killed on 18 March 1987, while coming home from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation television studios where he had been recording a documentary about the ute. He was driving a 1934 model home when he collided with a truck near Bannockburn. He was survived by his wife and three daughters. In 2008, the Lewis Bandt Bridge was opened and named in his honour. ==References== Category:20th-century Australian engineers Category:1910 births Category:1987 deaths ",
