Guest contributors include novelist Merrill Garbus, Glen Hansard, Michael Ondaatje, Beth Orton, and members of the McGarrigle and Wainwright families. \"Around the Bend\" is the album's lead single. ==Composition== Wainwright has said about the writers who contributed to the album: \"Because these writers know me and because I was able to personalize these songs by changing things here and there, I made them feel as if I wrote them myself. Somehow they wonderfully reflect my life and I am so thankful to the other artists for writing them.\" ==Track listing== All tracks written by Martha Wainwright, except where noted. # \"Around the Bend\" # \"Franci\" # \"Traveller\" # \"Look into My Eyes\" (Lily Lanken, Anna McGarrigle, M.
