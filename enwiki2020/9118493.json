    "text": "The National Opera Studio in London, England was established in 1977 by the Arts Council as a link between the music colleges and the six main UK opera companies. It was resident at Morley College in Lambeth until 2003, when it gained use for the first time of its own dedicated premises in Chapel Yard, Wandsworth. Former directors are Kathryn Harries, Donald Maxwell, Richard van Allen, and Michael Langdon, and its Head of Music is Mark Shanahan. It is responsible for the training of approximately twelve singers each academic year, as well as four piano r\u00e9p\u00e9titeurs. Its funding comes in part from the six main UK opera companies Royal Opera House, English National Opera, Welsh National Opera, Scottish Opera, Opera North and the Glyndebourne Festival Opera, and it is an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation (2018\u20132022). Representatives from each company sit on the final audition panel for selection of each year's intake. The nine-month course usually includes residencies at three of the national opera companies, as well as opera scenes performances in London throughout the year. ==Notable alumni== *Peter Auty *Barry Banks *Jeffrey Black *Alfie Boe *Ivor Bolton *Susan Bullock *Alice Coote *Wynne Evans *Richard Farnes *Gerald Finley *Catherine Foster *Lesley Garrett *Lisa Gasteen *Julian Gavin *Carl Gombrich *Susan Gritton *Alison Hagley *Buddug Verona James *Philip Joll *Paul Carey Jones *Katarina Karn\u00e9us *Marie McLaughlin *Jean Rigby *Kate Royal *Claire Rutter *William Shimell *Hilary Summers *Jeremy Huw Williams ==Other notable alumni== *Marie Arnet *Clive Bailey *Kim Begley *Matthew Best *Cora Burggraaf *Elizabeth Byrne *Bruno Caproni *Karen Cargill *Ashley Catling *John S.
