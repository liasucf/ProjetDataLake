    "text": "In the Mormon Book of Abraham, Pharaoh is the proper name of the first king of Egypt.Abraham 1:20\u201331: Pharaoh, King of Egypt, The Pearl of Great Price: Teacher Manual, (2000), 39\u201340 According to the story, all Egyptians descended from him (Abraham 1:22). He was the eldest son of Egyptus, who was the daughter of Ham and Egyptus. Pharaoh was a descendant of the Canaanites (Abraham 1:22), a race of people who had been cursed with black skin (Moses 7:8). Mormon leaders have taught that he inherited the curse of Cain through his grandmother, Egyptus, so that the devil might have representation upon the earth. ==Enemy of Abraham== Non-Biblical accounts of Abraham's life are replete with stories of his life being in danger. While the story of the Egyptian priest is absent, there are others of Abraham life being sought when he was an infant, of the magicians of the king's court seeking his life, of his life being in danger for preaching against idolatry to Nimrod the king, of his being cast into a fiery furnace and receiving no harm, and others. These stories contain elements common to the Abraham chapter 1 story, including:Traditions about the Early Life of Abraham, by J. Tvedtnes, B. Hauglid, J. Gee, [Provo: FARMS, 2001], Appendix A, 539-542. *Children were sacrificed *Those who would not worship idols were killed *Abraham was brought to be killed or sacrificed because he would not worship idols *Terah was behind the attempt to kill Abraham *Abraham was fasted or bound *When his life was in danger, Abraham prayed *An angel came to rescue Abraham *God rescued Abraham from death *The altar (furnace) and the idols were destroyed *The priest (or leader) was smitten and died ==Differences with biblical account== A number of elements or themes in Abraham 2 are not found in the biblical account (Book of Genesis. Chapter:11-12). The following list provides twelve of these elements and themes from the Book of Abraham verses noted in the comparison:(J. Tvedtnes, B. Hauglid, J. Gee, Traditions about the Early Life of Abraham, [Provo: FARMS, 2001], xxii-xxiii) 1.A famine struck Abraham's homeland (Abraham 2:1, 5). 2\\.

The Lord instructed Abraham to say that Sarah was his sister (Abraham 2:22-25). ==Anachronism== The use of the name Pharaoh is considered anachronistic during Abraham's time by some scholars.Egyptology and the Book of Abraham ==Notes== ==External links== *The Crocodile God of Pharaoh in Mesopotamia Category:Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism) Category:Ham (son of Noah) Category:Mormonism and race Category:Book of Abraham ",
