The building of the armored train started on September 4, 1944. It was finished on September 18, 1944, in a Railway Manufacture in Zvolen, Slovakia. It was equipped with: * the 75mm Czechoslovak mountain cannon vz. 15 in a cannon carriage * 2 37mm cannons in two tank carriages (LT vz. 35) * 10 7.92mm machineguns The commander of the train was Captain F. Adam, and his assistant was Lieutenant A. T\u00f6k\u00f6ly. The crew was 70 men. Its first action was on September 27, 1944, at the line Hronsk\u00e1 D\u00fabrava \u2013 Kremnica. Near Star\u00e1 Kremni\u010dka it was fighting against a German army advancing to Zvolen. When moving to Hronsk\u00e1 D\u00fabrava, the German Luftwaffe destroyed the train's locomotive. After repair, it successfully fought at \u017diar nad Hronom, Jaln\u00e1 and Hronsk\u00e1 D\u00fabrava, from where it moved on October 18, 1944, to Krupina, where it fought against SS Schill. Two days later, it moved to Dobr\u00e1 Niva, where it was attacked several times by the German Luftwaffe. After a German attack on October 25, 1944, it left Zvolen as the last train, moved to Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and then moved to Ulmanka, where it was blocked by a retired train. After discarding all weapons the crew continued fighting as a partisan battalion. == See also == * Armored train Hurban Category:Slovak National Uprising Category:Military of Slovakia Category:Armoured trains of Slovakia ",
