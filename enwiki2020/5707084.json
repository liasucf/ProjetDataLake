The match was contested by two Italian teams: Juventus and Milan. The match made history as it was the first time two clubs from Italy had faced each other in the final. It was also the second intra- national final of the competition, following the all-Spanish 2000 UEFA Champions League Final three years earlier. Milan won the match via a penalty shoot-out after the game had finished 0\u20130 after extra time. It gave Milan their sixth success in the European Cup. ==Background== Juventus entered the 2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League as Serie A champions and so qualified for the group phase, Milan finished fourth so started off in the third qualifying round.

They defeated Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Lokomotiv Moscow. They lost only two matches (Dortmund 1\u20130, and Real Madrid 3\u20131), and advanced to the quarter-finals where they met Ajax. The first leg was a draw (0\u20130) so the decisive match was the one at the San Siro which Milan won (3\u20132). In the semi-finals, they met local rivals Inter Milan. Both matches finished equal (0\u20130; 1\u20131), but Milan advanced on the away goals rule, despite both teams technically playing at home. ===Juventus=== Juventus won Group E of the first group round, in which the other teams were Newcastle United, Dynamo Kyiv and Feyenoord. They finished second in Group D of the second group round, after Manchester United, due to their losses against the English side (2\u20131; 3\u20130) and against Basel (2\u20131), but they qualified to the quarter-finals where they eliminated Barcelona in extra- time (1\u20131; 2\u20131). In the semi-final, Juventus met Real Madrid; they lost the first match (2\u20131), but they won the second (3\u20131), key midfielder Pavel Nedved picked up a second yellow card which meant he was suspended for the final. ==Pre-match== ===Venue=== Old Trafford was selected to host the final in December 2001. Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, was selected to host the match in December 2001, following a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Nyon, Switzerland, at the same time as Estadio de La Cartuja in Seville was selected to host the 2003 UEFA Cup Final. It was selected ahead of the likes of the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid, the Stade de France in Saint-Denis near Paris, and the Amsterdam Arena. It would be the first time the stadium had hosted a major European final, although it had been the venue for both the two-legged 1968 Intercontinental Cup between Manchester United and Argentine club Estudiantes de La Plata, and the 1991 European Super Cup between Manchester United and Yugoslavian club Red Star Belgrade, which had been scheduled to be played over two legs, only for the Yugoslavian leg to be cancelled due to the wars in the country at the time. The stadium had recently undergone a major expansion; following the mandatory conversion to an all- seater venue as a result of the Taylor Report and ahead of England hosting UEFA Euro 1996, the stadium's North Stand was expanded to three tiers, with a capacity of 25,500 spectators. This was followed by the addition of second tiers to the East and West Stands, which brought the overall capacity of the stadium to 68,217. As has taken place for every Champions League final since 1997, a ceremonial handover of the European Champion Clubs' Cup from the holders to the host city took place on 3 April 2003. After receiving the trophy from a representative of holders Real Madrid in the ceremony at the Manchester Town Hall, UEFA Chief Executive Gerhard Aigner presented it to the Lord Mayor of Manchester, Roy Walters. Former Real Madrid players Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Francisco Gento, Amancio and Emilio Butrague\u00f1o, as were Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, members of the club's 1968 European Cup Final team, and members of Liverpool and Manchester City's past European trophy- winning teams. Also in April 2003, a 24-hour football match \u2013 named the \"Starball Match\" in reference to the logo of the UEFA Champions League \u2013 was played in Manchester's Albert Square. It was the second Starball Match, after the inaugural match was held in Glasgow ahead of the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final at Hampden Park. Over 1,000 players participated in the match, playing for sides named \"Internazionale Manchester\" and \"Real Mancunian\", in reference to Italian club Inter Milan and Spanish club Real Madrid. Internazionale Manchester won the match 252\u2013162. ==Match== ===Summary=== Milan celebrate their sixth European Cup title. After a brisk start, Milan had an Andriy Shevchenko goal ruled out after Rui Costa was deemed to have blocked Gianluigi Buffon's line of view from an offside position, although television replays showed that the Portuguese had moved out of Buffon's line of sight before the shot. Antonio Conte nearly scored for Juventus after coming on as a substitute in the second half, his header clattering against the post with Dida beaten. Andrea Pirlo also hit the bar for Milan. In the second half, both teams began to sit back and created few chances. Both Juventus and Milan had injuries to defenders, Juventus' Igor Tudor leaving early in the first half after pulling a muscle in his right thigh. In extra time, Roque J\u00fanior limped out due to fatigue and injury; as they had made all three of their allowed substitutions, they had to play the rest of the game with 10 men. The penalty shoot-out has caused controversy among some fans as replays showed that Dida was in front of the goal line when saving penalties from David Trezeguet, Marcelo Zalayeta and Paolo Montero. Buffon was also off his line when saving penalties from Clarence Seedorf and Kakha Kaladze. Shevchenko put away the final penalty to win the European Cup for Milan for the sixth time. Shevchenko himself became the first Ukrainian footballer to win the European Cup. ===Details=== {| width=100% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 || Gianluigi Buffon |- |RB ||21|| Lilian Thuram |- |CB ||2 || Ciro Ferrara |- |CB ||5 || Igor Tudor || || |- |LB ||4 || Paolo Montero |- |RM ||16|| Mauro Camoranesi || || |- |CM ||3 || Alessio Tacchinardi || |- |CM ||26|| Edgar Davids || || |- |LM ||19|| Gianluca Zambrotta |- |CF ||17|| David Trezeguet |- |CF ||10|| Alessandro Del Piero (c) || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||12|| Antonio Chimenti |- |DF ||7 || Gianluca Pessotto |- |DF ||13|| Mark Iuliano |- |DF ||15|| Alessandro Birindelli || || |- |MF ||8 || Antonio Conte || || |- |FW ||24|| Marco Di Vaio |- |FW ||25|| Marcelo Zalayeta || || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Marcello Lippi |} |valign=\"top\"|300px |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||12|| Dida |- |RB ||19|| Alessandro Costacurta || || |- |CB ||13|| Alessandro Nesta |- |CB ||3 || Paolo Maldini (c) |- |LB ||4 || Kakha Kaladze |- |RM ||8 || Gennaro Gattuso |- |CM ||21|| Andrea Pirlo || || |- |LM ||20|| Clarence Seedorf |- |AM ||10|| Rui Costa || || |- |CF ||7 || Andriy Shevchenko |- |CF ||9 || Filippo Inzaghi |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||18|| Christian Abbiati |- |DF ||24|| Martin Laursen |- |DF ||25|| Roque J\u00fanior || || |- |MF ||23|| Massimo Ambrosini || || |- |MF ||27|| Serginho || || |- |MF ||32|| Cristian Brocchi |- |FW ||11|| Rivaldo |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Carlo Ancelotti |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size:90%\" | Man of the Match: Paolo Maldini (Milan) Assistant referees: Christian Schr\u00e4er (Germany) Heiner M\u00fcller (Germany) Fourth official: Wolfgang Stark (Germany) |style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of silver goal extra time if necessary. *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level. *Seven named substitutes. *Maximum of three substitutions. |} ===Statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+First half |- !width=100|Statistic !width=70|Juventus !width=70|Milan |- |Goals scored |0||0 |- |Total shots |4||5 |- |Shots on target |1||3 |- |Ball possession |46%||54% |- |Corner kicks |2||7 |- |Fouls committed |12||13 |- |Offsides |0||4 |- |Yellow cards |0||1 |- |Red cards |0||0 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Second half and extra time |- !width=100 |Statistic !width=70|Juventus !width=70|Milan |- |Goals scored |0||0 |- |Total shots |7||9 |- |Shots on target |1||3 |- |Ball possession |51%||49% |- |Corner kicks |3||6 |- |Fouls committed |22||10 |- |Offsides |1||2 |- |Yellow cards |2||0 |- |Red cards |0||0 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Overall |- !width=100|Statistic !width=70|Juventus !width=70|Milan |- |Goals scored |0||0 |- |Total shots |11||14 |- |Shots on target |2||6 |- |Ball possession |49%||51% |- |Corner kicks |5||13 |- |Fouls committed |34||23 |- |Offsides |1||6 |- |Yellow cards |2||1 |- |Red cards |0||0 |} ==Post-match== The teams would again meet in a feature final several months later in the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana in the United States.
