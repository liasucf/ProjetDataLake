    "text": "Lobelia siphilitica, the great blue lobelia, great lobelia, or blue cardinal flower is a plant species within the family Campanulaceae. It is a herbaceous, perennial dicot native to eastern and central Canada and United States. Growing up to three feet tall, it lives in zones 4 to 9 in moist to wet soils. It produces a spike of zygomorphic flowers in the late summer. It blooms from August to October. It is a short lived perennial (with each plant living for only a few years). Although self-compatible, a flower is unable to offer pollen to itself and it must be pollinated by insects (primarily bees in the genus Bombus). ==References== siphilitica Category:Flora of Ontario Category:Flora of North America Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Flora of Arkansas ",
