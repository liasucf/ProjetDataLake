    "text": "Niobium disulfide is the chemical compound with the formula NbS2. It is a black layered solid that can be exfoliated into ultrathin grayish sheets similar to other transition metal dichalcogenides. These layers exhibit superconductivity, where the transition temperature increases from ca. 2 to 6 K with the layer thickness increasing from 6 to 12 nm, and then saturates with thickness. ==References== Category:Niobium compounds Category:Sulfides Category:Transition metal dichalcogenides Category:Monolayers ",
