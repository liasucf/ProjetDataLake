    "text": "A sound chip is an integrated circuit (i.e. \"chip\") designed to produce audio signal. It might do this through digital, analog or mixed-mode electronics. Sound chips normally contain things like oscillators, envelope controllers, samplers, filters and amplifiers. A number of methods of electronically producing sounds were devised during the late 20th century. These included pulse-width modulation, programmable sound generators, wavetable synthesis and frequency modulation synthesis. Sound chips were widely used in arcade game system boards, video game consoles and home computers. Since the late 1990s, pulse-code modulation (PCM) sampling has been the standard. For example, as used in the Intel High Definition Audio (IHDA) standard of 2004. The PCM method is used in mobile phones, and in sound cards for personal computers and its widespread use is part of the digital sound revolution. ==List of sound chips== ==See also== * Digital audio * List of sound card standards * List of Yamaha sound chips ==External links== *Sound generators of the 1980s home computers - includes a list of chips, pictures, datasheets, etc. Category:Video game music technology ",
