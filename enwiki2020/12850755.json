The band's name is reported to have come from the French Queen Marie Antoinette.www.oricon.co.jp Oricon Style Profile Retrieved February 22, 2011 In 1999 the group signed to Sony, later in 2000 when all other members left, Kamijo created Applause Records.www.visunavi.com Visunavi Artist Profile Retrieved February 22, 2011 After a number of line-up changes and the release of several albums, EPs and singles, the group disbanded in 2007. == History == === Laliene (1994\u20131996) === Lareine was initially formed in November 1994 under the name Laliene (stylized as LALIENE), by vocalist Kamijo (then known as Shoki) and guitarist Mayu (then known as Kaito), who met while roadies for Malice Mizer. They were joined by Sakureu and Hirono on guitar and Kyouka on drums, later Emiru was recruited on bass. But before their first performance in March 1995 Mayu left, Sakureu left a short while later and Mayu returned to replace him. In October however Kyouka and Hirono both left. They recruited Machi, also a former Malice Mizer roadie, on drums. On March 26, 1996 they held their first anniversary live and changed their name to Lareine. === Lareine (1996\u20132000) === In August 1996 Akira joined as second guitarist. In December they released their first EP, Blue Romance. In August 1997 Akira left the group. In January 1999 Lareine signed with Sony Music Entertainment Japan and in February 2000 released their second album, Fierte no Umi to Tomo ni Kiyu ~The Last of Romance~. However soon after Emiru announced that he was leaving the group, and Mayu and Machi decided to leave as well. So in August 2000 Lareine held their last concert for fan club members only. === Kamijo's Lareine (2000\u20132002) === Although all other member's left, Kamijo decided to continue Lareine alone and created his own record label, Applause Records. This \"solo project\" continued until 2001 when he ceased Lareine activity and formed New Sodmy with Mayu. But New Sodmy only lasted a year up to 2002 and so Lareine resumed activity. === Reunited (2003\u20132006) === On March 26, 2003 Emiru announced he was rejoining Lareine, as was new drummer Kazumi. On May 17, at a concert, Mayu also rejoined the group. On September 5, 2004 the album Never Cage was released. On March 1, 2006 Kazumi left the band and quit the music business. They recruited their roadie, Kazami, as support drummer and continued to perform. But Mayu started to blow off gigs and lose touch with the rest of the group, so in October Lareine announced they would disband in February 2007. Their last official performance was on October 31, 2006, with Hizaki filling in on guitar. Vocalist Kamijo, has since formed Versailles, with Hizaki.
