    "text": "Mount Brew is a rounded mountain in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, located southwest of Whistler in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains. A public cabin run by the Varsity Outdoor Club, Brew Hut, is located near the summit. The alpine area is a popular destination for hiking in the summer and backcountry ski touring in the winter and spring. Mount Brew is a volcanic feature in the Mount Cayley volcanic field of the central Garibaldi Volcanic Belt of the Canadian Cascade Arc. It formed during the Pleistocene period when volcanic activity in this area occurred under glacial ice during the last glacial period. Although it had a vigorous start, the eruption that formed Mount Brew was not sufficiently sustained to form a larger edifice that could break through the surrounding ice and water to form a tuya. Instead, the eruption produced a subglacial mound. ==See also== *List of volcanoes in Canada *Volcanism of Canada *Volcanism of Western Canada ==References== Category:Volcanoes of British Columbia Category:Mountains of British Columbia Category:Subduction volcanoes Category:Subglacial mounds of Canada Category:Pleistocene volcanoes Category:Mount Cayley volcanic field ",
