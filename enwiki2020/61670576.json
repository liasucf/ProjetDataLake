Later on, the resistance operated a radio station hidden in the Anemospilios cave which is located near the Lampronas plain between Kallikratis and Asfendos. In his book The Cretan Runner, George Psychoundakis reports to have stayed in that cave during the spring of 1942 and to have been fed by Kallikratians.Psychoundakis, George.

Following the mass killings perpetrated in mid September 1943 by the German Wehrmacht at Viannos, the partisan group of Manolis Bandouvas fled westwards, being chased by the Germans. Their intention was to reach the beach of Rodakino, from where British SOE agents planned to evacuate Bandouvas to Egypt. In early October 1943, Bandouvas group was hiding in the area of Mt. Tsilivdikas (), located on the southern outskirts of Lefka Ori. There, they had been reinforced by two partisan groups from Kallikratis, led by Nikos Manouselis (\u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2) and Andreas Manouselis (\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2).
