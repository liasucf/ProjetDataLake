    "text": "\"I Am Love\" is a song by singer Jennifer Holliday, released as a single in 1983 by Geffen Records from her album Feel My Soul. The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot R&B; Singles chart. ==Overview== \"I Am Love\" was produced by Maurice White and written by White, David Foster and Allee Willis. The B-side of the single is a song called \"Heartstrings\". ==Critical reception== Stephen Holden of The New York Times called \"I Am Love\" a \"big, bursting ballad..that deliberately recall(s) her Dreamgirls arias\" and a \"big, swelling tune and lyrics that make a grand pronouncement\". Johnny Loftus of Allmusic proclaimed that \"I Am Love\" is the real standout. Beginning as a fluttering, austere piano ballad, the song abruptly shifts into high gear, where Holliday's high note trills and enormous chorus vocalizing recall her mind-blowing performance of \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" from Dreamgirls.\" ==References== Category:1983 songs Category:1983 singles Category:Geffen Records singles Category:Songs written by David Foster Category:Songs written by Allee Willis Category:Songs written by Maurice White Category:Song recordings produced by Maurice White ",
