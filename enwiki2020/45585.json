He was elevated to the throne after Emperor Go-Toba pressured Emperor Tsuchimikado into abdicating. * 1210 (J\u014dgen 1, 25th day of the 11th month): In the 12th year of Tsuchimikado- tenn\u014d 's reign (\u571f\u5fa1\u9580\u5929\u7687\u5341\u4e8c\u5e74), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (\u2018\u2018senso\u2019\u2019) was received by his younger brother, the second son of the former- Emperor Go-Toba. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Juntoku is said to have acceded to the throne (\u2018\u2018sokui\u2019\u2019).Titsingh, p. 230; Brown, p. 341; Varley, p. 44; n.b., a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jit\u014d, Y\u014dzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami. In actuality, Emperor Go-Toba wielded effective power as a cloistered emperor during the years of Juntoku's reign. In 1221, he was forced to abdicate because of his participation in Go-Toba's unsuccessful attempt to displace the Kamakura bakufu with re-asserted Imperial power. This political and military struggle was called the J\u014dky\u016b War or the J\u014dky\u016b Incident (J\u014dky\u016b-no ran). Imperial tomb of Emperor Juntoku and Emperor Go-Toba, Kyoto After the J\u014dky\u016b-no ran, Juntoku was sent into exile on Sado Island (\u4f50\u6e21\u5cf6 or \u4f50\u6e21\u30f6\u5cf6, both Sadogashima), where he remained until his death in 1242.Bornoff, Nicholas. (2005). National Geographic Traveler Japan, p. 193. This emperor is known posthumously as Sado- no In (\u4f50\u6e21\u9662) because his last years were spent at Sado. He was buried in a mausoleum, the Mano Goryo, on Sado's west coast. Juntoku's official Imperial tomb (misasagi) is in Kyoto. Juntoku was tutored in poetry by Fujiwara no Sadaie, who was also known as Teika. One of the emperor's poems was selected for inclusion in what became a well-known anthology, the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu. This literary legacy in Teika's collection of poems has accorded Juntoku a continuing popular prominence beyond the scope of his other lifetime achievements. The poets and poems of the Hyakunin isshu form the basis for a card game (uta karuta) which is still widely played today.Mostow, Joshua, ed. (1996). Pictures of the Heart: The Hyakunin Isshu in Word and Image, p. 437. ===Kugy\u014d=== Kugy\u014d (\u516c\u537f) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.
