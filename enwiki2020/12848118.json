    "text": "The Science in Society Journalism Awards are awards created by the American National Association of Science Writers (NASW) to honor and encourage \"outstanding investigative and interpretive reporting about the sciences and their impact for good and ill.\" National Association of Science Writers: Science in Society Awards Each year the NASW recognizes work in these categories: books, periodicals (newspaper and magazine), and electronic media (radio, television, and the Internet). Each winner receives $2,500. The first award was given in 1972. The Awards recognize not only reporting about science, but also thoughtful work that probes the ethical problems and social effects of science. The awards are considered especially prestigious because they are judged by accomplished peers. Starting in 2009 the award categories were changed. The book category will remain unchanged, while the other categories will morph into \"Commentary and Opinion,\" \"Science Reporting,\" and \"Local Science Reporting.\" Except for the Book category, the awards will be platform independent, which means that they may be magazine, radio, TV, or web-based. ==Past recipients== 2019 * Book: Carl Zimmer for his book She Has Her Mother\u2019s Laugh: The Powers, Perversions and Potentials of Heredity(Dutton) * Science Reporting: \u201cIn the Land of Quakes, Engineering a Future for a Church Made of Mud\" by Michelle Donahue published in The New York Times * Science Features: \u201cScientists think Alabama\u2019s sewage problem has caused a tropical parasite.
