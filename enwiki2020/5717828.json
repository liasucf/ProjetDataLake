    "text": "Ah\u00ed Vamos (Spanish for There We Go) is a 2006 studio album by Argentine rock musician Gustavo Cerati. The album was met with both positive reviews by critics and popularity, especially in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. The first single released from the album was \"Crimen\", which received airplay starting in April 2006 and gained huge popularity in Latin America and Spain. The second single, released in September was \"La Excepci\u00f3n\". The album was certified Platinum in Argentina with only pre-ordered sales, and attained Gold status in Mexico. On November 2, 2006, the album received the Latin Grammy for Best Rock Solo Vocal Album and \" Crimen\" won the category for Best Rock Song. The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to Shakira's Fijaci\u00f3n Oral Vol. 1. The third single released from the album was \"Adi\u00f3s\", which played on radio and TV stations in Latin America beginning in February 2007. In 2008, Cerati released two more singles from the album, \"Lago En El Cielo\", the fourth song on the album, and \"Me Quedo Aqu\u00ed,\" the fifth. Cerati toured Latin America, Spain and the USA to promote the album, and also performed for the very first time in London, playing at The Forum on October 12. The name \"Ah\u00ed Vamos\" (\"There We Go\") was a phrase repeated many times during the recording sessions, which came to be a war cry for Cerati during the time. On August 29, 2007, the album's second single \"La Excepci\u00f3n\" received two Latin Grammy nominations: Record of the Year and Best Rock Song, winning the later and beating Argentine band La Renga and Uruguayan band Cuarteto de nos, among others. == Track listing == == Sales and certifications == == Personnel == === Performing === * Gustavo Cerati \u2013 lead vocals, backing vocals, lead guitar, bass, piano, kalimba, synthesizer, Moog synthesizer, programming, audio filtering * Richard Coleman \u2013 guitar, effects * Fernando Nal\u00e9 \u2013 bass * Leandro Fresco \u2013 backing vocals, synthesizer, percussion, strings, laptop * Tweety Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 Rhodes fuzz, organ, glockenspiel, piano, synthesizer * Fernando Samalea \u2013 glockenspiel, drums, percussion, drums, octoban, rototom, tam-tam, bandone\u00f3n * Emmanuel Cauvet \u2013 drums * Pedro Moscuzza \u2013 drums * Bolsa Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 drums * Flavius Etcheto \u2013 vocal effects * Capri \u2013 synthesizer * Lol\u00f3 Gasparini \u2013 backing vocals * Paula Zotalis \u2013 backing vocals * Sof\u00eda Medrano \u2013 ambient voices * Dina \u2013 ambient voices === Technical === * Gustavo Cerati \u2013 record production, music supervision * Tweety Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 record production, sound recording * Uriel Dorfman \u2013 sound recording * H\u00e9ctor Castillo \u2013 sound recording, audio mixing * Nicol\u00e1s \"Parker\" Pucci \u2013 production assistance * Pablo G\u00e1ndara \u2013 production assistance * Howie Weinberg \u2013 audio mastering * Bolsa Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 drums advising * Vasco \u2013 Pro Tools advising === Additional === * Ezequiel de San Pablo&Angeles; Altoe;\u2013 graphic design * Oscar Fern\u00e1ndez \u2013 hair * Jazm\u00edn Calcarami \u2013 makeup * Santiago Contreras \u2013 photography, illustrations * Germ\u00e1n Saez \u2013 photography * Nora Lezano \u2013 photography * Sebasti\u00e1n Arpesella \u2013 photography * Gustavo Cerati&Angeles; Altoe \u2013 illustrations * Sof\u00eda Medrano \u2013 illustrations, wardrobe * Mayol \u2013 wardrobe == References == Category:2006 albums Category:Gustavo Cerati albums Category:Sony International albums Category:Latin Grammy Award for Best Rock Solo Vocal Album ",
