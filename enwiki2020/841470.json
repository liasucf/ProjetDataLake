    "text": "Thomas Bibb (May 8, 1783 \u2013 September 20, 1839) was the second Governor of the U.S. state of Alabama, serving from 1820 to 1821. He was president of the Alabama Senate when his brother, Gov. William Wyatt Bibb, died in office on July 10, 1820, as a result of a fall from a horse. By virtue of his senatorial office and in accordance with the state Constitution, Thomas Bibb took over as governor for the remainder of his brother's term. He did not seek election as governor on his own, but later served in the Alabama House. He was born in Amelia County, Virginia in 1783, and grew up in Georgia before moving to what later became Alabama. He was married to Parmelia Thompson from 1809 until his death in 1839. Bibb was an ancestor of James C. Gardner, a Louisiana politician who served as the mayor of Shreveport from 1954 to 1958. Julia Pleasants and David Creswell, Gardner's maternal great-grandparents, were married in 1854 at Bibb's columned plantation house, Belle Mina, located in Limestone County near Huntsville, Alabama. ==References== *Alabama Department of Archives and History *Political Graveyard *History of Alabama and Dictionary of Alabama Biography, Volume 3, by Thomas McAdory Owen Category:1783 births Category:1839 deaths Category:People from Amelia County, Virginia Category:Governors of Alabama Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Infectious disease deaths in Alabama Category:Alabama Democratic- Republicans Category:Alabama state senators Category:Democratic-Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:19th-century American politicians ",
