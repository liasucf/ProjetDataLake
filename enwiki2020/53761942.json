Eisentr\u00e4ger earned a diploma in mathematics in 1996 from the University of T\u00fcbingen. She completed her doctorate in 2003 from the University of California, Berkeley; her dissertation, entitled Hilbert\u2019s Tenth Problem and Arithmetic Geometry, was supervised by Bjorn Poonen. After temporary positions at the Institute for Advanced Study and the University of Michigan, she joined the Pennsylvania State University faculty in 2007. Eisentr\u00e4ger appears in the documentary film Julia Robinson and Hilbert's Tenth Problem (2008). In 2017, she became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to computational number theory and number-theoretic undecidability\". ==References== ==External links== *Home page Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century German mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Number theorists Category:University of T\u00fcbingen alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Pennsylvania State University faculty Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
