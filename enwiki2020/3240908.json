    "text": "The cornetfishes or flutemouthsFishes of Australia, FISTULARIIDAE Flutemouths (Museum Victoria) are a small family, the Fistulariidae, of extremely elongated fishes in the order Syngnathiformes. The family consists of a single genus, Fistularia, with four species, found worldwide in tropical and subtropical marine environments. Ranging up to in length, cornetfishes are as thin and elongated as many eels, but are distinguished by very long snouts, distinct dorsal and anal fins, and forked caudal fins whose center rays form a lengthy filament. The lateral line is well-developed and extends onto the caudal filament. They generally live in coastal waters or on coral reefs, where they feed on small fishes, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. Cornetfish are of minor interest for fishing, and can be found in local markets within their range. ==Species== Currently, four recognized species are placed in this genus: * Fistularia commersonii R\u00fcppell, 1838 (blue-spotted or smooth cornetfish) * Fistularia corneta C. H. Gilbert & Starks, 1904 (Pacific cornetfish) * Fistularia petimba Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de, 1803 (red cornetfish) * Fistularia tabacaria Linnaeus, 1758 (cornetfish or blue-spotted cornetfish) == References == == External links == *Cornetfish video from Makena Landing, Maui Hawaii *YouTube video of a group of cornetfish taken in Shark's Bay, Egypt. *Genetic bottlenecks and successful biological invasions: the case of a recent Lessepsian migrant by Daniel Golani, Ernesto Azzurro, Maria Corsini-Foka, Manuela Falautano, Franco Andaloro, and Giacomo Bernardi Category:Fistulariidae Category:Extant Rupelian first appearances Category:Rupelian genus first appearances Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
