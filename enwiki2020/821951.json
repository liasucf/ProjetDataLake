One of his teachers was Ernst Wiechert. In 1937, he started a degree in art history in Berlin. As a member of the Confessing Church, Bobrowski had contact with the German resistance against National Socialism. He was a lance corporal for the entire Second World War in Poland, France and the Soviet Union. In 1943 he married Johanna Buddrus. From 1945 to 1949 Bobrowski was imprisoned by the Soviet Union, where he spent time working in a coal mine. On his release, he returned home to his family in the suburban Berlin district of Friedrichshagen,Scrase, David (1995). Understanding Johannes Bobrowski.

He worked as an editor, first for the Altberliner Verlag, a children's publisher run by Lucie Grosner, and then, from 1959 on, for the Union Verlag publishing house. Bobrowski's work was influenced by his knowledge of Eastern European landscapes and of the German, Baltic and Slavic cultures and languages, combined with ancient myths. His first poems were published during the war, in 1944, in the Munich-based journal Das innere Reich. In 1960 he read his poems at a meeting in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, of the influential West German literary association Group 47 (Gruppe 47).Wieczorek, John (1999). \"Johannes Bobrowski und die Gruppe 47.\" In: Keith Stuart Parkes and John J. White (eds.), The Gruppe 47: Fifty Years on: A Re-Appraisal of its Literary and Political Significance. Amsterdam: Rodopi. p. 213-227. The following year his first book of collected poems, Sarmatische Zeit (Sarmatian Times), was published in both West and East Germany. After having missed the fall 1961 meeting of the Group 47, since it took place just after the building of the Berlin Wall, he was able to attend the subsequent meeting, held in October 1962 at the Wannsee, in West Berlin. On that occasion he read seven poems from those that would later appear in his collection Wetterzeichen (Weather signs), and was awarded the group's prestigious literary prize. In 1964, Bobrowski became a member of the PEN Club. Bobrowski died as a result of a perforated appendix in East Berlin on 2 September 1965, and was buried in the Friedrichshagen cemetery. Since 1992, the Foundation for Prussian Maritime Trade (Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Seehandlung) has donated funds towards the Johannes Brobrowski Medal. ==Literary works== * \"Sarmatische Zeit\" (The Land of Sarmatia), poems, 1961 * \"Schattenland Str\u00f6me\" (Shadowland), poems, 1962 * \"Levins M\u00fchle, 34 S\u00e4tze \u00fcber meinen Gro\u00dfvater\" (Levin's Mill,34 Stories About My Grandfather ) novel, 1964 * \" Boehlendorff und M\u00e4usefest\" Short stories, 1965 * \"Litauische Claviere \" (Lithuanian Pianos), novel, 1966 * \"Wetterzeichen\" (Weathersigns), poems, 1967 * \"Der Mahner\" (The Admonisher), short stories, 1967 translated with \"Boehlendorff und Mausefest\" as \"I Taste Bitterness\" in 1970 * \"Im Windgestr\u00e4uch\" (In the windy wilderness), poems from Bobrowski's literary executor, 1970 * \"Shadowlands\" Selected Poems translated by Ruth & Matthew Mead, 1984 ==Films== * \"Levins M\u00fchle \" (Levin's Mill), filmed in 1980 by Horst Seemann for DEFA film studios, with Erwin Geschonnek, Christian Grashof and Katja Paryla. * \"Gr\u00fcsse aus Sarmatien f\u00fcr den Dichter Johannes Bobrowski \" (Greetings from Sarmatia for the Poet Johannes Bobrowski),1973 \u2013 Short film by Volker Koepp ==Opera== * \"Levins M\u00fchle\" (Levin's Mill) by Udo Zimmermann, premiere in 1973, produced by Harry Kupfer ==Prizes== * Alma Johanna Koenig Prize, 1962 * \"Group 47\" prize, 1962 * Heinrich Mann Prize, 1965, for \"Levins M\u00fchle\" (Levin's Mill) * International Charles Veillon Prize, 1965 * F.
