    "text": "Far from the Sun is the sixth studio album by Finnish heavy metal band Amorphis. It was the first album to feature drummer Jan Rechberger since 1994's Tales from the Thousand Lakes, replacing Pekka Kasari who had quit the band to spend more time with his family. It was their last album to feature Pasi Koskinen on vocals. The American release is packaged in a slipcase and features five bonus tracks and a video for \"Evil Inside\". The song, \"Darkrooms\" is also a bonus track for the Japanese edition. The time before that Amorphis used the \"Ukonvasara\" (a Finnish type of Mjolnir depicted from Norse Mythology) on an album cover was on Black Winter Day. The album was re- released in Europe in 2008 by Nuclear Blast. This new version includes all the bonus tracks that were previously only available on the American version and also has new artwork. ==Track listing== ===Notes=== # Acoustic # Music video ==Personnel== ===Amorphis=== *Amorphis - all music **Pasi Koskinen \u2212 vocals, lyrics ** Esa Holopainen \u2212 lead guitar ** Tomi Koivusaari \u2212 rhythm guitar ** Niclas Etel\u00e4vuori \u2212 bass guitar ** Santeri Kallio \u2212 keyboards ** Jan Rechberger \u2212 drums ===Additional personnel=== * Mixed by Hiili Hiilesmaa at Finnvox Studios - Helsinki, Finland, February 2003 * Mastered by Thomas Eberger at Cutting Room - Stockholm, Sweden, February 2003 * Album cover and art direction by David K ==References== Category:2003 albums Category:Amorphis albums Category:Virgin Records albums Category:EMI Records albums Category:Nuclear Blast albums ",
