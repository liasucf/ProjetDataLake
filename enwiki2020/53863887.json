Guests participate in cowboy and cowgirl living history through activities such as life around a chuck wagon, roping, bull riding, crafts, games, and trying an assortment of dishes including BBQ and peach cobbler. Guests can also attend a demonstration of plains Tipi living, tours of the historic Heritage Junction town and train engine, appearances by lasso expert Dave Thornbury and gunslinger Joey Rocketshoes Dillon, the Buffalo Soldiers camp, and a Western and Civil War reenactment. ==History== The Santa Clarita Cowboy Festival began in 1994 after efforts by city leaders who looked to embrace Santa Clarita\u2019s Western history. The event was first held at Melody Ranch but, due to complications with filming contracts, the event had to be relocated to the William S. Hart Park in 2015. In 2018, the festival celebrated its 25th anniversary. ==References== Category:Music festivals in Los Angeles Category:Tourist attractions in Los Angeles Category:Cowboy culture Category:Culture of the Western United States Category:Poetry festivals in the United States ",
