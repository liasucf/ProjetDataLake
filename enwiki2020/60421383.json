    "text": "Padmavati ( \u2014 ) is an epic poem written in 1648 by Alaol. It is a medieval Bengali poem inspired by the Awadhi poem Padmavat, by Malik Muhammad Jayasi. Blended with folklore and history, the poem is about the marriage of Ratnasimha and Sinhala princess Padmavati of Chittor. However, Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate leads an invasion to win her. The Bengali version of the account focuses more on the topic of secular love and less on Sufism, unlike the original. The poem was written under the patronage of Quraishi Magan Thakur. It inspired a number of novels, plays and poems in 19th-century Bengali literature. It also had Bengali adaptations by Kshirode Prasad Vidyavinode in 1906 and Abanindranath Tagore in 1909. ==Origin== According to Alaol, the people of Roshang wanted to hear the story of Padmavati, which was performed in the Chief Minister, Magan Thakur's assembly. Thakur then ordered Alaol to compose it in Bengali. ==References== Category:Bengali-language literature Category:Bangladeshi literature Category:1648 books Category:Rohingya people Category:1648 poems Category:Epic poems Category:Bengali poetry ",
