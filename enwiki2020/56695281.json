    "text": "The 2019 European Parliament election in Croatia were held on 26 May 2019, electing members of the national Croatia constituency to the European Parliament. These were the third such elections in the country since its accession to the European Union in 2013. It was the first election to be held nationally since the 2016 parliamentary election, following which the center- right HDZ had formed a coalition government, first with the center-right MOST and later - in June 2017, with the centrist HNS. The European Parliament elections were therefore viewed as a major test for the center-left SDP, which had contested all previous nationwide elections since 2011 as part of a coalition, but chose to stand in this election alone. The elections as such was deemed important to showcase whether the SDP could remain the largest opposition party, having been faced with months of falling opinion poll ratings. Its main contenders for such a position within the political system were the anti-establishment, eurosceptic \u017divi zid party, and the newly formed center-left Amsterdam Coalition. The election resulted in the two largest parties in the country, the ruling centre-right HDZ, and the opposition centre-left SDP, winning an equal number of seats - each taking 4. SDP won in all four of the largest Croatian cities: Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek.https://www.24sata.hr/news/u-najvecim-gradovima-ljevica-je-pomela-hdz- na-eu-izborima-631477 The remaining four seats were evenly divided between the right-wing Croatian Sovereignists coalition, the centre-left Amsterdam Coalition, the anti-establishment \u017divi zid party and the independent list led by jurist Mislav Kolaku\u0161i\u0107. The strong performance of right-wing and far-right parties, such as the Croatian Sovereignists coalition and Independents for Croatia-HSP coalition, is thought to have greatly contributed to the surprisingly poor result of the HDZ, notably by significantly reducing its support among members of the Croatian diaspora, who had registered a record turnout in this election. Another surprise in the elections was the large number of votes received by Zagreb jurist Mislav Kolaku\u0161i\u0107 and his independent list - which was something not predicted by opinion polls, as well as the failures of MOST to attain a seat and of independent incumbent MEP Marijana Petir to retain her seat (which she had held since 2014). At the previous election in 2014, Croatia was allocated 11 seats and is set to receive one additional seat following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. All seats were up for election and the whole country forms a single constituency, with the 12 members elected by proportional representation using open lists and the D'Hondt method. ==Current delegation== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |+ Croatian parties in the European Parliament in the ninth legislature (2019-2024) |- !

The lists were published by the State Election Commission on 10 April, when the official election campaign began that will last for 45 days. === Croatian Democratic Union === The slate of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the ruling centre-right party of Croatia and member of the European People's Party (EPP), was led by 30-year-old Karlo Ressler, who was nominated by the youth branch of the party. The slate also includes two current MEPs, three members of the Croatian Parliament, and two county prefects. The party platform for the election was called \"Croatia for Generations\". Croatian Prime Minister and HDZ President Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 said that the election is a choice between a political course of Croatia's development and a backward course that would isolate Croatia. The main campaign rally of the HDZ, held in Zagreb, was attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Manfred Weber, EPP's candidate for European Commission (EC) President. Both of them urged voters to reject nationalism in the upcoming election. === Social Democratic Party of Croatia === The slate of the main opposition party, the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) of the Party of European Socialists (PES), was led by current MEP Tonino Picula. While presenting the party list, Picula said that Croatia had not taken full advantage of its membership in the EU. The SDP was expecting to win three seats in the upcoming election. The campaign event in Rijeka, where the SDP is in power, was attended by Frans Timmermans, the candidate of the PES for president of the EC, alongside SDP President Davor Bernardi\u0107. Bernardi\u0107 accused the HDZ for \"failing to salvage\" the Croatian shipyards in Rijeka and Pula, in cooperation with the EC. === Amsterdam Coalition === The list of the Amsterdam Coalition, a coalition of seven parties, including the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the Civic Liberal Alliance (GLAS), and the Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS), was headed by Istria County prefect Valter Flego of the IDS. GLAS President Anka Mrak Tarita\u0161 presented the list as a rejection of a \"Europe of barbed wire fences and the Brexit chaos\", and said that the coalition advocates an open and free Europe. HSS President Kre\u0161o Beljak said that the vote for the coalition is a vote for a European Croatia. === \u017divi zid === The populist \u017divi zid party announced a joint platform with Italy's Five Star Movement, Kukiz'15 from Poland, and Greece's AKKEL. The 1st candidate on the slate of the \u017divi zid was its secretary-general Tihomir Lukani\u0107. Ivan Vilibor Sin\u010di\u0107, the president of the party, presented the platform as a new generation of politicians that will fight against corruption and organised crime. === Bridge of Independent Lists === The slate of the Bridge of Independent Lists (Most) was led by its president, Bo\u017eo Petrov. If elected, Petrov would have given up his seat in the European Parliament to the next candidate with most preferential votes. Prior to the start of the campaign, the Most party attempted to filibuster a bill that would increase the spending limits for the European election, but the bill was passed by the Croatian Parliament just before the deadline. The party has not joined any of the European political groups and announced the work within the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits. === Independents for Croatia\u2013Croatian Party of Rights === Two right-wing parties, the Independents for Croatia (NHR) and the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), formed a coalition and emphasized a Europe of \"free, sovereign and independent nations\" as the main agenda. Their slate included both parties' presidents, Bruna Esih of the NHR and Karlo Star\u010devi\u0107 of the HSP. === Croatian Sovereignists === The Croatian Sovereignists coalition was formed by four right-wing parties: the Croatian Conservative Party (HKS), the Croatian Growth (Hrast), the Croatian Party of Rights Dr. Ante Star\u010devi\u0107 (HSP AS), and the United Croatian Patriots (UHD). Its list was led by current MEP Ru\u017ea Toma\u0161i\u0107 of the HKS, who won a mandate in 2013 and in 2014 on the HDZ-led Patriotic Coalition slate. === Independent Democratic Serb Party === SDSS' 2019 European Parliament election jumbo poster in Vukovar. The Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS), the largest party of the Serbs of Croatia, ran independently for the first time in the European election. Although there were speculations that the SDSS might leave the ruling coalition, its leader Milorad Pupovac confirmed that the SDSS will remain a part it, following a meeting with Prime Minister Plenkovi\u0107. Campaign was marked by SDSS jumbo posters with inscription \"Do you know how it is to be a Serb in Croatia?\" in which a word Serb was written in Serbian Cyrillic. Jovi\u0107 was second on the list, just behind party leader Milorad Pupovac. As it was expected by campaign leaders jumbo posters were target of widespread nationalist vandalism and destruction which underlined the issue of ethnic intolerance and discrimination. === Other electoral lists === The Croatian People's Party \u2013 Liberal Democrats (HNS\u2013LD), the junior partner in the governing coalition, also ran independently, with Me\u0111imurje County Prefect Matija Posavec leading the list. Current MEP Marijana Petir, who was elected in 2014 on the HDZ-led coalition slate, ran as an independent candidate, with a campaign focused on agrarian issues. == Opinion polls == ===Exit polls=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=2 | Date ! rowspan=2 | Polling firm !
