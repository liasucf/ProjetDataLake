    "text": "The Cystofilobasidiales are an order of fungi in the class Tremellomycetes of the Basidiomycota. They usually exhibit a life phase of free-living yeasts. Meiotic taxa are heterothallic or selfsporulating. They form dikaryote teliospores, from which the unicellular basidia (if present) are formed. The hyphae usually have dolipore septa without a parenthesome, and their cell walls contain xylose. Cystofilobasidium is the type genus. The order contains one family (the Cystofilobasidiaceae) with nine genera and 20 species. Genera of Cystofilobasidiales comprise: * Cystofilobasidium * Guehomyces * Itersonilia * Mrakia * Phaffia * Tausonia * Udeniomyces * Xanthophyllomyces ==References== ==External links== *The Families of Mushrooms and Toadstools Represented in the British Isles Description Category:Tremellomycetes Category:Basidiomycota orders Category:Monotypic fungus taxa ",
