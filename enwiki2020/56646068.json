CareFlite's original namesake service is helicopter air ambulance, though today it also performs fixed-wing and ground transport. CareFlite's Board of Directors includes representatives from Texas Health Resources, Methodist Health System, Baylor Scott & White Health Care System, Parkland Health and Hospital System, and the JPS Health Network. == History == CareFlite began operations in 1979. It originated with one helicopter, a Bell 206L, which was shared between Methodist Dallas Medical Center and Harris Methodist Fort Worth Hospital. CareFlite augmented their air ambulance service with ground operations in 1981. == Fleet == === Current aircraft === 291x291px CareFlite currently operates six helicopters, one fixed-wing aircraft, and several ground ambulances. * 2 Bell 429 * 4 Bell 407GX * 1 Beech C90 === Former aircraft === * Agusta AW109 * Bell 222UT * Bell 206L 292x292px == Operations == === Helicopter flight crew === Each CareFlite helicopter is staffed by a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic meeting the following minimum requirements: ==== Pilot ==== * ATP Rotorcraft Certification * 2500 hours helicopter total time * 500 turbine flight hours * 200 unaided night-flight hours ==== Nurse ==== * At least five years emergency room and/or intensive care unit experience * Paramedic license or certification * CFRN * ACLS * ATLS or TPATC * PALS * S.T.A.B.L.E. * NRP Paramedic * At least 5 years progressive 9-1-1 experience * FP-C * ACLS * ATLS or TPATC * PALS * S.T.A.B.L.E. * NRP === Bases of operation === ==== Helicopter ==== * Methodist Dallas Medical Center * Texas Health Harris Methodist Fort Worth Hospital * McKinney National Airport * North Texas Medical Center * Granbury Regional Airport * Whitney, Texas ==== Fixed-wing ==== * Grand Prairie Municipal Airport ==== Ground ==== * Collin County * Dallas County * Denton County * Ellis County * Erath County * Hill County * Johnson County * Kaufman County * Palo Pinto County * Parker County == Accidents == * On September 3, 2003, a CareFlite AW109 lost power while taking off from the Methodist Dallas Medical Center. The pilot aborted the takeoff, forcing the aircraft onto its side on the helipad to avoid going over the side of the building. The pilot was injured in the crash. * On June 2, 2010, a CareFlite 222 was undergoing a post-maintenance flight near Midlothian, Texas when it broke up in the air. The pilot and the mechanic on board were both killed in the crash. The probable cause was found to be fracture of a swashplate drive pin. * On September 30, 2012, a CareFlite AW109 dispatched on mission entered IFR conditions, shortly thereafter descending from the clouds. The aircraft impacted the ground at a level attitude, skidded and landed on its side. The three crew members were seriously injured. == Memberships == As with some other air ambulance services, CareFlite offers yearly memberships to cover transport costs not paid by medical insurance. The membership costs are charged per household. This includes helicopter, ground, and most fixed-wing transport costs. === Fixed-wing transport === If insurance deems a fixed-wing transport usage not medically necessary or denies claim, the member is responsible 50% of the charges. === Partnership with Air Methods === CareFlite has membership reciprocity with Air Methods, a large helicopter company which operates many air ambulance programs throughout the United States. This allows members of Air Methods and CareFlite to benefit from their memberships if they require air medical transport in either companies' respective areas of operation. == See also == * Memorial Hermann Life Flight * Travis County STAR Flight == References == == External links == * CareFlite website * Bringing Health and Hope \u2013 CareFlite Texas Category:Air ambulance services Category:Air ambulance services in the United States __FORCETOC__ Category:Healthcare in Texas ",
