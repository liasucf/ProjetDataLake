Later it is revealed that his brother-in-law Shahjahan (Unni Mukundan) was suspected to be part of the terror team that had planted bombs in Bombay in 1993 and was later killed in an encounter with the Army in Andhra Pradesh.

Likewise, Sameer spends nine and a half years in jail as an accused in a blast case and is finally acquitted of all charges. The director says that the film transmits not just the trauma of Madani but of every under-trial who had to undergo long imprisonment. \"Only the core idea is taken from real life and the rest is fiction. Madani is a political leader. But Sameer is presented as an ordinary person\", he said.

Palicha of Rediff.com said, \"Bombay March 12 is a promising debut for scriptwriter Babu Janardhanan as a director.\" He rated it three in a scale of five (). and said \"The storytelling is complicated and you need to be focused as every scene exposes yet another layer of the story, something Babu Janardhanan did as a writer in the Lijo Jose Pellissery directed City of God. But there is always a niggling thought at the back of our minds that the point he is trying to make \u2013 that 'one bad egg can spoil the whole basket' \u2013 could have been conveyed just as well in a more simple and linear narrative.\"Bombay March 12 is hard-hitting, Rediff, July 1, 2011 Mammootty's performance is appreciated as \"one of his most subdued roles in recent times\". According to Palicha, Unni Mukundan as Shahjahan \"does full justice to the confidence that the director has reposed in him.\"() ==References== Category:2011 films Category:Indian films Category:Malayalam-language films Category:2010s Malayalam-language films Category:2011 crime drama films Category:2011 thriller drama films Category:Indian films based on actual events Category:Films set in Mumbai Category:Films set in 1993 Category:1993 Bombay bombings Category:Films about terrorism in India Category:Films about organised crime in India Category:Films set in Kerala Category:Films shot in Mumbai Category:Films shot in Hyderabad, India Category:Films shot in Kerala Category:Films shot in Rajasthan Category:Films shot in Coimbatore Category:Hyperlink films Category:2011 directorial debut films Category:2011 drama films ",
