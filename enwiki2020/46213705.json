    "text": "Bin-fed concrete batching plants are used to store all the ingredients needed to mix concrete. The batch plants are fully transportable, fully automated, have their own hydraulic off-loading legs and are capable of producing outputs of up to 80 m3 per hour. The compact and easy-to-use design of some bin-fed batch plant models ensures they can be up and working within just an hour of arrival on site. Four off-loading legs enable the bin-fed batching plant to be loaded and unloaded from a truck without the use of a crane. During transportation the legs retract into the frame of the batching plant and during off-loading they open out into a width that allows the truck to drive away or move back underneath. Each unit has a conveyor belt to lift the raw materials, which folds away into the first aggregate bin. Bin-fed batch plants are fitted with load cells and digital display units with printers to enable constant control of raw materials. The unit is supplied cement from a Cement Silo, normally between the capacity of 30-100MT. Since these are much smaller batching plants, great care should be taken to ensure safety of the Cement Silos. Since Silos are top heavy structures, care is taken to ensure proper foundations of these silos. ==References== Category:Concrete ",
