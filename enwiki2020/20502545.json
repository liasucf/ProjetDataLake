    "text": "The Quebec referendum on the prohibition of alcohol, held on April 10, 1919,Tenue d'un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum sur la prohibition au Qu\u00e9bec considered the legalization of the sale of beer, cider and wine in the province of Quebec, Canada. The 'yes' side won with 78.62% of the votes. == The question asked == The question asked in English on the ballot paper was: \"Should sale of light beer, cider and wines be allowed?\"http://www.isnie.org/ISNIE05/Papers05/dupre.pdf In French, the question was: \"\u00cates-vous d'opinion que la vente des bi\u00e8res, cidres et vins l\u00e9gers, tels que d\u00e9finis par la loi, devrait \u00eatre permise?\"https://books.google.com/books?id=QxO3pyvw7k0C, p. 136 == The results of the vote == 178,112 persons (78.62%) voted in favor of the proposal, while 48,433 (21.38%) voted against; proposal was therefore passed with a majority of 129,679 votes. The analysis of the vote by riding reveals that all voted in favour except for seven: Pontiac, Compton, Dorchester, Huntingdon, Brome, Stanstead and Richmond. The result of the vote was that the subsequent prohibition law which became effective on May 1, 1919 only applied to spirits. The victory of the \"moderate\" prohibitionists over the \"radicals\" did not have immediate repercussion on the legal sale of alcohol for in 1919, 90% of Quebec municipalities were prohibiting its sale locally.https://books.google.com/books?id=QxO3pyvw7k0C, p. 137 Indeed, Trois- Rivi\u00e8res, L\u00e9vis, Lachine, Sainte-Agathe, Louiseville, Sainte-Rose and Terrebonne had voted for local prohibition in 1915,Tenue d'un vote sur la prohibition de l'alcool dans plusieurs villes qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises while Quebec City had done the same on October 4, 1917.Tenue d'un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum sur la prohibition dans la ville de Qu\u00e9bec All these regulations had to be rescinded, one municipality at a time.
