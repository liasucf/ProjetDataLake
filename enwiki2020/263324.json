    "text": "Operation Crosstie was a series of 48 nuclear tests conducted by the United States in 1967-1968 at the Nevada Test Site. These tests followed the Operation Latchkey series and preceded the Operation Bowline series. ==Gasbuggy== The blast designated Gasbuggy involved an underground detonation, intended to stimulate production of natural gas by cracking the rock in the underground formation of its deposit. The test proceeded as expected, but not only did the production not increase as much as expected, but the customers also refused to buy gas contaminated with traces of radioisotopes. ==Buggy== Buggy was a Plowshare test designed to excavate a channel. It was a simultaneous detonation of 5 devices, placed apart and below the surface that resulted in a channel wide, 900 feet long, and deep . Or 65 feet deep and 254 feet wide, according to Declassified U.S. film.Declassified U.S. Nuclear Test Film #35 c. 6:30 minutes The USSR conducted a similar salvo-test to investigate the use of nuclear explosions in the construction of the Pechora\u2013Kama Canal project. On March 23, 1971, three simultaneously detonated 15 kiloton underground nuclear charges were exploded in the Taiga test.The Soviet Taiga PNE ==Faultless== The Faultless test was a calibration test conducted in a mine cavity 3,200 feet beneath the Hot Creek Valley near Tonopah, Nevada, with a yield of around 1 megaton. This test was conducted to see if the land was fit for testing a 5 megaton thermonuclear warhead for the Spartan missile.latimes The test failed because of the large degree of faulting that resulted in the area around the test. It was decided that the land was unfit for multi-megaton nuclear tests, so a similar calibration test was conducted at Amchitka Island, Alaska, in the fall of 1969 during Operation Mandrel. The 7.4 foot diameter steel pipe that was used to place the bomb remains at the test site. The top of the pipe was originally flush with the surface, however, the ground sunk by nine feet following the explosion.http://www.rachel-nevada.com/places/faultless.html A plaque is mounted on the exposed pipe to commemorate the event. Plaque at the Project Faultless test site. ==Table of detonations== The United States's Crosstie nuclear test series was a group of 48 nuclear tests conducted in 1967-1968. These tests A bomb test may be a salvo test, defined as two or more explosions \"where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points and does not exceed 40 kilometers in length\". followed the Operation Latchkey series and preceded the Operation Bowline series. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ United States' Crosstie series tests and detonations |- !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Name The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions - Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event. The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in \"name1 - 1(with name2)\". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known. !style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Date time (UT) !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Local time zone To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. !style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Location Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. \"~\" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area. !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Elevation + height Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is \"N/A\". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, Plumbbob/John. No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while \"0\" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together. !style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Delivery Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use. Purpose Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down. !style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Device Designations for test items where known, \"?\" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed. !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Yield Estimated energy yield in tons, kilotons, and megatons. A ton of TNT equivalent is defined as 4.184 gigajoules (1 gigacalorie). !style=\"background:#efefef;\" class=\"unsortable\" | Fallout Radioactive emission to the atmosphere aside from prompt neutrons, where known. The measured species is only iodine-131 if mentioned, otherwise it is all species. No entry means unknown, probably none if underground and \"all\" if not; otherwise notation for whether measured on the site only or off the site, where known, and the measured amount of radioactivity released. !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" class=\"unsortable\" | References !style=\"background:#efefef;\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- !
