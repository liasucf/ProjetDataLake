The street was part of a former trading route between Wieliczka, Tarn\u00f3w and Lw\u00f3w. After the junction near the Planty Park, the street extends as Starowi\u015blna Street. Its former name was Zwierz\u0119ca Street (Ulica Zwierz\u0119ca, lit. Animal Street) due to nearby slaughter houses. The street would also be known as Szkolna Street (Ulica Szkolna, lit. School Street) due to the former existence of a nearby school devoted to the Virgin Mary. ==Features== {| |----- bgcolor=\"#FF 8C 00\" ! width=4% | Street No. ! width=26% | Short description ! width=10% | Picture |----- bgcolor=\"#FFF8E1\" | align=\"center\"| 5 || align=\"center\"| Bidermanowski House - a Mannerist house built between 1912 and 1914.
