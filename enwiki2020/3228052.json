    "text": ":For the Ryukyuan king, see Sh\u014d Shin. Shoshin (\u521d\u5fc3) is a word from Zen Buddhism meaning \"beginner's mind.\" It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would. The term is especially used in the study of Zen Buddhism and Japanese martial arts. The phrase is also discussed in the book Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki, a Zen teacher. Suzuki outlines the framework behind shoshin, noting \"in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few.\" ==See also== *Fudoshin *Kensho *Mushin *Samyama *Satori *Zanshin *Curse of knowledge ==References== Category: Buddhist philosophical concepts Category:Japanese martial arts terminology Category:Zen Buddhist terminology ",
