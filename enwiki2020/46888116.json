The current party Leader has been Goh Meng Seng since its formation in July 2015.Opposition veteran Goh Meng Seng applies to set up political party (19 May 2016) ==History and political development== The party was first formed by veteran politician Goh Meng Seng, on 16 July 2015, just a few months prior to the election held that year. Goh had previously served as a member of the incumbent opposition Workers' Party of Singapore and National Solidarity Party, in the 2006 and 2011, respectively. In the aftermath of the 2011 election, Goh resigned from his Secretary General post as well as his party membership following the party's defeat. The party was perceived as lightweight and opposed to major opposition parties were believed to be reasons for its speedy registration approval being given in two instead of the typical three months set by the Election Department. The party only contested in the Chua Chu Kang Group Representation Constituency, a four- member GRC, which the team consist of Goh, and candidates Lee Tze Shih, Low Wai Choo and former NSP member Syafarin Sarif, faced against the ruling People's Action Party team led by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, Parliamentary Secretary and Mayor Low Yen Ling, Zaqy Mohamad and newcomer Yee Chia Hsing. The PAP team defeated the party with a vote share of 76.83%-23.11%, which was 84,731 and 25,460 votes, respectively. Low was notable for being convicted for public nuisance for her role in a Hong Lim Park protest rally in 2014, while Lee Tze Shih joined Progress Singapore Party in 2019. Goh, despite being a veteran politician who was surprised of the number of voters that voted for them, as he claimed that his party lacked media coverage, he and his team's defeat was one of the worst performing candidates in this election. Goh shortly returned to Hong Kong to reside with his family after the election. In 2018, the party was along with the six other opposition parties (Democratic Progressive Party, National Solidarity Party, Reform Party, Singapore Democratic Party, Singaporeans First and Singapore's Voice Party, a party formed by NSP chief Lim Tean) led by former People's Action Party member and presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock, on the possibility of forming a coalition for the next election.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/seven- opposition-parties-discuss-forming-a-new-coalition-invite-former-pap-mp-tan- cheng The party participated in the 2020 election, but Goh was the only candidate fielded this election, this time contesting in the MacPherson SMC. On 27 June, Goh confirmed that this was his final election, reiterating his belief that he could contribute more to Parliament as an opposition member if elected, while praising the incumbent Tin Pei Ling for her involvement. Despite the efforts, it was all for naught, as Goh was defeated to Tin by a 71.74%-28.26% vote share. ==Objectives and policies== PPP advocates the Separation of Five Powers (including Social, Culture, Politics, Economics) and a more balanced development of Singapore.PPP's official Facebook site - 18 August 2015 The PPP has adopted and adapted with the Three Principles of the People and its system of having five branches of government espoused by Dr Sun Yat-Sen, founding father of the Republic of China (now administrating Taiwan and surrounding Island) It has modified the concepts of the Five Powers to stay relevant to modern contemporary political and social structures. The emphasis is on the separation of the Five Powers which means the separation of certain institutions from Executive branch's control. The Power of Impeachment (originally under Control Yuan) has been expanded to include various contemporary functional government institutions.
