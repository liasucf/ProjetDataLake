All 46 members of the Council of States were elected from all cantons of Switzerland. The first round was held on 21 October. In eight cantons, not all seats were filled in the first round, and a second round was held on 11 November, 18 November, or 25 November. The election was a breakthrough for the Green Party, which won its first two seats in the Council of States, and the Green Liberal Party (GLP), which won a seat only four months after it split from the Greens. These gains \u2013 the first time minor parties had won representation in the Council of States since 1995 \u2013 came at the expense of the Free Democratic Party, which lost two seats, and the Swiss People's Party, which lost its seat in its stronghold of Zurich to the GLP. ==Election== The Council of States election was not finalized with the first run on 21 October; twelve seats remained to be distributed in second round elections on 11 November, 18 November or 25 November 2007. The second round saw a number of notable races, for instance the election for the second seat in Z\u00fcrich, where SP candidate Chantal Gallad\u00e9 agreed to withdraw and support GLP candidate Verena Diener against SVP candidate Ueli Maurer, increasing the centre-left's changes in the second round.Chantal Gallad\u00e9 verzichtet (Z\u00fcrich , NZZ Online) In St. Gallen, where no one was elected in the first round, FDP candidate Erika Forster and CVP candidate Eugen David, both incumbents, started a common campaign for reelection against SVP candidate Toni Brunner.CVP und FDP gemeinsam gegen Toni Brunner (Schweiz, NZZ Online) Four candidates contested the election for the two seats in Tessin -- Dick Marty (FDP, over 40,000 votes in the first round), Filippo Lombardi (CVP), Franco Cavalli (SP) -- both of whom had over 30,000 votes\u2014and finally Attilio Bignasca (Lega).Lombardi erh\u00e4lt Sch\u00fctzenhilfe von der Lega (Schweiz, NZZ Online) The two incumbents from the FDP and CVP were reelected on 18 November.
