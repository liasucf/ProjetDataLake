It flows south, receives its left tributary Aroanios, flows along Kleitoria and turns southwest near the Arcadian border. It flows through the artificial Ladon Lake, and turns south again near Dimitra. It flows into the Alfeios 3 km southeast of the village Tripotamia. It joins the Tragus near Zevgolatio. ==Mythology== The river was among those mentioned by Hesiod in Theogony; they were \"all sons of Oceanus and queenly Tethys\" for, according to the image of world hydrography common to the ancients, the fresh water that welled up in springs came from the underworld caverns and pools and was connected with the salt sea. Rain fertilized crops, but the sense that its runoff filled the rivers did not figure in the Greek mythic picture. Rivers were personified and credited with wooing nymphs and human maidens and fathering children. One daughter, the nymph Metope was wed to the river Asopus. Rivers have cleansing effect in Greek mythology. When Poseidon assaulted Demeter, she washed away the insult in the waters of the River Ladon. ==References== Category:Potamoi Category:Rivers of Greece Category:Landforms of Achaea Category:Rivers of Western Greece Category:Rivers of Peloponnese (region) Category:Landforms of Arcadia Category:Locations in Greek mythology ",
