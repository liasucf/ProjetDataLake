    "text": "Sally Abbott is a British screenwriter, best known for the BBC1 crime drama The Coroner, which ran for two series. ==Career== She worked in theatre for 18 years as a producer, young people\u2019s director and trainer at Contact Theatre, English Touring Theatre, Liverpool\u2019s Everyman Theatre and the National Association of Youth Theatres, before concentrating on writing. She was awarded a place on the BBC Writer's Academy, a programme designed to train new writers for their long running television series, with her horror spec Camp Fear. She went on to write for all four of the BBC's popular continuing dramas: Doctors, Eastenders, Casualty and its spinoff, Holby City. She also wrote for Series 8 of Death in Paradise. ===The Coroner=== Abbott created The Coroner from an idea by Will Trotter, executive producer and head of BBC Drama Birmingham, about a woman coroner aged about 40 and in a location such as the Cotswolds or Devon. It starred Claire Goose as Jane Kennedy, a coroner based in a fictional South Devon coastal town. Matt Bardock stars as Detective Sergeant Davey Higgins. The series would have self-contained stories with drama and humour; a formula successfully used in Father Brown from the same production team. The characters, Jane and Davey, were based on Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey in Adam's Rib with the unresolved sexual tension between them. Abbott wrote the Davey character with Matt Bardock in mind. She created four other characters to complete the cast. The BBC announced on 2 March 2017 that there would be no further series. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:21st-century British women writers Category:British soap opera writers Category:British television writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Women soap opera writers Category:21st-century British screenwriters ",
