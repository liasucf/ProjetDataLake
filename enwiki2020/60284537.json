    "text": "Santiago Pati\u00f1o (born 10 March 1997) is a Colombian footballer who currently plays as a forward for Cimarrones de Sonora in Mexico's Liga de Expansi\u00f3n MX, on loan from MLS team Orlando City. Having played college soccer for the FIU Panthers, he was selected third overall in the 2019 MLS SuperDraft by Orlando City. == Club career == === Youth and college === Pati\u00f1o was born in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. When he was 9 years old, Pati\u00f1o's parents split and he chose to live with his father, playing in the junior teams of the football clubs his father transferred to. When he was 12 years old, Pati\u00f1o moved to Orlando, Florida with his mother where he played for Orlando City\u2019s Development Academy and Freedom High School. He played college soccer at Florida International University from 2015 to 2018, scoring 37 goals in 69 matches. He was a three time All-Conference USA selection and named MAC Hermann Trophy semifinalist in his junior year. Prior to his professional deal, Pati\u00f1o spent the summer of 2016 in the NPSL with Kraze United and also played in the PDL with both SIMA \u00c1guilas and Seattle Sounders U23. === Orlando City === Before they selected him in the draft, Orlando City had tried to sign Pati\u00f1o as a Homegrown Player but the move was controversially blocked by MLS. The team's Executive VP of soccer operations Luiz Muzzi continued to argue the case throughout the Combine and events leading up to the draft stating \"We feel like the league did us wrong on this one.\" Orlando eventually decided to draft him with their #3 overall pick despite the selection being seen as a reach with Orlando City head coach James O'Connor describing the move as \"a message to all our other homegrowns.\" He made his professional debut on 16 March 2019 in a 3\u20131 defeat to Montreal Impact, coming on as a 74th minute substitute and assisting Dom Dwyer's goal in stoppage time. He scored his first professional goal 7 July 2019, entering as an 81st minute substitute and scoring with his first touch of the game from a corner to put Orlando 2\u20131 up against Philadelphia Union. Orlando ended up conceding a 90th minute equalizer to tie 2\u20132. ==== Loan to Cimarrones de Sonora ==== On 21 August 2020, Pati\u00f1o joined Mexican team Cimarrones de Sonora in Liga de Expansi\u00f3n MX for the rest of the year. He made his debut for the club as a substitute on 7 September in a 2\u20130 win over Dorados, making his first start on 16 September in a 1\u20130 defeat to Atlante. He scored his first goal on 22 September 2020, a 90th minute concilation goal in a 2\u20131 defeat to Correcaminos. == International == In August 2019, Pati\u00f1o received his first international call up to the Colombia U23 training camp ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |Kraze United |2016 |NPSL |4||5||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||4||5 |- |SIMA \u00c1guilas |2017 |rowspan=\"2\"|PDL |7||4||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||7||4 |- |Seattle Sounders U23 |2018 |14||9||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||14||9 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Orlando City |2019 | rowspan=\"2\" |MLS |11||2||2||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||13||2 |- |2020 |2||0||0||0||2MLS is Back Tournament knockout stage.||0||4||0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !13!!2!!2!!0!!2!!0!!17!!2 |- |Cimarrones de Sonora |2020\u201321 |Liga de Expansi\u00f3n MX |7||1||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||7||1 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !45!!21!!2!!0!!2!!0!!49!!21 |} ==Personal life== Santiago is the son of former professional goalkeeper Milton Pati\u00f1o.
