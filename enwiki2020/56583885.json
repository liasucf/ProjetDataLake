    "text": "The 2018 Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \"King of Kings\") was a professional wrestling event produced by the Lucha Libre AAA World Wide, or simply AAA, promotion. The 2018 version was the 22nd year in a row that AAA has held a Rey de Reyes show and tournament. Previous Rey de Reyes tournaments consisted of several rounds, but for 2018, which was won by Rey Escorpi\u00f3n. In the main event of the reshuffled card El Hijo del Fantasma defeated El Texano Jr. in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, forcing Texano Jr. to have all his hair shaved off after the match. ==Production== ===Background=== Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's Rey. Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the'Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual Reina de Reinas (\"Queen of Queens\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2018 show will be the 22nd Rey de Reyes show in the series. ===Storylines=== La Parka, one of the for Rey de Reyes finalists The 2018 Rey de Reyes show featured nine professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (t\u00e9cnicos in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. ==Results== ==See also== *2018 in professional wrestling ==References== Category:2018 in Mexico Category:2018 in professional wrestling Category:March 2018 events in Mexico Category:Events in Mexico Category:Rey de Reyes ",
