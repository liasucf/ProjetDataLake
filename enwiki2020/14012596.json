It serves the Greenbush Line. It is located in Weymouth Landing, and consists of a single side platform serving the line's one track. The station is fully accessible. ==History== Weymouth station in the early 20th century The New Haven Railroad abandoned its remaining Old Colony Division lines on June 30, 1959, after the completion of the Southeast Expressway. The Weymouth station had been located just west of Commercial Street. The MBTA reopened the Greenbush Line on October 31, 2007, with Weymouth station located between Commercial Street and Quincy Avenue. Original plans called for a platform between the streets, but the MBTA ultimately decided to build a standard platform that extends under the streets at either end. ==References== ==External links== *MBTA - Weymouth Landing/East Braintree *Station from Google Maps Street View Category:Stations along Old Colony Railroad lines Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2007 Category:MBTA Commuter Rail stations in Norfolk County, Massachusetts ",
