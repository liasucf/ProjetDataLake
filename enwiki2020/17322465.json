    "text": "Atrophaneura priapus, the Priapus batwing or white-head batwing, is a swallowtail butterfly found in Burma, Malaysia, Sumatra, and Java. The subspecies A. p. hageni was named to honour Hermann August Hagen. It may be a full species. A. priapus is a large butterfly (11\u201314 cm wingspan). The forewings are black with the wing veins bordered by white. The hindwings are black and have a wavy margin. There is a broad, slightly yellowish white band on the hindwing. This band contains large black spots. In males there is a white area with red edge next to the body. The underside is similar to the upperside, but the white area is missing. The abdomen is yellow and black above. The head (hence the common name white-head batwing) and the underside of abdomen are white or yellow. The thorax is black. ==Subspecies== *A. p. priapus west Java *A. p. dilutus (Fruhstorfer, 1895) east Java *A. p. hageni (Rogenhofer, 1889) Sumatra, Indonesia ==Biology== Atrophaneura priapus is a Troides mimic and is, itself mimicked by females of Papilio forbesi. ==Taxonomy== A. priapus, A. priapus hageni and A. sycorax, are often confused and may represent one, two or three good species although the hindwing pouches and androconial scales are variously modified.Parsons, M.J.
