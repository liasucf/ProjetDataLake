In a positive review, Dana Scott of HipHopDX wrote that \"There are 21 tracks on jammed with booming, mellow Atlanta trap flare and some inconsistency between bangers and filler tracks with similar minimalist, psychedelic soundscapes\". Jayasuriya Mehan from Pitchfork enjoyed the album, saying, \"Except for the previously released singles that pad the end of the record in keeping with industry norms, High Off Life is better-paced and sequenced than most of Future's recent releases\u2014the whole thing seems to glide by frictionlessly\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, stating that \"High Off Life is Future at his most optimistic, as the man from Pluto decides to send out a positive message. But it's still got the spaced-out melancholy that always fills his sound, as he clocks some serious demon hours in the late-night druggy strip-club haze of his soul\". Addison Herron-Wheeler of Exclaim! said, \"Pretty much the only complaint is that, similar to all of his releases since the infamous Evol, it delivers and lives up to the hype, but it doesn't build and surpass his previous work. It remains to be seen whether he will ever create an album that is better than everything he's done so far, but this is still an extremely solid release\". Entertainment Weekly critic Gary Suarez said, \"While the commercial prospects for High Off Life remain high, Future seems, at least creatively, in a state of arrested development here. ... Still, when High Off Life succeeds, it does so extraordinarily\". NMEs Luke Morgan Britton wrote in a lukewarm review of High Off Life that \"[the] trap outlier exerts flashes of greatness... but doesn't quite fulfil his sales pitch\", adding: \"Future described his last album, 2019's The Wizrd, as the closing of a chapter, meaning that High Off Life seemed primed to signal a fresh start. Despite its glimpses of greatness, though, this album revisits too many of the rapper's trademark themes to truly make good on his jubilant pre-release promises\". In a mixed review, Beats Per Minutes Chase McMullen stated: \"For the man who elevated devastated depravity into his own art form, it can't help but feel a bit disappointing to watch him continue to coast\". ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+Accolades for High Off Life |- ! scope=\"col\"| Publication ! scope=\"col\"| Accolade ! scope=\"col\"| Rank ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Billboard | Billboards 50 Best Albums of 2020 \u2013 Mid-Year | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Complex | Complexs Best Albums of 2020 \u2013 Mid-Year | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Rolling Stone | Rolling Stones 50 Best Albums of 2020 \u2013 Mid-Year | | |} ==Commercial performance== High Off Life was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) 30 minutes after its release due to a technicality that incorporates the track-equivalent units moved by previously released singles \"Life Is Good\" and \"Tycoon\".
