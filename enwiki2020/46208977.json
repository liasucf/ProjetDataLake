She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam length of , and a draught length of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 supercharged six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines producing a total of and two BBC GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged.

When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-997 was fitted with three anti-aircraft guns, five torpedo tubes (four on the bow and one on the stern) and fourteen torpedoes. Its complement was between forty-four and sixty. ==Sensors== ===Passive sonar=== U-997 was one of only ten Type VIIC's to be fitted with a Balkonger\u00e4t (literally 'Balcony apparatus or equipment'). The Balkonger\u00e4t was used on U-boats (, , , , , , , and ).Base on war-time photographs. The Balkonger\u00e4t was standard on the Type XXI and the Type XXIII. Nonetheless, it was also fitted to several Type IXs and one Type X. The Balkonger\u00e4t was an improved version of Gruppenhorchger\u00e4t (GHG) (group listening device). The GHG had 24 hydrophones, the Balkonger\u00e4t had 48 hydrophones and improved electronics, which enabled more accurate readings to be taken.
