It was founded by law on 5 August 1968 as the 'Nouveau Lyc\u00e9e de Luxembourg' (), but was renamed by Grand Ducal decree on 19 January 1970 to its current name, after Michel Rodange, the author of Luxembourg's national epic, R\u00e9nert the Fox. Rodange counts Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission as its alumnus. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * Lyc\u00e9e Michel Rodange official website Michel Rodange Category:Educational institutions established in 1968 Category:Educational institutions in Luxembourg ",
