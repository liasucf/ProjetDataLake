    "text": "Licania is a genus of over 200 species of trees and shrubs in the family Chrysobalanaceae. Species are found naturally occurring in Neotropical forests from southern Mexico to Brazil and the Lesser Antilles. Due to increased deforestation and loss of habitat, several species have declined, some markedly so, and L. caldasiana from Colombia appears to have gone extinct in recent years. Many species are either rare or restricted in distribution and therefore potentially threatened with future extinction. Several species are used as ornamental plants. Licania fruit are important food for many animals and can also be eaten by humans. Caterpillars of a possible new taxon of the Astraptes fulgerator cryptic species complex were found on L. arborea but do not seem to eat them regularly. Like other members of its family, the genus is known for producing a diverse array of flavonoid compounds. ==Selected species== Species include: * Licania arborea * Licania caldasiana * Licania chiriquiensis * Licania conferruminata * Licania fasciculata * Licania grandibracteata * Licania hedbergii * Licania humilis * Licania kunthiana * Licania longicuspidata * Licania longipetala * Licania megalophylla * Licania michauxii - Gopher apple, ground oak * Licania morii * Licania platypus \u2013 Sansapote * Licania pyrifolia \u2013 Merecure * Licania rigida \u2013 oiticica (Brazil) * Licania salicifolia * Licania splendens * Licania tomentosa \u2013 oitizeiro (Brazil) * Licania vasquezii * Licania velutina ==References== ==External links== * Category:Chrysobalanaceae genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
