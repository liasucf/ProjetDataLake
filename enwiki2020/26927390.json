    "text": "A panorama shot of the newly renovated Billerica Mall, now The Shops at Billerica Shops at Billerica (formerly known as Billerica Mall) is a strip mall and former enclosed shopping mall located in Billerica, Massachusetts. It was built as part of a series of malls including the Woburn Mall, and the Mystic Mall. Anchor stores include Burlington and Market Basket. ==History== The Billerica Mall thrived in the 1970s up to the early 1990s. In 1998, The Billerica Flick closed down and the space is now a Dollar Tree. In 2005, Burlington Coat Factory closed off their mall entrance. Home Depot tried to locate there and rebuild the mall, but a group called \"Billerica First\" defeated this proposal in 2007. In 2009, Billerica gave RD Management 1 year to remodel the mall or it would be shut down. In the summer of 2009, the workers' tools created carbon monoxide which caused the entire mall to be evacuated and aired out. In February 2010, the roof by Kmart collapsed and the mall had to be shut down temporarily. The mall is now being converted (\"demalled\") into a strip mall. Timetable for the completion of the renovation of the mall is unknown. In mid-2011, RD Management began to add exterior- accessible store fronts and refinished the exterior of the mall with a new tan color scheme. A new sign was installed. On the new sign the mall was renamed \"Shops at Billerica\". On November 7, 2019, Sears announced that Kmart would be closing as part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide. The store closed on February 16, 2020.https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/11/07/kmart-sears- store-closings-96-stores-set-shutter-february-2020/2521653001/ ==References== *https://web.archive.org/web/20110809194723/http://www.topix.com/.../billerica.../sorry- no-sales-soaked-flooding-forces-billerica-mall-to-close-doors *http://www.labelscar.com/massachusetts/billerica-mall *https://web.archive.org/web/20110505185524/http://www.lowellsun.com/todaysheadlines/ci_17973531 *http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/10745 Category:Buildings and structures in Billerica, Massachusetts Category:Shopping malls in Massachusetts ",
