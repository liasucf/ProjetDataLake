Mount Duneed itself is an extinct volcano and the remains of the crater can be seen in the Mount Duneed Recreation Reserve. Much of the locality north of Lower Duneed Road is part of the large Armstrong Creek Growth Area, which was opened up for urban development from 2010. With the gazetting of the suburb Armstrong Creek in February 2012, Mount Duneed's southern boundary between Surf Coast Highway and Horseshoe Bend Road follows the boundary of the Armstrong Creek Urban Growth Area. The area north of Boundary Road, south of the Warrnambool railway line and west of the Surf Coast Highway, formerly part of Grovedale, became part of Mount Duneed. ==History== === European settlement === In 1852, squatter John Armstrong leased a station in the Mount Duneed area. The station covered 16 square miles and Armstrong's homestead was on the east side of Surf Coast Highway. Between 1847 and 1850 Assistant Surveyor William Pickering began work mapping the Duneed Parish and lots of c. 640 acres became available for purchase. The large size of the blocks resulted in few sales and Armstrong continued to graze livestock over the area. In 1854, the land comprising Armstrong's River Station was again surveyed and subdivided for sale. Armstrong retained 320 acres on the east side of Surf Coast Highway and renamed his run River Station.
