Standing 739 ft (225 m) tall to its structural top, the building encloses of office space. The building, designed by the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Kling Lindquist, was completed in 1991. A city ordinance declared that no building within of the nearby Benjamin Franklin Parkway may rise taller than . The Bell Atlantic Tower stands at the southernmost edge of this zone. A landscaped plaza, constructed of the same red granite as the building itself, occupies the rest of the plot, fulfilling a city requirement that 1% of the total budget for new building construction must go toward a work of public art. A banquet hall, known as Top of the Tower, occupies the top floor of the building and is available for public rentals. It was the headquarters for Philadelphia-based Baby Bell Bell Atlantic until 1996, when Bell Atlantic acquired New York City-based NYNEX and moved its headquarters to New York. In 2000, Bell Atlantic and GTE merged to become Verizon and the \"Bell Atlantic\" name became obsolete. However, the building's managers kept the original name, mainly because of the difficulties in getting all necessary parties to agree to change it. The building had been offered for sale in the past, and on August 5, 2010, it was sold to Brandywine Realty Trust. The company has since renamed the tower Three Logan Square, to better identify its location near two other Brandywine-owned buildings, One and Two Logan Square. ==Tenants== * CDI Corporation * Comcast Cable * Reed Smith * Excelacom Inc * Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC * Warner Bros.
