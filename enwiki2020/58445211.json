    "text": "Lucas (III) from the kindred P\u00e9c (; died after 1298) was a Hungarian noble, who served as isp\u00e1n of Zala County from 1289 to 1291 and in 1298. He was also known as Lucas of T\u00e1tika. ==Life== Lucas III originated from the Zala branch of the extended gens (clan) P\u00e9c, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was a son of Mark I, who appeared in contemporary documents in the period between 1240 and 1245. Lucas had four brothers, Gregory, Mark II, Stephen I and Apor.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 1. Zala branch) Lucas had five sons. One of them Apor was called with the surname \"Szentgy\u00f6rgyi\", but his family became extinct after two or three generations sometimes before 1431. His other four sons (Desiderius, Stephen II, Egyed and Nicholas) had no known descendants.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 4. Szentgy\u00f6rgyi branch) Lucas is first mentioned by contemporary records in 1289, when he already served as isp\u00e1n of Zala County. He held the dignity until mid-1291, when he was replaced by Gregory K\u0151szegi. Sometimes before 1291, shortly after the death of Bishop Peter K\u0151szegi, Lucas and his brother Apor successfully besieged and captured T\u00e1tika Castle (located near Zalasz\u00e1nt\u00f3), which belonged to the property of the Diocese of Veszpr\u00e9m. The bishop, Benedict R\u00e1d vainly objected at the royal court, but without success. Thereafter, Lucas and his offspring were sometimes called with the title \"of T\u00e1tika\". However the castle was lost to the K\u0151szegi family by 1314, when Andrew K\u0151szegi owned the fort. As a supporter of Andrew III of Hungary in his efforts against the oligarchic powers, including the K\u0151szegis, Lucas functioned as Master of the treasury in the court of Queen Fenenna of Kuyavia in 1291. He was again made isp\u00e1n of Zala County by 1298, but it is possible he held the dignity without interruption since 1289, as Gregory K\u0151szegi could usurp the title in his documents. == References == == Sources == * * Category:13th-century Hungarian people Lucas 03 ",
