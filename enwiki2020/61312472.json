Jayaram playing a romantic lead is a little hard to digest. Athmeeya has played her role with finesse. The music is decent and the cinematography must be mentioned specially.\" The Indian Express gave 1 out of 5 starts and wrote, \"Maarconi Mathaai feels like a desperate attempt to please the crowd by rehashing old tricks from the how-to-make-a-superficial-feel-good-film book.\" Firstpost gave 0.5 out of 5 and wrote \"Marconi Mathai has the air of being a film that thinks it is addressing crucial existential questions.
