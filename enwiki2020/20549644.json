She played for Runar, Larvik, Gjerpen and Aalborg DH before she again played for Larvik between 2008 and 2011. She was top scorer in the Norwegian League in the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons, and was selected Player of the Year in the league both in 2008/2009 and in 2009/2010.

On 29 November 2010 it was rumored that she would sign with top Hungarian team Gy\u0151ri Audi ETO KC, but L\u00f8ke refused to comment on the speculations until the forthcoming European Championship were over. Few weeks later, on 31 December 2010, it was announced that L\u00f8ke had agreed a two-years contract with Gy\u0151r and would join her new club after the ongoing season was finished. As Larvik's general manager Bj\u00f8rn-Gunnar Bruun Hansen revealed, they were in negotiation talks with L\u00f8ke for a while, but the excellent line player got an offer they simply could not match.
