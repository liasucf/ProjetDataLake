    "text": "Veiled Ambition is a 1-part documentary created by Rebel Films for the SBS independent network following a Lebanese-Australian woman named Frida as she opens a shop selling fashionable clothing for Muslim women on Melbourne's Sydney Road. The documentary follows Frida, described as a \"little aussie battler in a scarf\" as she develops her business in Melbourne while juggling a husband and home in Sydney and a pregnancy. A down-turn in sales after police raids on Muslim homes in Sydney and Melbourne induces Frida to stage a fashion show at the Australian Bridal Expo in order to gain greater exposure, a month before she is due to give birth. Veiled Ambition won the Palace Films Award for Short Film Promoting Human Rights at the 2006 Melbourne International Film Festival. ==References== ==External links== * *Veiled Ambition Study Guide Category:Australian films Category:Australian documentary films Category:Documentary films about businesspeople Category:Australian short films Category:2000s short films Category:2007 Australian television series debuts Category:Documentary films about Islam Category:Documentary films about women Category:Islam in Australia ",
