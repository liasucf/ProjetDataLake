    "text": "The Bombay caecilian (Ichthyophis bombayensis) is an amphibian found in India. This rather large species is found in the northern Western Ghats. The eyes are distinct and surrounded by a light ring. The tentacle is placed closer to the lip than the eye. A dark brown or greyish-brown species, it has no lateral stripes. The three names below are presently considered to be junior synonyms of I. bombayensis, as it was recently shown that all the unstriped, long- tailed Ichthyophis from the Western Ghats showed little genetic variation. * I. malabarensis \u2013 southern Western Ghats, known with certainty only from the type locality * I. peninsularis \u2013 known only from the type specimen, exact locality not known * I. subterrestris \u2013 known only from the type specimen, from Western Ghats south of Palghat Gap (Cochin and Travancore areas) == References == bombayensis Category:Amphibians of India Category:Amphibians described in 1960 Category:Endemic fauna of India Category:Taxa named by Edward Harrison Taylor ",
