    "text": "Digital Interactive Systems Corporation (or DISCover) is a company specializing in gaming technology for PCs. They are the creators of the DISCover technology which allow PC games to be played like a video game console. The technology, which features the \"Drop and Play\" engine, auto-plays CDs or DVDs and automates scripts for installing and updating games. Consoles with the engine connect to the Internet for game updates. This technology debuted at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Machines using DISCover technology include the Apex Extreme, Alienware DHS 2 and DHS 5. In August 2007, DISCover announced that their Hardcore White-Label Gaming System, or HAWGS, technology would be used for FiringSquad's Ammo digital distribution service. The following month, on September 2007, the company disclosed the InstaPlay desktop client, which improves the ease of use for accessing games. DISCover chief executive officer David Ferrigno addressed Instaplay concerns and comparisons with other digital distribution services such as Direct2Drive and Steam. ==See also== *Alienware *Media center (disambiguation) ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Computer systems Category:Sixth-generation video game consoles ",
