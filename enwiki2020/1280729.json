August Schrader (1807-1894) was a German-American immigrant who had a shop dealing in rubber products in Manhattan, New York City, United States.\"A young mechanic named August Schrader, arrived in New York in 1840 from Hamburg Germany. \" His original shop was located at 115 John Street. In 1845, he began supplying fittings and valves for rubber products made by the Goodyear Brothers, including air pillows and life preservers. He also made daguerreotype apparatus. Then he went into partnership with Christian Baecher, a brass turner and finisher. After watching divers at work, Schrader sought to improve diving helmets. In 1849, he created a new copper helmet. Later, his interest in diving led to him to design an air pump. Around 1890, after reports of English cyclists' success using pneumatic tires, August Schrader saw the need for a bicycle tire valve. By 1891 he had produced the Schrader valve, which was his most popular invention and is used today. August's son, George, is generally credited with the experimental work that resulted in the valve's creation. In 1893, Schrader patented the tire valve cap. Soon after, tire valves for automobiles were introduced. ==References and notes== == External links == *Schrader-Bridgeport website *Historical Schrader equipment *Land and Sea Collection: 1917 SCHRADER NAVY MK V DIVING HELMET *Schrader valve patent - US495064A Category:1807 births Category:1894 deaths Category:19th-century American inventors Category:American people of German descent Category:German emigrants to the United States ",
