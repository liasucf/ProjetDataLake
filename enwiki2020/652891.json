An imidazopyridine is a nitrogen containing heterocycle that is also a class of drugs that contain this same chemical substructure. In general, they are GABAA receptor agonists, however recently proton pump inhibitors, aromatase inhibitors, NSAIDs and other classes of drugs in this class have been developed as well. Despite usually being similar to them in effect, they are not chemically related to benzodiazepines. As such, GABAA-agonizing imidazopyridines, pyrazolopyrimidines, and cyclopyrrones are sometimes grouped together and referred to as \"nonbenzodiazepines.\" Imidazopyridines include: == Sedatives == Anxiolytics, sedatives and hypnotics (GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators): * Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines: ** Alpidem (original brand name Ananxyl)\u2014an anxiolytic that was withdrawn from the market worldwide in 1995 due to hepatotoxicity. ** DS-1\u2014a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator selective for the \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 subtype, which is not targeted by other GABAergics such as benzodiazepines or other nonbenzodiazepines. ** Necopidem\u2014an anxiolytic. It has not found clinical use. ** Saripidem\u2014a sedative and anxiolytic. It is not used clinically. ** TP-003\u2014a subtype-selective partial agonist at GABAA receptors, binding to GABAA receptor complexes bearing either \u03b12, \u03b13 or \u03b15 subunits, but only showing significant efficacy at \u03b13. ** Zolpidem (original brand name Ambien)\u2014a widely used hypnotic. Generic versions are widely available. * Imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines: ** Bamaluzole\u2014a GABAA receptor-agonizing anticonvulsant that was never marketed. == Antipsychotic == Antipsychotics: * Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines: ** Mosapramine (brand name \u30af\u30ec\u30df\u30f3, Cremin)\u2014an atypical antipsychotic used in Japan. == Gastrointestinal == Drugs used for peptic ulcer disease (PUD), GERD and gastroprokinetic agents (motility stimulants): * Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines: ** CJ-033466\u2014an experimental gastroprokinetic acting as a selective 5-HT4 serotonin receptor partial agonist. ** Zolimidine\u2014a gastroprotective agent. ** Linaprazan\u2014a potassium- competitive acid blocker which demonstrated similar efficacy as esomeprazole in healing and controlling symptoms of GERD patients with erosive esophagitis. ** SCH28080\u2014the prototypical potassium-competitive acid blocker which has not found clinical use because of liver toxicity in animal trials and elevated liver enzyme activity in the serum of human volunteers. * Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines: ** Tenatoprazole\u2014it blocks the gastric proton pump leading to decline of gastric acid production. == Anti-inflammatories == NSAIDs, analgesics and antimigraine drugs: * Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines: ** Miroprofen\u2014a derivative of propionic acid. * Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines: ** Telcagepant\u2014a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist which was in clinical trials as a remedy for migraine. Its development was terminated.Merck Announces Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results == Cardiovascular == Drugs acting on the cardiovascular system: * Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines: ** Olprinone (loprinone)\u2014a cardiac stimulant. == Bone == Drugs for treatment of bone diseases: * Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines: ** Minodronic acid (brand names Bonoteo, Recalbon)\u2014a third-generation bisphosphonate used for the treatment of osteoporosis. == Antineoplastic == Antineoplastic agents: * Imidazo[1,5-a]pyridines: ** Fadrozole (brand name Afema)\u2014an aromatase inhibitor. * Imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines: ** 3-Deazaneplanocin A\u2014an S-adenosyl-L- homocysteine synthesis inhibitor and histone methyltransferase EZH2 inhibitor. == Antiviral == Directly-acting antiviral agents: * Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines: ** Tegobuvir (GS-9190) - an allosteric, non-nucleoside hepatitis C virus NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor targeting the thumb II allosteric site. == References == ==External links== * Category:Chemical classes of psychoactive drugs ",
