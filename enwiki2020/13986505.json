    "text": "Jackson's Bay Cave is a very large cave system on the Portland Ridge in Clarendon near the south coast of Jamaica. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful in the Caribbean. It was discovered in 1964. Over 10 kilometres of caves have since been mapped. ==History== Pottery shards, rock carvings and rock paintings suggest that the caves were used by the Arawak Indians or Ta\u00ednos. ==Fossils== A specimen of the extinct Jamaican monkey (Xenothrix mcgregori) was found by an American Museum of Natural History expedition c. 1993-1996. Fossil remains of the Jamaican flightless ibis (Xenicibis xympithecus) and the Jamaican caracara (Caracara tellustris) have also been found there. ==See also== *List of caves#Jamaica *Jamaican Caves Organisation *The Caves of Portland Ridge - 2020 (pdf) ==References== ==External links== *Map of entire cave system *Aerial view. *Caving in Jamaica website, Guy van Rentergem.
