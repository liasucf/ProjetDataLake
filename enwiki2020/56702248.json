He was a judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court from 1908 to 1919. ==Early life== Roraback's father John C. Roraback was a farmer, the descendant of German immigrants from one of several settlements named \"Rohrbach\" in Lorraine who had settled in Columbia County, New York around 1700. He moved his family to Sheffield, Massachusetts in the Berkshires around 1846. Alberto attended public schools in Sheffield and then the South Berkshire Institute in nearby New Marlborough. He then went to the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in Lima, New York. In 1870 he entered the law offices of Judge Donald Warner in Salisbury, Connecticut to study law, and was admitted to the bar in 1872.\"Alberto T. Roraback\", Men of Mark in Connecticut, Volume II, Norris Galpin Osborn, Hartford: William R. Goodspeed, 1906, p. 15 ==Public service== Roraback became a successful lawyer based in North Canaan, Connecticut. He also was involved in Republican Party politics, serving as a delegate to the 1888 Republican National Convention and on the Republican State Committee. From 1889 to 1893 he served as Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Litchfield County. In 1895 and 1897 he was elected as a Republican to the Connecticut House of Representatives from North Canaan. In 1897 (with the Republicans back in control of the legislature) he was reappointed to the Court of Common Pleas, and then to a vacancy on the Superior Court. In 1907 he was reappointed to the Superior Court and also to the Connecticut Supreme Court (then called the \"Supreme Court of Errors\") upon the mandatory retirement of Justice William Hamersley in 1908. He retired in 1919 on reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, although he continued to work as a State Referee until his death. He was memorialized in his official obituary prepared by Chief Justice George W. Wheeler as \"one of the most competent trial court judges of his generation\".https://libguides.ctstatelibrary.org/law/judge-attorney- biographies/r Connecticut State Library online biography ==Family== Roraback married Minnie E.
