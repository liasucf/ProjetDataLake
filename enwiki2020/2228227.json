    "text": "Peter Criss is the 1978 debut solo album by Peter Criss, the drummer of American hard rock band Kiss. It was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978. The album was produced by Vini Poncia, who went on to produce the Kiss albums Dynasty (1979) and Unmasked (1980). Criss covered \"Tossin' and Turnin'\", which was a #1 hit for Bobby Lewis in the U.S. during the summer of 1961. The song was subsequently covered by Kiss on their 1979 tour. ==Songs== Much of the material on the album was originally written in 1971 for Criss's pre-Kiss band Lips. These include \"I'm Gonna Love You\", \"Don't You Let Me Down\", \"That's the Kind of Sugar Papa Likes\", and \"Hooked on Rock 'n' Roll\". The album also includes a cover of the song \"Tossin' and Turnin\" by Bobby Lewis. == Reception == Reviews for Peter Criss were mostly negative. AllMusic called it \"the most undistinguished of the bunch, lacking hooks on either the pop-metal rockers or the power ballads, as well as personality throughout.\" The album was the lowest charting of all the Kiss solo albums of 1978, reaching #43 on the US Billboard album chart. Of the four solo albums, Peter Criss was the only album to have two singles released from it: \"Don't You Let Me Down\" and \"You Matter to Me\", neither of which charted. == Track listing == All songs written by Peter Criss and Stan Penridge, except where noted. == Cover versions == *Harvey Milk covered \"Easy Thing\" for their compilation album The Singles. *Awaken covered \"I'm Gonna Love You\" on their double album Party In Lyceum's Toilets. *The Slam covered \"Hooked on Rock 'n Roll\" on their album Hit It!. == Personnel == The following musicians played on Peter Criss: * Peter Criss \u2013 lead vocals, drums all songs except tracks 6, 7, and 10. percussion on track 8, backing vocals * Allan Schwartzberg \u2013 drums on tracks 6, 7 and 10 * Bill Bodine \u2013 bass guitar on tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 * Neil Jason \u2013 bass guitar on tracks 6, 7 and 10 * Art Munson \u2013 guitars on tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 * Stan Penridge \u2013 guitars on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9, backing vocals * Elliot Randall \u2013 guitars on \"Easy Thing\" and \"I Can't Stop the Rain\" * John Tropea \u2013 guitars on tracks 6, 7 and 10 * Brendan Harkin \u2013 guitars on \"Easy Thing\" * Steve Lukather \u2013 guitar solo on \"That's the Kind of Sugar Papa Likes\" and \"Hooked on Rock and Roll\" * Bill Cuomo \u2013 keyboards 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 * Richard Gerstein \u2013 keyboards on tracks 6, 7, and 10 * Davey Faragher, Tommy Faragher, Danny Faragher, Jimmy Faragher, Maxine Dixon, Maxine Willard, Julia Tillman, Vini Poncia, Annie Sutton, Gordon Grody \u2013 backing vocals * Horns arranged by Tom Saviano * Michael Carnahan \u2013 saxophone solo on \"Tossin' and Turnin'\", baritone sax on \"Hooked on Rock 'n' Roll\" * Album artwork \u2013 Eraldo Carugati * Mike D.
