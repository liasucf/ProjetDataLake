He was a representative of the Biedermeier artistic style in Hungary.Romabuer J\u00e1nos, Magyar \u00c9letrajzi Lexikon ==Biography== He came from an ethnic German family of nine children. He was born in L\u0151cse, Upper Hungary (present-day Levo\u010da, Slovakia). His father, David Rombauer (1742\u20131806), an ethnic German Protestant, was a woodcarver. He may have studied with the Danish-born painter, in Beszterceb\u00e1nya (Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica). At the age of nineteen, he began working as a portraitist in Pest (today Budapest). His first known miniature dates from 1802. Around 1805, probably in B\u00e1rtfa (Bardejov), he met the Polish aristocrat, who, at that time, was in the service of the Russian government. Impressed by his talent, he invited him to his estate near Romaniv, in present-day Ukraine. By 1806, he was living and working in Saint Petersburg; teaching as well as painting. In 1818, he married Amalie Baumann (c.1795\u20131843), a Baltic German. During his stay, he became a member of the Imperial Academy of Arts and took part in their exhibitions. Vladimir Borovikovsky and Orest Kiprensky seem to have had a significant influence on his style. He and his wife returned to Hungary in 1824 and settled in Eperjes (Pre\u0161ov), where his brothers Matth\u00e4us (1776\u20131840), a goldsmith, and Samuel (born 1798), a butcher, both lived. Their only child, Matilda, was born in 1829. He painted numerous portraits of the nobility, Hungarian as well as Russian, and many prominent citizens of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1835, he received a commission to paint portraits of the faculty at the Lutheran College. He also created religious works. Altogether, he is known to have created 248 works, although many have been lost. His surviving works may be seen in the Hermitage Museum, the Tretyakov Gallery, the Hungarian National Gallery and the Slovak National Gallery.Be\u0144ov\u00e1, Katar\u00edna (ed.): J\u00e1n Rombauer (1782 - 1849): Levo\u010da - Petrohrad - Pre\u0161ov.
