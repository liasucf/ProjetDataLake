Schmidt;C\u0103linescu, p. 1040 1887 \u2013 1961 or 1962) was a Romanian and American poet, literary historian and translator. Cultivating proletarian literature while frequenting the Symbolist movement, he displayed both his origins in the Romanian Jewish underclass and his appreciation for the wider Romanian culture. He popularized the latter with his work in America, having left in 1913 to escape antisemitic pressures. A translator, publicist, and public lecturer, he was involved with the Romanian press of New York City, and eventually as a Romance studies academic at Columbia and Long Island. Feraru's poetry, collected in two volumes, mixes Romanian patriotism, traditionalist references, and modern industrial aesthetics. ==Biography== Born in Br\u0103ila into a modest Jewish family, his father was an ironworker (fierar), the origin of his pseudonym. He completed his basic education in his native city, graduating from the Schwartzman Brothers school and then the B\u0103lcescu Lyc\u00e9e.Ghena Pricop, \"Integrarea Comunit\u0103\u021bii Evreie\u0219ti \u00een via\u021ba cultural\u0103 a Br\u0103ilei\", in Hristian et al., p. 226.

Pen names he used in these publications were Ola Canta (shared with Dimitrie Anghel), H. Libanon and L. Feru. Feraru was friends with Jean Bart, Camil Baltazar and especially Anghel, with whom he collaborated on several poems (Halucina\u021bii, Orologiul and Vezuviul). They are thought to be mostly, or entirely, Anghel's work.Victor Eftimiu, Portrete \u0219i amintiri, p. 515.

Anghel, who died a year later, addressed his departing friend a public proof of support, the Scrisoare c\u0103tre un emigrant (\"Letter to an Emigrant\"). In his adopted country, Feraru became a constant promoter of Romanian culture, as confirmed by his correspondence and noted in the accounts of his contemporaries. He married a fellow Romanian immigrant, who had lost her fluency in Romanian; he insisted that she relearn the language, and also taught it to their child.Sadoveanu, p. 115 Initially working as an unskilled laborer, Feraru eventually became a teaching assistant at the University of Toronto. He then was a professor of Romance languages and literature at Columbia University (1917\u20131927), contributing to The Romanic Review and Rumanian Literary News (which he edited). In October\u2013November 1917, at New York's American Jewish Congress, he and Joseph Barondess were rapporteurs on the condition of Romanian Jews.\"Letters from Abroad. New York: Greater Executive Committee of Jewish Congress Called for October 14\", in The Canadian Jewish Chronicle, October 12, 1917 By 1919, he was working on the city's Romanian American community press.

In 1922, Adev\u0103rul Literar \u0219i Artistic published his recollection of \"Ola Canta\" work with Anghel, alongside his copy of an Anghel manuscript.Sextil Pu\u0219cariu, \"Revista periodicelor: 1922\", in Dacoromanica, Vol. III, 1923, p. 1026 He was later featured in Cugetul Liber, put out in Bucharest by Pas and Eugen Relgis, his texts also published in the Union of Romanian Jews organ, Curierul Israelit.Desa et al.

He was employed by Long Island University (1927\u20131947) as professor and, for a while, as head of the foreign languages department. He wrote two English-language critical studies of Romanian literature: The Development of the Rumanian Novel (1926) and The Development of the Rumanian Poetry (1929). His research received sympathetic coverage from historian and Prime Minister Nicolae Iorga: \"[Feraru's studies] are not just an enjoyable read, but also sometimes contribute innovative pieces of information and assessment, such as are worthy of one's attention.\"\"Comptes-rendus\", in Revue Historique du Sud-Est Europ\u00e9en, Nr. 4\u20136/1930, p. 113 Feraru also translated selections from Mihai Eminescu, Tudor Arghezi, Panait Cerna, Anton Pann, Vasile C\u00e2rlova and Dimitrie Bolintineanu into English. In May 1929, he gave public readings of these at Sunnyside.\"Caleidoscopul vie\u021bii intelectuale.

Retiring in June 1954,\"Nothing Can Stop Us Now, Says Moses of Civic Center\", in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, June 10, 1954, p. 13 through his will Feraru left Columbia University, which paid his pension, his library of some ten thousand Romanian- language books. He died in New York City in 1961 or, according to other sources, 1962. In 2012, relatives of his, the Schreibers, were still residing in Br\u0103ila.Camelia Hristian, \"Interviuri\", in Hristian et al., p. 313 ==Poetry== According to literary historian and critic George C\u0103linescu, Feraru's poetic works fall into two separate categories: \"moving\" regrets for his native Romania, and samples of proletarian literature, including an ode to the sound of hammers in industrial Br\u0103ila (\"his most valid\" poetry).C\u0103linescu, p. 937 Another such ode, addressed \"to the needle\" and published in Convorbiri Critice, was lauded by its editor Mihail Dragomirescu: \"Leon Feraru, a formal virtuoso, [...] presents here the sort of talent that he will rarely rise up to in later years.\"Mihail Dragomirescu, Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne \u00een secolul XX, dup\u0103 o nou\u0103 metod\u0103. S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torism, poporanism, criticism, p. 151. Bucharest: Editura Institutului de Literatur\u0103, 1934 According to Eugen Lovinescu, Feraru fits best in a \"realist and social\" subset of Romanian poets, alongside Relgis and Vasile Demetrius;Lovinescu, pp. 199\u2013209 C\u0103linescu also places Relgis and Feraru in the \"poetry of the professions\" category, with the likes of Barbu Solacolu and Alexandru Tudor-Miu.C\u0103linescu, pp. 936\u2013937 In his more sentimental poems, Lovinescu notes, Feraru showed influences from Romanian traditionalists and Symbolists: Anghel, Panait Cerna, George Co\u0219buc, and \u0218tefan Octavian Iosif; his poems of homesickness no longer relevant to the modern and \"evolved capacity for expression.\"Lovinescu, pp. 203\u2013205 According to novelist Dem. Theodorescu, who reviewed his poetry for Adev\u0103rul, Feraru could not hide his Romanian poetic soul in \"the iron discipline of American life\"\u2014\"his childhood was his nationality\". His patriotic verse, Theodorescu noted, displayed a \"grieving harmony\".Dem. Theodorescu, \"Cronica literar\u0103. Magherni\u021ba veche, versuri de Leon Feraru\", in Adev\u0103rul, January 15, 1926, pp. 1\u20132 Similarly, sociologist Mihai Ralea noted the contrast between Feraru's \"sentimentalism\", or \"unsoiled gentleness\", and \"that diabolical anthill of technology [...] that is America.\" In Magherni\u021ba veche, \"none of the poems is about American life. [...] The only sentiment that is induced to [Feraru] by that alien world across the ocean is a longing for his native country\".Mihai Ralea, \"Recenzii. Leon Feraru, Magherni\u021ba veche \u0219i alte versuri din anii tineri\", in Via\u021ba Rom\u00eeneasc\u0103, Vol. XVIII, Issue 1, January 1926, pp. 138\u2013139 ==Notes== ==References== *George C\u0103linescu, Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne de la origini p\u00een\u0103 \u00een prezent.
