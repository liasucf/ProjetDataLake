Although the reserve itself has an area of , the habitat used by the caribou extends to between and . ==Flora and fauna== Other wildlife within the reserve include black lichen peatlands and spruce forests, which are essential. There are also 51 species of bird, with 43 of them nesting in the reserve; there are also cranes and sharp-tailed grouses. There is a huge diversity of mammals, including the black bear, North American porcupine, wolf, lynx, raccoon, coyote, moose and caribou. Within Sabourin Lake, there are twelve species of fish. ==Protective measures== There have been protective measures within the reserve to preserve the caribou population, such as the hunting and trapping of their main predators such as black bears and wolves. The number of moose is also being reduced. ==References== Category:IUCN Category III Category:Protected areas established in 2009 Category:Protected areas of Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue ",
