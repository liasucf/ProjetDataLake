Released on Netflix in February 2020, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, India, and Malaysia trough We TV, other countries on Rakuten Viki, My Dramalist, as well as Youtube. ==Controversy== When the play was broadcast, a full collection of resources unexpectedly appeared online, and many unbroadcast plots were leaked in advance. Because the watermark of the leaked film reads \"Only for viewing by Dragon TV \", netizens left a message in the official Weibo of Dragon TV, but Dragon TV has not responded. The series was embroiled in a controversy after a map was seen in episode 39 that left off the self-ruled island of Taiwan and southern Hainan, and incorrectly represented the India-Tibet border, the South China Sea and the Kashmir region. According to the ministry, mistakes on the map used in the teleplay include that it incorrectly delineated the boundaries of the southern areas of the Tibet autonomous region, the colors for Taiwan and Hainan islands were different from other parts of China; and the dotted line to indicate Chinese islands in the South China Sea was missing. The issue has since been investigated by China's Ministry of Natural Resources. On August 12, the production company was fined RMB 100,000 (US$14,100) by Shanghai Municipality Planning and Natural Resources Bureau. ==Soundtrack== \"The Unknown Generation\" is the theme song of the drama. The wind echoes the plot very much. In addition to telling love stories between couples, the TV series also tells a group of young people working hard for seemingly unremarkable dreams, occupations, and hobbies. Compared with national athletes and international superstars, e-sports players may be \"unknown people,\" but this group of young people choose to ignore everyone's colored vision, insist on pursuing their dreams, and win glory for the country. The songs are composed by Tang Hanxiao. \"Couldn't Leave\" is the only English episode, sung by a Kazakh male singer, Dimash. The lyrics are simple, but the love is profound. \"So many times I wish I could leave\", tells that someone in the play wants to give up, but because of a kind of power (in the play is a group of brothers working hard together), that person persevered. The singer sang freely, which made the audience worried. Songs expressing love include \"Milk Bread\" and \"Happiness Walking Together\". \"Milk Bread,\" sung by Yang Zi, peak at 2 on Billboard China Social Chart. Li also participated in the soundtrack title For the Future (Gei Wei Lai). The singing voice is similar to his interpretation of Han Shangyan, which is convergent and low-key, seemingly absent. Even when it comes to the climax in the play or song, it expresses everything with a calm and mature character. In the middle part of the song is a child's voice. The song peak at 7 on Billboard China Social Chart and Billboard China Top 100. == Notes == == References == == External links == * * * Category:2010s Chinese television series Category:2019 Chinese television series debuts Category:2019 Chinese television series endings Category:Chinese romantic comedy television series Category:Television shows based on Chinese novels Category:Television series by Croton Media Category:Esports television series Category:Zhejiang Television original programming Category:Dragon Television original programming ",
