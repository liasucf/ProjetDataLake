She was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 22 April 1916 as SM UB-33. The submarine sank thirteen ships, damaged two others, and took a further three as prizes in seventeen patrols. ==Design== A German Type UB II submarine, UB-33 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a beam of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Benz six-cylinder diesel engines producing a total , two Siemens-Schuckert electric motors producing , and one propeller shaft. She was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, she could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . UB-33 was fitted with two torpedo tubes, four torpedoes, and one Uk L/30 deck gun. She had a complement of twenty-one crew members and two officers and a 42-second dive time. ==Fate== UB-33 was mined and sunk around the Varne Bank on 11 April 1918. The wreck of UB-33 lies below the surface of the water. The amount of clearance between the submarine and ships' keels passing directly overhead is very small, making it a risk for the heavy cross-channel ship traffic in the area. The wreck is officially classified as a war grave and therefore it cannot be deliberately destroyed. ==Summary of raiding history== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"120px\"|Date ! width=\"180px\"|Name ! width=\"160px\"|Nationality ! width=\"25px\" |TonnageTonnages are in gross register tons ! width=\"80px\" |Fate |- |align=\"right\"|8 June 1917 |align=\"left\" |Kragr\u00f6 |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|550 |align=\"left\" |Prize |- |align=\"right\"|9 June 1917 |align=\"left\" |G\u00f6tha |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|720 |align=\"left\" |Prize |- |align=\"right\"|13 June 1917 |align=\"left\" |Gertie |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|257 |align=\"left\" |Prize |- |align=\"right\"|1 January 1918 |align=\"left\" |Genesse |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|2,892 |align=\"left\" |Damaged |- |align=\"right\"|8 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Kia Ora |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|99 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|16 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Pikepool |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|3,683 |align=\"left\" |Damaged |- |align=\"right\"|16 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Commander |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|58 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|17 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Northville |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|2,472 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|19 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Commandant Baratier |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|324 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|20 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Snow Drop |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|40 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|21 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Idalia |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|23 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|21 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Irex |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|16 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|21 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Leonora |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|26 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|21 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Oryx |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|38 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|21 February 1918 |align=\"left\" |Rosebud |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|44 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|14 March 1918 |align=\"left\" |Carla |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|1,668 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|15 March 1918 |align=\"left\" |Sparkling Foam |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|199 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |- |align=\"right\"|8 April 1918 |align=\"left\" |Nyassaland |align=\"left\" | |align=\"right\"|383 |align=\"left\" |Sunk |} ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== == Bibliography == * * * == External links == * Category:1915 ships Category:Ships built in Hamburg Category:World War I submarines of Germany Category:German Type UB II submarines Category:U-boats commissioned in 1916 Category:Maritime incidents in 1918 Category:U-boats sunk in 1918 Category:U-boats sunk by mines Category:World War I shipwrecks in the English Channel Category:Ships lost with all hands ",
