However, in 1637 and 1641 she wrote letters to Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron about his son Charles Fairfax, and addressed Fairfax as \"father\" and affectionately signed herself \"daughter\".Robert Bell, Fairfax Correspondence, vol. 1 (London, 1849), p. 321; vol. 2, p. 196, now British Library. Theodosia Harington was her aunt, and the mother of Anne Dudley who was placed in the household of Princess Elizabeth.'Will of The Honorable Lady Theodosia Dudley of Norwich, Norfolk', TNA PROB 11/215/234. Elizabeth Dudley was probably chosen to join the household through this family connection.Marilyn M. Brown & Michael Pearce, 'The Gardens of Moray House, Edinburgh', Garden History 47:1 (2019), p. 5.

In 1625 a tour of North Holland by Elizabeth of Bohemia and Amalia van Solms was described in a letter, probably written by Margaret Croft. The countess was at the centre of several comic incidents.The French text is printed in Martin Royalton-Kisch, Adriaen Van de Venne's Album: In the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum (London, 1988), and with an English translation in Lisa Jardine, Temptation in the Archive (London, 2015), pp. 108-119.

Another comic piece in French features L\u00f6wenstein; \"The faithful and true record of the acts, progresses, and skill of the Countess of Levenstein, as ambassador of the Queen, during her stay at Breda\", she was not an accredited ambassador, and the jokes revolve around her food, facial expressions, and occasional use of German phrases.George Bromley, A Collection of Original Royal Letters (London, 1787), pp. 271-7.

She corresponded with Constantijn Huygens, joking that he was a \"witch\", mentioning that Lady Stafford was sending a theorbo, and writing; > \"In England there is nothing spoken of but the troublesome war which is like > to be with Scotland, and without the great mercie of God it will be the ruin > of both the kingdoms: those officers his Highness hath lent the King, which > every body says his Majesty takes very kindly, will find the difference in > the order of the wars in Flanders and the disorder there\"A Catalogue of an > Invaluable and Highly Interesting Collection of Unpublished Manuscript > Documents, Sold By Mr Sotheby, vol. 9 (London, 1825), p. 102 lot 448 (not > dated), now in the British Library Add MS 15093 ff.119-122 at f.119v, and > see Add MS 18979 f.62, Add MS 30797 ff.11-14. She continued the \"witch\" theme in their correspondence, signing off, \"I am confident your witchcraft cannot make me esteem (you) more than I do your merits\", while Huygens played along in French and became \"le sorcier\". In another letter of 1639 she reminded Huygens of his old affection for Lady Stafford, in London 17 years earlier.Lisa Jardine, Temptation in the Archives (UCL: London, 2015), p.50. An English soldier, Captain and then Colonel of the Anglo-Dutch Brigade, Sir Ferdinando Knightly from Fawsley appears in Dudley's letters of 1640, and had some kind of relationship with her.
