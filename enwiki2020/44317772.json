    "text": "Cosmic Suite is an album by American jazz pianist Matthew Shipp recorded in 2008 and released on the Polish Not Two label. He leads a quartet with Daniel Carter on reeds, Joe Morris on bass and Whit Dickey on drums. This particular lineup has not recorded before, although all of the members have played together in other combinations.Cosmic Suite at Not Two ==Reception== The All About Jazz review by John Sharpe states \"Although billed as a suite, there are no obvious links between the cuts, which inhabit that delicious middle ground between the preconceived and the extemporized where distinctions blur, making the resultant offering more unknowable than a composition, yet more structured than complete improvisation.\"Sharpe, John.
