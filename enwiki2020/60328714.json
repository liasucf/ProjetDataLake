    "text": "Oh What a Feeling is the third studio album by American R&B;, soul and gospel singer Mavis Staples. It was released on July 16, 1979, by Warner Bros. Records. ==Critical reception== A review published by Billboard in the July 28, 1979 issue said, \"Well known vocalist from the Staple Singers steps out on her second solo effort with a mixture of uptempo, disco flavored songs and midtempo, soulful ballads. Staples voice is fluid, strong and gutsy, giving this LP much the same appeal which highlighted Cheryl Lynn's exhilarating debut last year. Also contributing to this album's success is the instrumentation which is provided by the Muscle Shoals Horns, guitarists Mark Knopller, Pele Can and others. Best cuts \"Let Love Come Between Us\", \"Oh What a Feeling\", \"Loving You\", \"Tonight I Feel Like Dancing\", and \"I've Been to the Well Before\".\" Cashbox published a review of the album in the issue dated July 28, 1979, which said, \"Mavis gave the Staple Singers that distinct, gritty vocal sound, and on Oh What a Feeling she proves just how versatile she is. She soars through a mixed bag of styles on the LP - disco, gospel, straight ahead R&B; and gospel - and performs them all in flawless fashion. A torchy ballad, \"I Miss You\", the disco hit, \"Tonight I Feel Like Dancing\", and the R&B; flavored title cut are the LP's highpoints.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from the album liner notes. * Harrison Calloway - horn arrangements * Cynthia Douglas - background vocals * Donna Davis - background vocals * Pamela Vincent - background vocals * David Hood - bass * Jesse Boyce - bass * Roger Hawkins - drums * Greg Hamm - engineer * Joe Barbia - engineer * Bill Fair - assistant engineer * Bruce Bachhalter - assistant engineer * David Yates - assistant engineer * Bobby Hata - mastering * Stewart Romaine - mastering * Steve Melton - remix engineer (\"Tonight I Feel Like Dancing\") * Jimmy Johnson - guitar * Larry Byram - guitar * Mark Knopfler - guitar * Mose Dillard - guitar * Pete Carr - guitar * Muscle Shoals Horns - horns * Barry Beckett - producer, keyboards, synthesizers * George Schiffer - management * Joe Thompson - management * Koelle - make-up * Tom Roady - percussion * Sherman Weisburd - photography * Jerry Wexler - producer * Paul Wexler - supervisor * Jerry Simpson - remix supervisor (\"Tonight I Feel Like Dancing\") ==References== Category:1979 albums Category:Mavis Staples albums Category:Albums recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio Category:Warner Records albums ",
