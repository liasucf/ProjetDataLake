    "text": "The British Rail Class 56 is a type of diesel locomotive designed for heavy freight work. It is a Type 5 locomotive, with a Ruston-Paxman power unit developing 3,250 bhp (2,423 kW), and has a Co-Co wheel arrangement. The fleet was introduced between 1976 and 1984 with a total of 135 examples manufactured. The first 30 locomotives (56001 - 56030, factory classification LDE3500) were built by Electroputere in Romania, but these suffered from poor construction standards and many were withdrawn from service early for extensive rebuilding before re-entering revenue service. The remaining 105 locomotives were built by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) at Doncaster Works (56031 to 56115) and Crewe Works (56116 to 56135). Enthusiasts nicknamed them \"Gridirons\" (or \"Grids\" for short), due to the grid-like horn cover on the locomotive's cab ends fitted to nos. 56056 onwards. == Technical details == When specifying the Class 56, British Rail chose its bodyshell design to be based on the Brush Traction Class 47 design, minus some features like the obsolete headcode panel. According to the Romanian railway factory nomenclature, the locomotive was named Electroputere LDE 3500, with LDE coming from Locomotiv\u0103 Diesel-Electric\u0103 (Diesel-Electric Locomotive) and the 3500 being the planned horsepower output. ===Engine=== When introduced, the Class 56s were arguably the first of the \"second generation\" of UK diesel locomotives. The engine is a direct descendant of English Electric CSVT types, its closest relative being the 16CSVT used in the Class 50. Technical advances included significantly uprated turbochargers, gear driven camshafts in place of the timing chain used on Class 50s, and uprated cylinder heads, fuel pumps and injectors. The engine was nominally rated at , but was set at for rail use. ===Electrical equipment=== A key difference between the Class 56s and the earlier designs of the 1950s and 1960s is the use of self-exciting alternators rather than direct current (DC) generators for the generation of traction current and auxiliary supply. This produces a far more robust power unit, and greatly reduces the risk of flash-overs and other earth faults. Traction supply was rectified since the type employs DC traction motors. Many auxiliary machines (such as compressors and traction motor blowers) used the unrectified 3-phase AC output of the auxiliary alternator, and therefore run at a speed proportional to engine r.p.m. ===Brakes=== The Class 56s were the first British Rail diesel type to be built with air train brakes only, using the Davies and Metcalfe E70 system. Earlier designs had variously been fitted with vacuum train brakes, or a dual braking system. ==Background== In 1974, British Rail placed an order for 60 freight locomotives, with BREL's Doncaster Works and Brush Traction, Loughborough to each build 30.BR orders 60 interim freight locomotives Railway Gazette International October 1974 page 371Sixty new freight locomotives ordered The Railway Magazine issue 883 November 1974 page 574 Because of capacity constraints at Loughborough, Brush sub-contracted its order to Electroputere in Romania.Romanian Built Locomotives for BR The Railway Magazine issue 902 June 1976 page 284 Subsequently, the number ordered was increased to 135 and they were numbered as follows: * 56001 to 56030, built by Electroputere, Romania * 56031 to 56115, built by BREL, Doncaster Works * 56116 to 56135, built by BREL, Crewe Works Construction of the class was moved from BREL's Doncaster Works to Crewe to allow for the commencement of the Class 58 construction at the former works. Some locomotives were renumbered into the 56/3 series from 2006. This was used to initially identify refurbished locomotives introduced by Fastline but was later used for locomotives with less extensive overhauls. There are no technical differences to the Class 56/0 class. ==Operation== In service the Class 56s proved to be a strong and capable locomotive, and less prone to wheelslip than the Class 58s. However, maintenance needs were high by modern standards, and notwithstanding significant investment by Transrail and Loadhaul in their Class 56 fleets in the 1990s, the class could not compete with the more modern Class 66 in terms of availability or maintenance costs. ===Previous operators=== ====British Rail==== On 4 August 1976, 56001 and 56002 were loaded for shipping from Zeebrugge to Harwich. They were towed from Harwich to Tinsley on 7 August. Initial trials were conducted on the Settle-Carlisle Line. Subsequent examples (of the Romanian deliveries) went to Barrow Hill depot for preparation and subsequent commissioning on test trains from Tinsley, usually to Peterborough West Yard. The test train consisted of a rake of rail-carrying flat wagons, with a former East Coast Metro-Cammell Pullman vehicle marshalled immediately behind the locomotive. Testing of Doncaster-built examples was completed using the traditional Doncaster works test train, running north along the East Coast Main Line. One class member, BREL-built no. 56042, was chosen to test the CP3 bogies that were fitted to the Class 58s. It was the first of the class to be withdrawn in 1991 after only 12 years service and scrapped three years later in 1994 at Toton TMD. ====EWS==== 56115 on a railtour. The entire class passed to English Welsh & Scottish (EWS) in 1995, when it purchased the Loadhaul, Mainline Freight and Transrail Freight freight companies from British Rail. Withdrawals commenced in the 1990s, with the last withdrawn on 31 March 2004.EWS has big loco switch-off The Railway Magazine issue 1236 April 2004 page 64 Some were reinstated for use on construction trains connected with the LGV Est in France, although all such locomotives have now returned to the UK.Fertis 56 unveiled The Railway Magazine issue 1241 September 2004 page 59 In September 2011, DB Schenker (as EWS had become) placed its remaining 33 stored class 56s up for sale with most expected to be sold for scrap. UK-based locomotive provider Europhoenix tendered for three of the DB Schenker locomotives (56018, 56115, 56117) for export to Hungarian freight operator Floyd. They finally bought 56101 (from preservation), 56115 and 56117. With 56101 moving to Europhoenix, 56018 has been sold to preservationist Ed Stevenson. 56101 arrived in Hungary on 19 June 2012 with 56115 and 56117 following later in the year. These have been renumbered 0659-001-5, 0659-002-3 and 0659-003-1 respectively. In late 2011, DB Cargo UK sold 27 Class 56s for scrap to European Metal Recycling. These were 56006, 031, 032, 037, 038, 046, 049, 051, 058, 060, 065, 069, 073, 074, 077, 078, 081, 087, 090, 094, 096, 104, 105, 106, 112, 113, 133. Despite the mass sale of scrap, 56078, 087, 094, 105 and 113 were sold on to Colas Rail while UK Rail Leasing has bought a number of Class 56s, to form a pool of hire locomotives. ====Fastline==== Fastline 56303 passing Kingsthorpe, just north of Northampton station, 13 June 2007 In 2006, three locomotives (56045, 56124 and 56125) were overhauled at Brush Traction and renumbered as 56301, 56302 and 56303 for Fastline, the British freight company launched by Jarvis. They were used on intermodal traffic. The small fleet never achieved particularly impressive availability, and there were significant problems with bogies, turbochargers, and low power. Fastline dispensed with Class 56 operation due to the loss of intermodal traffic and operated Class 66s on their coal traffic until March 2010 when the company went bankrupt. 56301 was put into store, and 56302 was purchased and run by Colas Rail. 56301 was later purchased by the Class 56 Group as a replacement for their own 56040 Oystermouth, which had just suffered a serious failure. 56040 was subsequently stripped of spares and scrapped at Barrow Hill. ====British American Railway Services (BARS) / Devon & Cornwall Railways (DCR) ==== Formerly preserved 56057 (renumbered 56311) and 56003 (renumbered 56312) are now operated by British American Railway Services under their Devon and Cornwall Railways subsidiary (formerly Hanson Traction), these were frequently hired to Colas Rail to work their intermodal services between Dollands Moor and Hams Hall, steel diagrams between Boston and Washwood Heath and their Dagenham to Dollands Moor \"Transfesa\" workings in London, supplementing Colas Rail's own class 47/7 fleet. British American Railway Services currently use 56311 and 56312, along with 56303, on their own freight flows including scrap metal flows between Cardiff and the North-East, landfill flows between Wembley and Calvert and for stock moves. During 2011, 56312 was repainted into the same grey livery as 56311, but with advertising for the National Railway Museum's forthcoming 'Railfest 2012' event displayed on the body side (this has since been removed). 56128 (which was to have become 56313) is also owned by BARS. In December 2013 it was moved from Wansford (Nene Valley Railway) to their facility at Washwood Heath for evaluation for a possible mainline return but work has not been proceeded with. 56114 was stripped of usable parts and dispatched for scrapping during March 2012 and was cut up immediately after arrival at EMR Kingsbury. BARS 56091 returned to service in April 2013 but has since been sidelined due to power unit issues. 56103 was returned to service with BARS during July 2014. 56301 remains under long-term hire to BARS. In November 2017 all six remaining locomotives (56091, 103, 128, 303, 311, 312) were put up for sale.https://www.railwaymagazine.co.uk/devon-cornwall-puts-12-loco-fleet-up- for-sale/ Only 56303 was operational. ====UK Rail Leasing==== Leicester-based UK Rail Leasing operates Class 56's on a spot-hire basis. They acquired a number of locomotives from DB Cargo, that had returned from working on high speed rail construction lines and returned 56081, 098 and 104 to operational condition as of July 2014 at their Leicester depot. All three are in unbranded original Railfreight livery. Railways Illustrated for June 2014 reported that UK Rail Leasing were considering upgrading a Class 56 with new engines and electronics. There would be two 1,900 hp engines, making a total of 3,800 hp. The magazine emphasises that this is \"blue sky thinking\" and is not likely to happen soon. Further information was published in Today's Railways UK for March 2016. Three different options were now being considered. These wre: two main engines, a single main engine, or a single main engine plus an auxiliary engine. It is expected that a re-engined Class 56 would cost around \u00a31.8 million, compared to \u00a33 million for a new locomotive. In December 2017 two further locomotives (56311, 312) were acquired from BARS/DCR. However, in 2018, 16 locomotives, the majority of their fleet, were sold to GB Railfreight.GB Railfreight buys 16 Class 56s from UK Rail Leasing Rail Magazine. Retrieved 2020-08-26. ===Current operators=== ====Colas Rail==== 56049 on display at Old Oak Common Depot open day in 2017. As of 2020, Colas Rail Freight operates a fleet of 56049, 051, 078, 087, 090, 094, 096, 105, 113 and 302 on a rotating basis on all its freight movements. ====GB Railfreight==== In June 2018 GB Railfreight acquired 16 of the Class 56 locomotives owned by UK Rail Leasing, together with various parts. Some may be returned to traffic quickly whilst others may be re-engineered. The locomotives were previously owned by DB Cargo and subsequently hired to Fertis, for high speed rail construction trains in France, before returning to the UK and were later acquired by UK Rail Leasing in 2014 for spot hire. Only 56081, 098 and 104 had been made operational by UKRL, with the majority stored at Leicester depot.UK Rail Leasing launch Class 56 fleet back into main line service Locomotive (56128) ex DCR/BARS was acquired from CF Booth (scrapyard) and collected from there by GBRF directly. 56009, 031, 032, 037, 069, 311 subsequently moved to EMD Longport for Re-engineering in July 2018. In April 2019, GB Railfreight announced that it had awarded Progress Rail a contract to re-power the 16 locomotives that it bought from UK Rail Leasing. The locomotives will have their existing engines replaced by EMD 12-710 series engines, and will receive updated electronic controls. The work is planned to be undertaken at Progress Rail's Longport site and the first locomotive is expected to be completed in May 2020. The rebuilt locomotives are to be redesignated as .Progress Rail to repower GB Railfreight locomotives - Retrieved 3 April 2019. ====DC Rail==== In mid 2017, Devon & Cornwall Railways was bought by Cappagh Group a waste contractor. Branded as DC Rail the company acquired ex Fertis locomotives 56103 and 56091 from it former parent BARS. Both locomotives are now in traffic. DC Rail are also current owners of the Willesden 'F' Sidings in London, just south of Wembley. Contracts out of the yard include loaded Spoil trains to Calvert Land Fill in Buckinghamshire. With more flows expected in the coming months. ====Floyd Zrt. (Hungary)==== Floyd acquired 3 locomotives for use in Hungary. Two 56101 & 115 for operations in 2012 and 56117 as a spares donor in 2013.Brits Abroad - The Railway Magazine. Retrieved 2020-08-26. 56115 suffered damage to one cab after hitting a lorry on a level crossing. Subsequently, it was repaired using a cab supplied by UKRL from 56106 in 2017 and 56117 was also brought into use.UKRL Supports Class 56s in Hungary ==Fleet summary== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Recovery of the locomotive was a protracted affair. On 18 August, the locomotive was returned to an upright position. Its engine and alternator unit were removed on 4 September. The body was lifted from the bogies on 2 October. All were transported to Doncaster Works where the locomotive was rebuilt. *On June 1991, 56002 derailed whilst powering an MGR service at Caverswall, Blyth Bridge, Staffordshire. The locomotive remained on site awaiting recovery for around a month with one cab crushed by its MGR wagons. The 1977 built locomotive was withdrawn 8 May 1992 after only 15 years service and scrapped two years later at Doncaster MPD in March 1994, the second of the fleet to be withdrawn. == Model railways == In 1998 Hornby Railways launched its first version of the BR Class 56 in OO gauge. ==References== ===Literature=== * * * * ==Further reading== * * * * * * == External links == * Class 56 Group - owners of preserved loco no. 56045 now 56301 * Class 56 Diesel Photo Gallery *Electroputere Catalogue Entry for LDE 3500 HP-BR *The Class 56 section of Ste's railway gallery *General railway photographs in Britain BR Brush Class 56 at Paul Bartlett's Photographs 56 Category:Co-Co locomotives Category:BREL locomotives Category:Electroputere locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1976 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Great Britain Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Great Britain ",
