He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Atlanta Braves, and Houston Astros between 1983 and 1994. He is specifically remembered for his game-winning run scored in the 1992 National League Championship Series that sent the Braves to the World Series.\"Sid Bream Statistics and History\". \"baseball-reference.com. Retrieved on 2017-05-12. ==Career== ===Amateur=== Bream attended Liberty University, and in 1980 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. ===Los Angeles Dodgers=== Bream was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the second round of the 1981 MLB Draft. During his minor league career he hit .329 with 83 home runs and 407 RBI, including a .419 on-base percentage and a .537 slugging percentage in the Dodgers' farm system. Bream's minor league success led to his big-league debut with the team in . Despite his excellent power numbers in the minors, Bream demonstrated mostly gap power in the majors (resulting in many doubles), and he was known for above-average defense at first base. The Dodgers expected him to compete with Greg Brock for the first base job, as Brock had performed below expectations after longtime starter Steve Garvey left to sign with the San Diego Padres. But Bream failed to hit for the Dodgers in multiple opportunities from 1983-85. ===Pittsburgh Pirates=== The Dodgers finally gave up on Bream late in the season and traded him along with Cecil Espy and R.J. Reynolds to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Bill Madlock, who the Dodgers wanted as they pursued the NL West title. It was in Pittsburgh where Bream finally had a chance to play every day. In he set an MLB record with 166 assists at first base. Bream's best season at the plate in Pittsburgh was also 1986 when he batted .268 with 16 home runs and 77 runs batted in. ===Atlanta Braves=== Following the season, Bream became a free agent and signed with the Atlanta Braves. He suffered through injuries in Atlanta, which limited his playing time. However, he did play in two World Series, in 1991 and 1992. After a poor start in , the Braves acquired Fred McGriff from the San Diego Padres to play first base and Bream was relegated to pinch-hitting for the rest of the season. ====The Slide==== The most famous moment of Bream's career came in Game 7 of the 1992 National League Championship Series. Bream was the Atlanta first baseman, and the Braves were playing his old team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, in the NLCS. The Pirates carried a 20 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning under the pitching of their ace, Doug Drabek, needing just three outs to make the World Series. However, Drabek gave up a leadoff double to Terry Pendleton, then allowed another runner, David Justice, on an infield error by second baseman Jos\u00e9 Lind. After Drabek walked Bream to load the bases, Pirates manager Jim Leyland pulled him out of the game. Reliever Stan Belinda replaced him on the mound, and managed to get two outs, despite giving up a run on a sacrifice fly by Ron Gant. Then, Braves third-string catcher Francisco Cabrera belted a single to left field, and Justice scored easily to tie the game. Pirates left fielder and eventual National League MVP Barry Bonds fielded the ball as Bream ran toward home plate. Bonds's throw arrived first, but it was slightly offline and bounced on its way towards the first- base line. As soon as catcher Mike LaValliere received the ball, he desperately lunged toward the plate to tag Bream out, but Bream was able to slide just underneath the tag to score the winning run and send the Braves to their second World Series in a row. ===Houston Astros=== Following the 1993 season, Bream signed with the Houston Astros and served as a backup to Jeff Bagwell. He hit .344 in limited play, and retired during the baseball strike. ===Career statistics=== In 1088 games over 12 seasons, Bream compiled a .264 batting average (819-for-3108) with 351 runs, 191 doubles, 12 triples, 90 home runs, 455 RBI, 50 stolen bases, 353 walks, 450 strikeouts, .336 on-base percentage and .420 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .992 fielding percentage. In postseason play, in 4 National League Championship Series and 2 World Series (1991 and '92) covering 28 games, he batted .250 (20-for-80) with 9 runs, 3 home runs, 8 RBI and 12 walks. ===Retirement and family=== Bream retired to the northern suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he lives with his wife Michele.Premier Speakers website The couple have four children.
