The tank, built during 1917-1918, was the only one of its kind built, as testing proved it lacked the agility and maneuverability required. The crew number is often given as six, on the assumption there would be two machine gunners, a gunner and loader for the main gun, a driver and a commander. ==Construction== The tank was based on a lengthened and modified version of the suspension of the Holt Model 75, with pivoting track frames. There were ten road wheels at each side. The tank was tall, long, and wide. The vehicle had a Holt , 4-cylinder engine fitted with a General Electric generator driving an electric motor for each track; a comparable petro-electric system had earlier been used for the French Saint- Chamond that also was fitted with a lengthened Holt suspension. To prevent overheating the transmission\u2014a constant problem with electrical types\u2014a complicated water cooling system had been installed. ==Weapon systems== Like the French tank, the Holt Gas-Electric had a 75 mm gun placed low in the V-shaped nose; two removable Browning 7.62 mm machine guns in sponsons on each side. The engine and transmission were in the rear, next to a corridor leading to the only door. Only one was built as tests showed its climbing performance was unsatisfactory and it was much heavier than planned, about . ==References== ==External links== * The Holt Gas-Electric Tank * Holt Gas- Electric Tank Category:World War I tanks Category:Tanks of the United States Category:Abandoned military projects of the United States Category:Trial and research tanks of the United States Category:Caterpillar Inc. vehicles Category:Holt Manufacturing Company Category:History of the tank ",
