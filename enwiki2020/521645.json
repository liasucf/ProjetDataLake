    "text": "Solent University (formerly Southampton Solent University) is a public university based in Southampton, United Kingdom. It has approximately 11,000 students. Its main campus is located on East Park Terrace near the city centre and the maritime hub of Southampton. Solent University students are represented by Solent Students' Union, which is based on the East Park Terrace campus. ==History== The university's origins can be traced back to a private School of Art founded in 1856, which eventually became the Southampton College of Art. Mergers with the Southampton College of Technology, and later the College of Nautical Studies at Warsash, led to the establishment of the Southampton Institute of Higher Education in 1984. Southampton Institute became a university on 12 July 2005, adopting the name Southampton Solent University on 15 August 2005. Prior to 2005, Southampton Institute provided assistance to Nottingham Trent University in its provision of business focused degrees, relating to accountancy, finance and professional ACCA qualifications. Some Nottingham Trent University certificates included Southampton Institute/Solent University stamps to indicate this agreement. In 2015 the University came to an agreement with New College of the Humanities, London whereby it will validate some of their degrees. In November 2017, the Privy Council approved the change of name of Southampton Solent University to Solent University, with effect from 2018. ==Campus== Solent University has three primary locations: City, Warsash and Timsbury Lake. The City campus is in the centre of Southampton, on the east side of East Park. This campus broadly includes the Sir James Matthews building, which is situated on the far side of the park. Part of the Warsash School of Maritime Science and Engineering is on the eastern bank of the Hamble River overlooking Southampton Water, while Timsbury Lake is located in Timsbury. Main campus of Solent University (East park Terrace) ===Halls of residence=== The University has five major student Halls complexes: * Chantry * Deanery * Hamwic * Kimber (incorporating the David Moxon Annexe) * Lucia Foster Welch (opened in 1995 and named after Southampton's first female mayor Lucia Foster Welch) All the halls are located a short walk away from the main teaching buildings. They are all located south east of the city centre, between the St Mary's and Ocean Village areas of the Southampton. ==Academic profile== Solent University is a comprehensive University offering programmes across five academic Schools, including the School of Art, Design and Fashion; Business, Law and Communications; Media Arts and Technology; Sport, Health and Social Sciences and through its Warsash School of Maritime Science and Engineering. Solent's maritime courses have been ranked among the best in the world. The University generally has a growing reputation, and have been climbing the major league tables year on year - most recently reaching 81st place in the Guardian League Table in 2019. The University also has strong links with local and regional businesses, professional bodies and industry groups, all with a focus on providing the best routes into the workforce (for example the British Computer Society, Creative Skillset and the PTC). The student yachting team has often consisted of Olympians and are previous world champions. ==Research== The University also has a dedicated Research, Innovation and Enterprise Office, providing cohesive support for research and innovation through a researcher development programme and the Research, Innovation and Knowledge Exchange Awards. ===Creative and digital industries=== Solent has a strong record of research and innovation in the creative industries, with a focus on the fields of visual art and culture (history, theory and practice), music industries, screen research (film and television), and communications and creative writing. Rapidly developing research areas in creative and immersive technologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, are driving innovative research forward. We cover the range of the design process from inception through prototyping, to implementation and user experience and usability.https://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/sites/default/files/publication/mupi_digital_networks_report_2018_final_jun.pdf ===Business and society=== Working with private, public and third sector industries, Solent focuses on research areas such as marketing, the 'visitor economy', SME partnerships, international economic development, entrepreneurship and innovation, and cyber-crime. A particular focus is social policy in relation to employment, gender, and diversity in areas ranging from maritime and seafarers, to music and culture. ===Sport, health and wellbeing=== Solent University has emerged as a leading provider of academic programmes relating to the study of sport, health and wellbeing. These programmes are informed by cutting-edge research in areas such as sports science, sports development, the sociology of sport, psychology, health and wellbeing, and social care.http://documents.hants.gov.uk/supporting-troubled- families/STFPProjectupdateJuly2017.pdf A focus of current research is how sport can be used as a vehicle for social change. Research in sports science focuses on strength and conditioning, the physiological basis of human performance in a range of sub-elite and elite sporting environments, and the psychology of the coaching process.

The University radio station was founded by Giacomo Shimmings in 1998 and was originally known as Sin FM. the name came from the first 28-day FM radio licence held by the station. After applying for a Low Powered AM (LPAM) licence, the station changed its name to Sin Radio and at the same time became an online radio station. The name of the station was changed in 2009 to Radio Sonar. The rename was in conjunction with all Student Union media, part of Sonar Media rebrand. Radio Sonar has won the prestigious \"Outstanding Contribution to Student Radio\" at the National Student Radio Conference in 2010 and again in 2011. in 2012 Mel Lewis won Best Female Presenter.

Radio Sonar was nominated in the 2014 SRA awards for 'Best Chart Show' and achieved 3rd place. ===Sport=== The university has a long tradition of achieving at sailing and has won the student national yachting championships on numerous occasions. ==Criticism== The university has been the subject of media criticism in the past, being featured on BBC South's investigative programme Inside Out for rewarding students pass grades for poor standards of work. Independent experts questioned in the film asked whether some of those having work passed as satisfactory were ready to study at university at all and whether courses were 'remedial'. ==Notable alumni== * William Adkin \u2013 Cricketer * Jack Eames \u2013 Fashion photographer * Mark Evans - CEO Telef\u00f3nica UK Limitedhttps://www.telefonica.com/en/web/about_telefonica/cv_directivos/cv_mark_evans * Paul Goodison \u2013 Olympic Gold Medalist 2008 * James Hilton \u2013 Designer associated with the AKQA agency. * Una Nwajei \u2013 England women's footballer * Jenny Packham \u2013 Fashion designer * David Quayle \u2013 Co-founder of B&Q; * Camille Lepage \u2013 French photojournalist * Ricky Whittle \u2013 Actor *Jonathan Ross - TV & Radio Presenter * Ty Francis, MBE \u2013 Business Advocate to the USA ==References== ==External links== * *Warsash School of Maritime Science and Engineering Official Website Category:Educational institutions established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in England Category:Tourist attractions in Southampton Category:Universities UK ",
