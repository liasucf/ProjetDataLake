After 4 hours and 57 minutes, first seed Novak Djokovic defeated second seed Roger Federer in five sets to win the title in a repeat of the 2014 and the 2015 Wimbledon finals. ==Overview== Novak Djokovic was the defending champion and successfully defended his title, defeating Roger Federer in 4 hours and 57 minutes, 7\u20136(5), 1\u20136, 7\u20136(4), 4\u20136, 13\u201312(3), the longest singles final in Wimbledon history and the second longest Grand Slam final in history behind only the 2012 Australian Open final. Djokovic became the first man since Bob Falkenburg in the 1948 Wimbledon Championships to win the title after being championship points down, having saved 2 when down 7\u22128 in the fifth set. This is also the first time since the 2004 French Open that a man has saved championship points in order to win a Grand Slam title, and the first time that any singles player, male or female, has saved a championship point to win a Grand Slam title since 2005 Wimbledon. Djokovic became the second man and third singles player overall to win multiple Grand Slam titles after saving match point during the tournament, after Rod Laver and Serena Williams; his previous time doing it was also against Federer, that being in the 2011 US Open semi-finals, after which he defeated Rafael Nadal in the finals. This was the first Wimbledon where a final set tie break rule was introduced. Upon reaching 12\u2013all in the fifth set, a classic tie break would be played. The men's singles final was the first final, as well as the first singles match, in which the new rule came into effect, with Djokovic winning the tiebreak 7\u22123. This match was named the greatest men's tennis match of the 2010s by Tennis Magazine.https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2019/12/mens-match-decade- no-1-novak-djokovic-d-roger-federer-wimbledon-2019/86042/ ===Officials=== Chair Umpire was Damian Steiner of Argentina. ==Statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
