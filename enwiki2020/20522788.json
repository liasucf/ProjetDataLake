    "text": "Antonio de la Maza (May 24, 1912 \u2013 June 4, 1961) was a Dominican businessman based in Santo Domingo. He was an opponent of Rafael Trujillo, and was one of the principal conspirators in the assassination of the aforementioned dictator which took place on May 30, 1961. De la Maza was born in Moca, Espaillat. His family had ties to Horacio V\u00e1squez who was ousted by Trujillo when he started his reign in 1930. After attending the Corps of Military Aides, De la Maza became manager of a Trujillo-owned sawmill near Restauracion. In the context of the 1956 Galindez case his brother Octavio was used as a scapegoat by Trujillo's henchmen; he was presented to the American Government as the murderer of Gerry Murphy and killed. During the assassination De la Maza left Juan Tom\u00e1s D\u00edaz's .45 automatic pistol at the scene, a complication that facilitated the Servicio de Inteligencia Militar's work as they could identify the owner.Bernard Diederich, ibid., page 153 A few days later De la Maza and Tomas D\u00edaz were killed by the SIM when coming out of hiding.http://www.colonialzone-dr.com/people_history-Trujillo.html ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1961 deaths Category:People from Espaillat Province Category:Dominican Republic people of Canarian descent Category:Dominican Republic people of Cuban descent Category:Dominican Republic people of Spanish descent Category:1961 crimes in the Dominican Republic Category:1961 murders in North America Category:1960s murders in the Dominican Republic Category:Dominican Republic assassins Category:Assassins of heads of state Category:Assassins of heads of government ",
