    "text": "An energy superpower is a country that supplies large amounts of energy resources (crude oil, natural gas, coal, etc.) to a significant number of other countries, and therefore has the potential to influence world markets to gain a political or economic advantage. Russia has been described as an energy superpower, as have Saudi Arabia, Canada, Venezuela, and Iran. The United States is said to be a potential energy superpower because of its large shale gas reserves. Energy superpower status might be exercised, for example, by significantly influencing the price on global markets, or by withholding supplies. The status of \"energy superpower\" should not be confused with that of \"superpower\". ==Energy superpowers== Iran's oil and gas production (1970\u20132009 data, 2010\u20132030 projected) Countries dependent on Russian natural gas (2006) Russia's reserves of natural gas have helped give it the title of energy superpower.How Sustainable is Russia's Future as an Energy Superpower?, by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 16 March 2006Russia: The 21st Century's Energy Superpower? , by Fiona Hill, The Brookings Institution, 5 October 2002 However, this status has been called into question by some. As Vladimir Milov, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says: > The \"energy superpower\" concept is an illusion with no basis in reality. > Perhaps most dangerously, it doesn\u2019t recognize the mutual dependence between > Russia and energy consumers. Because of political conflicts and declining > production, future supply disruptions to Europe are likely. As a result, > European gas companies may likely someday demand elimination of the take-or- > pay conditions in their Russian contracts. This would threaten Gazprom\u2019s > ability to borrow. Putin\u2019s attempt to use energy to increase Russian > influence could backfire in the long run. According to Manik Talwani, a geophysicist at Rice University, there are two countries that are most likely to join Saudi Arabia in attaining the status of oil superpower: Venezuela and Canada.Canada: The next oil superpower? , by Manik Talwani. The New York Times 2003 Citing their enormous potential reserves (1.2 trillion potential barrels for Venezuela and 1.75 trillion for Canada's oil sands), Talwani believes that they have the reserves to become energy superpowers in the next few decades as oil production declines elsewhere. However, as Talwani notes, both need US$100 billion or more to increase their production levels up to those of true energy superpowers. ==Threats to energy superpowers== Countries where natural gas fields are located. In 2007, al-Qaeda announced a new strategy for fighting the United States. Rather than only targeting U.S. interests directly in an attempt to cripple it, al-Qaeda considers cutting off the supply of energy to the U.S. to be a high priority. As reported after a failed 2006 attempt in Saudi Arabia: : \"A major supply disruption would send energy prices soaring. Had the Abqaiq attack been successful \u2013 guards fired on cars driven by the bombers, detonating the explosives inside \u2013 some experts say oil prices would have likely broken all records. A catastrophic hit could bring transportation and other parts of the U.S. and world economies to a standstill.\" ==See also== * Energy security * Petroleum politics * Swing producer * World energy resources ==Notes== Category:Geopolitics Category:Political terminology Category:Energy policy ",
