    "text": "William Wall (8 January 1854 - 18 April 1922) was an English cricketer. Born at Wigan, Lancashire, he was a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper who made one appearance in first-class cricket. The son of Thomas Wall, the founder of the Wigan Observer, Wall played his club cricket for Wigan, before making his only appearance in first-class cricket for Lancashire in 1877 against Derbyshire at Derby. Batting in the lower-order, Wall scored an unbeaten 17 in Lancashire's first-innings, but was dismissed without scoring in their second- innings by John Platts. In his capacity as wicket-keeper he took two catches and made two stumpings. Local parish records indicate that he was by profession a collier. He died at Southport, Lancashire on 18 April 1922. His brothers, Henry and Thomas, both played first-class cricket. ==References== ==External links== *William Wall at ESPNcricinfo *William Wall at CricketArchive Category:1854 births Category:1922 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Wigan Category:English cricketers Category:Lancashire cricketers ",
