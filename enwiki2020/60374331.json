    "text": "The Right to Be Happy is a 1916 American silent Christmas fantasy film directed by Rupert Julian, based on the novel A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. Starring Julian and Claire McDowell, the photoplay was produced by the Bluebird Photoplays and released on December 15, 1916, by Universal. ==Plot== The film is a retelling of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, recounting the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, played by Rupert Julian. Scrooge is an elderly miser and curmudgeon. Alone in his room on Christmas Eve, he is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley Harry Carter. Marley\u2019s ghost tells Scrooge three spirits will visit him over the next three nights. Scrooge's first visit is by the Ghost of Christmas Past (Wadsworth Harris). The Ghost shows Scrooge's development from a young boy to a young man. He sees how he started to become a miser. Then, the Ghost of the Christmas Present (Richard L'Estrange) appears, who shows Scrooge how the Cratchit family has fared. He finds out, unless the future changes, the Cratchit's disabled son, Tiny Tim (Frankie Lee), will die. The last spirit Scrooge meets is the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (Tom Figee). This figure shows Scrooge scenes of people discussing someone's death. Nobody in the room seems concerned about the dead person. Scrooge doesn't know who the dead man is. Then, he finds out Tiny Tim has also passed. Next, Scrooge discovers he is the man whose death is celebrated. He vows to change his ways and become a new person. Finally, Scrooge wakes up at home and finds out all the spiritual visits happened one night. He also finds out today is Christmas Day. Each visit positively changed Scrooge; he transforms into a kinder, gentler man full of Christmas spirit. ==Cast== :{| ! style=\"width: 180px; text-align: left;\" |Actor ! style=\"width: 230px; text-align: left;\" |Role |- style=\"text- align: left;\" |Rupert Julian||Ebenezer Scrooge |- |John Cook||Bob Cratchit |- |Claire McDowell||Mrs. Cratchit |- |Frankie Lee||Tiny Tim |- |Harry Carter||Jacob Marley |- |Emory Johnson||Fred, Scrooge's Nephew |- |Francelia Billington||Scrooge's Sweetheart |- |Lydia Yeamans Titus||Mrs. Fezziwig |- |Wadsworth Harris||The Ghost of the Past |- |Richard L'Estrange||The Ghost of the Present |- |Tom Figee||The Ghost of the Future |- |Roberta Wilson||Caroline |- |} File:The Fire Flingers (1919) 1.jpg|Rupert Julian File:Claire McDowell 01.jpg|Claire McDowell File:Frederick, Pauline - Bonds of Love - scene 1919.jpg|Frankie Lee File:Harry Carter - The Kentucky Derby (1922).jpg|Harry Carter File:Emory Johnson 32.jpg|Emory Johnson File:Francelia Billington 1.jpg|Francelia Billington File:Lydia Yeamans Titus NYPL.JPG|Lydia Yeamans Titus File:Wadsworth Harris.jpg|Wadsworth Harris ==Preservation status== According to the Library of Congress website, no copies survive. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1916 films Category:1910s Christmas films Category:1916 drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American Christmas films Category:Films based on A Christmas Carol Category:Silent films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:American films ",
