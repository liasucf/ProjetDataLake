The fascination with such imagery is considered to be based on a lack of historical understanding rather than political leanings. In 2013, the minister of education stated that the school curriculum would be changed to include information about the Holocaust. ==Occurrences== *\"Hitler\" was the name of an Adolf Hitler-themed fried chicken restaurant in Ubon Ratchathani, also in Chiang Rai, Thailand. It changed its name to \"H-ler\" and then eventually closed down. While open, KFC considered taking legal action against them, because the Thai restaurant's logo was Hitler's head atop the Colonel Sanders's shoulders. A statement by Yum! (parent company of KFC) is as follows: \"We find it extremely distasteful and are considering legal action since it is an infringement of our brand trademark and has nothing to do with us.\" *There is a herbal laxative tea sold in Thailand. The package depicts Hitler's head with fire coming from his mouth and light beams emitting from his eyes. The caption of the package reads \"Release the Demon.\" *T-shirts are sold depicting Nazi images. One shows a Hitler Teletubby while another has an image of a Panda Hitler. *The ruling military junta of the Thai government produced a 2014 propaganda video made to teach core values of society in Thailand. In the video, a child paints a picture of Hitler with a swastika in the background. The child adjacent sees the work and applauds. *A large mural was created by students at Chulalongkorn University. It depicted both superheroes and Hitler. The university apologized. *In 2011, during a sports day parade, students of a Catholic school in Thailand dressed and marched in SS uniforms. The school later apologized after international outrage. * BNK48's member Pichayapa Natha, or Namsai, wearing a Nazi-themed shirt replete with swastikas on stage during a televised performance on 25 January 2019, two days before the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, drew criticism. ==See also== *Nazi chic ==References== Category:Neo-Nazism Category:Thai culture ",
