The club played 36 leagues games during the season winning just three times. The club also suffered first round exits in both the League Cup and FA Cup to Peterborough United and Enfield respectively. Manager Brian Talbot resigned in November 1991 to be succeeded by Ian McDonald. On 25 March 1992 Aldershot F.C. finally went out of business and were obliged to resign from the Football League. The final game played was a 2\u20130 defeat against Cardiff City at Ninian Park on 20 March. The last home game was a 3\u20130 defeat to Lincoln City, also in the league, on 14 March. Aldershot's final eight competitive games all ended in defeat and they had not won any of their final 16 games; their last competitive win was on 28 December 1991 away to Maidstone United in the Fourth Division.Aldershot results 1991/92. footballsite.
