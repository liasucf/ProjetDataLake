The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., for example, was posthumously awarded the honor on December 10, 1968. Garvey was a Jamaican political leader, publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, and orator who was a proponent of the Pan-Africanism movement, to which end he founded the UNIA-ACL. He also founded the Black Star Line, a shipping and passenger line which promoted the return of the African diaspora to their ancestral lands. ==References== Category:Human rights awards ",
