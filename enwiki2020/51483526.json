Tauber Franconia is almost coextensive with the county of Main- Tauber-Kreis, which is bisected by the River Tauber, but a small part also belongs to the Bavarian county of W\u00fcrzburg. The upper reaches of the Tauber flow through 13 villages in seven municipalities in the county of Ansbach, including the well known town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber. The source of the Tauber is in the county of Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. The most important towns in Tauber Franconia are Wertheim am Main, Tauberbischofsheim, Lauda-K\u00f6nigshofen and Bad Mergentheim on the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg side, and R\u00f6ttingen on the Bavarian side.
