    "text": "Saturday Afternoon () is a 2019 Bangladesh-German co production film directed by Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, a one shot drama is based on the Holey Artisan Bakery tragedy. The film had its world premiere at the Moscow International Film Festival 2019. ==Plot== On a nice Saturday afternoon during Ramadan, citizens enjoy sleepy day time. Suddenly, a group of terrorists takes over a cafe in the city holding hostages of employees and customers. The police soon surround the building and demand negotiation and surrenders, the terrorists fortify the cafe with gas cylinders continuing their unfair tribunal. Foreigners, the disabled, women, businessmen, artists, non-Muslims, and even Muslims with different sect are subject to brutal hostility. The media streaming live news to attract more viewers doesn\u2019t care for the safety of the hostages. Each time a hostage is executed one by one, the nightmare of violence is amplified. ==Cast== * Zahid Hasan * Tisha * Mamunur Rashid * Iresh Zaker * Intekhab Dinar * Nader Chowdhury * Gousul Alam Shaon * Parambrata Chatterjee * Eyad Hourani * Selina Black * Ellie Poussot ==Reception== In January 2019, the Film Censor Board of Bangladesh banned the theatrical release of Saturday Afternoon which portrays the July 2016 terrorist attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery as it would \"damage the country's reputation\". The censor board said that the film could \"incite religious fervour in the Muslim- majority nation of 165 million\". ==Festivals== * Nominee, CineCo Pro Award - Filmfest M\u00fcnchen * Official Selection, Busan International Film Festival 2019 * Official Selection, London Indian Film Festival 2019 * Official Selection, Sydney Film Festival.2019 * Official competition, Moscow International Film Festival 2019 * Official Selection, Hong Kong Asian Film Festival 2019 * Official competition, Vesoul International Film Festival of Asian Cinema 2020 * Official Selection, Focus on Asia Fukuoka International Film Festival 2020 ==Awards== * 2019 - Kommersant Prize Moscow International Film Festival * 2019 - Russian Federation of Film Critics Jury Prize, Moscow International Film Festival *2020 - NETPAC Award, Vesoul International Film Festival for Asian Cinema *2020 - Kumamoto City Award, Fukuoka International Film Festival *2020 - High School Award, Vesoul International Film Festival for Asian Cinema === Reviews === \u201cAs in most films that attempt to do everything in a one-shot single take, viewers soon forget technique in the heat of the evolving story. It doesn\u2019t seem to faze either the professional cast or cinematographer Aziz Zhambakiyev (Harmony Lessons), as Valerii Petrov\u2019s Steadicam goes flying around the airy restaurant with its picture windows onto a police stakeout and walls that seem to change color from blue to red to heighten the drama.\u201d- Hollywood Reporter ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2010s Bengali-language films Category:2019 drama films Category:Bangladeshi films Category:English-language films Category:Bengali- language films Category:Films directed by Mostofa Sarwar Farooki ",
