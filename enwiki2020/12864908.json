Her life has been a source of inspiration for many works in television, films, music, theater and literature. She is popularly known as the slave who became a queen.Para Conhecer Chica da Silva The myth of Chica da Silva is often conflated with the historical accounts of Francisca da Silva de Oliveira. ==Biography== Francisca da Silva de Oliveira was a parda woman born in Vila do Pr\u00edncipe (nowadays Serro), in the north of the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil between 1730 and 1735. Not unlike many other regions in Brazil, this region's population was mostly of African descent, with slaves outnumbering whites by a large margin.Robert Edward Conrad, \"Children of God's Fire\" People in the town made a living either through gold or diamond mining. Francisca lived mainly in Arraial do Tijuco (nowadays known as Diamantina) and was the daughter of a Portuguese man, Ant\u00f4nio Caetano de S\u00e1 and an enslaved African woman, Maria da Costa, who was probably from the Gulf of Guinea or Bahia. The region of Minas Gerais was unique in that it had a fairly diverse population in comparison to other slave regions on the Brazilian coast, Caribbean, and the United States. Known as \"Francisca parda\" while enslaved, Francisca's first owner was Domingos da Costa, who was from Milho Verde. After Costa, Francisca was sold to Sergeant Manuel Pires Sardinha, with whom she had her first son, Sim\u00e3o Pires Sardinha.J\u00fania Ferrera Furtado, \"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century.\" Although Sardinha listed Sim\u00e3o as one of his heirs, Sardinha never officially declared paternity of Sim\u00e3o.J\u00fania Ferrera Furtado, \"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century.\" Francisca's third master was Jo\u00e3o Fernandes de Oliveira, a diamond mine owner and mining Governor of Arraial do Tijuco, one of the richest persons of Colonial Brazil. Because Francisca later added \"da Silva\" as a surname, it is often incorrectly concluded that she was once owned by a Jos\u00e9 da Silva de Olivera. The name, however, was very common among the Portuguese at the time and offered a fresh start.J\u00fania Ferrera Furtado, \"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century.\" Sources suggest that Francisca was granted her freedom, either by Jos\u00e9 da Silva de Oliveira at the request of Jo\u00e3o Fernandes or that she was given her freedom directly by Jo\u00e3o Fernandes when he bought her from Pires Sardinha in 1753. After being granted her freedom, Chica officially changed her name to Francisca da Silva de Oliveira in order to erase her history as a slave. This was hugely beneficial for her son Sim\u00e3o Pires Sardinia who later in life was able hide his mothers slave ancestry and his status of being an illegitimate son in order to receive the prestigious Portuguese title, the knight of the Order of Christ. Francisca and Jo\u00e3o soon started a relationship. Despite not being officially married, they lived together for several years and had 13 children: Francisca de Paula (1755); Jo\u00e3o Fernandes (1756); Rita (1757); Joaquim (1759); Antonio Caetano (1761); Ana (1762); Helena (1763); Luiza (1764); Ant\u00f4nia (1765); Maria (1766); Quit\u00e9ria Rita (1767); Mariana (1769); Jos\u00e9 Agostinho Fernandes (1770). Soon after, Chica became an independent owner of a house in Tejuco on Opera Street. The house was adorned with many luxuries including an extensive garden, her own personal chapel, and furniture like bathtubs, armoires, mirrors and canopy beds, that were rare to households at the time. Chica was also the owner of many slaves who both helped her in the house and worked in the mines in the region. Chica also presented herself in a very ostentatious manner in order to help differentiate herself from the other mixed people in society. People often showed their status through their material items, which for Chica included her clothing, home, slaves, and change in name. By the end of her life she also included Dona at the beginning of her name for a more prestigious title. In 1770, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes had to return to Portugal and took along with him the 4 sons he had with Chica as well as Chica's two other sons Placid Pires Sardinha and Sim\u00e3o Pires Sardinha, whom were granted noble titles by the Portuguese Court. Their daughters remained with Chica in Brazil and were sent to then renowned Convent of Maca\u00fabas. Even after the departure of Jo\u00e3o to Portugal, Chica retained her prestige. She was a member of the S\u00e3o Francisco do Carmo Brotherhood (exclusive to whites), Merc\u00eas Brotherhood (exclusive to mulattos) and of Ros\u00e1rio Brotherhood (exclusive to Africans). Chica da Silva died in 1796. She was buried at the Church of S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis, a privilege that only wealthy whites enjoyed. ==Gender in Colonial Brazil== In eighteenth century Brazil, colonizers and slaves were both overwhelmingly male. Portuguese men had traveled to Brazil alone to seek wealth, as Portuguese women were often banned from migrating.Edward E. Telles, \"Race in Another America,\" Princeton University Press (2004). In part due to love affairs and children born between Portuguese men and African and/or mulatta slave women, freed former slaves were predominately female.J\u00fania Ferreira Furtado, \"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century,\" Cambridge University Press (2009), 15 Stereotypes about non-white women were abundant during the colonial period and while gender, race and color worked together to systemically disadvantage negro women, some individuals\u2014such as Chica\u2014used their perceived hyper-sensuality to invert gender and power relations.J\u00fania Ferrera Furtado, \"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century,\" Cambridge University Press (2009). Once socially mobile, these women were seen as even more dominant than their masters.Ibid. ==The myth== Chica's legacy was often misused to symbolize Brazil's so called \"racial democracy.\"J\u00fania Ferrera Furtado, \"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century,\" Cambridge University Press (2009). Currently, however, scholars maintain that she used miscegenation and her connections as a tool to achieve a higher social status, as did other African Brazilians at the time. Historian J\u00fania Ferreira Furtado sustains that concubinage and marriage between white male and black female in colonial Brazilian society was a way found by the enslaved to change their social position and to escape racism : Jo\u00e3o Fernandes and Chica da Silva's relationship was a scandal in colonial Brazilian society. Chica da Silva, formerly enslaved, had become one of the most powerful women in colonial America. Chica was banished from the parish church, which was reserved for Caucasians only. To show the locals Chica's power, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes built a luxurious church attended just by herself. However, as Furtado discloses, Chica attended brotherhoods exclusive to whites, as a way to try to fit into the status quo and be aware of its schemes against her and her people. Contrary to what was propagated, Chica also owned slaves, and is only known to have freed one of them. Historians view this as the main difference between the experience of Africans in Brazil and their counterparts in the United States. While in the US, African-American former slaves had a more unified movement, in Brazil they tried to integrate into white society as mixed-race people saw that \"whitening\" themselves was a way to escape from their slave past. Although slaves didn't have any choice if the master or mistress decided to use them as sex objects, some were able to use the situation, especially in regard to their offspring who were part European. The colonial Portuguese mentality was also more tolerant than the US Anglo-Saxon one on race when it had to do with their mixed-race offspring. Whereas Anglo-Saxon slave holders forced their own race-mixed offspring into slavery and sold them to other masters as well, making a profit from them, Luso-Brazilians generally freed their own mixed-race children and often granted them nobility titles. This happened perhaps because of the lack of Portuguese women that migrated to Brazil. ==Works== *Xica da Silva (movie): a film released in 1976, by Cac\u00e1 Diegues, starring Zez\u00e9 Motta as Chica da Silva.Xica da Silva e a luta simb\u00f3lica contra a ditadura *Xica da Silva (telenovela): a telenovela released in 1996, written by Walcyr Carrasco and directed by Walter Avancini.
