He seized Exeter, and was a pirate out of Carisbrooke, but he was driven out of England to Anjou, where he joined the Empress Matilda. She made him Earl of Devon after she established herself in England, probably in early 1141.David Bates, The Normans and Empire, (Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 16 He founded several monasteries, notably those of Quarr Abbey (1131), in the Isle of Wight, a priory at Breamore, Hampshire, and the Priory of St James, at Exeter. Some monastic chronicles call his father also Earl of Devon, but no contemporary record uses the title, including the monastic charters. == Family and children == He married Adelize Ballon (d. circa 1146).Bearman, R.

Robert was an illegitimate son of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester. # Eva de Redvers, married Robert d' Oyly. Between 1151 and his death in 1155, Baldwin married Lucy de Clare. Lucy was assumed to have been the widow of Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Hertford and a daughter of Ranulf earl of Chester. However, Gilbert de Clare died unmarried and without issue in 1152. One source states that Lucy was the daughter of Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare and Adelisa of Chester. They were the parents of Gilbert de Clare, who died in 1152. Therefore, Lucy was a sister of Gilbert de Clare. A charter mentioning her late brother Gilbert de Clare, and her late husband Baldwin was given shortly after Baldwin's death.Keats-Rohan,K.S.B. (2002).Domesday Descendants: A Prosopography of Persons Occurring in English Documents 1066\u20131166 : II Pipe Rolls to Cartae Baronum.p. 658 and 245.
