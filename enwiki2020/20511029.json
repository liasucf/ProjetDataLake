The team failed to improve on their previous output of 10\u20134, winning only eight games.1974 Dallas Cowboys They failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in nine seasons and this marked the only season from 1966 to 1983 (18 seasons) that the Cowboys did not qualify. The Cowboys began with a 1\u20134 start and although they went 7\u20132 afterwards, it was not enough to overcome the slow start. The season featured one of the most memorable Thanksgiving Day games in Cowboys history. Trailing 16\u20133 in the second half (and having already lost quarterback Roger Staubach to injury), little used backup Clint Longley threw two touchdown passes to lead the team to a 24\u201323 victory over the Redskins at Texas Stadium. 1974 was also a season of transition; as it would be the final season of future Hall of Fame defensive tackle Bob Lilly. Also finishing their careers that season would be fullback Walt Garrison; and center Dave Manders. Also, this would be the final season for wide receiver Bob Hayes (who would finish his career with the San Francisco 49ers the following year); running back Calvin Hill (who departed for the Hawaiians of the World Football League); defensive end Pat Toomay (who left for the Buffalo Bills); guard John Niland (who left the following year for the Philadelphia Eagles) and quarterback Craig Morton (traded early in the season to the New York Giants) in a Cowboy uniform. ==Offseason== ===Draft=== https://www.pro-football- reference.com/draft/1974.htm ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! style=\"\"| Week ! style=\"\"| Date ! style=\"\"| Opponent ! style=\"\"| Result ! style=\"\"| Record ! style=\"\"| Game Site ! style=\"\"| Attendance ! style=\"\"| Recap |-style=\"background: #cfc\" ! 1 | September 15 | at Atlanta Falcons | W 24\u20130 | 1\u20130 | Atlanta Stadium | 52,332 | Recap |-style=\"background: #fcc\" ! 2 | | at Philadelphia Eagles | L 10\u201313 | 1\u20131 | Veterans Stadium | 64,089 | Recap |-style=\"background: #fcc\" ! 3 | September 29 | New York Giants | L 6\u201314 | 1\u20132 | Texas Stadium | 45,841 | Recap |-style=\"background: #fcc\" ! 4 | October 6 | Minnesota Vikings | L 21\u201323 | 1\u20133 | Texas Stadium | 57,847 | Recap |-style=\"background: #fcc\" ! 5 | October 13 | at St. Louis Cardinals | L 28\u201331 | 1\u20134 | Busch Memorial Stadium | 49,885 | Recap |-style=\"background: #cfc\" ! 6 | October 20 | Philadelphia Eagles | W 31\u201324 | 2\u20134 | Texas Stadium | 43,586 | Recap |-style=\"background: #cfc\" ! 7 | October 27 | at New York Giants | W 21\u20137 | 3\u20134 | Yale Bowl | 57,381 | Recap |-style=\"background: #cfc\" ! 8 | November 3 | St. Louis Cardinals | W 17\u201314 | 4\u20134 | Texas Stadium | 64,146 | Recap |-style=\"background: #cfc\" ! 9 | November 10 | San Francisco 49ers | W 20\u201314 | 5\u20134 | Texas Stadium | 50,018 | Recap |-style=\"background: #fcc\" ! 10 | November 17 | at Washington Redskins | L 21\u201328 | 5\u20135 | RFK Stadium | 54,395 | Recap |-style=\"background: #cfc\" ! 11 | November 24 | at Houston Oilers | W 10\u20130 | 6\u20135 | Houston Astrodome | 49,775 | Recap |-style=\"background: #cfc\" ! 12 | November 28 | Washington Redskins | W 24\u201323 | 7\u20135 | Texas Stadium | 63,243 | Recap |-style=\"background: #cfc\" ! 13 | | Cleveland Browns | W 41\u201317 | 8\u20135 | Texas Stadium | 48,754 | Recap |-style=\"background: #fcc\" ! 14 | | at Oakland Raiders | L 23\u201327 | 8\u20136 | Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum | 45,840 | Recap |} Division opponents are in bold text https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/1974.htm ==Game summaries== ===Week 3 vs Giants=== ===Week 6 vs Eagles=== ===Week 12 vs Redskins=== Thanksgiving Day Roger Staubach was knocked out of the game. ==Standings== ==Roster== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#c5ced6; color:black; border: 2px solid #001942; text-align: center;\"|Dallas Cowboys 1974 roster |- | style=\"font-size: 95%;\" valign=\"top\" | Quarterbacks * 19 Clint Longley * 12 Roger Staubach Running Backs * 21 Doug Dennison * 32 Walt Garrison FB * 35 Calvin Hill * 37 Dennis Morgan PR * 44 Robert Newhouse FB * 40 Les Strayhorn * 30 Charley Young Wide Receivers * 22 Bob Hayes * 86 Bill Houston * 88 Drew Pearson * 83 Golden Richards Tight Ends * 89 Billy Joe DuPree * 84 Jean Fugett * 87 Ron Howard | style=\"width: 25px;\" | | style=\"font-size: 95%;\" valign=\"top\" |Offensive Linemen * 64 Jim Arneson G * 62 John Fitzgerald C * 60 Gene Killian G * 51 Dave Manders C * 73 Ralph Neely T * 76 John Niland G * 61 Blaine Nye G * 78 Bruce Walton T * 70 Rayfield Wright T Defensive Linemen * 63 Larry Cole DE * 77 Bill Gregory DT * 72 Ed Jones DE * 74 Bob Lilly DT * Jeff Hewitt DT * 79 Harvey Martin DE * 75 Jethro Pugh DT * 67 Pat Toomay DE | style=\"width: 25px;\" | | style=\"font-size: 95%;\" valign=\"top\" |Linebackers * 52 Dave Edwards OLB * 59 Ken Hutcherson MLB * 55 Lee Roy Jordan MLB * 50 D.
