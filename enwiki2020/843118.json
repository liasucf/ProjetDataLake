    "text": "The Affair of the Placards () was an incident in which anti-Catholic posters appeared in public places in Paris and in four major provincial cities, Blois, Rouen, Tours and Orl\u00e9ans, in the night of the 17th to the 18th of October, 1534. One of the posters was posted on the bedchamber door of King Francis I at Amboise, an affront and a breach of security that left him shaken. The Affaire des Placards brought an end to the conciliatory policies of Francis, who had formerly attempted to protect the Protestants from the more extreme measures of the Parlement de Paris, and also of the public entreaties for moderation of Philip Melanchthon. ==The placards== The placards carried the title \"Genuine articles on the horrific, great and unbearable abuses of the papal mass, invented directly contrary to the Holy Supper of our Lord, sole mediator and sole savior Jesus Christ\" This provocative title was a direct attack on Catholic conceptions of the Eucharist. The text supported Zwingli's position on the Mass which denied the physical presence of Christ in the eucharist. The individual who has been traditionally credited as the chief inspiration, if not the direct author, of the placards, was the French Protestant leader Guillaume Farel, but it seems probable that Antoine de Marcourt, a pastor of Neuch\u00e2tel from Picardy, was the real author: Antoine Froment averred that \"these placards were made at Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland by a certain Antoine Marcourd\".\"ces placcards avoyent est\u00e9 faicts \u00e0 Neufchastel en Suysse par un certain Antoine Marcourd\". Froment, manuscript Actes et Gestes, cahier 33, Geneva archives, noted under Number 485 of the Correspondance des r\u00e9formateurs dans les pays de langue fran\u00e7aise: recueillie et publi\u00e9e... by Aim\u00e9 Louis Herminjard (1866), p 225, note 4. Writing anonymously the following month, Marcourt took credit for the placards in the address to benevolent Readers of his anonymous \"Most useful and salutary little treatise of the holy Eucharist\", published at Neuch\u00e2tel, 16 November 1534,Herminjard's number 485, pp. 224ff, prints the address \"aux b\u00e9n\u00e9voles Lecteurs\" of the anonymous Petit traicte tres utile et salutaire de la saincte Eucharistie... (Neuch\u00e2tel, 16 November 1534), which Herminjard attributes to Antoine de Marcourt. in which he avers \"I have been moved by true affection to compose and edit in writing some true Articles on the unbearable abuses of the Mass. Which Articles I wish to be published and posted throughout the public places of the land...\" ==Aftermath== Processions were announced in all the parishes of Paris for the following Sunday. In Paris, the King himself stood under the canopy where the Most Holy Eucharist was usually carried, making a clear political statement.

Protestant sympathizers were soon identified and sent to the Ch\u00e2telet. The first condemnations were pronounced 10 November; the first of those burned at the stake, 13 November, was a cripple named Barth\u00e9lemi Milon.Herminjard, p 227, note 6. The polemic against the Catholic Church was considered a severe insult to Catholics; and the King now publicly affirmed his Catholic faith. The immediate public outcry necessitated the flight of several prominent Protestant leaders, including John Calvin, and of scholars and poets like Cl\u00e9ment Marot. In another provocative action the following 13 January, when Fran\u00e7ois had recently returned to Paris, broadsheets of a tract on the Sacraments were deposited in the streets and doorways of Paris. Later, printing was banned by royal decree.The Body broken: the Calvinist doctrine of the Eucharist and the symbolization of power in sixteenth-century France By Christopher Elwood: pp. q29-30 A few years later, Francis I issued the Edict of Fontainbleau against the Huguenots. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1534 in France Category:History of Paris Category:History of Catholicism in France Category:Posters Category:1530s in France ",
