    "text": "Mystery Dungeon is a series of roguelike video games. Most were developed by Chunsoft (later Spike Chunsoft), and select games were developed by other companies with Chunsoft's permission. The series began when co\u2013creator of Dragon Quest, Koichi Nakamura, was inspired by a fellow developer's experience with Rogue and a desire to create an original series. It began on the Super Famicom, progressing to almost all of Nintendo's and Sony's home and handheld consoles, WonderSwan, Dreamcast, Windows, and mobile devices. The series has inspired other entries in Japan and has moderate popularity, mostly with the Torneko's Great Adventure and crossover entries with the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon series, and lesser with the Chocobo games based on the creatures from the Final Fantasy series. ==Games== Although all games in the series bear the Fushigi no Dungeon moniker somewhere in their Japanese titles, only the Shiren the Wanderer games contain original characters; all other license their characters from other role-playing game franchises. The first game, Torneko no Daib\u014dken: Fushigi no Dungeon stars Torneko, a shopkeeper character from the same developer's Dragon Quest IV. Mystery Dungeon games are among the few console games in the roguelike genre. Chunsoft has also started several lines of branded Mystery Dungeon games. One features the Chocobo from the Final Fantasy series, then Gundam, TwinBee, Tower of Druaga, Pok\u00e9mon, Etrian Odyssey, and One Way Heroics is the latest crossover as of 2015. Other games who are not developed or published by the company but uses the same moniker would also appear throughout the years, namely the Touhou Project series with its spin-offs titled Fushigi no Gensokyo. ===Spin-offs=== The franchise had its first spin-off game in 2004 titled Shiren Monsters: Netsal. It is only one game based on the monsters from the Shiren the Wanderer series. ==Gameplay== Most Mystery Dungeon games center around exploring a dungeon with randomly generated layouts and fights. These are in a turn-based manner, where the player's every action such as attacking or walking, is met by the opponents' action. Chunsoft described the gameplay as being like chess. Escape from the dungeon is usually only allowed in certain places, or through the use of certain items. When the player loses the game, the player loses all money and half the items in the more forgiving variants, or loses everything and has to start from scratch in others. An effort has also been made to expand the series' gameplay features, such as adding job systems to some games, and giving each dungeon a different feel and goal. Features distinct to the Shiren the Wanderer series include the \"Melding Jar\" which allows players to synthesize items and weapons into more powerful ones. The Chocobo games further simplify the genre's difficulty to appeal to a wider and younger audience. ==Development== Koichi Nakamura, founder of Chunsoft and co-creator of the Dragon Quest series, conceived the series as Chunsoft's first original work. After the launch of the Super Famicom, they ceased working on the Dragon Quest series and began working on the Mystery Dungeon series. The series was based on the game Rogue, which has spawned its own genre called roguelike. For a week Nakamura played Rogue at the recommendation of a staff member, trying to understand the game's appeal, and concluded the high degree of challenge made the game very rewarding. Nakamura explained that the appeal of the Mystery Dungeon series is that every game is different and that players skills are constantly being challenged, which helps the player feel deeply involved. Seiichiro Nagahata, who supervised and planned the development of Shiren the Wanderer DS, explained that the Mystery Dungeon series is all about \"tension\" and \"reasoning\". ===Music=== Though the franchise is divided with numerous crossovers, the majority of its soundtracks were composed by Koichi Sugiyama and Hayato Matsuo for the Dragon Quest crossovers and Shiren the Wanderer series. Other composers such as Yuzo Koshiro for the Etrian Odyssey crossover or Keisuke Ito and Arata Iiyoshi for the Pok\u00e9mon crossover have frequently contributed in the franchise. ==Reception== The Shiren the Wanderer series has generally favorable ratings in Japan and throughout the world. Famitsu awarded a 36/40 to Demon Invasion! Shiren Castle! and a 38/40 to the original release of Magic Castle of the Desert, the highest score the publication had given to a Game Boy Color game. The series has been both praised and criticized for its difficulty, and generally noted for the uneven quality of the randomly generated levels, or \"floors\", the games produce. ===Sales=== , a grand total of 21.06 million copies across the franchise have been sold, the majority of which are in the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon series. The Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon series is known to have high sale rates among the franchise, surpassing one millon copies for most of its games like Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team and its remake Rescue Team DX, and Explorers of Time, Darkness and Sky alone. Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity was the 18th best selling game in Japan in 2012, with more than 373,000 copies sold. The Chocobo series is thought to have had middling success, with strong launch sales but not a huge popular response. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Chunsoft games Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Roguelike video games Category:Video game franchises Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1993 ",
