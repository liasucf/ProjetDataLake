    "text": "Delta Ceti, Latinized from \u03b4 Ceti, is a single, blue-white hued star in the equatorial constellation of Cetus. It is positioned very near the celestial equator and is located about 0.74 degrees WNW of the spiral galaxy M77. With an apparent visual magnitude of +4.06, it is a faint star but visible to the naked eye. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 5.02 mas as seen from Earth, it is located around 650 light years from the Sun. The star is moving away from the Sun with a radial velocity of +13 km/s. This is a Beta Cephei variable with a stellar classification of B2 IV. It varies in brightness with a period of 0.16114 days. The star is about 7\u221218 million years and has a low projected rotational velocity of around 7 km/s, suggesting it is either rotating slowly or is being viewed from nearly pole on. It has 8.4 times the mass of the Sun and 4.6 times the Sun's radius. The star is radiating around 4,000 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of roughly 21,900 K ==Name== This star, along with \u03b1 Cet (Menkar), \u03bb Cet (Menkar), \u03b3 Cet (Kaffaljidhma), \u03bc Cet, \u03be1 Cet and \u03be2 Cet were Al Kaff al Jidhmah, \"the Part of a Hand\".Star Name - R.H. Allen p.160 According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars, Al Kaff al Jidhmah were the title for five stars :\u03b3 Cet as Kaffaljidhma, \u03be1 Cet as Al Kaff al Jidhmah I, \u03be2 Cet as Al Kaff al Jidhmah II, \u03b4 Cet as Al Kaff al Jidhmah III and \u03bc Cet as Al Kaff al Jidhmah IV (exclude \u03b1 Cet and \u03bb Cet.)Jack W. Rhoads - Technical Memorandum 33-507-A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; November 15, 1971 In Chinese, (), meaning Circular Celestial Granary, refers to an asterism consisting of \u03b4 Ceti, \u03b1 Ceti, \u03ba1 Ceti, \u03bb Ceti, \u03bc Ceti, \u03be1 Ceti, \u03be2 Ceti, \u03bd Ceti, \u03b3 Ceti, 75 Ceti, 70 Ceti, 63 Ceti and 66 Ceti.
