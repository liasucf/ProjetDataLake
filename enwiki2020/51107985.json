The specific epithet (pulchella) is a Latin word meaning \"pretty\" or \"rather pretty\" referring to the appearance of this species. George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Intricata along with V. monadelpha and V. mitchelliana. ==Distribution and habitat== This verticordia grows in sand with loam and sometimes with clay, in heath and shrubland. It occurs in an area near Narrembeen, in the Avon Wheatbelt and Coolgardie biogeographic regions. ==Conservation== Verticordia pulchella is classified as \"Priority Two\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations. ==Use in horticulture== Verticordia pulchella has been difficult to propagate from cuttings and to establish in gardens. Some specimens have been grown from seed but have not survived for longer than a few months. ==References== pulchella Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Eudicots of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1991 ",
