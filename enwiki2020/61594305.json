Djibouti does not have embassy in Spain but his embassy in Paris is accredited to this country.List of embassies in Spain Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Spain also has no embassy in Djibouti, but its embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia is accredited to this country.Ficha de Yibuti Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Representation Data. == Political relations == Political relations between Djibouti and Spain have traditionally been scarce but cordial. Spain does not have an embassy resident in Djibouti. Diplomatic elations are channeled through the Embassy in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia). In the case of Djibouti, it is your Embassy in Paris that is accredited to our country. Within these limitations, Spain has always tried to be receptive to requests for help and training. It has also been receptive, provided that it has been possible to do so in a multilateral framework, to requests for remission or exchange of debt made by the Djiboutian authorities. On the other hand, the collaboration of the Djiboutian authorities has been very valuable in guaranteeing the success of the mission carried out by the Spanish Armed Forces in the context of the international fight against piracy in the Indian Ocean. In this context, more than fifty Spanish soldiers are currently stationed in Djibouti - \u201cOrion\u201d Station - in the framework of control and combat operations against piracy in Somalia on the basis of UNSC Resolution 1816. In addition, one or two ships of our Navy - according to the period of the year - permanently participate in naval operations, providing escort to the World Food Program ships that are responsible for distributing food in the main ports of Somalia. The Djiboutian authorities have cooperated at all times to facilitate the work of aerial surveillance and provisioning and supply of ships.Ficha de Yibuti Office of Diplomatic Information.

Section: Political relations. == Economic relations == The commercial relations between Spain and Djibouti are not very significant, although Spanish companies begin to find a place of opportunity, mainly in the field of renewable energies or tenders of the Multilateral Financial Institutions. Our bilateral trade represents less than 0.1% of our total exports and imports. In general, the figures of bilateral Hispanic- Djibouti trade have been favorable to Spain, with high coverage rates, but both total bilateral trade and its components have shown quite erratic behaviors. In 2012, Spain exported $7.39 million to Djibouti and imported $510,000, resulting in a positive balance of $6.88 million and a coverage rate of 1,449%. There is, however, an important potential for the investment of Spanish companies in the field of renewable energy, since the country has committed to the use of 100% renewable energy by 2020. Spain has been sensitive to the proposals of Djibouti cancellation of the bilateral debt and its possible conversion into a development program. In this regard, Spain has supported the conclusion of restructuring and debt forgiveness agreements in Djibouti within the Paris Club.Ficha de Yibuti Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Economic relations. == Cooperation == Spanish cooperation with Djibouti is very small, since that country has never been included in a Master Plan as a country of cooperation. In 2011, AECID allocated a total of 500,000 euros that were managed through the Red Cross and UNICEF. The Spanish contingent of the Ori\u00f3n detachment has made three deliveries of humanitarian aid in 2014 and one in 2015, addressed to various local NGOs.Ficha de Yibuti Office of Diplomatic Information.
