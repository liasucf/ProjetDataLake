Apneseth studied traditional Norwegian folk music at Ole Bull Academy under the guidance of H\u00e5kon H\u00f8gemo, and became Norwegian elite fiddler in 2012. He released the album J\u00f8lster 2012 with Sigmund Eik\u00e5s, Synn\u00f8ve Bj\u00f8rset, and Gro Marie Svidal the same year. This album was nominated for 'Folkelarmprisen' as best solo album. He has established himself with a more modern sound, where he is moving in landscapes of more improvised and contemporary music, becoming the basis of timbres from fingerboard and folk music. This has resulted in collaboration with the dance ensemble Carte Blanche and several improvised musical constellations, including folk and jazz based bands. This also led to extensive performing in Norway and abroad, and at the 2016 Nattjazz he performed with his own trio including Stephan Meidell and \u00d8yvind Hegg-Lunde. == Honors == * 2012: Grappa Music debutant award * 2013: Fureprisen (2013) * 2014: \u00d8ivind Bergh memorial award * 2014: Music Scholarship from Sparebanken Vest * 2014: Ingerid, Synn\u00f8ve and Elias Fegerstens foundation for the Norwegian composers and performing musicians == Discography == === Solo albums === * 2013: Blikkspor (Grappa) * 2016: Det Andre Rommet (Hubro), with Erlend Apneseth Trio * 2017: Nattsongar (Hubro) * 2017: \u00c5ra (Hubro), with Erlend Apneseth Trio * 2019: Salika, Molika (Hubro), with Erlend Apneseth Trio === Collaborations === * 2012: J\u00f8lster 2012 (ta:lik), with Gro Marie Svidal, Synn\u00f8ve S.
