Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies. It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, spreading through much of Asia. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Therav\u0101da (Pali: \"The School of the Elders\") and Mah\u0101y\u0101na (Sanskrit: \"The Great Vehicle\"). Most Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth, either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood. Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation, the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts, and their specific teachings and practices. Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, observance of moral precepts, Buddhist monasticism, Buddhist meditation, and the cultivation of the Paramitas (perfections, or virtues). Theravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand. Mahayana, which includes the traditions of Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon and Tiantai (Tendai), is found throughout East Asia. Vajrayana, a body of teachings attributed to Indian adepts, may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of Mahayana Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism, which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India, is practised in the countries of the Himalayan region, Mongolia, and Kalmykia.\"Candles in the Dark: A New Spirit for a Plural World\" by Barbara Sundberg Baudot, p. 305 ==Life of the Buddha== Ancient kingdoms and cities of India during the time of the Buddha (circa 500 BCE) The gilded \"Emaciated Buddha statue\" in an Ubosoth in Bangkok representing the stage of his asceticism Enlightenment of Buddha, Kushan dynasty, late 2nd to early 3rd century CE, Gandhara. Buddhism is an Indian religion, Quote: \"The three other major Indian religions \u2013 Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism \u2013 originated in India as an alternative to Brahmanic/Hindu philosophy\"; Jan Gonda (1987), Indian Religions: An Overview \u2013 Buddhism and Jainism, Encyclopedia of Religion, 2nd Edition, Volume 7, Editor: Lindsay Jones, Macmillan Reference, , p. 4428; , Quote: \"Buddhism and Jainism, two religions which, together with Hinduism, constitute the three pillars of Indic religious tradition in its classical formulation.\" founded on the teachings of a mendicant and spiritual teacher called \"the Buddha\" (\"the Awakened One\", c. 5th to 4th century BCE). Early texts have the Buddha's family name as \"Gautama\" (Pali: Gotama). The details of Buddha's life are mentioned in many Early Buddhist Texts but are inconsistent, and his social background and life details are difficult to prove, the precise dates are uncertain. The evidence of the early texts suggests that Siddharta Gautama was born in Lumbini and grew up in Kapilavastu, a town in the Ganges Plain, near the modern Nepal\u2013India border, and that he spent his life in what is now modern Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Some hagiographic legends state that his father was a king named Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and he was born in Lumbini. However, scholars such as Richard Gombrich consider this a dubious claim because a combination of evidence suggests he was born in the Shakya community, which was governed by a small oligarchy or republic-like council where there were no ranks but where seniority mattered instead. Some of the stories about Buddha, his life, his teachings, and claims about the society he grew up in may have been invented and interpolated at a later time into the Buddhist texts. According to early texts such as the Pali Ariyapariyesan\u0101-sutta (\"The discourse on the noble quest,\" MN 26) and its Chinese parallel at M\u0100 204, Gautama was moved by the suffering (dukkha) of life and death, and its endless repetition due to rebirth.Analayo (2011). A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nik\u0101ya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90), p. 170. He thus set out on a quest to find liberation from suffering (also known as \"nirvana\"). Early texts and biographies state that Gautama first studied under two teachers of meditation, namely Alara Kalama (Sanskrit: Arada Kalama) and Uddaka Ramaputta (Sanskrit: Udraka Ramaputra), learning meditation and philosophy, particularly the meditative attainment of \"the sphere of nothingness\" from the former, and \"the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception\" from the latter. Finding these teachings to be insufficient to attain his goal, he turned to the practice of severe asceticism, which included a strict fasting regime and various forms of breath control.Analayo (2011). \"A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nik\u0101ya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),\" p. 236. This too fell short of attaining his goal, and then he turned to the meditative practice of dhyana. He famously sat in meditation under a Ficus religiosa tree now called the Bodhi Tree in the town of Bodh Gaya and attained \"Awakening\" (Bodhi). According to various early texts like the Mah\u0101saccaka- sutta, and the Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta, on awakening, the Buddha gained insight into the workings of karma and his former lives, as well as achieving the ending of the mental defilements (asavas), the ending of suffering, and the end of rebirth in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. This event also brought certainty about the Middle Way as the right path of spiritual practice to end suffering. As a fully enlightened Buddha, he attracted followers and founded a Sangha (monastic order). He spent the rest of his life teaching the Dharma he had discovered, and then died, achieving \"final nirvana,\" at the age of 80 in Kushinagar, India. Buddha's teachings were propagated by his followers, which in the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE became various Buddhist schools of thought, each with its own basket of texts containing different interpretations and authentic teachings of the Buddha; these over time evolved into many traditions of which the more well known and widespread in the modern era are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. ==Worldview== The term \"Buddhism\" is an occidental neologism, commonly (and \"rather roughly\" according to Donald S. Lopez Jr.) used as a translation for the Dharma of the Buddha, f\u00f3ji\u00e0o in Chinese, bukky\u014d in Japanese, nang pa sangs rgyas pa'i chos in Tibetan, buddhadharma in Sanskrit, buddha\u015b\u0101sana in Pali. ===Four Noble Truths \u2013 dukkha and its ending=== alt=color manuscript illustration of Buddha teaching the The Buddha teaching the Four Noble Truths. Sanskrit manuscript. Nalanda, Bihar, India. The Four Truths express the basic orientation of Buddhism: we crave and cling to impermanent states and things, which is dukkha, \"incapable of satisfying\" and painful. This keeps us caught in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the endless cycle of repeated rebirth, dukkha and dying again. But there is a way to liberation from this endless cycle to the state of nirvana, namely following the Noble Eightfold Path. The truth of dukkha is the basic insight that life in this mundane world, with its clinging and craving to impermanent states and things is dukkha, and unsatisfactory. Dukkha can be translated as \"incapable of satisfying,\"Ajahn Sumedho, The First Noble Truth (nb: links to index-page; click \"The First Noble Truth\" for correct page. \"the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity of all conditioned phenomena\"; or \"painful.\" Dukkha is most commonly translated as \"suffering,\" but this is inaccurate, since it refers not to episodic suffering, but to the intrinsically unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and things, including pleasant but temporary experiences. We expect happiness from states and things which are impermanent, and therefore cannot attain real happiness. In Buddhism, dukkha is one of the three marks of existence, along with impermanence and anatt\u0101 (non-self). Buddhism, like other major Indian religions, asserts that everything is impermanent (anicca), but, unlike them, also asserts that there is no permanent self or soul in living beings (anatt\u0101).Anatta Buddhism, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2013)[a] [b] , Quote: \"(...) Buddha's teaching that beings have no soul, no abiding essence. This 'no-soul doctrine' (anatta-vada) he expounded in his second sermon.\"[a] Anatta, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2013), Quote: \"Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (\"the self\").\"; [b] Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , p. 64; \"Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anatt\u0101, Sanskrit: an\u0101tman, the opposed doctrine of \u0101tman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.\"; [c] John C. Plott et al. (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , p. 63, Quote: \"The Buddhist schools reject any \u0100tman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\"; [d] Katie Javanaud (2013), Is The Buddhist 'No-Self' Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?, Philosophy Now; [e] David Loy (1982), \"Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?\", International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pp. 65\u201374 The ignorance or misperception (avijj\u0101) that anything is permanent or that there is self in any being is considered a wrong understanding, and the primary source of clinging and dukkha., Quote: \"(...) anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality. According to Buddhist doctrine, the individual person consists of five skandhas or heaps \u2013 the body, feelings, perceptions, impulses and consciousness. The belief in a self or soul, over these five skandhas, is illusory and the cause of suffering.\" Dukkha arises when we crave (Pali: ta\u1e47h\u0101) and cling to these changing phenomena. The clinging and craving produces karma, which ties us to samsara, the round of death and rebirth. Craving includes kama-tanha, craving for sense-pleasures; bhava-tanha, craving to continue the cycle of life and death, including rebirth; and vibhava-tanha, craving to not experience the world and painful feelings. Dukkha ceases, or can be confined, when craving and clinging cease or are confined. This also means that no more karma is being produced, and rebirth ends. Cessation is nirvana, \"blowing out,\" and peace of mind. By following the Buddhist path to moksha, liberation, one starts to disengage from craving and clinging to impermanent states and things. The term \"path\" is usually taken to mean the Noble Eightfold Path, but other versions of \"the path\" can also be found in the Nikayas. The Theravada tradition regards insight into the four truths as liberating in itself. ===The cycle of rebirth=== Tibetan Buddhist Thangka depicting the Wheel of Life with its six realms ====Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra==== Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra means \"wandering\" or \"world\", with the connotation of cyclic, circuitous change. It refers to the theory of rebirth and \"cyclicality of all life, matter, existence\", a fundamental assumption of Buddhism, as with all major Indian religions. Samsara in Buddhism is considered to be dukkha, unsatisfactory and painful, perpetuated by desire and avidya (ignorance), and the resulting karma. The theory of rebirths, and realms in which these rebirths can occur, is extensively developed in Buddhism, in particular Tibetan Buddhism with its wheel of existence (Bhavacakra) doctrine. Liberation from this cycle of existence, nirvana, has been the foundation and the most important historical justification of Buddhism. The later Buddhist texts assert that rebirth can occur in six realms of existence, namely three good realms (heavenly, demi-god, human) and three evil realms (animal, hungry ghosts, hellish). Samsara ends if a person attains nirvana, the \"blowing out\" of the desires and the gaining of true insight into impermanence and non-self reality. ====Rebirth==== Ramabhar Stupa in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh, India is regionally believed to be Buddha's cremation site. Rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of sentient life, each running from conception to death. In Buddhist thought, this rebirth does not involve any soul, because of its doctrine of anatt\u0101 (Sanskrit: an\u0101tman, no-self doctrine) which rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in Hinduism and Christianity. According to Buddhism there ultimately is no such thing as a self in any being or any essence in any thing.[a] [b] , Quote: \"(...) anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality. According to Buddhist doctrine, the individual person consists of five skandhas or heaps \u2013 the body, feelings, perceptions, impulses and consciousness. The belief in a self or soul, over these five skandhas, is illusory and the cause of suffering.\" [c] , Quote: \"(...) Buddha's teaching that beings have no soul, no abiding essence. This 'no-soul doctrine' (anatta-vada) he expounded in his second sermon.\" The Buddhist traditions have traditionally disagreed on what it is in a person that is reborn, as well as how quickly the rebirth occurs after each death. Some Buddhist traditions assert that \"no self\" doctrine means that there is no perduring self, but there is avacya (inexpressible) self which migrates from one life to another. The majority of Buddhist traditions, in contrast, assert that vij\u00f1\u0101na (a person's consciousness) though evolving, exists as a continuum and is the mechanistic basis of what undergoes rebirth, rebecoming and redeath. The rebirth depends on the merit or demerit gained by one's karma, as well as that accrued on one's behalf by a family member. Each rebirth takes place within one of five realms according to Theravadins, or six according to other schools \u2013 heavenly, demi-gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and hellish. In East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, rebirth is not instantaneous, and there is an intermediate state (Tibetan \"bardo\") between one life and the next. The orthodox Theravada position rejects the wait, and asserts that rebirth of a being is immediate. However there are passages in the Samyutta Nikaya of the Pali Canon that seem to lend support to the idea that the Buddha taught about an intermediate stage between one life and the next. ====Karma==== In Buddhism, karma (from Sanskrit: \"action, work\") drives sa\u1e43s\u0101ra \u2013 the endless cycle of suffering and rebirth for each being. Good, skilful deeds (P\u0101li: kusala) and bad, unskilful deeds (P\u0101li: akusala) produce \"seeds\" in the unconscious receptacle (\u0101laya) that mature later either in this life or in a subsequent rebirth. The existence of karma is a core belief in Buddhism, as with all major Indian religions, it implies neither fatalism nor that everything that happens to a person is caused by karma. A central aspect of Buddhist theory of karma is that intent (cetan\u0101) matters and is essential to bring about a consequence or phala \"fruit\" or vip\u0101ka \"result\". However, good or bad karma accumulates even if there is no physical action, and just having ill or good thoughts creates karmic seeds; thus, actions of body, speech or mind all lead to karmic seeds. In the Buddhist traditions, life aspects affected by the law of karma in past and current births of a being include the form of rebirth, realm of rebirth, social class, character and major circumstances of a lifetime. It operates like the laws of physics, without external intervention, on every being in all six realms of existence including human beings and gods. A notable aspect of the karma theory in Buddhism is merit transfer. A person accumulates merit not only through intentions and ethical living, but also is able to gain merit from others by exchanging goods and services, such as through d\u0101na (charity to monks or nuns). Further, a person can transfer one's own good karma to living family members and ancestors. ===Liberation=== aniconic depiction of the Buddha's spiritual liberation (moksha) or awakening (bodhi), at Sanchi. The Buddha is not depicted, only symbolized by the Bodhi tree and the empty seat. The cessation of the kleshas and the attainment of nirvana (nibb\u0101na), with which the cycle of rebirth ends, has been the primary and the soteriological goal of the Buddhist path for monastic life since the time of the Buddha. The term \"path\" is usually taken to mean the Noble Eightfold Path, but other versions of \"the path\" can also be found in the Nikayas. In some passages in the Pali Canon, a distinction is being made between right knowledge or insight (samm\u0101- \u00f1\u0101\u1e47a), and right liberation or release (samm\u0101-vimutti), as the means to attain cessation and liberation. Nirvana literally means \"blowing out, quenching, becoming extinguished\". In early Buddhist texts, it is the state of restraint and self-control that leads to the \"blowing out\" and the ending of the cycles of sufferings associated with rebirths and redeaths., Quote: \"This general scheme remained basic to later Hinduism, to Jainism, and to Buddhism. Eternal salvation, to use the Christian term, is not conceived of as world without end; we have already got that, called samsara, the world of rebirth and redeath: that is the problem, not the solution. The ultimate aim is the timeless state of moksha, or as the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it, nirvana.\" Many later Buddhist texts describe nirvana as identical with anatta with complete \"emptiness, nothingness\". In some texts, the state is described with greater detail, such as passing through the gate of emptiness (sunyata) \u2013 realising that there is no soul or self in any living being, then passing through the gate of signlessness (animitta) \u2013 realising that nirvana cannot be perceived, and finally passing through the gate of wishlessness (apranihita) \u2013 realising that nirvana is the state of not even wishing for nirvana. The nirvana state has been described in Buddhist texts partly in a manner similar to other Indian religions, as the state of complete liberation, enlightenment, highest happiness, bliss, fearlessness, freedom, permanence, non-dependent origination, unfathomable, and indescribable. It has also been described in part differently, as a state of spiritual release marked by \"emptiness\" and realisation of non-self. While Buddhism considers the liberation from sa\u1e43s\u0101ra as the ultimate spiritual goal, in traditional practice, the primary focus of a vast majority of lay Buddhists has been to seek and accumulate merit through good deeds, donations to monks and various Buddhist rituals in order to gain better rebirths rather than nirvana. ===Dependent arising=== Pratityasamutpada, also called \"dependent arising, or dependent origination\", is the Buddhist theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except the state of nirvana. All physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease.John Bowker, The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions (1997), Oxford University Press, The 'dependent arisings' have a causal conditioning, and thus Pratityasamutpada is the Buddhist belief that causality is the basis of ontology, not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self (Brahman) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'., Quote: \"[Buddhism's ontological hypotheses] that nothing in reality has its own-being and that all phenomena reduce to the relativities of pratitya samutpada. The Buddhist ontological hypothesese deny that there is any ontologically ultimate object such a God, Brahman, the Dao, or any transcendent creative source or principle.\" However, the Buddhist thought does not understand causality in terms of Newtonian mechanics, rather it understands it as conditioned arising. In Buddhism, dependent arising is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate a phenomenon within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of the realms of existence for another lifetime. Buddhism applies the dependent arising theory to explain origination of endless cycles of dukkha and rebirth, through its Twelve Nid\u0101nas or \"twelve links\" doctrine. It states that because Avidy\u0101 (ignorance) exists Sa\u1e43sk\u0101ras (karmic formations) exists, because Sa\u1e43sk\u0101ras exists therefore Vij\u00f1\u0101na (consciousness) exists, and in a similar manner it links N\u0101mar\u016bpa (sentient body), \u1e62a\u1e0d\u0101yatana (six senses), Spar\u015ba (sensory stimulation), Vedan\u0101 (feeling), Ta\u1e47h\u0101 (craving), Up\u0101d\u0101na (grasping), Bhava (becoming), J\u0101ti (birth), and Jar\u0101mara\u1e47a (old age, death, sorrow, pain). By breaking the circuitous links of the Twelve Nidanas, Buddhism asserts that liberation from these endless cycles of rebirth and dukkha can be attained. ===Not-Self and Emptiness=== A related doctrine in Buddhism is that of anatt\u0101 (Pali) or an\u0101tman (Sanskrit). It is the view that there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul or essence in phenomena. The Buddha and Buddhist philosophers who follow him such as Vasubandhu and Buddhaghosa, generally argue for this view through by analyzing the person through the schema of the five aggregates, and then attempting to show that none of these five components of personality can be permanent or absolute.Siderits, Mark (2007). \"Buddhism as philosophy,\" p. 39 This can be seen in Buddhist discourses such as the Anattalakkhana Sutta. \"Emptiness\" or \"voidness\" (Skt: \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101, Pali: Su\u00f1\u00f1at\u0101), is a related concept with many different interpretations throughout the various Buddhisms. In early Buddhism, it was commonly stated that all five aggregates are void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), coreless (as\u0101raka), for example as in the Phe\u1e47api\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bpama Sutta (SN 22:95).Shi Huifeng, Is \"Illusion\" a Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor, Fo Guang University, Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol.2, 2016. Similarly, in Theravada Buddhism, it often simply means that the five aggregates are empty of a Self.Ronkin, Noa (2005). \"Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition\" p. 91. RoutledgeCurzon. Emptiness is a central concept in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, especially in Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka school, and in the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutras. In Madhyamaka philosophy, emptiness is the view which holds that all phenomena (dharmas) are without any svabhava (literally \"own-nature\" or \"self-nature\"), and are thus without any underlying essence, and so are \"empty\" of being independent. This doctrine sought to refute the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time. === The Three Jewels === Dharma Wheel and triratna symbols from Sanchi Stupa number 2. All forms of Buddhism revere and take spiritual refuge in the \"three jewels\" (triratna): Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. ==== Buddha ==== While all varieties of Buddhism revere \"Buddha\" and \"buddhahood\", they have different views on what these are. Whatever that may be, \"Buddha\" is still central to all forms of Buddhism. In Theravada Buddhism, a Buddha is someone who has become awake through their own efforts and insight. They have put an end to their cycle of rebirths and have ended all unwholesome mental states which lead to bad action and thus are morally perfected.Crosby, Kate (2013). \"Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity,\" p. 16. John Wiley & Sons. While subject to the limitations of the human body in certain ways (for example, in the early texts, the Buddha suffers from backaches), a Buddha is said to be \"deep, immeasurable, hard-to-fathom as is the great ocean,\" and also has immense psychic powers (abhij\u00f1\u0101). Theravada generally sees Gautama Buddha (the historical Buddha Sakyamuni) as the only Buddha of the current era. While he is no longer in this world, he has left us the Dharma (Teaching), the Vinaya (Discipline) and the Sangha (Community).Crosby, Kate (2013). \"Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity,\" p. 21. John Wiley & Sons. There are also said to be two types of Buddhas, a sammasambuddha is also said to teach the Dharma to others, while a paccekabuddha (solitary buddha) does not teach. Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism meanwhile, has a vastly expanded cosmology, with various Buddhas and other holy beings (aryas) residing in different realms. Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts not only revere numerous Buddhas besides Sakyamuni, such as Amitabha and Vairocana, but also see them as transcendental or supramundane (lokuttara) beings. Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism holds that these other Buddhas in other realms can be contacted and are able to benefit beings in this world. In Mah\u0101y\u0101na, a Buddha is a kind of \"spiritual king\", a \"protector of all creatures\" with a lifetime that is countless of eons long, rather than just a human teacher who has transcended the world after death. Buddha Sakyamuni's life and death on earth is then usually understood as a \"mere appearance\" or \"a manifestation skilfully projected into earthly life by a long-enlightened transcendent being, who is still available to teach the faithful through visionary experiences.\" ==== Dharma ==== \"Dharma\" (Pali: Dhamma) in Buddhism refers to the Buddha's teaching, which includes all of the main ideas outlined above. While this teaching reflects the true nature of reality, it is not a belief to be clung to, but a pragmatic teaching to be put into practice. It is likened to a raft which is \"for crossing over\" (to nirvana) not for holding on to. It also refers to the universal law and cosmic order which that teaching both reveals and relies upon.\"Dharma\", The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions. It is an everlasting principle which applies to all beings and worlds. In that sense it is also the ultimate truth and reality about the universe, it is thus \"the way that things really are.\" The Dharma is the second of the three jewels which all Buddhists take refuge in. All Buddhas in all worlds, in the past, present and in the future, are believed by Buddhists to understand and teach the Dharma. Indeed, it is part of what makes them a Buddha that they do so. ==== Sangha ==== Buddhist monks and nuns praying in the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple of Singapore The third \"jewel\" which Buddhists take refuge in is the \"Sangha\", which refers to the monastic community of monks and nuns who follow Gautama Buddha's monastic discipline which was \"designed to shape the Sangha as an ideal community, with the optimum conditions for spiritual growth.\" The Sangha consists of those who have chosen to follow the Buddha's ideal way of life, which is one of celibate monastic renunciation with minimal material possessions (such as an alms bowl and robes). The Sangha is seen as important because they preserve and pass down Buddha Dharma. As Gethin states \"the Sangha lives the teaching, preserves the teaching as Scriptures and teaches the wider community. Without the Sangha there is no Buddhism.\" The Sangha also acts as a \"field of merit\" for laypersons, allowing them to make spiritual merit or goodness by donating to the Sangha and supporting them. In return, they keep their duty to preserve and spread the Dharma everywhere for the good of the world. The Sangha is also supposed to follow the Vinaya (monastic rule) of the Buddha, thereby serving as an spiritual example for the world and future generations. The Vinaya rules also force the Sangha to live in dependence on the rest of the lay community (they must beg for food etc) and thus draw the Sangha into a relationship with the lay community. A depiction of Siddhartha Gautama in a previous life prostrating before the past Buddha Dipankara. After making a resolve to be a Buddha, and receiving a prediction of future Buddhahood, he becomes a \"bodhisatta\". There is also a separate definition of Sangha, referring to those who have attained any stage of awakening, whether or not they are monastics. This sangha is called the \u0101ryasa\u1e45gha \"noble Sangha\". All forms of Buddhism generally reveres these \u0101ryas (Pali: ariya, \"noble ones\" or \"holy ones\") who are spiritually attained beings. Aryas have attained the fruits of the Buddhist path.Williams, Paul (2002), \"Buddhist Thought\", p. 52, Taylor & Francis Kindle Edition Becoming an arya is a goal in most forms of Buddhism. The \u0101ryasa\u1e45gha includes holy beings such as bodhisattvas, arhats and stream- enterers. Bodhisattva Maitreya, Pakistan (3rd century), Metropolitan Museum of Art. In early Buddhism and in Theravada Buddhism, an arhat (literally meaning \"worthy\") is someone who reached the same awakening (bodhi) of a Buddha by following the teaching of a Buddha.Snelling, John (1987), The Buddhist handbook. A Complete Guide to Buddhist Teaching and Practice. London: Century Paperbacks. p. 81 They are seen as having ended rebirth and all the mental defilements. A bodhisattva (\"a being bound for awakening\") meanwhile, is simply a name for someone who is working towards awakening (bodhi) as a Buddha. According to all the early buddhist schools as well as Theravada, to be considered a bodhisattva one has to have made a vow in front of a living Buddha and also has to have received a confirmation of one's future Buddhahood.Drewes, David, Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras and Opening of the Bodhisattva Path, Paper presented at the XVIII the IABS Congress, Toronto 2017, Updated 2019. In Theravada, the future Buddha is called Metteyya (Maitreya) and he is revered as a bodhisatta currently working for future Buddhahood. Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism generally sees the attainment of the arhat as an inferior one, since it is seen as being done only for the sake of individual liberation. It thus promotes the bodhisattva path as the highest and most worthwhile. While in Mah\u0101y\u0101na, anyone who has given rise to bodhicitta (the wish to become a Buddha that arises from a sense of compassion for all beings) is considered a bodhisattva, some of these holy beings (such as Maitreya and Avalokiteshvara) have reached very high levels of spiritual attainment and are seen as being very powerful supramundane beings who provide aid to countless beings through their advanced powers. ===Other key Mah\u0101y\u0101na views=== Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism also differs from Theravada and the other schools of early Buddhism in promoting several unique doctrines which are contained in Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras and philosophical treatises. One of these is the unique interpretation of emptiness and dependent origination found in the Madhyamaka school. Another very influential doctrine for Mah\u0101y\u0101na is the main philosophical view of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school variously, termed Vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101-v\u0101da (\"the doctrine that there are only ideas\" or \"mental impressions\") or Vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101da (\"the doctrine of consciousness\"). According to Mark Siderits, what classical Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thinkers like Vasubandhu had in mind is that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions, which may appear as external objects, but \"there is actually no such thing outside the mind.\"Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, p. 149. There are several interpretations of this main theory, many scholars see it as a type of Idealism, others as a kind of phenomenology. Another very influential concept unique to Mah\u0101y\u0101na is that of \"Buddha-nature\" (buddhadh\u0101tu) or \"Tathagata-womb\" (tath\u0101gatagarbha). Buddha- nature is a concept found in some 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts, such as the Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras. According to Paul Williams these Sutras suggest that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core inner nature, Self'. According to Karl Brunnholzl \"the earliest mahayana sutras that are based on and discuss the notion of tath\u0101gatagarbha as the buddha potential that is innate in all sentient beings began to appear in written form in the late second and early third century.\"Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston & London, 2014, page 3. For some, the doctrine seems to conflict with the Buddhist anatta doctrine (non-Self), leading scholars to posit that the Tath\u0101gatagarbha Sutras were written to promote Buddhism to non- Buddhists. Quote: \"Some texts of the tathagatagarbha literature, such as the Mahaparinirvana Sutra actually refer to an atman, though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on anatta. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of atman and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous.\" This can be seen in texts like the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra, which state that Buddha- nature is taught to help those who have fear when they listen to the teaching of anatta.Suzuki, D.T. (1956), The Lankavatara Sutra. A Mahayana Text. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. p.69 Buddhist texts like the Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga clarify that the \"Self\" implied in Tathagatagarbha doctrine is actually \"not- Self\". Various interpretations of the concept have been advanced by Buddhist thinkers throughout the history of Buddhist thought and most attempt to avoid anything like the Hindu Atman doctrine. These Indian Buddhist ideas, in various synthetic ways, form the basis of subsequent Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism. ==Paths to Liberation== While the Noble Eightfold Path is best-known in the West, a wide variety of paths and models of progress have been used and described in the different Buddhist traditions. However, they generally share basic practices such as sila (ethics), samadhi (meditation, dhyana) and praj\u00f1a (wisdom), which are known as the three trainings. An important additional practice is a kind and compassionate attitude toward every living being and the world. Devotion is also important in some Buddhist traditions, and in the Tibetan traditions visualisations of deities and mandalas are important. The value of textual study is regarded differently in the various Buddhist traditions. It is central to Theravada and highly important to Tibetan Buddhism, while the Zen tradition takes an ambiguous stance. An important guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way (madhyamapratipad). It was a part of Buddha's first sermon, where he presented the Noble Eightfold Path that was a 'middle way' between the extremes of asceticism and hedonistic sense pleasures. In Buddhism, states Harvey, the doctrine of \"dependent arising\" (conditioned arising, prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da) to explain rebirth is viewed as the 'middle way' between the doctrines that a being has a \"permanent soul\" involved in rebirth (eternalism) and \"death is final and there is no rebirth\" (annihilationism). === Paths to liberation in the early texts === A common presentation style of the path (m\u0101rga) to liberation in the Early Buddhist Texts is the \"graduated talk\", in which the Buddha lays out a step by step training.Carole Anderson (2013), Pain and its Ending, p.143 In the early texts, numerous different sequences of the gradual path can be found.Bucknell, Rod, \"The Buddhist Path to Liberation: An Analysis of the Listing of Stages\", The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies Volume 7, Number 2, 1984 One of the most important and widely used presentations among the various Buddhist schools is The Noble Eightfold Path, or \"Eightfold Path of the Noble Ones\" (Skt. '\u0101ry\u0101\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45gam\u0101rga'). This can be found in various discourses, most famously in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (The discourse on the turning of the Dharma wheel). Other suttas such as the Tevijja Sutta, and the Cula-Hatthipadopama-sutta give a different outline of the path, though with many similar elements such as ethics and meditation. According to Rupert Gethin, the path to awakening is also frequently summarized by another a short formula: \"abandoning the hindrances, practice of the four establishings of mindfulness, and development of the awakening factors.\" ==== Noble Eightfold Path ==== The Eightfold Path consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions, that when developed together, lead to the cessation of dukkha. These eight factors are: Right View (or Right Understanding), Right Intention (or Right Thought), Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. This Eightfold Path is the fourth of the Four Noble Truths, and asserts the path to the cessation of dukkha (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). The path teaches that the way of the enlightened ones stopped their craving, clinging and karmic accumulations, and thus ended their endless cycles of rebirth and suffering. The Noble Eightfold Path is grouped into three basic divisions, as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Division ! Eightfold factor !Sanskrit, Pali ! Description |- style=\"background:#cff;\" | rowspan=\"2\" |Wisdom (Sanskrit: praj\u00f1\u0101, P\u0101li: pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101) |1. Right view |samyag d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di, samm\u0101 ditthi |The belief that there is an afterlife and not everything ends with death, that Buddha taught and followed a successful path to nirvana; according to Peter Harvey, the right view is held in Buddhism as a belief in the Buddhist principles of karma and rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths and the True Realities. |- style=\"background:#cff;\" |2. Right intention |samyag sa\u1e43kalpa, samm\u0101 sa\u1e45kappa |Giving up home and adopting the life of a religious mendicant in order to follow the path; this concept, states Harvey, aims at peaceful renunciation, into an environment of non-sensuality, non-ill-will (to lovingkindness), away from cruelty (to compassion). |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | rowspan=\"3\" |Moral virtues (Sanskrit: \u015b\u012bla, P\u0101li: s\u012bla) |3.

Right action |samyag karman, samm\u0101 kammanta |No killing or injuring, no taking what is not given; no sexual acts in monastic pursuit, for lay Buddhists no sensual misconduct such as sexual involvement with someone married, or with an unmarried woman protected by her parents or relatives. |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" |5. Right livelihood |samyag \u0101j\u012bvana, samm\u0101 \u0101j\u012bva |For monks, beg to feed, only possessing what is essential to sustain life. For lay Buddhists, the canonical texts state right livelihood as abstaining from wrong livelihood, explained as not becoming a source or means of suffering to sentient beings by cheating them, or harming or killing them in any way.; Quote: \"These five trades, O monks, should not be taken up by a lay follower: trading with weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, trading in poison.\" |- style=\"background:#9fff80;\" | rowspan=\"3\" |Meditation (Sanskrit and P\u0101li: sam\u0101dhi) |6.

Right mindfulness |samyag sm\u1e5bti, samm\u0101 sati |Never be absent minded, conscious of what one is doing; this, states Harvey, encourages mindfulness about impermanence of the body, feelings and mind, as well as to experience the five skandhas, the five hindrances, the four True Realities and seven factors of awakening. |- style=\"background:#9fff80;\" |8. Right concentration |samyag sam\u0101dhi, samm\u0101 sam\u0101dhi |Correct meditation or concentration (dhyana), explained as the four jh\u0101nas. |} === Theravada presentations of the path === Theravada Buddhism is a diverse tradition and thus includes different explanations of the path to awakening. However, the teachings of the Buddha are often encapsulated by Theravadins in the basic framework of the Four Noble Truths and the Eighthfold Path.Crosby, Kate (2013). \"Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity,\" p. 113-114, John Wiley & Sons.See for example, the presentation of the path in Henepola Gunaratana (2011). \"Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness: Walking the Buddha's Path\", Simon and Schuster. Some Theravada Buddhists also follow the presentation of the path laid out in Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga. This presentation is known as the \"Seven Purifications\" (satta- visuddhi).Shankman, Richard (2008). \"The Experience of Samadhi: An In-depth Exploration of Buddhist Meditation,\" p. 53. Shambhala Publications. This schema and its accompanying outline of \"insight knowledges\" (vipassan\u0101-\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a) is used by modern influential Theravadin scholars, such Mahasi Sayadaw (in his \"The Progress of Insight\") and Nyanatiloka Thera (in \"The Buddha's Path to Deliverance\").Mahasi Sayadaw (1994). \"The Progress of Insight: A Treatise on Satipatthana Meditation,\" p. vii Buddhist Publication SocietyNyanatiloka Thera (2010). \"The Buddha's Path to Deliverance: A Systematic Exposition in the Words of the Sutta Pi\u1e6daka,\" p. 42. Buddhist Publication Society. === Mahayana presentations of the path === Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a Bodhisattva. A Bodhisattva refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood. The term Mah\u0101y\u0101na was originally a synonym for Bodhisattvay\u0101na or \"Bodhisattva Vehicle.\" In the earliest texts of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, the path of a bodhisattva was to awaken the bodhicitta. Between the 1st and 3rd century CE, this tradition introduced the Ten Bhumi doctrine, which means ten levels or stages of awakening. This development was followed by the acceptance that it is impossible to achieve Buddhahood in one (current) lifetime, and the best goal is not nirvana for oneself, but Buddhahood after climbing through the ten levels during multiple rebirths. Mah\u0101y\u0101na scholars then outlined an elaborate path, for monks and laypeople, and the path includes the vow to help teach Buddhist knowledge to other beings, so as to help them cross samsara and liberate themselves, once one reaches the Buddhahood in a future rebirth. One part of this path are the p\u0101ramit\u0101 (perfections, to cross over), derived from the Jatakas tales of Buddha's numerous rebirths. The doctrine of the bodhisattva bh\u016bmis was also eventually merged with the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika schema of the \"five paths\" by the Yogacara school.Watanabe, Chikafumi (2000), A Study of Mahayanasamgraha III: The Relation of Practical Theories and Philosophical Theories.\" Ph.D. dissertation, The University of Calgary, pp. 38-40. This Mah\u0101y\u0101na \"five paths\" presentation can be seen in Asanga's Mah\u0101y\u0101nasa\u1e43graha. The Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts are inconsistent in their discussion of the p\u0101ramit\u0101s, and some texts include lists of two, others four, six, ten and fifty-two. The six paramitas have been most studied, and these are: #D\u0101na p\u0101ramit\u0101: perfection of giving; primarily to monks, nuns and the Buddhist monastic establishment dependent on the alms and gifts of the lay householders, in return for generating religious merit; some texts recommend ritually transferring the merit so accumulated for better rebirth to someone else #\u015a\u012bla p\u0101ramit\u0101: perfection of morality; it outlines ethical behaviour for both the laity and the Mahayana monastic community; this list is similar to \u015a\u012bla in the Eightfold Path (i.e. Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood) # p\u0101ramit\u0101: perfection of patience, willingness to endure hardship #V\u012brya p\u0101ramit\u0101: perfection of vigour; this is similar to Right Effort in the Eightfold Path #Dhy\u0101na p\u0101ramit\u0101: perfection of meditation; this is similar to Right Concentration in the Eightfold Path #Praj\u00f1\u0101 p\u0101ramit\u0101: perfection of insight (wisdom), awakening to the characteristics of existence such as karma, rebirths, impermanence, no-self, dependent origination and emptiness; this is complete acceptance of the Buddha teaching, then conviction, followed by ultimate realisation that \"dharmas are non-arising\". In Mah\u0101y\u0101na Sutras that include ten p\u0101ramit\u0101, the additional four perfections are \"skillful means, vow, power and knowledge\". The most discussed p\u0101ramit\u0101 and the highest rated perfection in Mahayana texts is the \"Prajna-paramita\", or the \"perfection of insight\". This insight in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na tradition, states Sh\u014dhei Ichimura, has been the \"insight of non-duality or the absence of reality in all things\". ==== East Asian Buddhism ==== East Asian Buddhism in influenced by both the classic Indian Buddhist presentations of the path such as the eighth-fold path as well as classic Indian Mah\u0101y\u0101na presentations such as that found in the Da zhidu lun.Robert E. Buswell, Robert M. Gimello (1992). \"Paths to Liberation: The Marga and Its Transformations in Buddhist Thought,\" pp. 313-314. (Studies in East Asian Buddhism). University of Hawaii Press. There many different presentations of soteriology, including numerous paths and vehicles (yanas) in the different traditions of East Asian Buddhism.Robert E. Buswell, Robert M. Gimello (1992). \"Paths to Liberation: The Marga and Its Transformations in Buddhist Thought,\" p. 316. (Studies in East Asian Buddhism). University of Hawaii Press. There is no single dominant presentation. In Zen Buddhism for example, one can find outlines of the path such as the Two Entrances and Four Practices, The Five ranks, The Ten Ox-Herding Pictures and The Three mysterious Gates of Linji. ==== Indo-Tibetan Buddhism ==== In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, the path to liberation is outlined in the genre known as Lamrim (\"Stages of the Path\"). All the various Tibetan schools have their own Lamrim presentations. This genre can be traced to Ati\u015ba's 11th-century A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment (Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa).Lamrim: the Gradual Path to Enlightenment ==Common Buddhist practices== === Hearing and learning the Dharma === Sermon in the Deer Park depicted at Wat Chedi Liem-Kay In various suttas which present the graduated path taught by the Buddha, such as the Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta and the Cula-Hatthipadopama Sutta, the first step on the path is hearing the Buddha teach the Dharma. This then said to lead to the acquiring of confidence or faith in the Buddha's teachings. Mahayana Buddhist teachers such as Yin Shun also state that hearing the Dharma and study of the Buddhist discourses is necessary \"if one wants to learn and practice the Buddha Dharma.\"Yin-shun (2012). \"The Way to Buddhahood: Instructions from a Modern Chinese Master,\" p. 29. Simon and Schuster. Likewise, in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, the \"Stages of the Path\" (Lamrim) texts generally place the activity of listening to the Buddhist teachings as an important early practice.See for example, Tsong-Kha-Pa (2015) \"The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment\", chapter three. Shambala Pubs. ===Refuge=== Traditionally, the first step in most Buddhist schools requires taking of the \"Three Refuges\", also called the Three Jewels (Sanskrit: triratna, Pali: tiratana) as the foundation of one's religious practice. This practice may have been influenced by the Brahmanical motif of the triple refuge, found in the Rigveda 9.97.47, Rigveda 6.46.9 and Chandogya Upanishad 2.22.3\u20134. Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the lama. The three refuges are believed by Buddhists to be protective and a form of reverence. The ancient formula which is repeated for taking refuge affirms that \"I go to the Buddha as refuge, I go to the Dhamma as refuge, I go to the Sangha as refuge.\" Reciting the three refuges, according to Harvey, is considered not as a place to hide, rather a thought that \"purifies, uplifts and strengthens the heart\". ===\u015a\u012bla \u2013 Buddhist ethics=== Buddhist monks collect alms in Si Phan Don, Laos. Giving is a key virtue in Buddhism. \u015a\u012bla (Sanskrit) or s\u012bla (P\u0101li) is the concept of \"moral virtues\", that is the second group and an integral part of the Noble Eightfold Path. It generally consists of right speech, right action and right livelihood. One of the most basic forms of ethics in Buddhism is the taking of \"precepts\". This includes the Five Precepts for laypeople, Eight or Ten Precepts for monastic life, as well as rules of Dhamma (Vinaya or Patimokkha) adopted by a monastery. Other important elements of Buddhist ethics include giving or charity (d\u0101na), Mett\u0101 (Good-Will), Heedfulness (Appamada), \u2018self-respect\u2019 (Hri) and 'regard for consequences' (Apatrapya). ==== Precepts ==== Buddhist scriptures explain the five precepts (; ) as the minimal standard of Buddhist morality. It is the most important system of morality in Buddhism, together with the monastic rules. The five precepts are seen as a basic training applicable to all Buddhists. They are: # \"I undertake the training-precept (sikkha-padam) to abstain from onslaught on breathing beings.\" This includes ordering or causing someone else to kill. The Pali suttas also say one should not \"approve of others killing\" and that one should be \"scrupulous, compassionate, trembling for the welfare of all living beings.\" # \"I undertake the training-precept to abstain from taking what is not given.\" According to Harvey, this also covers fraud, cheating, forgery as well as \"falsely denying that one is in debt to someone.\" # \"I undertake the training-precept to abstain from misconduct concerning sense-pleasures.\" This generally refers to adultery, as well as rape and incest. It also applies to sex with those who are legally under the protection of a guardian. It is also interpreted in different ways in the varying Buddhist cultures. # \"I undertake the training-precept to abstain from false speech.\" According to Harvey this includes \"any form of lying, deception or exaggeration...even non-verbal deception by gesture or other indication...or misleading statements.\" The precept is often also seen as including other forms of wrong speech such as \"divisive speech, harsh, abusive, angry words, and even idle chatter.\" # \"I undertake the training- precept to abstain from alcoholic drink or drugs that are an opportunity for heedlessness.\" According to Harvey, intoxication is seen as a way to mask rather than face the sufferings of life. It is seen as damaging to one's mental clarity, mindfulness and ability to keep the other four precepts. Undertaking and upholding the five precepts is based on the principle of non- harming (P\u0101li and ). The Pali Canon recommends one to compare oneself with others, and on the basis of that, not to hurt others. Compassion and a belief in karmic retribution form the foundation of the precepts. Undertaking the five precepts is part of regular lay devotional practice, both at home and at the local temple. However, the extent to which people keep them differs per region and time. They are sometimes referred to as the \u015br\u0101vakay\u0101na precepts in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na tradition, contrasting them with the bodhisattva precepts. The five precepts are not commandments and transgressions do not invite religious sanctions, but their power has been based on the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in the afterlife. Killing in Buddhist belief leads to rebirth in the hell realms, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk. Adultery, similarly, invites a rebirth as prostitute or in hell, depending on whether the partner was unmarried or married. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth. Within the Buddhist doctrine, the precepts are meant to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to enlightenment. The monastic life in Buddhism has additional precepts as part of patimokkha, and unlike lay people, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions. Full expulsion from sangha follows any instance of killing, engaging in sexual intercourse, theft or false claims about one's knowledge. Temporary expulsion follows a lesser offence. The sanctions vary per monastic fraternity (nikaya). Lay people and novices in many Buddhist fraternities also uphold eight (asta shila) or ten (das shila) from time to time. Four of these are same as for the lay devotee: no killing, no stealing, no lying, and no intoxicants. The other four precepts are: # No sexual activity; # Abstain from eating at the wrong time (e.g. only eat solid food before noon); # Abstain from jewellery, perfume, adornment, entertainment; # Abstain from sleeping on high bed i.e. to sleep on a mat on the ground. All eight precepts are sometimes observed by lay people on uposatha days: full moon, new moon, the first and last quarter following the lunar calendar. The ten precepts also include to abstain from accepting money. In addition to these precepts, Buddhist monasteries have hundreds of rules of conduct, which are a part of its patimokkha. The Ten Precepts, Dasa Sila, The Buddhist Monastic Code, Volume I, Thanissaro Bhikkhu ====Vinaya==== An ordination ceremony at Wat Yannawa in Bangkok. The Vinaya codes regulate the various sangha acts, including ordination. Vinaya is the specific code of conduct for a sangha of monks or nuns. It includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 offences including 75 rules of decorum for monks, along with penalties for transgression, in the Theravadin tradition. The precise content of the Vinaya Pitaka (scriptures on the Vinaya) differs in different schools and tradition, and different monasteries set their own standards on its implementation. The list of pattimokkha is recited every fortnight in a ritual gathering of all monks. Buddhist text with vinaya rules for monasteries have been traced in all Buddhist traditions, with the oldest surviving being the ancient Chinese translations. Monastic communities in the Buddhist tradition cut normal social ties to family and community, and live as \"islands unto themselves\". Within a monastic fraternity, a sangha has its own rules. A monk abides by these institutionalised rules, and living life as the vinaya prescribes it is not merely a means, but very nearly the end in itself. Transgressions by a monk on Sangha vinaya rules invites enforcement, which can include temporary or permanent expulsion. ===Restraint and renunciation=== Living at the root of a tree (trukkhamulik'anga) is one of the dhuta\u1e45gas, a series of optional ascetic practices for Buddhist monastics. Another important practice taught by the Buddha is the restraint of the senses (indriyasamvara). In the various graduated paths, this is usually presented as a practice which is taught prior to formal sitting meditation, and which supports meditation by weakening sense desires that are a hindrance to meditation.An\u0101layo (2003). \"Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na: The Direct Path to Realization,\" p. 71. Windhorse Publications. According to An\u0101layo, sense restraint is when one \"guards the sense doors in order to prevent sense impressions from leading to desires and discontent.\" This is not an avoidance of sense impression, but a kind of mindful attention towards the sense impressions which does not dwell on their main features or signs (nimitta). This is said to prevent harmful influences from entering the mind.An\u0101layo (2003). \"Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na: The Direct Path to Realization,\" p. 225. Windhorse Publications. This practice is said to give rise to an inner peace and happiness which forms a basis for concentration and insight. A related Buddhist virtue and practice is renunciation, or the intent for desirelessness (nekkhamma).Webster, David (2004). \"The Philosophy of Desire in the Buddhist Pali Canon,\" p. 124. Routledge. Generally, renunciation is the giving up of actions and desires that are seen as unwholesome on the path, such as lust for sensuality and worldly things. Renunciation can be cultivated in different ways. The practice of giving for example, is one form of cultivating renunciation. Another one is the giving up of lay life and becoming a monastic (bhiksu o bhiksuni). Practicing celibacy (whether for life as a monk, or temporarily) is also a form of renunciation. Many Jataka stories such as the focus on how the Buddha practiced renunciation in past lives. One way of cultivating renunciation taught by the Buddha is the contemplation (anupassana) of the \"dangers\" (or \"negative consequences\") of sensual pleasure (k\u0101m\u0101na\u1e43 \u0101d\u012bnava). As part of the graduated discourse, this contemplation is taught after the practice of giving and morality.Robert E. Buswell Jr., Donald S. Lopez Jr. (2013) \"The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism,\" p. 18. Princeton University Press. Another related practice to renunciation and sense restraint taught by the Buddha is \"restraint in eating\" or moderation with food, which for monks generally means not eating after noon. Devout laypersons also follow this rule during special days of religious observance (uposatha).Johnston, William M. (ed.) Encyclopedia of Monasticism, Routledge, 2013, p. 467-468. Observing the Uposatha also includes other practices dealing with renunciation, mainly the eight precepts. For Buddhist monastics, renunciation can also be trained through several optional ascetic practices called dhuta\u1e45ga. In different Buddhist traditions, other related practices which focus on fasting are followed. ===Mindfulness and clear comprehension=== The training of the faculty called \"mindfulness\" (Pali: sati, Sanskrit: sm\u1e5bti, literally meaning \"recollection, remembering\") is central in Buddhism. According to Analayo, mindfulness is a full awareness of the present moment which enhances and strengthens memory.Analayo (2018) \"Satipatthana Meditation, A Practice Guide,\" chapter 1. Windhorse Publications. The Indian Buddhist philosopher Asanga defined mindfulness thus: \"It is non-forgetting by the mind with regard to the object experienced. Its function is non-distraction.\"Boin- Webb, Sara. (English trans. from Walpola R\u0101hula\u2019s French trans. of the Sanskrit; 2001) \"Abhidharmasamuccaya: The Compendium of the Higher Teaching (Philosophy) by Asa\u1e45ga\", p. 9, Asian Humanities Press. According to Rupert Gethin, sati is also \"an awareness of things in relation to things, and hence an awareness of their relative value.\"Sharf, Robert (2014), \"Mindfulness and Mindlessness in Early Chan\" (PDF), Philosophy East and West, 64 (4): 933\u2013964, doi:10.1353/pew.2014.0074 There are different practices and exercises for training mindfulness in the early discourses, such as the four Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101nas (Sanskrit: sm\u1e5btyupasth\u0101na, \"establishments of mindfulness\") and \u0100n\u0101p\u0101nasati (Sanskrit: \u0101n\u0101p\u0101nasm\u1e5bti, \"mindfulness of breathing\"). A closely related mental faculty, which is often mentioned side by side with mindfulness, is sampaja\u00f1\u00f1a (\"clear comprehension\"). This faculty is the ability to comprehend what one is doing and is happening in the mind, and whether it is being influenced by unwholesome states or wholesome ones. === Meditation \u2013 Sam\u0101dhi and Dhy\u0101na === K\u014dd\u014d Sawaki practicing Zazen (\"sitting dhyana\") A wide range of meditation practices has developed in the Buddhist traditions, but \"meditation\" primarily refers to the attainment of sam\u0101dhi and the practice of dhy\u0101na (Pali: jh\u0101na). Sam\u0101dhi is a calm, undistracted, unified and concentrated state of consciousness. It is defined by Asanga as \"one-pointedness of mind on the object to be investigated. Its function consists of giving a basis to knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na).\" Dhy\u0101na is \"state of perfect equanimity and awareness (upekkh\u0101-sati-parisuddhi),\" reached through focused mental training.Vetter, Tilmann (1988), \"The Ideas and Meditative Practices of Early Buddhism,\" p. 5. BRILL. The practice of dhy\u0101na aids in maintaining a calm mind, and avoiding disturbance of this calm mind by mindfulness of disturbing thoughts and feelings. ====Origins==== The earliest evidence of yogis and their meditative tradition, states Karel Werner, is found in the Ke\u015bin hymn 10.136 of the Rigveda. While evidence suggests meditation was practised in the centuries preceding the Buddha, the meditative methodologies described in the Buddhist texts are some of the earliest among texts that have survived into the modern era. These methodologies likely incorporate what existed before the Buddha as well as those first developed within Buddhism. There is no scholarly agreement on the origin and source of the practice of dhy\u0101na. Some scholars, like Bronkhorst, see the four dhy\u0101nas as a Buddhist invention. Alexander Wynne argues that the Buddha learned dhy\u0101na from brahmanical teachers. Whatever the case, the Buddha taught meditation with a new focus and interpretation, particularly through the four dhy\u0101nas methodology, in which mindfulness is maintained. Further, the focus of meditation and the underlying theory of liberation guiding the meditation has been different in Buddhism. For example, states Bronkhorst, the verse 4.4.23 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad with its \"become calm, subdued, quiet, patiently enduring, concentrated, one sees soul in oneself\" is most probably a meditative state. The Buddhist discussion of meditation is without the concept of soul and the discussion criticises both the ascetic meditation of Jainism and the \"real self, soul\" meditation of Hinduism. ====Four rupa-jh\u0101na ==== Seated Buddha, Gal Viharaya, Polonnawura, Sri Lanka. Buddhist texts teach various meditation schemas. One of the most prominent is that of the four rupa-jh\u0101nas (four meditations in the realm of form), which are \"stages of progressively deepening concentration\".Bucknell, Robert S. (1993), \"Reinterpreting the Jhanas\", Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, 16 (2) According to Gethin, they are states of \"perfect mindfulness, stillness and lucidity.\"Gethin, Rupert (2004), \"On the Practice of Buddhist Meditation According to the Pali Nikayas and Exegetical Sources\", Buddhismus in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 9: 201\u201321. They are described in the Pali Canon as trance-like states without desire. In the early texts, the Buddha is depicted as entering jh\u0101na both before his awakening under the bodhi tree and also before his final nirvana (see: the Mah\u0101saccaka-sutta and the Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101\u1e47a Sutta).Analayo (2011). \"A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nik\u0101ya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),\" p. 243.\u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli Bhikkhu (1992), \"The Life of the Buddha: According to the Pali Canon\" p. 324. Buddhist Publication Society. The four rupa-jh\u0101nas are: # First jh\u0101na: the first dhyana can be entered when one is secluded from sensuality and unskillful qualities, due to withdrawal and right effort. There is p\u012bti (\"rapture\") and non-sensual sukha (\"pleasure\") as the result of seclusion, while vitarka-vicara (thought and examination) continues. # Second jh\u0101na: there is p\u012bti (\"rapture\") and non-sensual sukha (\"pleasure\") as the result of concentration (samadhi-ji, \"born of samadhi\"); ekaggata (unification of awareness) free from vitarka-vicara (\"discursive thought\"); sampasadana (\"inner tranquility\"). # Third jh\u0101na: p\u012bti drops away, there is upekkh\u0101 (equanimous; \"affective detachment\"), and one is mindful, alert, and senses pleasure (sukha) with the body; # Fourth jh\u0101na: a stage of \"pure equanimity and mindfulness\" (upekkh\u0101satip\u0101risuddhi), without any pleasure or pain, happiness or sadness. There is a wide variety of scholarly opinions (both from modern scholars and from traditional Buddhists) on the interpretation of these meditative states as well as varying opinions on how to practice them.see for example: Shankman, Richard (2008), \"The Experience of Samadhi,\" for an overview of the debate within Theravada Buddhism. ==== The formless attaiments ==== Often grouped into the jh\u0101na-scheme are four other meditative states, referred to in the early texts as arupa sam\u0101pattis (formless attainments). These are also referred to in commentarial literature as immaterial/formless jh\u0101nas (ar\u016bpajh\u0101nas). The first formless attainment is a place or realm of infinite space (\u0101k\u0101s\u0101na\u00f1c\u0101yatana) without form or colour or shape. The second is termed the realm of infinite consciousness (vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u00f1c\u0101yatana); the third is the realm of nothingness (\u0101ki\u00f1ca\u00f1\u00f1\u0101yatana), while the fourth is the realm of \"neither perception nor non-perception\". The four rupa-jh\u0101nas in Buddhist practice lead to rebirth in successfully better rupa Brahma heavenly realms, while arupa-jh\u0101nas lead into arupa heavens. ====Meditation and insight==== Kamakura Daibutsu, K\u014dtoku-in, Kamakura, Japan. In the Pali canon, the Buddha outlines two meditative qualities which are mutually supportive: samatha (P\u0101li; Sanskrit: \u015bamatha; \"calm\") and vipassan\u0101 (Sanskrit: vipa\u015byan\u0101, insight). The Buddha compares these mental qualities to a \"swift pair of messengers\" who together help deliver the message of nibbana (SN 35.245). The various Buddhist traditions generally see Buddhist meditation as being divided into those two main types. Samatha is also called \"calming meditation\", and focuses on stilling and concentrating the mind i.e. developing samadhi and the four dhy\u0101nas. According to Damien Keown, vipassan\u0101 meanwhile, focuses on \"the generation of penetrating and critical insight (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101)\". There are numerous doctrinal positions and disagreements within the different Buddhist traditions regarding these qualities or forms of meditation. For example, in the Pali Four Ways to Arahantship Sutta (AN 4.170), it is said that one can develop calm and then insight, or insight and then calm, or both at the same time. Meanwhile, in Vasubandhu's Abhidharmako\u015bak\u0101rik\u0101, vipa\u015byan\u0101 is said to be practiced once one has reached samadhi by cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness (sm\u1e5btyupasth\u0101nas).De La Vallee Poussin (trans.); Pruden, Leo M. (trans.) Abhidharmakosabhasyam of Vasubandhu. Vol. III, page 925. Beginning with comments by La Vallee Poussin, a series of scholars have argued that these two meditation types reflect a tension between two different ancient Buddhist traditions regarding the use of dhy\u0101na, one which focused on insight based practice and the other which focused purely on dhy\u0101na.An\u0101layo. \"A Brief Criticism of the \u2018Two Paths to Liberation\u2019 Theory\" JOCBS. 2016 (11): 38-51. However, other scholars such as Analayo and Rupert Gethin have disagreed with this \"two paths\" thesis, instead seeing both of these practices as complementary. ====The Brahma-vihara==== Statue of Buddha in Wat Phra Si Rattana Mahathat, Phitsanulok, Thailand The four immeasurables or four abodes, also called Brahma-viharas, are virtues or directions for meditation in Buddhist traditions, which helps a person be reborn in the heavenly (Brahma) realm. These are traditionally believed to be a characteristic of the deity Brahma and the heavenly abode he resides in. The four Brahma-vihara are: # Loving-kindness (P\u0101li: mett\u0101, Sanskrit: maitr\u012b) is active good will towards all; # Compassion (P\u0101li and Sanskrit: karu\u1e47\u0101) results from metta; it is identifying the suffering of others as one's own; # Empathetic joy (P\u0101li and Sanskrit: mudit\u0101): is the feeling of joy because others are happy, even if one did not contribute to it; it is a form of sympathetic joy; # Equanimity (P\u0101li: upekkh\u0101, Sanskrit: upek\u1e63\u0101): is even-mindedness and serenity, treating everyone impartially. According to Peter Harvey, the Buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the four Brahmavihara meditation practices \"did not originate within the Buddhist tradition\". The Brahmavihara (sometimes as Brahmaloka), along with the tradition of meditation and the above four immeasurables are found in pre- Buddha and post-Buddha Vedic and Sramanic literature. Aspects of the Brahmavihara practice for rebirths into the heavenly realm have been an important part of Buddhist meditation tradition. According to Gombrich, the Buddhist usage of the brahma-vih\u0101ra originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to \"living with Brahman\" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as \"living with Brahman\" by rebirth in the Brahma-world. According to Gombrich, \"the Buddha taught that kindness \u2013 what Christians tend to call love \u2013 was a way to salvation.\" ==== Tantra, visualization and the subtle body ==== An 18th century Mongolian miniature which depicts the generation of the Vairocana Mandala A section of the Northern wall mural at the Lukhang Temple depicting tummo, the three channels (nadis) and phowa Some Buddhist traditions, especially those associated with Tantric Buddhism (also known as Vajrayana and Secret Mantra) use images and symbols of deities and Buddhas in meditation. This is generally done by mentally visualizing a Buddha image (or some other mental image, like a symbol, a mandala, a syllable, etc.), and using that image to cultivate calm and insight. One may also visualize and identify oneself with the imagined deity. While visualization practices have been particularly popular in Vajrayana, they may also found in Mahayana and Theravada traditions. In Tibetan Buddhism, unique tantric techniques which include visualization (but also mantra recitation, mandalas, and other elements) are considered to be much more effective than non-tantric meditations and they are one of the most popular meditation methods. The methods of Unsurpassable Yoga Tantra, (anuttarayogatantra) are in turn seen as the highest and most advanced. Anuttarayoga practice is divided into two stages, the Generation Stage and the Completion Stage. In the Generation Stage, one meditates on emptiness and visualizes oneself as a deity as well as visualizing its mandala. The focus is on developing clear appearance and divine pride (the understanding that oneself and the deity are one).Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt (2004). Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, p. 52 This method is also known as deity yoga (devata yoga). There are numerous meditation deities (yidam) used, each with a mandala, a circular symbolic map used in meditation. In the Completion Stage, one meditates on ultimate reality based on the image that has been generated. Completion Stage practices also include techniques such as tummo and phowa. These are said to work with subtle body elements, like the energy channels (nadi), vital essences (bindu), \"vital winds\" (vayu), and chakras.Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt (2004). Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, p. 45 The subtle body energies are seen as influencing consciousness in powerful ways, and are thus used in order to generate the 'great bliss' (maha-sukha) which is used to attain the luminous nature of the mind and realization of the empty and illusory nature of all phenomena (\"the illusory body\"), which leads to enlightenment.Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). A Dictionary of Buddhism. Great Britain, Oxford: Oxford University Press. P.63. Jamg\u00f6n Kongtr\u00fcl Lodr\u00f6 Thay\u00e9; Guarisco, Elio and McLeod, Ingrid (trans.) (2008) The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Eight, Part Three: The Elements of Tantric Practice, p. 201. Shambhala Publications. Completion practices are often grouped into different systems, such as the six dharmas of Naropa, and the six yogas of Kalachakra. In Tibetan Buddhism, there are also practices and methods which are sometimes seen as being outside of the two tantric stages, mainly Mahamudra and Dzogchen (Atiyoga). ====Practice: monks, laity==== According to Peter Harvey, whenever Buddhism has been healthy, not only ordained but also more committed lay people have practised formal meditation. Loud devotional chanting however, adds Harvey, has been the most prevalent Buddhist practice and considered a form of meditation that produces \"energy, joy, lovingkindness and calm\", purifies mind and benefits the chanter. Throughout most of Buddhist history, meditation has been primarily practised in Buddhist monastic tradition, and historical evidence suggests that serious meditation by lay people has been an exception. In recent history, sustained meditation has been pursued by a minority of monks in Buddhist monasteries. Western interest in meditation has led to a revival where ancient Buddhist ideas and precepts are adapted to Western mores and interpreted liberally, presenting Buddhism as a meditation-based form of spirituality. ===Insight and knowledge=== Monks debating at Sera Monastery, Tibet Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Sanskrit) or pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 (P\u0101li) is wisdom, or knowledge of the true nature of existence. Another term which is associated with praj\u00f1\u0101 and sometimes is equivalent to it is vipassan\u0101 (P\u0101li) or vipa\u015byan\u0101 (Sanskrit), which is often translated as \"insight\". In Buddhist texts, the faculty of insight is often said to be cultivated through the four establishments of mindfulness. In the early texts, Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 is included as one of the \"five faculties\" (indriya) which are commonly listed as important spiritual elements to be cultivated (see for example: AN I 16). Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 along with samadhi, is also listed as one of the \"trainings in the higher states of mind\" (adhicittasikkha). The Buddhist tradition regards ignorance (avidy\u0101), a fundamental ignorance, misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality, as one of the basic causes of dukkha and samsara. Overcoming this ignorance is part of the path to awakening. This overcoming includes the contemplation of impermanence and the non-self nature of reality, and this develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and liberates a being from dukkha and sa\u1e43s\u0101ra., Quote: \"Suffering describes the condition of samsaric (this worldly) existence that arises from actions generated by ignorance of anatta and anicca. The doctrines of no-self and impermanence are thus the keystones of dhammic order.\" Praj\u00f1\u0101 is important in all Buddhist traditions. It is variously described as wisdom regarding the impermanent and not-self nature of dharmas (phenomena), the functioning of karma and rebirth, and knowledge of dependent origination. Likewise, vipa\u015byan\u0101 is described in a similar way, such as in the Pa\u1e6disambhid\u0101magga, where it is said to be the contemplation of things as impermanent, unsatisfactory and not-self. Some scholars such as Bronkhorst and Vetter have argued that the idea that insight leads to liberation was a later development in Buddhism and that there are inconsistencies with the early Buddhist presentation of samadhi and insight. However, others such as Collett Cox and Damien Keown have argued that insight is a key aspect of the early Buddhist process of liberation, which cooperates with samadhi to remove the obstacles to enlightenment (i.e., the \u0101savas).Keown, Damien (1992/2001) \"The Nature of Buddhist Ethics,\" p. 79-82, New York: Palgrave.Cox, Collett (1992/1994) \u201cAttainment through Abandonment: The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Path of Removing Defilements\u201d, in Paths to Liberation, The M\u0101rga and Its Transformations in Buddhist Thought, R.E. Buswell jr. and R.M. Gimello (ed.), 63\u2013105, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. In Therav\u0101da Buddhism, the focus of vipassan\u0101 meditation is to continuously and thoroughly know how phenomena (dhammas) are impermanent (annica), not-Self (anatta) and dukkha. The most widely used method in modern Therav\u0101da for the practice of vipassan\u0101 is that found in the Satipatthana Sutta. There is some disagreement in contemporary Therav\u0101da regarding samatha and vipassan\u0101. Some in the Vipassana Movement strongly emphasize the practice of insight over samatha, and other Theravadins disagree with this. In Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, the development of insight (vipa\u015byan\u0101) and tranquility (\u015bamatha) are also taught and practiced. The many different schools of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism have a large repertoire of meditation techniques to cultivate these qualities. These include visualization of various Buddhas, recitation of a Buddha's name, the use of tantric Buddhist mantras and dharanis.Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, p. 40. Insight in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism also includes gaining a direct understanding of certain Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophical views, such as the emptiness view and the consciousness-only view. This can be seen in meditation texts such as Kamala\u015b\u012bla's Bh\u0101van\u0101krama ( \"Stages of Meditation\", 9th century), which teaches insight (vipa\u015byan\u0101) from the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Madhyamaka perspective.Adam, Martin T. Meditation and the Concept of Insight in Kamalashila's Bhavanakramas, 2002. ===Devotion=== Indo-Tibetan Buddhist prostration practice at Jokhang, Tibet. According to Harvey, most forms of Buddhism \"consider saddh\u0101 (Skt \u015braddh\u0101), \u2018trustful confidence\u2019 or \u2018faith\u2019, as a quality which must be balanced by wisdom, and as a preparation for, or accompaniment of, meditation.\" Because of this devotion (Skt. bhakti; Pali: bhatti) is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists. Devotional practices include ritual prayer, prostration, offerings, pilgrimage, and chanting. Buddhist devotion is usually focused on some object, image or location that is seen as holy or spiritually influential. Examples of objects of devotion include paintings or statues of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, stupas, and bodhi trees. Public group chanting for devotional and ceremonial is common to all Buddhist traditions and goes back to ancient India where chanting aided in the memorization of the orally transmitted teachings. Rosaries called malas are used in all Buddhist traditions to count repeated chanting of common formulas or mantras. Chanting is thus a type of devotional group meditation which leads to tranquility and communicates the Buddhist teachings. In East Asian Pure Land Buddhism, devotion to the Buddha Amitabha is the main practice. In Nichiren Buddhism, devotion to the Lotus Sutra is the main practice. Devotional practices such as pujas have been a common practice in Theravada Buddhism, where offerings and group prayers are made to deities and particularly images of Buddha.Donald Swearer (2003), Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition (Editors: Heine and Prebish), Oxford University Press, , pp. 9\u201325 According to Karel Werner and other scholars, devotional worship has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and deep devotion is part of Buddhist traditions starting from the earliest days.Karel Werner (1995). Love Divine: Studies in Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism, Routledge, , pp. 45\u201346 Guru devotion is a central practice of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. The guru is considered essential and to the Buddhist devotee, the guru is the \"enlightened teacher and ritual master\" in Vajrayana spiritual pursuits. For someone seeking Buddhahood, the guru is the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, wrote the 12th-century Buddhist scholar Sadhanamala. The veneration of and obedience to teachers is also important in Theravada and Zen Buddhism. ===Vegetarianism and animal ethics=== Vegetarian meal at Buddhist temple. East Asian Buddhism tends to promote vegetarianism. Based on the Indian principle of ahimsa (non-harming), the Buddha's ethics strongly condemn the harming of all sentient beings, including all animals. He thus condemned the animal sacrifice of the brahmins as well hunting, and killing animals for food. This led to various policies by Buddhist kings such as Asoka meant to protect animals, such as the establishing of 'no slaughter days' and the banning of hunting on certain circumstances. However, early Buddhist texts depict the Buddha as allowing monastics to eat meat. This seems to be because monastics begged for their food and thus were supposed to accept whatever food was offered to them. This was tempered by the rule that meat had to be \"three times clean\" which meant that \"they had not seen, had not heard, and had no reason to suspect that the animal had been killed so that the meat could be given to them\".Phelps, Norm (2004). The Great Compassion: Buddhism & Animal Rights. New York: Lantern Books. p. 76. . Also, while the Buddha did not explicitly promote vegetarianism in his discourses, he did state that gaining one's livelihood from the meat trade was unethical.Vanijja Sutta: Business (Wrong Livelihood) However, this rule was not a promotion of a specific diet, but a rule against the actual killing of animals for food.\"Buddhism and Vegetarianism, The Rationale for the Buddha's Views on the Consumption of Meat\" by Dr V. A. Gunasekara\" 'The rule of vegetarianism was the fifth of a list of rules which Devadatta had proposed to the Buddha. Devadatta was the founder of the tapasa movement in Buddhism and his special rules involved ascetic and austere practices (forest-dwelling, wearing only rags, etc). The Buddha rejected all the proposed revisions of Devadatta, and it was in this context that he reiterated the tikoiparisuddha rule. (On this see the author's Western Buddhism and a Theravada heterodoxy, BSQ Tracts on Buddhism' There was also a famed schism which occurred in the Buddhist community when Devadatta attempted to make vegetarianism compulsory and the Buddha disagreed. In contrast to this, various Mahayana sutras and texts like the Mahaparinirvana sutra, Surangama sutra and the Lankavatara sutra state that the Buddha promoted vegetarianism out of compassion.Phelps, Norm (2004). The Great Compassion: Buddhism & Animal Rights. New York: Lantern Books. pp. 64-65. . Indian Mahayana thinkers like Shantideva promoted the avoidance of meat. Throughout history, the issue of whether Buddhists should be vegetarian has remained a much debated topic and there is a variety of opinions on this issue among modern Buddhists. In the East Asian Buddhism, most monastics are expected to be vegetarian, and the practice is seen as very virtuous and it is taken up by some devout laypersons. Most Theravadins in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia do not practice vegetarianism and eat whatever is offered by the lay community, who are mostly also not vegetarians. But there are exceptions, some monks choose to be vegetarian and some abbots like Ajahn Sumedho have encouraged the lay community to donate vegetarian food to the monks. Mahasi Sayadaw meanwhile, has recommended vegetarianism as the best way to make sure one's meal is pure in three ways. Also, the new religious movement Santi Asoke, promotes vegetarianism. According to Peter Harvey, in the Theravada world, vegetarianism is \"universally admired, but little practiced.\" Because of the rule against killing, in many Buddhist countries, most butchers and others who work in the meat trade are non-Buddhists. Likewise, most Tibetan Buddhists have historically tended not to be vegetarian, however, there have been some strong debates and pro-vegetarian arguments by some pro-vegetarian Tibetans.For an over view of this history, see: Barstow, Geoffrey (2018) Food of Sinful Demons: Meat, Vegetarianism, and the Limits of Buddhism in Tibet. Columbia University Press. Some influential figures have spoken and written in favor of vegetarianism throughout history, including well known figures like Shabkar and the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje, who has mandated vegetarianism in all his monasteries.Talk on Vegetarianism, by Orgyen Trinle Dorje, Karmapa XVII, As Translated Simultaneously by Ringu Tulku Rinpoche 3 January 2007, Full Moon Day, During the 24th annual Great Kagyu Monlam, Bodhgaya, India ==Buddhist texts== A depiction of the supposed First Buddhist council at Rajgir. Communal recitation was one of the original ways of transmitting and preserving Early Buddhist texts. Buddhism, like all Indian religions, was initially an oral tradition in ancient times. The Buddha's words, the early doctrines, concepts, and their traditional interpretations were orally transmitted from one generation to the next. The earliest oral texts were transmitted in Middle Indo-Aryan languages called Prakrits, such as Pali, through the use of communal recitation and other mnemonic techniques. The first Buddhist canonical texts were likely written down in Sri Lanka, about 400 years after the Buddha died. The texts were part of the Tripitakas, and many versions appeared thereafter claiming to be the words of the Buddha. Scholarly Buddhist commentary texts, with named authors, appeared in India, around the 2nd century CE. These texts were written in Pali or Sanskrit, sometimes regional languages, as palm-leaf manuscripts, birch bark, painted scrolls, carved into temple walls, and later on paper. Unlike what the Bible is to Christianity and the Quran is to Islam, but like all major ancient Indian religions, there is no consensus among the different Buddhist traditions as to what constitutes the scriptures or a common canon in Buddhism. The general belief among Buddhists is that the canonical corpus is vast. This corpus includes the ancient Sutras organised into Nikayas or Agamas, itself the part of three basket of texts called the Tripitakas. Each Buddhist tradition has its own collection of texts, much of which is translation of ancient Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist texts of India. The Chinese Buddhist canon, for example, includes 2184 texts in 55 volumes, while the Tibetan canon comprises 1108 textsall claimed to have been spoken by the Buddhaand another 3461 texts composed by Indian scholars revered in the Tibetan tradition. The Buddhist textual history is vast; over 40,000 manuscriptsmostly Buddhist, some non-Buddhistwere discovered in 1900 in the Dunhuang Chinese cave alone. === Early Buddhist texts === Gandhara birchbark scroll fragments (c. 1st century) from British Library Collection The Early Buddhist Texts refers to the literature which is considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist material. The first four Pali Nikayas, and the corresponding Chinese \u0100gamas are generally considered to be among the earliest material.Mun-Keat Choong (1999). The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism, Motilal Banarsidass, p. 3. . Apart from these, there are also fragmentary collections of EBT materials in other languages such as Sanskrit, Khotanese, Tibetan and G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b. The modern study of early Buddhism often relies on comparative scholarship using these various early Buddhist sources to identify parallel texts and common doctrinal content.e.g. \"Mun-keat, Choong (2000), The Fundamental Teachings of Early Buddhism\" and \"Analayo. Early Buddhist Meditation Studies (Volume 1)\" One feature of these early texts are literary structures which reflect oral transmission, such as widespread repetition. === The Tripitakas === After the development of the different early Buddhist schools, these schools began to develop their own textual collections, which were termed Tripi\u1e6dakas (Triple Baskets). Many early Tripi\u1e6dakas, like the P\u0101li Tipitaka, were divided into three sections: Vinaya Pitaka (focuses on monastic rule), Sutta Pitaka (Buddhist discourses) and Abhidhamma Pitaka, which contain expositions and commentaries on the doctrine. The P\u0101li Tipitaka (also known as the Pali Canon) of the Theravada School constitutes the only complete collection of Buddhist texts in an Indic language which has survived until today.Crosby, Kate (2013). Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 2. However, many Sutras, Vinayas and Abhidharma works from other schools survive in Chinese translation, as part of the Chinese Buddhist Canon. According to some sources, some early schools of Buddhism had five or seven pitakas. Much of the material in the Pali Canon is not specifically \"Theravadin\", but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey, it contains material at odds with later Theravadin orthodoxy. He states: \"The Theravadins, then, may have added texts to the Canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period.\" === Abhidharma and the commentaries === A distinctive feature of many Tripitaka collections is the inclusion of a genre called Abhidharma, which dates from the 3rd century BCE and later. According to Collett Cox, the genre began as explanations and elaborations of the teachings in the suttas but over time evolved into an independent system of doctrinal exposition.Cox, Collett (2003). \"Abidharma\", in: Buswell, Robert E. ed. Encyclopedia of Buddhism, New York: Macmillan Reference Lib. pp. 1\u20137. . Over time, the various Abhidharma traditions developed various disagreements which each other on points of doctrine, which were discussed in the different Abhidharma texts of these schools. The major Abhidharma collections which modern scholars have the most information about are those of the Therav\u0101da and Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da schools. In Sri Lanka and South India, the Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma system was the most influential. In addition to the Abhidharma project, some of the schools also began accumulating a literary tradition of scriptural commentary on their respective Tripitakas. These commentaries were particularly important in the Therav\u0101da school, and the Pali commentaries (A\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101) remain influential today. Both Abhidhamma and the Pali commentaries influenced the Visuddhimagga, an important 5th-century text by the Theravada scholar Buddhaghosa, who also translated and compiled many of the A\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101s from older Sinhalese sources.Visuddhimagga, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2015) The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school was one of the most influential Abhidharma traditions in North India.Wataru S. Ryose (1987). A Study of the Abhidharmah\u1e5bdaya: The Historical Development of the Concept of Karma in the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Thought. PhD thesis. University of Wisconsin-Madison. p. 3. The magnum opus of this tradition was the massive Abhidharma commentary called the Mah\u0101vibha\u1e63a ('Great Commentary'), compiled at a great synod in Kashmir during the reign of Kanishka II (c. 158\u2013176).Westerhoff, Jan (2018) The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy in the First Millennium CE. Oxford University Press. p. 61. . The Abhidharmakosha of Vasubandhu is another very influential Abhidharma work from the northern tradition, which continues to be studied in East Asian Buddhism and in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. === Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts === Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana in South Korea, an edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon carved and preserved in over 81,000 wood printing blocks The Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the Buddha. Modern historians generally hold that the first of these texts were composed probably around the 1st century BCE or 1st century CE.Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism (2004): p. 293 In Mah\u0101y\u0101na, these texts are generally given greater authority than the early \u0100gamas and Abhidharma literature, which are called \"\u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na\" or \"Hinayana\" to distinguish them from Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras.Nattier, Jan (2003), A Few Good Men: The Bodhisattva Path according to The Inquiry of Ugra (Ugraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101), University of Hawaii Press, pp. 172\u2013174, Mah\u0101y\u0101na traditions mainly see these different classes of texts as being designed for different types of persons, with different levels of spiritual understanding. The Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras are mainly seen as being for those of \"greater\" capacity.Rinpoche, Kalu (1995), Profound Buddhism From Hinayana To Vajrayana, Clearpoint Press. p. 15. The Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras often claim to articulate the Buddha's deeper, more advanced doctrines, reserved for those who follow the bodhisattva path. That path is explained as being built upon the motivation to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name Mah\u0101y\u0101na (lit., the Great Vehicle). Besides the teaching of the bodhisattva, Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts also contain expanded cosmologies and mythologies, with many more Buddhas and powerful bodhisattvas, as well as new spiritual practices and ideas.Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism II: New Perspectives, Religion Compass 4/2 (2010): 66\u201374, The modern Theravada school does not treat the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras as authoritative or authentic teachings of the Buddha. Likewise, these texts were not recognized as authoritative by many early Buddhist schools and in some cases, communities such as the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika school split up due to this disagreement.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 68. Buddhist monk Geshe Konchog Wangdu reads Mahayana sutras from an old woodblock copy of the Tibetan Kanjur. Recent scholarship has discovered many early Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts which shed light into the development of Mah\u0101y\u0101na. Among these is the \u015a\u0101listamba Sutra which survives in Tibetan and Chinese translation. This text contains numerous sections which are remarkably similar to Pali suttas. The \u015a\u0101listamba Sutra was cited by Mah\u0101y\u0101na scholars such as the 8th-century Yasomitra to be authoritative. This suggests that Buddhist literature of different traditions shared a common core of Buddhist texts in the early centuries of its history, until Mah\u0101y\u0101na literature diverged about and after the 1st century CE. Mah\u0101y\u0101na also has a very large literature of philosophical and exegetical texts. These are often called \u015b\u0101stra (treatises) or vrittis (commentaries). Some of this literature was also written in verse form (karik\u0101s), the most famous of which is the M\u016blamadhyamika-karik\u0101 (Root Verses on the Middle Way) by Nagarjuna, the foundational text of the Madhyamika school. === Tantric texts === During the Gupta Empire, a new class of Buddhist sacred literature began to develop, which are called the Tantras.Wayman, Alex (2008). The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism. Routledge. p. 23. By the 8th century, the tantric tradition was very influential in India and beyond. Besides drawing on a Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist framework, these texts also borrowed deities and material from other Indian religious traditions, such as the \u015aaiva and Pancharatra traditions, local god/goddess cults, and local spirit worship (such as yaksha or n\u0101ga spirits).S\u00f8rensen, Henrik H; Payne, Richard K; Orzech, Charles D. (ed.) (2010). Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras, in East Asia. Handbook of Oriental Studies. p. 20.Grey, David B.; Tantra and the Tantric Traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism Some features of these texts include the widespread use of mantras, meditation on the subtle body, worship of fierce deities, and antinomian and transgressive practices such as ingesting alcohol and performing sexual rituals. ==History== ===Historical roots=== Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa meets an \u0100j\u012bvika ascetic, one of the common \u015arama\u1e47a groups in ancient India Historically, the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of Iron Age India around the middle of the first millennium BCE. This was a period of great intellectual ferment and socio-cultural change known as the \"Second urbanisation\", marked by the growth of towns and trade, the composition of the Upanishads and the historical emergence of the \u015arama\u1e47a traditions. New ideas developed both in the Vedic tradition in the form of the Upanishads, and outside of the Vedic tradition through the \u015arama\u1e47a movements.; Quote: \"But the Upanishadic ultimate meaning of the Vedas, was, from the viewpoint of the Vedic canon in general, clearly a new idea..\"; p. 95: The [oldest] Upanishads in particular were part of the Vedic corpus (...) When these various new ideas were brought together and edited, they were added on to the already existing Vedic...\"; p. 294: \"When early Jainism came into existence, various ideas mentioned in the extant older Upanishads were current,....\".; Quote: \"In the Aranyakas therefore, thought and inner spiritual awareness started to separate subtler, deeper aspects from the context of ritual performance and myth with which they had been united up to then. This process was then carried further and brought to completion in the Upanishads. (...) The knowledge and attainment of the Highest Goal had been there from the Vedic times. But in the Upanishads inner awareness, aided by major intellectual breakthroughs, arrived at a language in which Highest Goal could be dealt with directly, independent of ritual and sacred lore\". ; ; Quote: \"But he [Bronkhorst] talks about the simultaneous emergence of a Vedic and a non-Vedic asceticism. (...) [On Olivelle] Thus, the challenge for old Vedic views consisted of a new theology, written down in the early Upanishads like the Brhadaranyaka and the Mundaka Upanishad. The new set of ideas contained the....\" The term \u015arama\u1e47a refers to several Indian religious movements parallel to but separate from the historical Vedic religion, including Buddhism, Jainism and others such as \u0100j\u012bvika.AL Basham (1951), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas \u2013 a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, , pp. 94\u2013103 Several \u015arama\u1e47a movements are known to have existed in India before the 6th century BCE (pre-Buddha, pre-Mahavira), and these influenced both the \u0101stika and n\u0101stika traditions of Indian philosophy.Reginald Ray (1999), Buddhist Saints in India, Oxford University Press, , pp. 237\u2013240, 247\u2013249 According to Martin Wilshire, the \u015arama\u1e47a tradition evolved in India over two phases, namely Paccekabuddha and Savaka phases, the former being the tradition of individual ascetic and the latter of disciples, and that Buddhism and Jainism ultimately emerged from these.Martin Wiltshire (1990), Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism, De Gruyter, , p. 293 Brahmanical and non-Brahmanical ascetic groups shared and used several similar ideas, but the \u015arama\u1e47a traditions also drew upon already established Brahmanical concepts and philosophical roots, states Wiltshire, to formulate their own doctrines.Martin Wiltshire (1990), Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism, De Gruyter, , pp. 226\u2013227 Brahmanical motifs can be found in the oldest Buddhist texts, using them to introduce and explain Buddhist ideas. For example, prior to Buddhist developments, the Brahmanical tradition internalised and variously reinterpreted the three Vedic sacrificial fires as concepts such as Truth, Rite, Tranquility or Restraint. Buddhist texts also refer to the three Vedic sacrificial fires, reinterpreting and explaining them as ethical conduct. The \u015arama\u1e47a religions challenged and broke with the Brahmanic tradition on core assumptions such as Atman (soul, self), Brahman, the nature of afterlife, and they rejected the authority of the Vedas and Upanishads.P. Billimoria (1988), \u015aabdapram\u0101\u1e47a: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, , pp. 1\u201330 Buddhism was one among several Indian religions that did so. ===Indian Buddhism=== Ajanta Caves, Cave 10, a first period type chaitya worship hall with stupa but no idols. The history of Indian Buddhism may be divided into five periods: Early Buddhism (occasionally called pre-sectarian Buddhism), Nikaya Buddhism or Sectarian Buddhism: The period of the early Buddhist schools, Early Mahayana Buddhism, Late Mahayana, and the era of Vajrayana or the \"Tantric Age\". ====Pre-sectarian Buddhism==== According to Lambert Schmithausen Pre-sectarian Buddhism is \"the canonical period prior to the development of different schools with their different positions.\"Schmithausen (1987) \"Part I: Earliest Buddhism,\" Panels of the VIIth World Sanskrit Conference Vol. II: Earliest Buddhism and Madhyamaka, ed. David Seyfort Ruegg and Lambert Schmithausen, Leiden: Kern Institute, pp. 1\u20134. The early Buddhist Texts include the four principal Pali Nik\u0101yas (and their parallel Agamas found in the Chinese canon) together with the main body of monastic rules, which survive in the various versions of the patimokkha. However, these texts were revised over time, and it is unclear what constitutes the earliest layer of Buddhist teachings. One method to obtain information on the oldest core of Buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the Theravadin P\u0101li Canon and other texts. The reliability of the early sources, and the possibility to draw out a core of oldest teachings, is a matter of dispute. According to Vetter, inconsistencies remain, and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies. According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished: # \"Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials;\" # \"Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism;\" # \"Cautious optimism in this respect.\" =====The Core teachings===== According to Mitchell, certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, which has led most scholars to conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, Nirvana, the three marks of existence, the five aggregates, dependent origination, karma and rebirth. According to N. Ross Reat, all of these doctrines are shared by the Theravada Pali texts and the Mahasamghika school's \u015a\u0101listamba S\u016btra.Reat, Noble Ross. \u201cThe Historical Buddha and his Teachings\u201d. In: Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy. Ed. by Potter, Karl H. Vol. VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 AD. Motilal Banarsidass, 1996, pp. 28, 33, 37, 41, 43, 48. A recent study by Bhikkhu Analayo concludes that the Theravada Majjhima Nikaya and Sarvastivada Madhyama Agama contain mostly the same major doctrines.Analayo (2011). A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nik\u0101ya. Dharma Drum Academic Publisher. p. 891. Richard Salomon, in his study of the Gandharan texts (which are the earliest manuscripts containing early discourses), has confirmed that their teachings are \"consistent with non-Mahayana Buddhism, which survives today in the Theravada school of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, but which in ancient times was represented by eighteen separate schools.\" However, some scholars argue that critical analysis reveals discrepancies among the various doctrines found in these early texts, which point to alternative possibilities for early Buddhism. The authenticity of certain teachings and doctrines have been questioned. For example, some scholars think that karma was not central to the teaching of the historical Buddha, while other disagree with this position. Likewise, there is scholarly disagreement on whether insight was seen as liberating in early Buddhism or whether it was a later addition to the practice of the four jh\u0101nas. Scholars such as Bronkhorst also think that the four noble truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of \"liberating insight\". According to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term \"the middle way\". In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path. ====Ashokan Era and the early schools==== Sanchi Stupa No. 2, near Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh, India. According to numerous Buddhist scriptures, soon after the (from Sanskrit: \"highest extinguishment\") of Gautama Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission. Many modern scholars question the historicity of this event. However, Richard Gombrich states that the monastic assembly recitations of the Buddha's teaching likely began during Buddha's lifetime, and they served a similar role of codifying the teachings. The so called Second Buddhist council resulted in the first schism in the Sangha. Modern scholars believe that this was probably caused when a group of reformists called Sthaviras (\"elders\") sought to modify the Vinaya (monastic rule), and this caused a split with the conservatives who rejected this change, they were called Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. pp. 49, 64 While most scholars accept that this happened at some point, there is no agreement on the dating, especially if it dates to before or after the reign of Ashoka.Sujato, Bhante (2012), Sects & Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools, Santipada, Map of the Buddhist missions during the reign of Ashoka according to the Edicts of Ashoka. Buddhism may have spread only slowly throughout India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (304\u2013232 BCE), who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of A\u015boka and his descendants led to the construction of more st\u016bpas (such as at Sanchi and Bharhut), temples (such as the Mahabodhi Temple) and to its spread throughout the Maurya Empire and into neighbouring lands such as Central Asia and to the island of Sri Lanka. During and after the Mauryan period (322\u2013180 BCE), the Sthavira community gave rise to several schools, one of which was the Theravada school which tended to congregate in the south and another which was the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school, which was mainly in north India. Likewise, the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika groups also eventually split into different Sanghas. Originally, these schisms were caused by disputes over monastic disciplinary codes of various fraternities, but eventually, by about 100 CE if not earlier, schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too. Following (or leading up to) the schisms, each Sa\u1e45gha started to accumulate their own version of Tripi\u1e6daka (triple basket of texts).Tipitaka Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2015) In their Tripi\u1e6daka, each school included the Suttas of the Buddha, a Vinaya basket (disciplinary code) and some schools also added an Abhidharma basket which were texts on detailed scholastic classification, summary and interpretation of the Suttas. The doctrine details in the Abhidharmas of various Buddhist schools differ significantly, and these were composed starting about the third century BCE and through the 1st millennium CE.\"Abhidhamma Pitaka\". Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2008. ===Post-Ashokan expansion=== Extent of Buddhism and trade routes in the 1st century CE. According to the edicts of A\u015boka, the Mauryan emperor sent emissaries to various countries west of India to spread \"Dharma\", particularly in eastern provinces of the neighbouring Seleucid Empire, and even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. It is a matter of disagreement among scholars whether or not these emissaries were accompanied by Buddhist missionaries. In central and west Asia, Buddhist influence grew, through Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs and ancient Asian trade routes, a phenomenon known as Greco-Buddhism. An example of this is evidenced in Chinese and Pali Buddhist records, such as Milindapanha and the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandh\u0101ra. The Milindapanha describes a conversation between a Buddhist monk and the 2nd-century BCE Greek king Menander, after which Menander abdicates and himself goes into monastic life in the pursuit of nirvana. Some scholars have questioned the Milindapanha version, expressing doubts whether Menander was Buddhist or just favourably disposed to Buddhist monks. The Kushan empire (30\u2013375 CE) came to control the Silk Road trade through Central and South Asia, which brought them to interact with Gandharan Buddhism and the Buddhist institutions of these regions. The Kushans patronised Buddhism throughout their lands, and many Buddhist centers were built or renovated (the Sarvastivada school was particularly favored), especially by Emperor Kanishka (128\u2013151 CE).Kurt A. Behrendt, The Buddhist architecture of Gandhara, Handbuch der Orientalistik Brill, 2004, p. 13Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 57 Kushan support helped Buddhism to expand into a world religion through their trade routes. Buddhism spread to Khotan, the Tarim Basin, and China, eventually to other parts of the far east. Some of the earliest written documents of the Buddhist faith are the Gandharan Buddhist texts, dating from about the 1st century CE, and connected to the Dharmaguptaka school.\"The Discovery of 'the Oldest Buddhist Manuscripts'\" Review article by Enomoto Fumio. The Eastern Buddhist, Vol NS32 Issue I, 2000, p. 161 The Islamic conquest of the Iranian Plateau in the 7th-century, followed by the Muslim conquests of Afghanistan and the later establishment of the Ghaznavid kingdom with Islam as the state religion in Central Asia between the 10th- and 12th- century led to the decline and disappearance of Buddhism from most of these regions. ===Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism=== Kushan, the future buddha Maitreya, Gautama Buddha, the bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara, and a monk. Second\u2013third century. Guimet Museum The origins of Mah\u0101y\u0101na (\"Great Vehicle\") Buddhism are not well understood and there are various competing theories about how and where this movement arose. Theories include the idea that it began as various groups venerating certain texts or that it arose as a strict forest ascetic movement.Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism I: Recent Scholarship, Religion Compass 4/2 (2010): 55\u201365, doi:10.1111/j.1749-8171.2009.00195.x The first Mah\u0101y\u0101na works were written sometime between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE. Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mah\u0101y\u0101na comes from early Chinese translations of Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts, mainly those of Lokak\u1e63ema. (2nd century CE). Some scholars have traditionally considered the earliest Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras to include the first versions of the Prajnaparamita series, along with texts concerning Ak\u1e63obhya, which were probably composed in the 1st century BCE in the south of India. There is no evidence that Mah\u0101y\u0101na ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, with a separate monastic code (Vinaya), but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Records written by Chinese monks visiting India indicate that both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and non-Mah\u0101y\u0101na monks could be found in the same monasteries, with the difference that Mah\u0101y\u0101na monks worshipped figures of Bodhisattvas, while non-Mahayana monks did not. Site of Nalanda University, a great center of Mah\u0101y\u0101na thought Mah\u0101y\u0101na initially seems to have remained a small minority movement that was in tension with other Buddhist groups, struggling for wider acceptance.Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 18. However, during the fifth and sixth centuries CE, there seems to have been a rapid growth of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, which is shown by a large increase in epigraphic and manuscript evidence in this period. However, it still remained a minority in comparison to other Buddhist schools.Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, pp. 29-34. Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist institutions continued to grow in influence during the following centuries, with large monastic university complexes such as Nalanda (established by the 5th-century CE Gupta emperor, Kumaragupta I) and Vikramashila (established under Dharmapala c. 783 to 820) becoming quite powerful and influential. During this period of Late Mah\u0101y\u0101na, four major types of thought developed: M\u0101dhyamaka, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, Buddha-nature (Tath\u0101gatagarbha), and the Pramana school of Dignaga. According to Dan Lusthaus, M\u0101dhyamaka and Yog\u0101c\u0101ra have a great deal in common, and the commonality stems from early Buddhism. ===Late Indian Buddhism and Tantra=== Vajrayana adopted deities such as Bhairava, known as Yamantaka in Tibetan Buddhism. During the Gupta period (4th\u20136th centuries) and the empire of Har\u1e63avardana (c. 590\u2013647 CE), Buddhism continued to be influential in India, and large Buddhist learning institutions such as Nalanda and Valabahi Universities were at their peak. Buddhism also flourished under the support of the P\u0101la Empire (8th\u201312th centuries). Under the Guptas and Palas, Tantric Buddhism or Vajrayana developed and rose to prominence. It promoted new practices such as the use of mantras, dharanis, mudras, mandalas and the visualization of deities and Buddhas and developed a new class of literature, the Buddhist Tantras. This new esoteric form of Buddhism can be traced back to groups of wandering yogi magicians called mahasiddhas.Ray, Reginald A (2000) Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism.Davidson, Ronald M.,(2002). Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, Columbia University Press, p. 228, 234. The question of the origins of early Vajrayana has been taken up by various scholars. David Seyfort Ruegg has suggested that Buddhist tantra employed various elements of a \"pan-Indian religious substrate\" which is not specifically Buddhist, Shaiva or Vaishnava.Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 171. According to Indologist Alexis Sanderson, various classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Saivism. Sanderson has argued that Buddhist tantras can be shown to have borrowed practices, terms, rituals and more form Shaiva tantras. He argues that Buddhist texts even directly copied various Shaiva tantras, especially the Bhairava Vidyapitha tantras.Sanderson, Alexis. \"The \u015aaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of \u015aaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo. Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009. Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, pp. 23, 124, 129-31.Sanderson, Alexis; Vajrayana:, Origin and Function, 1994 Ronald M. Davidson meanwhile, argues that Sanderson's claims for direct influence from Shaiva Vidyapitha texts are problematic because \"the chronology of the Vidyapitha tantras is by no means so well established\"Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 204. and that the Shaiva tradition also appropriated non-Hindu deities, texts and traditions. Thus while \"there can be no question that the Buddhist tantras were heavily influenced by Kapalika and other Saiva movements\" argues Davidson, \"the influence was apparently mutual.\"Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 217. Already during this later era, Buddhism was losing state support in other regions of India, including the lands of the Karkotas, the Pratiharas, the Rashtrakutas, the Pandyas and the Pallavas. This loss of support in favor of Hindu faiths like Vaishnavism and Shaivism, is the beginning of the long and complex period of the Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent.Omvedt, Gail (2003). \"Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste\", p. 172. The Islamic invasions and conquest of India (10th to 12th century), further damaged and destroyed many Buddhist institutions, leading to its eventual near disappearance from India by the 1200s. === Spread to East and Southeast Asia === Angkor Thom build by Khmer King Jayavarman VII (c. 1120\u20131218). The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism to China is most commonly thought to have started in the late 2nd or the 1st century CE, though the literary sources are all open to question. The first documented translation efforts by foreign Buddhist monks in China were in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the Kushan Empire into the Chinese territory of the Tarim Basin. The first documented Buddhist texts translated into Chinese are those of the Parthian An Shigao (148\u2013180 CE).Z\u00fcrcher, Erik. 2007 (1959). The Buddhist Conquest of China: The Spread and Adaptation of Buddhism in Early Medieval China. 3rd ed. Leiden: Brill. pp. 32\u201334 The first known Mah\u0101y\u0101na scriptural texts are translations into Chinese by the Kushan monk Lokak\u1e63ema in Luoyang, between 178 and 189 CE. From China, Buddhism was introduced into its neighbours Korea (4th century), Japan (6th\u20137th centuries), and Vietnam (c. 1st\u20132nd centuries).Dykstra, Yoshiko Kurata; De Bary, William Theodore (2001). Sources of Japanese tradition. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 100. .Nguyen Tai Thu. The History of Buddhism in Vietnam. 2008. During the Chinese Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), Chinese Esoteric Buddhism was introduced from India and Chan Buddhism (Zen) became a major religion.McRae, John (2003), Seeing Through Zen, The University Press Group Ltd, pp. 13, 18Orzech, Charles D. (general editor) (2011). Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia. Brill. p. 4 Chan continued to grow in the Song dynasty (960\u20131279) and it was during this era that it strongly influenced Korean Buddhism and Japanese Buddhism.McRae, John (2003), Seeing Through Zen, The University Press Group Ltd, pp. 13, 19\u201321 Pure Land Buddhism also became popular during this period and was often practised together with Chan.Heng-Ching Shih (1987). Yung-Ming's Syncretism of Pure Land and Chan, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 10 (1), p. 117 It was also during the Song that the entire Chinese canon was printed using over 130,000 wooden printing blocks. During the Indian period of Esoteric Buddhism (from the 8th century onwards), Buddhism spread from India to Tibet and Mongolia. Johannes Bronkhorst states that the esoteric form was attractive because it allowed both a secluded monastic community as well as the social rites and rituals important to laypersons and to kings for the maintenance of a political state during succession and wars to resist invasion. During the Middle Ages, Buddhism slowly declined in India, while it vanished from Persia and Central Asia as Islam became the state religion. The Theravada school arrived in Sri Lanka sometime in the 3rd century BCE. Sri Lanka became a base for its later spread to southeast Asia after the 5th century CE (Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia and coastal Vietnam). Theravada Buddhism was the dominant religion in Burma during the Mon Hanthawaddy Kingdom (1287\u20131552).Myint-U, Thant (2006). The River of Lost Footsteps \u2013 Histories of Burma. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. . pp. 64\u201365 It also became dominant in the Khmer Empire during the 13th and 14th centuries and in the Thai Sukhothai Kingdom during the reign of Ram Khamhaeng (1237/1247\u20131298).C\u0153d\u00e8s, George (1968).

University of Hawaii Press. .Gyallay-Pap, Peter. \"Notes of the Rebirth of Khmer Buddhism,\" Radical Conservativism. ==Schools and traditions== Distribution of major Buddhist traditions Buddhists generally classify themselves as either Therav\u0101da or Mah\u0101y\u0101na. This classification is also used by some scholars and is the one ordinarily used in the English language. An alternative scheme used by some scholars divides Buddhism into the following three traditions or geographical or cultural areas: Therav\u0101da (or \"Southern Buddhism\", \"South Asian Buddhism\"), East Asian Buddhism (or just \"Eastern Buddhism\") and Indo- Tibetan Buddhism (or \"Northern Buddhism\"). Buddhists of various traditions, Yeunten Ling Tibetan Institute Some scholars use other schemes. Buddhists themselves have a variety of other schemes. Hinayana (literally \"lesser or inferior vehicle\") is sometimes used by Mah\u0101y\u0101na followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary Therav\u0101da emerged, but as the Hinayana term is considered derogatory, a variety of other terms are used instead, including: \u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na, Nikaya Buddhism, early Buddhist schools, sectarian Buddhism and conservative Buddhism. Not all traditions of Buddhism share the same philosophical outlook, or treat the same concepts as central. Each tradition, however, does have its own core concepts, and some comparisons can be drawn between them: * Both Therav\u0101da and Mah\u0101y\u0101na accept and revere the Buddha Sakyamuni as the founder, Mah\u0101y\u0101na also reveres numerous other Buddhas, such as Amitabha or Vairocana as well as many other bodhisattvas not revered in Therav\u0101da. * Both accept the Middle Way, Dependent origination, the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Three Jewels, the Three marks of existence and the Bodhipak\u1e63adharmas (aids to awakening). * Mah\u0101y\u0101na focuses mainly on the bodhisattva path to Buddhahood which it sees as universal and to be practiced by all persons, while Therav\u0101da does not focus on teaching this path and teaches the attainment of arhatship as a worthy goal to strive towards. The bodhisattva path is not denied in Therav\u0101da, it is generally seen as a long and difficult path suitable for only a few. Thus the Bodhisattva path is normative in Mah\u0101y\u0101na, while it is an optional path for a heroic few in Therav\u0101da. * Mah\u0101y\u0101na sees the arhat's nirvana as being imperfect and inferior or preliminary to full Buddhahood. It sees arhatship as selfish, since bodhisattvas vow to save all beings while arhats save only themselves.Johnston, William M. (2013) \"Encyclopedia of Monasticism\" p. 600. Routledge. Therav\u0101da meanwhile does not accept that the arhat's nirvana is an inferior or preliminary attainment, nor that it is a selfish deed to attain arhatship since not only are arhats described as compassionate but they have destroyed the root of greed, the sense of \"I am\". * Mah\u0101y\u0101na accepts the authority of the many Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras along with the other Nikaya texts like the Agamas and the Pali canon (though it sees Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts as primary), while Therav\u0101da does not accept that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras are buddhavacana (word of the Buddha) at all.Hay, Jeff (2009). \"World Religions\" p. 189. Greenhaven Publishing LLC. === Therav\u0101da school === Monastics and white clad laypersons celebrate Vesak, Vipassakna Dhaurak, Cambodia The Therav\u0101da tradition bases itself on the P\u0101li Canon, considers itself to be the more orthodox form of Buddhism and tends to be more conservative in doctrine and monastic discipline.; Quote: \"Orthodox forms of Buddhism are collectively called Hinayana (...). Present-day practitioners of orthodox Buddhism prefer to use the name Theravada (Buddhism of the Elders).\"; Quote: \"Theravadins claim that they alone represent true Buddhist orthodoxy, and that other sects are heretics\". The P\u0101li Canon is the only complete Buddhist canon surviving in an ancient Indian language. This language, P\u0101li, serves as the school's sacred language and lingua franca.Crosby, Kate (2013), Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity, p. 2. Besides the P\u0101li Canon, Therav\u0101da scholastics also often rely on a post-canonical P\u0101li literature which comments on and interprets the P\u0101li Canon. These later works such as the Visuddhimagga, a doctrinal summa written in the fifth century by the exegete Buddhaghosa also remain influential today.Crosby, Kate (2013), Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity, p. 86. Therav\u0101da derives from the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra (T\u0101mrapar\u1e47\u012bya) sect, a Sri Lankan branch of the Vibhajyav\u0101da Sthaviras, which began to establish itself on the island from the 3rd century BCE onwards. Therav\u0101da flourished in south India and Sri Lanka in ancient times; from there it spread for the first time into mainland southeast Asia about the 11th century into its elite urban centres. By the 13th century, Therav\u0101da had spread widely into the rural areas of mainland southeast Asia, displacing Mahayana Buddhism and some traditions of Hinduism. In the modern era, Buddhist figures such as Anagarika Dhammapala and King Mongkut sought to re-focus the tradition on the P\u0101li Canon, as well as emphasize the rational and \"scientific\" nature of Therav\u0101da while also opposing \"superstition\". This movement, often termed Buddhist modernism, has influenced most forms of modern Therav\u0101da. Another influential modern turn in Therav\u0101da is the Vipassana Movement, which led to the widespread adoption of meditation by laypersons. Therav\u0101da is primarily practised today in Sri Lanka, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as small portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Bangladesh. It has a growing presence in the west, especially as part of the Vipassana Movement. === Mah\u0101y\u0101na traditions === Chinese Buddhist monks performing a formal ceremony in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. Mah\u0101y\u0101na (\"Great Vehicle\") refers to all forms of Buddhism which consider the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Sutras as authoritative scriptures and accurate rendering of Buddha's words. These traditions have been the more liberal form of Buddhism allowing different and new interpretations that emerged over time. The focus of Mah\u0101y\u0101na is the path of the bodhisattva (bodhisattvay\u0101na), though what this path means is interpreted in many different ways. The first Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts date to sometime between the 1st century BCE and the 2st century CE. It remained a minority movement until the time of the Guptas and Palas, when great Mah\u0101y\u0101na monastic centres of learning such as N\u0101land\u0101 University were established as evidenced by records left by three Chinese visitors to India. These universities supported Buddhist scholarship, as well as studies into non-Buddhist traditions and secular subjects such as medicine. They hosted visiting students who then spread Buddhism to East and Central Asia. Native Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism is practised today in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, parts of Russia and most of Vietnam (also commonly referred to as \"Eastern Buddhism\"). The Buddhism practised in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also a form of Mah\u0101y\u0101na, but is also different in many ways due to its adoption of tantric practices and is discussed below under the heading of \"Vajray\u0101na\" (also commonly referred to as \"Northern Buddhism\"). Tibetan Buddhists practicing Ch\u00f6d with various ritual implements, such as the Damaru drum, hand- bell, and Kangling (thighbone trumpet). Ruins of a temple at the Erdene Zuu Monastery complex in Mongolia. There are a variety of strands in Eastern Buddhism, of which \"the Pure Land school of Mah\u0101y\u0101na is the most widely practised today.\" In most of China, these different strands and traditions are generally fused together. Vietnamese Mah\u0101y\u0101na is similarly very eclectic. In Japan in particular, they form separate denominations with the five major ones being: Nichiren, peculiar to Japan; Pure Land; Shingon, a form of Vajrayana; Tendai, and Zen. In Korea, nearly all Buddhists belong to the Chogye school, which is officially Son (Zen), but with substantial elements from other traditions. ==== Vajray\u0101na traditions ==== The goal and philosophy of the Vajray\u0101na remains Mah\u0101y\u0101nist, but its methods are seen by its followers as far more powerful, so as to lead to Buddhahood in just one lifetime. The practice of using mantras was adopted from Hinduism, where they were first used in the Vedas. Tibetan Buddhism preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India. Tantric Buddhism is largely concerned with ritual and meditative practices. A central feature of Buddhist Tantra is deity yoga which includes visualisation and identification with an enlightened yidam or meditation deity and its associated mandala. Another element of Tantra is the need for ritual initiation or empowerment (abhi\u1e63eka) by a Guru or Lama. Some Tantras like the Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra features new forms of antinomian ritual practice such as the use taboo substances like alcohol, sexual yoga, and charnel ground practices which evoke wrathful deities. ==Monasteries and temples== Buddhist institutions are often housed and centered around monasteries (Sanskrit:viharas) and temples. Buddhist monastics originally followed a life of wandering, never staying in one place for long. During the three month rainy season (vassa) they would gather together in one place for a period of intense practice and then depart again. Some of the earliest Buddhist monasteries were at groves (vanas) or woods (ara\u00f1\u00f1as), such as Jetavana and Sarnath's Deer Park. There originally seems to have been two main types of monasteries, monastic settlements (sangharamas) were built and supported by donors, and woodland camps (avasas) were set up by monks. Whatever structures were built in these locales were made out of wood and were sometimes temporary structures built for the rainy season. Over time, the wandering community slowly adopted more settled cenobitic forms of monasticism. Also, these monasteries slowly evolved from the simpler collections of rustic dwellings of early Buddhism into larger more permanent structures meant to house the entire community, who now lived in a more collective fashion. During the Gupta era, even larger monastic university complexes (like Nalanda) arose, with larger and more artistically ornate structures, as well as large land grants and accumulated wealth. There are many different forms of Buddhist structures. Classic Indian Buddhist institutions mainly made use of the following structures: monasteries, rock-hewn cave complexes (such as the Ajanta Caves), stupas (funerary mounds which contained relics), and temples such as the Mahabodhi Temple.Huu Phuoc Le (2010). Buddhist Architecture. Grafikol. In Southeast Asia, the most widespread institutions are centered on wats, which refers to an establishment with various buildings such as an ordination hall, a library, monks' quarters and stupas. East Asian Buddhist institutions also use various structures including monastic halls, temples, lecture halls, bell towers and pagodas. In Japanese Buddhist temples, these different structures are usually grouped together in an area termed the garan. In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhist institutions are generally housed in gompas. They include monastic quarters, stupas and prayer halls with Buddha images. The complexity of Buddhist institutions varies, ranging from minimalist and rustic forest monasteries to large monastic centers like Tawang Monastery. The core of traditional Buddhist institutions is the monastic community (Sangha) who manage and lead religious services. They are supported by the lay community who visit temples and monasteries for religious services and holidays. In the modern era, the Buddhist \"meditation centre\", which is mostly used by laypersons and often also staffed by them, has also become widespread.Schedneck, Brooke (2015). Thailand's International Meditation Centers: Tourism and the Global Commodification of Religious Practices. Routledge ==Buddhism in the modern era== Buryat Buddhist monk in Siberia ===Colonial era=== Buddhism has faced various challenges and changes during the colonisation of Buddhist states by Christian countries and its persecution under modern states. Like other religions, the findings of modern science has challenged its basic premises. One response to some of these challenges has come to be called Buddhist modernism. Early Buddhist modernist figures such as the American convert Henry Olcott (1832\u20131907) and Anagarika Dharmapala (1864\u20131933) reinterpreted and promoted Buddhism as a scientific and rational religion which they saw as compatible with modern science. East Asian Buddhism meanwhile suffered under various wars which ravaged China during the modern era, such as the Taiping rebellion and World War II (which also affected Korean Buddhism). During the Republican period (1912\u201349), a new movement called Humanistic Buddhism was developed by figures such as Taixu (1899\u20131947), and though Buddhist institutions were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376), there has been a revival of the religion in China after 1977. Japanese Buddhism also went through a period of modernisation during the Meiji period. In Central Asia meanwhile, the arrival of Communist repression to Tibet (1966\u20131980) and Mongolia (between 1924\u20131990) had a strong negative impact on Buddhist institutions, though the situation has improved somewhat since the 80s and 90s. ===Buddhism in the West=== 1893 World Parliament of Religions in Chicago While there were some encounters of Western travellers or missionaries such as St. Francis Xavier and Ippolito Desideri with Buddhist cultures, it was not until the 19th century that Buddhism began to be studied by Western scholars. It was the work of pioneering scholars such as Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf, Max M\u00fcller, Hermann Oldenberg and Thomas William Rhys Davids that paved the way for modern Buddhist studies in the West. The English words such as Buddhism, \"Boudhist\", \"Bauddhist\" and Buddhist were coined in the early 19th-century in the West,Buddhism, Buddhist, Etymology, Douglas Harper while in 1881, Rhys Davids founded the Pali Text Society \u2013 an influential Western resource of Buddhist literature in the Pali language and one of the earliest publisher of a journal on Buddhist studies.Pali Text Society, Encyclopaedia Britannica It was also during the 19th century that Asian Buddhist immigrants (mainly from China and Japan) began to arrive in Western countries such as the United States and Canada, bringing with them their Buddhist religion. This period also saw the first Westerners to formally convert to Buddhism, such as Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott.Prothero, The White Buddhist, 175. Olcott\u2019s approach to Buddhism and the terminology of Protestant Buddhism and \"creolization\" (Prothero) is extensively discussed in K.A. McMahan,\" \u2018Creolization\u2019 in American Religious History. The Metaphysical Nature of Henry Steel Olcott, PhD dissertation, unpublished manuscript (Ann Arbor 2008). An important event in the introduction of Buddhism to the West was the 1893 World Parliament of Religions, which for the first time saw well-publicized speeches by major Buddhist leaders alongside other religious leaders. The 20th century saw a prolific growth of new Buddhist institutions in Western countries, including the Buddhist Society, London (1924), Das Buddhistische Haus (1924) and Datsan Gunzechoinei in St Petersburg. The publication and translations of Buddhist literature in Western languages thereafter accelerated. After the second world war, further immigration from Asia, globalisation, the secularisation on Western culture as well a renewed interest in Buddhism among the 60s counterculture led to further growth in Buddhist institutions.Coleman, James William, The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition, Oxford University Press, pp. 203\u2013204. Influential figures on post- war Western Buddhism include Shunryu Suzuki, Jack Kerouac, Alan Watts, Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh, and the 14th Dalai Lama. While Buddhist institutions have grown, some of the central premises of Buddhism such as the cycles of rebirth and Four Noble Truths have been problematic in the West. In contrast, states Christopher Gowans, for \"most ordinary [Asian] Buddhists, today as well as in the past, their basic moral orientation is governed by belief in karma and rebirth\". Most Asian Buddhist laypersons, states Kevin Trainor, have historically pursued Buddhist rituals and practices seeking better rebirth, not nirvana or freedom from rebirth. Buddhism has spread across the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While Buddhism in the West is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognised as the state religion and receives government support. In certain regions such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, militants have targeted violence and destruction of historic Buddhist monuments. ===Neo- Buddhism movements=== A number of modern movements in Buddhism emerged during the second half of the 20th century. These new forms of Buddhism are diverse and significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices. In India, B.R. Ambedkar launched the Navayana tradition \u2013 literally, \"new vehicle\". Ambedkar's Buddhism rejects the foundational doctrines and historic practices of traditional Theravada and Mahayana traditions, such as monk lifestyle after renunciation, karma, rebirth, samsara, meditation, nirvana, Four Noble Truths and others. Ambedkar's Navayana Buddhism considers these as superstitions and re-interprets the original Buddha as someone who taught about class struggle and social equality. Ambedkar urged low caste Indian Dalits to convert to his Marxism-inspired reinterpretation called the Navayana Buddhism, also known as Bhimayana Buddhism. Ambedkar's effort led to the expansion of Navayana Buddhism in India. The Thai King Mongkut (r. 1851\u201368), and his son King Chulalongkorn (r. 1868\u20131910), were responsible for modern reforms of Thai Buddhism. Modern Buddhist movements include Secular Buddhism in many countries, Won Buddhism in Korea, the Dhammakaya movement in Thailand and several Japanese organisations, such as Shinnyo-en, Rissh\u014d K\u014dsei Kai or Soka Gakkai. Some of these movements have brought internal disputes and strife within regional Buddhist communities. For example, the Dhammakaya movement in Thailand teaches a \"true self\" doctrine, which traditional Theravada monks consider as heretically denying the fundamental anatta (not-self) doctrine of Buddhism. ===Sexual abuse and misconduct=== Buddhism has not been immune from sexual abuse and misconduct scandals, with victims coming forward in various buddhist schools such as Zen and Tibetan. \u201cThere are huge cover ups in the Catholic church, but what has happened within Tibetan Buddhism is totally along the same lines,\u201d says Mary Finnigan, an author and journalist who has been chronicling such alleged abuses since the mid-80s. One notably covered case in media of various Western country was that of Sogyal Rinpoche which began in 1994, and end up by his retirement from his position as Rigpa's spiritual director in 2017. ==Cultural influence== A painting by G.B. Hooijer (c. 1916\u20131919) reconstructing a scene of Borobudur, the largest Buddhist temple in the world. Buddhism has had a profound influence on various cultures, especially in Asia. Buddhist philosophy, Buddhist art, Buddhist architecture, Buddhist cuisine and Buddhist festivals continue to be influential elements of the modern Culture of Asia, especially in East Asia and the Sinosphere as well as in Southeast Asia and the Indosphere. According to Litian Fang, Buddhism has \"permeated a wide range of fields, such as politics, ethics, philosophy, literature, art and customs,\" in these Asian regions.Fang, Litian (2018). \"Chinese Buddhism and Traditional Culture,\" p. 212. Routledge. Buddhist teachings influenced the development of modern Hinduism as well as other Asian religions like Taoism and Confucianism. For example, various scholars have argued that key Hindu thinkers such as Adi Shankara and Patanjali, author of the Yoga sutras, were influenced by Buddhist ideas.Nina Mirnig, Peter-Daniel Szanto, Michael Williams (2013). Puspika: Tracing Ancient India Through Texts and Traditions: Contributions to Current Research in Indology Volume I, p. 210. Oxbow Books.S.N. Dasgupta (1997). History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1. p. 494. Likewise, Buddhist practices were influential in the early development of Indian Yoga.James Mallinson, Mark Singleton (2017). Roots of Yoga Penguin UK Buddhist philosophers like Dignaga were very influential in the development of Indian logic and epistemology. Buddhist educational institutions like Nalanda and Vikramashila preserved various disciplines of classical Indian knowledge such as Grammar and Medicine and taught foreign students from China. Frontispiece of the Chinese Diamond S\u016btra, the oldest known dated printed book in the world In an effort to preserve their sacred scriptures, Buddhist institutions such as temples and monasteries housed schools which educated the populace and promoted writing and literacy. This led to high levels of literacy among some traditional Buddhist societies such as Burma. According to David Steinberg, \"Early British observers claimed that Burma was the most literate state between Suez and Japan, and one British traveler in the early nineteenth century believed that Burmese women had a higher percentage of literacy than British women.\" Buddhist institutions were also at the forefront of the adoption of Chinese technologies related to bookmaking, including paper, and block printing which Buddhists sometimes deployed on a large scale. The first surviving example of a printed text is a Buddhist charm, the first full printed book is the Buddhist Diamond Sutra (c. 868) and the first hand colored print is an illustration of Guanyin dated to 947. Buddhists were also influential in the study and practice of traditional forms of Indian medicine. Buddhists spread these traditional approaches to health, sometimes called \"Buddhist medicine\", throughout East and Southeast Asia, where they remain influential today in regions like Sri Lanka, Burma, Tibet and Thailand. In the Western world, Buddhism has had a strong influence on modern New Age spirituality and other alternative spiritualities. This began with its influence on 20th century Theosophists such as Helena Blavatsky, which were some of the first Westerners to take Buddhism seriously as a spiritual tradition.Cush, Denise. British Buddhism and the New Age in The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of New Age Religions edited by James R. Lewis. More recently, Buddhist meditation practices have influenced the development of modern psychology, particularly the practice of Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and other similar mindfulness based modalities.Fromm, Erich (1989, 2002). The Art of Being. NY: Continuum. .Kabat- Zinn, Jon (2005). Coming to Our Senses: Healing Ourselves and the World Through Mindfulness. pp. 12\u201313. Hyperion. . The influence of Buddhism on psychology can also be seen in certain forms of modern psychoanalysis.Hoffer (ed.); Freud and the Buddha: The Couch and the Cushion.Fromm, Erich, D. T. Suzuki & Richard De Martino (1960). Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis. pp. 77\u201378, NY: Harper & Row. . Buddhism also influenced the modern avant-garde movements during the 1950s and 60s through people like D. T. Suzuki and his influence on figures like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Pearlman, Ellen (2012) Nothing and EverythingThe Influence of Buddhism on the American Avant Garde: 1942\u20131962 North Atlantic Books ===Relationships with other Religious Traditions=== ==== Shamanism ==== Shamanism is a widespread practice in Buddhist societies. Buddhist monasteries have long existed alongside local shamanic traditions. Lacking an institutional orthodoxy, Buddhists adapted to the local cultures, blending their own traditions with pre-existing shamanic culture. There was very little conflict between the sects, mostly limited to the shamanic practice of animal sacrifice, which Buddhists see as equivalent to killing one's parents. However, Buddhism requires acceptance of Buddha as the greatest being in the cosmos, and local shamanic traditions were bestowed an inferior status. Research into Himalayan religion has shown that Buddhist and shamanic traditions overlap in many respects: the worship of localized deities, healing rituals and exorcisms. The shamanic Gurung people have adopted some of the Buddhist beliefs such and rebirth but maintain the shamanic rites of \"guiding the soul\" after death. Geoffrey Samuel describes Shamanic Buddhism: \"Vajrayana Buddhism as practiced in Tibet may be described as shamanic, in that it is centered around communication with an alternative mode of reality via the alternative states of consciousness of Tantric Yoga\". ==Demographics== Buddhism is practised by an estimated 488 million, 495 million, or 535 million people as of the 2010s, representing 7% to 8% of the world's total population. Percentage of Buddhists by country, according to the Pew Research Center, as of 2010 China is the country with the largest population of Buddhists, approximately 244 million or 18% of its total population. They are mostly followers of Chinese schools of Mahayana, making this the largest body of Buddhist traditions. Mahayana, also practised in broader East Asia, is followed by over half of world Buddhists. According to a demographic analysis reported by Peter Harvey: Mahayana has 360 million adherents; Theravada has 150 million adherents; and Vajrayana has 18 million adherents. According to , Buddhism has grown from a total of 138 million adherents in 1910, of which 137 million were in Asia, to 495 million in 2010, of which 487 million are in Asia. Over 98% of all Buddhists live in the Asia- Pacific and South Asia region. North America had about 3.9 million Buddhists, Europe 1.3 million, while South America, Africa and the Middle East had an estimated combined total of about 1 million Buddhists in 2010. Buddhism is the dominant religion in Bhutan, Myanmar, Cambodia, Tibet, Laos, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Large Buddhist populations live in China (18%), Japan (36%), Taiwan (35%), Macau (17%), North Korea (14%), Nepal (11%), Vietnam (10%), Singapore (33%), Hong Kong (15%) and South Korea (23%). In Russia, Buddhists form majority in Tuva (52%) and Kalmykia (53%). Buryatia (20%) and Zabaykalsky Krai (15%) also have significant Buddhist populations. Buddhism is also growing by conversion. In United States, only about a third (32%) of Buddhists in the United States are Asian; a majority (53%) are white. Buddhism in the America is primarily made up of native-born adherents, whites and converts. In New Zealand, about 25\u201335% of the total Buddhists are converts to Buddhism.https://royalsociety.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Our-futures- submissionPaul-Morris.pdf The 10 countries with the largest Buddhist population densities are: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Buddhism by percentage |- !
