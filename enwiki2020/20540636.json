The station is the first Rail Runner stop to be constructed on private land. Officials had predicted that the station was scheduled to open in August 2011, following an agreement from the city's finance committee that the stop will open if the owners construct parking and transit facilities for the stationSanta Fe council committee agrees to opening of Zia Rail Runner stop and the station opened in April 2017.http://riometro.org/rio-metro-schedules/train-schedule/45-ct-categories- en/ct-stations-connections-en/station-information/132-zia-road-station- information The station is located at the intersection of Zia Road & St. Francis Drive, and is planned to be the center of a mixed-use, transit- oriented development.Zia Station - Santa Fe, NM Each of the Rail Runner stations contains an icon to express each community's identity. The icon representing this station is the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi. NMDOT recently opened to the media that they are waiting for the traffic study to be complete before construction can begin on a parking lot, and whether the area will be created for mixed-use development. However, Santa Fe City Council has indicated back in 2011 that although the land may be mixed use development, the station itself would be a Kiss-n-Ride station, meaning there will be no dedicated Rail Runner parking spots. In February 2015, The Santa Fe Metropolitan Planning Organization completed tests of trains stopping at the station and the impact of the surrounding area. ==Recent developments== In May 2016, the New Mexico Department of Transportation approved construction plans for infrastructure needed to create a passenger pick-up and drop-off area for the station, including an access road, sidewalks, and lighting. As of August 2016, construction permits had been issued to the developer responsible for the site, allowing the start of construction of the passenger pick-up and drop-off area. As of September 2016, construction at the site was temporarily altering traffic flow at a nearby intersection, of W. Zia Road and Galisteo Road, through temporary lane changes. In January 2017, the New Mexico Department of Transportation issued a letter deeming improvements made by the city to be acceptable, and authorizing the station to open. At that time, the opening of the station was expected to occur \"as early as late March, following a public comment period.\" It was announced in March 2017 that the station would be opening on the 24th of April.https://www.riometro.org/rio- metro-news/716-zia-rd-station-opening ==References== ==External links== *Stations, Zia Road Official Rail Runner site Category:Railway stations in New Mexico Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2017 Category:Buildings and structures in Santa Fe, New Mexico Category:Transportation in Santa Fe County, New Mexico ",
