In the heart of North Macedonia's wine country, it is home to the largest winery in Southeast Europe, named after the Tikve\u0161 plain. The town of Kavadarci is the seat of Kavadarci Municipality. Situated near Kavadarci is North Macedonia's largest artificial lake, Lake Tikve\u0161. ==History== ===Classical period=== In the Tikve\u0161 region around Kavadarci, many artefacts and structures have been discovered dating back to prehistoric times. Bronze and ceramic artefacts were discovered at an archaeological site in the nearby town of Stobi () dating to the 6th and 7th century BC. This town is said to have been established during the Hellenic period; being on the main road of Via Egnatia that led from the Danube to the Aegean Sea meant it became an important military, economic and cultural hub. The establishment of a mint during the Roman period aided in its prosperity and achieving the status of municipium, denars and coins reading \u201cMunicipium Stobensium\u201d were also produced in this area. Numerous buildings and monuments of this era such as a theatre have been discovered. A Jewish community is said to have existed in Stobi during the 3rd century, however, its synagogue was torn down in the 4th century and a Christian basilica was built in its place. In the late 5th and early 6th century, the town was devastated in the great Avaro-Slavonic invasions. Stobi which was previously the centre of this region was replaced by the new village of Dukena. ===Ottoman Empire=== Kavadarci \u2013 early 20th century Much change took place during the occupation of the Ottoman Empire in the 14th century; the occupying Ottomans destroyed all existing villages replacing them with oriental architecture. Villagers from Rashtani and Dukena fleeing from the Ottomans settled in a new area, bringing with them many families that exist in Kavadarci today. From this settlement a new village emerged. During the 17th century this growing village attracted much attention and spurred a large migration of people from the surrounding hills and villages, establishing the new town called Kavadarci. Kavadarci was under the jurisdiction of Bitola's area Pashaluk (Ottoman military territorial unit controlled by a Pasha). With the Turkish majority, many beys residences and several mosques were built throughout the town. By this time Kavadarci had been firmly established as the new centre of the Tikve\u0161 region. During the period of Bulgarian National Revival, a Bulgarian church municipality functioned in the town.\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438. \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0435\u043a\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u041e\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434 \u041e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 1877-1878. \u0422\u043e\u043c \u043f\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0438, \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0430, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 567.
