After studying piano and cello, she studied contemporary composition and orchestra at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. At the age of 23 Michalitsianos moved to the United States at the invitation of Mark Linkous, where she performed on the albums Good Morning Spider and Its A Wonderful Life by his indie rock band Sparklehorse. After her time with Sparklehorse, Michalitsianos moved to Upstate New York, where she set up her own studio. Though the studio and almost all her compositions were destroyed in an explosion, Michalitsianos herself was not harmed. On April 10, 2006 she released her debut album The Bells of 1 2 on Gr\u00f6nland Records/Rough Trade. Michalitsianos wrote, sang, played and produced all 12 tracks on the album herself. The track 'Enter One' was featured in several movies and tv-shows: Son of a Gun, Dark (season 1, episode 6) and Final Space (season 1, episode 6). On March 1, 2012 the EP The Bird Calls, and Its Song Awakens the Air, and I Call was released first on iTunes and later also in FLAC format on indieTorrent. The EP is no longer available on Gr\u00f6nland Records but only as an online download. Michalitsianos lives in New York. == Discography == === Albums === * 2006: The Bells of 1 2 * 2006: Pssscheeow * 2018: I Am As You Are * 2020: I.A.A.Y.A Part One === Singles === * 2006: Move * 2006: Slo Fuzz * 2006: Supermarket Sweep * 2012: A Bird Calls and Its Song Awakens the Air, and I Call == References == == External links == * Official page Sol Seppy * * * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:American electronic musicians Category:American female singer- songwriters Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:Women in electronic music Category:British women record producers Category:21st-century women singers Category:English expatriates in Australia Category:American expatriates in Australia Category:English expatriates in Greece Category:American expatriates in Greece Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:Gr\u00f6nland Records artists Category:Rough Trade Records artists ",
