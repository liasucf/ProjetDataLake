She became the muse of the American photographer Tom Sewell before marrying the singer Alain Bashung in 2001. She met Bashung while shooting the music video La nuit je mens, and for their marriage they recorded Song of Songs, set to Rodolphe Burger's music. They have a daughter named Popp\u00e9e. In 2006, inspired by Calamity Jane's Letters to my daughter, she wrote and composed La Ballade de Calamity Jane. Her husband Alain Bashung, and the guitarist and leader of the band Kat Onoma Rodolphe Burger helped bring the project to life. In the same year, she published her debut solo album Chienne d'un seul, which she performed on stage during the first part of her husband's tour, La Tourn\u00e9e des grands espaces. In 2009, she wrote, composed and self-produced her second solo album, Par la rivi\u00e8re, an opus she defines as \"punk/country\" and that she played alone or with a small band in France and the United States. Her third solo album, Walking, was recorded at the end of 2010 in Kingston, New York, and produced by Malcolm Burn, who has worked with Bob Dylan, Iggy Pop, and Emmylou Harris among others. She brought Walking on tour, accompanied by guitarist Yan P\u00e9chin . After her husband Alain Bashung's death in 2009, Mons published a diary- style book recounting her husband's final hours. The book, Let Go, was released on the 2nd of March 2012, by the publisher Fetjaine. 2012 also marked the release of Il Buio, a duet album with the guitarist Xavier Boussiron. The album comprises covers of various hits from the 50s, from Peggy Lee's Johnny Guitar to Adriano Celentano's Ciao Ragazzi. Also of note, Salvatore Adamo joins Mons to rejuvenate his original song, La Notte. Then, in November 2012, Mons reunited with the team from Walking to record \"Soon\", and then left for southern India, Mysore, Karnataka, to film \"American Diary\", \"My California\", and \"Mysore Express\". In 2016, she played Dominique in Alain Klingler's musical, \"Je n\u2019ai rien contre le r\u00e9veillon\". The same year, she released her eight album \" Alectrona \", in which she contrasted the codes of rock'n'roll with the classical form of chamber music. She wrote and composed 10 songs, which she then entrusted to Blixa Bargeld for production. ==Filmography == * 1999: The Passengers by Jean-Claude Guiguet * 1999: Nothing to do by Marion Vernoux * 2000: Tontaine and Tonton by Tonie Marshall (TV) * 2000: Drug Scenarios by Marion Vernoux ( Drugstore Segment ) * 2000: The Confusion of Genres by Ilan Duran Cohen * 2001: Art (delicate) of seduction by Richard Berry * 2001: On my lips by Jacques Audiard * 2002: My camera and me by Christophe Loizillon * 2002: La Mentale by Manuel Boursinhac * 2003: Motus directed by Laurence Ferreira Barbosa (TV) * 2003: It's easier for a camel ... by Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi * 2003: The Cost of Living by Philippe Le Guay * 2008: Sweet Valentine by Emma Luchini * 2012: Grand Evening of Gustave Kervern and Beno\u00eet Del\u00e9pine ==Discography== * 2001: Le Rock: Max et le rock (1 book + 1 audio CD), by Leigh Sauerwein, Laurent Corvaisier, Rodolphe Burger and Chlo\u00e9 Mons * 2002: Cantique des Cantiques, with Alain Bashung * 2006: La Ballade de Calamity Jane by Chlo\u00e9 Mons, Alain Bashung and Rodolphe Burger * 2006: Chienne d'un seul * 2009: Par la rivi\u00e8re * 2011: Walking * 2012: Il Buio with Xavier Boussiron * 2012: Soon * 2014: Alectrona ==External links== * ( In ) Chlo\u00e9 Mons [ archive ] on the Internet Movie Database * Official website [ archive ] * View and edit data on WikidataAuthority records : International Virtual Authority File \u2022 National Library of France ( data ) \u2022 University Documentation System Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century French actresses Category:21st-century French actresses Category:21st-century French singers Category:French film actresses ",
