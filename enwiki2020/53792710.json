London Jazz News 8 March 2014 Freestone likes to compose for unusual instrumentation that challenges traditional composition and improvisational techniques, most notably in her trio she explores the avenues of composing for a group that is led without a harmony instrument. Freestone features in many UK bands such as the Andre Canniere Sextet and Ivo Neame Quintet, but her main focus is on three projects: The Tori Freestone Trio, the Tori Freestone/ Alcyona Mick Duo and the sextet 'Solstice'. She has appeared at a number of UK Jazz Festivals including Manchester Jazz Festival in 2015 with a project with trumpeter Neil Yates and her duo with pianist Alcyona Mick.Slavid, Peter \"Festival review: Alcyona Mick/Tori Freestone\" London Jazz News 9 August 2015 More recently she appeared at The Barbican, London as part of a larger ensemble all-star band with Hermeto Pascoal.
