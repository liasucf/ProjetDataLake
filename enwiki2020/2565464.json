The other stadium is Est\u00e1dio Vila Ol\u00edmpica, currently being used for training. The stadium holds 20,000 people. It is named after Colonel Durival Britto e Silva, who was president of the RFFSA, the Brazilian Federal railroad company. ==History== It was built in 1947 as the home stadium of Clube Atl\u00e9tico Ferrovi\u00e1rio. The first match was played there on January 23 of that year, when Fluminense Football Club from Rio de Janeiro beat Clube Atl\u00e9tico Ferrovi\u00e1rio 5-1; the first goal scored by Fluminense's Careca. Est\u00e1dio Vila Capanema During many years Est\u00e1dio Vila Capanema was Curitiba's most modern and comfortable stadium with a capacity of 15,000 spectators. It was used for the 1950 FIFA World Cup games. On June 25, 1950, Spain beat the United States of America and in the 29th day of that month, Paraguay played against Sweden. Clube Atl\u00e9tico Ferrovi\u00e1rio ceased operation in 1971 and Vila Capanema became Paran\u00e1 Clube's home since the foundation of the club in 1989. In 2006, Est\u00e1dio Vila Capanema was modernized and Paran\u00e1 Clube opened the stadium again after four years. The capacity of the stadium was boosted to 20,083 fans. The American rock band Pearl Jam played at the stadium on November 9, 2011, as part of their 20th anniversary tour.
