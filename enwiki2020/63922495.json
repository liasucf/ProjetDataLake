After the war he began attending Boston University and joined both the baseball and hockey teams. In his senior season Bevins was named captain of the hockey team just in time for the program to return to varsity status. Bevins led the team to the 1950 NCAA Tournament and played a masterful game in net in the semifinal. BU defeated tournament favorite Michigan 4\u20133 with Bevins making 36 saves in the game. The team could not keep the same pace in the championship tilt, losing to Colorado College 4\u201313. Despite surrendering 13 goals, Bevins' performance in both games earned him the Tournament MOP. After graduating Bevins worked as an assistant football coach for Arlington High School until 1975 when he became the head coach. During this time he was also an instructor at a local ice hockey school. He retired from the Arlington school system and moved to St. Petersburg, Florida in 1987, the year that his wife Priscilla died. ==Honors== Bevins was inducted into the Boston University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1965. ==Awards and honors== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
