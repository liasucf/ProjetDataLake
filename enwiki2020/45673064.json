Church entrance An early work of the architect Arthur Blomfield, the church building, which is in stone, was erected between 1862 and 1864. It was built on farmland at the entrance of East Sheen Common. It was originally planned to be opened in April 1863; however, the tower collapsed shortly before completion and had to be rebuilt. The church was finally completed and consecrated nine months later, on 13 January 1864. The church has been Grade II listed with English Heritage since 1983. Mortlake Quiet Gardens are based around the landscaped churchyard and are affiliated to The Quiet Garden Trust. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Listing on Southwark Diocese website Category:1864 establishments in England Category:19th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Anglican congregations established in the 19th century East Sheen East Sheen Category:East Sheen Category:Gardens in religion Category:Grade II listed churches in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:Arthur Blomfield church buildings ",
