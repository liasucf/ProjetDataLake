    "text": "Hubert du Plessis (June 7, 1922 \u2013 March 12, 2011) was a South African composer, pianist, and professor of music whose career spanned several decades. Along with Arnold van Wyk and Stefans Grov\u00e9, du Plessis was one of the foremost South African composers of the 20th century. ==Biography== Hubert du Plessis was born to an Afrikaner family on a farm called Groenrivier in Malmesbury in the Western Cape on June 7, 1922. A musical prodigy from a young age, he began writing his own piano compositions by the time he was seven years old. In 1940 he enrolled in Stellenbosch University, becoming the first student at the university to graduate with a Bachelor of Music degree. In 1943 he briefly worked for the South African Broadcasting Company in Cape Town, but soon after accepted a position with the department of music at Rhodes University, where he became a lecturer. From 1951 to 1954, he studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, and upon his return to South Africa he accepted a teaching position at Stellenbosch University, quickly becoming senior lecturer of the music department. In 1963 he was honored for his musical contributions by the South African Academy of Science and Art (commonly known as Die Akademie). Du Plessis' compositions were varied and included both choral and instrumental pieces. He is noted for his contributions to both South African chamber music and orchestral music. Initially opposed to the idea, du Plessis included Afrikaans folk music in some of his later compositions. In the 1960s, he composed some nationalist works, which were endorsed by the National Party government, which he actively supported. He attributed his nationalistic music to a \"growing consciousness\" of his Afrikaner heritage, and therefore was not opposed to his music being used for political purposes. Despite the strict laws against homosexuality in Apartheid South Africa, du Plessis was spared public disgrace and legal troubles by the government, and lived unashamedly as an outspoken and openly gay man. He appeared in front of the South African Parliament to campaign against tightening of anti-homosexuality laws in the late 1960s.James May (2011) Obituary \u2013 Hubert du Plessis, Journal of the Musical Arts in Africa, 8:1, 115-116, DOI: 10.2989/18121004.2011.652401 He died at his home in Stellenbosch on March 12, 2011 at the age of 88. ==Works by genre== === Piano === * Vier klavierstukke, op. 1, 1944-1945 (1.
