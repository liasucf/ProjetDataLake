    "text": "The asor ( \u02bfasor; from \u05e2\u05e9\u05e8 e\u015ber, meaning \"ten\") was a musical instrument \"of ten strings\" mentioned in the Bible. There is little agreement on what sort of instrument it was or to what instruments it had similarities. ==Biblical references== The word occurs only three times in the Bible, and has not been traced elsewhere. In Psalm 33:2 the reference is to \"kinnor, nebel and asor\" (); in Psalm 92:3, to \"nebel and asor\"; in Psalm 144 to \"nebel-asor\". In the King James Version asor is translated \"an instrument of ten strings\", with a marginal note \"omit\" applied to \"instrument\". In the Septuagint, the word being derived from a root signifying \"ten\", the Greek is \u1f10\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u1ff7 or \u03c8\u03b1\u03bb\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd, in the Vulgate in decachordo psalterio. Each time the word asor is used it follows the word nebel, and probably merely indicates a variant of the nebel, having ten strings instead of the customary twelve assigned to it by Josephus. cites Antiquities, vii. 12. 3. ==Bibliography== * Hermann Mendel and August Reissmann, Musikalisches Conversations-Lexikon, vol. 1 (Berlin, 1881) * Sir John Stainer, The Music of the Bible, * Forkel, Allgemeine Geschichte der Musik, vol.1 (Leipzig, 1788). ==See also== * Psaltery ==Notes== ==References== ;Attribution * Category:String instruments Category:Lost and extinct musical instruments Category:Ancient Israel and Judah Category:Israeli musical instruments Category:Ancient Hebrew musical instruments he:\u05db\u05dc\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0#\u05e0\u05d1\u05dc ",
