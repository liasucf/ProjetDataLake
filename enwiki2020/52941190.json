    "text": "Trad Arr Jones is a tribute album to Nic Jones by British-American folk singer John Wesley Harding. The album consists of Harding's covers of Jones' arrangements of eleven traditional songs, hence the album's title, which is short for \"Traditional, Arranged by Jones\". It is very different from Harding's previous albums, partly because Harding used to dislike English folk music like Jones'. ==Track listing== #The Singer's Request #Little Musgrave #The Golden Glove #Annachie Gordon #The Flandyke Shore #William And Nancy's Parting #William Glenn #The Bonny Bunch Of Roses #Master Kilby #Annan Water #Isle Of France ==Personnel== *Kurt Bloch \u2013 Bass, Engineer, Guest Artist, Guitar (Electric), Mixing, Producer *Dave Fisher \u2013 Engineer, Mixing *Hammi \u2013 Design *John Wesley Harding \u2013 Guitar (Acoustic), Liner Notes, Mixing, Primary Artist, Vocals *Shelley Jackson \u2013 Paintings, Photography *Nic Jones \u2013 Arranger *Mike Musburger \u2013 Drums *Jason Staczek \u2013 Accordion, Harpsichord, Organ (Hammond), Piano *Paul Stubblebine \u2013 Mastering, Remastering ==References== Category:1999 albums Category:John Wesley Harding (singer) albums Category:Tribute albums Category:Covers albums Category:Zero Hour Records albums ",
