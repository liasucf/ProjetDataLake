    "text": "Tuam Golf Club is a parkland course located in Tuam, County Galway. Founded in 1904, it has been an affiliated member of the Golfing Union of Ireland since 1940. ==History== The origins of golf in Tuam go back to the early 1900s when two local businessmen holidayed in the town of Harrogate in England. There they became acquainted with the game, purchased clubs and balls and brought them back to Tuam. Initially located in the townland of Cloonascragh (on land owned by one of the two businessmen), Tuam Golf Club opened in 1904 with 60 members. In 1937 it relocated to the lands of the Kilgarriff family at Mayfield. In 1948 Christy O'Connor Snr came to the club as a professional, and gave local golf lessons. In 1975 the club moved to its current location at Barnacurragh, with the course designed by Eddie Hackett. In 1991 a new clubhouse was constructed, with bar, restaurant, changing rooms and a pro- shop. Improvement works continued over the years with Christy O'Connor Jnr advising the club. Other development work undertaken between 2007 and 2009 was under the guidance of golf architect Ken Kearney. Tuam Golf Club granted full membership to lady members in 1992 and in 2004 allowed Category 1 lady members compete for the Gents President's Prize. Tuam Golf Club has hosted several championship events over the years, including the Connacht GUI Club finals, and The Irish Open Boys Championship. ==Course== The course is Par 72, measuring 6138 meters, with most fairways being tree lined, with water features on three holes. The feature hole is the Par 3 15th hole, which is played from an elevated tee, over water to a sloping green. The resident PGA Professional is Tom Niland. == Club Honours== * Junior Cup - Connacht Winners : 1998 * Jimmy Bruen Shield - Connacht Winners : 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 2007, 2018 * Pierce Purcell Shield - Connacht Winners : 1979, 1995, 1996 * Connacht Shield - Connacht Winners : 1956, 1986, 1996 * Cecil Ewing Shield - Connacht Winners : 1983, 1995, 2015 * Jimmy Carroll Cup - All-Ireland Winners : 2006 * JB Carr Tournament - All-Ireland Winners : 2007 * Miele Ladies Interclub Fourball - All-Ireland Finalist : 2014 * Mary McKenna Diamond Trophy - Connacht Winners : 2016, 2017 * Kenny Cup - Connacht Winners : 2015, 2017, 2018 * Under 16 Interclub Competition - Connacht Winners : 2018 ==References== ==External links== *Tuam Golf Club Official Club Website Category:Golf clubs and courses in the Republic of Ireland Category:Golf in Connacht Category:Sport in Tuam Category:Sports clubs in County Galway Category:Sports venues in County Galway Category:Sports venues completed in 1904 Category:1904 establishments in Ireland ",
