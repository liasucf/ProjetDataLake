    "text": "Club Atl\u00e9tico Chacarita Juniors (usually known simply as Chacarita) is an Argentine football club headquartered in Villa Crespo, Buenos Aires, while the stadium is located in Villa Maip\u00fa, General San Mart\u00edn Partido of Gran Buenos Aires. The squad currently plays at Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n, the top division of the Argentine football league system. ==History== Divisi\u00f3n Intermedia title. Torneo Metropolitano champions. The club was founded on 1 May 1906, in an anarchist LibraryZmag.org on the boundary between the Villa Crespo and Chacarita neighbourhoods. After a short period of institutional crisis, the club was re-opened in 1919. The football squad promoted to Primera Divisi\u00f3n in 1924, and continued playing at the top level after football became professional in 1931. In 1940 Chacarita was relegated to the second division, but it lasted only one season. The team then moved to the General San Mart\u00edn Partido in Greater Buenos Aires, next to the autonomous city of Buenos Aires. In 1956 Chacarita was relegated to the second division again, and won that championship the following year returning to Primera Divisi\u00f3n. After 10 consecutive years at the top level, Chacarita won its only first division title, the 1969 Metropolitano championship. In the following years the team performed badly and was relegated all the way down to the 3rd division in 1980. In 1984 Chacarita came back to the first division, but because of Hooliganism by some of its fans, the club was punished with a suspension for a month and a loss of 10 points; having missing those points, Chacarita couldn't avoid a new relegation to the second division. After a long tenure in lower divisions (including the Primera C), Chacarita came back to the top division in 1999, where the team remained until 2004 Torneo Clausura, when it was relegated to the Primera B Nacional. In the 2008\u201309 season the club finished 2nd, after a 1\u20130 victory against Platense, with a goal scored in the last seconds of the match. This victory secured Chacarita a return to Primera Divisi\u00f3n after five years of being relegated. At the end of 2011\u201312 season, Chacarita finished 20th and therefore the Funebreros had to play two matches against Nueva Chicago (winner of Primera B Metropolitana's Torneo Reducido) to avoid being relegated to the lower division. Nueva Chicago won the series (1\u20130 and 1\u20131) and Chacarita was subsequently relegated.\"En un final para el infarto, Chicago se qued\u00f3 con el ascenso y conden\u00f3 a Chacarita\" , Clar\u00edn, 30 June 2012 ==Kit evolution== {| | | | |} (1) Used during the 1931 championship as a tribute to club's first jersey.El Nacimiento de una Pasi\u00f3n: Historia de los Clubes de F\u00fatbol, Alejandro Fabbri, editorial Capital Intelectual (2006) \u2013 ==Nickname== The team got the nickname of Funebreros (\"Undertakers\") because its ground was near the La Chacarita Cemetery. The red color in its jersey (apart from black and white) is a reference to its anarchist origins. ==Stadium== Estadio Chacarita Juniors. Chacarita's stadium was reopened on 30 January 2011, after its closure for a total rebuilt (which consisted in replacing the old wood seats for the more modern cement structures, according to safety regulations) since May 2008. As part of the celebration for the reopening, the club organized a friendly match between Chacarita and Argentinos Juniors (which ended 0\u20130). For this special event only 13,260 seats were available. Once the remodelling is totally finished, the stadium will be able to host an attendance of 35,000.Chacarita anuncia inauguraci\u00f3n del nuevo estadio The Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Daniel Scioli, was the most notable presence in the event and was the person who cut the ribbon to declare the stadium officially reopened. This act was made in front of the Isaac L\u00f3pez stand, named as a tribute to the legendary goalkeeper who played the most games for Chacarita (343 matches, from 1937 to 1952).Aniversario del fallecimiento de Isaac L\u00f3pez Finally, a colorful set of fireworks closed the ceremony in Villa Maip\u00fa.Chacarita estren\u00f3 su nuevo estadio The new stadium was erected in the same location where the old one was, in the Villa Maip\u00fa neighborhood, General San Mart\u00edn Partido. The last game played by Chacarita before the remodelling had been on 21 October 2005, during a match for the Primera B Nacional championship.
