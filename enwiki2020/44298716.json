On 22 June 2005, Judge Michael Higgins of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal delivered his final verdict on the religious vilification issue regarding remedies. He found that financial compensation would be inappropriate, but ordered Nalliah and Scot to take out newspaper advertisements to the value of $68,690 which summarised the findings in the case. Nalliah criticised the ruling, comparing the legislation to \"sharia law by stealth\". He also said that he would rather go to jail than comply with the ruling. Lawyers for the defendants had previously appealed to the Supreme Court of Victoria, in an Originating Motion alleging that Higgins showed signs of bias, that there were errors in the decision, and that the act itself was unconstitutional. Following the decision, an appeal was lodged with the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court and the originating motion was dropped. The appeal was heard in August 2006. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, an interfaith public interest law firm based in Washington DC, had intervened on Pastor Scot's behalf, engaging in discussion with the Attorney General of Australia, providing legal representation with local counsel, and providing legal arguments employed for the legal appeal. On 14 December 2006, the Supreme Court of Victoria, upheld the appeal and ordered that the matter be re-decided, without hearing new evidence, by a judge (other than Judge Higgins) of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.Court of Appeal (Supreme Court of Victoria) decision Dec 2006 - overturning VCAT decision The Islamic Council of Victoria was ordered to pay half of Scot's and Nalliah's legal costs of the appeal. ==Use of religious authorities== Imam Sheikh Abdi Nur Weli serves as the organisation's \"in-house Imam\" and religious services coordinator.
