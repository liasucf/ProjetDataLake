    "text": "Joaquim Machado de Castro (19 June 1731 - 17 November 1822) was one of Portugal's foremost sculptors. He wrote extensively on his works and the theory behind them, including a full-length discussion of the statue of King Joseph I entitled Descrip\u00e7\u00e3o analytica da execu\u00e7\u00e3o da estatua equestre, Lisbon 1810. == Life == Machado de Castro was born in Coimbra, and was a celebrated figure throughout Europe in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The Descrip\u00e7\u00e3o is the artist's detailed comments on the style and execution of his finest work, the equestrian statue of D. Jos\u00e9 I, erected in 1775 as part of the rebuilding of central Lisbon after the disastrous earthquake of 1755. The stages of construction are illustrated with sections and cross-sections of the horse and rider, views of the statue from different angles, and details of armor and ornamentation. This bronze statue remains one of Lisbon's most important monuments, and dominates one of the major squares of Europe, the Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio or Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o. In the introduction, Machado de Castro comments on similar works of art in the rest of Europe. Machado de Castro had a famous school and was the Master of many sculptors. He died in Lisbon. In Coimbra there is a prestigious art museum named in his honour, the Machado de Castro National Museum. ==External links== Category:1731 births Category:1822 deaths Category:Portuguese sculptors Category:People from Coimbra Category:18th-century Portuguese people Category:19th-century Portuguese people Category:19th-century sculptors ",
