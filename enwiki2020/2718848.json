    "text": "is an anime OVA series planned, drafted and designed by manga artist K\u014dsuke Fujishima. It is produced by Bandai Visual, Dentsu, Genco, Faith and Actas. The anime series spanned 6 episodes, as well as a feature movie, entitled \u00e9X- Driver: The Movie. The complete anime series, including the movie, were broadcast by the anime television network, Animax, across its respective networks around the world, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and other regions. ==Overview== In the distant future people no longer drive cars themselves, instead relying on AI (artificial intelligence) computers to drive their cars for them. But when these AI systems start losing control and running wild somebody has to stop them. \u00e9X-Drivers are the people who are able to operate the older mechanical non-AI dependent cars who chase down the AI cars and stop them. A good amount of future and near future technology is featured throughout the series, including automated highway systems and A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) technology. Automated highway systems have been proposed as a solution to the traffic congestion problems. In the series, anybody, regardless of age, can be an \u00e9X-Driver as long as they possess the required skills. For example, one of the main characters is only 13 years old and drives. The premise of the show is that there are \u00e9X-Drivers all over the world but the focus is on the team operating in Japan. Cars used by \u00e9X-Drivers are marked with an \u00e9X-D decal. Typically an \u00e9X-Driver car would be an older mechanical type car and almost always would be rear-wheel drive with the exception of an AWD (4WD) Subaru Impreza WRC since \u00e9X-Drivers usually employ techniques such as drifting when bringing down runaway cars, which is much more difficult with front wheel drive (FWD) cars and in an all wheel drive (AWD) car. ==Characters== ; :Japanese voice actor: Yoko Asada :English voice actor: Philece Sampler :Cantonese voice actor: Celina Lam :Lisa's \u00e9x-Driver partner. She is a good-hearted girl who drives a Lotus Europa. She also tries to keep the team together when S\u014dichi and Lisa have an initial tense relationship.

In relationship to S\u014dichi, she acts like a sister. ; :Japanese voice actor: Miki Nagasawa :English voice actor: Lia Sargent :Cantonese voice actor: Doris Lo :Lorna's \u00e9x-Driver partner. She drives a Subaru Impreza WRC in the first episode, but it is wrecked and has to be replaced with a Group 4 specification Lancia Stratos HF from the second episode onwards. She shuns S\u014dichi when he is selected to lead the team and also when he beats her in race. However, Lisa accepts him as the series progresses. ; :Japanese voice actor: Yumiko Kobayashi :English voice actor: Joshua Seth :Cantonese voice actor: Judy Lui :An extremely talented 12-year-old. He drives a Caterham Super Seven JPE, though he drives a modified Daihatsu Midget II on a racetrack. He soon becomes the team's leader. He initially has a tense relationship with Lisa, but they begin to gain their trust as the series progresses. ==OVA== The OVA series consists of 6 episodes which are - except the last two - independent from each other. # AI vs RECIPRO # On And On # No Problem # Regulations of Love (\u00e9X- Rider) # Crossroads # The Last Mile ==Movie== The \u00e9X-Driver anime series was also adapted into an anime movie sequel, entitled \u00e9X-Driver The Movie, which follows the adventures of Lisa, Lorna and Souichi as they participate in an international \u00e9X-Driver race held at Los Angeles. The movie also consisted of a special prequel to the series, entitled, \u00e9X-Driver - Nina & Rei Danger Zone, which served as the prologue for the movie, centering on the adventures of two of the former \u00e9X-Drivers, Nina Thunder and Rei Kazama. Three short bonus shorts were also featured with the movie, featuring Lisa, Lorna and Souichi in events set just before where the movie takes off. These bonus shorts are done in comedic style, mainly with camera pans and zooms on still images: #Onsen\u2014set in a hot spring #Race Queen\u2014set in the \u00e9X-Driver Base #Airport\u2014set in the Airport on their way to Los Angeles ==Staff== *Planning, original creator, original character concept: K\u014dsuke Fujishima *Series composition and script: Shinjo Fujita *\u00e9X-Car design: Shunji Murata *Mecha design: Takeshi Takakura, Hidefumi Kimura (ep.1) *Music: JAM Project, Hikaru Nanase *Director: Jun Kawagoe ==External links== * * * * Category:2000 anime OVAs Category:2002 anime films Category:Japanese films Category:2002 anime OVAs Category:Japanese auto racing films Category:Animated films about auto racing Category:Actas Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:Anime Works Category:Bandai Namco franchises Category:Geneon USA Category:K\u014dsuke Fujishima Category:Fictional motorsports in anime and manga Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Films directed by Akira Nishimori ",
