    "text": "The 2011 BYU Cougars football team represented Brigham Young University in the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Cougars, led by head coach Bronco Mendenhall, played their home games at LaVell Edwards Stadium. This was the first year they competed as an independent in football. They finished the season 10\u20133 and were invited to the Armed Forces Bowl where they defeated Tulsa 24\u201321. ==2011 media== The school announced that the annual BYU Football Media days would be July 12, 2011 and would be broadcast live on BYUtv. Special question and answer segments with current players and BYU Hall of Famers would take place throughout the day on BYUtv.org. Having no other sports to broadcast that day, ESPN announced they would simulcast two of the events live on ESPN3. All games will be broadcast on KSL 102.7 FM and 1160 AM, on the internet at KSL.com, and through the various BYU Cougars sport network affiliates. Additionally BYUtv will broadcast a one-hour pregame show live (called Countdown to Kickoff and hosted by Dave McCann, Alema Harrington, and David Nixon) followed by a Post-game Show with Interviews from players and coaches about the games outcome. The Bronco Mendenhall Monday Press Conference will be shown live every Monday on www.byutv.org (live events link) instead of the actual BYUtv Channel. BYUtv Sports will also be able to provide their own announcers for the BYUtv Gameday Replay of all home games with Dave McCann doing play-by-play, Gary Sheide or Blaine Fowler doing color commentary, and Robbie Bullough or Jarom Jordan doing sideline reporting. ===BYU Radio Sports Network Affiliates=== KSL 102.7 FM and 1160 AM- Flagship Station (Salt Lake City/ Provo, UT and ksl.com) BYU Radio- Nationwide (Dish Network 980, Sirius XM 143, and byuradio.org) KIDO- Boise, ID [football only] KTHK- Blackfoot/ Idaho Falls/ Pocatello/ Rexburg, ID KMGR- Manti, UT KSUB- Cedar City, UT KDXU- St. George, UT KSHP- Las Vegas, NV [football only] KNZZ- Grand Junction, CO [football only] ==Schedule== ==Roster== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- | colspan=11 style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background:#002654; text-align: center\"| 2011 BYU Cougars |- |valign=\"top\"| Quarterbacks *3 James Lark \u2013 Junior *7 Alex Kuresa \u2013 Freshman *9 Jake Heaps \u2013 Sophomore *12 Jason Munns \u2013 Sophomore *13 Riley Nelson \u2013 Junior Running Backs *5 Iona Pritchard \u2013 Sophomore *10 JJ Di Luigi \u2013 Senior *20 Josh Quezada \u2013 Sophomore *22 Adam Hine \u2013 Freshman *27 David Foote \u2013 Junior *30 Ryan Folsom \u2013 Sophomore *32 Nate Carter \u2013 Freshman *33 Bryan Kariya \u2013 Senior *35 Zed Mendenhall \u2013 Junior *41 Austin Heder \u2013 Freshman *42 Michael Alisa \u2013 Sophomore Offensive Line *50 Ryan Freeman \u2013 Junior *54 Blair Tushaus \u2013 Freshman *57 Famika Anae \u2013 Freshman *60 Terence Brown \u2013 Senior *62 Marco Thorson \u2013 Senior *64 Terrance Motley \u2013 Freshman *66 Manu Mulitalo \u2013 Freshman *67 Quinn Lawlor \u2013 Freshman *68 Austin Nielsen \u2013 Junior *70 Matt Reynolds \u2013 Senior *72 Ryker Mathews \u2013 Freshman *73 Solomone Kafu \u2013 Freshman *74 Brock Stringham \u2013 Freshman *75 Braden Brown \u2013 Junior *76 Braden Hansen \u2013 Junior *77 Michael Yeck \u2013 Freshman *78 Houston Reynolds \u2013 Sophomore *79 Manaaki Vaitai \u2013 Sophomore * Devon Smith \u2013 Freshman Coaches * Bronco Mendenhall \u2013 Head Coach/ Defensive Coordinator * Lance Reynolds \u2013 Asst.

Rivals.com named OT Matt Reynolds as No. 24 on their top 100 countdown in 2011. Reynolds would later be named on ESPN's Pre-Season All-American team. At the Utah State game, Brandon Doman proposed benching Heaps and seeing what Riley Nelson could do. Nelson rallied the Cougars to beat the Aggies and would become the starting QB for every game he was healthy in the rest of the season. Nelson would go on to win 4 FBS Independent Player of the Week awards. BYU decided to add running back Michael Alisa to their running back rotation at homecoming. Alisa would become the starting RB for the rest of the season after going for 91 yards on 16 carries. Matt Putnam was ruled eligible for the Cougars starting in October and became one of the many linebacker beasts. On November 7, Bronco Mendenhall announced that senior Jordan Pendleton would have season ending knee surgery. As a tribute for his teammates play and attitude, Kyle Van Noy would wear his number at senior night. Pendleton won two FBS Independent defensive player of the week awards during his senior season. On December 5, Jake Heaps announced he would transfer after the semester ended. James Lark would resume the backup QB role for the bowl game and for the 2012 season. It was later announced he would transfer to Kansas. ==Sources== *http://www.byucougars.com/Schedule.jsp?SP=130 BYU Cougars Category:BYU Cougars football seasons Category:Armed Forces Bowl champion seasons Category:2011 in sports in Utah ",
