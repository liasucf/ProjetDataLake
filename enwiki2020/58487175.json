Her father ran a trucking company out of the family home and her mother worked as a real estate agent. She worked as an executive assistant to Chet Collier at CNBC before moving with Collier to Fox News at its inception in 1996. She began her work there as a programming assistant. According to a Fox News Channel press release, \"Throughout her tenure at Fox News, Scott has risen through the ranks in a number of programming, production and creative positions including: executive vice president of programming (2016); senior vice president of programming and development (2009); vice president of programming (2007); network executive producer (2005); as well as associate producer, producer and senior producer of On the Record with Greta Van Susteren (2002-2005). In addition, she was responsible for the launch of numerous on-air and digital initiatives, including the 2002 primetime debut of On the Record.\" After founder & former CEO Roger Ailes departed in 2016 before he died in 2017, Scott, Jay Wallace, and Jack Abernathy are credited with \u201cturning Fox News around\u201d after the scandal involving Roger. In that time, Scott worked as the president of programming, overseeing Fox News Channel's opinion shows including Fox & Friends, The Five and Hannity. On May 17, 2018, Scott was named CEO of both Fox News and Fox Business Network. During this announcement, Lachlan Murdoch said Scott \u201chas now made history as [Fox\u2019s] first female CEO.\u201d She is also the only woman in charge of a major TV news organization. This decision has been met with some media backlash due to Scott's alleged complicity in several sexual harassment suits within the company. Scott was not a defendant in the suits, but was cited within them, and was involved in several internal complaints. She denies the accusations. ==References== Category:American chief executives in the media industry Category:Fox Broadcasting Company executives Category:Women television executives Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American women chief executives Category:American University alumni ",
