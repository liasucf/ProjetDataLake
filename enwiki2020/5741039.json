    "text": "Weinbach is a community in Limburg-Weilburg district in Hesse, Germany. == Geography == === Location === Weinbach lies on the Lahn and the Weil between Wetzlar and Limburg an der Lahn. === Neighbouring communities === Weinbach borders in the north on the town of Weilburg, in the east on the community of Weilm\u00fcnster, and in the west on the community of Villmar and the town of Runkel (all in Limburg-Weilburg). === Constituent communities === Weinbach is made up of eight Ortsteile. The main centre is also called Weinbach, and the outlying centres are Blessenbach, Edelsberg, Elkerhausen, Freienfels, F\u00fcrfurt, Gr\u00e4veneck and Kleinweinbach. == History == F\u00fcrfurt was mentioned in a document from sometime between 1148 and 1154, thus making it the first part of the community to have its first documentary mention. Elkerhausen\u2019s first documentary mention came in 1191. The knightly family who lived there was heavily involved in a feud in the 14th century with the landlord, the Archbishop of Trier. The Elkerhauser Wasserburg (a moated castle) was destroyed in 1352. About 1500, there arose a stronghouse out of which a new castle grew. Edelsberg had its first documentary mention in 1246, Blessenbach in 1267 and Weinbach in 1344. Freienfels Castle was built about 1300, presumably by the Diez family\u2019s Weilnau branch. In 1327 it had its first documentary mention. Gr\u00e4veneck Castle was built in 1395 by a knightly order under Nassau\u2019s leadership to guard against the Knights of Elkerhausen. Weinbach - Evangelical church Today\u2019s Evangelical church in Weinbach arose in 1728; the forerunner church\u2019s Early Gothic quire was incorporated into this newer church. The history of the greater community of Weinbach began in 1970 when the formerly self-administering communities of Weinbach, Blessenbach, Freienfels and Gr\u00e4veneck amalgamated in the course of municipal restructuring in Hesse. In 1974, the communities of Elkerhausen, F\u00fcrfurt and Edelsberg were also merged into the greater community. == Politics == The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results: {| class=\"wikitable\" |--- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\" |colspan=\"2\" | Parties and voter communities |align=\"center\" | % 2006 |align=\"center\" | Seats 2006 |align=\"center\" | % 2001 |align=\"center\" | Seats 2001 |---- |CDU |Christian Democratic Union of Germany |align=\"right\" |29.5 |align=\"right\" |4 |align=\"right\" |27.5 |align=\"right\" |6 |---- |SPD |Social Democratic Party of Germany |align=\"right\" |43.7 |align=\"right\" |7 |align=\"right\" |48.8 |align=\"right\" |11 |---- | GREENS | B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen |align=\"right\" |5.5 |align=\"right\" |1 |align=\"right\" |3.6 |align=\"right\" |1 |---- | FWG | Freie W\u00e4hlergemeinschaft Weinbach |align=\"right\" |21.3 |align=\"right\" |3 |align=\"right\" |20.1 |align=\"right\" |5 |--- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\" |colspan=\"2\" |Total |align=\"right\" |100.0 |align=\"right\" |15 |align=\"right\" |100.0 |align=\"right\" |23 |--- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\" |colspan=\"2\" |Voter turnout in % |colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |52.4 |colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |60.3 |} === Town partnerships === Weinbach has maintained a partnership arrangement with the Polish community of Debrzno, roughly 150 km southwest of Gda\u0144sk in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, since 1992.
