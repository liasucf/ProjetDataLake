    "text": "Gun is an undistinguished hill at the southern end of the Peak District. The hill is mainly moorland with some small wooded areas. Gun is often overlooked by walkers who prefer the neighbouring peaks of The Roaches, Hen Cloud and Ramshaw rocks. However it still features typical moorland scenery and some pleasant hill walking. The hill overlooks the town of Leek in the Staffordshire Moorlands which is an ideal base for visiting the Peak District National Park.Kent, Jeff, Staffordshire's 1,000-Foot Peaks, Witan Books, 2013, . The hill often features in the itinerary of the Tour of Britain cycle race. Gun has the Summits on the Air reference G/SP-013. ==References== Category:Climbs in cycle racing in the United Kingdom Category:Marilyns of England Category:Mountains and hills of the Peak District Category:Hills of Staffordshire ",
