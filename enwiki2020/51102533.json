They arrived in 1914 to Ottoman Israel and worked in printing in Jaffa. During World War I in 1917, they were deported from Tel Aviv with all other foreign nationals, especially nationals of Greece, a state enemy of Turkey. They were persecuted, and sent with hundreds of other Jews to Hama in Syria, and then to Istanbul. After the war, they returned to Israel and set up a stationery store in Jaffa, and another on Nahalat Binyamin Street in Tel Aviv, later moving to Herzl Street. They were importers of products from the Parker Pen Company, including ink, fountain pen types, and other accessories. At the same time, they opened a publishing house printing postcards of Israel. The images of the postcards included: the Wailing Wall, Rachel's Tomb, new Zionist settlements\u2014such as Petah Tikva, Hadera, and Degania Kibbutz Ein Harod\u2014and cities such as Jerusalem and Haifa. Half of the images concerned Tel Aviv and streets such as Herzl, Nordau, Sokolov, Ahad Ha'am, Bialik, Dizengoff, Rothschild, and Trumpeldor. Others were about prominent leaders like Chaim Weizmann and Ze'ev Jabotinsky. file:PikiWiki Israel 4801 Dead sea shipments.jpg|Camel and boat on the shore of the Dead Sea file:Rachels Grab.JPG|Rachel's Tomb File:PikiWiki Israel 41465 Tel Aviv.jpg|Announcement of the Sabbath in Tel Aviv File:PikiWiki Israel 45653 Rotshild Boulevard.jpg|Rotshild Boulevard at Tel Aviv Category:Postcard publishers ",
