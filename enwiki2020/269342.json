Its territory lay in the historical Cri\u0219ana region. After the administrative unification law in 1925, the name of the county remained as it was, but the territory was reorganized. It was bordered on the northwest by Hungary, on the north by Czechoslovakia, to the east by Maramure\u0219 County, to the southeast by Some\u0219 County, and to the south and southwest by S\u0103laj County. Currently, its territory is included in the current counties of Satu Mare and Maramure\u0219. ===Administration=== Map of Satu Mare County as constituted in 1938. In 1930, the county was divided into eight districts (pl\u0103\u1e63i):Portretul Rom\u00e2niei Interbelice - Jude\u021bul Satu Mare #Plasa Arded (headquartered at Arded) #Plasa Baia Mare (headquartered at Baia Mare) #Plasa M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur (headquartered at M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur) #Plasa Oa\u0219iu (headquartered at Oa\u0219iu) #Plasa Satu Mare (headquartered at Satu Mare) #Plasa Seini (headquartered at Seini) #Plasa \u0218omcuta Mare (headquartered at \u0218omcuta Mare) #Plasa Ugocea (headquartered at Ugocea) The county included the city of Satu Mare (the county seat) and the urban communes Baia Mare and Baia Sprie. ===History=== Prior to World War I, the territory of the county belonged to Austria-Hungary and mostly was contained in the Szatm\u00e1r County of the Kingdom of Hungary. The territory of Satu Mare County was transferred to Romania from Hungary as successor state to Austria-Hungary in 1920 under the Treaty of Trianon. In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. 10 \u021binuturi (approximate translation: \"lands\") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by reziden\u021bi regali (approximate translation: \"Royal Residents\") - appointed directly by the King - instead of the prefects. Satu Mare County became part of \u021ainutul Cri\u0219uri. In 1940, the county was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of Northern Transylvania under the Second Vienna Award. Beginning in 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. The county was disestablished by the communist government of Romania in 1950, and re-established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system. === Population === According to the 1930 census data, the county population was 294,875, 60.5% Romanians, 25.2% Hungarians, 8.1% Jews, 3.2% Germans, as well as other minorities.Recens\u0103m\u00e2ntul general al popula\u021biei Rom\u00e2niei din 29 decemvrie 1930, Vol. II, pag. 394-401 From a religious point of view, the population consisted of 59.0% Greek Catholics, 15.0% Roman Catholics, 8.6% Jewish, 4.4% Eastern Orthodox, as well as other minorities.Recens\u0103m\u00e2ntul general al popula\u021biei Rom\u00e2niei din 29 decemvrie 1930, Vol. II, pag. 718-721 ==== Urban population ==== In 1930, the county's urban population was 69,526 inhabitants, 41.9% Hungarians, 35.0% Romanians, 18.6% Jews, 1.6% Germans, as well as other minorities.
