    "text": "Brian Bennett, Bruce Welch and Warren Bennett at a concert in Brussels in 2005 Brian Laurence Bennett, (born 9 February 1940 in Palmers Green, North London, England) is an English drummer, pianist, composer and producer of popular music. He is best known as the drummer of the UK rock and roll group The Shadows. He is father of musician and Shadows band member Warren Bennett. ==Biography== Educated at Hazlewood Lane School, Palmers Green, London and Winchmore Council School, he finished school at the age of sixteen to play drums in a Ramsgate skiffle group performing for holiday makers. After returning to London he became the in-house drummer at The 2i's Coffee Bar in Soho and was a regular performer on Jack Good's TV show Oh Boy! He then became a member of Marty Wilde's Wildcats in 1959. After a successful period with the Wildcats, during which he appeared on their instrumental record without Wilde (recorded as the Krew Kats), \"Trambone\", he backed Tommy Steele for some of his London stage performances, and then in October 1961 he joined Cliff Richard and the Shadows as the replacement for Tony Meehan. In 1967, Bennett released a solo album of jazz music, entitled Change of Direction, in mono and stereo (neither charted). This was the first solo album by a member of the Shadows. In the 1970s, music by Bennett was selected for several Radley Metzger films, including Barbara Broadcast and The Opening of Misty Beethoven. He stayed with the group throughout all of their subsequent line-ups, and in May 2005 took part in the Shadows' European tour. During a show in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland he sustained what was thought to be a minor injury to a finger. A splinter from a drumstick pierced under his fingernail on his right hand, he removed it with a pair of old pliers and applied a plaster. A few days later after arriving in Paris, France he was in so much pain he called a doctor. The doctor diagnosed a bad infection and recommended Bennett go to hospital immediately. Thinking it would be a short visit he attended only to find out that it would involve a minor, but very painful, operation to remove the poison. He was due to be playing on stage that evening and had already missed the soundcheck. He arrived at the theatre 15 minutes before the show with his right-hand bandaged and still numb from the anaesthetic. He managed to play for the whole show using an altered playing style. In addition to his work with the Shadows he has also appeared in Cliff Richard's backing band and plays piano and occasionally vibraphone. He has composed many popular TV theme tunes including BBC sports themes such as Rugby Special (\"Holy Mackerel\") and BBC Golf (\"Chase Side Shoot Up\"), Channel 9 Australia's cricket theme (\"New Horizons\"), the sitcoms Robin's Nest and Birds of a Feather, The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, Pulaski, Square Deal, Close to Home, Murder in Mind and, with his son Warren, composed and played the incidental music in New Tricks. Two of his most famous works were \"The Journey\" and \"Just a Minute\" written under the alias James Aldenham and used for the ITV Schools on 4 broadcasts between 1987\u20131993. He scored the British-German film The Harpist in 1999. He is also an orchestral conductor, having learned how to arrange and conduct music for orchestras from a correspondence course. His son Warren Bennett formerly played keyboards for the band Glass Ties, and is also a composer and producer. ==Honours == He was appointed OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to music. Bennett runs a home recording studio, Honeyhill studios, in Radlett, Hertfordshire. In November 2009, at the age of 69, Bennett completed a 50th Anniversary reunion world tour with Cliff Richard and the Shadows. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Brian Bennett \u2013 Change of Direction \u2013 LP/CD \u2013 Columbia/see4Miles. *Brian Bennett \u2013 Illustrated London Noise \u2013 LP/CD \u2013 Columbia/see4Miles \u2013 1969. *Collage \u2013 Misty \u2013 - LP/CD \u2013 DJM/see4Miles. *Brian Bennett Band \u2013 Rock Dreams \u2013 LP/CD \u2013 DJM/see4Miles \u2013 1977. *Brian Bennett Band \u2013 Voyage (A Journey Into Discoid Funk) \u2013 LP/CD \u2013 DJM/see4Miles \u2013 1978. *Heat Exchange \u2013 One step ahead \u2013 LP/CD \u2013 EMI/see4Miles. *Ruth Rendell Mysteries \u2013 LP/CD. *Ruth Rendell Mysteries (volume.2) \u2013 LP/CD. *Ruth Rendell Mysteries (Wexford) \u2013 LP/CD. *Drumtrax (house library. ) \u2013 CD. *Nomads of the wind \u2013 CD. *Global sunrise \u2013 CD. *The Works \u2013 (Box set of 4CDs). *Greatest Guitar hits (volume 1) \u2013 CD. *Greatest Guitar hits (volume 2) \u2013 CD. *Living Britain \u2013 CD. *Official Bootleg album \u2013 CD. ===Singles=== *Canvas/Slippery Jim De Grize \u2013 7\" \u2013 DB 8294 \u2013 Columbia. *Ridin The Gravy Train/Bubble Drum (Thunder company) \u2013 7\" \u2013 DB 8706 *Chase side shoot up/Pegasus \u2013 7\" \u2013 6007040 *Thunderbolt/Clearing skies \u2013 7\" \u2013 DJS10714 *Saturday night special/Farewell to a friend \u2013 7\" \u2013 DJS10756 *Girls back home/Jonty Jump \u2013 7\" \u2013 DJS10791 *Pendulum force/Ocean Glide \u2013 7\" \u2013 DJS10843 *Top of the world/ Soul Ice \u2013 7\" \u2013 DJM10981 *Shake down/Your gonna love this \u2013 7\" \u2013 EMI 2988 *Shake down/Your Gonna Love this \u2013 12\" \u2013 12EMI2988 ==Music labels (non-commercial)== *Themes Records \u2013 LP *KPM \u2013 solo & w/others \u2013 LP *Bruton \u2013 solo & w/others \u2013 LP/CD *Music House \u2013 solo & w/others \u2013 CD *Reliable Source Music \u2013 CD ==Filmography== *Luxo, Jr. \u2013 music: \"Chateau Latour\", \"Finesse\", \"Quicksilver\" *Light & Heavy \u2013 music: \"Chateau Latour\" *Surprise - music: \"Quicksilver\" ==Production credits== *Dennis Waterman \u2013 Downwind of Angels \u2013 LP \u2013 DJF 204830 \u2013 DJM \u2013 1976 *Dennis Waterman \u2013 Dennis Waterman \u2013 LP \u2013 DJF 20513 \u2013 DJM \u2013 1977 *Demis Roussos \u2013 The Demis Roussos Magic \u2013 (CD) \u2013 BX 523-2 *Drake - \"Summer Sixteen\" \u2013 2016 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:English drummers Category:British male drummers Category:English pianists Category:English record producers Category:English rock drummers Category:English composers Category:British rock and roll musicians Category:People from Palmers Green Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Ivor Novello Award winners Category:People from Radlett Category:The Shadows members Category:English conductors (music) Category:British male conductors (music) Category:British music arrangers Category:People educated at Winchmore School Category:British male pianists Category:21st-century British conductors (music) ",
