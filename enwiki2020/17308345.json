    "text": "Goodfellas Music from the Motion Picture is the soundtrack for the 1990 film Goodfellas, directed by Martin Scorsese, notable for its use of popular music from the various periods it portrayed. In a similar manner to American Graffiti and Scorsese's earlier Mean Streets, the songs served roughly the same purpose as a composed musical score. While an official soundtrack was released at the same time as the film, it only featured a small fraction of the songs used. Scorsese chose the songs for Goodfellas only if they commented on the scene or the characters \"in an oblique way\". The only rule he adhered to with the soundtrack was to only use music which could have been heard at that time. Scorsese decided that if a scene took place in the 1970s, he could use any song that was current or older. According to Scorsese, a lot of non- dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had \"Layla\" playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car and the meat-truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action. Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script while other songs he discovered during the editing phase. There is no music once Henry is arrested in his driveway by the DEA, until the end credits. ==Track listing== Songs on the movie's soundtrack CD: # \"Rags to Riches\" \u2013 Tony Bennett # \"Sincerely\" \u2013 The Moonglows # \"Speedoo\" \u2013 The Cadillacs # \"Stardust\" \u2013 Billy Ward and His Dominoes # \"Look in My Eyes\" \u2013 The Chantels # \"Life Is but a Dream\" \u2013 The Harptones # \"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\" \u2013 The Shangri-Las # \"Baby, I Love You\" \u2013 Aretha Franklin # \"Beyond the Sea\" \u2013 Bobby Darin # \"Sunshine of Your Love\" \u2013 Cream # \"Mannish Boy\" \u2013 Muddy Waters # \"Layla (Piano Exit)\" \u2013 Derek and the Dominos ==Complete song list== Songs used in the movie in chronological order: * \"Rags to Riches\" by Tony Bennett \u2013 Opening credits, opening narration. * \"Can't We Be Sweethearts\" by The Cleftones \u2013 Young Henry is parking Cadillacs;
