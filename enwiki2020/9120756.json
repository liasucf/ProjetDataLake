It derives from the Slavic word sokol, meaning \"falcon\" and literally means \"son of the falcon\". The Sokolovi\u0107 of the Sanjak of Herzegovina were called Sokoli and Sokullu-o\u011flu, by the Ottomans. One of the coat of arms included in the Koreni\u0107-Neori\u0107 Armorial (1595) and the Fojnica Armorial (1675\u201388) claimed to be that of the \"Sokolovich\". The coat of arms most likely was attributed to the Sokolovi\u0107 of Glasinac (Sokolac region). ==Modern families== ===Bosnia and Herzegovina=== The Sokolovi\u0107 in Fo\u010da have the slava of Mratindan, the veneration of Serbian King Stefan De\u010danski. The Sokolovi\u0107 of Fo\u010da, when interviewed by Vladimir Dedijer, said that they had left their ancestral home long ago. Dedijer concluded that the Sokolovi\u0107 of Fo\u010da hailed from Korjeni\u0107i. Indeed, in the Late Middle Ages, families in Korjeni\u0107i had the slava of Mratindan; among one of these families were surely the Sokolovi\u0107 of Fo\u010da. The Mastilovi\u0107 in Gacko claimed that they were formerly named Sokolovi\u0107, and that they were kin with those Sokolovi\u0107 in Fo\u010da, with whom they share the slava, and they claimed that Mehmed-pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 was one their ancestors. A Sima Mastilovi\u0107 was mentioned in a document of the Piva Monastery from 1569; this points to that Sokolovi\u0107 was used much earlier than that. The Kojovi\u0107 and Djai\u0107 in \u010ci\u010devo near Trebinje also descend from the Sokolovi\u0107 in Fo\u010da, and have the slava of Mratindan. Petar Ra\u0111enovi\u0107's anthropological work Bjelajsko Polje i Bravsko (1925) mentioned a Sokolovi\u0107 family in the Muslim village of Bjelaj, Bosanski Petrovac, as one of three Serb families, which had in 1921 settled from Ripa\u010d; they have the slava of \u0110ur\u0111evdan, and hail from \u010cajni\u010de, and were earlier surnamed Glo\u0111aji\u0107.; \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u0420\u0430\u0452\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b, \u0411\u0458\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0458\u0441\u043a\u043e \u041f\u043e\u0459\u0435 \u0438 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e, \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a 1925 XXXV ===Serbia=== In the period of 1920\u201331, Serb and other South Slavic families of the Kingdom of Hungary (and Serbian-Hungarian Baranya-Baja Republic) were given the option to leave Hungary for the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and thereby change citizenship (these were called optanti). The Sokolovi\u0107 optanti were Serb. In Nagybudm\u00e9r (Veliki Budmir), there was one optanti Sokolovi\u0107 family,; \u0413\u043e\u0458\u043a\u043e \u041c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b, \u0421\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0430 \u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0443 \u2013 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043e\u043f\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0443 \u041c\u0430\u0452\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0458 1920-1931., \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0421\u0430\u0434, 2010, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 282-291 in Borj\u00e1d (Borjad), there were three opranti Sokolovi\u0107 families.; \u0413\u043e\u0458\u043a\u043e \u041c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b \u201c\u0421\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0430 \u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0443\u201c, \u043a\u045a\u0438\u0433\u0430 2, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0421\u0430\u0434, 2010 ===Croatia=== There are Sokolovi\u0107 in Kordun, Croatia, who have the slava of \u0110ur\u0111evdan. ==Notable individuals== *Mehmed-pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 or Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (1506\u20131579), Ottoman statesman *Makarije Sokolovi\u0107 - Serbian Patriarch from 1557 to 1571 *Antonije Sokolovi\u0107 - Serbian Patriarch from 1571 to 1575 *Gerasim Sokolovi\u0107 - Serbian Patriarch from 1575 to 1586 *Savatije Sokolovi\u0107 - Serbian Metropolitan of Herzegovina and later Serbian Patriarch, 1587 *Ferhat-pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 (died 1586) - Ottoman statesman *Lazar Sokolovi\u0107 (fl. 1718\u201335), an emissary of the Serbian Orthodox assemblies between 1718 and 1735. *Sokolovi\u0107, captain of the Serbian Free Corps. *Gligor Sokolovi\u0107 (1870\u20131910) - Chetnik military commander *Mi\u0107o Sokolovi\u0107 (1883\u20131906), founder of the labour movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina *Semka Sokolovi\u0107-Bertok (1935\u20132008) - Bosnian actress *Zijah Sokolovi\u0107 (born 1950) - Bosnian actor and director *Zoran Sokolovi\u0107 (1938\u20132001) - former Minister of Internal Affairs (Serbia) and Minister of the Interior (Yugoslavia) *Milorad Sokolovi\u0107 - former player for the Yugoslavia national basketball team *Ljubi\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 (born 1948) Serbian economist *Ana Sokolovic, Canadian music composer *Sarah Sokolovic, American actress ==Ottoman-era Sokolovi\u0107 family== In the Ottoman period, in the 16th century, there was an influential Sokolovi\u0107 family that had two branches, one that was Orthodox (Serb), and was dominant in the Serbian Orthodox Church, while the other became Muslim, and was influential in the Ottoman government.
