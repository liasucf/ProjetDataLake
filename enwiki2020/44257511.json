He was educated at St. Peter's College when Archdeacon Farr was head master, and was a brilliant student, gaining the highest marks at the competitive examination when Sir R. G. MacDonnell, Governor of South Australia, was president of the board of governors. After leaving college Aldridge worked in various business houses as a clerk and accountant. In 1868 he joined G. W. Goyder's expedition to the Northern Territory. Three years afterwards he joined the mining boom in the Northern Territory with J. le M. F. J. Servante and Wickliffe Snow, where they discovered the Woolwonga Mine, which they worked successfully for 12 months, then Aldridge went on to the Sandy Creek diggings and was doing well until an attack of malaria forced him to return to Adelaide. He next went into partnership with his old school friend Theodore Bruce, as auctioneers.These partners, both born in 1847, married the McFie sisters, died within a few months of each other, and were both cremated Next he, Bruce and W.

In 1888 Aldridge became a member of the Stock Exchange, and succeeded founding president Henry Bellingham (1807\u20131889), a position he held with distinction for 14 years, encompassing both the Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie booms.
