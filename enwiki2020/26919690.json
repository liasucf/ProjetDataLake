    "text": "Luxembourg was represented by Sophie Carle, with the song '\"100% d'amour\", at the 1984 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 5 May in Luxembourg City following Corinne Herm\u00e8s' victory the previous year. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster RTL. Carle was the first Luxembourg native to represent the Grand Duchy since Monique Melsen in 1971. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Carle performed second in the running order, following Sweden and preceding France. \"100% d'amour\" was an unchallenging uptempo Euro- pop song, and in a relatively weak field had been tipped as a possible contender to bring Luxembourg a second consecutive victory. However Carle's vocal performance on the night was a disaster, weak and well off-key throughout the song - it is generally cited as one of the worst vocal performances ever heard in a Eurovision final and is invariably included in montages of the more glaringly out-of-tune moments in contest history. At the close of voting \"100% d'amour\" had picked up only 39 points, placing Luxembourg 10th of the 19 entries. The Luxembourgian jury awarded its 12 points to Belgium.ESC History - Luxembourg 1984 ===Points awarded to Luxembourg=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=5|Points awarded to Luxembourg |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | |- |} ===Points awarded by Luxembourg=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|'|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} ==See also== *Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1984 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1984 Category:Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1984 in Luxembourg ",
