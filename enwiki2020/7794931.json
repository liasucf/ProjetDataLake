Langl\u00fctjen is the name of the two uninhabited artificial islands created in the 19th century, Langl\u00fctjen I and Langl\u00fctjen II, in the north off the coast of the district Wesermarsch in Lower Saxony, Germany. The islands are administered by the town of Nordenham. Their size is 16,000 and 17,000 square metres, respectively. On the small islands are the remains of fortifications of what was first the Prussian Navy and later the Kaiserliche Marine. Its function was to protect the harbours of Bremen and Bremerhaven, but the islands were never afflicted in active warfare. Langl\u00fctjen II was sold to a private owner in January 2006. Langl\u00fctjen I was sold around the same time. == External pages == *Description of Langl\u00fctjen I and II with pictures (German) *Aerial picture of Langl\u00fctjen I (German) * Private association Inselfort Langl\u00fctjen II (German) Category:Frisian Islands Category:Uninhabited islands of Germany Category:Islands of Lower Saxony Category:Artificial islands of Lower Saxony ",
