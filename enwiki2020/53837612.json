It was a tricolor with vertical stripes, beginning from the flagpole: blue, yellow and red with the emblem on the center. It had a width- length ratio of 2:3. The flag remained in use until the Romanian Revolution of 1989 when the flag used from 1918-1947 was restored. ==Design== {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"600px\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; border-collapse: collapse; white-space: nowrap; text-align: left\" |- style=\"text-align: center; background: #eee\" ! 30px (1867-present) !style=\"background:#002B7F;color:#FFF;width:150px\"| Blue !style=\"background:#FCD000;color:#000;width:150px\"| Yellow !style=\"background:#CE0000;color:#FFF;width:150px\"| Red |- | Pantone | 280c | 116c | 186c |- | CMYK | 99-86-1-00 | 2-18-95-0 | 4-99-94-0 |- | RGB | 0-43-127 | 252-209-22 | 206-17-38 |- | Hexadecimal | #002B7F | #FCD116 | #CE1126 |} ==History== On 30 December 1947, Romania was proclaimed a people's republic and all the kingdom's symbols were outlawed, including the coats of arms and the tricolor flags that showed them. On 8 January 1948, Decree nr. 3 was issued, regarding specifications for the powers of the Presidium of the Romanian People's Republic.Decree published in Monitorul Oficial, nr. 7 of 9 January 1948, p. 154 At article 7, this provided that the republic's new coat of arms should be \u201ccomposed of: a tractor, a group of three chimneys against the field of a rising sun, surrounded by bound ears of wheat, tied by a ribbon with the inscription Republica Popular\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 and the initials R. P. R. at the end of the ears\u201d. Article 8 dealt with the national flag: \u201cthe colors of the Romanian People\u2019s Republic are: blue, yellow and red, arranged vertically, and having in the center of the yellow field the Coat of Arms of the Republic\u201d. According to article 101 of the 1948 Constitution, \u201cThe flag of the Romanian People\u2019s Republic is composed of the colors: blue, yellow and red, arranged vertically. In the middle is placed the national coat of arms\u201d.Constitutia Republicii Populare Rom\u00e2ne din 1948, published \u00een Monitorul Oficial, part I, nr. 87 bis of 13 April 1948 The 1952 Constitution, at article 103, added a little detail: \u201cThe flag of the Romanian People\u2019s Republic has the colors red, yellow and blue, arranged vertically with blue near the lance. In the middle is placed the coat of arms of the Romanian People\u2019s Republic\u201d.Constitutia Republicii Populare Rom\u00e2ne din 1952, published in Buletinul Oficial al Marii Adun\u0103ri Na\u0163ionale a Republicii Populare Rom\u00e2ne, nr. 1 of 27 September 1952 Neither the colors\u2019 shades nor the flag's proportions were specified. According to provisions of the 1952 Constitution, a five- pointed red star appeared at the upper edge of the coat of arms (itself altered in March 1948), something that was also reflected on flags and official Romanian standards.

File:Le\u0161any, Vojensk\u00e9 muzeum, ARO (Rumunsko) II.JPG|An ARO IMS with an RPR flag, 1952 design The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Romania, adopted in 1965, provided the following in article 118: \u201cThe flag of the Socialist Republic of Romania has the colors red, yellow and blue, arranged vertically, with blue near the flagpole. The coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Romania is affixed to the middle\u201d.Constitutia Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia, published in Buletinul Oficial al R.S.R., nr. 1 of 21 August 1965 Decree nr. 972 of 5 November 1968 regarding the insignia of the Socialist Republic of Romania (RSR)Decree published in Buletinul Oficial al R.S.R., nr. 141 of 5 November 1968 described in detail the coat of arms, seal, flag and state anthem of the republic. The attached commentary noted that, in the absence of corresponding regulations, \u201cthere have appeared mistaken interpretations of these [constitutional specifications], incorrect or diverging usages of the state insignia\u201d. Chapter IV of the decree is entirely devoted to describing the flag and the protocol for its use. Thus, the flag is defined as having a ratio of 2:3, with the colored stripes of equal dimensions. The regular colors were printed in the annex and not expressly named. The coat of arms was placed in the center; its height was the flag's width. As before, it was provided that the flag's proportions could differ for ornamental purposes, but the coat of arms must always be in the center, vertical. Articles 13-21 specifically and exhaustively covered flag protocol, describing where it was to be raised permanently and temporarily (art. 13), the protocol for raising it outside the country's borders (art. 14) and during demonstrations by socialist organizations (art. 15), the conditions for lowering it to half-staff (art. 16, 17 and 18, with art. 20 describing exceptions to the rule), the conditions and manner for draping caskets with the flag (art. 19), as well as the place of the Romanian flag in case it flew besides one or more foreign flags (art. 21). During the revolution at Timi\u0219oara beginning on 17 December 1989, the coat of arms of the Romanian Socialist Republic began to be removed from flags, being viewed as a symbol of Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu's dictatorial regime. Most often, this was accomplished by cutting or ripping out the middle of the yellow stripe, giving rise to the term \"the flag with the hole\". Decree-Law nr. 2 of 27 December 1989 regarding the membership, organization and functioning of the Council of the National Salvation Front and of the territorial councils of the National Salvation FrontDecree-Law published in Monitorul Oficial nr. 4 of 27 December 1989 provided at article 1, among other matters, that \u201cthe national flag is the traditional tricolor of Romania, with the colors laid out vertically, in the following order, starting from the flagpole: blue, yellow, red\u201d.

The coat of arms of the Romanian People\u2019s Republic, in natural colors, is affixed to the middle of the white area on both sides. The ensign does not have fringes or tassels [and] is supplied with cords and a mechanism for raising it on the stern beam or the mast\". The ensign for Coast Guard ships was different from that of Navy ships only in the color of the lower stripe\u2014Coast Guard green. The law's annex described proportions for the ensign's various elements; the actual dimensions were to be fixed by the Armed Forces Ministry and the Interior Ministry depending on the ship's size and the place where the ensign was raised. Thus, the flag was 0.6 times as wide as it was long, being divided thus: colored stripe and white stripe. The coat of arms was to be the height of the flag's width, being placed of this width away from the edges of the white stripe. Between 1953 and 1964, due to a spelling reform, the country's name was written on flags as Rom\u00eenia and not Rom\u00e2nia. Decree nr. 93 of 17 April 1954 for the modification of art. 4 of Decree nr. 189Decree published in Buletinul Oficial, nr. 18 of 17 April 1954 established new vexillological devices: the ensign of auxiliary Navy ships (the previous ensign continuing in use only for battleships) and pennants for Navy battleships, auxiliary Navy ships and Coast Guard vessels. The ensign of auxiliary Navy ships was made of an \"ordinary canvas, rectangular and blue.

To the middle of the white area, on both sides, is affixed the coat of arms of the Romanian People\u2019s Republic, in natural colors\". This ensign's proportions were indicated in the annex. It was 0.6 times as wide as it was long: the upper left part of the standard was similar in proportion to the basic elements of the battleship standard, while its dimensions were 0.5 of the flag's length and 0.3 of its width. Navy and Coast Guard vessels had a masthead pennant made of an \u201cordinary rectangular canvas, red for Navy battleships, blue for auxiliary Navy ships and green for Coast Guard ships [the width is 0.6 of the length]. At the edge near the cord, the colors white and light blue are imprinted on both sides, in two horizontal stripes, for Navy ships and white and light green on Coast Guard ships [in proportions of and respectively; this area\u2019s length is 0.075 that of the pennant\u2019s length]. In both cases white shall be above. The coat of arms of the Romanian People\u2019s Republic, in natural colors is affixed to the middle of the white area on both sides [with a height of the pennant\u2019s width and located and of this width away from the edges of the white area]. At the other end, the pennant is cut in the form of a sharp angle pointing inward [the cut was 1.2 times as deep as the length of the white and colored area near the cord]. The ships\u2019 pennany is provided with a cord and a mechanism for being raised on a tall mast\u201d. The proportions of the pennant's component elements were indicated in the annex, with the actual dimensions remaining to be decided by the Armed Forces Ministry and the Interior Ministry.

In the attached commentary, it was mentioned that the previous regulations were no longer valid, primarily because: *military colors of naval land units no longer featured the national flag colors, but only white and blue; *ensigns and pennants of the Navy and Coast Guard ships no longer featured the national flag colors and thus\u2014even at close distances\u2014Romanian ships could be confused with those of other nations; *the air force flag was no longer necessary, as it did not correspond to the new organization of the air force within the armed forces.

The granting of the flag is done in the name of the Council of State of the Romanian Socialist Republic by a representative of the armed forces, respectively of the internal affairs minister\u201d. The first clause of this article was modified thus by Decree nr. 150 of 19 June 1974 regarding the modification of certain laws and decrees:Decree published in Buletinul Oficial nr. 83 of 19 June 1974 \u201cthe flag is granted by presidential decree to units and large units of all military branches from the Armed Forces Ministry, as well as to units from the Internal Affairs Ministry, at their founding\u201d. Ensigns of navy and Coast Guard vessels consisted of the military colors of the respective units. The pennant was the device that indicated a ship was armed and commanded by a navy officer. It consisted of an \u201cordinary canvas, in the shape of an isosceles triangle, with the base toward the attaching mechanism and with the flag colors and coat of arms of the Romanian Socialist Republic printed on both sides\u201d. The jack was \u201can ordinary square canvas, having printed on both sides the flag colors and coat of arms of the Romanian Socialist Republic.

Its dimensions were indicated in the annex: the canvas was 100 centimeter long and 66 centimeter wide, the text was 6 centimeter high, the fringes 5 centimeter long, the flagpole 240 centimeter long and 4 centimeter wide, while the ogive at the end of the flagpole was 15 centimeter high. According to the Decree, the flag was granted to a unit by commanders of county-level or Bucharest-level Patriotic Guards, or by representatives of the General Staff of the Patriotic Guards from the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, following a presidential decree for this purpose. Patriotic Guards that distinguished themselves in training exercises for national defense and that comprised at least 2000 fighters were eligible to receive their unit flags.
