    "text": "Alpha Gamma (\u0391\u0393) was an American collegiate fraternity. It was founded at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee in 1867. About 21 chapters developed, with prominent chapters at Washington & Jefferson College, Trinity University, Mercersburg College, Southwestern Presbyterian University, Cumberland University, and the West Virginia University. The fraternity's badge consisted of a golden shield with a globe, six stars, and a pennant with \"\u0391\u0393.\" The fraternity eventually disbanded. The Trinity and West Virginia University chapters were disbanded because of the anti-fraternity laws. The Washington & Jefferson College and Southwestern Presbyterian University chapters joined Alpha Tau Omega. The remainder disbanded. ==References== Category:Student organizations established in 1867 Category:Student societies in the United States Category:Defunct fraternities and sororities Category:1867 establishments in Tennessee ",
