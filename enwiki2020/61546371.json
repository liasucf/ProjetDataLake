    "text": "General structure of polychlorinated carbazoles Polychlorinated carbazoles (PCCZ) are a group of chlorinated organic compounds. They are derivatives of carbazole and nitrogen analogues of polychlorinated dibenzofurans. Polychlorinated carbazoles usually occur as a mixture of various isomers. This mixture can have a certain frequency pattern (congener pattern) from which conclusions can be drawn about the causes of formation. PCCZs are not manufactured purposefully. They are formed under certain conditions as by- products of thermal processes. In environmental samples, mixed halogenated carbazoles are also found.M. Pena-Abaurrea, K. J. Jobst, R. Ruffolo, L.
