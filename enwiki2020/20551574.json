It won the Grand Prix at the nineteenth Krak\u00f3w Film Festival in 1979. The 16 minute film consists of an interview with Marian Osuch, a minor security official. Most of the footage is of Osuch performing the various duties of his job, while he narrates his opinions on various subjects. Osuch talks mostly about his position, how he personally enjoys enforcing various bureaucratic rules, arresting petty offenders, and confiscating fishing rods. He also details his support for the government and capital punishment, saying that criticism of the government should be silenced, and that criminals should be hanged in public. English-subtitled versions of the film are included on Polskie Wydawnictwo Audiowizualne's double-disc survey of Kie\u015blowski's non-fiction work Polish School of the Documentary: Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski (Region 0 PAL) and as an extra on the Artificial Eye DVD of Kie\u015blowski's A Short Film About Killing (Region 2 PAL).
