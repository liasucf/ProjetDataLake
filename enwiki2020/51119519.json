    "text": "Numbered skeletal formula of bicyclo[4.4.0]decane or Decalin. The grey numbers represent numbering according to the von Baeyer nomenclature. The von Baeyer nomenclature is a system for describing polycyclic hydrocarbons. The system was originally developed in 1900 by Adolf von Baeyer for bicyclic systemsAdolf Baeyer: Systematik und Nomenclatur bicyclischer Kohlenwasserstoffe. and in 1913 expanded by Eduard Buchner and Wilhelm Weigand for tricyclic systems.E. Buchner, W. Weigand: Bornylen und Diazoessigester [Nebst einer Nomenklatur tricyclischer Kohlenstoff-Ringsysteme nach Adolf von Baeyer]. The system has been adopted and extended by the IUPAC as part of its nomenclature for organic chemistry. The modern version has been extended to cover more cases of compounds including an arbitrary number of cycles, heterocyclic compounds and unsaturated compounds.
