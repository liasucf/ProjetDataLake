    "text": "Rock Hill High School (RHHS) is a rural, public high school near Ironton, Ohio. It is officially called Rock Hill Senior High School. It is the only high school in the Rock Hill Local School District. The high school is a four- year school, offering grades 9-12. Their nickname is the Redmen, and their mascot is an Indian Chieftain. Its official colors are red and white. ==Brief history== The Rock Hill Local School District formerly consisted of four separate school districts, which were located in the towns of Decatur, Hanging Rock, Kitts Hill, and Pedro. Hanging Rock, Kitts Hill, and Pedro consolidated in 1949. Consolidation went somewhat smoothly, with the new school taking something from each of the old. 'Rock' from Hanging Rock, 'Hill' from Kitt's Hill, the 'Redmen' from Pedro, as well as the location in Pedro. Decatur Township schools joined in 1965. New schools were recently built and opened in 2002. The official name of the school is Rock Hill Senior High School, however, in many instances it drops the 'Senior'; and it is mostly used ceremonially, for graduations and business. The reasoning for this is that the school used to feature 10-12 grades, and the junior high school featured 7-9. After the changes made by the Board of Education, the high school added ninth grade and the junior high added the sixth grade. The junior high school changed its name officially to \"Rock Hill Middle School,\" but the high school never followed suit. There are several reasons behind this, being that it is the only high school in the country to have the name, (there are other Rock Hill High Schools, but there are no other Rock Hill Senior High Schools), as well as tradition. The high school has been selected a \"School of Promise\" by the Ohio State Superintendent for four straight years (2003\u201304, 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, 2006\u201307). It was the only high school in Lawrence County, Ohio, to receive the award in 2005-06. The award was created, according to the Ohio Department of Education website, \"To help close achievement gaps in Ohio, the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) developed the Schools of Promise program to identify, recognize, and highlight schools that are making substantial progress in ensuring high achievement for all students.\" == Athletics == Rock Hill High School is a founding member of the Ohio Valley Conference.
