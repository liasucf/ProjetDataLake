Together, they were the parents of two sons before his death: * Cadwallader R. Colden, who became the editor of the U.S. Sporting Magazine, published in New York, in 1835-6. * Alexander Colden. After Colden's death, she returned to Scotland with her sons where they were educated at a school near Lancaster, England before returning to the United States after the Revolutionary War. In 1798, Henrietta sold a farm at New Lots in Kings County, New York to Sir James Hall of Dunglass in Scotland. ===Literary interests=== Colden was known for her different literary interests.
