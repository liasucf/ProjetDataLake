In 1863, he went to Copenhagen to study with and take classes at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. From 1864 to 1867, he completed his studies at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf with Oswald Achenbach and was influenced by the works of Hans Gude. After completing his studies, he remained in D\u00fcsseldorf.Rasmu\u00dfen, Maler, J\u00e4gerhofstr. 2, in Adre\u00dfbuch der Oberb\u00fcrgermeisterei D\u00fcsseldorf, 1865 From 1868 to 1900, he was a member of , a local artists' association. The variety of his landscapes diminished after 1870, when he began devoting himself almost entirely to fjords. This was probably in response to the preferences of the tourist trade. They were especially popular in Germany. In 1899 he moved to Berlin, but returned to Norway every summer to sell his paintings. After 1900, he turned to painting with a palette knife and brightened his colors, in imitation of Adelsteen Normann. His paintings always included foregrounds with people and boats; occasionally houses. Many of his works were copied and sold as prints. Some art historians maintain that he would be better known today if he had become a member of the Berlin Secession. His works may be seen at the National Gallery of Denmark, the Deutschen Schifffahrtsmuseum in Bremerhaven, the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Dresden and the Kunstmuseum D\u00fcsseldorf. A large number of his paintings are held in storage by the Bergen Museum of Art & Science. ==References== == Further reading == * == External links == * More works by Rasmussen @ ArtNet Category:1842 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Norwegian landscape painters Category:Norwegian emigrants to Germany Category:19th-century Norwegian painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:20th-century Norwegian painters Category:Norwegian male painters Category:20th-century male artists ",
