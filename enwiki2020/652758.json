    "text": "Hunsrik (Hunsrik or Hunsr\u00fcckisch, ), also called Riograndenser Hunsr\u00fcckisch, is a Moselle Franconian language derived primarily from the Hunsr\u00fcckisch dialect of West Central German. The language has some recognition mainly in Brazil. It is an integral part of the historical and cultural heritage of Rio Grande do Sul since 2012, and is considered an immaterial cultural heritage of Santa Catarina since 2016.Lei N.\u00ba 14.061, de 23 de julho de 2012 It is also a co-official language in the municipalities of Ant\u00f4nio Carlos, Santa Maria do Herval and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o do Oeste.IPOL realizar\u00e1 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de recenseadores para o censo lingu\u00edstico do munic\u00edpio de Ant\u00f4nio Carlos, com exemplos tabelados de munic\u00edpios (2015) In Brazil, Hunsrik is spoken in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1. The language is also spoken in some regions of the Northeast of Argentina and Southeast of Paraguay. Hunsrik developed from the Hunsr\u00fcckisch dialect when immigrants from the Hunsr\u00fcck region of Germany (Rhineland-Palatinate) settled in southern regions such as Rio Grande do Sul, starting by imperial designs in 1824 (these later became projects controlled by states and finally by private European investment enterprises). While primarily based on the Hunsr\u00fcckisch branch of the German language, it has also been greatly influenced by other German dialects such as East Pomeranian and Plautdietsch, and by Portuguese, the national language of Brazil. It has been influenced to a lesser extent by indigenous languages such as Kaingang and Guarani and by immigrant languages such as Italian and Talian. Portuguese expressions and words are commonly imported into Hunsrik, particularly in reference to fauna and flora (which are different from those of Germany) and to technological innovations that did not exist when the original immigrants came to Brazil, leading to words like for airplane (Portuguese ) instead of , (Pt. , truck) instead of , (Pt. ) instead of , etc. Daily expressions are often calques (literal translations) of Portuguese, for example (\"how are you\", literally \"all good\") is from Portuguese . Also common are the use of German suffixes attached to Portuguese words, such as , \"little mug\", from Portuguese , \"mug\", and German diminutive suffix ( in Hunsrik); hybrid forms such as , \"shoe shop\", from German and Portuguese , and Germanized forms of Portuguese verbs: , \"to remember\"; \"to flirt\"; , \"to answer\" (Portuguese , , and ). However, regardless of these borrowings, its grammar and vocabulary are still largely German. Although Hunsrik is the most common Germanic language in south Brazil, the use of this language\u2014particularly in the last three to four generations\u2014continues to decrease. Glottolog classifies the language as \"shifting\" on its Agglomerated Endangerment Status. == History == === In Germany === The Hunsr\u00fcckisch dialect, from which Hunsrik derived, has its origins in the Moselle Franconian dialects spoken in the Hunsr\u00fcck region, on the banks of the Rhine and Moselle rivers, in western Germany. Germany, as a national state, only unified in 1871, so the standard German existing today was, until the 19th century, a literary language, created by Martin Luther in his famous translation of the Bible. The German people, in their daily lives, did not use standard German to communicate, but several regional dialects. Until around 1800, Standard German was primarily a written language in Germany. Standard German was often learned as a foreign language and had an uncertain pronunciation. With the country's unification process and the mass literacy of the population, standard German has become the language used by speakers of different dialects to understand each other, although regional dialects have remained the language used at home. === In Brazil === With German immigration to Brazil, over the past two centuries, German dialects have also come to establish themselves as a regional language. However, something curious happened: while in Germany standard German served for speakers of different dialects to communicate, in Brazil, due to the still incipient consolidation of standard German when immigration started, this role was played by the Hunsr\u00fcckisch dialect. There are two hypotheses for this phenomenon. The first because most immigrants would have come from Hunsr\u00fcck, so their dialect predominated. The second because Hunsr\u00fcckisch has intermediate features between the different German dialects, so it served as a koin\u00e9 between speakers of various dialects. What is known is that German immigrants in Brazil came from different parts of Germany, so Hunsrik-speaking Brazilians do not necessarily descend from people from Hunsr\u00fcck. In these German communities, the Hunsr\u00fcckisch dialect remained the main language of communication for several decades. German colonies in the South were usually formed in regions of forest depopulated or inhabited by Indians, who were expelled for the arrival of immigrants. Due to this isolation, the Germans managed to create a \"linguistic island\", in which German was the main language, and not Portuguese. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were hundreds of thousands of second- and third-generation German-Brazilians who could barely speak Portuguese. This differentiation favored the feeling of a minority group, which allied itself with the formation of solid ethnic institutions, such as schools, churches, social associations and a German- language press. All of these elements combined promoted a general feeling of \"cultural group\". In 1930, there were 2,500 ethnic schools in Brazil. Of these, 1,579 were from German immigrants. In these schools, children learned the standard German that is spread in Germany. This linguistic and cultural isolation was combated aggressively by the nationalist government of Get\u00falio Vargas, through the nationalization campaign. All German schools in the country were closed, annihilating the German-Brazilian middle school. The standard German learned at school was thus eliminated, greatly weakening the use of German in urban centers, which became limited to the countryside. People were harassed and beaten if they spoke German on the street. The police inspected people's private lives, breaking into houses to burn books written in German, or languages other than Portuguese. Many people were arrested for the simple fact that they speak German. In 1942, 1.5% of the inhabitants of Blumenau were imprisoned for speaking German. The closure of schools has caused people to become increasingly attached to the German dialect used in everyday life, far from standard German. == Language Name == Because of the initial lack of an official grammar and for being not governed by a centralized entity, there is a plurality as to the nomenclature used for the language. Adriano Steffler developed a \"Hunsrik Grammar\", a \"Hunsrik Dictionary\" and a form of the Latin alphabet with 45 letters of which 25 are traditional of the alphabet (however, without Q) and the remaining 20 are other non-traditional letters of the same alphabet, and also Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, and Greek. The grammar developed by this project is not currently applied in any teaching method or government initiative, but it is considered one of the first efforts to standardize the language. Currently, the language has two codification proposals. The first, from the SIL International, is led by professor and doctor Ursula Wiesemann and has an approach more focused on using the writing system used naturally by its native speakers in everyday actions, such as interpersonal interaction and the use of social networks. With a strong influence of the Latin alphabet used in Portuguese, it has the native name of Hunsrik, with the aim of distinguishing it as a unique Germanic language and not just as a dialect of the German language. This codification is applied in the teaching of municipal schools in Santa Maria do Herval, Est\u00e2ncia Velha and Nova Hartz, as well as in other municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul. The name Hunsrik can also be used officially to refer to the language in English and Portuguese, being officially called \"Hunsrik language\" by most federative entities that recognize it in Brazil.. The spelling translated into Portuguese as \"Brazilian Hunsr\u00fcckisch\" is also accepted by the project, however the preference is for the use of the former to generate a clearer differentiation of the language. The second coding project, from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, is led by doctor and professor Cl\u00e9o Vilson Altenhofen and has a more unionist approach to the German language, characterized by the preservation of the writing of the German Hunsr\u00fcckisch dialect with few variations. This project recommends the spelling Hunsr\u00fcckisch to refer to the dialect in its native form, with Hunsrickisch being an alternative as a way to emphasize the pronunciation of the word. At the same time, the project states that it refers to the same language denoted by Hunsrik in other projects and also accepts it as a spelling. The term Hunsr\u00fcckisch is also used officially in statements by some federal entities. To differentiate the dialect used in Brazil from that used in Germany, Altenhofen called the Brazilian dialect Riograndenser Hunsr\u00fcckisch (with reference to the state of Rio Grande do Sul). This nomenclature, however, is criticized by other scholars, since there are also considerable numbers of native speakers in other Brazilian states, as well as in other countries. Currently, UNESCO officially uses the Hunsrik spelling to refer to the language in its native form, made official with that name after studies by Ethnologue, an official advisory institution of the international body and whose publications are led by SIL International. The Hunsrik spelling is also used by Glottolog in its bibliographic database of the least known languages in the world, catalog of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Other international bodies that use this native spelling in the recognition of Hunsrik as a language are the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) from the University of Pennsylvania and the International Organization for Standardization, the latter assigns the hrx code as ISO 639-3 for the Hunsrik language. In some municipalities in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, the language is also called Deitsch (Altenhofen) or Taytx (Wiesemann), in clear reference to its roots in standard German. == Notable speakers == Recent Roman Catholic papal candidate Odilo SchererBBC BRASIL: Aldeira de antepassados alem\u00e3es torce para Scherer ser papa March 11, 2013. of Cerro Largo (located in the northwest of Rio Grande do Sul) grew up with Hunsrik as many from his native region did, using it side-by-side with Portuguese, the national language. Roman Catholic Cardinal Cl\u00e1udio Hummes of Montenegro, Rio Grande do Sul (in the Altkolonie region of the state), grew up speaking Portuguese alongside Hunsrik. According to supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, while her parents and siblings still speak Hunsrik, she has forgotten all of it herself. During an interview in 2011, renowned Brazilian writer, translator and international relations professor Aldyr Schlee talked in detail about having been an eyewitness to the repression of Hunsrik in his native state of Rio Grande do Sul during World War II. ==Phonology== === Vowels === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The contrast between plosives is not of voice, but of articulatory force, a phenomenon observed in some other dialects of German. ==Sample== Chapter 23, 1\u20135 of Luke's Gospel in Hunsrik, according to Dr. Ursula Wiesemann's orthography: Yeesus un Pilatos 23 Too sin ti kanse layt uf kextii, hon Yeesus pis Pilatos kenom un hon aan kefang aan se k\u00ebwe un saare: 2 M\u00ebyer hon too te man aan ketrof unser folek am uf h\u00ebtse.

In Kalileeya hot er aan kefang, un y\u00ebts is er too pay uns. The same text in Standard German: 23 Und die ganze Versammlung stand auf, und sie f\u00fchrten ihn vor Pilatus. 2 Sie fingen aber an, ihn zu verklagen und sprachen: Wir haben gefunden, dass dieser das Volk verf\u00fchrt und es davon abhalten will, dem Kaiser die Steuern zu zahlen. Er behauptet, er sei Christus, der K\u00f6nig. 3 Da fragte ihn Pilatus und sprach: Bist du der K\u00f6nig der Juden? Er antwortete ihm und sprach: Du sagst es! 4 Da sprach Pilatus zu den obersten Priestern und der Volksmenge: Ich finde keine Schuld an diesem Menschen! 5 Sie aber bestanden darauf und sprachen: Er wiegelt das Volk auf, indem er in ganz Jud\u00e4a lehrt, angefangen in Galil\u00e4a bis hierher! (23 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, \"We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.\" 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, \"Art thou the King of the Jews?\" And he answered him and said, \"Thou sayest it.\" 4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, \"I find no fault in this man.\" 5 And they were the more fierce, saying, \"He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.\") ==See also== *Geographical distribution of German speakers *Brazilian German *German Brazilians ==References== ==External links== *Os imigrantes alem\u00e3es e a sua cozinha/German Immigrants and Their Cuisine (in Portuguese and German) *Deutsche Minderheiten in Latin America (Riograndenser Hunsr\u00fcckisch) (in German) *Riograndenser Hunsr\u00fcckisch article on Deutsche Welle (in Portuguese) *Katharinensisch (German \u2013 out of the various titles, seek the one titled Katharinensisch) *YouTube video interview with Hunsr\u00fcckisch speaker from the town of Roque Gonzales, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. *YouTube video with documentary Viver no Brasil falando Hunsr\u00fcckisch (Living in Brazil speaking Hunsr\u00fcckisch). *YouTube video conversation between two Hunsr\u00fcckisch speakers from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. *YouTube video interview with Hunsr\u00fcckisch speaker from the town of Bigua\u00e7u, Santa Catarina, Brazil. *YouTube video interview with a couple of Hunsr\u00fcckisch speakers from the town of Bigua\u00e7u, Santa Catarina, Brazil. *Portuguese-Hunsrik online dictionary *Information at Omniglot Category:Endangered diaspora languages Category:Endangered languages Category:Languages of Brazil Category:Central German languages Category:German-Brazilian culture Category:German language Category:Articles citing ISO change requests ",
