The tour featured a collegiate theme. Not only did it kick off at Virginia Tech, it hit a number of college towns across the states\u2014from Pace University in New York to George Washington University in DC, ending with three shows at House of Blues in West\u2019s hometown, Chicago. The tour was opened by Dilated Peoples, and featured John Legend as the pianist and signer, along with A-Trak as tour DJ. Onstage, West paced in front of seven slim LED-screens, with the Chicago cityscape as his background. |- | style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 2005 || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | The Touch the Sky Tour|| style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | October 12, 2005 - December 11, 2005 (North America) || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 48 |- |colspan=\"14\" style=\"border-bottom-width:1px; padding:5px;\" | The Touch the Sky Tour was announced on September 15, 2005 and started off with a few hiccups, with West making changes right down to the last minute. West scrapped the Touch the Sky Tour\u2019s entire lighting plan just two weeks before the opening show in Miami. The tour was completely redone by new tour designer Es Devlin just a fortnight before opening night. Following this, just days before West was meant to start touring, opening act Common announced he couldn\u2019t make it, as he\u2019d just landed an acting role. This left West with Fantasia and Keyshia Cole for his opening acts, although Common would appear when his schedule allowed. In the end, the stage show was accompanied by a six-piece string section and featured live video of the show projected behind the stage. Negative reviews of his music and character were projected behind the stage, and he wore six different costume pieces (designer blazers). There was UK arena tour in February 2006 in the cities of Manchester, Glasgow, London, Cardiff and Birmingham. Australia tour commenced in late March, early April 2006. |- | style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 2008 || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | Glow in the Dark Tour || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | April 16, 2008 - December 7, 2008 (Worldwide)|| style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 88 |- | colspan=\"14\" style=\"border-bottom- width:1px; padding:5px;\" | The Glow in the Dark Tour was West's first worldwide tour and also included his first truly extraordinary stage. The Glow In The Dark Tour crammed in more than 50 arena and festival shows in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. before heading to Mexico and then across the Pacific, via South America, to the Far East and Europe. The tours opening acts were Rihanna, Lupe Fiasco and Rihanna. The concept pitted West as the pilot of a spaceship hitting a meteor storm, landing on a desolate planet of dry ice, and trying to find his way home through tracks from The College Dropout, Late Registration, Graduation, and latterly 808s & Heartbreak. With design again done by Es Devlin, in collaboration with Martin Phillips and John McGuire, the stage was transformed into a barren series of landscapes\u2014one resembling a giant moon\u2014and fantastical glow-in-the-dark features: a giant, glowing-eyed monster and a robot moved within the haze, women shimmered in gold paint for the track \u201cGold Digger,\u201d and stunning multi-colored light sequences lit up the often smoke-filled stage. West himself wore sci-fi themed threads, glow-in- the-dark accessories, his signature shutter shades, and gloves. The performance tour was captured in the book of photography Glow in the Dark by Nabil Elderkin. |- | style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 2011\u201312 || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | The Watch the Throne Tour || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | October 29, 2011 - June 12, 2012 (North America & Europe)|| style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 68 |- | colspan=\"14\" style=\"border-bottom- width:1px; padding:5px;\" | The Watch the Throne Tour with Jay-Z was in support of the pairs collaborative album Watch the Throne. The concert had no opening act and featured the two performers perched on massive video cubes showing sharks, rottweilers, crows, and tigers in a sea of darkness punctuated only by cellphone lights and piercing lasers. \u201cAttenborough BBC wildlife content and lasers\u201d was the brief given to stage designer Es Devlin by West for the tour. Devlin used hundreds of laser beams to create a myriad of different frames to this alternate world of geometric shapes, cascading light, wild animals, and its stars: West and Jay Z. Their habit of playing the smash hit \u201cNiggas in Paris\u201d eight, nine, 10, or 12 times in a row quickly become the stuff of legend. They partnered up with Givenchy for the clothing and the two donned t-shirts and leather pants. The tour grossed $95 million, and became the highest grossing hip-hop tour of all time. |- | style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 2013 || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | The Yeezus Tour || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | October 19, 2013 - September 15, 2014 (North America & Australia)|| style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 45 |- | colspan=\"14\" style=\"border-bottom-width:1px; padding:5px;\" | The Yeezus Tour served as West's first solo concert tour in five years, and featured a man- made mountain, diamond encrusted masks, and a catwalk, it was this tour that had the New York Post reviewer praising \u201can extravaganza of music and theater that gives the world windows into [West\u2019s] erratic persona.\u201d. This visual feast was created through collaboration between set designer Es Devlin, West\u2019s design company DONDA, fashion house Maison Margiela, artist Vanessa Beecroft, and more. This was the tour burned into memory through those full-face masks. This was the tour where Ye staged the reincarnation of Jesus and delivered sermons on the state of the world. The Yeezus stage set and concept\u2014featuring a giant mountain that occasionally turned into a volcano, West wore a custom- made Margiela mask that obscured his whole face. West worked closely with Maison Margiela to curate the show, and his wardrobe for the Tour was composed of 10 couture pieces, 20 ready-to-wear pieces, and an exclusive pair of sneakers, as well as the famous masks. Onstage, Devlin had constructed a mountain, which was sometimes wreathed in flames, sometimes covered with women in long white dresses. At times it would split in two halves, or become a volcano. There was an iceberg, 12 nude-nylon clad dancers, and a catwalk, alluding back to the fashion show created with Margiela. The speeches also became a key part of the Yeezus show. |- | style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 2016 || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | The Saint Pablo Tour || style=\"background-color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | August 25, 2016 - November 23, 2016 (North America)|| style=\"background- color: #DCDCDC;\" align=\"center\" | 41 |- | colspan=\"14\" style=\"border-bottom- width:1px; padding:5px;\" | The Saint Pablo Tour in support of The Life of Pablo featured a \"floating stage\" suspended by a network of cables.
