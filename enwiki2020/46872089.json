    "text": "Cortinarius caesiolamellatus mushroom in tray Cortinarius caesiolamellatus is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium). It was originally described as new to science in 2006 as a variety of Cortinarius rufoallutus. After molecular and morphological evidence suggested that it was sufficiently unique to be considered a unique species, it was promoted to species status in 2014. The mushroom is found in central and northern Europe, where it grows with spruce, and in Washington state (United States), where it additionally grows with pine. The lengthy fruiting season extends from June (in France) to November (in the United States). ==See also== *List of Cortinarius species ==References== ==External links== * caesiolamellatus Category:Fungi described in 2014 Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of the United States ",
