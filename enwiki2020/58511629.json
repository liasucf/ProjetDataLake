The name is derived from Amhalghaidh, son of F\u00edachra son of Eochaid Mugmedon of the Connachta group of early Gaelic dynasties. ==History== The O'Dowds were chiefs, but were then replaced by the Barretts in the 13th century after the Battle of Kilroe was fought between the Barretts led by William M\u00f3r Barrett and the O'Dowds led by Taichlech O' Dubhdha. Several military families of Welsh extraction and associated with the Norman invasion settled in this region and intermarried with the local clans, namely Walshes, Joyces, Lawlesses, Lynotts, and Barretts. ==Organisation== The O'Dowds kings were traditional inaugurated at the site of Carn Amhalghaidh, now in the townland of Carns near Killala. The t\u00faath contained many castles as part of its defence network. ==Annalistic references== * U913.6.
