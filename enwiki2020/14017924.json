    "text": "peristasis A peripteros (a peripteral building, ) is a type of ancient Greek or Roman temple surrounded by a portico with columns. It is surrounded by a colonnade (pteron) on all four sides of the cella (naos), creating a four- sided arcade (peristasis, or peristyle). By extension, it also means simply the perimeter of a building (typically a classical temple), when that perimeter is made up of columns. The term is frequently used of buildings in the Doric order. ==Definition== The peripteros can be a portico, a kiosk or a chapel. If it is made up of four columns, it is a tetrastyle; of six, hexastyle; of eight, octastyle; of ten, decastyle; and of twelve, dodecastyle. If the columns are fitted into the wall instead of standing alone, the building is a pseudoperipteros. ==References== Category:Ancient Greek architecture Category:Ancient Roman architecture Category:Architectural elements Category:Greek temples ",
