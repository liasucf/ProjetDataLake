    "text": "June Gale (born June Gilmartin; July 6, 1911 \u2013 November 13, 1996) was an American actress sometimes credited as June Levant. Born in San Francisco, Gale rose to fame as part of the vaudeville act The Gale Sisters. She appeared on Broadway with her sisters in Flying High (1930) and George White's Scandals (1931). In the early 1930s made her first films in Hollywood. This was originally as a Goldwyn Girl but gradually she rose to more notable parts, generally in B movies. In December 1939, Gale married Oscar Levant in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and they remained wed until his death in 1972. Later she married Henry Ephron. Gale was an integral part of two TV talk shows. After a disagreement led to her leaving her co-host role on The Oscar Levant Show, she began her own show. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Title ! Year ! Role !
