    "text": "James Marks (1835 - 12 January 1907) was an Australian politician. He was born in Sydney to publican James Marks and Elizabeth Charles. He attended school privately in Sydney and then worked on his father's farm. In 1862 he married Sarah Jane Moffitt, with whom he had six children. The family farm was such a success that Marks was able to retire at the age of forty, moving to Woollahra where he became a local alderman. In 1891 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Free Trade member for Paddington, but he did not re-contest in 1894. Marks died at Woollahra in 1907. ==References== Category:1835 births Category:1907 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Free Trade Party politicians Category:19th-century Australian politicians ",
