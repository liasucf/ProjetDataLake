Starting from the age of 10, she became introduced into the Hip-Hop/Rap scene when she wasn't able to give her father anything for Father's Day, instead, she delivered him with a Father's Day rap.

She is currently attending Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) for her Bachelor's in Music Business. == Career == Also being referred to as \"The Rap Girl\", she achieved this nickname through High School as being one the kids always freestyling in the lunch room.
