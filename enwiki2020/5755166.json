    "text": "The Serpent on the Crown is the 17th in a series of historical mystery novels, written by Elizabeth Peters and featuring fictional sleuth and archaeologist Amelia Peabody. ==Plot summary== In 1922, the Emersons are excavating at Deir el Medina when a melodramatic visitor delivers a challenge\u2014and a solid gold ancient statuette\u2014to them: find out where it came from and why it brings bad luck to its owners. Emerson, of course, doesn't believe in curses, but he does believe someone has robbed a find of historic proportions. When their visitor turns up dead and her stepchildren disappear, everyone except the Emersons believe the murder is a family affair. Ramses, meanwhile, finds a papyrus which he suspects to be of historic importance, and an assistant who is not all he seems. ==Title== The book's title is from the Poetical Stela of Thutmose III: :\"I have robbed their nostrils of the breath of life and made the dread of you fill their hearts. My serpent on your brow consumed them.\" ==See also== *List of characters in the Amelia Peabody series Category:Amelia Peabody Category:2005 American novels Category:Historical mystery novels Category:Fiction set in 1922 Category:Novels set in the 1920s Category:Novels set in Egypt Category:HarperCollins books ",
