    "text": "Tuaopepe John Joseph Ah Kuoi (born 14 July 1957) is a former Samoan rugby union player. He played as a centre. ==Career== John Ah Kuoi comes from a prominent Samoan family, with Chinese heritage as well. He came to Auckland as a 12-year-old for his schooling, but kept his ties with Samoa, representing the country in 12 rugby tests in the 1980s.John Ah Kuoi at Ah Kuoi Kirwan Insurance He played for Auckland in the NPC in the 1980s. His first cap for Samoa was during a match against Fiji, at Suva, on 22 August 1987 and his last cap was against Tonga, at Tokyo, on 11 April 1990. ==Personal life== On leaving school, he gained a private pilot licence, but the career in aviation he had hoped for didn\u2019t materialise. He married his high school girlfriend and got his first taste of insurance, as a salesman. The couple moved to Italy for a year, where John played rugby with his brother in law, All Black John Kirwan. After returning to New Zealand, John work in a business that sells uniforms, soon branching out with his own sports uniform business. Together with Sue, he ran this business for 19 years. In 2009, he came full circle \u2013 returning to his first job as insurance advisor, this time with the Maurice Trapp Group. His reasoning was simple: Not everyone needs uniforms, but everyone needs insurance! Now a Registered Financial Advisor (RFA), John enjoys what he does. \u201cI love it \u2013 it\u2019s about helping people. There\u2019s a tremendous feelgood element when you\u2019ve done something and see how relieved clients are when they realise they\u2019re covered, on their budget.\u201d When he\u2019s not working, John loves a round of golf, and has kept active in rugby coaching for many years. ==References== ==External links== *John Ah Kuoi international statistics *John Joseph Ah Kuoi at New Zealand Rugby History Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Samoan rugby union players Category:Rugby union centres Category:Samoan expatriates in New Zealand Category:Samoan people of Chinese descent Category:Samoa international rugby union players Category:Auckland rugby union players ",
