    "text": "Day 1 building in Seattle, Washington Amazon is an American technology company that has a multinational presence with offices and facilities around the world. The company is based in Seattle, Washington, United States, and has 750,000 total employees. == Headquarters == Amazon's former headquarters in the Pacific Medical Center building in Beacon Hill, Seattle Amazon's global headquarters are in more than 40 owned and leased buildings spread across Seattle's adjacent South Lake Union, Denny Triangle, and Downtown neighborhoods. The first 14 buildings Amazon occupied in South Lake Union were developed primarily by Vulcan, Inc. from 2008 onward, the first 11 of which were acquired from Vulcan in 2012 at a cost of $1.16 billion. The company was previously headquartered in rented space within the Pacific Medical Center, located in the city's Beacon Hill neighborhood, from 1998 to 2011. Amazon is currently building a new four tower, four low-rise, complex in Seattle's Denny Triangle neighborhood to serve as the primary headquarters, though it will retain many of the earlier purchased buildings to house its more than 45,000 corporate employees in the Seattle area. The plan for the new campus, designed by NBBJ and named \"Rufus 2.0\" after a dog who was part of the company in its early days, was approved by the city of Seattle in 2012 and construction began the year after. The first of the towers, nicknamed Doppler, opened on December 14, 2015. ===Other major campuses=== The European headquarters are in Luxembourg's capital, Luxembourg City. On November 13, 2018, Amazon announced that it would divide the planned HQ2 between New York City and Northern Virginia. On February 14, 2019, Amazon canceled its plan for the HQ2 location in New York City. Amazon is also in the process of building a retail hub of operations center in Nashville, Tennessee. On August 21, 2019, Amazon opened its largest campus in the world at Nanakramguda in Hyderabad, India. It is the first Amazon-owned campus located outside the United States and features the single largest Amazon-owned building in the world. The 9.5 acre campus houses over 15,000 employees. Amazon plans to build a major campus in Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, that will host 15,000 employees by 2025. The company opened its first Bellevue office in 2017, marking a return to the city since the company was founded there in 1995. The Bellevue campus will include the 43-story Bellevue 600 tower, which is planned to be the tallest building in the city and the tallest to be developed by Amazon. == Software development centers == While much of Amazon's software development occurs in Seattle, the company employs software developers in centers across the globe. Some of these sites are run by an Amazon subsidiary called A2Z Development. * North America ** United States *** Austin, TX *** Cambridge, MA *** Cupertino, CA *** Detroit, MI *** Gurnee, IL *** Herndon, VA *** Irvine, CA *** Minneapolis, MN *** New York, NY (Manhattan West, Herald Square, Fifth Avenue) *** Pittsburgh, PA *** San Francisco, CA *** San Luis Obispo, CA *** Seattle, WA *** Tempe, AZ ** Canada *** Vancouver, BC *** Toronto, ON *Central America **Costa Rica * Europe ** Austria ***Graz ** Germany ***Berlin ***Dresden ***Aachenhttps://www.amazon.jobs/es/landing_pages/amazon-aachen-development- center ** Ireland ***Dublin ** Poland ***Gda\u0144sk ** Romania *** Bucharest *** Ia\u0219i ** Spain ***Madrid ***Barcelonahttps://www.aboutamazon.eu/press- release/amazon-to-open-a-new-research-and-development-centre-in-barcelona- focused-on-machine-learning ** United Kingdom ***Cambridge ***Edinburgh ***London * Asia **Israel ***Tel Aviv ***Haifa **India ***Bangalore ***Hyderabad ***New Delhi ***Chennai * Africa ** South Africa *** Cape Town == Customer service centers == Customer Service Center in Huntington, West Virginia * Africa ** South Africa *** Cape TownAmazon chooses 1stream call center solutions for South Africa , Retrieved, February 1, 2012. * Europe ** United Kingdom *** Edinburgh ** Ireland *** Cork * Central America ** Costa Rica *** San Jose * South America ** Colombia *** Bogot\u00e1 * North America ** Grand Forks, North Dakota ** Huntington, West Virginia ** Kennewick, Washington ** Winchester, Kentucky (LEX11) == Retail == Below is a list of Amazon's retail locations, as of October 2018. Most of the stores are located inside of the United States, but Whole Foods also operates stores in Canada and the United Kingdom. * Whole Foods Market (479) * 365 by Whole Foods Market (10) * Amazon Books (17) * Amazon Go (5 open, 2 under construction) * Amazon 4-Star (3) - a collection of new and trending items from Amazon.com that are rated four stars or higher * Amazon Pop-Up (81) - small kiosks which sell Amazon devices such as Echo speakers, Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, and Fire TV devices, usually housed in malls, all closed in May 2019 == Pick-up points == In addition to Amazon Lockers, Amazon has around 30 staffed pick-up points in the United States and over 800 independent ones in India. The US locations have large sets of Amazon Lockers and an area for customers to make returns. The India locations are in existing retailers and have customers wait for a store employee to retrieve their package. The company also operates 33 Treasure Trucks in the United States and United Kingdom, which serve as pick- up points for one deal per day that customers can order using the Amazon app. == Fulfillment and warehousing == Amazon fulfillment centers are large facilities with hundreds of employees, sometimes thousands. Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand- held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. A picker may walk 10 or more miles a day. In newer fulfillment centers, items are stored on pods and brought to pickers by robots (Amazon Robotics). In the United Kingdom initial staffing was provided by Randstad Holding and other temporary employment agencies. In the United States, many workers are hired as Amazon employees and granted shares of stock or sign-on bonuses, while others are offered temporary seasonal positions. \"When we have permanent positions available, we look to the top performing temporary associates to fill them,\" said an Amazon spokesperson. Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, a warehouse automation company, in 2012. Amazon fulfillment centers can also provide warehousing and order-fulfillment for third-party sellers, for an extra fee.Fulfillment by Amazon from the company's website Third-party sellers can use Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to ship for other platforms as well, such as eBay or their own websites.[FBA - Multi- Channel Fulfillment FBM or FBA] Retrieved April 16, 2015. On March 20, 2020, Amazon agreed to remove metal detectors from its warehouses after a warehouse worker tested positive for COVID-19 In addition to removing metal detectors, Amazon also agreed to enact a \"6 feet rule,\" which will enforce a six-feet distance between warehouse employees. ===North America=== ====United States==== Fulfillment centers are located in the following cities and are often named after an International Air Transport Association airport code (Fulfillment Center Codes). Sortation centers are regional warehouses where Amazon packages are sorted to a last mile carrier, typically either Amazon Logistics or the United States Postal Service. This list includes Amazon fulfillment centers and sortation centers, but excludes other types of Amazon warehouses such as Amazon Logistics delivery stations, Prime Now warehouses, or Amazon Fresh
