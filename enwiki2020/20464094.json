He is the brother of fellow strongman and former holder of the title \"Britain's Strongest Man\", Richard Gosling. ==Stafford Superior Strongman== In 2007 Mick Gosling approached Stafford Borough Council in order to try to promote a strongman competition in the area and to raise its profile amongst the young. The result was the Stafford Superior Strongman 2007 held at Rowley Park, Stafford. The event was well received and well attended by some of the foremost British strongmen of the time. There were 18 competitors, some men having competed at past World's Strongest Man competitions such as Mark Felix (who won the event), Mark Westaby and Laurence Shahlaei. The quality of the event was further enhanced by being overseen by the former British, European and World's Strongest Man, Geoff Capes. ==References== ==External links== * UK Strongman to Tackle Stafford Half Marathon Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:English strength athletes Category:People from Cannock ",
