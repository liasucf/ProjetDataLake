    "text": "Jeremiah 41 is the forty-first chapter of the Book of Jeremiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains prophecies attributed to the prophet Jeremiah, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. This chapter is part of a narrative section consisting of chapters 37 to 44. Chapter 41 recounts the murder of Gedaliah, the Babylonian governor of occupied Judah, and the chaotic situation which followed this event. Jeremiah himself is not mentioned in this chapter. ==Text== The original text was written in Hebrew. This chapter is divided into 18 verses. ===Verse numbering=== The order of chapters and verses of the Book of Jeremiah in the English Bibles, Masoretic Text (Hebrew), and Vulgate (Latin), in some places differs from that in the Septuagint (LXX, the Greek Bible used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and others) according to Rahlfs or Brenton. The following table is taken with minor adjustments from Brenton's Septuagint, page 971. The order of Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint/Scriptural Study (CATSS) based on Alfred Rahlfs' Septuaginta (1935) differs in some details from Joseph Ziegler's critical edition (1957) in G\u00f6ttingen LXX. Swete's Introduction mostly agrees with Rahlfs edition (=CATSS). {| class=wikitable !Hebrew, Vulgate, English!!Rahlfs' LXX (CATSS) |- |align=center|41:1-18 |align=center|48:1-18 |- |align=center|34:1-22 |align=center|41:1-22 |} ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint (with a different chapter and verse numbering), made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). ==Parashot== The parashah sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.As reflected in the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English Jeremiah 41 is a part of the \"Sixteenth prophecy (Jeremiah 40-45)\" in the section of Prophecies interwoven with narratives about the prophet's life (Jeremiah 26-45). {P}: open parashah; {S}: closed parashah. : {P} 41:1-10 {S} 41:11-15 {S} 41:16-18 {P} ==Verse 1== :Now it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and of the officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. And there they ate bread together in Mizpah. NKJV *\"Family\": lit. \"seed\"Note [a] on Jeremiah 41:1 in New King James Version Ishmael and his men murdered Gedaliah and others in Mizpah during a mealtime when the covenant community is celebrated and the people were less guarded. ==Verse 2== :Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. Jubilee Bible 2000 *\"Smote Gedaliah\": The day when Gedaliah was murdered (the third day of the seventh month) was remembered as a fast day by the post-Captivity Jews (Zechariah 7:5; Zechariah 8:19), because on that day the hope of living a separate life in the promised land vanished, and the murder was likely avenged by a third deportation of Jews as mentioned in Jeremiah 52:30.Exell, Joseph S.; Spence-Jones, Henry Donald Maurice (Editors).

NKJV Johanan led a group to defeat Ishmael at Gibeon, southwest of Mizpah (), freeing their captives after Ishmael and 8 others escaped to Ammon (). ==See also== *Babylon *Bethlehem *Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Saphan *Ishmael son of Nethaniah *Jerusalem *Mizpah *Related Bible part: Jeremiah 40, Jeremiah 42, Jeremiah 52 ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * ==External links== ===Jewish=== *Jeremiah 41 Hebrew with Parallel English ===Christian=== *Jeremiah 41, English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate 41 ",
