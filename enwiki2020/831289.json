    "text": "FC Flora, commonly known as Flora Tallinn, or simply as Flora, is a professional football club based in Tallinn, Estonia, that competes in the Meistriliiga, the top flight of Estonian football. The club's home ground is A. Le Coq Arena. Formed in 1990, Flora were founding members of the Meistriliiga, and are one of two clubs which have never been relegated from the Estonian top division, along with Narva Trans. Flora have won more trophies than any other club in Estonian football, with a record 12 Meistriliiga titles, eight Estonian Cups and a record ten Estonian Supercups. ==History== ===Early history (1990\u20132000)=== Flora was founded on 10 March 1990 by Aivar Pohlak as an effort to revive Estonian football during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The team was mainly based on players from L\u00f5vid youth team. Flora finished their first season in last place and were relegated. The situation changed after the formation of the Meistriliiga in 1992. After 52 years of foreign occupation, Estonian clubs could once again play for the Estonian League Championship title. Flora finished the inaugural season of the Meistriliiga in fourth place. After the first season, the league was reformed to run from Autumn to Spring. Flora finished the 1992\u201393 season as runners-up. In 1993, Roman Ubakivi was appointed as manager. One round before the end of the 1993\u201394 season, Tevalte, who led the Meistriliiga table at the time, was controversially disqualified over allegations of match fixing. The season ended with Flora and Norma both on equal 36 points. Flora won the championship play-off match 5\u20132 and was awarded their first league title. The club made their European debut in the 1994\u201395 UEFA Cup, losing to Odense 0\u20136 on aggregate in the preliminary round. Flora managed to defend the league title in the 1994\u201395 season and won the 1994\u201395 Estonian Cup, defeating Lantana-Marlekor 2\u20130 in the final. In January 1996, Teitur Thordarson replaced Ubakivi as manager. Disappointing start in the 1995\u201396 season left the team in second place. Flora finished the 1996\u201397 season as runners-up once again. In the 1997\u201398 season, the club won their first league title under Thordarson. Subsequently, the league format was changed and Flora managed win another title in the same calendar year. Flora made their debut in the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the 1998\u201399 season, narrowly losing to Steaua Bucure\u0219ti 4\u20135 on aggregate in the first qualifying round. The club added another Estonian Cup trophy after defeating Lantana 3\u20132 in the finals. Since 1999, Meistriliiga adopted the current league format with the season running from Spring to Autumn within a single calendar year. The 1999 season was unsuccessful as Flora placed third. In 2000, Tarmo R\u00fc\u00fctli was appointed as manager. Under R\u00fc\u00fctli, Flora finished the 2000 season as runners-up, behind Levadia who won the title without a single loss. ===New stadium and a new era (2001\u20132009)=== In 2001, a new era began for Flora as the club moved to the new A. Le Coq Arena and R\u00fc\u00fctli was replaced by Arno Pijpers. Under Pijpers, Flora won three consecutive Meistriliiga titles in 2001, 2002 and 2003. In the 2003 season, Flora won the league without losing a single league match, extending their unbeaten run from the previous season to 37, while Tor Henning Hamre scored a record 39 goals in a season. Pijpers left Flora in September 2004, before the end of the 2004 season, and was replaced by Janno Kivisild. The team failed to defend the league title for another season, finishing in third place. The 2005 season was unsuccessful as Flora placed fourth, 26 points behind the league champions TVMK. This was the first time Flora didn't win a Meistriliiga medal since 1992. After the disappointing season, Kivisild was replaced by Pasi Rautiainen. In the 2006\u201307 UEFA Cup, Flora defeated Lyn Oslo 1\u20131 on aggregate on away goals in the first qualifying round, before losing to Br\u00f8ndby 0\u20134 on aggregate in the second qualifying round. The club finished the 2006 season in third place and placed second in the 2007 season. In 2007, Flora also suffered their biggest margin of defeat in the Meistriliiga thus far, losing 0\u20136 to TVMK. Flora finished the 2008 season as runners-up, behind Levadia once again, despite amassing 91 points and scoring 113 goals. Tarmo R\u00fc\u00fctli returned to Flora for the 2009 season, but failed to lead the club to winning the league, placing fourth. Flora were more successful in the Estonian Cup, winning the trophy in 2008 and 2009. ===Recent history (2010\u2013present)=== In 2010, R\u00fc\u00fctli was replaced by the former Flora player and Estonia national team record cap holder Martin Reim. Under Reim, rejuvenated Flora ended the reign of Levadia who had won the four previous Meistriliiga titles and won the league in the 2010 season. Flora successfully defended their title in the 2011 season and won the 2010\u201311 Estonian Cup, defeating Narva Trans 2\u20130 in the final. Flora finished the 2012 season in third place, behind the champions N\u00f5mme Kalju and Levadia. After the season, Reim left the club and was replaced Marko Lelov in December 2012. Lelov won the 2012\u201313 Estonian Cup, but was sacked in July 2013 after disappointing results in the league. He was replaced by Norbert Hurt, initially as a caretaker, with position being made permanent later. Flora finished the 2013 season in fourth place and placed third in 2014. In 2015, Flora celebrated their 25th anniversary by winning their 10th league title in the 34th round of the season. The club also won the 2015\u201316 Estonian Cup, defeating Sillam\u00e4e Kalev 3\u20130 in extra time in the final. In May 2016, Aivar Pohlak resigned from the club's presidency and was succeeded by his son Pelle Pohlak. In the first qualifying round of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League, Flora lost to Lincoln Red Imps 2\u20133 on aggregate, after which Hurt resigned and was replaced by Argo Arbeiter. Flora finished the disappointing 2016 season in fourth place. Arbeiter was sacked and in January 2017, Arno Pijpers to take over as manager. In the 2017 season, Flora won their 11th Meistriliiga title. In December 2017, it was announced that Pijpers will not continue as manager and J\u00fcrgen Henn was appointed in his place in January 2018. Under Henn, Flora won the 2019 Meistriliiga title. ==Crest and colours== Flora crest features the Greco-Roman goddess Flora, after whom the club is named.
