They work in the island's Colosseum and protect the island from silly villains. ==Characters== * Fracas: The gladiator group's athletic and handsome leader. He is vain and obsessed with his appearance. * Arena: A strong and agile female gladiator with red hair. She is intelligent but rather reckless. * Rumpus: A very kind and large gladiator with the strength to lift rocks with just one hand. He is not very quick-witted. * Hocus: The group's shortest member with a knack for coming up with good ideas. He is very logical. * Sinus: An eight-year-old boy who governs Cornucopia. He is very responsible for his age. ==Episodes== #\"The Art of Deception\" #\"Sporadicus\" #\"The Blooms of Doom\" #\"The Littlest Gladiator\" #\"Babies in Gladiatorland\" #\"The Unhappy Birthday Present\" #\"The Revenge of the Gladiator Girls\" #\"Cornucopia Beach Resort\" #\"Hydra Go Seek\" #\"The Host\" #\"Honeymoon on Sight\" #\"The Unicorn Conspiracy\" #\"No Roman Is an Island\" #\"The End of the Game\" #\"The Dregs from Rome\" #\"An Eye for an Eye\" #\"Heavenly Spoiled Brats\" #\"Sea No Evil, Head No Evil\" #\"The Cyclops Who Would Be Queen\" #\"The Longest Battle\" #\"Brute Is Beautiful\" #\"Experience Teaches (Live and Learn)\" #\"The Best Lion of the Empire\" #\"Magnusson's Little Helpers\" #\"Ave Sinus Caesar\" #\"Something Wacky This Way Comes\" #Gladiator Academy: The TV Movie ==References== ==External links== * Gladiator Academy on BRB.es * Category:2000s animated television series Category:2000s children's television series Category:2000s Spanish television series Category:2002 Spanish television series debuts Category:Spanish children's animated action television series Category:Spanish children's animated adventure television series Category:Spanish children's animated comedy television series Category:Spanish children's animated fantasy television series ",
