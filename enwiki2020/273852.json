    "text": "Whoracle is the third studio album by Swedish metal band In Flames, released on 18 November 1997. The title of the album is a portmanteau of the English words \"whore\" and \"oracle\". Apart from \"Everything Counts\", which is a cover of a Depeche Mode song, all songs were composed and arranged by In Flames. The lyrics were translated by Dark Tranquillity guitarist Niklas Sundin, after Anders Frid\u00e9n had written them in Swedish. Whoracle is the final album to feature Johan Larsson and Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m. It is also the last In Flames release with Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte playing drums, as he permanently switched to lead guitar in future releases. Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m noted that it was not easy to record at times, since the band members usually preferred drinking beer and playing Tekken 3.At the Gates \u2013 Flames of the End DVD Fredrik Nordst\u00f6rm interview == Concept == Whoracle is a concept album which describes the past, present, and a hypothetical future of the planet Earth. \"Jotun\" is a foreshadowing of the main concepts where a society is crushed and broken after an apocalyptic event. \"Episode 666\" seems to be the narration of this apocalyptic event which is, perversely, televised. The songs leading up to this tell a story of the rise and fall of a global society. \"The Hive\" and \"Jester Script Transfigured\" describe this technologically advanced society and a utopian world which is demolished by human nature in the next two songs. The inclusion of the Depeche Mode cover, \"Everything Counts\", is a poignant way to imply that the people who built then destroyed their society realized their folly after it was too late. ==Track listing== All lyrics written by Niklas Sundin and Anders Frid\u00e9n. ==Personnel== ;In Flames *Anders Frid\u00e9n \u2013 vocals, additional percussion *Jesper Str\u00f6mblad \u2013 lead guitar, keyboards, additional percussion *Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m \u2013 rhythm guitar *Johan Larsson \u2013 bass *Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte \u2013 drums, percussion and additional lead guitar ;Other personnel *Ulrika Netterdahl \u2013 female vocals on song \"Whoracle\" *The Whoracle concept conjured and verbalized by Niklas Sundin and Anders Frid\u00e9n *Lyrics written by Niklas Sundin following original synopsis by Anders Frid\u00e9n *All music composed and arranged by In Flames except \"Everything Counts\" by Martin Lee Gore of Depeche Mode *Recorded and produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m with assistance from In Flames *Engineered by Anders Frid\u00e9n and Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m *Mixed by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m and Anders Frid\u00e9n *Mastered by Goran Finnberg and Fredrik Nordstrom at the Mastering Room Gbg *Cover artwork by Andreas Marschall *Photos by Kenneth Johansson *All songs published by Prophecies Publishing Hamburg except \"Everything Counts\" *\"Everything Counts\" published by Grabbing Hands Music Ltd, sub-published by EMI Music Germany ==References== Category:In Flames albums Category:Nuclear Blast albums Category:1997 albums Category:Concept albums Category:Albums recorded at Studio Fredman Category:Albums produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m ",
