    "text": "Chao is a surname in various cultures. It is the Pinyin spelling of two Chinese surnames ( and ), the Wade\u2013Giles spelling of two others ( or the much rarer , both spelled in Pinyin as Zh\u00e0o), and a regional or other spelling of two additional Chinese surnames ( C\u00e1o and Zh\u014du). It is also a Galician and Portuguese surname. ==Origins== ===Chinese surname Ch\u00e1o (\u6641)=== This surname is written with a character meaning \"dawn\" (). According to traditional sources including Fengsu Tongyi, Yuanhe Xingzuan, Xingshi Kaol\u00fce (\u59d3\u6c0f\u8003\u7565), and the surnames/clans section (\u6c0f\u65cf\u7565) of Tongzhi, both this surname and another written with a character also meaning \"dawn\" () originated from personal names of people during the Spring and Autumn period, and were adopted by their descendants as surnames, following which some descendants changed their surname from one character to the other. The latter surname originated from , a son of King Jing of Zhou (544\u2013519 BC), while the former originated from Shi Chao () of the state of Wei. The biography of Chao Cuo in the Records of the Grand Historian stated that the surname originated in the Nanyang Commandery, specifically in the ancient region of Xi'e. In Sino-Korean pronunciation, those characters are both read Jo, but are not used as surnames in modern Korea (the Korean surname Jo is written with different characters). In Sino- Vietnamese pronunciation, it is read Tri\u1ec1u; the spelling is distinct from Tri\u1ec7u, the Sino-Vietnamese reading of the surname Zh\u00e0o (\u8d99/\u8d75). It is listed on the Hundred Family Surnames poem. ===Chinese surname Ch\u00e1o (\u5de2)=== Another Chinese surname, homophonous with the above in Mandarin, is written with a character meaning \"nest\" (). Traditional sources note two different origins for this surname. The Xingpu (\u59d3\u8b5c) states that it refers to the legendary Youchao, who purportedly lived in a nest high up in a tree before he invented houses; his name literally means \"having a nest\". The Xingshi Kaol\u00fce (\u59d3\u6c0f\u8003\u7565) states that it originated as a toponymic surname referring to the state of Chao; following the defeat of the state of Chao by the state of Wu during the latter part of the Spring and Autumn period, some of the people of the defeated state adopted Chao as their surname. In Sino-Korean pronunciation, this character is read So, but it is not used as a surname in modern Korea (the Korean surname So is written with different characters). In Sino- Vietnamese pronunciation, it is read S\u00e0o. ===Other=== Chao is also an alternative spelling of four other Chinese surnames, listed below by their spelling in Pinyin; see those articles for the traditional origins of those surnames: *Zh\u00e0o (), a common Chinese surname, spelled Chao in the Wade\u2013Giles romanisation system *Zh\u00e0o (), a much rarer surname also spelled Chao in Wade\u2013Giles *Zh\u014du (), spelled Chao based on its pronunciation in Cantonese (). This spelling is common in Macau. *C\u00e1o (), sometimes spelled in non-standard fashion as Chao Chao may also be a Portuguese and Galician surname, derived from Galician-Portuguese ', meaning \"plain\" or \"plateau\". ==Statistics== In the Third National Population Census of the People's Republic of China in 1982, Ch\u00e1o meaning \"dawn\" (\u6641) was found to be the 361st-most-common surname, while Ch\u00e1o meaning \"nest\" (\u5de2) was 420th-most-common. Zh\u00e0o (\u8d99/\u8d75) was the seventh-most-common surname, but it is not spelled Chao in mainland China. In Taiwan, where that latter surname frequently is spelled Chao, it was the 43rd- most-common surname in 2005, according to a survey of household registration data by the Ministry of the Interior that year. In Spain, statistics of the stated that there were 2,703 people with the surname Chao in Galicia, making it the 244th-most-common surname there.
