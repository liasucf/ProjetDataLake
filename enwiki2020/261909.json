    "text": "The Midwest Conference (MWC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA's Division III. Member institutions are located in the Midwestern United States in the states of Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Midwest Conference was created in 1994 with the merger of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference, which had been sponsoring men's sports since 1921, and the Midwest Athletic Conference for Women, which was formed in 1977. ==History== The organization of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference (MCAC) was conceived at a meeting at Coe College on May 12, 1921. Charter members were Beloit College, Carleton College, Coe College, Cornell College, Knox College (Illinois) and Lawrence University. Hamline University and Millikin University joined the league in December 1921, but both of them later withdrew: Hamline after the 1929\u201330 academic year, and Millikin after the 1924\u201325 academic year. Ripon College joined the conference in 1923, followed by Monmouth College in 1924, Grinnell College in 1940 and Lake Forest College in 1974. Illinois College and St. Norbert College joined in 1982 and Carroll University followed in 1992. Carleton withdrew following the 1982\u201383 academic year. St. Olaf College also competed in the conference from 1952 to 74, as did the University of Chicago from 1976 to 1987. Coe and Cornell withdrew following the 1996\u201397 academic year with Cornell rejoining the league starting in the 2012\u201313 year. Macalester College joined as a football-only member starting in 2014. The University of Chicago returned as a football-only member in 2017, and added baseball to its conference membership in the 2019 season (2018\u201319 school year). The MWC split into North and South divisions for football, men's and women's tennis, baseball, and softball from 2012 through 2016. Divisional play ended with the departure of Carroll after the 2015\u201316 school year,http://www.jsonline.com/sports/statecolleges/carroll-university- leaving-midwest-conference-for-cciw-b99256013z1-256783281.html and resumed for football only with the addition of the University of Chicago as an affiliate member for the 2017\u201318 season. ==Member schools== ===Current members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Institution !Location (population) !Nickname !Founded !Type (all private) !Enrollment !Joined !Colors |- |Beloit College |Beloit, Wisconsin (36,966) |Buccaneers |1846 |Nonsectarian |1,358 |1921 |College Blue & Vegas Gold |- |Cornell College |Mount Vernon, Iowa (3,390) |Rams |1853 |United Methodist |1,176 |1921 2012 |Purple & White |- |Grinnell College |Grinnell, Iowa (9,218) |Pioneers |1846 |Nonsectarian |1,638 |1940 |Scarlet & Black |- |Illinois College |Jacksonville, Illinois (19,446) |Blueboys (men's) Lady Blues (women's) |1829 |UCC & PCUSA |903 |1982 |Blue & White |- |Knox College |Galesburg, Illinois (32,195) |Prairie Fire |1837 |Nonsectarian |1,399 |1921 |Purple & Gold |- |Lake Forest College |Lake Forest, Illinois (21,300) |Foresters |1857 |Nonsectarian |1,395 |1974 |Red & Black |- |Lawrence University |Appleton, Wisconsin (78,086) |Vikings |1847 |Nonsectarian |1,489 |1921 |Blue & White |- |Monmouth College |Monmouth, Illinois (9,244) |Fighting Scots |1853 |Presbyterian (PCUSA) |1,300 |1924 |Red & White |- |Ripon College |Ripon, Wisconsin (6,828) |Red Hawks |1851 |Nonsectarian |967 |1923 |Red & White |- | |De Pere, Wisconsin (20,559) |Green Knights |1898 |Catholic (Premonstratensians) |2,095 |1982 |Dartmouth Green & Old Gold |} ;Notes ===Affiliate members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Institution !Location !Nickname !Founded !Type !Enrollment !Joined !MWC sport !Primary conference |-bgcolor=#ffa0a0 |Macalester College |Saint Paul, Minnesota |Scots |1874 |Private |2,221 |2014 |football |MIAC |- | |Chicago, Illinois |Maroons |1890 |Private |13,400 |2017 (football) 2018 (baseball) |football, baseball |UAA |} ;Notes * Chicago had been a full conference member from 1976\u20131987. * Macalester football will return to its full-time conference home of the MIAC in 2021. ===Former members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Institution !Location !Nickname !Founded !Type !Enrollment !Joined !Left !Current conference |- |Carleton College |Northfield, Minnesota |Knights |1866 |Private |2,105 |1921 |1983 |MIAC |- | Carroll University | Waukesha, Wisconsin | Pioneers | 1846 | Private/Presbyterian (PCUSA) | 2,789 | 1992 | 2016 | CCIW |- | |Chicago, Illinois |Maroons |1890 |Private |13,400 | 1976 | 1987 |UAA |- |Coe College |Cedar Rapids, Iowa |Kohawks |1851 |Private/Presbyterian (PCUSA) |1,355 |1921 |1997 |ARC |- |Hamline University |St. Paul, Minnesota |Pipers |1854 |Private/Methodist |1,944 |1922 |1930 |MIAC |- |Millikin University |Decatur, Illinois |Big Blue |1901 |Private/Presbyterian (PCUSA) |2,200 |1922 |1925 |CCIW |- |St. Olaf College |Northfield, Minnesota |Oles |1874 |Private/Lutheran (ELCA) |2,900 |1952 |1974 |MIAC |} ===Membership timeline=== ==Sports== , the MWC sponsors the following sports: {| class=\"wikitable\" style= |+ Conference sports !Sport||Men's||Women's |- |Baseball|||| |- |Basketball|||| |- |Cross country|||| |- |Football|||| |- |Golf|||| |- |Indoor track |||| |- |Outdoor track |||| |- |Soccer|||| |- |Softball || || |- |Swimming & Diving |||| |- |Tennis || || |- |Volleyball|| || |} ==Conference facilities== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !School !Football field !Capacity !Basketball arena !Capacity !Baseball field |- |Beloit |Strong Stadium |3,000 |Flood Arena |2,500 |Ballpark at Strong Stadium |- |Chicago |Stagg Field |1,650 | colspan=2 align=center | Member only in football and baseball | J.
