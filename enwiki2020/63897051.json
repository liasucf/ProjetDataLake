Her mother, Avgusta \u0160antel, was a painter, and provided initial education for Henrika at home. Her sister, Avgusta \u0160antel Jr., was a painter as well. In 1891, Henrika moved to Munich to study at the women art academy (Damenacademie) with Friedrich Fehr and Ludwig Schmid-Reutte. She subsequently returned to Gorizia and taught art. After World War I, Gorizia was transferred to Italy, and \u0160antel with the whole family moved to Maribor, which was in Yugoslavia. In 1929, she moved to Ljubljana, where she stayed until her death. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1940 deaths Category:19th-century Slovenian painters Category:20th-century Slovenian painters Category:20th-century women artists Category:19th-century women artists Category:Slovenian women artists ",
