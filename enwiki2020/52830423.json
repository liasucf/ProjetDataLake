He then left Paris for the Isle of Man where he settled in the capital, Douglas, a town of barely more than 20,000 inhabitants. He devotes himself only to the writing between two voyages. French detesting France, a specialist in the period from Napoleon III to the First World War (which he considers to be \"an accident that is incomprehensible to me, I try to understand what could have provoked this manifestation of the death instinct of the West and I like to dream what would have been this century without the war\"), he particularly likes to depict with many details the lives of artists going through this era. The \u00c9ditions du Seuil published a novelization of the film he cowrote, Children of the Century, devoted to the love affair between George Sand and Alfred de Musset. == Bibliography == *1977: Le Regard du voyageur, Stock *1981: L'Enfant d'\u00c9douard, Mercure de France prix M\u00e9dicis 1981 *1985: S\u00e9bastien Dor\u00e9, Mercure de France, prix Marcel Proust 1986, prix Bertrand de Jouvenel of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise *1988:La Gare de Wannsee, Grasset, Grand prix du roman de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise 1988) *1991: Andr\u00e9e Putman, \u00c9ditions du Regard *1991: Le Jour de l'\u00e9clipse, Grasset *1995: L'Heure de gloire, Grasset *1999: Les Enfants du si\u00e8cle, Le Seuil *2001: Le Passeur, Stock *2003: Le Plaisir de la d\u00e9ception, Stock *2003: Grand H\u00f4tel du Pacifique, \u00c9ditions du Rocher *2004: Princesse Marie, Le Seuil *2006: Le Faux Pli, Gallimard ==Filmography == as screenwriter: * Children of the Century by Diane Kurys * Absolument fabuleux by Gabriel Aghion * Nuit noire 17 octobre 1961 by * Nathalie... by Anne Fontaine * The Princess of Montpensier by Bertrand Tavernier * ' by Beno\u00eet Jacquot == External links == * Fran\u00e7ois-Olivier Rousseau on Babelio * Fran\u00e7ois-Olivier Rousseau on Allaty \u00c9ditions * Fran\u00e7ois Olivier Rousseau: Le plaisir de la d\u00e9ception video on INA.fr (24 February 2003) * Fran\u00e7ois-Olivier Rousseau on the site of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise * Category:20th-century French journalists Category:20th-century French writers Category:21st-century French writers Category:French screenwriters Category:Prix M\u00e9dicis winners Category:1947 births Category:People from Boulogne-Billancourt Category:Living people ",
