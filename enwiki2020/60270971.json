    "text": "The Frente de Estudiantes Sindicalistas (FES) (English: Front of Syndicalist Students) was a Spanish student group belonging to the Falangist minority opposition to the Francoist regime. Founded in 1963 in Madrid, the FES was led by Jorge Perales, and Jos\u00e9 Real. Initially operating as the student arm of the Frente Nacional de Trabajadores (FNT; \"National Front of Workers\"), its mottos were Falange s\u00ed, Movimiento no (\"Yes to Falange, No to Movement\"); Falange s\u00ed, dictadura no (\"Yes to Falange, no to dictatorship\") and Por la reconstrucci\u00f3n de Falange (\"For the re-building of Falange\"). It eventually developed intense conflict with its matrix organization, the FNT, led by Narciso Perales, that transformed into the Revolutionary Syndicalist Front. The FES was the seed of Falange Espa\u00f1ola Independiente (FEI). Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, and Juan Diego were members of the organization. == References == == Bibliography == * * * * Category:Falangism Category:Student organisations in Spain ",
