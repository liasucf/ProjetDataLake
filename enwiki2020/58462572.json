    "text": "The Cha\u00f1aral Epimetamorphic Complex is an accretionary complex composed of metamorphic rocks located in western Atacama Region, Chile. The rocks of the complex are mainly micaschist, greenschist and metasediment of low-grade. The deposition of the sedimentary protoliths occurred in the Carboniferous and Permian being later metamorphosed. Among the protoliths of the complex are turbidites and other sediments. Cha\u00f1aral Epimetamorphic Complex is thought to represent the shallow and frontal part of an accretionary prism while the nearby Punta de Choros Metamorphic Complex represents the deeper basal part of the very same accretionary prism. ==References== Category:Geology of Atacama Region Category:Metamorphic complexes Category:Lithodemic units of Chile ",
