    "text": "Gr\u00e9gory Vignal (born 19 July 1981) is a French former professional footballer. A former left full back or midfielder, he is now a first team coach for Olympique de Marseille joining in 2020 after leaving the post of head coach of Rangers W.F.C. in the Scottish Women's Premier League. Vignal played in the top division in five countries \u2013 England, France, Spain, Scotland and Greece \u2013 and in the second tier in a sixth, Germany, though never played in more than 30 league games for any club. At international level, he represented France at under-20 level in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and has also been capped at under-21 level. ==Playing career== ===Liverpool and loans=== Born in Montpellier, Vignal began his career at his home-town club, Montpellier. He soon established a reputation as a promising young player, and was signed by Liverpool in September 2000 for \u00a3500,000. He immediately impressed in his first reserve team outings and made his first team debut against Rotherham United in the FA Cup. He went on to make a further six appearances during the 2000\u201301 season. Vignal returned for the following season having featured in the World Youth Championship with the France Under-18 squad, and staked his claim for the left-back spot with some impressive performances at the start of the 2001\u201302 season. However, he found it hard to displace the reliable and experienced John Arne Riise. He went on to make nine appearances that season. He made just four appearances during the first half of the 2002\u201303 season and was loaned to Bastia for the remainder of the campaign in mid-January 2003. During the 2003\u201304 campaign Vignal was again loaned out to Rennes for the first half of the season, and to Espanyol for the latter half. Vignal had a season in Scotland at Rangers as the club regained the Scottish Premier League title, playing 42 games and picking up a Scottish League Cup winner's medal as well as the league title. ===Portsmouth=== At the end of the 2004\u201305 season Vignal's Liverpool contract expired, and with him available on a free transfer Rangers wanted him to sign a permanent contract with them; however, he failed to agree terms, instead opting to move to Portsmouth. He was then released from Portsmouth after failing to impress Harry Redknapp on his return in the 2005\u201306 season. ===RC Lens and loans=== Vignal then moved to Lens on a free transfer and was loaned out to FC Kaiserslautern for the second half of the season in January 2007. After a trial with the club, Vignal joined Southampton on a season-long loan on 27 July 2007. He scored his first goal for Southampton with a free kick in a 2\u20130 win over Leicester City in the FA Cup, and his first league goal came from a penalty against Scunthorpe United while playing with a broken arm. He scored another penalty in the 2\u20132 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers before being sent off for an off-the-ball incident. However, he later won an appeal against the card. He scored four goals from 23 appearances in the 2007\u201308 season. During the summer of 2009, Vignal had a trial with Queens Park Rangers which did not bring the offer of a contract. ===Birmingham City and later career=== Vignal then played in a friendly match against Sporting Gij\u00f3n as part of a trial with Birmingham City, newly promoted to the Premier League. After producing what manager Alex McLeish described as a \"strong performance\", Vignal signed a one-year contract with the club, with an option for a further year, subject to medical examination. Injury disrupted his season, which combined with the form of Liam Ridgewell at left-back restricted the player to just nine first-team appearances. The club chose not to take up the option of a second year. In July 2010, Vignal had trials with Sheffield United and Cardiff City. In September 2010, he joined Atromitos. He then left the Athens club in December 2010. On 12 September 2012, Vignal signed a contract with Scottish Premier League club Dundee United until January 2013, but left in November without having made a first-team appearance. He returned to France, where he signed for CFA (fourth-tier) club AS B\u00e9ziers ahead of the 2013\u201314 season. ==Coaching career== After a period working with Rangers as a coach for their youth academy teams, in July 2019 Vignal was appointed the head coach of the club's senior Women's team with the incumbent Amy McDonald moving to a role as the overall women's section manager. , he would leave Rangers in August 2020 to take up a first team coaching role at Marseille ==Honours== ===Club=== Liverpool *FA Cup: 2000\u201301 *UEFA Cup: 2000\u201301 *UEFA Super Cup: 2001 Rangers * Scottish League Cup: 2004\u201305 * Scottish Premier League: 2004\u201305 Lens * Ligue 2: 2008\u201309 ===International=== France * UEFA European Under-18 Championship: 2000 ==References== ==External links== * *Liverpool FC profile *LFCHistory.net profile *Beyondthekop.com where are they now Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Montpellier Category:Association football defenders Category:French footballers Category:France youth international footballers Category:France under-21 international footballers Category:Castelnau Le Cr\u00e8s FC players Category:Montpellier HSC players Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:SC Bastia players Category:Stade Rennais F.C. players Category:RCD Espanyol footballers Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:RC Lens players Category:1.
