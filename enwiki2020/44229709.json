Their version was produced by Barry Blue, who had originally written the song. The single peaked at #50 in the UK in June 1992, becoming the group's biggest hit. The trio released two more singles, \"Connect\" and \"Boy In The Moon\" (another song originally done by Margaret Urlich) in 1992 and 1993 respectively, which failed to chart inside the UK top 75. A 10-track album titled Escaping was recorded and set to be released in early 1993, but due to the singles' lack of success it was shelved by the label. === Critical reception === Music & Media wrote in their review that \"this female vocal trio excels with a soulful ballad including a virtually classic chorus reminiscent of Donna Summer's State of Independence.\" Miranda Sawyer from Select noted its \"gloriously syrupy chorus that would do Quincy Jones proud. 'Escaping' slicks and smooches in creditable En Vogue style.\" === Track listing === ; 7\" single # \"Escaping\" (Cool Blue Mix) - 4:46 # \"I Want The Right (To Be Wrong)\" - 4:07 ; 12\" single # \"Escaping\" (A Kiss Across The Sea Mix) - 6:07 # \"Escaping\" (Sleeping Giant Mix) - 5:32 # \"I Want The Right (To Be Wrong)\" - 4:07 ; CD single # \"Escaping\" (Cool Blue Mix) - 4:46 # \"Escaping\" (A Kiss Across The Sea Mix) - 6:07 # \"Escaping\" (Sleeping Giant Mix) - 5:32 # \"I Want The Right (To Be Wrong)\" - 4:07 === Charts === {| class=\"wikitable\" !

For her version, Carroll and producer Nigel Lowis rewrote a good part of the original lyrics, but maintained the same musical structure of the previous versions. The video clip heavily featured a documentary of Balinese people culture and social life. Her first single after a three-year absence, \"Escaping\" became Carroll's highest charting hit in the UK, peaking at No. 3, equalling the position of her ballad \"Don't Be a Stranger\". The B-side, \"Mind Body & Soul\" was a dance track that topped the UK Dance Chart. === Critical reception === Evening Herald commented on the song, that Carroll \"certainly knows how to make a comeback in style\".\"WIRED!\". Evening Herald. 1996-09-23. page 23. Retrieved 2020-04-05. Music & Media wrote, \"Most well-known for her 1993 hit Don't Be A Stranger Dina Caroll is already receiving airplay with this cover version of the Asia Blue song. Don't expect R&B;: this is a well- produced velvety gospel ballad.\" === Track listing === ; CD single # \"Escaping\" (4:45) # \"Escaping\" (DARC By Nature Remix) (5:49) # \"Mind Body & Soul\" (Chicago MVP's Allstar Mix) (7:04) # \"Mind Body & Soul\" (Jere McAllister Final's Remix) (6:34) ; Cassette single, European CD single # \"Escaping\" (Radio Edit) (3:41) # \"Escaping\" (DARC By Nature Remix) (5:49) ; Promo CD single # \"Escaping\" (Radio Edit) (3:41) # \"Escaping\" (Original Mix) (4:45) === Charts === {| class=\"wikitable\" !
