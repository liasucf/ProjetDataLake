The mausoleum is located twenty-one kilometres via asphalt road from near-by Cetinje and it was built on the idea of Croatian sculptor Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107. It was built on the same location of the Njego\u0161 Testament Church which Njego\u0161 had built in 1845 with the intention of being buried there and which he dedicated to his predecessor Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 (who is canonized as Saint Peter of Cetinje in the Serbian Orthodox Church). The church suffered damage from bombardment in both World Wars. In 1974, despite protest from the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral and local Orthodox Christians, the old church was ordered demolished by a commission of the League of Communists of Montenegro led by Veljko Milatovi\u0107 and today's mausoleum was built. ==History== Prior to his death, Njego\u0161 had asked to be buried atop Mount Lov\u0107en, in a chapel dedicated to his predecessor Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161. He had designed himself, and oversaw its construction in 1845. Following his death in October 1851, Njego\u0161 was interred at the Cetinje Monastery. His remains were transferred to Mount Lov\u0107en in 1855. They remained there until 1916, when during the First World War, Montenegro was occupied by Austria-Hungary and the Habsburg occupiers decided to erect a monument to Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph on Mount Lov\u0107en. Not wishing for a monument to the Austrian Emperor to be located on the same perch as a symbol of South Slavic national feeling, Austro-Hungarian authorities demanded that Njego\u0161's remains be moved back to Cetinje. The Montenegrins had little choice in the matter and the remains were removed under the supervision of Serbian Orthodox clergy so that the Austro-Hungarians would not be accused of desecration. By the end of the war, Njego\u0161's chapel was severely damaged. Local authorities negotiated with the Yugoslav government for years over the question of where, when and at whose expense Njego\u0161 was to be buried. Montenegrin officials favoured restoring the original chapel, while the authorities in Belgrade opened a competition over the designs of a planned mausoleum. Some of the plans differed greatly from the original Byzantinesque building. Due to lack of funds, plans for a mausoleum were discarded by 1925 and the original church building was reconstructed. In September 1925, in the course of a three-day ceremony sponsored and attended by Yugoslavia's King Alexander and Queen Maria, the chapel was rededicated and Njego\u0161's remains were reburied. Historian Andrew B. Wachtel writes: \"The tone of the event, which was described extensively in the Yugoslav press, bordered on a piety more appropriate for the treatment of a saint than a writer.\" At the end of the Second World War, Yugoslavia came under communist rule. In 1952, Yugoslavia's communist authorities decided to replace Njego\u0161's chapel with a secular mausoleum designed by Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107. Wachtel suggests that this was done to \"de-Serbianize\" Njego\u0161 and eliminate any trace of the chapel's Byzantine design. In the late 1960s the chapel was demolished, and a mausoleum was constructed by 1971. Njego\u0161's remains were transferred back to Mount Lov\u0107en in 1974, and the mausoleum was officially inaugurated that year. ==Legacy== Njego\u0161 and his burial spot used to be mentioned in the popular Montenegrin Serb folk song Oj, svijetla majska zoro which (with revised lyrics) has been the national anthem of Montenegro since 2004. From 1945 to 1992, the previous Njego\u0161 Testament Church was featured in the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro and from 1992 to 1994 in the coat of arms of the Republic of Montenegro.
