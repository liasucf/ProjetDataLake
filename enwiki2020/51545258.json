He also held the office of Gyaasewahene. He was able to convince Osei Bonsu to make the office of Gyaasewahene able to be inherited by his sons, while such offices had traditionally in Ghana only been inheritable by the sons of the holders' sisters.Ivor Wilks. Asantehen in the 19th-century: The Structure and Evolution of a Political Order. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989. p. 461.
