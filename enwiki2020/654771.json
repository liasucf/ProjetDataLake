    "text": "135 (one hundred [and] thirty-five) is the natural number following 134 and preceding 136. ==In mathematics== This number in base 10 can be expressed in operations using its own digits in at least two different ways. One is as a sum-product number, 135 = (1 + 3 + 5)(1 \\times 3 \\times 5) (1 and 144 share this property) and the other is as the sum of consecutive powers of its digits: 135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 (175, 518, and 598 also have this property). 135 is a Harshad number. There are a total of 135 primes between 1,000 and 2,000. 135 = 11 n^2 + 11 n + 3 for n = 3. This polynomial plays an essential role in Ap\u00e9ry's proof that \\zeta(3) is irrational. ==In the military== * KC-135 Stratotanker is a United States Air Force United States aerial refueling tanker aircraft in service since 1957 * OC-135B Open Skies United States Air Force observation aircraft supports the flies unarmed observation flights over nations of the Treaty on Open Skies * United States Air Force C-135 derived from the Boeing 707 jetliner * was a fleet oiler during World War II * was a United States Navy during World War II * was a United States Navy during World War II * was a United States Navy during World War II * was a during World War II * was a United States Navy during World War II * was an S-class submarine of the United States Navy during World War II * was a United States Navy * was a United States Navy during World War II * was a United States Navy ship during the Battle of Guadalcanal * Electronic Attack Squadron 135 (VAQ-135) is a United States Navy electronic attack squadron stationed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, in Oak Harbor, Washington ==In transportation== * London Buses route 135 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London * 135th Street station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway on St. Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan * 135th Street station on the IRT Lenox Avenue Line of the New York City Subway on Lenox Avenue in Manhattan ==In other fields== * The year AD 135 or 135 BC * 135 AH is a year in the Islamic calendar that corresponds to 752-753 CE * 135 Hertha is a large main belt asteroid which orbits among the Nysa asteroid family * 135 film, the cartridge version of 35mm photographic film, used widely in still photography * The Canon FD 135 mm lens * In astrology, when two planets are 135 degrees apart, they are in an astrological aspect called a sesquiquadrate.
