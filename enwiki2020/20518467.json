    "text": "The Tree Medic is the 66th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on December 19, 1955, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== A tree surgeon halts his car in front of a hollow tree in the forest and hangs up a sign saying, \"Doctor Is In.\" The tree, however, belongs to Woody, who is awakened by the surgeon's drill. Determined to protect his home, Woody jams a cake pan over the drill, which the surgeon tugs at furiously. The doctor then treats the tree with repeated intervention from Woody. ==Production notes== The Tree Medic marked another modification for Woody's look, as his bright green eyes were replaced by black ovals. The diminutive woodpecker also shrunk in size even more, making him more stylized. It was this simple version of Woody that became his official look for the remainder of the series. books.google.co.uk The Tree Medic marked Alex Lovy's return at directing a Woody Woodpecker cartoon since 1943's The Dizzy Acrobat. He would continue directing shorts in the series until 1960's Ballyhooey. ==References== Category:1955 animated films Category:1955 films Category:1955 short films Category:Walter Lantz Productions shorts Category:Woody Woodpecker films Category:1950s American animated films Category:American films Category:Universal Pictures short films Category:Universal Pictures animated short films Category:Animated films about animals Category:Animated films about birds Category:American animated short films Category:Films directed by Alex Lovy ",
