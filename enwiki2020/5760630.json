    "text": "Industriales is a baseball team in the Cuban National Series. Located in Cerro, La Habana, it is known as the only team representing the country\u2019s capital, Havana. Industriales is historically the most successful team in the National Series, although they have played under other names throughout their history. The Super Classic of Cuban National Series takes place six times per season between Industriales and Santiago de Cuba, the Cuban equivalent of the New York Yankees\u2013Boston Red Sox rivalry. The matchup also represents the rivalry between the two cities (La Habana and Santiago de Cuba), dating back to the era when Cuba was a colony of Spain more than two centuries ago. They are known as the Lions (los leones), \"The Blues\" (los azules) or \"The Blue Lions\" (los Leones Azules). Royal blue is their color, though teams like Camag\u00fcey and Ciego de \u00c1vila also have blue uniforms (navy blue and sky blue, respectively.) ==History== The team was founded in 1962, as representatives of all the workers from all the industries of Cuba. Industriales is the perceived successor to the Almendares baseball team from the professional Cuban League. They won the Cuban National Series in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1973, 1986, 1992, 1996, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2010.
