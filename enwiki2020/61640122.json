    "text": "Village Financial Services Ltd (VFS), headquartered in Kolkata, was incorporated on June 28, 1994, as a private limited company over a decade before it got its present name. The name Village Financial Services Private Limited (VFSPL) was registered by the Registrar of Companies on January 23, 2006. Subsequently, the Reserve Bank of India granted it a certificate of registration dated December 1, 2006. In 2013, VFSPL became the first microfinance institution (MFI) in eastern India to get the status of an NBFC- MFI or Non-Banking Financial Company-MFI from the RBI. On November 7, 2017, the company was converted into a public company, after which the RBI granted it a fresh certificate of registration on January 4, 2018. VFS is also the first ISO-certified microfinance company in India. The microfinance operations under VFS have grown phenomenally. It has touched the lives of thousands of poor families by providing them credit for income-generating activities and helping them become economically self-sufficient, besides empowering women (who are the borrowers) and so letting them live with dignity. == History == In 1978, a group of young people got together to help flood victims of West Bengal.

It was reclassified by the RBI as an \u2018NBFC-MFI\u2019 on 27 September 2013.Shariq Khan, 'Village Financial Services: Market-based impact lending for the underserved, unbanked', The Economic Times (24 April 2019).
