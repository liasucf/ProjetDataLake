    "text": "St. Michaels University School (abbreviated SMU or SMUS) is a private day and boarding school in the municipality of Saanich, the largest and most populous municipality in the Capital Regional District and Vancouver Island. Previous headmasters include Robert Snowden (1995-2017), David Penaluna (1988\u201394) and John Shaffter (1977\u201388). ==Location== SMUS is located in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. The Senior and Middle School campus is located on Richmond Road in Saanich. The Junior School campus is situated on Victoria Avenue in Oak Bay. ==History== In 1906, University School was founded by Cap. R. V. Harvey, the Rev. W. W. Bolton and J. C. Barnacle. Four years later, in 1910, K. C. Symons founded St. Michael's School. St. Michael's School was unusual for its relatively large number of local day students for the period (as contrasted with University School's large number of boarders). Facing financial difficulties and the death of its headmaster in 1970, University School merged with St. Michael's in 1971 to become St Michaels University School. In 1973, the school began to enrol grade 1 and 2 students for the first time. In 1978, girls were accepted as day and boarding students in grades 10\u201312 for the first time, and the school began the process of becoming fully coeducational in 1985. A major expansion of the campus also began in 1985. In 1993, SMUS's boarding houses were renamed after the school's six founders: Bolton, Harvey, Winslow, Timmis, Symons, and Barnacle. == Boarding houses == There are currently six houses: three for boys and three for girls. The houses are named after the headmasters and founders of the school. === Boys === * Barnacle * Bolton * Harvey === Girls === * Timmis * Symons * Winslow The senior school houses are only for boarding students. They become a member of one of the houses when starting at SMUS and it becomes place of residence and community throughout that their time at the school. ==School performance== The average number of APs taken by SMUS students ranks first in country across all schools as of 2012. The record for most APs taken and completed by a single student is 15. In terms of average mean grades, SMUS students achieved an average of 3.68, which was higher than the global average of 2.92. Of the 650 exams across 25 different AP subjects taken by 245 SMUS students, 81% of them received grades of three or higher on the five point scale, which was also higher than the worldwide rate of 59% achieving grades of three or higher. ==Motto== The motto of University School was \"Mens sana in corpore sano,\" which means, \"A healthy mind in a healthy body.\" St. Michael's School had the motto \"Nihil Magnum Nisi Bonum,\" or, \"Nothing is great unless it is good.\" The current motto of St. Michaels University School is \"Vivat!\", or \"Long live the school!\" This ties into the school's song, \"Vivat - Universitas!\", written by Capt. R. V. Harvey originally for University School. The school uses \"Vivat\" when cheering on a team. ==Campus== Richmond Road Campus: * School House: Administration, Library, Mathematics * Brown Hall: (Currently Under Renovation) * Sun Center: Dining Hall, Student Commons, Howard Cafe * Chapel * Crothall Centre for the Humanities and Arts: Classrooms, Lecture Theatre, Drama Room, Art Room * William Monkman Athletic Complex: Gymnasium, Squash Courts, Fitness Center * John and Anne Schaffter Hall for Music * Science Building: Science Classrooms and Computer Labs * Infirmary * Residence Buildings: Barnacle, Bolton, Harvey (boys) and Winslow, Symons, Timmis (girls) * Wenman Pavilion: Senior Lounge * Reynolds House: Headmaster's Residence * Middle School ==Accreditation and memberships== St. Michaels University School is accredited or a member of the following organizations: * National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) * The Association of Boarding Schools (TABS) * Canadian Accredited Independent Schools (CAIS) * Northwest Association of Independent Schools (NWAIS) * Independent Schools Association of British Columbia (ISABC) * Secondary Schools Admissions Test (SSAT) * Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) * Independent Educational Consultants Association (IECA) * Western Boarding Schools Association (WBSA) * The National Society of High School Scholars (NSHSS) ==Notable alumni== Entertainment: * Timothy Williams (1983) \u2013 Composer and Orchestrator * Manoj Sood (1981) \u2013 Actor * Leslie Hope (1982) \u2013 Actress * Andrew Sabiston (1982) \u2013 Actor * Kenneth Oppel (1985) \u2013 Author * Bert Archer (1986) \u2013 Journalist/Author * Afshin Feiz \u2013 Fashion Designer * Bryce Soderberg (1998) \u2013 Musician-Lifehouse (band) * The Racoons (Jeff Mitchelmore 2004, Matthew Lyall 2002) \u2013 Musicians Politics: *Jason Kenney \u2013 Conservative cabinet minister under Stephen Harper (Immigration and National Defence) and current Premier of Alberta, 1982 to 1984https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kenney#Early_life_and_career *David Anderson \u2013 Former Liberal cabinet minister and former leader of the BC Liberal Party *Jodie Emery \u2013 marijuana activist and politician *Anthony C.
