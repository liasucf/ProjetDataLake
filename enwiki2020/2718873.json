    "text": "Pi1 Ursae Minoris is a common proper motion binary star system in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Minor. The pair have apparent visual magnitudes of +6.58 and +7.31, with a combined magnitude of 6.1. They are located about 71 light years from the Sun. The two have an angular separation of 31.4 arc seconds, which corresponds to a physical separation of about 680 AU, and orbit each other with a period of about 13,100 years. Both stars are solar analogs and have been listed as possible members of the Hercules-Lyra association, one of the nearest moving groups to the Sun, although this is now considered unlikely. The primary, \u03c01 Ursae Minoris A, has a mass 2% higher than the sun, an almost identical effective temperature at , a radius 98% of the sun's, and a bolometric luminosity 93% of the sun's. The secondary, \u03c01 Ursae Minoris B, has a mass 92% of the sun's, a slightly lower temperature of , a radius 84% of the sun's, and a luminosity slightly over half of the sun. ==References== ==External links== * The Electronic Sky * University of Florida Astronomy Department * HR 1971 * Image Omicron Aurigae Category:G-type main- sequence stars Category:Binary stars Ursae Minoris, Pi Category:Ursa Minor (constellation) Category:Durchmusterung objects 139777 139813 75809 75829 5829 ",
