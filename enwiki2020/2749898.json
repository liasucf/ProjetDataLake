    "text": "The Queen's Baton Relay is a relay around the world held prior to the beginning of the Commonwealth Games. The Baton carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth, currently Queen Elizabeth II. The Relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London as a part of the city's Commonwealth Day festivities. The Queen entrusts the baton to the first relay runner. At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the baton back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games.The Queen's Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay. ==History== The Relay was introduced at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales. No documentation of the origins has yet been found but the a similar idea had been proposed for the 1938 Sydney Games. A baton relay to commemorate the centenary of the Welsh national anthem was organised by athletics official Bernard Baldwin, who proposed something similar for the Commonwealth Games. Baldwin later founded the traditional New years eve race 'Nos Galan' in Mountain Ash.Before 1998, it was usual for the relay to begin at Buckingham Palace and then be transported to the host nation although the 1970 relay began in at Yellowknife in Canada's Northwest territory and flew to Scotland. The only time it did not begin on English soil. In 1974, the relay started at the Queen's Norfolk residence Sandringham. The 1990 relay also visited Australia. The Relay for the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was the first to incorporate a more expansive relay to other nations of the Commonwealth. The 2002 Commonwealth Games Relay covered over 100,000 kilometres and went through 23 nations. ==Editions== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ |- | Queen's Baton Relay for the XIV Commonwealth Games Auckland, New Zealand | colspan=\"2\" |For the 1990 Commonwealth Games, the baton was a two-piece affair.

The baton traveled via 70 nations and territories over 288 days before opening the games on 23 July 2014. At the ceremony, 32 inspiring volunteers from across Scotland carried the baton around Celtic Park Stadium after being nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to Sir Chris Hoy, who delivered it to President of the Commonwealth Games Federation HRH Prince Imran and the Queen who then declared the games open. The BBC provided coverage of the relay.BBC Coverage of the Queen's Baton Relay Adventurer Mark Beaumont presented a series of documentaries filmed on the relay for BBC One Scotland, there were also weekly updates for BBC News and a BBC News website and blog written by Mark. The product design consultancy awarded the contract to the design of the 2014 Queen's Baton is a local Glasgow company called 4c Design.Designers of the Glasgow 2014 Queen's Baton 4c Design wanted the 2014 baton to be true to the original intentions of the first relay and so wanted to focus the design around the Queen's handwritten message. Also rather than using cutting edge electronics, they choose to focus on cutting edge manufacturing. This all culminated in the Queen's message being internally illuminated to hint at the secret within, then surrounded by a titanium lattice framework that was grown using the latest additive manufacturing technology. At the top is a puzzle mechanism that dispenses granite gemstones to each of the Commonwealth nations and territories the baton visits, inviting them to join Glasgow at the Games. The puzzle mechanism also has a second function of keeping the message safely locked away until the opening ceremony, where the second stage of the puzzle will be unveiled. The handle of the Queen's Baton is made of Elm wood which came from the Isle of Cumbrae in Scotland. The Elm tree was felled by a local man called David Stevenson in the grounds of the Garrison House and the baton itself is crafted using an old boat building technique called bird mouthing. |- | Queen's Baton Relay for the XXI Commonwealth Games Gold Coast, Australia |colspan=\"2\" |The 2018 Queen\u2019s Baton Relay was launched on Commonwealth Day, 13 March 2017, on the historic forecourt at Buckingham Palace, signalling the official countdown to the start of the Games.
