    "text": "A starter pack, also referred to as a starterpack or starter kit, is a meme meant to describe or illustrate a stereotypical person, place, culture, object, or opinion. ==History== The starter pack meme originates back to September 27, 2014 when a Twitter user under the username of ItsLadinaPlis posted the \"I Date Black Guys Starter Pack\". The name, \"starter pack\", was originally used for sets of collectibles to start a collection, however, the name \"starter kit\" for usage of memes dates back to 2011 on use of \"crazy cat lady\" lolcat memes. Starter pack memes are now most popular on Reddit on the \"starterpacks\" Subreddit. ==Structure== A starter pack usually consists of 4 or more images. Text is sometimes added in for context. ==References== ==External links== * Reddit Starter Packs Subreddit Category:Internet memes introduced in 2014 ",
