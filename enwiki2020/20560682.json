    "text": "Electronic signage (also called electronic signs or electronic displays) are illuminant advertising media in the signage industry. Major electronic signage include fluorescent signs, HID (high intensity displays), incandescent signs, LED signs, and neon signs. Besides, LED signs and HID are so-called digital signage. ==Status== Electronic signs may be used indoors or outdoors. The display technologies are varied and changing quickly. Because of new display technologies, electronic signs are able to present more clear, colorful, and vivid images. Animated electronic signs gradually replace traditional static signs and increasingly take signage market share. === Average percentage of various signs usageSigns of the Times === {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- |Type of Signage |2001 |2002 |2003 |- | Fluorescent | 47.3% | 46.9% | 46.3% |- | HID (High Intensity Display) | 1.9% | 2.4% | 2.0% |- | Incandescent | 2.0% | 1.9% | 1.8% |- | LED | 3.9% | 6.2% | 7.2% |- | Neon | 43.0% | 41.3% | 41.7% |- | Others | 1.9% | 1.2% | 0.9% |} ==Regulation (USA)== It is not difficult to have an electronic sign for your business; however, it is not simple to get a permit to install an electronic sign.
