    "text": "Stephen Bernard Libby from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He was awarded the status of Fellow in the American Physical Society, after he was nominated by their American Physical Society in 1999, for the application of quantum field theory to diverse systems including perturbative quantum chromodynamics and transport in the quantum Hall effect, as well as inventing computational algorithms for radiation driven kinetics in plasmas, and the invention of novel short wavelength laser applications. ==Education and career== Libby received his B.A. from Harvard University in 1972, and his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 1977 where he was a student of David Gross. He then became a postdoc at the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics at Stony Brook University, and following it, worked as a Research Assistant Professor at Brown University. While there, he worked on quantum chromodynamics and factorization theorems with George Sterman as well as quantum theory of Hall effect with Herbert Levine and Aad Pruisken. In 1986, Libby joined Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where he worked in applied physics department, developing x-ray laser research. From 1992 to 1994, Libby served as Consulting Professor at Stanford University and then became a member of the National Research Council of its \"Rare Isotope Science\" Committee. ==References== ==External links== * Category:20th-century births Category:Living people Category:American physicists Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory staff Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
