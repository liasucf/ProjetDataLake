It is the second most popular magazine in Spain after Pronto. The title means \"Hello!\" in English and it is the parent magazine of the English- language Hello! and Hello! Canada and Hola! USA. ==History and profile== \u00a1Hola! was founded in Barcelona on 2 September 1944 by Antonio S\u00e1nchez G\u00f3mez, who continued to run the magazine until his death in the 1970s. He employed mainly relatives and to this day \u00a1Hola! remains a predominantly family run organisation, with S\u00e1nchez's wife still stepping in to provide layout for important royal wedding spreads. Later the headquarters of the magazine moved to Madrid. Initially designed as a family magazine, S\u00e1nchez soon realized the potential for profit in the women's industry and initially focused on the doings of royalty, as well as offering a self-help section. Then the magazine became a gossip magazine, although the Spanish version still relies heavily on royalty for their gossip, whilst the English and Latin American versions focus more on Hollywood. The former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez gave his first interview to the magazine when he was in office. The magazine continues to grow and its edition in Argentina was launched in 2010.Hola!
