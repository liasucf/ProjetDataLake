    "text": "Achille Simonetti (1838\u20131900) was a sculptor in Australia. He undertook many important commissions. ==Early life== Simonetti was born in Rome, Italy, the son of a sculptor. == Career == In 1871 James O'Quinn, Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, persuaded Simonetti to immigrate to Brisbane, Queensland. By 1874 he moved to Sydney establishing a studio in Balmain. ==Later life== Simonetti died after a two-week illness on 23 March 1900 at his residence and studio in Balmain, Sydney, New South Wales. He was buried in the Roman Catholic section of Rookwood Cemetery. At the time of his death, he was designing on a statue of the late Queensland Premier Thomas Joseph Byrnes. Although there was a proposal that Simonetti's former pupil James White might continue the work, the commission was given to Melbourne sculptor Bertram Mackennal who completed the status in 1902. It was placed at the corner of Queen, Wickham, Ann and Boundary Streets in Brisbane (which was later redeveloped to create Centenary Place). == Significant works == * 1892: Lifesize statue of the late James O'Quinn for St Stephen's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Brisbane * 1897: Statue of Arthur Phillip, first Governor of New South Wales, in Sydney ==References== Category:19th-century Australian sculptors Category:1838 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Burials at Rookwood Cemetery Category:Australian Catholics ",
