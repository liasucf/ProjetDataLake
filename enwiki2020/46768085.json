    "text": "Black Bull is a brand of Scotch whisky owned by Duncan Taylor. It is the flagship brand in the Duncan Taylor portfolio. ==History== Black Bull can trace its origins back to 1864, when it was first released in Dundee, Scotland. The original concept and philosophy of Black Bull was to blend with a high malt content and bottle at 100 proof (50%abv) strength and in small batches, which Duncan Taylor stays true too to this day. The brand was trademarked in the US on the repeal of prohibition in 1933 and over the subsequent years sold as many as 80,000 cases into the US alone. Black Bull was rebranded in 2009 by the Duncan Taylor, which included a new bottle and label look and design and expanded range. ==Range== Core *Kyloe *12 Year Old *21 Year Old Limited Release *21 Year Old Racers Reserve *Special Reserve Prestige *40 Year Old ==Accolades== \u201cGold\u201d and \u201cBest in Class\u201d International Spirits Challenge 2013 \u201cBest Blended Scotch Whisky 21 Years & Over\u201d World Whisky Awards 2012 \u201cBest Blended Scotch Whisky\u201d World Whisky Awards 2012 \u201cBest Blended Scotch Whisky 12 Years and Under\u201d World Whisky Awards 2011 \u201cGold\u201d International Wines & Spirits Challenge 2011 \u201cGold\u201d International Spirits Competition 2011 \u201cWinner \u2013 Blend Category\u201d Scottish Field Whisky Challenge 2011 \u201cOverall Winner\u201d Best In Glass 2011 == External links == * Category:Scotch whisky ",
