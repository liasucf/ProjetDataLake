    "text": "The version of the ad reprinted by the Daily Mail \"Let the Issues Be the Issue\" was an American viral political advertising campaign by the New York division of the Grey Group that focused around the 2008 U.S. Presidential election. Tor Myhren, a Creative Director within the group, devised the campaign. In the ads, Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican candidate John McCain had their races swapped, with McCain as an African- American and Obama as a Scots-Irish American. Images of a \"White Obama\" from the campaign have now become an internet meme and is also used as form of political satire online. Uses by Break.com and neatorama.com are examples, as well as the related Facebook page. ==See also== *Race in the United States *Public image of Barack Obama *Cultural and political image of John McCain *2008 United States presidential election#Race *Photo manipulation ==External links== *https://web.archive.org/web/20110719160045/http://www.thecoolhunter.net/ads/Obama/McCain ---The-Colored-Race/ (contains better-quality image) ==References== Category:Political Internet memes ",
