The group was originally a Johnny's Jr. unit, Mr. King vs Mr. Prince that was composed of 2 separate units: Mr. King and Prince. The units later performed as one group for TV Asahi's Roppongi Hills Natsu Matsuri Summer Station in June 2015. Their debut was announced at a press conference on January 17, 2018 along with the establishment of Johnny & Associates' new record label under Universal Music, Johnny's Universe, with King & Prince becoming the first artists to sign under the label. In only two years they have sold more than 4.7 million physical copies in Japan. ==History== ===2015\u20132017: Beginnings=== Mr.King vs Mr.Prince was formed on 5 June 2015, when they were appointed to be special supporters for TV Asahi's Summer Station event. Mr.King vs Mr.Prince was originally two separate Johnny's Jr. units: \"Mr. King\", consisting of Sho Hirano, Ren Nagase, and Kaito Takahashi and \"Prince\", consisting of Yuta Kishi, Yuta Jinguji, and Genki Iwahashi. Their name was coined by then-president Johnny Kitagawa two hours before the press conference announcing their formation. Mr.King vs Mr.Prince was originally meant to be a limited-time unit for the Summer Station event, however, in August 2015, the members announced that they would continue activities as a group. In 2016, the group split back into their respective units. Mr. King released a photo book and were special supporters for Summer Station 2016, while Prince performed in the Johnny's Ginza musical and became regular cast members of the TV Asahi variety show Mayonaka no Prince. In September 2017, the six members performed in the Johnny's Jr. concert Summer Sta (Kimi ga) King's Treasure. After the concert, they asked Johnny Kitagawa to let them debut together. ===2018\u2013present: Debut and success=== On 17 January 2018, their debut was announced in a press conference, along with the establishment of Johnny & Associates' new record label under Universal Music, Johnny's Universe, with King & Prince becoming the first artists to sign under the label.
