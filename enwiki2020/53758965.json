    "text": "Sigvard \"Sigge\" L\u00f6fgren (12 April 1928 \u2013 21 April 1996), also known as Sigfrid L\u00f6fgren, was a Swedish footballer who played as a midfielder. ==Club career== L\u00f6fgren started his career with Swedish Allsvenskan side Helsingborg in 1950, and garnered a reputation of being one of the best athletes in Swedish football. He moved to Italy in 1951, and was being scouted by numerous clubs before joining Lazio. After a good first season, in which he scored 7 goals from 20 games, he suffered a serious injury which kept him out of the whole 1952\u201353 season. On his return from injury, L\u00f6fgren could never recapture the form he showed in his first season, and in 1955 he joined fellow Serie A side Societ\u00e0 Polisportiva Ars et Labor, where he stayed for one season before returning to his homeland to join local side Ronneby BK. ==International career== L\u00f6fgren's only senior international cap came in a 1951 friendly draw with Spain. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1928 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Swedish footballers Category:Sweden international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Helsingborgs IF players Category:S.S.
