He was promoted to the rank of squadron leader in February 1937. He married Evelyn Margaret Bowden-Smith in early 1940, with the couple having two sons. ==WWII service and death== He served during the Second World War and was stationed in France at its outbreak, later working alongside the Advanced Air Striking Force to cover the retreating British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of France, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. After the allied defeat in France, Hodder returned home and was placed on engineering duties, firstly at Rootes Aircraft Factory and later at Handley Page. He was promoted to the temporary rank of group captain in March 1942, with Hodder obtaining the full rank the following month. In July 1943, he was placed in command of RAF Syerston.

He joined the crew of a Lancaster bomber during a bombing mission to Mannheim on the night of 5/6 September. Near Rheinberg the bomber encountered a Luftwaffe night fighter and was shot down, killing all aboard with the exception of one survivor. He is buried at the Rheinberg War Cemetery. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1906 births Category:1943 deaths Category:People from Cork (city) Category:People educated at Hill House School, Doncaster Category:Irish rugby union players Category:London Irish players Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:Irish cricketers Category:Royal Air Force cricketers Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II Category:British military personnel killed in World War II ",
