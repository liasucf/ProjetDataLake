He was a former Secretary of the Northern Party Committee (Tonkin Party Committee, X\u1ee9 u\u1ef7 B\u1eafc K\u1ef3). Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh was the first Chairman of the Central Inspection Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and the first chairman of the General Department of Supply (now General Department of Logistics) of the People's Army of Vietnam from 1950 until his death in 1955. In 2003 he was awarded Vietnam's Gold Star Medal. ==Early life== Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh was born in 1910 as Nguy\u1ec5n Tu\u1ea5n \u0110\u00e1ng in the hamlet of Qu\u1ea3ng Nguy\u00ean, Qu\u1ea3ng Ph\u00fa C\u1ea7u commune, \u1ee8ng H\u00f2a District of H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province (now part of Hanoi), where he completed primary school. Rather than remaining a serf tied to the land, he moved to Hanoi where he worked in the L\u00ea V\u0103n T\u00e2n Printworks. ==Party work and generalship== Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh was attracted by the ideals of a Marxist revolution and joined the Indochinese Communist Party in 1936. In 1939 he became a member of the Party's Hanoi Committee, and in 1940 became a member of the Northern Party Committee (Tonkin Party Committee, X\u1ee9 u\u1ef7 B\u1eafc K\u1ef3). In November 1940, he participated in the 7th Conference of the Central Committee of the Party. In May 1941, at the 8th Conference of the Central Committee held in the forest near P\u00e1c B\u00f3, he was elected an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Party. In July 1941, he became Secretary of the Northern Party Committee. Later in 1941, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh was arrested by the Vichy French and sentenced to twenty years in prison. He was first sent to H\u1ecfa L\u00f2 Prison in Hanoi, but as a problem prisoner he was transferred to Son La Prison at the end of 1942. There, he was active in the Party's secret organization in the prison, participating in political and military training for political prisoners. In March 1943, he escaped from Son La Prison along with Nguy\u1ec5n L\u01b0\u01a1ng B\u1eb1ng, Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Tr\u00e2n and L\u01b0u \u0110\u1ee9c Hi\u1ec3u. He returned to work for the Standing Committee of the Northern Party Committee. But in September 1943, he was rearrested and again sent to H\u1ecfa L\u00f2 Prison. In March 1945, he escaped a second time in a large prison-break of over a hundred political prisoners. After that, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh was appointed as a member of the Tonkin Revolutionary Military Committee, and put in charge of the Ho\u00e0ng Hoa Th\u00e1m battlefield (i.e., B\u1eafc S\u01a1n \u2013 V\u00f5 Nhai base area). In August 1945, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh sent Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh to the Vi\u1ec7t Minh General Committee, to join National Uprising Committee, in which capacity he attended the National Assembly at T\u00e2n Tr\u00e0o, S\u01a1n D\u01b0\u01a1ng. He was then assigned to General Gi\u00e1p. Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh liberated the town of Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean, and provided the protection detail that accompanied H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's triumphal entrance into Hanoi in September 1945. In 1947 he was appointed as the Party's Chairman of the Central Inspection Commission, and served as a deputy inspector in the Government Inspectorate from December 1949 to February 1951. In 1950, he was appointed a member of the Party's Military Commission and specifically made head of the military's General Department of Supply (now General Department of Logistics, C\u1ee5c H\u1eadu c\u1ea7n). He was also charged with heading the Party's Campaign Supply Committee. During 1952\u20131953 he developed the supply policy of \"mobilize logistics in place\", in other words to develop local labor and food resources from areas near the front. This reduced both food consumption and transport labor. ===Death=== Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh suffered from malaria and intestinal problems brought on by his time in prison. In September 1953 he fell ill and was originally treated at the Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c To\u1ea3n Clinic (now Military Hospital 354) in M\u1ef9 Y\u00ean, \u0110\u1ea1i T\u1eeb District. By December he was unable to attend the Politburo Conference in T\u1ec9n Keo. In September 1954 he was taken to China, and then on to the Soviet Union for medical treatment. In June 1955 he returned home and he died in Hanoi on 6 October 1955. ==Commemoration== 1956 stamp honoring Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh * Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh's name was given to a street in Hanoi, a street and a ward in the city of Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh and a street in the city of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7. * In July 1956, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Post Office issued a set of four stamps, with his portrait, commemorating his work. * A secondary school in Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh and the high school in Hoa Son commune, \u1ee8ng H\u00f2a District, are named after him. * In 2003, a memorial was built in Hanoi on the former land of his family in Quang Nguyen hamlet, Quang Phu Cau commune, \u1ee8ng H\u00f2a District. * in 2013, the \"Monument of the Communist Soldier Tran Dang Ninh\" was erected on the campus of Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u0103ng Ninh High School. ==Notes and references== ==Further reading== * Category:1910 births Category:1955 deaths Category:People from Hanoi Category:Generals of the People's Army of Vietnam Category:Vietnamese nationalists Category:Vietnamese revolutionaries Category:Viet Minh members Category:Vietnamese communists Category:Vietnamese people of World War II Category:World War II resistance members Category:People of the First Indochina War ",
