    "text": "The Bankers Football Club was an Australian rules football club, based in Adelaide, that played in the South Australian Football Association of 1877. The club lost every one of the 15 matches it contested in 1877, and scored just 4 goals while conceding 36; six of these losses were on forfeit as the club struggled to field a team. It was seen by fans, the media and other teams as being equal to a social club at the elite level: at the end of the 1877 season, \u2018Marlborough\u2019, writing in The Advertiser, implicitly echoed these sentiments regarding the Bankers club, and expressed the hope \"that no efforts will be made to establish it next season\". Shortly afterwards, the Bankers dropped out of the SAFA and disbanded. ==References== Category:Former South Australian National Football League clubs Category:Australian rules football clubs in South Australia Category:Australian rules football clubs established in 1877 Category:Australian rules football clubs disestablished in 1877 Category:1877 establishments in Australia Category:1877 disestablishments in Australia ",
