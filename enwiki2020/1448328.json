Dvorna in Dr\u017eavna Tiskarna, p. 108. is a town in central Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Grosuplje. It lies just south of the capital Ljubljana in the traditional region of Lower Carniola. It is now included in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Grosuplje municipal site ==Name== Grosuplje was first attested in written sources in 1136 as Groslupp (and as Grasslupp in 1220\u201350, and Grazlup in 1249). The settlement is known as Grasuple in the local dialect. The etymological origin of the name is unclear. One theory derives it from *Graslupoje (selo/po\u013ee)\u2014literally, 'wet (village/field)', from the adjective *graslup\u044a. Another theory derives the name from Lombard *grass(ah)lauffja 'rapids' but is undermined by the lack of fast-flowing water in the area. Yet another theory derives it from the hypothetical Lombard name *Graslupus borrowed into Slavic as *Groslup\u044a, whereby *Groslup\u013ee selo would literally mean 'Groslup\u044a's village'.Snoj, Marko. 2009.
