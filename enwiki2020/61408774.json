    "text": "Manor Black is an American comic book series created by writers Cullen Bunn and Brian Hurtt and artist Tyler Crook, published by Dark Horse Comics. ==Publication history== Following a few teasing images on Dark Horse's Twitter account, Manor Black was announced on April 4, 2019 as a four-issue miniseries. The story was announced as a \"gothic soap opera,\" drawing inspiration from Dark Shadows, American Gothic, Hammer horror films, and Twin Peaks. Cullen Bunn and Brian Hurtt came up with the idea during the early days of working on The Sixth Gun together, but the project didn't come together until Tyler Crook came on board as artist. Crook added his own ideas, which helped Manor Black become more fully realized. For Crook, it was important for him to create a contrast between the mundane and the monstrous, so while a he did a lot of design work on the magical elements of the story, he spent a lot of time making the mundane word just as detailed, scouting locations and figuring out what the local architecture and trees in Georgia. Though initially announced as a miniseries, there is much more planned for the future. ===Issues=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !Issue !Release Date !Story !Art !Cover |- |colspan=5 style=background:#ff0000| |- |#1 |July 31, 2019 |rowspan=4|Cullen Bunn Brian Hurtt |rowspan=4|Tyler Crook |Tyler Crook VARIANT: Dan Brereton |- |#2 |August 28, 2019 |Tyler Crook VARIANT: Jill Thompson |- |#3 |September 25, 2019 |Tyler Crook VARIANT: Greg Smallwood |- |#4 |October 30, 2019 |Tyler Crook VARIANT: Erica Henderson |} ===Collections=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !Title !Release Date !Collects !ISBN |- |colspan=4 style=background:#ff0000| |- |Manor Black |February 19, 2020 |Manor Black #1\u20134 | |} ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== The initial reception of Manor Black was universally positive.
