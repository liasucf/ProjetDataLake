    "text": "Woodhorn is a village in Northumberland, England about east of Ashington. The village is sometimes identified with Wucestre, given to St Cuthbert by King Ceolwulf when he gave up his throne in 737 to become a monk at Lindisfarne. A medieval bell at Woodhorn, inscribed \"Ave Maria\", is said to be one of the oldest in existence. == Economy == The main employment was at the coal mine. The mine has since closed and the site has been landscaped incorporating a lake and known as Queen Elizabeth II Country Park. Some of the mine buildings have been retained and are used as a visitor centre. == Landmarks == Woodhorn Colliery Museum is situated in a country park with a lake. With sound effects, models, paintings, working machinery etc., the museum gives an insight into life in a local coal-mining community. The site of the old pit is now the location for Northumberland Record Office, a purpose-built building having been constructed to replace the two previous buildings at Morpeth and Gosforth. == Religious sites == The church is dedicated to St Mary. ==References== ==External links== *GENUKI (Accessed: 27 November 2008) *Experience Woodhorn (Woodhorn colliery museum and country park, and the Northumberland archives) Category:Villages in Northumberland Category:Newbiggin-by-the-Sea ",
