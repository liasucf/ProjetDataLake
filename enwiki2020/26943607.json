The whole council was up for election for the first time since the 2002 election. ==Election result== |} At the Hammersmith and Fulham council election, 2006, the Conservative Party won a majority for the first time since 1968, taking 33 seats and forming the Administration for the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham . The Council leader was Cllr Stephen Greenhalgh. Labour formed the opposition on the Council, with 13 seats, and was led by Stephen Cowan.https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/londondatastore-upload/London- Borough-Council-Elections-2006.pdf The Conservative Party came close to losing the usually safe ward of Palace Riverside, after the sitting councillors were deselected, and ran as independents. One of the two rebels returned 12 years later as the Conservative candidate in the same ward, and was elected.https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2006/04/13/tories-deselect-single-mother- and-gay-arab/ One notable loss for the Labour Party was one of the three seats in the Shepherds Bush Green ward - which only ever elected Labour councillors before or since. After alternating between Abu Khalad (1986, 1994 & 2002) and Jafar Khaled (1990 & 1998), Abu Khaled stood for re-election, but lost by 4 votes in a ward where the Conservatives had previously been nowhere near winning a seat. ==Ward results== The borough is divided into 16 electoral wards, all bar two electing three councillors apiece.http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/leap/results/2006/8/ ===Addison=== ===Askew=== ===Avonmore & Brook Green=== ===College Park & Old Oak=== ===Fulham Broadway=== ===Fulham Reach=== ===Hammersmith Broadway=== ===Munster=== ===North End=== ===Palace Riverside=== ===Parson's Green & Walham=== ===Ravenscourt Park=== ===Sands End=== ===Shepherd's Bush Green=== ===Town=== ===Wormholt & White City=== ==References== 2006 Category:2006 London Borough council elections Category:21st century in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ",
