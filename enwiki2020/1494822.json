    "text": "Yuan Muzhi (; March 3, 1909 \u2013 January 30, 1978) was an actor and director from the Republic of China and later of the People's Republic of China. == Career == As an actor, Yuan became extremely popular and took on the nickname \"man with a thousand faces.\" He gained prominence in a series of films for the leftist Diantong Film Company. These included the film Plunder of Peach and Plum (1935) (which Yuan also wrote) and the movie Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm (1935) where he was one of the two original singers (along with Gu Menghe) of the movie's theme song, The March of the Volunteers, which later became the national anthem of China. His career eventually brought him to director's chair. Yuan's filmmaking debut, the innovative musical comedy Scenes of City Life (1935) (Dushi fengguang), was one of the earliest non- silent features made in China, as the Shanghai industry was finally transitioning to sound. The film's blend of screwball humor and romance reflected Yuan's harsh, documentary style social observations of middle class existence in the failing economy in Great Depression-era Shanghai. The father of one main character is a pawn shop owner, who in one humorous scene, is so hard up for cash himself\u2014since no one has any money left to reclaim their pawned goods\u2014he even attempts to pawn items from his own shop with another proprietor. The opening of the film features an extended montage of Shanghai's new, modern cityscape of the time, and its landmarks, such as neon signs, theatre marquees, and the Shanghai Cathedral. Jiang Qing, the future wife of Mao Zedong, appeared in a relatively minor role in the film. She would later lead the denunciation of many of Yuan's leftist colleagues in the Shanghai filmmaking scene, accusing them of being rightists, destroying their careers and lives. Yuan's second film, Street Angel (1937) (Malu tianshi), starred then-unknown Zhou Xuan, who performed He Luting's popular songs written for the film, \"Song of the Four Seasons\" and \"The Wandering Songstress\", and became one of China's most adored divas for the remainder of her life. Street Angel is considered one of the most important Chinese films of all time, a highlight of the \"second generation\" of Chinese cinema. An experimental blend of comedy and tragedy, Yuan's story followed a group of young friends whose lack of financial means and social status frustrated their dreams of happiness, including a girl singer, her prostitute sister, and her soldier lover, home briefly between fighting the Japanese occupying north China. The film, released shortly before Japan invaded Shanghai and initiated the Second Sino-Japanese War in summer 1937, became a massive hit with audiences. Subsequently, Street Angel was seen to mark one of the last products of the \"golden age of Chinese cinema\" of the 1930s, before artists were forced to retreat to Shanghai's foreign concessions and finally came under Japanese propaganda control. Yuan also continued to act in roles, notably Eight Hundred Heroes (1938) depicting the events of the Defense of Sihang Warehouse. After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, Yuan continued to be a major figure in the film industry, helping to found Dongbei Film Studio, which eventually became the first state-controlled production companies in the People's Republic of China. Yuan was a delegate to the first National People's Congress and the third Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. == Selected filmography == === Actor === {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" width=\"40\"|Year !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|English Title !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Chinese Title !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Role |- |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1934 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Plunder of Peach and Plum |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\u6843\u674e\u52ab |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Tao |- |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1935 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\u98a8\u96f2\u5152\u5973 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Xin Baihe |- |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1935 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Scenes of City Life |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\u90fd\u5e02\u98a8\u5149 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| |- |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1936 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Unchanged Heart in Life and Death |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\u751f\u6b7b\u540c\u5fc3 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| |- |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1938 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|The Eight Hundred Heroes |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\u516b\u767e\u58ef\u58eb |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| |- |} === Director === {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" width=\"40\"|Year !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|English Title !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Chinese Title !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Notes |- |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1935 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Scenes of City Life |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\u90fd\u5e02\u98a8\u5149 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Also known as Cityscape |- |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1937 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Street Angel |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\u99ac\u8def\u5929\u4f7f |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Yuan Muzhi from the Chinese Movie Database * Brief biography on Yuan Muzhi Category:1909 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Male actors from Zhejiang Category:Film directors from Zhejiang Category:Screenwriters from Zhejiang Category:Singers from Zhejiang Category:Delegates to the 1st National People's Congress Category:Members of the 3rd Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Category:Writers from Ningbo Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Zhejiang Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Zhejiang Category:Chinese male stage actors Category:Republic of China writers Category:People's Republic of China writers Category:Musicians from Ningbo Category:Actors from Ningbo Category:Politicians from Ningbo Category:Artists from Ningbo Category:20th-century Chinese male actors Category:20th-century Chinese singers Category:Chinese male film actors Category:Chinese film directors Category:20th-century Chinese musicians Category:20th-century screenwriters ",
