In December 1899 and April 1900, Marines from Hermione served as an honour guard and pallbearers for the funerals of the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Charles Mitchell and the Chief Justice of the British Supreme Court for China and Corea, Sir Nicholas John Hannen, who had also served as consul-general in Shanghai.North China Herald, 2 May 1900, p785. Hannen's granddaughter was named Hermione Hannen, presumably because of this event. In May 1902 she was posted to the Mediterranean station, and Captain Arthur Yerbury Moggridge was appointed in command. Attached to the cruiser division, she visited Argostoli with other ships of the division in early October 1902. In 1906 Hermione went into reserve at Portsmouth, refitted in 1907 and sent to the Cape Town Station. On 14 February 1909 she ran aground at Zanzibar but was re-floated sustaining only slight damage. In June 1909 she joined the 3rd Cruiser Squadron at Portsmouth and in July joined the Home Fleet. On 6 August Hermione ran aground off Killingholme in the Humber and after 8 hours was re- floated. In September 1910 she began preparations for use as a tender for the Royal Navy's first airship, but when this project was abandoned, she rejoined the Home Fleet in January 1912. In the meantime, she had hosted the first British seaplane experiments, with an Avro Type D in November 1911. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she became guard ship at Southampton, later becoming HQ Ship for motor launches and coastal motor boats from December 1916 until December 1919.
