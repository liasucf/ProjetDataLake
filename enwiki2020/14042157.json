    "text": "In enzymology, a secologanin synthase (, was wrongly classified as in the past) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :loganin + NADPH + H+ \\+ O2 \\rightleftharpoons secologanin + NADP+ \\+ 2 H2O The 4 substrates of this enzyme are loganin, NADPH, H+, and O2, whereas its 3 products are secologanin, NADP+, and H2O. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is loganin:oxygen oxidoreductase (ring-cleaving). This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis. ==References== * * * Category:EC 1.14.19 Category:NADPH- dependent enzymes Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
