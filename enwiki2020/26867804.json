    "text": "Monticello High School is a rural public high school located in Monticello, Wisconsin in Green County, Wisconsin, United States. ==School history== The original school house was built in 1902, on the north end of town. In 1912 it was decided to build a new school closer to the center of the town. It was completed in 1913 and was built where the current one is. The first yearbook was printed in 1927 and the Principal at the time was Mr. Corydon L. Rich. The first graduating class to wear caps and gowns was the class of 1932. The elementary wing was added in 1958, along with the now named Rehmstedt Gym. It is named after Mr. Rehmsted who donated $32,000 to the School. In 1980 the original school building was demolished and replaced with the current high school office and rooms, the Rhemsted gym flooded that year right before the school year started and part of the gym was unusable. In 1996 a new gym which is called the Elmer Lemon Gym, computer labs, and music rooms were added. ==Administration== * Mr. Mark Gustafson is Monticello's current Principal.Allen Brokopp, the current Superintendent *Mr. Allen Brokopp is Monticello's current District Administrator effective January 9, 2019 ===Past Principals=== * Mr. Allen Brokopp (2009-2013) * Mrs. Susan McGuire (2009) * Mr. Kenneth Colle (2001\u20132009) * Mrs. Susan Halseth (1999\u20132000) * Mr. Joel Espe (1993\u20131998) * Mr. William Greiner (1989\u20131992) * Mr. Haasl (1984\u20131988) * Mr. Ben Campa (1982\u20131983) * Mr. Brad Colton (1981-1981) * Mr. John Kammerud (1977\u20131980) * Mr. Leonard Cisewski (1974\u20131976) * Mr. Barnes (1972\u20131973) * Mr. Nelson (1971\u20131972) * Mr. Larson (1969\u20131970) * Mr. F.

John Ponyicsanyi son, Jack, played for his fathers basketball team. Jack says today, that there wasn't a mascot before the Ponies, but the Monticello Basketball team (with Coach Ponyicsanyi) was AMAZING! They then decided that we should be named the Ponies after Coach John Ponyicsanyi. ==Notable alumni== *Gene Lynn - real estate developer of facilities for the elderly; philanthropist; donated Monticello Public Library building *Elmer J.
