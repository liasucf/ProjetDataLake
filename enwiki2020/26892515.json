    "text": "Roman Johann Strobl (born 1951 in Kitzb\u00fchel) is an Austrian sculptor. He has lived in Hanover since 1999. Strobl learnt to sculpt in his father's workshop. Surrealist works inspired by his travels during the 1970s in Iraq and India were followed by a spell in Rome, during the 1980s, where he honed his skills in marble working under Prof. Sebastian Schadhauser. Strobl's marble sculptures were exhibited in 1986 in the Haus der Kunst, in 1990 at Kubus Bremen, and other venues. His first chainsaw works were presented in 1998, in Schlo\u00df Kaps in Kitzb\u00fchel.Galerie Nettels: Roman Johann Strobl Chainsaw portraits of Bruno Bruni at an exhibition in Ahrensburg, in 2001, as well as Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Franz Beckenbauer, at the 2002 Expo in Hanover were to follow. One further work worthy of mention is his portrait of conductor Zubin Mehta, created for the opening of the Munich opera festival, in 2005. In addition to sculptures in wood, marble and stone, Strobl's oeuvre also takes in a series of highly expressive picture cycles on canvas, as well as drawings. He has presented his sculptures publicly at venues in Zurich, Munich, Hanover and in Austria (Kunst am Bau \u2013 architectural sculpture). Together with Mechthild Schmidt, Strobl was responsible in 1997 for the redesign of the German film award, the Lola. In 2001 he and his wife, Anne, created the prototype for the Buddy Bear, working closely together with Eva and Klaus Herlitz.Eva and Klaus Herlitz: Buddy Bear Berlin, 2012, ., page 5 Pictures and sculptures by Strobl were exhibited for the first time in Paris, at La capitale Galerie, in 2007. ==Notes and references== == External links == * Website Roman Strobl Category:Austrian sculptors Category:Austrian male sculptors Category:1951 births Category:Living people ",
