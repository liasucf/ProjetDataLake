The Red Force takes part in inter-regional cricket competitions in the Caribbean, such as the West Indies' Professional Cricket League (which includes the Regional Four Day Competition and the NAGICO Regional Super50) under the franchise name Trinidad and Tobago Red Force,Jamaica Franchise at home against Leeward Islands Hurricanes with the best players selected for the West Indies team, which plays international cricket. ==Team history== Teams from Trinidad played first-class cricket from 1869, when Trinidad took on Demerara for two matches, winning one and losing one. They also participated in the Inter-Colonial Tournament between Barbados, British Guiana (formerly Demerara), and themselves, playing in all 28 tournaments that were held between 1891\u201392 and 1938\u201339. From the late 1880s, Tobago was incorporated into the crown colony of Trinidad as a ward. After independence in 1962, the team changed its name to reflect the official name of the country, Trinidad and Tobago, and when the Shell Shield began in 1965\u201366 the team competed under the name of Trinidad and Tobago. They won their first title on their fourth outing, in 1969\u201370, and also won the next year's competition, but since then Trinidad and Tobago have only taken three titles in 35 seasons. During this time cricketers from Trinidad competed in the Beaumont Cup which had first class status. In one-day cricket, Trinidad and Tobago won four titles in eight seasons from 1989\u201390 to 1996\u201397, and also won the 2004\u201305 one-day title. T&T; cricket team participated and were runners-up at the inaugural Champions' league T-20. The team stayed unbeaten until the finals. ==Squad== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" |- !
