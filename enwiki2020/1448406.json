    "text": "Karratha is a city in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, adjoining the port of Dampier. It was established in 1968 to accommodate the processing and exportation workforce of the Hamersley Iron mining company and, in the 1980s, the petroleum and liquefied natural gas operations of the North West Shelf Venture. At June 2018, Karratha had an urban population of 16,708. The city's name comes from the cattle station of the same name, which derives from a word in a local Aboriginal language meaning \"good country\" or \"soft earth\". The city is the seat of government of the City of Karratha, a local government area covering the surrounding region. ==Geography== Karratha, an isolated city, is located approximately north of Perth and west of Port Hedland on the North West Coastal Highway. It is at the south central end of Nickol Bay, which has had settlements on the bay since the 1860s. The city is roughly rectangular in layout and is located on flat land adjacent to Nickol Bay. Tidal salt flats and areas of mangrove separate the city from the sea. Immediately to the rear of the city (south) lies a line of low hills. ===Climate=== Karratha has a hot semi-arid climate, that just avoids a desert climate classification. Temperatures are warm to hot all year round, with low rainfall, most of which falls in late summer due to the influence of tropical cyclones and the monsoon, although there is a second rainfall peak in early winter as the northern edges of cold fronts occasionally cause rain in the region. It is very rare for any rain to fall in the period from August to December. Winter temperatures rarely drop below 10 \u00b0C, while maximums stay in the mid to high 20 \u00b0C's and days are sunny with low humidity. Summers are very hot and usually dry although the erratic influence of the monsoon can cause periods of high humidity and thunderstorms. The record high temperature is 48.2 \u00b0C (118.8 \u00b0F), while the record low is 6.9 \u00b0C (44.4 \u00b0F). The highest monthly rainfall on record was 348.8mm (13.7 in) in February 2011, owing to the passage of Tropical Cyclone Carlos and several other monsoonal lows over Karratha. ==Population== In June 2018, there were 16,708 people in Karratha, a decline from the recent peak of 17,927 in 2013.
