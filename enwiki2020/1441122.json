The conservation park encompasses of coastline, which include views across Backstairs Passage to Kangaroo Island. The conservation park consists of mainly rolling coastal hills, the gullies of which contain orchids and ferns, while the hilltops have stunted scrub and low windswept trees. Walking trails (including part of the famous Heysen Trail) provide access to most of the conservation park. It is classified as an IUCN class II protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. == Notable walks == There are many walks in the conservation park, ranging from easy walks, through to moderate and hard hikes. Overnight treks are also possible by linking walks. ;Easy Walks * Stringybark Loop Walk: An easy 20-minute nature trail through stringybark and yacca-bush forest. Information boards are located at intervals along the way. * Forest Circuit Walk: An easy walk through the forest near Stringybark Campground. * Spring Wildflower Walk: A walk that follows fire trails from Stringybark Campground. ;Moderate Hikes * Deep Creek Waterfall from Tent Rock Road: Descends steeply to the Deep Creek Waterfall. The walk is not long and the track is well maintained with steps in steeper sections. The return walk is mostly uphill. * Deep Creek Cove from Trig Camping Area: Descends moderately to Deep Creek Cove. The return walk is a long moderate ascent. * Aaron Creek Circuit Hike: A circuit hike that crosses the open areas at the higher sections of the conservation park before descending toward Eagle Waterhole Campground. Plenty of Western grey kangaroos can be seen on this hike. ;Hard Hikes * Deep Creek Cove from Tapanappa Lookout: A spectacular and challenging hike that involves some steep hills and scrambling in some places. Hiking boots are required as there are steep and slippery sections in close proximity to cliff edges. * Blowhole Beach Hike: Descends to Blowhole Beach from Cobbler Hill. Can be incredibly windy. The track is not especially rough but the ascent on the return hike is long and steep. * Deep Creek Waterfall from Tapanappa Lookout: Another spectacular and challenging hike that has some long and steep undulations. This walk goes right into the dense Deep Creek vegetation and is not a leisurely stroll. * Aaron Creek Hike: Follows the creek to the coast, many creek crossings involved, and stunning views. ;The Heysen Trail * The Heysen Trail enters the conservation park near Blowhole Beach, not far from its starting point at Cape Jervis. It traverses the conservation park via Eagle Waterhole, Trig Campground, and Deep Creek Waterfall, and exits at Boat Harbour beach before continuing to Tunkalilla Beach.
