    "text": "Beneath The Lies (also known as Beneath The Lies \u2013 The Series or just Beneath The Lies Series) is a Ugandan television drama-mystery series created by Nana Kagga Macpherson and starring Flavia Tumusiime, Natasha Sinayobye, Gaetano Kagwa, Hellen Lukoma, Rabadaba, Deedan Muyira, Cedric Babu Ndilima, Salvador Idringi, and Susan Naava as regular cast members. The series was directed by Joseph Kitsha Kyasi and Tosh Gitonga. It was originally produced by Savannah MOON Productions, and Kinetic Media Group before all production was taken over by 40Plus Productions, a production house co-owned by Nana Kagga and Cedric Babu Ndilima. It airs on Sundays at 9:30 p.m. EAT, on New Vision Group's Urban TV Uganda. In December 2016, the series was nominated for Best Television Series at Africa Magic Viewers' Choice Awards (AMVCAs). ==Plot== Within the city of Kampala, lies a seedy underbelly of blackmail, drug trafficking, child prostitution and exploitation of women run by an unknown racket. When the lies beneath each relationship are exposed and loyalties are tested, only death and chaos can ensue. ==Production== The first two episodes of the series were produced by Savannah MOON Productions in conjunction with Kinetic Management group and so far the all the episodes were shot at different locations in Kampala. 40 Plus Productions took over the series production in 2016 starting with the third episode of the first season and at the same time MTN Uganda took over digital marketing for the TV Series. The series is the brains of Nana Kagga, a former TV presenter and actress, remembered for her roles in A Good Day to Be Black & Sexy, Star Trek and featuring in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. The series ran for 30 minutes an episode on the 10:30 \u2013 11 p.m. Urban TV time slot weekdays and repeats on Sundays before its hiatus. ==Theft and series hiatus== In December 2014, all pre-recorded material and equipment for episodes 3\u201312 of season one were stolen from storage during the end of shoot wrap party. This brought the show to a very sudden hiatus after re-airing the first and second episode. ==Re- release== After the theft of BTL footage, re-shooting of the show began in January 2015. Shooting started in early 2016 with mostly a new crew consisting predominantly of Ugandans. Beneath The Lies was re-released on 31 July 2016 on Urban TV Uganda under 40 Plus Productions and MTN Uganda as its digital distributor. The show aired four more episodes after the re-release with the last episode airing on 4 September 2016, making a total of six episodes and marking the premature end of the series. ==Cast== *Flavia Tumusiime as Kamali Tenywa *Cedric Babu Ndilima as Mr. Stephen Amaru, Kamali's ex-husband, a powerful lawyer in Kampala.
