But on some words with c just before the pair of e and i, like receive, perceive, \"e\" comes before \"i\". This can be remembered by the following mnemonic, :::I before E, except after C But this is not always obeyed as in case of weird and weigh, weight, height, neighbor etc. and can be remembered by extending that mnemonic as given below :::I before E, except after C :::Or when sounded \"A\" as in neighbor, weigh and weight :::Or when sounded like \"eye\" as in height :::And \"weird\" is just weird Another variant, which avoids confusion when the two letters represent different sounds instead of a single sound, as in atheist or being, runs :::When it says ee :::Put i before e :::But not after c *Where ever there is a Q there is a U too Most frequently u follows q. e.g.: Que, queen, question, quack, quark, quartz, quarry, quit, Pique, torque, macaque, exchequer.
