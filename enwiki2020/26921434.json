The temple is also known as \"Thi\u00ean Ph\u00fac T\u1ef1\" (, \"Temple of Heavenly Blessings\"). The temple was established in the 11th century during the reign of Emperor Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng of the L\u00fd dynasty. It is dedicated to Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n master T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh (, 1072-1116). It is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Vietnam, It is well maintained by the monks. The temple is a center of pilgrimage during T\u1ebft. ==Geography== The temple is located in S\u00e0i S\u01a1n village, from Hanoi. It sits on the banks of an artificial lake, at the foot of the S\u00e0i S\u01a1n Mountain, near Th\u0103ng Long Boulevard. ==History== T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh, the monk T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh (also known as Minh Kh\u00f4ng) was a famous monk. He was the chief monk at the temple, a choreographer of traditional water puppetry, an inventor, and also a medical man and mystic in his village. The mystic acts associated with the monk include him burning his finger to usher in rain and curing local people of disease by blessing them, in addition to performing many other miracles. He presented water puppetry (which is unique to Vietnam) at the small lake pavilion which he built in the middle of the lake, in front of the main hall. According to the local belief he had incarnated thrice, once as Buddha in the form of Sakhyamuni, then as the son of King L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng who later became the King L\u00fd Th\u1ea7n T\u00f4ng and then as a monk who saved the King Th\u1ea7n T\u00f4ng also. He created his own brand of T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh cult. ==Features== The temple is divided into three parts. The entrance hall is the prayer hall. The middle chamber has images of Buddhas surrounded by demons, made of lacquer and garbed in red- coloured attire. The back chamber has statues of the monk. The temple has been refurbished many times. The temple has three dedications: to King L\u00fd Th\u1ea7n T\u00f4ng (1127 to 1138), to Gautama Buddha and his eighteen arhats and to the Buddhist monk and Thi\u1ec1n master T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh. It is built in a typical Vietnamese architectural style. The main prayer hall of the temple has nearly 100 colourful images of different period. At the entrance to the shrine there are two large clay mixed papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 images of the 7th century, each weighing about a ton; these are considered the largest such images in Vietnam. The main hall contains the temple's oldest image, dating from the temple's foundation: a triptych of Buddha and disciples dating from the 16th century on a high pedestal. There is a 13th-century statue of a bodhisattva seated on a lotus throne, which is a wooden statue draped in yellow. It was made in the likeness of the master \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh in a pensive mood. The statues of T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh and his reincarnation in the form of L\u00fd Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng are located in the hall next to each other. Within the same temple complex there is a small shrine referred to as the \"old temple\" (). It was founded by King L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 in 1132 and has been renovated several times. There are two arched bridges connecting to the temple. Built in 1602, they are named Sun and Moon. One of these bridges leads to a small island, home to a small Taoist temple representing the elements of earth, air, and water. The second bridge leads to a limestone hill. \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh, during the last stage of his life, had walked up to this place and disappeared in a cave. This cave is located in the middle of roots of banyans and is hemmed between a small temple built in honour of the monk's parents and a small temple. Both these are religious places from where there are lovely vistas of the entire valley. There is also a limestone grotto known as the hang C\u1eafc C\u1edb, \"the Mischievous\". ==Festival== A colourful festival, known as the Th\u1ea7y temple festival, is held in honour of the monk T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh. It is held from the 5th to 7th days of the third Lunar month. During the festival puppet groups present water puppetry stage shows at the open air theater in the lake. A pageant of tableaux are also taken out on the occasion. Participants in the festivities come from four villages. The sandalwood statue of the master, located in the temple, is moved with intertwined strings during the puppet festival. During other festivals held here, poems written by T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh and King L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng are recited. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * Category:Buddhist temples in Hanoi Category:11th-century Buddhist temples ",
