The park surrounds the Gardiner Dam, which was built in 1967 and is among the largest embankment dams in Canada and the world. The South Saskatchewan River flows north beyond the park, towards Outlook and Saskatoon. Danielson Provincial Park's Visitor Centre is located between Lake Diefenbaker and Coteau Bay, and features numerous interactive displays about the Gardiner Dam and the river systems of southern Saskatchewan in addition to a caf\u00e9 and beach. Multiple campgrounds and boat launches exist throughout the park. The park opened to the public in 1971, and was named for former MLA Gustaf Herman Danielson. Saskatchewan Highways 44, 45 and 219 provide access to the park. SaskPower's Coteau Creek Hydroelectric Station is located near the park. ==References== Category:Provincial parks of Saskatchewan Category:Division No. 11, Saskatchewan ",
