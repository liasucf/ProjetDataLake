Norwich's record home attendance is 43,984 for a sixth round FA Cup match against Leicester City on 30 March 1963.

The club has won the League Cup twice (most recently in 1985) and also reached the FA Cup semi-final three times, most recently in 1992. Norwich have taken part in European competition just once, reaching the third round of the UEFA Cup in 1993-94. ==References== Records Category:English football club statistics ",
