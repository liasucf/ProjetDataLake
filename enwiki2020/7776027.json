    "text": "Easy Does It is the third solo album by American singer-songwriter Al Kooper, recorded and released in 1970 for Columbia Records. A double album, Easy Does It featured Kooper on an expanded number of instruments, including sitar (used to effect on the country-tinged \"Sad, Sad Sunshine\"), vibes and electronic effects. While mostly backed by Bretheren rhythm section Stu Woods and Rick Marotta, Kooper also utilized groups in Nashville and Los Angeles to record the tracks for the album. Two tracks were also featured on the soundtrack to the counter-culture film The Landlord, \"Brand New Day\" and \"Love Theme from The Landlord\". == Track listing == === Side 1 === # \"Brand New Day\" (Al Kooper) \u2013 5:10 # \"Piano Solo Introduction to I Got a Woman\" (2:00) # \"I Got a Woman\" (Ray Charles, Renald Richard) \u2013 4:30 # \"Country Road\" (James Taylor) \u2013 4:22 # \"I Bought You the Shoes (You're Walking Away In)\" (Bob Brass, Irwin Levine, Kooper) \u2013 1:57 === Side 2 === # \"Introduction\" (0:50) # \"Easy Does It\" (Kooper) \u2013 5:25 # \"Buckskin Boy\" (Kooper, Charlie Calello) \u2013 3:10 # \"Love Theme from The Landlord\" (Kooper) \u2013 3:12 === Side 3 === # \"Sad, Sad Sunshine\" (Kooper) \u2013 5:04 # \"Let the Duchess No\" (John Gregory, Jim Roberts) \u2013 3:17 # \"She Gets Me Where I Live\" (Kooper, Charlie Calello) \u2013 3:34 # \"A Rose and a Baby Ruth\" (J.D.
