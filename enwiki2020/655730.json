    "text": "Henry II (French: Henri II; 8 November 1563 \u2013 31 July 1624), known as \"the Good (le Bon)\", was Duke of Lorraine from 1608 until his death. Leaving no sons, both of his daughters became Duchesses of Lorraine by marriage. He was a brother-in-law of Henry IV of France. ==History and Family== He was the son of Charles III, Duke of Lorraine, and Claude of Valois, daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici. His paternal grandparents were Francis I, Duke of Lorraine, and Christina of Denmark. He married, firstly, Catherine de Bourbon, Duchess of Albret, daughter Antoine of Navarre and Jeanne d'Albret, sister of King Henry IV of France. The couple were married at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint Germain-en-Laye outside Paris on 31 January 1599. The bride was already 39 years of age and the union was merely to secure relations with the House of Bourbon which had previously been rivals with the House of Lorraine. As Catherine was a Protestant and Henry was a Catholic, a papal dispensation was needed for the two to marry. Pope Clement VIII refused to grant a dispensation, but Catherine's brother, Henry, convinced their illegitimate half-brother, Charles, Archbishop of Rouen, to officiate at the wedding. Catherine died childless in 1604, aged 45. With no issue from that union, Duke Henri married, secondly, Margherita Gonzaga on 24 April 1606 in Mantua. She was the eldest daughter of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua and his wife Eleonora de' Medici. Margherita's sister Eleonor Gonzaga was a future Holy Roman Empress. Henri was succeeded by his younger brother as Francis II, Duke of Lorraine. ==Issue== Henry and Margherita had four daughters, two of whom survived to adulthood: * Stillborn daughter (February 1607). * Nicole of Lorraine (3 October 1608 \u2013 23 February 1657), married her cousin, Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, separated in 1635. * A daughter (10 February 1611 - 11 February 1611). * Claude Fran\u00e7oise de Lorraine (6 October 1612 \u2013 2 August 1648), married her cousin, Nicholas II, Duke of Lorraine, ==Ancestry== ==Titles and styles== *8 November 1563 \u2013 14 May 1608 The Hereditary Prince of Lorraine *14 May 1608 \u2013 31 July 1624 His Highness The Duke of Lorraine ==See also== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * ==External links== Category:1563 births Category:1624 deaths Category:Dukes of Bar Category:Dukes of Lorraine Category:House of Lorraine Category:Marquesses of Nomeny Category:People from Nancy, France Category:Marquesses of Pont-\u00e0-Mousson Category:Princes of Lorraine Category:16th-century French people Category:17th-century French people Category:Hereditary Princes of Lorraine ",
