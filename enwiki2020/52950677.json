    "text": "The African U23 records in the sport of athletics are the all-time best marks set in competition by an athlete who competes for a member nation of the Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) by aged 22 or younger throughout the entire calendar year of the performance. Technically, in all under-23 age divisions, the age is calculated \"on December 31 of the year of competition\" to avoid age group switching during a competitive season. CAA doesn't maintain an official list for such performances. All bests shown on this list are tracked by statisticians not officially sanctioned by the governing body. ==Outdoor== ===Men=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width: 95%;\" |- !Event !Record !Athlete !Nationality !Date !Meet !Place !Age !Ref |- |100 m |9.85 (+1.7 m/s) |Olusoji Fasuba | |12 May 2006 | | Doha, Qatar | | |- |200 m |19.69 A (-0.5 m/s) |Clarence Munyai | |16 March 2018 |South African Championships | Pretoria, South Africa | | |- |400 m | | | | | | |- |800 m |1:41.01 |David Rudisha | |29 August 2010 |Rieti Meeting | Rieti, Italy | | |- |1000 m |2:11.96 |Noah Ngeny | |5 September 1999 |IAAF Grand Prix | Rieti, Italy | | |- |1500 m |3:28.12 |Noah Ngeny | |11 August 2000 |Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich | Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland | | |- |3000 m |7:20.67 |Daniel Komen | |1 September 1996 |Rieti Meeting | Rieti, Italy | | |- |5000 m |12:37.35 |Kenenisa Bekele | |31 May 2004 |Fanny Blankers-Koen Games | Hengelo, Netherlands | | |- |10000 m |26:20.31 |Kenenisa Bekele | |8 June 2004 |Golden Spike Ostrava | Ostrava, Czech Republic | | |- |10 km (road) |26:24 |Rhonex Kipruto | |12 January 2020 |10k Valencia Ibercaja |Valencia, Spain | | |- |Marathon |2:04:23 |Ayele Abshero | |27 January 2012 |Dubai Marathon | Dubai, United Arab Emirates | | |- |110 m hurdles | | | | | | |- |400 m hurdles | | | | | | |- |3000 m steeplechase | | | | | | |- |High jump | | | | | | |- |Pole vault | | | | | | |- |Long jump | | | | | | |- |Triple jump | | | | | | |- |Shot put | | | | | | |- |Discus throw | | | | | | |- |Hammer throw | | | | | | |- |Javelin throw | | | | | | |- |rowspan=2|Decathlon | | | | | | |- |colspan=6| | |- |20 km walk (road) | | | | | | |- |50 km walk (road) | | | | | | |- |4 \u00d7 100 m relay | | | | | | |- |4 \u00d7 400 m relay | | | | | | |} ===Women=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;
