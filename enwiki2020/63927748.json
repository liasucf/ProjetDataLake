    "text": "Cover Girl Strip Poker, alternately titled Cover Girl Poker, is a 1991 erotic video game based upon five-card strip poker and originally developed and self- published by Emotional Pictures; it was released for the Amiga, DOS, Commodore 64, CDTV, and CD32. Cover Girl Strip Poker is the original Danish title; it was retitled Cover Girl Poker outside of Denmark in the rest of Europe, and the title was subsequently reverted to Cover Girl Strip Poker for the European CDTV and CD-ROM DOS releases. Emotional Pictures was a subsidiary of Danish company InterActive Vision A/S. Cover Girl Strip Poker received negative to mixed reviews from critics; many reviews criticized Strip Pokers 'poor' digitized graphics, 'bad' AI, and several reviews criticized the game's sexual content, calling it 'unappealing' or 'sad'. While other versions of the game received more mixed reviews, reviews of the Commodore 64 version were universally negative. Some reviews criticized Strip Poker as sexist, with one magazine calling it \"an affront to the female species\". In addendum to this, Strip Poker has a legal disclaimer stating that the game is \"Not manufactured, distributed or endorsed by any of the models appearing in the product\"; a model featured in the game later stated that she was not informed what the video footage/photoshoot was for, and several models did not receive pay for their work. ==Gameplay== Cover Girl Strip Pokers graphics across several ports (as shown here in the Amiga version) were criticized by many reviewers. Reviews of the Commodore 64 version (pictured) of Strip Poker were universally negative. Cover Girl Strip Poker is played as five-card strip poker; the player plays against an AI opponent, and may choose between eight models. Strip Poker has a multiplayer mode wherein up to three people may play against a single AI opponent at once, with each player having their own pool of money to bet with. Each time the AI loses $2,000, a digitized female model removes one item of clothing in video footage presented on the screen of a digitized cinema; different models display varying levels of nudity. Each player is dealt a hand of five cards, and may replace any number of those cards with different cards from the deck in order to obtain a winning hand. Both the player and the AI are given $2,500 to bet with, the maximum bet being $999, and there are two rounds of betting: one before the changing of cards and one after. If the player's hand is better than their opponent's, the player wins the betted money, and the cards are shuffled and both players are given new hands of cards. The game is coded so that after winning several hands, subsequent hands are harder to win. Upon starting the game, the player is prompted to select a language; Cover Girl Strip Poker has releases in Danish, Swedish, English, French, German and Italian. The player may zoom in during the game's nude scenes. In Cover Girl Strip Poker, four of the eight models in-game have video footage alongside the standard still images; the frame rate and graphic quality of these videos differs between versions of the game. ===Version differences=== In the Commodore 64 version, there are six possible opponents as opposed to eight; Signe Andersen and Sofia Bratlund are missing from this version.Cover Girl Poker (1992).

As opposed to other versions, which require the AI to lose $2,000 multiple times for the game to show sexual content, in the Commodore 64 version of the game, only once is required. In the CDTV and CD-ROM DOS versions, the models' in-game banter with the player is voice acted, and the CDTV version also adds eleven music tracks. The CDTV version of Cover Girl Strip Poker has fifteen minutes of full motion video footage. In the Commodore 64 version of Strip Poker, the game's graphics are predominantly monochrome. ==Development== Tabloid magazine Daily Sport worked with Emotional Pictures in the development of Cover Girl Strip Poker in that models who have appeared in Daily Sport appear in the game: famous UK page 3 model Maria Whittaker, Amanda Godden, Minnie Champ (credited in-game as 'Ginny Champ'), Donna Ewin, , Sofia Bratlund, Signe Andersen, and a woman credited only as 'Jane'.Cover Girl Strip Poker (1991).

Cover Girl Strip Poker was exhibited at the Arets Amiga Expo in Copenhagen, Denmark in March 1992, and Trine Michelsen promoted the game at Emotional Pictures' booth while dressed in lingerie, singing karaoke with attendees. Danish gaming magazine Det Nye COMputer interviewed Trine Michelsen, who stated that she was not informed what the video footage and photos were for, and that other models were never paid for their work; she stated that she was paid 1000 Danish krone (equivalent to around US$265 in 1992), and that \"It was not at all clear what it would be for, and I did it as a favor [for someone I knew]. Apparently some of the other models weren't paid at all.\" COMputer briefly interviewed Kenneth Bernholm, the CEO of InterActive Vision A/S, the parent company of Emotional Pictures, to ask how much the models were paid, and Bernholm stated that \"You can ask, but you won't get an answer\". Cover Girl Strip Poker has a disclaimer explicitly stating that the game is \"Not manufactured, distributed or endorsed by any of the models appearing in the product\"; Amiga Power questioned the legality of this disclaimer. Due to standards for sexual content as set by The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment and the Video Standards Council, the CDTV version of Cover Girl Strip Poker was labelled with a BBFC 18 certificate; French gaming magazine Joystick speculated that On-Line Entertainment, the publisher of the European CDTV version, was intentionally seeking a mature rating for the game for the sake of publicitity. The CDTV release of Cover Girl Strip Poker is compatible with the Amiga CD32. According to Computer and Video Games magazine, ports of Cover Girl Poker were planned for the Atari ST and ZX Spectrum, but these were never released. A demo of the Amiga version of Cover Girl Strip Poker was featured on the cover disk of issue one, volume eight of Danish gaming magazine Det Nye COMputer, and a demo of the DOS version was released on the cover disk of issue 31 of Zero. Cover Girl Strip Pokers full motion video was recorded in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. The Danish, French, German, and English narration was recorded by Workstation 1, which also translated the game into French. The Swedish narration was recorded by Niklas Persson, who also performed the Swedish translation. Strip Poker was translated into German by Thomas Schmidt.Cover Girl Strip Poker (1991). Amiga.
