    "text": "Flag of the Southern African Vexillological Association The Southern African Vexillological Association (SAVA) was formed in November 1990 to promote vexillology in Southern Africa. Members of the association are drawn mainly from flag manufacturers, collectors, military historians and generally anyone with an interest in flags. SAVA became a member of the International Federation of Vexillological Associations (FIAV) at the 14th International Congress of Vexillology held in Barcelona in 1991 and was the host of the 17th International Congress of Vexillology which was held in Cape Town in August 1997. SAVA produces a Newsletter three times a year which deals with matters of local and international vexillological interest, new flags and matters relating to the running of the association. A more scholastic Journal is also published which deals with a particular research topic related to vexillology in southern Africa and is recognised internationally for its high standard. A series on all South African regimental colours and standards since 1652 has been published which is the most comprehensive record of such flags ever published in South Africa. SAVA has also published a series of Flag Specification Sheets focusing on the flags of Africa. Members of SAVA include the former State Herald of South Africa, Mr Frederick Brownell, who is credited with designing the flag of South Africa and the flag of Namibia. Members of the association have been involved in the design and manufacture of many other flags, particularly municipal, military and corporate flags in Southern Africa. The association has also become an important source of vexillological information and research, including more recently on the internet. Bruce Berry, a founder member, is an editor for Flags of the World, the premier vexillological website and was elected as Secretary General of FIAV in July 2019. == Objectives of the association == According to its constitution, SAVA has the following objectives: * To record and preserve any and all information relating to flags in general and the flags of Southern Africa in particular; * To undertake research and study programmes, organise conferences and symposia, and to exchange information on flags and related matters with similar Associations and Institutions elsewhere in the world; and * To act as an information source for the general public and any interested bodies on all matters pertaining to flags. SAVA is a non-profit, non-political and non-sectarian organisation that under no circumstances will become affiliated or associated with any political or religious body or sect. == Organization flag == The flag of the association is registered with the South African Bureau of Heraldry (Certificate Number 2362 issued on 4 October 1991) and is described as follows: A rectangular blue flag, proportion 3:2; bearing a gold chevron inverted, the tip couped, and in the centre five four-pointed stars, also white, conjoined in cross. Both the base and the tip of each chevron are respectively equal to half of the width of the flag, while the outer point of the stars in fess touch the conjunction of the chevrons. The symbolism of the flag is as follows: At least one of the colours in this flag can be found in the national flag of each country in Southern Africa. The gold inverted chevron (the \"V\") alludes to vexillology. The five white stars, which are derived from the Southern Cross, and the white chevron, in turn allude to Southern Africa. (The Southern Cross itself has not been used since it is more closely associated with the flag of Australia and the flag of New Zealand). == Principal officers == Flag Specification Sheet for the Zimbabwe flag produced by the Southern African Vexillological Association (as at April 2019) *Chairman \u2013 Father Peter Whitehead *Vice Chairman \u2013 Lt.
