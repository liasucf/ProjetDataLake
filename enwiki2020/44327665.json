    "text": "Unknown Skies is an album by American jazz saxophonist Rob Brown which was recorded live at 2010 Sons d'Hiver Festival in the suburbs of Paris, and released on the French RogueArt label. He leads a trio with pianist Craig Taborn and drummer Nasheet Waits. The group performed before at the 2009 Vision Festival. Brown thought the idea of such a trio, similar to the one which he formed on arriving New York in the mid-eighties with Matthew Shipp and Frank Bambara and took the name of Right Hemisphere, later a quartet for the eponymous album.Original liner Notes by Alexander Pierrepont ==Reception== The Down Beat review by Alain Drouot notes that \"Without a bass, the three musicians operate on a more leveled field, rely less on melodies, and have plenty of room to stretch and develop notions to the fullest.\"Drouot, Alain. Unexplained Phenomena review. Down Beat September 11: page 55. Print. The All About Jazz review by John Sharpe states \"Brown revels in the license to roam, engendered by Taborn and Waits' intersecting lines. One of that select band of instrumentalists, whose soloing isn't dependent on repeated motifs as much as a constantly unfurling narrative, the reedman thrills with his sustained brilliance.\"Sharpe, John. Unknown Skies review at All About Jazz In his review for JazzTimes Lyn Horton says \"This music is totally Rob Brown inspired, but also offers uniqueness in its contrasts.\"Horton, Lyn.
