    "text": "A ''''' ( ', , \"way to act\"; pl. ', ) is a school of thought within fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). The major Sunni madhhabs are Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali. They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries CE and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab. These four schools recognize each other's validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries. Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world. For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi'i school in East Africa and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia. The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs. The Zahiri school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought. The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the Twelver, Zaidi and Ismaili madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools. The Ibadi legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman. The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system. With the spread of codified state laws in the Muslim world, the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly drew on rulings from multiple madhhabs, and legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional ulema as interpreters of the resulting laws. In the 20th century many Islamic jurists began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional madhhabs. The Amman Message, which was endorsed in 2005 by prominent Islamic scholars around the world, recognized four Sunni schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali), two Shia schools (Ja'fari, Zaidi), the Ibadi school and the Zahiri school. == History == ===\"Ancient\" schools=== According to John Burton, \u201cmodern research shows\u201d that fiqh was first \u201cregionally organized\u201d with \u201cconsiderable disagreement and variety of view\u201d. In the second century of Islam, schools of fiqh were noted for the loyalty of their jurists to the legal practices of their local communities, whether Mecca, Kufa, Basra, Syria, etc.Burton, Islamic Theories of Abrogation, 1990: p.13 (Egypt's school in Fustat was a branch of Medina's school of law and followed such practices\u2014up until the end of the 8th century\u2014as basing verdict on one single witness (not two) and the oath of the claimant. Its principal jurist in the second half of the 8th century was al-Layth b. Sa'd.) Al-Shafi\u2018i writes that, `every capital of the Muslims is a seat of learning whose people follow the opinion of one of their countrymen in most of his teachings`. The \"real basis\" of legal doctrine in these \"ancient schools\" was not a body of reports of Muhammad's sayings, doings, silent approval (the ahadith) or even those of his Companions, but the `living tradition` of the school as \"expressed in the consensus of the scholars\", according to Joseph Schacht. ===Al-Shafi\u2018i and after=== It has been asserted that madhahib were consolidated in the 9th and 10th centuries as a means of excluding dogmatic theologians, government officials and non-Sunni sects from religious discourse. Historians have differed regarding the times at which the various schools emerged. One interpretation is that Sunni Islam was initially split into four groups: the Hanafites, Malikites, Shafi'ites and Zahirites.Mohammad Sharif Khan and Mohammad Anwar Saleem, Muslim Philosophy And Philosophers, pg. 34. New Delhi: Ashish Publishing House, 1994. Later, the Hanbalites and Jarirites developed two more schools; then various dynasties effected the eventual exclusion of the Jarirites;Christopher Melchert, The Formation of the Sunni Schools of Law: 9th-10th Centuries C.E., pg. 178. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. eventually, the Zahirites were also excluded when the Mamluk Sultanate established a total of four independent judicial positions, thus solidifying the Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools. During the era of the Islamic Gunpowders, the Ottoman Empire reaffirmed the official status of these four schools as a reaction to Shi'ite Persia.Chibli Mallat, Introduction to Middle Eastern Law, pg. 116. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007. Some are of the view that Sunni jurisprudence falls into two groups: Ahl al-Ra'i (\"people of opinions\", emphasizing scholarly judgment and reason) and Ahl al- Hadith (\"people of traditions\", emphasizing strict interpretation of scripture).Murtada Mutahhari, The Role of Ijtihad in Legislation, Al-Tawhid volume IV, No.2, Publisher: Islamic Thought Foundation 10th century Shi'ite scholar Ibn al-Nadim named eight groups: Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Zahiri, Imami Shi'ite, Ahl al-Hadith, Jariri and Kharijite.Devin J. Stewart, THE STRUCTURE OF THE FIHRIST: IBN AL-NADIM AS HISTORIAN OF ISLAMIC LEGAL AND THEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS, International Journal of Middle East Studies, v.39, pg.369-387, Cambridge University Press, 2007 In the 12th century Jariri and Zahiri schools were absorbed by the Shafi'i school. Ibn Khaldun defined only three Sunni madhahib: Hanafi, Zahiri, and one encompassing the Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali schools as existing initially,Ign\u00e1c Goldziher, The Zahiris, pg. 5. Trns.

Meinhaj Hussain, A New Medina, The Legal System, Grande Strategy, January 5th, 2012 noting that by the 14th- century historian the Zahiri school had become extinct, only for it to be revived again in parts of the Muslim world by the mid-20th century.Daniel W. Brown, Rethinking Tradition in Modern Islamic Thought: Vol. 5 of Cambridge Middle East Studies, pgs. 28 and 32. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. M.

Ed. Ibrahim Abu-Rabi'. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Historically, the fiqh schools were often in political and academic conflict with one another, vying for favor with the ruling government in order to have their representatives appointed to legislative and especially judiciary positions. Geographer and historian Al-Muqaddasi once satirically categorized competing madhahib with contrasting personal qualities: Hanafites, highly conscious of being hired for official positions, appeared deft, well- informed, devout and prudent; Malikites, dull and obtuse, confined themselves to observance of prophetic tradition; Shafi'ites were shrewd, impatient, understanding and quick-tempered; Zahirites haughty, irritable, loquacious and well-to-do; Shi'ites, entrenched and intractable in old rancor, enjoyed riches and fame; and Hanbalites, anxious to practice what they preached, were charitable and inspiring.Louis Massignon, The Passion of al-Hallaj: Mystic and Martyr of Islam. Trans. Herbert W. Mason. Pg. 130. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. While such descriptions were almost assuredly humorous in nature, ancient differences were less to do with actual doctrinal opinions than with maneuvering for adherents and influence. === Modern era === The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system. Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly utilized the methods of takhayyur (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and talfiq (combining parts of different rulings on the same question). Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional ulema as interpreters of the resulting laws. Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence. The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the Salafi and Wahhabi movements. In the 20th century many Islamic jurists began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional schools of jurisprudence. Examples of the latter approach include networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, who have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law. == List of schools == Some regions have a dominant or official madhhab; others recognize a variety.Jurisprudence and Law \u2013 Islam Reorienting the Veil, University of North Carolina (2009) Generally, Sunnis have a single preferred madhhab from region to region, but also believe that ijtihad must be exercised by the contemporary scholars capable of doing so. Most rely on taqlid, or acceptance of religious rulings and epistemology from a higher religious authority in deferring meanings of analysis and derivation of legal practices instead of relying on subjective readings.On Islam, Muslims and the 500 most influential figures Experts and scholars of fiqh follow the usul (principles) of their own native madhhab, but they also study the usul, evidences, and opinions of other madhahib. ===Sunni=== Sunni schools of jurisprudence are each named after the classical jurist who taught them. The four primary Sunni schools are the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali rites. The Zahiri school remains in existence but outside of the mainstream, while the Jariri, Laythi, Awza'i, Thawri, & Qurtubi have become extinct. The extant schools share most of their rulings, but differ on the particular practices which they may accept as authentic and the varying weights they give to analogical reason and pure reason. * The Hanafi school was founded by Abu Hanifa an-Nu\u2018man. It is followed by Muslims in the Levant, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, most of Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, the Balkans and by most of Russia's Muslim community. There are movements within this school such as Barelvis and Deobandi, which are concentrated in South Asia. * The Maliki school was founded by Malik ibn Anas. It is followed by Muslims in North Africa, West Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, in parts of Saudi Arabia and in Upper Egypt. The Murabitun World Movement follows this school as well. In the past, it was also followed in parts of Europe under Islamic rule, particularly Islamic Spain and the Emirate of Sicily. * The Shafi'i school was founded by Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i. It is followed by Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Eastern Lower Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Jordan, Palestine, the Philippines, Singapore, Somalia, Thailand, Yemen, Kurdistan, and the Mappilas of Kerala and Konkani Muslims of India. It is the official school followed by the governments of Brunei and Malaysia. * The Hanbali school was founded by Ahmad ibn Hanbal. It is followed by Muslims in Qatar, most of Saudi Arabia and minority communities in Syria and Iraq. The majority of the Salafis follow this school. * The Zahiri school was founded by Dawud al-Zahiri. It is followed by minority communities in Morocco and Pakistan. In the past, it was also followed by the majority of Muslims in Mesopotamia, Portugal, the Balearic Islands, North Africa and parts of Spain. ===Shia=== * Twelvers (see also Imami) ** Ja'fari: associated with Ja'far al- Sadiq. The time and space bound rulings of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school, likely due to the more hierarchical structure of Shia Islam which is ruled by the Shi'ite Imams. The Ja'fari school is also more flexible in that every jurist has considerable power to alter a decision according to his reasoning. The Jafari school uses the intellect instead of analogy when establishing Islamic laws, as opposed to common Sunni practice. *** Usulism: forms the overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination. They follow a Marja-i Taqlid on the subject of taqlid and fiqh. They are concentrated in Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iraq, and Lebanon. *** Akhbarism: similar to Usulis, however reject ijtihad in favor of hadith. Concentrated in Bahrain. *** Shaykhism: an Islamic religious movement founded by Shaykh Ahmad in the early 19th century Qajar dynasty, Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq. It began from a combination of Sufi and Shia and Akhbari doctrines. In the mid 19th-century many Shaykhis converted to the B\u00e1b\u00ed and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed religions, which regard Shaykh Ahmad highly. ** The Batiniyyah school consists of Alevis, Bektashis, and Alawites, who developed their own fiqh system and do not pursue the Ja'fari jurisprudence. *** Alawism is followed by Alawites, who are also called Nusayris, Nusairis, Namiriya or Ansariyya. Their madh'hab was established by Ibn Nusayr, and their aqidah is developed by Al-Kha\u1e63\u012bb\u012b. They follow Cill\u012b aqidah of \"Maym\u016bn ibn Abu\u2019l-Q\u0101sim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabar\u0101n\u012b fiqh\" of the \u2018Alawis.\"Muhammad ibn \u0100liyy\u2019\u016bl Cill\u012b aqidah\" of \"Maym\u016bn ibn Abu\u2019l-Q\u0101sim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabar\u0101n\u012b fiqh\" (S\u016blaiman Affandy, Al-B\u0101k\u016brat\u2019\u016bs S\u016blaiman\u2019\u012byyah - Family tree of the Nusayri Tariqat, pp. 14-15, Beirut, 1873.)Both Muhammad ibn \u0100liyy\u2019\u016bl Cill\u012b and Maym\u016bn ibn Abu\u2019l-Q\u0101sim\u2019at-Tabar\u0101n\u012b were the murids of \"Al-Kha\u1e63\u012bb\u012b\", the founder of the Nusayri tariqat. Slightly over one million of them live in Syria and Lebanon. *** Alevism, sometimes categorized as part of Twelver Shia Islam and sometimes as its own religious tradition, as it has markedly different philosophy, customs, and rituals. They have many Tasawwuf\u012b characteristics and express belief in the Qur'an and The Twelve Imams, but reject polygamy and accept religious traditions predating Islam, like Turkish shamanism. They are significant in East-Central Turkey. They are sometimes considered a Sufi sect, and have an untraditional form of religious leadership that is not scholarship oriented like other Sunni and Shia groups. They number around 24 million worldwide, of which 17 million are in Turkey, with the rest in the Balkans, Albania, Azerbaijan, Iran and Syria. *** Bektashism, similar to Alevism. Concentrated in Albania. * Ismaili Muslims who adhere to the Shi'a Ismaili Fatimid fiqh, follow the Daim al-Islam, a book on the rulings of Islam. It describes manners and etiquette, including Ibadat in the light of guidance provided by the Ismaili Imams. The book emphasizes what importance Islam has given to manners and etiquette along with the worship of God, citing the traditions of the first four Imams of the Shi'a Ismaili Fatimid school of thought. ** Nizari: the largest branch (95%) of Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b, they are the only Shia group to have their absolute temporal leader in the rank of Imamate, which is invested in the Aga Khan. Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs believe that the successor-Im\u0101m to the Fatimid caliph Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah was his elder son al-Niz\u0101r. While Niz\u0101r\u012b belong to the Ja'fari jurisprudence, they adhere to the supremacy of \"Kalam\", in the interpretation of scripture, and believe in the temporal relativism of understanding, as opposed to fiqh (traditional legalism), which adheres to an absolutism approach to revelation. ** T\u0101yyeb\u012b Must\u0101'l\u012byyah: the Mustaali group of Ismaili Muslims differ from the Niz\u0101riyya in that they believe that the successor-Im\u0101m to the Fatimid caliph, al- Mustansir, was his younger son al-Musta\u02bbl\u012b, who was made Caliph by the Fatimad Regent Al-Afdal Shahanshah. In contrast to the Nizaris, they accept the younger brother al-Musta\u02bbl\u012b over Niz\u0101r as their Imam. The Bohras are an offshoot of the Taiyabi, which itself was an offshoot of the Mustaali. The Taiyabi, supporting another offshoot of the Mustaali, the Hafizi branch, split with the Mustaali Fatimid, who recognized Al-Amir as their last Imam. The split was due to the Taiyabi believing that At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim was the next rightful Imam after Al-Amir. The Hafizi themselves however considered Al-Hafiz as the next rightful Imam after Al-Amir. The Bohras believe that their 21st Imam, Taiyab abi al-Qasim, went into seclusion and established the offices of the Da'i al-Mutlaq (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642), Ma'zoon (\u0645\u0623\u0630\u0648\u0646) and Mukasir (\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0633\u0631). The Bohras are the only surviving branch of the Mustaali and themselves have split into the Dawoodi Bohra, Sulaimani Bohra, and Alavi Bohra. * Zaidi jurisprudence follows the teachings of Zayd ibn Ali. In terms of law, the Zaidi school is quite similar to the Hanafi school from Sunni Islam.Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0646\u064a\u064a\u0646 (A short History of the Yemenite Shi\u2018ites, 2005) This is likely due to the general trend of Sunni resemblance within Zaidi beliefs. After the passing of Muhammad, Imam Jafar al-Sadiq, Imam Zayd ibn Ali, Imams Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik ibn Anas worked together in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina along with over 70 other leading jurists and scholars. Jafar al-Sadiq and Zayd ibn Ali did not themselves write any books. But their views are Hadiths in the books written by Imams Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik ibn Anas. Therefore, the Zaydis to this day and originally the Fatimids, used the Hanafi jurisprudence, as do most Sunnis. ===Ibadi === The Ibadi school of Islam is named after Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh, though he is not necessarily the main figure of the school in the eyes of its adherents. Ibadism is distinct from both Sunni and Shi'ite Islam not only in terms of its jurisprudence, but also its core beliefs. == Amman Message == The Amman Message was a statement, signed in 2005 in Jordan by nearly 200 prominent Islamic jurists, which served as a \"counter-fatwa\" against a widespread use of takfir (excommunication) by jihadist groups to justify jihad against rulers of Muslim-majority countries. The Amman Message recognized eight legitimate schools of Islamic law and prohibited declarations of apostasy against them. The Three Points of The Amman Message V.1 # Hanafi (Sunni) # Maliki (Sunni) # Shafi'i (Sunni) # Hanbali (Sunni) # Ja`fari (Shia) # Zaidiyyah (Shia) # Ibadiyyah # Zahiriyah The statement also asserted that fatwas can be issued only by properly trained muftis, thereby seeking to delegitimize fatwas issued by militants who lack the requisite qualifications. == See also == * Sharia (Islamic law) * Islamic schools and branches * Fiqh ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Books and articles=== * * Branon Wheeler, Applying the Canon in Islam: The Authorization and Maintenance of Interpretive Reasoning in \u1e24anaf\u012b Scholarship, SUNY Press, 1996. ==External links== * Category:Islamic terminology Category:Arabic words and phrases in Sharia Category:Islamic jurisprudence ",
