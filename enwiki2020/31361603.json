    "text": "Luv Ka The End () is a 2011 Hindi comedy drama film directed by Bumpy, starring Shraddha Kapoor and Taaha Shah in the lead roles. The film was the first production of Y-Films, a subsidiary of Yash Raj Films and released to mostly positive reviews on 6 May 2011. The film is also loosely based on the 2009 American film Wild Cherry and film John Tucker Must Die directed by Betty Thomas. ==Plot== Rhea Dialdas (Shraddha Kapoor) has just done her JC (Junior College) and she already fancies herself marrying her charming, rich boyfriend Luv Nanda (Taaha Shah). who in turn, fancies winning this contest called BBC (Billionaire Boys Club), which is a rage amongst billionaire boys. It is seen that the boys upload videos of themselves with girls, while making out and stuff, on the website, and the more you do so more you get the points. Luv Nanda was going to become the highest scorer that year. This was shown to Rhea by the brother of a friend of Rhea. The only way for Luv to win this contest was to get Rhea into bed with him on her 18th birthday eve as, this would've provided him another 1,000 points, which would've propelled his profile to untouchable heights for that year. She goes along naively until she realizes that it's not love, but points that Luv is trying to score. Now out to get him by the balls, she has a plan up her sleeve with her gal pals. Rhea believes that Luv has power as long as his Car, Cash, Charm, and his friends are intact. Rhea makes a pact with Minty (her sister) and then goes to take everything from Luv Nanda by which he attracts girls (who now wants to have Natasha in place of Rhea). She breaks his car, screws his date with Natasha as she accidentally eats the cupcake which was meant for Luv and she is forced to go to the toilet in a public road, spikes his drink with a kind of drug after which, comes the famous Mutton Song where, Luv dances in a bar, dressed up like a girl. The video of him dancing is sent to Luv's friends who believe he is gay and the girls steal his credit cards to buy hot posters of actors and mankinis so that Luv's father thinks he is gay. Then, at Golu's party, where Freddie Kapoor (Ali Zafar) came to play, she takes Luv to a room where hidden cameras were put to shoot the whole proceeding. Luv, who's found out about Rhea's plan, ties Rhea's hands. But, she unties herself and sprays pepper- spray on Luv to take revenge on him for leaving her and makes him realize the consequences of cheating a girl, and proceeds to tell him that, though girls don't have balls, they sure do know how to kick them after which, she kicks Luv's balls. Before she comes out of the room, she announces that Billionaire Boys Club is officially shut down. When she comes out of the room, she finds everyone cheering for her. Natasha finds out that Rhea destroyed her car, but she forgives Rhea for doing that. Everyone goes to Freddie Kapoor's concert and watches him sing. They all clap for him. Rhea's parents call them and tell them to come back home just in time. Freddie Kapoor witnesses this and asks them if he can drop them off, in which they say \"yes\". The film proceeds to have Freddie Kapoor drop Rhea at her home and asking Rhea for a date to which Rhea replies by telling him to call her. In a semi post-credits scene, we see Timmy telling Luv that he (Timmy) is gay and he knows that so is Luv (part of the plan of the girls) and jumps on him after lowering his pants. ==Cast== * Shraddha Kapoor as Rhea Dialdas * Taaha Shah as Luv Nanda * Pushtiie Shakti as Jugs * Sreejita De as Sonia Lovani * Errol Marks as Gollu * Meherzan Mazda as Timmy * Riya Bamniyal as Natasha Oberoi * Rahul Pardasany as Karthikeyan Ramachandran * Shenaz Treasurywala as Ms.Naaz * Archana Puran Singh as Lux Lovani (Sonia's Mother) * Jannat Zubair Rahmani as Minty Dialdas (Rhea's Sister) * Bumpy as Daman Ramachandran (Kartikeyan Brother) ==Soundtrack== The music is composed by Ram Sampath.

Entertainment portal FilmiTadka stated \u2013 Luv Ka The End is like what Rock music (not in the good sense) is to a Jazz lover, instead of a solid script, the director has tried to fill in voids with noise. Song 'Mutton' to me will the most vulgar song of this year, we at FilmiTadka give it 1.5 out of 5 stars. Anupama Chopra of NDTV said \u2013 \"Sensibility of this film is not youthful, it's juvenile. And that's before you get to the part where Luv, under the influence of some pill, dresses in drag and breaks into a song that goes: Mera jism, jism, mera badan, badan, main hun taza mutton mutton, khol dilon ke button button. I\u2019m not sure what demographic that is aimed at but it definitely not for me. I\u2019m going with one and a half star\". == References == ==External links== * * Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:Indian films Category:Films scored by Ram Sampath Category:Films set in Mumbai Category:2011 films Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:Indian remakes of American films Category:Films distributed by Yash Raj Films Category:2011 romantic comedy films ",
