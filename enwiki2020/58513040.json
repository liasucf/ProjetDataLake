The building also contains a fully functioning trial courtroom used for moot court. It houses Lady Justice, the -tall, statue formerly located on the roof of the Marion County Courthouse. ==History== The $1.1 million facility opened in September 1967. The law school building was named in honor of Truman W. Collins, a Willamette University alumni and well known businessman and philanthropist.\"Legal Center a Milestone\", Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, 30 August 1967, p. 28. In 1992, the Collins Legal Center went through an award-winning renovation and expansion that ended with a dedication ceremony and speech by former U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. In her dedication speech, O'Connor advocated for civility among those in the legal profession and for avoiding personal attacks among lawyers. In December 2005, the school's moot courtroom was used for a real civil trial after the Marion County Courthouse was damaged the previous month. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1967 establishments in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1967 Category:Willamette University buildings Category:Willamette University College of Law ",
