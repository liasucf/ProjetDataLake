San Lorenzo was originally a Jesuit church, built between 1684 and 1694 to replace an earlier building of more modest proportions. The work was financed and sponsored by Francisca de San V\u00edtores and erected by Bernab\u00e9 de Hazas and Francisco del Pont\u00f3n. After the expulsion of the Jesuits in the late eighteenth century, the church became a parish church. Since its creation in 1945, the church has been the seat of the Brotherhood of Coronaci\u00f3n de Espinas y de Cristo Rey. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Burgos Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1694 Category:17th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:1694 establishments in Spain ",
