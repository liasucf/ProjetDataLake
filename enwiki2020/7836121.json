    "text": "\"Rich Girl\" is a song by Daryl Hall & John Oates. It debuted on the Billboard Top 40 on February 5, 1977 at number 38 and on March 26, 1977, it became their first (of six) number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The single originally appeared on the 1976 album Bigger Than Both of Us. At the end of 1977, Billboard ranked it as the 23rd biggest hit of the year. ==Content== The song's lyrics are about a spoiled girl who can rely on her parents' money to do whatever she wants. The song was rumored to be about the then-scandalous newspaper heiress Patty Hearst. In fact, the title character in the song is based on a spoiled heir to a fast-food chain who was an ex-boyfriend of Daryl Hall's girlfriend, Sara Allen. \"But you can't write, 'You're a rich boy' in a song, so I changed it to a girl,\" Hall told Rolling Stone. Hall elaborated on the song in an interview with American Songwriter: > \"Rich Girl\" was written about an old boyfriend of Sara [Allen]'s from > college that she was still friends with at the time. His name is Victor > Walker. He came to our apartment, and he was acting sort of strange. His > father was quite rich. I think he was involved with some kind of a fast-food > chain. I said, \"This guy is out of his mind, but he doesn't have to worry > about it because his father's gonna bail him out of any problems he gets > in.\" So I sat down and wrote that chorus. [Sings] \"He can rely on the old > man's money/he can rely on the old man's money/he's a rich guy.\" I thought > that didn't sound right, so I changed it to \"Rich Girl\". He knows the song > was written about him. Several years later, Hall read an interview with serial killer David Berkowitz, in which he claimed that \"Rich Girl\" had motivated him to commit the notorious \"Son of Sam\" murders (although the song was not released until after the Son of Sam murders had already begun, casting doubts on that suggestion). Hall & Oates later reflected this disturbing fact in the lyrics of the song \"Diddy Doo Wop (I Hear the Voices)\" on the album Voices. ==Personnel== * Daryl Hall \u2013 lead vocals, backing vocals, keyboards * John Oates \u2013 backing vocals, rhythm guitars * Christopher Bond \u2013 keyboards * James Getzoff \u2013 conductor * Leland Sklar \u2013 bass * Jim Gordon \u2013 drums * Gary Coleman \u2013 percussion ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1977) !Peak position |- |Australia Kent Music Report |align=\"center\"|6 |- |Canada RPM Top Singles |align=\"center\"|5 |- |Canada RPM Adult Contemporary | style=\"text- align:center;\"|45 |- |The Netherlands |align=\"center\"|15 |- |New Zealand |align=\"center\"|33 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|1 |- |} ===Year- end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1977) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Position |- |Australia | style=\"text- align:center;\"|45 |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|50 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|23 |} ==Certifications== ==Selwyn version== Australian R&B; singer Selwyn recorded his own version of \"Rich Girl\" in 2002.
