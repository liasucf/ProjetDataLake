There is an eco-tourism complex at the entrance of the sanctuary that houses a nature interpretation centre, cottages, toilets, library, reception area, rescue centre, canteen, children's park, and forest ranger office. The sanctuary is known for its dense forest of tall trees, some of which reach 30 metres in height. The forest supports moist deciduous trees, semi-evergreen trees, and evergreen trees. A special feature of the sanctuary is a treetop watchtower positioned 25 metres above a watering hole where animals go to drink. The best times to visit the watchtower are dawn and dusk when animals are most likely to be visiting.http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/01/22/stories/2007012200090200.htm Animals in the sanctuary include the flying squirrel, slender loris, Indian pangolin, mouse deer, four-horned antelope, Malabar pit viper, hump-nosed pit viper, white-bellied woodpecker, Malabar trogon, velvet-fronted nuthatch, heart-spotted woodpecker, speckled piculet, Malayan bittern, draco or flying lizard, golden-back gliding snake, and Malabar tree toad. Eight nature trails traverse the sanctuary, ranging from 500 metres to 5 kilometres long. Several tribal groups live in and around the sanctuary including the Velip and the Kunbil. Visitors can interact with these communities to learn about their culture and lifestyle. ==References== * Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary Photographs, 2012 * The Hindu: Sanctuary Spotlight: Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary , 2007 Category:North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests Category:Wildlife sanctuaries of the Western Ghats Category:Wildlife sanctuaries in Goa Category:Geography of South Goa district Category:Tourist attractions in South Goa district ",
