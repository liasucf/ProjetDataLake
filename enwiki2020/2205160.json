    "text": "Travis John \"Chunks\" Friend (born 7 January 1981) is a former Zimbabwean Test and One Day International cricketer. Friend was born in Kwekwe, Midlands. He captained Zimbabwe in four under-19 ODIs and went on to play a full senior ODI for Zimbabwe aged 19. A stress fracture to his back set him back, but he later returned to the Test squad. Capable of bowling genuine pace, he was often wayward and lacked the necessary control to be a success on the international stage. He was quick nevertheless, bowling briskly during the 2003 CWC and the months following during the sides tour of England. He bowled a hostile spell to Alan Butcher at Lords, in which he was clocked at just under 90 mph. In addition to his ability to bowl with pace and hostility, he could hold a bat, often being used in the role of pinch hitter for his side, very much in the mould of Andy Blignaut. One of the 15 \"rebels\" of Zimbabwean cricket, his international cricket career ended in 2004. In 2005 he was contracted by Derbyshire but made little impact in the County Championship and was not retained for 2006. In 2009 he signed up for the summer with Castletown Cricket Club on the Isle of Man \u2013 the first time any of the island's teams could boast a former Test player. He is now a commercial pilot and has worked for airlines such as Flybe and Qatar Airways. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Kwekwe Category:Cricketers at the 2003 Cricket World Cup Category:CFX Academy cricketers Category:Derbyshire cricketers Category:Midlands cricketers Category:Zimbabwe One Day International cricketers Category:Zimbabwe Test cricketers Category:Zimbabwean Under-19 ODI captains Category:Zimbabwean cricketers Category:Alumni of St. George's College, Harare Category:Commercial aviators ",
