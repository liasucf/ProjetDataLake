    "text": "Among the categories of names for sports teams, those referring to Indigenous peoples are lesser in popularity only to the names of various animals (Eagles, Tigers, Bulldogs, Panthers, Wildcats, Lions, Cougars). In the top ten, \"Warriors\" is number six, and \"Indians\" is number eight. The typical logo is an image of a stereotypical Native American man in profile, wearing a Plains Indians headdress; some are more realistic, while others are cartoons or caricatures. Other imagery include dreamcatchers, feathers, spears, and arrows. Individual schools may have performance traditions, such as the tomahawk chop, a mascot or cheerleaders in stereotypical Native attire, and chants adapted from Hollywood movies. These fictional representations stand in the way of any authentic understanding of contemporary Indigenous peoples, and promote racism. The documents most often cited to justifying the trend for change are an advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Both support the views of Native American organizations and individuals that such mascots maintain harmful stereotypes that are discriminatory and cause harm by distorting the past and preventing understanding of Native American/First Nations peoples in the present. The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two-thirds having been eliminated during the 50 years prior to 2013 according to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI). In more recent years, the trend has accelerated, particularly in July 2020, following a wave of racial awareness and reforms in wake of national protests after the killing of George Floyd, and the decision by the Washington Football Team to change their Redskins name and logo. In a few states with significant Native American populations, change has been mandated by law, such in Wisconsin, Oregon, and Washington. A bill to ban Native American mascots statewide passed the Maine House of Representatives and Senate and was signed into law by Governor Janet Mills in May, 2019. The list below for secondary schools in the United States and Canada remains substantial, with over 400 teams currently calling themselves \"Indians\", over 100 \"Braves\", over 100 \"Warriors\" using indigenous imagery (there are many with the name using generic, Greek or Roman mascots), and 44 \"Redskins\". The latter has shown the greatest decline, due to an association with the Washington Redskins name controversy. ==Current usage== The following schools are listed in alphabetical order by team name: === Apaches === * Antonian College Preparatory High School, San Antonio, Texas \u2013 a co-educational Catholic high school * Arcadia High School, Arcadia, California * Arcola Intermediate School, Eagleville, Pennsylvania * Arlington Country Day School, Jacksonville, Florida \u2013 private college-prep K\u201312 * Centennial High School, Compton, California * Fairview High School, Sherwood, Defiance County, Ohio * Fort Thomas High School, Fort Thomas, Arizona \u2013 93% Native American * Glenbrook School, Minden, Louisiana \u2013 A private K-12 school, it has an annual \"Apache Princess\" pageant. The school was established when the public Minden High School was desegregated in 1966., and in 1970 was decertified from receiving public assistance as being a segregation academy. In a 1977 court case against 14 private schools in Louisiana, Glenbrook was again cited as a segregated school. While now asserting its nondiscriminatory status, the school remains 92.8 percent white, with no Native American students. * Gonzales High School, Gonzales, Texas * Nogales High School, Nogales, Arizona * Pottsville High School, Pottsville, Arkansas * Sanger High School, Sanger, California * Wabash High School, Wabash, Indiana ===Arrows=== The following use Native American arrows, feathers, or arrowheads in their logos: * Arrowhead Elementary School, Collegeville, Pennsylvania * Ashland High School, Ashland, Ohio * Clinton High School, Clinton, Mississippi * Lancaster High School, Lancaster, Wisconsin * Pipestone Area High School, Pipestone, Minnesota * Preble Shawnee High School, Camden, Ohio * Sachem High School East, Farmingville, New York * Sachem High School North, Lake Ronkonkoma, New York - (Flaming Arrows) * Tecumseh High School, New Carlisle, Ohio * Watertown High School, Watertown, South Dakota \u2013 For homecoming, Watertown selects a Princess and Chieftain, who along with the other members of the royal court, dress in faux Indian costumes. === Aztecs === * Assabet Valley Regional Technical High School, Marlborough, Massachusetts * Barstow High School, Barstow, California * El Dorado High School, El Paso, Texas * Esperanza High School, Anaheim, California * Farmersville High School, Farmersville, California * La Quinta High School, Westminster, California * Mark Keppel High School, Alhambra, California * Mendota Junior High School, Mendota, California * Montgomery High School, San Diego, California * Palm Desert High School, Palm Desert, California * Soledad High School, Soledad, California * Yerba Buena High School, San Jose, California \u2013 mascot: Aztec Warrior * William Moreno Junior High School, Calexico, California ===Big Reds=== * Bellaire High School, Bellaire, Ohio * Centerville High School, Centerville, Iowa * Parkersburg High School, Parkersburg, West Virginia * Sexton High School, Lansing, Michigan * West Middlesex Jr/Sr High School, West Middlesex, Pennsylvania ===Blackhawks=== Most of the schools with the name use a bird logo, therefore are not directly derived from an indigenous people although there may be an indirect reference to Chief Black Hawk.

After input from the Nipmuc Tribal Council that no Native mascots are flattering, the school board decided to change the name. In October, \"Red Hawks\" was chosen initially as the new mascot by the Board of Education. However, the name change became an issue in the 2019 municipal elections, leading to record turnout and Republican victories. In December after a contentious meeting the Board decided to have no mascot. In January, 2020 the new school board, now with a Republican majority, voted to reinstate the Redmen mascot. Calling the change and reversion \"a mockery of the process\", Connecticut Speaker of the House Joe Aresimowicz announced the consideration of legislation to ban all Native American nicknames and logos statewide which would effect 19 high schools, including Killingly. * Marquette Senior High School, Marquette, Michigan - During a discussion of changing the name Bill Saunders, Superintendent of the Marquette Area Public Schools said \u201cRegardless of what side of that issue you\u2019re on, as educators, we see within the school was is a certain amount of bullying and harassment [of Native American students] that\u2019s taking place.\u201d * Parma Senior High School, Parma, Ohio * Rock Hill Senior High School, Ironton, Ohio * Sisseton High School, Sisseton, South Dakota * Smith Center High School, Smith Center, Kansas * Tewksbury Memorial High School, Tewksbury, Massachusetts === Reds === * Calaveras High School, San Andreas, California - When a state law required dropping the Redskins, no new name was selected in 2016 and their Native logo was retained.

With the attention to racial justice as an issue in June 2020, the name has again drawn scrutiny, noting the lack of Native American education at the school, and the name referring to an honorific that is inappropriate for a sports team. The Pentucket School Committee is set to decide the fate of the Sachem mascot tentatively at their second meeting in September. * Saugus High School, Saugus, Massachusetts * Laconia High School, Laconia, New Hampshire === Sauras === * South Stokes High School, Walnut Cove, North CarolinaSouth Stokes High School, North Carolina ===Savages=== * Broken Bow High School, Broken Bow, Oklahoma * Lamar High School, Lamar, Colorado * Leflore High School, Leflore, Oklahoma * Quinton High School, Quinton, Oklahoma * Salmon High School, Salmon, Idaho * Salmon River High School, Salmon River, Idaho * Savannah High School, Savannah, Missouri * Sigourney Junior/Senior High School, Sigourney, Iowa * Tecumseh High School, Tecumseh, Oklahoma * Wynnewood High School, Wynnewood, Oklahoma === Scouts === * Lake Forest High School, Lake Forest, Illinois \u2013 Some logos use Native American images or spear === Seminoles === * Creekside High School, Fairburn, Georgia * Monroe Central High School, Woodsfield, Ohio * Osceola High School, Osceola, Arkansas * Salem High School, Conyers, Georgia * Southeast High School, Bradenton, Florida * Westside High School, Macon, Georgia * Toms River Intermediate School South, Beachwood, New Jersey === Senecas === * Calvert High School, Tiffin, Ohio === Sioux === * Solen High School, Standing Rock Reservation, Solen, North Dakota * Westhope High School, Westhope, North Dakota ===Squaws=== * Albany High School, Albany, Georgia \u2013 Boys' teams are \"Indians\" * Bellmont High School, Decatur, Indiana \u2013 Boys' teams are \"Braves\" * Dodge County High School, Eastman, Georgia \u2013 Boys' teams are \"Indians\" * Jourdanton High School, Jourdanton, Texas \u2013 Boys' teams are \"Indians\" === Thunderbirds === Although the thunderbird is a creature in Native American mythology, these school's logos/mascots may come from indirect associations with the United States Air Force Thunderbirds or the Ford Thunderbird. * Bellevue West High School, Bellevue, Nebraska - Offutt Air Force Base is located in Bellevue * Edsel Ford High School, Dearborn, Michigan - Dearborn is the location of the Ford Motor Company headquarters. * Johnson County Central High School, Tecumseh, Nebraska * Mount Tahoma High School, Tacoma, Washington * North Callaway High School, Kingdom City, Missouri * Park Crossing High School, Montgomery, Alabama * Thornwood High School, South Holland, Illinois * Timpview High School, Provo, Utah * Tumwater High School, Tumwater, Washington === Tomahawk(s) === * Algonquin Regional High School, Northborough, Massachusetts \u2013 Often referred to as the T-Hawks, logo is either a giant \"A\" or two tomahawks crossing each other * Marysville Pilchuck High School, Marysville, Washington \u2013 The logo is \"MP\" with the nickname, no image. === Tribe === Two schools that dropped the Redskins name, in compliance with California law, choose Tribe as a new name to retain their logo and other Native American imagery. * Chowchilla Union High School, Chowchilla, California * Tulare Union High School, Tulare, California === Wamps === * Braintree High School, Braintree, Massachusetts \u2013 Nickname derived from the Wampanoag people === Warrior(s) === A number of schools with the name \"Warriors\" never used indigenous imagery, or changed in response to the controversy. == Prior usage == {| !
