He is one of the inductees on the Avenue of Stars in Hong Kong. Yuen is also a son of Yuen Siu-tien, a renowned martial arts film actor. ==Life and career== Yuen was born in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. With a support of Ng See-yuen, he achieved his first directing credit in 1978 on the seminal Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, starring Jackie Chan, followed quickly by Drunken Master. The films were smash hits, launching Jackie Chan as a major film star, turning Seasonal Films into a major independent production company, and starting a trend towards comedy in martial arts films that continues to the present day. Yuen went on to work with such figures as Sammo Hung in Magnificent Butcher (1979), Yuen Biao in Dreadnaught (1981), Donnie Yen in Iron Monkey (1993), and Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh in Tai Chi Master (1993), and Wing Chun (1994). Yuen's works, particularly his action choreography on Fist of Legend (1994), attracted the attention of the Wachowskis, who hired him as the martial arts choreographer on The Matrix (1999). The success of this collaboration, plus his action choreography on the following year's hit Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, made him a highly sought after figure in Hollywood. He went on to work on the Matrix sequels and Kill Bill (2003). More recent action choreography duties in Hong Kong cinema have included Kung Fu Hustle (2004), starring Stephen Chow, and Fearless (2006), starring Jet Li. Yuen also choreographed the action sequences in The Forbidden Kingdom (2008), a Hollywood martial arts\u2013adventure film, which was the first film to star together two of the best-known names in the martial arts film genre, Jackie Chan and Jet Li. He worked as a fight choreography consultant on Ninja Assassin (2009). In late 2010, Yuen released his first film as director since 1996, True Legend, starring Vincent Zhao and Jay Chou. Yuen went on to work as stunt co-ordinator in two South Indian films, Enthiran (2010) and I (2014), both directed by S. Shankar. In 2015, Yuen directed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny, re-creating many of his signature action choreographies. ==Filmography== ===As director=== Yuen's star on the Avenue of Stars * Snake in the Eagle's Shadow (1978) (Cantonese title: Se ying diu sau) * Drunken Master (1978) (Cantonese title: Jui kuen) * Dance of the Drunk Mantis (1979) (Mandarin title: Nan bei zui quan) * Magnificent Butcher (1979) (Mandarin title: Lin shi rong) * The Buddhist Fist (1980) (Mandarin title: Fo Zhang luo han quan) * Dreadnaught (1981) (Mandarin title: Yong zhe wu ju) * The Miracle Fighters (1982) (Qi men dun jia) * Legend of a Fighter (1982) (Huo Yuan-Jia) * Shaolin Drunkard (1983) (Tian shi zhuang xie) * Drunken Tai Chi (1984) (Xiao tai ji) * Mismatched Couples (1985) (Qing feng di shou) * Dragon Vs.
