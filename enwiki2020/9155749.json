He was the son of Major Thomas Brooke Sr. and Esquire (1632\u20131676) and his second wife Eleanor Hatton (1642\u20131725) who later remarried Col. Henry Darnall (1645-1711). In 1720, he was elected President of the Governor's Council, (upper house of the colonial Maryland General Assembly)Warfield, J. D., p48 The Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties Maryland Retrieved August 2, 2010 and acting (12th), Governor of Maryland from the departure of 11th Gov. John Hart until the arrival of Charles Calvert, fifth Lord Baltimore (1699-1751). Brooke Jr. was replaced as the 14th governor by Captain Charles Calvert, (1638-1754), cousin of the Lord Baltimore, and a Calvert family loyalist.Yentsch, Anne E, p.56, A Chesapeake Family and their Slaves: a Study in Historical Archaeology, Cambridge University Press (1994) Retrieved Jan 2010 ==Biography== Thomas was born in 1660 near Nottingham, Prince George's County, Maryland, in Calvert (after 1696 Prince George's) Co., Maryland. He was commissioned Major of the Militia and promoted to Colonel. ===Career=== Charles Calvert, 3rd Lord Baltimore Thomas was one of the Justices for Calvert County. Thomas was a justice of the peace for Calvert County in 1679-1681; 1685-1689. Thomas was a vestryman of St. Paul's Parish, Calvert County. He was removed from his justiceship probably due to his opposition to the revolution Protestant Associators in 1689. He was nominated by Charles Calvert (1637\u20131715), 3rd Lord Baltimore to become a member of the first royal Council, commonly known as the Upper House, on August 26, 1691. He was probably appointed in an effort to mollify the proprietor after his loss of the colony. Thomas served as a member of the Council of Maryland from 1692-1707. He took the oath of office as a justice of the Provincial Court on May 1, 1694. He was appointed Deputy Secretary of Maryland the following year, and in 1699 was Commissary General of the Province. Thomas was dismissed from all offices by the Governor of Maryland, John Seymour, (1649\u20131709), in 1708 as a result of close Roman Catholic ties - his brothers were Jesuits and Col. Henry Darnall (1645\u20131711) was his stepfather-and for poor Council attendance, although his attendance had been very regular prior to Seymour's governorship. Brooke was reappointed to the same position after the colony reverted to proprietary control, and served from 1715-1722. ===Governor of Maryland=== In 1720 he was elected President of the Council, and acting Governor of Maryland from the departure of Gov. John Hart until the arrival of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore. He was replaced as governor by Captain Charles Calvert, cousin of Lord Baltimore, and a Calvert family loyalist. The reason for his second dismissal from the Council in 1722, is unclear. Unlike his parents and brothers, he was a member of the Church of England and reared his family in that faith. He was one of the first vestryman of St. Paul's Parish. Thomas resided at \"Brookefield\", his estate on Mattaponi Creek near the Patuxent River, which he inherited from his father. The land was formerly in Calvert County, but in 1696 became Prince George's County when it was formed. In addition to \"Brookefield\", Col.

At the time of his death on January 7, 1730 at \"Brookefield\", Thomas had amassed over 7,000 acres (28 km\u00b2) of land, in which a majority was heavily mortgaged. His estate value was listed at 1,374 pounds, including proceeds of the sale of land, and 36 slaves. ==Marriages== In about 1679 he married Anne Addison.
