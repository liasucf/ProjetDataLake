The practice's name comes from the fact that it was, and still is, popular in Britain. The technique used to paper piece involves wrapping paper shapes in fabric and then stitching the fabric together. Once a shape, bloc, rosette, or finished piece has been made, the papers are removed, leaving the fabric as the remaining item. == References == Category:Quilting ",
