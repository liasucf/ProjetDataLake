    "text": "In mathematics, the Andrews\u2013Curtis conjecture states that every balanced presentation of the trivial group can be transformed into a trivial presentation by a sequence of Nielsen transformations on the relators together with conjugations of relators, named after James J. Andrews and Morton L. Curtis who proposed it in 1965. It is difficult to verify whether the conjecture holds for a given balanced presentation or not. It is widely believed that the Andrews\u2013Curtis conjecture is false. While there are no counterexamples known, there are numerous potential counterexamples.Open problems in combinatorial group theory It is known that the Zeeman conjecture on collapsibility implies the Andrews\u2013Curtis conjecture. ==References== * * Category:Combinatorial group theory Category:Conjectures Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics ",
