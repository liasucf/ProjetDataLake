The front facade features a centered, double-tier pedimented, front-gabled portico with bracketed cornice and unfluted Doric order columns. Also on the property is a contributing one-story, rectangular, beaded weatherboard building that once housed a doctor's office (1833). In January 2008, the Harmony Plantation was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==See also== * List of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina ==References== Category:Plantation houses in North Carolina Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Houses completed in 1833 Category:Greek Revival houses in North Carolina Category:Houses in Wake County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wake County, North Carolina ",
