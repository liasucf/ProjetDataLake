    "text": "Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h was the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. He was born in 1817 to Khad\u00edjih Kh\u00e1num and M\u00edrz\u00e1 Buzurg of Nur (in the province of Mazandaran), a Persian nobleman, and went on to be a leader in the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement, and then established the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1863. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's family consists of his three wives and the children of those wives. ==Titles of descendants== One of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's titles is Sadratu'l-Muntah\u00e1, which translates from Arabic as the tree beyond which there is no passing (a quote from Qur\u02bcan 53:14). In this connection, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h entitled his descendants with terms relating to the Sadratu'l-Muntah\u00e1. His male descendants were given the title of Ag\u035fhs\u00e1n (Arabic for \"Branches\") which in singular form is \"G\u035fhusn\". In particular, three of his sons were given specific \"branch\" titles: * \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 (given name, Abb\u00e1s): G\u035fhu\u1e63n-i-A\u02bb\u1e93am ( \"The Most Great Branch\"). * M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed: G\u035fhu\u1e63n-i-Akbar, ( \"The Greater Branch\").G\u035fhusn-i-A\u02bb\u1e93am and G\u035fhusn-i- Akbar can both be translated as \"the great branch\", \"the greater branch\" or \"the most great branch\". A\u02bb\u1e93am carries a higher status in Arabic (see , or ), so Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed authors and others translate \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's title as \"Most Great\" and Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed's title as \"Greater\" (Taherzadeh, 2000, p. 256.). The designations of G\u035fhusn-i-A\u02bb\u1e93am and G\u035fhusn-i-Akbar are clear. (Browne, 1918, p. 61, & p. 85 ) * M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed: G\u035fhu\u1e63n-i-Athar, ( \"The Purest Branch\"). His daughters were given the title of Varaqat (translated from Arabic as \"Leaves\"). Thus Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's eldest daughter, Bah\u00edyyih (given name, Fatimih), was given the title of the Greatest Holy Leaf. During Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's lifetime, he referred to his eldest son, Abb\u00e1s, by terms such as \"Sirru'll\u00e1h\" (Mystery of God), or \"Sark\u00e1r-i-\u00c1q\u00e1\" (the Master). After the death of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, he chose the title \"\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1\" (Servant of Bah\u00e1). Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h did not give his descendants any direct right to the property of others. This contrasts with Shi\u02bba Islam in which sayyids were given special financial entitlements. == \u00c1s\u00edyih == \u00c1siyih was born in 1820 in the village Yalrud, Mazandaran. Her father was Mirza Isma\u02bbil-i-Vazir, a powerful and wealthy Persian nobleman. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h addressed her as Navv\u00e1b, and the Most Exalted Leaf. She was chosen to marry the young Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h based on her rare physical beauty, wealth and piety. The family had pre-existing roots with Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's family by virtue of their influence in the royal court which may have influenced the marriage arrangements. They married some time between 24 September and 22 October 1835 aged 15 in Tehran and she had seven of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's children, of whom only three lived to adulthood. She died in 1886 in \u02bbAkk\u00e1, and is buried on Mount Carmel within the vicinity of the Shrine of the B\u00e1b. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h named her his \"perpetual consort\" and her son as his vicar. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds regard the children of \u00c1s\u00edyih and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h to be the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed \"holy family\". Her children were: === \u02bbAbbas Effendi === Abbas Effendi Better known as \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, \u02bbAbbas was born in 1844 and died in 1921. He was the oldest child of \u00c1s\u00edyih and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. He was variously referred to by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h as \"Mystery of God\", \"The Master\", \"Perfect Exemplar\" and \"the Most Great Branch\". After Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h named \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 as Centre of the Covenant, successor and interpreter of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's writings. During his time as head of the religion, while still a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire, he met with many pilgrims and was in constant communication with Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world. After the 1908 Young Turks revolution freed all political prisoners in the Ottoman Empire, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was freed from imprisonment and in 1910, with the freedom to leave the country, he embarked on a three-year journey to Egypt, Europe, and North America, spreading the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed message. On 27 April 1920, he was awarded a knighthood by the British Mandate of Palestine for his humanitarian efforts during World War I. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 died on 28 November 1921, and he is currently buried within one of the rooms at the Shrine of the B\u00e1b. === Bah\u00edyyih === Bah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num in 1895 Bah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num was born in 1846 and was the eldest daughter of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and \u00c1s\u00edyih Kh\u00e1num. She was entitled the Greatest holy Leaf. She was particularly dear to her father and is seen within the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith as one of the greatest women to have lived. She stood by and remained faithful to the Centers of the Covenant over years of infighting within Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's family that led to the expelling of many of them. She was given the position of acting head of the religion repeatedly when \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 (during periods between 1910 and 1913), and Shoghi Effendi (during periods between 1922 and 1924), were absent from the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre in Haifa. Shoghi Effendi in particular felt her support during a difficult period following the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. She died on 15 July 1932 and was buried in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed gardens downhill from the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Arc on Mount Carmel, under the Monument of the Greatest Holy Leaf raised for her at the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre. === M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed === M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed in 1868 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed was born in Tehran in 1848 and was entitled the Purest Branch. He died at the age of 22 on 23 June 1870 in \u02bbAkk\u00e1 after a fall through a skylight while he was preoccupied in prayer. The death is significant as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds believe that Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h offered him the chance of being cured. However, he chose to use his life as a sacrifice so that the close imprisonment of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds would end. M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed was eventually buried alongside his mother in the gardens below the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Arc on Mount Carmel in Haifa near his brother and sister. === Others === \u00c1s\u00edyih bore at least four other children all sons, but due to their early deaths little is known about them: *K\u00e1zim who died sometime in Persia. *S\u00e1diq who died aged 3\u20134. *\u02bbAl\u00ed Muhammad who died in Mazandaran at the age of 7 in 1852. *\u02bbAl\u00ed Muhammad who was born and died in Baghdad at the age of 2. == Fatimih == Fatimih was born in 1828 in Mazandaran and was generally known as Mahd-i-'Ulya. A first cousin of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, Fatimih was married at fourteen to an influential cleric several decades older than she was. She seems to have been widowed shortly afterwards, perhaps aged sixteen. It is reported that Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's aunt implored him to wed his widowed cousin and he reluctantly agreed to do so. They married in 1849 in Tehran and she had six of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's children, of whom four survived to adulthood. She was said to have been very jealous of and harboured great enmity towards \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. She died in 1904, and was later labelled a Covenant-breaker. Her children are: === Samadiyyih === Samadiyyih married Majdu'd-Din, who was the son of Aqay-i-Kalim, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's brother; Majdu'd-Din was one of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's greatest critics, and Samadiyyih and Majdu'd-Din were eventually declared Covenant-breakers. She died at age 49 in 1904/5 and her husband died at over one-hundred years of age in 1955. === Muhammad-\u02bbAl\u00ed === M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed was born in Baghdad in 1853. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h called him the \"Greater Branch\" and when Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h declared \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 his successor, he set that Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed was next in rank after him. Motivated by jealousy of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 he conspired to undermine his brother's leadership, but he was unable to gain extensive support from the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds. When \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 died, his will went into great detail about how Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed had been unfaithful to the Covenant, labelling him a Covenant-breaker, and appointing Shoghi Effendi his successor instead. Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed was described by Shoghi Effendi as the \"Arch-Breaker of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's Covenant\". Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed died in 1937. === \u1e0c\u00edy\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h === \u1e0c\u00edy\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h \u1e0c\u00edy\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h (alternate spelling: Z\u00edy\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h) was born August 15, 1864 in Edirne (modern day Adrianople). He swayed between the two sides in his brothers' argument, and died before taking part in an act against \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, but has still been labelled a Covenant-breaker. He died on October 30, 1898. He married Thurayy\u00e1 Samandar\u00ed, daughter of Shaykh K\u00e1zim-i- Samandar. The marriage was childless, and according to Samandar's memoirs, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed had prevented her from returning to him. After his death in 1898, \u1e0c\u00edy\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h was initially buried next to his father at the Shrine of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h at the Mansion of Bahj\u00ed. However, having been declared a Covenant- breaker, \u1e0c\u00edy\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's remains were disinterred in a \"process\" of \"purification\" through \"cleansing\" the \"inner sanctuary\" of the \"most hallowed shrine,\" the \"Qiblih\" of the \"Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World\" at the request of relatives opposed to the Covenant-breaker faction of the family. === Mirza Badi\u02bbu'llah Effend\u00ed === Mirza Badi\u02bbu'llah Effend\u00ed was born in Adrianople in 1867. For much of his life he supported his brother's challenge to \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's authority as Centre of the Covenant. However, in 1903 Badi\u02bbu'llah rejected Muhammad- \u02bbAl\u00ed, and delivered his loyalty to \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and circulated an open letter denouncing Muhammad-\u02bbAl\u00ed, known as Badi\u02bbu'll\u00e1h's epistle; however his loyalty to \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was short lived. He died in Israel on November 1, 1950. === Others === Mahd-i-'Ulya bore at least two other children: *\u02bbAl\u00ed Muhammad who died at the age of 2 in Baghdad. *S\u00e1d\u035fhij\u00edyyih K\u035fh\u00e1num who was born in Baghdad and died at the age of 2 in Constantinople. == Gawhar == Gawhar was born in Kashan to a B\u00e1b\u00ed family of the city. She was brought to Baghdad by her brother Mirza Mihdiy-i-Kashani with his intention reportedly being for her to serve the household and \u00c1s\u00edyih Kh\u00e1num. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h married her some time around 1862. When Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h left Baghdad in 1863, unlike the other two wives, Gawhar remained in Baghdad. During her time in Baghdad she stayed and lived with her brother. Shortly afterwards, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community of Baghdad was rounded up and exiled to Mosul, and Gawhar with her brother were some of the exiles. Her brother wrote a number of times asking Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h to allow them to enter Akk\u00e1 and finally he accepted. Brother and sister arrived in late 1870. Gawhar may have been a maid of the first wife of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h when he married her. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and Gawhar had one daughter, Fur\u00fagh\u00edyyih who was born in \u02bbAkk\u00e1. Both mother and daughter were declared Covenant-breakers after the death of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. Gawhar died sometime between 1892 and 1921. === Furughiyyih === Relatively little is known about Furughiyyih. Furughiyyih was the daughter of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and she was married to Siyyid Ali Afnan, the son of the B\u00e1b's brother-in-law. She, her husband and her children (in particular her eldest Nayyir), all sided with Muhammad-\u02bbAli, and were labelled Covenant- breakers. She bore four children: * Late Hussain Effendi Afnan * Nayyar Effendi Afnan * Feyzi Effendi Afnan * Hassan Effendi Afnan She died of cancer. == Plurality of wives == Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h had three concurrent wives, when his religion teaches monogamy, and this has been the subject of criticism. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings on gender equality and monogamy post-date Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's marriages and are understood to be evolutionary in nature, slowly leading Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds away from what had been a deeply rooted cultural practice. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h married his first wife in Tehran when they both were Muslims, and he married his second wife also in Tehran, when he, his first wife, and his new wife were all B\u00e1b\u00eds and no longer Muslims. According to the laws and tradition of Islam, which Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h would have been following at the time of his marriages, a man is allowed four wives. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed marriage laws were written in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas more than ten years after his last marriage. In that book he limits the number of wives to two with no concubines and states that having only one wife would be the cause of tranquility for both partners. This was later interpreted by \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 that having a second wife is conditional upon treating both wives with justice and equality, and was not possible in practice, thus establishing monogamy. This interpretation is probably influenced by the equivalent reasoning of some Muslim scholars who interpret the Quran's permissive stance on polygamy - restricted to 4 wives - as indicated in verse 4:3 to be subject of the impossible condition of absolute justice on part of the husband. === Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed apologia === The general view among Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's family and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds today is that all the wives were legal and equal. The question about how this conforms to religious law is addressed directly in two letters from Universal House of Justice quoting Shoghi Effendi twice: :\"Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h had no concubine. He had three legal wives. As He married them before the \"Aqdas\" (His book of laws) was revealed, he was only acting according to the laws of Isl\u00e1m, which had not yet been superseded. He made plurality of wives conditional upon justice; \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 interpreted this to mean that a man may not have more than one wife at a time, as it is impossible to be just to two or more women in marriage.\" :\"...Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h married the first and second wives while he was still in Tihr\u00e1n, and the third wife while he was in Baghd\u00e1d. At that time, the Laws of the \"Aqdas\" had not been revealed, and secondly, he was following the Laws of the previous Dispensation and the customs of the people of his own land.\".Letter from Universal House of Justice: 1998, April 06, Memorandum re Wives of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds argue that polygamy is an ancient practice and other religions did not require monogamy.Universal House of Justice, (1996), p. 449, and Letters from Universal House of Justice, October 23, 1995, June 27, 1996, and April 06, 1998. Under the Law of Moses a man could take as many wives as he chose. Most Christian groups have historically not practiced and condemned polygamy; some, however, have advocated it. In the Arabian peninsula Muhammad introduced a limit of four wives; polygamy was unlimited in pre- Islamic Arabia. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith slowly introduced monogamy to a region that considered polygamy a righteous lifestyle. Note 89 of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas comments on the verse in question: :\"Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, who was revealing his teachings in the milieu of a Muslim society, introduced the question of monogamy gradually in accordance with the principles of wisdom and the progressive unfoldment of his purpose. The fact that he left his followers with an infallible interpreter of his writings enabled him to outwardly permit two wives in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas but uphold a condition that enabled \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 to elucidate later that the intention of the law was to enforce monogamy.\"Synopsis and Codification... of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, note 89 ==Notes== == References == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Further reading== * *Momen, Moojan Cyprus Exiles, The: in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Studies Bulletin, 5:3-6:1, pp. 84\u2013113. 1991-06. * * * * * * Universal House of Justice (27-06-1996).
