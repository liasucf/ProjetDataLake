    "text": "The Bachelorette is an American dating reality television series created for ABC by Mike Fleiss. It is hosted by Chris Harrison and is a spin-off of The Bachelor. The series is produced by Next Entertainment and Warner Horizon Television, and revolves around a single bachelorette who starts with a pool of romantic interests from whom she is expected to select a husband. During the course of the season, the bachelorette eliminates candidates, culminating in a marriage proposal from her final selection. The participants travel to romantic and exotic locations for their adventures, and the conflicts in the series, both internal and external, stem from the elimination-style format of the show. On August 5, 2019, ABC renewed the series for a sixteenth season, which premiered on October 13, 2020. {|id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\" summary=\"Contents\" |- | __NOTOC__ |} ==Series overview== ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (2003)=== ===Season 2 (2004)=== ===Season 3 (2005)=== ===Season 4 (2008)=== ===Season 5 (2009)=== ===Season 6 (2010)=== ===Season 7 (2011)=== ===Season 8 (2012)=== ===Season 9 (2013)=== ===Season 10 (2014)=== ===Season 11 (2015)=== ===Season 12 (2016)=== ===Season 13 (2017)=== ===Season 14 (2018)=== ===Season 15 (2019)=== ===Season 16 (2020)=== ==Specials== ==Notes and references== ==External links== * * Episodes Category:Lists of American reality television series episodes ",
