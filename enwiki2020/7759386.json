    "text": "\"When Will I See You Again\" is a song released in 1974 by American soul group The Three Degrees, from their third album The Three Degrees. The song was written and produced by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The strings were arranged by Belford \"Sinky\" Hendricks, who also arranged songs for many top-flight groups and recording artists. Sheila Ferguson sang the lead, accompanied by Fayette Pinkney and Valerie Holiday. Billboard named the song #67 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. ==Background== Sheila Ferguson recalled that \"the song was played to me by Kenny Gamble at the piano in 1973 and I threw a tantrum. I screamed and yelled and said I would never sing it. I thought it was ridiculously insulting to be given such a simple song and that it took no talent to sing it. We did do it and several million copies later, I realized that he knew more than me.\"1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh She would later have a #60 hit with a solo remake of the track in 1994. The song is unique in that every sentence is a question, heightening the overall effect and emotion. In the film Kill Bill: Volume 2, Bill cites this song as his \"favorite soul song of the 70s\". The Three Degrees performed the song at Prince Charles' 30th birthday party at Buckingham Palace in 1978. == Chart performance == It was one of the most successful recordings of the \"Philly Soul\" era. In the U.S., \"When Will I See You Again\" peaked at #2 on the pop singles chart, \"Kung Fu Fighting\" by Carl Douglas kept it from the #1 spot.https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1974-12-14 On other US charts, the song reached #1 on the adult contemporary chart, and #4 on the R&B; chart in the autumn of 1974.
