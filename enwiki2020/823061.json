    "text": "704 Hauser is an American sitcom television series and a spin-off of All in the Family (the final of several) that aired on CBS from April 11 to May 9, 1994. The series is built around the concept of a black family, the Cumberbatch Family, moving into the former Queens home of Archie Bunker years after Bunker had sold the house located at 704 Hauser Street. The All in the Family character Joey Stivic, Archie's grandson (played by Casey Siemaszko), makes a cameo in the first episode. ==Overview== Norman Lear created the series during the time when conservative talk radio was experiencing its initial upswing in popularity in the United States, particularly in the form of Rush Limbaugh. Lear felt that the time was right for a new show to explore some of the issues being discussed, and 704 Hauser was even more explicitly political than All in the Family. John Amos, a veteran of the earlier Lear sitcom Good Times (itself a spin-off of the All in the Family spin-off Maude), starred as Ernie Cumberbatch, while Lynnie Godfrey played his wife, Rose. T.E. Russell played their live-at-home son, Thurgood Marshall \"Goodie\" Cumberbatch. The show features a reversal of the original All in the Family formula. Ernie and Rose Cumberbatch are working class Democrats, while their son Goodie is a conservative activist and his girlfriend, Cherlyn Markowitz (Maura Tierney), is white and Jewish. The show attracted middling ratings, and was canceled after five episodes (with one episode remaining unaired). ==Episodes== ==Home media== The pilot episode, \"Meet the Cumberbatchs\", was included as a bonus feature on the All in the Family: The Complete Series DVD box set released by Shout! Factory on October 30, 2012. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:All in the Family Category:1994 American television series debuts Category:1994 American television series endings Category:1990s American black sitcoms Category:American television spin-offs Category:CBS original programming Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment Category:English- language television shows Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Television series created by Norman Lear Category:Queens, New York, in fiction ",
