After Chemerinsky signed a contract on September 4, 2007, Drake rescinded the offer because he felt the law professor's commentaries were \"polarizing\"; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence. The action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of academic freedom. Few believed Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence. The issue was the subject of an editorial in The New York Times on September 14, 2007. Details emerged revealing that UCI had received criticism on the hire from the California Supreme Court's then- Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals, as well as a group of prominent local Republicans who wanted to stop the appointment, including Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. Drake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in Durham, North Carolina, where Chemerinsky was a professor at the Duke University School of Law at the time, and the two reached an agreement. On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school. On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the Regents of the University of California. In 2014, Chemerinsky said that he and Drake had since reconciled. ===Waters firing=== Drake fired Ohio State marching band director Jon Waters on July 24, 2014, after a university investigation found that the band's \"sexualized culture\" was \"inconsistent with the University's values and Title IX requirements\". The university stated that there were \"serious cultural issues and an environment conducive to sexual harassment within the Marching Band\", and that the band director \"was aware or reasonably should have known about\" it. Waters sued for reinstatement, accusing the university, Drake, and a provost of discriminating against him by disciplining him differently than a female employee and denying him due process. Drake has stood by his decision to terminate Waters as marching band director. As of January 2015, the university had spent nearly $1 million in defense of the decision and subsequent actions. ==References== ==External links== * \"UCI\u2019s First Family\" Orange County Business Journal Category:African-American academics Category:American medical researchers Category:American ophthalmologists Category:Presidents of Ohio State University Category:Chancellors of the University of California, Irvine Category:People from Englewood, New Jersey Category:Physicians from New York City Category:People from Sacramento, California Category:Stanford University alumni Category:University of California, San Francisco alumni Category:University of California, San Francisco faculty Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:African-American physicians Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Members of the National Academy of Medicine Category:National Collegiate Athletic Association people Category:Scientists from New York (state) Category:Presidents of the University of California System ",
