    "text": "MgCu2 is a binary intermetallic compound of magnesium (Mg) and copper (Cu) adopting cubic crystal structure, more specifically the C15 Laves phase. The space group of MgCu2 is Fdm with lattice parameter a = 7.04 \u00c5. ==Preparation== MgCu2 can be prepared by hydrogenation of Mg2Cu or the reaction of magnesium hydride and metallic copper at elevated temperature and pressure: : 2 Mg2Cu + 3 H2 \u2192 3 MgH2 \\+ MgCu2 : MgH2 \\+ 2 Cu \u2192 MgCu2 \\+ H2 MgCu2 can also be prepared by reacting of stoichiometric amounts of metals at about 380 \u00b0C in the presence of excess copper. ==Properties== MgCu2 can react with boron or its oxide to form magnesium borides. It can also react with magnesium hydride to produce orthorhombic Mg2Cu, liberating hydrogen. ==References== ==See also== * Laves phase Category:Magnesium compounds Category:Copper compounds Category:Intermetallics ",
