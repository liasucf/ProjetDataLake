Chambless is east of the Bullion Mountains and Ludlow and ten miles east of Amboy Crater and Amboy, California. The ZIP Code is 92319, and the community is inside area code 760. It is 3 miles north of the railroad town of Cadiz. ==History== Chambless, originally known as Chambless Station, is one of the \"alphabet towns\" located along U.S. Route 66 that provided water towers to service the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. It became a popular motorist and tourist stop for Route 66 travelers but has essentially disappeared since the opening of I-40 in 1973. In 2005, the population of Chambless was 6 residents and one dog, as posted on a sign entering the town. There is a Historical Landmark Marker just east of the town that explains the history of the alphabet towns. Also located in Chambless was the 'Roadrunner Cafe' with its large and tall sign, which finally closed its doors sometime in the 1970s. == References == Category:Former settlements in San Bernardino County, California Category:Ghost towns in California Category:Ghost towns on U.S. Route 66 Category:Populated places in the Mojave Desert ",
