According to a legend, in the end of the 14th century in the place where the modern town now stands Timur fought the Golden Horde Khan Tokhtamysh and slaughtered the nomadic South Ural Bashkirs who were Tokhtamysh's supporters. Another theory postulates that the town is named for the nearby lakes: Bolshiye Uchaly and Malye Uchaly. Several theories exist about the origins of the lakes' names as well. Bashkir geologists believe that the name of the lakes comes from the word yushaly, which, in turn, is derived from yusha\u2014a generic Bashkir name for the color range of the sand and clay deposits, which in the past were used to manufacture paint. Another possibility is that the word yushaly derives from the word yusha, meaning \"jasper\", the deposits of which are common in the Urals. Finally, another version states that the name of the lakes derives from the Tatar word achuly, meaning \"angry\". ==History== The Malye Uchaly-II was discovered in near the city.
