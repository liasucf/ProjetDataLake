The San Pedro Cutud Lenten Rites is a Holy Week re-enactment of Christ's Passion and Death which takes place in Barangay San Pedro Cutud, City of San Fernando, Pampanga in the Philippines. It includes a passion play culminating with the actual nailing of at least three penitents to a wooden cross atop the makeshift Calvary. == Events == Every year on Good Friday or the Friday before Easter a dozen or so penitents - mostly men but with the occasional woman - are taken to a rice field in the barrio of San Pedro Cutud, 3 km (2 miles) from the proper of City of San Fernando, Pampanga and nailed to a cross using two-inch (5 cm) stainless steel nails that have been soaked in alcohol to disinfect them. The penitents are taken down when they feel cleansed of their sin. Other penitents flagellate themselves using bamboo sticks tied to a rope. ==UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage== The \"Cutud Lenten Rites\" has been registered in the Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of the Philippines called 'Pinagmulan.' The move was initiated by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the main cultural agency of the Republic of the Philippines. The rites may be nominated for inclusion in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, where 3 other Philippine intangible heritages have already been inscribed.http://www.ichcap.org/eng/ek/sub3/sub2.php#self ==See also== *San Pedro Cutud *Giant Lantern Festival *City of San Fernando, Pampanga == External links == *Good Friday in San Fernando, Pampanga *Center for Kapampangan Studies - Mal a Aldo documentary *Photo gallery *2015 Photo gallery *Flagellations in Pampanga *Travelguide.com *Travelog Philippines - 2009 Crucifixions in San Fernando, Pampanga ==References== Category:Catholic Church in the Philippines Category:Religion in Pampanga Category:San Fernando, Pampanga Category:Festivals in the Philippines ",
