    "text": "Who's Cookin' Who? is the 17th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on June 24, 1946, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. ==Notes== *Who's Cookin' Who? is a remake of Pantry Panic. It would be remade once more as The Redwood Sap. While in Pantry Panic, birds take the route south to escape the rigors of winter and Woody is hampered by the weather, he is punished for his irresponsibility and his lack of concern for reserve supplies in both Who's Cookin' Who? and The Redwood Sap. In Pantry Panic, Woody wanted to eat was represented by a cat, while in Who's Cookin' Who?, Woody's opponent is a wolf; in The Redwood Sap, Woody had no rivals. * Beginning with Who's Cookin' Who?, the \"OO's\" in \"Woody Woodpecker's\" name (in the opening log sequence) have been changed to nut screws; also, the color in Woody's neck changes from blue to red, matching his plummage. * Wolfie Wolf who appears in this film would later appear in Fair Weather Fiends (released later that year) and Red Riding Hoodlum. In Red Riding Hoodlum, Wolfie has blonde hair instead of red. == References == Category:1946 animated films Category:Walter Lantz Productions shorts Category:Woody Woodpecker films Category:1940s American animated films Category:American films Category:Universal Pictures short films Category:Universal Pictures animated short films Category:Animated films about birds Category:Animated films about animals Category:1946 films Category:American animated short films Category:Animated films about wolves ",
