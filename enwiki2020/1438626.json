Heng Fa Chuen is administratively part of the Eastern District. ==History== The area which is now known as Heng Fa Chuen was reclaimed from Pak Sha Wan () and Lei Yue Mun Bay (). In fact, the place where the current Promenade along the shoreline is was once a beach. There was nothing in addition except for barren hills and numerous vegetation. Further to the West, near the current Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence, there was once a quarry. However, after consuming all of the quarry's resources, the miners dispersed, with some moving to Chai Wan and settling in wooden houses. The rest of the quarry was abolished by the Hong Kong Government, and there were still traces of it left before the establishment of the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defense.

Not only was the name of the station changed, but also it was relocated to its present place (The old location is currently situated near the Chai Wan pier/Ming Pao Industrial Centre). Reclamation of the 15-hectare site began in 1978. To increase the development potential, the airport height limit on the site was raised from 30.48 metres above principal datum to 60 metres on 7 September 1984. The main architect of the development was Simon Kwan and Associates, while the main contractor was Carson Construction. Heng Fa Chuen was jointly developed by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the Heng Fa Chuen Development Company Limited. The latter was a consortium comprising Kerry Trading, Kiu Kwong Investment Corporation (associated with the Bank of China), and Riverkent Limited. All of the residential blocks are managed by MTR Property Management. The first 448 flats went on sale and were all sold on the evening of 25 July 1985. By 1986, the first 17 blocks of Heng Fa Chuen (all directly above the railway depot) were being completed and handed over to the owners. The remaining 31 blocks, which sit at grade closer to Victoria Harbour, were completed a few years later. ==Features== Heng Fa Chuen Residential Podium Paradise Mall Shopping Arcade before the 2018 renovation, with the theme of European Renaissance shown in the fountain and surrounding decorations.
