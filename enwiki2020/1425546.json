It provides law enforcement and police duties to Fort Bragg, and for the XVIII Airborne Corps when deployed. As a brigade with organic airborne units, it is authorized a beret flash and parachute wing trimming, and the shoulder sleeve insignia was authorized to be worn with an airborne tab. According to U.S. Army's Institute of Heraldry, the shoulder sleeve insignia \"was amended to delete the airborne tab effective 16 October 2008\" when jump status of the brigade was terminated; however, various elements of the brigade remain on jump status. ==Insignia== Shoulder Insignia Description *On a dark green oblong arched at top and base a light green globe with dark green gridlines bearing a five pointed yellow star. Symbolism *Green and yellow are the colors used for Military Police, and a star is emblematic of that branch of service. A star also connotes leadership and authority. The arrowhead is a symbol for military preparedness and protection. All of the above, along with the globe, symbolize the overall mission capabilities, and operational sphere of the organization. Distinctive Unit Insignia Description *A gold insignia consisting of a diagonal band divided throughout by a radiant partition line gold and scarlet, all within a green annulet, the upper part inscribed with the motto 'Combat Support' in gold letters and the lower part surmounted by two gold sprigs of oak leaves; overall an upright white sword.
