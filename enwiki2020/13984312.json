    "text": "Samuel Ralph Townshend Mayer (1841\u20131880) was a British writer who was the founder of the Free and Open Church Association. Mayer was one of the first important religious figures in the United Kingdom to openly call for tolerance of homosexuality. ==Biography== Mayer was born at Gloucester in August 1841, the second son of Samuel Mayer, a solicitor. As he grew up, Samuel Mayer the son became a contributor to newspapers in Gloucester and to many serial publications. He later moved to London. In 1868, he married Gertrude Dalby, who became a published author also. In 1866, Mayer founded the Free and Open Church Association and served as its secretary until February 1872. Mayer was the editor of the first report of the Metropolitan Conservative Working Men's Association in 1868. In 1870, Mayer and J. B. Payne established the Junior Conservative Club. Mayer edited the \u2018'Churchman's Shilling Magazine, the \u2018'Illustrated Review\u2019' from January to June 1871, the \u2018'Free and Open Church Advocate, 3 vols. 1872 to 1877, and was the proprietor and editor of the \u2018'St. James's Magazine\u2019' in 1875. In 1878, Mayer published The Origin and Growth of Sunday Schools in England. In 1880, Mayer published Who was the Founder of Sunday Schools? Being an Inquiry. In this work, he attempted to prove that Thomas Stock deserved as much credit as Robert Raikes for the founding of Sunday schools in the United Kingdom. Mayer was instrumental, with Robert Browning and John Watson Dalby, in dedicating an abbey niche to the poet Leigh Hunt, with a bust over Hunt's grave. Mayer also organized Hunt's memorial service. Mayer died at Richmond, Surrey, on 28 May 1880. ==Other publications== *\u2018Amy Fairfax,\u2019 a novelette, 1859 *\"Fractional Supplement to Hotson's Ready Reckoner\" 1861. ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== * Category:1841 births Category:1880 deaths Category:People from Gloucester Category:English writers ",
