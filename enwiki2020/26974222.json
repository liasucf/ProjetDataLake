    "text": "Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, is viewed by the movement's adherents as a prophet in the tradition of the ancient prophets recorded in the Bible. During his life, Smith made several prophecies, many documented in the Doctrine and Covenants, a book of scripture in several of the movement's denominations. There is much dispute surrounding the known and alleged prophecies of Smith. Some critics contend that Smith could not be a genuine prophet because they claim that some of his prophecies did not come true. Latter Day Saint adherents have responded to these claims by putting forth the following six arguments: #some prophecies that critics claim have failed have actually been fulfilled; #some of Smith's statements have been mischaracterized as \"prophecies\"; #some prophetic statements ascribed to Smith have not been verified as legitimate by either Latter Day Saint or non\u2013Latter Day Saint historians; #some prophecies should be interpreted metaphorically, not literally; #some legitimate prophecies were conditional and did not happen because the conditions precedent to those prophesies were not satisfied; and #some legitimate prophecies remain unfulfilled but are expected to be fulfilled in the future. ==Table of prophecies organized by date== ===Prophecies from 1823 to 1830=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%\" border=\"2\" !width=40%|Prophecy !width=10%|Source !width=10%|Date !width=39%|Notes |- | Smith spoken of for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues: Smith wrote that in 1823, an angel visited him and made prophetic statements regarding Smith's future. \"He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.\" Smith recorded the incident in 1838. || Joseph Smith\u2013History 1:33; History of the Church 1:11\u201312 || September 21, 1823 (reported in 1838) || Latter Day Saints state that this prophecy has been fulfilled. As evidence, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has cited discussions of Smith by American, German and Finnish scholars, as well as the LDS Church's extensive missionary program, which leads many people around the world to speak of Smith for both good and ill. |- | Three witnesses to testify of the Book of Mormon: At the request of Martin Harris, who desired to witness the golden plates containing the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith received the revelation that \"the testimony of three witnesses would be sent forth of God's word.\" By the time the revelation was given, neither Oliver Cowdery nor David Whitmer (the two remaining witnesses and later supporters) had met Smith. || || March 1829 || Latter Day Saints claim that this prophecy was fulfilled. |- | Jesus comes to the temple: \"I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God; wherefore, gird up your loins and I will suddenly come to my temple. Even so. Amen.\" || || December 9, 1830 || Latter Day Saints claim that this prophecy was fulfilled during Smith's lifetime. Smith stated that Jesus Christ appeared to him and Oliver Cowdery on April 3, 1836, in the Kirtland Temple.Doctrine and Covenants 110:1\u201310. |- | Copyright sale: Hiram Page and Oliver Cowdery were to find a buyer for copyright of the Book of Mormon in Canada. | B. H. Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church, 1:165 (1930) | Winter 1829\u201330 | Latter Day Saints claim that the conditions precedent for the fulfilment of this prophecy were not satisfied.Marlin K. Jensen, \"The Joseph Smith Papers: The Manuscript Revelation Books\", Liahona, July 2009. Page argued in an 1848 letter that the revelation was therefore fulfilled.Letter to William E. McLellin, February 2, 1848, as cited in Dan Vogel, Early Mormon Documents 5:257\u201359. |- || Gather in one place: The Latter Day Saints shall be gathered in one place \"against the day when tribulation and desolation are sent forth upon the wicked\" | || September 1830 || Latter Day Saints claim that this prophecy was fulfilled. Adherents recognize several meanings for \"gathering\", stemming from their concepts of Zion. Indeed, general authorities have stated that the concept of gathering to Zion refers to the stakes of Zion wherever they are located, and not to a single geographic and physical location.Harold B. Lee, \"Strengthen the Stakes of Zion\", Ensign, July 1973.Bruce R. McConkie, \"Building Zion\", Liahona, September 1977.Bruce R. McConkie, \"Come: Let Israel Build Zion\", Ensign, May 1977. |- || Hour is nigh: The \"hour is nigh and day soon at hand\" when Jesus will return. | || September 1830 || Latter Day Saints claim this prophecy has yet to be fulfilled. Adherents believe that Jesus has not yet returned in his Second Coming, and Latter Day Saints advocate that the words \"hour\" and \"day\" are metaphorical and represent centuries or millennia, i.e., in a similar manner as is generally used in the same context in some instances in the Bible.FAIR Mormon, Joseph Smith: Alleged false prophecies. |} ===Prophecies from 1831 to 1832=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%\" border=\"2\" !width=40%|Prophecy !width=10%|Source !width=10%|Date !width=39%|Notes |- || Land purchase: The Latter Day Saints were to gather riches and purchase a place of refuge and safety, where the wicked would not come, and the wicked would refuse to battle the Saints. | || March 7, 1831 || Latter Day Saints claim that this prophecy was fulfilled. Richard Abanes claims this was not fulfilled.Abanes, p 462. Members of the LDS Church claim that the \"place of refuge and safety\" that was purchased is in the Salt Lake Valley, and that many, including the U.S. government, refused to battle with the Mormons shortly after their relocation to Utah. |- || Zion in Missouri: Missouri is named as the place for the \"City of Zion\"; the land will be purchased for \"an everlasting inheritance\". | || July 20, 1831 || In the Doctrine and Covenants, the project was postponed. Hence, Latter Day Saints claim that a subsequent prophecy of Smith's replaced a prior prophecy. In any case, many adherents generally believe that a temple will eventually be constructed on the site prepared, based on additional statements by Smith. The Community of Christ has constructed a temple on the Greater Temple Lot. The Church of Christ (Temple Lot) and the LDS Church still own land on the Greater Temple Lot. |- || Strong hold in Kirtland for the space of five years: Elder Frederick G. Williams should not sell his farm because \"[The Lord wills] to retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years\". | || September, 1831 || Latter Day Saints claim that this prophecy was fulfilled. A majority of Latter Day Saints fled from Kirtland to Far West, Missouri between 1837 and 1838 to escape mob violence. |- || Zion in this generation: Zion and its temple will be built at Independence, Missouri, \"in this generation\". | || September 22 or 23, 1832 || The precise site dedicated by Smith for the construction of the temple at Independence is the Temple Lot; it is currently vacant and owned by the Church of Christ (Temple Lot). Members of the LDS Church believe that a temple will be built at this location in the future. One oft repeated explanation of the supposed non-fulfillment of this prophecy is that the phrase \"in this generation\" is used figuratively to designate those of this \"gospel dispensation\" (those who have received or will receive divine revelation during the \"dispensation\" of revelation and inspiration from God (or \"heaven\") since the time that Joseph Smith began receiving such revelation, and afterwards, (as it is used in a similar fashion in some instances in the Bible). Another plausible explanation that this prophecy was fulfilled can be taken at face value from this revelation (D&C; 84), in that it was received in Kirtland, Ohio. And though verse 3 indicates that the place of the temple (in Independence, MO) was indicated \"by the finger of the Lord\" (previously), the phrase in verse 4 \"beginning at this place\" is rather a transition of reference to Kirtland, Ohio, where Joseph Smith was at when this revelation was received by himRevelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, September 22 and 23, 1832. HC 1:286\u2013295. (Doctrine and Covenants | Section 84:Heading) And, indeed, the Kirtland Temple was built and finished and dedicated by the spring of 1836. The reference to building \"New Jerusalem\" in this context then is not one of physical edifices (though the 'temple' being reared \"in this generation\" was, but occurred in Kirtland, OH, and not in Independence, or Jackson County, MO)\u2014but, rather indicated that 'building' or developing the future inhabitants of that city (yet to be built physically) began in earnest, spiritually, by the reception of priesthood keys,spiritual keys given by Moses, \"Elias\", [all either 'translated' beings] and Elijah on April 6, 1836 in the Kirtland Temple by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery - see D&C; 110) as well as priesthood organization of quorums, and temple practices and ordinances revealed by Joseph Smith to holders of both the Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood among duly ordained male members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Kirtland who received these things were begun in the temple there, Ohio finished within four years from the year this prophecy was given. The Community of Christ has constructed the Independence Temple on the Greater Temple Lot. |- || New York destroyed: New York and Boston will be destroyed if they reject the gospel. The \"hour of their judgement is nigh\". | || September 22 or 23, 1832 || Richard Abanes contends that this prophecy was not fulfilled because both cities still exist.Abanes, p. 463. But Latter Day Saints believe that the conditions precedent for this prophecy were not fulfilled, because the gospel was accepted, not rejected, in both New York and Boston. Smith went to New York and Boston to preach and there are large groups of Latter Day Saints in both cities today. |- || Civil War: there will be a war between the northern states and the southern states beginning in South Carolina; the southern states will call upon Great Britain for assistance; that after this, war will be \"poured out on all nations\"; and that \"slaves shall rise up against their masters, who shall be marshaled and disciplined for war\". | || December 25, 1832 || Latter Day Saints believe that the American Civil War fulfilled this prophecy, in part: it was a war between the northern and the southern states, the war began in South Carolina, and the southern states did call upon the United Kingdom for military assistance.. The prediction that after this, war would \"be poured out upon all nations\" is disputed, but Latter Day Saints argue that the wars that have occurred since the American Civil War\u2014which include two world wars\u2014adequately fulfill this prophecy.Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual (Salt Lake City, Utah: Church Educational System, 2001) \u00a7 87. |} ===Prophecies from 1833 to 1834=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%\" border=\"2\" !width=40%|Prophecy !width=10%|Source !width=10%|Date !width=39%|Notes |- || Current generation: \"Not many years shall pass away\" before the wicked \"of this generation\" will be swept off the face of the earth; and \"there are those now living upon the earth whose eyes shall not be closed in death until they see all these things, which I have spoken, fulfilled\". | History of the Church 1:315 || January 4, 1833 || Critic Richard Abanes claims this was not fulfilled. Many Latter-day Saints, however, point to the atrocities of the coming \"Civil War\" in which Union troops decimated the lands and peoples occupied then by many who had driven the saints from their lands. One non-Mormon who referenced the destruction was General Alexander Doniphan, who, when he saw the burned homes in Missouri, said he recalled Smith's words when he, Smith, advised him not to purchase land in that region. \u201cThe fields and farms and houses will be destroyed, and only the chimneys will be left to mark the desolation, Smith said.\u201d Later, Donaphan observed: \u201cIn the spring of 1862 my regiment went south, and it was during that time that \u2018Order No. 11\u2019 was issued ... [when] I went down the Blue river, we found houses, barns, outbuildings, nearly all burned down, and nothing left standing but the chimneys.... I remember very well that the country looked a veritable desolation.\u201d (A. Saxey of Utah in a letter to Mr. Junius Wells, August 25, 1902). |- || Zion built here: Promise that if the Saints are obedient in building a temple, then the City of Zion will prosper and become glorious, and that Zion cannot \"be moved\" out of its place. | || August 2, 1833 || The Latter Day Saints were not able to build a temple as commanded because they were driven out of Missouri by Executive Order 44. Latter Day Saints argue that the Latter Day Saints' disobedience led to this result, thus nullifying the prophecy. |- ||Stars fall from heaven: According to Philo Dibble, while preaching in Kirtland, Ohio, Smith said, \"Forty days shall not pass and the stars shall fall from heaven.\" ||Philo Dibble Narrative| ||October 5, 1833 ||On November 13, 1833, the Leonids meteor shower occurred, and it was such a brilliant and heavy meteor shower that some people thought that the world was ending. Some critics of the Dibble narrative say that he simply invented the story after the fact. Others assume that Smith must have studied celestial events and deduced that the Leonids shower would occur again soon, as records exist of its occurrence in 902, 1630, and 1799. Smith himself records the events in his own history: \"About 4 o'clock a.m. I was awakened by Brother Davis knocking at my door, and calling on me to arise and behold the signs in the heavens. I arose, and to my great joy, beheld the stars fall from heaven like a shower of hailstones.... I was led to exclaim, 'How marvelous are Thy works, O Lord! I thank Thee for Thy mercy unto Thy servant; save me in Thy kingdom for Christ's sake. Amen.'\" |- || Enemies not destroyed: If the Saints were not successful in legal action against their enemies in Missouri, God would avenge them and all their adversaries would be destroyed. | History of Church 1:455 || December 10, 1833 || Critic Richard Abanes claims this was not fulfilled. As stated above, Latter-day Saints believe that God avenged them by bringing the terrible conflict of the Civil War upon them, in which many of their adversaries died, their livestock slaughtered and their homes decimated. |- || United Order: The United Order would be \"everlasting\", and \"immutable and unchangeable\" to benefit the church until Jesus comes. | || April 23, 1834 || Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled.Abanes, p 464 Members of the LDS Church claim that the adjectives \"everlasting ... immutable and unchageable\" may refer to the divine source of the United Order rather than a prophecy that it will always be practiced. They also argue that the United Order is part of the eternal gospel and that its practice is simply in abeyance pending other events.\"I Have a Question\", Ensign, June 1986. Members also argue that similar phraseology is used in the bible.http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Alleged_false_prophecies/United_Order_is_everlasting |- || Missouri victory: Speaking through Smith, God says regarding Missouri: \"I will fight your battles ... the destroyer I have sent forth to destroy and lay waste mine enemies; and not many years hence they shall not be left to pollute mine heritage, and to blaspheme my name upon the lands which I have consecrated for the gathering together of my saints\". | || June 22, 1834 || Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled. As stated above, the Latter-day Saints maintain that the bloody Civil War laid waste to the land under General Order 11, and saw the destruction of their enemies and their property as prophesied by Joseph Smith. |- || Zion in Missouri: The Latter Day Saints should be ready to move into Jackson County, Missouri, on September 11, 1836, \"the appointed time for the redemption of Zion\" | History of the Church 2:145 || August 16, 1834 || Richard Abanes claims that this was not fulfilled: the Latter Day Saints fled Missouri in 1839. Latter Day Saints claim that the Saints did move into Jackson County on the appointed date, thus forfeiting the conditional prophecy. |} ===Prophecies from 1835 to 1839=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%\" border=\"2\" !width=40%|Prophecy !width=10%|Source !width=10%|Date !width=39%|Notes |- ||Wind up in 56 Years \"[T]he coming of the Lord, which is nigh\u2014even fifty-six years should wind up the scene.\" | History of Church 2:182 || February 14, 1835 || Critic Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled because the Second Coming of Jesus did not happen within 56 years of the statement. Latter Day Saints claim that this was not necessarily a prophecy because it was not contained in a revelation and that Smith may have been expressing an opinion on the timing of the Second Coming. In 1843, Smith related the following: \"I was once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the Son of Man, when I heard a voice repeat the following: Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five years old, thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man; therefore let this suffice, and trouble me no more on this matter. I was left thus, without being able to decide whether this coming referred to the beginning of the millennium or to some previous appearing, or whether I should die and thus see his face. I believe the coming of the Son of Man will not be any sooner than that time.\"Doctrine and Covenants 130:14\u201317. Latter Day Saints argue that in this later instance, Smith did not claim to know the timing of the Second Coming, which should cause us to question whether his 1835 statement was a prophetic statement. |- || Wealth from Salem: Smith would receive \"wealth pertaining to gold and silver\" in Salem, Massachusetts. | || August 4, 1836 || Latter Day Saints argue that the revelation did not say that Smith would receive the wealth on his 1836 trip to Salem, but rather that it would occur \"in due time\". The LDS Church teaches that \"in Salem was a treasure of much greater value to the kingdom than that for which they had come. There were many souls in Salem whom the Lord knew would accept the gospel. ... [in the early 1840s,] Elder [Erastus] Snow baptized over one hundred people\" in the city.Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual (Salt Lake City, Utah: Church Educational System, 2001) at \u00a7 111. |- || Marsh exalted: Apostle Thomas B. Marsh would be \"exalted\" and would preach \"unto the ends of the earth ... among ... many nations\". | || July 23, 1837 || Though Marsh was excommunicated shortly thereafter,Abanes, p. 465 in 1857, he was rebaptized into the LDS Church. Marsh wrote an autobiography in 1864, documenting his significant missionary service. Latter Day Saints therefore believe that the prophecy was fulfilled as it pertains to Marsh's preaching. |- | Oliver Granger: \"And again, I say unto you, I remember my servant Oliver Granger; behold, verily I say unto him that his name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord.\" || || July 8, 1838 || One member of the LDS Church has written: \"The surest evidence that Oliver Granger is held in sacred remembrance is that his name is included in one of our four (4) most sacred books constituting the Standard Works, the Doctrine and Covenants. This, in itself, fulfills the prophecy.\"Stephen R. Gibson, \"Is Oliver Granger's Name Forgotten?\" Another Mormon apologist has argued that \"the words 'sacred remembrance' most likely refer to the fact that the Lord would remember him. After all, the verse begins with the Lord saying, 'I remember my servant Oliver Granger.'\"John A. Tvedtnes, \"The Nature of Prophets and Prophecy\", fairlds.org. |- | During this captivity [in Liberty Jail], not one of our lives shall be taken: Smith said on the morning after their capture after the 1838 Mormon War that \"the word of the Lord came to me last night that ... whatever we may suffer during this captivity, not one of our lives shall be taken\". || Dona Hill, Joseph Smith: The First Mormon (Doubleday and Company, Garden City, New York, 1977) p. 244\\. || November 1838 || Latter Day Saints assert that this prophecy was fulfilled, because neither Smith nor any of his companions were killed during their imprisonment in Liberty Jail. |- || Enemies punished: While in prison, God stated through Smith that \"cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed\", that Smith's enemies would be taken \"in their own craftiness\", and that \"not many years hence ... [they] and their posterity shall be swept from under heaven, saith God, that not one of them is left to stand by the wall\". | || March 20, 1839 || The meaning of this prophecy, its referenced target, and the extent of its fulfillment has long been controversial. Although some of the known persecutors of Smith met gruesome and ugly deaths, others died peacefully of old age.Poulsen, Richard \"Fate and the Persecutors of Joseph Smith: Transmutations of An American Myth\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 11(4) (winter 1978): 63\u201368. Critic Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled. Latter Day Saints argue that the unfortunate events which befell some of Smith's enemies is evidence that the prophecy was fulfilled. Another argument set forth by adherents is that the prophecy applied more to spiritual punishments in the afterlife rather than temporal punishments. |} ===Prophecies from 1840 to 1844=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%\" border=\"2\" !width=40%|Prophecy !width=10%|Source !width=10%|Date !width=39%|Notes |- || Orson Hyde's Dedicatory Prayer[At the Request of Joseph Smith]: On October 24, 1841, Orson Hyde dedicated the Holy Land for the return of Judah and the House of Israel generally at the request of Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith said \"In due time thou shalt go to Jerusalem, the land of thy fathers, and be a watchman unto the house of Israel; and by thy hands shall the Most High do a great work, which shall prepare the way and greatly facilitate the gathering together of that people.\" During the 1840 April church conference, Joseph Smith commissioned Elder Hyde to go to Palestine and there dedicate that land for the return of the Jewish people. Jews \"Have been scattered abroad among the Gentiles for a long period; and in our estimation, the time of the commencement of their return to the Holy Land has already arrived.\" The Orson Hyde Memorial Garden is a dedicated space to this prophecy in Jerusalem. | History of the Church, 4:457 & 375\\. || April 28, 1842 || Latter Day Saints believe the return of the Jews to their ancestral home was brought about by the exercising of priesthood keys conferred upon the saints by Moses in the Kirtland Temple at the same time Elijah returned and conferred his keys of binding the hearts of the children to their fathers and vice versa. Within a few decades, Theodor Hertzl began the Zionist movement, and Latter Day Saints contend that the establishment and continued survival of the nation of Israel to be fulfillment of Hyde's prophetic calling. Orson Hyde's Dedicatory Prayer |- || Relief Society: \"I now prophecy that before ten years shall roll around, the queens of the earth shall come and pay their respects to this society\" [spoken at a Relief Society meeting]. | D. Michael Quinn, The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power, p. 634 || April 28, 1842 || Critic Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled.Abanes, p. 466. Latter Day Saints claim that the conditions precedent for the fulfillment of this prophecy were not satisfied. All Relief Society meetings were suspended in 1844 and the organization went on hiatus until it was reorganized in 1867 by Brigham Young. |- | Saints to settle in Rocky Mountains: \"I prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease, and some of you will live to go and assist in making settlements and build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.\" || History of the Church 5:85 || August 1842 || Members of the LDS Church contend that this prophecy was fulfilled. Not long after Smith's death, the majority of Latter Day Saints followed Brigham Young in relocating to the Salt Lake Valley, where they established Salt Lake City and other settlements in Utah. Critics Jerald and Sandra Tanner claim that this alleged prophesy was inserted into Smith's History after his death and that it was written in handwriting that does not match Smith's.Jerald and Sandra Tanner, The Changing World of Mormonism, p. 404Jerald and Sandra Tanner, Mormonism: Shadow or Reality?, pp. 134\u201335. |- | Smith will not return to Missouri : When Smith was captured by Missouri agents in Illinois, he stated that he would not set foot in Missouri again either dead or alive. || History of the Church 5:216 || 1842 || Latter Day Saints believe that this prophecy was fulfilled. Smith did not return to Missouri even though he was captured by Missouri agents in Illinois. He never entered Missouri again and was killed and buried in Illinois. |- || Rising Generation: \"There are those of the rising generation who shall not taste death till Christ comes.\" | History of the Church 5:336 || April 6, 1843 ||Critic Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled. Latter Day Saints claim that the term \"rising generation\" is vague and could mean future generations and not just apply to those generations that existed in Smith's time. |- || White Horse Prophecy : A lengthy discourse in which Smith reportedly said, \"You will see the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed. It will hang like a thread as fine as a silk fiber ... and it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse\"; and that the temple in Jackson County, Missouri, \"will be built in this generation.\" | Journal of John J. Roberts, March 2, 1902 || May 6, 1843 || The LDS Church does not accept the White Horse Prophecy as authentic.\"Church Statement on 'White Horse Prophecy' and Political Neutrality\", Public Affairs Department, LDS Church, January 6, 2010. Retrieved August 25, 2011. Although other authenticated statements by Smith appear to echo the claim that the United States Constitution would be threatened and that faithful Latter Day Saints would save it, the authenticity of the White Horse Prophecy is debated and has never been resolved among historians. |- || Government Overthrown: \"I prophesy in the name of the Lord God of Israel, unless the United States redress the wrongs committed upon the Saints in the state of Missouri and punish the crimes committed by her officers that in a few years the government will be utterly overthrown and wasted, and there will not be so much as a potsherd left for their wickedness.\" | History of the Church 5:394 || May 18, 1843 || Critic Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled; however, in 1861, the secession of Missouri was in dispute. During the war, Missouri was claimed by both the Union and the Confederacy, and had two competing state governments, sending representatives to both the United States Congress and the Confederate Congress. Missouri was hotly contested during the war and her Confederate government was utterly overthrown and wasted when the state was laid waste by Union troops. Many people who had driven the saints from their homes were themselves ousted and their property burned, their livestock slaughtered or confiscated under General Order 11. Other Latter Day Saints argue that Smith may have been referring to the rulling Whig Party, which was defeated in the presidential election of 1852, later to dissolve and disappear from the political sphere. Still other Latter Day Saints argue that formal apologies have been delivered to the Saints by government officials, including an official apology from Missouri in 1976. They argue that allowing Utah\u2014which was dominated by Latter Day Saints\u2014to obtain statehood in 1896 could be regarded as \"redress\" of the wrongs committed. |- | Stephen A. Douglas to run for president: Smith stated that Stephen A. Douglas would run for the presidency of the United States. Smith also predicted that if Douglas slandered the Latter Day Saints then he would feel the weight of the hand of the Almighty upon him. || History of the Church 5:394 || May 1843 || Latter Day Saints believe that this prophecy was fulfilled. Douglas ran for U.S. president in 1860. He did make some negative comments towards the Latter Day Saints, and he did not win the 1860 election, and later died in 1861. |- | Stakes established in Boston and New York: \"In the great cities, as Boston, New York, etc., there shall be stakes\" || History of the Church 6:319 || || Latter Day Saints believe that this prophecy has been fulfilled. Several stakes of the LDS Church have established in those cities. There are stakes of the LDS Church in many other \"great cities\" of the United States and the world. |- || Government broken up: \"While discussing the petition to Congress, I prophesied, by virtue of the holy Priesthood vested in me, and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that, if Congress will not hear our petition and grant us protection, they shall be broken up as a government, and God shall damn them. And there shall nothing be left of them\u2014not even a grease spot.\" | Millennial Star 29:455; History of the Church 6:116 || December 16, 1843 || Critic Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled.Abanes, p. 467. Latter Day Saints argue that years later Congress did grant protection to the Latter Day Saints and that adherents are now free to practice their religion in the United States. Since the conditions for the protection of the Saints were eventually met, it is argued that prophecy never came to fruition. |- | Orrin Porter Rockwell protected from enemies: \"I prophesy, in the name of the Lord, that you\u2014Orrin Porter Rockwell\u2014so long as ye shall remain loyal and true to thy faith, need fear no enemy. Cut not thy hair and no bullet or blade can harm thee.\" || || December 25, 1843 || Latter Day Saints contend this prophecy was fulfilled: Rockwell died of natural causes at an old age, having never been wounded by a bullet or a blade. However he did cut his hair in 1855, several years after Joseph's statement, to make a wig for Agnes Smith, the widow of Don Carlos Smith, Joseph's younger brother. |- || Son David: Smith prophesied that his unborn child will be named David and will be \"church president and king over Israel\". | D. Michael Quinn, The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power, p. 644 || April\u2013May 1844 || There is dispute between critics and apologists over the authenticity of this prophecy. The son David Hyrum Smith became a member of the First Presidency of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Critic Richard Abanes claims this prophecy was not fulfilled, as David did not become the president of the RLDS Church or any other Latter Day Saint church. Members of the LDS Church dispute the authenticity of the prophecy. |- | Dr. Richards will not have hole in garment: Shortly before his imprisonment in Carthage Jail, Smith told Willard Richards that the time would come that the balls would fly around him like hail, and he should see his friends fall on the right and on the left, but that there should not be a hole in his garment. || History of the Church 6:619 || July 1844 || Latter Day Saints believe that this prophecy was fulfilled. Although he was in the room where Smith and his brother Hyrum were shot and killed, Richards escaped from the incident uninjured. John Taylor, who was also present in the room, was shot a number of times but survived. |- | Joseph and Hyrum Smith to die if re-captured: Five days before his death, Smith wrote: \"I told Stephen Markham that if I and Hyrum were ever taken again we should be massacred, or I was not a prophet of God\" || History of the Church 6:546 || July 22, 1844 || Latter Day Saints believe this prophecy was fulfilled. Four days later, Smith and his brother Hyrum were imprisoned, and on the second day of their incarceration they were killed by a mob in the jail. |- | Dan Jones to serve a mission to Wales: This is commonly referred to as Smith's \"last prophecy\" and took place in Carthage Jail the night before Smith was killed. \"Soon after Dr. Richards retired to the bed ... and when all were apparently fast asleep, Joseph whispered to Dan Jones, 'are you afraid to die?' Dan said, 'Has that time come, think you? Engaged in such a cause I do not think that death would have many terrors.' Joseph replied, 'You will yet see Wales, and fulfill the mission appointed you before you die.'\" || History of the Church 6:601 || July 26 or 27, 1844 || Latter Day Saints believe this prophecy was fulfilled. Although Jones was ill and believed to be dying of an illness at the time of his conversation with Smith, Jones recovered and later went to Wales as a missionary for the LDS Church. |} ==See also== * List of non- canonical revelations in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints * Miracles of Joseph Smith * One Mighty and Strong ==Notes== ==References== * *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. * ==External links== ;Favorable *Doctrine and Covenants *\"World of Abraham\" *\"Samples Of Prophecies Of Joseph Smith That Have Been Fulfilled\" from FAIR *Fulfilled Prophecies of Joseph Smith *Joseph Smith Prophecies ;Unfavorable *The False Prophet, Joseph Smith \"And It Didn't Come to Pass...\" by Ed Decker *Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry Category:Joseph Smith Smith, Joseph Prophecies of Joseph Smith ",
