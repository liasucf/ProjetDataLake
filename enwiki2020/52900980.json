    "text": "Falamansa is a Brazilian forr\u00f3 band created in 1998 in S\u00e3o Paulo. With the success of forr\u00f3 on the nights of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, a movement emerged in the city to meet the demand of the nightclubs and the adolescent public, who identified immediately with the dance and the contagious rhythm of the style. The members: Josivaldo, Dezinho, Tato, Alem\u00e3o, and Valdir performed the songs of Luiz Gonzaga and Jackson do Pandeiro, mixing the so-called \"forr\u00f3 universit\u00e1rio\" or \"forr\u00f3 p\u00e9-de-serra\" with the roots of Northeastern music. By 2001, the group had more than 1 million copies sold in Brazil. == History == Falamansa's history begins in 1998, the last day of registration for the 3rd Mackenzie Music Festival. Tato, now the band's author and vocalist, was a forr\u00f3 DJ and already had some compositions of his own. Decided to inscribe one of them (\"Asas\") at the festival. However, he did not have a band. Four days later Falamansa, which had not existed before, was among the 20 summons of the 160 groups enrolled in the festival. Tato remembered Alem\u00e3o a DJ friend who played zabumba. German, in turn, called the neighbor, Dezinho, who played triangle. Along with them, a flautist and a bass player who were part of the band's first lineup. They rehearsed two evenings and \"Asas\" won the second place in the event. Then came the experienced Josivaldo Leite, Waldir do Acorde\u00e3o, who had already played with names like Oswaldinho do Acorde\u00e3o and Jorge de Altinho. It was then complete the formation of the band that never changed. A Brazilian publisher called Deckdisc listened to the independent CD they recorded in January 2000 and released Deixa Entrar, distributed by Abril Music. The band started playing every Tuesday at the Remelexo house in Pinheiros, S\u00e3o Paulo. They released \"Essa \u00e9 pra voc\u00ea\" in 2001. In 2003, the group released the third album of their career. Simples Mortais, as it was titled, has as its flagship the song \"100 Anos\", which won a music video. The fourth album, \"Um dia perfeito\", was released in 2004, with unpublished songs like \"Tempo de paz\" and some re-recordings such as \"Sete Meninas\" by Dominguinhos, which was already part of the band's repertoire. In 2005 the MTV CD and DVD came to stores. The material, recorded on February 19 at Via Funchal, in S\u00e3o Paulo, was attended by names such as Dominguinhos, in \"Sete Meninas\" and \"Forr\u00f3 do Bole Bole\"; Zeider, from Planta & Raiz, in \"Gostas de Amor\"; And the Meninos do Morumbi, in \"Homem de A\u00e7o\". In addition to major career successes, the compilation brings together three previously unreleased tracks, among them \"Decola\" and \"Amor e Cia\". The DVD with the record of the show brings photo gallery, making-of, interviews and a documentary about the forr\u00f3 universit\u00e1rio among the main successes are \"Xote dos milagres\" \"Xote da alegria\" and \"Rindo atoa\".
