As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, she was a princesse du sang. Forced to marry the Duke of Maine, legitimised son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, she revelled in politics and the arts, and held a popular salon at the H\u00f4tel du Maine as well as at the Ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux. ==Biography== Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte was born on 8 November 1676 at the H\u00f4tel de Cond\u00e9 in Paris. She was the eighth child born to the then Duke and Duchess of Enghien. The name B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte was added in honour of the girls' maternal aunt, Benedicta, Duchess of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. She was brought up at the H\u00f4tel de Cond\u00e9 with her many sisters and had to endure slave-like conditions under the madness of her father. Her mother, who was pious and gentle, was often beaten by her father as were their staff and her sister Marie Anne, Mademoiselle de Montmorency. When formally addressed, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte was known as Mademosielle d'Enghien. As a princess of the blood, she possessed the style of Serene Highness. When she was nine years old, her father was given the title of Count of Charolais, and as a result Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte became known as court as Mademoiselle de Charolais. This appellation would later pass to her niece Louise Anne. She was very outspoken and witty, and had a terrible temper. As she was very small and paid much attention to her appearance, she was nicknamed poup\u00e9e du Sang at the French court, literally, \"Doll of the Blood\", a play on the honorific princesse du sang, princess of the Blood. This nickname is sometimes said to have been made up by her sister-in-law the Duchess of Bourbon. Doll of the Blood She was close to her sister Marie Anne, whose marriage to the Duke of Vend\u00f4me (1654\u20131712) she later arranged. Although born with a lame arm, she was generally thought to be the most attractive of the Cond\u00e9 daughters. Despite this Madame, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans, sister-in-law of Louis XIV called her a \"little toad.\"Fraser, Antonia (Lady), Love and Louis XIV Some time after her marriage, the Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans also said that \"Madame du Maine is not taller than a child ten years old, and is not well- made. To appear tolerably well, it is necessary for her to keep her mouth shut; for when she opens it, she opens it very wide, and shows her irregular teeth. She is not very stout, uses a great quantity of paint, has fine eyes, a white skin, and fair hair. If she were well-disposed, she might pass, but her wickedness is insupportable\".The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Memoirs of the Louis XIV. and The Regency, Complete, by \u00c9lisabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans She was very short like her older sister Anne Marie, Mademoiselle de Cond\u00e9. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte and her oldest sister Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon, known as Mademoiselle de Bourbon until her marriage to le Grand Conti in 1688, were considered the most attractive of the daughters born to the Cond\u00e9s. Mademoiselle d'Enghien received the typical education given to girls of the nobility in France and was taught reading, writing, dancing, singing and other matters which were considered necessary for a young aristocrat. She spent most of her time in the company of her mother and two older sisters. ==Marriage== At first, it was proposed that she marry Louis de Bourbon, Count of Vermandois, son of Louis XIV and Louise de La Valli\u00e8re. However, the count died in exile in 1683. Louis XIV arranged several marriages into princely houses of France for his legitimised children by Louise de La Valli\u00e8re. Prior to her marriage, she saw the marriage of Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans to Mademoiselle de Blois, future duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's own brother Louis de Bourbon had even had been forced to marry Mademoiselle de Nantes, eldest legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. In 1692, the 15-year-old Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte married the 22-year-old Louis Auguste de Bourbon, L\u00e9gitim\u00e9 de France, Duke of Maine. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte in the year of her marriage The wedding ceremony took place on 19 May 1692 in the chapel of the Palace of Versailles, Madame de Montespan was not invited but all of Maine's siblings attended as well as the princes and princesses of the blood. As both the groom and his wife were physically handicapped, members of the court joked that \"look at the union of a one-armed woman and a lame man! What a beautiful couple!\". The marriage was not happy. The couple did not like each other, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte found her husband weak and abhorred his lack of ambition. He could not stand her terrible temper and deliberate attempts to embarrass him at court. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's is said to have had several affairs which were known to Maine.Duchess of Maine To her husband, she was recorded as saying, \"Just look at yourself - a lame bastard! - and you'd like to boss me? I am a pure bred royal princess, Monsieur, with no stain on my cradle! What would you be without the sticks at which everyone laughs? One to support your body, and the other, me, to maintain your rank! And this Leggy wants to rule my steps!\" (Since Maine limped, his wife called him 'Gambillard', which meant leggy). In order to escape the dull court of Madame de Maintenon, Louis XIV's secret wife since October 1683, the enthusiastic duchesse du Maine created a little court at the Ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux, where she entertained brilliantly and immersed herself in political intrigues. The ch\u00e2teau, the former residence of Jean- Baptiste Colbert and his family, was bought in 1700 by her husband for the sum of 900,000 livres. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte spent a further 80,000 livres on its furnishings and decorations. After extensive renovations, she took up residence in December 1700. There, she began to be called La Reine des Abeilles, or Queen of the Bees. In 1703, to amuse herself, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte created her own personal chivalric order, the Order of the Honey Bee. She gave the order to thirty-nine people. Each member had a robe embroidered with silver thread, a wig in the shape of a beehive and a medal embossed with a profile of Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte and engraved with the letters L. BAR. D. SC. D.P.D.L.O.D.L.M.A.M, meaning Louise, baronne de Sceaux, dictatrice perp\u00e9tuelle de l'ordre de la Mouche \u00e0 miel (\"Louise, baroness of Sceaux, dictator of Order of the Honey Bee\").Les Aventures des Cond\u00e9 & Conti To her small court, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte attracted a host of literary figures of the day, including the young Voltaire, the baron de Montesquieu, the cardinal de Bernis, the comte de Caylus, Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9nault and Jean-Baptiste Rousseau. The Ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux at the time of Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte In 1710, she helped to plot the marriage of her sister, Marie Anne, Mademoiselle de Monmorency, to the famous general Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vend\u00f4me. For mercenary reasons, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte wanted a marriage that would not produce any children. Upon the death of a childless Vend\u00f4me, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte hoped that she or her children would inherit the duke's huge estate, which he had acquired as the grandson of the rich heiress, Fran\u00e7oise of Lorraine. At thirty-two, Marie Anne was considered past child-bearing age, and Vend\u00f4me was a well known homosexual, thirty years older than his prospective bride. As it happened, though, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte got nothing. On the duke's death, Marie Anne was created Duchess of \u00c9tampes in her own right and inherited the H\u00f4tel de Vend\u00f4me in Paris, where she died in 1718 from alcoholism. Both the Maines doted on their children. Their daughter, who would remain close to her mother until her death, was baptised at Versailles on 9 April 1714. Mademoiselle du Maine was given the name of her paternal aunt Louise Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon, known at court as Madame la Duchesse. Madame la Duchesse had grown up with Maine under the care of Madame de Maintenon. The guest of honour at the baptism of Mademoiselle du Maine was the small dauphin, the future Louis XV, who was chaperoned by Maine's other sister, the new Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans. The cardinal de Rohan baptised Mademoiselle du Maine. Thanks to the help of Madame de Maintenon, who had always loved Maine, Louis XIV created Maine a Prince of the Blood which put him in line of succession to the throne. In his will, Louis XIV also appointed Maine to be the Regent of France for his five-year-old great- grandson, the future Louis XV. ==Regency of Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans== Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans pointing to an infant Louis XV for whom he acted as regent for till 1723, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte was imprisoned by Orl\u00e9ans as a result of her involvement in the Cellamare Conspiracy in 1719. At the death of the king in 1715, however, the Parlement de Paris annulled Louis XIV's will and named Maine's brother-in-law, Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, as R\u00e9gent for the child king. Upset with this and the role played by the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans in reducing the status of the legitimised children of Louis XIV from the rank of Princes du Sang (which Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte had enjoyed since birth) to mere peers of France, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte induced her husband to join in the Cellamare Conspiracy in the hope of transferring the regency to King Philip V of Spain, the uncle of Louis XV. The plot was named after Antonio del Giudice, Duke of Giovinazzo, Prince of Cellamare, who was the Spanish ambassador to France. In order to gain more support for a new regent, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte started a correspondence with Giulio Alberoni, the Spanish Prime Minister. Among her co- conspirators were the Duke of Richelieu and Melchior de Polignac. The plot, however, was discovered, and both the Maines were arrested and forced to abandon their residence at Sceaux. In 1719, the duke was imprisoned in the Doullens fortress and the duchess in Dijon. Their two sons were put in the care of their governor in Gien, and their daughter was taken from a convent at Maubuisson to another convent at Chaillot in Paris, in the area of the present Trocad\u00e9ro. She stayed at Chaillot till 1720 when her parents were released from their separate imprisonments. After her release, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte led a more peaceful life at Sceaux, still surrounded though by her little court of wits and poets. On 27 December 1718, before their exile, she and her husband had purchased an unfinished house in Paris on the rue de Bourbon (now rue de Lille) from her sister Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon. It was originally designed by the architect Robert de Cotte, but they had hired a new architect, Armand- Claude Mollet, to enlarge and redesign it. It was completed before their return from exile and became known as the H\u00f4tel du Maine (destroyed 1838).Robert Neuman (1994) Robert de Cotte and the Perfection of Architecture in Eighteenth-Century France, Chicago/London: The University of Chicago Press, , pp. 142\u2013143; Alexandre Gady (2008) Les H\u00f4tels particuliers de Paris du Moyen \u00c2ge \u00e0 la Belle \u00c9poque, Paris: Parigramme, , pp. 313. The site of the former H\u00f4tel du Maine is at 84\u201386 rue de Lille. At the time of her imprisonment, she was trying to arrange the marriage of her eldest son, Louis Auguste de Bourbon, heir to the Maine's fortune, to his cousin Charlotte Agla\u00e9, Mademoiselle de Valois. The rivalry between the Maines and Charlotte Agla\u00e9's father, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, was well known, and it was hoped that the wedding would heal old wounds. A marriage did not occur, however, as the young Mademoiselle de Valois refused her cousin, much to the annoyance of the proud Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte. Madame du Maine was not happy when she found out that Charlotte Agla\u00e9 had considered the hand of another cousin, Charles de Bourbon, the son of Monsieur le Duc, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's brother, and Madame la Duchesse, Maine's sister. ==Widowhood== After their release from imprisonment in 1720, the Maines seemed to have reconciled and led a more compatible life rather than being hostile to each other. In May 1736, the duke died at the age of sixty-six.G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Pi\u00e9pape, La duchesse du Maine (1910). Louis XV allowed Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte to keep her apartments at Versailles next to those of her daughter. These apartments overlooked the Orang\u00e9rie. Both her sons also had apartments at court, but both preferred to stay in the country hunting. Madame du Maine tried on more than one occasion to arrange an advantageous marriage for her daughter. The first was to one Monsieur de Guise, but that marriage never materialised. Later, she tried to convince the widower Jacques I, Prince of Monaco, who was often at Versailles, to wed again. Despite the lure of a large dowry, both men considered Mademoiselle du Maine to be very unattractive. Unwed, she died in 1743. She was buried at the \u00c9glise at Sceaux. At the time of her death, her library was numbered at having some 3000 books. The H\u00f4tel du Maine, present day H\u00f4tel Biron where Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte lived as a widow In 1736 Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte received the medieval Ch\u00e2teau de Montrond, which she allowed to be dismantled for its stone and the slate and lead in its roof.\"Ch\u00e2teau de Montrond de Saint-Amand-Montrond\", montjoye.net. In 1737, she leased the H\u00f4tel Peyrenc-de-Moras (today the Mus\u00e9e Rodin) in Paris from the widow of Abraham Peyrenc de Moras. During the remainder of her life, this was also referred to as the H\u00f4tel du Maine, and she died there in January 1753.Alexandre Gady (2008) Les H\u00f4tels particuliers de Paris du Moyen \u00c2ge \u00e0 la Belle \u00c9poque, Paris: Parigramme, , p. 208. Dying at the age of seventy-six, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte had outlived all of her siblings. She was buried at the Saint Jean-Baptiste church in Sceaux. Her oldest son, Louis Auguste, died less than two years after her, having been injured in a duel at Fontainebleau. Her youngest surviving son, Louis Charles, never married and died childless in 1775. He left his fortune to his first cousin, the already wealthy Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthi\u00e8vre. ==Issue== Arms of Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte as Duchess of Maine * Mademoiselle de Dombes (Palace of Versailles, 11 September 1694Palace of Versailles, 15 September 1694) died in infancy. * Louis Constantin de Bourbon, Prince of Dombes (Palace of Versailles, 17 November 1695Palace of Versailles, 28 September 1698) died in infancy. * Mademoiselle d'Aumale (Palace of Versailles, 21 December 1697Palace of Versailles, 4 August 1699) died in infancy. * Louis Auguste de Bourbon, Prince of Dombes (Palace of Versailles, 4 March 1700Palace of Fontainebleau, 1 October 1755) unwed. * Louis Charles de Bourbon, Count of Eu (Ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux, 15 October 170113 July 1775) unwed. * Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Aumale (Palace of Versailles, 31 March 1704Ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux, 2 September 1708) died in infancy. * Louise Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon, Mademoiselle du Maine (Palace of Versailles, 4 December 1707Ch\u00e2teau d'Anet, 19 August 1743) unwed. ==Ancestry== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== Category:1676 births Category:1753 deaths Louise Benedicte Louise Benedicte Category:Countesses of Eu Category:French salon-holders Category:18th-century French people Category:17th-century French people Category:People of the Regency of Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans Category:People of the Ancien R\u00e9gime Category:People from Paris Category:Princesses of the Blood ",
