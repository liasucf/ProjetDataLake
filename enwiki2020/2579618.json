    "text": "The Boston African American National Historic Site, in the heart of Boston, Massachusetts's Beacon Hill neighborhood, interprets 15 pre-Civil War structures relating to the history of Boston's 19th-century African-American community. These include the 1806 African Meeting House, the oldest standing black church in the United States. == Overview == The historical site is located on Beacon Hill, a neighborhood just north of Boston Common. The site was designated in 1980 to \"preserve and commemorate original buildings that housed the nineteenth-century free African-American community on Beacon Hill.\" That year President Jimmy Carter signed bills authorizing this and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site, as well as one to establish the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center in Wilberforce, Ohio. He said: > The two bills that I will sign today represent a three-pronged effort to > preserve a vital, but long neglected, part of American heritage; the history > and culture of Americans of African ancestry and their role in the history > of our nation. Boston's first African residents arrived as slaves in 1638 with early colonists. Over time, more of their descendants were born free to white mothers; in other cases slaveholders freed slaves for service. After the American Revolutionary War, Massachusetts effectively abolished slavery by the terms of its new constitution. By the 1790 census, no slaves were recorded in Massachusetts. African Americans became activists in the abolition movement, also working to gain racial equality and educational parity with whites. They engaged in political processes to meet their objectives. Before the Civil War, more than one half of the 2,000 African Americans in Boston lived on the north slope of Beacon Hill; blacks also lived in the West End north of Cambridge Street, and in the North End. These areas gradually were occupied by new groups of immigrants after African Americans moved to southern areas of Boston. (The North End became a center of Italian immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.) The historic site is one of 39 African-American Heritage Sites of the National Park Service. == Black Heritage Trail == The National Park Service wrote: > The historic buildings along today's Black Heritage Trail\u00ae were the homes, > businesses, schools and churches of a thriving black community that > organized, from the nation's earliest years, to sustain those who faced > local discrimination and national slavery, struggling toward the equality > and freedom promised in America's documents of national liberty. Historical sites along the 1.6 mile (2.5 km) Black Heritage Trail \u00ae in Beacon Hill include: * Robert Gould Shaw / 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment Memorial \u2013 commemorates the first African-American regiment of the United States Colored Troops during the Civil War and the officer who led the 54th Regiment until his death at the Battle of Fort Wagner in SC. * African Meeting House \u2013 built in 1806, the oldest standing African-American church in the country is operated as part of the Museum of African American History * Abiel Smith School \u2013 built in 1834, now adapted and operated as the Museum of African American History * Charles Street Meeting House \u2013 built in 1807, the church had segregated seating.

He helped found the Free African Society and served as Grand Master of the Prince Hall African Masonic Lodge. * Phillips School \u2013 one Boston's first integrated schools * Smith Court Residences \u2013 The five Smith Court homes typify those of black Bostonians in the 1800s. Two notable residents of 3 Smith Court are William Cooper Nell and James Scott, both involved in the abolitionist cause. Nell was an author and considered one of the nation's first black historians. * John J. Smith House \u2013 Smith was an abolitionist leader who helped fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. He recruited for the all-black 5th Cavalry during the Civil War. Afterward he was elected as a three-term member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Smith lived in this house from 1878\u20131893. Most sites on the trail are still used as residences and are not open to the public, except the African Meeting House, Abiel Smith School, and the 54th Regiment Memorial. Park rangers provide free, two-hour guided tours of the trail during the summer; off-season tours are available by reservation. A self-guided trail map and information is available online, at the Boston African American Historic Site, the Boston National Historic Site center, and at the Abiel Smith School. == Educational programs == Staff collaborated on the Freedom Rising: The 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and African Military Service in the Civil War on May 2\u20134, 2013. The multi-day and multi-location program in Boston included historian Henry Louis Gates and actor Danny Glover, with exhibits at Harvard University and the Museum of African American History. == Black Boston highlights (1638\u20131909) == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Black Boston Highlights (1638\u20131909) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:125px;\"| Image ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:450px;\"| Event |- | 1638 | | First enslaved Africans brought to Boston aboard the slave ship Desire. |- | 1641 | | Massachusetts enacted Body of Liberties defining legal slavery in the colony. |- | 1770 | 125px | In 1770, Crispus Attucks, an escaped slave, was the first colonist killed in Boston Massacre.
