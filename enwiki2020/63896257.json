    "text": "The Hafidiya (; 1907-1908) was a coup d'\u00e9tat in Morocco in which Abd al-Hafid seized power from his brother Abdelaziz. Abd al-Hafid started his movement in Marrakesh in the aftermath of the Algeciras Conference and the French occupation of Oujda and Casablanca, gaining the support of the southern Berbers. The Ulama of Fes only supported Abdelhafid with an unprecedented conditioned Bay'ah, or pledge of allegiance. == History == The Algeciras Conference of 1906 had the effect of dividing Moroccans into supporters of either the Sultan Abdelaziz or his brother Abd al-Hafid\u2014into those calling for reform or those calling for jihad, respectively. In May 1907, after France had occupied Oujda, the southern aristocrats\u2014led by the head of the Glaoua tribe, Si Elmadani El Glaoui\u2014invited Abd al-Hafid, an elder brother of Abdelaziz, and viceroy at Marrakesh, to become sultan, and on August 16, 1907, after the bombardment and occupation of Casablanca, Abdelhafid was proclaimed sovereign in Marrakesh with all the usual formalities. In September, Abd-el-Aziz arrived at Rabat from Fez and endeavored to secure the support of the European powers against his brother. From France he accepted the grand cordon of the Legion of Honour, and was later enabled to negotiate a loan. This was seen as leaning to Christianity and aroused further opposition to his rule. == Conditioned Bay'ah == In January 1908, the Ulama of Fes led by Muhammad al-Kattani declared Abdelaziz deposed and they imposed a conditioned bay'ah on Abd al-Hafid. The conditions of their support included that he resume jihad, liberate Oujda and Casablanca, end the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 system, restrict Europeans to port cities, and consult the ummah in all major decisions. == Battle of Marrakesh == The Battle of Marrakesh took place on August 19, 1908 when supporters of Abd al-Hafid destroyed the mahallah of Abdelaziz on the road from Rabat to Marrakesh. Abdelaziz fled to Casablanca, then occupied by the French. == Press == The French arabophone propaganda newspaper Es-Saada supported Abdelaziz, and attacked supporters of Abd al-Hafid, including Ma al-'Aynayn and . With French encouragement, supporters of Abdelaziz founded as-Sabaah () in Tangier in 1904. In early 1908, Abd al-Hafid's Makhzen purchased Lisan al-Maghrib (), an arabophone newspaper; it was run by two Lebanese brothers, Faraj-Allah and Artur Namor, and it printed open letters to Abdelaziz and then Abd al-Hafid. In 1908, Abd al-Hafid ordered the creation of the newspaper al-Fajar (), which would promote his views. It published its first edition on June 27, 1908. == References == Category:History of Morocco Category:1900s in Morocco Category:Coups d'\u00e9tat Category:Civil wars ",
