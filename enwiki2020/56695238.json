    "text": "The neurolinguistic approach is a pedagogical method used in acquiring/teaching second or foreign languages (abridged as L2/FL) in a school setting, singling out the ability to communicate, both orally and in writing. Originally, it was developed for the teaching of French, but there are now a variety of programs based on this approach for the teaching of several different languages. The most widely used program in Canada is that known as \"Intensive French\" (IF). ==Context== The NLA was developed in Canada by Claude Germain, of the D\u00e9partement de didactique des langues at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, and Joan Netten, of the Faculty of Education at Memorial University of Newfoundland, in the context of the growing influence of emerging educational neurosciences. It draws principally from the research carried out by Michel Paradis (1994,Paradis, M. \u201cNeurolinguistic aspects of implicit and explicit memory: implications for bilingualism\u201d, in N. Ellis (ed.), Implicit and Explicit Learning of Second Languages. London, Academic Press, 1994, p. 393-419. 2004,Paradis, M. A Neurolinguistic Theory of Bilingualism, Amsterdam/Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2004. 2009Paradis, M. Declarative and Procedural Determinants of Second Languages, Amsterdam/Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2009.) of McGill University and by the Institut des sciences cognitives, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM), as well as by research conducted by Nick C. Ellis (Centre for Complex systems, University of Michigan). It is also influenced by Vygotsky\u2019s concepts of social interaction (1997Vygotsky, L.S. Pens\u00e9e et langage, \u00c9ditions La Dispute, 1997.). The NLA is characterised by the need to ensure the independent development, in a classroom setting, of both components of any effective communication: an implicit competence, or the ability to spontaneously use a L2/FL orally, and explicit knowledge, or the awareness of the way a language functions, its grammatical rules and its vocabulary. This dimension of the NLA is based on Paradis (1994, 2004) and Nick C. Ellis (2011Ellis, N. \u201cLanguage acquisition just Zipf\u2019s right along.\u201d Paper given at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, January 2011.). Paradis\u2019s research makes a clear distinction between explicit knowledge, which is the conscious knowledge surrounding a L2/FL and which is learnt through noticing and explanations, and implicit competence, which can only be acquired non-consciously by using the language in authentic communicative situations. In NLA, implicit competence is referred to as internal grammar. This internal grammar is formed of a network of neuronal connections formed in the brain by the frequent use of the same pathways or circuits; these are NOT rules, but a linguistic structure\u2019s frequent statistical patterns (Paradis, 2004; Ellis, 2011). Furthermore, explicit knowledge is referred to in the NLA as external grammar. Paradis\u2019s research shows that explicit knowledge (external grammar) is sustained by the declarative memory, while implicit competence (internal grammar), which is a skill, is sustained by the procedural memory (Germain et Netten, 2013aGermain, C. et Netten, J. \u201cPour une nouvelle approche de l\u2019enseignement de la grammaire en classe de langue : grammaire et approche neurolinguistique\u201d, Revue japonaise de didactique du fran\u00e7ais, vol. 8, no 1, 2013a, p. 172-187.). According to Paradis, there is no direct connection between these two components. While external grammar is taught relatively effectively in the classroom, the same cannot be said of internal grammar. This is why conventional L2/FL teaching programs, generally based on current methods or approaches, cannot lead most students to acquire spontaneous communication in the language being taught. This is true even of programs which claim to use a communicative approach but which, despite its creators\u2019 theoretical bases, first teach explicit knowledge (grammar rules or knowledge generally founded on written language) before the acquisition of implicit competence, which belongs to oral language (Germain et Netten, 2005,Germain, C. and Netten, J. \u201cPlace et r\u00f4le de l\u2019oral dans l\u2019enseignement / apprentissage d\u2019une L2,\u201d, Babylonia, no 2, 2005, p. 7-10. archive 2013b,Germain, C. and Netten, J. \u201cGrammaire de l\u2019oral et grammaire de l\u2019\u00e9crit dans l\u2019approche neurolinguistique (ANL)\u201d, Synergies Mexique, no 3, 2013b, p. 15-29. archive Germain, 2017Germain, C. L\u2019approche neurolinguistique (ANL) \u2013 Foire aux questions. Longueuil, Myosotis Presse, 2017.). Paradis\u2019s views have been challenged in some quarters; however, the co-conceptors of the NLA find them to be the most accurate/satisfactory descriptors of the SL acquisition/learning process. ==Fundamental principles== The NLA is based on five fundamental principles developed by Germain and Netten (2011,Germain, C. and Netten, J. \u201cImpact de la conception de l\u2019acquisition d\u2019une langue seconde ou \u00e9trang\u00e8re sur la conception de la langue et de son enseignement\u201d, Synergies Chine, no 6, 2011, p. 25-36. archive 2012a;Germain, C. and Netten, J. \u201cUne p\u00e9dagogie de la litt\u00e9ratie sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 la L2\u201d, R\u00e9flexions, vol. 31, no 1, 2012a, p. 17-18. archive Netten and Germain, 2012Netten, J. and Germain, C. Approche neurolinguistique \u2013 Guide p\u00e9dagogique \u2013 Fran\u00e7ais intensif, 2e \u00e9dition, remani\u00e9e, 2011.) to create the necessary classroom conditions for students to first learn spontaneous oral communication in their L2/FL, before moving on to explicit knowledge of the language in reading and writing activities (Germain et Netten 2013b; Germain, 2017). ===Acquisition of internal grammar (implicit competence)=== In order to create a classroom atmosphere where a limited number of linguistic structures are used and reused often enough to ensure that patterns, or neuronal connections, are developed in the students\u2019 procedural memory, each teaching unit introduces three or four communicative functions which are related both to each other and to the unit\u2019s theme. Each function is presented and used individually in several different situations allowing for brief personal conversations between the students. At the end of the unit, the functions are combined to permit more complex discussions on the subject. Thus, oral language is learnt in a conversational context. The importance of the context in permitting an effective transfer to other situations has been confirmed in Segalowitz\u2019s recent work in cognitive neuroscience, in particular his concept of Transfer Appropriate Processing (TAP) (Segalowitz, 2010Segalowitz, N. Cognitive bases of second language fluency, New York, Oxon, UK, Routledge & Abingdon, 2010.). ===Recourse to a literacy-based perspective in teaching a L2/FL=== Literacy is usually understood as the ability to use a language to interpret and understand the environment. A literacy-based perspective allows the teacher to consider the acquisition of a language as the development of skills rather than of knowledge. This also means prioritising the development of oral skills, a view confirmed by recent research in neurodidactic science (Huc and Smith, 2008Huc, P. and Vincent Smith, B. \u201cNaissance de la neurodidactique\u201d, Le Fran\u00e7ais dans le Monde, 357, 2008, p. 30-31.) which calls for the development of verbal communication before reading and writing. Texts used during the reading portion of the class, as well as the topics for written work, are based on the same theme and involve using the same structures first developed verbally. Reading and writing are taught directly in the L2/FL without recourse to translation. The strategies used are similar to those used for developing literacy when teaching the students their first language, but must be modified. For instance, a greater emphasis may be placed on oral preparation before reading and writing, which is essential when developing literacy in a L2/FL, given that the students\u2019 internal grammar is considerably more limited than that of those who are learning to read and write in their first language (Germain et Netten, 2005, 2012,Germain, C. and Netten, J. \u201cUne p\u00e9dagogie de la litt\u00e9ratie sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 la L2\u201d, R\u00e9flexions, vol. 31, no 1, 2012, p. 17-18. archive 2013b, Germain, 2017). A literacy-based approach also allows for external grammar to be brought into play after the language has been used orally and in context (observing grammatical details in the reading text and using these observed cases when writing paragraphs). ===Recourse to a project- based approach=== In order for students to acquire an internal grammar, the focus must be on the message rather than on the language, as internal grammar can only be acquired unconsciously that is, without consciously paying attention to the language\u2019s features (Paradis, 1994, 2004, 2009). To facilitate the creation of significant situations and interesting, cognitively challenging tasks for the students, the content of the teaching units is organised sequentially, going from a few mini projects to a final project. The suggested activities are therefore not isolated and require the students\u2019 active participation, which calls on other cerebral mechanisms that are essential to successfully acquiring a language (Paradis, 2004). This type of organisation also allows each unit\u2019s language structures to be used and reused, while allowing the teacher to help students to learn by gradually increasing the difficulty of both tasks and language structures. ===Use of authentic communicative situations=== The ability to communicate spontaneously develops only through authentic communication. It cannot be learnt through controlled exercises or by memorising dialogues (R. Ellis, 1997Ellis. R. SLA research and language teaching. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997.) where the language thus learned is focused, foremost, on linguistic forms and is stored in the declarative memory. This type of activity does not permit the student to use the same structures sufficiently often to develop the patterns required to create implicit competence, or internal grammar, unconsciously. Moreover, only authentic communication calls on other cerebral mechanisms that are necessary for acquisition to happen, such as those linked to motivation (Paradis, 2004). In the NLA, all classroom communication is authentic: the teacher does not ask unrealistic questions and the students\u2019 answers are always personal. Communication always takes place in the L2/FL. ===Use of interactive teaching strategies=== Interaction between students in the L2/FL is an essential ingredient for developing internal grammar and the ability to communicate spontaneously. To facilitate such interactions, the NLA applies five steps to teaching oral communication, throughout the teaching units, as well as encouraging activities carried out in pairs or in small-groups. On the linguistic level, the way is prepared for students to use the structures they require to accomplish the assigned tasks, but the interactions are authentic in that the students express their own thoughts. There are also three other specific teaching strategies recommended in using the NLA: fluency, accuracy, and purposeful listening. The students must reply in complete sentences when learning new language structures, in order to facilitate the building of their internal grammar and the ease with which they use the L2/FL. For internal grammar, accuracy is achieved by consistent and instant oral correction of errors and having the student reuse the correct structure orally. Essentially, in developing internal grammar, oral correction of errors replaces the teaching of grammar rules. Purposeful listening, meanwhile, replaces the usual oral comprehension exercises; it is a matter of encouraging learners to constantly listen to what the teacher and the other learners say\" (Germain, 2017, p. 89). The NLA uses eight strategies for learning/teaching both reading and writing. Currently (2018), there are several implementations of the NLA, notably the Intensive French (IF) program in Canada and a French language training program at a Chinese university. The Canadian IF, which is geared to 5th and 6th grade students (11/12 years old) and continues to the end of high school, was launched in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1998. Since then, it has spread to almost all Canadian provinces and territories (the French-majority province of Qu\u00e9bec has an intensive English program which, as it is not based on NLA principles, is similar but not identical to IF). Over 70,000 students have participated in the first year of the IF program in Canada since its inception. In China, the program is aimed at young adults (median age of 19) and was launched at the South China Normal University (Guangzhou) in 2010. It has attracted much interest from other Chinese institutions (including a high school) as well as in Japan (Gal Bailly, 2011;Gal Bailly, T. Mise en place d\u2019une m\u00e9thode contemporaine d\u2019enseignement du fran\u00e7ais langue \u00e9trang\u00e8re en milieu universitaire chinois. \u00c9valuation comparative entre la m\u00e9thode traditionnelle chinoise et l\u2019approche neurolinguistique dans un cadre pr\u00e9 exp\u00e9rimental, Master 2 Sciences Humaines et Sciences Sociales, Universit\u00e9 de Rouen, 2011, 147 p.

These programs were developed under the direction of the NLA\u2019s co-developers. At this time, other implementations of the NLA are being developed in Canada by other professionals in order to teach certain First Nations languages in Yukon and the Northwest Territories, as well as in Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, the James Bay region of Qu\u00e9bec for the teaching of English, French and Cree, and the teaching of Mohawk, French and English to the Mohawk Nation which extends through the southern part of Ontario and Quebec and northern New York state. Programs in Spanish and Mandarin are also implemented in the Calgary Public School Board. Any curricular resource that conforms to NLA principles can be adapted to teach communication skills in any L2/FL, as suggested by a recent trial of teaching/learning Spanish among francophone Quebeckers in a university setting (specifically, at UQ\u00c0M, the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al). ==Notes== ==References== * N.
