She was the winner of the fifth series of the French Star Academy TV talent show. ==Biography== Magalie Va\u00e9 grew up in Le Thillay, in Val-d'Oise. In September 2005, she was selected to participate to Star Academy France. Four months later she ended up winning one million euros and a record deal to release her debut studio album. On 6 February 2006, Magalie went to Canada to record her album, produced by Rick Allison. The first single, Je ne suis qu'une chanson (I am but a song) was released a month later. Her self-titled album was released on 3 April 2006 to generally positive reviews. In 2009 the French press reported that Magalie's second album had been recorded for over a year but got pushed back due to contractual disagreements with Universal Music. In 2010, Va\u00e9 signed with Midlands Artistic. Her second album was scheduled for release in 2011. In January 2011, she released the single \"L'homme shampooing\", followed by \"La naus\u00e9e\" in May. In November 2011, she gave birth to her first child. Her second album M\u00e9tamorphoses was finally released in February 2014. A third single, \"La Fi\u00e8vre acheteuse\", was released in January 2015. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Year !rowspan=\"2\"|Title !colspan=\"2\"|Peak chart positionsMagalie Va\u00e9 album chart positions at lescharts.com |- !width=\"30\"|FRA !width=\"30\"|BEL WAL |- |2006 |Magalie Va\u00e9 * Released: 6 April 2006 * Label: Universal Music France |align=\"center\"| 13 |align=\"center\"| 23 |- |2014 |M\u00e9tamorphoses * Released: 19 February 2014 * Label: Midlands Artistic |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Year !rowspan=\"2\"|Title !colspan=\"3\"|Peak chart positionsMagalie Va\u00e9 singles chart positions at lescharts.com !rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- !width=\"30\"|FRA !width=\"30\"|BEL WAL !width=\"30\"|SWI |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2006 |align=\"left\"| \"Je ne suis qu'une chanson\" |align=\"center\"| 5 |align=\"center\"| 6 |align=\"center\"| 63 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| Magalie Va\u00e9 |- |align=\"left\"| \"Qui a m\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00e7a ?\" |align=\"center\"| 31 |align=\"center\"| 16 |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |- |2011 |align=\"left\"| \"L'homme shampooing\" |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"| M\u00e9tamorphoses |- |2011 |align=\"left\"| \"La naus\u00e9e\" |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |- |2015 |align=\"left\"| \"La fi\u00e8vre acheteuse\" |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |align=\"center\"| \u2013 |- |} == References == Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Gonesse Category:French-language singers Category:Star Academy winners Category:Star Academy (France) participants Vae, Magalie Category:21st-century French singers Category:21st-century French women singers ",
