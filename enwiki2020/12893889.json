    "text": "One More Time is a 1931 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Rudolf Ising. The short was released on October 3, 1931, and stars Foxy as a Prohibition-era cop. This was Foxy's last theatrical appearance. A colorized version was produced in Korea by Fred Ladd, for Sunset Productions, the copyright holder at the time. It was made by re-drawing the cels and backgrounds. The animation in this version is inferior, since many drawings were left out, causing jerky movement. ==Plot== The cartoon shows police officer Foxy who deals with armed criminals, traffic violations, and his girlfriend's huge dog. The main action involves a group of gangsters kidnapping Foxy's girlfriend while making their getaway; Foxy chases them on a mechanical horse, rescues his girlfriend, and puts the criminals in jail\u2014only to be shot in the back by a crow. ==Alternate version== When the cartoon was redrawn colorized in 1973, it was renamed On Duty and featured different music. ==Availability== One More Time is available on disc 3 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1931 films Category:1931 animated films Category:1930s American animated films Category:1930s animated short films Category:1931 comedy films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films scored by Frank Marsales Category:Films directed by Rudolf Ising Category:Films featuring Foxy Category:Police comedy films Category:Animated films about animals Category:Animated films about foxes Category:1930s police films Category:Warner Bros.
