    "text": "David Cu\u00e9llar Tainta (born 1 November 1979) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a right winger. ==Club career== Born in Pamplona, Navarre, Cu\u00e9llar came through the youth ranks of Athletic Bilbao, but managed to play just 14 games without scoring from 2000 to 2002, eventually leaving the club. His debut with the first team came on 20 December 2000, coming as a late substitute in a 1\u20131 home draw against Valencia CF. After two years with Elche CF and two with Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona in the second division, Cu\u00e9llar made a comeback to La Liga with the latter team in the 2006\u201307 season (scoring his first goal in the top level on 24 September 2006, in a 2\u20132 home draw to Racing de Santander) before earning himself a move back to Athletic for the following campaign, where he only appeared in seven matches. Subsequently, Cu\u00e9llar joined Real Murcia who had been just relegated to division two, appearing rarely in his debut year. On 31 August 2009 he was loaned for a season to another side in that tier, UD Salamanca, being released by the former in the following off-season. ==Personal life== Cu\u00e9llar's older brother, Crescencio (born 1970), was also a footballer. A forward who was also brought up in Lezama, he managed four appearances in the first division, with Athletic (one match) and CP M\u00e9rida (three). ==Honours== Basconia *Tercera Divisi\u00f3n: 1997\u201398 ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Pamplona Category:Spanish footballers Category:Navarrese footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Divisiones Regionales de F\u00fatbol players Category:CD Basconia footballers Category:Bilbao Athletic footballers Category:Athletic Bilbao footballers Category:Elche CF players Category:Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona footballers Category:Real Murcia players Category:UD Salamanca players Category:CF Reus Deportiu footballers Category:Spain youth international footballers ",
