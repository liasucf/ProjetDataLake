    "text": "The full film Shoulder Arms is Charlie Chaplin's second film for First National Pictures. Released in 1918, it is a silent comedy set in France during World War I. It co-starred Edna Purviance and Sydney Chaplin, Chaplin's elder brother. It is Chaplin's shortest feature film as well as the first feature film that he directed. ==Plot== Charlie is in boot camp in the \"awkward squad.\" Once in France he gets no letters from home. He finally gets a package containing limburger cheese which requires a gas mask and which he throws over into the German trench. He goes \"over the top\" and captures thirteen Germans (\"I surrounded them\"), then volunteers to wander through the German lines disguised as a tree trunk. With the help of a French girl he captures the Kaiser and the Crown Prince and is given a statue and victory parade in New York and then ... fellow soldiers wake him from his dream. ==Credited cast== *Charles Chaplin ...

Motorcyclist ==Reception== Shoulder Arms proved to be Chaplin's most popular film, critically and commercially, up to that point. A review in the October 21, 1918 New York Times was typical: > \"'The fool's funny,' was the chuckling observation of one of those who saw > Charlie Chaplin's new film. Shoulder Arms, at the Strand yesterday--and, > apparently, that's the way everybody felt. There have been learned > discussions as to whether Chaplin's comedy is low or high, artistic or > crude, but no one can deny that when he impersonates a screen fool he is > funny. Most of those who go to find fault with him remain to laugh. They may > still find fault, but they will keep on laughing.\" ==See also== *List of World War I films ==External links== * Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:1918 films Category:1918 comedy films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:World War I films Category:Military humor in film Category:Surviving American silent films Category:Cultural depictions of Wilhelm II Category:First National Pictures films ",
