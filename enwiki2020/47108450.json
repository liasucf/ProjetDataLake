    "text": "Blankenese Low Lighthouse is a lighthouse on the river Elbe, located in the Hamburg district of Blankenese. It entered into service in 1984 and is scheduled to be demolished in 2020. Lighthouses New Low, Old Upper and New Upper Lighthouse New Low Lighthouses Old & New Low == Description == Blankenese Low Lighthouse and Blankenese High Lighthouse form a range of lights for ships sailing upriver on the Elbe. With a range of 8.4 kilometers, they have the longest range on the Unterelbe. The lighthouse is made of concrete and stands 42 meters tall. The column is striped in red and white with a white steel lantern house at the top. The column has 12 portholes facing the river and two on the other side; the lantern has another six. It is positioned approximately 30 meter offshore in the river Elbe and 1,340 meters away from the high lighthouse. On the base of the tower is a 5 m high two- level staircase deck. The tower itself works as a sun clock pointer to the people seating at its shadow. Inside it has a helix staircase going to the top. There is no seating place at the top of the platform, only at the bottom, which by high tide sometimes get washed. At the third floor is a door with a plate showing the function of the structure. However, due to graffiti this plate is covered. The lighthouse is remotely controlled by the Seemansh\u00f6ft Pilot Centre and belongs to the Hamburg Port Authority. === Construction === Due to the offshore location of the lighthouse, a caisson was used to build the 700 ton concrete foundation to a depth of ten meters below the water surface. The 11 ton lantern house was assembled with the help of a floating crane. The development stage of the range of lights in the early 1980s was met by controversy, including public protests and legal action. === Replacement === Due to adjustments to the Elbe fairway, both the High and the Low Lighthouses are scheduled to be replaced to a similar 33 m high at coordinates and demolished. It is planned to preserve the base of it, but without the steel platform. However, it is not the HPA that decides if and how this socket can be used later. As long as the interests of the port or the shipping industry are not affected, this is the task of other Hamburg authorities. == Gallery == Blankenese Low Lighthouse.jpg|Lighthouse with Orion Leader NYK Line Vehicle Carrier Lighthouse Stairs.JPG|Lighthouse stairs Lighthouse Ground Level.JPG|Lighthouse ground level Leuchtturm Unterfeuer Blankenese 2014.jpg|Lighthouse Hamburg-Blankenese, view from the pontoon to the lighthouse.jpg|Lighthouse Blankenese Low Lighthouse Platform 2015.jpg|Lower Platform Lighthouse Low Tide.JPG|Lighthouse Low Tide Rule of 7 m NN Lighthouse Tower bottom.JPG|Lighthouse Tower seen from bottom Detail 05.JPG|Plate description Detail 03.JPG|Companies involved Detail 04.JPG|Location Detail 02.JPG|Water level (m) 44.72 NN (Niedrig-Niedrg) low-low tide Detail 08.JPG|Water level (m) 2.55 NN Detail 01.JPG|Detail Detail 06.JPG|Deck rail Detail 07.JPG|Door graffiti == See also == * List of lighthouses and lightvessels in Germany == References == == External links == * * Daten und Bilder bei leuchtturm-atlas.de * Daten bei leuchtturm-web.de * Beschreibung auf leuchttuerme.net * Bilder und Beschreibung Category:Lighthouses in Hamburg Category:Buildings and structures in Altona, Hamburg ",
