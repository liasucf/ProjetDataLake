Its programs can also be heard in Houghton on WXXY (formerly WJSL) 90.3 FM and WXXI-TV subchannel 16.7 . They are owned by the WXXI Public Broadcasting Council, which also owns WXXI-TV, WRUR and news/information-formatted AM station WXXI. ==History== WXXI-FM signed on December 23, 1974 from the new WXXI studios at 280 State Street in Rochester, with a transmitter located on Pinnacle Hill in Brighton, Monroe County, New York. While its initial format was a mixture of classical music, folk music, jazz, news and talk, WXXI-FM became a predominantly classical station after the 1975 format change of WBFB 92.5 from classical to all-news. WBFB donated its classical music library to WXXI, and WBFB program director Simon Pontin soon joined WXXI-FM as its morning host. On July 2, 1984, WXXI shifted most of its news programming, including \"All Things Considered,\" to its new second service, WXXI (AM) 1370. With the exception of some weekend and evening specialty programming, WXXI-FM became a full-time classical music service. In 2007, WXXI-FM added HD Radio service, offering a simulcast of WXXI (AM) on its HD2 channel and a third service of news and information on its HD3 channel. ==Programming== Headquarters in Rochester, New York WXXI-FM originates broadcasts of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, hosted by Brenda Tremblay. WXXI-FM also originates the national programs With Heart and Voice, hosted first by the late Richard Gladwell and then by Peter DuBois, and Fascinatin' Rhythm, hosted by Michael Lasser, as well as local live music broadcasts Live from Hochstein and Backstage Pass.
