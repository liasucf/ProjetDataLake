    "text": "The 42nd Ryder Cup Matches were held in France from 28\u201330 September 2018 on the Albatros Course of Le Golf National in Guyancourt, a suburb southwest of Paris. It was the second Ryder Cup to be held in Continental Europe (rather than Great Britain or Ireland), after the 1997 contest, which was held in Spain. The United States were the defending champions, but had lost the last five matches in Europe, having last won there in 1993. Europe regained the Ryder Cup, winning by 17\u00bd points to 10\u00bd. ==Format== The Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format was as follows: *Day 1 (Friday) \u2013 4 foursome (alternate shot) matches and 4 fourball (better ball) matches *Day 2 (Saturday) \u2013 4 foursome matches and 4 fourball matches *Day 3 (Sunday) \u2013 12 singles matches On the first two days there were four fourball matches in the morning and four foursome matches in the afternoon. With a total of 28 points available, 14\u00bd points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion, the United States, to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes. ==Bidding for the 2018 Ryder Cup== The Opening tee at the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National Ryder Cup Europe confirmed originally six countries\u2014France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden\u2014to be interested in bidding for the 2018 Ryder Cup. The deadline for the submission of bids was set for 30 April 2010; Sweden withdrew from the bidding early that month, while the Spanish bidding host city of Tres Cantos showed poor popular support. There were five bids to host the event: *France: Saint-Quentin-en- Yvelines *Germany: Neuburg/Rohrenfeld *Portugal: Lisbon/Comporta, Alentejo Coast *Spain: Madrid/Guadarrama *Netherlands: Rotterdam/Lingewaal France was announced as host on 17 May 2011, despite calls for the Cup to be held in Spain as a tribute to the late Seve Ballesteros. ==Course== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !align=\"left\"|Hole!!1!!2!!3!!4!!5!!6!!7!!8!!9!!Out!!10!!11!!12!!13!!14!!15!!16!!17!!18!!In!!Total |- | align=\"center\"|Metre||380||195||515||445||370||350||440||190||545||3,430||350||175||405||390||555||365||160||443||430||3,273||6,703 |- | align=\"center\"|Yards||416||213||563||487||405||383||481||208||596||3,752||383||191||443||427||607||399||175||484||470||3,579||7,331 |- | align=\"center\"|Par||4||3||5||4||4||4||4||3||5||36||4||3||4||4||5||4||3||4||4||35||71 |} ==Team qualification and selection== ===Europe=== The European team qualification rules were announced on 18 January 2017. There were a number of changes compared to 2016 with an increase in the number of captain's picks from three to four. The team consisted of: * The leading four players on the Race to Dubai Points List **Points earned in all Race to Dubai tournaments starting with the 2017 D+D Real Czech Masters and ending with the 2018 Made in Denmark that finished on 2 September 2018. Points earned from the 2018 BMW PGA Championship onwards, were multiplied by 1.5. * The leading four players, not qualified above, on the World Points List **Total World Points earned in Official World Golf Ranking events starting on 31 August 2017 (the start date of the D+D Real Czech Masters) and ending on 26 August 2018 and thereafter only at the Made in Denmark tournament. Points earned from the date of the 2018 BMW PGA Championship onwards, were multiplied by 1.5. No World points were earned from tournaments staged opposite Rolex Series tournaments in both 2017 and 2018. * Four captain's picks Membership criteria for the European Tour were reduced from five tournaments to four (outside the majors and WGCs) for the 2018 season. As in previous Ryder Cups, all players had to be members of the European Tour to be eligible to play for Europe. Changes were also made to the eligibility of future captains and vice-captains. Paul Casey became a member of the European Tour at the start of 2018. Since he was not a member during 2017 he did not earn points until the start of 2018. The leading 15 players in the final Ryder Cup European point list were: {| class=\"wikitable\" !Position !Name !Points |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|1 |Francesco Molinari |align=right|6,182,450.35 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|2 |Justin Rose |align=right|4,518,651.42 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|3 |Tyrrell Hatton |align=right|4,326,297.77 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|4 |Tommy Fleetwood |align=right|3,668,310.57 |- |align=center|5 |Thorbj\u00f8rn Olesen |align=right|3,634,765.46 |- |align=center|6 |Jon Rahm |align=right|3,617,769.82 |- |align=center|7 |Rory McIlroy |align=right|3,482,791.06 |- |align=center|8 |Alex Nor\u00e9n |align=right|3,444,442.21 |- |align=center|9 |Russell Knox |align=right|2,659,683.33 |- |align=center|10 |Eddie Pepperell |align=right|2,509,997.42 |- |align=center|11 |Matthew Fitzpatrick |align=right|2,390,681.42 |- |align=center|12 |Rafa Cabrera-Bello |align=right|2,256,340.05 |- |align=center|13 |Matt Wallace |align=right|2,081,455.61 |- |align=center|14 |Ross Fisher |align=right|2,003,759.99 |- |align=center|15 |Jorge Campillo |align=right|1,769,824.97 |} Players in qualifying places are shown in green.

The team consisted of: * The leading eight players on the Ryder Cup points list, gained in the following events **2017 major championships **2017 World Golf Championship events and The Players Championship (half points) **2018 major championships (double points for the winner, 50% extra for those who make the cut) **2018 PGA Tour events.

The qualification rules were similar to those used for the 2016 Ryder Cup. The points given for the 2018 season major championships were reduced from double to 50% extra (except for the winner who still received double points). The dates on which the captain's picks were made were brought forward by one or two weeks. The leading 15 players in the final points list after the final qualifying event, the 2018 PGA Championship were: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" !Position !Name !Points |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|1 |align=left|Brooks Koepka |13,298.472 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|2 |align=left|Dustin Johnson |9,549.287 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|3 |align=left|Justin Thomas |8,929.122 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|4 |align=left|Patrick Reed |7,821.880 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|5 |align=left|Bubba Watson |5,584.137 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|6 |align=left|Jordan Spieth |5,481.427 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|7 |align=left|Rickie Fowler |5,006.112 |- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\" |align=center|8 |align=left|Webb Simpson |4,534.745 |- style=\"background:#ffa;\" |align=center|9 |align=left|Bryson DeChambeau |4,316.108 |- style=\"background:#ffa;\" |align=center|10 |align=left|Phil Mickelson |4,207.953 |- style=\"background:#ffa;\" |align=center|11 |align=left|Tiger Woods |4,196.794 |- |align=center|12 |align=left|Xander Schauffele |3,924.096 |- |align=center|13 |align=left|Matt Kuchar |3,843.696 |- |align=center|14 |align=left|Kevin Kisner |3,680.121 |- style=\"background:#ffa;\" |align=center|15 |align=left|Tony Finau |3,512.021 |} Players in qualifying places are shown in green. Captain's picks are shown in yellow. ==Teams== ===Captains=== Thomas Bj\u00f8rn was named as the European captain on 6 December 2016. He was chosen by a five-man panel made up of the three most recent European Ryder Cup captains (Darren Clarke, Paul McGinley and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal), the Chief Executive of the European Tour, Keith Pelley, and European Tour Tournament Committee member Henrik Stenson. Jim Furyk was named as the USA captain on 11 January 2017. ===Vice-captains=== Each captain selected a number of vice-captains to assist him during the tournament. Bj\u00f8rn selected Robert Karlsson as his first vice-captain in May 2017. In May 2018 he selected four more vice-captains: Luke Donald, P\u00e1draig Harrington, Graeme McDowell and Lee Westwood. Rapha\u00ebl Jacquelin was also on hand for the Europeans, as an assistant. Furyk named Davis Love III as a vice-captain, soon after his appointment in January 2017. He later added Steve Stricker and Tiger Woods in February 2018. On 4 September 2018, Furyk named David Duval, Zach Johnson, and Matt Kuchar as additional vice-captains. Tiger Woods, who had previously been named a vice-captain, would no longer serve in this position as he was chosen to be one of Furyk's captain's picks. ===Players=== Thomas Bj\u00f8rn announced the four captain's picks at 2 pm BST on 5 September. Captain's picks are shown in yellow.

Pairings were announced after the Opening Ceremony on Thursday. The first point of the 2018 Ryder Cup was won by Team USA, with Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler winning 4 & 2 against Rory McIlroy and Thorbj\u00f8rn Olesen. Despite being two up with six holes to play, Jon Rahm and Justin Rose lost out to Brooks Koepka and Tony Finau on the 18th hole, while Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas also won by one against Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton, putting Team USA 3\u20130 ahead. A spectator struck by Koepka's drive on the 6th hole lost the sight in one eye. Coming back from two down, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari defeated Tiger Woods and Patrick Reed 3 & 1 to secure Team Europe's first point of the tournament, and to end the first morning 3\u20131 in favour of Team USA. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" ! style=\"width:12em;\"| ! style=\"width:5.5em;\"| Results ! style=\"width:12em;\"| |- | Rose/Rahm |align=left| 1 up | Koepka/Finau |- | McIlroy/Olesen |align=left| 4 & 2 | Johnson/Fowler |- | Casey/Hatton |align=left| 1 up | Thomas/Spieth |- | Molinari/Fleetwood |align=left| 3 & 1 | Reed/Woods |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" | 1 | Session | 3 |- style=\"background:#afa;\" ! 1 !

Team USA secured their only point of the morning session with Thomas and Spieth defeating Poulter and Rahm 2 & 1, to leave the overall tournament at 8\u20134 in Team Europe's favour. Despite the strong performance, Team Europe captain Thomas Bj\u00f8rn reiterated: \"Nothing's won, we're just over the halfway stage. There's no bit happiness yet, there's still a determination and work to be done\". {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" ! style=\"width:12em;\"| ! style=\"width:5.5em;\"| Results ! style=\"width:12em;\"| |- | Garc\u00eda/McIlroy |align=left| 2 & 1 | Koepka/Finau |- | Casey/Hatton |align=left| 3 & 2 | Johnson/Fowler |- | Molinari/Fleetwood |align=left| 4 & 3 | Reed/Woods |- | Poulter/Rahm |align=left| 2 & 1 | Thomas/Spieth |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" | 3 | Session | 1 |- style=\"background:#afa;\" ! 8 !

It saw Team Europe's Molinari and Fleetwood win for the fourth time, a European record in the Ryder Cup, this time 5 & 4 over Woods and DeChambeau. Team USA's Spieth and Thomas defeated Poulter and McIlroy 4 & 3, while Simpson and Watson's green play saw them defeat Europe's Garc\u00eda and Nor\u00e9n 3 & 2\\. The fourth pairing saw Rose and Stenson narrowly beat Johnson and Koepka 2 & 1 as a result of some good putting late in the round. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse; text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" ! style=\"width:12em;\"| ! style=\"width:5.5em;\"| Results ! style=\"width:12em;\"| |- | Stenson/Rose |align=left| 2 & 1 | Johnson/Koepka |- | Garc\u00eda/Nor\u00e9n |align=left| 3 & 2 | Watson/Simpson |- | Molinari/Fleetwood |align=left| 5 & 4 | Woods/DeChambeau |- | Poulter/McIlroy |align=left| 4 & 3 | Thomas/Spieth |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" | 2 | Session | 2 |- style=\"background:#afa;\" ! 10 ! Overall ! 6 |} ==Sunday's singles matches== The United States put their best players at the top of the card on Sunday, and despite the four point deficit threatened a comeback in the singles, as they won 3.5 points from the first five matches. Justin Thomas beat Rory McIlroy on the final hole as the latter's approach found the water, and Tony Finau defeated the previously unbeaten Tommy Fleetwood 6&4. However, from then on Europe dominated, winning the next six matches to lead 16\u00bd\u20139\u00bd. Guarantees of at least a half-point each for Garc\u00eda and Stenson (both of whom later got full points) meant that victory was already assured before the 14\u00bd-point winning post was officially reached when Phil Mickelson, already three holes down, found the water on the 16th hole and conceded the hole and match to Molinari, who became the first player for Europe to score what is now the maximum possible five points in a single Ryder Cup. The remaining two matches were shared between the teams, leaving the final score 17\u00bd\u201310\u00bd to Europe. Sergio Garc\u00eda's singles win made him the all-time Ryder Cup points leader, with 25\u00bd points in nine appearances, overtaking Nick Faldo's 25 points in 11 appearances. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" ! style=\"width:12em;\"| ! style=\"width:5.5em;\"| Results ! style=\"width:12em;\"| !
