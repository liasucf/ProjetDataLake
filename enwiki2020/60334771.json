While Shrenu keeps the intrigue alive with her antics in the show, Zain\u2019s character, Kabir, also manages to add to all the drama right before the episode ends.\u201d Bollywood Life said, \u201cVeterans like Ayub Khan and Parikshit Sahani bring out a classy performance and Shrenu Parikh matches them well proving that she knows her craft well. The lavish sets lend to the neat storytelling which takes off from establishing each character for what they are, to showing the central character's relationship with each one of them. Shrenu is fantastic with her transitions in expressions.\u201d The Times of India stated, \"Ek Bhram \u2013 Sarvagun Sampanna will keep you hooked to the show with Janhvi\u2019s mysterious unsettled scores.\" India Today said, \u201cShrenu Parikh is quite convincing as Jhanvi, who can deceive anyone with her perfect bahu act. Ayub Khan fits well into the role of a strict head of the family. Ek Bhram Sarvagun Sampanna looks promising and will keep the viewers hooked with its interesting twists and turns.\u201d ==Production== ===Development=== The show was launched in a 1000-year-old heritage called Saas\u2013Bahu temple located in Udaipur, Rajasthan. The initial sequences of the series was inspired from real life incidents of a highly influential Indian family whom the makers maintained confidential. Because of this, they received threat phone calls from some of the families fearing threat to their identity. In June 2019, the show went through a revamp in its storyline to increase the garnering very low ratings due to which actors Ayub Khan and Tanvi Dogra who played PK Mittal and Kavya Mittal had to exit the show. Speaking about it producer Dipti Kalwani said, \u201cThe show is going in for a revamp with the existing cast. Actors are not quitting and will be brought back soon.\u201d ===Cancellation=== Despite the revamp in June 2019, it could not be able to get expected ratings and thus the shoot of the series concluded on 5 September 2019 with the series airing its last episode on 20 September 2019. ==References== Category:2019 Indian television series debuts Category:Hindi-language television shows Category:Indian thriller television series Category:Indian drama television series Category:Star Plus original programming ",
