    "text": "Palestinian Kurds, (, : Akrad Filisteen), are Palestinians who are of Kurdish ancestry. The origins of majority of Palestinian Kurds is traced to the era of conquests of Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty during the crusades. The Ayyubid rulers settled many Kurdish tribes in Palestine in order to secure the borders of their empire. Among the major Kurdish settlements in Palestine are city of Hebron (al-Khalil), Jerusalem (al-Quds) and Shechem (Nablus). It is estimated that as much as one third of inhabitants of Hebron are of Kurdish origin where they have had their own quarters, named after them such as Harat al-Akrad (quarter of the Kurds).

Note to editors. This account, always in Moshe Gil, refers to two distinct events, the Arab conquest from Byzantium, and the Kurdish-Arab conquest from Crusaders. In both the manuscript is a monkish chronicle, and the words used, and event described is identical. We may have a secondary source confusion here. The name of the city was changed back to Al-Khalil. A Kurdish quarter still existed in the town during the early period of Ottoman rule.. Richard the Lionheart retook the city soon after. Richard of Cornwall, brought from England to settle the dangerous feuding between Templars and Hospitallers, whose rivalry imperiled the treaty guaranteeing regional stability stipulated with the Egyptian Sultan As-Salih Ayyub, managed to impose peace on the area. But soon after his departure, feuding broke out and in 1241 the Templars mounted a damaging raid on what was, by now, Muslim Hebron, in violation of agreements. ==Kurds in Hebron== Kurds in Hebron refers to Palestinians of Kurdish origin who settled in Hebron in the Ayyubid and self-identify today as Palestinians of Kurdish origin.
