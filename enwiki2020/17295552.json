The sixteen teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played best-of-seven series for conference quarter-finals, semi-finals and championships, and then the conference champions played a best-of-seven series for the Stanley Cup. This was the last time all four former WHA teams made the playoffs in the same year until 2020. Despite his team being eliminated before the Stanley Cup Finals, Colorado Avalanche forward Peter Forsberg's postseason scoring totals, with 24 points in 19 games, were not surpassed for the rest of the 1999 playoffs. This made him the first player to lead all playoff scorers despite not making the finals since the 1986 playoffs where Doug Gilmour and Bernie Federko each tallied 21 points in 19 postseason games for St. Louis who was also eliminated in the conference finals. The playoffs ended on June 19, 1999, with the Dallas Stars defeating the Buffalo Sabres to win their first Stanley Cup championship in their history. Brett Hull scored the controversial triple overtime goal in game six for Dallas, while Joe Nieuwendyk was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.
