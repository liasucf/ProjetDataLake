    "text": "Hawkins Battery is a former coastal artillery battery, built to defend the Royal Naval Dockyard at Devonport. The battery was originally built between 1888 and 1892 to mount four 9-inch Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) guns on high angle mountings, which were all mounted.The National Archives WO196/31, Ports and harbours Western District: Revision of Coast defence armaments prior to June 1894 These guns could provide high angle, plunging fire onto more lightly armoured decks of enemy warships attempting to enter Plymouth Sound. The battery is enclosed by concrete walls, with three small caponiers, built like pill boxes to provide enfilading fire along the ditches. The gun positions were served by underground magazines. The battery was built with caretaker's accommodation and crew shelters for the gun detachments who would man the battery in time of war.The National Archives WO78/5068, Plymouth and Falmouth area. Hawkins Battery: plans, sections, etc. 1905-1913 The battery was upgraded with newer armament after 1910 when the battery was re-modelled for two 9.2-inch Breech Loading (BL) high angle fire guns. These remained in place until 1922 when they were dismounted. The battery was used for further military purposes during the Second World War, but was sold by the War Office in 1959.The National Archives WO192/120, Fort Record Books, Southern Command.
