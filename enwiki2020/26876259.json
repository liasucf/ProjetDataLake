It also stars Balachandra Menon, Nedumudi Venu, etc. The film contains evergreen love songs which are still topping charts. ==Plot== Sumalatha plays the title role of Isabella, a tour guide, who falls in love with Unnikrishnan (Balachandra Menon), one of her customers. Unni has spent all his Singapore earned wealth for the wellbeing of his sister and family and a bachelor even in his 40s. She has several family problems as her father (Alby) is dead, her mother (Maggy) has become a drunkard and her brother (Tony) is autistic. She has to be the sole breadwinner of her family. Nedumudi Venu was her mentor and well-wisher, who introduced her to Unnikrishnan. After that season, Unni returned to his residence and Isabella, whom he called affectionately Bella, awaited for his return. He returned on several seasons, but each time he refused to accept her as his life-partner. Terribly disappointed by his family's money-centric behaviour, Unnikrishnan decides to spend his remaining life with Bella. But on reaching there, he has a painful surprise waiting for him. Bella, fed up with the agony of solitude, family problems and abandonment, decides to exit from life. Unni knows the saddest news from her mentor, her only well-wisher and Unni picks his crutches once again which he threw away in hope of reunion with Bella, and leaves for his lone journey remaining and visuals fade to scrolling last cards. ==Cast== *Sumalatha as Isabella *Balachandra Menon as Unnikrishna Menon *Nedumudi Venu as a Tourist Guide *Anand Mahadevan as Ananthu *Ajay Menon as the receptionist *Vettukili Prakash as Tony *K.
