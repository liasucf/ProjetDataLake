In 1963\u201365 he and his collaborators created and developed the Vilnius photometric system, a seven-color intermediate band system, optimized for photometric stellar classification. In 1996 he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. Strai\u017eys is an editor of the journal Baltic Astronomy. He is currently working at the Mol\u0117tai Astronomical Observatory. Asteroid 68730 Straizys in 2002 was named after him. ==Education and professional history== In 1959, he graduated from Vilnius University in astrophysics. In 1959\u201362, he was a graduate student of the Institute of Physics and Mathematics of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. In 1962\u201367, he was a scientific researcher at the same institute.
