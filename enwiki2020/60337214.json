    "text": "The Catalonia International Trophy (, ) is an association football friendly tournament organised in Spain by the Catalan Football Federation and which the Catalonia national team plays against another national team. It was created in 2009 and is held annually at the end of December. ==History== Since 1997, the Catalan national team has played an international friendly match nearly every year, coinciding with the Christmas holidays. In 2009, in the context of Catalan aspirations to participate in official FIFA or UEFA competitions, the president of the Catalan Football Federation, Jordi Casals, announced the conversion of friendlies into an annual tournament, named the Catalonia International Trophy. The artist Joan Mora donated a sculpture symbolising the four bars of the Catalan flag as a prize for the winner. On 22 December 2009, the first edition, Johan Cruyff's Catalonia won 4\u20132 against Diego Maradona's Argentina. After that, four more games were held against Honduras, Tunisia, Nigeria and Cape Verde. In 2014 and 2015, centennial challenge matches were played against the Basque Country (also an unofficial national team) with the matches against FIFA teams resuming in 2016 with another meeting with Tunisia. However, no matches were played by Catalonia at Christmas in 2017 or 2018. ==Fixtures and results== ===Fixtures=== ===Results=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Year !Host !Winners !Runners-up |- |2009 |rowspan=\"3\"|Barcelona | | |- |2010 | | |- |2011 | | |- |2012 |Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat | | |- |2013 |Barcelona | | |- |2016 |Girona | | |} ==Records and statistics== Sergio Garc\u00eda is the top scorer in the history of the tournament with 6 goals. ===Results summary=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !Position !Team !Participations ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !Trophies |- |1 |align=\"left\"| |6 |3 |- |2 |align=\"left\"| |2 |2 |- |3 |align=\"left\"| |1 |1 |- |rowspan=3|1 |align=\"left\"| |1 |rowspan=\"3\"|0 |- |align=\"left\"| |1 |- |align=\"left\"| |1 |} ===Table of winners=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Team !Winner !Runner-up |- | |3 (2009, 2010 and 2013) |3 (2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016) |- | |2 (2011 and 2016) | |- | |1 (2012) | |- | | |1 (2009) |- | | |1 (2010) |- | | |1 (2013) |} ===Top goalscorers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !Player !Goals scored |- |1 |align=\"left\"| Sergio Garc\u00eda |6 |- |2 |align=\"left\"| Bojan |4 |- |3 |align=\"left\"| Youssef Msakni |3 |- |4 |align=\"left\"| Sergio |2 |- |5 | |1 |} ==See also== *Centenary Trophy ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== ==External links== * Category:2009 establishments in Catalonia Category:2009 establishments in Spain Category:Annual sporting events Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2009 Category:Catalan football friendly trophies Category:Spanish football friendly trophies Category:International association football competitions hosted by Spain Category:Catalonia national football team ",
