On 10 January 2017, Waszczykowski told reporters that, in a bid for a non-permanent seat for Poland on the UN Security Council, he had meetings with officials from various countries, including some Caribbean nations, with some of them \"perhaps for the first time in the history of our diplomacy. For example with countries such as San Escobar or Belize\".\"San Escobar: Polish foreign minister's slip invents a country\", BBCPolish minister mocked over meeting with fictional nation of San Escobar\"Waszczykowski wymy\u015bli\u0142 nowe pa\u0144stwo. \"Spotka\u0142em si\u0119 z ministrem San Escobar\"\"; Quote from Waszczykowski : \"Mamy okazj\u0119 do prawie 20 spotka\u0144 z r\u00f3\u017cnymi ministrami.

The Facebook page was created by Jarek Kubicki, a member of the Razem political party.\"Nie jestem Kijowskim partii Razem\". To on stoi za profilem pa\u0144stwa San Escobar Within a day the hashtag #SanEscobar was tracked by over 2 million people and has become the most popular within the Polish segment of Twitter. San Escobar has also become a subject of numerous joke news, e.g. about an appointment of a military attach\u00e9 and its nice ecology. A good deal of them play upon drug lord Pablo Escobar, popularized via the TV series Narcos. A Twitter account for 'Rep\u00fablica Popular Democr\u00e1tica de San Escobar' () was established, which quickly rose to prominence. It announced full support for Waszczykowski in his endeavor, and proceeded to issuing various news releases in Spanish and English, including a reproach towards Saint Kitts and Nevis: the correction of the Polish spokeswoman was interpreted as an attempt to foil Poland--San Escobar relations. San Escobar issues a newspaper, San Escobar Times (also on Twitter). San Escobar has also become a popular travel destination via El Ni\u00f1o Airlines. For a while the phrase \"Maybe I better drop it all and fly to San Escobar?\" has become very popular (Polish: \u201eA mo\u017ce rzuci\u0107 to wszystko i polecie\u0107 do San Escobar?\u201d, a play with the Polish saying \"A mo\u017ce rzuci\u0107 to wszystko i wyjecha\u0107 w Bieszczady\"). Ticketing service Fru wrote that there are only one-way tickets to San Escobar. Netflix (the creator of Narcos) also allegedly claimed it already has airline tickets to sell.
