    "text": "Magnolia is the second largest neighborhood of Seattle, Washington by area. It occupies a hilly peninsula northwest of downtown. Magnolia has been a part of the city since 1891. A good portion of the peninsula is taken up by Discovery Park, formerly the U.S. Army's Fort Lawton. Magnolia is isolated from the rest of Seattle, connected by road to the rest of the city by only three bridges over the tracks of the BNSF Railway: W. Emerson Place in the north, W. Dravus Street in the center, and W. Garfield Street (the Magnolia Bridge) in the south \u2014 the Salmon Bay Bridge to Ballard is rail-only, no motorized traffic is permitted to cross the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, and the W. Fort Street bridge over the railroad tracks only affords access to the W. Commodore Way industrial area (traffic to the rest of the city from that area still needs to take the W. Emerson Place bridge.) ==Boundaries== Magnolia is bounded on the north by Salmon Bay and Shilshole Bay of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, across which is Ballard; on the west by Puget Sound and Elliott Bay; on the south by Elliott Bay and Smith Cove; and on the east by the BNSF Railway and the Port of Seattle's Terminal 91, beyond which is Interbay. Although magnolia trees do line W. McGraw Street in the neighborhood's commercial district, Magnolia's naming was actually a misnomer. It was named by Captain George Davidson of the U.S. Coast Survey in 1856, who reportedly mistook the plentiful madrona trees for magnolias.Meany, Edmond S., Origins of Washington Historical Names, Seattle: Univ of Washington Press, 1923, p. 157; Phillips, James W. Washington State Place Names, Seattle: Univ of Washington Press, 1971 Groups are actively working to save the remaining madronas on the bluff. On Magnolia's south end is Magnolia Park, overlooking Puget Sound, Mount Rainier, and the city skyline. It features a picnic area and tennis courts across the street. Also in Magnolia are Smith Cove and its marina. Discovery Park, in the northwest, encompasses and is Seattle's largest park. The park is home to eagles, herons, falcons, and beavers. Seven miles of trails provide visitors with a wilderness experience and views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. Parts of Fort Lawton, such as the officer's homes and other historic buildings, remain in the park. Discovery Park has extensive beaches wrapping around West Point, the westernmost point in Seattle, and West Point hosts a lighthouse which guides ships into Seattle's harbour, Elliott Bay. Adjacent to Discovery Park is West Point, featuring the West Point Lighthouse, which was built in 1881 and is the oldest lighthouse in the area. Walking trails descend from the park to two miles (3 km) of beach and the lighthouse. West Point also contains one of Seattle's sewage treatment facilities, and several archaeological sites. ==Highlights== Another highlight is the local branch of the Seattle Public Library, designed in 1964 by architects Paul Hayden Kirk and Richard Haag, who won top awards for design from the American Library Association. In the children's section is a statue of a young girl titled \"Girl Holding Doves,\" designed by Ebba Rapp McLauchlan. Outside hangs a bronze wall sculpture titled \"Activity of Thought,\" an abstract piece of art designed especially for the library by Glenn Alps. The library is furnished with solid walnut tables and chairs custom designed by George Nakashima. Magnolia's business district, called \"the Village\" by locals, is home to many specialty stores and professional services, some of Seattle's top restaurants, and industrial and marine services. In the summer, there is a farmers market held on Saturdays in the Magnolia Village. There are three Seattle Public Schools in Magnolia: Lawton Elementary, Magnolia Elementary, and Catherine Blaine K-8. ==Neighborhoods== According to the Seattle City Clerk's office, Magnolia comprises three neighborhoods (see map): *Lawton Park \u2013 The northern half of Magnolia *Briarcliff \u2013 The southwestern quarter of Magnolia *Southeast Magnolia \u2013 The southeastern quarter of Magnolia File:Seattle - Magnolia map.jpg|Map of Magnolia Image:BNSFtracks-kiwanisravine-seattle.jpg|BNSF Railway tracks just north of Kiwanis Ravine File:Magnolia Park, Washington - tree and bench.jpg|Park in Magnolia ==Demographics== As of the census of 2000, there were 19,156 people, 9,077 households, and 4,828 families residing in the neighborhood.
