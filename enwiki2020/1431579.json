His parents were Peder Larsson (1755\u20131841) and Inger Sjursdotter (1744\u20131814). Cleng Peerson grew up on the farm Hesthammar in Tysv\u00e6r, but was born on the farm Lervik in the same district. In 1821, he first traveled to the United States at the request of a religious community in Stavanger. This community was made up principally of Quakers, together with Haugeans, both groups having been influenced by the beliefs of German Rappites.Haugeans, Rappites, and the Emigration of 1825 (by Ingrid Semmingsen, translated by C. A. Clausen. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 29: Page 3) ==Immigration== In 1824, when Peerson came back to Norway, it was decided that a group should emigrate. Peerson returned to America to prepare for their arrival. Cleng Peerson met the immigrants when they landed in New York on October 9, 1825. They moved to northern New York, settling about northwest of Rochester in the town of Kendall, near Lake Ontario, in Orleans County. The road that ran through this settlement is today known as Norway Road.The Norwegian Quakers of 1825 (Henry J. Cadbury, Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume I: Page 60)The Kendall Settlement Survived (Richard L. Canuteson, Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 27: Page 243) In 1834, Cleng Peerson led a group of settlers to a little settlement on the Illinois River, in the Fox River Valley. The community of Norway in LaSalle County, Illinois is the site of the Norwegian Settlers Memorial which was dedicated in 1934.Norwegian Settlers Memorial (Illinois Historic Preservation Agency) Starting in 1838, Peerson returned to Norway several times. By 1840, Peerson had settled in Sugar Creek in Montrose Township, Lee County in the southeastern part of Iowa. Cleng Peerson was listed in the United States census records as a settler in 1840. He lived here for several years, including the period 1840\u201347. In 1847, he joined the Swedish immigrant society at Bishop Hill Colony in Henry County, Illinois, which had been founded by sect leader Erik Janson.The Sugar Creek Settlement in Iowa (H. F. Swansen. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume IX: Page 38) During 1854, the Texas State Legislature granted Peerson of land west of Clifton, in Bosque County, Texas. Peerson lived here until his death in 1865 and was buried in the cemetery by Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Cranfills Gap.

He later married Maria Charlotta Dahlgren (1809 \u2013 ca. 1849) who had emigrated from Sweden in 1846. ==Legacy== *In 1947 and 1975, Cleng Peerson was featured on Norwegian postage stamps. *During 1982, King Olav V of Norway visited Texas in recognition of the 200th anniversary of the birth of Cleng Peerson.The Handbook of Texas (Published by the Texas State Historical Association) *Cleng Peerson Research Library and Cleng Peerson Institute are both located in Clifton, Texas. *Tysv\u00e6r municipality has announced plans for the Cleng Peerson Center. ==Primary Source== The True Saga Of Cleng Peerson by historian Alfred Hauge (translated by John Weinstock and Turid Sverre. foreword by Carl W.
