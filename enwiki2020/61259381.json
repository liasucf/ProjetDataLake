    "text": "Lel and Polel (Latin: Leli, Poleli) are Polish divine twins, first mentioned by Maciej Miechowita in the 16th century where he presents them as equivalents of Castor and Pollux and the sons of the goddess \u0141ada, the equivalent of Leda. There is no complete agreement about the authenticity of the cult of Lel and Polel. == Sources == Lel and Polel were first mentioned in the Chronica Polonorum by Maciej Miechowita where he is correcting Jan D\u0142ugosz who wrote that \u0141ada was Polish equivalent of Roman god of war Mars: Marcin Kromer, Maciej Stryjkowski, Marcin Bielski and his son Joachim also mention the twins. Alessandro Guagnini claimed that the cult of Lel and Polel existed during his lifetime in Greater Poland. The priest Jakub Wujek also mentions \"Lelipoleli\". == Research == Initially, the authenticity of the gods Lel and Polel was not denied, as evidenced by their popularity among major Polish writers such as Ignacy Krasicki, Juliusz S\u0142owacki and Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski. Aleksander Br\u00fcckner, who was one of the first researchers to tackle the topic of the Polish pantheon, categorically rejected the authenticity of Lel and Polel. He believed that the cry \u0141ada, \u0141ada, Ilela and Leli Poleli cited by Miechowita was in fact only a drinking song, an exclamation similar to tere-fere or fistum-pofistum, and the alleged names were derived from the word lela\u0107 \"to sway\". Despite Br\u00fcckner's significant achievements, many modern researchers accuse him of a hypercritical or even pseudoscientific approach to the subject of the Polish pantheon. The attitude towards the cult of Lel and Polel changed in 1969 when two cult figures of oak tree dating from the 11th or 12th century were discovered on the island of Fischerinsel on the Tollensesee in Mecklenburg. One of them is 178 cm high and presents two male figures with a moustache, in headgear (helmets?), which are fused with heads and torsos. The second primitive representation, which is 157 cm high, shows a female figure with clearly outlined breasts. Some researchers allege that these idols depict Lel and Polel and their mother \u0141ada. Following the abandonment of Br\u00fcckner's hypercritical attitude and the discovery of twin figures on the island of Fischerinsel, modern researchers are more confident about the authenticity of their cult. Against the origin of the names from drinking songs are testified by Karol Potka\u0144ski the own names Lel and Lal and the Russian song Lelij, Lelij, Lelij zelenyj and my Lado! where the first word may be associated with the dialectal Russian word lelek, which meant a \"strong, healthy youth\". Vodit\u044c leli is a women's pageant to honour young married women that shows the original ritual and mythical connotations, which after several centuries could have become drunken chants. From the 17th century, the term lelum polelum in the sense of \"slow, sluggish\" was recorded, which may have been the result of desacralization. According to Andrzej Szyjewski, Lelum and Polelum could have been zodiacal twins, and in the opinion Alexander Gieysztor they brought happiness, which may be reflected in faith in the magical power of a double ear [of grain]. However, according to Grzegorz Niedzielski, Lel and Polel are the invention of Miechowita and the Slavic twin brothers were to be \u0141ada and Leli, where \u0141ada was the fire god and the remains of the divine twins is the legend of Walig\u00f3ra and Wyrwid\u0105b. == Lel and Polel in culture == === Literature === * Janusz Christa: Kajko and Kokosz (\"Lelum polelum\" is a favorite saying of Breakbone) * Ignacy Krasicki: Myszeis.
