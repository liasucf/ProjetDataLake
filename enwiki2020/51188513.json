    "text": "The 11th World Scout Jamboree Memorial Rotonda, also known as the Boy Scout Circle, is a roundabout in Quezon City, Metro Manila, the Philippines. Located at the intersection between Timog and Tomas Morato Avenues, it serves as the boundary between Barangays South Triangle, Laging Handa and Sacred Heart. A monument stands in the middle of the roundabout which commemorates the members of the ill-fated Philippine contingent to the 11th World Scout Jamboree that was among the casualties of the United Arab Airlines Flight 869 crash of 1963. The monument consists of a circular pedestal with bronze statues positioned around the structure, in the likenesses of the 24 members of the Philippine delegation (22 Boy Scouts, 2 veteran Scouters, and 2 chaperons). In 2007, the Quezon City government performed a renovation on the monument that included the addition of an obelisk on top of the structure honoring Tom\u00e1s Morat\u00f3, the first mayor of Quezon City and the one after whom Tomas Morato Avenue is named. ==Tragedy== Flags at the Jamboree were placed at half-mast in mourning after the bulk of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines contingent died in the crash of United Arab Airlines Flight 869 (1963) at 0150 hours on 28 July 1963, in the Arabian Sea nine nautical miles from Madh Island, Bombay (now Mumbai), India. One Scout from the Agusan Council, Alex Kwan, completed the pre- jamboree training and was scheduled to attend, but was told days before the departure date that he would not be able to attend because of problems securing a passport. Nevertheless, the BSP sent a token delegation of three ScoutsNicasio Fernandez, Guillermo Flores, and Lu\u00eds Santiago. to Marathon some days after the crash, in addition to several BSP officialsP&CS; Gabri\u00e9l A. Daza, VP Hermenegildo B. Reyes, VP Jos\u00e9 Plarid\u00e9l A. Silvestre, NSE Godofredo Palencia Neric, Vicente F. Delf\u00edn, Migu\u00e9l Gatusl\u00e1o, Benjam\u00edn C. Limso, Pedro I. Malonda, Loreto Vallora, and Fernando S. Vinzons. who had arrived in Greece ahead of the accident. On behalf of the parents of the Scouts, Antonio C. Delgado, father of Scout Jose Antonio Delgado (and later Chairman of the World Scout Conference, 1971-1973), gave a response during the state memorial service weeks after the crash: \"For this is the other side of the coin of grief. The glory. The honor. The triumph... In the forefront of these boy's minds were always held as shining goals the noble ideals of the Scout Oath: 'honor... duty... God... Country.' These boys kept their honor; and they kept the faith; and they gave their all for their country... and I am sure they kept themselves in the friendship of God.\" ==Surrounding buildings and structures== The monument and some surrounding structures. The area around the 11th World Scout Jamboree Memorial Rotonda is largely made up of dining and entertainment establishments. Tomas Morato Avenue is known for its large variety of restaurants, concentrated along the stretch to the southwest of the roundabout, while near the northeast corner was the site of the 1996 Ozone Disco Club fire. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Quezon City Category:Scouting in the Philippines Category:Monuments and memorials in Metro Manila Category:Roundabouts and traffic circles in the Philippines Category:Scouting monuments and memorials ",
