    "text": "Aspergillus olivicola is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus. It is from the Nidulantes section. The species was first described in 2008.Zalar, P.; Frisvad, J.C.; Gunde-Cimerman, N.; Varga, J.; Samson, R.A. 2008. Four new species of Emericella from the Mediterranean region of Europe. Mycologia. 100(5):779-795 It has been isolated from fruit in Italy. A. olivicola has been shown to produce aflatoxin B1, emericellin, shamixanthone, siderin, sterigmatocystin, terrain, and varitriol.Zalar P, Frisvad JC, Gunde-Cimerman N, et al. (2008). Four new species of Emericella from the Mediterranean region of Europe. Mycologia 100: 779 \u2013 795. In 2016, the genome of A. olivicola was sequenced as a part of the Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project - a project dedicated to performing whole-genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Aspoli1_1/Aspoli1_1.home.html The genome assembly size was 33.17 Mbp. ==Growth and morphology== Aspergillus olivicola has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid\u00ae (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below.
