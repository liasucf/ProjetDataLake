    "text": "Countess Palatine Maria Francisca of Sulzbach (Maria Franziska, Pfalzgr\u00e4fin von Sulzbach; 15 June 1724 - 15 November 1794), was a Countess Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken-Birkenfeld by marriage to Frederick Michael, Count Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken-Birkenfeld. Born in Schwetzingen, she was the fifth child of Joseph Karl, Count Palatine of Sulzbach and Countess Palatine Elizabeth Auguste Sophie of Neuburg. From her six siblings, only she and two older sisters survive adulthood: Elisabeth Auguste and Maria Anna. ==Life== Her father was the designated successor both of his own father Theodore Eustace, Count Palatine of Sulzbach and of his father-in-law Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine, but he never took possession of his inheritance due to his early death in 1729. Maria Franziska's older sister Elisabeth Auguste later married the next heir of the Palatinate Electorate, Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. After the death of Charles Theodore in February 1799 without surviving legitimate offspring, the Palatinate and Bavaria were inherited by Maria Franziska's youngest son Maximilian IV Joseph (later King Maximilian I of Bavaria); thus, Maria Franziska became the ancestor of all the Bavarian Kings until 1918 and the still living royal branch of the Wittelbachs. On 6 February 1746, Maria Franziska married Frederick Michael, Count Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken-Birkenfeld. From 1760, after having given birth to five children, the relationship with her husband began to deteriorate. According to herself she was seduced \"by the bad example of the court\", and began an affair with an actor from Mannheim. When she became pregnant, Maria Franziska was banished from the court. In Strasbourg she gave birth to a son. She was then confined to a semi-detention in a series of monasteries, firstly at the Ursuline in Metz and then to the Augustinians of Bonnevoie in the Duchy of Luxembourg. After the death of her husband in 1767, she was allowed to return to Sulzbach Castle. Maria Franziska died in Sulzbach and was buried in the local parish church. Her heart was buried separately and since 1983 was located in the Shrine of Our Lady of Alt\u00f6tting. ==Issue== {| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" |- bgcolor=Lavender !Name!!Portrait!!Birth!!Death!!Notes |- |align=center| Charles II August Duke of Zweibr\u00fccken || 60px ||align=center| 29 October 1746||align=center| 1 April 1795 || align=center| Married in 1774 Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony, no surviving issue. |- |align=center|Klemens August Joseph Friedrich || ||align=center| 18 September 1749 ||align=center| 19 June 1750 ||align=center| Died in infancy. |- |align=center|Maria Amalia Augusta Queen consort of Saxony ||align=center| 60px ||align=center| 10 May 1752 ||align=center| 15 November 1828 ||align=center| Married in 1769 Elector Frederick Augustus III, had issue. |- |align=center|Maria Anna Duchess in Bavaria ||align=center| 60px ||align=center|18 July 1753 ||align=center| 4 February 1824 ||align=center| Married in 1780 Duke Wilhelm in Bavaria, had issue. |- |align=center|Maximilian I King of Bavaria ||align=center| 60px ||align=center|27 May 1756 ||align=center|13 October 1825 ||align=center| Married first in 1785 Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, had issue; married second in 1797 Caroline of Baden, had issue. |} ==Ancestry== ==References== == Bibliography == *Oskar Klausner: Die Familienzweige der pf\u00e4lzischen Wittelsbacher.
