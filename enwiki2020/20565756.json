    "text": "For administrative purposes, the Boy Scouts of America is divided into four regions\u2014Western, Central, Southern, and Northeast. Each region is then subdivided into areas. Western Region covers all of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and parts of Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Texas, as well as the countries of Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Each region has a volunteer president, assisted by volunteer officers and board members, and the day-to-day work of Scouting is managed by the regional director, assistant and associate regional directors, and area directors. Regions and areas are subdivisions of the National Council and do not have a corporate status separate from the BSA. ==Councils== ===Area I=== * Ore-Ida Council * Midnight Sun Council * Great Alaska Council * Crater Lake Council * Oregon Trail Council * Cascade Pacific Council * Mount Baker Council * Blue Mountain Council * Chief Seattle Council * Inland Northwest Council * Pacific Harbors Council * Grand Columbia Council ===Area II=== *Grand Teton Council *Snake River Council *Trapper Trails Council *Utah National Parks Council *Great Salt Lake Council * Black Hills Area Council * Greater Wyoming Council * Denver Area Council * Longs Peak Council * Montana Council * Pikes Peak Council * Rocky Mountain Council ===Area III=== * Alameda Council * Sequoia Council * Greater Yosemite Council * Piedmont Council * Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council * Mount Diablo Silverado Council * Marin Council * Golden Empire Council * San Francisco Bay Area Council * Pacific Skyline Council * Nevada Area Council * Redwood Empire Council ===Area IV=== * Southern Sierra Council * Ventura County Council * Orange County Council * Verdugo Hills Council * Long Beach Area Council * Greater Los Angeles Area Council * California Inland Empire Council * Western Los Angeles County Council * Los Padres Council ===Area V=== Merged with Area II ===Area VI=== * Aloha Council * Catalina Council * Conquistador Council * Grand Canyon Council * Great Southwest Council * Las Vegas Area Council * San Diego-Imperial Council * Yucca Council * Far East Council Region XII gateway at the national 1953 National Scout Jamboree ==References== ==External links== * Western Region Venturing * Western Region Order of the Arrow * Western Region, Area 4, Google Map with website, phone and location ",
