    "text": "Winston Mawdsley Graham OBE, born Winston Grime (30 June 1908 \u2013 10 July 2003), was an English novelist best known for the Poldark series of historical novels set in Cornwall, though he also wrote numerous other works, including thrillers, historical novels, short stories, non-fiction and plays. Winston Graham was the author's pseudonym until he changed his name by deed poll from Grime to Graham on 7 May 1947. ==Biography== Graham was born in Victoria Park, Manchester, on 30 June 1908. As a child, Winston contracted pneumonia, and on medical advice was educated at a local day school rather than Manchester Grammar School which his father had in mind for him. Graham's father, Albert Grime, was a prosperous tea importer and grocer, but became incapacitated by a stroke. When he was 17 years old, Winston moved to Perranporth, Cornwall, where he lived for 34 years. He had wanted to be a writer from an early age and, following the death of his father, he was supported by his mother while he wrote novels at home in longhand and attempted to get them published. In September 1939, Graham married Jean Williamson, having first met her in 1926 when she was 13 years old. She often helped Graham with ideas for his books, and the character of Demelza, in his Poldark series, was based in part on her. Graham's daughter said, \u201cFather was the author but my mother helped with the details because she was very observant. She saw everything and remembered it all.\" Jean died in 1992. During his youth, Graham was a keen tennis player and recorded in his diaries how many sets he played each day. He lived in Perranporth from October 1925 until January 1960, then briefly, during the summer of 1960, in the south of France before finally settling in East Sussex. He was a member of the Society of Authors from 1945, chairman of the Society's Management Committee from 1967 to 1969 and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 1983, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Graham died on 10 July 2003 at the age of 95, at his house, Abbotswood, East Sussex. His autobiography, Memoirs of a Private Man, was published in September of that year. ==Remembrances and legacy== The Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro, Cornwall had an exhibition devoted to his life and works (Poldark's Cornwall: The Life and Times of Winston Graham) from mid-June to mid-September 2008 to celebrate the centenary of his birth, coinciding with re-publication of the Poldark novels by Pan Macmillan. Additionally, the Winston Graham Historical Prize was initiated as part of the Centenary Celebrations, funded by a legacy from the author and supported by Pan Macmillan. It is awarded for a work of unpublished fiction, preferably with an association with Cornwall. Details can be obtained from the Royal Cornwall Museum. The majority of Winston Graham's manuscripts and papers have been donated to the Royal Institution of Cornwall by his son Andrew Graham and daughter Rosamund Barteau. Further papers are housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University and elsewhere. ==Literary career== First Edition UK cover of Graham's 1961 novel Marnie Graham's first novel The House with the Stained Glass Windows was published in 1934. His first Poldark novel, Ross Poldark, was published in 1945 and was succeeded by 11 further titles, the last of which, Bella Poldark, was published in 2002. The series was set in Cornwall, especially in and near Perranporth where Graham lived for more than three decades (1925\u20131960). In the 1941 spy thriller Night Journey, set mostly in Mussolini's Italy, the protagonist feels that Britain was likely to lose the war but is determined to go on fighting against all the odds - which was likely Graham's own feeling at the time. Graham was also an accomplished author of suspense novels and, during the course of his life, wrote 30 novels (in addition to the 12 Poldark books) as well as a volume of short stories (The Japanese Girl, 1971) and three non-fiction works. Other than the Poldark novels, Graham's most successful works were Marnie, a suspense thriller published in 1961 and The Walking Stick, published in 1967. In 1955, Graham's novel The Little Walls won the Crime Writers' Association's first Crime Novel of the Year Award (then called The Crossed Red Herrings Award, later The Gold Dagger). In 1972 Graham published \"The Spanish Armadas\", a factual account of the sixteenth-century Anglo-Spanish conflict. (The plural \"Armadas\" refers to a lesser-known second attempt by Philip II of Spain to conquer England in 1598, which Graham argued was better planned and organised than the famous one of 1588, but was foiled by a fierce storm scattering the Spanish ships and sinking many of them.) The same is also the subject of a historical novel, The Grove of Eagles, set in Elizabethan Cornwall and also depicting the foundation and growth of Falmouth. Graham wrote at least four plays, three of which - Seven Suspected, Values and Shadow Play (renamed Circumstantial Evidence) - were produced, with the latter professionally produced at Salisbury in 1978 and at Guildford, Richmond and Brighton in 1979. According to Graham, it \"missed London by a hair\". Seven Suspected was first performed in Perranporth on 30 May 1933 with both the author and his wife-to- be Jean in the cast. Values was a one-act play performed by seven members of Perranporth Women's Institute at a Truro drama festival in 1936. Graham's books have been translated into 29 languages. His autobiography Memoirs of a Private Man was published by Macmillan in September 2003, two months after his death. ==Television and film adaptations of works== The first seven Poldark novels were adapted as a BBC television series broadcast in the UK between 1975 and 1977, which garnered audiences of about 14 million viewers. The series was so successful that some vicars rescheduled or cancelled church services rather than have them clash with the broadcast of Poldark episodes. Graham disliked early episodes of Poldark so much (because of the portrayal of Demelza as promiscuous and 'loose') that he tried to have the series cancelled, but could do nothing about it. The Poldark novels have been adapted for television on two other occasions. Graham's novel Marnie (1961), a thriller, was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1964, with Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery in the lead roles. Marnie (1961) was also adapted as a play by Sean O'Connor in 2001 and an opera written by Nico Muhly which premiered in November, 2017. Both the play and the opera retained the novel's British setting and bleak ending. Five of Graham's other books have been filmed: * Take My Life (1947 film co-scripted by Graham and subsequently novelised) *Night Without Stars (1951 film, scripted by Graham, based on the 1950 novel), *Fortune Is a Woman (1957 film released in the United States as She Played With Fire; based on the 1952 book Fortune Is a Woman), *S\u00f3cio de Alcova (1962 Brazil) / Carnival of Crime (1964 US), based on the book The Sleeping Partner (1956). * The Walking Stick (1970 film based on the 1967 novel). ==Bibliography== ===Poldark novels=== * 1945 \u2013 Ross Poldark (original U.S. title: The Renegade)Ballantine edition (1977), * 1946 \u2013 Demelza * 1950 \u2013 Jeremy Poldark (original U.S. title: Venture Once More)Ballantine edition (1977), * 1953 \u2013 Warleggan (original U.S. title: The Last Gamble)Ballantine edition (1977), * 1973 \u2013 The Black Moon * 1976 \u2013 The Four Swans * 1977 \u2013 The Angry Tide * 1981 \u2013 The Stranger from the Sea * 1982 \u2013 The Miller's Dance * 1984 \u2013 The Loving Cup * 1990 \u2013 The Twisted Sword * 2002 \u2013 Bella Poldark * 1983 \u2013 Poldark's Cornwall (non-fiction) ===Other works=== * 1934 \u2013 The House with the Stained Glass Windows * 1935 \u2013 Into the Fog * 1935 \u2013 The Riddle of John Rowe * 1936 \u2013 Without Motive * 1937 \u2013 The Dangerous Pawn * 1938 \u2013 The Giant's Chair (revised edition, 1975, as Woman in the Mirror) * 1939 \u2013 Keys of Chance * 1939 \u2013 Strangers Meeting * 1940 \u2013 No Exit * 1941 \u2013 Night Journey (revised edition, 1966) * 1942 \u2013 My Turn Next (revised edition, 1988, as Cameo) * 1944 \u2013 The Merciless Ladies (revised edition, 1979) * 1945 \u2013 The Forgotten Story * 1947 \u2013 Take My Life * 1949 \u2013 Cordelia * 1950 \u2013 Night Without Stars * 1952 \u2013 Fortune Is a Woman * 1955 \u2013 The Little Walls (Gold Dagger Award) * 1956 \u2013 The Sleeping Partner (filmed as S\u00f3cio de Alcova/Carnival of Crime) * 1957 \u2013 Greek Fire * 1959 \u2013 The Tumbled House * 1961 \u2013 Marnie * 1963 \u2013 The Grove of Eagles * 1965 \u2013 After the Act * 1967 \u2013 The Walking Stick * 1970 \u2013 Angell, Pearl and Little God * 1971 \u2013 The Japanese Girl (short stories) * 1972 \u2013 The Spanish Armadas (non-fiction) * 1986 \u2013 The Green Flash * 1992 \u2013 Stephanie * 1995 \u2013 Tremor * 1998 \u2013 The Ugly Sister * 2003 \u2013 Memoirs of a Private Man (autobiography; posthumous) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1908 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Cornish writers Category:English Anglicans Category:English historical novelists Category:English memoirists Category:English thriller writers Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature Category:English male novelists Category:20th-century English novelists Category:20th-century British male writers Category:English male non-fiction writers Category:Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period Category:Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age ",
