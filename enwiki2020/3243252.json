The Black Rock Yacht Club is on the little headland left of the image Black Rock Yacht Club is a Yacht club for off-the-beach sailing boats (mostly dinghies) on the shores of Port Phillip Bay, seventeen kilometres south of Melbourne, Australia. The club was founded in 1904 and has a proud history of Olympic, world and Australian champions. Classes sailed include International 14, Sabre, 125, 420, Moth, Sabot, Optimist, Minnow, and Australian Lightweight Sharpie. In 1926 the nineteenth century warship HMVS Cerberus was scuttled to form a breakwater in front of the club and as a result launching is quite easy in most wind conditions. Recently Black Rock Yacht Club hosted the Moth World Championships (2004\u201305 ) and the International 14 Worlds in 1999. The fleet of International 14s sailing out of Black Rock is particularly strong and 2005 World Champion Lindsay Irwin is a BRYC member. ==External links== * Category:Yacht clubs in Victoria (Australia) Category:Sporting clubs in Melbourne Category:1904 establishments in Australia Category:Sports clubs established in 1904 ",
