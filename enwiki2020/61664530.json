The ground's first Test saw South Africa played the touring England cricket team. It hosted its first One Day International (ODI) in 1992 following the readmission of South Africa to international cricket after the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era, and its first Twenty20 International (T20I) in 2007.Kingsmead, CricInfo.
