G\u00edallchad took power after killing his predecessor, and the son of his grandfather's killer, Elim Olf\u00ednechta, in the battle of Comair Tr\u00ed nUisce. He is said to have taken one out of every five men of Munster hostage. G\u00edallchad reigned for nine years, before being killed by Elim's son Art Imlech at Mag Muaide.
