He studied civil law and canon law at Leuven University, graduating doctor of both laws and in 1544 becoming professor of civil law. In 1557 he was appointed to the Great Council of Mechelen, the highest law court in the Habsburg Netherlands.Baron Kervyn de Volkaersbeke, \"Drieux (Remi)\", in Biographie nationale de Belgique, vol. 6 (Brussels, 1878), 170-172. ==Episcopal career== In 1560 Drieux was named first bishop of the newly founded diocese of Leeuwarden, his appointment confirmed in 1561.
