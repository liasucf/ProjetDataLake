    "text": "In linguistics, abessive (abbreviated or ), caritive and privative (abbreviated ) is the grammatical case expressing the lack or absence of the marked noun. In English, the corresponding function is expressed by the preposition without or by the suffix -less. The name abessive is derived from Latin abesse \"to be away/absent\", and is especially used in reference to Uralic languages. The name caritive is derived from Latin carere \"to lack\", and is especially used in reference to Caucasian languages. The name privative is derived from Latin privare \"to deprive\". ==In Afro-Asiatic languages== ===Somali=== In the Somali language, the abessive case is marked by -laa or -la and dropping all but the first syllable on certain words. For example: :jeceylaa \"love\" :jeelaa \"loveless\" :dar \"clothes\" :dharla'aan \"clothesless,\" i.e., naked ==In Australian languages== ===Martuthunira=== In Martuthunira, the privative case is formed with two suffixes, -wirriwa and -wirraa. What determines which suffix is used in a given situation is unclear. {| class=\"wikitable\" | Parla-wirraa || nganarna. |- | money-PRIV || 1PL.EX |- |colspan=\"2\"| We've got no money. |} ==In Uralic languages== ===Finnish=== In the Finnish language, the abessive case is marked by -tta for back vowels and -tt\u00e4 for front vowels according to vowel harmony. For example: :raha \"money\" :rahatta \"without money\" An equivalent construction exists using the word ilman and the partitive: :ilman rahaa \"without money\" or, less commonly: :rahaa ilman \"without money\" The abessive case of nouns is rarely used in writing and even less in speech, although some abessive forms are more common than their equivalent ilman forms: :tuloksetta \"unsuccessfully, fruitlessly\" :Itkin syytt\u00e4. \"I cried for no reason.\" The abessive is, however, commonly used in nominal forms of verbs (formed with the affix -ma- / -m\u00e4-), such as puhu-ma-tta \"without speaking\", osta-ma-tta \"without buying,\" v\u00e4litt\u00e4-m\u00e4-tt\u00e4 \"without caring:\" :Juna j\u00e4i tulematta. \"The train didn't show up.\" This form can often be replaced by using the negative form of the verb: :Juna ei tullut. It is possible to occasionally hear what is considered wrong usage of the abessive in Finnish, where the abessive and ilman forms are combined: :ilman rahatta There is debate as to whether this is interference from Estonian. ===Estonian=== Estonian also uses the abessive, which is marked by -ta in both the singular and the plural: :(ilma) autota \"without a car\" (the preposition ilma \"without\" is optional) Unlike in Finnish, the abessive is commonly used in both written and spoken Estonian. The nominal forms of verbs are marked with the affix -ma- and the abessive marker -ta: :Rong j\u00e4i tulemata. \"The train didn't show up.\" Tallinn has a pair of bars that play on the use of the comitative and abessive, the Nimeta baar Nimeta baar, English page (the nameless bar) and the Nimega baarhttp://www.baarid.ee/en/NimegaBar/programm.php Nimega baar (the bar with a name). ===Skolt Sami=== The abessive marker for nouns in Skolt S\u00e1mi is -t\u00e4\u00e4 or -taa in both the singular and the plural: :Ri\u00e2kkum ve\u00e4\u02b9rt\u00e4\u00e4. \"I cried for no reason.\" The abessive-like non-finite verb form (converb) is -\u01e9\u00e2ni or -kani: :Son vu\u00f5\u02b9lji domoi mainste\u01e9\u00e2ni m\u00f5\u02b9nt le\u00e4i pu\u00e4ttam. \"He/she went home without saying why he/she had come.\" Unlike Finnish, the Skolt S\u00e1mi abessive has no competing expression for lack of an item. ===Inari Sami=== The abessive marker for nouns in Inari S\u00e1mi is -t\u00e1\u00e1. The corresponding non-finite verb form is -h\u00e1nn\u00e1\u00e1, -hinn\u00e1\u00e1 or -henn\u00e1\u00e1. ===Other Sami languages=== The abessive is not used productively in the Western S\u00e1mi languages, although it may occur as a cranberry morpheme. ===Hungarian=== In Hungarian, the abessive case is marked by -talan for back vowels and -telen for front vowels according to vowel harmony. Sometimes, with certain roots, the suffix becomes -tlan or -tlen. For example: :p\u00e9nz \"money\" :p\u00e9nztelen \"without money\" :haza \"home(land)\" :haz\u00e1tlan \"(one) without a homeland\" There is also the postposition n\u00e9lk\u00fcl, which also means without, but is not meant for physical locations. :Cukor n\u00e9lk\u00fcl iszom a te\u00e1t. \"I drink tea without sugar.\" :Testv\u00e9r n\u00e9lk\u00fcl \u00e9ltem. \"I lived without siblings.\" :Elj\u00f6tt\u00e9l Magyarorsz\u00e1gra a testv\u00e9red n\u00e9lk\u00fcl? \"Did you come to Hungary without your sibling?\" ==In Turkic languages== ===Bashkir=== In Bashkir the suffix is -\u04bb\u044b\u0499/-\u04bb\u0435\u0499 (-h\u00ef\u00f0/-h\u012d\u00f0). ===Turkish=== The suffix -siz (variations: -s\u0131z, -suz, -s\u00fcz) is used in Turkish. Ex: evsiz (ev = house, houseless/homeless), barks\u0131z, g\u00f6rg\u00fcs\u00fcz (g\u00f6rg\u00fc = good manners, ill-bred), yurtsuz. ===Azerbaijani=== The same suffix is used in the Azerbaijani language. ===Chuvash=== In Chuvash the suffix is -\u0441\u0102\u0440. ===Kyrgyz=== In Kyrgyz the suffix is -\u0441I\u0437. ==See also== *Essive case *Inessive case *In Russian, Abessive is known as the Caritive (\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0438\u0301\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439), used with the negation of verbs: \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0432\u0434\u044b (not know the truth) \u2013 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0432\u0434\u0443 (know the truth).
