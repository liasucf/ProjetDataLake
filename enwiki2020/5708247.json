While still captained by Johnny Carey and featuring several other players from the 1948 FA Cup winning team, Busby was now giving regular action to young players including Roger Byrne, Johnny Berry and Jackie Blanchflower, and had already invested in the future by making a move for the young goalkeeper Ray Wood. Tottenham Hotspur, the previous season's champions, had to settle for second place this season. Newcastle United retained the FA Cup, the centrepiece of their team being the forward line-up of Jackie Milburn and the Chilean brothers George and Ted Robledo. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:15em\"|Competition!!style=\"width:15em\"|Winner!!style=\"width:15em\"|Runner- up |- |First Division||Manchester United (3)||Tottenham Hotspur |- |Second Division||Sheffield Wednesday||Cardiff City |- |Third Division North||Lincoln City||Grimsby Town |- |Third Division South||Plymouth Argyle||Reading |- |FA Cup||Newcastle United (5)||Arsenal |- |Charity Shield||Tottenham Hotspur||Newcastle United |- |Home Championship||colspan=2|Shared by & |} Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour. * indicates new record for competition ==Football League== ===First Division=== ===Second Division=== ===Third Division North=== ===Third Division South=== ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *George Robledo (Newcastle United) \u2013 33 goals Second Division *Derek Dooley (Sheffield Wednesday) \u2013 46 goals Third Division North *Andy Graver (Lincoln City) \u2013 36 goals Third Division South *Ronnie Blackman (Reading) \u2013 39 goals ==References== ",
