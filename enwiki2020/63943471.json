Each of its 4 days of lectures is usually dedicated to a module, so that every lecture is dedicated to a specific concept and lecturers may have de opportunity to exchange their ideas between them and the audience during the roundtables. The congress is for (bio)medical students who are interested in research. Students may be either presenting or non-presenting participants. If a participant wants to present their research, they are required to submit their abstract beforehand. The congress also offers practical learning opportunities through its workshops and a social program, designed to get to know Lisbon. == Prizes and Awards == The European Medical Students' Association (EMSA) distinguished the 10th AIMS Meeting as \"The Most Innovative Project\" at the Autumn Assembly 2019, held in Athens, Greece from September 1 to September 6 and under the theme \"A medical Curriculum shaped by Medical Students\". The 11th AIMS Meeting has joined the IFMSA (International Federation of Medical Students' Association) Health Systems. The 11th AIMS Meeting has achieved the high patronage of the President of the Portuguese Republic. ==References== == External links == *AIMS Meeting Official Website Category:Academic conferences Category:Congresses ",
