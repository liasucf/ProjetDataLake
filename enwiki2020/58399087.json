The song was produced by record producer Rick Rubin, who the band had previously worked with band in the mid-'90s. It was recorded at the Shangri La recording studio, Malibu, California in early 2018. ==Music video== On September 13, 2018, Corgan announced on his personal Instagram account that production had wrapped on the music video for the song. The video was directed by Corgan himself and produced by long-time Smashing Pumpkins collaborator Linda Strawberry. Fans of the band were recruited as extras for the video. The music video features Mark McGrath of the rock band Sugar Ray playing the role of DJ Jackie Cherry, who has recruited the band to promote a Halloween haunted house charity event. The band must survive the night at the house to win the money for charity. Each member is visited by apparent ghosts and demonic creatures, including members of Drab Majesty, before it is revealed that Corgan is in control of all the preceding events that unfolded. ==Critical reception== Rolling Stone was positive about the track, describing it as having \"bright melodies\" and that it was reminiscent of the band's hit single \"1979\". Uproxx said the song \"finds the band recapturing some of their past glory\" and that Corgan's delivery is \"melodic and accessible\". ==Personnel== Band *Billy Corgan \u2013 vocals, guitar, bass *James Iha \u2013 guitar *Jeff Schroeder \u2013 guitar *Jimmy Chamberlin \u2013 drums Production *Rick Rubin \u2013 production ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:The Smashing Pumpkins songs Category:Song recordings produced by Rick Rubin Category:Songs written by Billy Corgan ",
