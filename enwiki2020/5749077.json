Canisters are required year-round in the Wilderness Area and south of it to the Blue Ridge Parkway. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources *Shining Rock Wilderness at recreation.gov *Shining Rock Wilderness at wilderness.net ==External links== * Webcam View of Cold Mountain, Shining Rock Wilderness * Effects of Future Sulfate and Nitrate Deposition Scenarios on Linville Gorge and Shining Rock Wildernesses United States Department of Agriculture Category:Wilderness Areas of the Appalachians Category:Protected areas of Haywood County, North Carolina Category:IUCN Category Ib Category:Wilderness Areas of North Carolina Category:Pisgah National Forest ",
