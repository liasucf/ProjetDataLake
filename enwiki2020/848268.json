    "text": "The Party for Freedom and Progress (; ; , PVV-PLP) was a liberal political party in Belgium which existed from 1961 until 1992. The party was the successor of the Liberal Party, which had roots dating back to 1846. It was succeeded in the Flemish Community of Belgium by the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) and in the French Community by the Liberal Reformist Party, Parti des R\u00e9formes et des Libert\u00e9s de Wallonie and the current-day Reformist Movement. In the German-speaking Community, it still exists as the Party for Freedom and Progress. ==History== ===Foundation of a new party=== In 1961, Omer Vanaudenhove, leader of the Liberal Party, reorganised it into the Partij voor Vrijheid en Vooruitgang/Parti de la Libert\u00e9 et du Progr\u00e8s (PVV/PLP). The new party, among other things, jettisoned the Liberals' traditional anti- clericalism. In 1965 the party obtained a victory in the general elections with 21.6% of the votes. In 1966, the PVV joined the government of Paul Vanden Boeynants. The liberal ministers during this period were Willy De Clercq, Jacques Van Offelen, Frans Grootjans, Herman Vanderpoorten, Charles Poswick and August De Winter. ===Separation between PVV and PLP=== On 27 June 1971 the party was split up in a Flemish (PVV) and Walloon party (the Liberal Reformist Party, PRL). Only a few months later, on 24 September 1971, the parliament was dissolved. In the elections which followed The Flemish PVV gained votes, but the Walloon PRL lost in the elections. In this period (1971\u20131992) the PVV ministers in the government were: Willy De Clercq, Herman Vanderpoorten, Herman De Croo, Karel Poma, Alfred Vreven, Andr\u00e9 Kempinaire, Guy Verhofstadt, Louis Waltniel, Jean Pede, Patrick Dewael, Ward Beysen, and Jacky Buchmann. The PRL ministers in the government were: Andr\u00e9 Damseaux, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier de Donnea, Jean Gol, Louis Olivier, Charles Poswick, and Michel Toussaint. ===Flanders: VLD=== In Flanders, the PVV ceased to exist in 1992. On 15 November 1992 the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) was founded. ===French- speaking Community: MR=== In 1976, the name of the party was changed into Parti de R\u00e9formes et de la Libert\u00e9 en Wallonie (PRLW). In 1979, the name was changed to Liberal Reformist Party (PRL) after the merger with the Liberal Party of Brussels. In March 2002 the PRL merged with the German-speaking Party for Freedom and Progress (PFF) of the East Cantons, the Democratic Front of Francophones (FDF) and the Citizens' Movement for Change (MCC) into the Reformist Movement (MR). ==Presidents== ===Presidents PVV-PLP=== * 1961 - 1968 : Omer Vanaudenhove * 1968 - 1969 : Norbert Hougardy and Milou Jeunehomme (co- presidency) * 1969 - 1972 : Pierre Descamps ===Presidents PVV=== * 1972 - 1973 : Willy De Clercq * 1973 - 1977 : Frans Grootjans * 1977 - 1982 : Willy De Clercq * 1982 - 1985 : Guy Verhofstadt * 1985 - 1989 : Annemie Neyts * 1989 - 1992 : Guy Verhofstadt ==Notable members== * Lucienne Herman-Michielsens (1926\u20131995) * Jean Rey (1902\u20131983), President of the European Commission ==Electoral results== ===Federal Parliament=== Chamber {| class=wikitable |- !
