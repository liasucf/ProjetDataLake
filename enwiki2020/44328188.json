    "text": "Burkina Faso\u2013Soviet Union relations refers to the historical relationship between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the Republic of Burkina Faso (formerly the Republic of Upper Volta). Relations between the countries were relatively close during some parts of the late Cold War. The Soviet Union maintained an embassy in the Burkinab\u00e9 capital Ouagadougou, and Burkina Faso maintained an embassy in Moscow. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established for the first time on 18 February 1967, during the first years of Colonel General Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana's military rule in Upper Volta. During the 1960s, USSR was sometimes derisively referred to as \"Upper Volta with rockets\", coined by a journalist Xan Smiley, referencing USSR's disproportion of defence sector over relatively undeveloped civilian economy. Bamina Georges Nebie, a later prominent government minister, served as the Voltaic ambassador to the USSR for some time. One of his successors was Oubkiri Marc Yao. In 1983, Captain Thomas Sankara came to power in a military coup. While a radical left-wing revolutionary who had studied Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, Sankara \u2013 who attempted to implement what he dubbed the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\" () \u2013 did not align with the Soviet Union, preferring non-alignment and self-sufficiency. None the less, relations with strongly pro-Soviet states (such as Cuba) were close, and Sankara maintained friendly relations with the USSR, despite many contentions \u2013 the Patriotic League for Development, closely aligned with the USSR, was initially allied with Sankara, but its members were purged from the government in 1984. In a newspaper editorial entitled \"The Proletarian Spritit\", Sankara \u2013 who often condemned foreign aid as imperialism \u2013 criticized the Soviet Union's foreign aid policies. Sankara also condemned the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. In spite of these differences, the Soviet Union had some degree of cooperation with Burkina Faso \u2013 primarily militarily, in the form of provided training and equipment, and economically. Sankara made a state visit to Moscow while on a tour of other friendly states in October 1984. By the time Thomas Sankara was ousted and killed on 15 October 1987 in a military coup orchestrated by Blaise Compaor\u00e9, the government of Mikhail Gorbachev was far too busy with demokratizatsiya, perestroika and glasnost to continue near any of its previously major engagements in Burkina Faso and Africa overall. When the Revolutions of 1989 began, the Burkinab\u00e9 state debt to the USSR amounted to 4.3 million rubles. Burkina Faso recognized the Russian Federation as the USSR's successor state following its dissolution in 1991. The old respective Burkinab\u00e9\u2013Soviet embassies closed down later during the 1990s due to funding issues. ==See also== * Foreign relations of Burkina Faso * Foreign relations of the Soviet Union * Burkina Faso\u2013Russia relations ==References== Soviet Union Category:Bilateral relations of the Soviet Union Category:History of Burkina Faso ",
