AppSumo was founded in March 2010 by Noah Kagan. ==Operations== Initially, Sumo focused only on digital tools, such as SAAS apps that offered life time deals (LTD's). Today, the majority of deals offered are learning based products attempting to teach customers skills such as programming languages, project management, and hiring practices. AppSumo deals exclusively with digitally distributed goods. The deals include application software (apps), ebooks, learning courses, and other packages. Many of the site's deals are aimed towards productivity products and website tools, such as copywriting courses, email marketing, or project management apps. In 2015, AppSumo started a sister company called Sumo that sells marketing tools to help eCommerce businesses grow. AppSumo takes a percentage of sales from every deal, typically 50% of sales. == References == == External links == * AppSumo Official Website Category:Deal of the day services ",
