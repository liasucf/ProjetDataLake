He represented the FDP in the parliament of the Canton of Zurich from 1967 to 1971 and was a member of the Swiss National Council from 1983 to 1995. Beginning in 1972, Cincera established a private network of informers which he used to compile files about some 3,500 politicians, artists, teachers, trade unionists and other persons associated with left-wing politics. He made these files available to business and political leaders to help them identify presumed subversives in their organizations, which damaged the professional career of many people. In 1978, left-wing activists stole part of the files from Cincera's house and made their existence public, which caused a public scandal. Cincera was subsequently cut by the Swiss political and financial establishment, but continued to agitate as a writer and public speaker against what he considered the threat of Communist subversion in Switzerland. == Works == * Unser Widerstand gegen die Subversion in der Schweiz.
