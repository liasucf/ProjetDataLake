It is known in particular for its black and- white photographs of movie stars and celebrities, but having one's photo taken at Harcourt a few times during one's life was once considered standard by the French upper middle class.G\u00f6tter, gut ausgeleuchtet in Die Welt on 4 April 2010 The studio is currently located at 6, rue de Lota in the 16th arrondisment of Paris. ==History== Harcourt Studio Photography is the result of the association of the brothers Lacroix and Germaine Hirschfeld (1900\u20131976) aka Cosette Harcourt,Harcourt, soixante-quinze ans de classicisme in Le Figaro on 10 September 2009 a photographer who had worked in the studio of the brothers Manuel. Initially, the company produced images for the press, at a time when prestigious photo studios like Nadar closed for lack of clients.Sous le glamour, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 obscur du studio Harcourt in Le Monde on 7 November 2009 The change in direction came when Cosette Harcourt started to specialize in black-and-white glamour photography of figures from French cinema and culture, always using 24 x 30 cm prints immediately recognizable for their distinctive style and lighting. This typical Harcourt style consists of a photo taken at close distance to the subject in its best light, generally creating a halo of light and dark, on a gray-to-black background. The attitude of the subject is personal, often wearing a slight smile, but somehow always seeming a little staged. Also, the Harcourt logo is featured prominently on every print. This Harcourt style was inspired by the work of French cinematographer Henri Alekan. Around the time of World War II, Cosette Harcourt, who was Jewish, married one of the Lacroix brothers. Together they created a magazine, called Stars, to serve as an outlet for studio photos. During the occupation of France by the Nazis, German officers and many members of the Vichy regime visited the studios, just as the Americans did after the French Liberation. After the war, Harcourt regained its momentum with movie star photography, continuing the tradition that made it successful initially. In 2000, at the initiative of Jack Lang, the French state bought the photos of Studio Harcourt from between 1934 and 1991: about 5 million negatives of 550,000 persons and 1,500 celebrities. Having a photo taken at Harcourt in 2010 reportedly costs about 1,900 Euros. ==Gallery== GANCE Abel-24x30-.jpg|Abel Gance BAYE Nathalie-24x30-1994.jpg|Nathalie Baye in 1994 BOUQUET Carole-24x30-1995.jpg|Carole Bouquet in 1995 FEDERER Roger-24x30-1998.jpg|Roger Federer in 1998 Marion Cotillard Studio Harcourt 1999 (with signature).jpg|Marion Cotillard in 1999 BRUEL Patrick-24x30-2002.jpg|Patrick Bruel in 2002 CANET Guillaume-24x30-2004.jpg|Guillaume Canet in 2004 CASTA Laetitia-24x30-2005.jpg|Laetitia Casta in 2005 DECAUNES Antoine-24x30-NC.jpg|Antoine de Caunes in 2005 DE JORDANIE Rania-24x30-2005.jpg|Queen Rania of Jordan in 2005 CARRIERE Jean Claude-24x30-2006.jpg|Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re in 2006 CLERC Julien-24x30-2008.jpg|Julien Clerc in 2008 BELLUCCI Monica-24x30-2008.jpg|Monica Bellucci in 2008 ARDITI Pierre-24x30-2009.jpg|Pierre Arditi in 2009 CHAZAL_Claire-24x30-2009.jpg|Claire Chazal in 2009 DUJARDIN Jean 02-24x30-2009.jpg|Jean Dujardin in 2009 ==References== ==External links== *Official site * (video about the studio by Deutsche Welle) Category:Photographic studios Category:Photography companies of France ",
