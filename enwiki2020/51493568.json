This kind of coaching and support to enter high ranking universities has taken off in the UK in the last 10 years (1 in 6 Oxbridge applicants are said to use these services ) but it had been already in use in the United States for many decades with consultants like Kaplan, who have helped over 3 million students since 1938. == Criticisms == The validity of such services is often questioned and University Admissions Services often say that external coaching is not necessary. Some colleges also state that private consultancies \"don't have access to any \u2018insider information' that isn't available on the Cambridge website\". == References == Category:Companies based in Broxbourne Category:Educational organisations based in England ",
