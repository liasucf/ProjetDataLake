    "text": "The Melbourne Marathon has been held every year from 1978. The 42.195 km run over the traditional marathon distance is the main race within the annual Melbourne Marathon Festival. The race celebrated its 30th birthday in 2007 with a new course which featured the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) as both the starting point and finishing point. A total of 3328 competitors completed the 2008 race. Another 17,000 people participated in Half Marathon (21.1 km), 10 km and 5.5 km events. The 2019 running of the marathon saw an Australian record of 7037 finishers, 1880 of whom were female (27%). In 1978 approximately 4% of the 1947 finishers were female. The 2020 event was cancelled on the 9th of September due to the COVID-19 crisis. A virtual marathon is planned for December 5 to December 13. The marathon has been owned by IMG since 2006.By George, it\u2019s time to get fit for the Melbourne Marathon! ==The course== A variety of different courses have been used for the Melbourne Marathon although the most common course has begun at Frankston and concluded at either Albert Park or at The Arts Centre on St. Kilda Rd. It is normally run on the second Sunday in October. Since 2007 the event has started near the MCG and finished with a lap of the ground. The predominantly flat marathon course goes through some of the most scenic areas of Melbourne. It skirts the Botanic Gardens and Albert park Lake with several kilometres on the road parallel to the beaches of Port Phillip Bay. The other events share parts of the course but staggered starts ease congestion. ==Past winners== Key: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !class=unsortable|Edition !Year !class=unsortable|Men's winner !Time (h:m:s) !class=unsortable|Women's winner !Time (h:m:s) |- |1st |1978 || align=left| || 2:21:04 |align=left| || 2:53:38 |- |2nd |1979 || align=left| || 2:26:44 |align=left| || 3:12:35 |- |3rd |1980 || align=left| || 2:17:37 |align=left| || 2:46:16 |- |4th |1981 || align=left| || 2:19:03 |align=left| || 2:42:12 |- |5th |1982 || align=left| || 2:11:08 |align=left| || 2:37:57 |- |6th |1983 || align=left| || 2:13:15 |align=left| || 2:37:56 |- |7th |1984 || align=left| || 2:15:31 |align=left| || 2:43:40 |- |8th |1985 || align=left| || 2:12:35 |align=left| || 2:44:56 |- |9th |1986 || align=left| || 2:17:21 |align=left| || 2:36:06 |- |10th |1987 || align=left| || 2:14:16 |align=left| || 2:44:18 |- |11th |1988 || align=left| || 2:18:14 |align=left| || 2:47:38 |- |12th |1989 || align=left| || 2:18:13 |align=left| || 2:49:18 |- |13th |1990 || align=left| || 2:20:35 |align=left| || 2:39:00 |- |14th |1991 || align=left| || 2:17:02 |align=left| || 2:39:57 |- |15th |1992 || align=left| || 2:16:04\u2020 |align=left| || 2:33:02\u2020 |- |16th |1993 || align=left| || 2:15:07 |align=left| || 2:44:22 |- |17th |1994 || align=left| || 2:19:02 |align=left| || 2:47:37 |- |18th |1995 || align=left| || 2:17:19 |align=left| || 2:38:50 |- |19th | 1996 || align=left| || 2:22:40 |align=left| || 2:41:53 |- |20th | 1997 || align=left| || 2:15:49 |align=left| || 2:48:32 |- |21st | 1998 || align=left| || 2:12:48 |align=left| || 2:37:56 |- |22nd | 1999 || align=left| || 2:25:04 |align=left| || 2:33:27 |- |23rd | 2000 || align=left| || 2:25:53 |align=left| || 2:49:22 |- |24th | 2001 || align=left| || 2:23:58 |align=left| || 2:39:44 |- |25th | 2002 || align=left| || 2:22:28 |align=left| || 2:47:08 |- |26th | 2003 || align=left| || 2:14:00 |align=left| || 2:49:01 |- |27th | 2004 || align=left| || 2:26:51 |align=left| || 2:54:01 |- |28th | 2005 || align=left| || 2:23:30 |align=left| || 2:50:35 |- |29th | 2006 || align=left| || 2:23:43 |align=left| || 2:53:06 |- |30th | 2007 || align=left| || 2:19:16 |align=left| || 2:40:34 |- |31st | 2008 || align=left| || 2:17:43 |align=left| || 2:38:16 |- |bgcolor=#F7BE81|32nd | bgcolor=#F7BE81|2009 || align=left| || 2:17:32 || align=left| || 2:34:08 |- |bgcolor=#F7BE81|33rd | bgcolor=#F7BE81|2010 || align=left| || 2:11:04 |align=left| || 2:32:20 |- |bgcolor=#F7BE81|34th | bgcolor=#F7BE81|2011 || align=left| || 2:11:12 |align=left| || 2:35:12 |- |bgcolor=#F7BE81|35th | bgcolor=#F7BE81|2012 || align=left| || 2:12:35 |align=left| || 2:36:29 |- |36th | 2013 || align=left| || bgcolor=#A9F5A9|2:10:47 |align=left| || 2:26:05 |- |37th | 2014|| align=left| || 2:11:30 |align=left| || 2:31:05 |- |38th | 2015|| align=left| || 2:16:00 |align=left| || 2:27:45 |- |39th | 2016|| align=left| || 2:20:53 |align=left| || 2:34:27 |- |40th | 2017|| align=left| || 2:14:08 |align=left| || 2:29:27 |- |41st | 2018|| align=left| || 2:15:13 |align=left| || bgcolor=#A9F5A9|2:25:19 |- |42nd | 2019|| align=left| || 2:16:31 |align=left| || 2:35:34 |} *\u2020 = short course ==Spartans== ===Qualification=== Spartans are runners who have completed 10 or more Melbourne Marathons and are recognised today by their distinctive green, gold, red, maroon or navy running singlets.
