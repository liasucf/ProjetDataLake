The character and Thomas' casting was announced alongside that of the Barton family in May 2009. Thomas called Adam \"a family man\". The character first appeared during the episode broadcast on 17 July 2009. Following a break to participate in I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2016, Thomas opted to leave the serial and Adam's departure was announced on 22 June 2017, with his exit airing on 2 January 2018. Adam's storylines have included: his bromance with Aaron Dingle (Danny Miller); suffering a breakdown and committing arson following the death of his father, John Barton (James Thornton); discovering his uncle, James Barton (Bill Ward), is actually his biological father; his on-off marriage to Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins); believing he fathered Johnny Woodfield after a one-night stand with Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick); his fertility issues which prevent him having a child with Victoria; and admitting to killing Emma Barton (Gillian Kearney) to protect his mother Moira (Natalie J. Robb), who had actually killed her. ==Storylines== Towards the end of 2009, Holly Barton (Sophie Powles) starts flirting with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) and it looks as though a relationship is brewing. At first, Adam isn't keen but comes round, making friends with Aaron. When Aaron suddenly starts playing hard to get with Holly, Adam questions it but Aaron says it's all part of the plan. However, everything slots into place when the boys and Holly go on a \"lads\" night out. When Aaron and Adam are on their way back, they are involved in a car crash and Aaron cuts his head. As Adam is checking it out, Aaron leans in for a kiss. Adam is horrified and pulls away, questioning Aaron's sexuality, but Aaron convinces him that it's all in his head. Not completely convinced, he tells Holly after realising that she has slept with Aaron but his parents insist he drops it when Holly, refusing to believe Adam, gets annoyed with him. Aaron watches jealously as Adam gets closer to Scarlett Nicholls (Kelsey- Beth Crossley) and starts dating her. In early 2010, Adam is still convinced that Aaron is gay but leaves Aaron alone as he learns that Hannah is being bullied, but is confused about why Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins) did it. When sheep on the Bartons' farm start being stillborn, John knows something is wrong but doesn't know what. When Carl King's (Tom Lister) children, Thomas (Jack Ferguson) and Anya (Ceryen Dean), are hospitalised, Jai (Chris Bisson) and Nikhil Sharma (Rik Makarem) are blamed but tests clear them and Adam remembers moving some toxic barrels a few months back and is shocked to discover he's responsible. When he confesses to his parents, John goes mad but realises that they have to admit responsibility. They are fined by Nathan Wylde (Lyndon Ogbourne) for the clean up so John stops Adam's wages until the bill is paid. In April, Adam witnesses Aaron kissing his secret boyfriend, Jackson Walsh (Marc Silcock), but tells Aaron that he'll still be his mate, regardless of his sexuality, and keep his relationship secret. On his birthday, Adam and others at The Woolpack see Aaron punch Jackson, after Aaron thinks he's flirting with him in public, resulting in Aaron being arrested. When released, Aaron decides he can no longer risk people finding out he's gay and attempts suicide in the garage. When Adam and Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) discover him, they save him but Aaron reveals that he wishes he had died. Adam and his whole family struggle to come to terms with his sister Holly's addiction to heroin. He takes her to see Jackson who, after a horrific accident, has lost his ability to walk, Adam tries to show Holly that, she (unlike Jackson) can choose to get better and has made herself ill. The message doesn't sink in and Aaron is annoyed with Adam for using Jackson to get this message across to his sister. Scarlett notices that Adam has less and less time for her, ignoring her phone calls and text messages. This decline in their relationship culminates in Adam kissing Mia Macey (Sapphire Elia) on New Year's Eve. Devastated by this, Scarlett leaves for a holiday in Canada. Adam tries to pursue Mia, although she plays hard to get. They later start a relationship although Adam ruins this when he starts an affair with Mia's mother, Ella (Corrinne Wicks). She is furious when she finds out the truth and leaves the village. Adam is understandably distraught when he learns of his mother's affair with Cain, but he is delighted when John and Moira patch things up and they get back together. When John and Moira spend the night in a hotel, Adam is stunned to receive a phone call from Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward), informing him that John and Moira have been in a car accident. Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Adam watches in horror as the doctors declare his father dead. Adam falls to pieces after the death of John, blaming Cain for his death, believing that if Cain had not seduced Moira, his parents would have never split and had to go on the romantic break, resulting in John's death. Adam then set fire to the Dingle Automotors Garage, trapping Cain inside, then saving him. Adam confides in Aaron. Seeing Adam's pain at the grieving of John, Aaron tells the police he started the fire. Missing court, Adam helps Aaron escape to France with Ed Roberts (Lloyd Everitt). In August 2014, Adam is shocked as Aaron returns two years later and is ready to cover for Adam, following recent events of the fire at the garage.

Adam gets grief from Rhona Goskirk and he gets drunk, rather than attend the wedding of Pete Barton and Debbie Dingle.

Adam wakes up in the car and Robert and Chrissie got him out before the car exploded. In January 2016, Vanessa takes another DNA test to see if Adam really is the father of Johnny (Vanessa's baby), after she finds a birthmark which the midwife says that it is perfectly normal for a mixed race baby to have. The DNA test reveals that Kirin is actually the father. When Vanessa breaks the news to Adam, he is devastated and attacks Kirin's father after he learns that it was him that switched the DNA results. Vanessa gives Adam some time alone with Johnny, but Adam takes off with him and hides in a hotel. Victoria talks Adam into returning Johnny to Vanessa before it gets serious. In February 2016, after learning that Aaron had been repeatedly raped at the hands of his father when he was younger, Adam is livid and offers to help Cain deal with Aaron's dad.

They clash over the issue and Adam admits he wasn't going to take it but changes his mind and decides to accept it. Adam fights with Ross after he learns that he tried it on with Victoria. Vic tries to break them up but ends up getting hurt. She is taken to the hospital where she tells a shocked Adam she might be pregnant.
