In 1928 he established a radium centre at the Westminster Hospital, where with the assistance of his son Francis Carling, he set up the first \"radium bombs\". Rock Carling became a member of the Medical Research Council and the Radium Trust that year. ==Author== In 1929 he authored a Course of instruction in radium practice. His later publications include: British Surgical Practice (which he wrote with J. P. Ross in 1947). Rock Carling was a member of several committees related to nuclear energy, and was chairman of both the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the Radium Commission of the Central Health Services Council. He was also Chairman of the British Ministry of Health Cancer Commission. In 1950, following the publication of an estimate of the human toll of a hypothetical atomic explosion over London, he stated that \"to live in the atomic age is perforce to accept the implications: Fully faced they are robbed of half their terrors.\" In 1951, he was quoted in American newspapers as stating that efficient medical treatments had been developed to counter the effects of almost all known biological weapons. ==Cancer treatment unit== In 1954, Rock Carling opened Britain's first radio-cobalt cancer treatment unit at the Bristol General Hospital. In 1955, he wrote British Practice in Radiotherapy with B. W. Windeyer and D. W. Smithers. ==Founder== Rock Carling was a founding member of the City of Westminster Old People's Welfare Association and a long-serving member of the Westminster Medical School Council and the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men. Dr A.J. Shinnie wrote of Carling in the British Medical Journal that \"all his life he lived for Westminster Hospital\", and that the new building there that opened in 1939 was his \"child\". He died in 1960 at the age of 83. == References == Category:1877 births Category:1960 deaths Category:British surgeons Category:British radiologists Category:Physicians of the Westminster Hospital ",
