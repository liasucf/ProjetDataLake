The album contains remixes of tracks from Tohoshinki's first four albums since becoming a duo\u2014Tone (2011), Time (2013), Tree (2014), and With (2014). The music in the album is influenced by variations of 1950's to 1960's lounge music and soft rock, including surf music, bossa nova, Philly soul, and lovers rock. Two of Us debuted at number two on the Oricon Albums Chart and Billboard Japan Top Albums Chart, selling 28,000 copies. ==Background== Two of Us was announced on August 19, 2016 by Avex Trax through Tohoshinki's official website. The album was created while both members of Tohoshinki were fulfilling their compulsory service in South Korea. Rather than mixing the songs into dance or club tracks, Tohoshinki and their label opted for a more \"colorful\" approach to the remixes. The theme of the album focuses on relaxing sounds throughout the day, and incorporates serene beach remix styles such as lounge music. The cover of Two of Us features a colorful painting of Tohoshinki, which is based on a series of photos that Tohoshinki shot for their \"Sweat / Answer\" single in 2014. On September 2, Avex Trax released short snippets of \"Baby, don't cry\" and \"OCEAN\". ==Track listing== ==Credits and personnel== Credits for Two of Us, taken from the liner notes of the album. *Tohoshinki \u2013 main vocals *Shinjiroh Inoue \u2013 music, arrangement, programming, mixer, recorder, guitar *Tsukiko Nakamura \u2013 vocals, music, guitar *Goro Ito \u2013 remixer, classical guitar, programming *Keita Ogawa \u2013 drums, percussion *Masayasu Tzboguchi \u2013 Rhodes piano *KONCOS \u2013 remixer *Taichi Furukawa \u2013 piano, drums, synthesizers *Hiroshi Sato \u2013 guitar *Gakuji \"MABE\" Matsuda \u2013 technical advisor, remixer, triangle, conga *Tsutomu Oikawa \u2013 mixer, recorder *Mamoru S \u2013 mixer, programming, guitar *Tsuyoshi Fujita \u2013 remixer, programming, electric guitar *Atsushi Hattori \u2013 mixer *Tadashi Iwamura \u2013 drums *Taizo Nakamura \u2013 bass *Gota Yashiki \u2013 remixer, programming, drums *Dub Maxer X \u2013 mixer *Mitsuhiro Tanigawa \u2013 recorder *KOICHI from SAWAGI \u2013 remixer, piano *Yoichiro Kakizaki \u2013 programmer, remixer, piano, guitar *Kitaro Nakamura \u2013 bass *Obawo Nakajima \u2013 percussion *Kiyoto Konda \u2013 guitar *Tatsuya Morokaji \u2013 mixer, recorder *Eiichi Kogrey \u2013 remixer, drums, bass, recorder *George (MOP of HEAD) \u2013 remixer, piano, synthesizers, mixer, recorder *Mio Abe \u2013 violin *Akico Maruyama \u2013 violin *TSUTCHIE \u2013 mixer *Mastered by Yuka Koizumi *Illustrator: Hitoshi Kuroki *Booklet liner notes: Takashi Inomata *Art direction and design: Masaru Nakagawa ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- | Billboard Japan Top Albums | 2 |} ===Sales=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:600px;\" |- ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Released ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Oricon chart ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Debut sales ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Sales total |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|October 5, 2016 |align=\"left\"|Daily Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|22,801 | style=\"text- align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|30,638 |- |align=\"left\"|Weekly Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|27,951 |- |align=\"left\"|Monthly Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|13 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|30,638 |} ==References== Category:2016 compilation albums Category:TVXQ albums Category:Avex Group compilation albums ",
