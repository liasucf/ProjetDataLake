    "text": "Dawn Explosion, the third and final album by Captain Beyond, was released in 1977. The band had broken up four years before, but Warner Bros. Records signed a deal with the band's original label, Capricorn Records, and contacted the band members asking them to reunite. Because original singer Rod Evans could not be contacted, Captain Beyond held auditions and picked Willy Daffern to replace him. The drummer position was taken by original member Bobby Caldwell rather than his successor Marty Rodriguez. The song \"Dawn Explosion\" was recorded during the album sessions but the final album did not include the track, despite taking its title from it. ==Track listing== CD reissues split \"Breath of Fire, Part 1 & Part 2\" into two tracks (subtitled \"A Speck Within a Sphere\" and \"Alone in the Cosmos\", respectively), and \"Oblivion\" into three tracks (with the preceding \"Space Interlude\" and succeeding \"Space Reprise\" being the sound effects and percussion that bookend the main section of \"Oblivion\"). ==Personnel== * Willy Daffern \u2013 lead vocals * Larry \"Rhino\" Reinhardt \u2013 lead guitar, acoustic guitar, slide guitar * Lee Dorman \u2013 bass, backing vocals, string ensemble synthesizer * Bobby Caldwell \u2013 drums, backing vocals, percussion ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|1977 |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Pop Albums |align=\"center\"|181 |} ==References== * Category:Captain Beyond albums Category:1977 albums Category:Warner Records albums ",
