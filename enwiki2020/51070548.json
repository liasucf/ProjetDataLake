Emiliano Basile of Escribiendo Cine also gave the film a positive review, writing: \"Permitidos is effective by more than it floods in some lapses by the excess situations. It is [effective] because its goal of smooth and flat entertainment wards off of the traditional conservative moralizing. CineFreak's Alex Arellano gave the film a positive review, stating: \"Permitidos is a genuine comedy, a film whose script is an elaborated swarm of absurd and crazy situations, which managed to combine and create consistency between every scene and every word of the script. It is a risky proposition that could have been a big frustration. However, its director decided to focus on the humor, and if the audience judges it [the film], it will undoubtedly have a good reception. Fernando Alvarez of Todo lo ve highlighted Esp\u00f3sito and Piroyanky's performance and wrote: \"it is a well- executed, agile comedy that counts with solid technical resources and a delirium that the viewer will have to play, between ducks, geese and a smarter friend that he looks\". Meanwhile, Diego Alvarez from Cuatro Bastardos gave the film a perfect score (10 out of 10) recognizing Winograd's direction and Piroyansky's performance, which he describes as \"impeccable\", and Esp\u00f3sito's, adding that the actress is an actoral revelation and that her performance \"will surely remain in the records of argentinian cinema\". Fer Casals of Meta magazine compared the film with Hollywood comedies, saying: \"Ariel Winograd newest movie surprises from its freshness and naturalness represented by the charm of its protagonists\".
