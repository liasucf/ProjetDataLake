Events listed include television show finales and cancellations and information about controversies and carriage disputes. ==Notable events== ===January=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Date ! Event ! Source |- !rowspan=3| 1 | Starz and its related channels (including Starz Encore and Movieplex) are removed from Altice USA-owned cable systems, including Optimum and Suddenlink. The removal of the premium services follows \"numerous attempts\" between Altice and Starz parent Lionsgate to secure a new carriage agreement. In a statement, Altice representatives said that it did not make sense to charge a high fee to its subscribers to carry Starz and its sister channels as the network maintains a standalone over-the-top streaming service, particularly because \"their viewership is declining and the majority of our customers don't watch Starz.\" The dispute ends on February 13 after Starz Inc. and Altice come to a new agreement, though the networks returned a month later, on March 1 (over- the-top access to the Starz website and apps was returned for the interim period). | |- | Frontier Communications drops CBS affiliate KIRO-TV/Seattle from its Frontier FiOS systems in western Washington state, after failing to reach a new carriage agreement with KIRO parent Cox Media Group. Frontier representatives stated that Cox Media was asking for the provider to increase its carriage fees for the station's main feed and its GetTV- and Laff- affiliated subchannels by more than 80% over the next three-year contractual period. | |- | NuLink (a cable provider owned by WideOpenWest) drops the Meredith Corporation-owned duopoly of CBS affiliate WGCL-TV and independent station WPCH-TV from its systems in five Atlanta-area suburbs, after the two parties failed to agree on terms to renew the stations' contract. | |- ! 2 | NBC News announces that Hoda Kotb will assume the weekday co-anchor chair of Today permanently with Savannah Guthrie, filling the seat held by Matt Lauer before his November 29 termination from the network due to inappropriate sexual behavior, and after a month where Today exceeded ratings expectations despite Kotb's previous interim status. Though not the first time two women have headed an American morning program (Robin Roberts and Diane Sawyer co- hosted ABC's Good Morning America from 2006 to 2009), it is the first time two women are the leading hosts for Today. Kotb will also continue to host the lighter 10:00 a.m. Today hour with Kathie Lee Gifford. | |- ! 3 | CBS News fires political director Steve Chaggaris, after allegations of past \"inappropriate behavior\" were disclosed to division management over the prior two weeks. Neither the nature nor extent of the allegations against Chaggaris \u2013 who joined CBS in 1999, and was appointed as its senior political editor upon returning to the network following a two-year hiatus in 2010, before being promoted to political director in March 2017 \u2013 were disclosed. | |- ! 4 |Production on Jeopardy! is placed on temporary hiatus while host Alex Trebek recuperates from a successful December 16, 2017, surgery at Los Angeles's Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to remove a subdural hematoma that formed as a complication from a minor head injury he suffered in a fall that October. Trebek resumed taping of the syndicated game show in mid-January, though because of the show's advanced taping schedule, his medical leave only marginally affected the show's broadcast schedule: the annual Jeopardy! College Championship, which was originally scheduled to have all ten episodes tape during the first week of January, instead filmed in March (one month before the episodes begin airing during the first week of the May sweeps period). | |- ! 6 | After nine years in the role, Jon Gruden covers his last game as color analyst for Monday Night Football during an AFC Wild Card game between the Tennessee Titans and the Kansas City Chiefs broadcast on ESPN and ABC. Gruden, who was hired by ESPN in May 2009 as color analyst for the weekly NFL game broadcasts, leaves the booth to return to the coaching ranks as head coach of the Oakland Raiders for the 2018 season. | |- !rowspan=2| 7 | Fed up with not getting any answers and a lot of deflection while he was questioning him about whether President Donald Trump met with Russian operatives after his son, Donald Trump Jr., got together with them in the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, as well as claims journalist Michael Wolff made in his just-released book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House about his fitness and stability, including quotes made by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon about his feelings towards Trump, only to start dismissing it as \"a pure work of fiction\" and \"nothing but a pile of trash through and through,\" which in turn lead into a slamming of CNN for making \"condescending\" and \"snide\" remarks and airing \"24 hours of negative, anti- Trump, hysterical coverage\" upon praising his boss as a \"political genius,\" State of the Union host Jake Tapper tells White House aide Stephen Miller that \"I think I have wasted enough of my viewers' time,\" and abruptly ended the interview immediately, believing that Miller was taking cues from Trump that Tapper was unimpressed with. | |- | The 75th Golden Globe Awards are broadcast on NBC, with Seth Meyers as host. The sexual harassment controversies that began in 2017 are the main topic of discussion, as several (primarily) female celebrities help evolve the Me Too movement into Time's Up, a legal defense fund supporting lower-income women seeking justice for workplace sexual harassment and sexual assault. Big Little Lies (with four awards), The Handmaid's Tale and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (with two awards each) are the major winners among television nominees, while Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (with four awards), Lady Bird and The Shape of Water (with two awards each) are the big winners among film nominees. |'Three Billboards' and 'Big Little Lies' are the top winners of a very different kind of Golden Globes awards Los Angeles Times, January 7, 2018 |- ! 8 | The Federal Communications Commission begins the elimination on this date of the Main Studio Rule; the long-standing rule had required television and radio stations to maintain a physical studio 25 miles within its city of license, have it staffed during normal business hours, and have capabilities for program origination. |\"Main Studio Rule Elimination Takes Effect Monday, January 8\" from Radio Insight (January 4, 2018) |- ! 10 | John Dickerson becomes the new co-anchor of CBS This Morning (joining existing co-anchors Gayle King and Norah O'Donnell), one day after CBS News taps him to succeed Charlie Rose, who was fired in October 2017 following amid accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior with several female employees of his former PBS talk show. Dickerson \u2013 who will relocate full-time from Washington, D.C. to New York City with the promotion \u2013 will transition out of his position as moderator of Face the Nation, a role he assumed in June 2015. On February 22, it is announced Margaret Brennan will assume the permanent moderator of Face the Nation succeed by Dickerson, though he returns to that position in September on a temporary basis during Brennan's maternity leave. | |- ! 11 | The Sports Fans Coalition launches Locast, a streaming service offering access to 15 local broadcast stations \u2013 including CBS owned-and- operated station WCBS-TV, NBC O&O; WNBC, Fox O&O; WNYW, ABC O&O; WABC-TV and CW affiliate WPIX \u2013 to viewers residing within New York City's five boroughs. Co-founder David Goodfriend contends that, unlike defunct subscription service Aereo (which ceased operations after a 2014 Supreme Court case that found that Aereo retransmitted stations in infringement of copyright law), Locast's nonprofit business model \u2013 which relies on individual donations to support operational costs, in order to maintain free access to program streams \u2013 permits it to retransmit broadcast signals without prior approval of television stations or their corporate parents under copyright exemptions that have existed since the 1970s. | |- ! 12 | In a memo sent to company employees, Charter Communications CEO Tom Rutledge announces that its Spectrum News unit of 24-hour local cable news channels will expand to include networks in five additional markets served by the cable television provider \u2013 Los Angeles, Ohio, Kentucky (likely an expansion of its existing news channel in that state), Wisconsin and Kansas City \u2013 during 2018. | |- ! 18 | Seven members of the Endemol Shine Group, which contracts with CNBC to produce Staten Island Hustle, are arrested at Newark Liberty International Airport for attempting to put through airport security a prototype piece of rolling 'vacuum compression' luggage which had the look on first glance of an improvised explosive device, during their filming. The Transportation Security Administration determined later it was not a threat, but the crew will face possible penalties for the inconvenience. |Film crew linked to CNBC show arrested after attempting to sneak fake bomb through airport security The Hill, January 19, 2018 |- !rowspan=2| 19 | Kaye Switzer and the holders of the trust of the late Sandi Spreckman file a breach of contract lawsuit against Judy Sheindlin and CBS Corporation (along with subsidiaries CBS Television Studios and Big Ticket Television) for unspecified damages. The seven-count filing alleges that the plaintiffs (who co-created the syndicated court show in 1996) are owed $4.75 million in compensation through the August 2017 sale of the episode library of Judge Judy (which Sheindlin acquired for $95 million) per a clause in the five-season contract renewal reached with Big Ticket and CBS in March 2015, that stated that Switzer and the Spreckman estate were subject to compensation through the transfer of the episode library to Sheindlin and re-sold the library in violation of the contract. | |- | Authorities in Novi, Michigan arrest a man for making a series of threatening calls to CNN. Brandon Griesemer, who was charged in U.S. District Court with transmitting interstate communications with the intent to extort and threat to injure, allegedly made 22 calls to CNN on January 9\u201310, several of which contained disparaging statements about minorities and claims of \"fake news\" by CNN, as well as a threat to kill employees at CNN's Atlanta headquarters. If convicted, Greisemer could face a fine or a prison term. The news of Griesemer's arrest calls attention to critics' concerns about the risk of threats and acts of violence against journalists with CNN and other news organizations by some of President Donald Trump's most fervent supporters amid his repeated criticism of the Time Warner-owned cable network. Network sources stated that threats against CNN personnel have increased since Trump's criticism of CNN began during his 2016 Presidential campaign. |\"Michigan man arrested after caller threatens to kill CNN employees,\" from CNN.com, January 23, 2018 |- !rowspan=2| 23 | ESPN announces that Matt Vasgersian and Alex Rodriguez will join the broadcast team of Sunday Night Baseball for the 2018 season, succeeding Dan Shulman and Aaron Boone respectively. Boone was hired as manager of the New York Yankees in December 2017. Under Rodriguez's agreement with ESPN, the former shortstop and third baseman will remain an analyst for Fox Sports's postseason coverage, and will make guest appearances on the ESPN morning program Get Up which would premiere in April. Likewise, Vasgersian will retain his position with MLB Network as a host and announcer. | |- | Hero Broadcasting announces it will sell Am\u00e9rica Tev\u00e9 affiliate KMOH- TV/Kingman, Arizona and its Phoenix translator KEJR-LD to HC2 Holdings for $2.7 million, pending FCC approval. | |- ! 26 | After nearly a year as co- anchor of the 6:00 p.m. (ET) edition of ESPN's SportsCenter, Jemele Hill announces that she will step down from that position on February 2 to join its sister website The Undefeated and to focus on special assignments she feels more tailored for; however, Hill will remain with the network as she still has three years left on a four-year contract. Her partner Michael Smith would continue to anchor the program solo until March 9. Two months later, Sage Steele and Kevin Negandhi were reported to be the new anchors for the hour. |\"Jemele Hill is Leaving SC6 for The Undefeated\" from Sports Illustrated (January 26, 2018) |- ! 28 | The 60th Annual Grammy Awards aired live on CBS, from Madison Square Garden in New York after fifteen consecutive years at Staples Center in Los Angeles; however, because of disputes over the handling of future events, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences have announced that it will return to Los Angeles for the 2019 Awards and beyond. |\"Hillary Clinton, Cardi B and More 'Audition' to Narrate 'Fire and Fury' at the 2018 Grammys\" from Billboard (January 28, 2018) \"Grammys 2018 Winners: The Complete List\" from Billboard (January 28, 2018) |- !rowspan=3| 29 | Entertainment One purchases the 49% in The Mark Gordon Company that it did not already own for $209 million, as part of a deal that will also see Gordon \u2013 whose television productions include ongoing series such as Grey's Anatomy, Quantico, Designated Survivor and Criminal Minds \u2013 become chief content officer of the Toronto-based entertainment distributor (Gordon and newly appointed company president Steve Bertram will succeed longtime president John Moryaniss, who will step down from the post following a transitional period). | |- | Ten years after the network dropped the name in a de-emphasis of its former 24-hour rolling news format, HLN reinstates the \"Headline News\" moniker into its on-air branding (albeit on a secondary basis), which is featured prominently on-air during the network's 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) lineup. The move coincides with the addition of \"Headlines Now,\" a 90-second segment summarizing the day's top stories that airs at the top and bottom of each hour between 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET. | |- | Production on A&E;'s upcoming home improvement series Home Rescue is suspended after one of its regulars, Christopher Dionne, is arrested in California after he was accused of molesting a 10-year-old girl, including taking photos of her chest and allowing her to touch him inappropriately during a party he went to in Old Lyme, Connecticut in November 2017. |\"Host of Home Remodeling TV Shows Charged With Sexually Assaulting Minor In Old Lyme\" from Hartford Courant (January 29, 2018) |- !rowspan=2| 30 | Hours after Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address, Stephanie Clifford (known by her stage name Stormy Daniels), a former adult film star who is alleged to have had an affair with the President, sat down for an interview with Jimmy Kimmel on his ABC talk show. This was Daniels's first appearance on a late night program since The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid her $130,000 to keep quiet about the details. As she had done during an interview with Inside Edition the week prior, Daniels avoided directly answering or coyly dodged questions about the alleged affair, but did imply that she did not write a statement released that afternoon \u2013 claiming to be from her \u2013 which strongly refuted the allegations. On February 14, Daniels announces that she will start telling her story after the lawyer admitted to having paid off the money out of his own pocket, thus violating the non-disclosure agreement. | \"Stormy Daniels Says Trump Lawyer Breached Agreement, So She's Free To Talk\" from The Huffington Post (February 14, 2018) |- | The Trinity Broadcasting Network announces it will acquire independent station WDVB-CD/Edison, New Jersey (located within the New York City market) and Youtoo America affiliate WLPD-CD/Chicago from LocusPoint Networks for $13 million. The sale of the low- power stations extends existing channel sharing agreements with TBN owned-and- operated stations WWTO-TV/Naperville, Illinois and WTBY-TV/Jersey City that were established in November 2017. | |- ! 31 | Fox reaches an agreement with the National Football League to acquire the broadcast television rights to Thursday Night Football, assuming the contractual rights from CBS and NBC (both of which had shared the rights for the past two seasons), in a deal estimated to be around $550 million (a $150 million increase from the combined fee that NBC and CBS had been paying). The five-year deal, which expands the network's relationship with the NFL (it already holds rights to preseason, Sunday afternoon regular season, and select playoff games, primarily involving teams in the National Football Conference), will give Fox and Fox Deportes rights to simulcast eleven NFL Network-produced games in prime time between Weeks 4 and 15 of the regular season through 2022. | |} ===February=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Date ! Event ! Source |- !rowspan=3| 1 | Twelve years after splitting into two separate companies, the boards for CBS Corporation and Viacom announce their intent to explore a potential remerger. The study will be conducted at the behest of Shari Redstone, president of National Amusements, which holds controlling interest in both Viacom and CBS. It comes at a time when the media landscape faces changes with the still-pending merger between AT&T; and Time Warner, plus the planned takeover by The Walt Disney Company of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets. | |- | NBC affiliates WVIR-TV/Charlottesville, Virginia and WBBH-TV/Fort Myers, Florida (along with WBBH's sister ABC affiliate WZVN-TV/Naples) are removed from Dish Network, after the satellite provider and the parent company of the two stations, Waterman Broadcasting, fail to reach an agreement on retransmission fees. The dispute ended two days later on February 3, the day prior to NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LII, when Dish and Waterman reached a multi-year carriage agreement for the stations. | |- | Independent station KAZT-TV/Prescott, Arizona is also removed by Dish Network, after the provider and KAZT owner Londen Media Group failed to agree on retransmission terms during carriage agreement negotiations, along with Dish declining an offer by Londen to carry the station's MeTV-affiliated DT2 subchannel at no additional charge. In response to a statement by Dish suggesting that KAZT's parent company did not respond to repeated attempts to secure a deal, Londen Media CEO Lynn Londen contended that the company rescinded its offer to carry KAZT-DT2 after experiencing resistance from Dish management and that it was not demanding a rate increase to carry KAZT, stating \"We are going at zero fees, asking for zero fees.\" | |- ! 2 | Beth Holloway \u2013 whose daughter, Natalee Holloway, disappeared during a trip to Aruba in 2005 \u2013 sues Oxygen Media and Brian Graden Media for $35 million, over what she calls misleading statements that were made during the production of The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway, a six-part documentary that aired on Oxygen in August 2017. Beth's complaint stated that the special was a \"pre-planned farce\" and \"not a realtime or legitimate investigation into new leads\" as claimed, and claims that she was duped into providing DNA for testing against remains found by producers, without informing her of its use for a television program. An Oxygen representative stated that the complaint painted an \"inaccurate depiction of how the series was produced,\" and was developed in collaboration with Beth's ex-husband, Dave Holloway, and a private investigator he hired based on a lead he had received. | |- !rowspan=2| 3 | Effective on this date, YouTube begins labeling \"state- sponsored\" content on news and reporting from government-run or funded broadcasters as part of an effort to filter out fake news and fabricated stories that could be viewed as propaganda. The label will appear below the video and above its title, as well as a link to the broadcaster's Wikipedia page. The move has been criticized for including PBS among those that will be listed because of it being a non-commercial network \u2013 despite operating independently of the U.S. government \u2013 as it only receives a small portion of federal funding and its member stations are made up of nonprofit organizations, schools, universities, and local/state governments. A PBS spokesperson called the move \"vague and misleading,\" and said that the public broadcaster is working out a deal to rectify the situation. |\"Amid \"Fake News\" Debate, YouTube Will Now Label State-Sponsored Videos\" from The Hollywood Reporter (February 3, 2018) |- | Charter Communications ceases carriage of eleven television stations owned by Northwest Broadcasting and its subsidiaries in six markets \u2013 Yuma\u2013El Centro (CBS affiliate KSWT and NBC affiliate KYMA-DT), Spokane (Fox affiliate KAYU-TV), Syracuse (Fox affiliate WSYT), Idaho Falls (NBC affiliate KPVI-DT), Yakima (Fox affiliate KFFX-TV), Eureka (NBC affiliate KIEM-TV and CBS affiliate KJRW), Binghamton (Fox affiliate WICZ-TV), and Medford (Fox affiliate KMVU-DT) \u2013 over a disagreement during negotiations of a new distribution contract over carriage fees for the stations. | |- !rowspan=3| 4 | Super Bowl LII, which saw the Philadelphia Eagles defeat the New England Patriots 41\u201333 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, aired on NBC in English and Universo in Spanish. The game \u2013 watched by an estimated 103.4 million viewers (a 7% decline from the previous year), making it the lowest-rated Super Bowl telecast since 2009's Super Bowl XLIII (which was watched by 98.7 million viewers) \u2013 marked the Eagles' first Super Bowl championship win and their fourth national championship in franchise history. Justin Timberlake headlined the halftime show, performing a medley of his own hit songs as well as Prince's \"I Would Die 4 U\", a tribute that was criticized by the late singer's fans for using a sheet projecting footage from Purple Rain of Prince (who objected to the use of digital editing to include a deceased artist into a performance) performing the 1984 hit, and because of Timberlake's past critical remarks about him. The performance marked Timberlake's third Super Bowl halftime appearance and his first since the incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII, in which he accidentally exposed Janet Jackson's right breast on-air during their performance of Timberlake's \"Rock Your Body\". The telecast was also subject to a control room equipment failure during the second quarter, in which viewers saw a black screen for about 30 seconds during a commercial break. (Representatives with NBC Sports stated that the error did not result in any loss of advertising revenue and implied that said break was likely intended to consist of network promotions.) | |- | The Super Bowl LII telecast was followed by a lead-out episode of This Is Us titled \"Super Bowl Sunday\", in which the fate of Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia) was revealed as a sudden death from a \"widowmaker\" heart attack caused by smoke inhalation. The episode was watched by 26.97 million viewers, making it the highest-rated post-Super Bowl entertainment program since NBC's airing of the second-season premiere of The Voice in 2012, and the highest- rated episode of This is Us to date. Later that night, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon aired a special live episode from The Orpheum Theater in Minneapolis with the cast of This Is Us, Dwayne Johnson, and a pair of performances by Timberlake, one featuring Chris Stapleton. | |- | On the same day as the telecast, a commercial for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Ram Trucks utilizing Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic \u2013 and final \u2013 sermon from 1968, \"The Drum Major Instinct\" speech airs (the speech also marked the 50th anniversary on this date as well). The ad became the subject of controversy over the images of only one African American used in the scene, along with backlash from viewers, including members from the King Family themselves, as they did not authorize the speech to be used or gave Fiat Chrysler permission to use it (FCA got the permission from a company that holds the IP rights to the King estate). William B. Wachtel, the co-founder of The Drum Major Institute (with Dr. King), stated that the speech \"in no way condones the use of Dr. King's sermon for this purpose,\" adding that King used the speech to target the specific evils that he condemned, which was the exploitation of minorities by advertisers, including the automotive industry. |Super Bowl pickup truck ad outrages viewers by using MLK speech from Entertainment Weekly (February 4, 2018)Super Bowl Ad Review: Why Madison Avenue Chose Pop Over Politics from Variety (February 4, 2018) Martin Luther King Jr. sermon used in a Ram Trucks Super Bowl commercial draws backlash from The Washington Post (February 4, 2018) |- !rowspan=2| 5 | LeSEA Broadcasting announces that it will sell WHNO/New Orleans, KEEN-CD/Las Vegas and KWHS-LD/Colorado Springs to the Christian Television Network for $5.7 million. The sale was finalized 2\u00be months later on April 25. | |- | Father and daughter team Kirk and Brooke Spangler of Belfast, New York win a total of $1,415,098 on the second-season finale episode of The Wall, setting a record for the highest amount of money won by a team of contestants on the NBC game show. | |- ! 7 | CBS affiliate WHBF-TV/Rock Island, Illinois (Quad Cities) becomes the first local television station in the United States to employ a full-time reporter of Muslim American descent and the first American television reporter to regularly appear on-air wearing a hijab, with the promotion of Tahera Rahman (who joined WHBF as a newscast producer in May 2016) to the station's reporting staff. | |- ! 7\u201325 | The 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea airs on NBC and its cable networks. Norway finished first in the medal table, winning 39 total medals (including 14 gold and silver medals each, and 11 bronzes); the United States finished fourth, with 23 medals (nine gold, eight silver and six bronze, with alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin, snowboarders Shaun White and Chloe Kim, and the U.S. women's ice hockey and the men's curling teams among the major U.S. gold medalists). As the 14-hour time difference with the Eastern Time Zone and the separation of South Korea and the United States by the International Date Line resulted in many events being held during the late morning (KST) taking place during the time period of peak television viewing in the U.S., NBC broadcast Winter Olympic competition live in prime time across all U.S. time zones \u2013 instead of a time zone-based tape delay \u2013 for the first time. (NBC aired select events held earlier in the day or the day prior on tape delay during its daytime, prime time, and late night coverage.) In addition, NBC stations in the Pacific and/or Mountain time zones carried an additional 30 minutes of event coverage during their respective prime time windows on 13 nights during the Olympics. Coverage began two days earlier than usual (Olympics coverage typically begins with the opening ceremonies, which fell on a Friday, occurring this year on February 9), as the preliminary curling and Alpine skiing competitions \u2013 both of which aired on NBCSN \u2013 were held on the Wednesday prior to the Opening Ceremony (February 7); NBC began event coverage the following evening (February 8), with the preliminary figure skating and freestyle skiing competitions. | |- !rowspan=3| 9 | During NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics opening ceremonies, Katie Couric remarks that the Netherlands' dominance in speed skating (, the country has earned 113 speed skating medals in Olympic competition to date) is attributed to residents using skates as a form of transportation when canals freeze in Amsterdam and other sea-level Dutch communities during the winter. The statement elicited widespread mockery and some backlash on social media (including a Twitter post by the Netherlands U.S. Embassy) as being incorrect and outdated (though the International Olympic Committee does cite that the sport's origins trace to some Dutch residents skating between villages as far back as the 13th century, the mild climate of the European nation precludes the use of skating as present-day transportation). Couric apologized for the comment in a February 13 Twitter post. | |- | Gray Television announces it will acquire MyNetworkTV affiliate KCPM/Grand Forks, North Dakota from Central Plains Media for $255,000. The purchase will create a triopoly with Gray's existing stations in the Fargo\u2013Grand Forks market, NBC affiliate KVLY-TV and CBS affiliate KXJB-LD. Gray stated that it will upgrade transmitter facilities of KCPM \u2013 which will also be assigned new call letters \u2013 to extend its coverage throughout the market following the closure of the sale. | |- | YouTube announces the temporary suspension of advertising on content created by website personality Logan Paul, citing a \"pattern of behavior\" that includes showing the body of a suicide victim in a Japanese forest and applying tasers to deceased rats. Paul's videos are estimated to bring in more than $1 million in monthly income. | |- ! 11 | Joshua Cooper Ramo is removed from his role as commentator for NBC's Olympics coverage after, while noting during the opening ceremonies in Pyeongchang that Japan occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945, said \"but every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural and technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation.\" The statement received immediate backlash in South Korea as incorrect, insensitive and ignorant to the host nation's ongoing dispute with Japan. NBC issued an on-air apology for Ramo's remark. | |- !rowspan=2| 12 | In a release of the 2019 federal budget proposal submitted to Congress, for the second consecutive year, President Donald Trump proposes a two-year plan to eliminate federal funding for the nonprofit Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The administration suggests that the CPB could make up the shortfall by increasing the funding it receives from corporate sponsors, foundations and members, and the outlay to be made up for by private donations and grants at the state level; it also suggests looking at additional alternative programming for PBS, NPR and independent non-commercial broadcasting entities that have grown substantially since CPB was first established in 1967, thus greatly reducing the need for publicly funded programming. PBS president/CEO Paula Kerger responded that \"Public broadcasting has earned bipartisan congressional support over the years thanks to the value we provide to taxpayers,\" adding that the network and its 350 member stations and local supporters \"will continue to remind leaders in Washington of the significant benefits the public receives in return for federal funding, a modest investment of about $1.35 per citizen per year.\" |Trump's Budget Again Proposes Elimination of Public TV, Arts Funding from Variety (February 12, 2018)Public broadcasting chief decries proposed Trump budget cuts from The Hill (February 12, 2018) |- | Gray Television announces that it has reached an agreement to purchase CBS affiliate KGWC-TV/Casper, Wyoming from Mark III Media for an undisclosed price. The sale \u2013 which is expected to be finalized in the second quarter of 2018 \u2013 will result in Gray directly acquiring KGWC's intellectual unit (including programming \u2013 which will likely be merged into the spectrum of the company's existing Casper property, NBC affiliate KCWY-DT \u2013 and administrative operations) as well as the licenses of satellites KGWR-TV/Rock Springs and KGWL-TV/Lander, while the UHF channel 14 license will be donated to a non- profit organization to be determined (which will assign a new call sign and virtual channel number for the station). | |- ! 12\u201323 | For the weeks of February 12 and 19 during the Winter Olympics, the fourth hour of Today broadcasts live from 30 Rockefeller Plaza's Studio 6A, sharing the same studio with Megyn Kelly Today. The program's live broadcast, hosted by Kathie Lee Gifford and guest co-host Jenna Bush Hager (filling in for Hoda Kotb, who was on assignment in Pyeongchang, South Korea for the NBC morning program's coverage of the Olympics), features a live studio audience, a weekly guest disc jockey (a similar practice done by syndicated talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show), and mini bars (including the one with a dumbwaiter system to deliver its trademark drinks to Gifford and Bush Hager).

In FCC filings for the transfer, TBN withheld information on the sale price and other statistics pertaining to the November 2017 option agreement included as part of channel sharing agreements with Ion involving the four stations on grounds that it is \"proprietary, not germane to the FCC's evaluation of the application, or already in the FCC's possession.\" Another deal around the same time saw KILM/Inglewood-Los Angeles, a Multicultural Broadcasting-owned \"zombie\" carrying a brokered network known as Punch TV, also to be purchased by Ion for $10 million; KILM is under a channel sharing agreement with Ion's KPXN-TV. The latter sale closes September 17, with Ion moving the virtual channel KPXN-DT3 (carrying its Ion Life network) to KILM's virtual channel 64.1, along with gaining its must-carry coverage on local pay-TV systems. | |- ! 12 | A federal judge approves AT&T;'s $85 billion merger with Time Warner, concluding a lawsuit filed against the deal by the Department of Justice in November 2016 on grounds that the DOJ's Antitrust Division had failed to meet the burden of proof that it would harm competition and result in consumer price increases.

Comcast had been waiting on a decision in the AT&T;/Time Warner matter before proceeding with the offer. However, one week later Disney upped its bid to $71.3 billion in cash and stock, which Fox favors over Comcast; Comcast subsequently dropped its bid on July 19. 21st Century Fox and Disney shareholders approved the acquisition to the 20th Century Fox assets on July 27.

However, the network retains the right to ask for new episodes (produced by NBCUniversal); Springer later confirmed that the show was canceled, but had produced unaired shows prior to the announcement. The move comes as Tribune Broadcasting (the lessee of the timeslot until the end of the 2020\u201321 season under an agreement made at the time of its latest renewal for the network on its stations) was preparing to complete its acquisition by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which played a factor in the program not being renewed by its stations, thus hurting its clearances. | |- ! 14 | Star Trek: Discovery showrunners Aaron Harberts and Gretchen J.

The day before, Nerdist, the company which Hardwick founded, cut all ties with him. He denies the allegations. NBC later stated that it would \"assess\" developments concerning Dykstra's accusations before making decisions concerning Hardwick's gig as host of game show The Wall. On July 3, Yvette Nicole Brown was reported to be the new moderator of the Walking Dead panel, and interim host of Talking Dead 10 days later, starting with The Walking Dead Season 9 Preview Special on August 5. On July 25, AMC announced Hardwick will return as host of Talking Dead and Talking with Chris Hardwick following the completion of an investigation conducted with Ivy Kagan Bierman of law firm Loeb & Loeb. On July 31, NBC announced Hardwick will return as host of The Wall for a next season. On August 10, his name was then returned to Nerdist's website. | |- ! 18 | Laura Ingraham faces mounting criticism over comments she made on her Fox News Channel program The Ingraham Angle, in which she referred to the detention centers where children of undocumented immigrants detained and arrested at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border have been placed under Trump's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy \u2013 which has received widespread condemnation, and have been compared to internment facilities that housed Japanese Americans and German Jews \u2013 as \"essentially summer camps,\" which Ingraham attempted to walk back before the end of that night's broadcast. Hollywood producers such as Steven Levitan (who suggested, in his criticism of Fox News, he would terminate his relationship with 20th Century Fox Television after the current contract for Modern Family ends in 2019), Seth MacFarlane (who tweeted that he was \"embarrassed to work for Fox News and Fox network parent 21st Century Fox\" concerning a remark by Ingraham's Fox News colleague Tucker Carlson that viewers should dismiss reports by major news outlets as untrue), Judd Apatow and Paul Feig criticized the remarks, with many also calling for an advertiser boycott of Ingraham's show and Fox News, which defended Ingraham's remarks by stating, \"Fox News will never tolerate or give in to attempts to silence diverse viewpoints by agenda-driven intimidation efforts.\" | |- !rowspan=2| 19 | On the evening after Laura Ingraham's comments, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski makes the sad trombone sound effect during a Fox News segment focusing on a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome separated from her mother at the border.

The \"tender age\" facilities reportedly house children with special needs and those younger than 13. The story becomes too emotional for Maddow to continue, so she passes the story to Lawrence O'Donnell, who was in Texas at one of the detention facilities as he leads off the breaking news story on his program The Last Word. Maddow last apologized to viewers about what happened, saying \"If nothing else, it is my job to actually be able to speak while I'm on TV,\" she wrote. \"I apologize for losing it there for a moment.

Should regulatory approval be obtained, the combined company, which will operate under the existing Gray corporate umbrella, will \u2013 with coverage estimated at 24% of U.S. television households \u2013 become the third-largest broadcaster in terms of audience reach, owning or operating 142 full-power stations in 92 markets (its portfolio will encompass stations in markets as large as Tampa-St. Petersburg-Sarasota to as small as North Platte, although it will divest overlapping stations in nine conflict markets). Other than disclosing that an SSA involving Fox affiliate WUPW/Toledo would be transferred to the prospective buyer of CBS-affiliated sister WTOL. Post-acquisition, longtime company head Hilton H. Howell Jr. will serve as Gray's executive chairman and co-CEO, but will cede his role as company president to Raycom President/CEO Pat LaPlatney (who will also serve as a co-CEO). | |- | David Bossie, a former aide to the Trump campaign, is suspended from his contributor role at Fox News for two weeks after telling Joel Payne, an African-American Democratic strategist, he was \"out of (his) cotton-picking mind\" during a debate on Fox & Friends Weekend the previous day.

Scripps Company sells its Tulsa radio cluster (Classic Hits station KBEZ, Country station KVOO, Classic Country station KXBL, Top 40/CHR station KHTT, and News/Talk station KFAQ, all of which were co-owned with NBC affiliate KJRH-TV since Scripps's 2015 acquisition of the radio group's former parent Journal Communications) to Griffin Communications. The transaction re-enters the Oklahoma City-based television broadcaster into radio station ownership since it sold off its stations in Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Fort Smith between 1956 and 1969 (when co-founders John T. Griffin and Jimmy Leake broke up the company into two entities), and pairs the stations up with the CBS/CW duopoly of KOTV and KQCW.

Dish contended that Univision asked it to increase retransmission fees by 75%, which it felt an unreasonable offer, citing Univision's declining ratings and its failure to secure the rights to the 2018, 2022 and 2026 FIFA World Cups (the Spanish language rights of which went to rival Telemundo). Univision denies Dish's claim that it had ended negotiations, stating that \"[Dish] insists on paying Univision only a fraction of what it pays our English-language peers.\" On July 30, Dish offered subscribers of its DishLatino and Sling Latino tiers who lost access to the channels a $5 per month credit, beginning August 1. | |} ===July=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Under the terms of the deal, Nexstar concurrently assumed operational responsibilities for the station through a time brokerage agreement that will conclude upon the transaction's closure.

Pai's comments led Sinclair to amend its acquisition proposal (the fifth such instance since Sinclair disclosed its sale proposals to the Department of Justice Antitrust Division in February) to transfer Tribune flagship WGN-TV/Chicago from WGN-TV LLC (a licensee that was to have been owned by Steven Fader, a Maryland auto dealer and business associate of Sinclair executive chairman David D. Smith) to Sinclair directly, and to sell Texas-based CW affiliates KDAF/Dallas-Fort Worth and KIAH/Houston to an independent third party (rather than sell it to Cunningham Broadcasting, which, until January, had been owned by the estate of Carolyn Smith, the now- deceased mother of David Smith and widow of company founder Julian Sinclair Smith, which retains non-voting stock interest) hours prior to the merger review vote. | |- !22 |In an appearance on Showtime's Who Is America?, Georgia state lawmaker Jason Spencer exposes his bare buttocks, imitates a Chinese tourist using racial stereotypes, and repeatedly yells \"nigger\", all at the urging of a character portrayed by series star Sacha Baron Cohen.

Under the deal, WPBA will be allowed to license any PBS programs for broadcast starting in September, which will result in a roughly $500,000 per year increase in programming expenditures that will go towards licensing additional PBS content and expanding local program production. The station will inform GPB of its scheduling decisions to avoid scheduling conflicts.

The panel did not weigh the merits of the case in the two-page ruling, only judging that the interest groups involved in the case (led by Free Press) \u2013 who sued on ground that the discount would allow groups reaching near the 39% cap the ability to acquire more stations without going over it (with Sinclair Broadcast Group, which is believed to have any future acquisitions that may utilize the quota hampered amid questions by the FCC over other methods it used in its proposed merger with Tribune Media) and accelerating media consolidation in the broadcast television industry \u2013 lacked standing. The move also precedes potential FCC consideration of possibly abolishing or altering the UHF discount upon proposals to raise the cap to cover ownership coverage reaching as much as 50% of U.S. television households. | |- !26 |Personnel with KRCR-TV/Redding, California are evacuated from the Sinclair Broadcast Group-owned ABC affiliate's studio building around 10:30 p.m. PDT as flames associated with the Carr Fire (which was first reported on July 23 in the Whiskeytown\u2013Shasta\u2013Trinity National Recreation Area, and started by a vehicular mechanical failure) approached close to its facility in eastern Redding.
