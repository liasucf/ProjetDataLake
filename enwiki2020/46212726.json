During this time, a piper from the Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police Force played \"Auld Lang Syne\" from the roof of the building. The cortege then made its way down Bras Basah Road and North Bridge Road, which were lined with members of the public, to Parliament House. Lee's body lay in state at Parliament House from 25 March 2015 to 28 March 2015, which was subsequently opened 24 hours for the public to pay their respects.

Prior to the minute of silence, all MRT trains stopped at stations and opened their doors. Similarly, buses scheduled to depart from bus interchanges or terminals were held back during the one minute of silence.

In addition, four Republic of Singapore Air Force black knights made a fly pass salute. The originally planned missing man formation was not flown due to rainy weather. As his body passed Esplanade Bridge, both RSS Dauntless and RSS Resilience conducted a ceremonial sailpast. The 21-gun salute honour is traditionally only accorded to the heads of state. As Lee Kuan Yew was only a former head of government, he would typically only be entitled to a 19-gun salute. Special permission was given for the 21-gun salute to honour him. ===Notable mourners=== Notable mourners at the private wake at Sri Temasek: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Country !Title !Name |- | |Sultan of Brunei |Hassanal Bolkiah |- |rowspan=\"3\" | |Hong Kong business magnate |Li Ka-shing |- |Hong Kong businessman |Richard Li |- |Hong Kong businessman |Victor Li |- |rowspan=\"2\" | Republic of China (Taiwan) |President of the Republic of China |Ma Ying-jeou |- |Former President of Control Yuan |Fredrick Chien |- | |Australian businesswomen |Gina Rinehart |} Foreign dignitaries who paid their respects at Parliament House: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Country !Title !Dignitary |- | |Deputy Foreign Minister of Afghanistan |Hekmat Karzai |- | |Son of Crown Prince of Bahrain |Isa bin Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa |- |rowspan=\"2\" | |King of Bhutan |Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck |- |Queen of Bhutan |Jetsun Pema |- |rowspan=\"2\" | |Executive Chairman of Alibaba Group |Jack Ma4.50 pm: Chinese billionaire, founder of the Alibaba Group Jack Ma among those paying respects to Mr Lee Kuan Yew at Parliament House. |- |Vice-President of the People's Republic of China, member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China |Li Yuanchao |- |rowspan=\"9\" | |Spouse of former President of Indonesia |Ani Yudhoyono |- |Former co-ordinating Minister for Economics in the Indonesia cabinet |Chairul Tanjung |- |Former Indonesian Ambassador to the United States |Dino Patti Djalal |- |Former Foreign Minister of Indonesia |Hassan Wirajuda |- |5th President of Indonesia |Megawati Sukarnoputri |- |Former Indonesia presidential candidate |Prabowo Subianto2.45 pm: Former Indonesia presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto just arrived at Parliament House to pay his respects to the late Mr Lee. |- |Vice-chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly of Indonesia |Sapta Odang |- |6th President of Indonesia |Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono |- |Chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly of Indonesia |Zulkifli Hasan |- | |President of Israel |Reuven Rivlin |- |rowspan=\"8\" | |Malaysia Minister of Foreign Affairs |Anifah Aman |- |Former Malaysia Finance Minister |Daim Zainuddin |- |Malaysia Natural Resources and Environment Minister |G.
