    "text": "Publius Septimius Geta (c. 143 - c. 203/c. 204) was the second son to the elder Publius Septimius Geta and brother of the emperor Septimius Severus. His mother was Fulvia Pia. He was born and raised in Leptis Magna (southeast of Carthage, modern Libya, North Africa). Geta was of Berber, Libyco-Punic and Roman ancestry. This Geta was more politically active than his father. Geta was appointed one of the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, which in part involved judging lawsuits. These ten men were one of the four boards that form the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. After this Geta was commissioned a tribunus laticlavius with the Legio II Augusta, at the time stationed in Roman Britain. This was followed by the office of Aedile Cerealis, a Curator rei pub. Anconitanorum and a Praet. hastarius et tutel. Geta in 185 became a legatus of the Legio I Italica and afterwards a Proconsul of Sicily around 187/8.Paul Leunissen, Konsuln und Konsulare in der Zeit von Commodus bis Severus Alexander (Amsterdam: J.C.
