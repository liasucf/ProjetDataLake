R. & Lin, W. The Southern Annular Mode and Southern Ocean Surface Westerly Winds in E3SM. Earth Sp. Sci. 6, 2624\u20132643 (2019). The Antarctic oscillation (AAO, to distinguish it from the Arctic oscillation or AO), also known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), is a low-frequency mode of atmospheric variability of the southern hemisphere that is defined as a belt of strong westerly winds or low pressure surrounding Antarctica which moves north or south as its mode of variability.Australian Bureau of Meteorology - The Southern Annular Mode. Accessed 25/10/2013. http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/history/ln-2010-12/SAM-what.shtml It is a climate driver for Australia, influencing the country's weather conditions \u2013 It is associated with storms and cold fronts that move from west to east that bring precipitation to southern Australia.Southern Annular Mode and the Australian climate Bureau of Meteorology ==Phases and impacts== In its positive phase, the westerly wind belt that drives the Antarctic Circumpolar Current intensifies and contracts towards Antarctica. This would increase rainfall (including East coast lows) and reduce heat in south-eastern Australia in the summer due to higher onshore flows from the Pacific Ocean and, in winter, decrease snow in the alpine areas and rainfall in the far south and southwest. This phase would occur more frequently with a La Ni\u00f1a event.Southern Annular Mode Bureau of Meteorology, 12 June 2019 Its negative phase involves this belt moving towards the equator, decreasing rainfall in the southeast of Australia in the summer and as well as raising the possibility of spring heatwaves. Moreover, winters will usually be wetter than normal in the south and southwest with more snowfall in the alpine areas, but drier in the east coast due to less moist onshore flows from the east. This phase will usually be more frequent with an El Ni\u00f1o event. Winds associated with the Southern Annular Mode cause oceanic upwelling of warm circumpolar deep water along the Antarctic continental shelf, which has been linked to ice shelf basal melt, representing a possible wind-driven mechanism that could destabilize large portions of the Antarctic ice sheet. ==Research== In 2014, Nerilie Abram used a network of temperature-sensitive ice core and tree growth records to reconstruct a 1000-year history of the Southern Annular Mode. This work suggests that the Southern Annular Mode is currently in its most extreme positive phase over at least the last 1000 years, and that recent positive trends in the SAM are attributed to increasing greenhouse gas levels and later stratospheric ozone depletion. ==See also== * Anticyclone * Arctic oscillation * John Michael Wallace * North Atlantic oscillation * Pacific decadal oscillation ==References== == External links == * http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/gjma/sam.html Observation-based SAM index from 1957\u2013present * http://hurricane.ncdc.noaa.gov/pls/paleox/f?p=519:1:0::::P1_STUDY_ID:16197 1000-year Southern Annular Mode reconstruction * Monthly Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) Index or Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) Index 1850 - 2013 * Daily Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) Index or Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) Index 1948 - 2013 * http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/daily_ao_index/aao/aao.loading.shtml * https://web.archive.org/web/20081216220433/http://stratus.astr.ucl.ac.be/textbook//pdf/Chapter_5.pdf (chapter 5.2.3) *SOUTHERN ANNULAR MODE IN AUSTRALIA \u2013 What is it? * The Southern Annular Mode Introduction to climate dynamics and climate modelling, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain Category:Climate of Antarctica Category:Regional climate effects Category:Environment of Antarctica Category:Climate of Australia ",
