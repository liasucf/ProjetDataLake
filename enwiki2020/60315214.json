La Constituci\u00f3n de 1949. Antecedentes y proyecciones. San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica: Editorial Costa Rica. On January 31, 1821, the Superior Governing Junta that ruled the country provisionally held elections to elect the deputies who would represent it before the First Mexican Empire's Constituent Congress of 1822 of that would draft the Constitution of the Mexican Empire of which it was a part, at least in theory. But the Congress was dissolved by Emperor Agust\u00edn de Iturbide before the Costa Rican delegation could leave and the rebuff increased the differences between the imperialists loyal to Iturbide and the Republicans who wanted full independence. The second Superior Governing Junta was elected, which governed from January 1 to March 14, 1823 and was chaired by Jos\u00e9 Santos Lombardo y Alvarado and the Provincial Constituent Congress of Costa Rica was convened, which dictates the First Political Statute of the Province of Costa Rica on March 17 and replacing the Pact of Concord. The Statute established a triple government confirmed by a triumvirate with a Republican representative, a monarchical representative and an independent or neutral representative. The Rev. Rafael Francisco Osejo presided over the Triumvirate. The Statute also created the figure of a Congress of Representatives without specifying the nature, conformation or mode of election, granting it the right to choose the independence of the Province or its annexation to any of the American powers.Obreg\u00f3n Lor\u00eda, Rafael (1966). El Poder Legislativo en Costa Rica. San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica: Asamblea Legislativa. The Statute would work until the rebellion of the monarchist Joaqu\u00edn de Oreamuno y Mu\u00f1oz de la Trinidad on March 29, 1823, when it was abolished by the first Civil War in Costa Rica, which would be rendered useless as by its end the Iturbide Empire had fallen. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica ",
