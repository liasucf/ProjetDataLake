Marjorie Lucas (n\u00e9e Hollinshed) (1905\u20131995) was a ballet dancer and dance teacher from Queensland, Australia. She was instrumental in the development of ballet in Queensland. Born in Brisbane, she spent her teen years in Melbourne where she receive some ballet training. Upon her return to Brisbane, she became an assistant to Margaret St. Ledger at her dance school. After St. Ledger's retirement, she took over the school. At the time, most dance schools in Australia taught mixture of dances, including ballroom and theatrical. Anna Pavlova's Australian tours in 1926 and 1929 inspired teachers like Hollinshed to learn and train in classical ballet (then called operatic dancing). In 1932, she retired from teaching and passed her studio on to her pupil Phyllis Danaher. Other notable students of hers include Laurel Martyn. She went on to publish two books about ballet in Australia: In Search of Ballet (1987) and Some Professional Dancers of, or from, Queensland (1963). == References == Category:1905 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Australian ballet dancers Category:People from Brisbane Category:People from Melbourne Category:Ballet teachers ",
