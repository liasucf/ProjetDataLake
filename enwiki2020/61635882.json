    "text": "A statue of U.S. President Donald Trump was erected on private land in Sela pri Kamniku, Slovenia, in 2019. The approximately wood monument depicted Trump wearing a blue suit and a red tie, with a fierce expression and his right arm raised in a fist. A mechanism inside the statue allowed the mouth to open, revealing sharp teeth. Tomaz Schlegl, the artist behind the project, said that \"Like all populists, the statue has two faces.\" The artist intended the statue as \"a provocation, because the world is full of populism\". Former Slovenian member of parliament Igor Omerza thought it could be seen as a sign of the country's \"love-hate\" relationship with President Trump, depicting either the raised hand of the Statue of Liberty or the iron fist of a populist dictator. After complaints from residents, the statue was relocated to Morav\u010de. It was vandalised with the addition of a Hitler moustache, and later burned to the ground by unknown arsonists. ==See also== * 2019 in art * Statue of Melania Trump * The Emperor Has No Balls ==References== Category:2019 establishments in Slovenia Category:2019 sculptures Category:2019 in politics Category:Monuments and memorials in Slovenia Category:Outdoor sculptures Category:Parodies of Donald Trump Category:Political art Category:Sculptures of men Category:Statues in Slovenia Category:Statues of Donald Trump Category:Wooden sculptures Category:Destroyed sculptures ",
