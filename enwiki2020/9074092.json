    "text": "Magic is the sixth and final studio album by British hard rock band Gillan, released in October 1982. It features eight original songs, mostly co-written by Ian Gillan and Colin Towns, and a cover of Stevie Wonder's 1973 hit single \"Living for the City\". This cover was released as a 7\" single, in both picture-bag and picture-disc editions, and was accompanied by a promotional video. Although the album was generally accepted by Gillan's staunch UK following, it failed to achieve the chart success of Glory Road or Future Shock, peaking at No. 17 in the UK chart. Allegedly, many of the album's lyrics cryptically predict the end of the band. Magic was reissued in 1989 and in 2007 with seven bonus tracks, including cover versions and B-sides. ==Track listing== *All songs written by Ian Gillan and Colin Towns except where noted. ;Side one # \"What's the Matter\" (Gillan, John McCoy, Janick Gers) \u2013 3:33 # \"Bluesy Blue Sea\" (Gillan, Gers) \u2013 4:48 # \"Caught in a Trap\" \u2013 3:34 # \"Long Gone\" \u2013 3:59 # \"Driving Me Wild\" \u2013 3:05 ;Side two # * \"Demon Driver\" \u2013 7:15 # \"Living a Lie\" \u2013 4:27 # \"You're So Right\" (Gillan, McCoy) \u2013 2:55 # \"Living for the City\" (Stevie Wonder) \u2013 4:27 # \"Demon Driver (reprise)\" \u2013 0:42 ==1989 Re-release bonus tracks== In 1989 Virgin re-released the album in CD format.
