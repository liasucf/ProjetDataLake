Anthony McCall (born 1946) is a British-born New York based artist known for his \u2018solid-light\u2019 installations, a series that he began in 1973 with \"Line Describing a Cone,\" in which a volumetric form composed of projected light slowly evolves in three-dimensional space. Occupying a space between cinema, sculpture, and drawing, his work's historical importance has been recognised in such exhibitions as \"Into the Light: the Projected Image in American Art 1964\u201377,\u201d Whitney Museum of American Art (2001\u201302); \"The Expanded Screen: Actions and Installations of the Sixties and Seventies,\u201d Museum Moderner Kunst, Vienna (2003\u201304); \"The Expanded Eye,\" Kunsthaus Zurich (2006); \"Beyond Cinema: the Art of Projection,\u201d Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (2006\u201307); \"The Cinema Effect: Illusion, Reality and the Projected Image,\u201d Hirshhorn Museum, Washington DC (2008); and \"On Line: Drawing Through the Twentieth Century,\u201d Museum of Modern Art (2010\u201311). ==Career== McCall studied graphic design and photography at Ravensbourne College of Art and Design, Bromley, Kent, England from 1964 to 1968. McCall was a key figure in the avant-garde London Film-makers Co-operative in the 1970s. His earliest films are documents of outdoor performances that were notable for their minimal use of the elements, most notably fire.[1] After moving to New York in 1973, McCall continued his fire performances and developed his 'solid light' film series, beginning with Line Describing a Cone, in 1973. Based on simple, animated line-drawings, these projections strikingly emphasise the sculptural qualities of a beam of light. In darkened, haze-filled rooms, the projections create an illusion of three-dimensional shapes, ellipses, waves and flat planes that gradually expand, contract or sweep through space. In these works, the artist sought to deconstruct cinema by reducing film to its principle components of time and light and removing the screen entirely as the prescribed surface for projection. The works also shift the relationship of the audience to film, as viewers become participants, their bodies intersecting and modifying the transitory forms. At the end of the 1970s, McCall withdrew from making art. Some twenty years later, he acquired a new dynamic and re-opened his 'solid light' series, this time using digital animation and digital projection rather than 16mm film.[1] The first of the new works, \"Doubling Back\" (2003) was exhibited at the 2004 Whitney Biennial. McCall developed the use of a slow-moving cinematic \u2018wipe\u2019 to combine and separate two opposing forms within one volumetric object; the new works also explored the extended cyclical \u2018installation\u2019 structure that he had first developed in the film-based work of the seventies. New installations included \"You and I, Horizontal\" (2006), \"Leaving, with Two-Minute Silence\" (2009), and \"Face to Face\" (2013). Anthony McCall. \"Between You and I\" (2006).

McCall also developed a parallel series of vertically oriented works, starting with \"Breath\" (2004) in which a projector mounted on the ceiling projects directly downwards onto the floor, creating a ten-metre-tall, tent-like, almost architectural enclosure with a 4-metre wide base. Other vertical works included \"Between You and I\" (2006), \"Meeting You Halfway\" (2009), and \"Coupling\" (2009). The first survey exhibition of McCall's work in an international institution took place at the Serpentine Gallery London, in 2007-8. This included early performance films, horizontal solid light works, and works on paper. The vertical works were first exhibited as a solo show (\"Breath: The Vertical Works\u201d) at Hangar Bicocca, Milan in 2009. The horizontal and vertical works were combined in a solo show at Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (\"Five Minutes of Pure Sculpture\") in 2012. McCall has recently embarked on a new series, which use slanting beams, projected from ceiling-to-floor at a 45-degree angle. Originating from two widely separated projectors mounted on the ceiling, the beams converge at the floor, creating a single, superimposed \u2018footprint\u2019. Works include \"Coming About\" (2016) and the four-projector installation, \"Crossing\" (2016). == Selected exhibitions and screenings== === Solo exhibitions and screenings=== * Artists Space, New York, 1974, 1976 * The Clocktower, New York, 1974. * Collective for Living Cinema, New York, 1974, 1975 * London Film-Makers\u2019 Cooperative, London, 1974, 1975 * Millennium Film Workshop, New York, 1974, 1976 * Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, England, 1974. * Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, 1975. * Serpentine Gallery, London, 1975. * Mus\u00e9e Nationale d\u2019Art Moderne, Paris, 1976. * The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1976 * Centre Pompidou / Fondation Antoine de Galbert, Paris, 2004. * Tate Britain, London, 2004. * Museu d\u2019Art Contemporani de Barcelona, 2005. * Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt, 2005. * Mus\u00e9e D\u00e9partemental d\u2019Art Contemporain, Rochechouart, France, 2007. * Serpentine Gallery, London, 2007\u20132008. * Hangar Bicocca, Milan, 2009. * Moderna Museet, Stockholm, 2009. * Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, 2012. * Tate Tanks, London, 2012. * , Die Lokremise, Switzerland, 2013. * Les Abattoirs, Toulouse, 2013. * Eye Film Museum, Amsterdam, 2014. * LAC Lugano Arte e Cultura, Lugano, Switzerland, 2015. * Milwaukee Art Museum, Wisconsin, 2015. * Fundaci\u00f3 Gaspar, Barcelona, Spain, 2016. ===Group exhibitions=== Gallery House, London, 1972.
