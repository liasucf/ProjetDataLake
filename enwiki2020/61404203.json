More success came in the cups. In Stanley's first ever game in the Football League Cup, third-tier Nottingham Forest were beaten 1\u20130. This set an away tie to Premier League team Watford, who needed a penalty shootout to eliminate the Lancashire club. The club also performed well in the Football League trophy, reaching the area quarter-finals before being eliminated by Doncaster Rovers. ==First-team squad== :Squad at end of seasonhttp://www.footballsquads.co.uk/eng/2006-2007/fltwo/accring.htm ===Left club during season=== ==References== ==Notes== Category:Accrington Stanley F.C. seasons Accrington Stanley F.C.
