She is the youngest in a family of five, with three brothers and one sister. She is of Jamaican, Chinese and Cuban descent. Her mother is Jamaican, her father has Cuban heritage andh er grandfather is Chinese from a family descending from the name Chang. Before appearing as a contestant on The X Factor, Lawson was a client of Active Music Management, who obtained her first record deal with President Records and her first publishing deal. Her first single, \"A Night to Remember,\" was used in a Gala Bingo advertisement. Lawson was signed to Peer Music Publishing from 2002 to 2005 and started her career as a singer-songwriter. During that time she worked with established producer David Brant, who produced three tracks for her, \"Rush\", \"I Wanna Say Yes\" and \"Inferno\". During her time as a singer- songwriter, she worked with recording artist Gabrielle and performed on Gabrielle's hit singles \"Out of Reach\" (as featured in the Bridget Jones' Diary soundtrack), \"Don't Need the Sun to Shine (to Make Me Smile)\" and the live version of \"Rise\". She has also provided backing vocals for many other artists, including Kelly Clarkson, Anita Baker and British soul singer Lemar. ==Music career== ===1997\u20131999: Singer for Italian group Ti.Pi.Cal=== In 1997, Lawson, known as Kimara Lawson in Italy, achieved chart success with several singles in collaboration with Italian dance group Ti.Pi.Cal. (Daniele Tignino, Riccardo Piparo and Vincenzo Callea). With Ti.Pi.Cal, Lawson recorded \"Hidden Passion\" (1997), \"Live For Today (1997), \"Follow Your Heart\" (1998), \"Music Is My Life\" (1999) and What I Like (2006), and two singles as Kimara Lawson - Stand up (2000) & Heaven (2000). ===2004\u201305: The X Factor=== Lawson auditioned for the first series of The X Factor in 2004, but she was rejected by judge Simon Cowell after reaching the \"bootcamp\" rounds. In 2005 she auditioned for the second series of the show. According to Lawson's 2008 autobiography Life Starts Now, in her audition for the second series, Cowell immediately remembered her from the previous year and told her he had \"made a mistake\" in not putting her through to the live shows. Her rendition of \"Stop\" by Sam Brown stormed Lawson through to bootcamp with Sharon Osbourne emerging as her new mentor. After successful performances at bootcamp and at the Osbourne household in Los Angeles, Lawson was given a chance to sing in the live stages of the show as part of Osbourne's final four. In the early stages of the live shows, Lawson was hotly tipped with performances of \"Piece of My Heart\" and \"You're Beautiful\" Her vocals, image and earthy charisma made her one of the favourites alongside eventual winner Shayne Ward. Lawson was many bookmakers' favourites to win prior to the week she was eliminated from the show. In Lawson's 2008 autobiography, she mentions she received the highest number of public votes on week four when she covered the James Blunt hit \"You're Beautiful\". ====Performances on The X Factor==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

After the public vote, Lawson found herself in the bottom two for the first time with Irish girl group The Conway Sisters. According to voting figures published in the Sunday Mirror, Lawson turned out to have received twice as many public votes as the Conway Sisters, but was nevertheless eliminated by the judges after a sing-off in the final showdown. Her mentor, Sharon Osbourne, said that she was a victim of the \"Irish Mafia\", referring to Irish judge Louis Walsh's decision to vote in favour of the Irish act at Lawson's expense. This caused a media uproar and Walsh threatened to quit the show after days of negative press. Lawson's elimination was also a shock for bookmakers who had her as a 66\u20131 outsider to leave the programme. ===Post-X Factor: Maria Lawson=== After Lawson was eliminated from the show, she was approached by at least three major record labels.
