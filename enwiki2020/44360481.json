His most important work was on the marine invertebrate fossils of the formations of Algarrobo, Arauco and Navidad. Tavera's work contributed to an increased understanding of the stratigraphy of Chile, for example by defining Ranquil Formation in 1942. Along with Charles Darwin, Juan Br\u00fcggen and Gustav Steinmann he is one of the prominent geologists to have studied Navidad Formation in Central Chile. The species Paulckella taverai is named after him. ==References== Category:Chilean geologists Category:Chilean paleontologists Category:Paleozoologists Category:1917 births Category:1991 deaths Category:20th-century Chilean people Category:20th-century geologists Category:20th-century zoologists ",
