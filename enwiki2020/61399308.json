The collection features a sonically diverse reworking of the tracks from R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol's third studio album, Solace. Solace Remixes was released on 6 September 2019. When asked what inspired the album, the band said \"We've always loved people being able to put their own spin on our music in a new context. It felt like at this point we were able to get in touch with some of the artists we admire and it seemed like an opportunity not to be missed. It allowed some more dance-orientated artists to create special moments for dance floors around the world.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 69 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | 6 September 2019 | | Rose Avenue | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 25 October 2019 | | Sony | 19075986432 |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol albums Category:Remix albums by Australian artists ",
