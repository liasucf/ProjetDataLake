It existed as early as the 12th century and had a mill owned by the convent in Riseberga. It was the regional centre of trade until the founding of Askersund. The first Swedish female aviator, Elsa Andersson, died at age 24 outside \u00c5mmeberg during a parachute jump 22 January 1922 (her third ever). According to local tradition Queen Christina of Sweden was to confer upon \u00c5mmeberg city privileges, but her carriage broke down in Askersund, and the queen who preferred not travel any further decided that Askersund was to have the city rights. It was the port of the mining industry in Zinkgruvan, an industry started by a Belgian company Vieille Montagne 1857. The mine belongs to Lundin Mining since June 2004. It is the summerhome of former Sweden's ambassador to Switzerland, the novelist Jan M\u00e5rtenson, and has a small harbour and a seaside-golf course. == References == Category:Populated lakeshore places in Sweden Category:Populated places in \u00d6rebro County Category:Populated places in Askersund Municipality ",
