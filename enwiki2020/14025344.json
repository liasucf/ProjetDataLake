    "text": "Vegas 96 is a triple live album from the American jam band Phish, recorded live at the Aladdin Theatre in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 6, 1996. In addition to the 3-CD set, a limited edition box version also includes a DVD with archival footage from the show and an extensive 40-page bound-book featuring photos and notes. The show features a large amount of extended improvisation on Phish classics such as \"Harry Hood\" and \"Weekapaug Groove\", as well as a cover of Frank Zappa's \"Peaches en Regalia\". The encore features a half-hour version of \"Harpua\" with guest appearances from Les Claypool and Larry LaLonde of the band Primus, John McEuen of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, actor Courtney Gains from Children of the Corn, a group of Elvis impersonators, and a pair known as the \"Yodeling Cowgirls\", who performed \"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\", accompanied by John McEuen of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on a pedal-steel guitar. The Yodeling Cowgirls, from Phoenix, Arizona, are Heather August and Anamieke Carrozza, who had met Phish at their Phoenix concert days earlier. In addition to being a CD release, this concert is available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com.
