    "text": "Chapel-en-le-Frith railway station (formerly Chapel-en-le-Frith South) serves the town of Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, England. It is south east of Manchester Piccadilly on the Buxton Line from Manchester. It was built in 1863 for the London & North Western Railway on its line from Whaley Bridge to Buxton. as an extension of the Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway. In 1867, the Midland Railway built a station (known as Chapel-en-le-Frith Central) on the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee line from Millers Dale to Chinley. The town therefore had a main line connection from Manchester to London featuring expresses such as the 'Palatine' and the 'Peaks'. However, with the closure of the ex Midland route from Chinley to Rowsley to passenger traffic in 1967, Central station was closed. The Midland line is still in-situ and used for freight to and from Peak Forest. The station is one of very few to retain its walkway to cross between platforms, most stations having had footbridges installed. The prime reason for this is the requirement to provide a vehicular crossing for those houses further up the hill which have no reliable alternative, as the very rough alternative is blocked for days during snow, and even when open requires a considerable extra distance to be covered to reach Chapel Town Centre. A footbridge would therefore not be used. The former station master's house was used as a restaurant called \"Brief Encounter\" but has been refurbished and is being used as a band room for Chapel-en-le-Frith Town Band.High Peak Borough Council Licensing details, accessed 13-102-2010 ==Facilities== The station is unstaffed but has a ticket machine which also allows the collection of pre- booked tickets. There are waiting shelters on both platforms and train running information is provided by automated announcements, CIS displays, timetable poster boards and a customer help point on platform 1. Step-free access is available to both sides via the foot crossing at the Whaley Bridge end of the station.Chapel-en-le-Frith station facilities National Rail Enquiries; retrieved 19 May 2017 ==Service== There is generally a half hourly service each day to Manchester Piccadilly northbound all week.
