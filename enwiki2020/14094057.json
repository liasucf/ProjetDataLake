    "text": "The 2002 season was the Carolina Panthers' eighth in the National Football League and their first under head coach John Fox. They tried to improve upon their 1\u201315 record in 2001, and make it to the playoffs for the second time in franchise history. The Panthers would improve six games, but they still failed to make the playoffs, despite moving from the NFC West to the more geographically accurate NFC South, finishing 7\u20139, five games behind the division champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ==Offseason== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
