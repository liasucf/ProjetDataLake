    "text": "The Robinson River is a river in the West Coast Region of the South Island of New Zealand. It is a tributary of the Upper Grey River and much of the river lies within the Lake Sumner Conservation Park. Rising on the slopes of Mount Boscawen () on the main divide about south of the Lewis Pass, the river runs west-southwest along a straight, narrow valley before turning northwest to reach the Upper Grey.New Zealand 1:50000 Topographic Map Series sheet BU22 \u2013 Lake SumnerNew Zealand 1:50000 Topographic Map Series sheet BT22 \u2013 Springs Junction Some older maps show the river as the Marchant River or the Marchant Robinson River. A two-day tramping track known as the Robinson River track runs up the Robinson River before crossing a saddle via a poled route to join with the Lake Christabel track. There are two tramping huts maintained by the Department of Conservation beside the river. The river is named for a superintendent of Nelson Province, John Perry Robinson (1809\u20131865).Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th edition, 1979 p. 377 ==References== Category:Rivers of the West Coast, New Zealand Category:Rivers of New Zealand ",
