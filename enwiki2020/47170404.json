    "text": "Constantin Sion (1796-1862) was a Moldavian chronicler. The fifth son of court official (ba\u0219ceau\u0219) Iordache Sion and his wife Catrina (n\u00e9e Danu), he was the descendant of free peasants (r\u0103ze\u0219i). He was educated at Ia\u0219i and knew Greek well. His positions included copyist at the treasury, messenger (ceau\u0219) and guildmaster (staroste) at Foc\u0219ani, estate manager in the Putna area and head of the Foc\u0219ani public administration. His promotions ceased under Mihail Sturdza and Grigore Alexandru Ghica, leading to a feeling that he had been wronged. Together with his brothers Antohi and Costache, he composed the forged Izvodul lui Cl\u0103n\u0103u or Chronicle of Huru. This was meant to prove the Sions' noble origin, and included an imaginary family tree. The brothers vehemently opposed the Union of the Principalities that occurred near the end of Constantin's life; the latter saw it as a \"fools' project\". His most noteworthy work, itself replete with fictitious or semi-fictitious genealogies,Lucian Boia, History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness, Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p.48 was Arhondologia Moldovei,Paharnicul Constantin Sion, Arhondologia Moldovei.
