He plays internationally for the Central African Republic. He plays as a defensively-minded central midfielder. ==Club career== ===Royal Antwerp=== In 2007, Gbarssin signed a two-year contract with Royal Antwerp, with the option of an extra year. After two successful seasons with the Belgian club, he attracted the attention of several top-flight French and Belgian clubs. Italian club Bologna submitted a bid for Gbarssin, but Antwerp did not allow him to leave. This led to several off-field problems which meant that Gbarssin was left on the bench for the majority of the 2009\u201310 season. ===Bologna=== Marco was released in the summer of 2010 and joined Bologna for the whole of pre-season. The club was subsequently acquired by new owners, who cancelled the contracts of all the players signed in the summer by the previous management.http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/855949?cc=5739 ===FC Fredericia=== Finding himself without a contract, Marco signed a short-term deal with Danish club FC Fredericia in order to get some first-team football and maintain match fitness. ===Carlisle United=== On 31 December 2010, Gbarssin signed a one-month contract with Carlisle United. Carlisle manager Greg Abbott told the club website: \"Marco has done really well during the last three weeks and he's one we've managed to sneak under the radar. He's played to a good standard abroad and was recommended to me by a good friend of mine who told me he was worth a look. He's a really tough, solid but capable player who rarely gives the ball away. This month will show us whether he is capable of kicking on to the next level and if he manages that, he'll reward himself by earning a longer contract.\" International clearance was received on 6 January 2011 and on 31 January Gbarssin signed a deal to stay at Carlisle until the end of the season. In a surprise move, on 4 March 2011 Gbarssin joined Carlisle's League 1 rivals Walsall on a loan deal until the end of April.
