    "text": "The award is named to honor the late Buck Buchanan. The Buck Buchanan Award is awarded annually to the most outstanding defensive player in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) of college football, and was first given in 1995 after the Walter Payton Award was designated solely for offensive players. It was named in honor of the late National Football League (NFL) player Junious \"Buck\" Buchanan, who starred at Grambling State University. Buchanan was an All-American defensive lineman and the first overall pick in the 1963 American Football League (AFL) Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. Up until 2015, the Payton and Buchanan Awards were awarded by The Sports Network. Since STATS LLC acquired The Sports Network in February 2015, it has presented all of the major FCS awards. Through the 2011 season, the awards were presented the night before the NCAA Division I Football Championship, but the 2012 awards were presented on December 17, nearly three weeks before that season's championship game. Cal Poly (2004, 2005, 2006) and Montana (2007, 2015, 2019) are the only programs with three (3) winners. Appalachian State (1995\u20131996), Eastern Washington (2008, 2010), James Madison (2001, 2009), Montana State (2012-2013), and Western Illinois (1998, 2000), are the only schools to win the award twice (2). Dexter Coakley of Appalachian State is the only player to win the award twice (2). ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Year !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Winner !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| School!! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Position |- | 1995 || || Appalachian State || LB |- | 1996 || (2) || Appalachian State || LB |- | 1997 || ||North Carolina A&T; || DE |- | 1998 || || Western Illinois || LB |- | 1999 || || Troy State || DT |- | 2000 || || Western Illinois || LB |- | 2001 || || James Madison || LB |- | 2002 || || Bethune\u2013Cookman || CB |- | 2003 || || Idaho State || DE |- | 2004 || || Cal Poly || LB |- | 2005 || || Cal Poly || DE |- | 2006 || || Cal Poly || LB |- | 2007 || || Montana || DE |- | 2008 || || Eastern Washington || DE |- | 2009 || || James Madison || DE |- | 2010 || || Eastern Washington || LB |- | 2011 || || New Hampshire || LB |- | 2012 || || Montana State || DE |- | 2013 || || Montana State || DE |- | 2014 || || North Dakota State || DE |- | 2015 || || Montana || DE |- | 2016 || || Northern Iowa || DE |- | 2017 || || Jacksonville State || DE |- | 2018 || || Southeast Missouri State || LB |- | 2019 || || Montana || LB |} ==References== ==External links== *Buck Buchanan Award - Past winners from The Sports Network Category:College football national player awards Category:Awards established in 1995 ",
