    "text": "\"Violence\" is a song by Canadian musician Grimes and American DJ i_o. It was released on September 5, 2019, as the second single from her fifth studio album Miss Anthropocene. ==Background== On September 3, 2019, the singer teased the release by posting a painting of an angelic figure whose hands touch a sword pierced into a planet resembling earth. She also blanked the remainder of her Instagram page. The post was accompanied by the caption \"A new way to die! 2 days.\" which led publications to believe it would be the name of the song. However, she clarified the actual song title a day later. Another post in anticipation of the release read \"There were Humans and Gods and nothing but Angels in between.\" ==Critical reception== Selim Bulut of Dazed Digital described the track as \"a more ethereal piece of electro-pop, driven by a thumping kickdrum and synth arp bassline\". Jem Aswad at Variety spoke of the song as a \"synth-driven, soft-focus collaboration with DJ i_o\". Writing for Uproxx, Derrick Rossignol noted that \"it's an engaging piece of atmospheric but dance-ready electronic pop\" and compared it to some of her previous works. In his review of Grimes' album, Miss Anthropocene, Anna Richmond described \"Violence\" as a song about \"an abusive relationship, [...] only understood as being sung by the actual Earth to the very crisis of climate change\" and, sonically, \"four-to-the-floor trance with a Madonna-esque vocal melody\". Rhian Daly of NME described the record as \"pulsating, intergalactic rave-pop\". The song appeared on PAPER Magazine's list of the \"10 Songs You Need To Start Your Weekend Right\", where the writer, Michael Love Michael, described it as \"a bouncy synthpop track that feels like equal parts Britney Spears club hit and PSA for toxic relationships and/or climate change\". ==Music video== The music video for \"Violence\" was released through Grimes' YouTube channel alongside the song's official release on September 5, 2019. It was directed by Grimes herself. The video begins with the singer reading The Art of War by Sun Tzu which would predict the outcome of the video. Later on March 15, 2020, the cover of the book got censored due to copyright claims made by that specific edition publishing company. Grimes is then seen performing dances among a group of female warriors whose movements mimic war combats. She is dressed in a \"silver, futuristic dress\" from Iris Van Herpen's fall 2019 couture collection throughout the video. Variety compared the visuals to a \"a supermodel session in the 1990s\". The video features choreography inspired by TikTok user Cindy, and was filmed inside the Vibiana Cathedral. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * Grimes \u2013 vocals, production * Garrett Lockhart \u2013 production * Tom Norris \u2013 mixing ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019\u20132020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 31 |- |} ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:4AD singles Category:Grimes (musician) songs Category:Synth-pop songs Category:Electropop songs Category:Trance songs ",
