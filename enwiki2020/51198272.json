All of these zails were dominated by Pathan tribes. The Gigyani tribe was prominent in the Matta and Ambadher zails. The Daudzai tribe was prominent in the zails of Gulbela, Shah Alam, Charpariza and Daudzai. The Sulaimanzai tribe was prominent in the Ambadher zail. The Bahlolzai was prominent in the Gulbela zail. There was also a certain Mohmand presence in Gulbela zail. ==Towns== Two locations in Doaba Daudzai were officially classified as 'towns', Fort Shankargarh and Fort Michni. According to the 1881 census of British India, Fort Shankargarh had 1,367 inhabitants (879 male, 488 female) and Fort Michni had 208 inhabitants (205 male, 3 female). ==Mafis== There were 329 (grants of lands free of revenue) linked to mosques in the tehsil. Covering a combined area of 528 acres, none of the mosque extended more than 10 acres. There were also 6 Hindu , granted by Sikh rulers for an extended period of time. ==Abolition== The Doaba Daudzai tehsil was abolished as per the Punjab Gazette Notifications 379 and 380, issued on 13 May 1893. The areas of the erstwhile Doaba Daudzai tehsil were divided between the Peshawar and Charsadda tehsils. ==References== Category:History of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:History of Punjab Category:Peshawar District ",
