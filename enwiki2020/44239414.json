The content of each story varies, and there are actually over 40, however, due to the influence of the priest Shinran's legends, the following seven became the most famous. The Upsidedown Bamboo Niigata-Shi, Chuuou-Ku, Toyano 3-Chome, Saihou Temple. National Natural Monument. Natural Monument designated title: \u9ce5\u5c4b\u91ce\u9006\u30c0\u30b1\u306e\u85ea\uff08\u3068\u3084\u306e\u3055\u304b\u3055\u3060\u3051\u306e\u3084\u3076\uff09Toyano Flipped Bamboo Shrub. This is a bamboo shoot whose bows grow downward. It is said that it planted its roots when Shinran stuck his bamboo walking stick into the ground upside down. The upside down bamboo is a variation of Henon Bamboo, however the way in which its branches hang is different to all others. It is an extremely rare natural deformity and was made a National Natural Monument on October 12, 1922 (the 11th year of the Taisho era). However, in recent times it isn't looked after very much, and one must reference the sole example specimen which is preserved at the Saihou Temple. The grounds of the Saihou Temple are viewed as sacred and so people cannot enter. It is also said that there was once a custom to occasionally hand out branches that were cut from the bamboo to families who supported the shrine (Danka), and this is thought to have contributed to the decrease in number of the upside down bamboo. Also, there are various other stories concerning that subject. Around the time it became valued as a rare item, around the 12th and 13th years of the Showa Era, an elder of the Saihou Temple... tbc The Burnt Carp The Bundle of Eight Plums The Prayer Beads on the Cherry Blossom The Triple Chestnut The Threaded Nutmeg Tree The Incomplete Reed Category:Culture in Niigata Prefecture Category:Japanese short story collections ",
