    "text": "In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, locally convex topological vector spaces (LCTVS) or locally convex spaces are examples of topological vector spaces (TVS) that generalize normed spaces. They can be defined as topological vector spaces whose topology is generated by translations of balanced, absorbent, convex sets. Alternatively they can be defined as a vector space with a family of seminorms, and a topology can be defined in terms of that family. Although in general such spaces are not necessarily normable, the existence of a convex local base for the zero vector is strong enough for the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem to hold, yielding a sufficiently rich theory of continuous linear functionals. Fr\u00e9chet spaces are locally convex spaces that are completely metrizable (with a choice of complete metric). They are generalizations of Banach spaces, which are complete vector spaces with respect to a metric generated by a norm. == History == Metrizable topologies on vector spaces have been studied since their introduction in Maurice Fr\u00e9chet's 1902 PhD thesis Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel (wherein the notion of a metric was first introduced). After the notion of a general topological space was defined by Felix Hausdorff in 1914,Hausdorff, F. Grundz\u00fcge der Mengenlehre (1914) although locally convex topologies were implicitly used by some mathematicians, up to 1934 only John von Neumann would seem to have explicitly defined the weak topology on Hilbert spaces and strong operator topology on operators on Hilbert spaces.von Neumann, J. Collected works. Vol II. p.94-104Dieudonne, J. History of Functional Analysis Chapter VIII. Section 1. Finally, in 1935 von Neumann introduced the general definition of a locally convex space (called a convex space by him).von Neumann, J. Collected works. Vol II. p.508-527Dieudonne, J. History of Functional Analysis Chapter VIII. Section 2. A notable example of a result which had to wait for the development and dissemination of general locally convex spaces (amongst other notions and results, like nets, the product topology and Tychonoff's theorem) to be proven in its full generality, is the Banach\u2013Alaoglu theorem which Stefan Banach first established in 1932 by an elementary diagonal argument for the case of separable normed spacesBanach, S. Theory of linear operations p.75. Ch. VIII. Sec. 3. Theorem 4., translated from Theorie des operations lineaires (1932) (in which case the unit ball of the dual is metrizable). == Definition == Suppose is a vector space over , a subfield of the complex numbers (normally itself or ). A locally convex space is defined either in terms of convex sets, or equivalently in terms of seminorms. === Definition via convex sets === A subset in is called # Convex if for all in , and is in . In other words, contains all line segments between points in . # Circled if for all in , is in if . If , this means that is equal to its reflection through the origin. For , it means for any in , contains the circle through , centred on the origin, in the one-dimensional complex subspace generated by . # A cone (when the underlying field is ordered) if for all in and is in . # Balanced if for all in , is in if . If , this means that if is in , contains the line segment between and . For , it means for any in , contains the disk with on its boundary, centred on the origin, in the one- dimensional complex subspace generated by . Equivalently, a balanced set is a circled cone. # Absorbent or absorbing if for every in , there exists such that is in for all satisfying . The set can be scaled out by any \"large\" value to absorb every point in the space. #* In any TVS, every neighborhood of the origin is absorbent. # Absolutely convex or a disk if it is both balanced and convex. This is equivalent to it being closed under linear combinations whose coefficients absolutely sum to ; such a set is absorbent if it spans all of . Definition: A topological vector space is called locally convex if the origin has a neighborhood basis (i.e. a local base) consisting of convex sets. In fact, every locally convex TVS has a neighborhood basis of the origin consisting of absolutely convex sets (i.e. disks), where this neighborhood basis can further be chosen to also consist entirely of open sets or entirely of closed sets. Every TVS has a neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of balanced sets but only a locally convex TVS has a neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of sets that are both balanced and convex. Note that it is possible for a TVS to have some neighborhoods of the origin that are convex and yet not be locally convex. Because translation is (by definition of \"topological vector space\") continuous, all translations are homeomorphisms, so every base for the neighborhoods of the origin can be translated to a base for the neighborhoods of any given vector. === Definition via seminorms === A seminorm on is a map such that 1. is positive or positive semidefinite: ; 2. is positive homogeneous or positive scalable: for every scalar . So, in particular, ; 3. is subadditive. It satisfies the triangle inequality: . If satisfies positive definiteness, which states that if then , then is a norm. While in general seminorms need not be norms, there is an analogue of this criterion for families of seminorms, separatedness, defined below. :Definition: If is a vector space and is a family of seminorms on then a subset of is called a base of seminorms for if for all there exists a and a real such that . :Definition (second version): A locally convex space is defined to be a vector space along with a family of seminorms on . ==== Seminorm topology ==== Suppose that is a vector space over , where is either the real or complex numbers, and let (resp. ) denote the open (resp. closed) ball of radius in . A family of seminorms on vector space induces a canonical vector space topology on , called the initial topology induced by the seminorms, making it into a topological vector space (TVS). By definition, it is the coarsest topology on for which all maps in are continuous. That the vector space operations are continuous in this topology follows from properties 2 and 3 above. It can easily be seen that the resulting topological vector space is \"locally convex\" in the sense of the first definition given above because each is absolutely convex and absorbent (and because the latter properties are preserved by translations). Note that it is possible for a locally convex topology on a space to be induced by a family of norms but for to not be normable (that is, to have its topology be induced by a single norm). ===== Basis and subbasis ===== Suppose that is a family of seminorms on that induces a locally convex topology \ud835\udf0f on . A subbasis at the origin is given by all sets of the form p^{-1}\\left( B_{ as ranges over and ranges over the positive real numbers. A base at the origin is given by the collection of all possible finite intersections of such subbasis sets. Recall that the topology of a TVS is translation invariant, meaning that if is any subset of containing the origin then for any , is a neighborhood of 0 if and only if is a neighborhood of ; thus it suffices to define the topology at the origin. A base of neighborhoods of for this topology is obtained in the following way: for every finite subset of and every , let :U_{F, r}(y) := \\left\\\\{ x \\in X : p(x - y) < r \\ \\text{ for all } p \\in F \\right\\\\}. ===== Bases of seminorms and saturated families ===== :Definition: If is a locally convex space and if is a collection of continuous seminorms on , then is called a base of continuous seminorms if it is a base of seminorms for the collection of all continuous seminorms on . * Explicitly, this means that for all continuous seminorms on , there exists a and a real such that . If is a base of continuous seminorms for a locally convex TVS then the family of all sets of the form \\left\\\\{ x \\in X : q\\left( x \\right) < r \\right\\\\} as varies over and varies over the positive real numbers, is a base of neighborhoods of the origin in (not just a subbasis, so there is no need to take finite intersections of such sets). :Definition: A family of seminorms on a vector space is called saturated if for any and in , the seminorm defined by x \\mapsto \\max \\\\{ p(x), q(x) \\\\} belongs to . If is a saturated family of continuous seminorms that induces the topology on then the collection of all sets of the form } as ranges over and ranges over all positive real numbers, forms a neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of convex open sets; note that this forms a basis at the origin rather than merely a subbasis so that in particular, there is no need to take finite intersections of such sets. ====== Basis of norms ====== The following theorem implies that if is a locally convex space then the topology of can be a defined by a family of continuous norms on (a norm is an injective seminorm) if and only if there exists at least one continuous norm on . If there exists a continuous norm on a topological vector space then is necessarily Hausdorff but the converse is not in general true (not even for locally convex spaces or Fr\u00e9chet spaces). ===== Nets ===== Suppose that the topology of a locally convex space is induced by a family of continuous seminorms on . If and if is a net in , then in if and only if for all , . Moreover, if is Cauchy in , then so is for every . === Equivalence of definitions === Although the definition in terms of a neighborhood base gives a better geometric picture, the definition in terms of seminorms is easier to work with in practice. The equivalence of the two definitions follows from a construction known as the Minkowski functional or Minkowski gauge. The key feature of seminorms which ensures the convexity of their -balls is the triangle inequality. For an absorbing set such that if is in , then is in whenever , define the Minkowski functional of to be :\\mu_C(x) = \\inf \\\\{\\lambda > 0: x\\in \\lambda C\\\\}. From this definition it follows that is a seminorm if is balanced and convex (it is also absorbent by assumption). Conversely, given a family of seminorms, the sets :\\left \\\\{x : p_{\\alpha_1}(x) < \\varepsilon_1, \\ldots, p_{\\alpha_n}(x) < \\varepsilon_n \\right \\\\} form a base of convex absorbent balanced sets. === Ways of defining a locally convex topology === == Further definitions == == Sufficient conditions == ;Hahn-Banach extension property Let be a TVS. Say that a vector subspace of has the extension property if any continuous linear functional on can be extended to a continuous linear functional on . Say that has the Hahn- Banach extension property (HBEP) if every vector subspace of has the extension property. The Hahn-Banach theorem guarantees that every Hausdorff locally convex space has the HBEP. For complete metrizable TVSs there is a converse: If a vector space has uncountable dimension and if we endow it with the finest vector topology then this is a TVS with the HBEP that is neither locally convex or metrizable. == Properties == Throughout, is a family of continuous seminorms that generate the topology of . === Topological properties === * Suppose that is a TVS (not necessarily locally convex or Hausdorff) over the real or complex numbers. Then the open convex subsets of are exactly those that are of the form } for some and some positive continuous sublinear functional on . * If and , then if and only if for every and every finite collection there exists some such that . * The closure of } in is equal to \\cap_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}} p^{-1}(0). * Every Hausdorff locally convex TVS is homeomorphic to a subspace of a product of Banach spaces. === Topological properties of convex subsets === * The interior and closure of a convex subset of a TVS is again convex. * The Minkowski sum of two convex sets is convex; furthermore, the scalar multiple of a convex set is again convex. * If is a convex set with non-empty interior, then the closure of is equal to the closure of the interior of ; furthermore, the interior of is equal to the interior of the closure of . * So if a convex set has non-empty interior then is a closed (resp. open) set if and only if it is a regular closed (resp. regular open) set. * If is a convex subset of a TVS (not necessarily Hausdorff), belongs to the interior of , and belongs to the closure of , then the open line segment joint and (i.e. }) belongs to the interior of . * If is a locally convex space (not necessarily Hausdorff), is a closed vector subspace of , V is a convex neighborhood of 0 in , and if is a vector not in V, then there exists a convex neighborhood U of 0 in such that and . * The closure of a convex subset of a Hausdorff locally convex TVS is the same for all locally convex Hausdorff TVS topologies on that are compatible with duality between and its continuous dual space. * In a locally convex space, the convex hull and the disked hull of a totally bounded set is totally bounded. * In a complete locally convex space, the convex hull and the disked hull of a compact set are both compact. * More generally, if is a compact subset of a locally convex space, then the convex hull (resp. the disked hull ) is compact if and only if it is complete. * In a locally convex space, convex hulls of bounded sets are bounded. This is not true for TVSs in general. * In a Fr\u00e9chet space, the closed convex hull of a compact set is compact. * In a locally convex space, any linear combination of totally bounded sets is totally bounded. === Properties of convex hulls === For any subset of a TVS , the convex hull (resp. closed convex hull, balanced hull, resp. convex balanced hull) of , denoted by (resp. \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(S), , ), is the smallest convex (resp. closed convex, balanced, convex balanced) subset of containing . * In a quasi-complete locally convex TVS, the closure of the convex hull of a compact subset is again compact. * In a Hausdorff locally convex TVS, the convex hull of a precompact set is again precompact. Consequently, in a complete locally convex Hausdorff TVS, the closed convex hull of a compact subset is again compact. * In any TVS, the convex hull of a finite union of compact convex sets is compact (and convex). * Note that this implies that in any Hausdorff TVS, the convex hull of a finite union of compact convex sets is closed (in addition to being compact and convex); in particular, the convex hull of such a union is equal to the closed convex hull of that union. * In general, the closed convex hull of a compact set is not necessarily compact. * In any non-Hausdorff TVS, there exist subsets that are compact (and thus complete) but not closed. * The bipolar theorem states that the bipolar (i.e. the polar of the polar) of a subset of a locally convex Hausdorff TVS is equal to the closed convex balanced hull of that set. * The balanced hull of a convex set is not necessarily convex. * If and are convex subsets of a topological vector space (TVS) and if , then there exist , , and a real number satisfying such that . * If is a vector subspace of a TVS , a convex subset of , and a convex subset of such that , then . * Recall that the smallest balanced subset of containing a set is called the balanced hull of and is denoted by . For any subset of , the convex balanced hull of , denoted by , is the smallest subset of containing that is convex and balanced. The convex balanced hull of is equal to the convex hull of the balanced hull of (i.e. ), but the convex balanced hull of is not necessarily equal to the balanced hull of the convex hull of (i.e. is not necessarily equal to ). * If A and B are subsets of a TVS and if is a scalar then , , and \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(r A) = r \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(A). Moreover, if \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(A) is compact then \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(A + B) = \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(A) + \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(B) * If A and B are subsets of a TVS whose closed convex hulls are compact, then \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(A \\cup B) = \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}\\left( \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(A) \\cup \\overline{\\operatorname{co}}(B) \\right). * If is a convex set in a complex vector space and there exists some such that , then for all real such that . In particular, for all scalars such that . == Examples and nonexamples == === Finest and coarsest locally convex topology === ;Coarsest vector topology Any vector space endowed with the trivial topology (i.e. the indiscrete topology) is a locally convex TVS (and of course, it is the coarsest such topology). This topology is Hausdorff if and only }. The indiscrete topology makes any vector space into a complete pseudometrizable locally convex TVS. In contrast, the discrete topology forms a vector topology on if and only }. This follows from the fact that every topological vector space is a connected space. ;Finest locally convex topology If is a real or complex vector space and if is the set of all seminorms on then the locally convex TVS topology, denoted by , that induces on is called the finest locally convex topology on . This topology may also be described as the TVS-topology on having as a neighborhood base at 0 the set of all absorbing disks in . Any locally convex TVS-topology on is necessarily a subset of . is Hausdorff. Every linear map from into another locally convex TVS is necessarily continuous. In particular, every linear functional on is continuous and every vector subspace of is closed in .; therefore, if is infinite dimensional then is not pseudometrizable (and thus not metrizable). Moreover, is the only Hausdorff locally convex topology on with the property that any linear map from it into any Hausdorff locally convex space is continuous. The space is a bornological space. === Examples of locally convex spaces === Every normed space is a Hausdorff locally convex space, and much of the theory of locally convex spaces generalises parts of the theory of normed spaces. The family of seminorms can be taken to be the single norm. Every Banach space is a complete Hausdorff locally convex space, in particular, the spaces with are locally convex. More generally, every Fr\u00e9chet space is locally convex. A Fr\u00e9chet space can be defined as a complete locally convex space with a separated countable family of seminorms. The space of real valued sequences with the family of seminorms given by :p_i \\left(\\left\\\\{x_n\\right\\\\}_n\\right) = \\left|x_i\\right|, \\qquad i \\in \\mathbf{N} is locally convex. The countable family of seminorms is complete and separable, so this is a Fr\u00e9chet space, which is not normable. Note that this is also the limit topology of the spaces , embedded in in the natural way, by completing finite sequences with infinitely many . Given any vector space and a collection of linear functionals on it, can be made into a locally convex topological vector space by giving it the weakest topology making all linear functionals in continuous. This is known as the weak topology or the initial topology determined by . The collection may be the algebraic dual of or any other collection. The family of seminorms in this case is given by for all in . Spaces of differentiable functions give other non-normable examples. Consider the space of smooth functions such that , where a and b are multiindices. The family of seminorms defined by is separated, and countable, and the space is complete, so this metrisable space is a Fr\u00e9chet space. It is known as the Schwartz space, or the space of functions of rapid decrease, and its dual space is the space of tempered distributions. An important function space in functional analysis is the space of smooth functions with compact support in . A more detailed construction is needed for the topology of this space because the space is not complete in the uniform norm. The topology on is defined as follows: for any fixed compact set , the space of functions with is a Fr\u00e9chet space with countable family of seminorms (these are actually norms, and the completion of the space with the norm is a Banach space ). Given any collection of compact sets, directed by inclusion and such that their union equal , the form a direct system, and is defined to be the limit of this system. Such a limit of Fr\u00e9chet spaces is known as an LF space. More concretely, is the union of all the with the strongest locally convex topology which makes each inclusion map continuous. This space is locally convex and complete. However, it is not metrisable, and so it is not a Fr\u00e9chet space. The dual space of is the space of distributions on . More abstractly, given a topological space , the space of continuous (not necessarily bounded) functions on can be given the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets. This topology is defined by semi-norms (as varies over the directed set of all compact subsets of ). When is locally compact (e.g. an open set in ) the Stone-Weierstrass theorem applies\u2014in the case of real-valued functions, any subalgebra of that separates points and contains the constant functions (e.g., the subalgebra of polynomials) is dense. === Examples of spaces lacking local convexity === Many topological vector spaces are locally convex. Examples of spaces that lack local convexity include the following: *The spaces for are equipped with the F-norm ::\\|f\\|_p = \\int_0^1 |f(x)|^p \\, dx. :They are not locally convex, since the only convex neighborhood of zero is the whole space. More generally the spaces with an atomless, finite measure and are not locally convex. *The space of measurable functions on the unit interval (where we identify two functions that are equal almost everywhere) has a vector-space topology defined by the translation- invariant metric: (which induces the convergence in measure of measurable functions; for random variables, convergence in measure is convergence in probability) ::d(f, g) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{|f(x) - g(x)|}{1+|f(x) - g(x)|} \\, dx. :This space is often denoted . Both examples have the property that any continuous linear map to the real numbers is . In particular, their dual space is trivial, that is, it contains only the zero functional. *The sequence space , , is not locally convex. == Continuous mappings == Because locally convex spaces are topological spaces as well as vector spaces, the natural functions to consider between two locally convex spaces are continuous linear maps. Using the seminorms, a necessary and sufficient criterion for the continuity of a linear map can be given that closely resembles the more familiar boundedness condition found for Banach spaces. Given locally convex spaces and with families of seminorms and respectively, a linear map is continuous if and only if for every , there exist and such that for all in :q_\\beta(Tv)\\le M \\left (p_{\\alpha_1}(v) +\\dotsb+p_{\\alpha_n}(v) \\right ). In other words, each seminorm of the range of is bounded above by some finite sum of seminorms in the domain. If the family is a directed family, and it can always be chosen to be directed as explained above, then the formula becomes even simpler and more familiar: :q_\\beta(Tv)\\le Mp_\\alpha(v). The class of all locally convex topological vector spaces forms a category with continuous linear maps as morphisms. === Linear functionals === Note that if is a real or complex vector space, is a linear functional on , and is a seminorm on , then if and only if . If is a non-0 linear functional on a real vector space and if is a seminorm on , then if and only if f^{-1}\\left( 1 \\right) \\cap \\left\\\\{ x \\in X : p(x) < 1 \\right\\\\} = \\emptyset. === Multilinear maps === Let be an integer, be TVSs (not necessarily locally convex), let be a locally convex TVS whose topology is determined by a family of continuous seminorms, and let M : \\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} \\to Y be a multilinear operator that is linear in each of its coordinates. The following are equivalent: 1. is continuous. 2. For every , there exist continuous seminorms on , respectively, such that q\\left( M \\left( x \\right) \\right) \\leq p_1\\left( x_1 \\right) \\cdots p_n\\left( x_n \\right) for all x = \\left( x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\right) \\in \\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i. 3. For every , there exists some neighborhood of 0 in \\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} on which is bounded. == See also == * * * * * * * * * == Notes == == References == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Topological vector spaces ",
