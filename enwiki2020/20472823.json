She is mayor of Montauban since March 2001. She was reelected for a second term on 16 March 2008, then for a third term on 30 March 2014. Bar\u00e8ges sparked a controversy when she voiced brusque opposition to proposals for legalized same-sex marriage: \"Why not let people marry animals, too?\" Bar\u00e8ges sparked a controversy when she described a black person of her party as \"humain stain\". Bar\u00e8ges was punished by French courts because she refused to celebrate the wedding of a foreign couple. On 17 February 2014, the prosecutor announces that it will conduct an investigation for embezzlement of public funds. Despite this challenge on the judicial front, on 30 March 2014, Bar\u00e8ges won the municipal elections in Montauban for a third term. During the summer of 2014, CNCCFP rejects the accounts for the municipal elections. On 21 October 2014, following the rejection of her campaign accounts, Bar\u00e8ges was condemned to one year of ineligibility and non-reimbursement of campaign expenses by the Administrative Court of Toulouse. The court mentioned the use of municipality funds to fund an illegal advertising campaign during the election. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:People from Toulouse Category:Rally for the Republic politicians Category:Union for a Popular Movement politicians Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:The Social Right Category:Modern and Humanist France Category:The Popular Right Category:Mayors of places in Occitanie Category:Women mayors of places in France Category:20th-century French women politicians Category:21st- century French women politicians Category:Women members of the National Assembly (France) ",
