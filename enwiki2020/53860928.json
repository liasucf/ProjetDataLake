It was an initiative of Abou Abdallah Mohamed El Maghrebi who died in 1290. Ibn Khaldoun used to go to this madrasa. In the beginning it was a teaching place. But by the time, Al-Zaytuna took that role and the madrasa became just a place to host students. In 1930, it had 12 rooms but 32 students. == References == Category:Madrasas in the medina of Tunis ",
