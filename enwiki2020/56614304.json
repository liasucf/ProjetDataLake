Interested in the ways in which moving-image-based technologies (film, video) are able of inaugurating and establishing new forms of relationship across human and nonhuman animals, her research focuses on the intersection of art history, eco-activisms and film studies, with a particular emphasis on animal presences in artists' cinema. At the same time she is interested in the way the cinema and the zoo look at one another and shape each other as cinematic entities and spaces. In 2017 she held a public conversation at Tate Modern with Donna Haraway and Fabrizio Terranova on the occasion of the London film premiere of Storytelling for Earthly Survival (2016). In 2018 she was in conversation with writer and poet Eileen Myles, discussing animals, companionship and loss on occasion of their book Afterglow (A Dog's Memoir). With Serpentine Galleries' Curator of General Ecology, Lucia Pietroiusti, she initiated the symposia project \"The Shape of a Circle in the Mind of a Fish\". The first symposium, entitled \"on language\" was held at the London Zoo in May 2018, featuring Diana Reiss, Ted Chiang, Superflex's Rasmus Nielsen and Peter Gabriel. It also featured the performance Sleep Walkers/Zoo Pieces by Simone Forti, interpreted by long-time collaborator Claire Filmon, and the screening of Michela di Mattei's videos. The second symposium, entitled \"we have never been one\" took place at Ambika P3/University of Westminster in December 2018, featuring Heather Barnett, site-specific practitioners Gruff Theatre, swarm robotics engineer Sabine Hauert, science historian and writer Daisy Hildyard, neuroscientist Leah Kelly, science sociologist Hannah Landecker, anthropologist Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing, anthropologist Germain Meulemans, biological systems scientist and network architect Phoebe Tickell and artist Ana\u00efs Tondeur plus film and sound works by artists Sophia Al-Maria and Jenna Sutela and composer Annea Lockwood.

In 2019, she co-curated with John Akomfrah, Guilherme Blanc and Gareth Evans the Forum do Futuro, an annual programme of debates and performances held in Porto, Portugal, whose main objective is to invite guests from different disciplines and cultural backgrounds to discuss key issues facing contemporary societies. The five hundredth anniversary of the first circumnavigation of the world by Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es inspired the edition. Symbolically adopting the title \"Crossings/Travessias\", the F\u00f3rum do Futuro rethought this journey and its wide-ranging multiple effects at a historical, political, and cultural level. Invited speakers included Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Sonia Guajajara, Danny Glover, Christina Sharpe, Elizabeth Povinelli, Vandana Shiva, Coco Fusco, Arthur Jafa, David Adjaye, Fred Moten, Ralph Lemon, Fiesta Warinwa from the African Wildlife Foundation, and others. She maintains a keen interest as well as an advocacy position in supporting the efforts to acknowledge the rights and welfare of non-human animals, in diffusing pro- animal sensibilities as well as in promoting ethic and humane knowledge advance in animal studies. == References == Category:Portuguese writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Portuguese curators ",
