She is determined to live life to the full while she can see, exploring her approaching blindness and her constant nightmares which keep her awake at night. She is attracted to an 18-year-old, Juan and his dog, who she names Lupo. Juan is a traveler in love with Jessica, over whom he fights but is stabbed. Ava comes across the wounded Juan, helping him to recover. Once he is better, they embark on a spree of robberies at the beach, helping Ava to cope with her sadness. This, and the fact that Juan is having sex with Ava, gets Juan into trouble with the police. They escape from the police and Ava offers to help Juan recover his car keys and papers from his caravan so they can run away together. Ava joins Jessica's wedding on the traveler site to wait tables, then slips away when the cake is served. She finds Juan's wallet and driving license but can't find his car keys. The police raid the wedding so that Juan and Ava are forced to run away without his car. While they are walking away, Jessica appears to give Juan his car, leaving her veil with Ava as a token of her love and support for the couple. ==Cast== * No\u00e9e Abita as Ava * Laure Calamy as Maud, Ava's mother * Juan Cano as Juan * Tamara Cano as Jessica * Carmen Gimenez as Carmen * Daouda Diakhat\u00e9 as T\u00e9t\u00e9 ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 films Category:2017 drama films Category:2017 directorial debut films Category:French films Category:French drama films Category:French-language films ",
