Ten songs took part in the final, with the winner chosen by a 9-member jury, two of whose members were Ellen Nikolaysen, who represented Norway in 1973 (as a member of the Bendik Singers) and 1975, and Anita Skorgan, who represented Norway in 1979, who awarded 10 points to their favourite song down to 1 point to the least-liked.ESC National Finals database 1981 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text- align:center\" ! colspan=\"5\" |Final \u2013 7 March 1981 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

Kalvik performed the low-key ballad seated and strumming a guitar, and it was surmised that the song may have suffered by being sandwiched between the Irish and British entries, both of which were uptempo, instantly catchy pop songs with eye-catching stage presentations. \"Aldri i livet\" got totally lost, and at the close of voting had failed register any score, giving Norway a second nul-points in four contests and a sixth time at the foot of the scoreboard. The Norwegian jury awarded its 12 points to Switzerland.ESC History - Norway 1981 ==See also== *Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1981 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1981 Category:Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest Eurovision Eurovision ",
