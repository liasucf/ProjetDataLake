    "text": "\"I'll Fly Away\" is a hymn written in 1929 by Albert E. Brumley and published in 1932 by the Hartford Music company in a collection titled Wonderful Message.Richard Matteson, Jr., The Bluegrass Picker's Tune Book, Mel Bay Publications, 2006 (accessed at Google books on March 4, 2011) Brumley's writing was influenced by the 1924 secular ballad, \"The Prisoner's Song\". \"I'll Fly Away\" has been called the most recorded gospel song, and it is frequently used in worship services by Baptists, Pentecostals, Nazarenes, the Churches of Christ and many Methodists.Joe Edwards, 'I'll Fly Away' hymn classic, Associated Press/Kentucky New Era, March 13, 1987, page 4D It appears in many hymnals where it is listed under the topics of eternal life, heaven and acceptance. It is a standard song at bluegrass jam sessions and is often performed at funerals. ==History== Albert E. Brumley has been described as the \"pre-eminent gospel songwriter\" of the 20th century with over 600 published songs. Other popular songs by Brumley include \"Jesus, Hold My Hand\", \"Turn Your Radio On\", \"I'll Meet You in the Morning\", and \"This World Is Not My Home\". According to interviews, Brumley came up with the idea for the song while picking cotton on his father's farm in Rock Island, Oklahoma. Brumley says that as he worked he was \"humming the old ballad that went like this: 'If I had the wings of an angel, over these prison walls I would fly,' and suddenly it dawned on me that I could use this plot for a gospel-type song.\" The song Brumley described appears to be \"The Prisoner's Song\".W.K. McNeil, Encyclopeida of American Gospel Music, Routlage, 2005, page 54 It was an additional three years later until Brumley worked out the rest of the song, paraphrasing one line from the secular ballad to read, \"Like a bird from prison bars has flown\" using prison as a metaphor for earthly life. Brumley has stated, \"When I wrote it, I had no idea that it would become so universally popular.\" Other earlier nineteenth century slave songs also contained similar lyrics, stating: \"I'll fly away to glory; I'll fly away to my heavenly home, And I'll shout glory.\"\"The Freedmen of Sixty Years Ago,\" The Ladies Repository, (L. Swormstedt and J.H. Power,: March, 1878), p. 248 (accessed on Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=N8caAAAAYAAJ) ==Recordings== ===The Selah Jubilee Singers=== One of the earliest recordings of \"I'll Fly Away\" was made by the Selah Jubilee Singers in February 1941 for Decca Records.
