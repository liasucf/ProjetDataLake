The Zora was published monthly, in Serbian Cyrillic. Its chief editor was Aleksa \u0160anti\u0107. Besides \u0160anti\u0107, members of its editorial team were Svetozar \u0106orovi\u0107, Jovan Du\u010di\u0107 and Atanasije \u0160ola (\u0160ola was one of its editors although his name was not presented in the first several issues of Zora). ==History== The request to allow publishing of the Zora was submitted on 30 November 1895 to the Government in Sarajevo. Austrian intelligence reported that its editor, Aleksa \u0160anti\u0107, was involved with politics, but \"within limits\". Benjamin Kallay accepted positive opinion of the Government in Sarajevo, after extensive correspondence between Kotar governor - Government in Sarajevo - County of Mostar, and on 28 February 1896 allowed publishing of the journal. He also wrote detailed instructions to the Mostar County how to surveil and censor future journal to prevent it becoming political journal instead of literature one.: \"Nakon iscrpne prepiske na relaciji: Kotarski predstojnik - Zemaljska vlada - Okru\u017ena oblast u Mostaru, zajedni\u010dki ministar financija Benjamin Kalaj prihvata pozitivno mi\u0161ljenje Zemaljske vlade u Sarajevu i odobrava izla\u017eenje lista (28. II 1896), naravno uz detaljne instrukcije Okru\u017enoj oblasti o na\u010dinu prismotre i cenzure, kako bi \u201eZora\" uistinu bila knji\u017eevni a ne politi\u010dki list, sa posebnim upozorenjem u vezi budu\u0107ih urednika i njihovih osobina:\" The first edition was published on 30 April 1896.
