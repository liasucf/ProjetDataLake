    "text": "DC Multiverse is an American action figure toyline from Mattel (later by McFarlane Toys). Primarily consisting of 6-inch figures, the line is based on properties owned by DC Comics. The line was launched as a continuation of Mattel's DC Universe Classics line, and utilizes the same scale, sculpt and articulation style. ==History== After DC Universe Classics ceased production in 2014, Mattel unveiled figures from the successor line, DC Multiverse, at San-Diego Comic-Con 2015.https://news.toyark.com/2015/07/11/sdcc-2015-mattel- dc-comics-multiverse-figures-part-1-168891 Unlike the previous line, which primarily focused on comic iterations of the character, it was announced that Multiverse would mix classic comic designs with other media based on DC's characters, such as their films, TV shows and video games. Like DC Universe Classics, DC Universe also uses the Collect and Connect concept, where each figure in a wave comes packaged with a piece needed to complete an extra bonus figure or role play item. In 2019, it was announced that Mattel had lost the DC license, and that the DC Multiverse brand would be taken over by McFarlane Toys beginning in 2020.https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/todd-mcfarlane-teases- details-of-his-dc-comics-toy-line-including-batman-with-an- accuratehttps://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/12/dc-and-mcfarlane-toys- partnering-for-new-collectibles-in-2020 ==Mattel figures (2016\u20132019)== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Mattel action figures !scope=\"col\"| Collect and Connect Figure !scope=\"col\"| Release !scope=\"col\"| Figure !scope=\"col\"| Accessories !scope=\"col\"| Description !scope=\"col\"| Collect and Connect Piece |- |rowspan=6|Justice Buster |rowspan=6|2016 |Batman |Grappling pistol |Batman: Zero Year version |Right leg |- |Flash (Barry Allen) | |rowspan=2|The Flash (2014 TV series) version |Head and upper torso |- |Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne) | |Lower torso |- |Earth-23 Superman | |The Multiversity version |Left leg |- |Joker |Shredded face |Batman: Endgame version |Left arm |- |Arrow |Bow and arrow |Arrow (TV series) version |Right arm |- |rowspan=6|New 52 Doomsday |rowspan=6|2016 |Supergirl | |Supergirl (TV series) version |Left leg |- |Armored Batman |Sonic gun |rowspan=3|The Dark Knight Returns version |Head and lower torso |- |Robin (Carrie Kelley) |Slingshot |Right leg |- |Mutant Leader |Torch and crowbar |Left arm |- |Prison Jumpsuit Lex Luthor |Attachable manacles |Batman v.
