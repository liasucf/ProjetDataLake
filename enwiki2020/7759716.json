His debut album, The Shredding Tears, was released by Black and Greene Records on October 31, 2006. Scary played all instruments on the album save for the drums, which were played by Jeremy Black of Apollo Sunshine. In live performance Bryan Scary plays with his band, \"The Shredding Tears.\" In 2007 the band launched multiple tours nationwide. In September\u2013October 2007, the band went into the studio to record their newest album 'Flight of the Knife'. It was released April 1 on Black and Greene Records. On May 14, 2008, 'Flight of the Knife' was chosen as the \"Editor's Pick\" on iTunes and skyrocketed to the top-30 albums in a day. It was also ranked No. 6 in the \"Rock Albums\" section as well. On May 25, 2008, Bryan Scary won 'Person of the Week' on www.mastergiraffe.com. Prior to releasing their latest EP, Mad Valentines, Scary signed with Brooklyn based record label, Old Flame Records. The band toured with this EP in 2009. Bryan Scary's third full-length release and second album recorded with his band (the Shredding Tears) is titled Daffy's Elixir. It is a wild west-themed conceptual album which was funded in part by money pledged from friends and fans through Kickstarter.com. More than $16,000 was raised towards production of the album. Bryan recorded fully orchestrated demos for his band members which were then worked out in rehearsals prior to the sessions. The recording sessions for the album began in Brooklyn, NY with producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Phish) on February 25, 2010. Goggin had previously mixed the single \"Red Umbrella\" for Bryan Scary which was included on the Mad Valentines EP. Daffy's Elixir was released April 24, 2012, on Paper Garden Records/Lavaslope Records. In January 2014, Bryan and his new band Evil Arrows (Bryan Scary, Everet Almond, Graham Norwood, and Adrian Perry), released the first in a series of EPs simply titled 1. As of March, 2015 the band has released 5 EPs (1,2,3,4 & 5). The first 3 EPs were released as a full-length LP in Japan on Rallye Records titled 1-2-3. The band has plans to release at least another 2 EPs from the original sessions which started in August 2013. All the recordings were done in a very DIY style at the band's rehearsal space in Brooklyn. In early 2015, he launched a fundraiser on PledgeMusic for his new full-length Album titled BIRDS and he reached his set goal by 137% in May later that year. Though the project had an approximated release date for October that same year, it was delayed. The latest update was posted on his fundraiser the 22nd of August 2018 where he teased that the project would soon be completed. Bryan Scary released Birds on June 6, 2019. ==Band members== *Mike Acreman \u2013 Keys and Vocals (The Shredding Tears) *Graham Norwood \u2013 Guitar and Vocals (The Shredding Tears & Evil Arrows) *David Ostrem \u2013 Bass and Vocals (The Shredding Tears) *Paul Amorese \u2013 Percussion (The Shredding Tears) *Bryan Scary \u2013 Keys and Vocals (The Shredding Tears & Evil Arrows) *Everet Almond - Drums and Vocals (Evil Arrows) *Adrian Perry - Bass and Vocals (Evil Arrows) ==Former members== *Brian Bauer \u2013 Drums (The Shredding Tears) ==Discography== *The Shredding Tears (October 31, 2006) *Flight of the Knife (April 1, 2008) *Mad Valentines EP (October 27, 2009) *Daffy's Elixir (April 24, 2012) *Birds (June 6, 2019) ==Film Appearances== Bryan appears as a cameo in the film Let Them Chirp Awhile (2007) written and directed by Jonathan Blitstein.
