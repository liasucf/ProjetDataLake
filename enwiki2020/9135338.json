    "text": "KTPN-LD, virtual and UHF digital channel 48, is a low-powered MyNetworkTV- affiliated television station licensed to Tyler, Texas, United States. Owned by White Knight Broadcasting, it is a sister station to Longview-licensed Fox affiliate KFXK-TV (channel 51); Nexstar Media Group, which owns Jacksonville- licensed NBC affiliate KETK-TV (channel 56), operates KFXK and KTPN-LD under a shared services agreement (SSA). The three stations share studios on Richmond Road (near Loop 323) in Tyler; KTPN-LD's transmitter is located west of Texas Loop 323 northeast of the city. On cable, the station is available on Suddenlink Communications channel 9 and Longview Cable Television channel 4. KTPN-LD's signal was formerly relayed on KLPN-LD (channel 47) in Longview, which provided KTPN's programming to the central and eastern portions of the market; that station's transmitter was located near East Mountain, Texas. KLPN-LD's license was canceled on June 6, 2016. Even though KTPN-LD operates a digital signal of its own, its broadcasting radius only covers the immediate Tyler area. Therefore, in order to reach the entire market, the station is simulcast in standard definition on KFXK's second digital subchannel (UHF channel 31.2 or virtual channel 51.2 via PSIP) from a transmitter near FM 125 in rural northwestern Rusk County (northwest of New London). ==History== KTPN- LP first signed on the air from Tyler in 1990 as K48DP; originally operating as an independent station, it later became a charter affiliate of The WB when the network launched on January 11, 1995. KLPN-LP signed on in Longview as K22EH in 1995, serving as a repeater of K48DP and also carrying WB network programming. In 1997, the two stations both dropped their WB affiliations to join the United Paramount Network (UPN); channels 48 and 58 were collectively branded as \"UPN 22/48\". The two stations were then collectively branded as \"UPN 22/48\". Accordingly, channel 48 changed its callsign to KTPN-LP (standing for \" _T_ yler _P_ aramount _N_ etwork\"). In 1998, K22EH moved to UHF channel 58 and changed its callsign to K58FS in order to allow KETK-TV (channel 56) to sign on its digital signal on UHF channel 22 (both stations were accordingly rebranded as \"UPN 58/48\"); two years later in 2000, K58FS changed its callsign to KLPN-LP (standing for \" _L_ ongview _P_ aramount _N_ etwork\") to match its sister station. KTPN and KLPN received a full-power satellite when KCEB (channel 54, now a MeTV affiliate) signed on in July 2003, simulcasting UPN programming from the low-power outlets; the three stations collectively branded as \"UPN 54/58/48\". In 2005, KCEB dropped its UPN affiliation to affiliate with The WB; subsequently thereafter in January 2006, KTPN-LP and KLPN-LP lost the UPN affiliation to CBS affiliate KYTX (channel 19), which added the network as a second digital subchannel; this resulted in the two stations reverting into independent stations. Logo as \"My KLPN,\" used from 2006 until 2015 On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation (which split from Viacom in December 2005) and Time Warner's Warner Bros. Entertainment (the division that operated The WB) announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW.'Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September, CNNMoney.com, January 24, 2006.UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network, The New York Times, January 24, 2006. One month later on February 22, News Corporation announced the launch of a new \"sixth\" network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television.News Corp. Unveils MyNetworkTV, Broadcasting & Cable, February 22, 2006. KTPN and KLPN became charter affiliates of MyNetworkTV when the network launched on September 5, 2006; KCEB took the CW affiliation when the network launched two weeks later on September 18 (The CW Plus feed carried by the station has since moved to KYTX's second digital subchannel). On April 24, 2013, the Communications Corporation of America announced the sale of its television stations, including KETK-TV, to Nexstar Broadcasting Group. KFXK and KTPN were planned be sold to Nexstar partner company Mission Broadcasting; in the case of KFXK, that station was being sold to Mission to comply with FCC duopoly rules. But on August 5, 2014, Mission withdrew its application to acquire KFXK.Application Info , CDBS Public Access, Federal Communications Commission, Retrieved December 6, 2014.
