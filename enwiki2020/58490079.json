    "text": "Prunus webbii is a species of wild almond found growing around the northeastern Mediterranean Sea, from Sicily, through Greece, Crete and the Aegean Islands, the Balkans and Anatolia, and possibly as far as Iraq or Iran. A dense spiny shrub or small tree with extremely bitter seeds, it is thought to have contributed some genes to the domesticated almond Prunus dulcis, although the extent of the contribution is debated and not yet fully understood. ==References== webbii Category:Flora of Southeastern Europe Category:Flora of Western Asia ",
