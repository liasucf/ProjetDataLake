Also known as Lohit (meaning: red), he is the god of war, celibate and sometimes linked to god Karttikeya (Skanda). His origins vary with different mythological texts; in some, he is the son of Bhumi, the Earth Goddess and Vishnu, born when he raised her from the depths of water in Varaha avatar. In other myths, he is born from Shiva's sweat or blood drop. ==Planet== Mangala as a planet appears in various Hindu astronomical texts in Sanskrit, such as the 5th century Aryabhatiya by Aryabhata, the 6th century Romaka by Latadeva and Panca Siddhantika by Varahamihira, the 7th century Khandakhadyaka by Brahmagupta and the 8th century Sisyadhivrddida by Lalla. These texts present Mangala as one of the planets and estimate the characteristics of the respective planetary motion. Other texts such as Surya Siddhanta dated to have been complete sometime between the 5th century and 10th century present their chapters on various planets with deity mythologies. The manuscripts of these texts exist in slightly different versions, present Mangala's motion in the skies, but vary in their data, suggesting that the text were open and revised over their lives. The 1st millennium CE Hindu scholars had estimated the time it took for sidereal revolutions of each planet including Mangala, from their astronomical studies, with slightly different results: {| class=\"wikitable\" align=center style = \" background: transparent; \" |+ Sanskrit and other texts: How many days for Mangala (Mars) to complete its orbit? |-style=\"text-align: center;\" | width=200px | Source | width=340px | Estimated time per sidereal revolution |-style=\"text-align: center;\" | width=200px style=\"background: #ffad66;\" | Surya Siddhanta | width=340px | 686 days, 23 hours, 56 minutes, 23.5 seconds |-style=\"text- align: center;\" | width=200px style=\"background: #ffad66;\" | Siddhanta Shiromani | width=340px | 686 days, 23 hours, 57 minutes, 1.5 seconds |-style=\"text-align: center;\" | width=200px | Ptolemy | width=340px | 686 days, 23 hours, 31 minutes, 56.1 seconds |-style=\"text-align: center;\" | width=200px | 20th century calculations | width=340px | 686 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes, 41.4 seconds |} ==Calendar and zodiac== Mangala is the root of the word 'Mangalavara' or Tuesday in the Hindu calendar. The word \"Tuesday\" in the Greco-Roman and other Indo-European calendars is also dedicated to planet Mars, referring to \"T\u012bw's Day\", the day of Tiw or T\u00fdr, the god of war and victory. Tiw was equated with Mars in other Indo-European mythologies. The word \u092e\u0902\u0917\u0932 also means \"auspicious\" but the planet \u092e\u0902\u0917\u0932 is considered malefic. Mangala is part of the Navagraha in Hindu zodiac system. The role and importance of the Navagraha developed over time with various influences. The earliest work of astrology recorded in India is the Vedanga Jyotisha which began to be compiled in the 14th century BCE. It was possibly based on works from the Indus Valley Civilization as well as various foreign influences. Babylonian astrology which was the first astrology and calendar to develop, and was adopted by multiple civilizations including India. Deifying planetary bodies and their astrological significance occurred as early as the Vedic period and was recorded in the Vedas. The classical planets, including Mars, were referenced in the Atharvaveda from the second millennium BCE. The Navagraha was furthered by additional contributions from Western Asia, including Zoroastrian and Hellenistic influences. The Yavanajataka, or 'Science of the Yavanas', was written by the Indo-Greek named \"Yavanesvara\" (\"Lord of the Greeks\") under the rule of the Western Kshatrapa king Rudrakarman I. The Yavanajataka written in 120 CE is often attributed to standardizing Indian astrology. The Navagraha would further develop and culminate in the Shaka era with the Saka, or Scythian, people. Additionally the contributions by the Saka people would be the basis of the Indian national calendar, which is also called the Saka calendar. ==Iconography== He is painted red or flame colour, four-armed, carrying a trident (Sanskrit: trish\u016bla), mace (Sanskrit: gad\u0101), lotus (Sanskrit: Padma) and a spear (Sanskrit: sh\u016bla. His mount (Sanskrit: vahana) is a ram. He presides over (Tuesday).Mythology of the Hindus, Charles Coleman, p. 132 == Other Names == Mars (Mangala) is also called: * Ang\u0101raka (\u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917\u093e\u0930\u0915) - one who is red in colour also called * Raktavarna (\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923) - whose color is like blood. * Bhauma (\u092d\u094c\u092e) - son of Bhumi. * Lohit\u0101nga (\u0932\u094b\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0919\u094d\u0917) - red bodied (Loha also means Iron, so could also mean Iron Bodied). * Kuja (\u0915\u0941\u091c) - he who is born from Earth. * Bha (\u092d) - shining. ==Mangala verses== The word Mangala is ancient, first appearing in the Rigveda (2nd millennium BCE), and mentioned by grammarian Patanjali (~2nd century BCE), but not as an astrological term, rather to mean \"auspicious-successful\" (siddha) structure in literary arts. Panini too mentions it in verse I.3.1 in a similar context. In the Vedic texts, states Christopher Minkowski, there is no mention of auspicious rituals, or auspicious start or timing of a ritual, rather the \"mangala\" as auspicious practices likely emerged in the Indian traditions during the medieval era (after mid 1st millennium CE), thereafter found in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The ritualistic Mimamsa school of Hinduism did not include any mangala (auspicious) verses, related to plane \"Mangala\" in any of its text throughout the 1st millennium CE. The Markendeya Puran has \"\u092e\u0919\u094d\u0917\u0932\u094d\u0915\u0935\u091a\u092e\u094d \u0938\u094d\u0924\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0930 \" referring to planet \"Mangal\". ==References== ==Further reading== * * * *Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend () by Anna Dallapiccola Category:Navagraha Category:War gods Category:Martian deities ",
