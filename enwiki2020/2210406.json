    "text": "Toronto Fire Services (TFS) provides fire protection, technical rescue services, hazardous materials response, and first responder emergency medical assistance in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Toronto Fire Services is currently the largest municipal fire department in Canada. ==History== The Bedford Park Volunteer Fire Brigade, c. 1900. Early fire services in Toronto consisted primarily of volunteer fire companies. Fire services in Toronto began in 1874 in the former City of Toronto, and still consisted of volunteer fire companies. Prior to 1874, fire services were composed of poorly trained volunteer companies in the city. The first company was created in 1826 and hook and ladder in 1831. Most were able bodied men who were trained to operate pumps to draw water from the lake. A wooden pumper truck presented to Toronto by British America Assurance Company c.1837 is now found at Black Creek Pioneer Village. The city's poor fire fighting services were highlighted by the Great Toronto Fire in 1849 and again in the Great Fire of Toronto in 1904. After the latter fire, which destroyed much of Bay Street from The Esplanade West to Melinda Street, the Fire Department in Toronto became a critical city service and has evolved into the full-time service that exists today. The Toronto Fire Services was created in 1998 from the merger of the former fire departments of the original City of Toronto, East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough and York. It is the largest fire department in Canada and the 5th largest municipal fire department in North America. Weston until it was absorbed by York Fire Department. The York Fire Department was itself amalgamated with other Toronto fire services in 1998. As part of the City's 2013 Budget plans, the City of Toronto demanded a 10% cut by all city departments. TFS, under then Fire Chief James Sales, recommended vehicle reductions at several stations (Stations 213, 215, 324 and 413) and one station to close (Station 424) to meet the 10% reduction target. As well the cuts will lead to fewer firefighters on staff. In 2014, four pumpers (P213, P215, P413, P424) were taken out of service and Station 424 was shut down. In 2017, under Fire Chief Matthew Pegg, the TFS Transformation Plan was developed and introduced, which included a comprehensive Inclusion Plan. An update on the status of the numerous initiatives that are included in this plan was provided as part of the 2018 budget process. In 2018, 10 additional staff were added to support the creation of a permanent Toronto Community Housing Fire Safety Task Force. Also in 2018, one additional crew of 21 Operations Firefighters was approved to support the opening of the new Downsview fire station. ===Preceding fire services=== ====Fire companies==== * 1st Engine 1826 at Church Street and Newgate Street (Adelaide Street East), renumbered as Station 5 in 1861 and closed in 1874 * Independent Fire Company Engine House No. 2 * York Fire Company 1826 at Fireman's Hall (Church Street and Newgate Street) * Hook and Ladder Fire Company 1831 * Fireman's Hall 1839 at Bay Street 1839; closed 1841 * Station No. 1 1841; closed 1924 * 4th Engine House at St. Patrick Market on Queen Street West 1842, closed 1861 * Hose Company No. 2 at Berkeley Street 1849; closed 1859 * 7th Engine Company at Elizabeth Street 1857; closed 1859 * Station No 2 at 163 Portland 1871; closed 1968 * Station No 3 at 488 Yonge Street 1871; closed 1926 * Station No 5 at Court Street 1874; closed 1886 * Station No 6 at 315 Queen Street West 1874; closed 1942 ====Fire Departments==== A fire hall on Birchmount Road, which was used by the Scarborough Fire Department until its amalgamation with other fire services in Toronto. * Scarborough Fire Department 1925 - replaced 5 volunteer bucket brigades, 1850s * North York Fire Department 1923 - merged seven separate volunteer brigades * New Toronto Fire Department 1930 - merged with Etobicoke FD 1967 * Township of Etobicoke Fire Department 1955 ==Organization== command vehicle used to provide Toronto Fire leadership with a spot from which to coordinate activity on the scene of a large incident The Fire Chief (C1), under whom four deputy chiefs serve (C2, C3, C4, C5), are all based at 4330 Dufferin Street - the central headquarters for both Toronto Fire and Toronto Paramedic Services.

The first motorized pumper was placed in the College St station on October 18, 1911. Before that, the TFD and previous fire companies used horse drawn engines and ladders. Prior to the 1970s, the TFD had open air vehicles (driver cab not covered and mostly aerial trucks), but since then both the TFD and TFS use full covered vehicles. Prior to the 1950s, TFD used tiller-ladder trucks and since have reverted to smaller aerial units that can operate in narrow streets in Toronto. The TFS inherited all the vehicles of the fire departments prior to amalgamation. The current strength of TFS consists of 179 vehicles. Since amalgamation, apparatus numbers are numbered by a letter and 3 digits. The first digit stands for the command that the apparatus is in (1-North, 2-East, 3-South, 4-West). The second digit stands for the district within the command that the apparatus is in. The last digit stands for the station within the district within the command that the apparatus is assigned to. A list of types of vehicles used by the TFS: (prefix letter in brackets with \"xxx\" as placeholders) is listed below: * Aerial (Axxx) - most common ladders found in the city; lengths range from 75 to 105 feet (22.86 to 32 metres) * Tower (Txxx) - 2 articulated boom ladders, with 1 found in South and 1 in North Command; length 114 feet (34.75 metres); T331 is now a spare * Platform (PLxxx) - 1 ladder with attached platform, found in West Command; length 100 feet (30.48 metres) * Pumper (Pxxx) * Rescue (Rescue Pumper) (Rxxx) - a pumper with the addition of extrication equipment (Jaws of Life) and other tools * Fireboat (FBxxx) - 2 units, both stationed in Toronto Harbour * Hazardous Materials Unit (HAZxxx) - 1 in both North and South Commands * Hazmat Support Unit (HSxxx) - Unmanned equipment vehicle * Decontamination Unit (DExxx) * Squad (Sxxx) - heavy/technical rescue units, with 2 located in South Command and 1 in each of West, North, and East Commands. These units are equipped with the (Jaws Of Life) as well as various types of technical rescue equipment and tools. * High Rise Unit (HRxxx) - 2 only, in South Command,North Command * Water Tanker (WTxxx) - 1 only, in East Command * Rapid Attack Vehicle - 1 only, on Toronto Islands * All-Terrain Vehicle (ATVx) - used at special events, such as the Canadian National Exhibition * Trench Rescue Support Truck (TRSxxx) - 1 only, in East Command * Air/Light Unit (LAxxx) - 1 in each Command (A/L 111, A/L 231, A/L 333, A/L 421) * District Chief (Cxx) * Platoon Chief (Cx0) - 1 in each Command (C10, C20, C30, C40) * Division Commander (Cx) * Deputy Chief / Fire Chief (Cx) * Command (CMDxx) - 3 throughout the city * Mechanical Response Unit (MRUxxx) * Training Aerial (TRAx) - used by Professional Development and Training * Training Pumper (TRPx) - used by Professional Development and Training * Spare vehicles (X5xxx) - non-permanent additional vehicles added to station * Fire Investigator (FIx) ====Fire boats==== The Toronto Fire Department and successor Toronto Fire Services has operated fire boats since 1923. Fireboat Charles A. Reed was the first fireboat operated by the service, and was a wood hull boat that entered service in 1923 and remained in use until 1964.Discover & explore Toronto's waterfront, Mike Filey, pp34 William Lyon Mackenzie is one of two fireboats presently operated by the Toronto Fire Services The service presently has two fireboats in service. Fireboat William Lyon Mackenzie entered service in 1964, replacing Charles A. Reed. Fireboat William Lyon Mackenzie serves as the department's main fireboat and icebreaker. In 2006, the Toronto Fire Services acquired Fireboat Sora, a light utility boat built in 1982 for the Canadian Coast Guard. The Sora was retired from TFS on October 31, 2015, replaced by Fireboat William Thornton. Fireboat William Thornton is a type 400 cutter built in 1982 for the Canadian Coast Guard, and was acquired by the Toronto Fire Service in 2015. ====Miscellaneous units==== While not part of the fleet, Box 12 (Box 12 Association) and Support 7 (Greater Toronto Multiple Alarm Association) are canteen trucks run by volunteers and are present at large emergencies to provide food and beverages for Toronto firefighters. Formed in 1949, the Box 12 Association is Toronto\u2019s oldest fire canteen unit, and serves firefighters in the west end and the downtown core. The unit is named after alarm box #12, which was pulled to trigger the response to the Great Toronto Fire of 1904. This canteen has served in a number of high profile multiple alarm fires in recent history, including the Badminton and Racquet Club of Toronto six alarm fire in 2017. The Box 12 Association celebrated 70 years of continuous volunteer service in 2018, with Mayor John Tory in attendance. Each year, an award named after this canteen is presented by the Toronto Professional Fire Fighters Association to a fire service member for voluntarism. Formed in 1975, the GTMAA vehicle is painted with TFD scheme, but not the logo (using the GTMAA patch instead). In addition, there are various Hazardous Materials Support trucks and a Trench Rescue Support truck that respond to specialized calls. These trucks are unmanned, and are only used by trained personnel when a specialized call is dispatched. TFS also has a fleet of various mechanical support trucks. Smaller compact cars bearing the TFS colours and logo are driven by fire prevention officers and other commanding officers. Toronto Fire will also acquire use of the Long Range Acoustic Device. It was one of three purchased by the Toronto Police Service for use during the G20 summit in 2010 (1 for Marine Unit, 2 for Public Safety Unit).Police Will Keep G20 Sound Cannons Toronto Fire Services operates and manages both the Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR) team and the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) response team on behalf of the City of Toronto and under contract with the Province of Ontario for Provincial deployment as required as CAN-TF3. Prior to amalgamation, the Scarborough Fire Department had their fleet painted yellow. In the years following amalgamation the markings on the fire trucks were a patchwork of the various schemes used by the former boroughs. All had \"Toronto\" decaled or painted where the former borough's name used to be and the new Toronto Fire crest was added with the new numbering scheme. Over the past 19 years - post amalgamation - the majority of the older vehicles have either been retired or repainted to match the new scheme: fire engine red with yellow reflective trim and markings. ==Fire stations== The Toronto Fire Services (TFS) currently operates out of 83 Fire Stations (including one open seasonally) throughout the city, organized into 15 Districts. A 16th District (District 12) was disbanded in 2013. Its 4 stations were absorbed into the surrounding districts. Each District is part of one of four geographical divisions of Command. There are 4 Command areas: North, East, South and West. Each geographical division is divided into four Districts. Several Companies have been disbanded or reassigned over the years. ===North Command=== The North Command's Office (Command 1) is located at Fire Station # 114, 12 Canterbury Place.
