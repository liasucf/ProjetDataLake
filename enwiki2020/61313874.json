    "text": "Nicolas de Plattemontagne; portrait by Jean Ranc Nicolas de Plattemontagne, originally Nicolas Van Plattenberg (19 November 1631, Paris - 25 December 1706) was a French painter and engraver. His name also appears as La Montagne, Montagne and Montaigne. == Biography == His father was the Flemish painter and engraver Matthieu van Plattenberg, originally from Antwerp, who specialized in maritime scenes. In addition, his uncle was the well-known engraver, Jean Morin, who gave him his first lessons in that subject. In his youth, after learning the basics from his father, he studied with Philippe de Champaigne, one of the greatest painters and engravers in the Classical style. He also became a collaborator in the workshop belonging to Champaigne's nephew, Jean- Baptiste, who also became his lifelong friend. For many years, some of Plattemontaigne's early works were confused with those by both of the Champaignes, and it is only rather recently that the confusion has been resolved. From 1865 to 1656, under the direction of the elder, Champaigne, he participated in decorating the apartments of Anne of Austria at the abbey of Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce. In 1663, he was accepted as a history painter at the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture, and was later named a Professor. Previously, he had focused on portraits. Three years later, he was chosen to create the annual painting for the \"Mays\", commissioned by the Goldsmiths' Guild of Paris for Notre Dame Cathedral. He produced a \"Saint Paul and Silas\", which is now at the Louvre. In 1669, he was hired to decorate the apartments of Louis, the Dauphin at the Palais des Tuileries. In 1703, Jean Ranc painted his portrait at the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. That painting served as Ranc's reception piece for acceptance at the Acad\u00e9mie. He was largely forgotten within a few years of his death. After some research around the turn of the 20th century, resulting in several reattributions, his corpus appears to comprise seventeen paintings and about eighty engravings or drawings. == Selected works == File:Plattemontagne-Moses.jpg|Moses Rescued from the Waters File:Plattemontagne-Montmor.jpg|Portrait of Henri Louis Habert de Montmor File:Plattemontagne - Sainte Genevi\u00e8ve donnant sa protection aux malades.jpg|Saint Genevieve Giving her Protection to the Sick File:Plattemontagne-Apollo.jpg|Apollo with his Lyre, in the Clouds File:Portrait of French engraver Jean Morin - Plattemontagne.jpg|Portrait of Jean Morin == Further reading == * Dominique Br\u00eame and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Lano\u00eb, \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9cole de Philippe de Champaigne, Somogy \u00e9ditions d\u2019art, 2007 * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Lano\u00eb, Pierre Rosenberg, Philippe Luez, Trois ma\u00eetres du dessin, Philippe de Champaigne, Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne, Nicolas de Plattemontagne, \u00c9ditions de la RMN, 2009 == External links == * \"Un tableau de Nicolas de Plattemontagne acquis par B\u00e2le\" @ La Tribune de l'art.
