Since then, the duo, however, did not look back but instead continued entertaining people with their best guitar tunes and sweet melodies and suddenly they released their first album, At Dawn. Undercover Brothers Ug held their first ever concerts dubbed Unveiling Undercover Brothers Ug on the 13 and 20 December 2014 in Kampala. These concerts acted as their official release dates for their first album, At Dawn which sold physical copies at the concerts. The first concert was blessed by a performance by Uganda's king of Mwooyo Maurice Kirya. The third single, Nsikatila marketed the album which increased album sales in December 2014. The duo released their first music video for the song Diamond, a collabo with Uganda's young rapper Young Zee in May 2014. The duo was one of the few artists and bands chosen to entertain people on World Music Day 2014 and 2015 organised by Alliance Francaise in Kampala, Uganda. The duo has also performed at different music festivals including Pearl Rhythm Festival alongside Jackie Chandiru in October 2014 after winning the Pearl Rhythm Stage Coach Auditions, Bayimba International Music Festival, Laba Street Art Festival as well as the Milege World Music Festival organized by Milege in November 2014, and 2015, Nyege Nyege 2015 and 2016 where they slayed the festival with a great heavy performance, Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) Festival and many more.
