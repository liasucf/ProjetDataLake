    "text": "British Chess Championship, Torquay 2009 The British Chess Championships are organised by the English Chess Federation. The main tournament incorporates the British Championship, the English Chess Championships and the British Women's Chess Championship so it is possible, although it has never happened, for one player to win all three titles in the same competition. The English Women's Chess Championship was also incorporated into this event but did not take place in 2015 and was held as a separate competition in 2016. Since 1923 there have been sections for juniors, and since 1982 there has been an over- sixty championship. The championship venue usually changes every year and has been held in different locations in England, Scotland, Wales and once on the Isle of Man.British Chess Championship Venues at chess.about.com The championship was originally open to citizens of any Commonwealth country and has previously been won by Mir Sultan Khan (India) and Abe Yanofsky (Canada). After the Indian R. B. Ramesh finished first in 2002 and several other Indians took top prizes at the same event, many top Britons declined to compete in the 2003 championship. Following the victory of Indian Abhijit Kunte in 2003 and criticism that the British Championship was not serving the interests of British players, it was announced that starting in 2004 only British and Irish players would be eligible to take part. Since 2006 the Commonwealth Chess Championship has been organized on an annual basis. ==BCA Congress (1857\u20131861)== These were the first large tournaments organised by the British Chess Association, international players were allowed to participate.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/lab/7378/19th.htm&date;=2009-10-26+02:37:01 :{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !

The British Championship was then discontinued until 1904. :{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" ! Year !! City !!
