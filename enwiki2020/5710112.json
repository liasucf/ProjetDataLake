    "text": "Girl with Curious Hair is a collection of short stories by American writer David Foster Wallace, first published in 1989. Though the stories are not related, several reflect Wallace's concern with contemporary trends in fiction, including metafiction and the irony of postmodernism; and the cynical, amoral realism of \"Brat Pack\" writers such as Bret Easton Ellis. Others address society's fascination with celebrity, some with characters based on real people, including Alex Trebek, David Letterman and Lyndon Johnson. A novella, \"Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way\", closes the book, as an extended response to John Barth's metafictional short story \"Lost in the Funhouse\".Boswell, 102 et seq. ==List of stories== * \"Little Expressionless Animals\" revolves around a unique winning streak on the TV game show Jeopardy!, and the coming together of two lesbians with abnormal childhoods. * \"Luckily the Account Representative Knew CPR\", in which two executives at an unnamed corporation meet in the underground parking lot while leaving late, and the senior executive suddenly has a heart attack. * \"Girl with Curious Hair\". A sadistic young Republican lawyer who associates with punk rockers spends an evening with his drugged friends at a Keith Jarrett concert, where his LSD-influenced girlfriend is obsessed with a girl with curious hair. *\"Lyndon\".
