    "text": "Elstree is a village in the Hertsmere borough of Hertfordshire, England. It is about northwest of central London on the former A5 road, that follows the course of Watling Street. In 2011, its population was 5,110. It forms part of the civil parish of Elstree and Borehamwood, originally known simply as Elstree. The village often lends its shorter name to businesses and amenities in the adjacent town of Borehamwood, and the names of Elstree and Borehamwood are used interchangeably. Elstree is perhaps best known for multiple Elstree Film Studio complexes, where many films were made, including BBC Elstree Centre, where the TV soap opera EastEnders is shot. This production centre is actually in Borehamwood. The local newspaper is the Borehamwood and Elstree Times.Borehamwood and Elstree Times (Website). This was originally the Boreham Wood and Elstree Post, and before that, Boreham Wood & Elstree Local (see British Library record) Together with Borehamwood, the village is twinned with Offenburg in Germany, Fontenay-aux-Roses in France, and Huainan in China.\"The Borehamwood and Elstree Twin Town Association\" website.

Elstree South Underground station was due to be an extension of the Northern line, planned in the 1930s, but never completed. === Road links === The old A5 road (Watling Street) goes through Elstree village, where it is designated as the A5183 road. Through the village, the road is called (from south to north) Elstree Hill South, High Street and Elstree Hill North. The 18th century Grade II listed building, Elstree Hill House, is still on Elstree Hill South, and used to be the home of the old Elstree School (see Schools). In the early 1900s, it was noted that: :\".. the hill roads are remarkably direct and seldom curve to avoid the steep pitch, and it has been suggested that the roads were originally slides for the timber which used to be sent to London for fuel.\"'Parishes: Elstree', A History of the County of Hertford: volume 2 (1908), pp. 349\u2013351.

From this immense sheet of water, in event of drought or a deficiency of upland waters, the lower parts of the Grand Junction and the Paddington Canals can have an immediate supply.
