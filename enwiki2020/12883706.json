Williams is also known for his contributions to the forensic use of the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Williams has argued that the PTSD diagnosis has been over utilized by mental health experts seeking to support a plaintiff's emotional damage claim. Williams notes that many plaintiffs do not meet the criteria for PTSD, and he has also observed that individuals with a grievance will experience many of the same subjective psychological events as someone who actually suffers from PTSD. == References == Category:Living people Category:American psychologists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni ",
