In March 1973, 20 organizations, lead by the Palm Beach County Medical Society, proposed using the land for a nature park. About a month later, the Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners voted for using of land - located south of Forest Hill Boulevard, east of Florida's Turnpike, and west of Jog Road - for development of a park. In the same meeting, the commission also voted to appraise the value of of private property on the north side of Forest Hill Boulevard. After the private property value was assessed at just over $7 million, the county commission voted in July 1973 to request federal funds to cover approximately half of the price, but the request was denied in October of that year. The county commission later decided to request money from the state of Florida, which granted the request on March 19, 1974. On April 30, the county commission approved of naming the park Okeeheelee Park. \"Okeeheelee\" is Seminole for \"pretty waters\". A dedication ceremony for the park was held on June 15, 1974. Notable guests and participants in the ceremony included Doyle Conner, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture; John Dance, Palm Beach County Parks and Recreation Director; Fred Otis Dickinson, Florida Comptroller; Richard Stone, former Secretary of State of Florida who was elected to the United States Senate that year; Ralph Turlington, Florida Commissioner of Education; and county commissioners Robert Johnson, Lake Lytal, and George Warren.
