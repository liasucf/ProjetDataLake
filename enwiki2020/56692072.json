    "text": "Crown Princess Hwi of the Old Andong Kim Clan (1410\u20131429), also known as Deposed Consort Kim, was a consort of the Joseon crown prince, but was demoted to commoner and thrown out of the palace after she used witchcraft to gain her husband's affection. ==Biography== Kim was born the daughter of Kim Oh-mun, a high-ranking official in charge of military affairs, whilst her grandfather was a magistrate at the Dongnyeongbu (;). King Sejong selected Kim as consort for his heir apparent, the future King Munjong, in 1427.Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 36. After journeying from her home, Kim camped outside Hanseong and the crown prince was sent to greet her and escort her back to the eastern palace. Crown Princess Hwi requested to visit her natal home in 1428 to attend the burial rites for her grandfather.Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 40. ==Witchcraft== Court records indicate that, in the winter of 1428 \u2013 1429, Crown Princess Hwi asked her maid, Ho-cho (\ud638\ucd08), how she could gain the crown prince's love. Ho-cho told her to cut her rivals' shoes into pieces and burn them to ash. She recommended that the consort test the method on two maids that she was already jealous of, Ho-dong (\ud6a8\ub3d9) and Deok-kim (\ub355\uae40), which she promptly did. Crown Princess Hwi then requested further methods to gain her husband's love and Ho-cho instructed her to drain the fluids from a snake, then rub those essences onto a cloth. Ho-cho claimed that if the consort wore that cloth in the presence of the crown prince, he would love her. Meanwhile, another maid, whom the consort had brought to the palace from her natal home, Sun-deok (\uc21c\ub355), discovered the remains of the burnt shoes in her mistress' perfume pouch. Sun-deok questioned Ho-cho as to how the consort had learnt such things, but hid the shoes. When the rumours of Crown Princess Hwi's activities reached Sejong, he ordered that she be confined to her quarters and her staff, including Sun-deok, were questioned.Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 45. Ho-cho was sent to the Uigeumbu and Sun-deok told officials where to find the shoe remains. In shock, Sejong lamented his choice of such a daughter-in-law, ordered that her seal be retracted, her name removed from the ancestral temple and that she be demoted to commoner. The former consort was expelled from the palace so that she would not pollute the royal family.\u9edc\u9084\u79c1\u7b2c, \u7d42\u4e0d\u4f7f\u8584\u884c\u4e4b\u4eba, \u6c5a\u6211\u5bb6\u6cd5\u3002 ==Aftermath== After Kim was demoted, her father was also demoted and her brother was removed from his position in the Dongnyeongbu. Ho- cho was beheaded for instructing her mistress in witchcraft. Several court officials also attempted to have other palace ladies, as well as Kim's parents, interrogated to establish whether they had either been involved in teaching her or covered up her behaviour, but Sejong denied all these requests. ==Family== *Paternal grandfather: Kim Gu-deok (d.1428) (\uae40\uad6c\ub355) **Father: Kim Oh-mun (\uae40\uc624\ubb38) ***Mother: Lady Jeong of the Jeong Clan (\uc815\ubd80\uc778 \uc815\uc528) ****Brother: Kim Jungeom (\uae40\uc911\uc5c4) *****Sister-in-law: Lady Cho of the Pyongyang Cho Clan (d.1450) (\ud3c9\uc591 \uc870\uc528)Granddaughter of Taejong of Joseon.
