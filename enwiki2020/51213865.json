Associated hashtags #madeinnyjazz #madeinnyjazzgala #madeinnyjazzmne frameless == History == The idea of organizing a global, online jazz competition was the brainchild of a musician and producer, Michael Brovkine. The concept was born in 2010, with the growing popularity of the internet, but it took another three years and the use of social media for the first competition to come to fruition. In January 2013, The Made in New York Jazz Competition website launched, and by August 2013, the Competition had more than 250 registered artists and musicians representing 35 countries, and over 12,000 registered website users.Yanow, Scott; E-Jazz News; March 22, 2013; http://ejazznews.com/?p=13229 In May 2014, the first online-based, year-round jazz competition made its Gala Concert debut at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center, in New York City. Although the contest headquarters is located in New York, the contest itself occurs online. One of the unique aspects of the competition is that entries are accepted year-round, and winners are determined by the accumulation of votes received from online voters, committee members, and competition judges. The Grand Prize for winning the contest includes $3,000 plus 10% of registration fees, round-trip ticket to the International Jazz Gala in New York as a performer (courtesy of Kawai Musical Instruments), various prizes from competition and gala sponsors, the opportunity to perform on stage with jazz legends, network with industry notables, and the chance to gain global exposure. The competition gained popularity quickly, gaining over 30,000 registered jazz musicians and fans representing 50 countries around the globe. In May 2016, Made In New York Jazz Competition launched the brand in Europe, in collaboration with Montenegrin publishing house, Rabbit Records and main partner, Capital Plaza, with an inauguration festival in Montenegro.KMIR; April 28, 2016; http://www.kmir.com/story/31838319/top-jazz-competition-announces-european- expansion == Leadership and Board of Members == * Michael Brovkine: Founder & CEO * Yaacov Mayman: Artist Director * Alexandra Djordjevic: Managing Director * Vladimir Mara\u0161: Affiliate Director, Montenegro * Pablo Elorza: Affiliate Director, Argentina * Mario Biondi: Honored International Artistic Advisor (2016-2017)KMIR; April 28, 2016; http://www.kmir.com/story/31838319/top-jazz- competition-announces-european-expansion == Supporters, partners, and sponsors == * French Embassy in the United States * German Mission in the United States * Balassi Institute * Consulate of Montenegro in the United States * Onassis Cultural Center * Bodossaki Foundation * Kawai Musical Instruments * Alex Soldier * Andy Filimon Photography * Mario Biondi * Cantamessa * Gismart * Synthogy * Impression Cymbals * Intellectsoft * Capital Plaza * Renault * Hipotekarna Banka * Telenor * Adriatic Properties * CdM Media * Montenegro Ministry of Culture * Hotel Ziya * Yamaha/Eurounit * Montenegro Airlines * Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 * Ethno Jazz Club Sejdefa * US Embassy in Montenegro *Porto Montenegro == Performers and gala hosts == === First Annual Jazz Gala 2014 (New York) === * Lenny White, Multi-Grammy Award Winner * Randy Brecker, Multi-Grammy Award Winner * Anita Vitale, Competition winner * Evgeny Lebedev, Second Place winner * Vladimir Maras * Migayel Voskanyan and Friends * Ricardo Baldaci * Pablo Elorza * Nick Vintskevich === Jazz Gala 2015 (New York) === * Randy Brecker, Multi-Grammy Award Winner * Bobby Sanabria, Grammy Award nominee * Alex Blake * Yaacov Mayman * Eden Rabin International Project, Competition winner * Jan Prax Quartet * Polly Gibbons * Uraz Kivaner * Thana Alexa * Sinan Alimanovi\u0107 === Jazz Gala 2016 (New York) === * Rufus Reid * Philip Harper * Tommy Campbell * Bobby Sanabria, Grammy Award nominee * George V.
