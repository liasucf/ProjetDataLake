    "text": "Leslie Oswald Sheridan Poidevin (5 November 1876 \u2013 18 November 1931) was an Australian tennis player and first class cricketer who played for New South Wales and Lancashire. A right-handed batsman who was strong in defence, Poidevin started his first class cricket career with New South Wales in 1895. In 1901 he contributed an unbeaten 140 out of the team's total of 918 runs which was a record team score at the time. He would only bat in 23 innings for NSW over the course of his career but his average of 57.73 ranks favourably with the finest who have played for the state. At the turn of the century he came to England to study medicine and began playing cricket for London County. After three seasons with London County he qualified to play for Lancashire and helped them to win the championship in 1904, his debut season with the county. During the season he made 865 runs at 34. He topped Lancashire's averages the following year with 44 after managing a total of 1376 runs. Poidevin also played competitive tennis, representing Australasia in the 1906 Davis Cup as well as in Grand Slams (though missing the 1908 Summer Olympics because of administrative bungling). ==See also== * List of New South Wales representative cricketers ==Notes== ==External links== *Cricinfo profile *Australian Dictionary of Biography entry Category:1876 births Category:1931 deaths Category:Australian cricketers Category:Australian expatriate cricketers in the United Kingdom Category:Australian male tennis players Category:Lancashire cricketers Category:New South Wales cricketers Category:Tennis people from New South Wales Category:Gentlemen cricketers Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers Category:London County cricketers Category:Cricketers from New South Wales Category:H.
