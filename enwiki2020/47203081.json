    "text": "Frederick Weygold (born June 13, 1870 in Saint Charles, Missouri; died August 13, 1941 in Louisville, Kentucky) was an American painter, photographer and ethnographer, who has researched the life and culture of the North American Indians mainly examples of various Sioux tribes and artistically presented as scientific. ==Life and creative work== He was learning art and languages in Germany before he moved in Louisville in 1908. In Europe Weygold became interested in American Indians, learning the Lakota language and Native American culture. This experience was of great help to him later to advise to European museum directors. In 1909, Weygold went to the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations in South Dakota, where he obtained Native American artifacts for the Museum of Ethnology in Hamburg. He also made a lot of photographs to reflect Native American life and culture. In his photographs he also reserved the first evidence of the Plains Indian sign language. Later he was able to use his ethnographic experience to illustrate two books by the Dakota author Charles Eastman and two others by James Willard Schultz for a German publisher. Weygold gathered a personal collection of Native American artifacts and he later presented it to the Speed Art Museum, which now approves to be the main part of the museum's collection.Picturing American Indian Cultures\u2019: The Art of Kentucky\u2019s Frederick Weygold Retrieved on 13 Mar 2018 PICTURING AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURES: THE ART OF KENTUCKY\u2019S FREDERICK WEYGOLD Retrieved on 13 Mar 2018 During a long period, Native American artifacts were far more popular in Europe \u2014 where Weygold did much of his work \u2014 than in the United States. ==Books== * Frederick Weygold: Das indianische Lederzelt im K\u00f6niglischen Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde zu Berlin, Verlag Vieweg, Braunschweig 1903 * Frederick Weygold: Die Hunkazeremonie, Verlag Vieweg, Braunschweig 1912 * Frederick Weygold: Oil Paintings Illustrating Indian Life, as he saw it, in 1909-1937, The J.
