The team is located in Leinster province of Ireland and is managed by Cricket Leinster. ==History== In 2013, Cricket Ireland formed the three-day Interprovincial Championship, featuring teams from Leinster, the NCU and the North West. The Leinster team is known as Leinster Lightning. In February 2015, they announced Ted Williamson as their coach, taking over at the helm from Trent Johnston. Under his coaching, Leinster Lightning took a clean-sweep of trophies in the 2015 and 2016 seasons before he stepped down from the position.http://www.cricketireland.ie/news/article/williamson-steps- down-as-head-coach-of-leinster-lightining Up to and including the 2016 Inter- Provincial Championship, the matches were not given first-class status.
