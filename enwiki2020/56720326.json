Nicolette Vane- Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry (n\u00e9e Nicolette Harrison; 1941 - 13 August 1993), was the first wife of The 9th Marquess of Londonderry, and later the wife of musician Georgie Fame. ==Early life== Nicolette, often called \"Nico\" for short, was the daughter of stockbroker Michael Harrison and his wife, the former Maria Madeleine Benita von Koskull, a Latvian baroness.Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. Page 2383 She was a debutante, one of the last to be presented to Queen Elizabeth II before the practice was abolished. ==Marriage and family== She married the Marquess on 16 May 1958, when she was seventeen. They made their home at Wynyard Hall and had two children: *Lady Sophia Frances Anne Vane-Tempest-Stewart (born 1959), who married Jonathan Mark Pilkington and has children. *Lady Cosima Maria-Gabriella Vane-Tempest- Stewart (born 1961), who married Cosmo Fry; then Lord John Robert Somerset, with whom she has children. The paternity of her elder son, Tristan Alexander (born 1969), who briefly held the courtesy title Viscount Castlereagh, was contested when he was about 18 months old, and he was confirmed to be the son of Georgie Fame (real name Clive Powell), with whom the young Marchioness had been having an extramarital relationship. One of the Marchioness's daughters, Lady Cosima, later claimed that her true father might be musician and writer Robin Douglas-Home. The 1971 divorce of Lord and Lady Londonderry was the subject of considerable publicity. The following year, the Marchioness married Georgie Fame at Marylebone Register Office, and her married name became Nicolette Powell. Lord Londonderry subsequently married ballerina Doreen Wells. As Nicolette Powell, the former Marchioness gave birth to a second son, James Michael, in 1973. ==Later life== In 1993, she died after falling from Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. Her death was registered as suicide. She had left a note stating that she saw \"no purpose in life\" now that her children had grown up and left home. Several portrait photographs of her are held by the National Portrait Gallery, London. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:1993 deaths Category:English marchionesses Category:Peerage of Ireland ",
