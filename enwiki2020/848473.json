    "text": "Marquis is a fetish magazine owned, operated, published and primarily photographed by Peter W. Czernich and Sandra W\u00fcrdig. Based in Germany, Marquis covers a wide array of topics related to the worldwide fetish subculture. The magazine's name is a reference to the Marquis de Sade. Czernich's original publishing venture entitled \u00abO\u00bb began as a spin-off of the British Skin Two magazine but quickly developed its own identity. After losing the right to the \u00abO\u00bb name,Oprah puts lash to German fetish title Czernich created Marquis in 1994. It has continued to be published semiannually-to-quarterly ever since. A spin-off title, Heavy Rubber, began in 1996. Czernich has also developed a significant online presence including web versions of both magazines and a large online clothing & book store. Whereas it is true that the magazine's name derives from de Sade, the special interest addressed by the magazine is a poor match for the normal concept of \"sadism\" as casually understood by the layman. Marquis is very closely specialised on latex and PVC fetishism and related topics such as sexy girls in catsuits, advanced designs in bondage wear and other related fantasy scenarios. ==References== == External links == * Marquis official site Category:1994 establishments in Germany Category:Fetish magazines Category:Magazines published in Germany Category:German-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1994 ",
