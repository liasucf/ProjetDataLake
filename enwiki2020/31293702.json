    "text": "The Gallant Hussar () is a 1928 German-British romance film directed by G\u00e9za von Bolv\u00e1ry and starring Ivor Novello, Evelyn Holt, and Paul H\u00f6rbiger. It was based on a story by the Hungarian writer Arthur B\u00e1rdos and Margarete-Maria Langen. The film was a co-production made under an agreement between Gainsborough Pictures and the German studio Felsom-Film and was shot in Berlin. After the passage of the Cinematograph Films Act 1927 by the British Parliament it was classified under the terms of the Act as a foreign film and only received a limited release in Britain. It is also known under the alternative title The Bold Dragoon. It is now considered a lost film. Along with A South Sea Bubble (1928), the film marked a significant change in the role played by Novello. He had previously appeared as unsettled, outsider figures in films such as The Lodger, but from now on played more well-balanced romantic figures. ==Synopsis== The daughter of an American millionaire falls in love with a Hungarian hussar officer during a visit to the Austrian Empire. ==Cast== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * ==External links== * Category:1927 films Category:1920s romance films Category:British romance films Category:British films Category:German films Category:Films of the Weimar Republic Category:British silent feature films Category:German silent feature films Category:Films directed by G\u00e9za von Bolv\u00e1ry Category:Gainsborough Pictures films Category:Films set in the 1900s Category:Films set in Hungary Category:Films set in Austria Category:Lost British films Category:British black-and-white films Category:German black- and-white films ",
