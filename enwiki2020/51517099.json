    "text": "Roarin' Town is the eleventh studio album by Australian rock band The Black Sorrows. The album was released in October 2006. It was the first studio album from The Black Sorrows since Beat Club in 1998. Camilleri said he wrote the tracks throughout 2005 and called the song \"What Levi Wants\", the son of \"Harley + Rose\", \"not because they sound like each other, it just started to speak in the same way.\" The album was re-released in May 2007, with a 7-track live CD. ==Reception== Bruce Elder from Sydney Morning Herald said; \"This is the first new Black Sorrows album in nearly a decade and it doesn't do the brand name any favours.\" adding \"There are moments when the old magic re- emerges...
