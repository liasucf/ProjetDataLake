All the matches were separate from the regular season. Teams played each other once home and away in the Cup competition, and the first place team would win the Cup competition. One match involving Toronto Italia and London City failed to materialize, but was of no consequence as St. Catharines Wolves accumulated enough points to secure the title. === Standings === === Matches === ==All- Star game == The all-star team assembled by the league was limited in its selection of players due to St. Catharines, and Oakville protesting the allowance of their players. As St. Catharines earlier on participated in a European tour, and their players required the necessary rest. Toronto Italia were selected as the opposition, and managed to attract Diego Maradona to play alongside his brother Lalo Maradona. The match was commemorated as the 75th anniversary of the league, and advertised as one of Diego Maradona's final matches. The reported payoff to Maradona was $40,000 with Boca Juniors receiving a share due to ownership of player rights. An additional $15,000 was charged if reporters wished to conduct an interview, and the league insured Maradona for five million dollars. {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1|| Paulo Silva || || |- |RB ||2|| Leonardo Simon |- |CB ||3 ||Rene Martin |- |CB ||4||John DiBuono || || |- |LB ||17||Paul Hillman || || |- |RM ||5 ||Leo Lopez || || |- |CM ||7||Tony Tavares || || |- |CM ||8||Alex Nardi || || |- |LM ||10 || Adolfo Mella |- |ST ||16|| John Bottineau || || |- |ST ||14||Gus Kouzmanis || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||12||Milan Popov || || |- |DF ||24 || Tonino Commisso || || |- |DF ||25||Gerald Gallacher || || |- |MF ||11||Lincoln Williams || || |- |MF ||6|| Ian Bryan || || |- |FW ||9 ||Luan Jonuzi || || |- |FW ||13|| Anthony Dominique || || |- |} {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto;\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1|| Joe Ciaravino || || |- |RB ||3 || Franco Spadafina |- |CB ||4 || Richard Alexander |- |CB ||5|| Tom Perks |- |LB ||2 ||John Annisi || || |- |RM ||11 || Marco Antonucci || || |- |CM ||9|| Lalo Maradona || || |- |CM ||10|| Diego Maradona || || |- |LM ||6||Jack Zomparelli || || |- |CF ||22|| Michele Gioia || || |- |CF ||23 || Phil Caporella || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||00||Mike Ivancescu || || |- |DF ||7|| Miguel Ferreira || || |- |DF ||18|| Lou Fiaccola || || |- |MF ||16|| Garvin Houston || || |- |MF ||20||Nick Maxwell || || |- |FW ||12||Antony Zanini || || |- |FW ||8|| Ryan Gamble || || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Peter Pinizotto |} ==Individual awards == The annual Canadian National Soccer League awards ceremony was held at the Hollywood Princess Banquet Hall in Vaughan, Ontario with an attendance of 400 people.
