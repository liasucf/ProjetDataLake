    "text": "The Second Battle of Katwa occurred between the Bengal and Maratha Empire in December 1745. After the defeats of the Marathas in the first four invasions of Bengal (see Maratha invasions of Bengal), the Maratha General and ruler of Nagpur, Raghuji Bhonsle again invaded the territory of Bengal. Bhonsle, with 20,000 horsemen attacked the civilians of Murshidabad and moved onwards to Katwa. The Marathas met Alivardi Khan's army in Katwa and the battle had began. During the battle, most of the Marathas were slaughtered and the remainings Maratha soldiers under Raghuji Bhonsle retreated from Katwa. The Marathas then retreated towards Medinipur. The battle was a victory for Alivardi Khan who had once again ousted the Marathas from Bengal. After this battle, Alivardi Khan was known in Bengal as \"Maratha-khuni\" which translates to \"Maratha-killer\" in Bengali. == See also == * Maratha invasions of Bengal * First Battle of Katwa ==References== Katwa 1745 Katwa Category:1745 in India ",
