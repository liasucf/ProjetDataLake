    "text": "The Big South Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year is an annual college basketball award given to the Big South Conference's most outstanding player. The award was first given following the 1985\u201386 season, the first year the league competed in basketball competition. The most notable recipient of the Big South Player of the Year Award is Tony Dunkin. Dunkin, a 6'7\" (2.01 m) small forward, played for the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers from 1989 to 1993 and won the award all four seasons. He is the only NCAA Division I men's basketball player to ever earn four conference player of the year awards. Coastal Carolina, which left the Big South for the Sun Belt Conference after the 2015\u201316 season, has the most all-time awards with nine and individual winners with five. Among current members, High Point has the most awards with five, while High Point and Winthrop have the most individual winners with four each. The only established Big South members without any winners are three of the six newest members of the conference\u2014Presbyterian (joining in 2007), Gardner\u2013Webb (2008), and Longwood (2012). Although Campbell's current tenure in the Big South dates only to 2011, it has three winners from its first conference tenure (1983\u20131994). Two other schools without a winner, Hampton and USC Upstate, joined the conference in 2018. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | style=\"background-color:#CFECEC;\" | \u2020 |Co-Players of the Year |- | style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |* |Awarded a national Player of the Year award: Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year (1904\u201305 to 1978\u201379) UPI College Basketball Player of the Year (1954\u201355 to 1995\u201396) Naismith College Player of the Year (1968\u201369 to present) John R.
