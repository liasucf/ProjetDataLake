    "text": "Werner Drechsler (January 17, 1923 in M\u00fchlberg, Germany \u2013 March 12, 1944 in Papago Park, Arizona) was a German U-boat crewman during World War II. He served on , which was sunk off the Azores in 1943. When he was taken prisoner he enthusiastically cooperated with his captors, probably because his father had spent time in one of Adolf Hitler's Concentration Camps as a political prisoner. Eventually, United States Navy intelligence officers recruited Drechsler as a spy and placed him in a prisoner of war (POW) camp near Fort Meade, Maryland with other U-Boat sailors. After arrival, Drechsler worked undercover, befriending his fellow POWs in order to collect information regarding German submarine technology, operational procedures and tactics and any other intelligence which could be useful to the allies. On March 12, 1944 Drechsler was transferred to a different POW camp in Arizona which was filled mainly with other submariners of the Kriegsmarine. This transfer took place even though Drechsler was supposed to be kept segregated from other naval prisoners, particularly his former crewmates on the U-118, who were aware of Drechsler's spying activities. Drechsler's transfer to Arizona quickly had fatal results: some members of the U-118 were confined at the camp and they immediately recognised their former crewmate. Word of Drechsler's undercover activities spread rapidly through the camp, and a kangaroo court was convened while Drechsler was asleep. The other prisoners eventually decided that it was necessary to kill Drechsler to ensure he could no longer spy upon them, and also to act as a deterrent for any other POWs who might consider collaborating with the enemy. The next morning Drechsler was found hanging in the shower room. Seven men (Helmut Fischer, Fritz Franke, G\u00fcnter K\u00fclsen, Heinrich Ludwig, Bernhard Reyak, Otto Stengel and Rolf Wizny) were tried by a general court- martial and executed for the beating and hanging of Drechsler. In the last mass execution in the United States, the men were hanged on August 25, 1945 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. == See also == *Prisoner of war *Prisoner-of-war camp == References == * Richard Whittingham, Martial Justice: The Last Mass Execution in the United States, Naval Institute Press, 1997 == External links == * A community college historical website which explains the Werner Drechsler story in detail * website which follows history channel program about the mass execution * A number of photographs taken around the time of Drechsler's capture Category:1923 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Kriegsmarine personnel Category:Murdered military personnel Category:Submariners Category:German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United States Category:German people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners who died in United States military detention Category:Prisoners murdered in custody Category:German people murdered abroad ",
