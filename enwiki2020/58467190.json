Some Palestine Liberation Organization officials extended the claims in the 1970s and 1980s to include Jordan. The term is contrary to the terms Greater Syria and the Arab homeland. == History == In 1920, the United Kingdom established Mandatory Palestine over the south of the Levant between Sinai and Mandatory Iraq. The Emirate of Transjordan was set up as a British protectorate within the Palestine Mandate, but outside the stipulations of the Balfour Declaration. ===Jordan=== In a press conference Ahmad Shukeiri declared that Jordan is \"the homeland of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Jordan's people are its people.\" He also reminded that \"the return of the East Bank to the motherland, in mind and conscience, and in spirit and body, is a basic step on the road of the return of the stolen homeland.\" During the 1970\u201371 civil war that erupted in Jordan between Palestinian guerrilla groups and the Jordanian Army, the Palestinians managed to take control of some cities as Ramtha, Irbid, Jerash. In mid-1971, the PLO was defeated and exiled to Lebanon. This was seen as an attempt to take over all of Jordan as a first step to liberate the rest of \"historical Palestine\" as seen by PLO. The PLO until late 1980s continued to make irredentist claims by expressing their desire for Jordan to be part of the next Palestinian state. As of the early 1970s, the Palestinians began to be stereotyped [in Jordan]. Transjordanians started to refer to Palestinian-Jordanians as Baljikiyyah (Belgians). This epithet continues to be used as a national insult against Palestinian Jordanians today. A 1975 article by the PLO: Yasser Arafat in letter to Jordanian Students' Congress in Baghdad on 12 November 1974: Hamas mural in the West Bank ===From the River to the Sea=== From the River to the Sea () is, and forms part of, a popular political slogan used by some Palestinian nationalists. It contains the notion that the land which lies between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea be entirely placed under Arab rule at the cost of the State of Israel, excluding the contested Golan Heights, conquered from Syria in 1967 and unilaterally annexed in 1981. It has been used frequently by Arab leaders and is often chanted at anti-Israel demonstrations. The slogan is versatile with numerous variations including \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" \"Palestine is ours from the river to the sea,\" \"Palestine is Islamic from the river to the sea,\" Islamic scholars also claim the Mahdi will also declare the slogan in the following format: \"Jerusalem is Arab Muslim, and Palestine \u2014 all of it, from the river to the sea \u2014 is Arab Muslim.\" == See also == * Palestinian nationalism * Paulet\u2013Newcombe Agreement * Treaty of London (1946) * King Hussein's federation plan * Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank == Bibliography == * == References == Category:Irredentism Category:Palestinian nationalism ",
