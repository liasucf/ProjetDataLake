Though she wasn't an established writer at the time, she attempted to write a script. She recalls, \"It was a disaster. I never sent it. I didn't know the correct format. I didn't know the address of where to send it, and then I thought, they can't really hire me until I finish junior high anyway.\" ==Linguistics studies== Espenson studied linguistics as an undergraduate and graduate at University of California, Berkeley.
