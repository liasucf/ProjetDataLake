As of 2008, it competes in the Virginia High School League. ==History== Spotswood High School had its formal beginning in 1973 when the County School Board authorized an Eastern Rockingham building study and requested a report on a proposed new high school for eastern Rockingham County. A committee, composed of community persons from the Elkton and Montevideo attendance areas, as well as Central Office staff members, three Principals and several teachers from both Montevideo and Elkton High Schools, was organized to develop the education specifications for the proposed new plant. Although the proposal to build the new school was not implemented at this time, the work of the educational specifications committee served as a foundation for the planning of the present school. During the summer of 1976 the School Board voted to build a senior high school, grades 10-12, to house Montevideo and Elkton High School students. A committee of twenty-one people was appointed to draft a set of educational specifications for the proposed new facility. The committee completed its report during the 1976-1977 school year, and later revised it when a specific starting date for construction was established. Specific plans for names, nicknames, and colors were developed by a committee of nine persons that made final reports to the School Board in December 1978. The School Board reviewed the report and voted to name to the school the Spotswood Senior High School, in memory of Alexander Spotswood. The Board decided to leave the decision for the school's nickname and colors to the administration and students. Spotswood High School was established in 1980 as Spotswood Senior High School, serving grades 10-12. James Upperman was the first principal. The school was named in honor of Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Spotswood. The school colors, blue and gray, were selected from the colors of the two high schools it consolidated in the 1980s: Elkton High School (blue and gold) and Montevideo (maroon and gray). Elkton's High School color was actually navy blue but a royal blue was used instead. The official nickname selected was Trailblazers even though it is rarely used. In the fall of 1984, Spotswood became a 9-12 school and changed to its present name, Spotswood High School. In 2009, Rockingham County Public Schools took notice of the increased population in the eastern portion of Rockingham County and opened its fourth high school, East Rockingham High School. The opening of ERHS alleviated the overcrowding problem at Spotswood and cut the enrollment of the school in half. ==Current administration== *Principal- Rad Dansey *Asst.

The students come from several small towns and unincorporated communities in the area, such as Penn Laird and Keezletown. In 2008, the student body population was reported by the Board of Education to have the following enrollment characteristics.U.S. Department of Education In 2008, the student population was approaching 1500, but after the new East Rockingham High School opened in 2009, the overcrowding problem was alleviated temporarily. In 2020, students from the Grottoes area were moved to East Rockingham High School due to further overcrowding.https://www.dnronline.com/news/rockingham_county/school-board- approves-redistricting/article_1b8a19a6-7807-5656-8add-0776afe5901f.html *Grade {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! 9th ! 10th ! 11th ! 12th |- |213 |214 |214 |211 |} *Gender {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The marching band performs at every home football game on Friday nights, as well as various competitions throughout the fall.SpotswoodBand.net http://spotswoodband.net/ May 4th 2007 ==Controversy== Spotswood made headlines briefly in 2000, when teacher Jeff Newton, with the backing of freedom of speech advocacy organizations including the ACLU and American Library Association, went to court over an incident covering several weeks in September 1999, when then principal C. James Slye ordered Newton to remove anticensorship pamphlets from his classroom's door that had been posted in observance of Banned Books Week. The pamphlet in question was a list of books that had been challenged or banned in schools, libraries and bookstores around the country during the late 1990s; these books include several revered and widely read American works, such as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Color Purple, Of Mice and Men and Death of a Salesman, but also include highly sexualized or \"vulgar\" books that the US Supreme Court found legal to exclude from public schools in the 1982 case of Board of Education v. Pico. The ACLU charged that Spotswood was effectively censoring the anticensorship message of the pamphlet outside of his constitutional rights and blatantly failed to follow the Rockingham County School Board Policy for mediating issues related to controversial and sensitive materials. The suit was dismissed before the case could be heard, when Newton resigned from the district. ==Notable alumni== *Daryl Irvine, Former MLB player (Boston Red Sox) RIP Michael Roadcap, you will be missed. ==References== ==External links== * *History of Spotswood High School *Spotswood Athletics Category:Educational institutions established in 1980 Category:Public high schools in Virginia Category:Schools in Rockingham County, Virginia Category:1980 establishments in Virginia ",
