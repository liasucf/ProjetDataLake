After four daughters with his first wife Vanavan Madevi (Viji Chandrasekhar), Ranasingam sought after a new bride, to beget a son. Afraid of losing her status to a stranger, Vanavan arranged a marriage between Ranasingam and her younger sister, Panchavan Madhevi (Bhanupriya). Five months after Panchavan became pregnant, Ranasingam's eldest daughter Mangamma Rani (Mounika) became pregnant out of wedlock and Ranasingam's family arranged her marriage to her boyfriend, Thamarai Manala Sendayar (Saravanan). With both the stepdaughter and stepmother pregnant, odds went against Ranasingam as Panchavan gave birth to a girl while his elder daughter had a boy. Ranasingam was heartbroken and stopped worrying for a boy child. 8 years later, Vanavan became accidentally pregnant and finally gave birth to a boy, who was named Gunasingam. At the present, Gunasingam is a 27 year old, 10th graduate, and a contented and happy farmer who practices natural farming and lives in peace. He has two major concerns: 1\\. His eldest sister's husband Thamarai and next sister's husband Malligai Manala Sendayar (G. Marimuthu) are at loggerheads for 10 years, despite being blood brothers. This is due to a court feud over inheritance and is complicated by the fact that Malligai has no pregnancy. 2\\. He must decide whether to marry either Poompozhil Chellamma (Priya Bhavani Shankar) (daughter of his 3rd sister) or Aandal Priyadarshini (Arthana Binu) (daughter of his only step-sister), as it is a societal norm in South India, for a man to marry his elder sister's daughter in rural areas. However, problems arise when Gunasingam falls head over heels for Kannukiniyal \"Iniya\" (Sayyeshaa), the daughter of a rich man named Thillainayagam (Ponvannan) whose sister Ranasingam had suddenly left during engagement to oversee birth of his 4th daughter. Despite resistance from Iniya's family, Ranasingam agrees to the match under the condition that Gunasingam must convince his sisters that he cannot marry their daughters. Also, Iniya's uncle Kodiyarasu (Shatru) was jailed by the work of Gunasingam and seeks to get revenge by killing him. When Chellamma comes to know about Gunasingam's decision, she attempts suicide but is saved. Panchavan vacates Ranasingam's house because she feels that her elder sister continuously commits injustices against her, like arranging her marriage without her permission, getting Panchavan's only daughter married to an ill drunkard who died in a year, and now refusing to marry her granddaughter Andal to Gunasingam. As revenge, Kodiyarasu offers to marry Chellamma, and that offer is accepted. Also, Thamarai is willing to attend the marriage only if his brother does not not, and the same is the case with Malligai. Finally, Gunasingam gathers all his relatives to his grandmother's function and convinces them after a moving speech. Later, Kodiyarasu is beaten up by Gunasingam and sent back to prison. Meanwhile, Gunasingam's brothers-in-law amend their dispute and everyone attends Gunasingam's wedding to Iniya. A year later, Gunasingam and Iniya give birth a girl and choose to adapt to permanent birth control to ensure that past events do not repeat themselves. == Cast == * Karthi as Perunazhi Gunasingam (Kadaikutty Singam) * Sathyaraj as Perunazhi Ranasingam, Gunasingam's father * Sayyeshaa as Kannukiniyal \"Iniya\", Gunasingam's love interest * Arthana Binu as Aandal Priyadarshini, Padmavathi's daughter * Priya Bhavani Shankar as Poompozhil Chellamma, Samyuktha's daughter * Soori as Sivagamiyin Selvan, Mangamma's son * Bhanupriya as Panchavan Madhevi, Ranasingam's second wife and Vanavan Madevi's sister * Viji Chandrasekhar as Vanavan Madevi, Ranasingam's first wife * Saroja as Angaiyarkanni Anbukarasi, Perunazhi Ranasingam's mother * Mounika as Mangamma Rani (Sathi Leelavathi/Saamiyadi), Ranasingam's first daughter * Saravanan as Thamarai Manala Sendayar, Mangamma's husband and 1st son-in-law of Ranasingam * Deepa Shankar as Velunachiar Rani (Sandakozhi/Action King), Ranasingam's second daughter * G.

Pandiraj revealed that Karthi would play the role of a passionate farmer and the only male child in a family with five elder sisters. The director succeeded in convincing Sathyaraj to play the character of Karthi's father, while he cast Sayyeshaa as the main female lead despite initial reservations whether she would aptly portray a village character. The makers held talks with Anupama Parameswaran for a Second leading female role, but later selected Arthana Binu. Priya Bhavani Shankar, who gained acclaim through her debut film role in Meyaadha Maan (2017), was signed to portray another leading female role. Other actors selected for the film included Soori, Bhanupriya, Yuvarani, Mounika (actress), Viji Chandrasekhar and Ponvannan. The shoot of the film began on 9 November 2017 in Chennai, with the cast and crew assembling for a launch ceremony. In early January 2018, the team moved to continue the shoot in Thenkasi and Puliyankudi. The film ran into trouble with Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) when the team shot a rekla (bullock cart race) scene sequence in spite of AWBI denying permission. The producers had previously approached the AWBI for permission to shoot the scene which involved 211 cows and oxen, 48 cocks and 32 birds. The board, however, denied permission citing that the Supreme Court has banned the sport. The breach had come to light after Suriya had uploaded a video of him and his son visiting the shoot location in Karaikudi. Rajasekar Pandian, a manager of 2D Entertainment, later said that the team got the required permission from the District Collector of Pudukottai, who permitted the president of the Rekla Federation of Tamil Nadu to conduct the race. So, the makers chose to use the opportunity of the race to include such scenes of rekla racing in the film. The promotion of the film also proceeded by actor Karthi and Soori in the ongoing reality TV series Bigg Boss Tamil 2. ==Release== The satellite rights of the film were sold to STAR Vijay. == Soundtrack == The soundtrack was composed by D. Imman, making his first collaboration with Karthi and director Pandiraj. The soundtrack rights were acquired by Sony Music. The album features eight songs, with three karaoke versions. The audio launch for the film was held on 11 June 2018. After the film's release, the makers released five more songs as bonus tracks on 16 July 2018. The soundtrack album for the Telugu version Chinna Babu was released on 24 June 2018. ==Box office== The film collected about in Tamil Nadu on first week. According to trade sources, the film has grossed a whopping in just two weeks in Tamil Nadu and continued to run to packed houses. == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Date of Ceremony !Award !Category !Recipient(s) and nominee(s) !Result !Ref. |- | rowspan=\"1\" | 5 January 2019 | rowspan=\"1\" | Ananda Vikatan Cinema Awards | Best Popular Film | 2D Entertainment | | rowspan=\"1\" | |- | rowspan=\"4\" | 16 August 2019 | rowspan=\"4\" | 8th South Indian International Movie Awards | Best Actor | Karthi | |- | Best Comedian | Soori | |- | Best Film | 2D Entertainment | |- | Best Director | Pandiraj | |} == References == == External links == * Category:2018 films Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:2018 action drama films Category:Indian films Category:Indian action drama films Category:Films scored by D.
