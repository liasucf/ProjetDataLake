A dancer at the Com\u00e9die Italienne of Paris in 1757-1758, he stayed in Vienna from 1759 to 1761 and performed particularly in ballets by Charles Bernardy and Gasparo Angiolini. Back to the Com\u00e9die Italienne in 1761\u20131762, he was hired by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie in Brussels, with his wife Marie-Ren\u00e9e Malter, a relative of the Malter dancers. Called to the court of Sweden, he was principal dancer of the Royal Swedish Ballet directed by Louis Gallodier until 1772. After he returned to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien of Paris as ballet master, he was recalled to Stockholm the following year and remained there until 1776. Charles-Louis Didelot was one of his pupils. Back in France, Frossard and his wife settled in Lyon, where they led a troupe of children from 1782 to 1785.
