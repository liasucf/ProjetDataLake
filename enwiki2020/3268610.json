    "text": "Happy Hour is the fifth studio album by experimental music band King Missile, and released on December 15, 1992 by Atlantic Records. The album is exactly one hour long, hence its title. ==Reception== Ned Ragget of AllMusic awarded the album four out of five stars and said \"due in part to the return of Kramer to production \u2013 or in this case co-production \u2013 duties, along with a slew of more immediately memorable songs, Happy Hour trumps The Way to Salvation as the peak of the band's high-profile days, an inspired collection of tunes ranging from deranged pop to full-on epic metal stomp.\" The critic also said \"thanks to a catchy arrangement via Rick's clipped, stuttered guitar riff and the sweetly sung title phrase in the background, the result is giddy left- field nonsense.\" and \"it's the blessed liveliness of the whole album \u2013 at a premium in the days of full-on grunge when it came out, still rare enough years later \u2013 that makes it stand up so well.\" Trouser Press said \"Hall's surreal accounts have the vivid sense of purpose previously absent; he\u2019s not aiming at eliciting wan smiles, he\u2019s trying to provoke intelligent thought\" and \"meanwhile, the band (drummer Roger Murdock is that new face in the booklet photo) locks into diverse rock grooves that would be worth hearing even without the vocals.\" Robert Christgau chose the band's hit single \"Detachable Penis\" as the album's \"choice cut\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from the Happy Hour liner notes.
