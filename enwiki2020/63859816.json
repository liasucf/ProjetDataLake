    "text": "Bathysmatophorinae is a small subfamily in the family Cicadellidae (leafhoppers). ==Description== Bathysmatophorinae is a rare and primitive leafhopper subfamily, with a robust appearance and dull brown or grey colouration. They resemble members of the subfamily Evacanthinae, of which they used to be a part. Many females of this subfamily have short and stubby wings that cannot produce flight. ==Distribution== These leafhoppers are found in temperate environments and have only been recorded in the Northern Hemisphere in the Palearctic and Neararctic. In the United States and Canada, they are most often found in the Pacific Northwest, although they can be found farther inland as well. They are found on Dicotyledon trees, shrubs, and ferns. ==Tribes and genera== There are two tribes in the subfamily.
