    "text": "John Morton Leiper (17 February 1921 -- 17 July 2006), or more commonly known as Jack Leiper, was an English cricketer. He was a left-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler and wicket-keeper who played for Essex. He was born in Woodford Green. Having originally played for Essex's Second XI during the 1948 Minor Counties Championship, it was two years before Leiper made his first-class debut, against Gloucestershire in the 1950 County Championship. Leiper had a difficult debut, scoring 6 and 0 runs during the game. He made his second and final first-class appearance less than a week later, against Somerset, in which, despite making a duck in the first innings, he scored a brilliant innings of 44 before being caught out by Maurice Tremlett, grandfather of current England Test cricketer Chris. Leiper remained in the Essex tailend for the entirety of his short first-class career. ==References== ==External links== *Jack Leiper at Cricket Archive Category:1921 births Category:2006 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Essex cricketers ",
