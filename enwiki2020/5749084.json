    "text": "Sodium trichloroacetate is a chemical compound with a formula of CCl3CO2Na. It is used to increase sensitivity and precision during transcript mapping. == Preparation == Sodium trichloroacetate is made by reaction trichloroacetic acid with sodium hydroxide: :CCl3CO2H + NaOH -> CCl3CO2Na + H2O == Reactions == === Basicity === Sodium trichloroacetate is a weaker base than sodium acetate because of the electron-withdrawing nature of the trichloromethyl group. Sodium trifluoroacetate is likewise an weaker base. However, it can easily be protonated in the presence of suitably strong acids: :CCl3CO2- + H2SO4 -> CCl3CO2H + HSO4- === Trichloromethyl-anion precursor === This reagent is useful for introducing the trichloromethyl group into other molecules. Decarboxylation produces the trichloromethyl anion, which is a sufficiently strong nucleophile to attack various carbonyl functional groups, such as aldehydes, carboxylic acid anhydrides, ketones (making a precursor for the Jocic\u2013Reeve reaction), and acyl halides. == See also == * Trichloroacetic acid * Sodium trifluoroacetate * Sodium chloroacetate == References == Category:Organic sodium salts Category:Trichloromethyl compounds ",
