The club are affiliated to the Lancashire Football Association. The club's colours are yellow shirts and dark blue shorts. ==History== The original Eagley FC was formed in 1874. It was one of the first clubs in Lancashire playing under association football rules. The club was one of the founder members of the Lancashire County Football Association in 1878, and in 1878\u201379 it was the first recorded opponents of Preston North End, later to become the first ever English football champions. That season Eagley was the winner of the Turton Football Club Challenge Cup, the first football cup played for in Lancashire, and entered the FA Cup for the first time. In 1879\u201380, Eagley was one of the competitors in the first Lancashire Cup competition. With the rise of professional football, the original Eagley FC was disbanded. Many years later it was revived as Eagley Mills FC, which played in the Manchester League and in 1959\u201360 was the winner of the Lancashire Amateur Shield. The club declined in the 1970s until 1980 when a group of local enthusiasts stepped in to try to revive Eagley to some of its former glories. In 1981, the club appointed the ex-Walker Institute player Paul Thompson as manager with Peter Conroy as his assistant. This led to a further period of success in the Combination plus a Lancashire Junior Shield Final appearance, losing 3\u20132 to Latham & Burscough and a 2\u20131 Hospital Cup Final victory over Little Hulton. A new phase of the club's history was entered into on joining the West Lancashire League for the 1988\u201389 season. After two seasons settling into the league, the club appointed Terry Finney as team manager. Soon after, the club had success, being promoted to the Premier Division as champions. Finney's success continued over the next eight seasons with the club making appearances in the West Lancashire Presidents and Richardson's Cup finals, along with four Hospital Cup finals, winning two. However, during this period the club suffered a major blow when the clubhouse was completely destroyed by fire in August 1992. The Football and Cricket Clubs joined together to build a new clubhouse which is still used today. From December 2013 to 2014, the club was managed by former Wales and Wigan Athletic striker Simon Haworth. ==Honours== *West Lancashire League Premier Division **Runners-up 2003\u201304 *West Lancashire League Division Two **Champions 1990\u201391 ==Records== *FA Cup **Fourth Round 1882\u201383 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Sport in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton Category:Association football clubs established in 1874 Category:Football clubs in England Category:1874 establishments in England Category:West Lancashire Football League ",
