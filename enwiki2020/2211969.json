    "text": "An administrative centre is a seat of regional administration or local government, or a county town, or the place where the central administration of a commune is located. In countries with French as one of their administrative languages (such as Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland or many African countries) and in some other countries (such as Italy, cf. cognate capoluogo), a chef- lieu (, plural form chefs-lieux, literally \"chief place\" or \"head place\"), is a town or city that is pre-eminent from an administrative perspective. The \u2018f\u2019 in chef-lieu is pronounced, in contrast to chef-d'oeuvre where it is mute. ==Algeria== The capital of an Algerian Province is called a chef-lieu. The capital of a district, the next largest division, is also called a chef-lieu. While the capital of the lowest division, the municipalities, is called agglomeration de chef-lieu (chef-lieu agglomeration) and is abbreviated as A.C.L. ==Belgium== The chef-lieu in Belgium is the administrative centre of each of the ten Provinces of Belgium. Three of these cities also give their name to their province (Antwerp, Li\u00e8ge and Namur). ==Luxembourg== Luxembourg is divided into two judicial arrondissements (Luxembourg City, Diekirch), three administrative districts (Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher), four electoral circonscriptions (constituencies), twelve cantons and one hundred and five communes (municipalities; Luxembourgish: Gemengen). Arrondissements, districts and cantons have each a chef-lieu and are named after it. The same is true for each commune which is composed of more than one town or village. Usually (with a few exceptions), the commune is named after the communal chef- lieu. ==France== The chef-lieu of a d\u00e9partement is known as the pr\u00e9fecture. This is the town or city where the prefect of the d\u00e9partment (and all services under his/her control) is situated, in a building known as the prefecture. In every French region, one of the d\u00e9partments has pre-eminence over the others, and the prefect carries the title of Prefect of region X\u2026, Prefect of Department Z\u2026 and the city where the regional prefect is found is known as chef-lieu of the region or, more commonly, Regional prefecture. The services are, however, controlled by the prefecture of the d\u00e9partment. The chef-lieu of an arrondissement, commonly known as the sous-pr\u00e9fecture is the city or town where the sub-prefect of the arrondissement (and the services directly under his/her control) is situated, in a building called the sub-prefecture. The arrondissement where the d\u00e9partement prefecture is located does not normally have a sub-prefect or sub-prefecture, the administration being devolved usually to the Secretary-general of the departmental prefecture, who functions as sub-prefect for the arrondissement. The chef-lieu of a canton is usually the biggest city or town within the canton, but has only a nominal role. No specific services are controlled by it. In past decades, there was always a Gendarmerie, a treasurer and a justice of the peace. The chef-lieu of a commune is the principal area of the town or city that gives the commune its name, the other areas of the town being called hamlets. French typographers will use a capital for the \u2018Le\u2019 or \u2018La\u2019 preceding the name of places having \u2018chef-lieu of town\u2019 status, and lowercase \u2018le\u2019 or \u2018la\u2019 for hamlets. ==Jordan== In the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the administrative centres are known as \"chief towns\" or nahias. Nahias may be in charge of a sub-district (qda), a district (liwa), or a governorate (muhafazah). ==New Caledonia== The chef-lieu indicates the principal city of the provinces of New Caledonia. So Noum\u00e9a is the chef-lieu of South Province. But the chef-lieu can also mean the principal area within a town. So W\u00e9 is part of the town of Lifou, but is the chef-lieu of Lifou. In the Loyalty Islands and the other islands, the name of the chef- lieu differs from that of the name of the town. For the towns of the mainland, the chef-lieu has the same name as the town. Noum\u00e9a is a town composed only of Noum\u00e9a. ==Francophone West Africa== Many of the West African states which gained independence from France in the mid-20th century also inherited the French administrative structure of Departments and Communes, headed by a Chief-Lieu. States still using Chief-Lieu to identify the administrative headquarters of a government subdivision include Senegal, Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali, and Niger.Bierschenk T., Olivier de Sardan, J.\u2011P. (eds), 1998, \"Les ar\u00e8nes locales face \u00e0 la d\u00e9centralisation et d\u00e9mocratisation. Analyses comparatives en milieu rural b\u00e9ninois\", in Bierschenk T. & Olivier de Sardan J.-P. (eds), Les pouvoirs au village. Le B\u00e9nin rural entre d\u00e9mocratisation et d\u00e9centralisation, Paris, Karthala : 11\u201151. Taking Niger and Mali as examples, the administrative subdivisions down to the Commune level each have a formal place of administrative headquarters, titled the chef-lieu. The larger portion of the terminology of administrative division is inherited from colonial rule as part of French West Africa, and has survived and been somewhat modified over time. In both nations there have been remarkably parallel histories.Claude Fay [La d\u00e9centralisation dans un Cercle (Tenenkou, Mali). Autrepart: Logiques identitaires, logiques territoriales, 2000, IRD http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl- doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/autrepart/010021949.pdf#page=122]. With the decentralization process begun in both nations in the 1990s, the chef-lieu has transitioned from the location of the Governor, Commandant, or Prefect and their staff, to the location of Commune, Cercles of Mali/Departments of Niger, and Regional Councils and a variety of decentralized bodies.Br\u00e9hima B\u00e9ridogo, [\u00ab Processus de D\u00e9centralisation au Mali et Couches Sociales Marginalis\u00e9es \u00bb, Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997 http://apad.revues.org/581]for Mali, see Br\u00e9hima Kassibo, [\u00ab La D\u00e9centralisation au Mali : \u00c9tat des Lieux \u00bb, Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997 http://apad.revues.org/579] The chefs-lieux of a Region, Cercle or D\u00e9partement, is usually also a Communal chef-lieu. Both nations collect these councils in a \"High Council of Collectivites\" seated at the nation's capital. Smaller sub-divisions in Mali's Communes (Villages, Tribal councils, Quarters) are administered from or identified as a Place/Site (Site in French), so the chef-lieu is literally the Chief-Place even at the lowest level.REPUBLIQUE DU NIGER Loi n\u00b0 2002-017 du 11 JUIN 2002 d\u00e9terminant le r\u00e9gime financier des R\u00e9gions, des D\u00e9partements et des Communes.Loi n\u00b0 2002-014 du 11 JUIN 2002 portant cr\u00e9ation des communes et fixant le nom de leurs chefs- lieux. Includes list of 213 communes rurales and seats, 52 Communes urbaines and seats. ==Russia== In Russia, the term is applied to the inhabited localities, which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels. The only exception to this rule is the republics, for which the term \"capital\" is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an entity to which the term \"administrative centre\" does not apply. A similar arrangement exists in Ukraine. ==Sweden== In Sweden there are two levels of administrative centre; the local municipal and the regional county. ===Central locality === Central locality (Swedish: \"centralort\") is a term commonly ascribed to the settlement that serves as a municipal administrative centre. This level handles the local administrative and political tasks of the surrounding settlements. Since central place theory was the guiding principle during the municipal reform 1962\u20131977, most municipalities were dominated by a larger urban area where the political seat was located. Most municipalities are named for their central locality, but there are several exceptions. There are many deviations from the central locality principle. Some municipalities are dominated by two or more towns of similar size, and sometimes they share the municipal administration, with the municipality having its official address in one of the towns. For example, both Skillingaryd and Vaggeryd are central localities of Vaggeryd Municipality. Conversely, there are municipalities within metropolitan areas. For example, there are twenty-six municipalities within the Stockholm metropolitan area. The term central locality has no legal standing and it is unclear how it should be applied to these municipalities. Some municipalities appointing one or several localities to be the central locality. ===Residence city === A residence city (Swedish: \"residensstad\") is the town or city which is the political and administrative seat of the county. This level handles the more regional political and administrative tasks of the county, such as healthcare and public transport. The name comes from that this is the town or city where the governor (Swedish: \"landsh\u00f6vding\") have their residence. There are some exceptions to this, however. In the newer amalgamated \"greater counties\", often referred to as \"regions\", the administrative centre is placed in one of the older residence cities. Examples of this is Malm\u00f6 in Region Scania and Gothenburg in the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland Region. ==Switzerland== The term chef-lieu is applied to the capital of each Swiss canton. In 16 of the 26 cantons, the territory is subdivided into districts. Every district also has a city nominated as chef- lieu and each has a prefect. ==Tunisia== The term chef-lieu is used to designate the capital of each gouvernorat (department). Each of the 24 gouvernorats is subdivided into delegations (districts) which each have a central city as chef-lieu of delegation. ==United Kingdom== In the United Kingdom it is the centre of a local authority, which is distinct from a historic county with a county town. ==Popular culture== * The Fianc\u00e9e of the pirate (1969) is a film by Nelly Kaplan, where the action takes place in a hamlet where everyone spends their time worrying about what everyone thinks about the chef-lieu of the town. ==See also== *Local government *Seat of local government *Chef-lieu, administrative centres in Algeria, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, and Tunisia *County seat, administrative centres in the USA *County town, administrative centres in Ireland and the UK ==References== Category:Government Category:Types of country subdivisions Category:Regions ",
