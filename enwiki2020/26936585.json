    "text": "This is a list of members of the Tasmanian Legislative Council from 2010 to 2014. Terms of the Legislative Council do not coincide with House of Assembly elections, with members serving six-year terms, and two or three members facing re-election every year. The members have been categorised here according to the four-year terms of the House of Assembly so as to avoid the need for separate member lists for each year. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" !
