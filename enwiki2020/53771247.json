    "text": "Rebecca Longo (born March 17, 1999) is an American football kicker who became the first woman to earn a college football scholarship to an NCAA school at the Division II level or higher when she signed a letter of intent with Adams State University. She attended Basha High School in Chandler, Arizona and started playing football competitively her sophomore year. In 2014, she was a junior varsity kicker at Queen Creek High in Arizona, but after transferring to Basha High she was forced to sit out her junior year. In her final year of high school, she converted 35 extra points on 38 attempts and was successful on her lone field goal attempt of the season of 30 yards. She did not handle kickoff duties. She was listed as 5 foot 11 inches tall and 140 pounds. After a redshirt year, and an ankle injury during the 2018 season, Longo left Adams State without attempting a kick or playing a down in a game. She announced via her social media that she wished to \"pursue other opportunities\", presumably at other universities. In September 2019, Longo announced that she had joined the Gila River Hawks of the newly formed 4-team Hohokam Junior College Athletic Conference. Through the first 2 games of the season, she was 4-for-7 in PATs and was successful on one field goal attempt of 22 yards. == See also == * List of female American football players == References == == External links == * Adams State bio * Profile on Maxpreps Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:American football placekickers Category:Adams State Grizzlies football players Category:Female players of American football Category:Sportspeople from Chandler, Arizona Category:Players of American football from Arizona ",
