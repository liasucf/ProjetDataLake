Six new franchises were introduced with the aim of creating a stronger top-tier of sides underpinned by a second-tier tournament that was based around the old provincial teams, who play in a provincial championship that is currently (2007\u201308) called the South African Airways Provincial Three-Day Challenge. The rebranded SuperSport Series teams are: * Cape Cobras in Cape Town and Paarl * Dolphins in Durban * Eagles in Bloemfontein * Lions in Johannesburg and Potchefstroom * Titans in Centurion, Gauteng and Benoni * Warriors in Port Elizabeth and East London ===SuperSport Series from 2000\u201301=== * 2000\u201301 Western Province * 2001\u201302 KwaZulu-Natal * 2002\u201303 Easterns * 2003\u201304 Western Province the competition was rebranded in 2004 with the introduction of franchise teams * 2004\u201305 Eagles and Dolphins shared * 2005\u201306 Dolphins and Titans shared * 2006\u201307 Titans * 2007\u201308 Eagles * 2008\u201309 Titans * 2009\u201310 Cape Cobras * 2010\u201311 ===MTN Championship / Standard Bank Cup winners=== * 2000\u201301 KwaZulu Natal * 2001\u201302 KwaZulu Natal * 2002\u201303 Western Province * 2003\u201304 Gauteng * 2004\u201305 Eagles * 2005\u201306 Eagles * 2006\u201307 Cape Cobras * 2007\u201308 Titans * 2008\u201309 Titans * 2009\u201310 Warriors * 2010\u201311 ===Pro20 Series (Twenty20) winners=== * 2003\u201304 Eagles * 2004\u201305 Titans * 2005\u201306 Eagles * 2006\u201307 Lions * 2007\u201308 Titans * 2008\u201309 Cape Cobras * 2009\u201310 Warriors * 2010\u201311 ===Provincial Three-Day Challenge winners=== This is a first-class championship for the provincial teams and so is effectively the descendant of the old Currie Cup.
