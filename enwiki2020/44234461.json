The in silico team have been recruited from the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, DTU, and The Bioinstitute at Aalborg University, Campus Copenhagen. ==Operations== Barentzymes brings to the market new enzymes for industrial biotechnology application, initially with a focus on bio-degradation of biological resources for food and non-food applications.http://barentsobserver.com/en/business/2014/05/special-arctic- dna-spurs-high-tech-business-24-05 The company was selected for a visit by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (Norway) in recognition of its work in the field of biotechnology.http://www.itromso.no/nyheter/article10271521.ece#navClose Barentzymes is focused on the development of new original enzymes from the genetic resources of the Barents Sea.http://www.the- european.eu/story-8176/barentzymes-customer-driven-innovation-industrial- enzymes-market.html Barentzymes uses a bioinformatic approach known as Peptide Pattern Recognition principle (PPR) to discover new \u03b2-glucosidases from Mucor circinelloides. Barentzymes have in its team experts who have developed a new advanced discovery platform that allows to profile new enzyme\u2019s properties already at the sequence level. This ability to predict properties of an enzyme on an in silico level makes it possible for Barentzymes to reduce time and costs from the moment of the development of an enzyme to the testing of an enzyme for customer\u2019s specific applications. Barentzymes work with specific needs of a customer and produce tailored solutions that solve a customer's particular problem.
