It is neither a treaty nor legally binding international agreementAlthough not a treaty or legally binding international agreement, the Terezin Declaration that resulted from the Prague Conference is a remarkable document The Holocaust-Era Assets Conference in Prague and Its Outcome Julius Berman Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs Volume 4, 2010 - Issue 2 The Holocaust Era Assets Conference took place in Terez\u00edn, Czech Republic, the site of the Theresienstadt Ghetto. A year later 43 of the signatories (excluding Belarus, Malta, Russia and Poland) endorsed a companion document, the 2010 Guidelines and Best Practices for the Restitution and Compensation of Immovable (Real) Property, which set best practices for immovable property. According to the guidelines restitution of the property itself (in rem) is preferred, however when that is not possible payment or substitute property that is \"genuinely fair and adequate\" is possible.The declaration has no legal power and doesn't define how countries involved should act to fulfill it.Witold Jurasz: Ustawa 447, czy miedzy panika a chowaniem glowy w piasek Onet.pl 16 May 2019. Retrieved 19 December 2019. During the Holocaust, plunder of Jewish property took place in an organized and comprehensive scale. Following the war, while some Jews received their property back, this tended to be the exception. People who held on to plundered property considered it their own and resented survivors who came back to claim their property. While many countries passed laws on restitution, in many case these were in effect in name only, and in Eastern Europe were often in effect only for a few years. The Terezin declaration was passed in 2009 as a result of what US ambassador Stuart E. Eizenstat termed \"the unfinished business of World War II\". In addition to restitution to survivors and heirs, the Terezin Declaration states that in some states heirless property (which devolved to the state) could serve as a basis for addressing the material necessities of needy Holocaust (Shoah) survivors and to ensure ongoing education about the Holocaust (Shoah), its causes and consequences.Terazin Declaration The Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today (JUST) Act of 2017, requires the United States Department of State to report to congress on steps that the signatories of the Terezin Declaration have taken to compensate Holocaust survivors and their heirs for assets seized by Nazi Germany and post-war communist governments. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Aftermath of the Holocaust Category:2009 in law Category:Human rights instruments Category:Global ethics Category:2009 in the Czech Republic ",
