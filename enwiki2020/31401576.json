He went to University of Manchester to study Physics but left to pursue his interests in Film. He worked at The Ha\u00e7ienda nightclub as a resident filmmaker and VJ, creating visuals and lighting effects to project in the club space. The nascent indie scene around Factory Records and dance music scene around The Ha\u00e7ienda assisted his entry into music videos. ==Directing career== In 1986 Jacobs formed Swivel with three other partners as a video production company and creative team. Early music videos by Swivel included work for A Guy Called Gerald, James (band), The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Sundays and 808 State. In 1989 a small article in i-D Magazine helped draw more attention from major record labels and Jacobs moved back to London to set up the Swivel office concentrating on video production. In 1993 Jacobs directed videos for Tears for Fears, Texas and Steps and joined the American company Squeak Pictures. His subsequent career has included a wide variety of musical acts including, Moby, The Corrs, Gary Barlow, Midge Ure, Phil Collins, BBMak, and Cradle of Filth.
