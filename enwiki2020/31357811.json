OBARC Library Archive The archives of the Ottoman Bank chronicled a process beginning with the establishment of the bank in 1856, through the 1930s. In addition to documenting the history of banking and finance, the archive encompassed a broader research area that included the process of modernization in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. To this purpose, its archives were supplemented with collections obtained through collaboration with other institutions, through donations, and through acquisitions. To date, more than 1,300,000 documents have been made accessible in digital format to researchers. The archive's Documentation Annex housed digital copies of visual materials such as the Oriental Trade Directories (Annuaire Oriental du Commerce); newspapers and magazines; monographs; statistics; reports; documents pertaining to prominent families in Turkey; trade correspondence; postage stamps; copper, nickel, silver, gold coins and paper money; decorations, medals, and badges; calling cards and postcards; photographs and portraits; blueprints and maps. The Documentation Annex also contained visual records of the materials used in exhibitions hosted by OBARC. Records kept by the Italian Consulate in Istanbul documenting the Italian presence in the late Ottoman Empire were also included in the archive.\"Ottoman Bank Archives and Research Centre. The Italian Embassy Archives \" Although a large part of this archival material relates to the period between 1870 and 1900, the collection more specifically covers the years from 1847 to 1925. The Italian consular records shed light on leading Italian associations of the time; on the activities of Italian institutions, such as hospitals and schools; and on trade correspondence maintained between foreign companies, both within the Ottoman Empire and abroad. Other archives digitalized in OBARC's collection included the archives of the Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Galata and the original papers of the World Council of Churches in Geneva. Dating back to the 18th century, the Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul archives document the Latin community in Galata, as well as the transformation of this area over a span of more than two centuries. The first catalogue, prepared by Fr. Benedetto Palazzo in 1939 and published in Italian in 2002, was examined, itemized, translated, and finally converted into digital format. The original papers are preserved in the Church Archive. The World Council of Churches archives cover the period from 1950 to 1980 and include 472 folders dealing with ecumenical assistance provided to refugees arriving in Turkey. A selection of these documents dating back to an earlier period concern the assistance given by the Union of Evangelical Congregational Churches in Bulgaria and the United Church Board for World Ministries in the U.S. In 2008, in honor of the centenary of the birth of Turkish architect Sedad Hakk\u0131 Eldem, the Ottoman Bank Museum presented two exhibitions with accompanying catalogues.\"An Intelligent Skyline.\" Today's Zaman. May 25, 2008. Along with the objects used in these exhibitions, OBARC made available to researchers materials relating to Sedad Hakk\u0131 Eldem from the Rahmi M. Ko\u00e7 Archive.\"Ottoman Bank Archives and Research Centre: Sedad Hakki Eldem Archive\" The Sadberk Han\u0131m Museum manages the Sedad Hakk\u0131 Eldem collection. Library OBARC housed a specialized library, which remains open to the public under the umbrella of SALT. Its collection includes 16,000 monographs and 1,200 titles of serials in major European and Middle Eastern languages. Operating parallel to the archive, the library's collection focuses on the economic, political, social and urban history of the Republic and the Ottoman Empire, beginning in the Tanzimat era. It also includes titles on the history of institutions in Turkey and Europe, collected through the European Association for Banking and Financial History network. ==Publications== Representations of Lifestyles in Turkey, 2006. From 1997 to 2010, OBARC published several volumes making the results of its research available to the public. These publications related to exhibitions, lectures, and specific projects, and include the works submitted to OBARC within the framework of the Prize Competition for Research on the History of Banking and Finance, which was jointly organized by OBARC, the European Association for Banking and Financial History and the History Foundation of Turkey. == References == == External links == *Annuaire Oriental *Atat\u00fcrk Institute for Modern Turkish History *Consular General of Italy in Istanbul *The European Association for Banking and Financial History *Garanti Culture Inc. *The History Foundation *Ottoman Bank Archives and Research Centre *Ottoman Bank Museum *Rahmi M Ko\u00e7 Museum *Sadberk Han\u0131m Museum *SALT Category:Libraries in Turkey Category:Historiography of the Ottoman Empire Category:1997 establishments in Turkey Category:Historiography of Turkey ",
