    "text": "State Highway 57 (SH 57) is an extremely short, half-mile-long state highway in Kit Carson County in the Eastern Plains of Colorado. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 70 (I-70) and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 24 (US 24) in Stratton. As of 2008, approximately 1600 cars used the route daily. ==Route description== The route begins at Interstate 70 just outside Stratton with a diamond interchange and then heads northward. It enters the Stratton city limits about after the Interstate 70 interchange. It then intersects Seventh Street, Sixth Street, and Fifth Street, in that order, ending at U.S. Highway 24 in Stratton. The route is entirely unmarked; there are no signs along its entire length designating the route as State Highway 57. However, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) still recognizes it as a state highway and maintains it as needed. ==History== The route was established in the 1920s. At the time of its establishment, the route was far longer than it is today: it began at U.S. Highway 36 near Kirk and continued to its current terminus at U.S. Highway 24. Another section was added to SH 57 north of U.S. Highway 24 in 1939. Most of the route was de-designated in 1954, leaving only around Stratton. This entire length was paved in 1956. The route was linked to Interstate 70 from U.S. Highway 24 in 1966 when the Interstate Highway System was built, and the stretch north of US 24 was removed from the numbered route in 1992, leaving the half-mile stretch seen today. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== 057 Category:Transportation in Kit Carson County, Colorado Category:State highways in the United States shorter than one mile ",
