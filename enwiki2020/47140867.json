    "text": "Radio Universidad is the radio service of the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY), broadcasting in M\u00e9rida and Tizim\u00edn. UADY owns three radio stations, each broadcasting the same programming: XERUY-AM 1120 and XHRUY-FM 103.9 in M\u00e9rida, and XHMIN-FM 94.5 in Tizim\u00edn. ==History== The UADY's first radio station began transmissions on April 6, 1966, on 1400 kHz. The station was founded by Hern\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez Coello, and the transmitter was built in M\u00e9rida by engineer Eduardo Maldonado. In the 1970s, new university administration began to upgrade Radio Universidad considerably. The studios were renovated, professional audio equipment added, and a new, 1 kW transmitter donated by the president of Mexico. The station also eventually moved to its current 1120 kHz frequency. The 1980s saw further growth in the station's programming, broadcasting 10 hours a day, and in April 1998, the university received a permit for XHRUY-FM. The permit for XHMIN in Tizim\u00edn was added in the 2000s; at the same time, the university also received a permit for a station to be located in Motul that was never built. ==External links== * * * ==References== Category:University radio stations in Mexico Category:Spanish-language radio stations Category:Radio stations in Yucat\u00e1n ",
