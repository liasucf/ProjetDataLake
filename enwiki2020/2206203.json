    "text": "Christopher Robert Broach (born September 5, 1976 in Madison, Wisconsin) is one of the guitarists/vocalists in the 1990s emo band Braid. Broach joined Braid in 1994, recording his guitar parts on the band's first 7-inch release a week later. ==Career== While a member of Braid, Broach also played in The Firebird Suite, and continued playing in what became The Firebird Band after Braid split up. He played guitar for Life at Sea on the album Is there a signal coming through?, and fronted the band L'Spaerow which put out one album on his own label, Lucid Records, which he founded in 2002. Broach, along with Chris Common of These Arms Are Snakes and former Hey Mercedes guitarist Mike Schumaker, were involved in a project entitled The Blakhiv. They released their first EP on Lucid Records in 2006. In 2015, Broach raised $15,000 in a Kickstarter campaign to record a new Firebird album. The funds covered recording, mixing, producing, and mastering the record, which was produced by Will Yip. Broach and Steve Znavor streamed the new record at Billboard Magazine under the name Sunset, but changed the name to SNST just prior to the digital release on April 28, 2017. ==Discography== === Albums === * SacHead \u2013 Our World (Playing Field Recordings, 1993) Cassette Only * Braid \u2013 Frankie Welfare Boy Age Five (Divot Records, 1995) \u2013 CD/Double LP * Braid \u2013 The Age of Octeen (Mud Records, 1996) \u2013 CD/LP * Braid \u2013 Frame & Canvas (Polyvinyl, 1998) \u2013 CD/LP * Braid \u2013 Lucky To Be Alive (Glue Factory Records, 2000) \u2013 live CD/Double LP * Braid \u2013 Movie Music Vol. 1, (Polyvinyl, 2000) \u2013 compilation CD/Double LP * Braid \u2013 Movie Music Vol. 2, (Polyvinyl, 2000) \u2013 compilation CD/Double LP * The Firebird Band \u2013 The Setting Sun and Its Satellites \u2013 (The Mintaka Conspiracy/Cargo Music/Headhunter, 2000) \u2013 CD/LP * L' Spaerow \u2013 L'Spaerow CD \u2013 (Lucid Records, 2003) \u2013 CD * The Firebird Band \u2013 The Firebird Suite - Archives \u2013 (Lucid Records, 2003) CD * Life at Sea \u2013 Is There A Signal Coming Through? \u2013 (Lucid Records, 2003) \u2013 CD * The Firebird Band \u2013 The City at Night \u2013 (Bifocal Media/Lucid Records, 2004) CD * Braid \u2013 No Coast, (Topshelf Records, 2014) \u2013 CD/LP * SNST - \"Turn Out the Lights\", (Rhyme & Reason Records (RARR), 2017) - LP https://snstmusic.bandcamp.com/album/turn-out-the-lights-2 * Chris Broach \u2013 \"Lost Years: Volume 11\" \u2013 (City at Night Records, 2018) \u2013 digital LP ===Singles and EPs=== * Braid \u2013 \"Rainsnowmatch\" 7\" (Enclave /Polyvinyl, 1994) \u2013 single * Braid \u2013 \"I'm Afraid of Everything\"/\"Radish White Icicle\"/\"Now I'm Exhausted\" 7\" (Grand Theft Autumn, 1995) \u2013 single * Braid \u2013 \"Niagara\"/\"That Car Came Out of Nowhere\" 7\" (\"Grand Theft Autumn\", 1995) \u2013 single * Braid / \"Corm Split\" 7\" (Polyvinyl, 1997) \u2013 single * Braid \u2013 \"First Day Back\"/\"Hugs From Boys\" 7\" (Polyvinyl, 1998) \u2013 single * \"Always Something There To Remind Me\" (Split 7\" w/ Burning Airlines) \u2013 (DeSoto Records, 1998) single * The Firebird Suite \u2013 \"New York\" 7\" \u2013 (The Mintaka Conspiracy, 1998) \u2013 single * The Firebird Project \u2013 \"Feel Alright CD\" \u2013 (The Mintaka Conspiracy, 1999) \u2013 EP * Braid \u2013 \"Please Driver Faster\", (Polyvinyl, 1999) \u2013 single * The Firebird Band \u2013 \"The Drive\" \u2013 (Cargo/Headhunter, 2001) \u2013 EP * The Blakhiv \u2013 \"Any Way She Wants It\" \u2013 (Lucid Records, 2006) \u2013 EP * Chris Broach \u2013 \"Beautiful Spaces\" \u2013 (City at Night Records, 2010) \u2013 digital single * Chris Broach \u2013 \"How Well You Know Me\" \u2013 (City at Night Records, 2010) \u2013 digital single * The Firebird Band \u2013 \"Say Hello\" \u2013 (Mind Over Matter Records, 2010) \u2013 Seven Inch EP * The Firebird band \u2013 \"Say Hello\" \u2013 (City at Night Records, 2010) \u2013 digital EP * Chris Broach \u2013 \"Madison\" \u2013 (City at Night Records, 2010) \u2013 digital EP * Chris Broach \u2013 \"Break It Up\" \u2013 (City at Night Records, 2018) \u2013 digital single ===Compilations=== * Campanula Blue \u2013 \"I Love Kerrazo\" \u2013 guest vocals (Core For Care, 1996) * Braid \u2013 \"Trompe Le Monde\" from Where Is My Mind?
