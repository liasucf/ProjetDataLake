    "text": "Much 911 is a reality-style television program that aired on Canadian music station MuchMusic. The program concept was that four music VJs (Matte Babel, Leah Miller, Devon Soltendieck and Sarah Taylor) would make sure a contestant's wildest dream comes true. The contestants each sent (or a friend will secretly sent) videotaped requests of various desires to MuchMusic headquarters. Common requests include pop music stardom, personal makeovers, changes in their social life, a show business career, or meeting a favourite celebrity. When a contestant was selected, one of the VJs would surprise the selected contestant in daily life and took them away for the day for a series of surprise planned events each inevitably leading to making their desire come true. == External links == *Much 911 Homepage Category:Much (TV channel) original programming ",
