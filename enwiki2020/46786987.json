Progress was slow due to French reluctance to dilute their competitive position and then overtaken by news in late 1908 of the proposed National Bank of Turkey (NBT) which, according to the Foreign Office was \"not initiated or suggested by us, and is carried out independently of us\". Cassel, who was to have been involved in the Ottoman Society, also turned out to be involved with NBT, later bringing in Henderson and then Revelstoke. The Foreign office was kept informed at all stages and Sir Edward Grey later in 1909 played a part in securing the services of Sir Henry Babbington Smith as President of NBT, later saying in a memorandum of an interview with a member of the London Committee of the Ottoman Bank: > \"... we had no interest in Sir Ernest Cassel's Bank.The Turks had taken the > initiative and had arranged the matter independently with Sir Ernest > Cassel... I had certainly supported the scheme to the extent of encouraging > Sir Henry Babington Smith to accept Sir Ernest Cassel's offer. The selection > had been made by Sir Ernest Cassel himself.\" and when asked whether the Foreign Office intended to give exclusive support to Cassel's Bank in obtaining concessions at Constantinople, Grey replied: > \"..that if need be, we should certainly represent to the Turks that an > institution which had been brought into existence as a direct result of > their own initiative and representations ought not to be excluded from > concessions. But when occasion arose for me to support the Bank's claims I > should do what I could to encourage co-operation with French finance.\" ===Founding=== Conlin, citing a letter of 7 December 1908, that included an NBT prospectus, from Frederick Lane (shipping broker, Rothschilds\u2019 agent and Gulbenkian associateMarian Kent 1976 Oil & Empire:British Policy and Mesopotamian Oil 1900-1920 Macmillan Press ) to Hugo Loudon of Royal Dutch Shell says that the Young Turks had asked Boghos Nubar Pasha and Calouste Gulbenkian to form NBT. ===Early Operations=== ===Mesopotamian Oil=== In the early 1900s Deutsche Bank, through the Anatolian Railway Company had mineral and oil exploration rights in a 20 km strip either side of the proposed route from Konia to the Persian Gulf. William D\u2019Arcy, who had the Persian oil concession since 1901, also sought a concession in Mesopotamia and by 1907, were in the running due to the German side having been lax in procedure. The same year, Royal Dutch Shell (RDS) opened a Constantinople office, run by Gulbenkian. In 1908, following the Young Turk revolution, everybody had to start over. In 1908, D'Arcy incorporated as D'Arcy Exploration Co. and transferred all his oil claims in Mesopotamia and Persia to Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC). More interested parties and more schemes appeared on the scene, though by 1912, nothing had really changed. During 1912, Gulbenkian was setting the foundation for a new scheme, the Turkish Petroleum Company, owned as to 50% by NBT (inclusive 15% nonvoting beneficial to Gulbenkian), 25% RDS and 25% Deutsche Bank (in consideration of their oil claims). On 19 March 1914, the British and German governments signed an agreement whereby the interest of NBT in TPC was transferred to APOC.Earle, Edward Meade (1924) The Turkish Petroleum Company:A Study in Oleaginous Diplomacy, Political Science Quarterly, vol 39, no.2,pp.265-279 ===Later Developments=== ==See also== ==Notes== ==References== Category:1909 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:1931 disestablishments in Turkey Category:Banks established in 1909 Bank Category:Defunct banks of Turkey Category:Banks disestablished in 1931 ",
