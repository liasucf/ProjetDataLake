    "text": "The B-series trains are a class of electric multiple unit built by Downer Rail, Maryborough for Transperth between 2004 and 2019. ==History== Perth's first electrified trains, the two-carriage A-Series, entered service in September 1991. The new three-carriage B-series were introduced on 4 October 2004 as part of the New MetroRail project. Thirty-one B-series sets were purchased to operate on the new Joondalup and Mandurah lines. They are mainly based at Nowergup depot but are occasionally stored at Claisebrook Depot. The B-series trains are cleared to operate on the Midland, Armadale/Thornlie and Fremantle lines and are regularly used on these lines alongside the older A-Series. However, not all stations on these lines are capable of handling six-car sets as the platforms are not long enough, so they are usually run as 3-car sets. There are reported problems with the acceleration/deceleration systems with the closely spaced stations. Platforms at the original stations on the Joondalup line had to be lengthened to accommodate the six-car trains, as did Platform 1 at Showgrounds and both platforms at West Leederville. The Mandurah line stations, along with Butler, Clarkson, Currambine and Greenwood on the Joondalup line, and the rebuilt Kelmscott station on the Armadale line were built with longer platforms. ==Additional sets== In 2006, the Public Transport Authority ordered a second batch of 15 three-carriage B-series trains from Bombardier/EDI Rail to increase capacity on the Joondalup and Mandurah lines. The first entered service on 28 June 2009. These sets feature an upgraded communication system and brighter destination screens than the original B-series sets. Funding for a third batch of 15 sets was announced by the Government of Western Australia in the 2011/12 State Budget. The order was increased by two sets in August 2012 to service the planned Aubin Grove station, followed by a further five sets in November 2012.More new railcars for Perth Railway Express 14 November 2012Perth grapples with growth and funding challenges International Railway Journal 6 November 2013\"Rolling Stock contracts and deliveries\" Railway Digest December 2014 p. 47 Funding for an additional 10 sets was announced in the May 2016 state budget with delivery planned for 2018-20 these sets will provide additional capacity on the existing network as well as service the Forrestfield\u2013Airport Link when it opens in 2021. The B series fleet will total 78 3-carriage sets. As of April 2019 all 78 3-car sets have been delivered with 78 3-car sets in serviceMore EMUs for Perth Railway Gazette International 23 June 2016 ==Accidents== ===Accident at Nowergup Depot=== On 23 August 2006 at approximately 18:00, two B-series trains (sets BEA 053 and BEB 060) were involved in a head-on collision at Nowergup depot. Cars from both sets were damaged badly enough to be sent back to builders EDI's facility in Maryborough for repair. During these repairs, undamaged cars from both sets were re-formed into set 60, which then returned to service. The damaged cars were fixed and returned to service (as set 60) in time for the opening of the Mandurah line in December 2007. ==Additional accessories == Since early-2016, B-series sets 115 and onwards have been fitted with USB charging ports as part of a 6-month trial.https://thewest.com.au/news/australia/transperth-gives-power-to- commuters-ng-ya-137234 They are located below the emergency door release and aside from the intercarriage gangways. A free Wi-Fi trial was conducted in late 2018 to early 2019 on B-Series sets 105 and 111, as well as Perth Underground and Elizabeth Quay stations. Free Wi-Fi trials were also conducted on two high-traffic buses in the Perth CBD. ==See also== * Transperth A-series train * Transperth C-series train * Queensland Rail Suburban multiple unit * Queensland Rail Interurban multiple unit ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== Category:Electric multiple units of Western Australia Category:Public transport in Perth, Western Australia Category:Train-related introductions in 2004 ",
