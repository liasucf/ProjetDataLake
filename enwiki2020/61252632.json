A group of women (pro-Jane Ansah camp), led by Seodi White and Minister of Gender Mary Navicha argued that Ansah was a victim of sexism and gender discrimination. They staged a counter protests that were in solidarity of Jane Ansah and her role in the elections. Thousands of women marched in defense of her role in the elections, many wearing shirts written \"I am Jane Ansah\". ===Resignation=== On 21 May 2020, Ansah announced her resignation as chairperson of the Malawi Electoral Commission after two successive court rulings confirmed massive irregularities in the 2019 elections.

On 7 June 2020, President Mutharika appointed Justice Dr. Chifundo Kachale as the new MEC chairperson replacing Ansah. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1955 births Category:Malawian judges Category:Malawian lawyers Category:Malawian women lawyers Category:Attorneys-General of Malawi ",
