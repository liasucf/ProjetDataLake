    "text": "Dutilleux (left) with R\u00e9gis Campo in 2004 Henri Dutilleux (; 22 January 1916 \u2013 22 May 2013) was a French composer active mainly in the second half of the 20th century. His small body of published work, which garnered international acclaim, followed in the tradition of Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, Albert Roussel and Olivier Messiaen, but in an idiosyncratic style. Some of his notable compositions include a piano sonata, two symphonies, the cello concerto Tout un monde lointain\u2026 (A whole distant world), the violin concerto L'arbre des songes (The tree of dreams), the string quartet Ainsi la nuit (Thus the night) and a sonatine for flute and piano. Some of these are regarded as masterpieces of 20th-century classical music. Works were commissioned from him by such major artists as Charles Munch, George Szell, Mstislav Rostropovich, the Juilliard String Quartet, Isaac Stern, Paul Sacher, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Simon Rattle, Ren\u00e9e Fleming, and Seiji Ozawa. Writing in the New York Times, Paul Griffiths said: \"Mr Dutilleux\u2019s position in French music was proudly solitary. Between Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez in age, he was little affected by either, though he took an interest in their work. \u2026 But his voice, marked by sensuously handled harmony and color, was his own.\" Dutilleux was awarded several major prizes throughout his career, notably the Grand Prix de Rome (1938), International Music Council's International Rostrum of Composers (1955), the Grand-Croix de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur (2004), the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize (2005), the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society (2008) and the Marie-Jos\u00e9e Kravis Prize for New Music (2011). In addition to his activities as a composer, he worked as the Head of Music Production for Radio France for 18 years. He also taught at the \u00c9cole Normale de Musique de Paris, at the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur de Musique and was twice composer in residence at the Tanglewood music centre in Lenox and Stockbridge, Massachusetts. ==Life== Henri Dutilleux was born on 22 January 1916 in Angers, Maine-et-Loire. He was the great-grandson of the painter Constant Dutilleux and grandson of the composer Julien Koszul. He was also a cousin of the mathematician Jean-Louis Koszul. As a young man he studied harmony, counterpoint, and piano with Victor Gallois at the Douai Conservatory before leaving for the Conservatoire de Paris. There, between 1933 and 1938, he attended the classes of Jean and No\u00ebl Gallon (harmony and counterpoint, in which he won joint first prize with the cellist Paul Tortelier), Henri B\u00fcsser (composition) and Maurice Emmanuel (history of music). Dutilleux won the Prix de Rome in 1938 for his cantata L'anneau du roi but did not complete his entire residency in Rome due to the outbreak of World War II. He worked for a year as a medical orderly in the army and then returned to Paris in 1940, where he worked as a pianist, arranger and music teacher. In 1942, he conducted the choir of the Paris Opera. Dutilleux worked as Head of Music Production for Radio France from 1945 to 1963. He served as Professor of Composition at the \u00c9cole Normale de Musique de Paris from 1961 to 1970. He was appointed to the staff of the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur de Musique in 1970 and was composer-in-residence at Tanglewood in 1995 and 1998. His students included the French composers G\u00e9rard Grisey and Francis Bayer, the Canadian composers Alain Gagnon and Jacques H\u00e9tu, the British composer Kenneth Hesketh, and many others. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the 16th composer featured in the annual Komponistenportr\u00e4t of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2006. For many years, Dutilleux had a studio on \u00cele Saint-Louis, which was the heart of his existence. He died on 22 May 2013 in Paris, aged 97 and was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery, in the same grave as Genevi\u00e8ve, his wife who pre-deceased him in 2009. His tombstone is made from grey granite and bears the epitaph \"Compositeur\". ==Influences and style== Dutilleux's music extends the legacies of earlier French composers such as Debussy and Ravel but is also clearly influenced by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Igor Stravinsky. Among his favourite pieces, he mentioned Beethoven's late string quartets and Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande. His attitude toward serialism was more ambiguous. While he always paid attention to the developments of contemporary music and incorporated some serialist techniques into his own compositions,\"'Obsessionnel', the third movement of M\u00e9taboles, uses a note row. . . .\" (Potter 2001); Nichols and Dutilleux 1994, 87. he also criticized the more radical and intolerant aspects of the movement: \"What I reject is the dogma and the authoritarianism which manifested themselves in that period.\"Nichols and Dutilleux 1994, 87. As an independent composer, Dutilleux always refused to be associated with any school. Rather, his works merge the traditions of earlier composers and post- World War II innovations and translate them into his own idiosyncratic style. His music also contains distant echoes of jazz as can be heard in the plucked double bass strings at the very beginning of his First Symphony and his frequent use of syncopated rhythms. He often calls for the use of Ray Robinson-style cup mutes by the brass section, which seems to indicate the influence of big band music. Dutilleux was greatly enamoured of vocalists, especially the jazz singer Sarah Vaughan and the great French chanson singers. Some of Dutilleux's trademarks include very refined orchestral textures; complex rhythms; a preference for atonality and modality over tonality; the use of pedal points that serve as atonal pitch centers;\"This use of pivot chords (or pivot notes) is a constant of Dutilleux's mature style, and provides a point of reference for the listener within an essentially atonal context\" (Potter 2007, 53). and \"reverse variation,\" by which a theme is not exposed immediately but rather revealed gradually, appearing in its complete form only after a few partial, tentative expositions.Potter 2001, also quoted on Ensemble Sospeso website (5th paragraph). BBC Philharmonic website, \"Latest Concerts from the Manchester Student Music Network\" Saturday 25 November (undated) (accessed 19 June 2008). Swart ?2007. His music also displays a very strong sense of structure and symmetry. This is particularly obvious from an \"external\" point of view, in the overall organisation of the different movements or the spatial distribution of the various instruments, but is also apparent in the music itself (themes, harmonies and rhythms mirroring, complementing or opposing each other). According to Stuart Jefferies, \"A passage may be conceived as a symmetrical shape of notes on paper and only later given musical substance. He loves symmetrical musical figures such as palindromes or fan-shaped phrases...\"Jeffries 2005.\"Dutilleux pousse plus avant encore que Bart\u00f3k les sym\u00e9tries de tout type, r\u00e9trogrades (par exemple au d\u00e9but du quatuor Ainsi la nuit, 1974\u20131976) ou en miroir\" (Amblard 2007 ). Dutilleux's music was often influenced by art and literature, such as the works of Vincent van Gogh,\"A great lover of painting, Dutilleux claimed to have van Gogh's La nuit etoilee always in mind when writing Timbres, espace, mouvement, and later added the title of the painting as a subtitle to his work\" (Potter 2001 ) Charles Baudelaire\"Baudelaire's poetry inspired the cello concerto Tout un monde lointain...; all five movements feature a Baudelaire epigraph at the head of the score\" (Potter 2001 ). and Marcel Proust.\"It is especially the ideas of time and memory, more specifically involuntary memory that the internationally acclaimed French composer Henri Dutilleux finds attractive. Dutilleux often refers to Proust's influence on his music. Furthermore, they both believe in direct experience and communication as the essential function of the work of art\" (Swart and Spies 2007 ). It also shows a concern for the concepts of time and memory, both in its use of quotations (notably from B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Benjamin Britten, and Jehan Alain), and in short interludes that recall material used in earlier movements and/or introduce ideas that will be fully developed later. A perfectionist with a strong sense of artistic integrity, he allowed only a small number of his works to be published; what he did publish he often repeatedly revised. In his own words: ==Compositions== Dutilleux numbered as Op. 1 his Piano Sonata (1946\u20131948), written for the pianist Genevi\u00e8ve Joy, whom he had married in 1946. He renounced most of the works he composed before it because he did not believe them to be representative of his mature standards, considering many of them to be too derivative to have merit.The Living Composers Project: \"Henri Dutilleux\" (accessed 19 June 2008), paragraph 2. After the Piano Sonata, Dutilleux started working on his First Symphony (1951). It consists of four monothematic movements and has a perfectly symmetrical structure: music slowly emerges from silence (first movement\u2014a passacaglia) and builds towards a fast climax (second\u2014a scherzo and moto perpetuo), keeps its momentum (third\u2014\"a continuous melodic line that never goes back on itself\"), and finally slowly fades out (fourth\u2014a theme and variations). In 1953, Dutilleux wrote the music for the ballet Le loup (\"The Wolf\"). In his Second Symphony, titled Le double (1959), the orchestra is divided into two groups: a small one at the front with instruments taken from the various sections (brass, woodwind, strings and percussion) and a bigger one at the back consisting of the rest of the orchestra. Although this brings to mind the Baroque concerto grosso, the approach is different: in this piece, the smaller ensemble acts as a mirror or ghost of the bigger one, sometimes playing similar or complementary lines, sometimes contrasting ones.Seen and Heard International: Glyn Pursglove, \"Concert Review: Dutilleux, Bartok\", accessed 26 May 2013 His next work, M\u00e9taboles for orchestra (1965) explores the idea of metamorphosis, how a series of subtle and gradual changes can radically transform a structure. A different section of the orchestra dominates each of the first four movements before the fifth brings them all together for the finale. As a result, it can be considered as a concerto for orchestra. It quickly achieved celebrity and, following its premi\u00e8re by George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, was performed in several North American cities, then in France.CIRM \u2013 Centre National de Cr\u00e9ation Musicale, 2006 \"Les M\u00e9taboles furent command\u00e9es en 1959 par le chef George Szell \u00e0 Henri Dutilleux \u00e0 l'occasion du quaranti\u00e8me anniversaire de l'Orchestre de Cleveland, qui en assura la cr\u00e9ation le 14 janvier 1965 sous la direction du commanditaire. L'\u0153uvre connut rapidement la c\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9 et fut reprise dans les grandes villes nord-am\u00e9ricaines puis en France.\" M\u00e9taboles, accessed 26 May 2013 M\u00e9taboles is now one of his most often performed works. In the 1960s, Dutilleux met Mstislav Rostropovich, who commissioned him to write a cello concerto. Rostropovich premi\u00e8red the work, titled Tout un monde lointain\u2026 [A whole distant world], in 1970. It is one of the most important additions to the cello repertoire of the second half of the 20th century\"The great Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich commissioned Dutilleux to write Tout un monde lointain, now an important work in the cello repertoire.\" \"Tout un monde lointain... un des plus beaux concertos pour violoncelle de la seconde moiti\u00e9 du XXe si\u00e8cle qui... s'est trouv\u00e9 hiss\u00e9 au premier rang, celui des concertos de Chostakovitch, Penderecki, Britten...\" (Peters 2007 ). and is considered one of the composer's major achievements.\"In the meantime other cellists had Dutilleux's concerto in their repertoire and several other recordings are now available. Tout un monde lointain... is a splendid work and probably one of the composer's finest achievements\"(Culot 2008). After the cello concerto, Dutilleux turned to chamber music for the first time in more than 20 years and wrote the string quartet Ainsi la nuit (1976). It consists of seven movements, some of which are linked by short \"parentheses\". The function of these parentheses is to recall material that has already been heard and to introduce fragments that will be fully developed later.Simon Marin's liner notes (Erato CD 0630-14068-2) It is based on a hexachord (C-G-F-G-C-D) which highlights the intervals of fifth and major second. Each movement emphasizes various special effects (pizzicato, glissandi, harmonics, extreme registers, contrasting dynamics\u2026) resulting in a difficult and elaborate work. He also published various works for piano (3 Pr\u00e9ludes, Figures de r\u00e9sonances) and 3 strophes sur le nom de Sacher (1976\u20131982) for solo cello. The latter work was originally composed on the occasion of Paul Sacher's 70th birthday in 1976, on a request by the Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich to write compositions for cello solo using his name spelt out in musical notes as the theme eS-A-C-H-E-Re (Es is E in German, H is B in German, and Re is D in French; see Sacher hexachord). He then returned to orchestral works in 1978 with Timbres, espace, mouvement ou la nuit etoil\u00e9e, inspired by Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night. In this composition, Dutilleux attempted to translate into musical terms the opposition between emptiness and movement conveyed by the painting. The work employs a string section of only lower-register instruments: cellos and double basses, no violins or violas. In 1985, Isaac Stern premiered L'arbre des songes [The Tree of Dreams], a violin concerto that he had commissioned Dutilleux to write. Like its cello counterpart, it is an important addition to the instrument's 20th century repertoire. According to the composer, it is based on a process of continual growth and renewal (hence the title): \"All in all the piece grows somewhat like a tree, for the constant multiplication and renewal of its branches is the lyrical essence of the tree. This symbolic image, as well as the notion of a seasonal cycle, inspired my choice of 'L'arbre des songes' as the title of the piece.\" Dutilleux later wrote Myst\u00e8re de l'instant (for cymbalum, string orchestra and percussion, 1989), Les Citations (for oboe, harpsichord, double bass and percussion, 1991), The Shadows of Time (for orchestra and children voices, 1997), Slava's Fanfare (for Rostropovich's 70th birthday, 1997) and Sur le m\u00eame accord (for violin and orchestra, 2002 \u2013 dedicated to Anne-Sophie Mutter). In 2003, he completed Correspondances, a song-cycle for soprano and orchestra inspired by poems and letters by Prithwindra Mukherjee, Rainer Maria Rilke, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Vincent van Gogh. This work has received a very enthusiastic reception and has been programmed several times since its premi\u00e8re.\"Correspondances... Je suis heureux que cette \u0153uvre soit beaucoup jou\u00e9e en ce moment, vingt fois dans le monde!\" (Costantino 2006 ). His last major work was a song-cycle entitled Le temps l'horloge, written for American soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming. It consists of four pieces and an instrumental interlude on two poems by Jean Tardieu, one by Robert Desnos and one by Charles Baudelaire. The first three songs were premi\u00e8red at the Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto, Japan in September 2007. The American premi\u00e8re of this partial version took place in November 2007 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.Eichler 2007. Boston.com (30 November 2007). The complete work was unveiled on 7 May 2009 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Paris. In 2010, Dutilleux added a third movement to his chamber work Les citations. The expanded version was premiered at the Festival d\u2019Auvers-sur- Oise. In 2011, Pascal Gallois transcribed with Dutilleux's approval three of his early vocal works for bassoon and piano: Regards sur l'Infini (from the early cycle for voice and piano Quatre m\u00e9lodies) and Deux sonnets de Jean Cassou (originally for baritone and piano). He played them in a concert at the H\u00f4tel de Lauzun in presence of the composer. While Dutilleux allowed only a small number of his works to be published, he actually wrote a lot of music but kept only a small fraction of it.\"This modest output\u2014modest in quantity, though not in quality\u2014is nonetheless deceptive. His biographer Caroline Potter reports, 'Dutilleux has said that, contrary to what may be assumed by glancing at his catalogue, he actually writes a great deal, but uses only a small percentage of the material. (The Marie-Jos\u00e9e Kravis Prize for New Music at the New York Philharmonic 2011) Dutilleux talked several times about his projects and expressed the wish to write more chamber music,\"... je voudrais combler les lacunes de mon \u0153uvre ; ce que je n\u2019ai pas fait ou trop peu. Par exemple, j\u2019ai peu d\u2019oeuvres de musique de chambre\" (Costantino 2006 ). notably a second string quartet, a piece for clarinet and ensemble, one for solo double bass as well as some additional piano pr\u00e9ludes.\"Nor is the cycle meant as a swan song\u2014the composer has expressed interest in returning to the string quartet genre\" () He long considered composing an opera but abandoned that project because he could not find a libretto that appealed to him. Those who commissioned works from Dutilleux included Charles Munch (Symphony No. 2 Le double), George Szell (M\u00e9taboles), Mstislav Rostropovich (Tout un monde lointain\u2026 and Timbres, espace, mouvement), Isaac Stern (L'arbre des songes), Anne-Sophie Mutter (Sur le m\u00eame accord) and Seiji Ozawa (The Shadows of Time and Le temps l'horloge). ==Works== Dutilleux disowned many of the compositions he wrote before his Piano Sonata (1948).

Several major musicians and conductors championed Dutilleux's works notably Charles Munch, George Szell, Mstislav Rostropovich, the Juilliard String Quartet, Isaac Stern, Paul Sacher, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Simon Rattle, Renee Fleming and Seiji Ozawa. The conductor and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said of his music: \"His production is rather small but every note has been weighed with golden scales... It's just perfect \u2013 very haunting, very beautiful. There\u2019s some kind of sadness in his music which I find very touching and arresting.\" The critic Tom Service, writing for the BBC, said: \"Dutilleux's exquisite catalogue of pieces is becoming, rightly, ever more popular with performers and listeners all over the world\". An obituary in Gramophone commented that \"Dutilleux represented a generation of musicians with roots almost back into the 19th century; certainly his music can be seen in a direct line from that of his great predecessors Debussy and Ravel.\"Obituary: Henri Dutilleux \u2013 composer. gramophone.co.uk (22 January 1916). Roger Nichols, in an obituary in The Guardian, described him as \"the outstanding French composer between Messiaen and Boulez\", adding that he \"achieved a wholly individual synthesis of ear- catching colours and harmonies with formal rigour.\"Henri Dutilleux obituary | Music. The Guardian (22 January 1916). The Daily Telegraph said: \"Because Dutilleux was a perfectionist and self-critical to a fault, his output was small. He wrote barely a dozen major works in his career, destroyed much of his early music and often revised what he had written. His early work was clearly derivative of Ravel, Debussy and Roussel; but his later music, though influenced by Bartok and Stravinsky, was entirely original and often seemed\u2014in its scale\u2014more German than French.\" However, The Daily Telegraph\u2019s critic Philip Hensher described Dutilleux as \"the Laura Ashley of music; tasteful, unfaultable, but hardly ever daring ... Personally,\" Hensher admitted, \"I can\u2019t stick him.\" Rob Cowan, the BBC Radio 3 presenter and critic, recalled in June 2013 an interview with Dutilleux in which the composer had told Cowan that his personal favourite among his own works was Tout un monde lointain\u2026. ==Awards and prizes== *Grand Prix de Rome (for his cantata L'Anneau du Roi) \u2013 1938 *UNESCO's International Rostrum of Composers (for Symphony No. 1) \u2013 1955 *Grand Prix National de Musique (for his entire oeuvre) \u2013 1967 *Praemium Imperiale (Japan \u2013 for his entire oeuvre) \u2013 1994 *Prix MIDEM Classique de Cannes (for The Shadows of Time) \u2013 1999 *Grand-Croix de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur \u2013 2004 *Ernst von Siemens Music Prize (for his entire oeuvre) \u2013 2005 *Prix MIDEM Classique de Cannes (for his entire oeuvre) \u2013 2007 *Cardiff University Honorary Fellowship (for his entire oeuvre) \u2013 2008 *Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society \u2013 2008 *Marie-Jos\u00e9e Kravis Prize for New Music \u2013 2011 ==Honours== * : Commander of the Order of Saint-Charles (13 May 1998)Nomination by Sovereign Ordonnance n\u00b0 13454 of 13 May 1998 (French) * : Grand'Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur (31 Dec 2003) ==Notes== ==References== * Amblard, Jacques. 2007. \"Parcours de l'oeuvre de Henri Dutilleux (1916)\".
