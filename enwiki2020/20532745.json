    "text": "The Redwood Sap is the 36th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on October 1, 1951, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== Woody Woodpecker's pursuing his favorite pastime, writing a tome on \"Work and How to Avoid It,\" while all his friends of the forest work industriously to store food for the long winter ahead. He's warned by the other forest animals to store food, but he doesn't heed their warnings. With the first snow, the laugh's on Woody, who finds himself cold and starving during wintertime, a la \"The Grasshopper and the Ants.\" He nearly starves to death sponging food off animals. They pour on the ice, but Woody merrily thaws his way out. ==Notes== * There is no director's credit for this film. Lantz himself has claimed to have directed The Redwood Sap, but does not receive on- screen credit. * Some animation and sound effects came from earlier Woody films. The scene of Woody walking away from the screen at the tail end was recycled from Puny Express. Also the \"Starvation\" personification was recycled from Pantry Panic and Who's Cookin' Who?, and the audio of his spooky laugh was also recycled from Who's Cookin' Who? (as done by former storyman/voice actor Ben Hardaway). * Woody has no dialogue in this film, while the other animals \"dialogue\" was sped up and is almost unrecognizable. ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1951\".
