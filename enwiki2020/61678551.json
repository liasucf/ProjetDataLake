    "text": "Sapria myanmarensis is a rare and endemic holoparasitic flowering plant related to Rafflesia found in the Myanmar's northwestern part, in the Kachin State and Sagaing Region. The species was similar to S. himalayana, but was distinguished due to its basally-distributed, white-colored warts on the vermilion perigone lobes, shorter perigone tubes, flat central disk with greater disk crest diameter, and crateriform ramenta. ==Etymology== The specific epithet derives from Myanmar, the name of the country where it was discovered. ==References== Category:Flora of Myanmar Category:Parasitic plants Category:Rafflesiaceae ",
