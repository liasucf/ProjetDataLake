He made the breakthrough into senior football in 2015\u201316, initially as an unused substitute for a Primera Divisi\u00f3n draw away to Sud Am\u00e9rica on 21 November 2015. His professional debut arrived in the succeeding February, appearing for seventy-one minutes of a win on the road against Liverpool. A total of twenty- seven appearances came for Garc\u00eda in three seasons, prior to his departure on loan midway through 2017 to Tacuaremb\u00f3. Goals against Villa Teresa, Oriental, Cerrito and Central Espa\u00f1ol occurred in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. He went back to Juventud at the end of the year.

Ahead of the aforementioned campaign, in February 2019, Garc\u00eda was signed by top-flight club Boston River; though immediately returned to Juventud on loan. Two goals in fifteen games followed in four months. On 15 July 2019, Garc\u00eda completed a transfer to Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n side Estudiantes.
