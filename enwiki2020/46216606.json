It was not until he was nearly forty years old that he began to show his works which usually depict landscape or architectural subjects. He exhibited at the Salon from 1866 to 1892. He received a bronze medal at the Salon of 1880 for his painting The Seine at Saint-Dennis and his work L'Etang \u00e0 Mortefontaine, effet du matin (Morning Effect. Lake at Mortefontaine) was much praised at the Salon of 1881. His pictures show the influence of Corot and the other Barbizon masters. The Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts at Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre holds one of his works and two drawings are held by the Louvre. Among his chief pictures are: *Le moulin des Andelys *Le Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard aux Andelys *L'Etang \u00e0 Mortefontaine, effet du matin (1881) *Un coup de vent *Village au bord de l'eau *Vue des bords de l\u00b4Oise ==External links== * 3 works in French national collections * Biography on the Bordeaux Painters website ==References== * The Goupil Gallery of Photogravures from Great Modern Painters, Estes & Lauriat, Boston, USA, 1888 (pages 58-63) Category:1819 births Category:1893 deaths Category:French landscape painters Category:19th-century French painters Category:French male painters ",
