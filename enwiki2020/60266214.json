    "text": "Draft of the palatial complex planned in Lisbon by Filippo Juvarra for King John V of Portugal. The Project for the Royal Palace and Patriarchal Cathedral of Lisbon by Italian architect Filippo Juvarra was an ambitious proposal for a monumental complex located along the Tagus river in Lisbon, projected to house both a royal palace of King John V of Portugal and a new cathedral for the Patriarch of Lisbon. Juvarra planned the palace in 1719 for the modern-day Lapa neighborhood, though the works were never realized. == History == At the beginning of the reign of King D. Jo\u00e3o V there were several deliberations on the possible construction of a sumptuous Royal Palace and a Patriarchal Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Mary of Portugal. The project was inteded to create a symbol of the imperial power of the magnanimous monarch but also to celebrate the attribution of the position of Patriarch to the Archbishop of Lisbon Tom\u00e1s de Almeida (1670\u20131754) by the Papal Bull \u00abIn supremo apostolatus solio\u00bb by Pope Clement XI (December 7, 1716). The place of construction would be either in a riverside area west of the Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o, called \"Buenos Aires\", or in the Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o itself. The initial studies were commissioned by an Italian architect named Filippo Juvarra, who arrived in Lisbon in January 1719 and worked on the schemes until July of that year. During his stay he also made schemes for the creation of a monumental lighthouse on the Tejo river mouth. However, the choice of location by the architect (it would be in \"Buenos Aires\") and the size and architectural style of the building envisioned, inspired by Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, led to the Secretary of State of the King, D. Diogo de Mendon\u00e7a Corte-Real (1658\u20131736), to declare the project a show of megalomania. For this reason, D. Jo\u00e3o V decided to invest in a massive reconstruction of the Pa\u00e7os da Ribeira (Royal Ribeira Palace) in Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o, which did not survive the Lisbon Earthquake of 1755. ==See also== *Project for the Royal Palace in Campo de Ourique *Project of Filippo Juvarra for the Royal Palace of Madrid == References == Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in Portugal Category:Palaces in Lisbon Category:Royal residences in Portugal ",
