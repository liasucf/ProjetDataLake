Conceptually, McLennan's work tends to be unambiguous and antagonistic from a left-wing perspective, loosely following the traditions of agitprop, anti-art and Institutional Critique, incorporating elements of d\u00e9tournement, readymade or installation. His works have often been characterised as controversial by conservative politicians, journalists and art critics, usually portraying the artist in a negative light.\"The politics of art\" The Age, 14 May 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008 Alternatively, various liberal lawyers, academics and activists have defended his works, usually on the basis of free speech, due to the offence sometimes caused by his art for its often overt left-leaning bias.\"25 Years: NAVA at the forefront of Australia\u2019s cultural policy agenda\" NAVA Quarterly.

Group 4 run immigration detention centres in Australia, such as Baxter Detention Centre and the now closed Woomera Detention Centre. The security guard was reportedly humiliated due to the incident which occurred at a time of high criticism of the John Howard government's treatment of asylum seekers.\"VCA artwork raises ethics concerns\" The Age, 4 September 2003. Accessed 27 April 2008 === 24seven === In May 2004, McLennan produced Fifty- six, an exhibition designed to coincide with Nakba Day, the title drawing on the number of years since the establishment of Israel. The public exhibition in the shop front window space of 24seven Gallery on one of Melbourne CBD's busy streets, was censored by the City of Melbourne days after it was installed. The installation consisted of a large wall painting of an Israeli flag, with \"debatable\" statistics on the gallery's window about Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The scandal made international news, many pro- Israel individuals and groups accusing McLennan of antisemitism. This put a number of Victorian political figures such as former Premier Steve Bracks, Lord Mayor John So and former City of Melbourne councillor Kimberly Kitching under pressure to respond. The use of taxpayer's money to fund the space fuelled a lot of the debate.\"Making Space \u2013 spanking the hand that feeds it\" Art Right Now, 16 June 2007. Accessed 22 May 2009 McLennan also deeply outraged some critics by insinuating that the Nazis had a similar position on what they termed degenerate art. McLennan maintains a strong criticism of Israeli policies. === Citylights === In August 2004, McLennan displayed State Sponsored, a collection of portraits of Hamas militants, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi and the dates they were assassinated. The work was exhibited at Citylights project \u2013 a public art space in a Melbourne CBD lane way. McLennan was accused of glorifying terrorism by Ted Lapkin, a senior policy analyst of the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council. Andrew Mac, Citylights' curator and director defended the work on the grounds of diversity of opinion stating the artist's use of \"state sponsored\" referred to state terrorism.\"Jewish group blasts 'offensive' artwork\" The Age, 10 December 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008 === Platform Artists Group === In September 2005, the City of Melbourne intervened to terminate McLennan's Canberra's 18 exhibition shortly before it was scheduled to be shown at the Platform artists group's Artist-run initiative (ARI), Platform 2. The exhibition was to include images of the then 18 Islamic organisations proscribed as terrorists by the Australian Government and the basis for their formation. City of Melbourne Deputy Mayor Gary Singer claimed the proper guidelines were not followed. Human rights campaigner and barrister Julian Burnside claimed the censorship was about governments testing how much Australians would tolerate such occurrences.\"War on terrorism is claiming victims on the walls of art galleries\" Sydney Morning Herald, 16 September 2005. Accessed 3 May 2008 McLennan accused City of Melbourne of political censorship and appeasing Zionists.\"City council bans 'terror artwork'\" The Age, 15 September 2005. Accessed 27 April 2008 Singer's areas of special interests ironically include civil liberties.\"Deputy Lord Mayor Gary Singer\" City of Melbourne, Accessed 3 May 2008 === Monash University === Monash University Art and Design Faculty in Melbourne withdrew McLennan's video Mind the Gap in October 2005, ironically made for the same exhibition Monash had agreed to show the censored Canberra's 18 work. The video contained graphic footage of the beheading of British contractor Kenneth Bigley by Tawhid and Jihad in 2004. The video criticised former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for his role in the Iraq war.\"Azlan McLennan\" un Magazine, Volume 7, 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008 The censorship is likely to have been motivated by the Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005, particularly the controversial return to the crime of sedition introduced by the Howard government some weeks later and passed into law the following month; a move highly unpopular amongst the arts sector.\"Artists 'at risk' under terror laws\" NineMSN, 8 November 2005. Accessed 29 April 2008 === Urban Art === City of Melbourne and acting Transport Minister Bob Cameron censored Pay Your Way in January 2006 while McLennan was in residency in Indonesia. The posters \u2013 part of the Urbanart ARI program \u2013 were displayed in public tram shelters and pulled down only hours later due to complaints. The works featured images of Jean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian man shot dead by London police and accused Muslim terrorist, Jack Thomas.\"Fare game! Shelters feel the brush of protest\" The Age, 10 January 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008 The works were characterised as racist and Islamophobic,\"My art is not racist\" Herald Sun, 12 January 2006. Accessed 24 May 2009 yet McLennan claimed the works were satirising the post 9-11 racism and Islamophobia perpetuated by pro-US governments. McLennan is also a Muslim himself.\"Political art meets a paranoid state\" Socialist Alternative, Edition 99, February 2006. Accessed 25 April 2008 Thomas' lawyer, Rob Stary attacked the work for jeopardising the trial\"Public art threatens fair trial: Thomas lawyer\" The Age, 12 January 2006. Accessed 24 May 2009 yet weeks later would defend McLennan publicly against the Footscray police.\"Defiant artist flies his 'UnAustralian' flag again\" The Age, 1 March 2006. Accessed 24 May 2009 === Trocadero Art Space === Only weeks after the Pay Your Way affair, McLennan's Proudly UnAustralian was removed by the Victoria Police in Melbourne. The exhibition \u2013 featuring a burnt Australian flag \u2013 took place at Trocadero Art Space who rents a public billboard to exhibiting artists. It was to coincide with the 2006 Australia Day in January. The work was removed some days prior this date and McLennan arrived back in Australia days later to a media furore. The scandal had been criticised as offensive by those such as Federal Liberal Party MP Bronwyn Bishop who attempted to introduce a ban on flag burning, and the national president of the Returned and Services League. Free speech advocates such as the National Association for the Visual Arts and criminal defence lawyer Rob Stary denounced the police's actions as an attack on civil rights. This took place only a few short months after the 2005 Cronulla riots and fuelled the broader debate about racism in Australia.\"Art prompts call for flag-burning law change\" The 7.30 Report (Transcript), 6 February 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008 === Australian Centre for Contemporary Art === McLennan wrote an article in 2006 criticising the Artistic Director of the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (ACCA), Juliana Engberg over her reaction to artist and VCA student, Ash Keating and his appropriation of ACCA's waste disposal for the use of his art. The Engberg/Keating scandal became widely known amongst Melbourne art circles from the ACCA exhibition opening where it took place and later through the independent electronic magazine Crikey. McLennan's polemic further fuelled debate over Engberg's credentials.\"Power of one\" The Age, 1 September 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008 === Anna Schwartz Gallery === McLennan featured in Rules of Engagement at Melbourne ARI West Space in May 2007, which dealt with \"relationships, power and exchange within the art system\" according to the show's curator Mark Feary.\"Rules of Engagement\" West Space (Catalogue Essay), May 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008 McLennan's contribution, Art in a Capitalist Society depicted an authoritative picture of leading private Australian gallerist Anna Schwartz, linked to a quote about exploitation from the Karl Marx treatise Das Kapital. Schwartz has previously criticised McLennan and some have accused McLennan of taking revenge.\"Artists dish it out to the dealers\" The Age, 15 June 2007. Accessed 25 April 2008 === University of Melbourne === In a July 2009, Farrago interview, McLennan attacked the University of Melbourne over the merger with the Victorian College of the Arts, the Melbourne Model, the liquidation of the VCA Student Union and likened the Vice-chancellor, Glyn Davis' perceived political censorship to Adolf Hitler's use of Fascist Art and Joseph Stalin's use of Socialist Realism. He also depicted Davis and the Provost, Peter McPhee, as Sex Pistols musicians, Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious in a parody of the Never Mind the Bollocks album cover as well as depicting Davis as the violent psychopath, Alex DeLarge in Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange.\"Report on the death of the VCA\" Farrago, Edition 5, July 2009, p. 28\u201329. McLennan had previously attacked Davis and the university administration as the former General Secretary of the VCA Student Union.Smashing jobs, courses and student unions: A 2020 vision?
