    "text": "The Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (OBWC or BWC) provides medical and compensation benefits for work-related injuries, diseases and deaths. It was founded in 1912. With assets under management of more than $29 billion, it is the largest state-operated and second largest overall provider of workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the United States. BWC is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, and maintains 11 customer service offices throughout the state. BWC provides insurance to about two-thirds of Ohio's work force. BWC employs approximately 1,900 people. ==History== With the signing of the Ohio Workmen's Compensation Act on June 15, 1911, Ohio created a no-fault system that would allow compensation to workers in the event of a workplace accident, while also shielding employers from legal action brought by the worker. On March 1, 1912, the Ohio General Assembly created the State Insurance Fund and in 1913, made coverage by employers mandatory. On April 28, 1913, Lemuel C. Fridley became the first Ohioan to receive a workmen's compensation check under the new system.https://www.bwc.ohio.gov/videos/100%20Years%20Flash/100YearsFinal.swf looking back, THINKING FORWARD, Commemorating 100 years of workers' compensation in Ohio, published March 2011 The Ohio Safety Congress and Expo was created in 1930.

It was revealed in early 2005, in part by a Toledo, Ohio, newspaper The Blade that the OBWC had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in high risk or unconventional investment vehicles run by people closely connected to the Ohio Republican Party who had made large campaign contributions to many senior Republican party officials. Most notably, a rare coin investment fund has attracted particular scrutiny after it was reported that two coins worth more than $300,000 had been lost. Further investigation then revealed that coins worth $10\u2013$12 million were missing and that only $13 million of the original $50 million invested could be accounted for. Thomas Noe, a Republican Party fundraiser and activist was charged with running a criminal enterprise, the theft of $13 million from the fund, and of keeping a second set of books to cover for it. ===Private equity investments=== In the aftermath of the Coingate scandal, the OBWC determined to reduce its exposure to investments perceived as \"alternative\" or \"high risk\" which included an $400 million portfolio of over 60 private equity and venture capital investment funds. A sale of the portfolio was reported in 2007. However, as part of that sale process, OBWC engaged Ennis Knupp to conduct a thorough valuation of its alternative investment holdings. The Columbus Dispatch subsequently made a request under the Freedom of Information Act to receive the Ennis Knupp valuation report, which included confidential materials that the various private equity firms objected to OBWC disclosing. The various private equity firms settled a lawsuit with the Columbus Dispatch allowing a partial disclosure, however the generally secretive private equity industry followed the outcome closely.Ohio BWC to release investment info (Crain's Cleveland Business, 2005).MEMBER ALERT: OHIO AND CALIFORNIA FOIA ACTION(National Venture Capital Associatiation, 2006). ===Subsequent events=== In the years following the Coingate scandal, OBWC has replaced its senior management and investment teams and has been scrutinized heavily by the new Democratic administration in Ohio. On June 26, 2007, the OBWC was again in the news as a result of the theft of a laptop containing personal information for 439 injured workers.BWC data lost in laptop theft (Columbus Dispatch) On January 13, 2009, Ohio inspector general's office investigation reported that a high-paid employee had been spending most of his work hours, since 2005, downloading and viewing audio and video files from sexually explicit websites during working hours. The case was referred to prosecutors for possible charges involving theft of state time and the inspector general urged the BWC to monitor more closely its employees' computer use.State worker used hours in cubicle to surf porn sites Columbus Dispatch, January 16, 2009.Inspector General Report of Investigation, January 13, 2009. In January 2013, a plaintiff class of more than 270,000 Ohio businesses filed a report claiming it was due $860 million after the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation was found to have over-charged class members from 2001 to 2009. The report follows a decision from Judge Richard McMonagle of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas that the Ohio BWC violated two state statutes by charging the class excessive premiums. During the trial, the BWC conceded that the rates it charged non-group employers from 2001 to 2009 were excessive, according to case summary. BWC employees explained that those employers were charged a \"huge surcharge\" that resulted from a \"broken group rating system.\" Attorneys report BWC owes Ohio businesses $860 million for unlawful over-charges February 8, 2013. On March 20, 2013, Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Richard McMonagle ordered the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation to refund $860 million in illegal over-charges to some 270,000 employers.http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2013/03/20/workers- compensation-judge-large-award-to-ohio-employers.html In response to statements made by the Bureau's Administrator Steve Buehrer indicating a desire to appeal the decision, class members created a non-profit organization called Pay Us Back Ohio BWC, Inc.http://www.nbc4i.com/story/21894186/businesses-organizing-in-support-of- workers-comp-refundhttp://www.paynowbwc.com to organize the 270,000 employers against the Bureau of Workers' Compensation's costly appeal of the decision. Thirteen months after the BWC filed its appeal, Ohio's 8th Appellate District Court upheld the original Court's decision and blasted the state agencyhttp://www.cleveland.com/court- justice/index.ssf/2014/05/appellate_court_blasts_ohio_bu.html saying that, \"this appeal is about a cabal of Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) bureaucrats and lobbyists for group sponsors who rigged workers\u2019 compensation insurance premium rates so that for employers who participated in the BWC\u2019s group rating plan (\u201cgroup-rated employers\u201d), it was \u201cheads we win,\u201d and for employers who did not participate in the group rating plan (\"nongroup-rated employers\"), it was \"tails you lose.\"http://paynowbwc.com/appellatecourtdecision51514.pdf Just days before the decision, Ohio Governor John Kasich stated during a television interview that if the employers were owed money he would help them get it back.http://www.nbc4i.com/story/25478173/tuesday-at-6-pm-why-does-ohio-owe- businesses-1-billion In response, members of Pay Us Back Ohio BWC, Inc. called on the Governor to instruct the Bureau to comply with the court orders and give back the money it owes.\"http://www.paynowbwc.com/2014/05/immediate- release-appellate-court-upholds-court-ruling-against-bwc/ ==See also== *Government of Ohio ==References== *Noe got early start in rare coin business by Mike Wilkinson, Toledo Blade, April 3, 2005. *Special Report: Ohio Coin Funds, CoinLink. *Coingate:The GOP's Culture of Corruption *\"Coins of the Realm\", Alternet, June 29, 2005. *\"What's the Matter With Ohio?\", by Paul Krugman, New York Times, June 17, 2005. *Grand Jury Charge Noe with 53 Felony Counts by Mike Wilkinson and James Drew, Toledo Blade, February 13, 2006 *Chronology of Noe's Involvement (in Coingate), Toledo Blade, February 13, 2006 *Text of Noe's 53-count Indictment, February 13, 2006 ==External links== *Ohio BWC (official website) Category:Government of Ohio Category:Government agencies established in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in Ohio ",
