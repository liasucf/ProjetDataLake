    "text": "The Grand National Assembly of Turkey (T\u00fcrkiye B\u00fcy\u00fck Millet Meclisi) has 600 members, elected for a four-year term (five years before the 2007 referendum) by a system based on closed list proportional representation according to the D'Hondt method. To participate in the distribution of seats, a party must obtain at least 10% of the votes cast at the national level (the highest electoral threshold in any proportional system in the world) as well as a percentage of votes in the contested district according to a complex formula and votes for parties not seated are redistributed to the party that won the most votes. Independent candidates who receive more than 10% of the votes cast in a province are also seated and in the 2007 and 2011 elections members of the Democratic Society/Peace and Democracy Party evaded the threshold by running as independents and winning about 5% of the seats. The president was elected for a seven-year term by the parliament prior to the 2007 constitutional changes, and will be elected for at most two consecutive five- year terms in the future. Turkey has a multi-party system, with two or three strong parties and often a fourth party that is electorally successful. Since 1950, parliamentary politics has been dominated by conservative parties. Even the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) tends to identify itself with the \"tradition\" of Democrat Party (DP). The leftist parties, most notable of which is the Republican People's Party (CHP) draw much of their support from big cities, coastal regions, professional middle-class, civil service, military officers, and the religious minority of Alevi. The last general election was held in June 2018. == Schedule == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=8| Done. ! colspan=4| To come. |- ! !! 2014 !! 2015 !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 !! 2021 !! 2022 !! 2023 !! 2024 |- | Type | Local Presidential | General (June) General (Nov.) | None | Constitutional referendum | General (Parliamentary & Presidential) | Local | None | None | None | General (Parliamentary & Presidential) | Local |- |} * Bold: latest elections, italic: upcoming elections ==Presidential elections== * 2018 Turkish presidential election, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan re-elected * 2014 Turkish presidential election, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan succeeded Abdullah G\u00fcl * 2007 Turkish presidential election, Abdullah G\u00fcl succeeded Ahmet Necdet Sezer * 2000 Turkish presidential election, Ahmet Necdet Sezer succeeded S\u00fcleyman Demirel * 1993 Turkish presidential election, S\u00fcleyman Demirel succeeded Turgut \u00d6zal * 1989 Turkish presidential election, Turgut \u00d6zal succeeded Kenan Evren * 1982 Turkish constitutional referendum, Kenan Evren named president in new constitution until 1989 * 1980 Turkish presidential election, parties failed to elect a president to succeed Fahri Korut\u00fcrk, 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat ensued ==General (parliamentary) elections== The following sections give list of key results. ===List of elections=== Turkey used single house system before adopting the constitution of 1961.
