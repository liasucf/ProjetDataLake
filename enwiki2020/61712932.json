    "text": "Maria Creveling (February 2, 1995 \u2013 December 27, 2019), better known as Remilia, was an American professional League of Legends player. She was the first woman and transgender person to compete in the NA LCS, debuting in the 2016 Spring Split as the support for Renegades. However, she took a sudden hiatus from professional play a few weeks into her debut season due to on- stage pressure and online harassment. During her career she was particularly known for her mastery of the champion Thresh, which earned her the nicknames \"Madwife\" and \"Thresh Queen\". == Early life == Creveling was born and raised in Portland, Maine. Prior to League of Legends, she was an avid player of Age of Mythology and GunZ: The Duel. == Career == Creveling joined her first semi- professional League of Legends team in July 2013, when she was scouted and signed by Curse Academy. She initially adopted the in-game name Yuno and, after leaving Curse Academy, played as a support for several other teams attempting to qualify for the NA CS, the NA LCS' secondary league. In March 2015 she joined Misfits NA's inaugural roster and changed her in-game name to Remilia, after the Touhou Project character Remilia Scarlet. Creveling finally qualified for the NA CS on June 16, 2015, after she and her teammates defeated Magnetic at the 2015 NA CS Summer Qualifier. Misfits NA rebranded to Renegades shortly afterwards, and the team went on to defeat Team Coast in the 2015 NA CS Summer Finals, qualifying for the 2016 NA LCS Spring Split. Following Renegades' promotion, Creveling once again changed her in-game name, adopting the shortened alias of Remi. On January 16, 2016, she debuted as the NA LCS' first female player, as well as its first transgender player. However, she abruptly stepped down from the starting roster after playing a third of the season's games, citing on-stage pressure and online harassment. Two years later, she clarified her reasons for leaving in a series of tweets, revealing that a botched sex reassignment surgery had left her with severe and permanent nerve damage to her pelvic area, which caused her to suffer excruciating pain while playing onstage. After an eight-month hiatus from professional play, Creveling joined Latin American team Kaos Latin Gamers under the in-game name Sakuya, and played for the team from October 2016 to January 2017. Following her departure from Kaos Latin Gamers, she shifted her focus to streaming full- time, but also played for a few amateur teams in the United States before her sudden passing in late 2019. == Death == Creveling died in her sleep on December 27, 2019, at the age of 24. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Category:1995 births Category:2019 deaths Category:League of Legends support players Category:Renegades (esports) players Category:Team Dragon Knights players Category:American esports players Category:Women esports players Category:Transgender and transsexual sportspeople Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:LGBT people from Maine Category:LGBT esports players Category:LGBT sportspeople from the United States Category:Sportspeople from Portland, Maine ",
