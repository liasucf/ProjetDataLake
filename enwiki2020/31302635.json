Its members are: Mayu Sato (flute), Baptiste Gibier (oboe), Annelise Cl\u00e9ment (clarinet), Cyril Normand (french horn), and Frank Sibold (bassoon). Beside the traditional wind quintet repertoire (Ligeti, Hindemith, Fran\u00e7aix, etc.), ArteCombo plays its own arrangements (written by Frank Sibold) of pieces such as Gershwin\u2019s An American in Paris. Composer Jean-Philippe Calvin wrote the wind quintet \"Kleztet\" for Artecombo. ArteCombo also commissioned and performed the musical children story \"Caravane Gazelle\", composed by Olivier Calmel. ArteCombo won the second prize at the Henri Tomasi International Woodwind Quintet Competition in Marseille in 2011. Until now, ArteCombo has played mostly in France and Japan. ==Discography== * 2010: Caravane Gazelle, Hybrid'Music, with Julie Martigny (voc) * 2011: Carnet de route, Hybrid'Music ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Wind quintets Category:Musical groups established in 2007 ",
