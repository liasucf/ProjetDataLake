    "text": "Break the News is a 1938 British musical comedy film directed by Ren\u00e9 Clair and starring Jack Buchanan, Maurice Chevalier and June Knight. Two struggling performers decide to create a fake murder scandal in order to drum up publicity for their act. It was based on the novel Le mort en fuite by Lo\u00efc Le Gouriadec which had previously been made into a 1936 French film Death on the Run. Songs featured include It All Belongs to You (Cole Porter, sung by Chevalier) and We're Old Buddies (Van Phillips, Jack Buchanan, sung by Chevalier and Buchanan). ==Cast== * Maurice Chevalier - Fran\u00e7ois Verrier * Jack Buchanan - Teddy Enton * June Knight - Grace Gatwick * Marta Labarr - Sonia * Gertrude Musgrove - Helena * Garry Marsh - Producer * Wallace Douglas - Stage manager * Joss Ambler - Press agent * Mark Daly - Property man * Gibb McLaughlin - Superintendent * Robb Wilton - cab driver * Felix Aylmer - Sir George Bickory * C.

Break the News boasted the talents of English stage star Jack Buchanan, French entertainer Maurice Chevalier, legendary director Rene Clair, and songwriter Cole Porter. But what should have made for dynamite entertainment, fizzled in the eyes of disappointed contemporary reviewers\" ; as The New York Times put it, \"there is little to suggest the old Clair wit and humor.\"https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980CEFDB123DE33BBC4A53DFB766838A659EDE However, TV Guide wrote, \"the always enchanting Buchanan and Chevalier are a pleasure to watch in this funny, energetic musical that features some hilariously suspenseful sequences. Although it may not rank with director Clair's French classics, this perfect piece of British entertainment holds its own special place.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1938 films Category:1938 musical comedy films Category:British musical comedy films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Ren\u00e9 Clair Category:British black-and-white films Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:British remakes of French films Category:Films set in London Category:1938 comedy films ",
