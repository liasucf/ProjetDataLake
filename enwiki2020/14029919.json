Jorge Colberg as well as three prominent journalists, including attorney Magdalys Rodr\u00edguez, an El Nuevo D\u00eda consultant, as well as TV reporter and radio commentator Rafael Len\u00edn L\u00f3pez and radio journalist Maribel Hern\u00e1ndez.

He is collaborating with attorney and former journalist Magdalys Rodr\u00edguez on a book on the exercise of power at the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. He is currently drafting his thesis to complete his doctorate at Universidad Complutense in Madrid, Spain. After President Obama announced on December 17, 2014 the easing of relations with Cuba, Rodr\u00edguez was assigned as El Nuevo D\u00eda's special correspondent to Havana, where he spent over a week in late 2014 preparing special reports from the Cuban capital. ==References== Category:Puerto Rican journalists Category:Puerto Rican columnists Category:Puerto Rican educators Category:University of Puerto Rico alumni Category:Living people Category:1974 births ",
