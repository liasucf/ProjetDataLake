He played the role from the show's debut in July 1984 until July 1989. Davies was challenged by a complicated working relationship with co-star Nancy Lee Grahn. Constant conflict over the direction of their characters led to his departure in 1989. When he first left the show, he was quoted as saying, \"It's not that I'm looking for another kind of challenge as far as acting is concerned. I'm just ready for a rest more than a challenge. I've kind of challenged myself into an early grave.\" He took a six-month around-the-world tour and returned to the United States in February 1990. Davies never returned to the role of Mason Capwell. * In 1992, he filled in for Ronn Moss as Ridge Forrester on The Bold and the Beautiful as a temporary replacement while Moss was on leave. * Davies was cast as Dr. Cameron Lewis on General Hospital from 2002 to 2004. He again appeared opposite Grahn; the two resolved their problems and were friends, and she had joined General Hospital as lawyer Alexis Davis in 1996. However, Davies was never prominently featured during his time on the show, and his character was written out just a little over a year after he joined the show. * Davies played the role of MacKenzie Johnson on the web series The Bay from 2010 to 2012. He replaced fellow soap actor John Callahan. ==Film roles== His film roles include The Magic of Lassie with James Stewart, Stephanie Zimbalist, and Mickey Rooney; Body Double with Melanie Griffith; Impure Thoughts with Brad Dourif; and Funland with David L.
