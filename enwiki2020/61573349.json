The Washington Mystics won the team's first WNBA title in their 22 year franchise history. == Format == Following the WNBA regular season, the top eight teams in the overall league standings, without regard to conference alignment, qualified for the playoffs and were seeded from one to eight. Seedings were based strictly on regular-season record. The team with the best record received the #1 seed, the team with the next best record received the #2 seed, and so on. The top two seeds earned double byes (i.e., advanced directly to the semifinals), while the next two seeds received first- round byes. These seedings were used to create a bracket that determines the matchups throughout the playoffs. The first round of the playoffs consisted of two matchups based on the seedings (5-8 and 6-7). The two winners advanced to the second round with a matchup between the number three seed and the lower of the advancing seeds and another matchup between the number four seed and the other first round winner. The winners of the first two rounds advanced to the semifinals, where the lower-ranked seed of the winners faces the number one seed, with the other remaining team facing the number two seed. The first two rounds were single-elimination games played on the higher ranking seed's home court. The semifinals and WNBA Finals are best-of-five series played in a 2-2-1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage (better record) hosts games 1, 2, and 5 while their opponent hosts games 3 and 4. === Tiebreak procedures === # Better winning percentage among all head-to-head games involving tied teams. # Better winning percentage against all teams with .500 or better record at the end of the season. # Better point differential in games net result of total points scored less total points allowed head-to- head. # Better point differential net result of total points scored less total points allowed against all opponents. # Coin toss (or draw of lots, if at least three teams are still tied after the first four tiebreakers fail). == Playoff qualifying == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text- align:center\" |- !rowspan=2|Seed !!rowspan=2|Team !!rowspan=2|Record !!colspan=3|Clinched |- !Playoff berth !!
