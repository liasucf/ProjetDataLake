    "text": "A Kiss on the Nose is a short film first released in the United States on August 15, 2004 during the Rhode Island International Film Festival, written and directed by Laura Neri. It stars Azita Ghanizada, Gianfranco Russo, Elena Fabri, Maeva Cifuentes, Monica Cortes, Svilena Kidess, Pat Lach and Warren Sweeney. St. John's International Women's Film Festival: Obviously strongly autobiographical, A Kiss on the Nose evokes that awkward combination of love and rage we often feel about our dads. This powerful little drama captures the essence of those feelings quite brilliantly. Some have identified this entry as \"the best short\" they have ever seen. That sure tells you a lot.
