    "text": "John Brendan McNally (born 22 January 1935 in Dublin), known as Brendan McNally, was an Irish professional footballer. He first played football for a small local club, St. Finbarrs. As a schoolboy he was selected to play for Ireland against England in a schoolboy international, scoring one of Ireland's goals as they went down 3-2. He was a right back and began his professional career in the League of Ireland with Shelbourne F.C. in 1954 and then moved to Luton Town F.C. in 1956. There he stayed for 8 years, making 134 appearances and scoring three times. Luton were then a First Division team and in 1959 he was part of the Luton team that lost 2-1 to Nottingham Forest in the final of the F.A. Cup. One of the Forest scorers that day was Roy Dwight, who was later carried off after breaking his leg in a tackle with Brendan. Roy, who died in 2003, was the cousin of the singer/songwriter Sir Elton John. After a successful period in the First Division, Luton started to slip down the Football League, first into the Second Division and shortly before Brendan joined Cambridge City in 1963 they were relegated into the Third Division. Brendan later on played for Dunstable Town and managed non league Chesham United where he gave future England international Kerry Dixon his first start in senior football. He also played three times for the Republic of Ireland, winning his first cap in a 2-0 European Championship qualifier win over Czechoslovakia on 5 April 1959 in Dalymount Park . == References == == External links == * * Category:1935 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Republic of Ireland international footballers Category:Republic of Ireland B international footballers Category:Shelbourne F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Cambridge City F.C. players Category:Dunstable Town F.C. players Category:League of Ireland players Category:English Football League players Category:Chesham United F.C. managers Category:Republic of Ireland football managers Category:Association footballers not categorized by position ",
