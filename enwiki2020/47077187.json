He resides in Miami, Florida, USA. ==Biography== Emilio H\u00e9ctor Rodr\u00edguez was born in the colonial village of Sancti Sp\u00edritus, Cuba, in 1950. His family moved to La Habana in 1953. He started drawing and experimenting with oil paint and tempera at the age of 12. While a student at the Instituto Pre-Universitario de Marianao (Marianao Senior High School), he participated in several workshops sponsored by San Alejandro Arts Academy. Between 1969 and 1970 he worked under the guidance of Cuban painter Jes\u00fas Antonio Valdovino Diaz at a center for the visual arts run by Consejo Nacional de Cultura (National Council of Culture) located in El Vedado, La Habana. In 1971 he enrolled in the University of Havana to study Pure Mathematics, but after two years he changed the field to Computer Science, obtaining his degree in 1976. After graduation he worked as a software specialist. In 1978 he began signing his artwork as \u201cEmilio H\u00e9ctor\u201d. He left Cuba permanently in 1981 and spent one year living in Paris. He moved to Miami, Florida, in 1982, where he currently resides with his family. Upon arrival in Miami, he started working as a computer analyst/programmer. He began painting with acrylic guided by the Cuban painter Dominica Alc\u00e1ntara in 2005 at the \u201cLatin Quarter Cultural Center\u201d in Miami. Abstract painting became his last interest and passion. He has been painting abstracts since 2007. Emilio H\u00e9ctor has been participating in the workshops of renowned Cuban-American painters and professors Baruj Salinas and Yovani Bauta at Miami Dade College. His work can be found in private and public collections in Florida as well as in other states and countries of South America Europe and Asia. In 2010 Emilio H\u00e9ctor presented a group of abstract artists to commemorate a Century since the first abstract artwork by Wassily Kandisnsky. This presentation later continued to become the \u201c7 Plus One Art Project\u201d which has been presenting abstract art exhibitions in diverse institutions such as Miami Dade College, the Koubek Center, Saint Thomas University and the Miami Hispanic Cultural Arts Center. Actually, Emilio Hector conducts this project as its founder and artistic director. In 2014 Emilio H\u00e9ctor was invited to become a member of The Cuban American Phototheque Foundation in recognition of his work in the field of photography. ==Exhibitions== ===Individual exhibitions=== He has presented several solo exhibitions including one in 2015, at Ave Maria University in Ave Maria, Florida, and two in 2014, one at the Miami Dade College-West Gallery and other at Rev.
