The area is a busy commercial center, with heavy traffic on nearby boulevards partly due to the two major freeways nearby. Directly to the west (across Centinela) is the proposed site of the Expo Vehicle Maintenance Facility. The elevated station structure stands 30 feet above Bundy Drive. To the east, the track descends a retained fill embankment before crossing Barrington Avenue. To the west, the track descends a retained fill embankment after crossing Centinela Avenue. Parking is located at-grade in the right-of- way near the station. ==Bus connections== * Santa Monica Big Blue Bus: 5, 7, Rapid 7, 14, 15 ==References== * Curbed Staff (November 24, 2014) \"Expo Line Extension is 80 Percent Done; See the New Stations\" Curbed Los Angeles Retrieved on December 2, 2016. ==External links== *Metro Expo Line Construction Authority *Project Website, Metro Rail Expo Corridor, Phase 2 to Culver City *Expo Line Phase-2 Photo Gallery Category:Los Angeles Metro Rail stations Category:E Line (Los Angeles Metro) Category:West Los Angeles Category:Railway stations in Los Angeles Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in California ",
