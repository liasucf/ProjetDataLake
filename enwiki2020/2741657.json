    "text": "Larix lyallii, the subalpine larch, or simply alpine larch, is a deciduous, coniferous tree native to northwestern North America. It lives at high altitudes\u2014\u2014in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho, Montana, British Columbia, and Alberta. There is a disjunct population in the Cascade Range of Washington. Subalpine larch is hardy and can survive at low temperatures and on thin rocky soils; the tree is often found near treeline. However, it can grow in a variety of soils and with or without shade, as long as the soil is moist but well-drained. ==Description== Fall foliage and cone Larix lyallii is a small tree, growing from tall and shorter at higher elevations. It has a straight trunk with a sparse and somewhat conical crown. The branches are horizontal to the trunk, irregularly spaced and twisted. The twigs are finely hairy. The needles are four-angled, long and crowded in groups of 30 to 40 on short spurs. They are pale blue-green and deciduous, turning golden yellow in autumn. The seed cones, long, are red-purple when young but become dark brown with age. They have thin scales and narrow bracts that extend over the scales. The bark is thin and turns from yellow-gray to dark red-brown with age. It also becomes deeply furrowed into small, scaly plates. The tree is also one of the longest lived tree species. There is record of a specimen in Kananaskis, Alberta which has been estimated (extrapolated) to be ~2000 years old, the oldest tree in Canada. ==Uses== The bark contains tannin and the wood is strong, heavy, and durable. ==References== ==External links== * Gymnosperm Database: Larix lyallii * Virginia Tech Dendrology: Larix lyallii * Treelib.ca: Larix lyalii lyallii Category:Least concern flora of the United States Category:Trees of Alberta Category:Trees of British Columbia Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States Category:Flora of the Rocky Mountains Category:Deciduous conifers Category:Trees of North America Category:Trees of the United States Category:Trees of Canada Category:Trees of Western Canada ",
