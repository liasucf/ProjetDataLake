ISSN 0177-0357. == History == The group was a successor to the short-lived Nationale Sammlung, itself set up following K\u00fchnen's removal from the Free German Workers' Party due to his homosexuality.Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 231 It was constituted as a legal political arm of the Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front (GdNF), K\u00fchnen's more militant neo-nazi organization.Hajo Funke, 'David Irving, Holocaust Denial, and his Connections to Right Wing Extremists and Neo-National Socialism (Neo-Nazism) in Germany' After its founding, it received members from the GdNF, Republicans and the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD). The complete leadership of the NPD in Berlin and Brandenburg defected to the DA in 1991.Profil: Deutsche Alternative (DA). apabiz.de. Retrieved on August 21, 2007. The group organized under the name Nationale Alternative (National Alternative) in the former East Germany, with Ingo Hasselbach as leader. This guise of the DA organized militia training camps in East Berlin and established close links with other groups and with international figures such as Gary Lauck. However, after around a year of intense activity, this arm of the DA fell apart. After K\u00fchnen's AIDS-related death in 1991, Frank H\u00fcbner became the organization's new chairman, while Rene Koswig assumed the role as deputy. Both hail from East Germany. This led about eighty members, primarily from the western part of the country leaving the DA to start the Deutsches Hessen, Nationaler Block, Volkstreue Liste, and Deutscher Weg. The group was banned in 1992 as were the Nationalist Front and National OffensiveC. T. Husbands, 'Militant Neo-Nazism in Germany', L. Cheles, R. Ferguson & M.
