Later, in 2003, she moved to Channel 22. In 2006, Raul Alarcon, owner of Spanish Broadcasting System (SBS), purchased channel 22, and the channel is now known as Mega TV.

Ros-Lehtinen said that her district was \"totally winnable for the right candidate\" from the Republican Party, adding that Salazar \"could be the right candidate.\"Daugherty, Alex; Republicans can't generate buzz for Ros-Lehtinen's seat, and some say it's unwinnable; Miami Herald; January 2, 2018; In March 2018, Salazar announced her candidacy to represent the district, which includes Miami Beach, most of Miami, Kendall, and parts of coastal south Dade County. This traditionally Republican district, that includes wealthy communities like Miami Beach, Key Biscayne and Coral Gables as well as Little Havana in Miami, has been trending Democratic in recent years. Salazar's Republican primary opponent, Bruno Barreiro, criticized her for her 1995 interview with Fidel Castro, in which she referred to the Cuban dictator as a \"comandante\", as well as 2016 appearance on Fox News where she described Barack Obama's rapprochement with Cuba as \"noble.\" Salazar called Barreiro's attack advertising \"defamatory,\" and said that \"I have been one of the staunchest, most hardest critics of the Cuban Revolution on the air.\" On August 28, 2018, Salazar won the Republican primary by a margin of about 15 points over her leading competitor, Bruno Barreiro. Former Clinton cabinet member Donna Shalala won the Democratic nomination for the seat. The only debates held during the general election were conducted in Spanish. Shalala does not speak Spanish and used an interpreter, giving Salazar an advantage. Each of the candidates declined opportunities to debate the other in English due to scheduling conflicts. Although Hillary Clinton had won the district by almost 20 points in 2016 \u2013 Clinton's best showing in a Republican-held district \u2013 polling as late as a month out from Election Day showed Salazar either narrowly ahead or statistically tied with Shalala. Salazar lost the general election to Shalala, who won nearly 52 percent of the vote. === 2020 congressional election === In August 2019, Salazar announced her candidacy to run in a rematch against Shalala.https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami- dade/article233385717.html She won the Republican primary in August 2020 and will face Shalala in the November general election. === Political views === She joined Senator Marco Rubio in suggesting that birthright citizenship should be \"reviewed,\" citing abuse of the law by foreign visitors to South Florida. Salazar publicly supported a carbon tax proposal by Rep. Carlos Curbelo, which many other Republicans rejected. One of Salazar's campaign commercials vowed to fight for environmental protection in Congress. On healthcare, Salazar said that she would only support repeal of the Affordable Care Act if a viable alternative were presented. She opposed repeal of the ACA's mandate that health insurers cover pre-existing conditions, but called for \"free market\" policies on health insurance. Portraying herself as a moderate Republican, Salazar said she wants to do \"whatever makes sense to the community\"; of President Donald Trump, Salazar said: \"The president has used pretty insensitive words. I will talk to him in a nice, respectful way, because I do respect the institution of the presidency.\" Salazar said that she might back an assault weapons ban and citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. She supports universal background checks. Salazar criticized President Barack Obama's policy of engagement with Cuba, saying that she would support lifting the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba once there is democracy in the country. She has heavily criticized Bernie Sanders for \"his honeymoon in the Soviet Union\" and \"his praise for Nicaragua's and Cuba's socialist regimes\". ==Honors and awards== She is the recipient of five Emmy Awards for several reports on Nicaragua, Cuba and Santo Domingo. ==Books== In 2010, Grijalbo (a branch name of Random House), published her book Si Dios contigo, \u00bfQui\u00e9n contra ti ?, considered a sales success in the main US Hispanic states (). ==References== ==External links== * Campaign website * CiberCuba Biographical Info Category:1961 births Category:20th-century American journalists Category:21st-century American journalists Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:American anti-communists Category:American politicians of Cuban descent Category:American television journalists Category:American women in business Category:American women television journalists Category:Candidates in the 2018 United States elections Category:Florida Republicans Category:Hispanic and Latino American people in television Category:Hispanic and Latino American women in politics Category:John F.
