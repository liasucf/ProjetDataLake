It originally encompassed the area bounded by Kenny Road on the east, Dierker Road on the west, Bethel Road on the north, and Old Henderson Road on the south. Over the years, the NWCA area was expanded to the boundaries of the Olentangy River on the east, the Scioto River on the west, State Route 161 on the north, and the border of Upper Arlington/Highland Drive on the south. Northwest Columbus now includes some parts of Perry and Sharon Townships, the City of Dublin, and the City of Worthington. In 2007, the boundaries were changed to include only property that is in the City of Columbus. This area used to be mainly agricultural farm lands but, since the development of the automobile and the improvement of highways, these lands have increased greatly in value, being priced now at many times what they were before, which has made them in great demand for the development of suburbs. The area has now been reborn into an area with housing developments, commercial and entertainment sites, schools, and medical facilities. ==Neighborhoods== ===Sharon Township=== In 1796, the area now known as Sharon Township was part of the U.S. Military District.
