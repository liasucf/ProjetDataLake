It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to sixty small, green and white scented flowers well-spaced along the flowering stem. It usually grows in swampy places, flowers more prolifically after summer fires and sometimes forms very large colonies. == Description == Microtis brownii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between five and fifty green to yellowish-green and white flowers are well-spaced along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are scented, about long and wide. The dorsal sepal is about long, wide and forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are about long with their tips rolled under. The petals are about long and held under the dorsal sepal or alongside it. The labellum is about long, wide with crinkled edges and bends down to almost touch the ovary. Flowering occurs from November to January but more prolifically after fire the previous summer. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis brownii was first formally described in 1871 by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach and the description was published in Beitrage zur Systematischen Pflanzenkunde. The specific epithet (brownii) honours the Scottish botanist Robert Brown. ==Distribution and habitat== The sweet mignonette orchid usually grows in swampy places but sometimes in woodland, forest or inland granite outcrops. It sometimes forms colonies of thousands of plants and is widespread and common, especially between Perth and Esperance. ==Conservation== Microtis brownii is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. == References == == External links == * Category:Prasophyllinae brownii Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1871 ",
