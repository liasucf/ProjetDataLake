Although some are registered as official student organizations with the University of Pittsburgh Student Government Board and thus receive some small funding from that body, they are all largely self- supported.

The 2005 season marked the first time the team qualified for the National Championship tournament. Since 2005, Pitt has qualified for the National Championship tournament (top 20 teams) for 15 consecutive seasons which has been highlighted in winning back-to-back National Championships in 2012 and 2013, and playing for another national title in 2018. In addition to winning the 2012 and 2013 National Titles, the team has won 3 College Easterns Championships (2006, 2012, and 2015), 15 consecutive Western Pennsylvania Conference titles (2005\u20132019), and 7 Ohio Valley Regional Titles (2011\u20132015, 2017 and 2018). The Callahan Award, which is presented annually to the most valuable collegiate player in the sport, was awarded Pitt players Trent Dillon in 2016 and Michael Ing in 2019. ===Women's lacrosse=== The Pitt women's lacrosse club team that plays in Division 1 of Women's Collegiate Lacrosse Associates (WCLA) as a member of the East division of the Women's Collegiate Lacrosse League (WCLL). The club was founded in 1992 and plays home games in the Pitt Sports Dome.

The series began in 1905 and ended on September 16, 2000 with a 12\u20130 Pitt Heinz Field victory, but with Penn State leading the series 50\u201342\u20134. Although the two teams ended play for years due to long-standing coaching and administrative feuding, the rivalry remained heated among some fans. A revival of the rivalry is scheduled to resume for a four-game series in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Pitt athletic officials have publicly supported an annual renewal of the rivalry; however, Penn State has publicly countered that it is financially restricted from agreeing to a long- term series on a home-and-home basis. On December 10, 2016, Pitt and Penn State resumed competition in men's and women's basketball, with a win in the men's game and loss in the women's game. They compete in other sports as well as in recruiting. ===West Virginia rivalry=== The 1908 edition of the Backyard Brawl at Exposition Park Pitt's biggest rivalry in recent years has been with West Virginia University, which began with football games that date back to 1895, and spills across multiple sports. The annual contests are called the Backyard Brawl due to the proximity of the two schools' main campuses that are 57 miles apart (as the crow flies), as well as the shared boundary between western Pennsylvania and North-Central West Virginia and the fact that both school reside in the same Designated Market Area. The football rivalry represents the most played opponent for each school, and in recent seasons has been traditionally played on Thanksgiving weekend, with the result often having implications both on the conference and national level. A men's basketball rivalry with WVU shared an intensity similar to that of the football one, and was also shared between the women's basketball teams as well. The rivalry had been relatively unique in college athletics in recent years as the two most high-profile sports, football and men's basketball, have resulted in games between teams have been all been nationally ranked in the same season. However, the football and basketball rivalries between the two schools were on hiatus due to Pitt and West Virginia moving into the ACC and Big 12 conferences, respectively. A four-year home and road football series has been scheduled from 2022\u201325. Since the 2017\u201318 season, an annual basketball series has resumed. Most other sponsored varsity and club sports fielded by both schools also shared a similar rivalry, and some continue despite the conference realignment for both schools. ===Duquesne rivalry=== The City Game trophy Pitt and Duquesne University have had a long-standing rivalry in men's basketball that dates to 1932. Dubbed the City Game, the inter-city rivalry pits the only two Division 1 basketball schools located within Pittsburgh's city limits. With their campuses located only three miles apart, it was the most intense basketball rivalry for both schools through the 1970s. The series currently scheduled to be held every year at the PPG Paints Arena and attracts significant local interest. Both schools' women's teams also play their annual version of the City Game. Prior to World War II, the schools were also rivals on the football field. ===Notre Dame rivalry=== Pitt has a longstanding rivalry with the University of Notre Dame. Pitt has played Notre Dame on a semi-regular basis since 1899, with never more than three years passing between contests since 1943. The two universities recently are in the midst of a contract to play eight games between 2008 and 2015. Notre Dame is tied for Pitt's third most played opponent in football while Pitt is Notre Dame's fifth most played opponent. In other sports, Pitt and Notre Dame both compete against each other regularly as members of the Big East Conference and those competitions continue when both schools moved into the ACC. ===Syracuse rivalry=== Pitt has a long-standing rivalry with eastern football foe Syracuse University, which also spills over onto the basketball court. Pitt and Syracuse have played in football without interruption since 1955, a streak that will continue when both schools move into the ACC and become designated cross-division rivals in that conference. Syracuse is tied as being Pitt's 3rd most played football opponent, while Pitt is Syracuse's second most played opponent. The basketball version of the rivalry dates to 1914 and has been played nearly 100 times. ===Cincinnati rivalry=== In 2005, Pitt began a football trophy rivalry with the University of Cincinnati Bearcats, dubbed the \"River City Rivalry.\" This annual Big East Conference game stems from both cities being situated along the Ohio River and features a trophy of a riverboat telegraph (a device for signaling the boat's engine room). However, with Pitt being moved to the ACC in 2013, the series is on hiatus for the foreseeable future with Pitt leading the all-time series 8\u20134. ===Other rivalries=== Pitt also has a significant basketball rivalry with the University of Connecticut. The Pitt and UConn rivalry first sparked with a last second win by then number one ranked Connecticut at Pitt's Fitzgerald Field House in 1998 that was followed by a crowd-displeasing emotional outburst by Connecticut's Khalid El-Amin. The rivalry took on new significance in the 2002 Big East Conference Tournament championship game that saw Pitt lose in double overtime. Pitt went on to avenge its loss the following season by defeating UConn in the 2003 Big East Championship game. Pitt and UConn also met for the championship in 2004 and have since played in many conference games of significance since. In the 2008\u20132009 season, Pitt earned its first win over the country's top-rated team by beating UConn on the road, and later at home while Connecticut was again ranked #1. However, the future of the rivalry is uncertain with Pitt's pending move to the ACC. Beginning in the 1980s, Pitt had an intense basketball rivalry with cross-state school and fellow Big East Conference member Villanova that was touched off by recruiting battles over several high-profile players. The future of this series is also in doubt when Pitt moves into the ACC. In the first half of the 20th century, a rivalry against Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon University), as well as a regional rivalry with Washington & Jefferson College ended following the deemphasis of the football and other athletic programs at those institutions post-World War II. From 1935 to 1941 Pitt football had a notable series with Fordham University which was then coached by Jim Crowley and featured guard Vince Lombardi. The series received attention because, at the time, both schools were national football powers whose first three meetings resulted in scoreless ties (1935, 1936 & 1937). ==Pageantry== ===Mascot=== The University of Pittsburgh officially adopted the Panthers of Pittsburgh as its nickname and mascot in 1909, shortly after changing its name from the Western University of Pennsylvania. The University of Pittsburgh claims that it was the first college or university to choose the panther as a mascot, which it did on November 16, 1909. According to alumnus George Baird, the reasons given for choosing the Panther were: # The panther was the most powerful animal that once roamed western Pennsylvania. # Its standing as a noble animal. # At the time, no other school used the panther as a symbol. # Its colors are similar to Pittsburgh's colors of gold and blue. # The \"happy accident of alliteration.\" Over 20 representations of panthers can be found in and around the university's campus and athletic facilities. Students, alumni, and fans rub the nose of one Panther statue in particular, the Millennium Panther located outside the William Pitt Union, in order to bring good luck to the university's teams prior to athletic contests. This tradition was featured in a national television advertisement for the 2012 Hyundai Tucson automobile. In addition, a costumed mascot, named \"Roc\", performs with the Pitt Cheerleaders at various athletic and non-athletic university events. Oakland Zoo ===Student sections=== The student section for basketball, the \"Oakland Zoo\", has received national acclaim for the atmosphere it helps to create in the Petersen Events Center. The student section for football is termed the Panther Pitt and has been recognized as being among the best in college football. ===Song=== The Pitt Band and its constituent Pitt Pep Band are often heard to play Pitt's fight songs, \"Hail to Pitt\", The Panther, and the \"Pitt Victory Song\" are typically played during athletic contests, along with other music. The University of Pittsburgh Alma Mater is typically played prior to or following athletic contests. In addition, a recent popular tradition involves the crowd singing a \"Let's Go Pitt!\" version of \"Sweet Caroline\" at various points during football games or other university events. The Varsity Walk ===Varsity Walk=== Varsity Walk is a walkway between the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Memorial Chapel on which is carved the names of former Pitt athletes (each year since 1950) who have promoted the university through their athletic (Panther Award) or academic (Blue-Gold Award) achievements. ===Victory Lights=== In a tradition that began in 1983, the upper section of the Cathedral of Learning is illuminated \"gold\" after every home football team victory, as well as important victories in other sports. ==Notable Panthers== Alumni, students, faculty, athletes and non-athletes alike, often refer to themselves as \"Panthers\". There have been many notable individuals who have been associated with the University of Pittsburgh throughout its history ranging from athletes like Mike Ditka and Larry Fitzgerald, to celebrities like Gene Kelly and Fred Rogers, writers like Michael Chabon, businessmen like Andrew Mellon, and scientists like Jonas Salk. For more examples, see the List of University of Pittsburgh people. ==Media== ===Pitt Panthers Television=== Starting with the 2010\u201311 school year Comcast and Xfinity in Western Pennsylvania will receive an all-Pitt-Panthers network featuring all sports and commentary hosted by Pitt in second-tier cable packages. The channel, located on the Comcast Network Channel 188 or 210, will also feature rebroadcasts of games carried by CBS, ABC or ESPN/ESPN2/ESPNU shot by its own production crew and with the Pitt Radio announcers on play-by-play. The university promises at least 500 hours a year of sports games and matches. ===Pittsburgh Panthers Radio Network=== Victory Lights The following radio stations are part of the Pittsburgh Panthers Radio Network. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=3 |Internet & Satellite |- | colspan=3 |CBS College Sports Panthers All-Access |- | colspan=3 |Sirius Satellite Radio |- ! colspan=3 |Terrestrial |- !
