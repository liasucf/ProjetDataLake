If you choose plane then it will drop you directly at one of the local air-strips in the district. But if you choose ship or speed boats, then they will drop at Wasu where there is a highway road called Kabwum Highway linked to the mountainous part of the District. From there you can choose one of the local PMV to take you to your destiny.
