(prior to April 2016 McGraw Hill Financial, Inc., and prior to 2013 McGraw-Hill Companies) is an American publicly traded corporation headquartered in Manhattan, New York City. Its primary areas of business are financial information and analytics. It is the parent company of S&P; Global Ratings, S&P; Global Market Intelligence, and S&P; Global Platts, CRISIL, and is the majority owner of the S&P; Dow Jones Indices joint venture. \"S&P;\" is a shortening of \"Standard and Poor's\". ==Corporate history== The predecessor companies of S&P; Global have history dating to 1888, when James H. McGraw purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. John A. Hill had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company. In 1909 both men, having known each other's interests, agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. In 1917, the remaining parts of each business were merged into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. In 1964, after Hill died, both McGraw-Hill Publishing Company and McGraw-Hill Book Company merged into McGraw-Hill, Inc. In 1966, McGraw-Hill purchased credit rating agency Standard & Poor's from Paul Talbot Babson. In 1979, McGraw-Hill purchased Byte magazine from its owner/publisher Virginia Williamson who then became a vice-president of McGraw-Hill. In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the United States' largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the United States. In 1995, McGraw-Hill, Inc. became The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. as part of a corporate rebranding.
