According to the Romanian census from 2011, the city has a population of 17,042, made up of Hungarians (58.1%), Romanians (38.83%), Romani (2.4%), Slovaks 0.4% and others (0.5%).

From 1587 the Hungarian spelling Szalonta was used. Etymologically, the name is probably related with those of other Romanian localities (slavic names) like Slatina, Zlatna or Sl\u0103nic, whose Romanian meaning is \"S\u0103rata\" (\"Salted\"). It can also be derived from Hungarian \"szalona\" (\"bacon\"), a term having the same etymological meaning, and in regional context \u2013 the name of two contiguous villages are probably related with the types of stock growth in the area: M\u0103d\u0103ras, from Hungarian \"madar\" (\"bird\"), and Tulca from Hungarian \"tulok\" (\"bullock\") \u2013 it may refer to the numerous pig growers in its perimeter. Until the 16th century, it was only a small village of about 300 inhabitants and was on the land of the Toldi family. A bigger city was the fort of Culiser, which was however destroyed by the Turks in 1598. Culiser was never rebuilt and Salonta began to have a more important role in the region after 1606, when the prince of Transylvania, Stephan Bocskai settled 300 soldiers here and appropriated land for them. They built their own farms, but had to keep their arms ready to repel an attack by the Turks. 3 June, the day in which the soldiers were settled, is nowadays declared \"the day of the city\". However, Ottoman Turks captured the town in 1660 and as \"Salanta\", it became the sanjak center of Varat vilayet until 1692. The 19th century Hungarian poet J\u00e1nos Arany was born and lived in Salonta for most of his life. Lajos Zilahy, another noted Hungarian author, was also born in Salonta on 27 March 1891. Salonta, along with all of Transylvania, became part of Romania with the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. From 1940 to 1944, as a result of the Second Vienna Award, it formed part of Hungary; after the Second World War, the Paris Peace Treaties reaffirmed the Trianon border. ==Climate and geography== Salonta has a continental humid climate, with warm to hot summers and cold to very cold winters, but relatively little snow.

Most of the state-owned factories built during the communist period went into bankruptcy since 1989.
