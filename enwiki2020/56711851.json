He was a wood merchant by profession, and a member of the Spartacus League. In November 1918, during the German Revolution, he was elected to the Leipzig Workers' and Soldiers' Council. K\u00e4stner was also a founding member of the Leipzig branch of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1919. When the KPD was banned in 1923\u20131924, underground meetings were held in K\u00e4stner's office. After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, K\u00e4stner's office was once again used for underground gatherings of KPD activists from Leipzig as well as nearby towns such as Chemnitz, Dresden and Riesa, and for printing illegal pamphlets. K\u00e4stner was arrested in September 1933; although he was sentenced to two years and eight months' imprisonment, he was interned in the concentration camps Sachsenburg, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald until 1939. After his release, K\u00e4stner joined the resistance group around Georg Schumann and maintained contact with resistance fighters in Hamburg, Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg. K\u00e4stner was arrested again by the Gestapo on 11 March 1945. He was shot to death by the SS in , northwest of Leipzig, and thrown in a pit together with 52 other German and foreign anti-fascists on 12 April 1945, just a week before the U.S. Army entered Leipzig. The street in the S\u00fcdvorstadt borough of Leipzig where Alfred K\u00e4stner lived was renamed Alfred-K\u00e4stner- Stra\u00dfe on 1 August 1945. ==References== Category:1882 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Politicians from Leipzig Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Communists in the German Resistance Category:Deaths by firearm in Germany Category:Executed communists in the German Resistance Category:People from Saxony executed by Nazi Germany Category:People of the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 Category:Sachsenhausen concentration camp prisoners ",
