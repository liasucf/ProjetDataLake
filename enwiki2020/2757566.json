They have released three albums. Psychotica are best known for their participation in the 1996 Lollapalooza tour which also included Soundgarden, the Ramones, the Screaming Trees and Metallica. In 1998, Psychotica added guitarist Clint Walsh and released Espina. A tour with Jack Off Jill and Switchblade Symphony followed. Shortly after the tour, Briggs moved to Los Angeles. Briggs and Kostabi went in different directions and Psychotica disbanded. In the summer of 2009, Briggs and Kostabi reunited to begin work on the fourth Psychotica album. Psychotica partnered with Christian Menses and his independent record label, Toxic Shock Records to re-release Pandemic. ==Discography== *Psychotica (1996, Ventrue Entertainment/American Recordings) logo/cover designed by Stephen Sprouse *Espina (1998, Zero Hour Records) *Thorn (2004, Art Monkey Records) (Expanded reissue of Espina) *Pandemic (2003, Art Monkey Records) (Previously unreleased 1999 album for Red Ant Records) *Pandemic Re-Release (2008, Toxic Shock Records) *Psychotica Acoustic (2009, Psychotica Records) (Digital only release) *I Will Survive EP (2009, Toxic Shock Records) *Black Dahlia EP (2010, Toxic Shock Records) *All The Broken Souls & Pandemic (2018, Wanker Records) ==References== ==External links== * *Official Psychotica Page *Official Myspace Page *Interview with Psychotica in Absenta Musical *Chicago Tribute *History of Psychotica by Elizabeth V.
