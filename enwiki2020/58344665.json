    "text": "\"Nice Guy\" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his tenth studio album Kamikaze, released on August 31, 2018 via Shady Records. Recording sessions took place at Effigy Studios in Detroit. Produced by Fred Ball and Symbolyc One with additional production by Em, it features guest vocals by Canadian singer Jessie Reyez. Despite never being released as a single, the song has managed to chart in several countries. Aja Romano of Vox wrote: \"'Nice Guy' and 'Good Guy' both trade on the popular conception of the \"nice guy\" as an embodiment of the kind of entitled misogyny that leads to the violence we see in \"Normal\". It's not exactly groundbreaking, and as always, it's so difficult to uncouple Em's critique of misogyny from actual misogyny that it might as well be one and the same\". Craig Jenkins of Vulture.com wrote: \"The methodical Jessie Reyez raps on \"Nice Guy\" nudge the marquee artist toward pointed story raps that revisit his old glory, when songs gripped with emotion and honesty, not just a barrage of internal rhymes. The melodic relationship raps on the back end of \"Normal\" pose the question of how much better this half of Eminem's decade could've gone had he poured himself into collaborations with guys like Drake and Future instead of writing their entire wing of rap off as heralds of some coming real hip-hop apocalypse\". ==Personnel== *Marshall Mathers \u2013 main artist, vocals, additional producer, mixing, songwriter *Jessie Reyez \u2013 featured artist, vocals, songwriter *Larry Griffin Jr. \u2013 producer, songwriter *Fred Ball \u2013 producer, songwriter *Luis Resto \u2013 additional keyboards, songwriter *Mike Strange \u2013 recording, mixing *Joe Strange \u2013 recording *Tony Campana \u2013 recording ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 songs Category:Eminem songs Category:Jessie Reyez songs Category:Songs written by Eminem Category:Songs written by Jessie Reyez Category:Songs written by Symbolyc One Category:Songs written by Fred Ball (producer) Category:Songs written by Luis Resto (musician) Category:Song recordings produced by Symbolyc One ",
