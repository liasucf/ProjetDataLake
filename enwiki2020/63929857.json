    "text": "Accession or Accessio is method of original acquisition of property under Scots property law. It operates to allow property (the accessory) to merge with (or accede to) another object (the principal), either moveable or heritable (land). Accessio derives from the Roman law concept of the same name. Other jurisdictions employ similar rules. The leading case in this area is said to be Brand's Trustees v Brand's Trustees (1876) 3 R (HL) 16. A common example is a tree (the accessory) acceding to the land (the principal), thereby the tree is owned by the owner of the land on which it is planted by the operation of accession. Accession may appear similar to other modes of original acquisition, but each mode has discrete differences. Importantly, accession does not produce a new object (rem) in itself, such as specificatio, accesio merely accessorises one object to another (the principal). == Types of Accession == There are broadly two types of accession: (1) natural accession and (2) human accession.Erskine Institute II,1,15; Bell Principles ss 1297, 1298. === Natural Accession === Natural accession occurs by the operation of nature alone,Erskine Institute II,1,15 eg: A tree sapling owned by C is planted in a garden owned to B, a cow belonging to F impregnates a cow belonging to G, thereby acceeding ownership of the calf foetus to G. === Human Accession === Industrial, or human, accession occurs whereby property are merged artificially, such as by welding, drilling or other permanent affixment. eg: a hood ornament, owned by Z, is welded to a car, owned by a W. == Requirements for Accession == It is now recognised that there are three requirements for accession to occur, irrespective if human or natural accession.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, para 571. These are: === (1) Physical Union === Accession requires a physical bond or attachment between the two objects. e.g.: a tree can be physically attached to land by taking root === (2) Functional Subordination === The accessory must be functionally subordinate to the principal. === (3) Permanency === The accessory must be merged to the principal in a permanent manner. This is to ensure that attachments of short length do not create an accession.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Accession, para 571. E.g.: A tent recently affixed to the land it is erected upon does not accede as there is no permanency. The test for accession is said to be applied \"mechanically\",Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Accession, para 572. ie: the circumstances of the accession are not analysed. Viscount Stair was of the opinion that accession can occur irrespective of the consentSee Dixon v Fisher (1843) 5 D 775 at 793, per Lord Cockburn. or bad faith in the merger of the accessory and principal. Stair Institutions II,1,38,39. As consent is irrelevant, neither owner can contract out of accession occurring.Shetland Islands Council v BP Petroleum Development Ltd 1990 SLT 82 == Legal Effects of Accession == There are three legal effects where accession has occurred, whereby the principal and accessory become owned by the principal's owner insevereably.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, para 574. These are: === (1) The accessory becomes part of the principal === The accessory, as a matter of property law, becomes an inherent part of the principal. This means that where the ownership of the principal is transferred, ownership will travel with it, eg: when a house is sold, the tree planted in the garden of the house is transferred with the land. === (2) Conversion === If the accessory is a different class to the principal, the accessory will be reclassified (ie converted) as the class of the principal.Erskine Institute II,2,2,4. Eg: the tree planted in the garden of a house is no longer a corporeal moveable property, but is considered corporeal heritable property. === (3) Extinction of Title === Ownership of the accessory is extinguished by ownership of the principal.Stair Institutions II,1,34; Erskine II,1,14; Bell Principles ss 1297, 1298. In circumstances where ownership (title) of an accessory was held by a separate individual from the owner of the principal, the owner of the principal becomes the owner of the accessory.Brand's Trustees v Brand's Trustees (1876) 3 R (HL) 16 Thus, ownership of the accessory is extinguished. Eg: A tree sapling, owned by C, is planted in the garden of a house owned by D. At the moment it is considered to have acceded, ie: when the tree takes root in the soil of the garden, thereby meeting the above three tests of accession, ownership of the tree now belongs to D. ==== Compensation ==== There is no legal authority for compensating owners of accessories who have had their right extinguished by natural accession.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Ch 12, para 577. However, where extinction of a separate individual's ownership occurs by way of industrial, or human, accession (eg: a hood ornament, owned by Z, is welded to a car, owned by a W), compensation from the principal owner is available only where the principal's owner instructed the accessory's owner to merge the object, or the principal merged the accessory himself.Stair Institutions II,1,38 and 39; Bankton Institute I,9,43; II,1,17 Where an accessory owner has the merged the object, compensation is not recoverable unless the owner of the accessory acted in good faith and has a reasonable, but mistaken, belief that he owned the principal.Barbour v Halliday (1840) 2 D 1279; Buchanan v Stewart (1874) 2 R 78; Duke of Hamilton v Johnston (1877) 14 SLR 298. In such circumstances, the law of unjustified enrichment, part of the Scots law of obligations applies.Scotland Act 1998 s.126 Where a third party, and is not an agent of the two owners, has merged the two objects to cause accession; compensation is recoverable from the third party.Good Faith: Stair I,7,2; Erskine III,1,10. Bad Faith: Oliver and Boyd v Marr Typefounding Co Ltd (1901) 9 SLT 170, OH; International Banking Corpn v Ferguson Shaw & Sons 1910 SC 182, 1909 2 SLT 377 As compensation falls as part of a personal right, enforcement of a right of compensation does not apply to subsequent owners of the principal.Beattie v Lord Napier (1831) 9 S 639. == Separation of Accessory == If the accessory is removed from the principal, eg: the tree in the house of the garden owned by D (see above examples) is dug up by a thief, E, the property is reconverted to its original class of property (e.g.: the tree, once uprooted, is considered a moveable again) and is considered an independent piece of property again. However, ownership of the accessory does not fall by occupatio to the removing individual but is widely considered to remain with the owner of the principal before the accession. However, there is authority in Scots law that the original owner of the accessory obtains ownership so this rule may subject to subsequent clarification,Scottish Discount Co Ltd v Blin 1985 SC 216, at 226; Stair II,1,38. eg: the young tree planted by C in the garden belonging to D, uprooted and stolen by E would legally belong to C again under this interpretation of the law of accession. == Moveable Accessory acceding to Heritable Principal (Fixtures) == Moveable accessories that have acceded to a heritable principal are known as fixtures, with similar concepts of the same name found in other legal jurisdictions. Fixtures, ie: that which has acceded by the three rules above, should not be confused with fittings (such as chairs, desks, drawers). Fixtures alone transfer with the heritable principal,Christie v Smith's Executrix 1949 SC 572, 1950 SLT 31 fittings do not. The three requirements for accession must always be met. However it is possible for the weight of a fitting alone to cause it to accede to the heritable property, irrespective of the physical union to the land.Christie v Smith\u2019s Exr 1949 SC 572 Functional subordination must also apply here too, the accessory must be functionally subordinate to the heritable property for it to accede.Assessor for Fife v Hodgson 1966 SC 30. Difficulty can arise where it can be difficult to identify where a fixture is functionally subordinate, as such the issue of functional subordination is dependent of the fact of the case at hand.Cochrane v Stevenson (1891) 18 R 1208. The test for functional subordination of fixtures is expressed by Gretton & Steven as: > \"does the item appear to be attached for the improvement of the land or for > the better enjoyment of the item?\" In certain situations, a constructive fixture can accede to heritable property where it traditionally would not be considered to be an accessory. A notable example of this is the keys to a house or moveable parts of a machine that itself is a fixture of heritable property.Fisher v Dixon (1843) 5 D 775 at 801, per Lord Cockburn. As discussed above, due to the narrow test for fixtures, it is common practice for fittings to also be included in the sale and subsequent transfer in any event, either expressly or impliedly as a matter of Scots contract law. It is common practice, for example in the missives of sale of a house, to include certain fittings such as whitegoods or curtains, as is the case with the Scottish Standard Clauses. This means that a voluntary transfer of fittings will also take place when the heritable property (land) is sold to avoid any disputes or litigation as to what it is classified as a fixture or fitting. == Heritable Accessory acceding to Heritable Moveable (Alluvion or Alluvio) == Heritable property is capable of acceding to other heritable property, known as alluvio after the Roman law method of acquisition of the same name. This primarily operates by rivers or other moving-waters such as the tide depositing sediment, or alluvium, deposited by a river. It should not be confused with avulsion, which occurs when there is a deposit of sediment after a heavy storm or other weather event. == Accession of Fruits == Certain fruits, fructus, or products (the accessory) accede to the property (the principal) that created them. The institutional writers considered there were three cases where accession of fruits occurs:Stair Institutions II,1,34; Bankton Institute II,1,10; Erskine Institute II,1,14; Bell Principles s 1297 === Animals in utero === A animal mother's child in the womb belongs to the owner of the mother while the child remains in utero (gestation period or pregnancy).Lamb v Grant (1874) 11 SLR 672. The accession ends upon the birth of the child but as the owner of principal will still retain ownership of the accessory (see above), the child will belong to the owner of the mother. === Natural Products of Plants and Animals === Natural products of plants (e.g.: sap, flowers, fruits etc.) and animals (milk, fur, honey, etc.) accede to the principal until they are physically separated. === Trees, Plants, Crops === Trees, plants and other crops accede to the land (heritable accessory) upon which they take root.Erskine II,1,15. However, an important exception is made for industrial crops. which do not accede to the land they are rooted upon. == References == Category:Scotland Category:Scots law Category:Roman law Category:Civil law (legal system) ",
