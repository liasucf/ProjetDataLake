In the list of historical monuments in Munich, more than 30 objects are listed in the T\u00fcrkenstra\u00dfe. == Location == The 1.3 km long T\u00fcrkenstra\u00dfe runs from the Brienner Stra\u00dfe in a northeasterly direction and ends at the border of the district Schwabing, in the Georgenstra\u00dfe. == History == The approval of the street name in 1812 by royal rescript of Max I. is the first nomination as T\u00fcrkenstra\u00dfe. In 1823, the T\u00fcrkenkaserne (Turkish barracks) were built on the area between Barer, Gabelsberger, T\u00fcrkenstra\u00dfe and Theresienstra\u00dfe. Infantry regiments were initially stationed here, so the barracks was used by the Bavarian State Police after the First World War, which gave way during the Drittes Reich of the Wehrmacht. After civilian use in the post-war period, the barracks were demolished in the 1960s. All that remains today is the historically protected T\u00fcrkentor. On the site today are various museums, including the Pinakothek der Moderne, and university institutes located. As of 1848, on the corner of Brienner Stra\u00dfe stood the Wittelsbacher Palais. Originally built as a Crown Prince's Palace for Max I, however, immediately after its completion it became the retirement seat of Ludwig I and later the residence of Ludwig III. After a varied history as a meeting place for the Soviet Republic and Gestapo headquarters, it was destroyed by a bombing in 1944. In 1964, the remaining ruins were removed and the Bayerische Landesbank was built on its location. In 1874, August von Voit set up a simultan school, where boys and girls of different faiths were equally received. After severe damage in the Second World War, the school was renovated several times and received its present appearance in the 1950s. Today, in the building with the number 68, is a primary school with a Sch\u00fclerhort (daycare) and after school program, as well as a municipal kindergarten. The square next to the school was named after Georg Elser. In 1903, Kathi Kobus opened the cabaret restaurant Simplicissimus in the premises of the former Crown Prince Rudolf. Karl Valentin appeared regularly there in 1907, other regular guests included Frank Wedekind, Ludwig Thoma, Thomas Theodor Heine and Julius Beck. Erich M\u00fchsam and Joachim Ringelnatz were so-called house poets and until the destruction in 1944, the Simplicissimus was a central starting point for the Munich, in particular the Schwabinger, cultural scene. Today, the Turkenstra\u00dfe is located next to many restaurants, the Museum Brandhorst and a police inspection office. == Historical monuments on T\u00fcrkenstra\u00dfe == Historically significant protected monuments on the T\u00fcrkenstra\u00dfe are, for example, the Palais D\u00fcrckheim (a former aristocratic palace and later Prussian legation), the T\u00fcrkentor (entrance gate of the former Turkish barracks) or the Old Simpl. In addition, there are numerous rental buildings from the 19th century, which were designed in neo-barock or neo-Renaissance styles. == Literature == * Hugo M\u00fcller: Ein M\u00fcnchner erinnert sich - T\u00fcrkenstra\u00dfe 26.
