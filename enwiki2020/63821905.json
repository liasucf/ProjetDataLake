    "text": "The Tyrone county football team represents County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, in men's Gaelic football and is governed by Tyrone GAA, the County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the Ulster Senior Football Championship and the National Football League. Tyrone's home ground is Healy Park, Omagh. The team's manager is Mickey Harte. The team last won the Ulster Senior Championship in 2017, the All-Ireland Senior Championship in 2008 and the National League in 2003. ==Kit evolution== ==History== Peter Canavan shoots during his county's 2005 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final victory over Kerry. Tyrone won their first Ulster Championship in 1956, defending it successfully in 1957. They did not win a third Ulster title until 1973. The Tyrone Minors, however, won the All-Ireland in 1947, 1948 and 1973. 1973 is remembered because Frank McGuigan, who captained the minor team, was also part of the Under-21 and Senior teams that won their Ulster Championships. Tyrone first tasted success in the mid- eighties with a team that included McGuigan, Eugene McKenna, Plunkett Donaghy and John Lynch. They won their fourth Ulster title in 1984, and in 1986 they reached their first All-Ireland final, where they were beaten by Kerry, 2\u201315 to 1-10. They added another Ulster championship in 1989, beating Donegal in the final replay. In 1994, Tyrone were defeated in the Ulster Final by Down, but their forward Peter Canavan was Ulster's top scorer, winning his first All Star Award. The following year they reached their second All-Ireland final. Dublin won the 1995 final 1\u201310 to 0\u201312, in a match that was notable both for Canavan scoring 11 of Tyrone's 12 points, and for Dublin's Charlie Redmond failing to leave the pitch for a full minute after being sent off for a foul. In 1996, Tyrone again met Down in the Ulster final, this time emerging victorious. In 1998, the Tyrone Minors won the All-Ireland final for the first time in fifteen years, with a team that included future senior team players Cormac McAnallen, Stephen O'Neill and Ryan McMenamin. McAnallen also captained the Under-21s to successive All-Ireland titles in 2000 and 2001. 2003 saw the introduction of the new Tyrone Manager, Mickey Harte. Harte took Tyrone to victory in the All-Ireland championship in his first year. They beat Down in the Ulster final after a replay, with Harte switching McAnallen from midfield to full back after the drawn match. They beat Fermanagh in the All-Ireland quarter-finals, before overpowering Kerry in the semi-final to win by 0\u201313 to 0\u20136. The 2003 final saw Tyrone pitted against neighbours and rivals Armagh, the reigning Champions. It was the first All-Ireland Football Final between sides from the same province. Tyrone ran out 0\u201312 to 0\u201309 winners to lift the Sam Maguire Cup for the first time. 2003 also saw Tyrone win the National Football League for the second successive year. Tragedy struck the following year with the sudden death of Cormac McAnallen, at the age of 24. Tyrone, however, came back the following year to win the title for the second time. They played five matches in the Ulster championship, including replays in the second round against Cavan and the final against Armagh, which they lost. Having beaten Monaghan in the qualifiers, Tyrone had yet another drawn game in the quarter-final, against Dublin \u2013 a match notable for Owen Mulligan's stunning solo goal. In the semi-final, they met Armagh for the third time, winning 1\u201313 to 1\u201312 with an injury-time free kick by Peter Canavan. In the 2005 final, they defeated Kerry for the second time in three years to win the All-Ireland, sparking emotional scenes among the Tyrone team and fans, in remembrance of Cormac McAnallen. Tyrone won their eleventh Ulster title in 2007, but lost to Meath in the All-Ireland quarter-final. They lost their Ulster quarter-final to Down in 2008, but came back via the qualifiers to win their third All-Ireland, beating Kerry 1\u201315 to 0\u201314 in the 2008 All-Ireland Final. They reached the semi-final in 2009, when they were beaten by Cork; in 2013, when they were beaten by Mayo; in 2015, when they were beaten by Kerry; and 2017, when they were beaten by Dublin. They won their fifteenth Ulster Championship in 2017. ==Current squad== Squad as per Tyrone v Kerry, 2019 All- Ireland Senior Football Championship Semi-Final, 11 August 2019 ==Current management team== *Manager: Mickey Harte *Coach: Gavin Devlin, Fergal McCann, Stephen O'Neill ==Players== ===Notable players=== ===All Stars=== Tyrone have 49 All Stars. * 1980: K.
