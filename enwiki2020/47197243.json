A special ergonomic and orthopedic grip was installed in order to provide comfort by reducing the muscle strain of the user hand to a minimum. Active-reactive muzzle breaks reduce overall recoil. The base design can be further altered and modifiedhttp://www.newsgeorgia.ge/v-gruzii- razrabotali-snajperskuyu-vintovku-sateravi/ ==Modularity== The rifle design allows a multi-caliber setup with yet unspecified details. A total of 7 cartridge types can be fired with the weapon, ranging from .308 Win to .50 BMG giving it penetration capabilities against both soft and lightly armoured targets. ==Accuracy== The designer states an overall accuracy of 0.3 MOA field tested with bipod. Fixed may be more accurate. ==Designation== The name \"Satevari\" derives from a type of ceremonial Georgian dagger which is being carried together with a traditional national dress called Chokha. The specific designation may be implication to the rifle's accuracy.http://www.georgianjournal.ge/discover-georgia/29676-evolution-of- georgian-weaponry-part-i-melee-before- gunpowder.htmlhttps://www.academia.edu/1917231/Khevsuruli_dashna ==See also== *List of sniper rifles *Remington MSR *Sako TRG *M24 Sniper Weapon System *KSVK 12.7 *OSV-96 *OM 50 Nemesis *Barrett M95 *Zastava M93 *Zastava M12 Black Spear ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Sniper rifles Category:Sniper warfare Category:Bolt-action rifles Category:Anti- materiel rifles ",
