Formed in 2010, they have released two full length studio albums and an EP produced by Casey Bates.casey bates == Background == Much of their popularity comes from their masks created by artist Duane Flatmo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwNPH7Qwv1s and their progressive rock sound which has landed them several years at SXSW.http://ventsmagazine.com/the-body- rampant-la-altrockers-head-to- sxsw-2013/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf-0qm3M22A The group has been featured in publications like Kerrang!, Big Cheese (magazine),http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_body_rampant_stream_new_single_woodland and was called 'brilliant' by Rocksound. Their music video for 'Sativa' premiered on MTV. == History == ===Formation and Transient Years (2010-2011)=== After Lopez's previous band Every Bridge Burned (Rise Records) disbanded, he quickly found himself in the studio recording new songs with producer Casey Bates. He moved to Los Angeles, CA from the rural area of Humboldt County, CA and began putting together the collective. Months later the members were solidified and the group headed back to Johnny Cab Studios in Seattle, WA to finish the 'Transient Years' EP with Casey. Armed with some creepy avant-garde masks and a fresh new EP, the band was poised to play as many shows possible with bands like Letlive, Unlocking the Truth, No Bragging Rights, and many more. Alternative Press stated \"The band are determined to make a name for themselves because of their heavy pop music, not their looks.\" ===Line-up changes and Midnight Mayfair (2013)=== Several member changes later, Lopez and crew embarked to Baltimore, MD to record their debut full- length album with Producer Brian McTernan.http://propertyofzack.com/post/33654492813/the-body-rampant- recording-lp-with-brian-mcternan The album was written and recorded in one month, and released several months later through Antique Records.
