Until 1951 it was a separate village, then it became part of Warsaw. Before the Second World War Falenica, which is located in a forested area, was a favorite location for summer cottages and houses. == World War II == During World War II the Germans opened a Jewish ghetto there, called Falenica-Miedzeszyn Ghetto. All of its inhabitants were transported to Treblinka in August 1942.
