    "text": "In linguistic typology, time\u2013manner\u2013place is a general order of adpositional phrases in a language's sentences: \"yesterday\", \"by car\", \"to the store\". Japanese, Afrikaans, Dutch, Mandarin, and German belong to this category. An example of this appositional ordering in German is: {| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;\" | ' || ' || ' || ' || ' || ' || ' || ' |- style=\"font-size:80%\" | I || drive || today || with || the || car || to || Munich. |- | colspan=\"7\"| I'm travelling to Munich by car today. |} The temporal phrase \u2013 ' (\"today\") \u2013 comes first, the manner \u2013 ' (\"by car\") \u2013 is second, and the place \u2013 ' (\"to Munich\") \u2013 is third. One way to remember the order in German is the mnemonic acronym ZAP: ' (time), ' (manner), ' (place). Another, in English, is the \"acronym\" TeMPo. It is a subset of the system called ' in German, from Latin: ', ', ', ', or time- cause-manner-place English and French use this order only when the time is mentioned before the verb, which is commonly the case when time, manner, and place are all mentioned. ==See also== * Syntax ==External links== * Word Order in German \u2014 Part 1: German Syntax Category:Grammar Category:Syntactic relationships Category:Syntax ",
