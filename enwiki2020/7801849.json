In 1992, she sang in the band Euphoria, for which she wrote the song \"Karma\". Meares later made her name as a glamour model, before establishing her own swimwear label Tigerlily Swimwear. Meares is an occasional reporter for the Nine Network's travel show Getaway. She has also appeared 3 times on the Nine Network's clip show \"20 to 1\". She was the host for FOX8's Australia's Next Top Model in 2007 and 2008, taking over from Erika Heynatz, and joining the likes of international hosts Lisa Snowdon (UK) and creator Tyra Banks (US). In both of those seasons, the models have appeared in advertisements for Meares's former swimsuit line, Tigerlilly. Meares's tenure was not widely regarded; critics and fans of the show were shocked that a glamour model was to host a search for High Fashion models. In 2013, Meares began activewear label, 'The Upside'. ==Personal life== On 23 October 1999, she married Australian media businessman James Packer at Packer's home at Bellevue Hill, Sydney. They separated in June 2002. ==References== ==External links== * Jodhi Meares: my best times, ninemsn.com.au * * Jodhi Meares Gallery Category:1971 births Category:Australian Scientologists Category:Australian television personalities Category:Glamour models Category:Living people Category:People from the South Coast (New South Wales) ",
