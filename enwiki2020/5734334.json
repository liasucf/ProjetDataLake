It was released in 1989 in the U.S., Japan, and the U.K., and in 1990 in Europe as the second single from the album Cuts Both Ways. Estefan performed this song with Sheila E. during the seventh season edition of the American Idol charity fundraiser Idol Gives Back. The performance was released as a single and as a video at the US iTunes Store to raise money for charities in Africa and the United States. A rerecorded version was included on her 2020 album Brazil305https://www.allmusic.com/album/brazil305-mw0003406173/credits ==Critical reception== AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier said the song is \"club-ready\" with its \"big late-'80s synth-drum patterns\", adding it as a \"super\" song. Maryann Scheufele from AXS wrote, \"The words, \"get up and make it happen...stand up and take some action ...\" is a song for the ages, ...and the song inspires the spirit that lives on when you do something about your life. Gloria Estefan convinces you that the weight of inaction is lifted off your shoulders when you \"get on your feet\". Gloria Estefan sings and Miami Sound Machine plays we all can dance our way through life to this one.\" Bill Coleman from Billboard called it \"an unassuming up-tempo pop/dance track harking back to the singer's \"Conga\" days.\" Entertainment Weekly commented in their review, that the song has \"surge and hustle\". Music & Media called it \"another lightweight up-tempo tune. As Latin as ever and a guaranteed hit.\" Pop Rescue noted that the track \"ups the tempo somewhat, as the title suggests, with a plodding bass and beat, with acoustic guitars strumming. Gloria bursts in with her confident pop vocals. The song is up-lifting, telling you to \u2018Get on your feet. get up and make it happen\u2018 and \u2018Stand up and take some action\u2018.\" ==Official versions== Original Versions # Album Version -- (3:38) # 2020 version (on Brazil305) \u2013 3:25 John Haag Remixes # Special Mix -- (5:38) Justin Strauss & Daniel Abraham Remixes # Pop Vocal -- (6:07) # House Vocal -- (6:50) # House Techno Dub -- (5:30) # Deep Bass Vocal -- (5:29) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1989) !Peak position |- |Australia (ARIA Chart) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|98 |- |Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|35 |- |Belgium (Ultratop Wallonia) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|21 |- |Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|49 |- |Netherlands (Single Top 100) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|15 |- |Ireland (IRMA) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|5 |- |Japan (Tokyo) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- |New Zealand (RIANZ) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|47 |- |UK Singles (Official Chart Company) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|23 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play | style=\"text-align:center;\"|20 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |- |West Germany (GfK Entertainment Charts) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|46 |- |} ==Usage in media== In a widely circulated viral video \"Steve Ballmer Going Crazy\", former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer danced and screamed wildly to this song at the company's 25th anniversary event in 2000.
