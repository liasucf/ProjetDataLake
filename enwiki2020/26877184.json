    "text": "In the Dzogchen tradition in Tibetan Buddhism ground (; IAST: \u0101\u015braya or sth\u0101na) is the primordial state. It is an essential component of the Dzogchen tradition for both the Bonpo and the Nyingmapa. Knowledge of this Ground is called rigpa. ==Etymology== The has been rendered as 'Base', 'Basis', 'Ground' and 'Ground of Being' amongst other English glosses. According to Dudjom the original Sanskrit-term is \u0101\u015braya (IAST; Sanskrit Devanagari: \u0906\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092f; Etymology: \u0906- \u221a\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093f), but it could also be sth\u0101na.

They give a process- orientated translation, to avoid any essentialist associations, since The 19th/20th-century Tibetan Buddhist scholar, Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, sees the Buddha-nature as ultimate truth,Rabjam, Shechen (2007).
