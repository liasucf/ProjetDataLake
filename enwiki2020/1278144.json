    "text": "The Nissan Xterra is a front-engine, 2-wheel or 4-wheel drive, five-door, five passenger, truck-based compact SUV manufactured and marketed by Nissan Motors from 1999\u20132015 across two generations; the first (1999\u20132004) sharing a platform as well as front bumper, hood, A-pillar, windshield and front doors with the Nissan Frontier pickup - and the second (2005\u20132015) also sharing its platform with the Frontier. While the two Xterra generations differed significantly, both prioritized ruggedness and affordability over luxury and used body-on-frame construction along with underbody skid plates. Both generations also used a two-box design with c-pillar-mounted rear door handles, asymmetrical rear window, tailgate bump-out for a first aid kit accessible from inside - and a prominent two-tiered roof enabling stadium seating in the second row. The stepped roof accommodated a lower, front roof rack with a removable gear basket and a more conventional roof rack at the rear, upper roof. Nissan licensed the Xterra name from the XTERRA off-road triathlon race series and manufactured the SUV at Nissan's Smyrna Assembly, as well as in Canton, Mississippi. Variants were also manufactured in Brazil and China. Developed at Nissan Design America in La Jolla, California, the Xterra was the first Nissan vehicle completely conceived, developed and manufactured in the United States. According to Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design International, \"the impetus for Xterra designers was to create an affordable, rugged, quality piece of equipment\". Road & Track described the Xterra as \"an honest SUV that doesn't try to be a luxury car alternative, nor tries to hide its truck underpinnings\". Jalopnik called it a \"knockoff of the Land Rover Discovery\". The Washington Post described it as \"rugged without bravado\". ==First generation WD22 series (1999-2004)== ===1999\u20132001=== The Xterra was introduced in North America in the 2000 model year, using Everything you need, nothing you don't as its marketing tagline. During the Xterra's first two years, two trim levels were offered, marketed as XE and SE. The XE featured a KA24DE I4, 5-speed manual transmission, and steel wheels as well as several option packages combining the 170 horsepower 3.3 L VG33E V6 engine with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, as well as roof rack, side step-rails, sunroof, and carpeted floor mats. The SE featured standard equipment that was optional on an XE. All models featured removable, tab- secured rear seat cushions to accommodate a fold-flat rear seat back. Canadian models from 1999 to 2004 were limited to the VG33E V6 engine with part-time 4WD. ===2002\u20132004=== 2002\u20132004 Nissan Xterra With the 1999 Xterra having been developed at Nissan Design America in California, all updates for the 2002 Xterra were executed at Nissan Technical Center-North America in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The facelifted model debuted at the 2001 Chicago Auto Show prominently revised front-end styling with rounded headlights, revised instrument panel, center console, larger glove compartment, pullout rear cup holders and four interior power points, foot-operated pedal parking brake (vs. previous a dash-mounted pull-and-twist parking brake) -- and an increase of 10 horsepower for the V6 engine. The 3.3L VG33E V6 was upgraded to at 4,800 rpm and 202 lb\u22c5ft (274 N\u22c5m) at 2,800 rpm, with the supercharged VG33ER option carried over from the 2001 Nissan Frontier, producing of torque for the automatic, and of torque with 5-speed manual. For 2003, options included side- curtain airbags and a tire pressure monitoring system. The 6-disc, 4-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system was replaced by a 6-speaker 300W Rockford Fosgate AM/FM/CD audio system with an 8-inch subwoofer that took up a small portion of the rear storage area. The last of the model year 2004 Xterras were manufactured in January 2005. ==Second generation N50 series (2005-2015)== ===2005-2015=== The second generation Xterra debuted at the New York International Auto Show in 2004 using Nissan's F-Alpha platform. Larger in all dimensions than its predecessor, it entered showrooms in early 2005 for the 2005 model year. The standard engine was upgraded to Nissan's 4.0 L VQ40DE variable valve timing V6, producing .http://www.rockcrawler.com/features/newsshorts/05january/xterra_production.asphttp://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/autos/reviews/healey/2005-01-13-drive- xterra_x.htm A rear differential locker was offered for off-roading. ===2009 update=== 2009\u20132012 Nissan Xterra The Xterra received a facelift for 2009 (July 2008 production) with more options and colors, leather seats on SE models, and roof mounted lights on off-road models.
