    "text": "Schematic structure of an antibody-oligonucleotide conjugate (AOC) Antibody- oligonucleotide conjugates or AOCs belong to a class of chimeric molecules combining in their structure two important families of biomolecules: monoclonal antibodies and oligonucleotides. Combination of exceptional targeting capabilities of monoclonal antibodies with numerous functional modalities of oligonucleotides has been fruitful for a variety of applications with AOC including imaging, detection and targeted therapeutics. == See also == * Antibody-drug conjugate * Conjugated protein * Immune stimulating antibody conjugate * Bioconjugation ==References== Category:Nucleic acids Category:Monoclonal antibodies Category:Biotechnology ",
