Elizabeth Brabin owned the estate in 1749 and, with her husband Henry, built the Georgian Brabyns Hall and began the landscaping of the grounds. The house faced down the valley to take advantage of the views and lodges controlled access into the park. In 1800, the estate was purchased by Nathaniel Wright and, in 1811, the house was extended with lake added and chestnuts, poplars and cypress trees planted. Ann Hudson inherited the estate in 1866 and it continued in the female line until Fanny Hudson died in 1941. The estate was bought by Cheshire County Council and was opened for public recreation. The hall was demolished in 1953 and, subsequently, the farm house in the 1970s. ==Landmarks== The park is part of the Marple Conservation Area, due to its historic planned landscape.http://democracy.stockport.gov.uk/documents/s19110/Marple p.2 The iron bridge at the park is Grade II listed with Historic England.
