Historically this comarca was part of Castile and formed part of the province of Cuenca in the 1833 provincial division of Javier de Burgos. As such, its inhabitants have been traditionally monolingual in Spanish and not Valencian-speakers. However, in 1851 it was merged into the province of Valencia, as a result of its commercial ties with the city of Valencia.
