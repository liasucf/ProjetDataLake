    "text": "Now is the eighth studio album by Australian blues musician Ash Grunwald. The album was released in September 2015, peaking at number 52 on the ARIA Charts. Grunwald called the album \"modern psychedelic, sci-fi, swamp rock, blues album, if there is such a thing\". ==Reception== Colin Morris from Stuff NZ said \"Aimed squarely at the blues market that think it's simply 12 bars and an electric guitar, Grunwald wants you on the dancefloor screamin' shoutin' and crunching the beats underfoot. I love, even though at parts it's overblown, the sheer swagger of this disc. It's got a big heart mixed into a big sound.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 52 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Edition(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- | rowspan=\"2\"| Australia | 25 September 2015 | | Standard | Delta Groove / Bloodlines / Shock Records | DG12 |- | 22 February 2019 | | Reissue | Bloodlines Records | BLOOD41 |} ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Ash Grunwald albums ",
