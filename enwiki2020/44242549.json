Pahlavi regime's security forces, who were awaiting Imam Khomeini's reaction about Ayatollah Saeedi death, strongly controlled the Khosravi border crossing. Therefore, they arrested Aboutorabi when he was crossing the border, and took him to SAVAK station in Kermanshah when they found the statements. He was moved to Tehran one day later. The cunning of Aboutorabi in dealing with SAVAK interrogators and normal response to questions, led to be not very long his prison term, though SAVAK officials were not convinced.

Aboutorabi says about the early days of his captivity:\"several time in jail they took me to the gallows and counted 1 and 2 for extracting confessions but each time they took me back. During the day, they took and brought me several time. Eventually at night they took me to Al- Amare school. An Iraqi general told those who were there: he has not right to sleep; we come back at midnight for extracting confessions, if he did not have enough information, we would nail his head. They came back at midnight and nailed my head, but it was not such a hit to die.\" When Abutorabi was tortured in Iraq, it was rumored in Iran that he has been martyred.
