Reliance Mining acquired the nickel rights in 2003 and was acquired by Consolidated Minerals in 2005. The mine was placed in care and maintenance in 2008. It was acquired by Salt Lake Mining in 2013 after that company also secured gold mining rights. It resumed producing nickel in 2014 and started producing gold in November 2015. In September 2018, a large deposit of gold-bearing quartz rock was discovered in the mine during routine blasting, underground. ==References== Category:Nickel mines in Western Australia Category:Gold mines in Western Australia Category:Goldfields- Esperance ",
