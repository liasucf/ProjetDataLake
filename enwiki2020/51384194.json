Ruiz is married to Patricia Mojica, they have a daughter Juana Lucia (born 2013). His wife is also a long-distance runner, and competes in the same team at the national level. Ruiz initially wanted to become a cyclist, but could not afford buying a racing bicycle, and eventually changed to running at the age of 16\u201318. Between 2009 and 2015 he had no sports funding and no personal coach, and hence worked in the family business, and also as a courier and accounting assistant. He received state funding in November 2015. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Colombian male long-distance runners Category:Colombian male marathon runners Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Colombia ",
