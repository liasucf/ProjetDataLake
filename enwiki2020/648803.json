    "text": "Mirjana \"Mira\" Markovi\u0107 (, ; 10 July 1942 \u2013 14 April 2019) was a Serbian politician, academic and the wife of Yugoslav and Serbian president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. She was the leader of the Yugoslav United Left (JUL) which governed in coalition with Milo\u0161evi\u0107's Socialist Party of Serbia in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. She was reported to have huge influence over her husband and was increasingly seen as the power behind the throne. Among her opponents, she was known as The Red Witch and the Lady Macbeth of Belgrade. Markovi\u0107 was accused of abuse of office, inciting several associates to allocate a state- owned apartment for her grandson\u2019s nanny in September 2000. She was indicted in December 2002 and fled Belgrade on 23 February 2003. In June 2018, she was declared guilty in absentia by a court in Belgrade, and sentenced to a year's imprisonment, but the verdict was overturned on appeal in March 2019. Markovi\u0107 lived under political asylum in Russia from February 2003 until her death on 14 April 2019 in Moscow. ==Life== ===Early life=== Markovi\u0107 was the daughter of Moma Markovi\u0107 and Vera Mileti\u0107, who were both fighting for the Yugoslav Partisans at the time of her birth. Her aunt was Davorjanka Paunovi\u0107, private secretary and alleged mistress of Josip Broz Tito. Her mother Vera was captured by German troops and allegedly released sensitive information, under torture. She was then executed in the Banjica concentration camp by the Nazis. Markovi\u0107 met Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 when they were in high school together. They married in 1965. The couple had two children, son Marko and daughter Marija, who founded TV Ko\u0161ava in 1998 and was its owner until 5 October 2000. ===Education and career=== Markovi\u0107 held a Ph.D. in Sociology and taught the subject at the University of Belgrade. Later, she became an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. She was considered to be the only person her husband trusted, her influence being considered a source for the increase in Milo\u0161evi\u0107 strong anti-western rhetoric and actions. \"She invented him\", Milo\u0161evi\u0107 biographer Slavoljub \u0110uki\u0107 told the Ottawa Citizen in 1998. \"There has never been such a powerful woman in the history of Serbia as Mirjana Markovic. And she has been fatal for Serbia.\" As the leader of her own political party, Yugoslav United Left she held some political influence. Markovi\u0107 was largely responsible for erecting the Eternal Flame monument, shortly before the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in 2000. She was believed, though not formally accused, of being involved in the murders of her husband's political rivals including the Serbian politician Ivan Stamboli\u0107, Milo\u0161evi\u0107's former mentor, in 2000, and the journalist Slavko \u0106uruvija the previous year. \"Milosevic has never had any political ideas of his own\", Stamboli\u0107 said in 2000. \"They\u2019ve all been hers.\" She wrote a political column in the weekly Serbian magazine Duga during the sequence of wars in the 1990s. Observers read it for any coded messages. In the old Yugoslavia, she once wrote \"Serbs, Muslims and Croats were able to live side by side\", though her husband and his associates presided over its destruction. Some sources have said she died in Sochi. Markovi\u0107 was the author of many books, which were translated and sold in Canada, Russia, China and India. ===Political views=== Markovi\u0107's political views tended to be hard-line Communist. Although she often claimed that she agreed with her husband on everything, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 seems to have had fewer authoritarian tendencies than Markovi\u0107. She claimed also to be a feminist. Markovi\u0107 reportedly had little respect for the Bosnian Serb leaders. Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj appeared before a court on 18 June 1994 to face charges of breaking microphone cables in Parliament. He read a statement, saying, \"Mr. Judge, all I can say in my defense is that Milo\u0161evi\u0107 is Serbia's biggest criminal.\" Markovi\u0107 replied by calling \u0160e\u0161elj a \"primitive Turk who is afraid to fight like a man, and instead sits around insulting other people's wives.\" Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 was apparently unable to telephone Milo\u0161evi\u0107 because Markovi\u0107 would not tolerate his calls. Commenting on her husband's arrest to face war crimes charges, Markovi\u0107 stated: ===Asylum in Russia and death=== Pursued by legal authorities, Markovi\u0107 settled in Russia in 2003. The authorities of Serbia issued an arrest warrant for her on fraud charges which was circulated via Interpol, but the Russian authorities refused to arrest her. In March 2012, a collection of her columns for Pravda from 2007 to 2008, as well as for online portal Sloboda from 2010 to 2011, titled Destierrada e imperdida was published in Belgrade by Tre\u0107i milenijum, a publishing house owned by Had\u017ei Dragan Anti\u0107. After the 2012 elections, a government minister, Milutin Mrkonji\u0107 of the Socialist Party (which he co-founded with Milo\u0161evi\u0107) said that Markovi\u0107 and her son were welcome to return. In June 2018, Markovi\u0107 was found guilty in absentia of real estate fraud charges, and sentenced to a year in prison. The Serbian Appeals Court in March 2019 rejected her conviction, finding it unsound, and ordered a new trial. Markovi\u0107 underwent several operations, and died in Moscow on 14 April 2019. The New York Times reported her death was caused by complications due to pneumonia. Her body was cremated and interred in Po\u017earevac alongside her husband on 20 April 2019. ==Books== *Night and Day: A Diary - Dragisa Nikolic, December 1995 - 978-8682005223 *Night & Day: A Diary - Quarry Press, May 1997 - 978-1550821680 *Answer - Quarry Press, March 1997 - 978-1550821697 ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== Category:1942 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Po\u017earevac Category:Spouses of national leaders Category:First Ladies of Yugoslavia Category:Serbian feminists Category:Yugoslav Left politicians Category:Serbian communists Category:Serbian women in politics Category:Serbian exiles Category:Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 Category:Burials in Po\u017earevac ",
