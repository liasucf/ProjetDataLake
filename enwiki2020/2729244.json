It is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. ==History== ===Aboriginal culture=== Prior to European settlement, what is now Cambridge Park was home to the Mulgoa people who spoke the Darug language. They lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. Their homes were bark huts called \"gunyahs\". They hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered yams, berries and other native plants. Shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in Australia in 1788, an outbreak of smallpox decimated the local indigenous communities. ===European settlement=== The first land grant in the area was made in 1831 to Phillip Parker King, son of the Governor Phillip Gidley King. He named it St Stephens although it later became part of the Werrington estate belonging to his sister Mary Lethbridge. It was run as a farm until the 1880s when the estate was subdivided into smaller farms, one of which became Cambridge Park. Development in the area began in the 1950s. Cambridge Park Post Office opened on 2 January 1953 and closed around 1995. ==Housing== Developed mainly in the 1950s, the streets are at right angles to each other, unlike the curving street patterns of the newer suburbs to the north, and the houses are mostly fibro on quarter acre blocks. ==Demographics== According to the 2016 census of Population, In the 2016 Census, there were 6,726 people in Cambridge Park. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.9% of the population. * 77.6% of people were born in Australia.
