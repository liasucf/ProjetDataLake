The Sl\u00edghe Chualann [\"Cualu Way\"] was a major road to Tara which crossed the Liffey at [\"Ford of Hurdles\"], beside the later site of Dublin city. Henry Morris suggested, based on a story in a law tract, that the [\"men of Cualu\"] had originally lived further north, in Brega around Tara, until displaced by the Ciannachta after the battle of Crionna. Among the kings of Leinster were Cellach Cualann (died 715) and Crimthann mac \u00c1edo (died 633) who the Annals of Tigernach say was \"of Cualu\".Charles-Edwards 2006, p.138, n.5 \"Tuathal son of Cremthann, king of Cualu\" died in 778.Charles-Edwards 2006, p.243 In the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, Cualu was a son of Breog\u00e1n, as were the founders of three territories further north: Brega, Muirtheimhne, and Cuailgne. The legendary Medb Lethderg was daughter of Conan, king of Cualu. James MacKillop identifies the Fir Chualann with the Cauci of Ptolemy's world map. As early as 1946, T. F. O'Rahilly had also suggested a possible connection between the two.T. F. O'Rahilly, Early Irish History and Mythology, pp, 24-27, Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, Dublin (1946, 1984) The \"ale of Cuala\" was the prerogative in various texts of either the High King of Ireland or the king of Leinster. In Norman times, \"Fera Cualann\", anglicised Fercullen, was a smaller territory than ancient Cualu, encompassing the north Wicklow Mountains and ruled by the O'Toole family, which later became the manor of Powerscourt. The Irish name for Great Sugar Loaf mountain is \u00d3 Cualann [\"heap of Cualu\"]. During the Gaelic revival, was revived by the Gaelic League as a name for south Dublin\u2013north Wicklow. Cuala Press was a private press founded by W. B. Yeats' sisters which published works by him and colleagues. was coined as an Irish name for Bray, County Wicklow, later rejected as inauthentic by the Placenames Branch. Cuala CLG is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in Dalkey. Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann was a 1960s Irish traditional music ensemble named by Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada after its home area. ==References== ===Sources=== * ===Citations=== Category:History of County Wicklow Category:History of County Dublin Category:Medieval Ireland ",
