The University's founder, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, and its first president, Henry Marshall Tory, worked with faculty members and the first librarian, Eugenie Archibald, to select the first purchases to start the University Library in 1908. The record of these first 200 selections is still housed in the University Archive and includes a set of the works of Edgar Allan Poe; fourteen volumes of the works of Washington Irving; and various works by Walter Scott, Jean Froissart, Henry Fielding, Charles Lamb, George Eliot, Edward Gibbon, T. B. Macaulay, Robert Louis Stevenson, William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Victor Hugo, John Richard Green, Henry Hallam, Tobias Smollett, Rudyard Kipling, and John Stuart Mill. By the end of 1911, the Library had acquired more than 7,000 volumes. By the end of Tory's tenure as president in 1928, the library owned 32,500 volumes. During the first few decades of the University's operations, library staff operated a small facility in the Main Teaching Building, or Arts Building, which had already become overcrowded by the 1930s. In 1947, during the tenure of President Robert Newton (1941\u201350), the University received approval from the provincial government to begin construction of a library building. When construction was completed on Rutherford Library, it was the first new permanent building on campus in 30 years. === Chief Librarians === * Eugenie Archibald (1909\u20131911) * D. E.
