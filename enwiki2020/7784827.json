    "text": "Mission Puerto de Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n was founded near what is now Yuma, Arizona, U.S.A. on the California side of the Colorado River, in October, 1780, by Father Francisco Garc\u00e9s. The settlement was not part of the California mission chain, but was administered as a part of the Arizona missions. The Mission site and nearby pueblo were inadequately supported, and Spanish colonists seized the best lands, destroyed the Indians' crops, and generally ignored the rights of the local natives. In retaliation the Quechan (Yuma) Indians and their allies attacked and destroyed the installation and the neighboring Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu\u00f1er over a three-day period, from July 17\u201319, 1781. Today, only a historical marker identifies the site. The marker is located on Picacho Road in Fort Yuma, California, one mile south of Winterhaven Road. ==See also== * Spanish missions in Arizona ==References== ==External links== * Missions of the Colorado River * Discovery of California * Virtual Tour of California Missions * California State Landmark plaque Category:1780 establishments in the Spanish Empire Category:Spanish missions in Arizona Category:Spanish missions in California Category:Catholic Church in Arizona Category:National Register of Historic Places in Imperial County, California ",
