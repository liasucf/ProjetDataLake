    "text": "George Brettingham Sowerby III (16 September 1843 \u2013 31 January 1921) was a British conchologist, publisher, and illustrator. He, too, worked (like his father George Brettingham Sowerby II and his grandfather George Brettingham Sowerby I) on the Thesaurus Conchyliorium, a comprehensive, beautifully illustrated work on molluscs. He was colour blind, and thus his daughter did most of the colouring of his engravings. ==External links== * Petit, R. E. (2009).
