    "text": "In Morocco, the 75 second-level administrative subdivisions are 13 prefectures and 62 provinces. They are subdivisions of the 12 regions of Morocco. Each prefecture or province is subdivided into arrondissements (only in prefectures of some metropolitan areas), municipalities (communes, sing. commune) or urban municipalities (communes urbaines, sing. commune urbaine) in other urban areas, and districts (cercles, sing. cercle) in rural areas. The districts are subdivided into rural municipalities (communes rurales, sing. commune rural). One prefecture (Casablanca) is also subdivided into pr\u00e9fectures d'arrondissements (sing. pr\u00e9fecture d'arrondissements), similar to districts (cercles) except they are grouping a few arrondissements instead of rural municipalities. Note: The arrondissements and (urban) municipalities should probably be thought of as fourth-level subdivisions, on the same level as the rural municipalities, but they are not part of any district.HCP.ma List of districts and municipalities (communes) of Morocco by province/prefecture Moroccan administrative division == Current administrative divisions == === Mainland Morocco === ==== Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima Region ==== * M'diq-Fnideq Prefecture * Tangier-Assilah Prefecture * Al Hoce\u00efma Province * Chefchaouen Province * Fahs-Anjra Province * Larache Province * Ouezzane Province * T\u00e9touan Province ==== Oriental Region ==== * Prefecture of Oujda-Angad * Berkane Province * Driouch Province * Figuig Province * Guercif Province * Jerada Province * Nador Province * Taourirt Province ==== F\u00e8s-Mekn\u00e8s Region ==== * Prefecture of F\u00e8s * Prefecture of Mekn\u00e8s * Boulemane Province * El Hajeb Province * Ifrane Province * Sefrou Province * Taounate Province * Taza Province * Moulay Yacoub Province ==== Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra Region ==== * Prefecture of Rabat * Prefecture of Sal\u00e9 * Prefecture of Skhirat-T\u00e9mara * K\u00e9nitra Province * Kh\u00e9misset Province * Sidi Kacem Province * Sidi Slimane Province ==== B\u00e9ni Mellal-Kh\u00e9nifra Region ==== * Azilal Province * B\u00e9ni-Mellal Province * Fquih Ben Salah Province * Kh\u00e9nifra Province * Khouribga Province ==== Casablanca-Settat Region ==== * Prefecture of Casablanca ** Prefecture of arrondissements of Casablanca Anfa ** Prefecture of arrondissements of Al Fida - Mers Sultan ** Prefecture of arrondissements of A\u00efn Seba\u00e2 - Hay Mohammadi ** Prefecture of arrondissement of Hay Hassani ** Prefecture of arrondissement of A\u00efn Chock ** Prefecture of arrondissements of Sidi Bernoussi ** Prefecture of arrondissements of Ben M'Sick ** Prefecture of arrondissements of Moulay Rachid * Prefecture of Mohammedia * Ben Slimane Province * Berrechid Province * El Jadida Province * M\u00e9diouna Province * Nouaceur Province * Settat Province * Sidi Bennour Province ==== Marrakech-Safi Region ==== * Prefecture of Marrakech (fr) * Al Haouz Province * Chichaoua Province * El Kel\u00e2at Es-Sraghna Province * Essaouira Province * Rehamna Province * Safi Province * Youssoufia Province ==== Dr\u00e2a-Tafilalet Region ==== * Errachidia Province * Midelt Province * Ouarzazate Province * Tinghir Province * Zagora Province ==== Souss-Massa Region ==== * Prefecture of Agadir-Ida Ou Tanane * Prefecture of Inezgane-A\u00eft Melloul * Chtouka A\u00eft Baha Province * Taroudant Province * Tata Province * Tiznit Province === Western Sahara (most under de facto Moroccan administration) === Most of Western Sahara is administered de facto by Morocco (where the area is informally named the Southern Provinces by the Moroccan government and media); the rest is administered by the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The United Nations considers the territory to be disputed, as it was not legally transferred by Spain when it abandoned its former colony in 1975, and several states (notably members of the African Union) either recognize the SADR as the sole legitimate government of Western Sahara, or consider that the status of the region (either as an independent state, or as part of Morocco, or as part of Mauritania that initially claimed a part of it) has still not been autodetermined by the local population prior to its annexation. The United Nations has no legal instruments confirming the claims on the region made by the governments of Morocco or the self-proclaimed SADR, and in international treaties it is still a formal part of Spain that remains to be properly decolonized, even though Spain and Mauritania no longer claim any part of it. Since the annexation, the situation is worsened by the fact that most of the historic Western Saharan population has fled either to the remaining free zone (now isolated by the Moroccan militarized berm), or to refugee camps in neighbouring countries (notably Algeria), due to lack of resources in the free zone. The remaining native Western Saharan population now lives as a minority among the new Moroccan occupants. The absence of a legal government with a permanent administration in the free zone has also introduced a threat to the security of the surrounding countries in the Saharan and Sahel regions, including Morocco itself. ==== Guelmim-Oued Noun Region ==== * Assa-Zag Province (partly located in Western Sahara) * Sidi Ifni Province (located in Mainland Morocco) * Guelmim Province (located in Mainland Morocco) * Tan-Tan Province (located in Mainland Morocco) ==== La\u00e2youne-Sakia El Hamra Region ==== * Boujdour Province * Es Semara Province * La\u00e2youne Province * Tarfaya Province ==== Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab Region ==== * Aousserd Province * Oued Ed-Dahab Province ===Regions of Morocco=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | Geographic Code ! rowspan=\"2\" | Region ! rowspan=\"2\" | Capital ! colspan=\"2\" | Subdivisions ! colspan=\"2\" | Population (2014) ! colspan=\"2\" | Area ! rowspan=\"2\" | Population density |- ! # of provinces and prefectures ! # of communes !
