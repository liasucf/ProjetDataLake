    "text": "Chicken soup, a common classic comfort food that is found across various cultures Comfort food is food that provides a nostalgic or sentimental value to someone,\"Comfort Food.\" (definition). Merriam-webster.com. Accessed July 2011. and may be characterized by its high caloric nature, high carbohydrate level, or simple preparation. The nostalgia may be specific to an individual, or it may apply to a specific culture. () ==Definition== The term comfort food has been traced back at least to 1966, when the Palm Beach Post used it in a story: \"Adults, when under severe emotional stress, turn to what could be called 'comfort food'\u2014food associated with the security of childhood, like mother's poached egg or famous chicken soup.\" ==Psychological studies== Consuming energy-dense, high calorie, high fat, salt or sugar foods, such as ice cream, chocolate or french fries, may trigger the reward system in the human brain, which gives a distinctive pleasure or temporary sense of emotional elevation and relaxation. When psychological conditions are present, people often use comfort food to treat themselves. Those with negative emotions tend to eat unhealthy food in an effort to experience the instant gratification that comes with it, even if only short-lived. One study divided college-students' comfort-food identifications into four categories (nostalgic foods, indulgence foods, convenience foods, and physical comfort foods) with a special emphasis on the deliberate selection of particular foods to modify mood or effect, and indications that the medical-therapeutic use of particular foods may ultimately be a matter of mood-alteration. The identification of particular items as comfort food may be idiosyncratic, though patterns are detectable. In one study of American preferences, \"males preferred warm, hearty, meal-related comfort foods (such as steak, casseroles, and soup) while females instead preferred comfort foods that were more snack related (such as chocolate and ice cream). In addition, younger people preferred more snack- related comfort foods compared to those over 55 years of age.\" The study also revealed strong connections between consumption of comfort foods and feelings of guilt. An article, \"The Myth of Comfort Food\" asserted that men tend to choose these types of savory comfort foods because they remind them of being \"pampered\" or spoiled, while women choose snack-related foods because they are associated with low amounts of work and less \"cleanup.\" It also suggested that women are more likely to reach for unhealthier foods in times of stress due to more weight-conscious mindsets. Comfort food consumption is seen as a response to emotional stress and, consequently, as a key contributor to the epidemic of obesity in the United States. The provocation of specific hormonal responses leading selectively to increases in abdominal fat is seen as a form of self- medication. Further studies suggest that consumption of comfort food is triggered in men by positive emotions, and by negative ones in women. The stress effect is particularly pronounced among college-aged women, with only 33% reporting healthy eating choices during times of emotional stress. For women specifically, these psychological patterns may be maladaptive. A therapeutic use of these findings includes offering comfort foods or \"happy hour\" beverages to anorectic geriatric patients whose health and quality of life otherwise decreases with reduced oral intake. ==By region== A partial list by region of comfort foods around the world. === Afghanistan === Comfort foods in Afghanistan are: * Aushak \u2013 stuffed dumplings and sauce * Bolani \u2013 filled flatbread * Borani Banjan or Borani-e-Banjan \u2013 baked eggplant with yogurt sauce * Borani Kadoo or Borani-e-Kado \u2013 sweet and savory braised pumpkin with yogurt sauce * Chainaki \u2013 lamb stew * Chalaw or Challow \u2013 steamed rice with spices * Kabuli palaw or Qabuli Palu \u2013 steamed rice with raisins, carrots, and lamb * Karahai \u2013 meat cooked in a traditional karahi pot * Kebab \u2013 grilled skewered meat * Korma Gosht or Qorma-e-Gosht \u2013 braised meat * Mantu \u2013 meat-stuffed dumpling * Naan \u2013 flatbread * Sabzi Palu \u2013 spinach (sabzi) with spices * Sher Berinj \u2013 rice pudding ===Australia and New Zealand=== Pavlova garnished with fruit and cream Comfort foods in Australia and New Zealand may include: * Braised lamb shanks * Bread and butter pudding * Butterscotch apple dumplings * Casserole (beef or chicken) * Chicken soup * Golden syrup pikelets * Honey and oat slices * Hot chips * Lamingtons * Mashed potatoes * Meat pie * Pea and ham soup * Pie floater * Porridge, topped with brown sugar or honey, yogurt, nuts, and fruit * Potato wedges * Pumpkin soup * Rice custard * Roast meat (beef, chicken, or pork with crackling) * Roast potatoes * Sausage and mash * Sausage roll * Shepherd's pie * Spaghetti * Steak and kidney pie * Sticky date pudding * Vegemite or Marmite on toast ===Canada=== A plate of classic poutine at a Montreal restaurant. * Butter tart / Tarte au sucre \u2013 small sweet tart-shaped pastries *Cake *Cheesecake *Chili and beans *Chocolate bars *Cookies *Fish and chips *Fried chicken *Fried rice *Ginger beef *Grilled cheese sandwich *Hamburger *Ice cream *Lasagna *Macaroni and cheese *Nanaimo bar *Pancakes with maple syrup *Pea soup *Pierogies *Pizza *Potatoes such as French fries, Hash browns, Mashed potatoes, Potato chips, and Potato salad *Poutine *Rhubarb pie *Scrambled eggs on toast *Tourti\u00e8re \u2013 meat pie with pork and lard === Egypt === Ful medames served with hard-boiled eggs, a staple in Egypt. * Basbousa \u2013 sweet unleavened cake * Falafel \u2013 fried bean ball * Fatteh \u2013 meat soup with crisp flatbread * Ful medames \u2013 bean stew * Hawawshi \u2013 pita bread stuffed with flavored meat * Kushari \u2013 casserole of rice, macaroni, and vegetables * Macarona b\u00e9chamel \u2013 baked pasta dish with ground meat and b\u00e9chamel sauce * Mulukhiyah \u2013 soup or stew made with mulukhiyah leaves ===France=== madeleine.
