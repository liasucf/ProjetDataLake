    "text": "Since the 1968 Summer Olympics did not feature tennis as an official sport, two unofficial tournaments were held during the Games: a Demonstration tournament and an Exhibition tournament. The Exhibition tournament was played from 24 to 26 October 1968 on the clay courts of the Chapultepec Sports Center in Mexico City, Mexico. All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule was not implemented until the 1970s, a player had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6\u20136 draw. Due to the short length of the tournament, no third place match was played, and both semifinal losers received bronze medals. Mexican Rafael Osuna won the tournament by defeating West German Ingo Buding 6\u20133, 3\u20136, 6\u20133 in the final. Both Soviet Vladimir Korotkov and Italian Nicola Pietrangeli won bronze medals. ==Seeds== Both seeds received a bye into the second round. ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top Half=== ===Bottom Half=== ==References== ==External links== * Official Results Archive (ITF) Exhibition ",
