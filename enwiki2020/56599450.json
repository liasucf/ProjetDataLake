It is an encyclopedic compendium or summa of Mahayana Buddhist doctrine. The D\u00e0 zh\u00ecd\u00f9 l\u00f9n was translated into Chinese by the Kuchean monk Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (344\u2013413 CE) and his student Sengrui. The colophon to this work claims it is written by the Buddhist philosopher N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (c. 2nd century), but various scholars such as \u00c9tienne Lamotte have questioned this attribution.Ramanan, Krishniah Venkata, Dr. (1966). N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's Philosophy as presented in Mah\u0101-praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101-\u015b\u0101stra . Charles E. Tuttle Company of Rutland, Vermont and Tokyo, 1966. page 13. According to Hans-Rudolf Kantor, this work was \"fundamental for the development of the Chinese Sanlun, Tiantai, Huayan, and Chan schools.\"Hans-Rudolf Kantor, Philosophical Aspects of Sixth-Century Chinese Buddhist Debates on \u201cMind and Consciousness, pp. 337\u2013395 in: Chen-kuo Lin / Michael Radich (eds.) A Distant Mirror Articulating Indic Ideas in Sixth and Seventh Century Chinese Buddhism, Hamburg Buddhist Studies, Hamburg University Press 2014. ==Textual history== The DZDL survives only in the Chinese translation of 100 scrolls made by the Kuchean monk Kum\u0101raj\u012bva from 402 to 405 CE.Ramanan, Krishniah Venkata, Dr. (1966). N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's Philosophy as presented in Mah\u0101-praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101-\u015b\u0101stra . Charles E. Tuttle Company of Rutland, Vermont and Tokyo, 1966. page 14. According to the primary sources, the Indic text consisted of 100,000 g\u0101th\u0101s (lines), or 3,200,000 Sanskrit syllables, which was condensed by Kum\u0101raj\u012bva by two-thirds to obtain the 100 scrolls of the Chinese translation. Kum\u0101raj\u012bva translated the first 34 scrolls in full, and abridged the rest of the material.Lee, Youngjin, Traditional Commentaries on the Larger Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 It was translated by Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, working together with his student Sengrui, who \u201cstopped writing, argued for the right translation,\u201d and \u201cchecked his translation against the original for the entire day\u201d as well as with the Qin emperor Yao Xing. The DZDL became a central text for the East Asian Sanlun ( J. Sanron) or Madhyamaka school and also influenced all the major schools of Chinese Buddhism. The DZDL acted as a kind of Mah\u0101y\u0101na encyclopedia for East Asian Buddhist thought, similar to the status of the Abhisamayalamkara in Tibetan Buddhism. Traditionally, it is held that the text is by the Indian Madhyamaka philosopher Nagarjuna. Against the traditional attribution of the work to Nagarjuna, \u00c9tienne Lamotte as well as Paul Demi\u00e9ville, concluded that the author must have been a Buddhist monk of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da or Mulasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school from Northwest India, learned in Abhidharma, who later converted to Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Madhyamaka and then composed \"a voluminous exegetical treatise which is like a Mah\u0101y\u0101na reply to the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din Abhidharma\". This is because the Abhidharma and Vinaya material found in this text coincides with that of the north Indian Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition.Ray, Reginald A.Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations, page 406 This is a widely accepted view among modern scholars. Lamotte also remarked on the internal evidence of the text which shows that its author was likely from a region that was within the Kushan Empire.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\u015b\u0101stra, Vol. III Chapters XXXI-XLII , 2001, page 876-877. Hikata Ryusho however argues that there is an ancient nucleus of material in this text that could be attributed by Nagarjuna (as well as a large amount of later accretions).Z\u00fcrcher, Erik, The Buddhist Conquest of China: The spread and adaptation of Buddhism in Early Medieval China, Brill Archive, 1959, p. 410. R. Hikata argued that while a part of the text was by Nagarjuna, it also included many \u201cadditions or insertions by Kum\u0101raj\u012bva.\u201dR. Hikata, Suvikr\u0101ntavikr\u0101mi-pariprcch\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101-S\u016btra (Fukuoka: Kyushu University Press, 1958), lii-lxxv. The Chinese scholar Yin Shun meanwhile, argues for the traditional attribution to Nagarjuna. In a recent study, Po-kan Chou has argued that the DZDL is a product of the editorship of Sengrui (352?-436?), Kum\u0101raj\u012bva's student, co- translator and amanuensis. ==Content== The text is primarily Mahayana and explains basic Mahayana doctrines such as Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101, and the other bodhisattva paramitas, but also includes much Sarvastivada Abhidharma, Jataka and early Buddhist content. As noted by Lamotte, \"the Treatise cites, at length or in extracts, about a hundred s\u016btras of the Lesser Vehicle; the majority are borrowed from the \u0100gama collections\".Lamotte, Etienne; Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron.

According to Akira Hirawaka, \"The arguments of the Ta-chih-tu lun, are primarily directed against the Vaibhasikas of the Sarvastivadin School.\"Akira Hirakawa, A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na, University of Hawaii Press, 1990, p. 256. The DZDL contains 90 chapters (p'in) in 100 rolls (kiuan). It comprises two series of chapters, according to Lamotte the first series of 52 chapters (Taisho. 1509, p. 57c-314b) \"appears to be an integral version of the Indian original\" while the second series of 89 chapters (Taisho. 1509, p. 314b-756c) seems to be an abridgement.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\u015b\u0101stra, Volume V Chapters XLIX \u2013 LII and Chapter XX (2nd series), p. 1772. The content of the first series, which has been translated by Etienne Lamotte (Fr.) and Karma Migme Chodron (Eng.) is as follows: * Chapters 1 to 15 comment on the prologue or nidana of the Pa\u00f1cavi\u1e43\u015batis\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutra (Taisho, T VIII, no. 223).Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\u015b\u0101stra, Vol. I Chapters I \u2013 XV, 2001. * Chapters 16 to 30 provide an extensive commentary on a short paragraph of the sutra which focuses on the six transcendent virtues or p\u0101ramit\u0101s.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\u015b\u0101stra, Vol. II Chapters XVI-XXX, 2001. * Chapters 31 to 42, according to Lamotte: \"this part, the most technical and without a doubt the most interesting part of the Trait\u00e9, has as its subject the practices forming the Path of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a and the attributes of the Buddhas.\"Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\u015b\u0101stra, Vol. III Chapters XXXI-XLII , 2001, p. 909. This includes the thirty-seven bodhip\u0101k\u1e63ikadharmas, the \"eight complementary classes of dharmas of the Path\" (such as the three samadhis and four dhyanas) and \"Six other classes of dharmas of the Path\" (such as the Nine a\u1e63ubhasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101s and the Eight anusm\u1e5btis). For each of these topics, the views of Sarvastivada Abhidharma are explained alongside the views Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 which often critique the Abhidharma understanding.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\u015b\u0101stra, Vol. III Chapters XXXI-XLII , 2001, pp. 910-911. The Agamas are also cited in these explanations. *Chapters 42 to 48 discuss the Bodhisattva vehicle, bodhicitta, merit, the abhij\u00f1as, emptiness (taught in the schema of the \"eighteen emptinesses\" \u5341\u516b\u7a7a), Madhyamaka, and the practice (\u015bik\u1e63\u0101) of Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\u015b\u0101stra, Vol. IV Chapters XLII (continuation) \u2013 XLVIII, 2001. *Chapters 49 to 52 discuss further topics such as the vows of a bodhisattva (in two sets of 24 vows and 38 vows) as well as causality, Dharmata, the divine eye (divyacak\u1e63u), and the four great elements.Lamotte, Etienne (French trans.); Karma Migme Chodron (English trans.); The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nagarjuna - Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\u015b\u0101stra, Volume V Chapters XLIX \u2013 LII and Chapter XX (2nd series). == Translations == One third of this work was translated by Etienne Lamotte as Le Trait\u00e9 de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse.Werner, Karel (2003).
