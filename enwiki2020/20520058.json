According to Women's Wear Daily (WWD) the plaintiffs involved in the suit are asking for $50 million per charge, adding up to $450 million for the 9 charges in total. One of the workers, Wenyu Lu claims that he was \"hospitalized for several days after he passed out at his work station because he was forced to work 25 hours straight without a break\". Lu claims that the 200 square foot office on Broadway is windowless and poorly ventilated and that workers have been forced to work 16 hours or more without overtime or breaks. The former worker's lawyer, Ming Hai, claims that Lu was eventually fired on February 16 due to complaints about working conditions and applying for workers' compensation. On August 14, 2012, WWD reported that the lawsuit had been dismissed. \u201cWe are gratified that this matter has been dismissed, as the allegations were unfounded and completely false,\" a spokesman for Wang told WWD.
