    "text": "Cathedral of Die, with square tower The former French Catholic diocese of Die existed from the fourth to the thirteenth century, and then again from 1678 to the French Revolution. It was suppressed by the Concordat of 1801, its territory being assigned to the diocese of Grenoble.Die (Diocese) [Catholic- Hierarchy] Its see was the Cathedral of the Assumption in Die. ==History== Situated on the River Dr\u00f4me, Die was one of the nineteen principal towns of the tribe of the Vocontii. It was made a Roman colony by the Emperor Augustus in the 20s B.C.J. Chevalier (1888), pp. vii\u201316. The Carthusian Polycarpe de la Rivi\u00e8re gives a St. Martinus (220) as first Bishop of Die; his assertion has been doubted.Polycarpe wrote an Annales Episcoporum Diensium, which exists in manuscript. Ses ouvrages historiques ont fait na\u00eetre des d\u00e9bats pour ainsi dire interminables, vu la difficult\u00e9 qu'on \u00e9prouve aujourd'hui \u00e0 verifier l'authenticit\u00e9 des documents don't il a fait usage. Polycarpe's ms. was used by Colombi in his history of the bishops of Valence and Die. Polycarpe claimed to have used for St. Martinus a poem written by Wulfinus, which he had read in some library in Paris, but the poem is not extant. Parva quidem fides Wulfino debetur, writes the Gallia christiana XVI, p. 509. The oldest historically known bishop, St. Nicasius, attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325. Audentius attended three regional councils, at Riez (439), Orange (441), and Vaison (442). After them are mentioned: St. Petronius, followed by his brother St. Marcellus (c. 463), confessor and miracle-worker; Lucretius (541\u2013573), to whom St. Ferreolus of Uzes dedicated his monastic rule. For various reasons Abb\u00e9 Jules Chevalier omits from the episcopal list: St. Maximus (sixth century); Wulphinus (end of eighth century); Exuperius and Saturninus (ninth century). Other bishops were: Hugh (1073\u201383), consecrated at Rome by Gregory VII, became a papal legate of the latter, presided over numerous councils for the reform of the Church, and subsequently became Bishop of Lyon; Ismido (1098\u20131115) of the noble house of Sassenage; Uric (1129\u201342), who opposed the Petrobrusian heresy in his diocese and became a Carthusian; Blessed Bernard (1173\u201376); Stephen (1203\u20131208), formerly a Carthusian at the monastery of Portes; Blessed Didier (Desiderius) de Lans (1213\u201320). The Cathedral of Die was dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. The Cathedral Chapter had two dignities, the Dean and the Sacristan, and ten other Canons. Ritzler, VI, p. 195 note 1. The Dean, Sacristan and Chapter are mentioned in the thirteenth century pouill\u00e9. In the thirteenth century the diocese was divided for administrative purposes into four Archpresbyteries: the Archpriest of Die, the Archpriest of Trivilis (Tri\u00e8ves), the Archpriest of Deserto, the Archpriest of Crista.Chevalier (1868), \"Septi\u00e8me Livraison: Polypticha, id est Regesta Taxationum Beneficiorum...\", pp. 43\u201352. There was a Collegiate Church at Crest (Crista) dedicated to Saint-Sauveur, which had a Provost, a Cantor, and six Canons.Piganiol de la Force, p. 384. F\u00e9lix Gr\u00e9goire, \"Un torrent, la Dr\u00f4me,\" After the eleventh century the Diocese of Die, long disputed between the metropolitans of Vienne and Arles, became suffragan of the archbishopric of Vienne. On 28 March 1165 Pope Alexander III confirmed by papal bull the grant to the Church of Die on the part of Arnaud de CrestC.U.J. Chevalier (1868), pp. 33\u201335. and Guillaume of PoitiersC.U.J. Chevalier (1868), pp. 35\u201336. of the abbeys of S. Marcel de Die,The Abbey of S. Marcellus de Die had been founded by Benedictines in 985. In 1182 or 1183, Pope Lucius III confirmed the possession of the abbey by the Bishops of Die. C.U.J. Chevalier (1868), p. 19. Saint-Medard, Saint-Croix, Saint Julien-de-Guiniaise, Leoncel, and Saou. The bull also confirms the possession of the entire city of Die and nine castle- towns including Crista.C.U.J. Chevalier (1868), pp. xiii and 20\u201322. By Papal Bull of 25 September 1275,Jean Giraud (ed.), Les Registres de Gregoire X (1272-1276) (Paris: Thorin 1892), pp. 272\u2013273 no. 637. in order to strengthen the Church of Valence in its struggle with the House of Poitiers, Gregory X united the Diocese of Die with that of Valence. Five days later, on 30 September, Pope Gregory wrote to Abbot Amadeus of Roussillon, informing him that he had been named Bishop of Valence in succession to Bishop Guy, who had died in 1272.J. Chevalier (1888), pp. 406\u2013408. Amadeus of Roussillon was the brother of the Archbishop of Lyon, Adhemar de Roussillon (1273\u20131283): Eubel, I, p. 316. It was no accident that Amadeus of Roussillon was the nephew of Amadeus of Geneva, Bishop of Die. Amadeus of Roussillon was present at the bedside of his uncle when he made his Testament on 21 January 1276.Amadeus of Geneva named as his universal heir his nephew, Aymon the Count of Geneva. J. Chevalier (1888), p. 409. Bishop Amadeus of Die died on 22 October 1276, and his nephew Amadeus of Roussillon became Bishop of Valence and Die. This union, which lasted four centuries, was unfortunate for the Church in Die. The Huguenot sect, derived from the Calvinism of Geneva, had taken firm hold in the Dauphin\u00e9, and in particular in the Alpine valleys. In order to combat Protestantism, therefore, King Louis XIV, published the Edict of Fontainebleau on 22 October 1685, revoking the special rights granted to Protestants in France in the Edict of Nantes. King Louis revived the diocese of Die and appointed a Bishop of Die in 1687. From the point of view of the Roman Catholic Church, however, the union of the two dioceses was dissolved canonically in the Consistory of 7 July 1692 by Pope Innocent XII.Ritzler, V, p. 184 note 1, and 403 note 1. On 10 September 1692, the Bishop of Die, Armand de Montmorin Saint-H\u00e9rem, had an interview with James II of England and Louis XIV. Asked for a report on the state of the Dauphin\u00e9, inter alia the Bishop reported that Die was entirely in the hands of the Huguenots.The report of the interview is printed by M. de Die ... (dit qu')il y'a beaucoup d'Huguenots dans le Dauphin\u00e9, et que la ville de Die l'est toute enti\u00e8re. In 1790 the Civil Constitution of the Clergy reduced the number of dioceses in France from 135 to 83, and ordered that they be coterminous with the new d\u00e9partments of the civil organization. Each d\u00e9partment was authorized and ordered to elect its own bishop; the electors did not have to be Catholic, and that fact alone created a schism between the Constitutional Church and Constitutional Bishops and the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop Gaspard-Alexis Plan des Augiers protested, and then fled his diocese; he died in exile in Rome in 1794. On 21 February 1791, the Constitutional diocese of Dr\u00f4me elected Fran\u00e7ois Marbos, cur\u00e9 of the parish of Bourg-lez-Valence as their 'bishop'. He was consecrated in Paris on 3 April 1791, by Jean Baptiste Gobel of Paris, assisted by Bishops Mirodot and Gouttes. After the Concordat of 1801 he retracted his errors, and died in communion with Rome in 1825. ==Bishops== ===to 1276=== *Nicaise : 325Bishop Nicasius was present at the Council of Nicaea in 325.

Ismido had been Canon of Lyon when, probably in 1096, he was assigned as Coadjutor to the Bishop of Die. He took part in the Roman synod of April 1099 of Urban II, as the Pope himself notes in a letter of 24 April 1099 to Archbishop Hugues of Lyon (P.
