    "text": "\"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" is a song by the Australian alternative rock band Silverchair. It was released in May 1999 as the second single from their third album, Neon Ballroom. The song is about lead vocalist Daniel Johns' struggle with anorexia nervosa. \"Ana's Song\" peaked at No. 14 on Australia's ARIA chart, at No. 12 on Billboard's Alternative Airplay and at No. 28 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. It was nominated for two Aria Awards in 1999: Single of the Year and Best Video. The track also earned Silverchair a Comet Award in Germany. ==Background== \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" is a single issued in May 1999 by Australian alternative rock band, Silverchair. It was written by the group's lead singer, Daniel Johns. In 1999, Johns announced that he had developed the eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, due to anxiety/depression. Johns noted that the lyrics to \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" dealt with his disorder, where he would \"eat what he needed ... to stay awake\". Ana is the nickname given to anorexia nervosa by people affected by it. He revealed that his eating problems developed from the time of Freak Show (May 1996) and when Neon Ballroom was written he \"hated music, really everything about it\", but felt that he \"couldn't stop doing it; I felt like a slave to it.\" Johns sought therapy and medication but felt \"It's easier for me to express it through music and lyrics\". Johns eventually overcame the disorder, realising that he would never be cured of the disease, but could live a fulfilled life by learning to cope with it. ==Reception== \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" peaked at No. 12 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks. On the ARIA Singles Chart it reached No. 14. According to 100 Best Australian Albums, by three Australian journalists, John O'Donnell, Toby Creswell and Craig Mathieson, \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" directly focused on Johns' eating disorder, \"[it] became a hit all over the world and opened up for discussion the fact that males could also be affected by anorexia\". ==Music video== The music video was directed by Cate Anderson, who also made the band's video for the song \"Emotion Sickness\". Australian actress Sarah Aubrey played the girl at the sink washing her hands, while having a distorted image of their cleanliness through the mirror. The video was nominated for an ARIA Award for Best Video in 1999. ==Reception== AllMusic critic Jason Anderson thought that \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" was one of the three highlights from Neon Ballroom. ==Track listing== Australian CD single (MATTCD086) # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" # \"Trash\" # \"Anthem for the Year 2000\" (a cappella) # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" (acoustic) Australian limited 7-inch vinyl (MATTV086) # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" # \"Anthem for the Year 2000\" (a cappella) European CD single (6671072) # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" # \"Anthem for the Year 2000\" (a cappella) # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" (acoustic) European CD single (with different cover) (6673455) # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" (acoustic) # \"Trash\" UK deleted CD single (6673452) # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" # \"The Millennium Bug\" (The Paul Mac Remix) # \"London's Burning\" UK limited 7\" picture disc (667345 7) # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" (acoustic) US promo CD (ESK42087) # \"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !Chart (1999) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Certification== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1998 songs Category:1999 singles Category:1990s ballads Category:Rock ballads Category:Silverchair songs Category:Songs written by Daniel Johns Category:Song recordings produced by Nick Launay Category:Songs written by Ben Gillies Category:Songs about eating disorders Category:Songs about diseases and disorders Category:Murmur (record label) singles ",
