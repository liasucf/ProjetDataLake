He was one of 13 children. His brothers included acting Mayor of Boston William Parker, businessman John Rowe Parker, and educator Richard Green Parker. He graduated from Harvard College in 1795 and after college, spent many years as an instructor at Philips Exeter Academy. On December 12, 1807 he married Elizabeth Mason, daughter of Jonathan Mason. They had seven children: *Susan Elizabeth (Parker) Hoppin, wife of Rev. Nicholas Hoppin *Susanna Powell (Parker) Grennough, wife of Alfred Greenough *Anne Cutler (Parker) Hinckley, wife of Samuel L.

Emory. After being admitted to the bar in 1823, Parker became a successful criminal defense attorney. On July 5, 1832, Parker was appointed District Attorney for Suffolk County by Governor Levi Lincoln Jr. During his tenure as DA, Parker tried Abner Kneeland multiple times for blasphemy. Kneeland's 1838 conviction was the last time a court in the United States jailed a defendant for blasphemy.Levy, Leonard. Blasphemy in Massachusetts: Freedom of Conscience and the Abner Kneeland Case. (1973) In 1842, Parker was the prosecutor in Commonwealth v. Hunt, a case which ruled that labor unions were legal. In 1844 he tried Abner Rogers Jr. for the murder of Charles Lincoln. Rogers was acquitted by reason of insanity. In 1846 he prosecuted Albert Tirrell for the murder of Maria Bickford, a prostitute he left his wife to be with. Tirrell's attorney Rufus Choate presented the defense that Tirrell could have murdered Bickford while sleepwalking. Tirrell was found not guilty. It was the first time a sleepwalking defense was successful in a murder case. In 1849, Parker tried Washington Goode, an African-American sailor, for the murder of Thomas Harding. Parker's case was largely circumstantial, but Goode was found guilty and hanged on May 25, 1849. On November 30, 1849 a group of men, including City Marshal Francis Tukey, Henry Jacob Bigelow, Parkman Blake, Robert G. Shaw, and members of the Boston Police Department came to Parker's home to inform him that human remains had been found. Parker advised them to make a complaint and gave them directions on what to do with the body. The body was determined to be that of George Parkman and Harvard Medical School professor John White Webster was arrested for his murder. Parker testified as a government witness during the Parkman\u2013Webster murder case. In 1852, Parker was removed from office for political reasons. He was succeeded by John C. Park. Parker died on July 29, 1873 at his home in Boston. ==References== Category:1781 births Category:1873 deaths Category:District attorneys in Suffolk County, Massachusetts Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Lawyers from Boston ",
