    "text": "The Battle of Kanakarayankulam was fought on 4 December 1997, during the Sri Lankan civil war between the Sri Lanka Armed Forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). It is known as the \"worst-ever commando debacle\" in Sri Lankan military history. ==Initial operations== This battle was a part of operation Jayasikurui a Sri Lankan military offensive during the Eelam war III. It commenced on 13 May 1997 in order to open a land route to the government-held Jaffna peninsula through Vanni territory held by the LTTE, by linking the government-held towns of Vavuniya and Kilinochchi. Despite heavy resistance, Sri Lankan military, led by elite 53rd division, managed to capture the Puliyankulam town on 15 November 1997. ==Events of December 4, 1997== Meanwhile, intelligence reports indicated a LTTE build up near Mankulam (north of Puliyankulam), and reconnaissance by UAV detected three fortified LTTE bases with supporting artillery and mortar positions. On 4 December 1997, elements of Sinha regiment and commando regiment attached to 53rd division, advanced in two columns from Puthur (north west of Puliyankulam). They advanced towards Mankulam and Kankarayankulam in a pincer movement and met with little resistance. However they soon ran into an ambush laid by the Siruthai brigade (Leopard brigade), an elite child brigade of the LTTE. The LTTE bases were dummy ones and the commandos of 2nd commando regiment who were tasked to neutralize the artillery position was surrounded and overwhelmed. Sri Lankan army losses included the commanding officer of the commando unit, major Nilantha Lakmal Sirimanne. Captain G. S. Jayanath of 2nd commando regiment, posthumously received the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya, the country's highest military award for gallantry, for his actions during the battle. ==References== ==External links== * Worst-ever commando debacle, by Iqbal Athas Category:1997 in Sri Lanka Kanakarayankulam 1997 Kanakarayankulam 1997 Category:December 1997 events in Asia ",
