    "text": "Spheres () is a South Korean animated television series. It is a product of the major broadcaster Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, and the animation was done by Studio Kaab, which would later animate the series Nalong. ==Story== Unbeknownst to human history, the Kingdom of Spheres existed upon our earth long ago. The people of this kingdom would be regarded today as people with psychic powers. Unfortunately, like most other civilizations, as the gap widened more and more between the social classes, the Kingdom of Spheres was troubled by those greedy for power; and in the end it collapsed. Na Yeon is a mysterious girl who was found in the Antarctic after the destruction of Spheres. One day Asten, the chairman of Sphere Union, who has a burning ambition to control the world, sent his followers to keep watch on Na Yeon. Na Yeon and her friends try to keep three artifacts, the keys to conquer the world, from the hands of Sphere Union. In the Italian opening, Santo Verduci composed for TV show Contactoons. ==Characters== ;Han Na Yeon (\ud55c\ub098\uc5f0) : :She is the main character of the story. She lives in a small village with her parents when she discovers her special talents. She believes that everything is possible to those who possess enough hope and faith. She uses Sphere Phoenix, which only she can control as she is the only remaining member of Ancient Spheres. ;Principal An Il Hwan (\uc548\uc77c\ud658 \uad50\uc7a5\uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8) : :The grandfather of Na Yeon, he is very gentle and never yells at children. He is very interested in the origin of Spheres. He built a school for geniuses on the site of the ancient Spheres kingdom, and in this school, he created a club called \"New Spheres\" in which only Sphere users can participate. He trains young Sphere users in this club. He believes that children have infinite possibilities. ;Lee Ho Joon (\uc774\ud638\uc900) : :He is a member of New Spheres. Both of his parents possess Spheres and he has the ambition to become the best of all the Spheres. He has the ability to use many types of power but his weak point is that he is not particularly skilled at any of them. He uses Sphere Storm, which reflects his personality clearly. ;Jin (\uc9c4) : :He is Asten's only son and a student at An Il Hwan's school. He works as a singer with Tilla as part of Sphere Union's plan. He meets Na Yeon while searching for the kid who the headmaster (An Il Hwan) took away. Jin looks more mature than most kids of his age and is the idol of every girl at the school. He is a polite man with a cold personality. He wears a tiger mask when he is on a mission for his father, in order to keep his cover as a spy. Later in the series, he abandons the Sphere Union. He uses Sphere Thunder, which is empowered by human technology. ;Nalong (\ub098\ub871\uc774) : :He is a baby flying squirrel whose wings are not big enough to make him fly. He likes taking naps and eating chocolate balls. It seems that he can communicate with Na Yeon. ;Gong Ju (\uacf5\uc8fc) : :Tiosnia Uconio Visaer Princess. She claims to be the princess of Papaoh Kingdom, but nobody believes her. She uses Sphere Flower, which can detect dangers. (Note: \"Gongju\" is the Korean word for princess.) ;Ria (\ub9ac\uc544) : :She is the unofficial leader of New Spheres. She's taller than most people of her age. She was born in Canada but she had to move to Korea after causing an accident because of her uncontrollable powers. Although she cannot control her powers, she is quite clever and for this reason prefers to use her mind and her computer instead of her uncontrollable powers. She is also a game maniac. She uses Sphere Power Brain, which has the ability to find the weaknesses of an enemy. ;Yoo Seo Dong (\uc720\uc11c\ub3d9) : :He is a member of New Spheres. He used to make predictions for the monks in a mountain temple until the abbot threw him out. He later realizes that predicting the future is dangerous. He uses Sphere Wind, which acts as a compass. ;Tilla (\ud2f8\ub77c) : :Tilla is a female humanoid robot whose energy source is water. She existed before Jin was born. The relationship between Tilla and Jin is complex because she acts both as his mother and his female companion. Jin's attention towards Na Yeon makes her jealous. ;Asten (\uc544\uc2a4\ud150) : :The father of Jin, he collected the Sphere users from all over the world and made an entertainment company called \"Sphere Union\" to aid in his efforts to take over the world. ;Teacher Joo Ah Ra (\uc8fc\uc544\ub77c \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8) : :She respects the headmaster who raised her. As his student, she is very skillful. She is founder of the New Spheres club and is also a self-described career advisor. Although she is an adult, she is very innocent and has a foolish side. She is a kind person who uses honorifics when addressing children. ;Teacher Rhee Tae Baek (\uc774\ud0dc\ubc31 \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8) : ;King Kong (\ud0b9\ucf69) : ;Na Yeon's Mother (\ub098\uc5f0 \uc5c4\ub9c8) : ;Na Yeon's Father (\ub098\uc5f0 \uc544\ube60) : ;Tang Kong (\ub545\ucf69) : ==Production staff== *Director: Byeon Yeong Kyoo *Scenario: Kim Eun Ji, Studio Kaab *Continuity: Byeon Yeong Kyoo, Kooji Aritomi, Katsuyuki Kodera, Kenichi Kawamura, Seo Seong Jong, Yoo Jae Woon, Rhee Choong Bok, Kim Keum Soo *Character Design: Byeon Yeong Kyoo, Kim Keum Soo *Art Consultants: Yeon Yeong Kyoo, Bak Hyo Jin, Bak Jong Min *Art Board: Han Moon Joong, Kang Seung Chan *Art Production Director: Kim Keum Soo *Art Director: Han Moon Joong *Scenario: Namoo Production *Color Settings: Byeon Yeong Kyoo, Ko Il Joon, Kim Dae Hyeon *Animation Checker: Lim Jong Yeol *Animation: Monster Production *Digital Color: Hanho Animation *Digital Scan: DNA Production, Abram Enterprise *Editing Output: Kim Yeong Ho *Sound Director: Rhee In Kyoo *Sound Assistant Director: Ko Kwang Hyeon *Sound Effects: Live tone, Poly Sound *Music Director: Kim Jun Seok *Music Recording: MNFC *Dubbing: Jo Jeong Ran *Producer: An Seong Eun, Kim Mi Ryeong, Cheon Chae Jeong *Executive Producer: Kim Sin Hwa ==See also== *Manhwa *Culture of South Korea ==External links== *Spheres Homepage *Studio Kaab Homepage *Anime Click - Spheres Images \"Aqua Luna\" Blog * http://ph.kidscotv.tv/programme.aspx?ID=302671 Category:South Korean animation ",
