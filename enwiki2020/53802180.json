    "text": "Jonathan 'Jono' Phillips (born 14 July 1982, Cardiff, Wales) is a British ice hockey forward for the Sheffield Steelers of the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL). ==Career== Phillips played both football and ice hockey growing up, however by the age of 11 he fully committed to ice hockey. He caught the attention of Cardiff Devils's coach Paul Heavey while playing for Great Britain's Under 18 and Under 20 International team, and was named to his squad for 1999-00 season. He spent three seasons with the Devils in the Elite Ice Hockey League before joining the Sheffield Steelers under coach Dave Matsos. In his first season with the Steelers, he was named an alternate captain before being promoted to captain midway through the season after Shawn Maltby was injured. During his first three seasons, Phillips led the team to two Playoff Championships and League title. In September 2011, Phillips underwent surgery to repair damaged knee ligaments. During the 2013\u201314 season, Phillips lost his captaincy to Stephen Goertzen but it was returned the following season. In April 2017, Phillips helped lead the Steelers to two milestones. He became the most-capped Sheffield Steelers player in history and also helped the team become the second in UK history to record ten playoff wins. After re- signing with the team, he set another milestone by becoming the first EIHL player to reach 1000 game played. Phillips has also captained the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team. ==Personal life== Phillips met his wife Kirsty in 2000 and they married in 2012. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:Welsh ice hockey forwards Category:Sheffield Steelers players Category:1982 births Category:Cardiff Devils players ",
