The original hotel structure designed by Kenzo Tange, was scheduled for closure at the end of March 2011, due to outdated building facilities and modifications in Tokyo building codes. In the wake of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami the hotel remained open and served as a temporary housing facility for evacuees from coastal regions of Fukushima Prefecture. ==Buildings== ===Office and hotel tower=== Tokyo Garden Terrace main tower provides 110,000 meters of office space and 28,700 meters of hotel accommodation in a 180m, 36-floor high-rise building. The Prince Gallery Kioich\u014d, the hotel component, opened in July 2016. The hotel is located on floors 30 to 36 of the main tower and operated by Seibu Holdings in partnership with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide as a part of Starwood's Luxury Collection of hotel properties. ===Residential tower=== A separate residential tower provides 22,700 meters of accommodation in a 90m, 21-floor high-rise tower. ===Kitashirakawa Palace=== The Kitashirakawa Palace has been refurbished as a banquet facility, known as Akasaka Prince Classic House.
