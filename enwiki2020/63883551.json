    "text": "Xenopus egg extract is a lysate that is prepared by crushing the eggs of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. It offers a powerful cell-free (or in vitro) system for studying various cell biological processes, including cell cycle progression, nuclear transport, DNA replication and chromosome segregation. It is also called Xenopus egg cell-free system or Xenopus egg cell-free extract. ==History== The first frog egg extract was reported in 1983 by Lohka and Masui. This pioneering work used eggs of the Northern leopard frog Rana pipiens to prepare an extract. Later, the same procedure was applied to eggs of Xenopus laevis, becoming popular for studying cell cycle progression and cell cycle-dependent cellular events. Extracts derived from eggs of the Japanese common toad Bufo japonicus or of the Western clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis have also been reported. ==Basics of extract preparation== The cell cycle of unfertilized eggs of X. laevis is arrested highly synchronously at metaphase of meiosis II. Upon fertilization, the metaphase arrest is released by the action of Ca2+ ions released from the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby initiating early embryonic cell cycles that alternates S phase (DNA replication) and M phase (mitosis). ===M phase extract=== Figure 1. An egg extract is prepared by crushing X. laevis eggs by centrifugation Unfertilized eggs in a buffer containing the Ca2+ chelator EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) are packed into a centrifuge tube. After removing excess buffer, the eggs are crushed by centrifugation (~10,000 g). A soluble fraction that appears between the lipid cap and the yolk is called an M phase extract. This extract contains a high level of cyclin B-Cdk1. When demembranated sperm nuclei are incubated with this extract, it undergoes a series of structural changes and is eventually converted into a set of M phase chromosomes with bipolar spindles. ===Interphase (S phase) extract=== ==Different types of egg extracts== ===Cycling extract=== Figure 2.
