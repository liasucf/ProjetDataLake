    "text": "The Rt. Hon. Walter MacMurrough Kavanagh, PC (14 January 1856 \u2013 18 July 1922), was a Member of Parliament (MP) who represented Carlow County from 1908 to 1910. He was the son of Arthur MacMurrough Kavanagh who also served as MP for Carlow. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He went on to hold a commission in the 5th Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles before leaving the Army to concentrate on the management of his estate at Borris. He was appointed High Sheriff of Carlow in 1884 and High Sheriff of Wexford in 1893. His candidature for the by-election, caused by the death of John Hammond, was endorsed by Dr Patrick Foley, Lord Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin (and former President of Carlow College), due to Kavanagh's support for a Catholic University of Ireland. He served as Chairman of Carlow County Council 1907 - 1918 but was replaced as Chairman because of his support for Irish conscription. Kavanagh had been a member of the Reform Association who advocated a limited devolution for Ireland. He supported the more independent Nationalist Party and Home Rule. He married Helen Louisa Howard, daughter of Colonel John Stanley Howard, on 1 February 1887 and had two sons, the elder of whom was an officer in the Army. He died on 18 July 1922 and is buried in Ballicopagan Cemetery. ==References== Members and Messengers - Carlow's 20th century parliamentarians by John O'Donovan == External links == * Category:1856 births Category:1922 deaths Category:High Sheriffs of Carlow Category:High Sheriffs of Wexford Category:UK MPs 1906\u20131910 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Carlow constituencies (1801\u20131922) Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:Members of the Senate of Southern Ireland Category:People educated at Eton College ",
