It was released in September 1984 as MCA 5512 and was produced by noted country music producer Jimmy Bowen and represented a concerted shift toward a more country sound by Buffett. He appeared on the album's cover in typical country singer garb and promoted the album at Fan Fair country music festival in Nashville, Tennessee. The album was originally to have been titled Gulf and Western MusicRiddles in the Sand at BuffettWorld.comGary Graff. \"Buffett determined to outlast music trends.\" The Ledger. p. 17. July 9, 1984. \"...'Gulf and Western,' the album Buffett just finished recording in Nashville that's due for a September release.\" reflecting the fusion of musical styles seen in much of Buffett's music often called gulf and western music. In the album's liner notes, Jim Harrison says, \"This album has a musical range expanding in an arc from Bob Wills to Bob Marley with the Gulf somehow always there.\"Riddles in the Sand liner notes at BuffettRemasters.com ==Songs== The album is the first of Buffett's not to contain a song written solely by him; he co-wrote all of the songs with Will Jennings and Michael Utley (one also with Josh Leo) except for a song by Mac McAnally and one by Rhonda Coullet.
