    "text": "Avalanche is a bobsled roller coaster located at Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia. Manufactured by Mack Rides, Avalanche opened to the public in 1988. It is located in the Safari Village section of the park. There are seven cars per train and the various cars are themed after Olympic bobsleds that represent five countries. The countries include France, the United States, Germany, Switzerland and Canada. Each car has its country specific Winter Olympic decals. ==Features== Avalanche features chutes or half pipes without any fixed tracks like most other roller coasters. Having no tracks allows the bobsled cars to move freely as if they are sliding on the ice as a real bobsled would. ==Cars== Each car in Avalanche seats two riders. One rider sits in between the legs of the first rider. It is a very close fit between the two straddling riders. Many people ride alone because it is such a tight squeeze. ==References== ==External links== *Official Avalanche page Category:Roller coasters in Virginia Category:Roller coasters introduced in 1988 Category:Kings Dominion Category:Roller coasters operated by Cedar Fair ",
