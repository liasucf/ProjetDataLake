Along with Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth (1931), it was the most influential book on Western understanding of China as well as the most influential book on Western sympathy for Red China in the 1930s.Harold Isaacs, Scratches on Our Minds, (New York: John Day, 1958; rpr. White Plains, 1989): 155 n. 71, 162-163. == Overview == In Red Star Over China, Edgar Snow recounts the months that he spent with the Chinese Red Army in 1936. Most of this time, he was at their then-capital Bao'an (Pao An). They moved to the famous Yan'an only after he left. Snow uses his extensive interviews with Mao and the other top leaders to present vivid descriptions of the Long March, as well as biographical accounts of leaders on both sides of the conflicts, including Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao, He Long, and Mao Zedong's own account of his life. When Snow wrote, there were no reliable reports reaching the West about what was going on in the Communist-controlled areas. Other writers, such as Agnes Smedley, had written in some detail about the Chinese Communists before the Long March, but none of these writers had ever visited them or even conducted first hand interviews with them. Snow's status as an international journalist not previously identified with the communist movement gave his reports the stamp of authenticity. The glowing pictures of life in the communist areas contrasted with the gloom and corruption of the Kuomintang government. Many Chinese learned about Mao and the communist movement from the almost immediate translations of Mao's autobiography, and readers in North America and Europe, especially those with liberal views, were heartened to learn of a movement which they interpreted as being anti-fascist and progressive. Snow reported the new Second United Front which Mao said would leave violent class struggle behind. Although Snow made it clear that Mao's ultimate aim was control of China, many readers got the impression that the Chinese communists were \"agrarian reformers.\" Kenneth E. Shewmaker, \"The \"Agrarian Reformer\" Myth,\" The China Quarterly 34 (1968): 66-81. Snow's Preface to the revised edition in 1968 describes the book's original context: > The Western powers, in self-interest, were hoping for a miracle in China. > They dreamed of a new birth of nationalism that would keep Japan so bogged > down that she would never be able to turn upon the Western colonies\u2014her true > objective. Red Star Over China tended to show that the Chinese Communists > could indeed provide that nationalist leadership needed for effective anti- > Japanese resistance. How dramatically the United States' policy-making > attitudes have altered since then [...] It provided not only for non-Chinese > readers, but also for the entire Chinese people\u2014including all but the > Communist leaders themselves\u2014the first authentic account of the Chinese > Communist Party and the first connected story of their long struggle to > carry through the most thoroughgoing social revolution in China's three > millenniums of history. Many editions were published in China ...Red Star > Over China, Preface to the Revised Edition 1968 .) == Publishing history == Snow was not available to read proofs of the initial London and New York editions, but he revised the text of the 1939 and 1944 editions. The Publisher's Note of the 1939 edition explains that Snow added a \"substantial new section\" of six chapters bringing the narrative up to July 1938 as well as \"many textual changes.\" Snow made the textual changes partly to polish but he also responded to friends and reviewers. Some of them felt Snow's account of party history had been too critical of Soviet policy, and others felt that he had given too much credit to Mao for independent Chinese strategies. Snow toned down but did not remove the implicit criticisms of Stalin.Snow's revisions are listed in Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes K. M. Anderson, The Soviet World of American Communism (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998) pp. 347-341. The 1944 edition was allowed to go out of print in the 1950s, but Snow made substantial revisions and annotations for the Grove Press reprint of 1968.S.B. Thomas devotes a chapter to the reception of the book in various quarters and these revisions. Ch 10 \"The Strange Life of a Classic,\" Season of High Adventure,pp. 169- 189.

Review in Foreign Affairs; Snow, White & Seven China Revolution Classics and it clearly played a role in swaying Western and Chinese opinion in favor of Mao. Indeed, Mao commented that the book \"had merit no less than Great Yu controlling the floods.\" According to Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Snow probably believed what he was told to be true, and much of it is still of basic significance, especially the \"Autobiography of Mao\". They also wrote that Mao omitted key elements from his accounts of party history and Snow missed others.Jung, Chang; Halliday, Jon, 2006. Mao: The Unknown Story. Random House, London. , p. 192 According to Anne-Marie Brady, Snow submitted the transcripts of his interviews to be edited and approved by Party officials and changes in the American edition were made in response to the Communist Party of the United States. Snow\u2019s account of the Long March has been criticised by some while others have maintained that it is basically valid.Shuyun Sun, The Long March: The True Story of China's Founding Myth (New York: Doubleday, 2007). Andrew McEwen Ed Jocelyn, The Long March: The True Story Behind the Legendary Journey That Made Mao's China ([London]: Constable & Robinson, 2006). In his 1966 biography of Mao, the American Sinologist Stuart R. Schram wrote that Red Star Over China was irreplaceable in learning about Mao's early yearsSchram 1966. p. 10. and that despite \"many errors of detail\", it remains \"by far the most important single source regarding his life\" and offered important insights into \"Mao's own vision of his past\".Schram 1966. p. 19. == See also == * Anna Louise Strong * Dwarkanath Kotnis * Jack Belden * Norman Bethune * Rewi Alley *Helen Foster Snow == Footnotes == == References== * * * == External links == * * Behind Red Star over China (2006 account from China Daily) * There has also been a Chinese screen adaptation , which was however rejected by Edgar Snow's widow . * Georgi Dimitrov and the Chinese Revolution Category:1937 non-fiction books Category:20th-century history books Category:American biographies Category:Books about China Category:Books about communism Category:Books about Mao Zedong Category:History books about China Category:History books about communism ",
