    "text": "Bowenia serrulata, the Byfield fern, is a cycad in the family Stangeriaceae. Its bipinnate fronds, arising from a subterranean caudex, give it the appearance of a fern. However it is not a fern as its vernacular name and appearance suggest. It is endemic to the vicinity of Byfield, Australia. ==Gallery== Image:Bowenia serrulata 1.JPG|Bowenia serrulata growing in transition forest near Byfield, in the Capricornia region of Queensland, Australia Image:Bowenia serrulata 2.JPG|Bowenia serrulata growing in transition forest near Byfield, in the Capricornia region of Queensland, Australia Image:Bowenia serrulata 3.JPG|Bowenia serrulata growing in transition forest near Byfield, in the Capricornia region of Queensland, Australia Image:Bowenia serrulata 4.JPG|Pinnae of Bowenia serrulata Image:Bowenia serrulata 5.JPG|Bowenia serrulata growing in transition forest near Byfield, in the Capricornia region of Queensland, Australia Image:Bowenia serrulata 6.JPG|Bowenia serrulata growing in transition forest near Byfield, in the Capricornia region of Queensland, Australia ==References== serrulata Category:Endemic flora of Australia Category:Cycadophyta of Australia Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Least concern flora of Australia Category:Least concern biota of Queensland Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
