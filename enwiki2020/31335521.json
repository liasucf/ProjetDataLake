Guill, \"the only battle of note that occurred near the Azores during this period took place 14 October 1918 between the German U-139 and Portugal's ships S\u00e3o Miguel and Augusto Castilho.\", page 507. ==Background== On the island of Madeira, the Portuguese patrol boat under the command of the First Lieutenant Carvalho Ara\u00fajo received the mission of escorting the Portuguese civilian steamer S\u00e3o Miguel, which was property of the Empresa Insulana de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o and was sailing from the Port of Funchal in Madeira to the port of Ponta Delgada on the Azores archipelago, with 206 passengers and several tons of cargo on board.Atl\u00e2ntico Norte (14 de Outubro de 1918) NRP Augusto de Castilho, originally the fishing trawler Elite, built in 1909, had been requisitioned by the Portuguese government and transferred to the service of the Portuguese Navy which adapted it to serve as an escort ship following Portugal's entering into the war in 1916.Saturnino Monteiro, page 141. The ship was equipped with two small Hotchkiss cannon, one of 65 mm on the bow and another of 47 mm on the stern. == Action == After leaving Funchal at sunset on 13 October, S\u00e3o Miguel came under fire at 06:15 AM on 14 October from the German submarine U-139, one of the more and better equipped submarines of the Imperial German Navy, armed with two powerful 150 mm cannon and six torpedo tubes, and under the command of Lothar von Arnauld de la Peri\u00e8re. In order to protect S\u00e3o Miguel, and after using all the smoke boxes available for creating a smoke curtain while repeatedly firing the stern cannon, de Ara\u00fajo gave orders for NRP Augusto de Castilho to turn to port, describing half a circle, and advance towards the German U-139, taking gunfire from the submarine, thus giving S\u00e3o Miguel time to escape at full speed. After two hours of fierce but one-sided fighting,Jo\u00e3o Medina, Aniceto Afonso, page 127. and with several fatal casualties on deck, the guns damaged, without ammunition, and having lost the telegraph and the ship's engine, the Portuguese ship surrendered by lowering the national flag and raising a white flag. However, the German submarine continued firing, hitting the patrol ship with a direct shot which killed Ara\u00fajo and injured Midshipman Armando Ferraz for a second time. After receiving orders from the Midshipman to abandon ship, the Portuguese survivors were able to enter in two life boats. The ship was then boarded and sunk by the Germans with explosive charges. ==Aftermath== One of the life boats arrived at the island of Santa Maria Island after 48 hours with 29 of the survivors, with one of the injured sailors having died during their journey. The other life boat, with 12 survivors onboard arrived at the island of S\u00e3o Miguel Island, on 17 October. The action was U-139s last and as a few weeks later the submarine surrendered to France on 24 November 1918.http://www.uboat.net ==See also== *History of Portugal *Portuguese First Republic *Battle of the Lys (1918) *Portuguese Expeditionary Corps ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== *Saturnino Monteiro, Batalhas e combates da Marinha Portuguesa: 1808\u20131975 (1997). *Jo\u00e3o Medina, Aniceto Afonso, Hist\u00f3ria contempor\u00e2nea de Portugal: Primeira Rep\u00fablica (2 v.)
