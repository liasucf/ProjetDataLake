    "text": "Lesley Sanderson is a Malaysian British artist. She was born in Malaysia in 1962, to a Malaysian mother and British father. She graduated from Sheffield Polytechnic with a BA in Fine Art in 1984. Her early works explored her own identity and mixed heritage using self portraits. In 1988, she participated in an exhibition titled Along the Lines of Resistance: an exhibition of contemporary feminist art, at the Cooper Gallery, Barnsley. In this exhibition Sanderson states that she uses the self-portrait to address racist and gender stereotypes. Since 1998, she has been collaborating with Neil Conroy as Conroy Sanderson. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1962 births Category:Artists from Sheffield Category:British contemporary artists Category:Alumni of Sheffield Hallam University ",
