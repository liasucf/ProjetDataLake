The premise of Valbray's collection was to incorporate an element into the dial of a watch that was similar to the shutter of a camera. Valbray invented and designed the mechanism over two years and called it the \"Oculus\". The Oculus dial comprises 16 single blades 0.05 mm in height that changes the look of the dial by covering and uncovering it. It is manually opened and closed by rotating the watch's bezel. It was patented in 2010,Valbray dial patent dial the same year that the Valbray brand first exhibited four prototypes at the Baselworld watch fair.

The bezel on the Valbray EL 1 Chrono was developed to mimic the look and feel of adjusting the focal distance on the lens of a Leica using Valbray's own Oculus diaphragm, which comprises 16 single blades and acts as a cover for the dial.The Valbray EL1 \"100 Years Of Leica Photography Edition\" (Details & Pricing) It is opened and closed by turning the rotating bezel found on the 46 mm titanium case. The time display is readable whether the Oculus is opened or closed, while the chronograph displays are hidden by it when it is closed. The flange and dial also imitate a Leica lens using font and stylistic elements, while the color scheme utilizes Leica's corporate colors, and the date (at 3 o\u2019clock), chronograph minute counter (at 12 o\u2019clock) and chronograph hour counter (at 6 o\u2019clock) recall the layout of the setting controls on a Leica. The running seconds at 9 o\u2019clock recreate the camera's isometrics button. The stylistic element \"4.5\" located at 4:30 on the dial (visible only when the Oculus is open) is reminiscent of the aperture of the first Leica camera from 1914. The sapphire crystal on the case back is smoked, an element designed to symbolize the dark room in which early photographs were developed. The crown is embossed with the Leica logo. EL 1 Chrono was limited to 100 pieces: 50 in a titanium case and 50 with a black DLC (diamond-like carbon) finish. == References == == External links == * * YouTube channel * Facebook Category:Watch brands Category:Luxury brands Category:Watch manufacturing companies of Switzerland Category:Clothing companies established in 2004 ",
