In mid-June 2020, Lordstown presented the first official sketches showing the appearance of the Endurance passenger compartment, while the world premiere of the pickup took place on June 25 of the same year. ==Sale== Production of the Endurance will take place at Lordstown Motors' manufacturing facilities in the village of the same name in the U.S. state of Ohio, where the General Motors factory was once located. Originally, production was to start in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was decided to be postponed to 2021. ==Technical data== The Endurance is a four-wheel drive vehicle developing 602 HP.
