It originally only admitted men in the fields of Engineering and Architecture, which restricted its expansion, but it admitted all men after its expansion to University of Cincinnati. It became a Junior member of the National Interfraternity Conference in 1930. The membership as of 1945 was 1000. It merged with Alpha Epsilon Pi in March 1947. ==Chapter List== The chapters of Sigma Tau Phi were: *Alpha - University of Pennsylvania - 1918 (Some sources say April 1917) *Beta - University of Cincinnati - 1920 *Gamma - Pennsylvania State University - 1921 *Delta - University of Delaware - 1925 *Epsilon - Dickinson University - 1926 *Zeta - Temple University - 1927 *Eta - New York University - 1929 ==Merger with Alpha Epsilon Pi== On March 22, 1947 the Alpha chapter was merged with Gamma chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi. The Beta chapter became Omicron Deuteron of AEPi, the Gamma Colony became Pi Deuteron at chartering, the Delta chapter became Rho Deuteron. Of the remaining chapters, AEPi agreed to make efforts to reactivate the chapters at Dickinson and Temple but not the one at NYU as there was an active AEPi group there at the time. Alpha Pi chapter of AEPi established at Temple University in 1956 is considered to be a reactivation of Zeta chapter. In addition, the Sigma Tau Phi Alumni Clubs in Wilmington, Delaware and Cincinnati Ohio were granted charters with Alpha Epsilon Pi. ==Symbols== *Periodical - The Record (Annual in December prior to convention) *Periodical - The News-Dispatch (Quarterly) *Periodical - Directory (Biannually) *Badge - Black Enamel with the Greek Letters \u03a3 \u03a4 \u03a6 in pearls *Pledge button - Circular with a gold hollow triangle on a Blue Background *Colors - Blue and Gold ==References== Category:Defunct former members of the North American Interfraternity Conference Category:Alpha Epsilon Pi Category:Student organizations established in 1918 Category:1918 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Historically Jewish fraternities and sororities in the United States Category:Jewish organizations established in 1918 ",
