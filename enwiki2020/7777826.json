    "text": "The Roland SH-201 is a discontinued 49 key,http://www.roland.com/products/en/SH-201/ 10-voice polyphonic virtual analogue synthesizer introduced in 2006 by the Roland Corporation. The SH-201 was discontinued in 2010. At the NAMM 2010 show Roland introduced its successor, the Roland SH-01 Gaia. ==Features== The SH-201 is equipped with two analogue modeling oscillators (four when in Dual or Split mode), a multi-mode filter, ring modulator, and it allows routing an external audio signal into its own dedicated filter. Real-time controls feature 29 front panel knobs and sliders, assignable pitch/mod stick and Roland's infrared D-Beam controller. The synthesizer also acts as a USB audio interface for digital audio workstation recording. The modeling and layout of filters, envelopes, oscillator types, and mix options are similar to the JP-8000. Notable differences are that the SH-201 offers more polyphony, oscillator choices, LFO routings and comes with computer software for more in-depth sound editing, patch librarian storage and DAW integration. The name SH-201 is derived from Roland's classic SH line of analog synthesizers, all of which were designed to be portable and simple to program, while the number 201 was chosen to reference the popular SH-101 which was also cased in plastic. It is also fully Windows and Mac compatible, connecting through a USB cable. MIDI and audio can be sent through the USB port.http://www.roland.com/products/en/SH-201/ ==Notable users== * Hadouken! * Abandon All Ships * Bozon Higgs * Calvin Harris (notable for the main synth hook in \"I'm Not Alone\") * Disclosure * Scissor Sisters * Richard Barbieri * Noisia * Front 242 * The Neon Judgement * Suicide Commando * Insect Graveyard * Marcus Brown (Madonna) * Printz Board * Scooter (Just on stage) * JMR * Joker * Jean Michel JarreT\u00e9o & T\u00e9a CD booklet * Ladytron * Asia (band) * Geoff Downes * Milk Inc. * Timbaland * Jamie Cullum * Kaiser Chiefs * Walk the Moon * Grimes * Alan Walker (used for live performances) == References == ==Further reading== * ==External links== * SH-201 details - VintageSynth.com * Roland US - official site * Musicradar review * EMusician review SH-201 Category:D-Beam Category:Virtual analog synthesizers Category:Polyphonic synthesizers Category:Digital synthesizers ",
