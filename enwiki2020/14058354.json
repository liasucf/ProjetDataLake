The same paternalism dogged the sequel, William at the Circus\"; while Sky Movies wrote, \"it's a lively romp with a jolly knockabout climax in a house that William and his gang of `outlaws' are trying to haunt.\"http://skymovies.sky.com/just-williams-luck/review ==Bibliography== * Collins, Fiona & Ridgman, Jeremy.
