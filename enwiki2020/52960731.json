He later became a lawyer. Harbinger was kidnapped twice, once in Mexico and again in Serbia. He ran a tour company that took westerners to North Korea via China and has spent significant time in the country. Tours were supervised from beginning to end by North Korean minders and tour guides. In 2007 Harbinger worked on mortgage-backed securities for a Wall Street firm and was laid off after around a year due to the 2007 financial crisis. == Media career == While he was in law school, Harbinger started coaching other people how to date and network. He and co-host AJ Harbinger (who uses Jordan Harbinger's last name as a pseudonym) started The PickUp Podcast. When Harbinger graduated in 2006, he moved to New York. Around that time he formed a company called \"The Art of Charm\" to turn his coaching into a business. By that time his podcast had gained traction, and he started focusing full-time on the coaching business. In 2010 an app was launched, and by 2011 Harbinger had a radio talk show called \"Game On\" on both Sirius and XM Satellite that aired on Friday nights. The show was the first-ever podcast carried on satellite radio. By 2011, Harbinger had relocated to Los Angeles. By that time the company offered week-long \"boot camps\", and offered other options like coaching over the phone. In 2013 Harbinger demonstrated at DEF CON how easily a person can be manipulated into divulging information to someone who may not be what they claim to be, based on the Robin Sage experiment of 2010. By 2015, Harbinger was rebranding himself more as a more general self-help personality and was profiling celebrities in the podcasts. In early 2018, Harbinger split from his former partners, left The Art of Charm podcast, and started a new podcast under his own name. That new show,The Jordan Harbinger Show, was listed by Apple as one of the most downloaded new shows of 2018 and brings in multiple seven figures in revenue each year.Hill, Brad.
