    "text": "Castle is an American crime-comedy-drama television series, which aired on ABC for a total of eight seasons from March 9, 2009, to May 16, 2016. The series was produced jointly by Beacon Pictures and ABC Studios. Created by Andrew W. Marlowe, it primarily traces the lives of Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion), a best-selling mystery novelist, and Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), a homicide detective, as they solve various unusual crimes in New York City. Detective Beckett is initially infuriated at the thought of working with a writer and goes to great lengths to keep him out of her way. However, the two soon start developing feelings for each other. The overarching plot of the series focused on the romance between the two lead characters and their ongoing investigation of the murder of Beckett's mother. On May 12, 2016, it was announced that despite some cast members signing one-year contracts for a potential ninth season, the show was canceled. ==Premise== Richard Castle (Fillion) is a famous mystery novelist. Bored and suffering from writer's block, he kills off Derek Storm, the main character in his successful book series. He is brought in by the New York Police Department for questioning regarding a copycat murder based on one of his novels. He is intrigued by Kate Beckett (Katic), the detective assigned to the case. Castle is inspired to take Beckett as his muse for Nikki Heat, the main character of his next book series and uses his friendship with the mayor to force the police to let him shadow Beckett. Castle's exuberant man child personality clashes with Beckett's more reserved and professional demeanor. However, as Beckett begins to appreciate Castle's assistance in helping her catch killers, the two eventually become friends and then lovers. Their cases often deal with murders occurring within various unusual subcultures or milieus, including reality TV shows, vampire enthusiasts, a science fiction convention, and a man who claims to be a time traveler. A recurring plot line deals with the unsolved murder of Beckett's mother years before, an investigation which leads to an increasingly sprawling, and dangerous, conspiracy. The series also gives a just amount of screentime to the backstories of supporting characters like Javier Esposito, Kevin Ryan, Lanie Parish, Captain Roy Montgomery and Captain Gates, through multiple episodes. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Nathan Fillion as Richard Castle, born Richard Alexander Rodgers, a best-selling mystery writer, who shadows and assists the NYPD.

He is raising his daughter by himself, and his mother rents a room in his loft. * Stana Katic as Katherine \"Kate\" Beckett, an NYPD homicide detective and later, captain. Beckett is a daughter of Jim and Johanna Beckett. She was raised in Manhattan. She was inspired to be a detective, because of her mother\u2019s murder. She works with fellow detectives Javier Esposito and Kevin Ryan, and medical examiner Lanie Parish, who is her best friend. In the beginning Beckett's relationship with Castle was strained, but after a while Kate and Richard start to understand each other. * Jon Huertas as Detective Javier \"Javi\" Esposito, a former Army Special Forces soldier who now works in the homicide division as part of Beckett's team. * Seamus Dever as Detective Kevin Ryan, a former narcotics detective who works as part of Beckett's team.

He later works as a computer analyst for the NYPD. * Kristoffer Polaha as Caleb Brown, an idealistic public defender found to have links to the LokSat conspiracy. Real- life writers Stephen J. Cannell, James Patterson, Dennis Lehane, and Michael Connelly appear as themselves during periodic games of poker at Castle's apartment. Typically, they discuss Castle and Beckett's current case and tease Castle about his involvement with Beckett. Following Cannell's death on September 30, 2010, an empty chair was kept at the poker table for a year in his honor. ==Broadcast history== Castle premiered as a midseason replacement on ABC on March 9, 2009.
