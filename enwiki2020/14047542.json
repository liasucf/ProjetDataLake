    "text": "Seawitch is a novel written by the Scottish author Alistair MacLean. It was first released in the United Kingdom by Collins in 1977 and later in the same year by Doubleday in the United States. It was written in Mexico, where MacLean would not be taxed by US authorities. The book deviates from MacLean's usual mystery/drama formula in that it is almost all action, with no mystery and no \"traitor amongst them\" sub-plot. The New York Times review said MacLean \"stumbles badly\". The book was a best seller. ==Plot introduction== Lord Worth, ruthless and fabulously wealthy, has made a lot of enemies in the oil business. His new offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, named Seawitch, is one of the biggest in the world, and will put his competitors out of business. To destroy it and therefore be able to inflate the price of oil at will, the competitors get together and send one man to deal with Lord Worth. The villain has a personal score to settle with Worth and kidnaps him and his daughters. But Lord Worth's daughters are betrothed to the protagonists, Mitchell and Roomer, two former police detectives, now private investigators. They set trying to save Worth and his daughters from certain death, as the villain intends to leave them on Seawitch when he destroys it with a stolen nuclear weapon. ==References== ==External links== * Book review at AlistairMacLean.com Category:1977 British novels Category:Novels by Alistair MacLean Category:William Collins, Sons books ",
