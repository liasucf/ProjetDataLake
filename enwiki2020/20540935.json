The association is one of the largest business representative organisations in Brussels, representing over 20 million companies through 45 members (43 national associations of chambers of commerce and industry and 2 transnational chamber organisations) and a European network of 1,700 regional and local Chambers. More than 93% of these businesses are small and medium sized enterprises. Eurochambres' direct members are national associations of Chambers of Commerce based in 26 European Union countries, European Free Trade Association countries, and some Eastern European, Western Balkans and Mediterranean countries. Eurochambres represents, serves and promotes European Chambers of Commerce and Industry through lobbying, development of projects and services to members. ==History== Eurochambres' network of Chambers of Commerce and IndustryEurochambres was founded 28 February 1958 as the \"Conf\u00e9rence Permanente des Chambres de Commerce et d\u2019Industrie de la CEE\" by six members with the mission to promote the views of Chamber organisations on the unification of national legislation at the European level and to form opinions regarding the modifications to be made to commercial legislation. An important objective of the Conf\u00e9rence was also to bring closer competences in order to provide an example of the European cooperation of the highest quality level. The Conf\u00e9rence Permanente held its first assembly in Strasbourg on 28 February 1958. Initial members were national association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Netherlands. The year 1961 saw the creation of the first technical committees and 4 new members joined. A permanent Secretariat was created in 1977 (before the various countries assumed the role in turns). Eurochambres, the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry was registered as an international non-profit organisation in Belgium (AISBL - Association internationale \u00e0 but non lucratif) in 1977. The network expanded progressively to 43 national associations plus 2 transnational organisations of Chambers from an enlarged Europe. In 2008, Eurochambres organised the first \"European Parliament of Enterprises\" that gathered some 774 European businesses of all sizes and from all sectors in the European Parliament hemicycle in Brussels. The opening session was led by Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering (President of the European Parliament), Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso (President of the European Commission), Herv\u00e9 Novelli (French Minister of State for Business, Trade, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, Tourism and Services) and Pierre Simon (then President of Eurochambres). Three sessions of debates and votes followed, each in the presence of a Member of the European Parliament and a European Commissioner. Further editions of the event were also organised in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016, in coordination with the European Parliament. ==Current leadership== Information from official website.Christoph Leitl, President of Eurochambres for 2018-2019 * Christoph Leitl (President of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber) - President.
