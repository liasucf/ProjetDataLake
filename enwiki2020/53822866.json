    "text": "\"Early, Early in the Spring\" (Roud 152, Laws M1) is a British folk song that has been collected from traditional singers in England, Scotland, Ireland, Canada and the United States. It tells the story of a sailor gone to sea whose beloved promises to wait for him. When he returns she has married a rich man and he goes back to sea with a broken heart and a bitter attitude. In a few American versions the betrayed lover is a cowboy.Roud Folk Song Index https://www.vwml.org/search?ts=1492593671935&collectionfilter;=RoudFS;RoudBS&advqtext;=0|rn|152#rec Retrieved 2017/04/19 Other names for this song include As I Was Walking Up London Street, I Was Forced on Board to Serve My King, The Sailor Deceived, Sweet William (or Willie), and The Disappointed Sailor, and cowboy variants are called Cowboy's Girl, Following the Cow Trail and The Trail to Mexico. ==Synopsis== A sailor goes on board ship (sometimes pressed) while his sweetheart pledges her undying love. > It was one morning in the spring, I went on board to serve the king.
