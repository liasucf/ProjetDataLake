    "text": "The True People's Party (), known as Prava\u0161i (Rightists), was a political party in the Principality of Montenegro and Kingdom of Montenegro, led by Lazar Miju\u0161kovi\u0107, which represented the government and rule of Prince, and later King Nikola of Montenegro. Notable party members were Jovan S. Plamenac, Marko \u0110ukanovi\u0107, Ivo \u0110urovi\u0107, Sekula Drljevi\u0107, Filip Jergovi\u0107, captain Krsto Popovi\u0107 and generals Mitar Martinovi\u0107 and Milutin Vu\u010dini\u0107. Montenegrin politics was divided on the issue of support to Nikola I and retaining the independence of Montenegro, and the unity of Montenegro and Serbia under the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty, as advocated by the opposition People's Party. ==History== The party was founded in 1907 by Prince Nikola I, as a result of the People's Party boycott on the elections as a mark of protest against bad relations of Montenegrin government with Serbia. The prava\u0161i supported Nikola's rule and proclaimed him the King in 1910. At the 1913 elections, both Montenegrin parties ran, and the People's Party defeated the True People's Party, winning most of the parliamentary seats. In the wake of the forthcoming Great War, part of True People's Party members rejoined the People's Party and the altered its program to include unification of Montenegro and Serbia. The party was officially dissolved in 1918 after the Podgorica Assembly and unification of the Montenegrin state with Serbia. ==Election results== {| class=wikitable !Election !Seats !Change !Control !Notes |- !1907 | | 76 | |Rightists + aligned independents |- !1911 | | 23 | |Rightists + aligned independents |- !1914 | | 47 | |Party dissolved in 1918 |} ==Sources== * * Category:Defunct political parties in Montenegro Category:1907 establishments in Montenegro Category:Kingdom of Montenegro Category:Political history of Montenegro Category:Montenegrin nationalism Category:Monarchist parties Category:Right-wing parties in Europe Category:Conservative parties in Montenegro ",
