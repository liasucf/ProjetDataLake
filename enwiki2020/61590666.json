On discovering one of his handlers, Montgomery, intends to let him and his family die in order to use their homicides as hard evidence to ensure convictions, Koslow must turn to Grens, a member of NYPD's Organized Crime Division to ensure his loved ones' safety as he looks for a way to escape when his cover eventually gets conveniently blown. ==Cast== * Joel Kinnaman as Pete Koslow * Rosamund Pike as Erica Wilcox * Clive Owen as Montgomery * Common as Edward Grens * Ana de Armas as Sofia Hoffman * Eugene Lipinski as Ryszard Klimek * Joanna Kaczy\u0144ska as Beata Klimek * Edwin de la Renta as Smiley Phelps * Sam Spruell as Slewitt * Aylam Orian as Andrzej Dziedzic * Karma Meyer as Anna Koslow * Mateusz Ko\u015bciukiewicz as Staszek Cusik * Peter Parker Mensah as Officer Franklin * Arturo Castro as Daniel Gomez * Abdul-Ahad Patel as Vermin ==Production== The film adaptation of Three Seconds was announced at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017.
