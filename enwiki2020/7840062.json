Otwock Heritage villa designed in \u015awidermajer style at the Warsaw Bia\u0142o\u0142\u0119ka on Fletniowa 2 Street \u015awidermajer () is a distinct Polish architectural style developed in late 19th and early 20th century in Masovia along the railroad linking Warsaw with Otwock. The style was applied almost exclusively to wooden villas of the middle classes. Developed by Micha\u0142 Elwiro Andriolli, the style combined traditional elements of local wooden architecture with the Swiss style popular after the world fair in Vienna of 1873 (wide roofs), Russian traditional houses of the common people (wooden porches with windows) and some elements of the decorative art from the Podhale region.Robert Lewandowski (2005), \u015awidermajer, jak budowano. Swidermajer.pl, Internet Archive. ==Origins== The name \u015awidermajer was a play on the words \"Biedermeier\" and \"\u015awider\", the latter being the name of both a river along which a number of villas were built and a village between Warsaw and Otwock considered the '\u015awidermajer capital'. As local neologism, the word was popularized by Konstanty Ildefons Ga\u0142czy\u0144ski in an epigram called \"Wycieczka do \u015awidra\".Robert Lewandowski, Strona o architekturze \u015bwidermajer.
