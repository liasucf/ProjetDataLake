His father was MP for Okehampton in Devon and had influential contacts which he used to secure his son George's appointment as Governor initially. These included: Peter King (Lord Chancellor), Arthur Onslow (Speaker of the House of Commons) and Sir William Yonge (MP for Honiton in Devon and Secretary for War). Robert Walpole and the Duke of Newcastle were later contacts who helped Burrington secure his second term as Governor of North Carolina. second term as governor.Minutes of North Carolina's Governor's Council, 3 April 1731, Volume 3, pp215-21 Burrington's first term as governor in 1724-25 had been marked by aggressive behaviour and quarrelling with his senior councillor who, along with other assembly members had complained to London and got him removed from post. Despite this, he secured a second term as governor through the patronage of the Duke of Newcastle and, during preparations to issue him instructions, Burrington had been asked to produce a list of 12 names to be his councillors but, when he only presented a list of 10, Martin Bladen inserted the names of William Smith (a London lawyer) and Nathaniel Rice (who was now Bladen's brother-in-law).Journal of the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations 1704-82, Volume 6, p136. William L. Saunders (ed); Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, Volume 3, pp85-86 (list of councillors) Bladen had a particular interest in North Carolina, his father-in-law John Gibbs having been governor 1689-90 and he also owned land there; Bladen was hostile to the re-appointment of Burrington and Burrington was hostile to the idea that Bladen's brother-in-law was now his senior councillor. ==Acting governor of North Carolina== Within a few months of Governor George Burrington being in post, most members of his administration and council complained of his behaviour and William Smith, the Chief Justice, resigned in protest and left for England to complain about the governor to Whitehall officials at the Board of Trade.Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, Volume 3, pp232-39 In Smith's absence, Nathaniel Rice was appointed President of the Council towards the end of 1731. By the following year Rice, the Attorney General and other members of the Council complained about the Governor's behaviour to the Duke of Newcastle.Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, Volume 3, pp331-334, 356-368 The complaints continued to flow in until finally Newcastle, in 1733,Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, Volume 3, pp437-38 announced that Burrington would be replaced by a new governor - who did not arrive in post until the following year. Burrington had to remain in post for many months until his replacement arrived and when Smith returned from England to an enthusiastic reception from the Council, Burrington felt threatened. He removed the seals of office from Nathaniel Rice to prevent him carrying out his duties and then dissolved the council. Meanwhile, on 15 April 1734, when Burrington was in South Carolina,Governor George Burrington by Marshall de Lancey (Raleigh: Edwards and Broughton, 1896) Nathaniel Rice - as next senior councillor - assumed the governorship in his absence. When the governor returned on 17 September 1734 he immediately suspended Rice from office, along with other councillors and alleged that Rice, Smith and Montgomery had attempted to assassinate him.'Governor George Burrington with an account of his official administrations in the colony of North Carolina 1924-25 and 1731-4' by Marshall DeLancey Haywood, 1896. Also see Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, 2nd Series, Volume 7, pp310-321 By the end of September, however, Governor Burrington himself had been removed from office again, and a new governor, Gabriel Johnston, had arrived to take charge who immediately reinstated all those councillors Burrington had suspended.Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, Volume 3, pp642-43 and Volume 4, pp1-3 Nathaniel Rice worked alongside Governor Johnston throughout his term. Rice was appointed a Commissioner of the Peace of New Hanover Precinct, a member of the General Court and Member of a Board of Commissioners to erect Fort Johnston. Burrington aside, Rice prospered in America where he probably had land acquisitions prior to his arriving in 1731 from his 1725 visit to South Carolina and he had a plantation on the south side of Old Town Creek in New Hanover County (most of the land owned by Nathaniel Rice later fell into newly formed Brunswick County, North Carolina), called 'Rice's Plantation'.The Two Faces of Dixie: politicians, plantations and slaves by J.
