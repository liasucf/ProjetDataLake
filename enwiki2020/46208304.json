    "text": "Soledad Ch\u00e1vez de Chac\u00f3n (August 10, 1890\u2013August 4, 1936) was the first woman elected to be the Secretary of State of New Mexico, and the first Hispanic woman elected to statewide office in the United States. She served as acting Governor of New Mexico for two weeks in 1924, becoming the second woman to act as chief executive of a U.S. state. ==Early life and education== Soledad Ch\u00e1vez was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1890. Her parents were Melit\u00f3n Ch\u00e1vez (1856\u20131932) and Francisca Baca de Ch\u00e1vez (1864\u20131923), both members of prominent New Mexico families. She had one older sister, Piedad Ch\u00e1vez Sandoval (1888\u20131969). The sisters spent part of their childhood at the Salvador Armijo House in Old Town, which was built in the 1840s by their maternal great-grandfather, Salvador Armijo. The house is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. with Ch\u00e1vez graduated from Albuquerque High School in 1908 and then completed an accounting program at the Albuquerque Business College. She married Ireneo Eduardo Chac\u00f3n (1885\u20131969) in 1910 and had two children, Adelina and Santiago. ==Career in politics== She was first elected to the office of Secretary of State in 1922, two years after the 19th Amendment guaranteed women the right to vote. The people of New Mexico nicknamed her \"Lala\" during her time in office. She served another two- year term in 1924. Chac\u00f3n became acting governor of New Mexico for two weeks from June 21 to July 5, 1924, when Governor James F. Hinkle left the state to attend the Democratic National Convention in New York City. Lieutenant Governor Jos\u00e9 A. Baca had died earlier in the year, leaving the Secretary of State next in the line of succession. She was the second woman to serve as chief executive of a U.S. state after Carolyn B. Shelton, who acted as governor of Oregon for three days in 1909. Upon taking office, Chac\u00f3n told reporters \"I am anticipating no serious problems during Governor Hinkle's absence, but should any occur I don't believe I shall have any difficulty in handling them.\" She undertook several actions as governor, including signing a requisition for New Mexico National Guard funding and issuing a pardon. She was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives in 1934, becoming the fourth Hispanic woman to hold that office. She served on several committees, including as chair of Rules and Orders of Business. In 1936, partway through her first term, she died of peritonitis at the age of 46. == References == Category:Women state legislators in New Mexico Category:1890 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Secretaries of State of New Mexico Category:Hispanic and Latino American women in politics Category:Politicians from Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:Members of the New Mexico House of Representatives Category:20th-century American politicians Category:20th- century American women politicians Category:New Mexico Democrats Category:Deaths from peritonitis ",
