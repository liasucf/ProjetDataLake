    "text": "Ant\u00f3nio Nunes Ribeiro Sanches (7 March 1699, Penamacor \u2013 14 October 1783, Paris) was an 18th-century Portuguese physician, philosopher and encyclop\u00e9diste. He was a crist\u00e3o novo of Jewish descent, probably a practising Jew. After he studied in the universities of Coimbra and Salamanca, Sanches moved to London. He then went to Leyden University where he completed his formation under the direction of Herman Boerhaave. He was among the three physicians that empress Anna of Russia asked the latter to recommend to her in 1731. Appointed doctor of the Russian army, he distinguished himself before becoming a court physician. After more than 15 years of stay in Russia, he left the country in 1748 after empress Elizabeth Petrowna had denounced two of his doctor colleagues as Jews. Having had the chance, amid the daily proscriptions which he witnessed to be allowed to leave the country, he took the way to Paris in 1748 where he ended his life. After she ascended to the throne, Catherine the Great rewarded him for his services with a pension of 1000 rubles, which was punctually paid until his death. He gave the article \u00ab V\u00e9role \u00bb to the Encyclop\u00e9die by Diderot and D'Alembert. == Works == * 1726: Discurso Sobre as \u00c1guas de Penha Garcia. * 1751: A Dissertation on the Venereal Disease. * 1752: Dissertation sur le origine de la maladie v\u00e9n\u00e9rienne, Paris * 1756: Tratado da Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da Sa\u00fade dos Povos. * 1760: Cartas sobre a Educa\u00e7\u00e3o da Mocidade. * 1763: M\u00e9todo para Aprender e Estudar a Medicina. * 1771: Les bains des vapeurs russe * 1774: Examen historique sur l\u00b4apparition de la maladie v\u00e9n\u00e9rienne (Paris) * 1779: M\u00e9moire sur les Bains de Vapeur en Russie.. == Bibliography == * Georges Dulac, Science et politique : les r\u00e9seaux du Dr Ant\u00f3nio Ribeiro Sanches, Cahiers du Monde russe (ISSN 1252-6576), 2002, 43/2-3, (p. 251\u2013274) (Read online). * Hugh James Rose, A New General Biographical Dictionary, t. 11, Londres, B.
