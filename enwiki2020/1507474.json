    "text": "Miyagawa Issh\u014d (, 1689 \u2013 20 January 1780) was a Japanese painter in the ukiyo-e style, primarily depicting kabuki actors, geisha, sumo wrestlers, and other elements of everyday urban culture. He used several other names: Fujiwara And\u014d (), Kohensai () and other; his common name was Kiheiji (). The majority of Issh\u014d's works that survive come from the Ky\u014dh\u014d era (1716\u20131736). He was a pupil of Miyagawa Ch\u014dshun (1682\u20131752), who, in turn, was influenced by the works of Hishikawa Moronobu. Like many ukiyo-e artists, Issh\u014d also produced a number of shunga, paintings of erotic scenes. Issh\u014d was banished from Edo in 1751, along with his master Ch\u014dshun, to the island of Niijima off the Izu Peninsula for a year. This came after a dispute arose over the payment for a painting commission in Nikk\u014d. A Kan\u014d school artist commissioned Ch\u014dshun to paint some of the walls of the Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b but refused or was unable to pay. In the ensuing confrontation, the Kan\u014d artist and two others were killed by Issh\u014d and Ch\u014dshun's son Issh\u014d was never pardoned and died on 20 January 1780.
