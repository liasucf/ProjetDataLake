    "text": "Beaucatcher Tunnel carries U.S. Route 70 (US 70) and US 74A through Beaucatcher Mountain in Asheville, North Carolina. Work on the tunnel was started in 1927 and completed in 1929. The tunnel has two lanes and sidewalks separated from the traffic lanes by concrete barriers. It was renovated in 2014 with new stone portals. For the construction of Interstate 240 on a parallel alignment two new tunnels were considered for the interstate route. In 1967 the North Carolina State Highway Commission endorsed an open cut through the mountain, which was projected to save $11.4 million over tunnel construction. The four-mile project was completed October 31, 1980. ==References== Category:Tunnels in North Carolina Category:Tunnels completed in 1929 Category:U.S. Route 70 Category:U.S. Route 74 Category:Buildings and structures in Asheville, North Carolina ",
