    "text": "Coswig (b Dresden) station is a railway station in Coswig in the German state of Saxony. The station, which opened on 1 December 1860, is at the junction of the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway, which terminates here, the Leipzig\u2013Dresden railway, the Pirna\u2013Coswig railway and a connecting curve from the Berlin\u2013Dresden railway. In passenger transport it is served by Regional- Express and Regionalbahn services and by the Dresden S-Bahn. The station is classified as a cultural monument. == History == At the opening of the section of the Leipzig\u2013Dresden railway that passes through Coswig on 16 September 1838, the Leipzig\u2013Dresden Railway Company had not built a station in Coswig. Nearly two years later, on 10 June 1840, the Coswig \"stopping point\" (Anhaltepunkt) was opened, which was about 900 metres from the location of the present station towards Leipzig. The first formal Coswig station was built with the opening of the branch line from Coswig to Mei\u00dfen (now part of the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway). Both were opened on 1 December 1860. This station was located between kilometer points 101.60 and 101.75 of the Leipzig\u2013Dresden railway. When connected to the railway network, Coswig developed into an important industrial community. This growth and technical progress meant that the construction of a new station building was required 30 years later. The new station building was built between 11 September 1893 and 4 June 1894. This building is still used as the entrance building. In addition, the railway tracks were rebuilt at a higher level and an island platform was built, which was connected by a pedestrian subway. Due to its function as a junction station, some long-distance services stopped at the station for a long time, most recently in the mid-1990s, when occasional InterRegio services stopped at the ends of the day. Since then, passenger operations have been limited to commuter services. The long-distance services have generally run over the newly built Wei\u00dfig\u2013B\u00f6hla railway since 2010 and thus bypass Coswig Station to the east. New passenger platforms with a height of 55 centimetres above the top of the rails were built between 2012 and 2015. === Station name === Station sign at \"Coswig (b Dresden)\" station During its existence, the station has borne the following names: * from 1 December 1860: Coswig * from 1 July 1911: Coswig (Sa) * from 4 October 1925: Coswig (Bez Dresden) * from 31 March 1934: Coswig (Bz Dresden) * from 14 December 2014: Coswig (b Dresden).Stredax viewer of DB Netz, accessed on 2 January 2015 The current name means \"Coswig near Dresden\". == Rail services== The station is on served by passenger services RE 15: Hoyerswerda\u2013Dresden, RE 18: Cottbus\u2013Dresden, RE 50: Leipzig\u2013Dresden and RB 31: Elsterwerda-Biehla\u2013Dresden and by Dresden S-Bahn line S1: Meissen-Triebischtal\u2013Sch\u00f6na (as of September 2014). {| class=\"wikitable\" !
