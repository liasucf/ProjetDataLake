    "text": "Arameans in Israel are a Christian minority residing in Israel. They claim descent from the Arameans, an ancient Semitic-speaking people in the Middle East in the 1st millennium BC. Some Syriac Christians in the Middle East espouse an Aramean ethnic identity and a minority in Syria still speak a Western Aramaic language, although the Eastern Aramaic languages are far more widely spoken. Most of the Arameans in Israel are Maronites. Until 2014, self- identified Arameans in Israel used to be registered as ethnic Arabs or without ethnic identity. However, since September 2014, Christian families or clans who can speak Aramaic and/or have an Aramaic family tradition are eligible to register as ethnic Arameans in Israel. In October 2019, the Israel Christian Aramaic Organization estimated the number of Israeli citizens, who are eligible to obtain Aramean affiliation at 15,000. ==Demographics== The first person to receive the \"Aramean\" ethnic status in Israel was 2 year old Yaakov Halul in Jish on October 20, 2014. In July 2016, an article in the Ha'aretz estimated the number of Israeli Christians eligible to register as Arameans in Israel to be 13,000. In October 2019, the Israel Christian Aramaic Organization estimated the number of Israeli citizens, who are eligible to obtain Aramean affiliation at 15,000. ==Recognition in Israel== ===Legal recognition=== In September 2014, Ministry of the Interior Gideon Sa'ar instructed the to recognise Arameans as an ethnicity separate from Israeli Arabs. Under the Ministry of the Interior's guidance, people born into Christian families or clans who have either Aramaic or Maronite cultural heritage within their family are eligible to register as Arameans. About 200 Christian families were thought to be eligible prior to this decision. According to an August 9, 2013 Israel Hayom article, at that time an estimated 10,500 persons were eligible to receive Aramean ethnic status according to the new regulation, including 10,000 Maronites (which included 2,000 former SLA members) and 500 Syriac Catholics. The first person to receive the \"Aramean\" ethnic status in Israel was 2 year old Yaakov Halul in Jish on October 20, 2014. Another milestone in recognising Aramean minority as a distinct culture in Israel was made by Israeli court in 2019, which ruled that Aramean minority could choose Jewish or Arab education, rather than making children with Aramean identity to be automatically designated to Arabic-language schools. ===Controversy=== The recognition of the Aramean ethnicity caused mixed reactions among Israeli minorities, the Christian community, and among the general Arab Israeli population. Whilst some celebrated the success of their long legal struggle to be recognised as a non-Arab ethnic minority, other members of the Arab community in Israel denounced it as an attempt to divide Arab Christians. Representatives of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem officially denounced the move. Many in Israeli academia advocate the recognition of the Aramean identity and have called on the government of Israel to promote the awareness regarding this issue on the basis of the international principle of ethnic self-determination as espoused by Wilson's 14 points. One of the staunchest supporters of the recognition of the Aramean identity is Father Gabriel Naddaf, who is one of the leaders of the Christians in Israel. He advocated on behalf of his Aramean followers and thanked the Interior Ministry's decision as a \"historic move\". ==See also== *Arameans *Christianity in Israel ==External links== *Arameans in the Middle East and Israel: Historical Background, Modern National Identity, and Government Policy ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Israel Category:Syriac Christians ",
