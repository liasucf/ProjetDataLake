    "text": "The 2001\u201302 season was Football Club Internazionale Milano's 93th in existence and 86th consecutive season in the top flight of Italian football. == Season overview== After a disappointing previous season, Massimo Moratti chose former Valencia coach H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper as the coach of rebirth. C\u00faper managed to line-up a new team, buying players such as Toldo, Materazzi, Kallon and Ventola. Inter had a sprint-start, topping the league and passing several challenges in Europe. 2001 closed with Giuseppe Prisco's death, vicechairman since 1962. In the second part of season, Inter showed signs of exhaustion: 1\u20132 home loss to Atalanta was followed, on Thursday, from European elimination. Before the last league game, against Lazio, Inter was still at the top with one point over Juventus and two over Roma. In the first half, Inter scored twice, but both goals were equalized by Lazio's Poborsky. During second half of the match, Lazio - still in race for a UEFA Cup spot - scored another two goals, eventually winning the match. Inter fell to third place, enough to qualify for next season's Champions League playoff. Lazio-Inter also marked Ronaldo's last appearance with Inter. ==First-team squad== :Squad at end of season. ===Left club during season=== ===Reserve squad=== :The following players did not make an appearance for the first team. ==Competitions== ===Serie A=== ====Matches==== ===Coppa Italia=== ===UEFA Cup=== ====First round==== Internazionale won 6\u20130 on aggregate. ====Second round==== Internazionale won 2\u20131 on aggregate. ====Third round==== Internazionale won 4\u20132 on aggregate. ====Fourth round==== Internazionale won 5\u20133 on aggregate. ====Quarter- finals==== Internazionale won 2\u20131 on aggregate. ====Semi-finals==== Feyenoord won 3\u20132 on aggregate. ==Statistics== ===Appearances and goals=== :As of 31 June 2002http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=1370&teamTabs;=stats |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Goalkeepers |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Defenders |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Midfielders |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Forwards |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Players transferred out during the season ===Goalscorers=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align: center;\" |- !width=\"7%\"|No. !width=\"7%\"|Pos. !width=\"7%\"|Nation !width=\"20%\"|Name !Serie A !Coppa Italia !UEFA Cup !Total |- | 32 | FW | | Christian Vieri | 22 | 0 | 3 |25 |- | 3 | FW | | Mohamed Kallon | 9 | 0 | 6 |15 |- | 78 | FW | | Nicola Ventola | 4 | 1 | 5 |10 |- | 9 | FW | | Ronaldo | 7 | 0 | 0 |7 |- | 20 | FW | | \u00c1lvaro Recoba | 6 | 0 | 0 |6 |- | 10 | MF | | Clarence Seedorf | 3 | 1 | 0 |4 |- | 14 | MF | | Luigi Di Biagio | 3 | 0 | 1 |4 |- | 4 | DF | | Javier Zanetti | 0 | 1 | 1 |2 |- | 6 | MF | | Cristiano Zanetti | 1 | 0 | 1 |2 |- | 23 | DF | | Marco Materazzi | 1 | 0 | 1 |2 |- | 2 | DF | | Iv\u00e1n C\u00f3rdoba | 1 | 0 | 0 |1 |- | 7 | MF | | S\u00e9rgio Con\u00e7eic\u00e3o | 1 | 0 | 0 |1 |- | 11 | MF | | Guly | 0 | 0 | 1 |1 |- | 18 | MF | | St\u00e9phane Dalmat | 1 | 0 | 0 |1 |- | 21 | MF | | Grigorios Georgatos | 1 | 0 | 0 |1 |- | 24 | DF | | Vratislav Gre\u0161ko | 0 | 0 | 1 |1 |- | 28 | FW | | Adriano | 1 | 0 | 0 |1 |- | # | colspan=3 | Own goals | 1 | 0 | 0 |1 |- |- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\" | colspan=4 | TOTAL | 62 | 3 | 20 | 85 ==References== Category:Inter Milan seasons Internazionale ",
