It is the only Filipino film to be released by Warner Bros. Pictures. ==Plot== Melinda (Alessandra de Rossi) is a new substitute teacher at the Malawig Elementary School, located in a poor remote barrio. A young university graduate, her family expects her to look for work abroad, but in her idealism she takes on a challenging job in the provincial public school, which lacks resources and has corrupt personnel. The heavy monsoon rains and the nearby NPAs also add to her difficulties. Melinda goes about her work with daily diligence though, always having a smile, a kind word for her neatly uniformed charges. But her battles against apathy, corruption, and contempt are constant, further hindered by the volatile political climate in which fathers and sons are constantly recruited to join guerilla forces fighting in the mountains. When a funding opportunity in the form of a regional singing contest presents itself to Melinda, the idealistic teacher must smartly juggle uncooperative school administrators, confrontational parents, and the torn children themselves in order to let their small voices be heard. ==Cast== *Alessandra de Rossi as Melinda *Dexter Doria as Mrs. Pantalan *Gina Alajar as Chayong *Amy Austria as Luz *Bryan Homecillo as Popoy *Pierro Rodriguez III as Obet *Irma Adlawan as Fe *Keno Agaro as Adong *AJ Delos Santos as Carlos *Sining Blanco as Gela *Noni Buencamino as Fidel *Mhalouh Crisologo as Solita *Hazel Logan as Ida *Christian Galindo as Lino *Nanding Josef as Adong's Father *Tony Mabesa as Mr. Tibayan *Lailani Navarro as Pilar *Jessie Diaz as Bugoy 1 *James Alvaro as Bugoy 2 *Rowell Reyes as Ato *Alchris Galura *Celina Suntay as Malawig choir kids *Jocel Escobal as Malawig choir kids *Myko Suntay as Malawig choir kids *Jelly Cruz as Malawig choir kids *Gemma Gonzales as Malawig choir kids *Nanding Josef as Adong's Dad *Shamaine Centenera as Adong's Mom *Connie Chua as Gela's Mom *Aleth dela Cruz as Ida's Mom *Hamid Eton as Mr. Singh *Tessie Villarama as Teacher/Emcee *Jess Evardone as Melinda's Dad *Jo Kristi Payet as Young Melinda *Rey Mendoza as Adong's Brother *Jasper Vinarao as Adong's Brother *Bong Rodriguez as Ka Andres/NPA 1 *Jun Galindo as NPA 2 *Dr. Ramon Pedro P.
