    "text": "The church tower in Bj\u00e4lbo from the 12th Century. Bj\u00e4lbo is a small village in Mj\u00f6lby Municipality, \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, Sweden. The medieval House of Bjelbo had a church and a manor house at Bj\u00e4lbo. King Magnus Minnesk\u00f6ld was probably born here, and in around 1210 his son Birger Magnusson. Today the church tower is preserved. The church was probably built in the first half of the twelfth century, reflecting new techniques brought by Cistercian monks from France in 1143. The surviving tower was probably added around 1220. Both structures are thought to have been projects of Ingrid Ylva, mother of Birger Jarl. In 1173, King (or pretender) Kol Sverkerson was killed in a battle at Bj\u00e4lbo. digitized July 9, 2008 ==See also== *Bj\u00e4lbo Runestones ==References== Category:Populated places in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County Category:Populated places in Mj\u00f6lby Municipality ",
