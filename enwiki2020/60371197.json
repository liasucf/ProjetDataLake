At the age of 20, she returned to the Yukon, where she is originally from, and documented the cultural practices around hunting, fishing, trapping, tanning moose and caribou hides, and beading. She is also known to use tintype photography as a means to place her work \"in dialogue with the problematic history of Native American imagery by white photographers\". Spitzer received a Reveal Indigenous Art Award in 2017 from the Hnatyshyn Foundation. Spitzer's photograph Sister (2016) is the image used as the basis for the sculpture Every One, which is part of the social engagement work called the MMIWQT Bead Project by artist Cannupa Hanska Luger. The work was made up of 4,000-plus clay beads made by people all over North America as to create portrait in a way to \"rehumanize data\" surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, queer and trans people. == Education == Spitzer earned her certificate in professional photography from the Western Academy of Photography and has studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, under the mentorship of Will Wilson. == Exhibitions == Spitzer's work has been shown at the 2018 Contemporary Native Art Biennial, was exhibited at the Sherbrooke Museum of Fine Arts, Sherbrooke, Quebec, the Portland Art Museum's Center for Contemporary Native Art, the Never Apart Centre in Montreal, Quebec, and grunt gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia. == References == == External links == * Artist website Category:Living people Category:Canadian women artists Category:21st-century Canadian artists Category:First Nations photographers Category:1987 births Category:Jewish Canadian artists Category:Canadian people of Romanian-Jewish descent Category:Kaska Dena ",
