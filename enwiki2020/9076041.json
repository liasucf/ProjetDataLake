The main carrier is Air Iceland with flights to Reykjav\u00edk. The airport has several car rental options available, such as Europcar and Sixt. Egilssta\u00f0ir also serves as a diversion airport for Keflavik International Airport located 415 kilometers southwest of Egilsta\u00f0ir. ==History== The air terminal was originally built in 1968, but was rebuilt and expanded during 1987 to 1999. A new arrivals hall was opened in 2007. It is mainly used for domestic flights to Reykjav\u00edk, but there has been a route to Copenhagen, and charter flight from London and Edinburgh, UK (the tour operator Discover the World chartered flights in 2016 but has later preferred regular tickets to Keflavik for its escorted Iceland trips). ==Airlines and destinations== ==See also== *Transport in Iceland *List of airports in Iceland ==References== ==External links== *OurAirports - Egilssta\u00f0ir *OpenStreetMap - Egilssta\u00f0ir * Terminal of Egilssta\u00f0ir Airport seen from the Tarmac Category:Airports in Iceland ",
