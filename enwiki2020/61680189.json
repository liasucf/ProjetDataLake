    "text": "John Arthur Getreu (born August 26, 1944) is an American murderer and possible serial killer who was convicted of one murder in 1963 that took place in West Germany. He is also charged with two more murders, committed in California between 1973 and 1974, which means he could be an international serial killer. ==Crimes== Convicted: * June 8, 1963 rape and murder of 15 year old Margaret Williams at a US base in West Germany. Getreu, who was convicted in the German court system was tried as a juvenile in 1964 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was released in 1969 and returned to the US. * January 19, 1975 rape of a 17-year old Girl Scout in Palo Alto for which he took a guilty plea deal for statutory rape, paid a $200 fine and was sentenced to six months in jail. Suspect: *1969 attempted murder of then 19-year old Sharon Lucchese. *1973 sexual assault and murder of 21-year old Leslie Perlov in Stanford CA (charged in November 2018 based on DNA evidence). *1974 murder of 21-year old Janet Taylor at Sand Hill Road near Woodside (charged in May 2019 based on DNA evidence). The Perlov murder had many suspects in the case, but all were ruled out until November 24, 2018 when Getreu was arrested by authorities after crime scene DNA was linked to him using a genetic genealogy site, GEDmatch. After that, the Taylor murder DNA was linked to Perlov DNA, so Getreu is now being charged with both murders. Getreu has pled not guilty to both murders and was scheduled to go on trial for the Perlov murder in September 2020, However the trial was postponed due to Getreu falling ill.https://almanacnews.com/news/2020/09/22/alleged-serial-killer-lands-in- hospital-before-trial == Media == The case against Getreu was covered in detail, along with the murder of Arlis Perry, in a February 2020 episode of Casefile True Crime Podcast. == See also == * List of serial killers in the United States ==References== Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American criminals Category:People convicted of murder by Germany Category:People convicted of rape Category:People from Newark, Ohio ",
