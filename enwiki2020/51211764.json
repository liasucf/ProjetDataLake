    "text": "Shimon Schuldiner (born August 10, 1946) is an Israeli biochemist. He has made important contributions to the understanding of proteins that couple the movement of ions and other molecules across membranes. Schuldiner is Mathilda Marks-Kennedy Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He received a B.Sc. in 1967 and an M.Sc. in 1968 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot in 1973. == Biography == Schuldiner was born on August 10, 1946 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Hana Joszpe and Berko Schuldiner, who were Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. In 1964 he emigrated to Israel, where he has been living since. He earned a B.Sc. in 1967 and a M.Sc. in 1968 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the latter working with Itzhak Ohad. In 1973 he received a Ph.D. for work performed in the laboratory of Mordhay Avron (z\"l) Gromet-Elhanan, Z. (1992) Journal of Bioenergetics and Biomembranes 24, 520-521 at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot . From 1973 to 1976 he did postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Howard Ronald Kaback at the Roche Institute for Molecular Biology in Nutley, New Jersey. In 1976 he returned to Israel and joined the Department of Molecular Biology at Hadassah Medical School, and in 1990 he moved to the Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, both at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Between 1999 and 2002, he served as Chairman of the Silberman Institute. Schuldiner is married to Monica Schuldiner, with whom he has two children and six grandchildren. He and his wife are long-time supporters of civil rights in Israel and of the advancement of peace. His son Oren and his daughter-in-law Maya Schuldiner are also research biologists, working at the Weizmann Institute of Science. His son Ilan is a physiotherapist at Maccabi Health Services and his daughter in law, Hila Zadka, is a researcher at The Israel Center for Disease Control, Israel Ministry of Health. == Career == Schuldiner is a world expert in the expression, purification, and characterization of membrane proteins. Specifically, he focuses on the multidrug antiporter EmrE. Investigation of its subunit structure led the Schuldiner Group to propose a dimer of topologically parallel subunits. This led to a long-running controversy over EmrE topology that eventually led Schuldiner to demonstrate that both parallel and antiparallel dimers are functional.Woodall, N.
