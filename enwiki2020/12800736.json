Ersatz-Division) was a unit of the German Army, in World War I.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as, during the period of German unification (1866-1871), the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies. Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous and only came under Prussian control during wartime. The division was formed in June 1915 as a temporary division known as the Division Basedow, named after its commander, Heino von Basedow.Division Basedow (Chronik 1915/1916) It was formed from two previously independent Brigades: 37th Mixed Landwehr and 2nd Reserve Ersatz.
