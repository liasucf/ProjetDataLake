    "text": "Bray Wilkins (probably pronounced based on contemporaneous spelling Brey Wilkeens; 1610 \u2013 1/2 January 1702) was a Welsh immigrant, patriarch, and founder of Middleton, Massachusetts. Bray's origins aren't concretely known and are supplanted (and probably distorted) by familial tradition, however his reputation was already prolific in the Massachusetts Bay Colony decades before his death. His progeny, the Wilkins family, had a strong presence in the area. Bray and his seed were prominent figures in some Salem Witch Trials. ==Early life== Very little is known about Bray's life before emigrating to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It is known from his own admission and other records which required such information that Bray was born about 1610, in Wales. Where in Wales he was born is up for debate, it is sometimes suggested he was born in Brecknockshire, however, this is based on the mistaken assumption that Bray was a descendant of the lord John Wilkins, who married the sister of Oliver Cromwell, the fact that John Wilkins was born more than four years after Bray often overlooked. The authors of several historical works on old Salem and New England make significantly similar claims that Bray was a descendant, in varying forms, of the lordly Wilkins families in Wales. William C. Hill states it is \"quite likely\" that Bray heralded from one of these Wilkins families, whose presence in Wales is well attested.Hill, William Carroll, b. 1875. The Family of Bray Wilkins: \"Patriarch of Will's Hill\", of Salem (Middleton), Mass. Milford, N.H.: Cabinet Press, 1943. Thus, though the immediate descendancy is a mystery, Bray was probably a descendant of Robert de Wintona, one of the men who captured Wales for the Norman people alongside Robert FitzHamon in the mid-11th century. Robert became the lord over Llandow and Llanblethian, in the latter of which he built a large manor which housed his descendants for some years. His great-grandson, Wilkyne de Winton, is the first attestation of what would become the surname 'Wilkins'. Over time, the by-names of Robert's descendants became corrupted, eventually forming surnames such as Wilcolyne, Wilkyn, Wilkin, and ultimately, Wilkins. That being said, Bray's immediate origins are still nonetheless a mystery. \"Thorough inquiry\" conducted by English and Welsh genealogical authorities have found no definite trace of Bray or his immediate ancestors. Family tradition places his birth in Glamorganshire on 16 October 1610, as the son of Thomas John Willkins and Hannah Nichols. However, as stated, there are no (surviving) records supporting these conclusions. As for this rumor's origins \u2014 one of Bray's grandsons, Bray II, was born by Bray's son Thomas and his wife Hannah Nichols, and it's likely a confusion arose between the two due to the shared name and this paternity was applied to the former Bray in genealogical resources. ==Immigration and life in Massachusetts== Regardless of his origins, Bray arrived in the Thirteen Colonies around 1630, his first residence being recorded as Lynn, Massachusetts. He is first mentioned in a parchment dated January 16, 1632 which describes the allotment of 16 acres of Dorchester to him. He is registered as have taken the Oath of a Freeman on May 14, 1634. Bray was known by the community as a model citizen: upright, pious, and adored. In 1659, Bray and his partner John Gengell (of uncertain relations, see below) leased 700 acres of land eight to ten miles northwest of Salem, which became the town of Danvers, and later Middleton. A controversial mortgage claim lead to Bray and Gengell being brought to court in 1666. ===Salem Witch Trials=== In 1689, Bray and his family, along with several others, moved from Salem proper to establish a church in Danvers. Around 1690, Bray's granddaughter by his son Thomas, Margaret, married a man by the name of John Willard. Willard acted as a constable for the court, and given Bray's legal misfortunes decades prior, the family disapproved of him immediately after it was announced Margaret and John were eloped. The two lived a rather normal life for several years, all the while the Wilkins family did not shy away from making it known how they disapproved of John. During the first weeks of the Salem Witch Trials in spring 1692, paranoia and mania swept through Danvers. Willard, being a constable, at times found himself ordered to arrest townspeople he held in high regard. His refusal to arrest accused witches lead to himself being accused of witchcraft, and on May 10 of the same year a warrant for Willard's arrest was ratified. Willard fled to Nashaway, where he was discovered following the issue of a second warrant for his arrest. Once returned to Danvers, Mercy Lewis, at this time the lover of Henry Wilkins, one of Bray's sons, accused Willard of being responsible for the death of her newborn son Daniel. Willard was put on trial on May 18, during which Bray Wilkins testified that he had been inflicted with a very painful condition after Willard had given him a stare, recounting, \"[Willard] lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any.\" Indeed, a kidney stone had begun to afflict Bray after he had encountered Willard in the middle of a meal some days before. Thomas was mortified at the proceedings against his son-in- law, and refused to take part in the trial. Two of Bray's daughters and several others gave second-hand testimony that John Willard had beaten his wife Margaret and then exhibited odd behavior which frightened her into running to a relative's house for safety. During his examination, he denied these allegations with the rest, and desired that his wife would be called to testify on his behalf, but this does not appear to have been done. Indeed, no such frenzy is known to have occurred at any point, Margaret and John shared three children and lived a modest life. Regardless, the testimony of the Wilkins family was damning, and Willard was found guilty and hanged for witchcraft that August. ==Death== Bray Wilkins died in January 1702. His burial place is not known, though legend places in on the original foundations of Danvers/Middleton that he and Gengell built, today known as \"Will's Hill\", also where he died. ==Marriage and descendants== The identity of Bray Wilkins' wife isn't known, but there are two candidates: Hannah Way and Hannah Gengell. Hannah Gengell is proposed to have been the sister of Bray's lifelong partner John Gengell. Neither candidate has more evidence favoring their identification over the other, however it is more likely Bray married Hannah Way as opposed to Hannah Gengell. Any mention of Bray's wife simply refers to her as \"Hannah\" or \"Anna\" and no mention of her maiden name is ever recorded in the sparse times she is ever mentioned. No record of her death is known to exist. Bray was only married once, the wedding probably taking place between 1632 and 1636. Per William C. Hill, Bray Wilkins had eight children: # Samuel Wilkins Sr. (December 1636 \u2013 20 December 1688) # John Wilkins (22 March 1642 \u2013 1723) # Lydia Wilkins (25 September 1644 \u2013 1701), who married John Nichols of Topsfield # Thomas Wilkins (16 Mar 1647 \u2013 October 1717) # Margaret Wilkins ( 1648 \u2013 1697), who married Philip Knight Jr. # Henry Wilkins (17 July 1651 \u2013 8 December 1737) # Benjamin Wilkins ( 1652 \u2013 1715) # James Wilkins ( 1655 \u2013 ?) It is unlikely James was actually a son of Bray, though he is indeed listed as such in the works of William C. Hill. Bray mentioned neither James nor his heirs in his will, nor did he give James land as he did his known sons, and no one named \"James\" was at any time associated with any of Bray's family. John Gengell left legacies to all Bray's children in his will, but James is not mentioned here either. ===Bray's wife: Hannah Gengell or Hannah Way?=== William C. Hill's The Family of Bray Wilkins, Patriarch of Will's Hill, states \"Bray Wilkins' wife was probably Hannah Gengell. There is no record of the marriage to be found, which probably occurred at Dorchester between 1632 and 1636, for on the latter date Hannah Wilkins, the wife of Bray, is recorded as having been received into the First Church in Dorchester... Hannah Gengell was the sister of John Gengell, one of the incorporators of Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1643.\" Two persons who had access to much early documentary material about the Wilkins family, now lost, Martha J. Averill and Emily Ann Milliken n\u00e9e Wilkins, maintained that Bray's wife was Hannah Gengell, and furthermore the Wilkins are described with familial kindness in John Gengell\u2019s will dated 10 April 1685. However, a 1984 article from The American Genealogist written by David L. Greene disputes the identification of Bray's wife as a Gengell by pointing out apparent errors in Hill's work. Greene claimed Hill's main piece of support, John Gengell's will, makes the conclusion impossible, as Gengell called himself 70 in that document, and thus about 21 when Bray married Hannah (though why this fact makes it impossible for the wife of Bray Wilkins to be Hannah Gengell is suspiciously unexplained). Though Greene acknowledges that it is difficult to escape the inference that Bray and John Gengell were in some way related, he advances the following arguments: Henry Way arrived at Nantasket in 1630 (meaning he was in New England when Bray was) with his wife Elizabeth and children Samuel, Richard, Henry, and Susanna. However, Henry Way had at least one more child who emigrated to America with him, Aaron. Greene suggests this seemingly missing entry for his son Aaron Way could mean that another of Henry Way's children may very well have gone undocumented just as Aaron did. Additionally, Bray purportedly sold land to what he called his \"trusty kinsman\" in May 1675, one of whom was clarified as Aaron Way. Furthermore, during his testimony against Willard in 1692, Bray called Richard Way, his theoretical brother-in- law, his 'brother'. Greene also mentions one of Bray\u2019s sons was named \u2018Henry\u2019, which he postulates was intended as the namesake of Hannah Way\u2019s father. However, there is no reason to think that other relationships couldn\u2019t explain the language. After all, members of a common social group might call themselves \"brothers\" or \"cousins\" without any actual blood or marital relationship. Still, it doesn\u2019t help the case of the Gengell identification that Hannah Way is attested to while Hannah Gengell isn\u2019t. John Gengell himself is only sparsely attested to, let alone a hypothetical sister of his, and even then, none of the surviving pieces that attest to his existence give an idea of his personal life. On the other hand, the Way family is very well documented; manuscript summaries of the parish registers for Bridport and Allington, Dorset, in the collection of the Rev. Richard Grosvenor Bartelot, show that Henry Way married Elizabeth Batchelar on 22 Jan. 1615, (apparently as his second wife) and that they had a daughter \"Hanah\" who was baptized there on 3 March 1616. Additionally, while it is true and evident in John Gengell\u2019s will that he regarded the Wilkins very highly, he very explicitly avoids calling them relatives. Coincidentally, Aaron Way is also mentioned alongside a \u201cMary Way\u201d as a witness in the will. The American Genealogist, Vol. 60; Jan. 1984; Bray Wilkins of Salem Village, Ma. and his children. Greene, David L. pp. 14\u201318, 111-113 Clarence Almon Torrey, in his 6,000 page index to what is estimated to be 99% of marriages performed in 17th century New England, asserts that Bray's wife was Hannah Way. ==References== Category:1610 births Category:1702 deaths Category:Accusers in witch trials Category:American city founders Category:People from Salem, Massachusetts Category:People of colonial Massachusetts Category:People of the Salem witch trials Category:Welsh emigrants to the United States ",
