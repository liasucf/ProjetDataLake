Doyle dominated Illawarra Rugby League in 1943. Not only was he a key member of the Illawarra Premiership winning team, he was awarded the Alex Jack Memorial Trophy as the best under 21 player and he was the Group 7 five eighth for the Country Week games against Sydney clubs. He played strongly for Group 7 and it was no surprise when he was selected as five eighth for NSW Country Firsts in their annual match with City at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 12 June 1943. In a high scoring game, City won by 37-25 but Leo impressed many people with his display. Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players, 1995. After approaches from several Sydney clubs, Doyle joined the St. George Dragons for three seasons in 1944. In that first season he was St. George\u2019s top first grade point scorer with 87 (five tries, 36 goals). When he left the Dragons he had played 27 first grade games and scored 112 points (eight tries, 44 goals).
