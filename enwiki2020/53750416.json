From 1438 he studied the liberal arts at the Cracow Academy. Six years later, he earned his baccalarius. In 1445 he gained the title magister and began to lecture on mathematics and astronomy. That same year, Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki, the academy's chancellor, arranged for him to study abroad. Kr\u00f3l attended the universities in Prague (1445), Leipzig, Padua and Bologna, where he lectured on astronomy in 1448. In December 1449, he earned the title doctor of medicine. Shortly thereafter, Kr\u00f3l left for Hungary, where he was the court physician to John Hunyadi. He probably also spent tme at the court of John Vit\u00e9z w Oradea. Kr\u00f3l returned to Cracow probably in the winter of 1450 through the intervention of Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki and Jan D\u0142ugosz, and took up a position as professor at the Cracow Academy. He covered mathematics (geometry) and astronomy, founding the latter department. Sometime after 1450, he also established the department of astrology, which soon developed a European-wide reputation. He kept up close correspondence with other astronomers, including the Austrian Georg von Peuerbach and the German Regiomontanus. In this period Kr\u00f3l also served as doctor to the bishop of Cracow. At his death in 1460, his substantial fortune went, in large part, to the University of Cracow, as was his wish. A small sum also went to his brother Florian, a peasant settled in the family village of \u017burawica. == Works == * Nova compilatio algorismi minutiarum. * Algorismus minuciarum. 1445.Lectures given in 1445; now surviving in 3 copies. * Summa super Tabulas Alphonsi vel Correctiones Tabularum Alphonsi. 1450\u20131451(?).
