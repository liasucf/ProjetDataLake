The CUT has very close ties with the Galician People's Front.Beramendi, X.G. (2007): De provincia a naci\u00f3n. Historia do galeguismo pol\u00edtico. Xerais, Vigo The founding congress was held in Vigo on 19 April 1999. The CUT defines itself as a class union, which aims to defend the interests of the working class. The organization also defends active and combative unionism, as opposed to the mild tactics of the main unions, specially Workers Commissions and the Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores. It has a Galician nationalist and socialist ideology. The CUT has offices in Santiago de Compostela, A Coru\u00f1a, Vigo, Cangas do Morrazo and Ribeira. In 2009 600 members of the CUT split (including the majority of the militants of A Coru\u00f1a and Ferrolterra) and formed the Central Obreira Galega (Galician Workers Central). ==References== ==External links== * CUT official site * CUT official Twitter Category:Trade unions in Spain Category:1998 establishments in Spain Category:National trade union centers of Spain Category:European Trade Union Confederation Category:Trade unions established in 1993 Category:Socialism Category:Galician nationalism ",
