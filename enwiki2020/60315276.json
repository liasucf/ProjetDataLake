La Constituci\u00f3n de 1949. Antecedentes y proyecciones. San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica: Editorial Costa Rica. It was issued just after the Ochomogo War when the monarchist camp settled in Cartago and Heredia and headed by Joaqu\u00edn de Oreamuno as its commander of arms, was defeated by the Republican side commanded by Gregorio Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez and gravitated around San Jos\u00e9 and Alajuela. Ram\u00edrez defeated Oreamuno on April 5 at the battle of Ochomogo and assumed power until April 16 when he handed it over to a Constituent Congress that held it between April 16 and May 10, 1823, presided over by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Peralta y La Vega. This Congress confirmed Ram\u00edrez as General Commander in Arms, imposed the seat of government in San Jos\u00e9 and promulgated the Second Political Statute of the Province that it officiated as a Constitution. This Statute created a Governmental Superior Junta of five tenure and two alternates members and prescribed a bicameral Parliament that appointed a Political Chief, a Mayor and a General Commander of Arms.Obreg\u00f3n Lor\u00eda, Rafael (1966). El Poder Legislativo en Costa Rica. San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica: Asamblea Legislativa. The two chambers of Parliament were an Assembly of Representatives and a Representative Council both of popular election. The first had initiative of law, fiscal authority and construction of infrastructure, the second functioned as a high chamber with power of sanction of laws, would advise the Executive Branch, commission of appointments and court of ethics for the civil servants. The statute would remain in force from May 1823 to November 1824, when the Basis of Federal Constitution would become effective as Costa Rica is a member of the Central American Federation. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica ",
