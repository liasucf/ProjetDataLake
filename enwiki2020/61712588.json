He was defeated by Bob MacKinnon in the 1964 Yukon general election.\"Yukon Election Upset As Speaker Defeated\". Edmonton Journal, September 10, 1964.

Ottawa Citizen, November 19, 1974. He then challenged the validity of Watson's election on the basis of allegations that 26 ineligible voters had cast ballots in the district; although it was impossible to determine which way the invalid votes had been cast, the result was in doubt because the number exceeded Watson's 17-vote margin of victory.\"Watson Election Challenged\".

Livesey ran for office one more time in the 1978 Yukon general election, the territory's first conventionally partisan election to the new Legislative Assembly of Yukon, as an independent candidate in Kluane.
