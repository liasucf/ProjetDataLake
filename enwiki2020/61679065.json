Through his father, he was a great- great-grandson of Andr\u00e1s Hadik de Futak, famous for capturing the Prussian capital Berlin during the Seven Years' War. His uncle, Count Alexander Hadik, was rumored to have been engaged to Alice Claypoole Vanderbilt, the widow of Cornelius Vanderbilt II (his eventual wife's maternal grandparents), in 1908, but the marriage never happened.

He was made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece of the House of Habsburg. After his marriage, he took over management of the family estate and palace in Sereg\u00e9lyes. During World War II, the palace was occupied by German troops, and, later, by the Soviets. During this time, most of the family's possessions were lost. In 1945, Hadik and his family left Hungary and in 1946, they moved to the United States and lived in Chester, New Hampshire, where they bought a house from her cousin Bill Vanderbilt.
