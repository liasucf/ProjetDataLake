Christoph (Keller) Cellarius (22 November 1638 \u2013 4 June 1707) was a German classical scholar from Schmalkalden who held positions in Weimar and Halle. Although the Ancient-Medieval-Modern division of history was used earlier by Italian Renaissance scholars Leonardo Bruni and Flavio Biondo, Cellarius' Universal History Divided into an Ancient, Medieval, and New Period helped popularize it. After him, this tripartite division became standard. The library of the University of Applied Sciences in Schmalkalden bears his name, it is called the \"Cellarius Bibliothek\", in honor of Cellarius. == Bibliography == * Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Memoirs of Goethe, Cellarius, Printed for Henry Colburn (London), 1824. ==See also== * Universal history * Periodization Category:1638 births Category:1707 deaths Category:People from Schmalkalden Category:17th- century Latin-language writers Category:18th-century Latin-language writers Category:18th-century male writers Category:German classical scholars Category:People from the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel Category:University of Giessen alumni Category:University of Halle faculty Category:University of Jena alumni ",
