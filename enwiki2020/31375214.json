He worked as a literary critic and published his own poetry and prose, occasionally under the pseudonym Fritz D\u00f6ring. == Life == Carl Busse (Fritz D\u00f6ring).

He was an associate editor of the Deutschen Wochenblatt, a journal for politics, art, and literature, and contributed to Leipzig publisher Velhagen & Klasings Monatsheften. Busse was a founding member of the \"Cartel of German Lyric Authors\". The composer Heinrich Kaspar Schmid included a setting Busse's poem \"Sch\u00f6ne Nacht\" in his Op. 9 songs of 1903. The song premiered on 18 June 1903 at the Munich Odeon in a concert of students from the Academy of Music in Munich with the composer at the piano. Busse belonged to a circle of writers supported by Ludwig Stollwerck, a Cologne chocolate magnate and entrepreneur. They helped design the Stollwerck firm's series of collectable scrapbooks and print albums, \"Stollwerck's Sammel-Album\". Other writers included poet \"T. Resa\" (Theresa Gr\u00f6he, n\u00e9e Pauli-Greiffenberg), zoology professor Paul Matschie, author Hans Eschelbach, journalist Julius Rodenberg, author Joseph von Lauff, novelist Gustav Falke, and the poet Anna Ritter.
