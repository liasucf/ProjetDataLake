    "text": "Haji Mirza Akasi or Aghasi (), sometimes known as Haji-Mollah Abbas Iravani, was the Sadr-e Azam (equivalent to prime minister) of Qajar Iran between 1835-1848, during the reign of king Mohammad Shah Qajar. ==Biography== Muhammad Shah Qajar and his Vizier Haj Mirza Aghasi, second quarter of the nineteenth century, Ink, opaque watercolor and gold on paper, Iran, collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Aqasi was born and brought up in Maku to a certain Moslem ibn Abbas, a \"petty\" Mollah landowner of the city of \u012arav\u0101n (Yerevan), then still part of Iran, and a member of the Bayat clan. Mirza Akasi initiated Mohammad Shah into Sufi mysticism, and the two men \"came to be known as two 'dervishes'.\"Avery, Modern Iran, p. 30. While he has often been criticized for contributing to the disasters of the reign, it is possible that he was attempting to use Sufism as a weapon against the growing hold of the official representatives of religion, the mullahs, who were opposing both modernization and foreign influence. In foreign affairs, he managed to \"prevent Iran disintegrating either into autonomous principalities or appanages of Russia, and Britain,\" and internally he \"revived the cultivation of the mulberry tree in the Kerman region, to feed silkworms; and he envisaged the diversion of the waters of the River Karaj for Tehran's water- supply.\"Avery, Modern Iran, pp. 46-7. The failure of Haji Mirza Akasi's countrymen to praise him for his enterprise was partly no doubt due to an equally shrewd appreciation on their part that new economic alignments emerging during his period as Prime Minister were not destined to enrich the people, but only to make a rapacious aristocracy more powerful, while the situation of the cultivator became little better than slavery.Avery, Modern Iran, p. 47. Shoghi Effendi, head of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in the first half of the 20th century, described Haji Mirza Aqasi as \"the Antichrist of the B\u00e1b\u00ed Revelation.\"Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, 164. == References == ==Sources== *Peter Avery, Modern Iran, Praeger, 1965. * * * Category:1783 births Category:1848 deaths Category:Prime Ministers of Iran Category:19th-century Iranian people Category:People from Maku * Amanat Abbas : \u00ab Iran, a modern history \u00bb, Yale University Press, 2017 ",
