The inscription dated first day of half moon Vai\u015b\u0101kha on the year 608 \u015aaka (28 February 686 CE), mentioned about the curse of whomever committed treason against Srivijaya and the beginning of Srivijayan invasion against Java. The inscription was first examined and dated by H. Kern, a Dutch epigrapher that worked for Bataviaasch Genootschap in Batavia. At first he thought that Srivijaya was the name of a king. George C\u0153d\u00e8s noted the name on the inscriptions was that of Srivijaya, a Buddhist kingdom in 638-86, \"that had just conquered the hinterland of Jambi and the island of Bangka and was preparing to launch a military expedition against Java.\" The name corresponds to Yijing's. ==Content== Kota Kapur inscriptions is one of the five inscriptions edicted by Sri Jayanasa, the ruler of Srivijaya.

The inscriptions was carved on a pinnacle stone with several sides, with 177 cm height, 32 cm width on base and 19 cm width on top. ==Significance== Kota Kapur inscription was the first Srivijayan inscription discovered, long before the discovery of the Kedukan Bukit Inscription on 29 November 1920, and before the Talang Tuwo inscription that was discovered several days earlier on 17 November 1920. The Kota Kapur inscription, together with other archaeological findings in the region, was the testament of Srivijaya era. It has opened a new horizon and revealed the history of Hindu-Buddhist era in that area. This inscription also uncovered the ancient society inhabiting the region during 6th and 7th century that clearly shows Hindu-Buddhist influence. == See also == * Kedukan Bukit Inscription * Telaga Batu inscription * Talang Tuwo inscription ==References== Category:Inscriptions in Indonesia Category:Malay inscriptions Category:Srivijaya Category:Bangka Belitung Islands Category:National Museum of Indonesia ",
