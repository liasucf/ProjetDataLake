The par\u00f3l is one of the most iconic and beloved symbols, of the Filipino holiday observance. Christmas in the Philippines (), one of two predominantly Catholic countries in Asia (the other one being East Timor), is one of the biggest holidays in the country. The country celebrates the world's longest Christmas season, with Christmas carols heard as early as September and lasting variously until either Epiphany, the Feast of the Black Nazarene on January 9, or the Feast of the Santo Ni\u00f1o on the third Sunday of January. The official observance by the Catholic Church in the Philippines is from the beginning of the Simbang Gabi on December 16 until the Feast of the Epiphany on the first Sunday after the New Year. Every year, Filipinos from around the world mark September 1 as the beginning of the countdown to Christmas. This countdown, which spans from September to December, otherwise known as the \"Ber Months\", is one of the most important traditions that makes the world's earliest and longest timespan of a Christmas season. The Christmas season gradually starts from September to December and ends in the third or fourth week of January. It is celebrated for almost half a year (4 months and 3\u20134 weeks or 5 months). Generally, holiday decorations are available as early as the National Heroes' Day weekend in August. But for the Iglesia Filipina Independiente or Aglipayans, Christmas starts on the eve of December 24 and ends on New Year's Day on January 1. ==Activities== The various ethnic groups in the Philippines each observe different Christmas traditions, and the following are generally common. == Christmas traditions == ===Simbang Gabi/Misa de Gallo=== Simbang Gabi (\"Night Mass\"; Spanish: Misa de Gallo, \"Rooster's Mass\", or Misa de Aguinaldo, \"Gift Mass\") is a novena of dawn Masses from December 16\u201324 (Christmas Eve). The Simbang Gabi is practised mainly by Catholic and Aglipayans, with some Evangelical Christian and independent Protestant churches having adopted the practise of having pre- Christmas dawn services. Attending the Masses is meant to show devotion to God and heightened anticipation for Christ's birth, and folk belief holds that God grants the special wish of a devotee that hears all nine Masses. Morning observance of Simbang Gabi this holiday begins as early as 03:00 PST, while in some parishes, anticipated Masses begin the previous evening at 20:00 PST or as early as 19:30 PST in others. After hearing Mass, Catholic families buy traditional Filipino holiday fare for breakfast outside the church and eat it either within the church precincts or at home. Vendors offer many native delicacies, including bibingka (rice flour and egg-based cake, cooked using coal burners above and under); put\u00f2 bumb\u00f3ng (a purple, sticky rice delicacy steamed in bamboo tubes, buttered then sprinkled with brown sugar and shredded dried coconut meat). Drinks include coffee, salab\u00e1t (ginger tea) and tsokolate (thick, Spanish-style hot chocolate). Some Aglipayan churches invite the congregation to partake of the \"pa\u00ednit\" (literally, \"heater\"), a post-Mass snack of mostly rice pastries served with coffee or cocoa at the house of the Mass sponsor. The bibingka and put\u00f2 bumb\u00f3ng are also served to those attending the anticipated evening Masses together with dinner. === Christmas Eve === For Filipinos, Christmas Eve (\"Bisperas ng Pasko\") on December 24 is celebrated with the Midnight Mass, and the traditional Noche Buena feast. Family members dine together at around midnight on traditional yuletide fare, which includes: queso de bola (Filipino Spanish for \"ball of cheese\", which is made of edam sealed in red paraffin wax); tsokol\u00e1te, noodles and pasta, fruit salad, pandesal, relleno and ham\u00f3n (Christmas ham). Some families would also open presents at this time. ====Panunul\u00fayan==== In different provinces and schools, the journey of Joseph and the pregnant Virgin Mary in search of lodging is re- enacted. The pageant, traditionally called the \"Panunul\u00fayan\", \"Pananaw\u00e1gan\", or \"Pananap\u00e1tan\", is modeled after the Spanish Las Posadas. The Panunul\u00fayan is performed after dark, with the actors portraying Joseph and the Virgin Mary going to pre-designated houses. They perform a chant meant to rouse the \"owners of the house\" (also actors) to request for lodging. The owners then cruelly turn them away, sometimes also in song, saying that their house is already filled with other guests. Finally, Joseph and Mary make their way to the parish church where a replica of the stable has been set up. The birth of Jesus is celebrated at midnight with the Misa de Gallo. ===Christmas Day=== Christmas Day in the Philippines is primarily a family affair. The Misa de Gallo is celebrated on December 25 and is usually one of several Masses that all family members (including non-churchgoers) are present. The Misa de Gallo is often celebrated between 10 pm and midnight, a schedule preferred by many Filipinos who stay up late on Christmas Eve for the night-long celebration of the Noche Buena. Preferably in the morning, Filipinos typically visit their extended family, especially to pay their respects to senior relatives. This custom of giving respect is enacted through the \"P\u00e1gmam\u00e1no\". A supplicant takes the back of an elder's hand and presses it against the forehead, while giving the greeting, M\u00e1no, p\u00f4 (lit. \"[Thy] hand, please\"). The elder often responds by reciting a blessing or simply acknowledging the gesture, and in return gives \"Aguinaldo\" or money in the form of crisp banknotes, often placed in a sealed envelope such as an ang pao. Godparents in particular are socially obligated to give presents or aguinaldo to their godchildren, to whom they often give larger amounts compared to other younger relatives. A festive lunch may follow the \"P\u00e1gmam\u00e1no\". The menu is heavily dependent upon the finances of the family, with richer families preparing grand feasts, while poorer families choose to cook simple yet special dishes. Some families choose to open presents on this day after the lunch. When nighttime falls, members of the family usually return home or linger to drink, play parlour games, and chat. Some may opt to have another feast for dinner, while a minority spend the entire day at home to rest after the previous days' festivities. ===Ni\u00f1os Inocentes=== Holy Innocents' Day or Childermas is commemorated on December 28 as Ni\u00f1os Inocentes. Filipinos once celebrated the day by playing practical jokes on one another, similar to April Fool's Day.http://www.philstar.com/funfare/article.aspx?articleid=536184&publicationsubcategoryid;=70 One of the widely practised pranks on this day is to borrow money without the intention of paying back. Creditors are usually helpless in getting remuneration from borrower, and are instead forewarned not to lend money on this day. Victims of such pranks were once called out, \"Na-Ni\u00f1os Inocentes ka!\" ===New Year's Eve=== On December 31 (Bisperas ng Bagong Ta\u00f3n), Filipino families gather for the Media Noche a lavish midnight feast that supposedly symbolises their hopes for prosperity in the coming year, and lasts until the following morning as with the Noche Buena taken on Christmas Eve. Filipinos make noise both to greet the New Year and in the belief that the din exorcises their surroundings of malevolent spirits. In spite of the yearly ban (due to the national government restrictions), people in most towns and cities customarily light firecrackers, or employ safer methods of merrymaking such as banging on pots and pans and blowing car horns. Other traditions and beliefs include encouraging children to jump at the stroke of midnight to increase their height; displaying circular fruit such as oranges; wearing clothes with dots and other circular designs to symbolise coins and money; eating twelve grapes at midnight for good luck in the twelve months of the year (a Spanish custom); and opening all windows and doors to let in the blessings on the first day of the year. ===Three Kings' Day=== Christmas officially ends on the Feast of the Epiphany, more commonly known as Three Kings' Day (Spanish: D\u00eda de los Tres Reyes; Tagalog: Araw ng Tatl\u00f3ng Har\u00ec), which falls on the first Sunday of January. A dying tradition is the Hispanic custom of children leaving their shoes out by the window or the door, so that the Three Kings can leave small gifts like candy or money inside upon their descent on Twelfth Night. ===Feast of the Black Nazarene=== The miraculous Black Nazarene, whose devotees are primarily centered in Manila and Cagayan de Oro, is borne in procession on January 9 after a novena in its honor. The date commemorates the image's 1787 Traslaci\u00f3n (solemn transfer) from its original location in what is now Rizal Park to its present shrine in the Quiapo District of the city. ===Feast of the Santo Ni\u00f1o=== The latest date for the end of popular Christmas celebrations is the Feast of the Santo Ni\u00f1o (Christ Child) on the third Sunday of January. The image depiction most associated with this day is the purportedly miraculous Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa, the first Christian icon brought to the islands. In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan came to Ceb\u00fa and gave the image as a present to Humamay, chief consort of the local monarch, Raja Humabon, when she, together with her husband and a number of his subjects, were baptised into the Catholic faith. Tradition holds that Humamay\u2014who received the Christian name Juana after Joan of Castile\u2014danced for joy upon receiving the Santo Ni\u00f1o, providing a legendary origin for the fervent religious dancing during the Sinulog held in honor of the Christ Child. Celebrations are mostly focused in Cebu, where the Sinulog Festival is held, while there are other celebrations held nationwide in its honor, including the Ati-Atihan Festival in Aklan Province, the Dinagyang in Ilolio, the Kahimunan in Butuan, and the feasts of the Holy Child in the districts of Tondo and Pandacan in Manila. The National Cathedral or the Central Church of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente or Aglipayans is dedicated to the Santo Ni\u00f1o and other several parishes and missions around the country. ===The Feast of Our Lady of the Candles=== In older traditions (which are still kept in the liturgical calendar of the Extraordinary Form of the Mass) Christmas lasted until Candlemas, or the Feast of the Purification of Mary and the Presentation of the Baby Jesus at the Temple. This marked the end of a long 40-day \"Christmastide\" corresponding to the 40 days of Lent. This date falls on February 2, after Mary had participated in a rite of purification in according to the ancient Candlemas festival rooted in Halakha (Jewish law). This is also when Simeon makes his well-known prophecy to Mary and Joseph about the Holy Child, of Jesus being a light for the Gentiles. Many parishes, if possible will still keep their nativity scenes displayed up until the celebration of the Presentation of the Lord on February 2. This final salvo is marked by the Feast of Our Lady of the Candles in Jaro, Iloilo City, where the image is enshrined in the Jaro Cathedral, the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Candles, where Tridentine Masses are celebrated in commemoration. Similar celebrations are held nationwide in towns where Our Lady of the Candles is its patroness, including Candelaria, Quezon, whose town fiesta is celebrated on this date. ==Decorations== Due to Americanisation, decorations such as Santa Claus, Christmas trees, tinsel, faux evergreens, reindeer, and snow have become popular. Christmas lights are strung about in festoons, as the tail of the Star of Bethlehem in Belens, star shapes, Christmas trees, angels, and in a large variety of other ways, going as far as draping the whole outside of the house in lights. Despite these, the Philippines still retains its traditional decorations. ===Par\u00f3l=== A par\u00f3l decorated with an intricate design, often lit during the evening Every Christmas season, Filipino homes and buildings are adorned with star-shaped lanterns, called par\u00f3l from the Spanish farol, meaning \"lantern\" or \"lamp\".'Merriam Webster \u2013 English English- Spanish Dictionary These lanterns represent the Star of Bethlehem that guided the Magi, also known as the Three Kings (Tagalog: Tatl\u00f3ng Har\u00ec). Parol are as beloved and iconic to Filipinos as Christmas trees are to Westerners. The most common form of the lantern is a 5-pointed star with two \"tails\" at the lower two tips. Other popular variations are four, eight, and ten-pointed stars, while rarer ones sport six, seven, nine, and more than twelve points. The earliest parols were made from simple materials like bamboo, Japanese rice paper (known as \"pap\u00e9l de Hap\u00f3n\") or cr\u00eape paper, and were lit by a candle or coconut oil lamp. Simple parols can be easily constructed with just ten bamboo sticks, paper, and glue. Present-day parol has endless possible shapes and forms and is made of a variety of materials, such as cellophane, plastic, rope, capiz shell, glass, and even recycled refuse. Parol-making is a folk craft, and many Filipino children often craft them as a school project or for leisure. The Giant Lantern Festival is an annual festival held the Saturday before Christmas Eve in the San Fernando City, Pampanga. The festival features a competition of giant lanterns, and the popularity of the festival, has earned the city the moniker, \"Christmas Capital of the Philippines\". ===Bel\u00e9n=== A Nativity Scene in Ibaan, Batangas Another traditional Filipino Christmas symbol is the bel\u00e9n\u2014a creche or tableau depicting the Birth of Christ. Derived from the Spanish name for Bethlehem, Bel\u00e9n, it depicts the infant Jesus in the manger, surrounded by the Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, the shepherds, their flock, the Magi and some stable animals, and is surmounted by an angel, the Star or both. Bel\u00e9n can be seen in homes, churches, schools and even office buildings; the ones on office buildings can be extravagant, using different materials for the figures and using Christmas lights, parols for the Star, and painted background scenery. A notable outdoor bel\u00e9n in Metro Manila is the one that used to be at the COD building in Cubao, Quezon City. In 2003, the bel\u00e9n was transferred to the Greenhills Shopping Center in San Juan when the COD building closed down. This bel\u00e9n is a lights and sounds presentation, the story being narrated over speakers set up and most probably using automatons to make the figures move up and down, or turn, etc. Each year, the company owning it changes the theme from the Nativity Story, with variations such as a fairground story, and Santa Claus' journey. Tarlac City, Tarlac is known as the \"Bel\u00e9n Capital of the Philippines\" holds the annual \"Belen\u00edsmo sa Tarlac\". It is a bel\u00e9n-making contest which is participated by establishments and residents in Tarlac. Giant versions of the bel\u00e9n with different themes are displayed in front of the establishments and roads of Tarlac for the entire season. ==Caroling== In the Philippines, children in small groups go from house to house singing Christmas carols, which they called pangangaroling. Makeshift instruments include tambourines made with tansans (aluminum bottle caps) strung on a piece of wire. With the traditional chant of \"Namamasko po!\", these carolers wait expectantly for the homeowners to reward them with coins. Afterward, the carolers thank the generous homeowners by singing \"Thank you, thank you, ang babait ninyo (you are so kind), thank you!\" An example of a traditional Filipino carol is a part of series known as \"Maligayang Pasko\", which is commonly called \"Sa maybahay ang aming bati\". The tradition of carols stems from the long years of Spanish rule, in which traditions practiced in Spanish Latin America during this time of the year were adopted to suit Philippine conditions. ==Aguinaldo== This is a word heard repeatedly during the Christmas Season in the Philippines. Presently, the term is interpreted as gift or money received from benefactors. Aguinaldo is a Spanish term for bonus. Its prevalent use may have originated from Filipino workers of the Spanish era, receiving extra pay from the generosity of the rich employers during the celebration of the Christmas season. ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Christmas in the Philippines *History of Philippine Parols *Traditional and Modern Philippine Parols Category:Philippine culture ",
