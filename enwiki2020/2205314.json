    "text": "AV8 Air was an airline based in the United Kingdom. It was established in June 2003 and started operations on 25 November 2003. It was launched as a subsidiary of tour operator CT2 and began operations on 7 April 2004 with a long-haul flight to Cape Town using a Boeing 767-300ER aircraft. The company operated the 767 on a damp lease basis from Icelandair until their own Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) was granted from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Unfortunately, due to a lack of a bond, the AOC was revoked. A Boeing 757-200 aircraft was intended for use on short-haul flights to Mediterranean resorts, but due to the unsuccessful AOC application, the aircraft was only operated on a weekly check flight around Manchester. The airline ceased trading after only five months. == Code data == *ICAO Code: MNF *Callsign: AV8 AV8 Air originally intended to use \"PENNINE\" as their ICAO callsign, but due to clashes with 'Peninne Radar' in the Manchester TMA, this was rejected. ==External links== *AV8 Air Former Fleet Detail Category:Defunct airlines of the United Kingdom Category:Airlines established in 2003 Category:Airlines disestablished in 2004 ",
