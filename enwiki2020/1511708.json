In 2005 McCafferty formed the Jo McCafferty Band to play with Amanda Palmer singer from The Dresden Dolls. The Band went on to play a couple of more times throughout the year, and brought a whole new sound to the usually acoustic material. In 2006 McCafferty was working on a new Band album called 'Overtaking on the Bend', and has seen her first foray into the world of soundtracks, recorded at her home studio. McCafferty supported Marillion again in Portsmouth on 9 June 2007, as well playing as a special guest in 2011 at their fanclub Convention in Port Zealande, in the Netherlands. On 11 May 2009 McCafferty finally entered a studio to record 'Overtaking on a Bend', working with longtime producer/engineer Grant Milne. The album is now available through McCafferty's site\u00b0\u00b0http://www.jomccafferty.com/shop.htm and she chronicled the making of the album through a blog. The cover art\u2033\u2033http://www.jomccafferty.com/artwork.htm and inside CD sleeve depicts a 1950s Raymond Chandleresque noir vibe and was designed by Stuart Mitchell who had previously designed the cover for Papercuts and Lime. The album 'Overtaking on a Bend' was officially released on 12 March 2010. Jo has played limited gigs since becoming a mother in 2012, but this included her first show back in November 2012 with Joan Armatrading. ==References== ==External links== *McCafferty's official web site including news, lyrics & shop. *McCafferty's official myspace site *McCafferty's Overtaking On A Bend Blog Category:People from Aberdeen Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
