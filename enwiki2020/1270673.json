    "text": "Christian Augustus Siebe (known by his middle name; 1788 - 15 April 1872) was a German-born British engineer chiefly known for his contributions to diving equipment. == Contribution to diving == Siebe's design, as refined by 1873. In the 1830s the Deane brothers asked Siebe to make a variation of their smoke helmet design for underwater use. Later they turned to him to produce more helmets for diving operations. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit. The real success of the equipment was a valve in the helmet. Colonel Charles Pasley, leader of the Royal Navy team that used Siebe's suit on the wreck of suggested the helmet should be detachable from the corset, giving rise to the typical standard diving dress which revolutionised underwater civil engineering, underwater salvage, commercial diving and naval diving. The company that carried his name Siebe Gorman Ltd was founded by him and his son-in-law, Gorman. He is commemorated by a blue plaque on his former home in Denmark Street, London.Images on Commons ==Other inventions== Besides his contributions to diving he also invented: *a rotating water pump patented in 1828, *A paper making machine, *a Dial weighing scale, *an ice-making machine. Siebe won many medals at the Great Exhibition in 1851 and the Paris Exhibition in 1855. He died 15 April 1872 of chronic bronchitis, at his London home. He was buried at the West Norwood Cemetery. ==See also== *Siebe Gorman == References == ==External links== *Historical Diving Society * * Category:1788 births Category:1872 deaths Category:British marine engineers Category:British underwater divers Category:Burials at West Norwood Cemetery Category:Deaths from bronchitis Category:Diving engineers Category:Place of birth missing ",
