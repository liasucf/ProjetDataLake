This particular tariqa (order) became the dominant Muslim spiritual group in medieval India and many of the most beloved and venerated Indian Sunni saintsSee Andrew Rippin (ed.), The Blackwell Companion to the Quran (John Wiley & Sons, 2008), p. 357.M. Ali Khan and S. Ram, Encyclopaedia of Sufism: Chisti Order of Sufism and Miscellaneous Literature (Anmol, 2003), p. 34. were Chishti in their affiliation, including Nizamuddin Awliya (d. 1325) and Amir Khusrow (d. 1325). As such, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn Chisht\u012b's legacy rests primarily on his having been \"one of the most outstanding figures in the annals of Islamic mysticism.\"Nizami, K.A., \"\u010cis\u0332h\u0332t\u012b\", in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Additionally Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn Chisht\u012b is also notable, according to John Esposito, for having been one of the first major Islamic mystics to formally allow his followers to incorporate the \"use of music\" in their devotions, liturgies, and hymns to God, which he did in order to make the foreign Arab faith more relatable to the indigenous peoples who had recently entered the religion or whom he sought to convert.John Esposito (ed.), The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (Oxford, 2004), p. 53 Others contest that the Chisti order ever permitted musical instruments and a famous Chisti, Nizamuddin Auliya, is quoted as stating that musical instruments are prohibited. He is very famous among the chishti sufis . Having arrived in Delhi during the reign of the sultan Iltutmish (d. 1236), Mu\u02bf\u012bn al- D\u012bn moved from Delhi to Ajmer shortly thereafter, at which point he became increasingly influenced by the writings of the famous Sunni Hanbali scholar and mystic \u02bfAbdall\u0101h An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b (d. 1088), whose famous work on the lives of the early Islamic saints, the \u1e6cab\u0101q\u0101t al-\u1e63\u016bfiyya, may have played a role in shaping Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn's worldview. It was during his time in Ajmer that Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn acquired the reputation of being a charismatic and compassionate spiritual preacher and teacher; and biographical accounts of his life written after his death report that he received the gifts of many \"spiritual marvels (kar\u0101m\u0101t), such as miraculous travel, clairvoyance, and visions of angels\"Mu\u1e25ammad b. Mub\u0101rak Kirm\u0101n\u012b, Siyar al-awliy\u0101\u02be, Lahore 1978, pp. 54-58. in these years of his life. Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn seems to have been unanimously regarded as a great saint after his passing. ==Life== Born in 1143 in Sistan, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn Chisht\u012b was a teenager when his father, Sayyid G\u0332h\u0332iy\u0101t\u0332h\u0332 al-D\u012bn (d. c. 1155), died, with the latter leaving his grinding mill and orchard to his son. His father, Ghayasuddin, and mother, Bibi Ummalwara (alias Bibi Mahe- Noor), were the descendants of Ali, through his sons Hassan and Hussain.Shah Baba, Nawab Gudri, Muinul Arwah\u02be (2009) He lost both his parents at an early age of sixteen years. Although he was initially hoping to continue his father's business, history says that he is very kind and open minded ,\" whence he soon began to develop strong contemplative and mystic tendencies in his personal piety. Soon after, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn gave away all of his financial assets, and began a life of destitute itineracy, wandering in search of knowledge and wisdom throughout the neighbouring quarters of the Islamic world. As such, he visited the famous seminaries of Bukhara and Samarkand, \"and acquired religious learning at the feet of eminent scholars of his age.\" It is also entirely probable that he visited the shrines of Muhammad al- Bukhari (d. 870) and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 944) during his travels in this region, who were both widely venerated figures in the Islamic world by this point in time. While travelling to Iraq, the young Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn encountered in the district of Nishapur the famous Sunni saint and mystic \u1e34h\u0332w\u0101j\u0332a \u02bfUt\u0332h\u0332m\u0101n (d. c. 1200), who initiated the willing seeker into his circle of disciples. Accompanying his spiritual guide for over twenty years on the latter's journeys from region to region, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn also continued his own independent spiritual travels during the time period. It was on his independent wanderings that Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn encountered many of the most notable Sunni mystics of the era, including Abdul-Qadir Gilani (d. 1166) and Najmuddin Kubra (d. 1221), as well as Naj\u0332\u012bb al-D\u012bn \u02bfAbd al-\u1e32\u0101hir Suhraward\u012b, Ab\u016b Sa\u02bf\u012bd Tabr\u012bz\u012b, and \u02bfAbd al-Wa\u1e25id G\u0332h\u0332aznaw\u012b (all d. c. 1230), all of whom were destined to become some of the most highly venerated saints in the Sunni tradition. Due to Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn's subsequent visits to \"nearly all the great centers of Muslim culture in those days,\" including Bukhara, Samarkand, Nishapur, Baghdad, Tabriz, Isfahan, Balkh, Ghazni, Astarabad, and many others, the preacher and mystic eventually \"acquainted himself with almost every important trend in Muslim religious life in the middle ages.\" ==Arrival in Lahore== Arriving in India in the early thirteenth century, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn first travelled to Lahore to meditate at the tomb-shrine of the famous Sunni mystic and jurist Ali Hujwiri (d. 1072), who was venerated by the Sunnis of the area as the patron saint of that city. From Lahore, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn continued forward on his journey towards Ajmer, which he reached prior to the city's conquest by the Ghurids. It was in Ajmer that Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn got married at an advanced age; and, according to the seventeenth-century chronicler \u02bfAbd al-\u1e24aqq Dihlaw\u012b (d. 1642), the mystic actually took two wives, one of whom was the daughter of a local Hindu raja. Having three sons\u2014Ab\u016b Sa\u02bf\u012bd, Fak\u0332h\u0332r al-D\u012bn and \u1e24us\u0101m al-D\u012bn by name\u2014and one daughter named B\u012bb\u012b Jam\u0101l, it so happened that only the latter inherited her father's mystic leanings, whence she too was later venerated as a saint in local Sunni tradition. After settling in Ajmer, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn worked at firmly establishing the Chishti order of Sunni mysticism in India, and many later biographic accounts relate the numerous miracles wrought by God at the hands of the saint during this period. ==Preaching in India== Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn Chisht\u012b was not the originator or founder of the Chishtiyya order of mysticism as he is often erroneously thought to be. On the contrary, the Chishtiyya was already an established Sufi order prior to his birth, being originally an offshoot of the older Adhamiyya order that traced its spiritual lineage and titular name to the early Islamic saint and mystic Ibrahim ibn Adham (d. 782). Thus, this particular branch of the Adhamiyya was renamed the Chishtiyya after the 10th-century Sunni mystic Ab\u016b Is\u1e25\u0101q al-Sh\u0101m\u012b (d. 942) migrated to Chishti Sharif, a town in the present-day Herat Province of Afghanistan in around 930, in order to preach Islam in that area. The order spread into the Indian subcontinent, however, at the hands of the Persian Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn in the 13th- century, after the saint is believed to have had a dream in which the Prophet Muhammad appeared and told him to be his \"representative\" or \"envoy\" in India.\u02bfAlaw\u012b Kirm\u0101n\u012b, Mu\u1e25ammad, Siyar al-awliy\u0101\u02be, ed. I\u02bfj\u0101z al-\u1e24aqq Qudd\u016bs\u012b (Lahore, 1986), p. 55Firishtah, Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim, T\u0101r\u012bkh (Kanpur, 1301/1884), 2/377D\u0101r\u0101 Shuk\u016bh, Mu\u1e25ammad, Saf\u012bnat al-awliy\u0101\u02be (Kanpur, 1884), p. 93. According to the various chronicles, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn's tolerant and compassionate behavior towards the local population seems to have been one of the major reasons behind conversion to Islam at his hand.Rizvi, Athar Abbas, A History of Sufism in India (New Delhi, 1986), I/pp. 116-125Nizami, Khaliq Ahmad, '\u1e62\u016bf\u012b Movement in the Deccan', in H. K. Shervani, ed., A History of Medieval Deccan, vol. 2 (Hyderabad, 1974), pp. 142-147. Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn Chisht\u012b is said to have appointed Bakhtiar Kaki (d. 1235) as his spiritual successor, who worked at spreading the Chishtiyya in Delhi. Furthermore, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn's son, Fakhr al- D\u012bn (d. 1255), is said to have further spread the order's teachings in Ajmer, whilst another of the saint's major disciples, \u1e24am\u012bd al-D\u012bn \u1e62\u016bf\u012b N\u0101gawr\u012b (d. 1274), preached in Nagaur, Rajasthan. ==Spiritual lineage== 19th century die with the genealogy of the Chishti Order As with every other major Sufi order, the Chishtiyya proposes an unbroken spiritual chain of transmitted knowledge going back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad through one of his Companions, which in the Chishtiyya's case is Ali (d. 661). Thus, Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn Chisht\u012b's spiritual lineage is traditionally given as follows: # Muhammad. # \u02bfAl\u012b b. Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib (d. 661), # \u1e24asan al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b (d. 728), # Abdul Wahid bin Zaid (d. 786), # al-Fu\u1e0dayl b. \u02bfIy\u0101\u1e0d (d. 803), # Ibrahim ibn Adham al-Balkh\u012b (d. 783), # \u1e24udhayfa al-Mar\u02bfash\u012b (d. 890), # Abu Hubayra al-Basri (d. 900), # Khwaja Mumshad Uluw Al D\u012bnawar\u012b(d. 911), # Abu Ishaq Shami (d. 941), # Abu A\u1e25mad Abdal Chishti (d. 966), # Abu Mu\u1e25ammad Chishti (d. 1020), # Abu Yusuf ibn Saman Mu\u1e25ammad Sam\u02bf\u0101n Chisht\u012b (d. 1067), # Maudood Chishti (d. 1133), # Shareef Zandani (d. 1215), # Usman Harooni (d. 1220), # Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn Chisht\u012b, ==Dargah Sharif== Dargah of Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn Chisht\u012b, Ajmer, Rajasthan, India The tomb (darg\u0101h) of Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn became a deeply venerated site in the century following the preacher's death in March 1236. Honoured by members of all social classes, the tomb was treated with great respect by many of the era's most important Sunni rulers, including Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultan of Delhi from 1324\u20131351, who paid a famous visit to the tomb in 1332 to commemorate the memory of the saint.\u02bfAbd al-Malik \u02bfI\u1e63\u0101m\u012b, Fut\u016b\u1e25 al-sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn, ed. A. S. Usha, Madras 1948, p. 466. In a similar way, the later Mughal emperor Akbar (d. 1605) visited the shrine no less than fourteen times during his reign.Ab\u016b l-Fa\u1e0dl, Akbar-n\u0101ma, ed. \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25\u012bm, 3 vols., Calcutta 1873\u201387. In the present day, the tomb of Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn continues to be one of the most popular sites of religious visitation for Sunni Muslims in the Indian subcontinent, with over \"hundreds of thousands of people from all over the Indian sub-continent assembling there on the occasion of [the saint's] \u02bfurs or death anniversary.\" Additionally, the site also attracts many Hindus, who have also venerated the Islamic saint since the medieval period. A bomb blast on 11 October 2007 in the Dargah of Sufi Saint Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti at the time of Roza Iftaar had left three pilgrims dead and 15 injured. A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Jaipur punished with life imprisonment the two convicts in the 2007 Ajmer Dargah bomb blast case.https://m.timesofindia.com/india/life-sentence-to-two-in-ajmer-dargah- blast-case/articleshow/57773081.cms ==Popular culture== A song in the 2008 film Jodhaa Akbar named \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja,\" composed by A. R. Rahman, pays tribute to Mu\u02bf\u012bn al-D\u012bn Chisht\u012b. Various qawalis have been portrayed ample of melodies and famous Qawalas including Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Sahab's Khwaja E khwajgan and The Sabri Brothers Khawaja Ki Deewani. ==See also== * Index of Sufism-related articles * List of Sufis * Ajmer Dargah bombing * Ali Hujwiri * Ata Hussain Fani Chishti * Alaul Haq Pandavi * Urs festival, Ajmer ==References== Category:13th-century Iranian people Category:Dargahs in India Category:Indian Sufis Category:Indian people of Arab descent Category:Sufi shrines in India Category:1143 births Category:1236 deaths Category:12th- century Iranian people Category:Hashemite people Category:Sufi poets Category:History of Ajmer Category:Chishti Order Category:Muslim saints Category:Indian male philosophers Category:People from Sistan ",
