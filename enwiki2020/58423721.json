    "text": "Ashaar Baghdad (English: Baghdad's Poetry) is a public monument in Baghdad, created by the sculptor, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat (1929-2011) and inaugurated in 2013. It appears as a golden globe, bearing Arabic letters that have been squeezed together and distorted to form the spherical shape. It is an unusual example of hurufiyya-inspired sculpture. ==Background== In 2010, the Mayor of Baghdad commissioned the sculptor, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, to complete a series of four monuments as part of a Baghdad Culture program. The artist began work on four new sculptures to be erected in various locations around Baghdad. However, this would be his final project, for the sculptor died before it was completed. Ghani's son oversaw the completion of the project.Floyd, T., \"Mohammed Ghani Hikmat,\" [Biographical Notes], Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: All four works blended Iraqi tradition with modern techniques and materials.
