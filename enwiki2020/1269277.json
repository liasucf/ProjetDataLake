Hetmans typically added an image of a bu\u0142awa to their coats of arms. Today the bu\u0142awa appears in the rank insignia of a Marshal of Poland. ==Ukraine== In the Ukrainian language, a \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 (bulava) is a mace or club, in both the military and ceremonial senses. The bulava was part of the Ukrainian Cossack kleinody (\"jewels\") that were awarded by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky to the Zaporizhian Host. Definition of kleinody in the Handbook of the History of Ukraine Historically the bulava was an attribute of a hetman, an officer of the highest military rank, and of the Otaman of Ukraine or the military head of a Cossack state (Cossack Hetmanate). Under the Ukrainian People's Republic, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Army was called the \"General Bulava\". The bulava is now an official emblem of the President of Ukraine, and is housed in Ukraine's Vernadsky National Library. ==Gallery== File:Jan Zamoyski.jpg|Hetman Zamoyski, in crimson delia and blue \u017cupan, holding hetman's bu\u0142awa File:Rydz Smigly Bulawa1.jpg|Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y (right) receiving marshal's bu\u0142awa from Polish President Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki, Warsaw, 10 November 1936 File:Bulawa.PNG|Coat-of-arms (two crossed bu\u0142awas) of a Polish hetman File:Bulawa of Field Crown Hetman Marcin Kalinowski.PNG|Bu\u0142awa of Crown Field Hetman Kalinowski File:\u0411\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0425\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e.jpg|Bulava of Ukraine's Hetman Khmelnytsky, 17th century file:Bulawas.jpg|Toy bulavas in a Kyiv market File:Drevnosti_RG_v3_ill086c_-_Bulat_Bulawa_Moscowian.jpg|17th- century Russian bulat steel bulava ==See also== * Pernach * Polish heraldry * RSM-56 Bulava ==References== Category:Ceremonial weapons Category:Clubs (weapon) * * Category:Regalia of Ukraine Category:Marshals of Poland Category:Presidency of Ukraine Category:Military organization of Cossacks Category:Political symbols ",
