Aksu's influence on Turkish pop and world music has continued since her debut in 1975, and has been reinforced by her patronage of and collaboration with many other musicians, including Sertab Erener, \u015eebnem Ferah, A\u015fk\u0131n Nur Yengi, Hande Yener, Y\u0131ld\u0131z Tilbe, I\u015f\u0131n Karaca, Seden G\u00fcrel, Harun Kol\u00e7ak and Levent Y\u00fcksel. Sezen Aksu is widely known as a successful songwriter. Her work with Tarkan resulted in continental hits like \"\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k\" and \"\u015e\u0131k\u0131d\u0131m\" and her collaboration with Goran Bregovi\u0107 widened her international audience. In 2010, NPR named her as one of the \"50 Great Voices\" of the world. == Biography == Sezen Aksu was born in Sarayk\u00f6y, Denizli, Turkey. Her father was a mathematics teacher. Her family moved to Bergama when she was three years old and she spent her childhood and early youth there. Aksu's parents discouraged her singing because they wanted her to have a steady profession as a doctor or engineer. She used to wait until they left the house and sing on the family's balcony. After finishing high school, she began studying at the local agricultural institute, but left college to concentrate on music. Along with her close friend Ajda Pekkan, Aksu is credited with laying the foundations of Turkish pop music in the 1970s.Aksu's expressive vocal technique, distinctive songwriting, and prolific output were all integral to her success and to the development of a unique Turkish pop sound. Many musicians--for example, Alexander Hacke and several of the artists he interviewed for the documentary Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul --have acknowledged Sezen Aksu's broad influence. Her sound has also spread across the Balkans and Greece.With the Greek diaspora from Turkey in the seventies, many brought their musical tastes, which included Aksu's music to Greece; the Greek musicians Haris Alexiou and Giorgos Dalaras acknowledge her influence. Aksu has also toured in Europe and the U.S to critical appraise. She has championed a variety of causes, including support for constitutional reform, minority rights, women's rights, the environment, and educational reform in Turkey. Aksu has been married and divorced four times, but kept the name from her second marriage to Ali Engin Aksu, a doctor of geology who currently resides in Canada. She has a son with Sinan \u00d6zer, named Mithat Can, who is also a lead vocalist of Pist'on band. == Career == ===1975\u20131983: Early life and career beginnings=== Sezen Aksu released her first single, Haydi \u015eans\u0131m/Gel Bana in 1975 under the name of \"Sezen Seley\". However, she remained undiscovered until her 1976 single Olmaz Olsun/Vurdumduymaz reached number one in the Turkish charts. In 1976, Sezen Aksu won the \"Promising Female Artist of the Year\" award. Her first album was 1978's Ser\u00e7e, which earned her a famous nickname, first penned by a Turkish journalist. Aksu finally decided to represent Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest in the mid-70s. However, even though she competed in the national finals for the competition three times, with K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Bir A\u015fk Masal\u0131 (A Little Love Tale) as a duet with \u00d6zdemir Erdo\u011fan, \"Heyamola\" which was performed as a trio with Co\u015fkun Demir and Ali Kocatepe, and 1945 which was a solo performance, she did not get the chance to represent Turkey abroad. It was to be left to her pupil, Sertab Erener, to win the Eurovision and realise Aksu's dream to push her musical vision further into Europe. ===1980s=== In the 80's, Aksu had a relationship with producer Onno Tun\u00e7 that was both romantic and professional. As a couple they put their signatures to works that broke new ground in Turkish pop music, such as Sen A\u011flama, Git, Sezen Aksu'88 and Sezen Aksu S\u00f6yl\u00fcyor. Her music matured in the 90's, when she co-produced her best selling album to-date G\u00fcl\u00fcmse with Tun\u00e7. The A-1 track from the album called Hadi Bakal\u0131m was a hit in Turkey and Europe, and was published as a single in Germany. It was to be later rediscovered in Europop by singer Loona as Rhythm of the Night. She also began to produce albums for her vocalists, notably producing A\u015fk\u0131n Nur Yengi's debut album Sevgiliye (To a Lover) again with Tun\u00e7. She was to repeat her success as a teacher with artists Sertab Erener and Levent Y\u00fcksel. ===1990s\u2013present=== Parting ways with Tun\u00e7, in 1995, Aksu branched out with the experimental album I\u015f\u0131k Do\u011fudan Y\u00fckselir, drawing both on western classical and regional Turkish musical traditions. This album made her name known outside Turkey and gave her a worldwide audience, especially in Europe. In 1996, she released D\u00fc\u015f Bah\u00e7eleri as a tribute to Tun\u00e7, who died that same year tragically when his private plane crashed. In 1997, she released D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn ve Cenaze, this time collaborating with Goran Bregovic. She returned to her roots with Ad\u0131 Bende Sakl\u0131, which was released in 1998. She began to use experimental sounds and was once again pushing Turkish pop into the future. Aksu continued with this trend with her subsequent albums Deliveren, \u015eark\u0131 S\u00f6ylemek Laz\u0131m (which also featured former Sparks bassist Martin Gordon as engineer/mixer, who also was bass player on her subsequent European tour), and Yaz Bitmeden between the years 2000\u20132003. After a two-year hiatus, she returned with Bahane in 2005. That same year she released Kardelen, where all proceeds went to charity, and before the end of 2005 released a Bahane/Remixes double-CD album, which contained the original Bahane album in disc one and the remixes of songs in disc two.

In 2009 she refused to support Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan's democratic initiative, and supported the settlement process in Turkey.
