John Kerry and Salem Al-Ismaily knew each other during the hikers negotiations, and Kerry had made several visits to Oman in 2011 and early 2012. \u201cIn his zeal to jump-start the negotiations, Kerry passed several messages to the Iranians through Ismaily,\u201d according to Mark Landler. \u201cWithin the first five minutes of meeting Salem,\u201d recalls Kerry, \u201cI realized that his objective extended beyond the hikers. We spoke of the importance of getting Josh and Shane home swiftly but he turned quickly to the potential for progress on other fronts as well. At the top of the list was Iran\u2019s current path to a nuclear weapon.\u201d \u201cSalem made clear to me during that first meeting that Sultan Qaboos felt he could be helpful in advancing a mutually agreeable solution. It was also clear that the Omanis were not acting only out of goodwill; they knew that a nuclear-armed Iran would fundamentally undermine the stability of the region\", stated Kerry. \u201cAnd they were concerned, as we were, that Tehran was getting closer and closer to a weapon. Shane and Josh were finally released in September 2011, thanks in large part to Oman\u2019s efforts. In my view, and in the view of many in the Obama administration, including President Obama himself, Sultan Qaboos had proven his seriousness and his sway with the Iranians...\" \u201cHaving proven their bona fides, I believed it was appropriate to see if they could help bridge the communications divide with the Iranians. We needed greater insight into their thinking. We needed to better assess the possibilities. Salem and I began to talk regularly, both on the phone and, from time to time, in person...\" \"There was general agreement that, given the success of the hikers\u2019 release, it was worth at least exploring the potential for progress on the nuclear front.
