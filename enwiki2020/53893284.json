    "text": "Dabi\u017eiv \u010cihori\u0107 (; 1334 \u2013 died January 1362) was a Serbian nobleman who served king and emperor Stefan Du\u0161an (r. 1331\u201355) and emperor Uro\u0161 V (r. 1355\u201371), with the title of sluga. He was not a usual sluga (a cup-bearer), but had the same responsibilities as those of the kaznac and tep\u010dija. A member of the \u010cihori\u0107 family (also called Drugovi\u0107), a powerful family in the Trebinje region, his brothers Vratko and Nenac held the title of \u017eupan (count), while Stepko held the title of tep\u010dija. Dabi\u017eiv was present in the hinterland of Dubrovnik between 1334 and 1349, but was first mentioned with the title of sluga in 1343 (Dabiseo sluga)., That mention is of him together with the Ragusan rector Marco Mauroceno and \"elders\" (starce) established boundaries between territories of the Republic of Ragusa and Trebinje, that is, the Kingdom of Serbia. In 1345 the Ragusan ministers complained to Stefan Du\u0161an that Dabi\u017eiv had imposed a customs tax at Trebinje, one dinar per each goods load that passed by. Stefan Du\u0161an abolished this tax, as known from a letter dated 26 October 1346 sent from Serres. Dabi\u017eiv's competences is explained as that he acted as the royal deputy in Trebinje and Konavle. Earlier, in 1330, the governor of Konavle and the wider area of Trebinje was \u017eupan Hlapen. It is assumed that Dabi\u017eiv was part of the preparations of organizing a special court of \"young king\" Uro\u0161 V, that while he governed Trebinje he was decided to be the sluga of Uro\u0161 V. In 1346, Uglje\u0161a Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 became the deputy in Trebinje and Konavle. After the coronation of Stefan Du\u0161an as emperor (1346), when Uro\u0161 V became king and co-ruler, Dabi\u017eiv left Trebinje to be in the nearest circle of Uro\u0161 V, whom he served faithfully until his death in January 1362. Dabi\u017eiv was buried at the Treskavac monastery near Prilep, his grave inscription mentioning him as the enohijar (which according to S. Novakovi\u0107 was the brewer or cellarer, that is, a cup-bearer, ) of emperor Uro\u0161 V. Dabi\u017eiv \u010cihori\u0107 \"the younger\" (fl. 1383\u20131402), a nobleman in Popovo, was Dabi\u017eiv's relative, likely nephew (as the son of Nenac). ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * Category:14th-century Serbian nobility Category:Medieval Serbian magnates Category:People of the Serbian Empire Category:People of the Kingdom of Serbia (medieval) Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1362 deaths Category:Trebinje Category:Medieval Herzegovina Category:History of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina ",
