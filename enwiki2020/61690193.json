    "text": "Clive Enoch Davis (born 17 September 1949) is a former Welsh international rugby union player. Davis played his entire first-class career at Newbridge RFC, gaining county, invitational and International honours whilst doing so. Davis made his debut for Newbridge on 16 November 1968 against Cheltenham. He was a mainstay in the club throughout the decade, captaining them for three seasons. It wasn\u2019t until the season of 1977-78 that Davis made his break onto the international scene. The season was full of honours. He became Newbridge\u2019s first \u2018\u2019B\u2019\u2019 international, playing for Wales B against France in Nantes. He was then selected for the annual Barbarians Easter tour. Davis went on to represent the famous invitational club on eight occasions throughout his career, scoring two tries. The 1978 season ended with the news that Davis had been selected for the 1978 Wales rugby union tour of Australia with the full Welsh side. Davis represented the Welsh team in five games during the tour. He was to win his long overdue cap during the final game of the tour, the 2nd test match played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The Welsh back row had a different look about it, J. P. R. Williams was on one flank with Stuart Lane on the other, Davis took on the No 8 responsibilities. The match was very physical with several brawls taking place, resulting in the Wales prop Graham Price having his jaw broken. Australia won the game by 19 points to 17. Davis kept his place in the Wales squad for the next two seasons but did not get a chance to show his skills on the field. At the end of the 1979-80 season he was selected to tour North America with the Welsh XV. During the tour he played in four games, this included the uncapped tests against both the USA and Canada. The 1980-81 season was the Welsh Rugby Union\u2019s centenary season. Davis once again found himself in the Welsh squad. He won his second cap in the first game of the championship, against England at the National Stadium in Cardiff. The match was a close affair with the boot dominating. Wales won the game 21-19 with Davis scoring the only Welsh try of the game, the first time a Newbridge player had scored in a full international. The team that travelled to Murrayfield was unchanged, however a poor performance saw Scotland run out winners by 18 points to 6. The defeat brought about several changes and ended the international careers of J. P. R. Williams, Steve Fenwick, Brynmor Williams and Clive Davis. Davis retired at the end of the 1982-83 season. The season ended with a tour to France representing another invitational team, Crawshays RFC. After retiring David went on to coach Oakdale, Newbridge and Ebbw Vale.
