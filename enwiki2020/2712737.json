Here is another mining village, of about one thousand population. The street cars from Pittsburg reach this town, and the Missouri Pacific and Santa Fe Railroads pass through this place. Several stores, a postoffice, boarding houses and other conveniences accommodate the people. Most of the inhabitants are of foreign birth, the Italian race predominating. The people are nearly all coal miners, and work for the several coal companies operating about Chicopee. They have good schools, which are well attended, and the children of these foreign born people are quick to get learning, and soon become excellent business men and women. ;In 1912 Chicopee was described: As one of the principal towns of Crawford county, is located in Baker township, 13 miles southeast of Girard, the county seat, and 4 miles southwest of Pittsburg. It is in the coal fields, and the chief occupation of the people is mining and shipping coal, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe and the Missouri Pacific railroads (now abandoned before 2007) furnishing excellent transportation facilities. The town has a money order postoffice, telegraph and telephone facilities, Catholic and Protestant churches, good public schools, some well stocked stores, and in 1910 reported a population of 955. The post office opened June 10, 1889, closed September 30, 1892, reopened October 8, 1892, and reclosed March 30, 1918.
