    "text": "Professor Else \u00d8yen was educated as a sociologist. ==Education and career== She became professor of social policy in 1975 at the University of Bergen, Norway, and shifted her later research focus to comparative poverty studies within an interdisciplinary framework. She initiated the Comparative Research Programme on Poverty (CROP) in 1991. In a few years it became one of the major programmes under the International Social Science Council (ISSC). The foremost aim of CROP was to provide a scientific framework for the understanding of the many facets of poverty and to create an international arena where poverty researchers from different regions and disciplines could meet and exchange experiences. ==Research== \u00d8yen, through her research on poverty, has been responsible for developing the notion of poverty production. This according to \u00d8yen is the fourth phase of understanding and reducing poverty. It follows the first stage; tale telling, the second stage; client focused and development research, and the third stage, knowledge building about poverty reduction. According to Oyen, the subsequent and fourth stage of research then should be that of poverty production which entails \"understanding the processes that produce poverty and continue to produce poverty at a rate no present poverty reducing measures can possibly win over or even compete with production\".\u00d8yen, E. (2004). Poverty production: a different approach to poverty understanding. In Advances in Sociological Knowledge (pp. 299-315). VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften \u00d8yen notes the role of vocabulary as the term 'poverty production' implies that there are actors involved in producing poverty. It is thus necessary, in order to reduce poverty, to identify these actors and to examine their motivations. Despite this however, \u00d8yen is careful to mention that such an exercise must not be a witch hunt as the purpose of identification is not punishment. ==Personal life== She was married to sociologist \u00d8rjar \u00d8yen from 1957 to 1988. ==Bibliography== *Poverty: A Global Review : Handbook on International Poverty Research ed. by Syed Abdus Samad( Book ) 21 editions published between 1996 and 2003 d and held by 517 libraries worldwide *Comparative methodology: Theory and Practice in International Social Research by Else \u00d8yen 1990 and 1992 Held by 487 libraries worldwide according to WorldCatWorldCat identities ==References== ==External links== *bora.uib.no *bristol.ac.uk *bora.uib.no Category:Living people Category:Norwegian sociologists Category:University of Bergen faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
