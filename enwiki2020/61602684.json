    "text": "LGA 1200 is an Intel microprocessor compatible socket for Comet Lake desktop CPUs which was released in Q2 2020. LGA 1200 is designed as a replacement for the LGA 1151 (known as Socket H4). LGA 1200 is a land grid array mount with 1200 protruding pins to make contact with the pads on the processor. It uses a modified design of LGA 1151, with 49 more pins on it, improving power delivery and offering support for future incremental I/O features. Pin 1 position remains the same as it was in previous generation processors, but it has shifted socket keying to left (previously it was right), making Comet Lake processors incompatible both electrically and mechanically with previous chips. According to Gigabyte its motherboards based on the Intel Z490 chipset support future unreleased and not yet formally announced 11th generation Intel desktop Rocket Lake CPUs. https://www.techpowerup.com/266495/gigabyte-says- intel-z490-chipset-motherboards-will-support-11th-gen-rocket-lake-s Other motherboard vendors have neither confirmed nor denied this information. == Heatsink == Pads of an Intel Core i9 10900K The 4 holes for fastening the heatsink to the motherboard are placed in a square with a lateral length of 75 mm for Intel's sockets LGA 1156, LGA 1155, LGA 1150, LGA 1151 and LGA 1200. Cooling solutions should therefore be interchangeable. == Comet Lake chipsets (400 series) == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" !scope=\"col\" width=\"16%\" | !scope=\"col\" width=\"14%\" | H410 !scope=\"col\" width=\"14%\" | B460 !scope=\"col\" width=\"14%\" | H470 !scope=\"col\" width=\"14%\" | Q470 !scope=\"col\" width=\"14%\" | Z490 !scope=\"col\" width=\"14%\" | W480 |- !Overclocking | colspan=\"3\" | | | |- !CPU support | colspan=\"5\" |Comet Lake S / Rumored: Rocket Lake |Comet Lake Workstation Xeon W |- !Memory support | colspan=\"6\" |Dual channel DDR4-2666 or DDR4-2933, up to 128GiB using 32GiB memory modules |- !Maximum DIMM slots |2 | colspan=\"5\" |4 |- !Maximum USB 2.0 ports |10 |12 | colspan=\"4\" |14 |- !USB 3.2 ports configuration |Up to 4 Gen 1x1 (5Gb/s) |Up to 8 Gen 1x1 (5Gb/s) |Up to 4 Gen 2x1 (10Gb/s) Up to 8 Gen 1x1 (5Gb/s) | colspan=\"2\" |Up to 6 Gen 2x1 (10Gb/s) Up to 10 Gen 1x1 (5Gb/s) |Up to 8 Gen 2x1 (10Gb/s) Up to 10 Gen 1x1 (5Gb/s) |- !Maximum SATA 3.0 ports |4 | colspan=\"4\" |6 |8 |- !Processor PCI Express v3.0 configuration | colspan=\"3\" |1 x 16 | colspan=\"3\" |1x16 or 2x8 or 1x8+2x4 |- !PCH PCI Express configuration |6 |16 |20 | colspan=\"3\" |24 |- !Independent Display Support (digital ports/pipes) |2 | colspan=\"5\" |3 |- !Integrated Wireless (802.11ax) | colspan=\"2\" | colspan=\"4\" |- !SATA RAID 0/1/5/10 support | rowspan=\"3\" | colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"3\" |- !Intel Optane Memory Support |- !Intel Smart Sound Technology |- !Intel Active Management, Trusted Execution and vPro Technology | colspan=\"3\" | | | |- !Chipset TDP | colspan=\"6\" |6W |- !Chipset lithography | | | | | | |- !Release date | colspan=\"6\" |Q2 2020 |} * depends on OEM's implementation == Rocket Lake chipsets (500 series) == == See also == * List of Intel microprocessors * List of Intel chipsets == References == Category:Intel CPU sockets Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020 ",
