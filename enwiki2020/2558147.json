On 6 October 1970, responding to requests from the local community and the efforts of a group of practicing accountants who aspired to obtain the university degree, a Program of Public Accounting began in Cali. This was the origin of the Cali branch of the Javeriana University. On 20 November 1978 the board proposed the name Cali Branch, with headquarters in the capital under the same organization and higher authorities. The board of regents, at the request of the board, adopted the name Cali Branch. Today, this branch is one of the most prestigious universities in Cali. The campus of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali is located in the south of the city, in Pance, at the foot of the Farallones de Cali, part of the Cordillera Occidental (Colombia), in a totally rural environment where vegetation and fauna abound. The campus consists of eight buildings (Las Palmas, Guayacanes, classrooms block, administration, Saman, Almendros, continuing education, and the recently opened Las Acacias). Two more buildings are being built on campus, which features five caf\u00e9s, the Javeriana Shop, a large parking lot surrounding the entire campus, a branch of Corpbanca, a center of the Colombia Stock Exchange, and an MBA extension of Temple University Fox School of Business and Management.
