Borneo rainforest Some categories of tropical forest types are difficult. While forests in temperate areas are readily categorised on the basis of tree canopy density, such schemes do not work well in tropical forests. There is no single scheme that defines what a forest is, in tropical regions or elsewhere.Anatoly Shvidenko, Charles Victor Barber, Reidar Persson et al. 2005 \"Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.\" Ecosystems and human wellbeing: a framework for assessment Washington, DC: Island Press Because of these difficulties, information on the extent of tropical forests varies between sources. However, Tropical Forests are extensive, making up just under half the world\u2019s forests. D\u2019Annunzio, R\u00e9mi, Lindquist, Erik J., MacDicken, Kenneth G. 2017 \u201cGlobal forest land-use change from 1990 to 2010:an update to a global remote sensing survey of forests Forest Resource Assessment Working Paper 187\u201d FAO, Rome.The tropical domain has the largest proportion of the world\u2019s forests (45 percent), followed by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains. More than 3.6m hectares of virgin tropical forest was lost in 2018. Human society under urgent threat from loss of Earth's natural life. Scientists reveal 1 million species at risk of extinction in damning UN report 6 May 2019 Guardian ==Types of tropical forest== Tropical forests are often thought of as evergreen rainforests and moist forests, but these account only a portion of them (depending on how they are defined - see maps). The remaining tropical forests are a diversity of many different forest types including: Eucalyptus open forest, tropical coniferous forests, savanna woodland (e.g. Sahelian forest), and mountain forests (the higher elevations of which are cloud forests). Over even relatively short distances, the boundaries between these biomes may be unclear, with ecotones between the main types. Tropical forest ecological zones (FAO) Tropical forest land from the UN FO FRA2000 report Tropical climate sub-types ( K\u00f6ppen classification): The nature of tropical forest in any given area is affected by a number of factors, most importantly: * Geographical: location and climatic zone (see sub-types), with: **Precipitation levels and seasonality, with strong dry seasons significantly affecting flora (e.g. the predominance of lianas); **Temperature profile, which is relatively even in equatorial rainforest or with a cooler season towards subtropical latitudes; **Elevation affects the above, often creating \"ecological islands\" with high endemism (e.g. Mount Kinabalu in the Borneo rainforest). * Historical: prehistoric age of forest and level of recent disturbance (see threats), changing primary (usually maximum biodiversity) into secondary forest, degenerating into bamboo forest after prolonged swidden agriculture (e.g. in several areas of Indo-China). * Soil characteristics (also subject to various classifications): including depth and drainage.Schulte, A, Ruhiyat D (Eds.) (1998) Soils of Tropical Forest Ecosystems: Characteristics, Ecology and Management. Springer, 204 pp. ===The Global 200 scheme=== The Global 200 scheme, promoted by the World Wildlife Fund, classifies three main tropical forest habitat types (biomes), grouping together tropical and sub-tropical areas (maps below): * Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, * Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, * Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests.

Studies have also shown that ongoing climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of some climate extremes (e.g. droughts, heatwaves and hurricanes) which, in combination with other local human disturbances, are driving unprecendented negative ecological consequences for tropical forests around the world. All tropical forests have experienced at least some levels of disturbance.Robin L. Chazdon 2003 \u201cTropical forest recovery: legacies of human impact and natural disturbances\u201d Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics 6/1,2, pp. 51\u201371 A study in Borneo describes how, between 1973 and 2018, the old-growth forest had been reduced from 76% to 50% of the island, mostly due to fire and agricultural expansion.Gaveau DLA (2016) What a difference 4 decades make: Deforestation in Borneo since 1973 CIFOR (retrieved 29 October 2017) A widely-held view is that placing a value on the ecosystem services these forests provide may bring about more sustainable policies. However, clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for environmental, social and economic outcomes are needed. For example, a study in Vietnam indicated that poor and inconsistent data combined with a lack of human resources and political interest (thus lack of financial support) are hampering efforts to improve forest land allocation and a Payments for Forest Environmental Services scheme.Pham TT, Le ND, Vu TP, Nguyen HT, Nguyen VT (2016) Forest land allocation and payments for forest environmental services in four northwestern provinces of Vietnam: From policy to practice CIFOR (retrieved 29 October 2017) ==See also== *Tropical rainforest *Gallery forest *Savanna *Seasonal tropical forest *Primary forest *Secondary forest == Sources == ==References== ==External links== * Category:Ecosystems Category:Biodiversity Category:Wilderness_areas Category:Forests Category:Old-growth forests Category:Types of formally designated forests Category:Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands ",
