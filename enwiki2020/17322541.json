    "text": "Picasso & Lump: A Dachshund's Odyssey () is a 2006 book by David Douglas Duncan that features professional photographs of Pablo Picasso and his dachshund, Lump. The book, published by Thames & Hudson Ltd, gives an insight into Picasso's later life, and Picasso the man, not the image. The book contrasts black-and-white photos of Picasso, his wife Jacqueline, and Lump with Picasso's colourful interpretations, which feature Lump, of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's 1656 painting Las Meninas. The book is alternatively known as, Lump: The Dog Who Ate a Picasso. ==References== * Category:Photographic collections and books Category:Art history books Category:Pablo Picasso ",
