The astronauts of Apollo 16 used the term to refer to the feature during the mission.Apollo 16 Preliminary Science Report (NASA SP-315), 1972.

The feature is topographically higher and of a higher albedo than the surrounding mare lava plain. Two mountains within The Helmet are informally named Herigonius Eta (\u03b7) and Herigonius Pi (\u03c0). Eta is the larger mountain on the northern edge of the Helmet, and Pi is along the southwest edge.
