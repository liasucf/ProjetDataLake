    "text": "Palmeiras-Barra Funda, also known only as Barra Funda, is a train station on CPTM Lines 7-Ruby and 8-Diamond, in the district of Barra Funda in S\u00e3o Paulo. ==History== The first railway to open a station in Barra Funda was Sorocaba Railway, on 10 July 1875. On 19 May 1892, S\u00e3o Paulo Railway opened their station, a few meter ahead, after Viaduto Pacaembu. The stations were isolated fromm each other. The idea of integration between the suburban trains and Metro began in the 1980s. The current station was built by the S\u00e3o Paulo Metro with resources from the State and Federal Governments, in the location of the old Sorocaba Railway station, to attend the East-West Line (current Line 3-Red) and unify in only one station the FEPASA and CBTU commuter trains. During the construction, on May 1986, a favela was displaced, which was located onder the adjacent Viaduto Ant\u00e1rtica, paying Cz$ 6,000 for each family. Despite the amount paid, the families chose to invade a land in Alto da Lapa, which was considered the first municipal land invasion during J\u00e2nio Quadros administration. The station was opened on 17 December 1988, only with Metro and FEPASA lines. CBTY line was transferred only on 5 January 1989. After the unification of the FEPASA and CBTU commuter train line as CPTM, a free interchange between the old companies' lines began. On 27 April 2006, the Metro station was renamed to Palmeiras-Barra Funda, a tribute to Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, a S\u00e3o Paulo soccer club headquartered away from the terminal. The same happened to the CPTM station in 2007. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1988 ",
