It found that IRC support was \"excellent\" due to support for multiple servers and channels and the ease of switching between them in the \u201cwindowed\u201d interface. In September 2002, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols found it \"the greatest of all console IM clients\" due to its \"excellent interface and a huge number of features and configuration options\" in a category review on Freshmeat.Steven J. Vaughan- Nichols (21 September 2002) Instant Messaging Clients, Freshmeat Category Reviews In 2005 it was reviewed in The Unofficial Apple Weblog; despite support for .mac accounts, the reviewer noted \"annoying key combos\" required to access the menus, because on Mac OS X the usual function key assignments of CenterICQ could not be used. Though he could not access the MSN network, he concluded: \"All things considered, I've decided that Centericq is the most stable and intuitive terminal based chat client.\" Fabienne Serriere (22 Oct 2005) \"Terminal Tips: Centericq open source chat aggregator on OS X\", The Unofficial Apple Weblog In August 2007, the project's (then) website stated that CenterICQ development was \"dead\", and that the website would be shut down in November 2007. The site referred users to the CenterIM fork of the project. The developers of the CenterIM fork applied several security patches and updates. , CenterIM was still in development, with version 4.22.9 released on December 14. Neither CenterICQ nor CenterIM 4 support Unicode, but support for UTF-8 is planned for CenterIM 5.\"FAQ\" . CenterIM.org.
