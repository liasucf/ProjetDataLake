    "text": "Dubul' ibhunu, translated as shoot the Boer or kill the Boer, is a controversial South African song. The intended meaning of the song as well as who it is supposed to refer to is disputed. Critics of the song state that is calls for and celebrates violence against the minority white population (Afrikaners) in South Africa, whilst supporters of the song state that it is a liberation song that articulates legitimate and non-violent expression of protest that constitutes an important part of South Africa's history. Depending on the interpretation the song might refer to institutional structures such as the National Party dominated apartheid era government of South Africa or any system of white supremacy and racial oppression; or to specific groups of people such as members of the South African Police Force and Army during apartheid, Boer people, Afrikaners, white farmers, or white South Africans generally. It is similar to, although not to be confused with, the controversial slogan \"One Settler, One Bullet\". == History == The song originates in the struggle against apartheid when it was first sung to protest the Afrikaner dominated apartheid government of South Africa. In post- apartheid South Africa the song has been most notably sung by then African National Congress Youth League leader Julius Malema and then South African President Jacob Zuma. Critics of the song such as AfriForum and TAU-SA state the song encourages and can be partly blamed for the problem of violent attacks on South African farms. In 2011 the South Gauteng High Court ruled that the song was discriminatory, harmful, undermined dignity of Afrikaners and thereby constituted hate speech. The court ruled that Julius Malema, who was brought before the court for previously singing the song at a rally, was not allowed to sing it in the future. Following the ruling Malema changed the wording of the song to \"Kiss the Boer\" and sang that instead. The following year the African National Congress stated that they would not sing the song any more. == Lyrics == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Dubul' ibhunu !Original !English |- |Ayasab' amagwala dubula dubula ayeah dubula dubula ayasab 'a magwala dubula dubula awu yoh dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula awe mama ndiyekele awe mama iyeah awe mama ndiyekele awe mama iyo aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula Ayasab' amagwala dubula dubula ayeah dubula dubula ayasab 'a magwala dubula dubula iii yoh dubula dubala aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula awe mama ndiyekele awe mama iyo awe mama ndiyekele awe mama iyo aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula Ziyarapa lezinja dubula dubula ay iyeah dubula dubula Ziyarapa lezinja dubula dubula ay iiiyo dubula dubula Aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula Aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula Aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula Aw dubul'ibhunu dubula dubula Ayasab' amagwala Dubula dubula Ay iyeah Dubula dubula Ayasab' amagwala Dubula dubula Ay iyeah |The cowards are scared shoot shoot ayeah shoot shoot the cowards are scared shoot shoot awu yoh shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot mother leave me be oh mother mother leave me be oh mother shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot the cowards are scared shoot shoot ayeah shoot shoot the cowards are scared shoot shoot iii yoh shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot mother leave me be oh mother mother leave me be oh mother shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot these dogs are raping shoot shoot ay iyeah shoot shoot these dogs are raping shoot shoot ay iiiyo shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot shoot the Boer shoot shoot the cowards are scared shoot shoot Ay iyeah shoot shoot the cowards are scared shoot shoot Ay iyeah |} == References == Category:Music in the movement against apartheid Category:Protest songs Category:Political songs Category:South African political slogans Category:Anti-white racism in Africa ",
