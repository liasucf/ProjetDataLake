The peak of La Cadena has an elevation of . To reach the peak a climber must walk along a very narrow ridge with sections no more than wide and sections that are very broken. The rocks are firm, but may be slippery and dangerous if they are wet or icy. At the summit there is a hunting reserve sign and a small iron cross, both well-embedded in the rock. ==Geology== The Sierra de Almijara is a rough mass of marble mountains with sharp ridges that stretches east from the Puerto de C\u00f3mpeta. The mountains contain narrow ridges separated by deep valleys cut by the streams and rivers, resulting in many small sub-basins. All of the park has the calcareous formations of the Subb\u00e9tica region, with marbles, shales, phyllites, etc. The area is rich in quartzite and gneiss over 300 million years old. The Sierra de Almijara holds one of the Spain's main sources of dolomitic marble. The marble gives white and gray tones to the ridges and ravines. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * * * Category:Mountains of Andalusia ",
