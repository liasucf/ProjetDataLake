    "text": "Renato da Silva Rocha (May 27, 1961 \u2013 February 22, 2015), affectionately known as Billy or Negrete by his close friends, was a Brazilian musician and songwriter famous for being the bassist of influential rock band Legi\u00e3o Urbana from 1984 until 1989. He helped to compose some of the band's most memorable songs, such as \"Angra dos Reis\", \"Acrilic on Canvas\", \"Quase sem Querer\" and \"Daniel na Cova dos Le\u00f5es\". ==Biography== ===Early life=== Renato da Silva Rocha was born in Rio de Janeiro, in the bairro of S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o, on May 27, 1961, but his family had to move to Bras\u00edlia in 1970, when he was nine years old, after his father, a military, was transferred there. Rocha initially lived at the W3, from 1970 to 1974. Afterwards he moved to 306 Court, where he got acquainted with band Tela, one of the many bands from Bras\u00edlia formed during the 1970s. Despite their friendship, Rocha was never an official member of Tela. Known for his athletic physique, Rocha got his famous nickname \"Negrete\" after joining the AABB volleyball team; it was initially written as \"Negrelle\", referencing the famous volleyball player Jos\u00e9 Osvaldo da Fonseca Marcelino (a.k.a. Negrelli), who began his career playing for the club and partook of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.Negrelli sempre sonhou com os Jogos Ol\u00edmpicos It later became \"Negrete\" as an inside joke of his friends, saying it was too \"French-sounding\". Rocha later moved to 16 Court, where he befriended Geruza, a former member of punk bands Escola de Esc\u00e2ndalos and Blitz 64. Through Geruza he would get acquainted with Andr\u00e9 Pretorius, F\u00ea Lemos and Renato Russo, of Aborto El\u00e9trico, and Marcelo Bonf\u00e1. ===Career=== Rocha's first band was Gestapo, which alongside him was also composed of Lulu Gouveia, Jo\u00e3ozinho Viradinha (who later became a gospel singer) and Judas. Concomitantly he was also a member of Smegma and Hosbond Kama. In 1981 he formed Dents Kents, alongside Fred (vocals), future Plebe Rude member Jander Bilaphra (drums) and Feij\u00e3o (electric guitar). The band broke up the following year. In late 1984 he was invited to join Legi\u00e3o Urbana as bassist, after Renato Russo was unable to record his bass parts for their then-upcoming self- titled debut album after a suicide attempt in which he tried to slash his wrists. Rocha then became a full member of the band, and was also featured on the band's two subsequent albums, Dois and Que Pa\u00eds \u00c9 Este. Rocha left Legi\u00e3o Urbana in 1989, prior to the recording sessions of As Quatro Esta\u00e7\u00f5es. In an interview given years later, he claimed that he was abruptly fired by Renato Russo, who told him, after leaving an elevator: \"You're out of my band\". Dado Villa-Lobos would later elaborate that the real reason of Rocha's ousting was his alcoholism, and other behavioral problems. He temporarily returned to Legi\u00e3o in 1997, to help finish work on the album Uma Outra Esta\u00e7\u00e3o, which was suddenly left unfinished due to Renato Russo's death the year before; he was credited as a guest musician on the album's opening track, \"Riding Song\". After his tenure with Legi\u00e3o Urbana Rocha briefly played for bands Cartilage and Solana Star. Cartilage reportedly managed to release two extended plays prior to their demise. By the late 1990s/early to mid-2000s Rocha had disappeared from the public eye. ===Financial problems and death=== On March 25, 2012, RecordTV's electronic journal Domingo Espetacular reported that Rocha was living in squalor in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. He claimed to have had troubles with alcoholism and drug abuse, and that his royalties from Legi\u00e3o Urbana were not enough for him to make a living. During his final years of life he was interned at a rehabilitation clinic in Cotia, S\u00e3o Paulo, thanks to the efforts of Renato Russo's son Giuliano Manfredini. On February 22, 2015, Rocha died following a sudden cardiac arrest at the age of 53. He was staying with a female friend at an hotel room in Guaruj\u00e1 since February 19. He was buried two days later at the Cemit\u00e9rio Memorial Parque Paulista in Embu das Artes. ==Discography== ===With Legi\u00e3o Urbana=== * 1985: Legi\u00e3o Urbana * 1986: Dois * 1987: Que Pa\u00eds \u00c9 Este * 1997: Uma Outra Esta\u00e7\u00e3o ==References== Category:1961 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Brazilian rock musicians Category:Brazilian songwriters Category:Brazilian bass guitarists Category:Punk rock bass guitarists Category:Alternative rock bass guitarists Category:Post-punk musicians Category:Musicians from Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Musicians from Bras\u00edlia Category:African-Brazilian musicians ",
