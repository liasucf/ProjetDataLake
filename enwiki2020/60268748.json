    "text": "In audio engineering, a bus (alternate spelling buss, plural busses) is a signal path which can be used to combine (sum) individual audio signal paths together. It is used typically to group several individual audio tracks which can be then manipulated, as a group, like another track. This can be achieved by routing the signal physically by ways of switches and cable patches on a mixing console, or by manipulating software features on a digital audio workstation (DAW). Using busses allow the engineer to work in a more efficient way and with better consistency, for instance to apply sound processing effects and adjust levels for several tracks at a time. ==See also== * Live sound mixing * Sound recording and reproduction * Bus (computing) * Software bus * Stem mixing ==References== Category:Audio engineering ",
