She was appointed in 2005, having begun her career as a psychiatric nurse. == Career == Stevenson trained as a psychiatric nurse before completing a BA (Hons) in psychology and sociology at Sunderland Polytechnic. She then returned to nursing as a community psychiatric nurse, specialising in working with families. Whilst working as a nurse, she studied for an MSc in health and social research at the University of Northumbria, and for seven years she held a clinical lectureship at Newcastle University. She then became a reader in nursing at the University of Teesside, and deputy director of the Teesside Centre for Rehabilitation Sciences. On her appointment to Dublin City University, she established a qualitative study into attempted suicide by young men in Ireland, noting that suicide is the most common cause of death in 15 to 24-year-old males in Ireland and that mental health nurses are currently not properly trained to deal with people with severe mental health issues, describing the problem as \"professional avoidance in engaging meaningfully with the person.\" A further report in 2010 stressed the implications of the study for suicide prevention strategies.\"2% of deaths are suicide; REPORT.(News).\" The Mirror (London, England).
