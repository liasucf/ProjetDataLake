    "text": "Weinland Park is a neighborhood north of downtown Columbus, Ohio and encompassed by the boundaries of the University District. A development boom in the 1930s and 1940s resulting from new streetcar lines and the blossoming of factories brought working and middle-class families to the neighborhood. Current housing stock consists primarily of single family residential buildings that have been converted to rentals or multifamily housing. Row- homes and apartment buildings are also ubiquitous in the neighborhood. Renters currently outnumber owners.Solove, Rachel. The Use of Oral and Written History to Build Community Identity and Pride in the Weinland Park Neighborhood. The Ohio State University, 2002, p.11. Commercial and entertainment facilities are concentrated on the North High Street corridor, but also pocket the inner part of the neighborhood as well. Weinland Park saw the sapping of its population and wealth with the rise of newer suburbs ringing the outer reaches of the city and the collapse of local industry and streetcar lines. The neighborhood has been plagued with crime and drug problems for decades but has recently seen a flood of new investment that has brought growth and revitalization to this long struggling neighborhood. Investment into the community includes the South Campus Gateway providing retail and residential finished in 2005, and a new food district and employment center.\"CEDCO.\" CEDCO. Web. 20 November 2015. == History == Weinland Park bears the name of Edgar L. Weinland, member of the first law class of The Ohio State University. Weinland was born in Middletown, Ohio, Ohio but was raised in Westerville, Ohio. He started his career as assistant city solicitor before moving on to become the city solicitor of George Marshall. Acting under the Columbus Housing Authority as city councilman, Weinland was crucial in the annexation of a parcel of land for park space which in turn was called Weinland Park. The current geographical boundary of the neighborhood was given the name of this park as well, though it is unknown when the name became generally used.Solove 2002, p. 14-15 In the late 1800s, the City of Columbus annexed the area along North High Street, including what would later become Weinland Park.Webb, Michael. \"From Society Hill to Weinland Park: Assessing the Changing City Role in Gentrification.\" 1 June 2007. Web. 20 November 2015. From 1900 to 1920, the area developed into a streetcar suburb centered around industry; several factories, such as Columbus Coated Fabrics and the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company, were located in the vicinity which provided work for the residents. At around the same time, the Great Migration brought many African Americans from the rural South to Midwestern cities like Columbus and increased the diversity of the neighborhood. Post World War II, Weinland Park experienced the effects of suburbanization, white flight, and disinvestment which occurred across the nation at the time. Cocaine was introduced to the neighborhood in the 1980s, only exacerbating those issues. Gangs were formed within the community, the most notorious of them being the Short North Posse.Sullivan, Michelle. \"Weinland Park Rebuilds After Decades of Gang Violence.\" Columbus Monthly. 1 October 2014. Web. 20 November 2015. The location of the gang's headquarters, North Fourth Street and East Eight Avenue, was once the most dangerous street corner in the entirety of Columbus. Joblessness, crime, disinvestment, and further flight of residents continued to wear down the community. Public housing projects implemented in Weinland Park during the 1980s and 1990s such as Windsor Terrace and HOPE VI housing failed in many aspects and only further contributed to the downturn of the neighborhood. Recently, the community has moved forward from these historical events. Many different organizations and community members have been implementing revitalization efforts since as early as 1986.Edwards, Randall. \"TEN' AREA FIGHTS FOR ATTENTION.\" Log in to NewsBank. 20 August 1986. Web. 20 November 2015. However, the most ambitious and comprehensive effort has only started within the last few years. The Weinland Park Collaborative brings together The Ohio State University, the City of Columbus, Habitat for Humanity, the Weinland Park Community Civic Association, and many other stakeholders to pool funding and resources with which to improve the neighborhood.\"Weinland Park Collaborative.\" Columbus Foundation. 1 September 2013. Web. 20 November 2015. The collaboration has seven main focuses: education, employment, health, housing, public safety, resident engagement, and youth development. == Geography == Weinland Park is located North of Downtown Columbus and East of The Ohio State University. It is bounded on the north by Chittenden Avenue, the south by Fifth Avenue, the east by the existing railroad tracks, and the west by North High Street and it covers approximately 217 acres of land.Solove 2002, p. 11 It is one of thirteen neighborhoods within the University District.\"Discover.\" RSS.

Areas around Weinland Park include Indianola Terrace to the north, Italian Village to the south, Milo-Grogan to the east, The Ohio State University campus to the northwest, and Peach District, Dennison Place, and The Circles to the west. Perceptions of Weinland Park's geography align fairly closely with its official geography. The eastern and western borders of the neighborhood are clearly delineated by High Street and the railroad tracks, however the neighborhood's northern and southern boundaries are more fluid. As a result, perceptions of the Weinland Park geography may overlap with the Indianola Terrace and Italian Village. == Transportation == Weinland Park is a gridded, transit-oriented neighborhood with easily accessible one way roads, and COTA bus stops at several locations. The number 4 bus line goes down the length of Summit Street and North 4th Street located within the Weinland Park neighborhood.
