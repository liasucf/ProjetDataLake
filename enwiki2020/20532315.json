The term local means that the prison holds people on remand to the local courts, as well as sentenced prisoners. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== Lewes is a Victorian prison, built in 1853. An early prisoner at Lewes was George Witton, a Lieutenant in the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Boer War in South Africa. He was imprisoned after being implicated in the shooting murder of Boer prisoners. While imprisoned in the UK from 1902, George Ramsdale Witton wrote the book \"Scapegoats of the Empire\". After some time Winston Churchill, himself a former prisoner of the Boers during the war, put a number of parliamentary questions to the Colonial Secretary about Witton's ongoing incarceration. The campaign for Witton's release was successful and Witton was pardoned by King Edward VII and was freed on 10 August 1904. Witton then returns to Australia where he was welcomed as a hero by the then Prime Minister of Australia, Alfred Deakin. The 1980 film \"Breaker Morant\" depicts the story of the court-martial and conviction of Morant, Hancock, and Witton. During the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland, several prominent figures involved in it were held at Lewes Prison, including \u00c9amon de Valera (1882-1975); Thomas Ashe (1885-1917); Frank Lawless (1871-1922); and Harry Boland (1887-1922). A \u00a31 million healthcare suite opened in the prison in June 2004, with facilities to treat physically ill prisoners and a 19-bed unit for assessing mental health. In February 2008, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that one wing in Lewes Prison needed to be refurbished urgently after inspectors found that inmates had to eat their meals on toilets. The report also stated that anti-bullying and suicide prevention procedures at the prison were weak. However, inspectors found that vulnerable prisoners felt safe and that the prison was decent overall. Two months later a new accommodation block for 174 inmates was opened at the prison, with a commitment from prison management to refurbish older wings at Lewes within the following 12 months. On 10 April 1852, Sarah Ann French was the last female to be hanged at the prison for her crime of murdering her husband William French. The murder is known in East Sussex as the Onion Pie Murder. ===Riots=== In October 2003, after 25 to 30 prisoners were involved in a riot just before nightly lock-up that led to property damage and the injury of an officer, officials launched an inquiry. In 2016 there was a riot lasting 6 hours when cells and offices were damaged, prison officers forced to retreat to safety. Mike Rolfe of the Prison Officers Association blamed severe staff shortage and bad management. Rolfee said, \"There were only four staff on that wing and all four retreated to safety after threats of violence and the prisoners went on the rampage.\" Two years previously a serving officer said Lewes Prison, \"resembled a warzone\" due to severe staff shortage and drug smuggling.Specialist officers called to Lewes prison to control six-hour riot at notorious jail once described as \u2018worse than Syria\u2019 The IndependentLewes Prison 'rampage' forces staff 'retreat' BBC This is one of four serious incident within under two months, Riots also happened at Birmingham Prison, Bedford Prison.HMP Birmingham prison rioters will face 'full force of law', says Truss The Guardian and Swaleside Prison. ==The prison today== HMP Lewes is a category B local prison in the town of Lewes, East Sussex.
