    "text": "Lempo is a sort of fiend from Finnish folklore and mythology. Lempo is the god of love and fertility in Finnish mythology. After Christianity came to Finland, the reputation of Lempo worsened: they are portrayed in the folklore usually as erratic spirit, as love can be capricious, even dangerous, and it could even take control of a being and turn them to destruction. Lempo brought down the hero V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen with the help of his two demon cohorts, Hiisi and Paha. The words \"lempo\" and \"hiisi\" are also used as very mild swear words in the Finnish language. \"Piru\" is a slightly stronger swear word. This is also work of Christians, they weren't originally bad words. == See also == * 47171 Lempo, minor planet == References == ==External links and references== * The Kalevala Glossary * Taivaannaula: Lempo (fi) Category:Finnish gods Category:Finnish legendary creatures Category:Love and lust gods ",
