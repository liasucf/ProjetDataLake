As most of her career coincided with military regimes, her poetry carries a clandestine dimension. ==Early life== Alejandra Pizarnik was born on April 29, 1936, in Avellaneda, a city within the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area, Argentina, to Jewish immigrant parents from Rovno (now Ukraine).Biograf\u00eda literaria She had a difficult childhood, struggling with acne and self-esteem issues, as well as having a stutter. She also had a marked habit of gaining weight. These contingencies seriously undermined her self-esteem. Because of her negative body image and her continual comparisons to her sister, Alejandra's life became even more complicated. This may have been why she began to take amphetamines, to which she became strongly addicted, causing long periods of sleeping disorders such as euphoria and insomnia. ==Career== A year after entering the department of Philosophy and Letters at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Pizarnik published her first book of poetry, La tierra m\u00e1s ajena (1955). She took courses in literature, journalism, and philosophy at the university of Buenos Aires, but dropped out in order to pursue painting[2] with Juan Batlle Planas. Pizarnik followed her debut work with two more volumes of poems, La \u00faltima inocencia (1956) and Las aventuras perdidas (1958). She was an avid reader of fiction and poetry. Beginning with novels, she delved into more literature with similar topics to learn from different points of view. This sparked an interest early on for literature and also for the unconscious, which in turn gave rise to her interest in psychoanalysis. Her lyricism was influenced by Antonio Porchia, French symbolists\u2014especially Arthur Rimbaud and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\u2014, the spirit of romanticism and by the surrealists. She wrote prose poems, in the spirit of Octavio Paz, but from a woman's perspective on issues ranging from loneliness, childhood, and death. Between 1960 and 1964 Pizarnik lived in Paris, where she worked for the magazine Cuadernos and other French editorials. She published poems and criticism in many newspapers, translated for Antonin Artaud, Henri Michaux, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Yves Bonnefoy and Marguerite Duras. She also studied French religious history and literature at the Sorbonne. There she became friends with Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Rosa Chacel, Silvina Ocampo and Octavio Paz. Paz even wrote the prologue for her fourth poetry book, The Tree of Diana (1962). A famous sequence on Diana reads: \"I jumped from myself to dawn/I left my body next to the light/and sang the sadness of being born.\" She returned to Buenos Aires in 1964, and published her best-known books of poetry: Los trabajos y las noches (1965), Extracci\u00f3n de la piedra de la locura (1968) and El infierno musical (1971). She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1968, and in 1971 a Fulbright Scholarship. Pizarnik's poetry claims a clandestine and iconic dimension because the majority of her mature output coincides with the military regimes in Argentine.[2] == Death == Pizarnik ended her life on September 25, 1972, by taking an overdose of Secobarbital sodium at the age of 36 one weekend she was on leave from the psychiatric hospital where she was institutionalized. She is buried in the Cementerio Israelita de La Tablada, La Tablada, Argentina. ==Books== *The Most Foreign Country (La tierra m\u00e1s ajena) (1955) **translated by Yvette Siegert (Ugly Duckling Presse, October 2015) *The Final Innocence (La \u00faltima inocencia) (1956) **translated by Yvette Siegert (Ugly Duckling Presse, October 2016) *The Lost Adventures (Las aventuras perdidas) (1958) *Diana's Tree (\u00c1rbol de Diana) (1962) **translated by Yvette Siegert (Ugly Duckling Presse, October 2014) *Works and Nights (Los trabajos y las noches) (1965) **translated by Yvette Siegert (in Extracting the Stone of Madness: Poems 1962-1972, New Directions, September 2015) *Extracting the Stone of Madness (Extracci\u00f3n de la piedra de locura) (1968) **translated by Yvette Siegert (in Extracting the Stone of Madness: Poems 1962-1972, New Directions, September 2015) *A Musical Hell (El infierno musical) (1971) **translated by Yvette Siegert (New Directions, July 2013; reprinted in Extracting the Stone of Madness: Poems 1962-1972 by New Directions, September 2015) *The Bloody Countess (La condesa sangrienta) (1971) *Exchanging Lives: Poems and Translations, Translator Susan Bassnett, Peepal Tree, 2002. ==Further reading== *\"Unmothered Americas: Poetry and universality, Charles Simic, Alejandra Pizarnik, Giannina Braschi\", Jaime Rodriguez Matos, dissertation, Columbia University; Faculty Advisor: Gustavo Perez-Firmat, 2005. *\u201cThe Sadean Poetics of Solitude in Paz and Pizarnik.\u201d Latin American Literary Review / Rolando P\u00e9rez, 2005 *Review: Art & Literature of the Americas: The 40th anniversary Edition\", featuring Alejandra Pizarnik, Christina Peri Rossi, Octavio Paz, Giannina Braschi,\" edited by Doris Sommer and Tess O'Dwyer, 2006. *\"Arbol de Alejandra: Pizarnik Reassessed,\" (monograph) by Karl Posso and Fiona J.
