    "text": "\"Shoplifters of the World Unite\" is a song by the English rock band the Smiths. Released in January 1987, it reached No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart. As with most of the Smiths' singles, it was not included on a studio album. It is featured on the compilation albums The World Won't Listen, Louder Than Bombs, Singles and The Sound of The Smiths. Another newly completed song, \"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\", was originally intended to be the A-side of this single. It made it to the white label test pressing stage and approximately 900 stock copies of the single were manufactured. This aborted single mix can be heard on The World Won't Listen, while a remixed version is included in Louder Than Bombs. ==Background== The title alludes to the slogan \"Workers of the world, unite!\", and the 1966 David and Jonathan hit \"Lovers of the World Unite\". ==Music and lyrics== During a 1987 interview with Shaun Duggan, Morrissey said of the song: \"[It does] not literally mean picking up a loaf of bread or a watch and sticking it in your coat pocket. It's more or less spiritual shoplifting, cultural shoplifting, taking things and using them to your own advantage.\" Musically the song has a resemblance to the T. Rex song \"Children of the Revolution\".Walk right through the door: 12 songs about shoplifting ==Music video== A music video based partly on the band's performance of the song on The Tube was directed by Tamra Davis. ==Live performances== The Smiths performed this song in concert only once, during their last gig in December 1986 at Brixton Academy, London. Additionally they performed it live on the TV music show The Tube in April 1987, and Morrissey has sung it in concert frequently during his solo career. ==Track listing== ==Artwork and matrix message== The single's sleeve features a photograph of a young Elvis Presley that was taken by James R. Reid. The British 7\" and 12\" vinyls contained the matrix messages: ALF RAMSEY'S REVENGE/none == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart !Peak position |- |Ireland (IRMA) |align=\"center\"|7 |- |UK Singles (The Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|12 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:The Smiths songs Category:1987 singles Category:Songs written by Morrissey Category:Songs written by Johnny Marr Category:Music videos directed by Tamra Davis Category:Songs against capitalism Category:UK Independent Singles Chart number-one singles ",
