    "text": "Joe Peter Buhler (born 1950 in Vancouver, Washington) is an American mathematician. Buhler received his undergraduate degree from Reed College in 1972, and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1977 with thesis Icosahedral Galois Representations and thesis advisor John Tate. Buhler was a professor at Reed College in Portland, Oregon from 1980 until his retirement in 2005.Reed College, Emeriti In 1997, he introduced, with Zinovy Reichstein, the concept of essential dimension. Buhler is involved in a project to numerically verify the Kummer\u2013Vandiver conjecture of Harry Vandiver and Ernst Eduard Kummer concerning the class number of cyclotomic fields. Vandiver proved it with a desk calculator up to class number 600, Derrick Lehmer (in the late 1940s) to about 5000, and Buhler with colleagues (in 2001) to 12 million.J. P.

Buhler's research deals with algorithmic algebraic number theory, algebra, and cryptography. He was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012. ==References== ==External links== * Homepage * photo and biography on the occasion of a lecture * author's profile in the database zbMATH Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st- century American mathematicians Category:Reed College alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Reed College faculty Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Vancouver, Washington ",
