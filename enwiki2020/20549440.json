The union published a weekly newspaper, Na Zdar.McDermott, Kevin. The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929: A Study of Their Relations with the Communist Party and the Moscow Internationals. East European monographs, no. 239. Boulder: East European Monographs, 1988. pp. 125-127 ==History== Svaz \u010desk\u00fdch horn\u00edk\u016f ('Union of Czech Miners') was founded in October 1910, through a split from the Austrian Miners' Union (affiliated to the Imperial Trade Union Commission).McDermott, Kevin. The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929: A Study of Their Relations with the Communist Party and the Moscow Internationals. East European monographs, no. 239. Boulder: East European Monographs, 1988. p. 11http://osphgn.cmkos.cz/?id=historie The union was drastically affected during the First World War. Since the mining industry was crucial for the war effort, strikes were banned. Striking or protesting workers could be sent either to the battle-front or to jail. But the Union of Czech Miners was one of the OS\u010c unions that expanded rapidly in the period 1917-1918\\. Membership in the union rose from 1,189 in 1917 to 7,875 one year later.McDermott, Kevin. The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929: A Study of Their Relations with the Communist Party and the Moscow Internationals. East European monographs, no. 239. Boulder: East European Monographs, 1988. pp. 19-20 In 1918, the name was changed to Svaz horn\u00edk\u016f v \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e9 republice ('Miners' Union in the Czechoslovak Republic'). In 1920, the Miners' Union was the second largest affiliate of OS\u010c, with 84,895 members.McDermott, Kevin.

Boulder: East European Monographs, 1988. p. 37 ===Split=== The 1921-1922 split in the OS\u010c, when many communist trade unionists either were expelled or withdrew from the centre to form the parallel Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u0161eodborov\u00fd svaz (MVS), affected the Miners' Union somewhat differently from other unions. The Miners' Union did not see any immediate split, but much tension between communists and Social Democrats. All sides did however, at an initial stage, value the unity of union. Whilst there had been calls from MVS for miners to join the new centre, such appeals did not have the support of the Communist Party (who instead sought to consolidate their strength inside the Miners' Union). A smaller group of coalminers from Northern Bohemia joined the MVS-affiliated Chemical Workers' Union. The mining areas of Kladno was a communist stronghold. In the Ostrava- Karvin\u00e1 coalfields, three separate branches had been formed, one at Moravska Ostrava, one Polish branch at Karvin\u00e1 and one communist-dominated branch at Orlov. At the time, the general secretary of the Miners' Union was the Social Democratic MP Karel Bro\u017e\u00edk. Between August 20, 1923 and October 6, 1923, a miners strike was launched. The strike ended unsuccessfully, as the Miners' Union in the end accepted cuts in salaries between 9 and 13%. The communists opposed the deal, and the division inside the union became fierce. The communists broke away, and took approximately 10,000 miners with them into the MVS.McDermott, Kevin.
