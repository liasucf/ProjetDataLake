    "text": ", a ghost station in the A ghost station is a disused train station through which revenue-service passenger trains (especially rapid transit trains) pass but at which they do not stop. The term is also sometimes used for any unused underground station or any unused station at all, whether or not revenue- service trains pass by them at all. ==Etymology== The term \"ghost station\" is a calque of the German word (plural ). The German term was coined to describe certain stations on Berlin's and metro networks that were closed during the period of Berlin's division during the Cold War because they were an integral part of a transit line mostly located on the other side of the Berlin Wall. ==Ghost stations in Berlin== ===Background=== Sign at in 2007, unchanged since the 1930s. It has since been covered by a modern sign showing the station's new name, \"\". Map of ghost stations in Berlin In August 1961 the East German government built the Berlin Wall, ending freedom of movement between East and West Berlin. As a result, the Berlin public transit network, which had formerly spanned both halves of the city, was also divided into two. Some and lines fell entirely into one half of the city or the other; other lines were divided between the two jurisdictions, with trains running only to the border and then turning back. However, there were three lines\u2014the lines now designated U6 and U8, and the Tunnel on the \u2014that ran for the most part through West Berlin but passed for a short distance through the borough of Mitte (the historic city centre), which was East Berlin territory. These lines continued to be open to West Berliners; however, trains did not stop at most of the stations located within East Berlin, though for technical reasons they did have to slow down significantly while passing through.Originally , after an East German policeman tried to jump on a moving train the mandatory speed was later increased to . 2009 p. 119 (Trains did stop at , on which more below.) The name was soon aptly applied to these dimly lit, heavily guarded stations by travellers from West Berlin, who watched them pass by through the carriage windows. However, the term was never official; West Berlin maps of the period simply labelled these stations \"\" (\"stations at which the trains do not stop\"). East Berlin maps neither depicted the West Berlin lines nor the ghost stations. maps in the transfer station were unique: They depicted all the Western lines, but not the , and showed the city divided into \"\" (\"Berlin, capital of the German Democratic Republic\") and \"\", the official terminology used by East Germany. The situation was obviously less than ideal. The lines were a vital part of the West Berlin transit network, but because part of the route of some of the lines lay in East Berlin territory, it was difficult for Western support staff to perform maintenance work on the tracks and tunnels. If a train on a West Berlin line broke down in East Berlin territory, then passengers had to wait for Eastern border police to appear and escort them out. The East German government occasionally hinted that it might someday block access to the tunnels at the border and run its own service on the East Berlin sections of these lines. However, this awkward status quo persisted for the entire 28-year period of the division of Berlin. At the closed stations, barbed wire fences were installed to prevent any would-be escapees from East Berlin from accessing the track bed, and the electrically live third rail served as an additional and potentially lethal deterrent. An alarm was triggered if anyone breached one of the barriers. As for the entrances, the signage was removed, walkways were walled up and stairways were sealed with concrete slabs. Police stations were built into the windowed platform service booths, from which the whole platform area could be monitored. A wide white line on the wall marked the exact location of the border. Later, gates were installed at some stations that could be rolled into place at night while the guards were off-duty. Guard posts at other stations were staffed continuously, creating additional employment positions with the transport police. In the platform area, the guards always worked in pairs, and care was taken in their assignment to assure that there would be no personal ties between them. In addition, superior officers could conduct surprise inspections at any time, thus, maintaining maximum security. Other stations were secured by the East German border guards. ===Particular stations=== station, though served by Western lines and located in East Berlin territory, was not a . Instead, it served as a transfer point between U6 and several lines. Western passengers could walk from one platform to another without ever leaving the station or having to show papers, much like air travellers changing planes at an international airport. Westerners with appropriate visas could also enter East Berlin there (they could even get a visa in the station). The station was the only ghost station not located in a tunnel. It was situated close to the wall near the border crossing. West Berlin trains passed through it without stopping. East Berlin trains passed the same station but on different tracks. The tracks used by Western and Eastern trains were sealed off from each other by a tall fence. Another oddity was station. Like , it was an stop served by West Berlin trains, but located on East Berlin territory just behind the border. However, was in use and accessible for West Berliners, as one of its exits opened on a West Berlin street. This exit was exactly on the border line, a warning sign next to it informing passengers about the situation. Its other exits to East Berlin streets were blocked. ===Reopening=== The reopening of station on 11 November 1989, the first of the ghost stations to be reopened after the Fall of the Berlin Wall The first people to enter the ghost stations after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 found that they lived up to their informal name, with ads and signage on the walls unchanged since 1961. None of them have been preserved. The first ghost station to reopen to passenger traffic was (U8) on 11 November 1989, two days after the fall of the Wall. It was equipped with a checkpoint within the station akin to , where East German customs and border control were provisionally installed to facilitate passengers heading to or coming from East Berlin. Hand-drawn destination signs were hung up covering the old ones from pre-1961; these signs were both crumbling from age and obviously missing the termini of post-1961 line extensions. On 22 December 1989, (U8) was reopened with a similar provisional checkpoint. On 12 April 1990, the third station to reopen was (U8). As its northern exit was directly on the border, it could be opened with direct access to West Berlin without the need of a checkpoint. Its southern exit towards East Berlin was not reopened until 1 July 1990. Discussions on reopening all the U6 and U8 stations including the S-Bahn station , and had begun on 13 April 1990 without border controls. These took two months to clean up, removing all the dirt and refurbishing the interiors; all stations had been reopened on 1 July 1990 at 11 a.m., as East Berlin and East Germany had adopted the West German currency (DM), leaving the border checkpoints abandoned. station \u2013 formerly a ghost station and now reopened On 2 July 1990, was the first ghost station on the to reopen. On 1 September 1990, and were opened following reconstruction works. On 12 December 1990, was reopened for West Berlin trains; a second platform for East Berlin trains allowing interchange followed on 5 August 1991. The very last ghost station to reopen was , which opened on 3 March 1992, following an extensive restoration of the entire North\u2013South tunnel. In the following years, the city and German government put a great deal of effort into restoring and reunifying the and networks in Berlin. The U-Bahn system reached its pre-war status in 1995 with the reopening of on U1. The system reached a preliminary completion in 2002 (with the reopening of the ring), even though there are still disused sections of lines closed in the aftermath of the wall. Decisions on reopening of some of these sections are still to be made. ===List of all Berlin ghost stations=== This list only includes those stations in East Berlin territory that western trains passed through without stopping. There were other stations on both sides of the wall that were closed during the division because those sections of track were not in use. Temporary checkpoints were set up for stations with access to East Berlin that were reopened before 1 July 1990. Checkpoints were no longer necessary for those reopened after that date when border checks were eliminated with the currency union between East and West Germany. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" ! colspan=\"5\" | List of Berlin's ghost stations as a result of the Cold War |- ! colspan=\"5\"| (S1, S2 and S25) |- !

The most notable examples are: * : station on the Berlin Outer Ring located due south of Berlin, quite far from any populated place, lost its importance with the resumption of direct routes from the Potsdam area to East Berlin and due to the reduction of the workforce in the factory located nearby. Trains running between Potsdam and the station stopped at the station until December 2012. Since then all passenger trains pass through without stopping and it was officially reclassified to a (service station). A train stop named was built 2 km to the west (closer to populated areas) and brought into service with the closure of the station. * : an interchange station also located on the Berlin Outer Ring on the outskirts of Potsdam, named (Potsdam Main station) between 1961 and 1993, was the most important station of Potsdam when the traffic flow to West Berlin (Berlin\u2013Magdeburg railway) was severely restricted. After resumption of service between Potsdam and station, the station lost its importance, became unstaffed in 1994. Tracks on the upper deck were demolished in 1999 (leaving only a pair of through tracks not adjacent to any platform), and on the lower deck only a single platform was left in service for use by the local trains from Potsdam to . Although its present-day importance is negligible and its decaying appearance is not unlike \"real\" ghost stations from the Cold War era, it still has regular passenger trains stopping at it. ==Ghost stations elsewhere== ===Argentina=== The Underground has four ghost stations. The two stations on Line A were originally two single-platform stations closed in 1953 since their close proximity meant trains had to stop in quick succession and frequencies were reduced. Their opposing platforms, located just metres away from each of the ghost stations, still remain open as and stations. The stations are preserved to maintain their original appearance and can still be seen when travelling on the line, even being used as a display for a time.Las estaciones clausuradas de la l\u00ednea A \u2013 EnElSubte, 24 April 2014. (Spanish) On Line E, the two stations were closed in 1966 when the line was re-routed closer to the centre of in order to improve passenger numbers. They have both been used as maintenance areas for Line E and Line C, while one of the stations served as a set for the 1996 Argentine film . The stations were under consideration to be re-purposed as part of the new Line F, however it was later decided to build new tunnels instead., 1 August 2011. There are also two stations ( and ) on Line E and Line D which were designed to be used as temporary stations while their respective lines were being extended. Though the platforms remain, they cannot be considered true ghost stations since they were never intended to be a permanent part of the network and designed to be re-purposed as electrical substations once the permanent stations were built. * Underground Line A ** ** * Underground Line E ** ** ===Australia=== * General Motors on the Melbourne train network. (Not an underground station, nor part of an underground network). * Nyanda railway station (between Rocklea and Salisbury) on the Gold Coast railway line, Brisbane. (Not an underground station, nor part of an underground network). *Woollahra on the Eastern Suburbs Line. (Not an underground station, partially constructed but never opened). ===Austria=== * Vienna Underground Railway (): Station of line U2 closed in 2013 and the old station. * Vienna Rapid Transit (): several stations have been closed: , , in 1939, the old station, in 2000, in 2004, in 2010 ===Brazil=== * (S\u00e3o Paulo Metro), platforms of the Moema branch, never opened * (S\u00e3o Paulo Metro), underground docks that would serve the Southeast-Southwest line, but which would not have been put into service * Pirelli Station (CPTM S\u00e3o Paulo) in Santo Andr\u00e9 * Paranapiacaba Station (CPTM S\u00e3o Paulo) in Paranapiacaba in Santo Andr\u00e9 * station, in . An old station formerly used in a passenger train line from to , and currently only cargo trains pass through it in service, while metropolitan trains operated by the line only pass there while maneuvering. station of the Trensurb, serving Porto Alegre airport, was built right beside the station. ===Bulgaria=== * St. Naum Station () and NDK Station () of the Sofia Metro. Both stations were built in the 1980s, together with the National Palace of Culture and the redevelopment of the surrounding area. Currently these stations are fully completed and had become operational on 31 August 2012. St. Naum Station is operating under the name of European Union Metro Station. * Station (). ===Canada=== Lower Bay, Toronto, opened during a limited tour * Lower Bay in Toronto. Below the main platform for Bay station is an abandoned level which was used for only six months in 1966 when the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) experimentally interlined portions of both the Yonge\u2013University and Bloor\u2013Danforth lines. This abandoned platform is sometimes referred to as \"Lower Bay\" by the general public or \"Bay Lower\" by the TTC. * Municipal Building in Calgary. A downtown subway was originally planned under 8th Avenue for the Calgary C-Train. In preparation, a short section of tunnel and underground LRT station were built under the Calgary Municipal Building when it was constructed in 1985. Subway plans were halted because the initial surface line on 7th Avenue turned out to have much more passenger capacity than expected. The underground station and downtown subway may be completed in the foreseeable future as future C-Train lines which are under construction and proposed will exceed the capacity of the 7th Avenue surface line. ===Chile=== station, located in between Cumming and in Line 5 of the , is a ghost station that was closed because there wasn't enough passenger demand for the station due to the low density of people traveling around and through it. is a ghost station located in Line 4A, also closed because of the low density of people traveling around and through it. The original project of the line 3 side of Puente Cal y Canto metro station is also a ghost station. The entire line 3 was canceled because of the 1985 Algarrobo earthquake. ===Czech Republic=== * and stations on Line B of Prague Metro were ghost stations from 1998 to 1999 (2001 for ). The stations were in a state of suspended construction as the heavy industry factories they should have served were closed after the Velvet Revolution. Trains slowed down when passing through these dimly lit stations. As the whole industrial area was slowly revitalized the stations were finally completed. * station was closed from July 2012 to June 2014 due to construction of a new shopping and business centre. Trains passed through the station without stopping. ===China=== * in Beijing ==== Hong Kong ==== Remnants of Rumsey Station's platforms, integrated into * Rumsey Station in the MTR. This platform was originally reserved for the East Kowloon Line proposal in the 1970s, in order to minimise the effects on the Island Line. However, these platforms are now abandoned and brick walls have been placed at the two ends of the long platforms to block them off. The station is now called and formerly served as the terminus of the Island Line before the opening of West Island Line. Since the platforms were built as the upper platforms, passengers going to and from exit E must pass through the abandoned platforms. In preparation for the opening of the West Island Line extension the station was renovated, and the track area along the platforms was walled off. ===Denmark=== * station is a former surface station on (line A), which is a part of the network in Copenhagen. The station was closed in 2007 when the station (\"New station\") was built when (line F) was extended, with connections between these two lines. ===Finland=== The Kamppi metro station has an unused north\u2013south station, below and at right angles to the east\u2013west one currently in use. Excavated at the same time as the east\u2013west station, it was never outfitted, because the corresponding north\u2013south metro line was never built. The Hakaniemi metro station has another similar ghost station, built for the U-line which was eventually not constructed, and its excavation remains incomplete. They don't have any trains and are not accessible. The University of Helsinki metro station is a former ghost station, since it was excavated in the late 1970s, but opened to the public in 1995. Under Munkkivuori Shopping Centre in Helsinki is an unfinished space for Helsinki Metro station. Space was reserved during expansion work of shopping centre in early 60s but never used. ===France=== , closed 1939 * * * * * * ===Germany=== Apart from Berlin: * Light Railway (): station , built, but never opened * Rapid Transit (): station closed since 1990 and Station at Airport since 1998 * Underground Railway (): station , built, but never opened; station on line U2 and station * Hanover Light Railway (): part of station , built, but never opened * Cologne Light Railway (): station closed in 2003, , built, but never opened * Tramway: tramway underground stations and (partially) * Munich Rapid Transit (): M\u00fcnchen Olympiastadion station closed in 1988 * Nuremberg Ring Railway: stations and closed in 1992 === Indonesia === Indonesia has some ghost stations like Gunung Putri railway station and Pondok Rajeg railway station. Abandoned Pondok Rajeg station, photo was taken on . Abandoned Gunung Putri station, photo was taken on . ===Ireland=== A \"ghost station\" exists on the Luas tram system in Dublin, on the Green Line between Ballyogan Wood and Carrickmines. It was intended to service new suburbs, but the post-2008 Irish economic downturn meant that the suburbs were never built and the tram passes through empty fields at that point on the line. The station is labelled \"Future Stop\" on the route map; it will be called \"Brennanstown\" if and when it opens. === Italy === Italy does not have a long list of ghost stations. Amongst the few examples is Quintiliani, on Line B of the Rome Metro. It was built in 1990 as part of the extension towards the northeast of Line B, but was kept unused because it was meant to serve a planned business district called Sistema Direzionale Orientale (Eastern Directional District) that was never realized. In the early 2000s the project of the S.D.O. was cancelled and the station, which was in the middle of nowhere, was taken in charge by the Municipality of Rome and renewed to make it compliant with the new security rules issued in the meantime; a new bus line was established to link the station to the nearby Sandro Pertini general hospital. On 23 June 2003 it was officially opened to passenger traffic, ending a 13-year long period of ghost station status. ===Japan=== * station on the Main Line (closed in 2004) * station on the Line (closed in 2004) * station on the Tokyo Metro Line (closed in 1931) ===Malaysia=== in 2007, in an unfinished state since 1999. The station was completed and opened in 2010. * railway station is a partially disused railway station owned by (KTM) which is a part of the extension of KTM Intercity's East Coast Line in , . After DMU drivers from Thailand refused to stop their railcars between and , it is reused by Eastern and Oriental Express trains as a railway station for emergency purposes. * station on the line in . Partially completed during construction between 1994 and 1999 but remaining inactive and mothballed for a decade after the opening of the line, as ridership via the station was initially projected to be too low. Completed and opened in December 2010 following new property developments around the station. ===New Zealand=== * Helensville railway station on Auckland's Northern Line closed in 2009 * railway station on Auckland's Northern Line, a temporary stop in 2008 and 2009 * railway station on Auckland's Northern Line closed in 2009 * railway station with electrification terminating at Swanson, this station has closed (2014) ===North Korea=== * Pyongyang Metro \u2013 station () has been closed since 1995 when the mausoleum of was opened atop that station. ===Norway=== , closed 1985 * on the Oslo Metro * on the Oslo Metro * in the Oslo Tunnel All three are real ghost stations, underground stations with trains passing through. === Portugal === ==== Lisbon Metro ==== * Reboleira: The station started to be constructed, but never ended due to the 2010\u201314 Portuguese financial crisis. In June 2015, the company announced that the construction of the station and of the connecting line would be resumed, and that the station would be operational. This metro station opened in 13 April 2016. *Arroios: This station was closed for renovations in late 2017, and was originally expected to reopen in late 2019; however, the renovations of that station have been delayed. ===Russia=== ====Moscow Metro==== * (opened as \"\"): only one of three stations in the complex is opened, the other two stations are built in as provisions. A part of the platform is a temporary picture gallery. * (depot) and (depot): Temporary stations built in the respective metro depots. After the lines they were serving were extended and proper stations built, these were closed. ====Saint Petersburg Metro==== * , a bay platform opened in 1966, closed in 1977, a part of the platform was rebuilt as a police building. ====Nizhny Novgorod Metro==== * , located between the Moskovskaya and Strelka stations. Its construction was started in 1993, but was discontinued in 1996. At first, in this station there was a headshunt for trains. After the opening of the Strelka station you can see the branch and expansion of the tunnel for the station. Presumably this station will be completed after 2020. ====Novosibirsk Metro==== *, a station of the Metro. === Singapore === View of Woodleigh MRT station in 2006, when the station was still closed * Bukit Brown is an unopened station along the Circle line. It is currently only a shell station with a ventilation shaft. It is located on top of Bukit Brown Chinese Cemetery and Jalan Mashor, an almost totally abandoned road. * * Several stations on the Punggol LRT, including the entire West Loop, did not open with the rest of the line in 2005. Nearly all of these stations have since opened for service alongside developments in their respective areas. As of 2017, only one station, Teck Lee, remains closed, as it is currently surrounded by jungle. * There is a reserved space for a new station on the North East line between HarbourFront and Outram Park but there is no station box there. Two other stations were constructed on the line but did not open with the rest of the line in 2003; these were Buangkok and Woodleigh, which subsequently opened in 2006 and 2011, respectively. * Ten Mile Junction station on the Bukit Panjang LRT opened in November 1999, and was permanently closed on 13 January 2019, to facilitate upgrading works for the line. The station was previously closed from late 2010 to early 2012 for refurbishment works. ===South Korea=== * A second platform for Seoul Subway Line 2 at Sinseol-dong station ===Spain=== on the Barcelona Metro, closed 1972 * Disused Barcelona Metro stations * in Madrid Metro * , and in ===Sweden=== * in Stockholm Metro (trains pass through it) * in Gothenburg (prepared underground station not used by trains) * in Gothenburg (is expected to become a ghost station in 2026 when local trains will use a new tunnel and only long distance trains will pass through Liseberg station) ===Ukraine=== * , and in the Kyiv Metro * in the Kryvyi Rih Metrotram ===United Kingdom=== * List of former and unopened London Underground stations * Merkland Street on the Glasgow Subway. * King's Cross Thameslink ===United States=== 58th Street on the Chicago \"L\" Green Line Government Center Metrorail station, Miami * Euclid\u2013East 120th on the RTA Rapid Transit in Cleveland * Nine stations on the New York City Subway, as well as two stations on the PATH system * Franklin Square on the PATCO Speedline and Spring Garden on the Broad-Ridge Spur in Philadelphia * Six stations on the Chicago \"L\" * Three stations on the VTA light rail system in San Jose, as well as Eureka Valley in San Francisco * The unused east\u2013west platform at Government Center Station on the Metrorail in Miami * Harvard- Holyoke near Boston * The former platforms of the Gateway station in Pittsburgh * 29th & Welton in Denver * Subway Terminal Building in Los Angeles contains an abandoned station in the basement with its terminus at Belmont Tunnel/Toluca Substation and Yard.
