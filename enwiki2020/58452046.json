    "text": "Marc Eugene Schiler is a professor of the USC School of Architecture at the University of Southern California. He is a Fellow of the American Solar Energy Society and a winner of the Passive Solar Pioneer award in 2015. Schiler completed an undergraduate degree in architecture at USC School of Architecture and a Master of Architecture at Cornell University. He was an Assistant Professor of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at Cornell for four years prior to returning to USC in 1982. He was invited for a year to do research at the EMPA (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology). He served as a Fulbright Senior Scholar to the Middle East in 2002-2003 at the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa and the Ben- Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boqer. He has published more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific papers and authored or edited six books on environmental controls. == Noted Pioneer in Reflected Visual Glare and Thermal Glare == Much of Schiler\u2019s recent work deals with reflected visual glare and thermal glare (concentrated radiant heat) from reflective buildings. One of the high profile cases was the Walt Disney Concert Hall, which focused light into traffic intersections and heat onto the sidewalk and into other buildings. Schiler\u2019s analysis and advice allowed architect Frank Gehry and the building owner to resolve the complaints. Schiler has published on that and other similar situations, continuing to consult with Gehry and other prominent architects such as Coop Himmelblau so as to avoid such situations in subsequent projects. His work has pioneered a new field of study on this expanding issue found among state of the art Architectural buildings. == Books by Schiler == * Schiler, Marc and L.
