    "text": "George Washington Bonaparte Towns (May 4, 1801 \u2013 July 15, 1854) was a United States lawyer, legislator, and politician. He served in the United States House of Representatives on three separate occasions and was the 39th Governor of Georgia from 1847 to 1851. ==Early life and education== The George W. Towns House in Talbotton, Georgia was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 7, 1973. Towns was born in Wilkes County, Georgia to Margaret George Hardwick and John Towns in 1801. His parents were Virginians who had moved to Georgia and settled in Wilkes County. Shortly after his birth, the Towns family moved throughout Georgia, where he received a small preparatory education. He then began to study medicine in Eatonton, but after his studies were interrupted by an injury, he moved to Montgomery, Alabama, which had recently joined the Union. There, he studied law and, in 1824 was admitted to the Montgomery bar. ==Early career== As time went by, Towns continued to gain prominence and in 1826 acquired the Alabama Journal newspaper. During that same year he married his first wife, Margaret Jane Campbell, whose poor health led to her death several days after the marriage ceremony. Following the death of his wife, Towns moved back to Georgia and settled in Talbot County. In 1828, Towns became one of the original town commissioners of Talbotton, where he also established a law office. During this period Towns served as colonel in the 65th Regiment of the Georgia Militia. ==Political career== Towns began his 22-year political career in 1829 as a strong Unionist and opponent of nullification in the Georgia House of Representatives and Georgia Senate. He was subsequently elected to the United States House of Representatives on three separate occasions. He served a partial term in the House from 1835 to 1836 and a full term from 1837 to 1839. He later served a third non- consecutive term from 1846 to 1847. He served as the 39th Governor of Georgia from 1847 to 1851. On September 23, 1850, Towns asked the General Assembly to allow a special election to send delegates to a state convention to pass judgment on the Compromise of 1850. Towns\u2019 wife, Mary Winston Jones Towns, was the daughter of John Winston Jones, who served as Speaker of the U.S. House from 1843 to 1845. Towns and Jones served concurrently in the House for a time. By the end of his time in politics, Towns had become a radical secessionist who believed the federal government was controlled by abolitionists bent on repressing the South. ==Death and Legacy== Towns died in Macon, Georgia on July 15, 1854, and is interred at the Rose Hill Cemetery in that town. Towns County, Georgia is named in his honor. ==References== == External links == * Category:Governors of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Members of the Georgia House of Representatives Category:Georgia (U.S. state) state senators Category:Georgia (U.S. state) lawyers Category:Lawyers from Montgomery, Alabama Category:1801 births Category:1854 deaths Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Democrats Category:People from Wilkes County, Georgia Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:People from Talbotton, Georgia Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Jacksonians Category:Jacksonian members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:American slave owners Category:19th-century American politicians ",
