He also criticized the green movement for cutting down on back burning, which in turn contributed to the damaging wild fire, and accused Moore of turning a speech on bush fire into a political statement on global warming.Vikki Campion, \"'Mumbo jumbo' Lord Mayor Clover Moore jumps on the burning bandwagon\", The Daily Telegraph, 22 October 2013.Vikki Campion, \"Clover Moore accused of using bushfire donation speech as political statement on climate change,\" The Daily Telegraph, 21 October 2013.Peter Hackney, \"City lends hand to bushfire victims\", AltMedia, 24 October 2013. ===Business voting rights=== In September 2014 the NSW state Parliament passed a bill granting businesses two votes while also making business voting compulsory.\"The Battle for the City of Sydney,\" Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 5 October 2014. Mandla was instrumental in getting the bill passed. He had been a proponent of business voting rights, arguing that businesses provided the bulk of rate revenues \u2013 about 80 percent \u2013 but were effectively denied a vote. Previously, business voting was voluntary, but turnout was low and discouraged by an unwieldy system of yearly enrolment.[42] Mandla worked with Shooters MP Robert Borsak to help draft the bill, which was passed in September 2014 and was to take effect in the 2016 elections.Nicole Hasham, \"Alan Jones convinced government on voting policy: Shooters MP,\" The Sydney Morning Herald, 14 August 2014. ===Parking Rangers investigation=== Following the death of a whistleblower, Mandla pressured Mayor Moore to release the full details of a secret investigation into allegations of bullying and harassment within Sydney's parking ranger unit. In May 2015 the whistleblower emailed Ms. Moore, City of Sydney CEO Monica Barone, and other officials to highlight plunging morale among colleagues, deteriorating mental health, high sick leave and staff turnover. Four weeks later the whistleblower died of a suspected suicide. The council knew of the misconduct allegations since at least 2012 when City of Sydney ordered an investigation into allegations of \"bullying, harassment, coercion and intimidation\". Councilor Mandla demanded Moore publicly release the results of the 2012 internal report and step aside until a full investigation be completed.\"Sydney City ranger dies after blowing whistle on council\u2019s dysfunctional parking rangers unit,\" The Daily Telegraph, 25 June 2015.\"Leong Lim: Parking officer\u2019s suspected suicide prompts government investigation of the City of Sydney council,\" The Daily Telegraph, 6 September 2015. ===2016 Sydney elections=== In November 2015, Mandla announced that he would not run for Lord Mayor, citing the demands of his five board director roles and the upcoming birth of his seventh child as the reasons behind his decision. At the time he was presumed to be the frontrunner on the Liberal Party's ticket.Leesha McKenny, \"Sydney lord mayor contender Edward Mandla bows out of race,\" The Sydney Morning Herald, 5 November 2015. In July 2016, Mandla left the Liberal Party to run as the second candidate on independent councilor Angela Vithoulkas \"Sydney Matters\" ticket in the September 2016 council elections. Upon his exit from the party, Mandla was critical of the Liberals for being beholden to lobbyists and unelected officials. Vithoulkas and Mandla will contest incumbent Lord Mayor Clover Moore and Liberal candidate Christine Forster. ===Competitive weightlifting=== Mandla weightlifts competitively for the NSW's Titans. He won Masters Division Championships in 2012, 2013, 2017, 2019 and currently holds the NSW Masters Division record for the snatch, clean and jerk and total. He won bronze at the World Cup in 2017.
