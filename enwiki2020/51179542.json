    "text": "In mathematics, specifically in category theory, a quasi-abelian category is a pre-abelian category in which the pushout of a kernel along arbitrary morphisms is again a kernel and, dually, the pullback of a cokernel along arbitrary morphisms is again a cokernel. ==Definition== Let \\mathcal A be a pre-abelian category. A morphism f is a kernel (a cokernel) if there exists a morphism g such that f is a kernel (cokernel) of g. The category \\mathcal A is quasi-abelian if for every kernel f: X\\rightarrow Y and every morphism h: X\\rightarrow Z in the pushout diagram \\begin{array}{ccc} X & \\xrightarrow{f} & Y \\\\\\ \\downarrow_{h} & & \\downarrow_{h'}\\\\\\ Z & \\xrightarrow{f'} & Q \\end{array} the morphism f' is again a kernel and, dually, for every cokernel g: X\\rightarrow Y and every morphism h: Z\\rightarrow Y in the pullback diagram \\begin{array}{ccc} P & \\xrightarrow{g'} & Z \\\\\\ \\downarrow_{h'} & & \\downarrow_{h}\\\\\\ X & \\xrightarrow{g} & Y \\end{array} the morphism g' is again a cokernel. Equivalently, a quasi-abelian category is a pre-abelian category in which the system of all kernel-cokernel pairs forms an exact structure. Given a pre-abelian category, those kernels, which are stable under arbitrary pushouts, are sometimes called the semi-stable kernels. Dually, cokernels, which are stable under arbitrary pullbacks, are called semi-stable cokernels.Richman and Walker, 1977. ==Properties== Let f be a morphism in a quasi-abelian category. Then the induced morphism \\overline{f}:\\operatorname{cok}\\operatorname{ker}f\\rightarrow\\operatorname{ker}\\operatorname{cok}f is always a bimorphism, i.e., a monomorphism and an epimorphism. A quasi- abelian category is therefore always semi-abelian. ==Examples== Every abelian category is quasi-abelian. Typical non-abelian examples arise in functional analysis.Prosmans, 2000. * The category of Banach spaces is quasi-abelian. * The category of Fr\u00e9chet spaces is quasi-abelian. * The category of (Hausdorff) locally convex spaces is quasi-abelian. ==History== The concept of quasi- abelian category was developed in the 1960s. The history is involved.Rump, 2008, p. 986f. This is in particular due to Raikov's conjecture, which stated that the notion of a semi-abelian category is equivalent to that of a quasi- abelian category. Around 2005 it turned out that the conjecture is false.Rump, 2011, p. 44f. ==Left and right quasi-abelian categories== By dividing the two conditions in the definition, one can define left quasi-abelian categories by requiring that cokernels are stable under pullbacks and right quasi-abelian categories by requiring that kernels stable under pushouts.Rump, 2001. == Citations == == References == * Fabienne Prosmans, Derived categories for functional analysis.
