    "text": "Eucalyptus sparsifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stringybark, is a tree endemic to New South Wales. It has grey to reddish brown, stringy bark, glossy green lance-shaped leaves, spindle-shaped flower buds and more or less spherical fruit.Foliage and flower buds of E. sparsifolia ==Description== Eucalyptus sparsifolia is a tree that grows to a height of with grey to reddish brown, stringy bark. The leaves on young trees are glossy green, hairy, broadly lance-shaped long, wide and a lighter colour on the lower side. Adult leaves are narrow lance-shaped, often curved, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in groups of mostly between nine and eighteen on an angular or flattened peduncle long, individual flowers on a cylindrical pedicel up to long. The mature buds are green to yellowish, oval to spindle-shaped, long and about wide. The operculum is cone-shaped with a beaked tip, shorter than or about as long and wide as the flower cup. The stamens are white. Flowering mainly occurs from September to December. The fruit is a globe-shaped, slightly flattened capsule, long and wide. ==Taxonomy and naming== Eucalyptus sparsifolia was first formally described in 1934 by William Blakely who published the description in A Key to the Eucalypts. The specific epithet (sparsifolia) is derived from Latin (\"sparse-leaved\"), referring to the crown but is probably a misnomer. This species was formerly included with E. oblonga which included trees with a wide range of leaf widths. Those with broader leaves are now included in E. globoidea. ==Distribution and habitat== The narrow-leaved stringybark is widespread and abundant in forest and woodland in the Sydney region and as far inland as the Pilliga forest. ==References== sparsifolia Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 1934 Category:Taxa named by William Blakely ",
