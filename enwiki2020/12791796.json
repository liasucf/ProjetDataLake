    "text": "La Consolacion University Philippines is a private Roman Catholic coeducational basic and higher education institution established and administered by the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation (ASOLC) in Malolos City, Bulacan, Philippines. It was formerly named University of Regina Carmeli and in the year 2011 the Augustinian Sisters changed its name to La Consolacion University Philippines. == History == === Early beginning: 1937\u20131945 === The La Consolacion University Philippines was established in 1937 when Do\u00f1a Estefania del Rosario Vda. de Jacinto, a sister of Mother Catalina de Jesus, OSA, donated a property for the education of the children of poor families in Barasoain, Malolos. At that time, it was the only educational institution in the locality and was named Colegio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen. In May 1937, five Augustinian Sisters, with Sor Encarnacion de los Remedios as the Superior, took charge of the school when it was formally opened. In June 1937, the school was blessed and dedicated to Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, Patroness of the Parish of Barasoain, City of Malolos, Bulacan. Early Childhood Education and Elementary courses were initially offered. In 1940, three special vocational courses were opened: typing, stenography, and dressmaking. The outbreak of World War II forced the closure of the school. However, upon the insistence of the Japanese occupation forces, the school re-opened and secondary courses were offered. The operation of the school was again temporarily halted with the arrival of the American liberation forces in 1945. The school reopened later that year, with new college courses added to the school's curriculum. === 1950\u20131984 === Barasoain Campus In 1950, a two-year course for elementary education was offered. The teaching staff was composed of the intellectuals of the community. A conflagration reduced all that was once Colegio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen to ashes in October 1952. The sisters temporarily took shelter in the residence of Mrs. Julieta Santiago. Later, the students occupied the big, old house of Do\u00f1a Elisa Santiago and the improvised classrooms in the parish convent. In 1954, a new and better building was constructed. This time, the sisters concentrated their efforts in strengthening and expanding the Elementary and High School Departments. This they did by giving up the College Department and special vocational courses retaining only stenography and typing. Enrollment continued to increase in the subsequent years. The quality of instruction dramatically improved owing to the constant entry of qualified teaching personnel. Campus discipline was also strictly enforced; facilities were expanded; and new buildings were constructed. In 1965, the need was felt to reopen the College Department. More tertiary level courses were included in the curriculum. Meanwhile, the school management acquired an additional lot for the expansion of the College Campus. In 1967, the school's name was changed from Colegio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen to Regina Carmeli College. In August 1979, RCC adopted the Catholic School System Development (CS-SD) program. The Program aimed to promote strongly the formation of personnel, systematize operations and upgrade standards in preparation for the long-range plan of the school for voluntary accreditation. On August 27, 1984, a solemn ceremony took place to celebrate the laying of the cornerstone of the extension building of Regina Carmeli College on a five-hectare lot at Catmon, Malolos, Bulacan. The move manifested the desire of the institution to play a more decisive role in the education of the Bulake\u00f1os. By June 1985, the Catmon Campus was ready for occupancy. The new campus was blessed and dedicated in a solemn liturgical ceremony on July 4, 1985. === 1985\u20131995 === In November 1985, the determined efforts of the school to gain accreditation by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) took a more decisive turn when the High School and the Grade School Departments had their preliminary surveys. PAASCU accreditors visited the school, and conducted an intensive analysis and evaluation of the status of the school's readiness to measure up to PAASCU standards. Eight months later, the College Department also had its PAASCU Preliminary Survey. The year 1987 marked the RCC's 50th anniversary. The jubilation of the Golden Jubilee Year was highlighted by the benediction of the sisters' residence in Catmon and an institutional musical presentation entitled \"Color It Gold!\" The yearlong commemoration also brought about two massive projects. The beginning is the launching of RCC Outreach in Pandi, Bulacan \u2013This signaled the institution's formal entry into its community outreach ministry. The second project is the realization of the much-needed Multipurpose Hall in Catmon. Responding to the needs of the Commerce graduates from Malolos and the nearby key towns of Bulacan, the CPA Review Center was conceived and realized in May 1986. The center is proud to have produced successful CPAs and an alumnus who placed seventh in the CPA board examinations. School Year 1997\u20131998 saw the introduction of Computer Courses in the College offerings. The course Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) opened new frontiers in the desire of the school to produce competent and highly employable college graduates. During that time, BSCS ranked second to College of Commerce courses in terms of enrollment. As a social institution, RCC is aware that it is in a potentially effective position to initiate projects, which could promote the well-being of the communities in its environs. Thus, in 1987, RCC organized the Mother Rita Barcel\u00f3 Outreach and Livelihood Corporation (MRBOLC) as its community extension service unit. MRBOLC undertook community-building projects and organized communities with a view of contributing to their becoming cohesive and self-reliant. MRBOLC also extended financial, technical and consultancy services to micro cottage and small-scale business enterprises in the province. In pursuance of accreditation, the Grade School Department had its first PAASCU Formal Survey in October 1988 followed by the High School Department later. Today, both Departments have the distinction of being PAASCU accredited. The following year, the College Department followed suit. In August 1989, the Department passed its PAASCU Formal Survey. RCC then enjoyed the distinction of being the only academic institution in Bulacan that has the much-coveted PAASCU accreditation in all its academic programs from elementary to college. In June 1991, RCC formally opened its Graduate School Department. This is in furtherance of its goal of developing high-level human resources. For its initial offering, the Department accepted graduate students in the field of Behavioral Science with majors in Anthropology, Sociology and Psychology. Presently, the Graduate School also offers the Master of Science in Business Management; Master of Science in Public Administration; and Master of Arts in Education with several majors. March 31, 1991 marked a cornerstone- laying ceremony held in Catmon. The project, the new Mt. Carmel Building, to house the College Department and the Administrative Offices. The pressure of an ever-growing student population necessitated the construction of a major physical plant in Catmon. In 1992, the school also put up a preschool and grade school extension campus in Rosaryville in Guiguinto, Bulacan. As evidence of the constant desire of the institution to meet the call of the times, impact programs such as Nursing, Computer Engineering and Computer Secretarial. Were introduced in School Year 1992\u20131993. As a result of its constant search of ways on translating into concrete realities her pro-people educational thrusts, RCC launched its Adult Night High School program in 1993. The program offered free secondary education, following DECS-approved 5-year night high school curriculum. Beneficiaries of the program are the under- privileged adults who do not have the financial capability to pursue formal education beyond basic elementary schooling. The first batch of graduates was composed of three students conferred in 1998. As of 2009, the URC Night High School had produced 96 high school students. After years of extensive experience in services to the community, the MRBOLC launched in 1994 its most monumental project to date, the Mother Rita Homes. The program, funded by Committee of German Doctors for Developing Countries sought to provide initially some 200 indigent families of Malolos and Guiguinto low-cost housing units. LCUP College of Medicine building Curricular expansion as an ongoing long-range goal of the institution made significant gains in 1994 with the inclusion of four more bachelor's degree programs in the course offerings of the College Department. These courses were Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy, Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management, and Bachelor of Science in Tourism. The Graduate School as well introduced a new field of specialization in its programs. Beginning School Year 1994\u20131995, it offered Computer Assisted Instruction/Programming in its Master of Arts in Education program. To serve as laboratory and practicum venue for the new undergraduate offerings, the school built in Catmon, the Our Lady of Consolation Physical Rehabilitation Center and the Mini-Hotel and Restaurant. Opened to the public, the Rehabilitation Center offers competent health care services in the fields of Physical Therapy and Alternative Therapy. The year 1994 saw a significant redirection of the thrusts of the school leadership in the promotion of a deeper sense of Christian spirituality among the personnel and the entire school community. Thus, inspired by the philosophy of \u201ccreative education\u201d, the experience of the Catholic Church's \u201cbasic ecclesial communities\u201d and the \u201cparadigm shift\u201d sweeping the contemporary faith-life experience of the people, RCC evolved its Integral Spirituality Formation Program. The program provided the needed framework for the spiritual journey of the Carmelian community to meet the challenges of the changing times. RCC heeded the call for environmental programs through the Reforestation/Greening Program. The students, faculty, alumni and parents, spearheaded by the administrators, launched the Adopt-a-Mountain Project located in San Miguel, Bulacan on September 8, 1995. The 30-hectare area granted through a Memorandum of Agreement with DENR served as a venue where seedlings started to find their roots and let their leaves prove hope to the coming generation. 1996 \u2013 Move toward University Status RCC then, opened its Early Childhood Education Center at Catmon Campus in January 1997. Evolving from the MRBOLC's experience with community-based day care centers and a replication of what has been studied and observed by two RCC faculty members in Canada, the Center caters to six months to three-year-old children. Initially, it catered to the children of RCC personnel. After more than half a century of service to the community, the institution felt the need to raise itself to a higher level of commitment to develop Filipino Christian graduates, morally upright and imbued with the ideals of Justice, Freedom, Peace and Love. This was concretized through its plan of activities and development efforts in the pursuit of the university status. The first formal attempt to apply for a university status took place in 1993. The President sent a formal letter of intent to the Secretary of the Department of Education Culture and Sports, Hon. Isidro Cari\u00f1o together with a project proposal for the conversion of the Regina Carmeli College to a University. On June 10, 1993, RCC received the initial findings of the Office of the Secretary of the DECS. More documentary evidences were sought on the human and physical resources of the institution. The first formal visit of the newly formed Commission on Higher Education (CHED) took place on January 4, 1996. A panel of five members chaired by Dr. Roberto Padua carefully and painstakingly examined the readiness of the institution in terms of: (1) compliance of program offerings to CHED standards particularly on program accreditation requirements; (2) substantial evidence of recognized strengths in the arts, science, humanities and social science components of its courses; (3) a continuing quest for excellence and a commitment to a reasonably high standard of instruction demonstrated through the quality of its education programs, outstanding achievements of its students and excellent performance of its graduates particularly in government examinations; (4) a dynamic research program manned by qualified and competent personnel including the periodic publication of scholarly journals; and (5) a creditable community extension program involving the community within its immediate area as manned by experienced and service-oriented personnel. Two major recommendations were offered: (1) that the school should have doctorate degree holders in linguistics, mathematics, sciences, business, education and preferably in all other disciplines, and (2) the intensification of the institution's research program including the periodic publication of refereed journals. The semester immediately following the visit, management recruited and beefed up the pool of doctorate degree holders in the institution particularly in the area of linguistics and sciences. The institution likewise realigned its research priorities, considering the impact of the institution not only among students but also in the larger community. Community and industry studies were given higher priorities. The second visit of CHED was on October 17, 1996. The commissioners took cognizance of evidences of relevant program offerings in the college, high standard of structures as evidenced by the presence of qualified, competent faculty and the good performance of the graduates in government examination. However, they took notice also of the need to further upgrade the adequacy of the physical facilities of the college, its building and fa\u00e7ade. The management acted immediately on the suggestions of the CHED panel members. A comprehensive physical development plan was prepared together with the assistance of consultants. A P40-million physical development plan was submitted to the Board of Trustees for approval. The plan includes the construction of a five-story college building geared to fully meet current and future clientele needs. The edifice will house administrative offices, classroom and curricular facilities. The plan also includes the construction of an access road, and a fa\u00e7ade designed to help enhance the academic ambiance of the campus. The CHED Chairman Angel C. Alcala, together with Executive Director Catalino Rivera took time to see for themselves the applicant institution. They gave encouraging remarks with the state of progress Regina Carmeli College made particularly the creditable extensive community service programs being operated by the institution. The third visit of CHED came on February 25, 1997. A member of the Technical Panel, Dr. Cynthia Rose Bautista, joined Dr. Remigia Nathanielz representing CHED. Dr. Bautista noticed the impressive development since the school was last visited by CHED but she paid attention that is more special on the status of research in the college. She suggested that the college further refine its research thrust and develop the critical mass of researchers among the faculty. RCC management responded immediately to the suggestions. A new perspective of higher education functions for the faculty was articulated operationally and creatively defining how the trilogy of higher education functions would be implemented. The school further expanded its linkages and functional network with fifteen (15) non-government agencies, nine (9) government agencies, eight (8) professional organizations, and nine (9) educational institutions both local and foreign. Among the areas of concern were research collaboration and faculty and student's development. The year 1997 will go down in the history of URC as one of the crucial milestones in its quest for educational distinction. On October 24, 1997, it was the turn of CHED Commissioners Esther Garcia and Kate Botengan to visit the school. The Commissioners expressed appreciation of the dramatic physical improvements the college has instituted. Moreover, they expressed that the primary intention of their visit was to look into the research activities of the institution. The management also presented the new framework of research as well as the types of researches the RDEO has conducted in the last five years. It was December 4, 1997, when the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) invited the President and some members of the academic council for the much-awaited decision on the school's application for a university status. Finally, CHED en banc Resolution 144.97 officially converted Regina Carmeli College to a university status under the name University of Regina Carmeli (URC). == Mission in the third millennium == LCUP main campus (Gate 1) To live up to its mission of producing competent and excellent learners the University management reexamined its thrusts of becoming more responsive to the demands of the third millennium. A consultancy group, STREAM (Strategic Technology Research Application and Management Development Foundation, Inc.) was commissioned to conduct a one-year system's review of the University using the College of Commerce as its pilot program. It was year 2003 when URC embarked in the international accrediting arena \u2013 the ISO 9001-2000, with aim of creating an opportunity to factually review, correct, and further enhance the services it affords to its clientele; establish a concise reference of standardized practices and procedures; maintain a system that continually improves; and deliver a quality Augustinian education to its constituents. To ensure that working committees would have a good start, a series of orientation sessions were scheduled on August 2, 5, 8, and 9, 2003. Faculty members, deans of the different departments, and the non- teaching personnel were given extensive training sessions with Mr. Arnold David and Ms. Eyra Umali, experts from the Fiat Training and Consultancy, Corporation, to become well versed on the prerequisites of ISO 9001-2000 certification. On October 27, 2003, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) granted URC deregulated status, effective for five school years. URC, together with other selected private education institutions, has passed the following criteria for selection set by the CHED: (1) established as Center of Excellence or Center of Development or having the FAAP Level III Accredited programs; (2) outstanding overall performance of graduates in the licensure examinations administered by the Professional Regulation Commission; and (3) long tradition of integrity and untarnished reputation. In 2004, in compliance with the TUV requirement, URC went through its annual TUV Certification re- audit. On December 7, 2004, the University Certification status was renewed for the second time. In addition, the extension program of the University took pride in the completion of its housing projects in Negros and the approval of the multi-sectoral waste management project in Dumaguete City. The year 2005 had many dramatic events worthy of note. Sr. Carmeli Marie Catan, OSA ended her 21 years of service as president of URC on May 4, 2005. Sr. Niceta M. Vargas, OSA, was installed as second president of URC on June 4, 2005. On June 12, BarCIE officially launched mission college, URC-San Rafael in San Rafael, Bulacan initially offering Commerce and Education courses. URC purchased a piece of property fronting the main gate in July 2005 where an extension dormitory stands and ECE classrooms are located. The College of Nursing went through Level I formal Visit on August 10\u201311. A two-story canteen building was constructed in November. The URC professorial chair was revitalized with the launching of the professorial chair on Justice and Peace on December 3 marked by the inaugural lecture given by Sister Ma. Luz Mijares, OSA. On the same date, the St. Augustine International Institute for Justice and Peace was formally launched with Governor Josefina M. dela Cruz cutting the ceremonial ribbon. URC pursued the Surveillance audit of TUV on December 12\u201313, 2005. On February 8, 2006, Dr. Melencio Deauna was appointed as professorial chair holder during the launching of Professorial Chair on Test and Measurement and the URC Regional Center for Test and Measurement. In July 2006, URC became a recipient of PGMA study loan program amounting to P2, 000,000.00. URC passed the Re-certification Audit of TUV on January 18\u201319, 2007. The school purchased a lot located at Plaridel, Bulacan intended for the construction of the URC Hospital. The cornerstone laying of the hospital took place on January 20, 2007. The College of Computer Science had its PAASCU Preliminary Survey in the same year. The MSPA and MABS programs of the Graduate School were granted Level II Second Re-accredited Status, while the MBA and MAED programs granted Level II First Re-accredited Status, under PACUCOA. It was also on the same year that URC was identified as a CHED's Delivering Higher Education Institution (DHEI) in the two programs: MA in Teaching Mathematics and MA in Teaching Psychology. Once more, URC passed the Re-certification Audit of TUV on November 28, 2008. The University received a Regional Award for Outstanding Research in October 2008. URC Basic Education Department was granted Level III Accredited Status under PAASCU, one of the few programs granted such status in the country. The University with Dr. Belen as project leader won the Regional Outstanding Award in community extension project with an award of P300, 000, the title of the project was: \u201cThe University of Regina Carmeli (URC) Community Development and Extension Program and Its Organizational Feature\u201d. In March 2009, the University bestowed the Doctorate Degree Honoris Causa in Literature to Dr. Virgilio Almario, National Artist from San Miguel, Bulacan. Meanwhile, Dr. Belen B. de Jesus, Executive-Vice President, was conferred a doctorate degree: Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa by the Notre Dame of Marbel University in March 2009 for her outstanding services in advancing innovative programs for the education of the members of cultural communities in Cotabato. A first in the history of URC was the granting of Level III status by PACUCOA to the Master of Science in Public Administration program in July 2009, the second program in the country to be granted such status by PACUCOA. On October 5\u20136, PAASCU re-surveyed the LACOMED program for its Level II reaccredited status. At the same time, the Computer Science was visited for the second time also by PAASCU for Level I status. Moreover, the University was visited for second re-certification by ISO on November 12\u201313. In observance of the 12th University Foundation Day, the Foreign Language Center and the Wellness Center located at BarCIE International Hotel were blessed on December 3 at Atis Hall of the Hotel. A milestone in the history of the University was the launching of the URC Coffee Table Book bearing the title \u201cThe University of Regina Carmeli \u201cA Seventy-Year Journey toward Educational Excellence\u201d, which chronicles the history and development of URC since its birth in 1937. The year 2009 ended with another blessing \u2013 the PAASCU formal recognition of the College of Computer Science Program with Level I status. Mother Imelda Mora, OSA was elected the new provincial of the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation (ASOLC) in December 2009 replacing Mother Ma. Luz Mijares, OSA. With the change in the congregational leadership, came a search for an innovative model for managing the OSA's HEIs. It was for this reason that a team of six experts from CHED visited URC, on March 29\u201330, 2010 to ascertain the level of compliance of the University with the standards set by CHED for University status. As a prospective member of the proposed La Consolacion University System, the result of the visit proved to be an affirmation that URC has indeed done an excellent job as a University. After the LCUS CHED program review, on May 17\u201319, 2010 another set of CHED monitoring team looked into the management of the University System to test the efficiency and effectiveness of the various systems operating at URC. In the meantime to maintain the University's competitive edge the management enhanced its academic program by expanding the curricular courses to bring in new sets of students. The new nine courses are: Bachelor of Science in Psychology (BSPsyc), Bachelor of Science in Biology (BSBIO); Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIS); Bachelor of Science in Information System (BSIT); Bachelor of Science in Social Work (BSSW); Bachelor of Science in Radiologic Technology (BSRT); Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED-SPED); Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA); soon to open Master of Arts in Nursing (MAN); Master of Information Technology (MIT). In addition, the University innovated the institution's courses by moving into vocational technical programs to promote access and equity to its educational services. There are seven Voc-Tech program strands Computer Hardware Servicing NC II; Programming NC IV; Contract Center Services NCII; Food and Beverage Services NC II; Housekeeping NC II; Front Office NC II and Finishing Course for Call Center Agents NC II. All courses are designed to be opened in June 2011. In the doctoral level, the University has lately opened Doctor in Business Administration (DBA); Doctor in Educational Management with several major fields of specialization. These new courses are in keeping with the desire of the University to be relevant to students clamor to have more courses to choose from. It is appropriate to mention at this point that Dr. Reynaldo Cruz, Graduate School Dean / EVP, was a recipient of the \u201cDangal ng Lipi\u201d in Education on September 14, 2010. Sr. Niceta M. Vargas, OSA ended her five-year presidency of URC on May 3, 2010. Sr. Editha S. Zerna, OSA was installed as the third URC president on June 4, 2010. Her installation forebodes a fresh redirection for the University. Her term started with the blessing of the five-story building of the Extension of the Plaridel Emergency Hospital on October 2, 2010. URC is confident that under the care of Sr. Editha S. Zerna, OSA the University would move towards a new horizon. On January 8, 2011, by virtue of a congregational decision that schools being run by the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolacion would be under one name, \u201cLa Consolacion School/College/University\u201d, as the case maybe, management applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the change of name from URC to LCUP. On March 2, 2011, the commission approved amended articles of incorporation and by-laws of SEC-CR Reg. No. 7797 officially converting University of Regina Carmeli to La Consolacion University Philippines. With this new name, LCUP commits itself even more to be a provider of world class professionally competent human resource who can ensure the sustainability of a Christo- Centric Stewardship of his/her community.
