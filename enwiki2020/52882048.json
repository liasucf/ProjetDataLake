    "text": "Submillimeter amateur radio refers to Amateur radio activity in the sub- millimeter region (275 GHz to 3 THz) of the electromagnetic spectrum. While no international frequency allocations exist for amateur radio in the sub- millimeter region, a number of administrations permit radio amateurs to experiment on Terahertz frequencies. Amateurs who operate in the region must design and construct their own equipment, and those who do, often attempt to set communication distance records on sub-millimeter frequencies. ==ITU Radio Regulations== In the ITU Table of Frequency Allocations, no formal allocation to any radio service is present above 275 GHz, although the regulations themselves cover up to 3000 GHz (3 THz). However, a number of administrations permit amateur radio experimentation within the 275\u20133,000 GHz range on a national basis, under license conditions that are usually based on RR5.565. In ITU Radio Regulations, the range 275 \u2013 3000 GHz whilst not formally allocated, is subject to footnote 5.565; this was last revised by WRC-12 and the current version is below: 5.565 The following frequency bands in the range 275-1 000 GHz are identified for use by administrations for passive service applications: * Radio astronomy service: 275\u2013323 GHz, 327\u2013371 GHz, 388\u2013424 GHz, 426\u2013442 GHz, 453\u2013510 GHz, 623\u2013711 GHz, 795\u2013909 GHz and 926\u2013945 GHz; * Earth exploration-satellite service (passive) and space research service (passive): 275\u2013286 GHz, 296\u2013306 GHz, 313\u2013356 GHz, 361\u2013365 GHz, 369\u2013392 GHz, 397\u2013399 GHz, 409\u2013411 GHz, 416\u2013434 GHz, 439\u2013467 GHz, 477\u2013502 GHz, 523\u2013527 GHz, 538\u2013581 GHz, 611\u2013630 GHz, 634\u2013654 GHz, 657\u2013692 GHz, 713\u2013718 GHz, 729\u2013733 GHz, 750\u2013754 GHz, 771\u2013776 GHz, 823\u2013846 GHz, 850\u2013854 GHz, 857\u2013862 GHz, 866\u2013882 GHz, 905\u2013928 GHz, 951\u2013956 GHz, 968\u2013973 GHz and 985\u2013990 GHz. The use of the range 275\u20131000 GHz by the passive services does not preclude use of this range by active services. Administrations wishing to make frequencies in the 275\u20131000 GHz range available for active service applications are urged to take all practicable steps to protect these passive services from harmful interference until the date when the Table of Frequency Allocations is established in the above-mentioned 275\u20131000 GHz frequency range. All frequencies in the range 1000\u20133000 GHz may be used by both active and passive services (WRC-12) == Germany == The current frequency plan German Amateur Radio Frequencies for German amateurs includes that frequency ranges 444 \u2013 453 GHz, 510 \u2013 546 GHz, 711 \u2013 730 GHz, 909 \u2013 926 GHz, 945 \u2013 951 GHz and frequencies above 956 GHz can be used by the amateur radio service. == United Kingdom == In October 2016, the UK regulator Ofcom made available a licence variation available to Full licensees for a series of bands within the 275\u20133000 GHz range. Applications for this can be obtained online via the RSGB website,RSGB Terahertz Guidance and Licence Application which also provides guidance on its use and the 20 km protective radii around UK radio telescope sites. == United States == FCC rule FCC Part 97 Rules \u00a797.301 permits amateurs use of frequencies above 275 GHz, subject to rule \u00a797.303 Clause-f which requires:- Not causing harmful interference to radio astronomy stations: 275\u2013323 GHz, 327\u2013371 GHz, 388\u2013424 GHz, 426\u2013442 GHz, 453\u2013510 GHz, 623\u2013711 GHz, 795\u2013909 GHz, or 926\u2013945 GHz. In addition, amateur stations transmitting in the following segments must not cause harmful interference to stations in the Earth exploration-satellite service (passive) or the space research service (passive): 275\u2013277 GHz, 294\u2013306 GHz, 316\u2013334 GHz, 342\u2013349 GHz, 363\u2013365 GHz, 371\u2013389 GHz, 416\u2013434 GHz, 442\u2013444 GHz, 496\u2013506 GHz, 546\u2013568 GHz, 624\u2013629 GHz, 634\u2013654 GHz, 659\u2013661 GHz, 684\u2013692 GHz, 730\u2013732 GHz, 851\u2013853 GHz, or 951\u2013956 GHz. == Distance records == Due to the very high atmospheric absorption at submillimeter frequencies, it is difficult to establish communications over appreciable distances; however, a few radio amateurs have set distance records in the submillimeter range. The first recognized distance record was set by German stations DB6NT and DL1JIN on January 6, 1998. They achieved a distance of on 411 GHz, using SSB voice transmissions. On March 4, 2003, US stations WA1ZMS and W4WWQ set a new distance record of on 322 GHz, using wide-band frequency modulation. WA1ZMS and W4WWQ later set another record of on 403 GHz using CW (Morse code) on December 21, 2004. In Australia, a distance record on 324 GHz of was set by stations VK3KH and VK3XPD on August 21, 2011. In the UK, the current focus of activity is at 288 GHz where G8CUB and G0FDZ have progressively increased distances beyond 600m since their first two way contact on August 2,2019 == References == == External links == * UK Microwave Group's 275+ GHz page * First U.S. QSO on >400GHz - Mount Greylock Expeditionary Force * First Amateur > 1km QSO on 403GHz - Mount Greylock Expeditionary Force Category:Amateur radio bands ",
