    "text": "The following is a list of all current judges of the United States district and territorial courts. The list includes both \"active\" and \"senior\" judges, both of whom hear and decide cases. There are 89 districts in the 50 states, with a total of 94 districts including 4 territories and the District of Columbia. Each of the 50 states has between one and four Article III district courts, and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico each have one Article III district court. Article III judges have lifetime tenure. The insular areas of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands each have one Article IV territorial court. These courts are called \"district courts\" and exercise the same jurisdiction as district courts; however, Article IV territorial courts differ from Article III district courts in that territorial courts have judges who serve ten-year terms rather than lifetime tenures. As of 2020, Congress has authorized 677 district judgeships, including 667 permanent judgeships and 10 temporary judgeshipsFederal Judgeships, United States Courts., though the number of \"current\" judges will be higher than 677 because of some judges electing senior status. Only active, non-senior-status judges may fill one of the 677 authorized judgeships. In addition, a small number of judges are concurrently appointed to more than one judgeship. While some judges with senior status are currently inactive, these judges are not yet retired and may return to actively hearing cases at any time. As of September 24, 2020, there are 56 Article III district court vacancies with 33 nominations awaiting Senate action and no Article IV vacancies or nominees awaiting Senate action.Judicial Vacancies
