    "text": "\"Obviously 5 Believers\" is a song by Bob Dylan. It was recorded at Columbia Music Row Studios, Nashville on 10 March 1966, and released as the last track of side three of his double album Blonde on Blonde on 20 June 1966. ==Recording and interpretation== The song was recorded in the early morning hours of the 9\u201310 March 1966 Nashville session under the working title \"Black Dog Blues.\" Sean Wilentz feels that the song is driven by Robbie Robertson's guitar, Charlie McCoy's harmonica and Ken Buttrey's drumming. After an initial breakdown, Dylan complained to the band that the song was \"very easy, man\" and that he didn't want to spend much time on it. Within four takes, the recording was done. Take 4 was used on Blonde on Blonde, and as the B-side to the single release of \"Just Like a Woman\" in certain countries. In 2010 it was included on The Original Mono Recordings. The other three takes were released in 2015 on the Collector's Edition of The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965\u20131966. The song is similar in melody and structure to Memphis Minnie's \"Chauffeur Blues\", which was also an inspiration for '\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\". Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guedson describe \"Obviously 5 Believers\" as \"a bluesy love song about loneliness\", and Andy Gill describes it as like \"a basic love moan\", except in its apparently arbitrary references to fifteen jugglers and five believers. Clinton Heylin believes that every song Dylan recorded in Nashville for Blonde on Blonde relied on the skill of the backing musicians, but this song was \"entirely dependent on them.\" It was described by Robert Shelton as \"the best R&B; song on the album\" whereas Michael Gary dismissed it as \"a filler track ... with a repetitive and undistinguished lyric\" that was more like a song from Highway 61 Revisited than from Blonde on Blonde. Crawdaddy's assessment was that \"the vocal here is truly the entire message and on this cut we are listening to a genuine blues artist.\" Thomas Reed used the song lyric \"fifteen jugglers, five believers\" in the title of his book Fifteen Jugglers, Five Believers: Literary Politics and the Poetics of American Social Movements. ===Live Performances=== Dylan did not play the song live until 1995, when he debuted it at the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert, California on 15 May. He played it live a further 39 times before retiring it after a performance at The Charles A. Dana Center, Waltham, Massachusetts on 12 April 1997. ==Personnel== Musicians *Bob Dylan \u2013 vocals, guitar *Charlie McCoy \u2013 harmonica *Robbie Robertson \u2013 guitar *Wayne Moss \u2013 guitar *Joe South \u2013 guitar *Al Kooper \u2013 organ *Henry Strzelecki \u2013 bass guitar *Kenneth Buttrey \u2013 drums Technical *Bob Johnston \u2013 production == References == == External links == *Lyrics to \"Obviously 5 Believers\" at bobdylan.com Category:Songs written by Bob Dylan Category:Bob Dylan songs Category:1966 songs ",
