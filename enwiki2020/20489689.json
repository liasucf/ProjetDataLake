They beat Welsh side Cardiff City to the title by goal average. ==Squad at the start of the season== ==Review== After finishing 3rd the previous season and winning the FA Cup the season before, some thought that a championship under Herbert Chapman wasn't impossible. The season would see Town reach the pinnacle of football excellence and win the 1st Division. This was done with Town only having 5 different scorers all season; George Brown with 8, George Cook with 9, Clem Stephenson with 11, Billy Smith with 13 and Charlie Wilson top-scoring with 18 league goals. (Billy Johnston did score an FA Cup goal). The title went down to the last match and Town's 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest giving Town their title by goal average. ==Squad at the end of the season== ==Results== === Division One=== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center; font-size:smaller;\" |- style=\"background:#f0f6ff;\" !Date !Opponents !Home/ Away !Result F - A !Scorers !Attendance !Position |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |25 August 1923 |Middlesbrough |H |1 - 0 |C.
