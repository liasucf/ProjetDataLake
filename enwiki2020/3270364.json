    "text": "CJMS is a French language Canadian radio station located in Saint-Constant, Quebec (suburb of Montreal). It broadcasts on 1040 kHz with a daytime power of 10,000 watts and a nighttime power of 5,000 watts as a class B station, using a directional antenna with the same directional pattern day and night to protect WHO in Des Moines, Iowa. It transmits from the same site CKGM used when it was on 980 kHz near Autoroute 30 in Saint-Constant. The station has a format which is part-time country music and part-time talk and infomercials. Despite having advertising itself as a country-formatted station, it was generally viewed as a talk/infomercial station which airs country music in non-key dayparts. ==History== Initially, Michel Mathieu and Andr\u00e9 Turc\u00f4t wanted to obtain the frequency deserted by CJMS 1280, but the CRTC privileged this frequency to station CFMB. In November 1997, they requested 1320 KHz, which belonged to CJSO of Sorel. On September 28, 1998, Michel Mathieu, on behalf of a company to be incorporated, was approved for the frequency 1320 KHz, with a daytime power of 5,000 watts and a nighttime power of 3,000 watts.Decision CRTC 98-456 In November 1998, because of the destructive effects of the ice storm of January 1998, which felled five of the six former CKGM transmission towers, Michel Mathieu and Andr\u00e9 Turc\u00f4t returned to the CRTC to request the 1040 KHz, formerly occupied by CHRS of Saint-Jean-sur- Richelieu, belonging to Michel Mathieu. The CRTC gave its response in March 1999.Decision CRTC 99-69 On April 25, 1999, the anniversary of CJMS 1280, CJMS was broadcasting on frequency 1040 kHz, with a daytime transmission power of 5,000 watts and a nighttime transmission power of 1,100 watts. The erection of a third tower would make it possible to increase the power, at night, from 1,100 to 3,000 watts. In 2001, Michel Mathieu sold his 60% interest in CJMS to Communications M\u00e9dialex inc. (Alexandre Azoulay). Logo of CJMS under Alexandre Azoulay's ownership. During a period of several years beginning in the early-2000s, CJMS had a history of chronic non-compliance of its license terms. Such violations have included failures to submit logger tapes, submit annual reports, meet French-language music quotas, provide a proper Canadian talent development contribution, broadcast local news, and provide a list of its musical selections. On November 5, 2013, the CRTC had summoned the station's owners to a hearing at its Gatineau headquarters to discuss its actions, due to the station's continual non-compliance.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2013-448-1, September 6, 2013.Fagstein: \"CRTC threatens to pull licence of CJMS 1040\", September 6, 2013. At the hearing, station owner Alexandre Azoulay claimed that the non-compliance was due to his father, who was suffering from dementia. He also mentioned that he was also in the process of selling CJMS to another broadcaster, who owns one other station in the region, though he refused to say who that party was. The board then explained that the CRTC usually does not transfer or amend licenses of stations that were found out of compliance. Azoulay then agreed to provide documentation of the sale to the board within 24 hours after the hearing.Fagstein: \"CJMS blames non-compliance on father\u2019s dementia, says station has been sold\", November 6, 2013. Within one-to-two months after the hearing, the CRTC may impose sanctions on the station, or even mandate that its license is suspended, not renewed, or cancelled. It would also decide whether or not to accept the sale, or force the purchasing party to apply for a new license. In September 2014, it was announced that Groupe M\u00e9dias Pam Inc., the owners of ethnic station CJWI 1410 AM, announced plans to acquire the station; its decision will be decided on at a CRTC hearing on November 12, 2014 in Gatineau.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2014-472 September 12, 2014. Groupe M\u00e9dias Pam plan on keeping the country format, though they intend on making the station more marketable to younger listeners, as well as plans to simulcast CJWI during drive-time periods. CJMS and CJWI both share a broadcasting site at Saint-Constant; the sale would bring the property under a single owner.Fagstein: \"CPAM owner agrees to buy CJMS 1040 for $15,000, keep it country\", September 13, 2014. On December 11, 2014, the sale was approved by the CRTC,Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2014-641 and Broadcasting Orders CRTC 2014-642 and 2014-643, December 11, 2014. which on that date the station was rebranded as 1040 AM, L'authentique.Fagstein: \"CRTC approves purchase of CJMS 1040 AM\", December 11, 2014. CJMS's license was also renewed through August 31, 2017 - a shorter term than usual, due to violations that were incurred under Azoulay's ownership. On July 31, 2020, due to administrative failures, complaints that content from CJWI station, a Montreal radio station aimed at the Haitian community, was broadcast simultaneously at prime time on CJMS, and that the station continued to broadcast messages and promotions featuring the voice of a former host who died two years ago, the CRTC denies the station's license renewal and must cease broadcasting on August 31, 2020.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2020-239, CJMS Saint-Constant \u2013 Non-renewal of licence, CRTC, July 31, 2020 On September 1, 2020 at midnight, CJMS ceased broadcasting on AM band at the frequency 1040 kHz. A few hours later, the station resumed broadcasting. Groupe M\u00e9dia Pam Inc. has been granted a stay to continue broadcasting until the case is heard on appeal. On September 10, 2020, at 5:29 pm, the station ceased broadcasting again. On September 28, 2020, the station went back on air.
