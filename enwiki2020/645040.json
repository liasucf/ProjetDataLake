He got the idea following a post-World War II trip to the United States: He was impressed by the country's efficient, high-volume stores. He established the company in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden, in 1947 selling women's clothing, calling it Hennes, Swedish for \"hers.\" In 1968, Persson acquired the premises and inventory of a Stockholm hunting equipment store named Mauritz Widforss. In 1982, his son, Stefan Persson took over as the Managing Director, and today is the Chairman of the Board.
