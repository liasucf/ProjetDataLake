    "text": "Chrevrolet Assembly Division was a designation applied from 1945\u20131965 to a group of factories operated by General Motors. Plants operated under Chevrolet Assembly management prior to General Motors Assembly Division management (most established pre-1945). Additional Chevrolet Assembly plants were located at Buffalo, New York (Tonawanda Engine) and Oakland, California. Framingham, Massachusetts is unusual in that it changed from Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly management to Chevy management prior to becoming GMAD. The terminology is confusing because most plants assembled more than just Chevrolet or B-O-P, and refers to the management structure only. The five brands originated vehicles from their respective \"home\" plants, where vehicles were assembled locally for their respective regions. Vehicles were also produced in \"knock-down\" kits and sent to the branch assembly locations. The \"home\" branches were Flint, Michigan for both Buick and Chevrolet; Oldsmobile at Lansing, Michigan; Pontiac at Pontiac, Michigan; and Cadillac at Detroit, Michigan. As of March 6, 2019, the only plant that remains open from the old CAD Division is the Flint Truck Assembly. *St. Louis Truck Assembly, St. Louis, Missouri *Janesville Assembly, Janesville, Wisconsin *Norwood Assembly, Norwood, Ohio *Flint Truck Assembly, Flint, Michigan *North Tarrytown Assembly, Tarrytown, New York *Lakewood Assembly, Atlanta, Georgia *Leeds Assembly, Kansas City, Missouri *Baltimore Assembly, Baltimore, Maryland *Van Nuys Assembly, Los Angeles, California *Willow Run Assembly, Ypsilanti, Michigan *Framingham Assembly, Framingham, Massachusetts *Lordstown Assembly, Lordstown, Ohio ==References== Category:General Motors ",
