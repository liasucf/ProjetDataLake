    "text": "Alboran Trio is an Italian jazz piano trio consisting of Paolo Paliaga (piano), Gigi Biolcati (drums and percussion) and Dino Contenti (bass). The name is derived from the uninhabited Mediterranean island of Albor\u00e1n, which lies between the Andalusian coast and North Africa. It is intended both to emphasize a mystical atmosphere of music and to point to the influence of European musical tradition and the African roots of rhythm. ==History== The trio was formed in 2004. After a 2005 tour of various Italian cities they released in 2006 their debut album Meltemi, which was on the whole well received by the press followed by several concerts in other European countries. In 2008, they released their second studio album, Near Gale. Both albums were released by German jazz label ACT Music. ==Style== The style of the trio is characterized by a great interplay and the solo role of each component. Starting from the trio concept descending from Bill Evans going from Keith Jarrett to Brad Mehldau, the trio explores new sounds researching sounds and rhythms from different traditions, from Balkan music to the rhythms of African tradition, passing from the Latin American music, trying to renew the sound of the most classic jazz groups. ==Discography== *2006: Meltemi (ACT Music) *2008: Near Gale (ACT Music) ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Label Band Informations * Paolo Paliaga official website * Dino Contenti official website Category:Italian jazz ensembles Category:Musical groups established in 2004 Category:Italian jazz musicians ",
