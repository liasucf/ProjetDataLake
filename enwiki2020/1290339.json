Due south of Peters is the crater Moigno. This is not a particularly prominent feature, having a low rim and an interior floor that has been almost completely submerged by lava flows. The rim is circular and only lightly worn, with a notch along the southeast. The inner surface is level and almost featureless. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
