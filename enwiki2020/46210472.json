    "text": "Jimmy DeLoach Parkway is a parkway in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is located a few miles northwest of the main part of Savannah. It is a road that links US 80/SR 17/SR 26 in Bloomingdale with SR 21 Alt. in Port Wentworth. It also has an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95). It was named after Jimmy DeLoach, former mayor of Garden City and Chatham County commissioner for District 7. The parkway is planned to be extended along part of Bloomingdale Road to I-16 and have a concurrency with SR 17 for the entire length of the extension. SR 17's former path is planned to become SR 17 Spur. It is planned to be designated as SR 1251 until it opens. Construction began in 2018. ==Route description== The parkway starts at an at-grade intersection with US 80/SR 17/SR 26 in the central part of Bloomingdale. The highway then heads to the northeast, and then curves to the north-northeast. It makes a gradual curve to the east-northeast. Just west of Towler Road, it begins a curve to the northeast and then leaves Bloomingdale and enters the northern part of Pooler. After curving back to the east-northeast, the parkway leaves Pooler just east of an intersection with the southern terminus of Triple B Trail and enters the far northwestern part of Savannah. It curves to the northeast and then to the southeast just before an interchange with exit 106 on Interstate 95 (I-95). The parkway then begins a curve back to the east-northeast just before an intersection with Crossroads Parkway. It travels on a bridge over some railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway and then on another bridge over some railroad tracks of CSX. Just east of an intersection with the northern terminus of Portside Court and the southern terminus of Logistics Way, the parkway curves to the southeast. A short distance later, it curves back to the east-northeast. On the Savannah\u2013Port Wentworth line, it travels on a bridge over some railroad tracks of CSX and SR 21/SR 30\\. The parkway then enters Port Wentworth proper and has an interchange with SR 21 Alternate (SR 21 Alt.; Sonny Dixon Interchange / Jimmy DeLoach Connector). Here, the parkway's mainline ends, and the roadway continues as the connector. ==History== Between the beginning of 1986 and the beginning of 1990, the roadway that would eventually become part of the parkway was established as Godley Road between US 80/SR 26 in the northern part of Bloomingdale to SR 21/SR 30 in the central part of Port Wentworth. By the beginning of 1993, a revamping of this road was proposed from SR 17 in the southwestern part of Bloomingdale to SR 21/SR 30 just north of its eastern terminus. However, by the beginning of 1997, this plan was canceled. In 2017, it was planned to extended Jimmy DeLoach Parkway from its current southern terminus at US 80/SR 17/SR 26, partially along the path of Bloomingdale Road (from SR 17's current southern terminus at I-16 to just south of its intersection with the northern terminus of Pine Barren Road). Construction on the extension began in 2018. ===Namesake=== James \"Jimmy\" DeLoach was a Democrat. He served three terms as Mayor of Garden City from 1973 to 1979. In 1980, he was elected to a four-year term as Chatham County commissioner for District 7. He was re-elected in 1984 and 1988. He did not run for re-election in 1992. His son Eddie, who is a Republican, succeeded him; and went on to become the 66th Mayor of Savannah. ==Future== The at-grade intersection at Jimmy DeLoach Parkway's current western terminus is to be converted into a full diamond interchange. The extension of the parkway is planned to be designated as SR 1251 until it is opened. The former alignment of SR 17 is planned to be redesignated as SR 17 Spur. Also, the eastern end of Osteen Road, which lies on the right-of-way of the extension, is to be shifted to the west. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * Category:Transportation in Chatham County, Georgia Category:Roads in Savannah, Georgia ",
