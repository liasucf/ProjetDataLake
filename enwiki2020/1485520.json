His integral was the first to be able to integrate all derivatives. Among his students is Gustave Choquet. He is also known for the more general broad Denjoy integral, or Khinchin integral. Denjoy was an Invited Speaker of the ICM with talk Sur une classe d'ensembles parfaits en relation avec les fonctions admettant une d\u00e9riv\u00e9e seconde g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e in 1920 at Strasbourg and with talk Les equations differentielles periodiques in 1950 at Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1931 he was the president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France. In 1942 he was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences and was its president in 1962. Denjoy married in 1923 and was the father of 3 sons. He died in Paris in 1974.
