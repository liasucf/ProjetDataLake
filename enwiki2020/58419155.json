Involving more than 20 artists in the United States, Europe, and Australia, and covering almost 20 years production, it is one of the most extensive artworks of conceptual art and is regarded as an important influence on both conceptual art and contemporary art. > I don't understand quite a good deal of what is said by Art-Language, but I > admire the investigatory energies, the tireless spade-work (not calling one > one), the full commitment to the reestablishment of a valid language by > which to discuss art and the occasional humour in their writings.

Lippard, New York Praeger, 1973, p151 ==Background== The name Art & Language is derived form the journal Art- Language that was published by Art & Language Press.Paying Hommage to Art & Language revolutionaries, BBC, 2003.NTS Live, Art & Language Art & Language Press had been created in 1968 to give a publication arm to the ongoing conversation between the four founders of Art & Language, (Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Harold Hurrell), and also between Art & Language and other artists in America or other parts of the world.Art & Language New York Archives, The Getty Museum, Los AngelesArt & Language, Robert Bailey, 2012. Strong connections have been made over time between the British artists of Art & Language and American artists, in 1966, Michael Baldwin who has just been rewarded a Prize from the Northern Young Contemporaries, spent the money on a trip to New York, to meet and discuss with Donald Judd, Roy Lichtenstein, and Robert Morris. In November 1967, thanks to Robert Smithson, arts magazine, a New York-based magazine, published for the first time a text-work of Art & Language (before the foundation of the group) titled Remarks on Air-Conditioning, an Extravaganza of Blandness written by Michael Baldwin. It is interesting to note Michael Baldwin is presented as an English writer and an artist concerned with the non- exhibition.Remarks on Air-Conditioning An Extravaganza of Blandness, Michael Baldwin, arts magazine, November 1967.Art & Language International, Robert Bailey, 2016. In 1969, Art Press, was produced in New York by Ian Burn and Mel Ramsden. In it they published their own text-works as well as items by Adrian Piper, Sol LeWitt and Stephen Kaltenbach or independent works of them like the opera Victorine. ==History== Art-Language: The Journal of Conceptual Art was published by Art & Language Press,Art-Language, Centre Pompidou. it is regarded as an important influence on both conceptual art and contemporary art.Art & Language The Unfinished Legacy, Fernando Frances, Flash Art, February 20116 most important artist run magazines, Maya Harakawa, December 2015, artspace.com Looking at Art_Language Art & Language Press was founded at the same time as an art practice under the name Art & Language in 1968 by four artists, Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, Harold Hurrell, and David Bainbridge.Art & Language comes to Rhona Hoffman They were also the editors of the first volume published in May 1969. Art-Language Vol.1 Nr.1 Terry Atkinson spent the summer of 1969 with Joseph Kosuth in New York, and in August of that year, Joseph Kosuth became the American editor of Art-Language.Status and priority - Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Harold Hurrell, Studio International 179, January 1970 From the second volume, the journal was edited both in the United Kingdom and in the United States,Reflections on conceptual art Voices Off, Critical Inquiry Essays by members of Art & Language appeared regularly in Studio International, and in February 1970, the general editor and art critic Charles Harrison published an article titled Notes Towards Art Work, arguing that \u2033The only alternative to criticism is art\u2033.Notes Towards Art Work - Charles Harrison, Studio International 180, February 1970 In 1971, having resigned from Studio International, he became the general editor of Art-Language. In 1971, Terry Atkinson had also met Ian Burn and Mel Ramsden in New York in 1969 and, having published a number of text-works as the Society for Theoretical Art and Analyses, they joined with Art-Language that year.We are cell arent we?: Art & Language and the Documenta Index - William Wood, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, October 1992 At the same time in Coventry, David Rushton, Philip Pilkington and Graham Howard, three Art Theory students of Baldwin, Bainbridge and Atkinson began to work under the name of Art & Language. In that year Coventry College of Art was transformed into the Faculty of Art and Design, part of Lanchester Polytechnic.Coventry University celebrates 175th Birthday, Laura Hartley, Coventry telegraph, May 2018 The new dean of the faculty, saw it as his task to bring an end to the Art-Theory course. > In the summer of 1971, the Art-Theory course was dismantled by arbitrary > exercise of power and Baldwin and Bainbridge dismissed along with some other > members of the part-time staff.

The journal continued to be published until 1985, and the implications of the indexes of 1972-3 persisted in bearing in various ways \u2013 and to a greater and lesser extent upon its content. A new series appeared in 1994, continuing for three issues until 1999. Apart from Baldwin, Ramsden and Harrison, into whose hands the work of Art & Language had been taken by 1976, its contributors included Philip Pilkington and Paul Wood. Further Essays on Art & Language, Charles Harrison , The MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 2001 ===Editors=== The first number was edited by Art & Language, Joseph Kosuth became the American editor from August 1969 until 1972, and Art & Language remained the English editors. In 1971, Charles Harrison became the general editor of Art-Language, and he remained so until the last volume. ==Contents== Given the desire for anonymity attached to the members of the group, it is difficult to know who did what in Art & Language. Nevertheless, the authors of the articles are named in the first seven issues of the magazine, and from 1974, all texts are collectively attributed to Art & Language. But, since during the internal problems that the group encountered between 1975 and 1976, the name Art & Language remained in the hands of Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison, it is logical to give them the authorship of the texts from Volume 3 Number 4. ==Critical review== *Daniel Buren: > To lend support to their pseudo-cultural references and to their bluffing > games, with a complacent display of questionable scholarship, certain > artists attempt to explain what conceptual art would be, could be or should > be -thus making a conceptual work.
