    "text": "Log Jammed is the 91st animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on April 20, 1959, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== French-Canadian lumberjack Pierre de Woodchopper (Daws Butler) finds a suitable tree for chopping \u2013 a tree which is, of course, Woody Woodpecker's happy home. He must desert his tree-home as it falls into the river with other logs, thanks to the woodchopper's axe. But it becomes the lone log that controls the log jam. If it should fall, the jam would break and wreck Pierre's mill down the river. Woody vows vengeance. He begins to peck some alterations, and a struggle with Pierre ensues. Years later, we see Pierre, with a long, white beard, still guarding his log, and Woody, with another white beard, on the same site emitting a shaky geriatric laugh. ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1959\".
