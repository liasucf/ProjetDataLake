    "text": "Chicken on a Chain #CC is a retired Professional Bull Riders (PBR) bucking bull who won the 2007 World Champion Bull. He was awarded the 2015 Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor. He bucked for 7 years, a total of 127 times; 33 of those times he was ridden at all levels. Chicken on a Chain finished his career with 130 outs (80 of them were at Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) events). The 2007 World Champion bull holds a career average of 45 points per out and \"arguably became the most popular bucking bull in PBR history\". At the time he was active he was the only bucking bull in PBR history with more than 100 outs and an average career score of 45 or higher. Today, Chicken on a Chain is still considered one of the most popular bucking bulls. An article published on the PBR website December 15, 2016 puts him in this list \"PBR Tough 10: Baddest Buckers.\" == Background == Little information about Chicken's parentage is known, except that his sire was #599 Scar. In 2006, Robinson purchased Chicken on a Chain from a family \"out in the sticks\" in South Carolina. This is where the story of how Chicken got his name comes in. According to Robinson's bull handler, Clint Haas: > They went down 'ner and they knocked on the door and this little boy come to > the door. They was like, 'We're here to pick up that bull.' That little boy > says, 'Yes, dad told me you could have him, but said on one condition: he > had to leave his name the same.' And Jeff's like, 'What his name?' And he > says, 'Chicken on a Chain.' Jeff's like, 'Ok, how'd he get that name?' The > boy says, 'That mean mother (expletive) got out and run through' \u2013 they had > them, they was into cock fighting. You know how they got all them roosters > staked out with a chain on the foot to keep them in place? Apparently he'd > run through the prized fighting chickens and got the best rooster's chain > wrapped around his foot. That little boy said it took us a damn two weeks to > catch the son of gun to get the chain off. He drug a dead chicken for two > weeks. After that they called him Chicken on a Chain. For the bulk of that first year, the bull was mean and difficult, and Robinson contemplated selling. However, instead he \"loaded him on his trailer and hauled him around from one Touring Pro Division event to another for much of the year\". A couple of years after purchasing Chicken, he had a couple dozen more bulls. \"You hear in sports where one guy carries a team,\" Robinson said. \"Well, this bull carried me. He gave me the opportunity to be where I'm at. Without him I wouldn't be where I'm at, no doubt.\" Chicken on a Chain was a huge bull, and in his stock contractor's own words, he was described as, \"impossible to miss.\" Black with lighter brown spots, he had huge horns. With a big white stripe that went all the way down his face, he weighed in at more than 2,100 pounds, and was called a \"freak of nature\" by many of the top PBR riders of the world because of his massive size and his athleticism. == Career == Although Chicken on a Chain was purchased by stock contractor Jeff Robinson in 2006, Blue Collar comedian Larry the Cable Guy and Mike Tedesco also bought an interest in the bull that year. Chicken is just one of a few other bulls that Robinson co-owns with celebrities. Chicken is co-owned by Robinson, Tedesco Buckin' Bulls, and Larry the Cable Guy. Robinson states, \"He just called me one day and said he was interested in the bulls and it just went from there.\" Chicken competed in the PBR from 2005 to 2012. By 2007 he hit his peak buck-off percentage and was voted the World Champion Bull that year. That same year, he bucked off a career best of 94.44 percent of the riders. He went on 18 outs, 12 of which were on the BFTS. He bucked off 17 of those 18, with only 1 rider getting a qualified ride. That year, Justin McBride made the whistle for 93 points. His average bull score for the whole year was 46.188. One of his more famous outings occurred when Renato Nunes rode him in St. Louis for 95.75 points in 2008. This outing brought them the 11th spot on the list of highest scores in PBR history at that time. The second highest score is 96 points, and the highest score 96.5. In 2009, Chicken was about a year past recovery from serious complications of kidney stones, and was \"moving into a senior year age bracket for bucking bulls\". But in September 2009, he was getting ready to buck at the BFTS in Springfield, Missouri. He was one of the top ranked bulls scheduled to perform and \"he can still move plenty fast enough to buck cowboys\" into the dirt or into 90+ rides. As Robinson says, \"So the moral to my story: Just because someone gets sick doesn't mean that they're done.\" Brett Hoffman, who writes articles for PBR, said, \"One huge factor that impresses me about Chicken on a Chain is he's big and can move. I really admire any larger bull who can be compared to an offensive lineman in size and a defensive back in speed. That's one reason that I became a huge fan of the late Bodacious in the mid 1990s.\" > You just don't see bulls that big that can move like that.\" Robinson said of > Chicken on a Chain. \"The bad thing about this is you just don't come across > bulls like that much anymore. Cody Lambert says all of the time that Chicken > on a Chain is a throwback (to earlier eras of bull riding). He's a throwback > to the kind of bulls that they used to get on, bulls that were big and stout > and mean. Brett Hoffman again, \"The good news is that Chicken on a Chain is back and is going strong. He'll always stand out in my mind, and without a doubt, he's a big hit with many fans.\" \"I had a guy come up to me one time and said Chicken on a Chain is my favorite bull,\" Robinson said. \"I asked, 'Why?' The guy said something to the effect that he had the look, the attitude and the name and when it comes to bucking bulls, you just don't get that total package.\" Chicken's last out came at the PBR World Finals at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Chicken on a Chain went head to head with two-time World Champion bull riding legend Chris Shivers. That night and first ride for Shivers was Chicken's final ride. After Chris lasted 6.73 seconds on Chicken, he bucked off and Chicken won his last ride before retiring. Shivers still had one more ride the next night and then he also was going to retire. As of 2015, Chicken on a Chain at the end of his career, he had a total of 130 outs. And 80 of those 130 outs were at the BFTS level. Chicken on a Chain finished his career with an average of 45 points per out. At that time, he was the only bull in the PBR who had more than 100 outs and that average score of 45 points (or higher). He was ranked fourth on the list of 90-point ride producers. He was the high-marked bull 41 times out of all of those 80 BFTS events he participated in. Of the 27 times he was ridden in his career, only 13 times did the rider win the round. As of December 2016, he was ranked 65th. Chicken on a Chain qualified for the PBR World Finals six out of the seven years he competed, earning an average bull score of 44.98. Brendon Clark said, > I remember seeing him at some Touring Pro (Division events), early on, and > he was really wild. For a bull his size, super-athletic is the best way to > explain him doing it at this level. That's amazing. He's a bull that went > for a long time without getting ridden, and then some of the best rides I've > seen have been from that bull. Justin McBride and Renato Nunes are two that > come to mind. He was an exceptional bull. Ben Jones said, \"He was big and had two horns as big as baseball bats, so if you were going to get him rode you had to be a bull rider. You couldn't be half-hearted.\" J.B. Mauney said, > When I first saw that bull he was probably the meanest bull I had ever seen. > I hung up on him a few times and that got pretty scary. He's a big ol' bull > and he's been great for a long time. There are not many bulls that can go > that long, travel as many miles as he traveled and still be that good. He'll > go down as being one of the best bulls ever. He had heart, plus he weighed > about 2,000 pounds. Chicken on a Chain was and is a fan favorite. He is a very athletic bull who has been very successful each year he has been in the PBR. He is introduced to \"the loudest standing ovation\". === Honors === * Co-Bull of the PBR Finals, 2007 * ProBullStats Hall of Honor * 2007 PBR World Champion Bull * 2015 PBR Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor == References == == External links == * Chicken on a Chain retiring * Chicken on a Chain (Bucking Bull) \u2013 07 PBR Finals * TOP RIDE: Justin McBride conquers the legendary Chicken on a Chain * ABBI American Bucking Bull, Inc. * Probullstats website Chicken on a Chain's career stats * Chicken on a Chain Brand of Honor Category:Individual bulls in sport Category:Bucking bulls Category:Professional Bull Riders: Heroes and Legends ",
