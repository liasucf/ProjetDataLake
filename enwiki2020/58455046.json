    "text": "Franz von Gernerth was an Austrian lawyer, composer and music writer. == Life == Franz Elder von Gernerth (born December 14, 1821 in Purkersdorf, died November 11, 1900 in Vienna) worked as a judge at the Higher Regional Court in Vienna after studying law first in Hungarian, from 1860 in the Austrian judicial service . As a writer he wrote contributions to the August 1840-42 published music journal \"Orpheus\" as well as song lyrics, as a composer he set to music in addition to his own especially those of his contemporaries. Gernerth is still known today for his text version of the waltz on the beautiful blue Danube. Since Josef Weyl's original verses were strongly related to current events, the work was seldom performed in the choral version. As a member of the Wiener M\u00e4nnergesang-Verein, to which Johann Strauss (Sohn) had dedicated this work, he wrote a new text in 1889, which now also took into account the title of the waltz and helped the work to a rebirth. The first performance with Gernerths words took place on July 2, 1890 during a summer Liedertafel of the association in Dreher ParkSch\u00f6nbrunner Stra\u00dfe 307 in Meidling instead. In old age he suffered from increasing visual impairment. Gernerth married to a sister of the writer Andreas Freiherr von Stifft. His grave is located in the Hietzinger cemetery. == Family == * Balthsar Gernerth, born February 6, 1762 in Ochusenfurt near W\u00fcrzburg, died 1863 in Biberach, Germany. * Franz Joseph Gernerth, born October 17, 1791 in Biberach, died October 13, 1832 in Vienna, Austria. * Franz von Paula Andreas Balthasar Karl Edler von Gernerth, born December 14, 1812 in Purkersdorf, died January 11, 1900 in Vienna. * Emmerich Andreas Franz from Paula, born March 14, 1857 in \u00d6denburg, Hungary, died April 3, 1929 in Vienna.
