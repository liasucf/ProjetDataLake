    "text": "Nicolae Dobrin (; 26 August 1947 \u2013 26 October 2007) was a Romanian footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. Nicknamed G\u00e2scanul (\"The Gander\") or Prin\u021bul din Trivale (\"The Prince of Trivale\"), he is considered one of Romania's greatest footballers. Renowned for his dribbling ability, Dobrin received the Romanian Footballer of the Year award on three occasions, in 1966, 1967, and 1971, and has a stadium in native Pite\u0219ti named after him. ==Club career== Dobrin was born in Pite\u0219ti, Arge\u0219 County, and he played for the first time in a First Division game when he was still 14, on 1 July 1962, in the match between \u0218tiin\u021ba Cluj and Dinamo Pite\u0219ti. He played for Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti for 22 years, and only one year for another team, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te; Dobrin refused to play for any other First Division clubs, such as Dinamo Bucharest or Universitatea Craiova. Dobrin's contribution was essential to the 1979 Championship win for FC Arge\u0219, when he scored in extra time to defeat Dinamo 4\u20133. Dobrin took the ball from the middle of the pitch, knocked off every player that tried to take the ball away from him and when he reached the penalty area he hit the ball so accurate that it went past the goalkeeper Ani\u021bei, hit the left post and entered the goal. The ball had a message attached to it from Dobrin to the Ani\u021bei. The message was:\"Leave it there because there's nothing you can do about it.\" This was just one of Dobrin's many ways of humiliating his opponents. Dobrin (left) with Ilie Balaci in 1988 During his whole career, Dobrin played 409 matches, scoring 111 goals in all. He was named Romanian Player of the Year in 1966, 1967 and 1971. He played his last game on 14 June 1983, when FC Arge\u0219 faced Bihor Oradea (the match ended 2\u20130 in favor of FC Arge\u0219). In 2007, Dobrin was the technical director of FC Arge\u0219. Dobrin is also known for famously missing out on a transfer to Real Madrid. After playing them in a European Cup game and scoring a goal, Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, their famous president was so impressed with Dobrin's skills that he wanted to transfer him to the Spanish team for a reported fee of $ 2 million, a huge amount of money for that time. Because of the communist regime in Romania in that period, Bernab\u00e9u had to hold talks with Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu himself, but could not persuade him, because Dobrin was regarded as a \"national treasure\" and such values could not be \"estranged\", especially not playing in a team from the country of Francisco Franco's fascist dictatorship. It is said that this was the biggest regret of Dobrin's life, although he did eventually end up playing in Gento's testimonial, in the famous \"blanco\" shirt of Real Madrid. On this occasion Santiago Bernab\u00e9u made a last unsuccessful attempt to keep the Romanian player in Madrid. ==International career== Dobrin played 48 games for the Romanian national team, scoring six times, and contributed to Romania's qualification for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. However, he did not play in it even though he was in the finals squad. ==Death== Dobrin died on 26 October 2007 in the intensive care unit of the County Hospital in Pite\u015fti. This came as a result of multiple organ failure, in turn caused by lung cancer. On 29 October 2007, his funeral ceremony, held at St. George's Cathedral and at St. George's Military Cemetery, was attended by more than 5,000 people (including Nicolae Dic\u0103 and Adrian Neaga from Steaua Bucharest and D\u0103nu\u021b Coman from Rapid Bucharest who were coached by Dobrin in their youth years). ==Honours== ===Club=== Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti *Divizia A: 1971\u201372, 1978\u201379 ===Individual=== *Romanian Footballer of the Year: 1966, 1967, 1971 ==References== ==External links== *Official website * * Category:1947 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Romania Category:Deaths from multiple organ failure Category:Sportspeople from Pite\u0219ti Category:Romanian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:FC Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti players Category:FCM T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te players Category:Romania international footballers Category:1970 FIFA World Cup players Category:Romanian football managers Category:FC Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti managers ",
