For example: * \u092d\u0943\u0924 \u0e20\u0e3a\u0e24\u0e15 \"carried\" (base form, nowadays called zero grade) * \u092d\u0930\u0923 \u0e20\u0e23\u0e13 \"burden\" (gu\u1e47a, full grade) * \u092d\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0e20\u0e32\u0e23\u0e3a\u0e22 \"to be carried\" (v\u1e5bddhi, lengthened grade) In modern Indo-European linguistics it is used in P\u0101\u1e47ini's sense, but not restricted to Sanskrit but applicable to the Indo-European languages in general as well as to the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language from which this feature was inherited: * The asterisk * indicates that a form is not directly attested, but has been reconstructed on the basis of other linguistic material. (zero grade of the reconstructed verb meaning \"to carry\") * (full grade) * (v\u1e5bddhi, lengthened grade) ==V\u1e5bddhi-derivations== A v\u1e5bddhi-derivation or v\u1e5bddhi- derivative is a word that is derived by such lengthening, a type of formation very common in Sanskrit, but also attested in other languages. Such derivatives signify \"of, belonging to, descended from\". An example: * PIE \"father-in-law\" (Vedic Sanskrit ) \u2192 \"relating to one's father-in-law\" (Vedic \"relating to one's father-in-law\", Old High German sw\u0101gur \"brother-in-law\") Derivatives that are formed by inserting a full grade (as opposed to a lengthened grade) vowel into the \"wrong\" position of a zero grade are also called v\u1e5bddhi-derivations: * PIE , zero grade of \"sky\"\u2192 \"god, sky god\" (Vedic , Latin deus, etc.) ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:Sanskrit Category:Vyakarana Category:Indo-European linguistics ",
