The competition goal is not only to create new scientific information, but to influence society. Multidisciplinary teams consisting of experts from the academic and artistic communities, the business world, the public and third sectors, media and other actors of the society are welcome to take part in the competition. Participating teams are evaluated by the jury using the following criteria: originality, creativity, impact, focus on solutions and use of science-based methods. The competition prize is 375,000 euros and it is meant for the implementation of the solution. Helsinki Challenge was held for the first time in 2015.

The winner was NEMO \u2013 Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction, which received \u20ac250,000, while the runner-up, Biodiversity Now, received \u20ac125,000. The prize money is intended for realising the team's idea. NEMO is developing new ways to digitise and transmit emotion online. The team is planning small add-ons for digital interaction platforms that would consider emotions. This way participants in online discussions could see or even experience the emotions of others in a new way that would be equivalent to natural interaction. The team wants to create an open protocol for emotion transmission for any coder to use for building new empathy-enabling applications. Biodiversity Now team wants to establish a Finnish habitat bank so that, for example, companies reducing biodiversity through a construction project could offset this by increasing biodiversity elsewhere.https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/the-internet-of-empathy- receives-the-helsinki-challenge-prize- of-250000?publisherId=1807796&releaseId;=36507619 ==Helsinki Challenge 2016\u20132017== The second Helsinki Challenge was kicked off in August 2016.
