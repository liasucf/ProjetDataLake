    "text": "Lowell Herb Co is a California-based organic cannabis farm. Lowell uses only organic fertilizer and all-natural materials during the farming process. The company sells packs of pre-rolled joints in varying blends including seasonal crops. Lowell has been recognized as the top preroll brand in California and received support from celebrities such as Mark Ronson, Bella Thorne, Lil Wayne, Usher, Chelsea Handler, Miley Cyrus and Miguel. ==Lowell Farms== === Origin === The company claims the farm was originally established in 1909 by William \"Bull\" Lowell and was closed by Henry J. Finger in California in 1913. However, a 2018 profile in The New Yorker makes it clear that Lowell is a fictional character and that the company was actually established in 2017, \"shortly after Proposition 64 reversed California\u2019s marijuana prohibition.\" ===Cannabis cultivation=== Lowell uses only organic fertilizer and all-natural materials during the farming process. Green Entrepreneur ranked Lowell on its 2019 \"Top 100 Cannabis Companies\" list under the flower category. ==Operations== === Expansion === Lowell Herb Co. debuted a \"weed bouquet\" in February 2017 as a Valentine's Day offering, which was available for delivery in the Los Angeles area. The company expanded the offering after its initial popularity. The bouquet is made with an ounce of Purple Princess accented with wildflowers and eucalyptus. In June 2018, Lowell began hiring pardoned non- violent, marijuana-related offenders for package design, sales, marketing, distribution, shipping and customer service positions. The company asserted that many job applicants in the United States are removed from consideration for having misdemeanor or felony cannabis offenses. After the city of West Hollywood approved lounges and eateries for cannabis consumption, the company announced that a rooftop restaurant known as Lowell Farms: A Cannabis Cafe would open in 2019. The cafe opened on October 1, 2019, becoming the first business to secure a fully legal cannabis consumption license in the United States. ===Partnerships=== In 2019, Lowell collaborated with CJ Wallace, the son of rapper The Notorious B.I.G., and Think BIG to release The Frank White Creative Blend. The pre-roll pack was inspired by Biggie's \"Frank White\" alter-ego and uses a custom blend of Orange Sherbet, Banjo and Rattlesnake Sour Diesel. == Products == In March 2017, the company released a weed flower crown aimed at Coachella participants. The crown featured Lowell's \"Coachella Blend\" cannabis and is available only to customers preordering the \"Coachella pack\" through Palm Springs Safe Access dispensary. After receiving a cease- and-desist letter from AEG Presents, the parent company of the music festival, concerning use of the name Coachella, Lowell changed the name of its Coachella products to \"NotChilla\". Lowell introduced a \"cannabis bouquet\" including eucalyptus and stemmed cannabis as well as an Eight Nights of Chanukah pack of different cannabis strains per night during the winter of 2018. ==References== Category:1909 establishments in California Category:American companies established in 1909 Category:Cannabis companies of the United States Category:Cannabis in California Category:Companies based in California ",
