Another Reserve grade title followed in 1978, but it would be almost another decade before the club experienced finals success.Drysdale p.131. The formation of an Under 19 team in 1987 was a particularly important moment in the club's history.

Many of the same players also played in the BHS First XV, also coached by Len, reaching the quarter-finals of the Waratah Shield.Drysdale p.132.
