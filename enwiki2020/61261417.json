Jackman was also active in the National Union of Teachers, in which he worked closely with Thomas Macnamara. He served on its executive from 1893, and was the union's president in 1900, and again in 1910. He joined the Labour Party, and after he retired, he won a seat in Hackney South at the 1928 London County Council election, serving until 1934.
