    "text": "In algebraic number theory, the prime ideal theorem is the number field generalization of the prime number theorem. It provides an asymptotic formula for counting the number of prime ideals of a number field K, with norm at most X. ==Example== What to expect can be seen already for the Gaussian integers. There for any prime number p of the form 4n + 1, p factors as a product of two Gaussian primes of norm p. Primes of the form 4n + 3 remain prime, giving a Gaussian prime of norm p2. Therefore, we should estimate :2r(X)+r^\\prime(\\sqrt{X}) where r counts primes in the arithmetic progression 4n + 1, and r\u2032 in the arithmetic progression 4n + 3. By the quantitative form of Dirichlet's theorem on primes, each of r(Y) and r\u2032(Y) is asymptotically :\\frac{Y}{2\\log Y}. Therefore, the 2r(X) term predominates, and is asymptotically :\\frac{X}{\\log X}. ==General number fields== This general pattern holds for number fields in general, so that the prime ideal theorem is dominated by the ideals of norm a prime number. As Edmund Landau proved in , for norm at most X the same asymptotic formula :\\frac{X}{\\log X} always holds. Heuristically this is because the logarithmic derivative of the Dedekind zeta- function of K always has a simple pole with residue \u22121 at s = 1. As with the Prime Number Theorem, a more precise estimate may be given in terms of the logarithmic integral function. The number of prime ideals of norm \u2264 X is : \\mathrm{Li}(X) + O_K(X \\exp(-c_K \\sqrt{\\log(X)}) , \\, where cK is a constant depending on K. ==See also== * Abstract analytic number theory ==References== * * * Category:Theorems in analytic number theory Category:Theorems in algebraic number theory ",
