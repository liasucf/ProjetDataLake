    "text": "John Kenneth Ousterhout (, born October 15, 1954) is a professor of computer science at Stanford University. He founded Electric Cloud with John Graham- Cumming. Ousterhout was a professor of computer science at University of California, Berkeley where he created the Tcl scripting language and the Tk platform-independent widget toolkit, and proposed the idea of coscheduling. Ousterhout led the research group that designed the experimental Sprite operating system and the first log-structured file system. Ousterhout also led the team that developed the Magic VLSI computer-aided design (CAD) program. He received his Bachelor's degree in Physics from Yale University in 1975, and his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1980. Ousterhout received the Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1987 for his work on CAD systems for very-large-scale integrated circuits.Grace Murray Hopper Award citation , retrieved 2010-04-21. For the same work, he was inducted in 1994 as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.ACM Fellow citation, retrieved 2010-04-21. Ousterhout is a member of the National Academy of Engineering. In 1994, Ousterhout left Berkeley to join Sun Microsystems Laboratories, which hired a team to join him in Tcl development. After several years at Sun, he left and co-founded Scriptics, Inc. (later renamed Ajuba Solutions) in January 1998 to provide professional Tcl development tools. Most of the Tcl team followed him from Sun. Ajuba was purchased by Interwoven in October 2000. He joined the faculty of Stanford University in 2008. ==Selected works== * ==See also== * Ousterhout's dichotomy * Raft (computer science) ==References== ==External links== * John's recounting of Tcl's early days * Ousterhout's web page at Stanford University Category:Computer programmers Category:Stanford University School of Engineering faculty Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery Category:Carnegie Mellon University alumni Category:Grace Murray Hopper Award laureates Category:Yale University alumni Category:Living people Category:1954 births Category:Programming language designers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:American computer scientists Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering Category:Sun Microsystems people ",
