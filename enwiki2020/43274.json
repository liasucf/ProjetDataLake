    "text": "Knight Rider is an American action crime drama television series created and produced by Glen A. Larson. The series was originally broadcast on NBC from 1982 to 1986. The show stars David Hasselhoff as Michael Knight, a high-tech, modern crime fighter assisted by KITT, an advanced, artificially intelligent, self-aware, and nearly indestructible car. This was the last series Larson devised at Universal Television before he moved to 20th Century Fox Television. ==Plot== Self-made billionaire Wilton Knight rescues police Detective Lieutenant Michael Arthur Long after a near fatal shot to the face, giving him a new identity (by plastic surgery) and a new name: Michael Knight. Wilton selects Michael to be the primary field agent in the pilot program of his public justice organization, the Foundation for Law and Government (FLAG). The other half of this pilot program is the Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT), a heavily modified, technologically advanced Pontiac Firebird Trans Am with numerous features, including an extremely durable shell and frame, controlled by a computer with talking artificial intelligence. Michael and KITT are brought in during situations where \"direct action might provide the only feasible solution\". Heading FLAG is Devon Miles, who provides Michael with directives and guidance. Dr. Bonnie Barstow is the chief engineer in charge of KITT's care, as well as technical assistant to Devon (April Curtis fills this role in Season 2). ==Cast and characters== * David Hasselhoff as Michael Knight (born Michael Arthur Long), an undercover detective of Los Angeles Police Department who, while on a case in Las Vegas, is shot in the face and nearly killed. Wilton Knight, creator of Knight Industries and founder of FLAG, directs his doctors to save Long's life and reconstruct his face. With his new identity, \"Michael Knight\", Long is provided with high tech crime-fighting equipment, most notably the car named KITT. Hasselhoff also played Garthe Knight, Wilton Knight's estranged son and a criminal mastermind who drives Goliath, a semi tractor trailer Peterbilt 352 Pacemaker truck armed with rockets and protected by KITT's molecular bonded shell after the formula was stolen by Elizabeth Knight, Wilton's widow. * William Daniels as the voice of KITT, or Knight Industries Two Thousand, the autonomous, artificially intelligent car, with whom Michael Knight is partnered. Daniels, who simultaneously starred on St. Elsewhere, requested not to be credited for his role as KITT's voice. * Edward Mulhare as Devon Miles, the leader of FLAG, who appeared in every episode to provide mission details to Knight and KITT. He was also the spokesman for FLAG whenever it came under scrutiny. * Patricia McPherson as Dr. Bonnie Barstow (Seasons 1, 3-4), KITT's chief technician and romantic tension for Michael. The character was dropped after the first season, but due to strong fan reaction and lobbying by Hasselhoff and Mulhare, she was returned for the third season and remained through the end of the series. * Rebecca Holden as April Curtis (Season 2), chief technician for KITT. The character was written out when Patricia McPherson returned. The connection between the two was never established in any installments. * Peter Parros as Reginald Cornelius III aka RC3 (Season 4), driver of the FLAG mobile unit and occasional sideman for Michael and KITT. * Richard Basehart as Wilton Knight, the founder of FLAG, who dies in the pilot episode. Basehart's voice, however, is heard throughout the series, narrating over the intro and outro. ==Production== ===Vehicle=== The car used as KITT in the series was a customized 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am sports model, that cost US$100,000 to buildBrowning, Norma Lee. \"Riding High with Knight Rider\", Toys R Us magazine; Vol. 1, No. 2; 1986; p. 5 (equivalent to about $266,000 in 2018).

Larson.\"Knight Rider Theme\" sheet music at musicnotes.com The series DVD bonus material contains an interview about this lead music, where Glen A. Larson says he remembers a theme out of a classical piece (\"Marche Et Cort\u00e8ge De Bacchus\" Act III - No. 14 from Sylvia written by French composer L\u00e9o Delibes) from which he took pieces for the \"Knight Rider Theme\". The rest of the series music was composed by Stu Phillips for 13 episodes and Don Peake for 75 episodes. Glen A. Larson co- wrote music for one episode and Morton Stevens wrote the music for one episode. Peake took over scoring duties at S1E14 in 1983, when Larson moved to Twentieth Century-Fox and Phillips was working there on his projects.\"Revving It Up\", liner notes, Knight Rider: The Stu Phillips Scores, FSM Vol. 8, No. 10. Peake remained as the series sole composer until the end of the series in 1986, with the exception of \"K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R.\" in third season, which he composed together with Stu Phillips and Glen A. Larson. In 2005 FSM released a disc of music from the series, featuring the series theme, ad bumpers and Phillips' scores for \"Knight of the Phoenix\" (the pilot), \"Not a Drop to Drink\", \"Trust Doesn't Rust\", \"Forget Me Not\" and the composer's final episode \"Inside Out\", as well as the logo music for Glen Larson Productions. Albums of Don Peake's scores have also been issued. ==Episodes== The intro throughout most of the episodes began with this narration: During the first season, the outro was Michael and KITT driving though a road in the desert with Wilton Knight's words of \"One man can make a difference, Michael.\" Then the narration goes on to say: The outro of Seasons 2 and 3 was Michael and KITT driving away from the sunset toward the camera. Season 4's outro was the same, except with KITT in Super Pursuit Mode. ==Syndication and home media== ===In syndication=== Knight Rider was first syndicated in the U.S. in the Fall of 1986.

This novel also states that April is Devon's daughter, but this was never used in the series and is not considered canon. An annual was published each year in the UK by Grandreams. These books consisted of a mix of text stories and cartoon strips, as well as photos and articles on the show's stars and KITT. There were five annuals produced in total, each reflecting the season of the show that was airing at the time, with the final two releases covering the final season. (The last annual was printed in a quite small quantity, due to the fading popularity of the show, and is thus considerably rarer.) ==External links== * * * * includes episode guide, and David Hasselhoff biography * \"Knight Rider\" page on NBC Classics Category:1980s American science fiction television series Category:1982 American television series debuts Category:1986 American television series endings Category:American action television series Category:American crime television series Category:Television series about robots Category:English- language television shows Category:Knight Rider television series Category:NBC original programming Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television series created by Glen A.
