He has doctoral degrees in dentistry, theology, and biology. The author of Evolutionary Creation and of I Love Jesus and I Accept Evolution, he has also written (along with Phillip E. Johnson) Darwinism Defeated? The Johnson-Lamoureux Debate on Biological Origins, on the creation\u2013evolution controversy (Regent College, 1999). Lamoureux, an evangelical Christian and a former Young-Earth creationist, calls himself an evolutionary creationist, and lectures and writes widely on the topic. Lamoureux has been involved in several public debates with prominent creationists and atheists.\"What Should Christians Believe? Genesis & Evolution: A Theological Perspective\" Hugh Owen (Koble Center for the Study of Creation), Kenneth Keathley (Southeastern Baptism Theological Seminary), and D Lamoureux. Samford University & Diocese of Birmingham. Birmingham, AL. 7 Mar 2017.\"What\u2019s Behind It All God, Science and the Universe\" Participants: Lawrence Krauss, Stephen Meyer, and D Lamoureux.

Jul 2002. He has also been involved in a televised debate moderated by Steve Paikin of TV Ontario. In an important new contribution, Evolution: Scripture and Nature say YesLamoureux, D. (2016). Evolution: Scripture and Nature Say Yes. (Zondervan). Lamoureux has argued for a return to what he calls the original meaning of Intelligent Design, which he defines as \"the belief that beauty, complexity and functionality in nature point toward an Intelligent Designer.\" Lamoureux argues that Intelligent Design should properly be understood as a religious (metaphysical) belief, not a scientific one. Therefore, he denies the claim by proponents of \"Intelligent Design Theory\" such as Michael Behe that it is scientifically testable as a process distinct from evolution. Instead, Intelligent Design should be understood as fully consistent with the evolution of life by mutation and natural selection operating through natural processes, because these processes are ultimately controlled by God. ==Publications== * (pdf) * == References == == External links == * Denis Lamoureux at St. Joseph's College, University of Alberta * Lecture on \"Beyond the Evolution vs. Creation Debate\" Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian evangelicals Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Theistic evolutionists Category:University of Alberta faculty ",
