    "text": "Crawford Hall is the basketball and volleyball practice facility for UC Irvine Athletics . Crawford Court located in Crawford Hall is a 1,400-seat arena that houses the UC Irvine intercollegiate athletics offices, men's basketball, women's basketball, men's volleyball and women's volleyball teams practice facilities. The Crawford Hall Complex, in addition to housing the athletic administration offices and practice facilities, also includes sports medicine, strength and conditioning, and student-athlete academic support services. The complex includes Microsemi Field (formerly Crawford Field), a set of practice fields for the UC Irvine Anteaters soccer teams. The facility's outdoor breezeway is also informally recognized within the UC Irvine community as the rehearsal space for hip hop dance team Kaba Modern. Crawford Hall is one of nine original buildings designed by William Pereira that were present when the campus opened in 1965. Cased in cylindrical concrete panels and perched atop a small hill, it has a castle-like presence when viewed from the road. It is attached to a smaller administrative building by an arched, covered walkway which spans a landscaped courtyard between the two. Originally named Campus Hall, it served as a multi-purpose facility prior to construction of the first Student Center in the 1980s. The complex is used by the Los Angeles Rams during their training camps at UC Irvine. ==See also== *Bren Events Center == References == ==External links== * Crawford Court * Microsemi Field Category:University of California, Irvine main campus buildings and structures Category:UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball Category:UC Irvine Anteaters women's basketball Category:UC Irvine Anteaters men's volleyball Category:Sports venues completed in 1965 Category:Sports venues in Irvine, California Category:College basketball venues in the United States Category:College basketball practice facilities in the United States Category:Basketball venues in California Category:Volleyball venues in California Category:Indoor arenas in California Category:William Pereira buildings Category:College volleyball venues in the United States Category:University and college administration buildings in the United States Category:Brutalist architecture in California Category:Futurist architecture Category:Modernist architecture in California Category:1960s architecture in the United States Category:1965 establishments in California Category:University and college buildings completed in 1965 ",
