The team blew through the playoffs \u2013 only dropping a single map \u2013 en route to defeating Flag Gaming in the finals and claiming the title of Overwatch Contenders China champions. A few weeks later, the team fell in a close 2\u20133 match to LGD Gaming in the semifinals of at NeXT 2018 Winter.
