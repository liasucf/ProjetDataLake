After assistance was given by the Thetford and Watton Railway (T&WR;), the plan was modified, and instead of running to the main station at , a curve was built so that T&WR; trains from Swaffham could run directly to the Bury St Edmunds line without reversing at Thetford. This curve was opened first, on 15 November 1875, along with Thetford Bridge station. The B&TR; line between and Thetford Bridge was opened on 1 March 1876. The B&TR; was purchased by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1878. Trains on the B&TR; were operated by the T&WR; until 1879, when operation was taken over by the GER; after this, trains from Bury began to run to Thetford; the east to south curve at Thetford Bridge was not used after 1880. Thetford Bridge was then the last station before . In September 1911 the station was used as a railhead by the British Army who were running a series of war games. In January 1923 the station was taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway. Following nationalisation in 1948 Thetford Bridge was operated by the Eastern Region of British Railways. The station closed on 8 June 1953. ==References== ==External links== *Thetford Bridge Station on navigable 1946 O.S. map Category:Disused railway stations in Norfolk Category:Former Great Eastern Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1875 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1953 Category:Thetford ",
