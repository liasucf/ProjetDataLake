An Orion VII CNG in the \"MetroExtra\" scheme in Washington DC Route S4 in Washington DC This is a list of bus routes operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), branded as Metrobus in Washington, D.C.. Many are the descendants of streetcar lines operated by the Capital Transit Company or its predecessors. ==Numbering== Most Metrobus routes in DC begin with a letter followed by a number but some routes can have a double digit numbers. There are only two routes that have double digit numbers followed by a letter (30N & 30S). Odd- numbered routes are typically part-time variants of even-numbered routes. At one time, odd numbered routes were express routes, but that distinction has been abandoned. Most odd-numbered routes operates during rush hours and or limited stops with a few of them running into the off peak hours and weekends. ==History== Many current routes operate under former streetcar routes. The streetcars provided the main transportation in the Washington, D.C. area from the 1800s to the 1960s. At Google Books. DC Transit would also operate on the former streetcar routes when the Streetcars ended service. In 1973, WMATA acquired DC Transit along with other bus companies to form its current Metrobus system. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, service has been mostly reduced to Sunday service schedules during the weekdays with select routes suspended from March 18 until August 22, 2020. Routes 30N, 30S, 54, 70, 90, A6, A8, B2, H4, S4, V4, W4, and X2 were the only routes that ran during the weekends with the rest of the routes suspended. On August 23, 2020, more routes came back during the weekdays and weekends returning Metrobus service to 75%. ==Routes== Most DC Metrobus routes operate inside the Washington DC borders. However, some routes would venture into small parts of Montgomery County and Prince George's County to connect to various stations in the Hub-and-spoke system via the old Streetcar routing. {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size: 90%;\" | !
