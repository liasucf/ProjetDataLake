His father became High King after killing the previous incumbent, Rothechtaid mac Main, in single combat at Cruachan in defence of F\u00edachu. F\u00edachu went into exile, but returned at the head of a \"black fleet\", and, with the assistance of Muinem\u00f3n, killed his father and took the throne himself. \"Flowers of wine\" (Old Irish: f\u00edn, \"wine\"; scoth, \"flower\", -ach, possessive suffix, although scoth can also mean \"blade\" and \"voice\"),Dictionary of the Irish Language, Compact Edition, Royal Irish Academy, 1990, pp. 306, 527-528; Rudolf Thurneysen, A Grammar of Old Irish, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1946, pp 220-221 which were pressed into glass vats, were said to exist during his reign.
