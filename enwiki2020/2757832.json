    "text": "A myotome is the group of muscles that a single spinal nerve innervates.Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 2012 Page 1226 Similarly a dermatome is an area of skin that a single nerve innervates. In vertebrate embryonic development, a myotome is the part of a somite that develops into the muscles. ==Structure== The anatomical term myotome which describes the muscles served by a spinal nerve root, is also used in embryology to describe that part of the somite which develops into the muscles. In anatomy the myotome is the motor equivalent of a dermatome. Myotomes are separated by myosepta.\"Medical Definition Of MYOSEPTUM\". 2018. Merriam-Webster.Com. https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/myoseptum. ==Function== Each muscle in the body is supplied by one or more levels or segments of the spinal cord and by their corresponding spinal nerves. A group of muscles innervated by the motor fibres of a single nerve root is known as a myotome.Apparelyzed: Myotomes & Dermatomes ===List of myotomes=== Myotome distributions of the upper and lower extremity are as follows; * C1/C2: neck flexion/extension * C3: Lateral Neck Flexion * C4: shoulder elevation * C5: Elbow Flexion (Bicep Curls) * C6: Wrist Extension * C7: elbow extension/wrist flexion/finger extension * C8: finger flexion * T1: finger abduction * L2: hip flexion * L3: knee extension * L4: ankle dorsi-flexion * L5: great toe extension * S1: ankle plantar-flexion/ankle eversion/hip extension * S2: knee flexion * S3\u2013S4: anal wink ==Clinical significance== In humans myotome testing can be an integral part of neurological examination as each nerve root coming from the spinal cord supplies a specific group of muscles. Testing of myotomes, in the form of isometric resisted muscle testing, provides the clinician with information about the level in the spine where a lesion may be present. During myotome testing, the clinician is looking for muscle weakness of a particular group of muscles. Results may indicate lesion to the spinal cord nerve root, or intervertebral disc herniation pressing on the spinal nerve roots. ==See also== * Dermatome (anatomy) * Somite ==References== neurology textbook, edited by Professor L.
