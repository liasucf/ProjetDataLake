From June 2013 until September 2014, he was Director of Operations at Headquarters, Air Combat Command at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia with the rank of brigadier general from August 2013. At the Air Force's annual Weapons and Tactics Conference on 10 January 2015, Post responded to a question about the future of the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. This aircraft had been developed in the 1970s specifically for close air support, and had seen extensive service in conflicts since then. In 2012, the Air Force announced plans to disband five squadrons of A-10s as a cost-saving measure. The plan ran into strong opposition in the United States Congress. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 prohibited the Air Force from spending any money retiring or planning to retire the A-10. Post recalled that in his answer he said: The use of the word \"treason\" silenced the room. Some listeners took it literally. Post's remarks were reported on the internet. On 13 January, he notified the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Mark Welsh of what he had said in an email. On 16 January 2015, the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense received an anonymous complaint alleging that Post had made remarks to the effect that communicating with Congress about the capabilities of the A-10 was treason. This was based on an item on the website dodbuzz.com. The matter was referred to the Air Force for investigation on 22 January. Meanwhile, on 21 January, the United States Secretary of the Air Force, Deborah Lee James, received a letter of complaint from Senator John McCain. Restricting communications with members of Congress is an offence under Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034, Protected communications; prohibition of retaliatory personnel actions, and Department of Defense Directive 7050.06, Military Whistleblower Protection. In his report, the Inspector General of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Gregory A. Biscone, found that while Post may not have intended to break the law, and did not actually prevent anyone from speaking to Congress, his words had a chilling effect. On 9 April 2015, the commander of the Air Combat Command, General Herbert J. Carlisle, relieved Post, and issued him a letter of reprimand. Post's final assignment was as Director of Current Operations in the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations at Headquarters U.S. Air Force, at The Pentagon. He retired in October 2016. ==Dates of rank== Post salutes during the playing of the National Anthem during the Air Combat Command change of command ceremony at Langley Air Force Base on 4 November 2014 {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white\" |- |align=\"center\" |13px |Second Lieutenant, 1 June 1983 |- |align=\"center\" |13px |First Lieutenant, 1 June 1985 |- |align=\"center\" |33px |Captain, 1 June 1987 |- |align=\"center\" |40px |Major, 1 May 1995 |- |align=\"center\" |40px |Lieutenant Colonel, 1 September 1998 |- |align=\"center\" |60px |Colonel, 1 June 2004 |- |align=\"center\" |33px |Brigadier General, 7 May 2010 |- |align=\"center\" |66px |Major General, 9 August 2013 |- |} Source: == Notes == == External links == Category:Living people Category:People from Lincoln Park, New Jersey Category:United States Air Force Academy alumni Category:Troy University alumni Category:United States Army Command and General Staff College alumni Category:American air force personnel of the Iraq War Category:United States Air Force generals Category:Recipients of the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
