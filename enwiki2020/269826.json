    "text": "James Alan Hetfield (born August 3, 1963) is an American musician and songwriter best known for being the co-founder, lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist and main songwriter for the American heavy metal band Metallica. Hetfield is mainly known for his intricate rhythm playing, but occasionally performs lead guitar duties and solos, both live and in the studio. Hetfield co-founded Metallica in October 1981 after answering an advertisement by drummer Lars Ulrich in the Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler. Metallica has won nine Grammy Awards and released ten studio albums, three live albums, four extended plays and 24 singles. In 2009, Hetfield was ranked at no. 8 in Joel McIver's book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists and no. 24 by Hit Parader on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. In Guitar World's poll, Hetfield was placed as the 19th greatest guitarist of all time, as well as being placed second (along with Metallica lead guitarist Kirk Hammett) in The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists poll of the same magazine. Rolling Stone placed Hetfield as the 87th greatest guitarist of all time. ==Early life== Hetfield was born on August 3, 1963 in Downey, California, the son of Cynthia Bassett (n\u00e9e Nourse), a light opera singer, and Virgil Lee Hetfield, a truck driver. He is of English, German, Irish, and Scottish descent. He has two older half- brothers from his mother's first marriage and one younger sister. His parents divorced in 1976 when Hetfield was 13. They were very strict Christian Scientists, and in accordance with their beliefs, they strongly disapproved of medicine or any other medical treatment and remained loyal to their faith, even as Cynthia was dying from cancer. This upbringing became the inspiration for many of Hetfield's lyrics during his career with Metallica, most notably in the songs \"Dyers Eve\" and \"The God That Failed\" from ...And Justice for All and Metallica respectively. Cynthia died of cancer in 1979 when Hetfield was 16 years old. After the death of his mother, Hetfield went to live with his older half-brother David. Virgil died in late 1996, during Metallica's Load tour.Playboy Interview . Ilikethat.com. Retrieved November 5, 2010. Hetfield attended Downey High School for his freshman and sophomore years and graduated from Brea Olinda High School in 1981. Hetfield was nine years old when he first began piano lessons, after which he took on his half-brother David's drums and finally, at the age of 14, he began to play guitar with Robert Okner. He was also in a few bands as a teenager one being Leather Charm and another, Obsession.

Retrieved November 5, 2010. and has said they were the reason he wanted to play guitar. ==Career== Hetfield performing with Metallica in 1989 In the early days of the band, Metallica experimented with a few different vocals and guitar combinations, essentially creating a setup similar to that of British metal band Diamond Head, another major influence on Hetfield. Some of the options considered included adding another guitar player, having John Roads play lead guitar, as well as asking John Bush from Armored Saint (who later joined Anthrax) to sing for the band. The finalized line-up of the band became Hetfield (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Lars Ulrich (drums), Dave Mustaine (lead guitar), and Ron McGovney (bass) who was soon replaced by Cliff Burton. Hetfield referred to their early sound as power metal. The term \"thrash metal\" was first used when Kerrang journalist Malcolm Dome described the Anthrax song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" in an issue of Kerrang in February 1984. From 1982 to 1983, Mustaine's overly aggressive behavior and drinking problems led to mounting tensions between himself and Hetfield. Mustaine also once poured beer onto McGovney's bass nearly causing serious damage. On April 1, 1983, the band recruited lead guitarist Kirk Hammett from the band Exodus, and 10 days later, Hetfield and Ulrich officially fired Mustaine from the band due to his erratic indifference.Metallica.com . Metallica.com. Retrieved November 5, 2010. Mustaine was sent home on a 4-day bus journey from New York to Los Angeles, and went on to form the heavy metal band Megadeth. Since the recording of Load, Hammett has been recording rhythm guitars as well. Hetfield occasionally plays guitar solos on songs such as \"Nothing Else Matters\", \"My Friend of Misery\", \"Just a Bullet Away\", the outro solo on \"The Outlaw Torn\", the second solo on \"To Live Is to Die\", the first solo on \"Suicide and Redemption\", the first interlude solo on \"Master of Puppets\", the harmonized solo on \"Orion\" and the introduction for \"The Day That Never Comes\". He also writes the majority of the guitar harmonies, as well as writing the lyrics, vocal melodies, and co-arranging the songs with Ulrich. Hetfield performing in Ottawa, Canada in 2004 Hetfield has been involved in a number of onstage accidents, most notable for being an incident with pyrotechnics at Olympic Stadium in Montreal during the Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour on August 8, 1992. Hetfield was the victim of a pyrotechnics accident during the song \"Fade to Black\", in which a pyrotechnic charge reacted. Hetfield's guitar protected him from the full force of the blast; however, the reaction struck his left side, burning his hand, arm, eyebrows, face and hair. He suffered second and third-degree burns, but was back on stage 17 days later, although his guitar duties were delegated to former guitar tech and Metal Church guitarist John Marshall for four weeks while he made a full recovery. Hetfield also suffered a broken arm a number of times while skateboarding, which prevented him from playing guitar on stage, and subsequently caused Hetfield's management company, Q Prime, to put a clause in Hetfield's contract, forbidding him to ride a skateboard while Metallica was touring.Music Fan Clubs Metallica \u2013 Metallica > The Band > James Hetfield. Musicfanclubs.org (August 3, 1963). Retrieved November 5, 2010. During a live performance on tour for Metallica, Hetfield experienced complications with his vocals after performing a cover of the Anti-Nowhere League song \"So What?\", forcing him to take vocal lessons for the first time. He did basic warm-up exercises to piano keys with his vocal coach, who also gave him a cassette tape of the piano warm-up for future use. Hetfield still uses the same cassette he was given in the early 1990s to this day before any live performance or any recording Metallica does.

Hetfield playing in London in 2008 During the recording of the band's eighth studio album St. Anger in 2001, Hetfield went into rehab to address his alcohol usage. He rejoined the band after seven months in rehab and four months recovering with his family. His health problems are featured in Some Kind of Monster. Some Kind of Monster also shows the making of the St. Anger album, and documents the various conflicts and issues the band were facing at the time including the departure of Jason Newsted, alcoholism, family commitments, and the future of the band. Hetfield and Metallica addressed their need for a new bassist by recruiting Robert Trujillo, who formerly served under the wing of Ozzy Osbourne. Ozzy Osbourne recruited Jason Newsted shortly after Trujillo's transfer. The new line-up has continued to make music and tour worldwide. Metallica's ninth studio album, Death Magnetic, was released on September 12, 2008. Like St. Anger and every album of original material released by Metallica since 1991's Metallica, Death Magnetic went to #1 on the Billboard charts in over 30 countries during its first week of release.Metallica \u2013 \"My Apocalypse\" Review \u2013 Music Review at IGN .

On April 4, 2009, Hetfield, along with remaining Metallica members Ulrich, Hammett, Trujillo, as well as former bassist Newsted, and the deceased Cliff Burton (who was represented by his father), were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In an interview after their nomination, Hetfield commented that everyone who had appeared on an album with the band would be inducted. This excluded original guitarist Dave Mustaine and original bassist Ron McGovney, as both had appeared only on the band's early demo tapes. Hetfield and the rest of Metallica, including Newsted, performed \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Enter Sandman\" to end the ceremony. ==Personal life== Hetfield backstage at the Big Day Out 2004 Hetfield married Francesca Tomasi on August 17, 1997, and together they have three children. He currently resides in Vail, Colorado, citing a \"multitude of reasons\" for moving there, including it being his wife's childhood hometown, the natural beauty, and the quiet environment. During an interview on NPR's Fresh Air, Hetfield stated that his wife had helped him to mature and learn to deal with his anger issues more constructively, explaining that after they met, his destructive tendencies embarrassed both of them. Hetfield has long struggled with addiction problems. In 2001, he entered a rehab program (documented in the film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster), and began maintaining total abstinence from alcohol. In a 2010 interview with So What!, the official magazine of Metallica's fan club, Hetfield stated that he is a \"reborn straight edge\".Interview with James Hetfield about his new straight edge tattoo in So What! magazine However, in 2019, Hetfield once again entered rehab, forcing Metallica to cancel their Australia/New Zealand leg of the WorldWired Tour.

British band Chumbawamba subsequently released a song called \"Torturing James Hetfield\", as a direct response. ==Equipment== ===Guitars=== Hetfield has been a major endorser of ESP Guitars since the 1980s, and is best known for playing custom-made Explorer-style guitars with an EMG 81/EMG 60 set for pickups. Hetfield's main guitar from the early days was a Flying V copy made in Japan by Electra, which was modified with a Seymour Duncan Invader (SH-8) pickup and used almost exclusively until 1984 when he switched to the Gibson Explorer model. During the mid-1990s, ESP produced the first of his signature model guitars. To date, Hetfield has had six signature guitars with the company. However, Hetfield often uses guitars from Gibson and other companies instead of ESP despite his endorsement. Some of Hetfield's guitars over the years have included: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! class=unsortable width=10% |Date purchased ! class=unsortable width=30%% |Guitar & \"motto\" ! class=unsortable width=60% |Note |- | Unknown | Gibson SG Standard (1969 model) | Hetfield purchased the guitar from a mutual member of the schools jazz band. |- | 1980 | Electra Flying V | Purchased for $200 in 1980 and used on Kill 'Em All.

For the first two albums, he used Marshall heads and cabinets, with occasional effects. The specific Marshall that he used for Kill 'Em All was stolen after a concert prior to the recording of Ride the Lightning; Hetfield was extremely upset by the theft, as his mother had helped him purchase the amplifier before her death. In 1985, for the recording of Master of Puppets, he and Kirk Hammett each bought a Mesa/Boogie Mark IIC+ amplifier (the preamp sections of which were connected to Marshall power amplifiers), and since then he has mostly used Mesa/Boogies, including the Triaxis and Rectifier models. Around the time of St. Anger, Hetfield began using the Diezel VH4 head. The majority of his clean tones come from a Roland JC-120 Jazz Chorus Guitar Amplifier, although many different amplifiers have been used over the years. In December 2011, it was announced by Fortin Amps that they would team up with Randall Amplifiers to start a new line of tube amplifiers based on the Fortin Meathead amplifier. Kirk Hammett currently has two prototypes, and Hetfield will eventually be receiving one. The amplifiers currently used on tour by Hetfield are: * Mesa/Boogie TriAxis preamp (x4) * Mesa/Boogie Simul-Class 2:90 power amp (x2) * Mesa/Boogie Triple Rectifier heads * Diezel VH4 heads * Mesa/Boogie 4x12 cabinets with Celestion V30 speakers in isolation cabinets * Roland JC-120 combo amplifiers ===Effects=== To avoid problems with pedals being damaged during live performances, Hetfield keeps his effect pedals in a rack along with his amplifiers and his guitar technician controls them through a pedalboard sidestage. The pedal controller allows him to change between different effect pedals and amplifiers. Hetfield's live rig in 2008 included: * TC Electronic G-Major * Line 6 DM4 * Mesa/Boogie Custom Graphic EQ * MXR Phase 100 * ATI NanoAmp SUM 100 * Klon Centaur * Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor * Voodoo Lab Ground Control Pro * Voodoo Lab GCX Audio Switcher (x2) * Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus * DBX 1074 Quad Gate * Behringer Multigate Pro In 2010, a Line 6 effects unit was added to the list, along with the TC Electronic unit, perhaps indicating that this had replaced his stompboxes. ===Accessories=== * Ernie Ball Power Slinky strings (.11\u2013.48) * Dunlop James Hetfield Black Fang 1.14 mm picks * 3\" Levy's Straps * Peterson Strobe 420 Tuner * EMG JH Het Set * Shure UR-4D Wireless Equipment * Furman AR Pro Power Conditioner In addition, Hetfield uses Shure Super 55 microphones for vocals. ==Discography== ===Metallica=== ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Film |- !
