The 12.6 kilometre route is operated by Z and D1 class trams from Malvern depot.Facts & figures Yarra TramsRoute 5 Yarra Trams ==History== Route 5 was allocated to the line between Malvern (Burke Road) and City (Swanston Street) on 21 November 1929, the same day that numbers were allocated to the rest of the Swanston St trams. Trams traditionally terminated at the Victoria St terminus, but following an accident in 1991, trams instead terminated at the Queensberry St crossover. Due to congestion during peak hours at the crossover, some trams continued north to Melbourne University. Finally on 17 January 1996, a permanent shunt was built at Melbourne University. From then on, Route 5 trams were altered run full-time to Melbourne University. The origins of route 5 lie in separate tram lines. The section of track between Queensberry Street (Stop 4) and St Kilda Road (Stop 30) is the oldest section of this route, dating back to the Brighton Road cable tram which opened on 11 October 1888 by the Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company. This cable tram line was electrified in stages by the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB). The section between Domain Interchange (Stop 20) and St Kilda Junction (Stop 30) was electrified on 27 December 1925. The section between Queensberry Street and City Road (near Stop 14) was electrified on the same day. The line between City Road and Domain Interchange was electrified on 24 January 1926. The section between St Kilda Junction and Chapel Street (Stop 32) also dates back to the cable era, as the Windsor to St Kilda Esplanade cable tramway which opened on 17 October 1891. This section was one the first cable tram to be converted to electric traction on 27 December 1925. The line east of Hawthorn Road (Stop 45) until the Malvern (Burke Road) terminus was one of the original lines constructed by the Prahran & Malvern Tramways Trust (PMTT), which opened on 30 May 1910. The PMTT also built the section between the Sandringham railway line (near Stop 33) and Wattletree Road (Stop 40), opening on 16 December 1911. This line was extended to Chapel Street (Stop 32) on 31 March 1912. On 24 June 1928, the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) constructed a small section of track between Wattletree Road and Glenferrie Road, giving a more direct route from Burke Road to St Kilda Junction.Between the Wars Yarra Trams As part of the St Kilda Junction separation works, the Wellington Street section was abandoned for a new section of track along the newly created Queens Way on 4 November 1968.Our Golden Years Yarra Trams During the 2006 Commonwealth Games, the route was merged with route 55 to West Coburg at Domain Interchange, to alleviate congestion along St Kilda Road.Changes to your tram service during the Commonwealth Games - March 2006 Yarra TramsHistory of Melbourne Trams Routes from 1950 to 2009 Yarra Trams {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Melbourne tram route 5 evolution !
