Those who do not receive the sacred thread (Shudras and women) cannot study the Vedas. The Neo-vedantists, who strove to present Hinduism as a \"homogenized ideal of Hinduism\" and the Arya-samajists rejected this contention. In the context of Hindu philosophy, this term occurs very significantly in the Second \u015bloka (verse) of Sri Shankara\u2019s Vivekachudamani which \u015bloka reads as follows:- :\u091c\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0942\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0928\u0930\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e \u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092d\u092e\u0924\u0903 \u092a\u0941\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u094b \u0935\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0926\u093f\u0915-\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u092a\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u092e\u094d | :\u0906\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u091a\u0928\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0928\u0941\u092d\u0935\u094b \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0903 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0928\u094b \u0936\u0924\u0915\u094b\u091f\u093f\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0938\u0941 \u0915\u0943\u0924\u0948\u0903 \u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f\u0948\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e \u0932\u092d\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 || :\"For all things subject to birth, birth in a human body is rare; even rarer to obtain are strength of body and mind; rarer still is purity; more difficult than these is the desire to live a spiritual life; rarest of all is to have an understanding of the scriptures, - as for discrimination between the Self and the not-self, direct Self-realization, continuous union with the Absolute, final and complete liberation are not to be obtained without meritorious deeds done in hundred billion well lived lives.\" The purport of this statement is that all three twice-born castes are qualified to study the Vedas but attaining the status of viprata - that of being a Br\u0101hmana, is very rare. Whereas a Kshatriya engages himself mostly in ruling over his kingdom and a Vaishya, in trade etc; the person of a Br\u0101hmana, because it is not intended for enjoying sense-pleasures, must be subjected to strict disciplines in preparation of enjoying eternal joy in store after death, the ultimate vai\u015bnavam padam which is the dharma only of Br\u0101hma\u0146as. Through a Sanskrit inscription, written in late Brahmi script, found on the Talagunda Stone-pillar in Shimoga district dated 455-470 A.D; it became known that a Kadamba king named \u015a\u0101ntivarman had saved the Brahmanahood in the Kaliyuga. In his commentary on the Aitareya Upanishad (Sloka III.ii.3), Shankara states that the Atman is expanded only in human beings who are therefore endowed with intelligence; who see what is known, give expression to what is known and know what is to come; they know the visible and the invisible and perceive the immortal through the mortal. Thus, according to Shankara, the individual self is conscious living entity that makes the individual body eligible for action and knowledge. Accordingly, the term Viprata, here, refers to the inwardly inspired or awakened body and mind; it does not refer to persons born in the families of Brahmins as has been erroneously interpreted by the orthodox interpreters. \u015ar\u012b Candra\u015bekhara Bh\u0101rat\u012b of \u015aringeri in his commentary explains that the phrase - \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0926\u093f\u0915-\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u092a\u0930\u0924\u093e in the afore-cited verse refers to him who is inclined to the path of dharma prescribed in the Vedas; and he alone who is an \u0101stika, the one who believes in the existence of the atman apart from the body, is qualified to study the Ved\u0101nta \u015a\u0101stra. And, this means that mere viprata (birth as a brahmin) by itself will not help to attain what is to be attained, and vide Jaimini Dharma, which is super-sensuous and the very foundation of universe, is what is commanded by the Vedas. The phrase \u0906\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u091a\u0928\u0902 refers to the discrimination between the Atman and whatever is not the Atman, that is, to the Anatman, which reflection produces firm conviction of the truth of the \u015brutis supported by reasoning. Dig Dar\u015bani of San\u0101tana Gosvami tells us that Viprata i.e. the status of the twice-born, can be gained by being properly initiated.
