Its name was changed to H. J. Bing & S\u00f8n when he became a partner in 1833. He continued the firm in a partnership with his four years younger brother Jacob Herman Bing after his father's retirement in 1838. He opened a combined art and gallantry shop at the corner of Kronprinsensgade in 1848. It was recognized as the most elegant shop in Copenhagen and was even prior to its official opening visited by Christian VIII. It was one of the first shops in the city with street-level shop windows. Det Bingske Etablissement as it was now called was also publishing its own books. The previously founded lithographic workshop Bing & Ferslews lith. Etablissement was expanded with a book printing and stereotype business. This firm was in 1857 taken over by Jean Christian Ferslew and H. J. Bing & s\u00f8n was in 1863 ceded to Bing's son Jacob Martin Bing and son-in-law Benny Henriques.

The Bing were interested but wanted to start a proper porcelain factory with a wider range of products. The first buildings were completed at Vesterbrogade the following year. The factory was from the beginning faced with considerably adversity and Bing was ready to close it when Gr\u00f8ndahl died in 1856 but his brother convinced him to continue the operations. ==Other activities== Bing was from 1858 to 1877 a member of Copenhagen City Council.
