    "text": "The Battle of Anyi (\u5b89\u9091\u4e4b\u6230) was a battle fought between the Kingdom of Han and the Kingdom of Wei during the Chu-Han Contention. It suppressed Wei Bao's rebellion and paved the way for the invasion of the Kingdom of Dai, and ultimately, the Battle of Jingxing. == Prelude == After the disastrous Battle of Pengcheng in the eighth month of 205, many vassal Kings lost confidence in the Han and either sued for peace or defected to Chu. One of these disloyal Kings was Wei Bao, the King of Wei. On the pretext of visiting an ill relative, Wei left Liu Bang and returned to his own lands, where he defected to Chu. Liu Bang first sent his advisor Li Yiji to persuade Wei to surrender, but was unsuccessful. Seeing no other option, Liu then sent General Han Xin to suppress Wei Bao's rebellion. == Battle == Wei Bao encamped his army at Puban, blocking the road to Linjin. Han Xin knew Wei Bao wanted him to attack Linjin and feigned an assault there, while secretly sending the majority of his army to attack Anyi (Now Xia County, Shanxi). In the ninth month of 205, Wei Bao personally led an attack on Han Xin, but was far inferior to Han's leadership abilities and lost the battle. He was captured in the melee and brought before Liu Bang. == Aftermath == Wei surrendered to Liu Bang, and was not reinstated as King of Wei, but was made a general. Later in the month, Han Xin used his free access through the Kingdom of Wei to attack the Kingdom of Dai, and decisively defeated forces led by Chancellor of Dai Xia Shuo. == References == * Sima Qian, Records of the Grand Historian * Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian * Ban Gu, Book of Han Category:Battles of the Chu\u2013Han Contention Category:205 BC ",
