    "text": "The Man Machine Poem Tour was a concert tour by The Tragically Hip in support of their thirteenth full-length studio album Man Machine Poem. The tour consisted of 15 shows, the first held on July 22, 2016, in Victoria, British Columbia, and the last held on August 20, 2016, at the Rogers K-Rock Centre in Kingston, Ontario. The tour was announced on May 25, 2016, following an announcement the previous day regarding singer Gord Downie's brain cancer diagnosis. A portion of the proceeds of the tour were donated to the Sunnybrook Foundation, the independent fundraising arm of the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre; in addition to the ticket sale proceeds themselves, both Sunnybrook and the Canadian Cancer Society reported a significant increase in direct donations, totalling over one million dollars, from the public during the tour.\"Tragically Hip tour raises more than $1M for Canadian brain cancer research\". Toronto Star, September 19, 2016. CBC broadcast the tour's final concert in Kingston on its radio, television, and digital platforms, which was seen by 11.7 million viewers across all platforms, and a DVD and Blu-ray of the concert was released in December 2017.\"The Tragically Hip's Final Concert and Tour Doc Set for Home Release\". Exclaim!, November 10, 2017. Although generally reported by the media as such, at the time the band refrained from officially labeling the concerts as their farewell tour, and instead communicated the hope that Downie's health would remain stable enough for them to tour again in the future.\"What happens next\". The Globe and Mail, January 5, 2017. However, Downie died of the illness on October 17, 2017. In July 2018, guitarist Rob Baker declared that the Tragically Hip were now inactive and the members had no plans to perform under the name again without Downie. ==Cultural analysis== Throughout the summer, the nature of the tour resulted in a considerable volume of analysis of the band, the tour and its impact on Canadian culture appearing in the media.\"How the Tragically Hip was always ahead by a century\". Toronto Star, August 7, 2016. This included a number of international outlets which had never before devoted significant coverage to the band, including CNN,\"Tragically Hip lead singer Gord Downie says goodbye in his hometown\".

Canadian media outlets which would ordinarily only publish reviews of local concerts published an ongoing series of reviews of every stop on the tour, including unusually thorough analysis of the setlists. The newsmagazine Maclean's published interviews throughout the summer with other musicians and cultural figures who had been friends, fans, collaborators or tourmates of the band, including Jim Cuddy of Blue Rodeo,\"On the Tragically Hip, Blue Rodeo and a shared legacy\".

Maclean's, July 15, 2016.\"Town of Bobcaygeon reflects on The Tragically Hip\". Toronto Star, August 17, 2016. ==Ticket sales controversy== Due to the news of Downie's cancer diagnosis, demand for tickets was higher than for any of the band's concert tours since the 1990s.\"Definitely not hip\". The Globe and Mail, January 5, 2017. However, many fans ended up stymied by ticket scalpers; even in the advance presale to members of the band's fan club, all available tickets were sold out within minutes, and many tickets almost immediately began showing up on resale sites such as StubHub, at inflated prices of up to $5,000 for the Kingston show, and up to $1,300 for most other shows.\"Tragically Hip scalpers: Getting ahead by a tragedy\". Toronto Sun, May 30, 2016.

Toronto Star, June 3, 2016. and two scalpers were arrested in Winnipeg.\"2 Tragically Hip ticket scalpers arrested in police sting ahead of Winnipeg show\". CBC News, August 4, 2016. The public outcry led CBC Television to explore options for broadcast of the Kingston show, and also resulted in a record number of booking requests for the Practically Hip, a long-running Tragically Hip tribute band, to play private Tragically Hip tribute parties across Canada.\"Practically Hip set to honour Gord Downie, bring hits to Lighthouse Theatre\". Norfolk News, March 1, 2017. Jesse Modz, a DJ for CHTZ-FM in St. Catharines, Ontario, aired a segment on his radio show in which he fooled a scalper in Mississauga into driving to St. Catharines by offering a $300 premium on top of the asking price; when the scalper arrived, Modz did not purchase the tickets, but rather confronted him about the ethics of scalping.\"Radio DJ Lures Scalper With Tragically Hip Tickets Prank\". ET Canada, June 3, 2016. Canadian music journalist Alan Cross called the situation \"the most cold-blooded, market-driven display of capitalism that we've ever seen involving Canadian concerts.\" In October 2016, Live Nation Entertainment formally admitted for the first time that at least two-thirds of all tickets for the tour were snapped up by ticket brokers, leaving less than one-third of the tickets available to be purchased at face value by fans.\"'There's a big problem': Two-thirds of Tragically Hip tickets weren't sold directly to fans\".

The Globe and Mail, August 2016. CBC broke away from its second-last night of primetime coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics to air the concert;\"Love-in for the Hip at Rio\u2019s Canada House\".

The concert was attended by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau upon request by the band. At least 11.7 million watched part of the concert across these platforms; 4.3 million were watching the television broadcast, while precise breakdowns of radio listeners, online streaming viewers or attendees at public screening parties have not been released. Public viewing was also set up in Kingston at the Springer Market Square and attended by approximately 22,000 people. Many other towns and cities across Canada also hosted public broadcasts of the concert. One particularly noted example was in Bobcaygeon, which held a public viewing on its main street;\"Bobcaygeon belts out its Tragically Hip moment\". Maclean's, August 21, 2016. in addition to local residents, the event was also attended by a significant number of people who had made a \"pilgrimage\" to view the concert there because of the song. On the same night as the Kingston concert, American rock band Pearl Jam were performing in Chicago; lead singer Eddie Vedder paid tribute to Downie and dedicated a performance of \"Light Years\" to Downie and the Tragically Hip.\"Pearl Jam salute the Tragically Hip's Gord Downie during Chicago concert\". Entertainment Weekly, August 21, 2016. Canadian band Blue Rodeo were also performing a previously scheduled concert in Toronto on the same night; during that show, they performed a rendition of \"Bobcaygeon\" as video screens around the venue displayed scenes from the concurrent Hip concert in Kingston.\"Blue Rodeo drummer talks new album, Tragically Hip tribute\". Penticton Western News, January 17, 2017.

Typically the band played 20 or 21 songs followed by a three-song encore and then an additional two-song encore. For the final show, the band played 21 songs and then returned to play three encores of three songs. At virtually all shows, all songs from the same album were performed consecutively in sets of two, three or four, with that album not subsequently returned to for the rest of the show. Only a few times over the course of the tour was this pattern deviated from at all, normally for just one song. The only unplayed album on the tour was their debut EP The Tragically Hip. ==References== Category:2016 concert tours Category:2016 in Canadian music Category:Farewell concert tours Category:The Tragically Hip concert tours Category:2016 controversies Category:Concert tours of Canada ",
