The museum showcases the art of Andrew Wyeth, a major American realist painter, and his family: his father N.C. Wyeth, illustrator of many children\u2019s classics, and his son Jamie Wyeth, a contemporary American realist painter.Smithsonian.com The museum is housed in a converted nineteenth century mill with a dramatic steel and glass addition overlooking the banks of the Brandywine River (also known as Brandywine Creek). The museum's permanent collection features American illustration, still life works, and landscape painting by Jasper Francis Cropsey, Harvey Dunn, Peter Hurd, Maxfield Parrish, Howard Pyle, William Trost Richards, and Jessie Willcox Smith. The glass-wall lobby overlooks the river and rolling countryside that inspired the Brandywine School earlier in the early 20th century. The museum also owns and operates tours of three nearby National Historic Landmarks: the N. C. Wyeth House and Studio,N. C. Wyeth House and Studio the Kuerner Farm,Kuerner Farm inspiration for nearly 1,000 works of art by Andrew Wyeth for more than 70 years, and the Andrew Wyeth Studio,Andrew Wyeth Studio where the artist painted from 1940 until just before his death.
