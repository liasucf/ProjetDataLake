After independently building a following through the release of two critically acclaimed EPs, Praise Break (2014) and Pilgrim's Paradise (2015), Caesar released his debut album Freudian in August 2017, which garnered widespread critical acclaim. == Early life == Ashton D. Simmonds was born on April 5, 1995, in Scarborough, Toronto, and raised in Oshawa, Ontario. He is the second eldest of four children to his mother Hollace and father Norwill Simmonds, a pastor and gospel singer who released his first album as a high school student in Jamaica. Caesar attended the Seventh-day Adventist Church and private school in Oshawa. He is of Bajan and Jamaican descent. Caesar grew up in church, singing before his father's congregation in Oshawa. He was raised listening to soul and gospel delivered though musicality and religion, even though his parents were cautious of temptations that came with music. Caesar longed for the city, which was an hour\u2019s drive from his home. At the age of 17, Caesar was kicked out of the house after a fight with his father on the weekend of his high school graduation. He felt no choice but to pursue his calling as a musician. After leaving his home, he began doing gigs. The turning point of Caesar's career came in 2015, with the release of his second EP, Pilgrim's Paradise. ==Career== In 2014, Caesar received widespread critical acclaim for his debut EP Praise Break, which was ranked No. 19 on the \"20 Best R&B; Albums of 2014\" by Rolling Stone. His music is influenced by religion, which played a large role in his upbringing, as well as unrequited love. On August 25, 2017, Caesar released his debut album Freudian, which includes the singles \"Get You\", \"We Find Love\", and \"Blessed\". The album was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.\"Polaris Music Prize Reveals 2018 Short List\". Exclaim!, July 17, 2018. At the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, Caesar received two nominations for Best R&B; Album and Best R&B; Performance for \"Get You\". At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, Caesar won Best R&B; Performance for his single \"Best Part\". ==Artistry== Caesar's music is influenced by soul and gospel. His music draws from his childhood experiences and integrates them with R&B; and electronics, while his lyrics explore subjects of religion and unrequited love. His singing voice reshapes itself on each track, often veering into a hushed, introspective lilting style. According to Caesar, \"In my religious surroundings growing up, the point is to be still, to direct as little attention to yourself as possible and instead, direct all attention to what you\u2019re saying. Now, it\u2019s kind of the opposite.\" Caesar cites Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Beyonc\u00e9, and The Doors frontman Jim Morrison as musical and aesthetic inspirations. ==Controversy== On March 19, 2019, Caesar posted a video, in which he repeatedly confesses to be drunk, to defend his friend Julieanna Goddard (YesJulz) via an Instagram live stream. Goddard had been called a \"culture vulture\" and accused of having little to no regard for African Americans, particularly black women. According to her critics, Goddard had been specifically called out for a freestyle that implied black people take and do not give back and murder other black people. Caesar came to her defense, asking why some black people were \"being so mean\" specifically to Goddard, saying it was not \"a quality\". His comments were received negatively by some on social media, while Goddard claimed the lyrics were about corporations. His video stemmed from an interaction with Dave Chappelle on John Mayer's Instagram live stream where Caesar thought he was being too sensitive when Chappelle called his singing \"very gay\". He then extrapolated that all black people, specifically call out culture, were overly sensitive. Caesar then apologized for the way he gave his opinions, saying: \"I was talking down to you guys. I apologize for how I expressed my idea, [t]here was no one there to challenge my ideas. That\u2019s also dangerous. That\u2019s why it\u2019s tyrannical... that is where I went wrong. I believe in what I said. A real man can admit when he\u2019s wrong. I can admit when I\u2019m wrong.\" In April 2018, Caesar retweeted and deleted tweets from conservative Candace Owens. He noted that he did not want to \"martyr\" for the tweets and that people should hear opposing arguments. He later backtracked his comments. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of albums, with selected chart positions and sales figures !
