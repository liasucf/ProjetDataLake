Founded in 1891 during the Qing Dynasty, it is the oldest school in Xinjiang.\u8ba4\u8bc6\u65b0\u7586 - \u4e4c\u9c81\u6728\u9f50\u5e02\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2d\u5b66, Retrieved on December 6, 2008 Located in the downtown Bei Men () at Jiankang Road () and North Jiefang Road () in Tianshan District, Urumqi, the school is the accredited top-ranking high school in Urumqi city and in Xinjiang, and is considered a typical instance of local secondary education.\u4e4c\u9c81\u6728\u9f50\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2d\u5b66-\u8d70\u8fd1\u540d\u6821-\u4e2d\u56fd\u767e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u5b66\u7f51 , Retrieved on June 29, 2009 All of the courses are in Chinese. The students are predominantly Han Chinese, with other ethnic groups including Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongol, etc. Starting from August, 2017, the school begin using the new campus located in the Xi'er Street(\u897f\u4e8c\u5df7) of Kanasihubei Road(\u5580\u7eb3\u65af\u6e56\u5317\u8def). With an investment of more than 551 million yuan, the new campus covers an area of 14.5547 hectares and contains two Teaching Buildings, two Science Buildings(with three floors of Library), one Office Building, one Art Building, one Astronomy-Music Integrated Building, one Stadium, three Dormitory Buildings, one Standard Soccer Field, and one Dining Hall Building. ==History== The institutional predecessor, known as Bo Da Academy of Sinkiang ()(lit. Sinkiang Academy of Erudition), was founded on August 14, 1891 by the then Qing Dynasty, when it was 20 years before the establishment of the Republic of China.Symbolic front gate, exposed to North Jiefang Road (\u89e3\u653e\u5317\u8def) side, Urumqi In the early ROC period, many well- educated Chinese intellectuals and political figures, converged on the school to pursue their studies in Xinjiang. The former school president Yu Xiusong () (in office in 1936), came around and taught in the school as the then leader of the CPC Shanghai Leading Group and one of the founding members of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC). In 1938, Li Yunyang (), one of the CPC members dispatched by the Central Politburo, became president of the school. Other major figures, such as the revolutionary martyr Lin Jilu, along with Shen Yanbing (writer), Zhao Dan (artist), have lectured in the school. These people who had intensive revolutionary backgrounds affected the students deeply in their minds, bringing in Marxist ideology. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, some of them also contrived to enlighten the students and the young generation and propagandized ideological guidance in an effort to help the country. Their efforts contributed to the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang and created a hopeful atmosphere among the youths. By 1953, the State Education Commission labelled the school as the sole key middle school in Xinjiang. However, the Cultural Revolution inflicted heavy losses upon it; almost all stored books in its library totaling approximately 40,000 were rifled during that time. With the resumption of the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE, or CEE) in the late 1970s right after the Cultural Revolution, the school had been achieving progressive success in CEE results of the students. In 1982, it was labelled once more in the first list of the country's best-run key schools. Since 1995, the school has permanently ranked at the top places by CEE evaluation. Through the public assessment, it was chosen as a city-level unit of spiritual civilization in the year 1995, and sequentially as the autonomous region-level one in the end of the same year. Over the nearest past four years, the school's rate of matriculation (ROM) to college reached over 99% steadily. The high school consolidated its top rank in Xinjiang high schools exposed by the CEE result. thumb|198x198px| The New Campus In 2004, a civil North School of the No. 1 Senior High School of Urumqi () was founded by the school authorities and their collaborative company known as Xinjiang Jun Fa Industrial & Investment Co.

The act is believed to reduce the labor intensity of students, whose de facto sanitary work is thus limited within the classrooms. School cleaners are responsible for the whole school except internal classrooms (public classrooms and auditoria excluded).211x211px ==School administration== The administrative group () of the No. 1 Senior High School of Urumqi is divided into General Office (), Pedagogy Office (), Teaching and Research Office (), Student Office (), General Affairs Office () and Financial Office ().

The top students who passed its self-standardized difficult natural-science-oriented tests (including Chinese, mathematics, English, physics and Chemistry) will form several Natural-Scientific Strong- point Classes (\u7406\u79d1\u7279\u957f\u73ed).Students in normal classes will also have the chance to enter Natural-Scientific Strong-point Classes if they get good grades in Chinese, Mathematics, English, Physics and Chemistry in the first or the second monthly exams of the first term in Senior Grade 1. At the end of Senior Grade 1, students who choose Social Sciences will have social-science-oriented tests (including Politics, History and Geography). The top students will form the Social-Scientific Strong-point Classes (\u6587\u79d1\u7279\u957f\u73ed).Students who choose Social Sciences do not have to do Physics and Chemistry homework in the summer holiday between Senior Grade 1 and 2. However, the students who are in Natural-Scientific Strong-point Classes of Senior Grade 1 but want to choose Social Sciences have to leave their former classes. Other students who are not adept at studies but have conspicuous abilities in athletics, basketball or fine arts can be also admissible if they pass the selective tests. Statistics indicates that the school ranked 6th in 2006,1999-2006\u4e2d\u56fd\u5404\u7701\u5e02\u57f9\u517b\u9ad8\u8003\u72b6\u5143\u6700\u591a\u7684\u4e2d\u5b66, Retrieved on June 29, 2009 and 2nd in 2008 on a nationwide ranking list by number of the number-one scholars () graduates in the College Entrance Examination (CEE) every year.

Morning Gathering (\u6668\u4f1a) is a plenary assembly held at 9:00 a.m. every Monday (during school terms) on the playground, lasting for near 20 minutes. The weekly on- duty class hosts the gathering, responsible for a flag-raising ceremony, a speech to the flag (\u56fd\u65d7\u732e\u8bcd), sometimes a summary of the school's performance in terms of discipline for the past one week (\u4e0a\u5468\u503c\u5468\u603b\u7ed3), and more optional procedures, such as lectures by teachers on certain topics. * Sports Day (\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f1a) is held every year, lasting for two or three days in late September or early October, including mostly track and field events. All students of three grades are bound to participate in the events. The 2005 Games were cancelled due to the 50th Anniversary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The 2017 Games were also cancelled. *Basketball Games are held annually in March and April, involving only Senior 1 and Senior 2 team members, since the Senior 3 students are busy with academic preparations for the CEE. * Military training is an indispensable yearly drill for the newly recruited new grade (senior) 1 students, taking place in August before their first term in a local military base (barracks) or at school. All the students are required to live in the military base or at school during the military training. * Poem recitation contest * Callisthenic exercises contest (\u5e7f\u64ad\u64cd\u6bd4\u8d5b) * Joint performance on New Year's Day (\u5143\u65e6\u6c47\u6f14) * Growing-up ceremony (\u6210\u4eba\u4eea\u5f0f) ==Student organizations== * Student Union (\u5b66\u751f\u4f1a), made up of students, is responsible for school affairs and activities. It is established through the yearly Student Congress (\u5b66\u751f\u4ee3\u8868\u5927\u4f1a), and consists of Life Department, Study Department and Propaganda Department. *Student's Union (December 2011-December 2012) ** President of Student's Union: Zhang Rongrong (\u5f20\u5bb9\u6995), vice president of Student's Union: Yin Ruizhe (\u5c39\u9510\u54f2) and Jiang Bowen (\u59dc\u535a\u6587). * CYLC committee (\u56e2\u59d4), made up of teachers and students, is established annually via CYLC Member Congress (\u56e2\u5458\u4ee3\u8868\u5927\u4f1a). * CYLC branches (\u56e2\u652f\u90e8) are set in every class pertinent to the League members (mostly the students).
