    "text": "Luise F. Pusch (born in G\u00fctersloh, Germany) is a German linguist. She is regarded as the co-founder of feminist linguistics in Germany, along with . == Life and education == Luise Pusch studied English, Latin and linguistics at the University of Hamburg. In 1972 she received her doctorate in English. In 1978, she qualified for the linguistics faculty at the University of Konstanz. From 1979 to 1984 she was a Heisenberg Fellow in the field of feminist linguistic research. Before feminist linguistics became her specialty, she worked on syntactic issues such as construction of gerunds. From 1982 to 1985 she held professorships in English and German in Leibniz University Hannover and in the University of Duisburg-Essen. In 1985, she was named adjunct professor at the University of Konstanz. In 1990-1991, she was professor for women's studies at the University of M\u00fcnster. Since 1986, Pusch has been partnered with U.S. Germanist Joey Horsley from Boston, and splits her time between there and Hannover. == Career == In the mid-1970s, U.S. feminists such as Robin Lakoff and others had begun to pay attention to the gender discrimination inherent in the language itself, and the way it was used. Feminist linguistics didn't originally develop out of the academic linguistic discipline, but from theoreticians within oppressed groups. From those beginnings, it was brought into the field of linguistics by two professors of linguistics, and Pusch who started the program of Feminist linguistics at the University of Konstanz. The first essays to appear in Germany about the topic were in 1979 in the journal Osnabr\u00fccker Beitr\u00e4ge zur Sprachtheorie, and in 1980 in Linguistische Berichte. Since the 1970s Pusch has been committed to a gender-appropriate language, for example in essays, commentary, discussions, lectures and workshops. In her 1980 essay, \"German as Men's Language: Diagnosis and Therapy Ideas\" (Das Deutsche als M\u00e4nnersprache. Diagnose und Therapievorschl\u00e4ge) , she wrote that standard German has a built-in bias favoring males, that this is problematic, and that the simplest solution to the problem lies in partial de-genderization of the language. To that end, the feminine suffixes -in and -innen could be done away with; female professors would become, simply, \"Professor\" (instead of Professorin) or \"Schriftsteller\" (writer) instead of Schriftstellerin. Due to the expected non-acceptance of such a proposal, she pleaded for the stepped up use of Binnen-I (e.g., Sch\u00fclerIn (schoolchild) ) in order to avoid use of the paired-word form, Sch\u00fclerinnen und Sch\u00fcler (schoolgirls and schoolboys). Besides her linguistic work, she built a biographical database containing the biographies of 30,000 women. In 1981 she wrote the autobiographical novel Sonja: eine Melancholie f\u00fcr Fortgeschrittene (\u2033Sonja: Melancholia for Intermediates\u2033) about her suicidal partner under the pseudonym Judith Offenbach. == Awards == The association ', a network of women in the book industry, chose Luise F. Pusch as \"BookWoman of the Year\" 2004. On her 70th Birthday, Pusch was honored with the commemorative Sprachwandlerin award.
