It shows the French explorer and adventurer Eug\u00e8ne Pertuiset, who in 1873 discovered the northern part of Tierra del Fuego in Patagonia whilst searching for Inca remains, an aim he was distracted from by discovering gold. He unsuccessfully petitioned the French authorities to buy land in Tierra del Fuego and on Dawson Island. ==References== Pertuiset Pertuiset Category:1881 paintings Category:Paintings of the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art Category:Hunting in art Category:Lions in art ",
