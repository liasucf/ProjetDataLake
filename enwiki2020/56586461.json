    "text": "{| |} The Type 726 LCAC (with NATO reporting name Yuyi class) is a class of air-cushioned landing craft used by the People's Liberation Army Navy. Six Yuyi-class LCACs are believed to be in service with the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), with the first one (3320) being seen at the end of 2007. It is thought that the vessels were delivered in two batches, with the first three LCACs reportedly powered by Ukrainian UGT 6000 engines, while the remaining three are believed to use the indigenous QC-70 gas turbines. Up to four Yuyi- class LCACs can be carried in the well deck of the 210 m-long Yuzhao-class landing platform dock (LPD). The Type 726 LCAC is greater in size than the US LCACs in service, but smaller than the Zubr-class LCAC and can carry only one Type 96 main battle tank or four armored vehicles. With one main battle tank and 60 to 70 troopers on board of each LCAC, one LPD is able to send 4 main battle tanks and 300 troopers, i.e. 1 battalion, in one operation. The early variant, the Type 726, have encountered a number of technical problems that temporarily halted production of the class. This forced the four Type 071 LPDs to limit their projection capabilities to landing craft, amphibious IFVs and helicopters exclusively (not main battle tanks). However, recent commercial satellite imagery of China\u2019s Jiangnan Shipyard near Shanghai shows that the country is producing additional Yuyi-class LCACs. Five Type 726As that appeared to be nearly completed could be seen at the yard on 24 November. ==Operators== ; * People's Liberation Army Navy (6 units) ==See also== * Landing Craft Air Cushion * Engin de d\u00e9barquement amphibie rapide * Lebed- class LCAC * LSF-II 631 * Tsaplya-class LCAC \u2013 Three in service with ROKN * Zubr-class LCAC ==References== Category:Amphibious warfare vessels of the People's Liberation Army Navy Category:Military hovercraft Category:Landing craft ",
