    "text": "In mathematics, Stickelberger's theorem is a result of algebraic number theory, which gives some information about the Galois module structure of class groups of cyclotomic fields. A special case was first proven by Ernst Kummer (1847) while the general result is due to Ludwig Stickelberger (1890). ==The Stickelberger element and the Stickelberger ideal== Let denote the th cyclotomic field, i.e. the extension of the rational numbers obtained by adjoining the th roots of unity to (where is an integer). It is a Galois extension of with Galois group isomorphic to the multiplicative group of integers modulo . The Stickelberger element (of level or of ) is an element in the group ring and the Stickelberger ideal (of level or of ) is an ideal in the group ring . They are defined as follows. Let denote a primitive th root of unity. The isomorphism from to is given by sending to defined by the relation :\\sigma_a(\\zeta_m) = \\zeta_m^a. The Stickelberger element of level is defined as :\\theta(K_m)=\\frac{1}{m}\\underset{(a,m)=1}{\\sum_{a=1}^m}a\\cdot\\sigma_a^{-1}\\in\\Q[G_m]. The Stickelberger ideal of level , denoted , is the set of integral multiples of which have integral coefficients, i.e. :I(K_m)=\\theta(K_m)\\Z[G_m]\\cap\\Z[G_m]. More generally, if be any Abelian number field whose Galois group over is denoted , then the Stickelberger element of and the Stickelberger ideal of can be defined. By the Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem there is an integer such that is contained in . Fix the least such (this is the (finite part of the) conductor of over ). There is a natural group homomorphism given by restriction, i.e. if , its image in is its restriction to denoted . The Stickelberger element of is then defined as :\\theta(F)=\\frac{1}{m}\\underset{(a,m)=1}{\\sum_{a=1}^m}a\\cdot\\mathrm{res}_m\\sigma_a^{-1}\\in\\Q[G_F]. The Stickelberger ideal of , denoted , is defined as in the case of , i.e. :I(F)=\\theta(F)\\Z[G_F]\\cap\\Z[G_F]. In the special case where , the Stickelberger ideal is generated by as varies over . This not true for general F., Lemma 6.9 and the comments following it ===Examples=== If is a totally real field of conductor , then :\\theta(F)=\\frac{\\varphi(m)}{2[F:\\Q]}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in G_F}\\sigma, where is the Euler totient function and is the degree of over \u211a. ==Statement of the theorem== > Stickelberger's Theorem > Let be an abelian number field. Then, the Stickelberger ideal of > annihilates the class group of . Note that itself need not be an annihilator, but any multiple of it in is. Explicitly, the theorem is saying that if is such that :\\alpha\\theta(F)=\\sum_{\\sigma\\in G_F}a_\\sigma\\sigma\\in\\Z[G_F] and if is any fractional ideal of , then :\\prod_{\\sigma\\in G_F}\\sigma\\left(J^{a_\\sigma}\\right) is a principal ideal. == See also == *Gross\u2013Koblitz formula *Herbrand\u2013Ribet theorem *Thaine's theorem == Notes == == References == * *Boas Erez, Darstellungen von Gruppen in der Algebraischen Zahlentheorie: eine Einf\u00fchrung * * * * * == External links == *PlanetMath page Category:Cyclotomic fields Category:Theorems in algebraic number theory ",
