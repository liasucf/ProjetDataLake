    "text": "Peepoodo & the Super Fuck Friends is a French adult animated series created by Balak and co-written by Brice Chevillard, Nicolas Athan\u00e9 and Balak. The project of this series is to make a program of sex education for those over age 18. It was released on July 16, 2018 on Blackpills' site. Peepoodo is the second series produced by the animation studio Bobbypills. After a campaign of crowdfunding on Kickstarter, a second season began production. == Premise == Peepoodo & the Super Fuck Friends explores \"sexuality without taboos and in all its forms, including dicks and nipples.\" It also focuses on an unrestrained sexuality that ignores prejudices and tolerance. At the end of the first season, Peepoodo destroys the earth, and in the second season he, accompanied by Dr. Pussycat, Evelyne and Tuffalo will aboard a spaceship, looking for a planet to settle on, finding the hostility in space. It will be a sci-fi adventure which can be described as \"Star Trek with sex, full of plot twists and strong messages, dealing with the issues of today\" and a variation of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and Doctor Who with sexual themes. == Characters == * Peepoodo (voiced by Brigitte Lecordier in French and Barbara Weber-Scaff in English), a little pink hamster, who only wears a sweater and has phimosis . Titular character of the series. * Dr. Monique Pussycat/Dr. Lachatte (voiced by Jeanne Chartier in French and Barbara Weber-Scaff in English), an anthropomorphic cat who works as a doctor and a nurse at her clinic. Up until Kevin transitions into Evelyn she is the only primary character who is fully clothed and supplies the educational information in each episode. * Tuffalo (voiced by Brice Chevillard in French and Douglas Rand in English), a buffalo with muscles, a micropenis, and wears a tank top. * Kevin/Evelyn (voiced by Balak in French and David Gasman in English), a polar bear who is being nice and friendly. She is a trans woman, who presents as male until the episode \"Dr. Peepoodo\", where Dr. Pussycat discusses with her about being trans off-screen, and then she reveals her true self. From that point onward, she is respected by her friends and wears clothing consisting of denim shorts, a green halter top over a black bikini, black bracelets, a black collar and a silver loop earring on her right ear. * Lilifan/Lily (voiced by L\u00e9a Tcherniatinsky in French and Christine Ryndak in English), an elephant who is shy and nervous but her vagina is hapless. She died in the episode \"Apocalypse: Part 2\". ==Production== Balak, otherwise known as Yves Bezherel, talked about adult animation, with their projects not allowed on French television, stated that he was given the green light to begin the show by Blackpills. He also argued that the show was meant to \"show the middle finger\" to those years when they worked on \"children's cartoons at someone\u2019s direction,\" and said he, and his crew, were glad to tell stories, study emotions and topics \"that no one usually touches.\" Additionally, he said the motive of the show is be positive, fun, but consider \"serious issues,\" while being educational. At the same time, he stated that he learned a lot for learning about the project, calling it comedic and having funny jokes that \"come from the darkest and most shocking places,\" noting that a children's visual style was chosen to the lack of funds to \"make a high-quality animation project.\" He further stated that while the show is popular online, but they could not \"find a single platform where we would accept it\" due to detailed sex scenes, as it was taken down from YouTube, and was left on the Blackpills website, with no plans to put it on Netflix. The official site for the show confirmed what Balak stated, stating that although the first season came out in 2018, getting 7 million views on YouTube, they lost their broadcaster, were banned from YouTube, and not even Japanese broadcasters would accept their show, leading them to turn to crowdfunding as their only option, saying they could then \"produce a new season and release it for free on the internet.\" They also note that crowdfunding will fund a season 2 which will be 5-10 episodes long, but it will provide English translation and subtitles for season 2, along with possible English and Japanese dubbing for the same season, along with subtitles in \"Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, [and] Japanese.\" For the English dub for the show, Jacqui Chappell and Nina Nevers work on script adaption, Sim\u00f3n Hanukai is the voice and scripting director, Anais Khout mixes content, and \"comedians\" Barbara Weber-Scaff, Sharon Mann, Christine Ryndak, Douglas Rand, David Gasman, Yves Bigerel, Brice Chevillard voice characters. == Episodes == == See also == * History of French animation * History of animation == References == ==External links== * *Official Peepedo Episodes on official website *Bonus content of Peepedo on official website * * Page on Bobbypills website * News about show on Bobbypills website Category:French adult animated comedy television series Category:Adult animated web series Category:Adult comedy web series Category:2010s French animated television series Category:LGBT characters in animated series Category:LGBT-related animated web series Category:Transgender-related television shows Category:LGBT-related animated series Category:Anime- influenced Western animated television series Category:Parody television series ",
