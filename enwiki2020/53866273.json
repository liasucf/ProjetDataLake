    "text": "This question has been written about by philosophers since at least the ancient Parmenides (c. 515 BC) The question \"Why is there anything at all?\", or, \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\" has been raised or commented on by philosophers including Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,\"Principles of Nature and Grace\", 1714, Article 7. Ludwig Wittgenstein,\"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.\" Logico-Philosophicus 6.44 and Martin Heidegger \u2013 who called it the fundamental question of metaphysics.Martin Heidegger, Introduction to Metaphysics, Yale University Press, New Haven and London (1959), pp. 7\u20138. ==Overview== The question is posed comprehensively, rather than concerning the existence of anything specific such as the universe or multiverse, the Big Bang, mathematical laws, physical laws, time, consciousness, or God. It can be seen as an open metaphysical question. Monad or The Absolute. ==On causation== The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that everything must have a cause, culminating in an ultimate uncaused cause. (See Four causes) David Hume argued that, while we expect everything to have a cause because of our experience of the necessity of causes, a cause may not be necessary in the case of the formation of the universe, which is outside our experience. Bertrand Russell took a \"brute fact\" position when he said \"I should say that the universe is just there, and that's all.\" Philosopher Brian Leftow has argued that the question cannot have a causal explanation (as any cause must itself have a cause) or a contingent explanation (as the factors giving the contingency must pre-exist), and that if there is an answer it must be something that exists necessarily (i.e., something that just exists, rather than is caused).Brian Leftow \u2013 Closer To Truth ==Explanations== Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz wrote: Philosopher of physics Dean Rickles has argued that numbers and mathematics (or their underlying laws) may necessarily exist.Dean Rickles \u2013 Closer To TruthMichael Kuhn (to Christopher Ishaam) \u2013 Closer To Truth Physicist Max Tegmark wrote about the Mathematical universe hypothesis, which states that all mathematical structures exist physically, and the physical universe is one of these structures. According to the hypothesis, the universe appears fine-tuned for intelligent life because of the anthropic principle, with most universes being devoid of life. Max Tegmark - The Mathematical Universe ==Criticism of the question== Philosopher Stephen Law has said the question may not need answering, as it is attempting to answer a question that is outside a spatio- temporal setting, from within a spatio-temporal setting. He compares the question to asking \"what is north of the North Pole?\"Stephen Law \u2013 Closer To Truth Noted philosophical wit Sidney Morgenbesser answered the question with an apothegm: \"If there were nothing you'd still be complaining!\",There are two errors in the title of this book: A sourcebook of philosophical puzzles, paradoxes and problems, Robert M. Martin, p. 4, or \"Even if there was nothing, you still wouldn't be satisfied!\"Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story, Jim Holt, p. 17, Liveright, 2013, ===Physics is not enough=== Physicists such as Stephen Hawking and Lawrence Krauss have offered explanations that rely on quantum mechanics, saying that in a quantum vacuum state particles will spontaneously come into existence. Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek is credited with the aphorism that \"nothing is unstable.\" However, this answer has not satisfied physicist Sean Carroll, who argues that Wilczek's aphorism accounts merely for the existence of matter, but not the existence of quantum states, space-time or the universe as a whole. ===God is not enough=== Philosopher Roy Sorensen writes in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that to many philosophers the question is intrinsically impossible to answer, like squaring a circle, and even God does not sufficiently answer it: ===Argument that \"nothing\" is impossible=== The pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides was one of the first Western thinkers to question the possibility of nothing. Many other thinkers, such as Bede Rundle, have questioned whether nothing is an ontological possibility.Why Does Anything Exist? Nothing might be a human concept that is only a construct and inappropriate for a description of a possible state, or absence of state. The contemporary philosopher Roy Sorenson has dismissed this line of reasoning. Curiosity, he argues, is possible \"even when the proposition is known to be a necessary truth.\" For instance, a \"reductio ad absurdum proof that 1 \u2212 1/3 + 1/5 \u2212 1/7 + \u2026 converges to \u03c0/4\" demonstrates that not converging to \u03c0/4 is impossible. However, it provides no insight into why not converging to \u03c0/4 is impossible. Similarly, even if \"nothing\" is impossible, asking why that is the case is a legitimate question. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Why Anything at All?, Closer to Truth Category:Causality Category:Concepts in metaphilosophy Category:Concepts in metaphysics Category:Concepts in the philosophy of mind Category:Concepts in the philosophy of science * Category:Emergence Category:Existentialism Category:Existentialist concepts Category:History of ideas Category:History of philosophy Category:History of science Category:Metaphilosophy Category:Metaphysical theories Category:Metaphysics Category:Ontology Category:Philosophical concepts Category:Philosophical problems Category:Philosophical theories Category:Philosophy of science ",
