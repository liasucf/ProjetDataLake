Hamada would give up 5 walks, 8 hits and 7 earned runs in his 4 innings pitched. Hamada would fail to make any further appearances with the first team in the 2016 season and as such had his contract downgraded to a trainee status for the upcoming 2017 season. On 24 April 2017, Hamada underwent surgery for ulnar nerve paulsy in his left elbow and although was unable to pitch that year, was re-signed at the end of the season. On 27 June 2018, he returned to the mound in the first time in two years against the Orix Buffaloes in the Western League, but it was later discovered Hamada has a blood circulation defect in his left arm where he underwent surgery once again. ====2019==== Hamada pitched in 17 games on the farm for an 8.77 ERA but was given a full- time roster deal ahead of the 2020 season, being assigned the #69 jersey. ==References== ==External links== * * NPB.com Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Aichi Prefecture Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers Category:Chunichi Dragons players ",
