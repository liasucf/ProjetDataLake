As a member of the Fujiwara clan, Nobuyori might have been in line to become regent, and he desired power, which he obtained for a short while following the Rebellion. Fujiwara no Nobuyori was known for being a male attendant for sexual purposes of Emperor Go-Shirakawa, who later placed him on a high government post. In the late 1150s, a dispute arose between the followers of the reigning Emperor Nij\u014d and those who favored the retired (cloistered) Emperor Go-Shirakawa. Though Fujiwara no Michinori and the Taira clan supported Nij\u014d, Nobuyori and his Minamoto allies supported Go-Shirakawa's bid to retain some influence and power. When Taira no Kiyomori, head of his clan, left Kyoto for a time in 1159, it seemed the perfect opportunity for Nobuyori and the Minamoto to make a move; though some say Kiyomori left the city intentionally, luring his enemies into a trap. Nobuyori and the Minamoto attacked the Sanj\u014d Palace, abducting the former Emperor Go-Shirakawa, killing much of his staff, and setting the building aflame. They brought him to the Great Palace, where Emperor Nij\u014d was being held hostage as well. They then moved on to the home of chief-councillor Fujiwara no Michinori, killing everyone there; Michinori escaped, only to be captured and decapitated soon afterwards. Nobuyori then had Nij\u014d appoint him Chancellor, under duress. Though he still had enemies at Court who encouraged the emperor to resist and to escape, overall Nobuyori's plan had succeeded. This did not last for long, however, since Taira no Kiyomori returned, and the Minamoto were not sufficiently prepared to defend the city against him. The emperor and ex- emperor both were freed, the Minamoto defeated, and Nobuyori killed in February 1160. Near the end of the rebellion, Fujiwara no Nobuyuri was beheaded. == References == ==Further reading== *Sansom, George (1958). A History of Japan to 1334.
