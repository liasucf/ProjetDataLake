    "text": "Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter image Mons R\u00fcmker is an isolated volcanic formation that is located in the northwest part of the Moon's near side, at selenographic coordinates 40.8\u00b0 N, 58.1\u00b0 W and is the planned landing site of the Chang'e 5 mission. The feature forms a large, elevated mound in the northern part of the Oceanus Procellarum. The mound has a diameter of 70 kilometres, and climbs to a maximum elevation of about 1,100 metres above the surrounding plain. It was named after Karl L. C. R\u00fcmker. Mons R\u00fcmker has a concentration of 30 lunar domes--rounded bulges across the top, some of which contain a small craterlet at the peak. These are wide, circular features with a gentle slope rising in elevation a few hundred meters to the midpoint. Lunar domes are similar to shield volcanoes, and are the result of lava erupting from localized vents followed by relatively slow cooling. Mons R\u00fcmker is surrounded by a scarp that separates it from the adjacent mare. The plateau rises to an altitude of 900 m in the west, 1,100 m in the south and 650 m in the east. The surface of Mons R\u00fcmker is relatively uniform, with a strong spectroscopic signature of lunar mare material. The estimated volume of lava extruded to create this feature is 1,800 km3. ==See also== * List of mountains on the Moon by height ==References== Category:Mountains on the Moon Category:Shield volcanoes Category:Lava domes Category:Extraterrestrial volcanoes ",
