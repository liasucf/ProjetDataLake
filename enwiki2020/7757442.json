    "text": "\"Sugar Baby Love\", recorded in autumn 1973 and released in January 1974, is a bubblegum pop song, and the debut single of The Rubettes. Written by Wayne Bickerton and Tony Waddington and produced by Bickerton, engineered by John Mackswith at Lansdowne Recording Studios, and with lead vocals by Paul Da Vinci, \"Sugar Baby Love\" was the band's one and only number one single in the UK Singles Chart, spending four weeks at the top of the chart in May 1974. ==Recording details== Bickerton and Waddington had been writing songs together since they were both members of the Pete Best Four in Liverpool in the early 1960s. Their biggest success had been writing \"Nothing but a Heartache\", a US hit for The Flirtations in 1968. In the early 1970s, they came up with the idea for a rock 'n' roll musical. They co-wrote and produced a demonstration recording of \"Sugar Baby Love\", recorded October 1973 with \"Tonight\", \"Juke Box Jive\" and \"Sugar Candy Kisses\" (which became a hit for Mac and Katie Kissoon). They originally intended to submit it for the Eurovision Song Contest but instead offered it to Showaddywaddy and Carl Wayne, who both turned it down. They then offered it to the demo musicians, provided that they would become an actual group. With the exception of the recording's lead singer, Paul Da Vinci, who had signed a solo recording contract with Penny Farthing Records. Surprisingly, only John Richardson, who played drums and spoke the \"please take my advice,\" would sign up and later become a member of The Rubettes.Paul Da Vinci, biography by Mark Deming, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 25 August 2014 \"Sugar Baby Love\" became a UK No. 1 hit in 1974, also reaching No. 37 and No. 30 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Cashbox charts, respectively. It also reached No. 1 in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, and No. 2 in Australia, South Africa and Italy. Bickerton said: > \"We had Paul DaVinci singing in that incredibly high falsetto voice and then > a vocal group sings 'Bop-shu-waddy' over and over for about 3 minutes. Gerry > Shury, who did the string arrangements, said, 'This is not going to work: > you can't have a vocal group singing 'Bop-shu-waddy' non stop.' A lot of > people said the same thing to us and the more determined I became to release > it. The record was dormant for 6 or 7 weeks and then we got a break on Top > of the Pops and it took off like a rocket and sold 6 million copies > worldwide. Gerry said to me, 'I'm keeping my mouth shut and will concentrate > on conducting the strings.'\"John Kutner and Spencer Leigh, 1000 UK Number > One Hits, Omnibus Press, 2005, ==Chart performance== ===Weekly singles charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1974) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |- |- | UK Singles Chart (The Official Charts Company) |align=center| 1 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
