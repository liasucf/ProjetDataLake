His video game credits include FX Fighter, Robotech: Battlecry, and the award-winning The Journeyman Project series. Yune first began in comics with the 1992 cult anthropomorphic series Buster the Amazing Bear and joined Jim Lee at Wildstorm Productions after a number of years as a video game designer. After writing and illustrating Speed Racer in 1999, he followed up with two more manga-style miniseries, Racer X and Danger Girl: Kamikaze. His original Speed Racer run was also re-released in 2000 as the graphic novel titled Born to Race.
