    "text": "The Pite\u0219ti-T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te Retreat was a fighting-withdrawal operation carried out by the Romanian 1st Army in the face of advancing Central Powers' (German and Austro-Hungarian) forces during World War I. The retreat lasted from 29 November to 3 December and culminated in a violent battle at T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, after which the entire Romanian Army started a general retreat towards Moldavia. This operation was part of the wider Battle of Bucharest, which started on 28 November 1916.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 266 ==Background== By 26 November 1916, the situation for Allied Romania was dire. The Olt and the Danube rivers had been crossedMichael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 254 and 257-258 and the Romanian defenses along the Jiu Valley (17 November) and the Olt Valley (25 November) had faltered.John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, pp. 246, 249 and 251 The first Romanian response to the debacle was a change of command. A mixed group of southern armies was created, and placed under the command of General Constantin Prezan and his talented operations officer, Captain Ion Antonescu. The two Romanian officers arrived at the 1st Army headquarters at Pite\u0219ti on the morning of 23 November. Prezan's army group consisted in all of the Romanian forces except for Alexandru Averescu's 2nd Army and Constantin Cristescu's North Army.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 253 and 264-265Spencer C. Tucker, ABC- CLIO, Oct 28, 2014, World War I: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection [5 volumes]: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection, p. 1270 Prezan was widely regarded as more of a courtier than a serious army officer. Fortunately for the Romanians, his operations officer was Captain Ion Antonescu, \"a talented if prickly individual\".Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916\u201317, p. 320 Such was the influence of Captain Antonescu that, in his memoirs, General Alexandru Averescu used the formula \"Prezan (Antonescu)\" to denote Prezan's plans and actions.Larry Watts, Eastern European Monographs, 1993, Romanian Cassandra, p. 43 Sometime before 26 November, Prezan had changed the commander of the 1st Army, replacing General with General . On the evening of 26 November, Prezan presented his plan, part of which envisioned the 1st Army forming a giant screen from east of Curtea de Arge\u0219 and along the southwest to the Olt River. The 1st Army, however, was in poor shape. As of 26 November, after months of heavy and costly fighting against the Germans and Austro- Hungarians, its forces had dwindled to 34,649 infantry soldiers in nine divisions, which in strength were actually the equivalent of little more than 3 divisions.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 265, 353 and 362 General Henri Berthelot, head of the French military mission to Romania, requested that \"in the name of the Entente\" the 1st Army \"resist on the spot\", retreating only \"step by step, destroying all means of communication possible\".Glenn E. Torrey, Center for Romanian Studies, 2001, Henri Mathias Berthelot: Soldier of France, Defender of Romania, p. 163 ==Retreat== ===Fall of Pite\u0219ti and C\u00e2mpulung (29 November)=== Given that Stratilescu's 1st Army was ordered to form its defensive screen from east of Curtea de Arge\u0219,Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 265 its units thus came into contact with Central Powers forces after 27 November, when General Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen's corps captured Curtea de Arge\u0219.John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 251 It wasn't long before the heavily outnumbered Romanians steadily retreated from Pite\u0219ti and C\u00e2mpulung, both towns being taken by the Central Powers on 29 November. The towns fell on the same day because different German-led forces took them. Pite\u0219ti was taken by Krafft von Dellmensingen's forces, while C\u00e2mpulung was taken by General Curt von Morgen's corps.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916\u201317, pp. 386-387John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 251 At Pite\u0219ti, the 1st Army made a brief stand before being driven back.Leonard Wood, Austin Melvin Knight, Frederick Palmer, Frank Herbert Simonds, Arthur Brown Ruhl, P. F. Collier & sons, 1917, The story of the great war: with complete historical record of events to date, Volume 11, p. 3299 (Note: the volumes in this series have a single continuous page count, which starts with the first page of the first volume and ends with the last page of the last volume) Krafft's Corps had five units: an Alpine Corpskl. Division, the 73rd Austro-Hungarian Division, the 2nd and 10th Austro-Hungarian Mountain Brigades, plus the 216th German Infantry Division which had arrived on 7 November.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 258 Von Morgen's I Reserve Corps initially comprised the German 89th Infantry Division and the Austro-Hungarian 71st Infantry Division,Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916\u201317, p. 353 to which the 12th Bavarian Division was later added.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 289 ===30 November\u20131 December=== On 30 November, after the 12th Bavarian Infantry Division had occupied C\u00e2mpulung on the 29th, Morgen's 8th Mountain Brigade took Mount Leaota. The closeness of the pursuit gave the Romanians no respite, and exhausted men started surrendering in growing numbers. On that day Morgen's forces took 3,000 prisoners. In the evening of 30 November, after having occupied Pite\u0219ti on the morning of the 29th, Gruppe Krafft's Alpine Corps were given a period of rest in the forest near Davide\u0219ti, in the midst of several unsuspecting Romanian regiments. At dawn, the surprised Romanians were attacked and scattered, leaving behind over 800 prisoners and 14 guns.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916\u201317, pp. 386-387 ===Battle of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te (3 December)=== Having taken 3,000 prisoners on 30 November, Morgen's corps reached T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te three days later. At T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, the Romanians mounted a determined defence against the 12th Bavarian Infantry Division and could only be driven back at bayonet point. The division's bicycle company shot an attacking Romanian cavalry regiment to pieces. At 2:30 pm on 3 December, the Bavarians took T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te by storm. Having taken Mount Leaota on 30 November, the 8th Mountain Brigade also took Pietro\u0219i\u021ba on that same day (3 December).Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916\u201317, p. 387Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 272 ==Aftermath== The Pite\u0219ti-T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te Retreat happened at the same time as the Battle of the Arge\u0219. The Romanians attacked on 1 December, pushing the 217th Division from Mih\u0103ile\u0219ti southwest towards St\u00e2lpu. However, the Central Powers counterattacked on 3 December, pushing the Romanians back and retaking Mih\u0103ile\u0219ti by 4 pm on that day. The Central Powers in the region did not advance on the next day, spending 4 December carrying out mop-up operations.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 270-272 The Romanians ultimately managed to delay the German advance long enough for the British embassy to organize the sabotage of the Romanian oil wells.Spencer Tucker, Routledge, Jan 4, 2002, The Great War, 1914-1918, p. 121 The oil installations at T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te were set ablaze on 26 and 27 November. Those at Moreni followed on the 28th, with those at Ploie\u0219ti being gutted on 5-6 December, just before the arrival of the Central Powers forces.Maurice Pearton, Clarendon Press, 1971, Oil and the Romanian state, p. 81 Erich Ludendorff made the following appraisal in his memoirs: \"The Rumanians, under English orders and directions, had effected a very thorough destruction of the oil-fields.\".Erich Ludendorff, Harper & brothers, 1919, Ludendorff's own story, Volume 1, p. 355 Following the battles of Arge\u0219 and T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, some officers of the French military mission wanted the Romanians to make a stand to the west of Bucharest and Ploie\u0219ti. However, the MCG (Marele Cartier General/Romanian General Staff) rightly argued that this would only serve to completely destroy the remaining Romanian forces. General Berthelot agreed, and - on 5 December, after further discussions which included the King of Romania - orders were given for a retreat to the northeast.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916\u201317, pp. 387-388 == References == Category:Battles of the Eastern Front (World War I) Category:Battles of World War I involving Germany Category:Battles of World War I involving Romania Category:Battles of World War I involving Austria-Hungary Category:History of Muntenia Category:Conflicts in 1916 Category:1916 in Romania ",
