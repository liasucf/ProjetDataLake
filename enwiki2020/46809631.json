    "text": "Sandra Rodr\u00edguez Nieto is a Mexican journalist who for many years was an investigative reporter for El Diario de Ju\u00e1rez. She has aggressively covered the narcotics-connected violence in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which is located across the border from El Paso, Texas, and which is one of the most violent cities in the world. She has won several international awards for her groundbreaking reporting about the narcotics trade and other subjects. She is now a reporter for Sin Embargo. ==Early life and education== Rodr\u00edguez studied communication sciences at the Autonomous University of Chihuahua in Ju\u00e1rez and holds a master's degree in journalism from the University of Texas at El Paso. ==Career== From 2003 to 2012, she worked for El Diario in the northern border city of Ju\u00e1rez, where she wrote extensively about corruption in local government, the weaknesses in the judicial system, the structure and activities of drug cartels, and the involvement of disenfranchised local youth in criminal gangs and the narcotics trade. Her analysis of murders in Ju\u00e1rez in 2008 and 2009 showed that most of the victims were young people from the poorest neighbourhoods, not drug cartel members, as Mexican officials claimed, and that 98 percent of the victims were unarmed and 97 percent of the killings unsolved. She now writes for Sin Embargo. ===Books=== She is the author of the 2012 book La F\u00e1brica del Crimen (The Crime Factory). In the book, she denounces the \u201cperverse cycle that has led to social deterioration--and the lose of entire generations of young people \u2013 in Cuidad Ju\u00e1rez.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Luis Benavides, journalism professor at California State University, Northridge, has said that \u201c[h]er book, like no other recent book written about Ju\u00e1rez, adds layers of understanding that make the reader appreciate the complexities of the problem, moving away from facile explanations and solutions advanced by government officials on both sides of the border.\u201d ==Honors and awards== In 2010, the Spanish newspaper El Mundo awarded her the Reporteros Del Mundo prize. Also in 2010, she was included on the Los Angeles Times\u2019 list of Media Heroes. In 2011, she received the Knight International Journalism Award from the International Center for Journalists and, with El Diario staff, the Maria Moors Cabot Award from Columbia University. In recognition of her coverage for the newspaper El Diario de Ju\u00e1rez, she received the 2013 Daniel Pearl Award for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting. She was a Harvard University Nieman Fellow in 2014. She was the only Latin American in that year's class of 24 reporters and editors. At Harvard she studied \u201cways to develop sustainable online investigative and narrative journalism projects with a focus on government transparency and accountability in Mexico.\u201d ==Views== In Ju\u00e1rez, she has written, \u201cmurderers can act with freedom and anonymity, enjoying the indifference and complicity of the state. Citizens, meanwhile, are left vulnerable, not knowing how to defend ourselves and from whom.\u201d She has concluded that \u201cthe supposed remedy \u2018against drugs\u2019 is at least 100 times worse than the supposed ills of consumption, with the added aggravation that forbidding the trade fuels corruption in state institutions. The resulting social deterioration in places like Ju\u00e1rez leads to extreme criminality and out-of-control carnage.\u201d ==Public appearances== She has lectured about the Mexican drug war in various venues. In November 2012, she spoke at California State University, Northridge. In February 2014 she spoke at Stony Brook University in New York. \u201cThe whole city is a battlefield,\u201d she said of Ju\u00e1rez at Stony Brook. \u201cIn 2008, [Ju\u00e1rez] became this battlefield for drug cartels who wanted to control the distribution routes of trucks. The federal government sent 8,000 troops. It was the first time I\u2019ve seen soldiers in my city.\u201d She added: \u201cMy worst nightmare is to someday wake up and see the story of my city in the New York Times. No. I\u2019m not gonna let any foreign reporter to tell the story of the city that I know because I know what is underneath the violence.\u201d ==References== Category:Mexican journalists Category:Mexican women journalists Category:Mexican drug war Category:Writers from Chihuahua Category:People from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
