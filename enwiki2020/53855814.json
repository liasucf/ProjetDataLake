The film was released on July 14, 2017, by Vertical Entertainment. ==Plot== Suzanne Dutchman (Demi Moore) seems to be a happily married wife. Her husband Mark (Dylan McDermott) is a businessman who continuously travels and is very well known. One day at a dinner party, Mark speaks to a client, Howard (James McCaffrey), about a deal whilst Suzanne speaks with her close friend Deanna (Viva Bianca). As Suzanne and Mark are on their way home it is revealed that the couple aren't so happy after all. Howard is caught by an undercover female agent for using and dealing cocaine, and reveals many issues involving Mark. Mark is then arrested, and Suzanne faces charges for supporting him in his actions. The judge feels sympathy for Suzanne, mentions that she understands that Suzanne was unaware of her husband's actions, and sentences her to 100 hours of community service only. Suzanne fulfills her court ordered community service by reading for visually- impaired/blind man Bill Oakland (Alec Baldwin), an author and English lecturer. Suzanne develops feelings for Bill and, when she finds out about her husband's affair, leans towards Bill even more. ==Cast== *Alec Baldwin as Bill Oakland *Demi Moore as Suzanne Dutchman *Viva Bianca as Deanna *Dylan McDermott as Mark Dutchman *James McCaffrey as Howard *Steven Prescod as Gavin O'Connor *Jabari Gray as Andre *Ren\u00e9e Willett as Kelly *Ski Carr as Ricky G. *Drew Moerlein as Tim Landry *Eden Epstein as Ella *John Buffalo Mailer as Jimmy *Chloe Goutal as Becca *Gerardo Rodriguez as Frank *John-Michael Lyles as Kyle *Rae Ritke as Michelle Oakland ==Production== Principal photography began in October 2015. ==Release== The film premiered at the Woodstock Film Festival on October 13, 2016.
