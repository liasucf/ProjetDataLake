    "text": "The phrase covenant of salt appears twice in the Hebrew bible: In the Book of Numbers, God's covenant with the Aaronic priesthood is said to be a covenant of salt. In the second book of Chronicles, God's covenant with the Davidic kings of Israel is also described as a covenant of salt. According to the New Oxford Annotated Bible, \"of salt\" most likely means that the covenant is \"a perpetual covenant, because of the use of salt as a preservative\". The commandments regarding grain offerings in the Book of Leviticus state \"every offering of your grain offering you shall season with salt; you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your grain offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt.\" ==See also== * Bread and salt ==References== Category:Covenants in the Hebrew Bible Category:Book of Leviticus Category:Book of Numbers Category:Books of Chronicles ",
