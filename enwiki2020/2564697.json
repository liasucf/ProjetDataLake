Commanding a Mobile Advisory Team during the Vietnam War, he was nearly fatally wounded in action and pronounced dead, in 1969. After recovering from the injuries, Smallwood moved to New York City where he studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse and established a career as a performer in Broadway productions (Mahalia), films and television. ==Career== His films include The Cotton Club (1984), Contact (1997), Deep Impact (1998), Larry David's Sour Grapes, Traffic (2000), The One (2001), Quigley (2003), Spectres (2004) and Embers (2015).

He often plays military characters, and as a science fiction fan, he always longed to play a Star Trek alien. He came close on Voyager when he played the human form of a disguised alien, but it was not until Enterprise that he played a fully alien character, a sympathetic Xindi, for several episodes.
