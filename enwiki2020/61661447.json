At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received a weighted average score of 71 based on 12 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Matt Collar of AllMusic said that the album \"Cabello feeling loved and seen by someone else\" and \"just as much about her seeing and understanding herself as an artist.\" Chris Willman of Variety opined that \"Romance is a record that \"bumps her up a level as an artist, without trying to advance her into maturity too fast. Those closing tracks do set you up, anyway, for larger leaps.\" In a mixed review, Hannah Mylrea of NME stated that the album \"shines during these more upbeat, fun moments\" but \"is less successful when Cabello tries to show the side of romance where you're falling head over heels or doubting a relationship\". Adam White of The Independent considered the album a \"marked improvement on the pick'n'mix anonymity of her 2018 debut\", adding that while not everything works on the record, \"there is an obvious through line connecting the majority of its tracks\". Neil McCormick of The Telegraph criticized the \"recycling\" of older songs and excessive use of auto-tune in the album, concluding that Romance is \"state-of-the-art pop yet it lacks the real romance of music made from the heart.\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian deemed the songwriting \"so-so\" and questioned the production including the \"distracting\" use of auto-tune \"not as a special effect but as a kind of cure- all lotion slathered over every syllable that passes Cabello's lips\". Writing for Pitchfork, Stefanie Fern\u00e1ndez said the album \"follows the same pristine pop cues\" of her debut and \"imbues them with a vision about love so universalized it blurs it out of focus\". Fern\u00e1ndez felt Romance \"succeeds in tracks that capture love's fleeting minutiae\", but the \"inconsistent\" production and \"overproduced\" songs leave \"too much space where Cabello is overshadowed.\" ==Commercial performance== Romance debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 dated December 21, 2019, with 86,000 album-equivalent units, including 54,000 pure album sales, 30,000 stream-equivalent sales (resulting from 40.6 million on demand streams), and 2,000 track-equivalent sales.
