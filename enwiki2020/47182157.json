Brown and Martha Raye (and their mouths) together in a comedy. Only it wasn't carried far enough away. $1,000 a Touchdown, played at the Criterion yesterday, is a painfully witless football farce of almost fantastic unoriginality. There is even a scene in which Eric Blore turns to Mr. Brown and says, \"Now I leave you to Morpheus.\" (That wasn't a take-em, folks: it was Joe Miller clutching Mr. Brown's shoulder). It ends with Joe E. scoring the last-second touchdown by being thrown over the goal posts. They threw the wrong man: Delmer Daves, who wrote it, would be our choice\u2014and we'd insist on a field goal.\" == References == == External links == * Category:1939 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American comedy films Category:1939 comedy films Category:American black-and-white films ",
