Krishnamoorthy graduated from the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai. Starting his profession as an artist, he got into films through G. V. Iyer. He first met Iyer in 1968 when the latter was about to make Hamsa Geethe, a Kannada film. Krishnamoorthy was immediately signed up despite having no prior experience in art direction. The film eventually released in 1975, but he remained unnoticed. However, he got an opportunity to work in plays for B. V. Karanth and Bansi Kaul. Over the next years, Kirshnamoorthy continued to mainly work for Iyer in films such as Adi Shankaracharya (1983), Madhvacharya (1986) and Ramanujacharya (1989). Although he entered Tamil cinema through Sreedhar Rajan's Kann Sivanthaal Mann Sivakkum in 1983, he did not work in Tamil films for a brief phase in his career. In 1987, he won his first National Film Award for Madhvacharya. This recognition helped him enter Malayalam cinema, through Lenin Rajendran's Swathi Thirunal (1987). Following that, he continued to work in 15 films in Malayalam including Vaisali (1988), Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha (1989), Perumthachan (1991). He won two National Film Awards for his work in Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha as an art director and costume designer. His involvement with Malayalam cinema in the late 1980s and early 1990s earned him five Kerala State Film Awards for Best Art Director. In 1991, Kirshnamoorthy made a comeback to Tamil cinema through Bharathiraja's Nadodi Thendral. This was followed by Balu Mahendra's Vanna Vanna Pookkal (1992). In the subsequent years, he would work on more Tamil films including Suhasini Maniratnam's directorial debut Indira (1996), Sangamam (1999) and Bharati (2001). Bharati fetched him two National Film Awards: Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.
