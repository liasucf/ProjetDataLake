The B-side \"Goodbye Joe\" is a cover version of a song by fellow Cherry Red Records recording artists Monochrome Set. The re-recorded version of \"Plain Sailing\" was included on the Cherry Red Pillows & Prayers compilation album. The single sleeve featured the Robert Doisneau photograph Le baiser de l'h\u00f4tel de ville (Kiss by the H\u00f4tel de Ville) and hand-lettering by Thorn herself. Thorn did not release another solo single until \"It's All True\" 25 years later.
