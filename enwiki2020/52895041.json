She died in Mexico City. == Early life == Rosa Rosenberg (maiden name Seifer) was born in Lviv, Poland to parents Ignacio Seifer and Mar\u00eda Lazchower. The Seifers moved to Mexico escaping social upheaval and unrest in Poland. Accompanied by Ignacio's mother, Ethel, and Rosa's older sister, Lea, they arrived in the port of Veracruz in November 1923, immediately after they established residence in Mexico City. In the following years, two more daughters were born to the marriage, Dora and Flora. She attended an elementary school located in the street of Correo Mayor, and middle school at Secundaria N\u00famero Dos, she later obtained a degree in Commerce and Administration, and studied English and French. In 1942 she married Moishe Rosenberg, an Ashkenazi Jewish immigrant who owned a jewelry store in the central area of Mexico City. Her first child died shortly after birth, and her second, Samuel, perished in an accident at the age of 23, she had two more children, Le\u00f3n and Florence Rosenberg. == Professional career == In 1966 Rosa won first prize in the competition \"Nuevos Valores\u201d at the Centro Deportivo Israelita. Two years later, in 1968, she was invited to participate in a large scale collective show at the Galer\u00eda Chapultepec as part of the Festival Internacional de las Artes, a cultural program of the XIX Olympic games held in Mexico City. Rosenberg opened her first solo exhibition on August 13, 1968, at the Galer\u00eda Jack Misrachi. Invitations for the show featured text praising her work by film director Alejandro Jodorowsky, this collection was positively reviewed in several newspapers, including \u00daltimas Noticias, El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico, El D\u00eda, The News, Novedades, Exc\u00e9lsior, and others. On September 29, 1970, her second solo show opened at the Mer-Kup gallery owned by art dealer Merle de Kuper. Obtaining similar critical response as the Misrachi show, her career would launch into more invitations to group exhibitions and interviews by local reporters where her work was compared to the likes of Remedios Varo, Leonora Carrington, and Salvador Dal\u00ed. Her first international appearance happened at the Mabat Galleries in Tel Aviv, where Mexican Ambassador Rosario Castellanos, spoke at the inaugural event.
