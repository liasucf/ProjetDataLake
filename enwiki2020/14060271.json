    "text": "Christian Vaupell Christian Theodor Vaupell (14 October 1821 - 15 September 1862) was a Danish botanist and forester. He was a student of Japetus Steenstrup and a teacher of botany at the University of Copenhagen to the young Eugen Warming.Prytz, S. (1984) Warming \u2013 botaniker og rejsende. Lynge, Bogan. 197 pp. Vaupell did macrofossil analysis of peat deposits and showed that in the Holocene development of temperate forest communities in Denmark, Betula was the chief early pioneer, followed by Pinus and Quercus and finally Fagus, which dominates today. These investigations pioneered the study of ecological succession.Cowles, Henry C. (1911) The causes of vegetational cycles. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 1 (1): 3-20 Besides studies of Holocene vegetation change and plant successions, Vaupell did pioneering investigations of palaeoecology as well as microscopy of plant anatomy and vegetative reproduction.Nielsen, Jan K. and Helama, Samuli (2012) Christian Theodor Vaupell, a Danish 19th century naturalist and a pioneering developer of the Quaternary geoscience.
