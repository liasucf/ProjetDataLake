    "text": "Nina Reis (born 16 February 1980) is a retired Swedish professional golfer who played on the Ladies European Tour (LET) and LPGA Tour. ==Amateur career== Reis was part of the Swedish team, together with Kristina Engstr\u00f6m, Anna Gertsson, Mikaela Parmlid, Helena Svensson and Linda Wessberg, which won the 2001 European Ladies' Team Championship at Golf de Mais, Spain. She played collegiate golf at the University of North Texas. She was a two-time all- conference selection while at North Texas in 2000 and 2001. In 2001 she led the team in stroke average and was named to the All-Sun Belt Conference team. In 2000 she was named to the first-team All-Big West squad. Reis had six top-10 finishes her freshman season and finished tied for fifth at the Big West Conference Championship. ==Professional career== Reis turned professional in 2003 and joined the LET. She then joined the LPGA Tour in 2006 after a successful LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament where she finished 16th. She recorded top-10 finishes at the 2006 State Farm Rail Classic and 2008 Corona Championship, as well as the 2006 Women's British Open. Her best LET season was 2008 when she played in 16 events and posted four top-10 finishes, including runner-up finishes at the G\u00f6teborg Masters and Open de France Dames, back to back in September. She was also fourth at SAS Ladies Masters and ninth at Nykredit Masters. She finished 22nd on the LET Money List. ===Round of 61=== Reis scored 270 (\u221218) by shooting 69-67-73-61 at the 2008 G\u00f6teborg Masters. The 11-under-par 61 tied the LET 18-hole record for all time lowest round set by Kirsty Taylor at the 2005 Wales Ladies Championship of Europe. After 17 holes, Reis was at \u221212 for the day and a score of 59 looked possible, but she bogeyed the last hole to drop back to \u221211 for the day and a total \u221218 for second place, her career best finish on the LET. Gwladys Nocera won after scoring 259 (\u221229) following rounds of 66-62-65-66, the best 72-hole score in the LET's 30-year history. {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size: 95%; text- align:center\" !align=\"left\"|Hole !style=\"width:20px\" |1 !style=\"width:20px\" |2 !style=\"width:20px\" |3 !style=\"width:20px\" |4 !style=\"width:20px\" |5 !style=\"width:20px\" |6 !style=\"width:20px\" |7 !style=\"width:20px\" |8 !style=\"width:20px\" |9 !style=\"width:25px\" |Out !style=\"width:20px\" |10 !style=\"width:20px\" |11 !style=\"width:20px\" |12 !style=\"width:20px\" |13 !style=\"width:20px\" |14 !style=\"width:20px\" |15 !style=\"width:20px\" |16 !style=\"width:20px\" |17 !style=\"width:20px\" |18 !style=\"width:25px\" |In !style=\"width:40px\" |Total |- |align=left|Meters || 340 || 125 || 425 || 265 || 350 || 130 || 485 || 320 || 140 || 2580 || 315 || 430 || 150 || 330 || 198 || 455 || 345 || 420 || 350 || 2993 || 5573 |- |align=left|Par || 4 || 3 || 5 || 4 || 4 || 3 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 35 || 4 || 5 || 3 || 4 || 3 || 5 || 4 || 5 || 4 || 37 || 72 |- |align=left rowspan=2|Score || 4 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|2 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|4 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|3 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|3 || 3 || style=\"background:red;\"|3 || 4 || 3 || 29 || style=\"background:lightblue;\"|5 || style=\"background:red;\"|3 || 3 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|3 || 3 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|4 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|3 || style=\"background:red;\"|3 || style=\"background:lightblue;\"|5 || 32 || 61 |- |E || style=\"background:Pink;\"|\u22121 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|\u22122 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|\u22123 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|\u22124 || \u22124 || style=\"background:red;\"|\u22126 || \u22126 || \u22126 || \u22126 || style=\"background:lightblue;\"|\u22125 || style=\"background:red;\"|\u22127 || \u22127 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|\u22128 || \u22128 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|\u22129 || style=\"background:Pink;\"|\u221210 || style=\"background:red;\"|\u221212 || style=\"background:lightblue;\"|\u221211 || \u221211 || \u221211 |} Source: ==Professional wins (6)== ===Swedish Golf Tour (6)=== *2002 (1) Telia Grand Opening Ladies *2003 (1) Telia Grand Opening Ladies *2005 (3) HaningeStrand Club SGT Open, Skandia PGA Open Ladies, Felix Finnish Ladies Open *2009 (1) Fredrik Jacobson Masters ==Team appearances== Amateur *European Lady Junior's Team Championship (representing Sweden): 2000 *European Ladies' Team Championship (representing Sweden): 2001 (winners) ==See also== *Ladies European Tour records ==References== ==External links== * Category:Swedish female golfers Category:North Texas Mean Green women's golfers Category:Ladies European Tour golfers Category:LPGA Tour golfers Category:People from Kung\u00e4lv Municipality Category:Sportspeople from Gothenburg Category:1980 births Category:Living people ",
