    "text": "The Bukovica massacre was a massacre of Muslims in Bukovica, Pljevlja, in the Axis-occupied Italian governorate of Montenegro. It took place February 4\u20137, 1943, during Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's Chetniks' 1943 cleansing campaign (conducted against the order of supreme Chetnik command). The massacre was aimed at establishing Chetnik control over territories held by the Sand\u017eak Muslim militia. After a short battle with the Muslim militia, Chetniks captured Bukovica and killed over five hundred civilians. == Background == === Geography and demography === Bukovica is a rural area of Pljevlja municipality located in northern Montenegro, and is part of the Sand\u017eak region. To the north lay the Bosnian municipalities of \u010cajni\u010de and Fo\u010da. Bukovica is and contains over 30 hamlets with 1 to 10 houses. Prior to the start of World War II, the population of Bukovica was predominantly Muslim, with a substantial Serb population. === Usta\u0161e Muslim militia in Sand\u017eak === At the end of April 1941 and into the beginning of May, Croatian Usta\u0161e forces captured Sand\u017eak. Political representatives of the Muslim population requested that the territory of Sand\u017eak should be annexed by the Independent State of Croatia. Thus the Sand\u017eak Muslim militia was established in all regions of Sand\u017eak, including Pljevlja. After withdrawal of the Usta\u0161e from Sand\u017eak in September 1941, the region came under control of Italian forces as part of Italian governorate of Montenegro. In April 1942, Italians established a battalion of Muslim militia in Metaljka, near \u010cajni\u010de, composed of about 500 Muslims from villages near Pljevlja and \u010cajni\u010de. Soon after, a command post of Muslim militia was established in Bukovica, near Pljevlja. It was commanded by Latif Mo\u0107evi\u0107, the president of Bukovica municipality. From the end of May 1942, his units attacked and killed local Serbs. In December 1942, around 3,000 Muslims attacked the Serbian village of Bu\u0111evo and several surrounding villages near Sjenica, burning down Serb houses and murdering Serb citizens. According to Chetnik sources, Muslims were preparing to expel Serbs who lived on the right bank of Lim, Pljevlja, \u010cajni\u010de, and Fo\u010da. === Order of Dra\u017ea Mihajlovi\u0107 === On January 3, 1943, Dra\u017ea Mihajlovi\u0107 issued an order for the \"cleansing of Usta\u0161e-Muslim organizations\" from \u010cajni\u010de region with the explanation that Usta\u0161e and Sand\u017eak Muslim militia forces had continued to attack and kill Serb civilians, rob Serb-populated villages and rape women and girls. Stating that the total number of their armed forces was 2,500, Mihajlovi\u0107 issued his order to: * Mile\u0161eva Corps, commanded by Vojislav Luka\u010devi\u0107 and Raili\u0107 Radoman, * Drina Corps, commanded by Bajo Niki\u010d * Durmitor brigade, commanded by Nikola Bojovi\u0107 \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's report of 13 February 1943 informing Mihailovi\u0107 of the massacres of Muslims in the counties of \u010cajni\u010de and Fo\u010da in southeastern Bosnia and in the county of Pljevlja in the Sand\u017eak. === \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's January raids of revenge === On January 5, 1943, Montenegrin Chetniks, commanded by Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, attacked 33 villages predominantly populated with Muslims in the region of Lower Bihor. They pursued raids of revenge against Sand\u017eak Muslims, many being innocent villagers, with the goal of settling accounts with Muslim militias. A group commanded by Luka\u010devi\u0107 began their attack on January 5, 1943. As soon as they attacked, Italian forces tried to intervene. On the same day a unit commanded by Rade Korda burned 15 houses and killed 15 people. The unit commanded by Mira\u0161 Savi\u0107 began to attack on 6 January. On 10 January, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 reported that the Chetniks under his command had burned down 33 Muslim villages, killed 400 Muslim fighters, and had also killed about 1,000 Muslim women and children in the region of Bjelo Polje. According to some sources, Italians wanted to reward Chetniks because they had agreed to participate in the Case White operation against Communists. This allowed Chetnik attacks on the Muslim population to occur in Sand\u017eak and Montenegro. Chetnik forces began with preparation for this attack on February 1, 1943. At the end of January 1943, Muslims from Kalinovik in eastern Herzegovina advised Muslims from Bukovica not to allow communists to misuse them against Serbs, like Usta\u0161e had misused them in 1942. This advice was not followed and some Muslims from this region continued to terrorize Serbs from Bukovica and neighboring places. After a short battle with Muslim militia, Bukovica fell under Chetnik control. == Casualties == An incomplete list of 576 victims of the Chetnik attack on Bukovica municipality was published in Prilog u krvi Pljevlja 1941\u201345.godine (1969) by the SUBNOR (Union of Veterans of the People's Liberation War). 443 of the listed victims were children under the age of 18. Many of the men escaped, believing that civilian villages would not be in danger. Many civilians were tortured before being killed; a number of women and girls were raped. According to an incomplete list, Chetniks burned 1,171 houses and 468 other buildings. On March 1, 1943, Latif Mo\u010devi\u0107 sent a report to the 1st Alpine Division Taurinense, informing them about this massacre. He stated that the number of victims in Bukovica was about 500 civilians. The Chetniks killed Pavle \u0110urkovi\u0107, a notable person from Bukovica, because he was opposed to the massacre of Muslims. On February 16, 1943, Usta\u0161e reported to their ministry of external affairs that Latif Mo\u010devi\u0107, a detachment commander of Muslim militia from Bukovica, and some other militia members were captured by Italians in \u010cajni\u010de. According to this report, Alija Had\u017eimusi\u0107, a commander of Fo\u010da detachment of Muslim militia, was killed in the battle near \u010cajni\u010de. Usta\u0161e reported that the Muslim militia was surrounded near \u010cajni\u010de, with insufficient ammunition, being \"on the edge of annihilation.\" == Aftermath == On February 28, 1943, there was a conference in Prijepolje attended by Italian Lieutenant General Luigi Mentasti, who was commander of Italian forces in Montenegro. Mentasti asserted that Italian forces were not responsible for the Bukovica massacre, citing the centuries- long conflict between Orthodox Christians and Muslims. In turn, one million Serbs murdered mostly by Muslims on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia which included Bosnia and Hercegovina. He also accused the population of Bukovica of providing haven to a communist agent, an accusation that was denied by the mufti \u0160e\u0107erkadi\u0107 from Pljevlja. Mentasti explained that Italian forces could not guarantee the security of Muslims in Pljevlja and recommended that they follow the example of Muslims from Berane and Bijelo Polje who signed agreements with Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and Chetnik General \u0110ukanovi\u0107. During the war, communists established a commission for the investigation of war crimes of occupying forces and their collaborators. After the war, this commission investigated the massacre committed by Chetniks in villages of the Pljevlja municipality and emphasized that it was committed by Chetniks commanded by Dra\u017ea Mihajlovi\u0107 and his subordinate officers with the approval of the commander of the 1st Alpine Division Taurinense. This commission composed a list of 95 Muslims and 59 Orthodox Christian war criminals in Pljevlja during the war. Seventeen former Chetniks were accused of committing the Bukovica massacre. == References == == Sources == ;Books * * * * * * * * ;Documents * Category:1943 in Montenegro Category:Mass murder in 1943 Category:February 1943 events Category:Massacres in the 1940s Category:History of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Chetnik war crimes in World War II ",
