He is known from the Chronicle of Gallus Anonymus.The diocese of Bishop Pawe\u0142 is not given, and his identification as Bishop of Pozna\u0144 is determined by the lack of space for him in the catalogs of the Ordinary of other Polish dioceses. Gall Anonim dedicated his first and second part of this chronicle, which means that he certainly held his office around 1112/1113. The date of his taking up the diocese and the date of death remain unknown. However, if we assume that Gall in the dedication of his first book mentioned four Polish bishops in the order of seniority counted from consecration, then Paul had to become a bishop before 1110.Listed as the last one, \u017byros\u0142aw became a bishop in Wroc\u0142aw in 1112, the penultimate Maur took the diocese of Krak\u00f3w in 1110, and the first Szymon was a Bishop of P\u0142ock around 1108, when - according to the testimony of Galla himself, he defended Mazovia against the invasion of Pomorzan. The consecration of Paul mentioned in the second place must have taken place before the consecration of Maura (1110), and after Simon's consecration (before 1108); see Abraham, pp. 90-91. 2. Perhaps he became a bishop as a result of Gwalon's legacy in 1103, for it is known that Gwalon has filed two Polish bishops from office. ==References== Category:12th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops of Pozna\u0144 ",
