N. Andersen, at the NE end of Hovgaard Island to the south. Its minimum width is 4 km.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 128 Lynn Island is located about from the mouth of the Dijmphna Sound where it bends in a NE/SW direction. At Cape Marie Dijmphna, the Hekla Sound branches to the NW separating the shore of Lynn Island from the southwestern shore of Holm Land to the north and \u2014bending southward\u2014 with Skallingen in the Greenland mainland to the west, joining again the Dijmphna Sound. Meanwhile, the sound bends further southward west of Hovgaard Island until it meets the Spalte Glacier flowing from the Nioghalvfjerd Fjord in the southwest.
