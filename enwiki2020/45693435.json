Recorded in Germany in 1978 but not released on the hatART label until 1995, the album features a live concert featuring several of Braxton's compositions that were first recorded on Creative Orchestra Music 1976.Anthony Braxton discography accessed March 17, 2015Filippo, R., Enciclopedia del Jazz: Anthony Braxton accessed November 3, 2016Anthony Braxton Project: 1971-1979 Chronology accessed November 7, 2016 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4\u00bd stars stating \"The music is often dense and atonal but never dull, and the closing composition is a superb piece that displays Braxton's love of marching band music! Although one wishes that Anthony Braxton himself had played, this is a set easily recommended to his fans\".Yanow, S., Allmusic Review accessed March 17, 2015 On All About Jazz Jeff Stockton said \"Those curious about Braxton but discouraged by the sheer number of recordings available may find this the place to start. Most of Braxton's work falls into two categories\u2014more difficult and less difficult\u2014but these 100 minutes of music are decidedly in the latter category. Braxton is among a handful of jazz composers whose music is part of the graduate-level course in the avant-garde\" and Troy Collins noted \"Creative Orchestra (Koln) 1978 is an endlessly intriguing concert recording that warrants repeated spins, offering new surprises with each listen\".Stockton, J., All About Jazz Review 1, June 7, 2010Collins, T., All About Jazz Review 2, December 26, 2009 ==Track listing== All compositions by Anthony Braxton'' Disc one # \"Language Improvisations\" - 14:34 # \"Composition 55\" - 12:27 # \"Composition 45\" - 25:21 Disc two # \"Composition 59\" - 21:45 # \"Composition 51\" - 17:19 # \"Composition 58\" - 12:56 ==Personnel== *Anthony Braxton - conductor *Dwight Andrews, Marty Ehrlich, Vinny Golia, J.
