    "text": "The Hebron Yeshiva, Knesses Yisrael (Hebron) Hebron Yeshiva, also known as Yeshivas Hevron, or Knesses Yisroel, is a yeshiva devoted to high-level study of the Talmud. It originated in 1924 when the roshei yeshiva and 150 students of the Slabodka Yeshiva, known colloquially as the \"mother of yeshivas\", relocated to Hebron. ==Relocation of Slabodka Yeshiva to Palestine== Alter of Slabodka surrounded by students in Hebron. A 1924 edict requiring enlistment in the military or supplementary secular studies in the yeshiva led a large number of students in the Slabodka yeshiva to relocate to Palestine. Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, also known as \"Der Alter fun Slabodka\" (The Elder of Slabodka), sent Rabbi Avraham Grodzinski to head this group and establish the yeshiva in Hebron.See Toras Avraham page 13 Upon Grodzinski's return to Slabodka, the Alter transferred the mashgiach ruchani responsibilities to him, and the rosh yeshiva duties to Rabbi Yitzchok Isaac Sher, and he moved to Hebron to lead the yeshiva there together with Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein.Toras Avraham page 13 Hebron was chosen over Jerusalem to avoid the influence of the conservative Old Yishuv. The Slabodka yeshiva in Europe ceased operation during the Holocaust. A branch was also established in Bnei Brak. ==1929 Hebron massacre and relocation to Jerusalem== pogrom. Twenty-four students were murdered in the 1929 Hebron massacre, and the yeshiva was re-established in the Geula neighbourhood of Jerusalem. On the day of the 1929 massacre, HaRav Simcha Zissel Broide, who was appointed Rosh Yeshiva in 5721 (1960/61), was not in Chevron. Despite a delay after the death of Rabbi Moshe Hebroni, the last of the previous generation, the yeshiva moved into a new and larger campus in the south- central Givat Mordechai neighbourhood in 1975. This yeshiva today has about 1300 students and is one of the most prestigious and influential Lithuanian yeshivohs in Israel. The current roshei yeshiva are Rabbi Dovid Cohen and Rabbi Yosef Chevroni. == Prominent alumni == Geula branch of the Hebron yeshiva. * Yitzchak Abadi, Rosh Kollel, Kollel Ohel Torah * Meyer Abovitz, av beis din in Russia * Yehuda Amital, rosh yeshiva, Yeshivat Har Etzion (Gush Etzion, West Bank) * Ratzon Arusi * Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, Sepharadi Chief Rabbi of Israel * Menachem Mendel Blachman, Rosh yeshiva, Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh (Yavneh, Israel) * Zvi Block, Talmudic instructor, Mir yeshiva (Brooklyn, New York) * Simcha Zissel Broide, Rosh Yeshiva * Meir Chadash, Mashgiach * Aryeh Deri, Minister of the Development of the Negev and Galilee (Israel) * Menachem Elon, the former Deputy Chief Israeli Supreme Court (Israel) * Ephraim Epstein, Chicago rabbi (before the move to Hebron) * Baruch Mordechai Ezrachi, rosh yeshiva, Yeshiva Ateres Yisrael, Jerusalem * Zalman Nechemia Goldberg * Shlomo Goren, Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel * Rene Gutman, Chief Rabbi, (Strasbourg, France) * Yeshayahu Hadari, rosh yeshiva, Yeshivat Hakotel (Jerusalem) * Yitzchok Hutner, rosh yeshiva, Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin (Brooklyn, New York) * Shneur Kotler, rosh yeshiva, Beth Medrash Govoha (Lakewood, New Jersey) * Dov Landau, rosh yeshiva, Slabodka yeshiva (Bnei Brak, Israel) * Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz * Aryeh L.
