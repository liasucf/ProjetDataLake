    "text": "Why Cheat India is a 2019 Indian Hindi-language crime drama film written and directed by Soumik Sen. It features Emraan Hashmi and Shreya Dhanwanthary in the lead roles. The film was theatrically released on 18 January 2019. It received mixed reviews and was a box office bomb grossing just 8.66 crore against its 20 crore budget. ==Plot== The film starts off by showing the reality of Indian Education System and how children are pressurised by their parents to become a doctor or an engineer. The scene cuts off to Kota, where a boy named Satyendra \"Sattu\" Dubey lives in a rented house and is doing his coaching to crack the engineering entrance exam. After his coaching, he returns to his house in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh where he lives with his parents, elder sister Nupur Dubey, and his grandmother. The day of the entrance exam comes and Sattu writes his paper well. When the results are out, Sattu ranks 287. While at a theatre, Sattu and his friends are told to move to the lower seats by some corrupt politicians but when Rakesh Singh is asked to do the same, he refuses, fights with the goons and gets them arrested by the police. Rakesh visits Sattu's house and takes him to a tea stall where he gives his contact number to him. The next day, Sattu calls him at a restaurant and Rakesh gives him an offer. If he gives the exams of some rich candidates who want admissions in colleges, he will be rewarded \u20b950,000 per student. Sattu agrees and starts taking exams, earning a lot of money for his family. Whenever he goes for higher-level exams to places like Kolkata and Mumbai, he has sex with prostitutes. Meanwhile, Rakesh goes to his house where his sister is getting married, and it is revealed that Rakesh is married. Sattu is later rusticated from his college because he was caught with drugs, he is arrested and still addicted to drugs. After he recovers, Rakesh hands him the latter's degree certificate and asks him to go to Qatar for work. After a few years, Rakesh reunites with Sattu's elder sister Nupur. They spend a good time until a twist takes place in their lives. One day, Nupur tells him that she wants to do an MBA in order to get promoted to a higher post. Rakesh gets the MBA paper solved by some of his students and calls Nupur to her office's parking area. When Rakesh reaches there and tells Nupur that he has got the paper leaked, cameras flashe on his face, all the vehicle's headlights turn on and the police inspector arrests him for leaking the paper. The movie goes into a flashback showing that Sattu is fired off from his job as his degree was just a Photoshop certificate with just his name (created by Rakesh to get him out of the exams and rustication load). Sattu commits suicide. The scene returns to the present time showing that Nupur had taken revenge for her brother's suicide. After being bailed from jail, Rakesh builds an engineering college on his father's name which runs successfully. == Cast == * Emraan Hashmi as Rakesh Kumar Singh (Rocky) * Shreya Dhanwanthary as Nupur Dubey * Shivani Bedi as Rakesh wife * Snigdhadeep Chatterjee as Satyendra Dubey \"Sattu\" * Manuj Sharma as Bablu (Rakesh's Friend) * Nawal Shukla as Yogesh Dubey (Nupur & Sattu's Father) * Anita Sahgal as Nupur's & Sattu's Mother * Mahesh Chandra Deva as Vaidhya politician * Rajesh Jais as Public Prosecutor * Varun Tamta as Police Officer Qureshi * Tanmay Lahiri as Salim Qureshi (Police Officer Qureshi's Son) * Vishesh Srivastava as Chandra Mohan Badani *Shubham Somu Srivastava as Assistant Director & MBA student ==Release== In January 2019, the film's title was altered due to a last-minute objection from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).

Retrieved 29 January 2019. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== The film got mixed reviews from critics. Shubhra Gupta writing for The Indian Express says \" Why Cheat India is disjointed and disappointing, never quite knowing which side it is on, even as it spends time showing us how good students can be ruined by greed, and how parents can put killing pressure on their children in their struggle to break the vicious gap between present debt and potential income.\" she further says \"The material is slender and too stretched over two hours, as it goes from engineering-medicine into management, the holy grail.\" She concludes her review with \"Finally, the villain is outed: it is the confused, contrived writing. Why cheat us the viewers?\" Priyanka Sinha Jha of News18.com giving 3 stars out of 5 writes \"Emraan Hashmi's Shortcut to Success is Worth a Watch 'Why Cheat India' takes up a subject that is novel and immediately strikes a chord with practically anyone in India who has appeared for competitive exams. Unfortunately, though Director Soumik Sen, who\u2019s also the writer of the film, fails to turn all this wonderful material into a compelling film. Why Cheat India\u2019s Achilles heel is its inability to infuse a powerful premise with the dramatic heft it required. The script does not rise above the research points and the writing is clumsy in parts. More often than not, there are easy and simplistic resolutions to tricky situations. The screenplay attempts to go in many directions and ends up going it goes nowhere. While trying to make the film something of a commercial potboiler and satire, Why Cheat India falls between the two stools it tries to stand upon.\" She ends her review with \"However, because the film\u2019s heart is in the right place and its observations astute, Why Cheat India is worth a watch.\" ===Box office=== Gaurang Chauhan of Times Now News reports: \"Why Cheat India has opened on a poor note at the box office. So much so, that it might turn out to be one of the lowest openers for Emraan Hashmi in recent times. Ironically, this is also one of his better-received films in recent times. The occupancy rate is only around 5 per cent for Why Cheat.\" The domestic collection of the film is 8.66 crore. == Soundtrack == The music of the film is composed by Rochak Kohli, Guru Randhawa, Krsna Solo, Kunaal- Rangon, Agnee and Soumik Sen while the lyrics are penned by Manoj Muntashir, Kumaar, Kunaal Verma, Guru Randhawa and Juhi Saklani. 'Dil Main Ho Tum' first two lines are inspired from the song \"Dil Main Ho Tum\" from the 1987 film Satyamev Jayte (1987), originally composed by Bappi Lahiri, then recreated by Rochak Kohli. == References == == External links == * * * Category:2019 crime drama films Category:Films about corruption in India Category:2010s Hindi- language films Category:Films about the education system in India Category:Indian crime drama films Category:Hindi-language films Category:T-Series films Category:Films directed by Soumik Sen Category:2019 films ",
