    "text": "The Conservative Party of Canada elects its leaders through a process known as a leadership election. The most recent leadership election was held in 2020. Since 2004, the party has elected its leaders on a one member, one vote basis using a ranked ballot. The process is weighted so that each riding is allocated 100 points, divided proportionately among candidates based on their percentage of the vote in that riding. This process was first used in the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership election, a predecessor party of the modern Conservative Party. ==2004 leadership election== Held in Toronto, Ontario on March 20, 2004. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Results by round |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Candidate ! colspan=\"2\"|Votes cast ! colspan=\"2\"|Points won |- style=\"background:lightgreen;\" |50px | Stephen Harper | 67,143 | 68.9% | 17,296 | 56.2% |- |50px |Belinda Stronach | 22,286 | 22.9% | 10,613 | 34.5% |- |50px |Tony Clement | 7,968 | 8.2% | 2,887 | 9.4% |- | colspan=\"2\"|Total | 97,397 | 100% | 30,796 | 100% |} ==2017 leadership election== Held in Toronto, Ontario on May 27, 2017. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Results by round |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidate ! colspan=\"2\" |Round 1 ! colspan=\"2\" |Round 13 |- !Points !% !Points !% |- style=\"background:lightgreen;\" |Andrew Scheer |7,375.79 |21.82% |17,222.20 |50.95% |- |Maxime Bernier |9,763.32 |28.89% |16,577.80 |49.05% |- |Erin O'Toole |3,600.72 |10.65% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Brad Trost |2,820.87 |8.35% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Michael Chong |2,552.47 |7.55% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Kellie Leitch |2,366.09 |7.00% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Pierre Lemieux |2,495.71 |7.38% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Lisa Raitt |1,127.93 |3.34% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Steven Blaney |426.37 |1.26% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Chris Alexander |379.10 |1.12% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Kevin O'Leary |361.21 |1.07% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Rick Peterson |220.58 |0.65% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Andrew Saxton |169.94 |0.50% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |- |Deepak Obhrai |139.90 |0.41% |style=\"background:pink;\"| |style=\"background:pink;\"| |} ==2020 leadership election== Conducted by mail- in ballot due August 21, with results announced on August 23-24. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Results by round |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Candidate ! colspan=\"4\" |1st round ! colspan=\"4\" |2nd round ! colspan=\"4\" |3rd round |- !Votes cast !% !Points allocated !% !Votes cast !% !Points allocated !% !Votes cast !% !Points allocated !% |- style=\"background:lightgreen;\" | 50px | Erin O'Toole |51,258 |29.39% |10,681.40 |31.60% |56,907 |33.20% |11,903.69 |35.22% |90,635 |58.86% |19,271.74 |57.02% |- | 50px | Peter MacKay |52,851 |30.30% |11,328.55 |33.52% |54,165 |31.60% |11,756.01 |34.78% |63,356 |41.14% |14,528.26 |42.98% |- | 50px | Leslyn Lewis |43,017 |24.67% |6,925.38 |20.49% |60,316 |35.20% |10,140.30 |30.00% | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:pink; text- align:center\" | Eliminated |- | 50px | Derek Sloan |27,278 |15.64% |4,864.67 |14.39% | colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:pink; text-align:center\" | Eliminated |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Total !align=\"right\"| 174,404 !align=\"right\"| 100% !align=\"right\"| 33,800 !align=\"right\"| 100% !align=\"right\"| 171,388 !align=\"right\"| 100% !align=\"right\"| 33,800 !align=\"right\"| 100% !align=\"right\"| 153,991 !align=\"right\"| 100% !align=\"right\"| 33,800 !align=\"right\"| 100% |} ==See also== *Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leadership elections *Canadian Alliance leadership elections ==References== ",
