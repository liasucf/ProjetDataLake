All of the channel's content is voice-overed into Azerbaijani, except for those that are Azerbaijan original and those that include no talking. ==History== Old logo from 10 April 2015 to 19 September 2016.ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f was launched on 10 April 2015. By the command of the National Television and Radio Council of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2011, ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f is licensed to broadcast for 6 years. The channel was previously known as G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f TV (or Gunesh TV). On 19 September 2016, G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f TV rebranded into ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f, a fusion with ARB Media Qrup, with a new logo but some of the same programming. Their old slogan was 'G\u00fcn\u0259\u015fi yand\u0131r' (Turn on the sun), but was changed to '\u00d6lk\u0259nin ilk u\u015faq kanal\u0131' (The country's first children's channel). The channel also went from 4:3 to 16:9. On 4 March 2019, the channel shut down until 9 March 2019 for unknown reasons, while showing a few commercials.
