    "text": "The voiced palatal approximant is a type of consonant used in many spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is . The equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `j`, and in the Americanist phonetic notation it is . Because the English name of the letter J, jay, starts with (voiced palato-alveolar affricate), the approximant is sometimes instead called yod (jod), as in the phonological history terms yod-dropping and yod-coalescence. The palatal approximant can often be considered the semivocalic equivalent of the close front unrounded vowel . The two are almost identical featurally. They alternate with each other in certain languages, such as French, and in the diphthongs of some languages as and , with the non- syllabic diacritic used in different phonetic transcription systems to represent the same sound. Some languages, however, have a palatal approximant that is unspecified for rounding and so cannot be considered the semivocalic equivalent of either or its rounded counterpart, , which would normally correspond to . An example is Spanish, which distinguishes two palatal approximants: an approximant semivowel , which is always unrounded, and an unspecified for rounding approximant consonant . Eugenio Mart\u00ednez Celdr\u00e1n describes the difference between them as follows (with audio examples added): He also considers that \"the IPA shows a lack of precision in the treatment it gives to approximants, if we take into account our understanding of the phonetics of Spanish. and are two different segments, but they have to be labelled as voiced palatal approximant consonants. I think that the former is a real consonant, whereas the latter is a semi-consonant, as it has traditionally been called in Spanish, or a semi-vowel, if preferred. The IPA, though, classifies it as a consonant.\" There is a parallel problem with transcribing the voiced velar approximant. The symbol may also be used when the palatal approximant is merely an allophone of the voiced palatal fricative since it is somewhat more similar to the symbol than {{angbr IPA|j}. The X-SAMPA equivalent of is `j\\_o`. The symbol may not display properly in all browsers. In that case, should be substituted. In the writing systems used for most languages in Central, Northern, and Eastern Europe, the letter j denotes the palatal approximant, as in German 'year'. That is followed by IPA although it may be counterintuitive for English-speakers although words occur with that sound in a few loanwords in English like Hebrew \"hallelujah\" and German \"J\u00e4germeister\". In grammars of Ancient Greek, the palatal approximant, which was lost early in the history of Greek, is sometimes written as , an iota with the inverted breve below, which is the nonsyllabic diacritic or marker of a semivowel. There is also the post-palatal approximantInstead of \"post- palatal\", it can be called \"retracted palatal\", \"backed palatal\", \"palato- velar\", \"pre-velar\", \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\" or \"front-velar\". For simplicity, this article uses only the term \"post-palatal\". in some languages, which is articulated slightly more back than the place of articulation of the prototypical palatal approximant but less far back than the prototypical velar approximant. It can be considered the semivocalic equivalent of the close central unrounded vowel , and both are almost identical featurally. The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, but it can be transcribed as , (both symbols denote a retracted ), or (both symbols denote an advanced ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are `j_-` and `M\\_+`, respectively. Other possible transcriptions include a centralized ( in the IPA, `j_\"` in X-SAMPA), a centralized ( in the IPA, `M\\_\"` in X-SAMPA) and a non-syllabic ( in the IPA, `1_^` in X-SAMPA). For the reasons mentioned above and in the article velar approximant, none of those symbols are appropriate for languages such as Spanish, whose post-palatal approximant consonant (not a semivowel) appears as an allophone of before front vowels and is best transcribed , (both symbols denote a lowered and retracted ), or (both symbols denote a lowered and advanced ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are `j\\_o_-` and `G_o_+`. Especially in broad transcription, the post-palatal approximant may be transcribed as a palatalized velar approximant (, or in the IPA, `M\\'`, `M\\_j`, `G'_o` or `G_o_j` in X-SAMPA). ==Features== Features of the voiced palatal approximant: The most common type of this approximant is glide or semivowel. The term glide emphasizes the characteristic of movement (or 'glide') of from the vowel position to a following vowel position. The term semivowel emphasizes that, although the sound is vocalic in nature, it is not 'syllabic' (it does not form the nucleus of a syllable). For a description of the approximant consonant variant used e.g. in Spanish, see above. The otherwise identical post-palatal variant is articulated slightly behind the hard palate, making it sound slightly closer to the velar . ==Occurrence== ===Palatal=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!
