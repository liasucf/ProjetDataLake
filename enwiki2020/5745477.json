    "text": "In mathematics, in the realm of group theory, a subgroup of a group is said to be centrally closed if the centralizer of any nonidentity element of the subgroup lies inside the subgroup. Some facts about centrally closed subgroups: * Every malnormal subgroup is centrally closed. * Every Frobenius kernel is centrally closed. * SA subgroups are precisely the centrally closed Abelian subgroups. * The trivial subgroup and the whole group are centrally closed.
