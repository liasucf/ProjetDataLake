    "text": "La Esperanza () is the capital city and a municipality of the same name of the department of Intibuc\u00e1, Honduras. La Esperanza is famous for having the coolest climate in Honduras. It is considered the heart of the Ruta Lenca (Lenca Trail), a region of Lenca ethnic influence that spans Honduras from Santa Rosa de Copan to Choluteca. Sites on the Lenca Trail have been designated by the government and United Nations development in order to encourage more cultural tourism, and help create new markets for the traditional crafts, such as pottery, practiced by the Lenca, in order to preserve their culture. The city of La Esperanza is merged indistinguishably with the city of Intibuc\u00e1, the head of the neighboring municipality of Intibuc\u00e1. Intibuc\u00e1 is the older of the twin cities and was originally an indigenous Lenca community, while La Esperanza is the newer ladino community. Although the two cities have separate municipal governments, they are often referred to jointly as La Esperanza as they are only separated by a city street that crosses the city. Residents of La Esperanza are traditionally referred to as esperanzanos and residents of Intibuc\u00e1 as intibucanos. ==History== The area was originally occupied by Maya and Lenca people from pre-Columbian times who formed two settlements called Eramani and Lentercala. In 1647, Mayor Francisco de La Cerda was appointed by the Spanish throne to officially demarcate the territory of the indigenous population. He divided the land into two jurisdictions, not corresponding to the Eramani and Lentercala sites, and created boundaries and names for the surrounding small communities. Over time, the two jurisdictions developed a rivalry, especially over land. The cities grew in population, especially in the 1800s, and La Esperanza was named a villa on 22 September 1848. La Esperanza officially became a city in 1883 when the department of Intibuc\u00e1 was formed by separating from the neighbouring department of Lempira, then called Gracias. In 2002, permits were obtained by the Consorcio de Inversiones SA de CV (CISA) to build a hydro electric dam on the Rio Intibuc\u00e1 over an abandoned hydro project. Called the La Esperanza Hydro Project after the city, the dam began producing electricity for the surrounding communities in 2003, but its phase two expansion was not completed until 2006. The project was the first in the world to generate Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). ==Geography== Catholic Church in the Central Park of La Esperanza La Esperanza sits at an altitude of 1700 meters, making it the highest city in Honduras. It is bisected by the Rio Intibuc\u00e1 which runs from the municipality of Intibuc\u00e1 through the municipality of La Esperanza. La Esperanza is situated in a relatively flat mountain valley, bordered by two chains of mountains, the Sierra de Puca Opalaca to the north and Monta\u00f1a Zapochoco to the Southeast. The area of the La Esperanza municipality is 138.8 km2 and Intibuc\u00e1 531 km2.Honduras Geographic Information Systems Data, Honduran National Census, Peace Corps Honduras, 2001. La Esperanza Airport runs along the valley south of the two cities. ===Climate=== La Esperanza experiences two distinct seasons: the rainy season/winter from May to October and the dry season/summer from November to April. The rainiest months are June and September, and the driest months February and March. During the winter, it rains primarily in the afternoon and the intense showers often make small dirt roads into the surrounding mountain communities impassable. La Esperanza receives average annual precipitation of 1400 mm. Due to its high altitude, La Esperanza has a cooler climate than most of Honduras, with an average annual temperature of 18.6 \u00b0C (65.5 \u00b0F). Temperatures in December and January often fall into the 40s at night. Hail has been reported on occasion, but it has never snowed. In the summer, high temperatures reach the 80s, but with low average humidity around 76%. ==Population== The projected population of La Esperanza for 2018 is 13,800, with 9,900 in the urban area and 3,900 in rural areas of the municipality. Additionally, the projected population for the neighboring municipality of Intibuc\u00e1 of 63,000 in the municipality, including 23,800 in the urban area and 39,000 in the rural areas, translates to a population of 37,600 in the combined urban areas of La Esperanza and Intibuc\u00e1. === Towns and Hamlets === The municipality has the following five villages (aldeas), which encompass 36 hamlets (caser\u00edos): * La Esperanza ** El Terrero ** Finca Las Terrazas o El Refugio ** Finca San Jos\u00e9 Del Ed\u00e9n ** Finca Santa Anita ** La Laguna ** La Pozona ** Las Anonas ** Lepaterique ** San Esteban ** Tierra Colorada ** Los Diez Chorritos ** Piedra Menuda ** El Invernadero * Chogola ** Chogola ** Agua Blanca ** El Arenal ** El Mango o Las Pilas ** Hda. de Quiala ** Llano de La Cruz ** Quiala ** Puente Hondo ** La Sierra * El Pel\u00f3n ** El Pel\u00f3n ** Llano Chalingua * La Pimienta ** La Pimienta ** El Garrapatero * Nueva Esperanza ** Nueva Esperanza ** El Pastal ** El Pital ** La Monta\u00f1a ** San Antonio ** San Juan o Los Roquitos ** San Vicente ** Palos Blancos ==Culture== The predominant ethnic group are the Lenca people, who have occupied the southwest region of Honduras since pre-Columbian times. The Lenca are the largest ethnic group in Honduras, numbering just over 100,000. The Lenca once had a distinct language which is now extinct. They continue to practice traditional customs and arts, such as the production of textiles and pottery, dances, and clothing. The Lenca people, particularly women, can be recognised by their unique style of dress, including brightly coloured dresses and woven head scarves called pa\u00f1uelos. Daily Lenca fresh produce market Life in La Esperanza and Intibuc\u00e1 is centred primarily on agriculture, which is the mainstay of most residents, especially the Lenca. Due to its uniquely cool climate, the department is able to produce products that other departments cannot, including potatoes, strawberries and apples. La Esperanza is famous for its daily farmers market which draws vendors and shoppers from around the department. Lenca farmers arrive from the surrounding communities and sell their fruits and vegetables in the street, while some La Esperanza residents manage permanent wooden stalls. Produce available includes lettuce, spinach, carrots, cucumbers, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet and hot peppers, yucca, onions, cilantro, apples, blackberries, mangoes, pineapple, bananas, platanos, avocadoes, grapes, peaches and strawberries. The busiest market days are Saturday and Sunday. ===Celebrations=== Dancers in the national dance festival, El Grande de Grandes As in the rest of Honduras, the majority of the population is Roman Catholic, with a growing percentage of Evangelicals. As such, Christmastime or Navidad, and Holy Week preceding Easter, called Semana Santa, are major times of celebration. Christmas Eve, known as Nochebuena, is celebrated with a late-night dinner with family and friends followed by lighting fireworks at midnight. For Holy Week, there is generally a series of processions and activities related to each day. Good Friday, Viernes Santo has the largest procession in a re-enactment of Christ's journey to the cross. The people create alfombras along the path of the procession, designed carpets on the street made of coloured sawdust. Most businesses are closed Thursday (Maundy Thursday) and Friday of Holy Week, which are national holidays. In addition to Christmas and Easter, the people celebrate several other annual festivals and holidays, including: * Artisan Festival (Feria de Artesan\u00eda de La Ruta Lenca) \u2013 February * Anniversary of the Department of Intibuc\u00e1 \u2013 16 April * National Mushroom and Wine Festival (Festival Nacional del Choro y el Vino) \u2013 June or July * Potato Festival (Feria de La Papa) \u2013 July * El Grande de Grandes (International traditional dance competition) \u2013 the last Saturday in October * Independence from Spain (D\u00eda de Independencia) \u2013 15 September * Festival of the Patron Saint, Virgin of Conception (Feria Patronal de la Virgen de Concepcion) \u2013 29 November to 7 December Festivals may include parades, processions, marching bands, food tents, artisan demonstrations, traditional dancing, live music and fireworks. ===Artisan products=== Local people make a variety of skilled handicrafts. Many women's groups use hand-constructed wooden looms to produce traditional Lenca woven textiles such as ponchos, scarves, shawls, head scarves, table runners and tablecloths in bright colours. A growing number of groups have begun to take advantage of the ample number of fallen pine needles from the surrounding forests, which they weave into sturdy and decorative baskets, pot holders, and vases. White clay local to the region is used to produce a variety of unique ceramic items. La Esperanza is well known for the production of sweet, liqueur-like wines from fruits such as strawberries, pears, peaches, blackberries, and apples as well as the local favourite, potatoes. Visitors to La Esperanza can purchase these items and many other artisan products from around Honduras at one of the three primary souvenir stores in town, UMMIL (Union de Mujeres Microempresarias Lencas de Intibuca), Opalacas, and El Rincon del Turista. ===National Capital of Honduran Folklore=== On 23 July 2013 La Esperanza was declared the national capital of Honduran folklore, in tribute to the folklorist and native son of La Esperanza, Rafael Manzanares Aguilar. Rafael Manzanares was a Honduran folklorist, author and musical composer. He created the Cuadro Nacional De Danzas Folkl\u00f3ricas de Honduras and was instrumental in the revival of folklore traditions in Honduras. The designation of the capital of Honduran folklore is realised in La Esperanza each year by the folklore festival El Grande de Grandes. Folk dance groups from all parts of Honduras present their regional dances and costumes while competing in this all-day festival. ==Tourism== La Esperanza is located on the route between Tegucigalpa and Western Honduras, making it a convenient place for stopping while traveling in the country. It is a designated site of the Ruta Lenca. La Esperanza/Intibuc\u00e1 has plenty of hotels, restaurant and shops in every price range.

Religious ceremonies and cultural activities characteristic of the region are performed at the foot of the staircase. According to tradition, La Gruta was made by area residents and inmates of the penal center under orders of the commander of arms J. In\u00e9s P\u00e9rez during the government of Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino. Perez reportedly built it to fulfill a vow that he made while hiding in the cave to escape being killed by his enemies. The staircase forks behind the chapel until it reaches a hill of dense vegetation that affords a dramatic view the city and the surrounding region. *Lenca Cultural Museum \u2013 This is housed in the Casa de Cultura of La Esperanza, a large pink building two blocks up from the Central Park toward La Gruta.
