It was centered on Isesaki jin'ya in what is now part of the city of Isesaki, Gunma. Isesaki was ruled through most of its history by a junior branch of the Sakai clan. ==History== Isesaki Domain was originally created in 1601 for Inagaki Nagashige, a hatamoto formerly in the service of the Imagawa clan who had transferred his allegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. After Tokugawa Ieyasu took control over the Kant\u014d region in 1590, he assigned estates with revenues of 3000 koku to Inagaki Nagashige in K\u014dzuke Province, and entrusted him with the defense of Ogo Castle. He was awarded additional estates in 1601, following Ieyasu\u2019s defeat at the hands of Uesugi Kagekatsu at Aizu, which elevated him to the rank of daimy\u014d. His son was transferred in 1616, and Isesaki was thereafter ruled by three junior branches of the Sakai clan until the end of the Edo period. During the Bakumatsu period, forces of Iseskai Domain played a role in the suppression of the Tengut\u014d Rebellion; however the next-to-last daimyo, Sakai Tadatsuyo was quick to join the imperial side in the Boshin War. After the end of the conflict, with the abolition of the han system in July 1871, Isesaki Domain became \"Isesaki Prefecture\", which later became part of Gunma Prefecture. The domain had a population of 1964 samurai in 520 households per a census in 1763.Edo daimyo.net ==Holdings at the end of the Edo period== Unlike most domains in the han system, which consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned kokudaka, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields,Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B.
