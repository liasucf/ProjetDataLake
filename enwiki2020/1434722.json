    "text": "Elections to the United States House of Representatives were held in 1878 and 1879 for Representatives to the 46th United States Congress. These elections occurred in the middle of President Rutherford B. Hayes's term. With a sour economy as the nation's pressing issue, both major parties lost seats to the new Greenback Party, which was established to promote the long-term use of paper money as a solution to stop enormous economic fluctuations. The Democratic Party remained the largest party, but lost its majority. However, it allied with several independent politicians and was able to remain in power. Notable freshmen included James B. Weaver, who would later run for president as the Greenback candidate in 1880 and the Populist candidate in 1892. This was the fourth and last recorded House election where both major parties lost seats at the same time. == Election summaries == {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white\" | style=\"background:; width:48.12%\" | 141 | style=\"background:; width:2.39%\" | 7 | style=\"background:; width:4.44%\" | 13 | style=\"background:; width:45.05%\" | 132 |- | Democratic | Independent Democratic | GB | Republican |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- valign=bottom ! rowspan=2 | State ! rowspan=2 | Type ! rowspan=2 | Total seats ! colspan=2 | Democratic ! colspan=2 | Republican ! colspan=2 | Greenback ! colspan=2 | Independent Democratic |- ! | Seats ! | Change ! | Seats ! | Change ! | Seats ! | Change ! | Seats ! | Change |- !

The almost statewide exclusion of Republicans as Commissioners of Elections, and the ensuing appointment of nearly all Democratic Managers of Elections, allowed to Democratic Managers to perpetrate this scheme.
