    "text": "Children's Ward (retitled The Ward from 1995 to 1998) is a British children's television drama series produced by Granada Television and broadcast on the ITV network as part of its Children's ITV strand on weekday afternoons. The programme was set \u2013 as the title suggests \u2013 in Ward B1, the children's ward of the fictitious South Park Hospital (known as Sparky's), and told the stories of the young patients and the staff present there. Aimed at older children and teenagers, Children's Ward was a long-lived series for a children's drama, starting life in 1988 as a contribution to the Dramarama anthology strand, \"Blackbird Singing In The Dead of Night\", then first broadcast as a series in 1989 and running from then until 2000. ==Production history== The series was conceived by Granada staff writers Paul Abbott and Kay Mellor, both of whom went on to enjoy successful careers as award-winning writers of adult television drama. At the time, they were both working on the soap opera Coronation Street, and had recently collaborated on a script for Dramarama. Abbott, who had been through a troubled childhood himself, had initially wanted to set the series in a children's care home rather than a hospital, but this was vetoed by Granada executives. During the course of its run, however, Children's Ward won many plaudits for covering difficult issues such as cancer, alcoholism, drug addiction and child abuse in a sensitive manner. The programme won many awards, including in 1997 a BAFTA Children's Award for Best Drama, won by an episode in which a serial killer lures children to him via the internet and is \u2013 highly unusually for children's television \u2013 not eventually caught. Welsh television producer Russell T Davies was the show's producer, and writer of several episodes, from 1992 to 1995. The decision to end Children's Ward came in mid-2000, after transmission of the final series, and ironically came as the sole original cast member Rita May \u2013 who played Auxiliary Nurse Mags \u2013 said she had no plans to leave the show. On 5 and 6 January 2013, the show was repeated as part of CITV's Old Skool Weekend, which celebrated thirty years of the children's strand. This was also the first time the programme was seen on the CITV Channel. ==Filming location== Filmed at Bolton General Hospital (now the Royal Bolton Hospital), in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Some exterior shots (such as the exterior entrance to the children's hospital) were filmed outside the now demolished Maternity Hospital entrance at the former Withington Hospital, South Manchester. 30 Years of CITV, which aired on ITV1 on 29 December 2012, revealed that interior sets for the hospital were filmed next door to some of the Coronation Street interiors. ==Characters== These are the original main characters from the first three series. Some lasted several years and appeared in subsequent series. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" ! style=\"width:200px;\" scope=\"col\"|Character ! style=\"width:200px;\"|Actor/Actress ! style=\"width:300px;\"|Occupation ! style=\"width:300px;\"|Duration ! style=\"width:300px;\"|Role |- |Dr. McKeown |Ian McCulloch | Consultant Paediatrician |1989 !rowspan=13|Staff |- |Dr. Charlotte Woods |Carol Harvey | Originally Houseman to Dr McKeown, later Consultant Paediatrician |1989\u20131991 |- |Charge Nurse Dave Spencer |Andrew Hall | Charge Nurse |1989 |- |Sister Diane Meadows |Janette Beverley | Staff Nurse (1989\u20131992) Senior Staff Nurse (1992\u20131994) Ward Sister (1996) |1989\u20131994, 1996 |- |Senior Sister Margaret 'Mags' Davis |Rita May | Auxiliary Nurse (1989\u20131993) Senior Staff Nurse (1993\u20131995) Ward Sister (1995\u20131997) Senior Ward Sister (1997\u20131999) Clinical Matron (1999\u20132000) |1989\u20132000 |- |Student Nurse Gary Miller |Tim Stanley | Student Nurse |1989\u20131991 |- |Jack Crossley |Ken Parry | Porter and Sweet Trolley Man |1989\u20131991 |- |Staff Nurse Jan Stevens |Nina Baden-Semper | Staff Nurse |1989 |- |Unnamed Character |Ross King | Hospital Radio DJ |1989 |- |Steve Bailey |Michael Bray | Social Worker |1989\u20131991 |- |Sister Sandra Mitchell |Judy Holt | Staff Nurse (1991) Senior Staff Nurse (1991\u20131992) Acting Deputy Clinical Matron (1992\u20131993) Ward Sister (1993\u20131994) |1990\u20131994 |- |Dr. Kieran Gallagher |Tom Higgins |Senior House Officer, Emergency Medicine |1990\u20131991 |- |Katie Grahams |Margery Bone | Student Nurse |1990\u20131991 |- |Keely Johnson |Jenny Luckraft | Patient (1989) Play Assistant Student Nurse Staff Nurse |1989\u20131994 ! rowspan=\"17\" |Patients |- |Billy Ryan |Tim Vincent | |1989\u20131991 |- |Fiona Brett |Rebecca Sowden | |1989 |- |Darren Walsh |William Ash | |1989\u20131991 |- |Dawn Khatir |Leyla Nejad | |1989\u20131990 |- |Mathew McCann |Dean Gatiss | |1990 |- |Lisa Dixon |Rachel Egan | |1990 |- |Ian Cassin. |Paul Swaine | |1998 |- |J.J. |Chris Bisson | |1990 |- |Thea |Chloe Newsome | |1990 |- |James Boyce |Carl Rice | |1990 |- |Lee Jones |Kieran O'Brien | |1990 |- |Cal Spicer |Mark Dixon | |1990 |- |Bryony Shaeffer |Sarah Cooper | |1990 |- |Ben Rowlingson |William Mellor | |1990 |- |Mickey Bell |Stephen Graham | |1990 |- |Scott Morris |Anthony Lewis | |1996\u20131998 |} *Actors to go on to other theatre and television work include Chris Bisson, Tina O'Brien, Samia Ghadie, Adele Silva, Alan Halsall, Stephen Graham, Steven Arnold, Danny Dyer, Jeff Hordley, Nikki Sanderson, Andrew Lee Potts, Vicky Binns, Ralf Little, Anthony Lewis, Tim Vincent, Kieran O'Brien, Ben Sowden, William Ash and Jane Danson. ==Tie-in publications== ===Novelisations=== * * * * * * ===Script book=== * Exact title unknown, possibly Children's Ward.
