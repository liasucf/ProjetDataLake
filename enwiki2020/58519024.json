    "text": "The Kenya Standard Gauge Railway is a railway system that will connect Kenyan cities, and link the country to the neighboring country of Uganda, and through Uganda, to South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi. There are also plans to link to Addis Ababa, in neighboring Ethiopia to the north. The first segment, between Mombasa and Nairobi, opened passenger rail service in June 2017, and freight rail service in January 2018. Other segments are under construction or planned. The new Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), is intended to replace the old, inefficient metre-gauge railway system. ==Location== The railway system consists of several major sections: ; Mombasa\u2013Nairobi Section This section, measuring , is known as the Mombasa\u2013Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway, and connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya. Passenger rail services between Mombasa and Nairobi started on 1 June 2017, and freight rail services on 1 January 2018. It was built between October 2016 and January 2018, by China Road and Bridge Corporation, at a cost of US$3.6 billion, 90 percent of which was borrowed from the Exim Bank of China, with the Kenyan government providing the remaining 10 percent. ; Nairobi\u2013Naivasha Section This section was also contracted to the company that constructed the Mombasa\u2013Nairobi Section. The line stretches from Nairobi to Naivasha, a distance of about , at cost of KSh150 billion (US$1.5 billion), borrowed from the China Export-Import Bank. Construction began in 2018 and is expected to conclude in December 2019. International freight for neighbouring countries interchanges at the Naivasha Inland Container Depot. ; Naivasha\u2013Kisumu Section This section, measuring , stretching from Naivasha to Kisumu, on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria, is contracted to China Communications Construction Company, at a budgeted cost of KSh380 billion (US$3.8 billion), borrowed from China Exim Bank. Loan papers between Kenya and China were scheduled for signatures in September 2018, but were deferred until a commercial viability study is conducted on the entire Mombasa\u2013Kisumu railway. ; Kisumu\u2013Malaba Section This section, measuring approximately , takes the SGR line to the town of Malaba, at the international border with Uganda. CCCC, is the contractor for this section as well. The contract price for this section is about US$1.69 billion (KSh169 billion). The price for the Naivasha\u2013Kisumu\u2013Malaba section is US$5.49 billion (KSh549 billion) and includes the laying of railway tracks in both sections, dredging and expansion of the port of Kisumu, and the expansion and modernization of the inland container depot at Embakasi, in Nairobi. ; Lamu\u2013Lokichar-Nakodok Section Map showing the scope of the LAPSSET Project within Kenya This railway line, totaling , is a component of the Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan- Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) development project. Under the LAPSSET plan, this line would be extended to Juba in South Sudan. ; Nairobi\u2013Moyale Section This section also falls under the LAPSSET program. It extends from Nairobi to Moyale, at the international border with Kenya's northern neighbor. It is planned to be extended to Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. ; Naivasha\u2013Lokichar Section This proposed railway link, measuring an estimated , would link the two main standard gauge railway systems in Kenya; the Mombasa\u2013Malaba SGR System and the Lamu\u2013Nakodok SGR System. ==Overview== This 1435 mm (4 ft in) railway line is intended to ease the transfer of goods and passengers between the port of Mombasa and the cities of Nairobi and Kisumu, in Kenya, Kampala in Uganda, Kigali in Rwanda and subsequently to Bujumbura in Burundi, Juba in South Sudan and to Goma and Bunia in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In March 2019, during a state visit to Kenya, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and his host, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, jointly, publicly committed to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Kampala via Malaba. == Standards == The lines are being build according to Chinese standards. * Gauge: Standard gauge * Couplers: Janney AAR * Brakes: Air * Electrification: Overhead catenary 25 kV AC / 50 Hz * Target speed (passenger): * Target speed (freight): * Maximum train load (freight): gross * Designed transport capacity: 20 million tonnes annually * Gross transport capacity: 24.9 million tonnes annually (taking double-track sections into account) * Minimum railway curve radius: ( at difficult locations) * Maximum (ruling) gradient:1.85% (1 in 54) * Length of arrival & departure track at passing loops: 850 m (dual locomotive: 880 m) [resulting max. train length ~800 m] * Maximum vehicle loading gauge height: 5300 mm * Trains run on the: Left * Railway signalling & train protection system: automatic block signaling & ETCS-2 SIL4 * Level crossings: permitted (no full grade separation) * double stack ISO containers = 2 x 2.4m or 2 x 2.9m (unknown) on flat waggons or well wagons. == Criticism == The project alongside many other in Africa under the Belt and Road Initiative have been criticized as an effort by the government of China to debt-trap various nations. ==See also== * Standard-gauge railway * Isaka\u2013Kigali Standard Gauge Railway ==References== ==External links== *East African leaders push for quick deal on SGR As of 26 June 2018. *Kenyan transport developments to fuel economic growth As of 2016.
