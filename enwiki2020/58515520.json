As told to Vogue Runway, \"We probably feel that the greatest privilege in doing our work is that fashion can give a message,\" said Chiuri. \"We think every person coming here is an individual, and we can show that we can improve ourselves by understanding other cultures.\" \"The message,\" added Piccioli, \"is tolerance. And the beauty that comes out of cross-cultural expression.\" As told to WWD, \"After Roma we really felt that we had to let our eyes travel somewhere else,\" said Piccioli before the show, noting that immigration is a defining factor of the times. \"This is the time to see the integration of different cultures, to create new balances between our safe aesthetic and crossing a new culture.\" Hemlines varied from short to long.

As told to Vogue Runway, \"We always think fashion is cultural, not just about delivering clothes,\" said Chiuri. \"We want this show to be about living your moments, feeling each moment uniquely. I really love fashion. This job we do is a good opportunity to describe the time we're in.\" As told to WWD, \"Everybody is speaking about 'see and buy,'\" said Chiuri backstage. \"We think that to be in the moment is more important. You can see and you can feel as well. You can also buy, but it is not true that fashion is only to buy.\" Chiuri and Piccioli emphasized the intangible pricelessness of a \"shared show experience\" as we know it, creating something that sparks emotion in the buyers, the press, and others who devote their time to the process, which compels them to share what they saw and felt. Like Chanel and Saint Laurent, this collection seemed to react against the instantaneous of social media. According to the show notes, Chiuri and Piccioli aimed to \"offer a reply to chaos and to the uncertainty of present times, stepping away from virtuality in order to discover the essence of the contemporary in the unrepeatable physicality of an emotion: in experiences that need to be truly lived, in person, and that no digital instrument can fully reinstate.\" Critics lauded the collection's variety\u2014a belted gold velvet dress layered over a blush turtleneck; a silver fringed sweater atop a gold- fringed skirt; and bad-girl black swans in tulle, leather and gold-star embroideries.

During a preview with WWD, Piccioli talked about the moon as a physical place, \"Where you can find what's lost in the heart, this romantic idea of the moon, the moon as a second chance.\" Piccioli also cited the Renaissance poem, The Frenzy of Orlando, as an inspiration. \"I was very impressed by the part when Orlando loses his mind for love, and his best friend has to go to the moon to recover his sanity,\" Piccioli told British Vogue in a preview at Place Vend\u00f4me. \"It's important, because the moon is the place where you can find what is lost in the heart.

As told to WWD, \"Romanticism,\" said Piccioli. \"It's a strength today, if you're able to be assertive but not aggressive.\" Piccioli said during a preview, \"As an individual, personal, passionate approach to life. I think that is a real strength today, to be able to be fierce, to be strong and gentle at the same time, not to be aggressive but to be assertive. I started this collection with this idea of romanticism as a strength and not as a fragility.\" One of the collection's key design elements included oversized flowers, petal-like folds, embroideries, large graphics, and floral intarsia.

Fabrications include crepe, organza, wool, and georgette. The palette included blush, scarlet, cerulean, red, green, and mustard. \"Sometimes it feels as if women have to renounce their femininity to be stronger. I don't think you need to be authoritarian to be assertive,\" Piccioli argued in a preview with British Vogue the day before. \"We used to think of romanticism as something fragile, something close to love, but for me romanticism means an individual approach to life more passionate, more emotional, more human. Today, romanticism is not a weakness, it's a strength. You can be assertive and not be aggressive. To me, being romantic today means being stronger.\" \"It's not romantic in a sweet way, it's romantic in a bold way,\" Piccioli added. \"Sometimes it's felt as if women had to dress like men to be more powerful. Today is a different moment. People can be exactly how they are. They don't have to renounce the way they are while being assertive. If you take the rules of someone you criticize, it's not good for anyone.\" Bj\u00f6rk's \"Isobel\" provided the runway soundtrack. The collection featured 67 looks.

As told to Vogue, \u201cI was thinking of paradises, about artists\u2019 colonies of the past,\u201d said Piccioli. \u201cThere were reasons why artistic people went off to places like that\u2014so they could live their identities,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, everyone is talking about escapism. But I don\u2019t believe in that\u2014l think everyone should just live their identities in the city, or wherever they are.\u201d The show notes indicated that Piccioli was inspired by the freedom to be oneself. Inspired by the free-spirited, early 20th-century Maverick artists\u2019 colony in Woodstock, New York, Piccioli told Vogue Italia, \u201cToday you have to be free, to be yourself in your place. You don\u2019t have to escape\u2026 beautiful means a diversity of expressions of yourself.\u201d He explained, \u201cI wanted to create pieces that are not ordinary and basic, so with the memory of couture but for contemporary life. Simplicity is not the starting point, but the arrival point. For me, when you solve complexity you arrive at simplicity.\u201d The collection was also influenced by Marrakech as viewed by Yves Saint Laurent and Henri Matisse and Paul Gauguin\u2019s time in Tahiti. With a 60\u2019s bent, the collection opened with a series of black taffeta gowns with balloon sleeves before shifting to feather accessories, dramatic florals, a series of sequined and tulle looks, mini dresses, leather capes, lace pajama sets, and wide-leg suits.

This season, he collaborated with Jun Takahashi to create a series of collaged prints with florals and 19th neoclassical sculptures. He was also inspired by The Movement for the Emancipation for Poetry, which employs guerilla tactics to anonymously post pieces of poetry in public places. As told to Vogue, \u201cI feel that people are looking for emotion and dreams\u2014but not distant dreams,\u201d Piccioli said before his ready-to-wear show. \u201cI want to create a community for Valentino. I mean something different from \u2018lifestyle,\u2019 which is about owning objects. It\u2019s about people who share values.\u201d Piccioli also commissioned Robert Montgomery, Greta Bellamacina, Mustafa The Poet, and Yrsa Daley-Ward to contribute to an anthology of poems, Valentino on Love. The designer continued, \u201cI started this collection thinking about poetry because poetry is similar to couture\u2014it\u2019s something that can belong to both the past and to this time. You can find your own poetry through dress.\u201d The booklets of collected poems were left on each audience member\u2019s seat. One poem excerpt was displayed on an illuminated boardboard at the runway entrance, it read, \u201cThe people you love become ghosts inside of you and like this you keep them alive.\u201d Piccioli also selected lines to be printed or embroidered inside the linings of his designs. The designer incorporated statue prints and poetic verses to avoid a classically romantic translation only through florals with more alternate visuals. One mini dress was embroidered with the words \u201ckiss me in this light while it still lasts,\u201d while another featured the words \u201cI woke up and felt the night leaving. Desire looked strange in the light,\u201d and a black coat read \u201cwrap me, free me, see me.\u201d As told to WWD, \u201cI think of poetry as something that is still beautiful, but it can be contemporary as well,\u201d Piccioli said during a preview, \u201cto keep the values of couture while being contemporary, and making the brand relevant today.\u201d Silhouettes included tunics, tulle dresses, tailored overcoats, hooded capes, and layered pantsuits. Design details featured couture shapes like sloped shoulders, rounded backs, and floor-length skirts as well as scalloped hems, and floral appliques. The palette ranged from pink, yellow, orange, and scarlet to moss, grey, black, and white. \u201cAfter the couture [show], I wanted to move away from safe territory. A change of silhouette,\u201d Piccioli explained during a preview with British Vogue, \u201cI still want to keep the couture values in the house, but more daywear, more street, more inclusive.\u201d Anok Yai opened the runway presentation of 62 looks, while Fran Summers closed it. Adut Akech, Kaia Gerber, Primrose Archer, Elibeidy Dani, Licett Morillo, Mariacarla Boscono, Vittoria Ceretti, Sara Grace Wallerstedt, and Yoon Young Bae also walked the show.

He opened his presentation with a dozen white looks. As told to Vogue, \u201cI wanted to work on something universal, to get back to the essence of shape and volume,\u201d Piccioli said. \u201cSo I worked on the idea of the white shirt, but treating it with a couture sensibility.\u201d During a preview with WWD, Piccioli expounded on his creative process.\u201cDo you know this technique, called grisaille?\u201d The 16th-century painting method is when an image is executed entirely in shades of grey, typically to intimate a statue or relief. \u201cIt consists of taking off in order to give life and shape and to go to the essence.\u201d Bridget Foley of WWD describes Piccioli\u2019s belief that \u201cCouture is about more than exquisitely wrought dresses that take forever to make and cost a fortune; that it is about a set of values of respect, aspiration and inclusivity, not in terms of purchasing power but in telegraphing messages of beauty and open-mindedness.\u201d Despite comparisons to Valentino Garavini\u2019s 1968 All White collection, Piccioli has sought to modernize couture silhouettes by removing stiffness, incorporating more light and volume for fluidity. Silhouettes varied from tunics and shorts to capes and pencil skirts. This season\u2019s palette also included mauve, peach, plum before shifting to more vibrant neon hues in green, orange, and pink, while jungle and floral prints added another dimension.
