    "text": "Marabou () is a term of Haitian origin denoting multiracial admixture. The term, which comes originally from the African Marabouts, describes the offspring of a Haitian person of mixed race: European, African, Ta\u00edno and South Asian. The Marabou label dates to the colonial period of Haiti\u2019s history, meaning the offspring of a mulatto and a griffe person. However, M\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Louis-Elie Moreau de Saint-M\u00e9ry, in his three-volume work on the colony,M\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Louis-Elie Moreau de Saint-M\u00e9ry. Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie francaise de lisle Saint-Domingue. 3 vols.(Philadelphia, 1797). describes Marabous as the product of the union of a black and a quadroon; he says nothing concerning East Indians. The East Indian association with that term is probably due solely to the resemblance between dark-skinned Indians and marabous. Describing Marabous as an ethnic group is a stretch since the term applies to any person of mixed heritage with dark skin and straight or wavy hair. Marabous are no more an ethnic group than grimeaus, mulattoes, quadroons, or octoroons are; these terms merely describe the different phenotypes of mixed-race people. ==See also== * Indo-African * Dougla people ==References== Category:Afro-Caribbean Category:Asian Caribbean Category:Indo-Caribbean Category:Ethnic groups in Haiti Category:Haitian people of Asian descent Category:Multiracial affairs in the Caribbean Category:People of African descent Category:People of Saint- Domingue ",
