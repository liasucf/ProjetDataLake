    "text": "Thomas P. Stossel (September 10, 1941 \u2014 September 29, 2019) was an American physician-researcher, the discoverer of gelsolin, inventor of BioAegis technology estate, and Professor of Medicine Emeritus, Harvard Medical School and American Cancer Society Clinical Research Professor Emeritus. He was Chief Scientific Advisor to BioAegis Therapeutics Inc., a clinical stage biotech company developing a unique non-immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory with potential to address a wide range of infectious, inflammatory and degenerative diseases. He is the holder of more than 50 patents and author of more than 300 papers, studies and reviews. He was also a member of The National Academy of Sciences, The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Medicine, Past Editor-in-Chief of Current Opinion in Hematology and Past Editor of Journal of Clinical Investigation, Past President of the American Society of Hematology and the American Society of Clinical Investigation. ==Education and career== Stossel earned a BA degree summa cum laude from Princeton University and an MD degree cum laude from Harvard Medical School. He completed internship and residency in internal medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and was a staff associate at the National Heart Institute after which he received training in hematology at Boston Children\u2019s and Peter Bent Brigham Hospitals. He was chief of hematology-oncology at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1976 \u2013 1991, head of experimental medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (1991-1998), co- director of hematology (1998-2006) and translational medicine (2011-2014) at that institution. He served on the scientific advisory boards of Biogen, Inc (1997-2002), Dyax, Inc (1991-2001) and has been a director of Velico Medical Inc since 2000. He was president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and of the American Society of Hematology), served on the Lasker Awards\u2019 Jury and as editor in chief of The Journal of Clinical Investigation and of Current Opinion in Hematology. Currently he is a member of the scientific advisory board of The Forsyth Dental Institute and a trustee of the American Council on Science and Health. ==Scientific contributions== Stossel\u2019s research encompassed wide-ranging studies of white blood cell structure function in health and disease but predominantly focused on the molecular mechanism of how cells move and change shape. This research led to the discovery of two important cellular proteins, filamin and gelsolin, that regulate the assembly of actin. Gelsolin is also an abundant extracellular protein that circulates in blood plasma, and Stossel established that it is a component of innate immunity that promotes host antimicrobial activity and prevents the potentially lethal dissemination of inflammation. His company, BioAegis Therapeutics, is conducting clinical trials to assess the potential of plasma gelsolin therapy in a wide variety of infectious, inflammatory and degenerative diseases. ==BioAegis Therapeutics== Tom Stossel was co-founder and chief scientific advisor to BioAegis, a clinical stage company focused on developing therapies for infectious, inflammatory and degenerative diseases through a portfolio built around plasma gelsolin technology and therapeutics. The Company is commercializing recent scientific discoveries that harness the body\u2019s innate defense system to prevent serious outcomes. BioAegis\u2019 platform of opportunities exploits the multifunctional role of Plasma Gelsolin (\u201cpGSN\u201d), a highly conserved, endogenous human protein. pGSN is a master regulator\u2014a key immune modulator that balances the inflammatory process to prevent the spread of excess inflammation while simultaneously enhancing antimicrobial defense. It is a unique anti-inflammatory without immunosuppressive properties.In August 2019, BioAegis successfully completed a Phase 1b/2a Community Acquired Pneumonia clinical. Based on abundant pre- clinical efficacy evidence and the outcome of the clinical trial, BioAegis is now raising funding to launch a phase 2b trial in severe pneumonia designed to demonstrate definitively that plasma gelsolin repletion reduces morbidity and mortality. \"The decades of research on how cells crawl that I undertook, subsidized by peoples' tax money, were very productive, affording me grants, publications and peer recognition. But, it didn't deliver on the motive claimed for doing it -- It hasn\u2019t saved a single life! Today my goal and my passion is to translate the exciting scientific discoveries into products that will save lives and extend quality of life for patients. Treatment of patients suffering from infectious, injurious and degenerative disease with plasma gelsolin treatment promises to deliver the meaningful result of my life\u2019s work.\"' August 2019 ==Publications== Stossel was the author of almost 300 publications, including co-authoring two textbooks, Haematology: A Pathophysiological Approach (1984) and Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology (1997) and the consumer book Pharmaphobia: How the Conflict of Interest Myth Undermines American Medical Innovation (2015). == Policy work== Stossel wrote extensively on policy issues related to medical research and on the relationships between academic researchers, physicians and the medical products industry. His articles and Op Eds have appeared in many publications including The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The Boston Globe. His book, Pharmaphobia. How the Conflict of Interest Myth Undermines American Medical Innovation was published by Rowman and Littlefield in 2015. He was a senior fellow of The Manhattan Institute (2008-2009) and a visiting scholar of the American Enterprise Institute (2014-2017).Stossel has been supportive of industry ethics since 1987, when he joined the scientific advisory board of Biogen. He was also critical of the Affordable Care Act rule known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requiring all companies that sell medical products to the government to disclose on a public website anything they give to physicians that is valued above $10. ==Awards== Kennedy and Class of 1868 Prizes (Princeton University) 1963 Resnick Award (Harvard Medical School) 1967 Dameshek Award (American Society of Hematology 1983 American Cancer Society Research Professorship 1987 Honorary MD (Link\u00f6kping University, Sweden) 1989 E Donnall Thomas Prize (American Society of Hematology) 1993 Elected, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1996) Elected, National Academy of Sciences (1997) Elected, National Academy of Medicine (1998) Lewis M Sherwood Award (Academy of Pharmaceutical Physicians) 2009 McGovern Medal (American Medical Writers Association) 2010 Humanitarian Award (Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital) 2012 ==Charity work== Stossel was a cofounder of Options for Children in Zambia, which provides dental and medical preventive care and other services to the country's major teaching hospital, an orphanage and remote rural villages. He also established Lusaka Zambia, a sickle cell disease clinical and research center in collaboration with physicians at University Teaching Hospital, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia. ==Personal life== Stossel had three children: Scott Hanford Stossel, National Editor of The Atlantic, Sage Stossel, cartoonist and author of On the Loose in Boston, Washington DC, Philadelphia and New York and Tamara Sakala-Stossel, a graduate student at Northeastern University. With his wife, Kerry Maguire DDS, MSPH (a public health dentist who is Vice President for Clinical Operations of the Forsyth Dental Institute, Cambridge, MA) and others, Stossel co-founded a 5013c charity, Options for Children in Zambia that provides voluntary dental and medical care in that Sub-Saharan African country. Stossel\u2019s brother, John is a prominent television personality who espouses libertarian ideas. John characterizes Tom as \"the superstar of the family\" and commented, \"While I partied and played poker, he studied hard, got top grades, and went to Harvard Medical School.\"Stossel, John (2006).
