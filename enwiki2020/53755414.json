    "text": "Byoungho Lee is a South Korean scientist, best known as his works on three- dimensional displays and nanophotonics. He has been on the faculty of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Seoul National University since 1994. He and his research group have published 400+ peer-reviewed international journal papers, 700+ international conference papers, and 20+ books and chapters of books. His accumulated citation reaches over 14,000 and h-index is 62. == Biography & Career == Byoungho Lee received his B.S. (1987), M.S. (1989) from EE, Seoul National University, and Ph.D. degree (1993) from EECS, University of California at Berkeley. In September 1994, he joined the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University as faculty. From 1997 to 2013, he was employed by Samsung as principal engineer. In October 2013, he became Vice President at Ultratech. Then in 2016, he joined SK Hynix as Chief Technology Officer. He is a committee member of OSA, SPIE and IEEE,. He has served as a Director-at-Large of OSA, Chair of the Member and Education Services Council of OSA, and is serving as the Chair of the Fabrication, Design and Instrumentation Technical Division of OSA. He also served as a Vice-President of the Korean Information Display Society and is serving as a Vice-President of the Optical Society of Korea, General Chair of Applied Optics and Photonics China, and Chair of Steering Committee of CLEO Pacific Rim. He is on editorial board of Light: Science & Applications (NPG), Advances in Optics and Photonics (OSA), and Optica (OSA), which are one of the most distinguished journals in optics and photonics. He has received several distinguished academic awards such as Jinbojang Presidential Science Badge of Korea (Apr. 2016), the Academic Award of Seoul National University (Nov. 2013), and the Scientist of the Month Award of Korea (Sep. 2009). == Research interests == Current research interests of Byoungho Lee and his group at Seoul National University cover from system level to device level optical engineering. Along with long-time professions for holography, integral imaging, optical fibers, and plasmonics, now he and his group dedicate to developing advanced head-mounted displays for three-dimensional augmented reality, light field displays, and real-time three-dimensional microscopy. More high functioning optical elements are also researched such as lenses, polarizers, directional couplers, color filters, and spatial light modulators based on metasurfaces and holographic optical elements. == References == == External links == * *http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/ Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Living people Category:1964 births ",
