    "text": "An electronic license plate (also referred to as a digital display license plate) is an identification sign mounted on vehicles that emits a wireless signal used for tracking and digital monitoring services. Various patents including advanced features have been published intending to replace traditional metallic and plastic license plates. The electronic license plate has a complex design that works directly with the vehicular computer system and can communicate with outside sources that may remotely access it for the regulation of vehicle use. == Concept == Inventor Dean L. Naddeo published a patent on June 11, 2002 for the improvement of existing license plates. Naddeo's intention was to create further uses of traditional license plates to maximize their capabilities. Electronic license plates are claimed to be more efficient in lowering crime, lowering cost, and replacing other forms of identification (such as algorithms) through the introduction of electronic monitoring. Electronic license plates would also help increase state revenue, since plates could flash or display a message when the driver has not registered their car or is driving without being insured. == Features == The electronic license plate can offer additional features as compared to the traditional license plate. The plates may function as more than just an identification sign; they may also give information, be used for prepaid services, and provide a more beneficial form of security. === Information === In accordance with privacy regulations, one may reference information from an electronic license plate only for legal purposes. Very specific information can be acquired dynamically via a remote vehicle's plate and this could be as specific as the vehicle's speed and position. Such information is useful for patrolling highways, to reduce speed violations, and to increase safety. Simpler information such as the vehicle identification number (VIN), registration expiration date, proof of insurance, and legal ownership records could be displayed digitally on the plate's screen or be viewed using a remote device. === Prepaid services === Electronic license plates allow certain transportation-related fees and services to be prepaid digitally and updated automatically. Vehicle registration is the primary service that can be renewed instantly. Parking permits can also be associated with the electronic license plate and can be monitored remotely. Toll fees can be prepaid because the license plate can communicate with the global positioning system (GPS) to set up routes, calculate the cost of travel, and send the signal for payment as it passes through a toll booth. === Security === Because they can reduce the chances of a criminal fleeing a scene if a vehicle is in an accident or associated with a crime, electronic license plates can improve security. In these situations, the plate would emit a signal of collision or crime, directly identifying the vehicle's involvement. If not identified at the scene, the license plate holds the information in memory and displays a digital alert. The advanced technology in electronic license plates enables surveillance tools to automatically receive a clear signal with robust information instead of attempting, after the fact, to capture a potentially distorted image. == Design == Similar in size to the traditional license plate, the electronic license plate has a digital display measuring , which is set into a rectangular housing. The display is powered directly from the vehicle's power system and can communicate with the vehicle's on-board computer. The internal components fit inside the housing and are set together in circuits critical for the functions of this technology. === Internal Components === * Central Computer System - processing unit; gathers and sends out information to external sources; sends information for display on the license plate's screen * Memory Chip (key) - integrated circuit; stores information (e.g., vehicle registration, identification numbers, state of issue, expiration date) and restrictions * Identifying Key - tamper-proof hardware; records vehicle identification information for that unique vehicle * Disabling Unit - sensor; if tampering is detected, sends a signal to the central computer system and ignition disrupter to disable the vehicle * Ignition Disrupter - electronic component connected directly to the vehicle's ignition system; does not allow vehicle to be turned on when tampering is detected === External Components === * Display - illuminated screen hardware; enables various digital displays, including license plate number, state of issue, expiration date, etc. == Privacy == Privacy concerns are a major reason electronic license plates are not yet in public use. Since hacking and identity fraud are potential risks, in-depth testing and development of data security is required. In accordance with consumer privacy laws, information from the electronic license plate will be sent out only when the vehicle is involved with any violations or illegal activities. The device is now made with tamper-resistant hardware to prevent information from being acquired by unauthorized parties. The vehicle can be disabled automatically if any tampering is sensed; for example, the unauthorized removal of its electronic license plate will disable the vehicle, thwarting vehicle-identity theft. Tampering to avoid payments or as part of another crime will result in an automatic alert to law enforcement, lowering risk for both the consumer and third parties. == Future == Two states in the US are exploring improvements over traditional license plates. The governor of California has set up California's Electronic License Plate Pilot Program, which will test such alternatives. In 2017, California expected to issue electronic license plates to a limited number of volunteers to test this new technology. The main reason for California's interest in electronic license plates is to reduce taxpayers' expense. Digital plates are projected to reduce $20 million spent by the Department of Motor Vehicles. South Carolina has also shown interest in electronic license plates, and has set up its own pilot programs. https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliewalmsley/2019/01/24/these-customizable- digital-license-plates-will-be-in-8-states-by-year-end/#3c2b46b20d17 ==References== Category:Vehicle registration plates Startup plans digital license plates.
