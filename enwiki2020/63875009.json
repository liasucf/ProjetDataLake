    "text": "Snipex Rhino Hunter is a civilian version of the Snipex M rifle chambered for the .50 BMG caliber. Designed for hitting moving and nonmoving targets, including at long distances (up to 2,000 m). Developed by XADO-Holding Ltd. company (Kharkiv, Ukraine). ==Design== The Snipex Rhino Hunter rifle is designed taking into account all the requirements for weapons for high- precision shooting. It has the bullpup design. The barrel is fully open, has eight right grooves with a 15-inch twist as well as cannelures. Equipped with a muzzle brake. Barrel locking is achieved through a rotating bolt. Thirteen bolt lugs are disposed in three rows and can rotate by 60 degrees, which ensures rigid locking of the barrel. Empty cases are ejected automatically when pulling the bolt back. The case ejection process is slightly delayed, which allows the bullet to leave the barrel with the bolt still fully closed. During this time, the maximum amount of energy is transferred to the bullet. The bolt has a special flag indicator that allows controlling the degree of bolt locking. For ease of use in the dark, the indicator is made of luminophore. The rifle is equipped with a special grip safety, which is located directly above the pistol grip on both sides of the weapon. The rifle features a number of special design solutions with regard to the reduction of recoil and the increase of shooting accuracy. Recoil reduction is achieved due to the inertia recoil system, which includes spring-loaded assemblies and hydraulic or spring shock absorbers. The shock absorbers are built into the upper receiver, which allows shooting with the upper receiver set against any surface. Recoil energy is partially reduced due to the muzzle brake. The rifle is equipped with an original easily foldable bipod designed in such a way that the center of gravity of the rifle is below the bipod mounting point. During shooting, this provides additional stability and precision, which are further improved due to the additional rear support that allows for two-level adjustment to the shooter\u2019s needs. The rifle has a Picatinny rail with 35 MOA gradient, on which various sighting devices can be mounted. ==Specifications== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Caliber || .50 BMG |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Cartridge || 12.7\u00d799 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Mass, kg || 15 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Overall length (assembled), mm || 1250 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Barrel length, mm || 750 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Rifling || 8/15\" |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Safety || flag type |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Picatinny rail || top Mil Standard |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Muzzle velocity, m/s || 780 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Effective range, m || 2000 |} ==History== The rifle was first presented in October 2016 at the XIII International Specialized Exhibition \u201cArms and Security\u201d in Kyiv. ==See also== *Snipex T-Rex *Snipex M ==References== ==External links== * Snipex's page * XADO Snipex \u201cRhino Hunter\u201d and M75 Large Caliber Sniper / Anti-materiel Rifle (Ukraine) * REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF XVI INTERNATIONAL SPECIALIZED EXHIBITION ARMS AND SECURITY \u2011 2019 Category:Hunting rifles Category:Single-shot bolt-action rifles ",
