According to the Archaeological Survey of India plaque at the Mathura Museum, the city is mentioned in the oldest Indian epic, the Ramayana. In the epic, the Ikshwaku prince Shatrughna slays a demon called Lavanasura and claims the land. Afterwards, the place came to be known as Madhuvan as it was thickly wooded, then Madhupura and later Mathura. In the 6th century BCE Mathura became the capital of the Surasena mahajanapada. The city was later ruled by the Maurya empire (4th to 2nd centuries BC) and the Shunga dynasty (2nd century BC). It may have come under the control of Indo-Greeks some time between 180 BCE and 100 BC. It then reverted to local rule before being conquered by the Indo-Scythians during the 1st century BC. Mathuran art and culture reached its zenith under the Kushan dynasty which had Mathura as one of their capitals, the other being Purushapura (Peshawar). The dynasty had kings with the names of Kujula Kadphises, Kanishka, Huvishka and Vasudeva I. Megasthenes, writing in the early 3rd century BC, mentions Mathura as a great city under the name \u039c\u03ad\u03b8\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1 (M\u00e9thora).Megasthenes, fragment 23 \"The Surasenians, an Indian tribe, with two great cities, Methora and Clisobora; the navigable river Iomanes flows through their territory\" quoted in Arrian Indica 8.5. Also \"The river Jomanes (Yamuna) flows through the Palibothri into the Ganges between the towns Methora and Carisobora.\" in FRAGM. LVI. Plin. Hist. Nat. VI. 21. 8-23. 11. The Indo- Scythians (aka Sakas or Shakas) conquered the area of Mathura over Indian kings around 60 BCE. The findings of ancient stone inscriptions in Maghera, a town from Mathura, provide historical artifacts giving more details on this era of Mathura. The opening of the 3 line text of these inscriptions are in Brahmi script and were translated as: \"In the 116th year of the Greek kings...\" The Indo-Scythian satraps of Mathura are sometimes called the \"Northern Satraps\", as opposed to the \"Western Satraps\" ruling in Gujarat and Malwa. After Rajuvula, several successors are known to have ruled as vassals to the Kushans, such as the \"Great Satrap\" Kharapallana and the \"Satrap\" Vanaspara, who are known from an inscription discovered in Sarnath, and dated to the 3rd year of Kanishka (c 130 AD), in which they were paying allegiance to the Kushans.A Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British Museum. Andhras etc.... Rapson, p. ciii. Mathura served as one of the Kushan Empire's two capitals from the first to the third centuries.
