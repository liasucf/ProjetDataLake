    "text": "Shortcut Island is a crescent-shaped island long, with three prominent indentations of the north shore, lying SSE of Gamage Point and Palmer Station along the SW coast of Anvers Island. The suggestive name was given by Palmer Station personnel. The narrow, deep channel separating this island from Anvers Island is a shortcut from the station to the Biscoe Bay area by water. == See also == * Composite Antarctic Gazetteer * List of Antarctic islands south of 60\u00b0 S * SCAR * Territorial claims in Antarctica ==References== == External links == * Category:Islands of the Palmer Archipelago ",
