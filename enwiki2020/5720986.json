The valley is most easily reached via trail heads in the vicinity of the Hetch Hetchy Valley and Lake Eleanor. The valley provides access to many remote alpine lakes throughout the largely untamed wilderness that defines the northern portion of Yosemite National Park and the adjacent Emigrant Wilderness. ==References== Category:Landforms of Yosemite National Park Category:Valleys of Tuolumne County, California Category:Valleys of California ",
