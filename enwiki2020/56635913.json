    "text": "Elizabeth Marian Swaney (born 30 July 1984) is a Hungarian freestyle skier. She competed for Hungary in the 2018 Winter Olympics in the women's halfpipe. She was unable to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics for Venezuela in both skeleton and freestyle skiing, and qualified for the 2018 Winter Olympics in the women's halfpipe, in which she placed last. ==Athletic career== While at University of California, Berkeley Swaney was the coxswain for the men's rowing team. She first thought she would try competing in bobsleigh as a pilot, but was told she was too small to be competitive in the sport. She then turned to skeleton and freestyle skiing, in which she sought to represent Venezuela, her mother's homeland, at the 2014 Winter Olympics. She started skiing for Hungary in 2015, based on her grandparents' country of birth. ===Olympic qualifying=== Swaney qualified for the 2018 Winter Olympics representing Hungary in half-pipe skiing. Beginning in 2013 she attended all the World Cup qualifying events over the two Olympic qualifying years, and the 2017 World Championship in Sierra Nevada, Spain. In order to qualify for the Olympics, athletes needed to place in the top 30 at either a FIS Freestyle Ski World Cup event or FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships, and score a minimum of 50.00 FIS points. Swaney achieved this by attending competitions with fewer than thirty participants, with one event in China having fifteen (in which she placed thirteenth). Thirteen of her top 30 finishes were a result of her showing up, not falling, and recording a score. As a result of Swaney's selection of competitions, she was ranked 34th in her run up to the Olympics. The Olympic quota system also aided in her qualifying. While 24 women were able to compete in half-pipe competition, there are limits on the number of skiers each country could send. The maximum a country could send was twenty- six (with maximums of fourteen men and fourteen women) across all freestyle skiing events. So while the United States had six women ranked within the top 20 in the world in halfpipe skiing, only four were allowed to compete in the Olympics based on the quota system. Between the quota system and injuries, Swaney's ranking of 34 granted her qualification for the Olympics. ===2018 Olympics=== At the 2018 Winter Olympics, Swaney competed in the women's half- pipe, in what was described as a \"perfectly mediocre run\", without falling. She scored 30.00 and 31.40, \"barely attempting a trick\" in either of her two runs. She placed last in the competition, 13.60 points behind Laila Friis- Salling of Denmark, who had fallen in both of her qualifying runs. The incident prompted the Hungarian Olympic Committee (MOB) to reevaluate its selection process, and possible changes to the quota system. While critics called her Olympic performance a \"mockery\", she received support from Canadian gold medalist skier Cassie Sharpe, who said, \"If you are going to put in the time and effort to be here, then you deserve to be here as much as I do.\" Gold medalist Maddie Bowman, and David Wise, a double gold medalist, also defended her. ==Personal life== While studying at University of California, Berkeley (from which she graduated in 2007) she briefly launched a campaign for Governor of California. After graduation she studied for and received a Master's degree at Harvard University. While at Harvard she volunteered as the assistant coach for their Track and Field team. ==See also== *Eddie the Eagle ==References== ==External links== * *Swaney's FIS Page Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Freestyle skiers at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Hungarian female freestyle skiers Category:American female freestyle skiers Category:Olympic freestyle skiers of Hungary Category:Harvard University alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:American people of Hungarian descent ",
