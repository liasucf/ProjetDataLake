As publisher the Oregon Statesman newspaper, he moved the paper to Salem when the territorial capital moved to that city. A Massachusetts native, Bush became the first official printer for the state of Oregon, and his estate is now a city park. ==Early life== Asahel Bush was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, on June 4, 1824.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. His parents, Asahel Bush, Sr. and Sally Noble Bush, were of English descent.
