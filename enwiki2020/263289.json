The Fennomans were members of the most important political movement (Fennomania) in the 19th-century Grand Duchy of Finland, built on the work of the fennophile interests of the 18th and early-19th centuries. ==History== Senator Johan Vilhelm Snellman (1806\u20131881), who also possessed the professions of philosopher, journalist and author, was one of the most influential Fennomans and perhaps one of the most internationally known Finnish statesmen.Snellman, Johan Vilhelm (1806 - 1881)Snellman, the man who inspired Finns to be FinnsPrime Minister Vanhanen at the Celebration of J.V. SnellmanFive Facts That You Didn\u2019t Know About J.V. SnellmanAndrew Nestingen: Crime and Fantasy in Scandinavia: Fiction, Film and Social Change. University of Washington Press, 2008. . After the Crimean War, Fennomans founded the Finnish Party and intensified the language strife, yearning to raise the Finnish language and Finnic culture from peasant status to the position of a national language and a national culture. The opposition, the Svecomans, tried to defend the status of Swedish and the ties to the Germanic world. Although the notion of Fennomans was not as common after the generation of Juho Kusti Paasikivi (born 1870), their ideas have dominated the Finns' understanding of their nation. The mother tongue of many of the first generation of Fennomans, like Johan Vilhelm Snellman, was Swedish. Some of the originally Swedish-speaking Fennomans learned Finnish, and made a point of using it inside and outside the home. Several Fennomans were from Finnish or bilingual homes. Some originally had Swedish surnames, common in Finland at that time. Most of the Fennomans also Finnicized their family names, particularly from the end of the 19th century. In the last years of the 19th century, and in the first years of the 20th, the Fennoman movement split into two political parties: the Old Finnish Party and the Young Finnish Party. == Motto == The Fennoman motto attributed to Adolf Ivar Arwidsson was actually coined by Johan Vilhelm Snellman: \"Svenskar \u00e4ro vi icke, ryssar vilja vi icke bli, l\u00e5t oss allts\u00e5 vara finnar.\" :\"Swedes we are not, :Russians we do not want to become, :therefore Finns we must be.\"Kari Tarkiainen: Adolf Ivar Arwidsson, in Matti Klinge (ed.): Suomen kansallisbiografia 1.
