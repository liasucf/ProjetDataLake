    "text": "G-spot vibrator (ruler is in inches) A G-spot vibrator is a sex toy with female and male varieties. The female version of the device is built to massage the G-spot, described as a bean-shaped area of the vagina. Some women report that it is an erogenous zone which, when stimulated, can lead to strong sexual arousal, powerful orgasms and female ejaculation. The male version of the G-spot vibrator is used for massaging the prostate for both sexual and health-related reasons. ==Female and male versions== ===Female G-spot vibrators=== G-Spot and clitoral vibrator The female type is of phallus-like shape and especially designed for stimulating the G-spot. It first appeared as a response to complaints that vaginal penetration alone, provided by the penis or otherwise, was generally not enough for women to reach orgasm. Women usually need direct clitoral stimulation to orgasm, and stimulating the G-spot area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult to achieve because of the special angle at which penetration must occur. The curved structure of the G-spot vibrator attempts to make stimulating the G-spot area possible without awkward body positioning. The level of vaginal penetration when using a G-spot vibrator depends on the woman because women's physiology is not always the same. The effects of G-spot stimulation when using the penis or a G-spot vibrator may be enhanced by additionally stimulating other erogenous zones on a woman's body, such as the clitoris or vulva as a whole. When using a G-spot vibrator, this may be done by manually stimulating the clitoris, using the vibrator as a clitoral vibrator in addition to a G-spot vibrator, or, if the vibrator is designed for it, by applying it so that it stimulates the head of the clitoris, rest of the vulva and the vagina simultaneously. Almost all female G-spot vibrators feature the phallus shape and have a specially curved end for reaching the anterior (front-most) area of the vagina. But there can be also a group of special or exotic G-spot vibrators intended for G-spot stimulation featuring novelty shapes. Generally, G-spot vibrators have a head slightly larger than the glans penis, and are 1-1.5 in (2\u20133 cm) wide and 5\u20137 in (12.5-17.5 cm) long. ===Male G-Spot vibrators=== 200px The male G-spot vibrator is a specially curved device with a round head which is inserted into the anal canal of a male and stimulates the prostate gland, which is also called the male G-spot; this produces a host of different and intense sexual sensations. Prostate massage is also used for health purposes, as recommended by a health professional. The male G-spot has been used in tantric sex for centuries. Oriental culture has consistently used this practice during massage over the ages. Male G-spot massage is becoming very popular, not only for its health benefits to the prostate gland, but also for the often intense sexual pleasure. Male G-spot vibrators are specially shaped to fit snugly into the rectum, vibrating the anal canal, perineum, and prostate gland to 'milk' the prostate, removing most of the fluid inside this important gland. The male G-spot vibrators normally come without the vibrating function, but this is an added extra in some models for extra sexual pleasure. ==Materials== G-spot vibrators are usually manufactured from materials that provide a pleasant touch: silicone, jelly, rubber, hard-plastic, or any combination of them. ==See also== * Hitachi Magic Wand ==References== Category:Vibrators Category:Massage devices ",
