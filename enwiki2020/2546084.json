    "text": "Malha\u00e7\u00e3o (, Young Hearts in English)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144724/releaseinfo is a Brazilian soap- opera for the teenage audience. The series is being broadcast in several countries by Globo Internacional, including SIC (between 1995 and 2007, airing with the name \"New Wave\") in Portugal and by ABC Spark in Canada. The series has inspired the creation of other series, such as Portuguese channel TVI's Morangos com A\u00e7\u00facar, which is strongly based on the Malha\u00e7\u00e3o format, and Brazilian channel Rede Record's Alta Esta\u00e7\u00e3o. The soap started in 1995, and was set in a fictional Gym Club called Malha\u00e7\u00e3o on Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro. Through the years the location varied slightly. Although the name of the soap remained the same, it was set in the M\u00faltipla Escolha () High School for nine seasons. In the twenty-second season, the location returned to be a gym, the Gael's Martial Arts Gym, placed within the art school Ribalta. The following season brought the school back. From the twenty-fourth season onwards, the setting was changed back to the \"Academia Form\". By the end of the fourteenth season, each episode of Malha\u00e7\u00e3o began with a cold open technique, preceded by a retrospective of the previous episodes, continuing the narrative that follows. This technique was a brand of serial, used since the first season, but was abolished from the beginning of the fifteenth season. Malha\u00e7\u00e3o reached its peak in the eleventh season, with Guilherme Berenguer, Juliana Didone and Marjorie Estiano, with the following season starring Fernanda Vasconcellos, Thiago Rodrigues and Joana Balaguer as the leads, and the ratings decreased from this season on from a high of 42 million viewers per week. Since the program began, a total of 27 seasons have aired; a twenty-eighth season is currently in production. ==Plot== The plot of Malha\u00e7\u00e3o tells stories of the everyday life of teenagers, their daily conflicts, including school, friends, families, and especially their relationships, which occupy the central focus of all the seasons. Every season, a different couple of protagonists occupies the core of the whole story. ==Cast== Similarly to the American soap operas and long-running TV Series, cast and characters change from year to year, but actors and characters who have stayed for long in the soap are, among others, Gustavo Goulart,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144724/combined whose characters Juninho and Bad Boy transcended the seasons with their many troubles throughout the Series in both the 1990s and 2000s, until the present moment. Alexandre Slaviero, whose character, Kiko, has experienced changes (he has gone from student, to bad boy, to steroid addict, to model). And S\u00e9rgio Hondjakoff, whose character, Cabe\u00e7\u00e3o, was in the story from the seventh to twelfth seasons. ===Season list=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !
