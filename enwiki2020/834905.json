    "text": "Subh\u016bti (Pali: Subh\u016bti; ) was one of the ten principal disciples of the Buddha. In Theravada Buddhism he is considered the disciple who was foremost in being \"worthy of gifts\" (Pali: dakkhi\u1e47eyy\u0101na\u1e43) and \"living remote and in peace\" (Pali: ara\u1e47avih\u0101r\u012bna\u1e43 aggo). In Mahayana Buddhism, he is considered foremost in understanding emptiness (Sanskrit: \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101). Subh\u016bti was born into a wealthy family and was a relative of An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika, the Buddha's chief patron. He became a monk after hearing the Buddha teach at the dedication ceremony of Jetavana Monastery. After ordaining Subh\u016bti went into the forest and became an arahant meditating on loving-kindness (Pali: mett\u0101). It is said that due to his mastery of loving-kindness meditation, any gift offered to him bore the greatest merit for the donor, thus earning him the title of foremost in being \"worthy of gifts\". Subh\u016bti is a major figure in Mahayana Buddhism and is the one of the central figures in Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutras. ==In Theravada Buddhism== ===Previous life=== According to the Pali Canon, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Subh\u016bti was born a man named Nanda. Nanda was born into a wealthy family and decided to leave his life behind to become a hermit. The hermitage Nanda was staying at was then visited by Padumuttara Buddha, who had his monk who was skilled in the practice of metta and was foremost in being \"worthy of gifts\" give a thanks-giving (Pali: anumodan\u0101). While all of the other hermits at the hermitage attained arahantship following the teaching, Nanda did not and instead made a resolution to become the disciple foremost in being worthy of gifts of a future Buddha. This wish was fulfilled in this lifetime when he was reborn as Subh\u016bti. ===Biography=== According to the Pali tradition, Subh\u016bti was born into a wealthy merchant family. His father was the wealthy merchant Sumana, and his older brother was An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika, who would later become the Buddha's chief male patron. Texts relate that Subh\u016bti was present at the dedication of Jetavana Monastery, which his older brother An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika had purchased and built for the Buddha. Upon hearing the Buddha teach at the dedication, Subh\u016bti became inspired and ordained as a monk under him. After mastering the monastic rules, he went to live in the forest where he attained arahantship while meditating on the \"absorption of loving- kindness\" (Pali: mett\u0101-jh\u0101na). Subh\u016bti became known for teaching the Dhamma \"without distinction or limitation\", meaning regardless of the listener's potential, and was declared the disciple foremost in \"living remote and in peace\" (Pali: ara\u1e47avih\u0101r\u012bna\u1e43 aggo). During alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for food from laypeople, Subh\u016bti had a habit of developing mett\u0101-jh\u0101na at every household, making it so people who gave him alms received the highest possible merit from the offerings. Because of this, the Buddha also declared him the disciple who was foremost in being worthy of gifts (Pali: dakkhi\u1e47eyy\u0101na\u1e43). In one story, Subh\u016bti visited R\u0101jagaha where King Bimbisara promised to build him a hut. However, the king forgot, thus forcing Subh\u016bti to meditate in the open air. It is said that due to the power of his virtue rain would not fall, and when King Bimbisara found out about the cause of the lack of rain he had a leaf hut constructed for him. According to the text, when Subh\u016bti sat down in the hut, rain began to fall. ==In Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism== Elder Subh\u016bti addresses the Buddha, in the earliest dated printed book (Diamond S\u016btra). Subh\u016bti plays a much larger role in Mahayana Buddhism than in Theravada Buddhism. In Mahayana Buddhist tradition, he is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in understanding \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101, or emptiness, and is a central figure in Mahayana Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 texts. Buddhist scholar Edward Conze describes him as being regarded as the foremost disciple in Mahayana Buddhism. === Early life === According to northern Buddhist texts, Subhuti was born into a wealthy family in \u015ar\u0101vast\u012b and on the day of his birth, all of his family's gold and silver suddenly disappeared, symbolizing that he was born of emptiness, according to Buddhist commentators. The family's gold and silver was then said to have reappeared seven days later. In the northern Buddhist tradition, Subhuti was the nephew of An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika and had a notoriously bad temper. Subh\u016bti was present at the dedication of Jetavana Monastery, which his uncle An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika had purchased and built for the Buddha. Upon hearing the Buddha teach at the dedication, Subh\u016bti became inspired and ordained as a monk under him eventually developing a calm mind and temperament. === Person === Chinese Buddhist commentaries state that when going on alms rounds, Subhuti prioritized collecting alms from the wealthy. This was in contrast to another Buddhist disciple, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, who prioritized collecting alms from the poor. According to Chinese Buddhist monk Hsing Yun, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa prioritized receiving alms from the poor reasoning that poor people needed the merit from alms-giving the most, while Subhuti reasoned that collecting alms from poor people increased their hardship, therefore he collected alms from rich households who would not be burdened by such giving. Chinese Buddhist texts state that the Buddha later rebuked both of them for these practices, telling them that collecting alms should be done indiscriminately. Among the Mah\u0101y\u0101na traditions, Subh\u016bti is perhaps best known as the disciple with whom the Buddha speaks when imparting the Diamond S\u016btra (Sanskrit: Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra, Chinese: \u91d1\u525b\u7d93 or \u91d1\u525b\u822c\u82e5\u7d93), an important teaching within the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 genre. This, along with the Heart S\u016btra (Sanskrit: Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 H\u1e5bdaya, Chinese: \u5fc3\u7d93 or \u822c\u82e5\u5fc3\u7d93), is one of the most well-known s\u016btras among both practitioners and non-practitioners of Buddhism. Subh\u016bti is also responsible for much of the exposition in earlier Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 s\u016btras.*Lopez, Donald S., Jr. The Heart Sutra Explained: Indian and Tibetan Commentaries (1988) State University of New York Press. p. 7 In northern Buddhist texts, when the Buddha descended to Sankassa after spending the rainy season in Tavatimsa heaven, Subhuti, recalling that the Buddha said that one can see him by meditating, remained in meditation rather than going to greet him. Upon arriving the Buddha stated that Subhuti was the first to greet him upon his return, having seen the Buddha's spiritual body before the other disciples greeted his physical body. In the Lotus Sutra (Sanskrit: Saddharma Pu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bka S\u016btra, Chinese: \u6cd5\u83ef(\u82b1)\u7d93 or \u5999\u6cd5\u84ee\u83ef(\u82b1)\u7d93), Chapter 6 (Bestowal of Prophecy), the Buddha bestows prophecies of enlightenment on Subh\u016bti, along with other \u015br\u0101vakas such as Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, Mah\u0101k\u0101ty\u0101yana, and Mah\u0101maudgaly\u0101yana. ==In Zen writings== In Zen Buddhism, Subh\u016bti appears in several koans, such as this one:Reps, Paul and Nyogen Senzaki. Zen Flesh, Zen Bones: A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writings. Rutland, Vermont: Tuttle, 2008. > One day, in a mood of sublime emptiness, Subhuti was resting underneath a > tree when flowers began to fall about him. \"We are praising you for your > discourse on emptiness,\" the gods whispered to Subhuti. \"But I have not > spoken of emptiness,\" replied Subhuti. \"You have not spoken of emptiness, we > have not heard emptiness,\" responded the gods. \"This is the true emptiness.\" > The blossoms showered upon Subhuti as rain. ==Lineage of the Panchen Lamas== In the lineage of the Panchen Lamas of Tibet there were considered to be four \"Indian\" and three Tibetan incarnations of Amitabha Buddha before Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, who is recognised as the first Panchen Lama. The lineage starts with Subhuti.Stein, R. A. Tibetan Civilization, (1972) p. 84. Stanford University Press, Stanford, California. (cloth); .Das, Sarat Chandra. Contributions on the Religion and History of Tibet (1970), pp. 81-103. Manjushri Publishing House, New Delhi. First published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. LI (1882). ==In Chinese literature== A character based on Subh\u016bti appears in the Chinese classical novel Journey to the West, as the teacher of the Monkey King Sun Wukong.Ping Shao, \"Huineng, Subh\u016bti, and Monkey's Religion in 'Xiyou ji'\", The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 65, No. 4 (Nov., 2006), pp. 713-740 The story of Sun Wukong first meeting Subh\u016bti was a play on the Zen story of Huineng meeting Hongren, as told in the Platform S\u016btra of Zen Buddhism. Because of the role that Subh\u016bti plays in the story, his name has remained familiar in Chinese culture.Nan Huaijin. Diamond Sutra Explained. Florham Park: Primordia, 2004.
