For the most part it was written in 1919, and the last two poems in 1922. The first edition was printed in the workshops of the Penitentiary of Lima, in a short print run of 200 copies. Trilce began circulating in October 1922. It consisted of 121 pages of text and 16 of prologue, the latter written by Antenor Orrego, fraternal friend of Vallejo.
