However, a project of this magnitude required a high level of organization, which as yet did not exist. In February 1917, the newspaper El Sur reported: ===Committee Pro-University=== On March 23, 1917, the first official meeting took place to realise two goals of the citizens of Concepci\u00f3n: a clinical hospital and a university. After debate, a committee was named to take charge of the construction of these two projects. The projects were closely related because the hospital would become the base of the new university's medical school. Some notable members of the committee included Enrique Molina Garmendia, Pedro Nolasco, Edmundo Larenas and Virginio G\u00f3mez. ===Foundation=== The commission then presented the documentation to Congress that would officially create the university. These were sent and approved, and on May 14, 1919, Enrique Molina Garmendia founded the university and became its first rector. Nowadays, the university is funded by various organisations belonging to the \"University of Concepci\u00f3n Corporation\". The Lottery is one of the main organisations.
