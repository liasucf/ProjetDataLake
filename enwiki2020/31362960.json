    "text": "Willard Curtis Hyatt (June 15, 1883 \u2013 April 10, 1967) was an All-American basketball player at Yale University in 1904\u201305. He was part of the first group of college basketball players to be honored as such, and it occurred during his senior year. The Helms Athletic Foundation, which began in 1936, retroactively named the All-American teams from 1905 to 1935. Between 1905 and 1929, the Helms All-American teams are considered to be consensus selections. Hyatt lived in New Haven, Connecticut in his later life prior to his death. ==References== # # # # ==External links== * Category:1883 births Category:1967 deaths Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Connecticut Category:Sewanee Tigers football coaches Category:Sportspeople from New Haven, Connecticut Category:Yale Bulldogs men's basketball players ",
