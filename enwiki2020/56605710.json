In Tamatoa's song \"Shiny\" he boasts about how much stronger he is than Maui a demigod by saying there is no way a demigod can beat a decapod. And at the same time he encourages people to look up what decapods are. Decapods have ten legs but Tamatoa has 9 and a half legs which means that they have battled before and Maui ripped of part of one leg which is a major reason that they hate each other and because Maui ripped of part of one leg of Tamatoa Tamatoa stole Maui fish hook and kept it on his shell as if it was a treasure and Tamatoa always fears Maui if he has his fish hook and it works because when Maui has his fish hook he (Maui) can shape shift and he (Maui) is very powerful when he has his fish hook. Tamatoa only cares about his outside appearance so he covered himself with shiny golden stuff and pearls and when his cave gets dark he goes in this neon phase where the stuff he collects glows in the dark and in this phase he looks very scary so when his grandma told him to follow his heart he ate her and said it took 1 week to eat her. And he does not mention this in the movie but he also ate his grandfather. == See also == * Ng\u0101 Tamatoa (\"The Warriors\"), a M\u0101ori activist group Category:Polynesian given names ",
