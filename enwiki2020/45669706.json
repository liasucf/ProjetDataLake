All these sports require special equipment, carry a higher level of risk and require specialised training before they can be undertaken safely. Because mountain sportsmen deliberately go into terrain that is not easily accessible where there are higher risks \u2013 dangers such as avalanches, bad weather, mudflows, rockfalls and icefalls - special measures must be taken to mitigate these risks. This is generally known as risk management. Mountain sports include the following:Bergsport f\u00fcr alle ...Seien Sie aktiv.

These enable beginners to try out the various activities under supervision. The leaders of these tours know the likely risks on their tour routes and accompany the party. Some of these tours are targeted at specific groups, such as guided Alpine crossings for beginners, intermediates, older people or singles.Patrick Merhi: Erfahrungsbericht einer Alpen\u00fcberquerung. Report dated 26 August 2013. Online at guiders.de, retrieved 1 September 2013. These tours have adapted to the changes in travel behaviour of tourists observed in recent years. For example, studies by the University of Berne have found that travellers expect increasingly individualized and flexible travel deals. They are mainly looking for deals that provide varied and intense experiences.Hansruedi M\u00fcller: Der Alpentourismus vor gro\u00dfen Herausforderungen (PDF, 26 kB). Online at fif.unibe.ch, retrieved 1 September 2013. == Mountain sports and conservation == Because mountain sports usually take place in area of relatively unspoilt nature, it is important that participants ensure their activities are carried out in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly way. For this reason guidelines have been prepared by the various mountaineering and alpine clubs. These say, for example, that plants may be photographed but not picked.Naturvertr\u00e4glich unterwegs.

In addition to these measures the Alpine countries and the EU have agreed a framework programme for pan-Alpine policy. The agreement is also known as the Alpine Convention and, in addition to conservation, also covers planning, sustainable development, mountain farming, countryside conservation, mountain forests, tourism, soil protection, energy and transport.Alpenkonvention .
