    "text": "Marsha Stevens-Pino (born Marsha Carter August 20, 1952 in Pomona, California) is a singer, musician, songwriter and recording artist of Christian songs. ==For Those Tears I Died and \"Children of the Day\"== Shortly after professing to become a Christian in 1969 at sixteen years of age, Stevens-Pino wrote \"For Those Tears I Died (Come to the Water)\", a song that was to become widely known and sung in Charismatic Christian churches and youth-groups across the United States. Utilizing her songwriting and singing talents with sister Wendy Carter and friends Peter Jacobs and Russ Stevens, the Contemporary Christian Music group known as \"Children of the Day\" was formed. An entry in the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music states: > If Larry Norman is to be called the father of Christian Rock, then Marsha > Stevens certainly deserves to be known as the mother of contemporary > Christian music ... She was the leader of what is considered to be the > world's first contemporary Christian music group, Children of the Day, and > she has continued as a solo artist to produce albums of worship-oriented and > edifying adult contemporary pop. As such, she remains the progenitor of > what, by 2002, would become the single most popular genre in the > contemporary Christian music market. The album \"Come to the Water\" was recorded with money borrowed from Calvary Chapel, whose minister Chuck Smith supported Stevens-Pino's career. However, her later memoir accounts that he enforced female subordination, including appointing a male bandmate as leader of the band. Smith's mentoring ended when she came out and Smith suggested that she hadn't \"married the right man.\" ==Albums== * Songs of Praise in a Strange Land * Is this the real you? * In Retrospect * The Waiting's Over * The Gift is on the inside * UP (Unashamed Praise)GLBT Christians Compilation CD *I Will Not Behave Like Prey *I Found You *You Called Us Good == Personal life == Stevens-Pino married Russ Stevens in the 1970s and they were together for seven years before divorcing. The judge gave Stevens half the royalties of all her songs, as well as custody of their children. She married Cindy Stevens-Pino in August 2003 and they ran a music ministry training school for LGBT+ Christians at King of Peace MCC in St. Petersburg FL. They currently lead BALM Ministries and attend Pass-a- Grille Community Church. When she came out as a lesbian after her divorce from Stevens, she faced much vitriol from the conservative Christian community. People tore her songs out of hymnals and songbooks and sent her hate mail. == See also == https://www.balmministries.net/home https://www.facebook.com/marsha.stevens == References == * Stowe, David W.
