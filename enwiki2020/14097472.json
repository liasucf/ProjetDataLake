    "text": "De Veaux Woods State Park is a state park located in Niagara County, New York, USA. The park is located off the Robert Moses State Parkway, north of the City of Niagara Falls. It is adjacent to Whirlpool State Park. ==History== The park's land was originally part of the DeVeaux College for Orphans and Destitute Children, for which construction began in 1855. DeVeaux College operated as a trade school for boys ages 8 to 12 and was referred to as a \"military school\" for much of its existence. The school closed in 1972, and the property was used as dormitories for Niagara University between 1978 and 1983. Many of the property's buildings were demolished in 1994, and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation acquired the property in 2001. ==Park description== The park has baseball diamonds, a playground, an ice skating rink, a nature trail, seasonal restrooms, and permits biking. A small area of old growth forest is present inside the park. The park is also the home of the Niagara Regional Interpretive Programs, and Engineering staff. The park is open year-round for daytime activities. ==See also== * List of New York state parks ==References== ==External links== * New York State Parks: De Veaux Woods State Park * Flora of De Veaux Woods State Park Category:State parks of New York (state) Category:Parks in Niagara County, New York ",
