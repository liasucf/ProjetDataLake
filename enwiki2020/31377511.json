    "text": "Open Asset Import Library (Assimp) is a cross-platform 3D model import library which aims to provide a common application programming interface (API) for different 3D asset file formats. Written in C++, it offers interfaces for both C and C++. Bindings to other languages (e.g., BlitzMax, C#, Python) are developed as part of the project or are available elsewhere.http://assimp.org/index.php/docs Given the importance and the benefits of Assimp, a pure Java (/Kotlin) port is being developed here. The imported data is provided in a straightforward, hierarchical data structure. Configurable post processing steps (i.e., normal and tangent generation, various optimizations) augment the feature set.http://assimp.org/index.php/features Assimp currently supports 57 different file formats for reading, including COLLADA (.dae), 3DS, DirectX X, Wavefront OBJ and Blender 3D (.blend).http://assimp.org/index.php/features As of Version 3.0 Assimp also provides export functionality for some file formats.http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_export.html ==Projects using Assimp== Several open source projects use Assimp, such as Godothttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.txt, MonoGamehttps://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame.Dependencies/tree/master/assimp and Urho3D. ==See also== * OpenCTM * MeshLab == References == == External links == * Official project page Category:C++ libraries Category:Graphics libraries Category:Software using the BSD license ",
