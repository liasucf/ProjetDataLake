The film stars Patricia Ellis, Cesar Romero, Buster Crabbe, William Frawley, Andy Devine and George Barbier. The film was released on April 27, 1935, by Paramount Pictures. ==Plot== A racketeer known as \"Sunshine Joe\" specializes in ticket scalping. His gang of colorfully nicknamed thugs includes Liverlips, Sam the Gonoph and Bennie South Street, as well as \"Georgie the Chaser,\" who was dubbed that way because of his penchant for chasing after women. On a train, Georgie happens upon Clarice Van Cleve, an heiress who loves to fall in love, particularly with men in uniform. This has created many a headache for her father, who already has seen Clarice elope three times with military types, each tryst ending badly. Mr. Van Cleve diverts his daughter to a New Jersey health resort, where he introduces her to his friend Mr. Wilmot and handsome son Hector, in the hope that Clarice and Hector will hit it off. Georgie the gigolo still has Clarice's eye, however, pretending to be a combat pilot. But when Clarice turns up and begins acting like a homemaker, driving him crazy, Georgie, learning she's been disinherited by her dad, leaves by claiming he's needed by \"the King\" to fly a mission. Sunshine Joe runs off with money earned from scalped tickets to the Harvard-Yale college football game. It so happens Hector is a member of the Yale team, so all of Joe's goons go to New Haven, Connecticut for the game and place bets. Shocked to find Hector is a benchwarmer, they pull a gun on the coach, demanding Hector be permitted to play. He kicks a field goal to win the game, then ends up, a man in another kind of uniform, in the arms of Clarice. == Cast == *Patricia Ellis as Clarice Van Cleve *Cesar Romero as Gigolo Georgie *Buster Crabbe as Hector Wilmot *William Frawley as Sunshine Joe *Andy Devine as Liverlips *George Barbier as Mr. Van Cleve *Warren Hymer as Sam The Gonoph *George E.
