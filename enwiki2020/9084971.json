For many years, it was a World War I veterans hospital. The first 47 patients arrived in the summer of 1923 from the \"Hospital for Returned Soldiers\" (later known as Michener Centre) in Red Deer. All 47 patients were veterans of World War I who were mostly suffering from \"shell shock,\" now known as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The first physician caring for these veterans was Captain Dr. David L. Dick. He served with the Royal Army Medical Corps 142nd Field Ambulance in 1915-16 on the Western Front. In 1917, he was transferred to the Canadian Expeditionary Force and became Resident Medical Officer for the Strathcona Military Hospital, Edmonton. The Grand Opening was a significant event as these were veterans and the official hostess of the occasion was Bridget Velma Henderson, niece of Premier Herbert Greenfield, who later married WW I flying ace Stanley A. Puffer of the Royal Flying Corps. At the Grand Opening, luminaries in attendance included: **Dick Reid. the Minister of Health **Archie Matheson, the MLA from Vegreville **John Edward Brownlee, the Attorney-General ===Recent History=== In August 2009 Alberta Health Services announced that it will be closing 106 of the 410 beds at the hospital. The AUPE has been strongly opposed to the closures and have staged many protests and have made several television commercials at an attempt to gain support. ==Buildings== There are 45 buildings at AHE spread over .Abercrombie, Sheila.
