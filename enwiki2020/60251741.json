    "text": "Ra\u00fal Alberto Lozano (born 2 September 1997) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a defender for Quilmes. ==Career== Lozano started his career with Quilmes. He was picked for his senior debut in May 2017 against Gimnasia y Esgrima in the Copa Argentina, with the defender playing the full duration of a penalty shoot-out defeat. In the succeeding June, Lozano was an unused substitute on two occasions in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n but never made it on as Quilmes suffered relegation in 2016\u201317. His professional bow eventually arrived in the 2018\u201319 Primera B Nacional on 27 August 2018 versus Atl\u00e9tico de Rafaela, as Lozano started and finished the opening seventeen matches of Quilmes' season; only missing game eighteen due to suspension. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Quilmes |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2018\u201319 |17||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||17||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !17!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!18!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Province Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Quilmes footballers ",
