    "text": "is a 2003 Japanese film based on the novel of the same name by Yusuke Kishi, directed and co-written by Yukio Ninagawa, and starring Kazunari Ninomiya and Aya Matsuura. The film portrays Ninomiya playing Sh\u016bichi, a high school student finding a way to get rid of his stepfather who had returned home and begins to terrorize his family. Ao no Hon\u014d was released in Japan on March 15, 2003 and was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in France on May 15, 2003. ==Plot== Sh\u016bichi Kushimori (Kazunari Ninomiya) lives with this mother Y\u016bko (Kumiko Akiyoshi) and younger stepsister Haruka (Anne Suzuki). One day, his estranged stepfather Ry\u016bji Sone (Kansai Yamamoto) suddenly returns home and begins to freeload off his family. After Sh\u016bichi encounters what appeared to be Sone making sexual advances towards Haruka one night, he tries to get rid of Sone. However, Sh\u016bichi discovers that it is impossible to do so legally as Haruka is his daughter, and Y\u016bko asks him to endure it until Haruka turns fifteen and can choose Y\u016bko as her legal guardian. After thorough research and experimentation on electrocution, he carries out his plan and kills his stepfather. The police declares that Sone had died of natural causes, especially as Sh\u016bichi was supposed to be in school at that time. His alibi checks out because his classmates saw him leave with a half-finished painting and return with it finished at the end of class. Later, at home, Haruka reveals to him that Sone had been dying of cancer. Sh\u016bichi continues his everyday life and begins seeing classmate Noriko Fukuhara (Aya Matsuura). One day, Takuya Ishioka (Yosuke Kawamura), a classmate who skips school and causes trouble, goes to see him at the convenience store where he works. Ishioka, who figures out what Sh\u016bichi did and has the bag of the things he used to kill Sone, threatens to tell the police if Sh\u016bichi does not get him 300,000 yen (approx. $3,000 USD) in a week. Although Sh\u016bichi regrets his actions, in order to keep Ishioka quiet, he fools Ishioka into staging a robbery at his workplace with a fake knife. Sh\u016bichi stabs him, making it look like an act of self-defense on the security cameras. However, police officer Masashi Kano (Baijaku Nakamura), who also met Sh\u016bichi at the time of Sone's murder, finds flaws in Sh\u016bichi's claims and actions. While seeing Noriko home at the train station, Sh\u016bichi admits to her that he is a murderer. The police manages to uncover the truth of what really happened to Sone and Ishioka, but Kano lets Sh\u016bichi go home on the basis that he promises to willingly turn himself in the next day. After having breakfast as usual with his family, he visits Noriko at school before class starts. She confirms that she lied for him and will continue to lie for him in court. Sh\u016bichi leaves her a tape recording before he leaves. Then he commits suicide, steering his bike into the direct path of a bus. In his tape recording, Sh\u016bichi talks about his favorite things. Noriko stops coloring her drawing of a future Sh\u016bichi blue to listen. ==Cast== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" ! Actor !!
