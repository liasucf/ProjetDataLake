    "text": "Irish-Scots are people in Scotland who are of immediate or traceably distinct Irish ancestry. Although there has been migration from Ireland (especially Ulster) to Scotland for millennia permanently changing the historic landscape of Northern Britain forever, Irish migration to Scotland increased in the nineteenth century, and was highest following the Great Famine. In this period, the Irish typically settled in cities and industrial areas. In the 2011 UK census, 1% of the population in Scotland identified their ethnicity as being 'White - Irish'.Scotland's Census Results However, with centuries of heavy Irish immigration to Scotland, it is generally believed over 1.5 million people may have some Irish blood, even if very distantly. The same census states the number of Catholics in Scotland as 15.9% of the population, of whom many have an Irish background.

The term Irish-Scots should not be confused with Ulster-Scots (sometimes known as Scots-Irish), a term used to denote those in the Irish province of Ulster who are descended from Lowland Scots who settled there in large numbers during the Ulster Plantation and subsequently. ==Background== Attitudes to the waves of immigration from Ireland to Scotland were mixed, as evidenced by the following quotations: Difficulties also arose due to differences between the largely Catholic immigrants and the predominantly Protestant native Scots population. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, before the Irish began arriving in large numbers it was reported that, in Glasgow, there were only thirty-nine Catholics, but forty-three anti-Catholic clubs (dead link see ). In the UK census of 2001, the new category \"Irish\" was added to the list of white ethnic background. In Scotland, results showed that 49,428 (0.98%), fewer than 1% of the population, self-described as being of Irish background. The Irish-Scots were instrumental in the formation of Hibernian F.C. in Edinburgh in 1875. There followed in 1888 in Glasgow, Celtic Football Club, and later Dundee United F.C. (originally known as Dundee Hibernian), as well as numerous smaller teams. These football teams were originally formed to provide recreational facilities for the Irish immigrants. ==Scots and Irish== The terms Scots and Irish, while they have a settled meaning today, are not always readily distinguished. Sellar & Yeatman's spoof history 1066 and All That highlighted the confusion that these words can cause when used to refer to the past : ==See also== * The Irish Scots and the Scotch-Irish \u2013 John C.
