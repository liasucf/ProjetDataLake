    "text": "In the United States, the length of a nail is designated by its penny size, written with a number and the abbreviation d for penny; for example, 10d for a ten-penny nail. A larger number indicates a longer nail, shown in the table below. Nails under inch, often called brads, are sold mostly in small packages with only a length designation or with length and wire gauge designations; for example, 1\u2033 18 ga. or \u2033 16 ga. Penny sizes originally referred to the price for a hundred (100) or long hundred (120) nails in England in the 15th century: the larger the nail, the higher the cost per long hundred. Cited at sizes.com with a quote from 1507. The system remained in use in England into the 20th century, but is obsolete there today. Nails are still designated in penny sizes in the United States. In Canada, nails are specified by the type and length and are still manufactured to Imperial dimensions. Nail diameter is specified by gauge number (British Imperial Standard). The gauge is the same as the wire diameter used in the manufacture of the nail.https://cwc.ca/how- to-build-with-wood/wood-products/connections/nails/ The d is an abbreviation for denarius, a Roman coin similar to a penny; this was the abbreviation for the monetary penny in the United Kingdom before decimalisation. {| class=\"wikitable\" !
