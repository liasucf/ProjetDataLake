    "text": "Braised duck, Teochew style Chinese angelica In cooking and gastronomy, duck or duckling is the meat of several species of bird in the family Anatidae, found in both fresh and salt water. Duck is eaten in many cuisines around the world. It is a high-fat, high-protein meat rich in iron. Duckling nominally comes from a juvenile animal, but may be simply a menu name. One species of freshwater duck, the mallard, has been domesticated and is a common livestock bird in many cultures. The Pekin duck is another livestock species of importance, particularly in North America. Magret refers specifically to the breast of a mulard or Muscovy (or Barbary) duck that has been force fed to produce foie gras. == Duck meat == Duck meat is derived primarily from the breasts and legs of ducks. Like all poultry meat, the meat is categorically classed as white meat despite the colour being slightly darker than normal poultry. The meat of the legs is darker and somewhat fattier than the meat of the breasts, although the breast meat is darker than the breast meat of a chicken or a turkey. Being waterfowl, ducks have a layer of heat-insulating subcutaneous fat between the skin and the meat. Duck breast topped with foie gras De-boned duck breast can be grilled like steak, usually leaving the skin and fat on. Internal organs such as heart and kidneys may also be eaten; the liver in particular is often used as a substitute for goose liver in foie gras. Duck is particularly predominant in the Chinese cuisine\u2014a popular dish is Peking duck, which is made from the Pekin duck. Duck meat is commonly eaten with scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce wrapped in a small spring pancake made of flour and water or a soft, risen bun known as gua bao. The Pekin duck is also the most common duck meat consumed in the United States, and according to the USDA, nearly 26 million ducks were eaten in the U.S. in 2004. Because most commercially raised Pekins come from Long Island, New York, Pekins are also sometimes called \"Long Island\" ducks, despite being of Chinese origin. Some specialty breeds have become more popular in recent years, notably the Muscovy duck, and the mulard duck (a sterile hybrid of Pekins and Muscovies). Unlike most other domesticated ducks, Muscovy ducks are not descended from mallards. == Nutrition == Duck meat is very high in cholesterol and fat, particularly saturated fat. It is also very high in protein and iron and is generally nutritious and filling for those who can tolerate the high fat content. Slow cooking using methods of cooking which allow drainage of the grease can partially alleviate the high fat content, though duck meat will always be a high-fat food. == Duck dishes == Duck rice Peking duck Duck is used in a variety of dishes around the world, most of which involve roasting for at least part of the cooking process to aid in crisping the skin. Some dishes use parts of the duck as an ingredient along with other ingredients. Notable duck dishes include: * Ballotine * Balut is a developing bird embryo boiled and eaten from the shell.

In particular, PCBs may pose a health risk for those who eat wild duck frequently. == References == == Further reading == * Rombauer, Irma S., et al.
