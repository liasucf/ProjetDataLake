Venice, 1509 Albrecht D\u00fcrer's 1514 engraving Melencolia, with a truncated triangular trapezohedron and a magic square Rencontre dans la porte tournante by Man Ray, 1922, with helix Four- dimensional geometry in Painting 2006-7 by Tony Robbin Quintrino by Bathsheba Grossman, 2007, a sculpture with dodecahedral symmetry Heart by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh, 2014, using a family of trigonometric equations This is a list of artists who actively explored mathematics in their artworks. Art forms practised by these artists include painting, sculpture, architecture, textiles and origami. Some artists such as Piero della Francesca and Luca Pacioli went so far as to write books on mathematics in art. Della Francesca wrote books on solid geometry and the emerging field of perspective, including De Prospectiva Pingendi (On Perspective for Painting), Trattato d\u2019Abaco (Abacus Treatise), and De corporibus regularibus (Regular Solids),Piero della Francesca, De Prospectiva Pingendi, ed. G. Nicco Fasola, 2 vols., Florence (1942).Piero della Francesca, Trattato d'Abaco, ed. G. Arrighi, Pisa (1970).Piero della Francesca, L'opera \"De corporibus regularibus\" di Pietro Franceschi detto della Francesca usurpata da Fra Luca Pacioli, ed. G. Mancini, Rome, (1916). while Pacioli wrote De divina proportione (On Divine Proportion), with illustrations by Leonardo da Vinci, at the end of the fifteenth century. Merely making accepted use of some aspect of mathematics such as perspective does not qualify an artist for admission to this list. The term \"fine art\" is used conventionally to cover the output of artists who produce a combination of paintings, drawings and sculptures. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Mathematical artists !
