It was written by Florence Welch and Isabella Summers, and produced by Markus Dravs. The song was released on 20 November 2015 as the album's fourth and final single. ==Critical reception== Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone wrote that \"Delilah\" begins sparsely with Welch's multi-tracked call-and-response vocals sailing atop a simple piano and simmering synths. ==Music video== The music video for \"Delilah\" was directed by Vincent Haycock and premiered on 21 October 2015 as part of the video series The Odyssey. Filmed in Los Angeles, the video opens with an intense monologue from an old man. Florence Welch is then seen roaming through a \"maze of motel rooms \u2013 dancing, writhing intensely, cutting a man's hair and encountering a horrifying goblin.\" At the end of the video, Welch \"triumphantly rides through the streets of Los Angeles [...] as a hat tip to her newfound freedom.\" In an interview with Rookie, Haycock said of the video, \"The cutting of the hair was a direct reference to the biblical [story of] Delilah, but then it veered off into something more personal to Florence. Since this song was always planned as being the end of the series, we decided to make it about [her] returning to her true self, killing off the ego version of herself, and finding her way home again.\" ==Track listings== *Digital download \u2013 Galantis Remix #\"Delilah\" (Galantis Remix) \u2013 5:37 #\"Delilah\" (Galantis Remix / Radio Edit) \u2013 4:11 *Limited-edition 12-inch single (Record Store Day exclusive) :A1. \"Delilah\" :A2. \"Delilah\" (Demo) :B. \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" (live) ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful. ===Recording=== * Engineered at The Pool (London) * Mixed at Toast Studios (London) * Mastered at Sterling Sound (New York City) ===Personnel=== Florence and the Machine * Florence Welch \u2013 vocals, backing vocals * Chris Hayden \u2013 drums, percussion * Mark Saunders \u2013 bass Additional personnel * Markus Dravs \u2013 production * Robin Baynton \u2013 engineering, organ, piano * Jonathan Sagis \u2013 engineering assistance * Iain Berryman \u2013 engineering assistance * Leo Abrahams \u2013 electric guitar * Pete Prokopiw \u2013 programming * Craig Silvey \u2013 mixing * Eduardo de la Paz \u2013 mixing assistance * Ted Jensen \u2013 mastering ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015\u201316) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | 102 |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom | 20 November 2015 | Contemporary hit radio | rowspan=\"2\"| Island | align=\"center\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | 27 November 2015 | Digital download \u2013 Galantis Remix | align=\"center\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| United States | 19 January 2016 | Alternative radio | rowspan=\"2\"| Republic | align=\"center\"| |- | 16 April 2016 | 12-inch single (Record Store Day exclusive) | align=\"center\"| |} ==References== Category:2015 singles Category:2015 songs Category:Florence and the Machine songs Category:Island Records singles Category:Republic Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Markus Dravs Category:Songs written by Florence Welch ",
