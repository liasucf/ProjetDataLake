    "text": "Lt. Cmdr. Maurice Jester Maurice David Jester (May 13, 1889 \u2013 August 31, 1957) was a notable member of the United States Coast Guard. Jester enlisted in the Coast Guard as a surfman in 1917. By 1936 he had risen to the rank of Chief Boatswain. In December 1941, after the United States entered World War II, Jester was given a Lieutenant's commission, and he was given command of the USCGC Icarus (WPC-110). In 1942 Jester led the Icarus during the sinking of the German U-boat U-352, successfully rescuing surviving German crew. U-352 was larger and better armed than the Icarus. Jester received a Navy Cross and promotion to lieutenant commander for his leadership. An issue of Life magazine featured an image of Jester on its cover. In late 2017 it was announced that a new Sentinel-class fast response cutter USCGC Maurice Jester (WPC-1152) would bear his name. ==References== Category:1889 births Category:1957 deaths Category:United States Coast Guard officers Category:United States Coast Guard personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States) Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery ",
