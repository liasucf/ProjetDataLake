    "text": "Ronald D. Rotunda (February 14, 1945 \u2013 March 14, 2018) was a U.S. legal scholar and professor of law at Chapman University School of Law. Rotunda's first area of primary expertise is United States Constitutional law, and is the author of an influential 6-volume legal treatise on Constitutional Law. His other area of primary expertise is Legal Ethics, often called Professional Responsibility. He has also published an influential treatise on Legal Ethics, co-published by West-Thomson Reuters, ABA. He was also a senior fellow, in 2000, at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C. In 1963, when Rotunda was 18 years old, he received a scholarship to attend Harvard University. Professor Rotunda later received a J.D. from Harvard Law School. Rotunda married Marcia Mainland in February 1969. She was formerly an attorney in the office of University Counsel during his time at Illinois. In 1966, shortly after his conviction, Albert DeSalvo, The Boston Strangler, was one of Rotunda's students in a law course for prisoners. In an article about this experience Rotunda described DeSalvo as charming, helpful and well-groomed, in contrast to every other student at the prison. Rotunda was Albert E. Jenner, Jr. Professor of Law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He was employed there for twenty-five years. He served as an advisor to Ken Starr during Starr's tenure as special prosecutor during the Clinton Administration. Previously, he had served on the investigative team during the Watergate scandal. As an advisor to the Independent Counsel in 1998, Rotunda was asked for an opinion on \"whether a sitting President is subject to indictment.\" In a 56-page response released by the National Archives following a Freedom of Information Act request by the New York Times, Rotunda concluded, \"It is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting President for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the President's official duties. In this country, no one, even President Clinton, is above the law.\" He was married to Kyndra Rotunda (and divorced in 2014). The Rotundas were on faculty at George Mason University School of Law until departing in 2008 for Chapman University. Professor Rotunda died on March 14, 2018. Chapman University Law School will name a chair in his honor. ==Publications== *The Politics of Language: Liberalism as Word and Symbol Intro. by Daniel Schorr.
