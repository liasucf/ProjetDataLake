In 2007, Iraq asked Iran to return some of the scores of Iraqi fighter plans that flew there ahead of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. And as of 2014, Iran was receptive to the demands and was working on refurbishing an unspecified number of jets. In late 2014, Iran gave some of the impounded former Iraqi military aircraft back to Iraq. == Combat types == === Air superiority fighters === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"text- align: left;\"|Aircraft ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Origin ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Type ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Versions ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Number ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Years ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Notes |- | || US|| Interceptor || F-14A || 40\u201343 || 1974\u2013present || 80 examples ordered, 79 were originally delivered; the only plane to use the Phoenix missile. 40 to 43 in inventory.
