Kvits\u00f8y-Tower was a 117.5 metres high, free standing centre-fed half-wave antenna constructed of a grounded steel framework. Horizontal crossbars are located at its top and at a height of 67.5 metres above ground to support the cables for a medium wave aerial, which are strung parallel to the tower. The vertical cables hanging from the lower crossbar are fixed to the ground with anchors. The Norwegian public broadcaster NRK switched off the Kvits\u00f8y transmitter at 22:00 UTC on Friday June 30, 2006. For years, the station had been heard fairly reliably at night by DX'ers along the Atlantic Coast of North America making it one of the easiest European stations to hear. The mast was demolished on 31st May 2012. == See also == * List of towers ==References== == External links == * * *Pages by designer of the antenna Bernd Waniewski *RADIO NORWAY INTERNATIONAL 1938-2003 (In Norwegian) *Bernt Erfjord: Norske Kringkastingssendere(Vintage Norwegian AM Transmitters)(In Norwegian) *Oversikt over Norske Kringkastere utarbeidet ved samarbeid mellom DX-Listeners' Club (DXLC) og Just N.
