Hunter (August 1, 1968 \u2013 August 28, 2012) was an American neurobiologist and the original author of Matplotlib.Hunter, John D. \"Matplotlib: A 2D graphics environment.\" Computing in science and engineering 9.3 (2007): 90-95. ==Biography== He was brought up in Dyersburg, Tennessee. He graduated from McCallie High School. He studied initially at Princeton University, later he obtained a Ph.D. in neurobiology from the University of Chicago in 2004. In 2005, he joined TradeLink Securities as a Quantitative Analyst. Later, he was one of the founding directors of NumFOCUS Foundation. NumFOCUS First Minutes of Meeting ==Matplotlib== Matplotlib was originally conceived to visualize electrocorticography (ECoG) data of epilepsy patients during post-doctoral research in neurobiology. The open-source tool emerged as the most widely used plotting library for the Python programming language, and a core component of the scientific Python stack, along with Numpy, Scipy and IPython.Sheppard, K. (2014). Introduction to Python for econometrics, statistics and data analysis. Selfpublished, University of Oxford, version, 2. Matplotlib was used for data visualization during landing of the Phoenix spacecraft in 2008 as well as for the creation of the first image of a black hole. ==Personal life== He was diagnosed with malignant colon cancer and died from cancer treatment complications on August 28, 2012. His memorial service was held at the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Chapel (which was also the location of his Ph.D. graduation) on October 1, 2012.
