She was buried in Hamilton, Ontario. After her death, Kate's bereaved husband and young children were sued by three of her four sisters; Margaret, Mary, and Susan. They contested the terms of their sister's will, based on her status as a married woman. Adam Crooks, then a Liberal cabinet member in the provincial legislature, successfully put forward the Married Women\u2019s Real Estate Act (1873), under which married women could hold and dispose of property in their own right. The Act passed into law in Ontario on March 29, 1873; two years after his cousin's death. In a 1997 book, Dr. Lori Chambers observed that the Act was a \"remedial measure intended for women's protection, not their emancipation.\" However, the Act \"allowed some women scope to participate actively in the burgeoning economy of the province.\"Chambers, Lori (1997). Married Women and the Law of Property in Victorian Ontario. University of Toronto Press. p. 104. . . Prior to the Act's passage into law, The Toronto Mail warned of the \"dangers\" posed by the Act; adding, \"We have now only to hope that the good sense of the married women of Ontario will neutralize the Quixotic zeal of Mr. Crooks.\" == Legacy == A specimen of Sabatia angularis, collected in 1865 by Miss Crooks.
