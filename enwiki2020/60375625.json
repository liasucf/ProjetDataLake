    "text": "In Greek mythology, Pterelaus (/\u02cct\u025br\u0259\u02c8le\u026a\u0259s/; Ancient Greek: \u03a0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03c2) was a king of the Taphians. == Family == Pterelaus was the son of Taphius and thus, the grandson of the first PterelausHypothesis to The Shield of Heracles, 4. 5. Another account makes Taphius the son of Poseidon and Hippotho\u00eb, making him grandson of them and a descendant of the Argive hero Perseus.Pseudo- Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.4.5 He was the father of several sons (Chromius, Tyrannus, Antiochus, Chersidamas, Mestor, Everes) and a daughter named Comaetho. Tzetzes on Lycophron, 932 == Mythology == The god Poseidon had caused to grow upon his head a single magic golden hair which, so long as it continued to grow there, made him immortal and unconquerable. Pterelaus and his kin raided the cattle of the King of Mycenae; but he was killed in a retaliatory expedition led by Amphitryon (later the stepfather of Heracles) after being betrayed by Comaetho, who had fallen in love with Amphitryon and pulled out the golden hair from her father's head, rendering him defenceless. The vanquished Taphian realm was handed over to Amphitryon's allies, including Cephalus.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.4.6\u20137 Cephalus ruled over many islands, and his followers became known as Cephallenians.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 1.37.6 Odysseus was a descendant of Cephalus by the following lineage: Cephalus - Arcesius - La\u00ebrtes - Odysseus. == Notes == == References == * Pausanias, Description of Greece with an English Translation by W.H.S.
