They are currently members of the Northern League Division One, (having been robbed of promotion as champions by the FA in 2019-20 )having been promoted from Division Two in the 2016\u201317 season. The club currently play at Bishopton Road West, which has an overall capacity of 1,800, including 200 available seats. They are managed by former player Michael Dunwell, who retired from playing in 2014. The club are notable for reaching the final of the FA Vase in the 2017\u201318 season, where they finished as runners-up, after being defeated 1\u20130 by champions Thatcham Town. Their previous success includes four consecutive Wearside Football League titles between 2012 and 2016, two consecutive Wearside League Cup titles between 2014 and 2016, two consecutive Monkwearmouth Charity Cup titles between 2014 and 2016, as well as winning the Shipowners Charity Cup in the 2014\u201315 season. Their club badge, which includes their motto, \"Fortitudo et Spes\" (Italian for \"Strength and Hope\"), is navy and yellow, which is to present their traditional colours. The historic club nickname, \"the Anchors\", is taken from the Stockton coat of arms, which presents the town's shipbuilding history during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. ==History== The club was initially formed in 1979 as Hartburn Juniors, entering a 5-a-side league in Middlesbrough to give youngsters an opportunity to play organised football. The club changed to their name to Stockton Town in 2003. For the 2009\u201310 season, a senior team was entered into the Teesside League Division Two and finished in fourth place in their first season. In the summer of 2010, the club applied for membership to the Wearside League and were accepted for the 2010\u201311 season where they finished in tenth place. In the 2011\u201312 season, the club finished third in the league and lost in the final of the League Cup. The club won their first league title in the 2012\u201313 season, and repeated the feat in their following league campaign, finishing the season with a league record of 104 points. At the end of the 2014\u201315 season, the club applied for qualification to the Northern League Division Two. However, despite winning the league title for a third time, their application was withdrawn due to legal issues. In the 2015\u201316 season, the club won their fourth consecutive league title to gain promotion to Northern League. The following season, the club played their first ever FA Vase tie, beating Eccleshill United 2\u20130, before gaining their most famous victory to date, beating four time winners, Whitley Bay, 2\u20130 in the next round. On 14 April, the club won 2\u20131 at Team Northumbria, to clinch the Division Two title and gain promotion to the Northern Football League Division One. In only their second ever Northern League campaign, Stockton reached the final of the 2018 FA Vase competition. They played Thatcham of the Hellenic League, Berkshire. The final was played at Wembley Stadium on 20 May; the score was 1\u20130 to Thatcham. That year's semi-final against Marske United at Bishopton Road West, a 2\u20130 victory in Stockton's favour, saw a ground record 3,300 fans (1,800 of Stockton) watch the game. In the 2019-20 season, Stockton were leading the table by 13 points with eight games left to play. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Football Association ruled that the entire league would be expunged, with no sides in the league being promoted or relegated. Thus, Stockton were denied promotion despite being in 1st place. Representatives from the team and local MP Alex Cunningham protested against the move, but the ruling stayed in force. ==Ground== In 2015, the club moved to Bishopton Road West, for a cost of \u00a3800,000. The new stadium had a 100-seat stand, floodlighting, artificial (3G) turf pitch, pay booth, changing facilities, toilets and refreshment areas. ==Players== ===Current squad=== ===Youth teams=== The club has a variety of youth teams: under-7s, under-8s, under-9s, under-10s, under-11s, under-12s, under-13s, under-14s, under-15s, under-16s, and the official reserve team. ==Management team== {| class=\"wikitable unsortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Role ! scope=\"col\" | Name |- |Manager |align=left| Michael Dunwell |- |Assistant manager |align=left| J.D.
