    "text": "John Saunders Huxham (14 May 1861 \u2013 4 August 1949) was an accountant and a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. ==Early life== Huxham was born in Ivybridge, Devon, to parents Simon Huxham, labourer, and his wife Agnes (n\u00e9e Chapman).Huxham, John Saunders (1861\u20131949) - Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 30 May 2015. He was born Samuel John Chapman Huxham but changed his name to John Saunders Huxham later in life. Educated in London and beforehand at Ivybridge Dame School which he later described as \"harsh and desolate\" where punishment consisted of \"confinement in a dark cellar\", he left school at age 12 to become a merchant seaman which on occasions took him to Australia. John Huxham & Co. at the intersection of Edward and Adelaide Streets, Brisbane, ca. 1905 In 1879 he settled in Sydney, and found work as a bookseller's accountant before heading to Townsville in 1889 to work for the general merchants, Alfred Shaw & Co.. In April 1893, he transferred to Brisbane to work in Shaw's Brisbane office. Huxham left Alfred Shaw & Co. to begin work with music and instrument retailers, Pollard & Co. When the firm closed he went into partnership with Alex McKenzie to form John Huxham Co., importers, and retailers of sporting and musical goods. ==Political career== Representing the Labour Party, Huxham was a candidate for the seat of Brisbane South at the 1907 Queensland state election but was defeated by Opposition candidates William Stephens and Thomas Bouchard. 1908 saw the people of Queensland back at the polls. Huxham once again contested Brisbane South, this time successfully. He held the seat until 1909 when he was defeated at that year's state elections. At the 1912 state election, Huxham contested the newly created seat of Buranda where he once again found himself opposed by William Stephens. Huxham defeated him by 2,210 votes to 1,747 to win the seat, holding it until 1924 when he retired from politics. During his time in parliament he was Minister without Office in 1915\u20131916, Home Secretary in 1916\u20131919, and Secretary for Public Instruction in 1919\u20131924. Having taught at Sydney's \"ragged schools\" in the 1880s made Huxham a strong advocate for the underprivileged or handicapped. His daughter was blind from the age of seven due to meningitis and Huxham took an active interest in the Queensland Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institute where she was a teacher and he was made a life member of the institute in 1915. In parliament, Huxham would sit quietly for long periods, \"legs crossed, head bent slightly forward, arms folded\". He was a moderate and urged cooperation between the political parties for \"the good of the people\". Though this may have been seen as a sign of weakness, he stood side by side with the unionists in the Brisbane general strike in 1912 and as a consequence, he claimed his actions lost him friends and business. In 1924, Huxham was appointed Agent-General for Queensland in London, holding the role until 1929. ==Personal life== In 1884, Huxham married Eliza Jane Bubb (died 1896) in Sydney and together had five children. The next year he married Helen Julia Meiklejohn (n\u00e9e Dougherty) and they had one daughter. Helen died soon after arriving in London for her husband to take up the role of Agent-General for Queensland. Huxham died in August 1949. His funeral proceeded from the Vulture Street Baptist church at South Brisbane to the South Brisbane Cemetery.Huxham John -- Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 30 May 2015. His estate, valued for probate at \u00a322,372, was used to establish the Helen Huxham Hostel for blind girls in memory of his second wife. ==References== Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Category:1861 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Burials in South Brisbane Cemetery Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Queensland ",
