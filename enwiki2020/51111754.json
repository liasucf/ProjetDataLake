It was identified by Edwards in 1938. == Survey == In 2000, the two sites from which L. nigristigma was recorded in 1994 were resurveyed along with twenty or so similar sites in Shropshire and Montgomeryshire. The target species was located at eight (possibly nine) sites. The majority of sites are centred on southwest Telford with only two outlying sites. == References == == External links == * * Category:Fauna of England ",
