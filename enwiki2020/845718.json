    "text": "The Minister of Western Economic Diversification () is the Minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet who served as the chief executive of Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD). The post was traditionally held by an MP from Western Canada, although occasionally the responsibilities were accorded to a more senior cabinet minister, such as the Industry minister. As of November 4, 2015, WD, along with Canada's other regional development agencies, is operated as part of the Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) portfolio, led by Minister Navdeep Bains. Related regional development posts include Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, positions which have also been folded into ISED under Minister Bains. ==Ministers== Key: {| class=\"wikitable\" !No. !Name !colspan=2|Term of office !Political party !Ministry |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 1 | Bill McKnight | June 28, 1988 || January 29, 1989 | Progressive Conservative | rowspan=3|24 (Mulroney) |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 2 | Charlie Mayer | January 30, 1989 || January 3, 1993 | Progressive Conservative |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 3 | Mary Collins | January 4, 1993 || June 24, 1993 | Progressive Conservative |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 4 | Larry Schneider | June 25, 1993 || November 3, 1993 | Progressive Conservative | 25 (Campbell) |- ! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 5 | Lloyd Axworthy | November 4, 1993 || January 24, 1996 | Liberal | rowspan=4|26 (Chr\u00e9tien) |- ! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 6 | John Manley | January 25, 1996 || October 16, 2000 | Liberal |- ! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 7 | Brian Tobin | October 17, 2000 || January 14, 2002 | Liberal |- ! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 8 | Allan Rock | January 15, 2002 || December 11, 2003 | Liberal |- ! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 9 | Rey Pagtakhan | December 12, 2003 || July 20, 2004 | Liberal | rowspan=2|27 (Martin) |- ! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 10 | Stephen Owen | July 20, 2004 || February 6, 2006 | Conservative |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 11 | Carol Skelton | February 6, 2006 || January 4, 2007 | Conservative | rowspan=6|28 (Harper) |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 12 | Rona Ambrose | January 4, 2007 || October 30, 2008 | Conservative |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 13 | Jim Prentice | October 30, 2008 || November 5, 2010 | Conservative |- ! style=\"background:;\"| (12) | Rona Ambrose | November 5, 2010 || May 18, 2011 | Conservative |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 14 | Lynne Yelich | May 18, 2011 || July 16, 2013 | Conservative |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 15 | Michelle Rempel | July 16, 2013 || November 4, 2015 | Conservative |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 16 | Navdeep Bains | November 4, 2015 || Incumbent | Liberal | rowspan=1|29 (Trudeau) |} Western Economic Diversification ",
