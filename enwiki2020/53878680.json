From 1865 to 1867 he attended the Technical University of Vienna, studying chemistry, but he did not obtain a degree.

From 1877 until 1906 he performed with the Koschart Quintet. That year he also joined the choir at the Hofmusikkapelle and served as soloist there. As a composer he was known for his K\u00e4rntnerlieder, folk songs of Carinthia arranged by himself, or else his own compositions set in that style. With his men's quartet and quintet he toured Europe and the Americas, where the performances of his Carinthian music were enthusiastically received. For most of his life he resided in Vienna. Nonetheless he was made an honorary citizen of Klagenfurt in 1907 owing to the local nature of his work. Koschat died in Vienna, at his home on Strobachgasse in the 5th district, on 19 May 1914. He was buried at near Klagenfurt. ==Legacy== Koschat composed numerous pieces for choir, in addition to quartets and songs. Many of these are in waltz time and focus on Carinthian themes and locales. Additionally he published a book of poems in the Carinthian dialect. The Koschat Museum in Klagenfurt A museum dedicated to Koschat was opened in 1934, containing letters, manuscripts, portraits, awards, recordings, and other memorabilia related to his life and output. Heavily damaged during the Second World War, the museum was rebuilt and reopened in 1951 from funds raised through private donations and lotteries. The museum is open May through September for a couple of hours each day.
