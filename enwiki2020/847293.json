The case was filed in 2006 when the paper alleged the Klan inserted its fliers into Times newspapers, which then went to customers. The Klan counter-sued for defamation, but lost. In addition to punitive damages, the paper reportedly received the nation's first permanent injunction against the KKK, barring them from using the paper to distribute their literature in the future. ===Prisoner cartoon=== In June 2011, a controversy was created when the Rhino Times published a cartoon by Geof Brooks that featured two African American men in orange prison jumpsuits, in the front yards of what appears to be two suburban homes.Greensboro News & Record article: \"\"Dey builds a brand new jail...\" The first character states, \"Geez!

The story, including interviews with the couple and details of their arrest, was a fabrication. In response to controversy over the story, Hammer claimed the piece was intended as satire, though the publication did not in any way label it as such. In the next week's issue, Hammer apologized to readers for not clearly marking the piece as satire and \"to the police for maligning them.\"http://greensboroperformingarts.blogspot.com/2015/01/hartzmans-rhino- watch-january-22-2015.html == References == ==External links== *Official Rhino Times website Category:Newspapers published in North Carolina Category:Mass media in Charlotte, North Carolina ",
