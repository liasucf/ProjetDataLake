    "text": "Sepsivac is a novel drug developed by Cadila Pharmaceuticals to treat patients of gram-negative sepsis patients. As an immunomodulatory, it modulates the immune system of the body and hence significantly reduces mortality rate in patients with gram negative sepsis. Sepsivac is a drug developed by CSIR and Cadila Pharmaceuticals under New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) programme. __TOC__ == Mechanism == In patients with sepsis, in response to an infection, a lot of pro-inflammatory and anti- inflammatory cytokines are generated in the body. However, some of the cytokines also cause inflammation in the organs of the body, which might be harmful. Immunomodulator drugs such as Sepsivac regulate this host immune response. Sepsivac is found to be safe in patients with no systematic side- effects. It can be used in combination with other treatments to manage a patient in critical care setting. == Sepsivac and COVID-19 == Scientists at CSIR found similarities between the clinical characteristics of patients suffering from gram-negative sepsis and COVID-19. In association with Cadila Pharmaceuticals, the researchers are now working on initiating a randomised, blinded, controlled clinical trial to evaluate Sepsivac's efficacy to reduce mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The repurposed drug will boost the immunity of the body and limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase the recovery rate. The clinical trials will be conducted at premier national hospitals like PGIMER Chandigarh, AIIMS New Delhi and AIIMS, Bhopal. == References == Category:Sepsis Category:COVID-19 Category:Research Category:Drugs Category:Medicine ",
