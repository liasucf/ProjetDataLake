He made his debut on 11 August 2012, in a 2\u20132 draw against Burton Albion in the League Cup, and made his league debut a week later during a 1\u20130 win against Shrewsbury Town at Bramall Lane.

On 1 December 2012, Miller netted two goals in the 90th minute for the Blades in a 2\u20131 win over Port Vale in the FA Cup second round. Miller then scored against Scunthorpe in a 3\u20130 victory on Boxing Day 2012, only to be taken off later in the match with what turned out to be cruciate ligament damage to his knee, ruling him out for almost nine months. Miller did not appear for the United first team again until 19 October 2013, in a 2\u20131 victory against Port Vale at Bramall Lane. On 4 February 2014, Miller scored an extra time winning goal away at Premier League Fulham in a fourth- round FA Cup replay match. On 22 March 2014, Miller joined Shrewsbury Town on loan until the end of the season, scoring an injury time winner on his debut, as a substitute against Bradford City. Miller scored three goals in eight appearances before returning to United. On 15 May, it was revealed that Sheffield United would not be renewing Miller's contract, thus making him a free agent. ===Coventry City=== Miller signed a one-year contract with League One club Coventry City on 16 July 2014. He scored two goals in the early stages of the season, both coming off the bench against Cardiff City in the League Cup and in the league against Bristol City. ===Morecambe=== Miller signed for League Two club Morecambe on 5 August 2015 on a one-year contract. ===Carlisle United=== On 17 June 2016, Miller joined Morecambe's League Two rivals Carlisle United on a two-year contact.
