The monastery was closed on the orders of Cardinal Wolsey in 1525, and by 1705 the land was redeveloped once more, into Sandwell Hall, built for the Earl of Dartmouth. From the late 19th century the Hall was used as an asylum, and then in 1907, a home for boys, \"Sandwell Hall Industrial School for Mentally Defective Boys\".
