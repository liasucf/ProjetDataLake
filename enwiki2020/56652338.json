The arena would be located just south of SoFi Stadium, the home of the NFL's Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, and the Hollywood Park development. ==Features== The 18,000-seat arena would be designed by AECOM. In addition to the arena the venue would also include a practice facility, sports medicine clinic, team offices, retail space and a large outdoor plaza with basketball courts that would be open to the public. The practice facility would be , the team offices and the sports medicine clinic . An additional are set aside for retail and for the outdoor plaza. ==Competition with The Forum== As the new venue could also host concerts, it was reasoned the Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center could provide direct competition with The Forum. Several lawsuits were filed to attempt to prevent the construction of the arena, which would ensure no nearby arena would compete with The Madison Square Garden Company-owned Forum. In December 2018, the Clippers filed a countersuit against The Madison Square Garden Company alleging that they tried to prevent competition with The Forum. In March 2019, leaked emails revealed that Irving Azoff attempted to lure the Los Angeles Lakers back to The Forum after their lease at Staples Center was up. Despite nothing coming of the proposal, Azoff's proposal to re- purpose The Forum was seen as a way of preventing the LA Clippers from building their own arena in Inglewood and ensuring that the Madison Square Garden Company got an unfair advantage over rival AEG, which already owns part of the Lakers. In November 2019, a judge tossed a lawsuit by Uplift Inglewood seeking to stop the arena's construction. In December 2019, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) approved the new arena, after evaluating the arena's environmental impact. In March 2020, Steve Ballmer announced his intent to purchase The Forum for $400 million, ending the lawsuit. The Forum will continue to host concerts, and all venue employees who held jobs under the Madison Square Garden Company were offered jobs by Ballmer. The Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center, intended by Ballmer to serve as the new home for the LA Clippers, will be built as originally planned. == Construction == On July 25, 2019, the Clippers released new images of the proposed arena. Construction is planned to begin in 2021 and be completed in fall 2024, following the expiration of the Clippers' lease with the Staples Center. ==References== ==External links== * Clippers Arena Website Category:Proposed indoor arenas in the United States Category:Basketball venues Category:Los Angeles Clippers Category:National Basketball Association venues Category:Inglewood, California Category:Sports venues in Inglewood, California Category:Proposed buildings and structures in California ",
