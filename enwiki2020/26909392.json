    "text": "\"Good Times\" is a single by London-based grime music collective Roll Deep, which features vocals by Jodie Connor. It was released for digital download on 25 April 2010 on Relentless / Virgin Records. The MCs who make an appearance in the song are Wiley, Breeze, Brazen and Scratchy. The song was produced by Takeover Entertainment producer David Dawood and the chorus topline was written by David Dawood, Jodie Connor & Charlotte. It has been parodied by Chris Moyles and Dave Vitty as \"Good Rhyme\" by artist Roll Deeper. ==Critical reception== Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating: > 2010 has already thrown up some pretty original pop hits (Plan B's 'She > Said', Ellie Goulding's 'Starry Eyed'), some pretty classy ones Kelis's > 'Acapella', Alicia Keys's 'Empire State of Mind Part II', and some that, > though neither of these things, pretty much do the business regardless. > 'Good Times', the new tune from London grime crew Roll Deep, falls firmly > into that last category. The urban clubby production owes a debt to Calvin > Harris's recent Dizzee Rascal collaborations, the lyrics mine much the same > party-on vibe as [the] Black Eyed Peas' 'I Gotta Feeling', and there are > even a few GaGa-style \"oh-oh-oh-oh\"s chucked in for good measure. > Desperately derivative it may be, but it's hard to take against a single > that rhymes \"late-night shopping\" with \"high street bopping\", especially one > with a socking great chorus like this. . ==Track listings and formats== ==Chart performance== \"Good Times\" debuted on the Irish Singles Chart on 29 April 2010 at number 42, peaking at number 13. On 2 May 2010, \"Good Times\" entered the UK Singles Chart at #1. This marked Roll Deep's first Top 10 hit, and their first ever number-one single in the UK. The single remained at the top spot for three consecutive weeks, being the second act to do so that year after Owl City spent 3 weeks at the top spot in February 2010 with \"Fireflies\". ==Personnel== *Wiley - vocals *Breeze - vocals *Brazen - vocals *Scratchy - vocals With: *Jodie Connor - vocals (chorus) ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2010\u201311) !Peak Position |- |- |European Hot 100 SinglesMay 2010 Roll Deep -'Good Times, European Hot 100 Charts.
