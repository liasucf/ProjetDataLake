    "text": "Stadio Angelo Massimino (previously known as Stadio Cibali) is a multi-use stadium in Catania, Italy. It is used mostly for football matches and the home of Calcio Catania. The stadium was built in 1935 by architect Raffaele Leone on behalf of the company owned by the engineer Antonio Ferro and holds 20,266. It was renamed in 2002 after former Catania chairman Angelo Massimino. Catania was banned from playing any Serie A matches inside the stadium from 14 February 2007 until 30 June 2007. This was due to the violence that occurred on 2 February 2007 outside the stadium in the clash against Palermo which resulted in the death of a police officer. ==References== ==External links== *Stadium picture *images from the stadium, data and match visits at Kopane.de Venue Angelo Massimino Category:Sports venues in Catania Category:1937 establishments in Italy Category:Sports venues completed in 1937 Angelo ",
