Comedy club Toomler in Amsterdam is its home theatre. The word Comedytrain is a combination of comedy and training. Its main goal was to give talented comedians, who did not succeed at once in making an hour and a half one-man show, a place to perform and develop, to try out, fail and succeed; to evaluate others and be evaluated by them. Over the years Comedytrain has become the home of famous Dutch comedians, like Hans Teeuwen, Theo Maassen, Najib Amhali, Hans Sibbel, Thomas Acda, Ronald Goedemondt, Jan Jaap van der Wal, and Sanne Wallis de Vries. Comedytrain is still a place where young comedians find a stage for developing as performers. Twice a year auditions are held for new talents to enter Comedytrain. The comedians do not only play the Toomler stage weekly, but also tour the Dutch theatres together, perform for companies and parties and play the many stages in theatre caf\u00e9's and bars all over the country. == References == == External links == * * Official site * Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch columnists Category:Dutch comedians Category:Dutch Jews Category:Jewish comedians Category:Jewish writers Category:People from Bussum Category:Secular Jews ",
