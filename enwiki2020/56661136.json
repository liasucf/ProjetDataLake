    "text": "The Painted Bird () is a 2019 internationally co-produced black-and-white war drama film written, directed and produced by V\u00e1clav Marhoul. It is an adaptation of Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski's novel of the same name. It is the first film to feature the Interslavic language; Marhoul stated that he decided to use Interslavic so that no Slavic nation would nationally identify with the story. The Painted Bird was selected to play in competition at the 76th Venice International Film Festival and was chosen for 2019 Toronto International Film Festival as part of Special Presentations. The film also screened in the Dare strand at the 63rd BFI London Film Festival. It was selected as the Czech entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards making the December shortlist. Its brutal scenes led to walkouts from audiences at the Venice, Toronto and London film festivals. At the 35th Warsaw International Film Festival, the audience honored the film with a long ovation after its only screening. ==Plot== In an unidentified area of war-torn Eastern Europe, a young boy is sent by his parents to live in safety with his aunt. She dies and he sets off on a journey to return home. His adventures are a series of horrific encounters with ignorance, exploitation, and depravity. In the first village he reaches an old healer who exploits him. He is next taken in by a miller and his wife, who is one of the rare people he encounters who treat him kindly. After the miller gouges out the eyes of a younger man seen exchanging glances with his wife, the boy runs off. He meets Lekh, a bird breeder who treats him well. But Lekh has sex with a wild woman whom local village women brutally rape, after which Lekh hangs himself. The boy leaves. The boy finds a tame horse with a broken leg and takes it to the next village, where a villager kills it. The villagers then seize the boy and, as an act of appeasement, deliver him to the Germans, identifying him as a Jew. The German soldier tasked with executing the boy releases him. Later caught by SS guards who bring him to a local town, he is saved from execution when he cleans the shoes of a German officer. A local priest then takes him in, but soon arranges for him to lodge with a local, who proves to be a pedophile named Garbos. The boy causes Garbos gruesome death. After the well-meaning priest dies, his replacement has no use for him and he is run out of the town. He is then taken in by Labina. When her elderly husband dies, she molests him though he is too young to perform sexually. After he sees her having sex with a goat, he kills the animal and tosses its head through the window of Labina's house and then runs away once more. The boy comes into contact with the Red Army. One of the Soviet officers, a sniper named Mitka, decides to take care of him for the time being. He watches Mitka kill several locals in reprisal for an attack on Russian soldiers. As the Russians decamp, they send the boy to an orphanage, where he is a loner and repeatedly tries to escape. He is beaten by a local anti-Semitic shopkeeper whom he kills in revenge. Nikod\u00e9m comes to the orphanage, greets the boy tearfully as his son, and takes him home. The boy refuses to speak, as he has not spoken throughout the film. Nikod\u00e9m tries to explain why they sent him to his aunt and the boy protests angrily. He asks if he at least remembers his name but the boy does not respond. Traveling by bus toward home, Nikod\u00e9m falls asleep. His son notices a number tattooed on his father's arm and with his finger writes his name Joska on the bus window. ==Cast== * Petr Kotl\u00e1r as Joska * Nina \u0160unevi\u010d as Marta * Ala Sakalova as Olga * Udo Kier as Miller * Michaela Dole\u017ealov\u00e1 as Miller's Wife * Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as Hans * Harvey Keitel as Priest * Julian Sands as Garbos * J\u00falia Vidrn\u00e1kov\u00e1 as Labina * Lech Dyblik as Lekh * Aleksei Kravchenko as Gavrila * Barry Pepper as Mitka * Petr Van\u011bk as Nikod\u00e9m * Radim Fiala as Cossack * Jitka \u010cvan\u010darov\u00e1 as Ludmila * Alexander Leopold Schank as SS Officer * Alexander Minaev as Red Army officer * Pavel K\u0159\u00ed\u017e as Avid man * Zden\u011bk Pecha as worker * Milan \u0160im\u00e1\u010dek as Horse owner * Martin Nah\u00e1lka as Red partisan * Dominik Weber as Captain * Andrej Pol\u00e1k as Doctor in orphanage * Filip Ka\u0148kovsk\u00fd as Merchant * Luk\u00e1\u0161 Hlo\u017eek ==Production== V\u00e1clav Marhoul announced his intention to adapt Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski's The Painted Bird in September 2012 when he secured rights for the story.

It holds an approval rating of 80% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 85 reviews, with an average rating of 7.51/10.

The film was projected for journalists on 2 September 2019. Some people left the theatre as they could not stand the depicted violence and rape scenes. The Daily Mail described it as \"a panoply of depravity.\u201d Overall reception was positive as the film received a long ovation from the audience and some unofficial responses called it one of the front-runners for Golden Lion, but ultimately lost to Joker. Director Marhoul was particularly praised. The film also received a 10-minute standing ovation during its premiere on 3 September 2019. Xan Brooks of the Guardian gave the film five stars, calling it a \"savage, searing three-hour tour of hell\" and \"phantasmagorical horror, rattling around ravaged eastern Europe for just shy of three hours.\" He praised the film's visuals and atmosphere. Guy Lodge of Variety was also positive, noting camerawork by Vladim\u00edr Smutn\u00fd. He called the film \"muscular, savagely realized Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski adaptation puts an unnamed Jewish boy through a challenging litany of Holocaust horrors.\" In a more negative review, A.A. Dowd of the A.V. Club praised the film's cinematography while criticizing its bleak tone, saying \"The Painted Bird is, in the end, the kind of slog that treats shopworn insights about the brutality of man as justification for drowning us in the evidence.\" The Hollywood Reporter picked The Painted Bird as one of 20 best films projected at Film festivals during Fall 2019. ===Box office=== The film opened in Czech cinemas on 12 September 2019.
