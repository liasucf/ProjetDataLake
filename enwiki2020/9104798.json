    "text": "In descriptive set theory, a tree over a product set Y\\times Z is said to be homogeneous if there is a system of measures \\langle\\mu_s\\mid s\\in{}^{<\\omega}Y\\rangle such that the following conditions hold: * \\mu_s is a countably-additive measure on \\\\{t\\mid\\langle s,t\\rangle\\in T\\\\} . * The measures are in some sense compatible under restriction of sequences: if s_1\\subseteq s_2, then \\mu_{s_1}(X)=1\\iff\\mu_{s_2}(\\\\{t\\mid t\\upharpoonright lh(s_1)\\in X\\\\})=1. * If x is in the projection of T, the ultrapower by \\langle\\mu_{x\\upharpoonright n}\\mid n\\in\\omega\\rangle is wellfounded. An equivalent definition is produced when the final condition is replaced with the following: * There are \\langle\\mu_s\\mid s\\in{}^\\omega Y\\rangle such that if x is in the projection of [T] and \\forall n\\in\\omega\\,\\mu_{x\\upharpoonright n}(X_n)=1, then there is f\\in{}^\\omega Z such that \\forall n\\in\\omega\\,f\\upharpoonright n\\in X_n. This condition can be thought of as a sort of countable completeness condition on the system of measures. T is said to be \\kappa-homogeneous if each \\mu_s is \\kappa-complete. Homogeneous trees are involved in Martin and Steel's proof of projective determinacy. ==References== * Category:Descriptive set theory Category:Determinacy ",
