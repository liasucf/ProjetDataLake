A launch date has not yet been announced. ==Design and operation== Controlled by weight-shifting, similar manner as that of the Segway PT, the unit is fully self-balancing and can move in any direction, including sideways. There are two wheels, the larger driving wheel for travelling in a forward direction, and a trailing steering wheel at 90 degrees to this one. Both the drive wheel and the steering wheel however are constructed of multiple smaller 'planet' wheels that allow the wheel to be moved laterally. When moving forward the main wheel will be powered and the smaller planet wheels on the steering wheel will rotate to avoid the steering wheel dragging. To turn the steering wheel is rotated. To balance from side to side, or to self-balance laterally, the planet wheels on the drive wheel will be powered appropriately. Measuring 510 x 315 x 620 mm and weighing 25 kg, the UNI-CUB is powered by a lithium-ion battery and has a 6 km/h top speed and 6 km range. The seat height is 620 mm, while footrests are designed to double as support stands. ==External links== *UNI-CUB video and information *YouTube *Image *History and gallery of prototypes *Details of traction system *Video for the song \"I Won't Let You Down\" by OK Go, in which performers used the UniCub ==References== Category:Personal transporters Category:Japanese inventions Category:Battery electric vehicles Category:Mobility devices Category:One-wheeled balancing robots Category:Honda concept vehicles Category:Robotics at Honda ",
