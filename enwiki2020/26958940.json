    "text": "Daflon is a micronized purified flavonoid fraction containing 90% diosmin and 10% other flavonoids expressed as hesperidin. It is manufactured by Laboratoires Servier. == Vein diseases and hemorrhoids == Because Daflon is not an FDA-approved medication, it cannot be advertised for treatment of diseases in the United States. Daflon is under preliminary research for its potential use in treating vein diseases, or hemorrhoids. It is sold as a drug in France and Malaysia. A 2016 Cochrane review concerning Diosmin showed it had only moderate-quality evidence for treating chronic venous insufficiency. Diosmiplex, a micronized purified flavonoid fraction, with similar venous insufficiency indication, is sold as a prescription medical food in the US. == Dosage == For venous insufficiency, the dosage is 2 tablets daily. For acute hemorrhoidal attack, the dosage is 6 tablets daily for 4 days, followed by 4 tablets daily over the next 3 days. For chronic venous disease, the dosage is 2 tablets a day for at least 2 months. == Side effects == Possible side effects include routine gastric disorders and neurovegetative disorders. == References == == External links == * Official website Category:Flavonoids Category:Drugs acting on the cardiovascular system Category:Drug brand names ",
