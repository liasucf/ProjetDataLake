    "text": "Emapalumab, sold under the brand name Gamifant, is an anti-interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) antibody medication used for the treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which currently has no cure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. ==Adverse effects== In the clinical trials that lead to emapalumab's FDA approval, the most commonly reported adverse effects were infections (56%), high blood pressure (41%), infusion reactions (27%), and fever (24%). Serious adverse effects occurred in about half of the subjects studied in the clinical trial that led to its FDA approval. ==Pharmacology== ===Mechanism of action=== In the setting of HLH, over-secretion of IFN-\u03b3 is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Emapalumab binds and neutralizes IFN-\u03b3, preventing it from inducing pathological effects. ===Pharmacokinetics=== Like other antibody-based medications, which are made of amino acid chains called polypeptides, emapalumab is broken down into smaller peptides via the body's normal catabolism. ==Society and culture== === Legal status === The FDA awarded orphan drug status in 2012, and breakthrough therapy designation in 2016 on the basis of preliminary data from the phase II trial. In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization for emapalumab. ==Research== The research name of emapalumab was NI-0501. A phase II/III trial began in 2013 and is ongoing . The trial targets patients under the age of 18 who have failed to improve on conventional treatments. This study was realised in the context of an EU-funded FP7 project, named FIGHT-HLH (306124). == References == ==External links== * Category:Breakthrough therapy Category:Experimental drugs Category:Monoclonal antibodies Category:Orphan drugs ",
