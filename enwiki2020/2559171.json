    "text": "Chess Oscar was an international award given annually to the best chess player. The winner was selected by votes that are cast by chess journalists from across the world. The traditional voting procedure was to request hundreds of chess journalists from many countries to submit a list of the ten best players of the year. The voters were journalists who knew the game and followed it closely, and so the honor was highly prized. The award itself took the form of a bronze statuette representing a man in a boat. The prize was created and awarded in 1967 by Spanish journalist Jorge Puig, and the International Association of Chess Press (AIP). The awards were given from 1967 until 1988. Then, after a pause, they resumed in 1995, and were then organized by the Russian chess magazine 64.Hill, Tata McGraw. General Knowledge Digest 2010.

It represented a figure known as \"The Fascinated Wanderer\", which refers to a short story written in 1873 by 19th-century Russian author Nikolai Leskov. In this story, the title character, Ivan Flyagin, is a horse trainer and a brute of a man. From his birth his mother has promised that Ivan's life would be devoted to the church. Ivan spends many years avoiding this fate, but eventually gives in and becomes a monk, not for spiritual reasons, but due to a poverty of opportunity.Leskov, Nikolai. The Enchanted Wanderer: Selected Tales, Modern Library Classics, 2003. The Chess Oscar statuette originally took the form of \"The Lady of the Umbrella\", a figure based on a statue in Parc de la Ciutadella in Barcelona, Spain. ==Winners== :{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !Year !!Player !!Country |- | 1967 || || |- | 1968 || || |- | 1969 || || |- | 1970 || || |- | 1971 || || |- | 1972 || || |- | 1973 || || |- | 1974 || || |- | 1975 || || |- | 1976 || || |- | 1977 || || |- | 1978 || || |- | 1979 || || |- | 1980 || || |- | 1981 || || |- | 1982 || || |- | 1983 || || |- | 1984 || || |- | 1985 || || |- | 1986 || || |- | 1987 || || |- | 1988 || || |- | 1989\u201394 || no awards || |- | 1995 || || |- | 1996 || || |- | 1997 || || |- | 1998 || || |- | 1999 || || |- | 2000 || || |- | 2001 || || |- | 2002 || Kasparov wins 2002 Chess Oscar, ChessBase News, 9-May-2003 || |- | 2003 || Anand wins Chess Oscar for third time, rediff.com, 6-May-2004Anand wins third Chess Oscar, ChessBase News, 8-May-2004 || |- | 2004 || || |- | 2005 || Chess Oscar 2005 for Veselin Topalov, ChessBase News, 30-April-2006 || |- | 2006 || Chess Oscar 2006, The Week in Chess 654, 21-May-2007 || |- | 2007 || Anand Wins Chess Oscars for 2007, ChessBase News, 8-May-2008 || |- | 2008 || \u201cOscar\u201d prize to be brought to Baku for the first time! , APA News, 21 Apr 2009, access date 2009-04-22. || |- | 2009 || And the 2009 Oscar goes to ...
