    "text": "Molnupiravir, or MK-4482, also known as EIDD-2801 until July 2020, is an experimental antiviral drug which is orally active (can be taken orally) and was developed for the treatment of influenza. It is a prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative N4-hydroxycytidine, and exerts its antiviral action through introduction of copying errors during viral RNA replication. Activity has also been demonstrated against coronaviruses including SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. The drug was developed at Emory University by the university's drug innovation company, DRIVE. It was then acquired by Miami-based company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, who later partnered with Merck & Co. to develop the drug further. It was renamed by Merck in July 2020. == Safety Controversy == In April 2020, a whistleblower complaint by former Head of US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) Rick Bright suggested he had been removed from his position over raising concerns over providing funding for the further development of MK-4482 due to similar drugs having mutagenic properties (producing birth defects). A previous company, Pharmasset, that had investigated the drug's active ingredient had abandoned it. These claims were denied by George Painter, CEO of Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), noting that toxicity studies on MK-4482 had been carried out and data provided to regulators in the US and UK, who permitted safety studies in humans to move forward in the spring of 2020. Also at this time, DRIVE and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics stated they planned future safety studies in animals. == COVID-19 == After being found to be active against SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020, MK-4482 was tested in a preliminary human study for \"Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics\" in healthy volunteers in the UK and US. In June 2020, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics announced it was moving to Phase II trials to test the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.. Two trials of small numbers of hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients in the US and the UK were underway in July. In late July 2020, and without yet releasing any medical data, Merck, which had been partnering with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics on developing the drug, announced its intention to move MK-4482 to late stage trials beginning in September 2020. == References == Category:Anti-RNA virus drugs Category:Antivirals ",
