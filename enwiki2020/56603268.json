She represented Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 with the song \"\u00d3neir\u00f3 mou\". ==Biography== Terzi was born on 1 December 1980 in Thessaloniki. She is the daughter of Greek singer Paschalis Terzis. At age 20, she moved to Athens to pursue a music career, releasing her first CD single in 2005, and the album Gyrna to kleidi in 2006 through Cobalt Music. She then signed to Minos EMI and released the album Ase me na taxidepso in 2008 along with a single of the same name. Terzi later moved to the United States and worked as a talent scout for Interscope Records. Terzi was selected as one of the twenty shortlisted artists for the Ellinik\u00f3s Telik\u00f3s 2018 with the song \"\u00d3neir\u00f3 mou\" on 27 October 2017, representing Panik Records. Later, on 8 November, she became one of the five acts to be selected to move on to the televised final. Following the disqualification of two of the five acts for not having a \"Greek sound\", \"\u00d3neir\u00f3 mou\" entered the top three. On 15 February 2018, it was reported that the record labels for the two other competing artists refused to pay a \u20ac20,000 fee to the Greek broadcaster Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) and were disqualified from the competition, leaving \"\u00d3neir\u00f3 mou\" as the only song remaining and the default Greek entry. ==Discography== Yianna Terzi during a rehearsal at the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\"| GRE |- ! scope=\"row\"| Gyrna to kleidi | * Released: 1 February 2006 * Label: Cobalt Music * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ase me na taxidepso | * Released: 19 May 2008 * Label: Minos EMI * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\"| GRE |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Gianna Terzi\" | 2005 | 8 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Ase me na taxidepso\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2008 | \u2014 | rowspan=\"2\"| Ase me na taxidepso |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Apistefto\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"\u00d3neir\u00f3 mou\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2018 | 1 | rowspan=\"5\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Eternity\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Karma\" | 16 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Logia Omorfa (Stanga)\" | 2019 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Yia Sena Mono\" (featuring Paschalis Terzis) | 2020 | 17 |} ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 2018 Category:Greek contemporary la\u00efko singers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Greece Category:Greek expatriates in the United States Category:Greek female singers Category:Greek pop singers Category:Living people Category:Minos EMI artists Category:Panik Records artists Category:Singers from Thessaloniki Category:Universal Music Greece artists Category:21st-century women singers ",
