He committed suicide at the age of 20. The film Vera by S\u00e9rgio Toledo is based on Herzer's life. == Life and times == 200px Herzer was a transsexual man, ex-intern of FEBEM or Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Estadual para o Bem Estar do Menor (a State institution for the protection of minors) whose life and verses were published in a book titled A queda para o alto, (translated as 'descending upwards' in English as This book, in turn, served as the basis for the Brazilian film production Vera, directed by S\u00e9rgio Toledo Segall (better known as S\u00e9rgio Toledo).O suic\u00eddio em poetas jovens, como Sandra (Anderson) Herzer, vulgo Bigode by Jos\u00e9 Carlos A. Brito (in Portuguese). He was four years old when his father was killed, and his mother, a prostitute at that time, felt unable to take care of him, therefore turning young Herzer in to FEBEM. Sometime soon after that, his mother died. Although Herzer considered himself to be a lesbian for some time in his life, he then identified as transsexual. His school records show that he was a problem student, often engaging in fights, using street drugs and consuming alcohol. Herzer was institutionalized in FEBEM when he was fourteen years old. At that time he adopted the name Anderson Bigode Herzer (Anderson being a common male first name in Brazil; although bigode is an unusual nickname, meaning mustache). He remained under the State's tutelage until seventeen years of age. At that time Eduardo Suplicy, a renowned member of parliament (deputado in Portuguese), touched by his poems and difficult life, acted as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and hired him as an intern in his office.O Direito Inalien\u00e1vel a Uma Renda B\u00e1sica no S\u00e9culo XXI por Eduardo Matarazzo Suplicy.
