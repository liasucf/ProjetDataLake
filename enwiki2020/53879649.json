After working for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad he began farming and he was eventually able to buy of land for his own farm north of town. with In 1918 Hultquist employed C.K. Schantz to build this two story, frame, American Foursquare for he and his second wife Amanda after his retirement. It was fairly common for the early Swedish immigrants in Wayne Township to relocate to Swedesburg after they retired from farming so as to maintain their Swedish traditions. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The historic designation also includes a small barn to the east of the house. The front gable structure originally housed horses, a cow and chickens. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1918 Category:American Foursquare architecture in Iowa Category:Swedesburg, Iowa Category:Houses in Henry County, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Henry County, Iowa Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ",
