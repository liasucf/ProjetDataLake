They released two singles, \"Use Your Imagination\" / \"Hold On\" for CBS, and \"Double Sight\" / \"Fredereek Hernando\" for MGM. This has become one of the most collectable psychedelic singles, and was included in David Wells' Top 100 Psychedelic Records by Record Collector magazine. A compilation album was released in 2008, which included both their singles and previously unreleased acetate tracks. Their song \"No Smokes\" was used in an episode of the TV series Clangers. ==Discography== === Singles === * \"Use Your Imagination\" / \"Hold On\" (CBS 202513) 1967 * \"Fredereek Hernando\" / \"Double Sight\" (MGM 1370) 1967 ===Compilation albums=== *Double Sight (Wooden Hill WHCD018) 2008 ==References== Category:British psychedelic rock music groups Category:Scottish rock music groups ",
