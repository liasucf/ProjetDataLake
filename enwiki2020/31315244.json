    "text": "A Vacation in Hell is a 1979 American made-for-television, action-adventure- thriller film starring Priscilla Barnes, Barbara Feldon, Maureen McCormick, Andrea Marcovicci, and Michael Brandon as part of a group of lost vacationers being stalked through the Hawaiian jungle. It was helmed by Roots director David Greene and has acquired a cult following, due in large part to subsequent reairings in syndication. ==Plot== Led by Denise (Barnes), the dumb blonde who is not as dumb as one thinks, a group of vacationers, all of them female except one, become lost in an island jungle and stalked by a deranged tribe of murderous natives. A feminist (Marcovicci), a mother (Feldon), her daughter (McCormick) and a swinging smooth operator (Brandon) round out the other endangered tourists. ==Cast== *Priscilla Barnes ...
