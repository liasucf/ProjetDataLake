    "text": "Imma euglypta is a moth in the family Immidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1931. It is found in Colombia. The wingspan is about 27 mm. The forewings are white, irregularly irrorated (sprinkled) with light reddish brown and ochreous brown, more closely and suffusedly posteriorly. There is a short black subcostal dash rising from a small blackish costal spot near the base and there are blackish spots on the costa at one-fifth and the middle, as well as three or four short black linear marks in a subcostal series on the median third. A rather oblique dark brown line or series of small spots crosses the disc about one-third and there is a black bar on the end of the cell, preceded by some dark brown clouding and small spots, and followed by a white spot, beyond this a small blackish spot, followed by yellow-ochreous suffusion extended as a fasciate streak dilated beneath to the dorsum, a dark brown line limiting this posteriorly. Three small dark brown spots are found on the costa posteriorly, and a terminal series. The hindwings are grey, darker towards the apex, and with a darker spot on the transverse vein.Exotic Microlepidoptera. 4: 181. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1931 Category:Immidae Category:Moths of South America ",
