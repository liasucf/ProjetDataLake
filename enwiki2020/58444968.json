She does all this so that her daughter Dorothy (Hope), who was reared in a convent, might not be contaminated by the presence of the roue. However, Harvey meets the young woman and a genuine affection springs up for her. On the day that they are to elope, Marie goes to Harvey's apartment, finds her daughter waiting in an adjoining room, and in desperation shoots Harvey, wounding him in the hand. \"I did not think that you would do it,\" he says. \"You've won.\" He forthright tells Dorothy that he did not intend to marry her. \"The grim comedian\" known as life has turned the tables on the millionaire when happiness was within his grasp. ==Cast== * Phoebe Hunt as Marie Lamonte * Jack Holt as Harvey Martin * Gloria Hope as Dorothy * Bert Woodruff as Old Dad * Laura La Varnie as Gracie Moore * May Hopkins as Billie Page * John Harron as Geoffrey Hutchins * Joseph J.
