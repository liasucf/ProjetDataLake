In the Okinawan language, kooreegusu () still refers to the chili pepper itself but in Japanese, the term is applied to the awamori chili sauce while shima t\u014dgarashi (, literally \"island chili pepper\") is used for the chili. According to the ', the chili was introduced by the Satsuma in the 18th century. There is a theory that the chili sauce might have been developed from Hawaiian chili pepper water by returning Okinawan migrants but its exact origin is unknown. ==Preparation and uses== The chili peppers are washed and then soaked in awamori for at least 10 days. K\u014dr\u0113gusu is a commercial product (with added vinegar and citric acid) but is also often homemade. The sauce is long-lasting but the liquid will eventually become cloudy and should be discarded. Some varieties of k\u014dr\u0113gusu are made with vinegar or soya sauce instead of awamori. In Miyako-jima and some of the other Sakishima Islands, it is also common to use crushed chilis or to form a paste by mixing it with garlic. K\u014dr\u0113gusu is a common tabletop condiment in the Ryukyus used on Okinawa soba, chanpur\u016b, , sashimi and miso soup. Due to its alcohol content and low viscosity, k\u014dr\u0113gusu can dramatically change the flavor of a dish even in a small amounts so judicious use is desirable. ==References== Category:Chili sauce and paste Category:Japanese condiments Category:Okinawan cuisine ",
