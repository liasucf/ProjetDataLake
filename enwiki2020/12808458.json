    "text": "Kittens Reichert (March 3, 1910 \u2013 January 11, 1990) was an American child actress in silent films. ==Biography== She was born Catherine Alma Reichert in Yonkers, New York, but was nicknamed \"Kittens\", which she adopted as her stage name. Her film career started in 1914, playing supporting juvenile roles to many of filmdom's biggest stars, including Theda Bara, Pauline Frederick and William Farnum. Her career effectively ended when she was 9 in 1919 because her family did not want to move out to California, where the film industry had shifted, though she did make a further appearance in So's Your Old Man (1926), starring W. C. Fields. Reichert died in Louisville, Kentucky on January 11, 1990 at the age of 79. ==Selected filmography== *The Eternal City (1915) *A Soldier's Oath (1915) *The Eternal Sapho (1916) * The Great Problem (1916) * The Fool's Revenge (1916) *Ambition (1916) * The Primitive Call (1917) * Every Girl's Dream (1917) *So's Your Old Man (1926) ==References== *The Ultimate Directory of Silent Screen Performers pp. 64\u201365 by Billy H.
