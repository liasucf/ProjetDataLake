Briegleb and produced by the Sailplane Corporation of America as a completed aircraft and also as a kit.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 7. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 ==Design and development== The BG-7 was a development of the 1939 BG-6, with longer, semi-tapered wings of span, compared to the wing on the earlier model. The BG-7 wing is made from wood structure, with two spars and covered in doped aircraft fabric. The wing is supported by dual struts. The fuselage is made from steel tube, again with fabric covering and the tail is metal and fabric. The longer wing created stability issues and many aircraft were subsequently modified by either lengthening the tail to increase the tail arm or enlarging the vertical fin. Cockpit modifications were also common. Three BG-7s were completed by the factory and a further 20 kits were sold. The type was never certified and most were amateur-built from factory kits. ==Operational history== In 1952 Betsy Woodward Proudfit, flying a BG-7, set the feminine speed record for the triangle, at . The record stood for eighteen years. In March 2011 there were still 2 BG-7s on the Federal Aviation Administration register. ==Specifications (BG-7) == ==See also== *Briegleb El Mirage Airfield ==References== Category:1940s United States sailplanes BG-7 ",
