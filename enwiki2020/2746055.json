    "text": "Mount de Sales Academy, commonly referred to as MDS, is a Catholic, independent, college preparatory school in Macon, Georgia. It was founded in 1876 by five Sisters of Mercy as a boarding school for girls. In 1959, it became coeducational and ended boarding school operations in 1963. The Sisters served in an administrative capacity until 2002, when the first lay head of school was selected by the school's Board of Trustees. Mount de Sales is governed by its trustees and continues to be sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy. It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Savannah. ==History== === Early history === In 1871 during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, a group of five Sisters of Mercy from Columbus, Georgia, began a small school known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart Jesus on the corner of Fourth and Walnut streets in Macon.https://www.mountdesales.net/about/our-history/ In 1876, the mother house of the Sisters relocated from Columbus to Macon. With help from others, the Sisters purchased the former home of Georgia Governor George W. Town for use at the corner of Orange and Columbus streets on Beall's Hill in downtown Macon. On February 28, 1876, the new school was chartered under the name of Mount de Sales in honor of Saint Francis de Sales. When the first graduation exercises were held in 1882, it had expanded to comprise three divisions: primary, preparatory and senior. It educated mostly girls in grades 1-12, housing boarding students from around the southeastern United States and Latin America.http://www.mountdesales.net/misc/advancement/deSalesSheet_Fall2015.pdf Governor George Towns c. 1880s, the original building and site of Mount de Sales Academy. ===Modernization and expansion=== Sheridan Hall In 1936, Mount de Sales discontinued its primary school, but continued as a girls' secondary school for boarding and day students until 1959, when the first boys were admitted as day students.https://www.mountdesales.net/about/our-history/ The girls' boarding school closed in 1963 and the school continued as a coeducation day school. The first coeducational graduating class included 16 boys among 46 total graduates in 1963. The fall of 1963 marked the racial integration of Mount de Sales as a result of a diocesan edict, making it the first school in Middle Georgia to desegregate.http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/Vol_65__1964.pdf David J. Zuver Performing Arts Center In 1975, the middle school returned with the re-addition of an eighth grade. A seventh grade was reinstalled in 1988, followed by a sixth grade in 2004.https://www.mountdesales.net/about/our- history/ The original convent and boarding school building was demolished in the early 1970s and replaced by Sheridan Hall in 1990. New buildings were constructed over the following decades. Cavalier Fields, a athletic complex, opened in 1998 approximately west of the downtown campus. Father John Cuddy Hall ==Academics== The upper school's curriculum includes honor, Advanced Placement and dual-enrollment college courses in most subject areas, along with a broad range of elective courses. Upper school students must perform 20 hours of community service annually, while middle school students are required to complete service projects. The middle school's House System places students in cross-grade level groups to foster positive social development. All students take theology courses and attend Mass on Holy Days. While Mount de Sales has a Catholic heritage, about two-thirds of students are of non- Catholic faiths. Students hail from more than 30 Georgia zip codes and the school hosts dozens of international exchange students.https://www.mountdesales.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-MDS- Profile.pdfhttps://myemail.constantcontact.com/de-Sales-Sheet-Magazine--- Spring-Digital-Edition.html?soid=1116188035096&aid;=MK2jJZ4b0SQ ==Controversy== In 2014, Mount de Sales came under national scrutiny when administrators fired Flint Dollar, an openly gay music teacher who planned to marry his longtime male partner, based on the Catholic church's doctrine against same-sex marriage.https://www.npr.org/2014/07/09/329235789/gay- teacher-files-sex-discrimination-claim-against-georgia-school In 2015, both parties reached a confidential settlement.http://www.macon.com/news/local/education/article30704754.html ==Athletics== Mount de Sales regularly competes in a number of interscholastic athletics in Class A of the Georgia High School Association. Teams compete at the varsity, junior varsity and C-team levels. Additionally, the school sponsors cheerleading and a band. Cavalier Fields is home to a football stadium and practice fields, soccer playing and practice fields, track, softball and baseball fields, tennis courts and concessions.
