    "text": "Since the 1968 Summer Olympics did not feature tennis as an official sport, two unofficial tournaments were held during the Games: a Demonstration tournament and an Exhibition tournament. The Exhibition tournament was played from 24 to 26 October 1968 on the clay courts of the Chapultepec Sports Center in Mexico City, Mexico. All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a team had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6\u20136 draw. Due to the short length of the tournament, no third place match was played, and both semifinal losers received bronze medals. Soviets Zaiga Jansone and Vladimir Korotkov won the tournament by defeating American Peaches Bartkowicz and West German Ingo Buding 7\u20135, 6\u20134 in the final. Brazilian Suzana Petersen and also Soviet Teimuraz Kakulia, alongside French Rosa Mar\u00eda Darmon and Pierre Darmon, have won bronze medals. ==Seeds== No seeds were given for this tournament. ==Draw== ==References== ==External links== * Official Results Archive (ITF) Exhibition ",
