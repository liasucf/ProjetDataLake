In terms of the section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, Local Authorities were prohibited from promoting in specified category of schools, \"the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\". The Act did have other effects also, and was rather a mixed bag of changes. Part I introduced compulsory tendering of contracts for certain types of activities. Part III allowed housing authorities to provide financial assistance to people living in private property. Section 38 abolished duty on dog licences. == See also == *Direct service organisation *Section 28 ==External links== === UK Legislation === ==== Commencement Orders ==== * * ==== Regulations ==== * * * * * * Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1988 Category:Local government legislation in England and Wales ",
