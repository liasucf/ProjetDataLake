    "text": "The Abbot of Abingdon was the head (or abbot) of Anglo-Saxon and eventually Benedictine house of Abingdon Abbey at Abingdon-on-Thames in northern Berkshire (present-day Oxfordshire), England. The following is a list of abbots of Abingdon: ==Fictional abbots== Historian Susan E. Kelly regards the traditional first six abbots as fictional: \"There is good reason to think that in most cases their names were simply plucked from early charters available in the abbey's archive, the majority of which would seem to have had no connection with an early minister at Abingdon; there is no very convincing evidence that the historians had access to independent, reliable sources of information. The 'history' of the pre-\u00c6thelwoldian minister seems to a very large extent to represent a fictional reconstruction\".Kelly, Charters of Abingdon, part 1 Probably fictional abbots: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! width=\"17%\" | Name ! width=\"83%\" | Comments |- valign=\"top\" | H\u00e6ha, also Hean | The legendary first abbot of Abingdon, but, according to Kelly, more probably an abbot of Bradfield, his name having been plucked from a charter dated 704,S 245 with others, in order to replace the lost early history of Abingdon Abbey. |- valign=\"top\" | Cumma | Cumma is mentioned in a forged charter of King \u00c6thelbald,S 93 but \"no Abbot Cumma is known from other sources\". It is, however, generally considered that the village of Cumnor is named after him. |- valign=\"top\" | Hr\u00e6thhun | A Hr\u00e6thhun was styled abbot of Abingdon in a charter dated 811,S 166 but the charter was forged, probably using the name of Hr\u00e6thhun (d. 839/40), bishop of Leicester. Kelly therefore excludes him from the list of Abingdon abbots. |- valign=\"top\" | Alhhard | Kelly suggests that the name was plucked from the witness list of a charter,S 1201 with others, in order to reconstruct the lost early history of the Abbey of Abingdon. |- valign=\"top\" | Cynath | A Cynath, abbot of Evesham, mistakenly listed by the compiler of the De Abbatibus Abbendoniae as an abbot of Abingdon. |- valign=\"top\" | Godescealc | Godescealc's name occurs in three charters, all of them forgeries, and was later extracted from these documents and used in the construction of a spurious early history of the Abbey of Abingdon. |} ==Abbots== seal Another abbey seal, belonging to John Sante The historic abbots, right up to the dissolution of the abbey in 1538, are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! width=\"25%\" | Name ! width=\"20%\" | In office ! width=\"55%\" | Comments |- valign=\"top\" | Saint \u00c6thelwold of Winchester | c. 955 \u2013 c. 964 | later Bishop of Winchester |- valign=\"top\" | Osgar | c. 964 \u2013 984 | |- valign=\"top\" | Eadwine | 985 \u2013 990 | |- valign=\"top\" | Wulfgar | 990 \u2013 1016 | |- valign=\"top\" | \u00c6thelsige | 1016 \u2013 1018 | |- valign=\"top\" | \u00c6thelwine | 1018 \u2013 1030 | |- valign=\"top\" | Siward | 1030 \u2013 1044 | |- valign=\"top\" | \u00c6thelstan | c. 1044 \u2013 1047/1048 | |- valign=\"top\" | Spearhafoc | c. 1047/1048 \u2013 1051 | a famous goldsmith, later Bishop-Elect of London, who absconded with a large treasure |- valign=\"top\" | Rodulf | 1051 \u2013 1052 | |- valign=\"top\" | Ordric | 1052 \u2013 1066 | |- valign=\"top\" | Ealdred | 1066 \u2013 1071 | |- valign=\"top\" | Adelelm | 1071 \u2013 1083 | Norman abbot |- valign=\"top\" | Rainald | 1084 \u2013 1097 | Norman abbot |- valign=\"top\" | Faritius | 1100 \u2013 1117 | Norman abbot |- valign=\"top\" | vacant | 1117 \u2013 1121 | Knowles, Brooke and London (2001), The heads of religious houses: England & Wales, I. 940\u20131216, pp. 24-5. |- valign=\"top\" | Vincent | 1121 \u2013 1130 | |- valign=\"top\" | Ingulph | 1130 \u2013 1159 | |- valign=\"top\" | Walkelin | 1159 \u2013 1164 | |- valign=\"top\" | vacant | 1164 \u2013 1165 | held by the king |- valign=\"top\" | none | 1165 \u2013 1175 | held in commendam by Godfrey, bishop of St Asaph |- valign=\"top\" | vacant | 1175 | |- valign=\"top\" | Roger | 1175 \u2013 1185 | |- valign=\"top\" | vacant | 1185 \u2013 1186 | vacant for half a year |- valign=\"top\" | Alvred | 1186 \u2013 1189 | |- valign=\"top\" | Hugh | 1189/1190 \u2013 c. 1221 | Smith and London (2001), The heads of religious houses: England & Wales, II. 1216\u20131377, pp. 16-8. |- valign=\"top\" | Robert of Hendred (Henreth) | 1221 \u2013 1234 | |- valign=\"top\" | Luke | 1234 \u2013 1241? | |- valign=\"top\" | John de Blosmeville | 1241 \u2013 1256 | |- valign=\"top\" | William of Newbury | 1256 \u2013 1260 | |- valign=\"top\" | Henry of Frilford (Frilleford) | 1260 \u2013 1261 | |- valign=\"top\" | Robert of Hendred | 1261 \u2013 1289 | |- valign=\"top\" | Nicholas of Culham | 1289 \u2013 1306 | |- valign=\"top\" | Richard of Bishops Cleeve | 1306 \u2013 1315 | |- valign=\"top\" | John of Sutton | 1315 \u2013 1322 | |- valign=\"top\" | John de Canyng (Canynges) | 1322 \u2013 1328 | |- valign=\"top\" | Robert of Garford | 1328 \u2013 1332 | |- valign=\"top\" | William (of Cumnor (Comenor(e)) | 1332 \u2013 1335 | |- valign=\"top\" | Roger of Thame (Tame) | 1335 \u2013 1361 | |- valign=\"top\" | Peter of Hanney | 1361 \u2013 1399 | |- valign=\"top\" | Richard de Salford | 1401 | Ditchfield and Page, ed, Victoria History of Berkshire, pp. 57-62. |- valign=\"top\" | John Dorset | 1415 | |- valign=\"top\" | Richard Boxore | 1421/2 \u2013 1427 | |- valign=\"top\" | Thomas Salford | 1427 | |- valign=\"top\" | Ralph Hamme | 1428 \u2013 1435 | |- valign=\"top\" | William Ashendon | 1435 | |- valign=\"top\" | John Sante | 1468 | |- valign=\"top\" | Thomas Rowland | 1496 | |- valign=\"top\" | Alexander Shottisbrook | 1504 | |- valign=\"top\" | John Coventry | 1508 | |- valign=\"top\" | Thomas Pentecost (= Rowland) | 1511/1512 \u2013 1538 | |} ==Notes== == References == * * * * * Category:Lists of abbots Category:History of Oxfordshire Abbot of Abingdon Abbot of Abingdon ",
