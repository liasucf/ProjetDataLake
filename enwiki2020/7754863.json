    "text": "Tainan Airport terminal building Tainan Airport runway Tainan Airport (; formally \"\") is a commercial airport located in South District, Tainan, Taiwan. It is shared with Republic of China Air Force Tainan AFB. In January 2011, the Civil Aeronautics Administration approved the airport to handle international flights. ==History== In 1935 during the era of Japanese rule, Tainan Airport was proposed by the Tainan Prefecture government due to the need for civil transportation in southern Taiwan. The airport was opened on June 26, 1937 with regular flights to Matsuyama Airport (modern-day Taipei Songshan Airport) operated by Japan Air Transport. After World War II broke out, this airport was converted to a base for the Tainan Air Group. During the war this airport was named Eineisho Airport by the United States Armed Forces, to distinguish it from other two smaller airports located in now Yongkang and Gueiren District.08\u3001\u65e5\u6cbb\u4e0b\u81fa\u5357\u6c38\u5eb7\u6a5f\u5834\u7684\u6642\u7a7a\u8a18\u61b6 - \u570b\u53f2\u9928\u81fa\u7063\u6587\u737b\u9928 After the Republic of China government took over Taiwan this airport was handed over to Republic of China Air Force while still maintaining civil flights. Between 1957 and 1979 this airport was stationed by the United States Air Force, once equipped with tactical nuclear weapons on F-4 aircraft from Clark AB with pilots from Clark's 405th Air Expeditionary Wing on alert. From 12 March - 1966 to 31 July 1974.\u53f0\u5357\u66fe\u6709\u6838\u6b66\u57fa\u5730 \u6709\u4eba\u898b\u904e\u6838\u5f48 The 868th Tactical Missile Squadron stationed here from 1958 to 1962, which operated MGM-1 Matadors, probably under the ultimate control of the United States Taiwan Defense Command.The 405th Air Expeditionary Wing of the U.S. Air Force sent units of the 510th Fighter Squadron equipped with F-100D Super Sabre fighters to Tainan Air Base from November 1965 to August 1967. Air Asia Corporation, headquartered in this airport, prospered during Vietnam War due to the need for aircraft maintenance by the United States Armed Forces. During the Cold War the United States deployed nuclear weapons on Taiwan. Nuclear weapons are known to have been stored at Tainan Air Force Base until their withdrawal was ordered in 1972. It was the third busiest domestic airport after Taipei Songshan Airport and Kaohsiung Airport until the Taiwan High Speed Rail was inaugurated. With passenger numbers dropping significantly, Far Eastern Air Transport suspended its service between Tainan Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport on 1 March 2008, ending the carrier's 50-year service history at Tainan Airport. Its competitor, TransAsia Airways, also had to downgrade the aircraft it used from a jet (Airbus A320) to a turboprop (ATR 72) to maintain revenue, and finally decided to service through the airport as of 1 August 2008. Because of the shared use with the Air Force, the airport terminal was built quite a distance away from the airfield. Passengers disembark at the apron and board shuttle buses to the terminal. The shared use with the Air Force also means some flights have to be cancelled when the Air Force conducts exercises. In January 2011, the Civil Aeronautics Administration approved the airport to handle international flights. First scheduled International flights began on 18 July 2013 to Hong Kong, with a 3 times weekly service by China Airlines using Boeing 737-800s. Since March 2014 this flight's frequency increases daily but aircraft is downgraded to smaller Embraer E-190, operated by China Airlines' subsidiary Mandarin Airlines. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== ==Accidents and incidents== On 24 February 1969, Far Eastern Air Transport Flight 104, a Handley Page Dart Herald with 36 passengers and crew board, crashed while attempting an emergency landing at Tainan. Everyone on board was killed. On 16 April 1977, a FEAT Douglas C-47A B-247 was damaged beyond economic repair in a landing accident. On 21 March 2003, TransAsia Airways flight 543 (Airbus A321 registration B-22603) on a flight from Taipei Songshan Airport to Tainan Airport, collided with a truck that was on runway 36R. None of the 175 passengers and crew were killed or injured but the two occupants in the truck were injured and the aircraft was written off. ==See also== * Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Taiwan) * Transport in Taiwan * List of airports in Taiwan == References == ==External links== *Wikimapia - Tainan Airport *Web Site - Tainan Airport Category:Airports in Taiwan Category:Airports established in 1937 Category:Buildings and structures in Tainan Category:Republic of China Air Force ",
