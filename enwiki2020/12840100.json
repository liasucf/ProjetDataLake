    "text": "Pluchea sericea, commonly called arrowweed or Cachanilla (Mexico), is a rhizomatous evergreen shrub of riparian areas in the lower Sonoran Desert and surrounding areas. It is common in the lower Colorado River valley of California, Nevada and Arizona, as far east as Texas, and in northern Mexico where it often forms dense impenetrable thickets. It was once used medicinally by Native Americans as an antidiarrheal and eyewash. Other traditional uses include thatching, arrowmaking and food, especially the edible root.Ethnobotany ==References== ==External links== * Calflora: Pluchea sericea (Arrow weed, Arrowweed) *Jepson eFlora (TJM2) treatment *USDA Plants Profile *UC CalPhotos gallery sericea Category:Flora of Northwestern Mexico Category:Flora of California Category:Flora of the South-Central United States Category:Flora of the Southwestern United States Category:Flora of the Sonoran Deserts Category:Flora of the California desert regions Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Natural history of the Mojave Desert Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine es:Pluchea ",
