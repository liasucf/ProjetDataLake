    "text": "The Cedar Grove Cemetery is a non-sectarian rural cemetery in New London, Connecticut. It was established in 1851 on 39 acres and designed by Dr. Horatio Stone. The cemetery is located at the intersection of Broad Street and Jefferson Avenue. ==Points of interest== As New London developed in the late 19th century, remains from earlier cemeteries in the city were relocated to the Cedar Grove Cemetery. The cemetery features the Comrades Monument, which was erected about 1900 by the Grand Army of the Republic to honor Civil War veterans buried in the cemetery. The monument is about 23 feet tall and features a life-sized figure of a Civil War soldier on top of a pedestal. The cemetery has been a place of burial for leading citizens of New London. It is the resting place for a governor of Connecticut, two United States senators, ten members of Congress, a member of the Continental Congress and a recipient of the Medal of Honor. ==Notable interments== * Frank Bosworth Brandegee United States Senator * Henry Burbeck Brigadier General * Thomas H.
