It is probable that they were all sons of Oshere, although the paternity of \u00c6thelheard and \u00c6thelberht is not explicitly stated in surviving documents. In 692, together with \u00c6thelweard, issued a charter to Abbess Cuthswith, and also witnessed a charter of \u00c6thelred, King of Mercia, together with \u00c6thelweard, \u00c6thelberht, and \u00c6thelric. In 693 the four brothers witnessed a charter issued by their father Oshere. The only time that he is styled rex appears to be in the possibly genuine witness list attached to a spurious charter attributed to Cenred, King of Mercia in 709 . ==See also== Hwicce ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hwiccan monarchs Category:8th-century English monarchs ",
