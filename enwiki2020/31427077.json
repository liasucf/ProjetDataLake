Honors in various categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.\" ==History== The Best Children's Album award is given to recording artists for works containing quality performances aimed at children. The award has had several minor name changes: *From 1959 to 1960 the award was known as Best Recording for Children *In 1961 it was awarded as Best Album Created for Children *From 1962 to 1968 it was awarded as Best Recording for Children *In 1969 no award was given in the Children's Field *From 1970 to 1991 it was awarded as Best Recording for Children *From 1992 to 1993 it was awarded as Best Album for Children *From 1994 to 2011 the award category was split into Best Musical Album for Children and Best Spoken Word Album for Children *From 2012 to 2019 it was known as Best Children's Album, after the Best Musical Album for Children and Best Spoken Word Album for Children categories were merged (basically returning to the situation as it was prior to 1994, although with a small name change). *From 2020 spoken word children's albums will be moved to the Best Spoken Word Album category.Billboard.com, 19 June 2019 The category will be renamed Best Children's Music Album. The 2012 restructuring of these and other categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards. According to the Academy, \"[it] passed the proposal that a return to one category for all types of recordings for children, as it was from 1958-1993, would be most appropriate in this new context.\" Grammy Awards Restructuring . ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:250px;\" | Winner(s) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:175px;\" | Work ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nominees ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref. |- ! scope=row|1959 | (artist) |\"The Chipmunk Song\" | * * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1960 | (artist) |Peter and the Wolf | * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1961 | (artist) |Let's All Sing with The Chipmunks | * * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1962 | (artist) |Prokofiev: Peter And The Wolf | * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1963 | (artist) |Saint-Sa\u00ebns: Carnival of the Animals/Britten: Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra | * * * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1964 | (artist) |Bernstein Conducts For Young People | * * * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1965 | & Julie Andrews (artists) | \"Mary Poppins\" | * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1966 | (artist) |Dr. Seuss Presents: \"Fox in Sox\" and \"Green Eggs and Ham\" | * * * * | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1967 | (artist) |\"Dr. Seuss Presents - \"If I Ran The Zoo\" And \"Sleep Book\"\" | * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1968 | (artist) |\"Dr. Seuss: How The Grinch Stole Christmas\" | * * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1970 | (artist) |Peter, Paul and Mommy | * * * * | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=row|1971 | & Thomas Z.
