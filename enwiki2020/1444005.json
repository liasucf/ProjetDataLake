She also placed 7th in the IFBB World Amateur Bodybuilding Championships in 2000. She competed at a weight ranging from 115-125 pounds at a height of 5'3\" and was known for a physique that was particularly well-developed for someone of her age, as she was in her twenties. At a weight of 125 pounds, Brantalova was able to bench press 180 pounds for eight repetitions. In addition to bodybuilding, Brantalova has used her muscular physique and strength to pursue a career in submission style wrestling in which she wrestled against female and even male opponents. She was a small but surprisingly strong wrestler. She has made several bodybuilding videos. She is known for taking on fellow IFBB competitor Charlene Rink in a topless wrestling match that Pavla is spent and defeated by Rink.
