    "text": "In Ethiopia and Eritrea, the terms Tukr\u012br (Amharic) and Tu _k_ rir (Tigrinya) are used to designate persons of West or Central African origin. The terms derives from the city and kingdom of Takr\u016br that thrived on the lower Senegal River in the eleventh century. The place was well-known to Arab geographers, and an inhabitant of Takr\u016br or of West Africa in general was called in Arabic a Takr\u016br\u012b (plural Tak\u0101r\u012br or Tak\u0101rna) from the 14th century onward. The nisba al-Takr\u016br\u012b was a common surname for one of West African descent. The Ethiopian terms are derived from the Arabic.Wolbert Smidt, \"Tukrir\", in Siegbert Uhlig and Alessandro Bausi (eds.), Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, Vol. 4: O-X (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2010), pp. 998\u20131000. The Tukr\u012br primarily inhabit the western edge of the Ethiopian Highlands. They are overwhelmingly Muslim. They are mainly Fulani and Hausa in origin from the region of the former Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire. There were two major periods of immigration from West Africa to Ethiopia. The first coincided with the Fula jihads that lasted from 1804 until 1842; the second with the Scramble for Africa, when West Africa was colonized by Europeans between 1885 and 1914. In the 19th century there was a Tukr\u012br sheikhdom with its capital at Metemma, sometimes owing tribute to Ethiopia and at other times to Egypt. It ended up dominated by Fur from the nearby Sultanate of Darfur. It sided with the Mahdists during the Mahdist War against Ethiopia (1885\u20131891) and disappeared with the Mahdists' defeat.'Umar Al-Naqar, \"Takrur: the History of a Name\", The Journal of African History 10:3 (1969), pp. 365\u2013374, at 366.Arthur E. Robinson, \"The Tekruri Sheikhs of Gallabat (S. E. Sudan)\", Journal of the Royal African Society 26:101 (1926), pp. 47\u201353. The term Fall\u0101ta (from Fulani) has largely replaced Tak\u0101r\u012br in the Sudan as a term for immigrants from West Africa. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Ethiopia Category:Ethnic groups in Eritrea Category:Senegambian ethnic groups ",
