Cole Waterman from Pop Matters says Secret Evil is \"one of 2014\u2019s most deftly sequenced, produced, written and performed albums.\" Jim Vorel of Paste Magazine calls Jessica Hernandez \"an ascendant star.\" Kevin \"Skwerl\" Cogill of antiquiet seemed blown away by the album saying, \"every once in awhile, something indisputably special wanders into our yard and stops us dead in our tracks.\" == Track listing == ==References== Category:2014 albums Category:Jessica Hernandez & the Deltas albums ",
