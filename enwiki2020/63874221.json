This budget occurs during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand and on the same day that the country exits the lockdown brought about by alert level 3. == Background == The 2020 budget was released in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which spread to New Zealand in late February 2020. In response to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, the country entered into a nationwide lockdown on the evening of 25 March, in which all non-essential businesses were closed. Because of the closure of businesses, the government offered a $12.1 billion wage subsidy scheme to offset employment costs in an attempt to keep as many New Zealanders as possible in their jobs. The original contents of the budget were set aside and replaced with a plan on how New Zealand will recover from the lasting effects of COVID-19, of which this budget is only the first step. Finance Minister Grant Robertson states that the economic recovery for New Zealand will create an extended operating deficit and increase debt to above previous targets, however he points out that New Zealand entered the COVID-19 crisis with a debt of below 20% of GDP compared to the United States with 90% and the United Kingdom with above 75%. The budget expands on the $12 billion New Zealand Upgrade Programme infrastructure project. == Major announcements == The 2020 budget includes allocating NZ$50 billion to the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, which will be spent on several areas including a NZ$3.2 billion wage subsidy scheme, business support, trades training support, a NZ$1.1 billion environmental jobs package, $900 million to support M\u0101ori, housing, and extending the school lunch programme.
