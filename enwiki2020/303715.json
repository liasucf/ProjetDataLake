    "text": "A heptathlon is a track and field combined events contest made up of seven events. The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and \u1f04\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (\u00e1thlos, or \u1f04\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \u00e1thlon, meaning \"feat\"). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete. There are two heptathlons \u2013 the women's heptathlon and the men's \u2013 composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984. ==Women's heptathlon== Tatyana Chernova, Jessica Ennis and Lilli Schwarzkopf racing in the final 800 m event at the 2012 Olympic heptathlon Women's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the athletics programme of the Olympics and at the IAAF World Championships. The IAAF Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two: * 100 metres hurdles * High jump * Shot put * 200 metres * Long jump * Javelin throw * 800 metres The heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added). It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Nafissatou Thiam, representing Belgium, is the 2016 Olympic Gold Medallist and reigning European Champion, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, representing Great Britain, is the current World Champion and Commonwealth Champion. Odile Ahouanwanou, Yekaterina Voronina, Kiara Reddingius, Luisarys Toledo and Ariana Ince hold the African, Asian, Oceanian, South American and NACAC (North American, Central American and Caribbean) titles respectively. Adriana Rodr\u00edguez, Marthe Koala, Swapna Barman and Elenani Tinai hold the Panamerican Games, African Games, Asian Games and Pacific Games titles respectively.Holders correct as of 2020. The European Games does not feature a heptathlon event. There is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day. ===Points system=== The heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated \"standard\" performance (for example, approximately 1.82 m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.\"London 2012: Jessica Ennis leads heptathlon after first day\", The Guardian, 3 August 2012 Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded. The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae: :Running events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles): ::P = a \\cdot (b - T)^c :Jumping events (high jump and long jump): ::P = a \\cdot (M - b)^c :Throwing events (shot put and javelin): ::P = a \\cdot (D - b)^c P is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events, as follows: {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Event!!a!!b!!c |- |200 metres||4.99087||42.5||1.81 |- |800 metres||0.11193||254||1.88 |- |100 metres hurdles||9.23076||26.7||1.835 |- |High jump||1.84523||75.0||1.348 |- |Long jump||0.188807||210||1.41 |- |Shot put||56.0211||1.50||1.05 |- |Javelin throw||15.9803||3.80||1.04 |} ===Benchmarks=== The following table shows the benchmark levels needed to earn 1000, 900, 800 and 700 points in each event. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" ! align=left|Event || 1000 pts || 900 pts || 800 pts || 700 pts || Unit |- | align=left| 100 m hurdles || 13.85 || 14.56 || 15.32 || 16.12 || Seconds |- | align=left| High jump || 1.82 || 1.74 || 1.66 || 1.57 || Metres |- | align=left| Shot put || 17.07 || 15.58 || 14.09 || 12.58 || Metres |- | align=left| 200 m || 23.80 || 24.86 || 25.97 || 27.14 || Seconds |- | align=left| Long jump || 6.48 || 6.17 || 5.84 || 5.50 || Metres |- | align=left| Javelin throw || 57.18 || 52.04 || 46.87 || 41.68 || Metres |- | align=left| 800 m || 2:07.63 || 2:14.52 || 2:21.77 || 2:29.47 || Minutes |} ===Women's world records compared with heptathlon bests=== Nataliya Dobrynska in the Osaka World Athletics Championships 2007 women's heptathlon {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%; text-align:right\" |- |+World records (WR) compared with heptathlon bests (HB) ! style=\"width:100px;\"| Event ! style=\"width:35px;\"| Type ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Athlete ! style=\"width:85px;\"| Record ! style=\"width:45px;\"| Score ! style=\"width:70px;\"| Percentage /Points difference ! style=\"width:135px;\"| Notes/Ref |- ! rowspan=3| 100 m hurdles |- | WR | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kendra Harrison || 12.20 s || 1248 || 97.29% || |- | HB | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jessica Ennis || 12.54 s || 1195 || \u221253 || |- ! rowspan=3| High jump |- | WR | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Stefka Kostadinova || 2.09 m || 1359 || 94.74% || |- | HB | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Nafissatou Thiam || 2.02 m || 1264 || \u221295 || |- ! rowspan=3| Shot put |- | WR | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Natalya Lisovskaya || 22.63 m || 1378 || 76.49% || |- | HB | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Austra Skujyt\u0117 || 17.31 m || 1016 || \u2212362 || |- ! rowspan=3| 200 m |- | WR | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Florence Griffith Joyner || 21.34 s || 1251 || 95.70% || |- valign=\"top\" | HB | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Jackie Joyner Kersee || 22.30 s || 1150 || \u2212101 || |- ! rowspan=3| Long jump |- | WR | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Galina Chistyakova || 7.52 m || 1351 || 96.68% || |- | HB | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jackie Joyner Kersee || 7.27 m || 1264 || \u221287 || |- ! rowspan=5| JavelinWomen's javelin was redesigned in 1999 and all records started fresh.

It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two: * 60 metres * long jump * shot put * high jump * 60 metres hurdles * pole vault * 1000 metres The scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition. ===Benchmarks=== The following table shows the minimum benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
