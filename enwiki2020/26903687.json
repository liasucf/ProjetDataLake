On December 12, 2008, by legal act 142/2008, the Icelandic parliament established an investigation commission to, in the words of the law, 'seek the truth behind the events leading to, and the causes of, the downfall of the Icelandic banks in October 2008, and related events', 'granting the Commission 'exceptional investigative powers in order to appease the demonstrators and to meet the public's demand for answers as to why their three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki, and Kaupthing, had collapsed'.Gudrun Johnsen, Bringing Down the Banking System: Lessons from Iceland (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), pp. 48 and 47 respectively. As well as arising from popular pressure, the law was passed 'under the leadership of the speaker of the parliament, Sturla Bodvarsson, and pressure from opposition leaders such as Steingrimur J. Sigfusson'.Gudrun Johnsen, Bringing Down the Banking System: Lessons from Iceland (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 51. On December 30, the three members of the commission were appointed, being people 'with impeccable reputation': Supreme Court Justice P\u00e1ll Hreinsson, who served as chairman; the Parliamentary Ombudsman Tryggvi Gunnarsson; and Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Benediktsd\u00f3ttir, associate chair in Economics at Yale University.Gudrun Johnsen, Bringing Down the Banking System: Lessons from Iceland (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 47. Although driven by popular protest, the establishment of the SIC was not enough to placate the protesters, and the government fell in the so-called 'Kitchenware Revolution'.Gudrun Johnsen, Bringing Down the Banking System: Lessons from Iceland (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), pp. 47-48. The commission hired 48 employees or contractors, with five teams, including legal, auditors, ethics, and quantitative analysis teams; some foreign analysts were hired, including Mark Flannery of the University of Florida and Eric Talley of the University of California, Berkeley.Gudrun Johnsen, Bringing Down the Banking System: Lessons from Iceland (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 52.

The report was made available to the public both in print and online and a summary with excerpts from the report was also published online in English. Despite the deep penetration of Icelandic institutions by people personally connected with the deregulation of Iceland's banks and the associated banking boom, 'fortunately, and perhaps amazingly [...], there was little evidence in the final report [...] of a whitewash. The report turned out to be a detailed description of failure, incompetence, and mishandling, often with shocking direct quotes from SIC interrogations of major government figures or business leaders'.Gudrun Johnsen, Bringing Down the Banking System: Lessons from Iceland (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 49. ==Artistic responses== The report was performed in a non-stop, 146-hour reading by the Reykjavik City Theatre from April 12\u201318, 2010.
