He won the 2011 San Francisco International Comedy Competition and the 2009 Seattle International Comedy Competition. Originally from Austin, Texas, Kent resided in Los Angeles during his development as a comic, moving back to his hometown in 2011 with his partner, Rachel Dory, and their two daughters. He is also known for his stand-up comedy appearances on Showtime and Nickelodeon, and as a series regular on the NBC show Last Comic Standing (seasons 1 & 3). His comedy has been critically acclaimed by Rolling Stone and XM Radio, who called his debut CD \"An instant classic\". ==Early years== Kent attended Hyde Park Baptist Private School in Austin, where he lettered in Varsity Basketball and Cross Country. He was almost molested several times but graduated in 1992. After high school, Kent attended the University of Texas at Austin but dropped out in 1994 to move to Los Angeles and pursue stand-up comedy. ==Cancer battle== In 2003 Kent landed his first staff writing job on The Best Damn Sports Show Period. While writing for Best Damn, he was diagnosed with stage III Hodgkin's lymphoma. He began undergoing chemotherapy one day a week while continuing to work. After three months of chemotherapy and 35 days of radiation therapy Kent was pronounced in remission. Shortly after finishing treatment, he auditioned and was subsequently chosen as a series regular for Last Comic Standing Season One. Almost immediately after Last Comic Standing wrapped, Kent received news that his cancer had recurred. Facing a grim prognosis, he opted to undergo an intensive chemotherapeutic procedure known as an autologous bone marrow transplant which involved radically high doses of chemotherapy and long stays in the hospital. During one stay at City of Hope National Medical Center Kent developed an infection in his chest port and lost over 90 pounds. His doctors told him he had a 50% chance to live a year if he survived treatment, and he was released from the hospital in October 2003, returning to stand-up soon after. ==Later career== Kent was the first person voted off on Season 1 of Last Comic Standing. Kent competed on season 3 as well, advancing through 6 of 8 total episodes. In 2005, two years after his treatment, Kent was asked to give the keynote address at the 29th Annual City of Hope Bone Marrow Transplant Reunion. Since then he has regularly spoken and performed at cancer fundraisers, and in 2011 shared a bill with Will Ferrell at the Cancer for College Fundraiser. In 2009 Kent won the 30th annual Seattle International Comedy Competition and appeared on Showtime's Green Collar Comedy Slam. In 2010 Kent toured the UK, appearing at The Stand and other clubs throughout Great Britain.

In 2010 Kent released his second CD, Waiting for the Rapture for Uproar Entertainment. The Laugh Button has called it \"... a jolt of hilarious though sometimes painful honesty.
