Early in the game, Radulovic allied herself with Russell Hantz, a former player of the American version of Survivor, but was blindsided when he was voted out only four days into the game. After Hantz was voted out, Radulovic kept a low profile and was able to make it through the tribe phase of the game while only going to four tribal councils. Going into the merge, she found herself in a tight alliance with Brian Lake and the two were able to make it to the final six along with Shonee Fairfax and Fenella McGowan, two allies they made during the merge. At the final six, the two remaining members of the opposing alliance, Shane Gould and Sharn Coombes, were successfully able to blindside McGowan using a Hidden Immunity Idol due to a mistake Lake made when splitting the votes. Angry with Lake, Fairfax joined the opposing alliance and opted to vote out Lake at the next tribal council. After Lake had lost the immunity challenge, the opposing alliance changed their mind due to fear that Lake had a Hidden Immunity Idol and voted out Radulovic in a 3-2 vote. She placed 5th and became the 7th member of the jury, ultimately voting for Gould to win. ==References== ==External links== *Miss Universe Australia Official website *See Miss Universe Australia Monika Radulovic interviews *Monika Radulovic reveals what really happened at the Miss World 2016 *Miss Universe profile Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina emigrants to Australia Category:Australian beauty pageant winners Category:Australian female models Category:Models from Sydney Category:Australian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina descent Category:Australian people of Serbian descent Category:Miss Universe Australia winners Category:Miss Universe 2015 contestants Category:Western Sydney University alumni Category:People from Zavidovi\u0107i Category:People from Sydney Category:Yugoslav Wars refugees Category:Australian Survivor contestants ",
