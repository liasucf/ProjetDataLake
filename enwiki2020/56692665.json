    "text": "Michael Roman is an American political operative. Roman was Director of Special Projects and Research for President Donald Trump, from January 20, 2017, until April 2018. In his personal blog, Election Journal, Roman self- describes as a \u201cveteran political consultant and private investigator.\u201d Politico and The New York Times describe Roman as an opposition researcher. It is worth nothing that Mike Roman is not the same person as 3M CEO Mike Roman. ==Career== He began his career as a Republican Party activist in Philadelphia, his hometown. Early in his career Roman was a political consultant in his home state of Pennsylvania and in New Jersey. He was director of Election Day operations at the Republican National Committee. He has been employed by the George W. Bush, Rudy Giuliani and Sen. John McCain presidential campaigns. Roman also served as Chief of Staff to former Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling. Roman was a senior advisor on the Trump Campaign and headed up the election integrity program. Prior to joining the Trump presidential campaign, Roman headed up an intelligence gathering operation for Charles and David Koch, industrialists and high-profile GOP donors. The office, now defunct, \"conduct(ed) surveillance and intelligence gathering on... liberal opponents\" of conservative policies. Roman describes his blog, Election Journal, as dedicated to \"fraud, cheating, dirty tricks, absurdity and other election news.\" According to Richard L. Hasen, Chancellor's Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California, the blog appears to focus, \"only on incidents favoring Republican's claims against Democrats. During the 2008 presidential election, Election Monitoring, combined GoogleMaps, with Twitter, Flickr and YouTube to enable voters and poll watchers to post what they saw as instances of voter disenfranchise- ment and election fraud in a real time, online map. One scholar, while recognizing the non-verifiable nature of this approach, asserted that it \"opens up new potential for election monitoring that addresses some of the limitations that established and official (election monitoring organizations) face. ==White House role== Roman's role in the Trump White House as Director of Special Projects and Research, which Politico calls a \"a vague title that reveals almost nothing,\" has drawn attention because in previous administrations it was usual for opposition researchers to work for the campaign or on the staff of the presidential transition team, rather than directly for the White House. He left the White House in April 2018. ==References== Category:American political consultants Category:Trump administration personnel Category:Opposition research Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
