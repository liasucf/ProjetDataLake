Following a protracted development, the SW-4 entered service in 2002, the primary operator of the type has been the Polish Armed Forces. The SW-4 was further developed by PZL- \u015awidnik and corporate parent AgustaWestland into an optionally piloted vehicle, the SW-4 Solo. From 2016 onwards, the type has been marketed to civil operators as the AW009, while the SW-4 designation shall be continue to be used for the military market. ==Development== ===Origins=== The design of the SW-4 helicopter originates from the 1960s, during which period it was decided against proceeding to production with the SW-4 due to demand for military helicopters from various nations within the Warsaw Pact.Wastnage, Justin. \"PZL SW-4 prepares for certification within weeks\" Flight International, 21 May 2002. Around 1981, development work at PZL-Swidnik was started on a new four/five place light utility helicopter. The original design for the SW-4 called for it to be powered by a 300 kW (400 shp) PZL Rzeszow GTD350 turboshaft engine, as featured upon the prototype mockup. According to PZL- Swidnik, the early SW-4 could reach the rated top speed of about 240 km/h (130 kn) and a max range with auxiliary fuel tank about 900 km (485 nmi). Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent European restructuring, predominantly those countries that had formerly been members of the Warsaw Pact, the emerging political climate had allowed PZL-Swidnik to redesign the SW-4 to make use of a new foreign-built powerplant, the Allison (now Rolls- Royce) Model 250 turboshaft engine, which was 13% more powerful while consuming 30% less fuel than the originally-intended GTD350 powerplant. Other changes were made to the design, which ultimately bore little resemblance to its earlier form. In 1995, the SW-4 project was formally re-launched and, in addition to the switch of power plant, the rotorcraft's design was substantially modified. Design alternations include the adoption of epoxy resin-based composite materials for the fuselage structure, further streamlining of the fuselage, and a revised tail and tail boom made primarily of aluminium. SW-4 idling prior to takeoff, 2006 In December 1994, the project had proceeded to ground testing of a non-flying prototype. Subsequently, a pair of flight-capable prototypes were assembled to support the development program. The first prototype was planned to perform an initial flight in January 1995, however this was delayed due to vibration issues during engine runs. On 26 October 1996, the SW-4 was reported as having performing its first flight; an official first flight was conducted on 29 October 1996.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \".\" Flight International, 17 November 1996.\"Current Helicopter Programs.\" Flying, February 2000. Vol. 127, No. 2. p. 46. By May 2002, the two prototypes had accumulated a total of 640 flight hours. PZL-Swidnik targeted US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) FAR Part 27 certification for the SW-4. it was believed that the program should be capable of producing production models by 1999. A decision to redesign the main rotor head resulted in considerable delays to the flight testing program; during this time, other changes were made to the rotorcraft, included the horizontal stabilizer being extended and improvements of the hydraulic systems. In 2002, the first production model SW-4, which was equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine, was approaching receipt of certification from the Polish civil aviation authority. Certification for use in other markets is to be made upon customer request, targeting a $700,000 price at the time. On 1 October 2002, serial production of the SW-4 formally began.Jaxa-Malakowski, Ryszard. \"SW-4 five-seater goes into series production.\" Flight International, 1 October 2002. On 27 September 2007, type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was received.\"EASA Type Certificate: Data Sheet - PZL SW-4.\" EASA, 7 December 2011. Following on from the certification of the Rolls-Royce model, PZL Swidnik pursued a separate re-certification for a modified SW-4 fitted with a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW200 powerplant as an alternative option.\"PZL-Swidnik set to re-engine SW-4 helicopter.\" Flight International, 8 July 2003. ===Further development=== The SW-4 as planned was expected to fulfill a range of utility missions ranging from civil and executive transport to Medevac, police, border patrol duties and some of military pilot training tasks; however, for several years the Polish military had served as the type's only customer. In Polish service, 24 SW-4, with a military name Puszczyk, has been used as a training rotorcraft, replacing the Mil Mi-2, at \"The Center of Aviation Education and Training at D\u0119blin\" (O\u015brodka Szkolenia Lotniczego w D\u0119blinie).\"Polish Air Force to purchase SW-4.\" PZL-\u015awidnik, May 2002.Bondaryk, Pawe\u0142.
