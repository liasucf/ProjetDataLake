    "text": "Portrait of Kanzan Bamboo and a Sparrow Kao ( early 15th century) was a Japanese priest-painter whose work is considered typical of early Muromachi painting. He is especially known for his depiction of the legendary monk Kensu (Hsien-tzu in Chinese) at the moment he achieved enlightenment. This type of painting was executed with quick brushstrokes and a minimum of detail. ==See also== *List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings) Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Japanese painters Category:Kamakura period Buddhist monks Category:Zenga ",
