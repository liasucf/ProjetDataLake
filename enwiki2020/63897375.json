    "text": "Tosh Basco, known by her performance name Boychild (stylized in lowercase), is an American performance artist, dancer, and photographer. Basco uses her body as a vehicle for performing, often referring to \"the physical body as a glitch in the digital age.\" Her signature style includes a shaved head, full-body makeup, tinted contact lenses, and neon lighting. She lives and works in California. == Work == Basco grew up in San Francisco during the 1990s and experimented with drag at an early age and cites Dia Dear as an early influence. She states that the birth of the Boychild persona occurred during months of research into clowns, healers, and non-western cultures, medicine men, shamans, witches. Basco walked in Hood By Air's 2013 spring/summer show with signature white-out contacts lenses and glowing mouthpieces alongside A$AP Rocky. Later that year, Basco toured with singer Mykki Blanco and began collaborating with multimedia polymath Wu Tsang. Basco's collaboration with Wu Tsang has led to numerous performances, videos, and other projects, such as Moved by the Motion, which includes cellist Patrick Belaga, dancer Josh Johnson, electronic musician Asma Maroof, and poet Fred Moten. == References == Category:American performance artists Category:Artists from San Francisco Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
