The facility houses a maximum of 1189 inmates at a mix of security levels. The death of inmate Justin Campos on October 1, 2013, raised questions about safety in the facility. After Campos was killed by another inmate, officials offered his family contradictory versions of his whereabouts at the time, withheld basic information from his mother, and sent her invoices for more than $4000 for providing heavily redacted public records she requested. ==References== Category:Prisons in Florida Category:Buildings and structures in Madison County, Florida Category:1989 establishments in Florida ",
