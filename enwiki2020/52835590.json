The album entered the charts at number 31 in the United Kingdom, the highest chart position there since 1992's Sleepwalking. * Below top 100: Compared to the previous album Escape from the Shadow Garden, the album went slightly back in the European charts, charting 20 in Germany, 23 in Sweden, and 26 in Switzerland. The album also became the first Magnum record to chart in Austria, peaking at 57. Bob Catley stated that contrary to what the name of the title track may imply, the song is not a critique of religion; rather, it criticizes cult leaders who exploit their followers' shortcomings to present themselves as superior.NI ROCKS Interview with BOB CATLEY from MAGNUM, 18 May 2016.
