With Alcobia, Albino and Francisco Ferreira as competition, he was seen as back-up, playing only 15 games between league and cup in 1943\u201344. Nonetheless, he played all seven games in the campaign winning run in the Portuguese Cup, which included an 8\u20130 trashing of Estoril in the final. With the breakthrough of Moreira in 1944\u201345, Silva dropped further in the pecking order, playing only 11 games, five of those in the league, enough to secure another honour, his first Primeira Divis\u00e3o title. He left the club in 1945 with 26 games played and 2 goals scored. ==Honours== ;Benfica *Primeira Divis\u00e3o: 1944\u201345 *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 1943\u201344 ==References== General * Specific Category:Year of birth missing Category:Possibly living people Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:S.L.
