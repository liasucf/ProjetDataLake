    "text": "The 1977 Arizona Wildcats football team represented the University of Arizona in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) during the 1977 NCAA Division I football season. In their first season under head coach Tony Mason, the Wildcats compiled a 5\u20137 record (3\u20134 against WAC opponents), finished in fifth place in the WAC, and outscored their opponents, 256 to 250. The team played its home games in Arizona Stadium in Tucson, Arizona. This was Arizona\u2019s (and rival Arizona State\u2019s) final season as members of the WAC and joined the Pac-8 Conference, which became the Pac-10, in 1978. The team's statistical leaders included Marc Lunsford with 1,344 passing yards, Derriak Anderson with 568 rushing yards, and Harry Holt with 423 receiving yards. Linebacker Corky Ingraham led the team with 153 total tackles.2016 Media Guide, p. 86. ==Personnel== ==Season notes== *This was the last season that Arizona played in the WAC. In addition, this was also the last year that Arizona and New Mexico played an annual rivalry together. The Wildcats defeated the Lobos in the 1977 meeting to reclaim the Kit Carson Rifle, the rivalry\u2019s trophy. The rifle was retired in 1997 and is currently on display in Tucson at the Arizona campus, and has not been played for in the two schools\u2019 future matchups. Both schools are seeking a new trophy when the rivalry is revived in the future. *This was the first season that Arizona played twelve regular-season games. This feat would not occur again until 1988. ==References== Arizona Category:Arizona Wildcats football seasons Arizona Wildcats football team ",
