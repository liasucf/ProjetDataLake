Akman said that the song was made and composed by Mehmet Ali Sezer, who had also composed the song \"Seni R\u00fcyamda G\u00f6rsem\", and claimed that it was in fact Anna RF who had stolen a Turkish piece and said that he had already bought the copyright of the song from Mehmet Ali Sezer.

Akman, who said that he tries to create his own style, believes that no one has the same style of music as his. == Reception == Sabahs author Meltem F\u0131ratl\u0131 wrote in her article \"High schoolers reached the top\" on 24 December 2016, that Akman \"is a musician who has brought his fans to the peak. With his music, he reaches out to a large number of people, and has become the voice of a quiet majority.\" On 19 January 2017, Mevl\u00fct Tezel from Sabah published an article titled \"\u00c7a\u011fatay Akman deception\" and claimed that Akman's song, in fact, had fake views on YouTube and gave spurious social messages, and that Akman's only desire was to become famous. In his article for H\u00fcrriyet, published on 8 March 2017, Cengiz Semerci\u011flu argued that \u00c7a\u011fatay Akman was an 18-year-old guy with great talent who had emerged from the difficult conditions in Zeytinburnu. K\u00e2muran Akdemir from Gecce wrote the article \"\u00c7a\u011fatay Akman's success!\" that was published on 26 October 2017. He said the artist was able to become famous with only one song and he would not be able to have the same success in music in the future. He also argued that his supporters were being slipped up by his songs on Bizim Hikaye. Ali Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu from Milliyet saw the success of the artist due to the power of internet and to the issues addressed by him in the song \"Gece G\u00f6lgenin Rahat\u0131na Bak\". In his article for Milliyet, titled \"Turkish Films in Mexican TV\" which was published in May 2018, Sina Kolo\u011flu discussed the song \"Bizim Hikaye\" by Akman and wrote: \"The piece was nice and he did the job well. I liked his words and style, and with his use of the verse 'We are Zeytinburnu street children', I wish him all the best.\" Writing for Milliyet, Anda\u00e7 \u00dczel criticized Akman in his article, titled \"At the age of 20 he wrote about himself: What is 'Being \u00c7a\u011fatay Akman'?\", and questioned his decision for publishing an autobiography. == Discography == ;Singles * \"Gece G\u00f6lgenin Rahat\u0131na Bak\" (2016) * \"Sensin Benim En Derin Kuyum\" (2017) * \"Bizim Hikaye\" (2018) * \"Y\u00fcre\u011fim Davac\u0131\" (2018) * \"\u00c7ek Silah\u0131n\u0131 Daya G\u00f6\u011fs\u00fcme\" (2018) * \"Ben Ne \u0130nsanlar G\u00f6rd\u00fcm\" (Ahmet Sel\u00e7uk \u0130lkan Unutulmayan \u015eark\u0131lar, Vol. 2) (2018) * \"Hi\u00e7 B\u0131kmadan\" (feat.
