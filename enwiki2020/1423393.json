Andr\u00e9 Tacquet (23 June 1612 Antwerp - 22 December 1660 Antwerp, also referred to by his Latinized name Andrea TacquetO'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., \"Andrea Tacquet\", MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, University of St Andrews ) was a Brabantian mathematician and Jesuit priest. Tacquet adhered to the methods of the geometry of Euclid and the philosophy of Aristotle and opposed the method of indivisibles. ==Life== Andr\u00e9 Tacquet was born in Antwerp, and entered the Jesuit Order in 1629. From 1631 to 1635, he studied mathematics, physics and logic at Leuven. Two of his teachers were Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent and Francois d'Aguilon. Tacquet became a brilliant mathematician of international fame and his works were often reprinted and translated (into Italian and English). His most famous work, which influenced the thinking of Blaise Pascal and his contemporaries, is Cylindricorum et annularium (1651). In this book Tacquet presented how a moving point could generate a curve and the theories of area and volume.Joseph MacDonnell Andr\u00e9 Tacquet, S.J. (1612\u20131660) and his treatment of the method of exhaustion from Fairfield University He died in Antwerp. In honor of Andr\u00e9 Tacquet, his name has been given to a small crater in the northeast part of the Moon, near the southern edge of Mare Serenitatis. ==Opposition to the method of indivisibles== Tacquet claimed in his 1651 book Cylindricorum et annularium libri IV that :[the method of indivisibles] makes war upon geometry to such an extent, that if it is not to destroy it, it must itself be destroyed., p. 119 The Jesuat Stefano degli Angeli provided a detailed response, defending Cavalieri's method. == Works == * 1651: Cylindricorum et annularium libri IV (Antwerp) full text * 1654: Elementa geometriae (Antwerp) * 1656: Arithmeticae theoria et praxis (Louvain) * 1659: Cylindricorum et annularium liber V (Antwerp) full text * 1725: Elementa Euclideae, geometriae (Amsterdam) full text ==See also== *List of Jesuit scientists *List of Roman Catholic scientist-clerics ==References== Category:1612 births Category:1660 deaths Category:Belgian Jesuits Category:Belgian mathematicians Category:Catholic clergy scientists Category:17th-century mathematicians Category:Jesuit scientists ",
