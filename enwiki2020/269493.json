It is located about east of the city of Borgholm on the island \u00d6land. K\u00f6pingsvik is known as a tourist center, offering large and modern camping sites. Nearby are the historic sites of Borgholm Castle and Halltorps Estate. K\u00f6ping (historically) was an important Viking Age port of what is today's Sweden, covering an area of approximately , almost four times larger than the similar site on the island of Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 near Stockholm. K\u00f6ping was in operation from the 7th to the 13th century. It was also an important center of early Christianity in Sweden. Remains of an unfinished, massive 12th century church long have been excavated as well as the largest collection of the so-called eskilstunakistor, 75 pieces. During the last ten years there have been several small excavations which have confirmed the earlier findings and the importance of the site. Note that these findings are almost unknown to public in Sweden and the ruling view is that little site on Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 is Sweden's \"oldest town\". K\u00f6ping faded away around 1200, and Kalmar took over as the most important harbour town in south-eastern Sweden. K\u00f6ping is claimed by some amateur historians and historians as a possible alternative to Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 for the location of the old viking village Birka in Sv\u00ed\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0 (the ancient name for Sweden). Birka is mentioned in Vita Ansgari and the work of Adam of Bremen. He states that Birka is situated directly north of Jomsborg and directly opposite to Kurland and at the same distance between them. This theory has not been widely accepted. == References == ==External links== *K\u00f6pingsvik.se - Facts about K\u00f6pingsvik, \u00d6land Category:Populated places in Borgholm Municipality ",
