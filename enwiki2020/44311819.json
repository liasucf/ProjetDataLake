    "text": "In computer algebra, an Ore algebra is a special kind of iterated Ore extension that can be used to represent linear functional operators, including linear differential and/or recurrence operators. The concept is named after \u00d8ystein Ore. == Definition == Let K be a (commutative) field and A = K[x_1, \\ldots, x_s] be a commutative polynomial ring (with A = K when s = 0). The iterated skew polynomial ring A[\\partial_1; \\sigma_1, \\delta_1] \\cdots [\\partial_r; \\sigma_r, \\delta_r] is called an Ore algebra when the \\sigma_i and \\delta_j commute for i eq j, and satisfy \\sigma_i(\\partial_j) = \\partial_j, \\delta_i(\\partial_j) = 0 for i > j. == Properties == Ore algebras satisfy the Ore condition, and thus can be embedded in a (skew) field of fractions. The constraint of commutation in the definition makes Ore algebras have a non-commutative generalization theory of Gr\u00f6bner basis for their left ideals. ==References== Category:Computer algebra Category:Ring theory ",
