A friendship based on their shared political activism developed into love, marriage, and the founding of the Curbstone Press, which \"served as a model for activist literary publishing on the small press scene.\" Taylor stated that they founded Curbstone because they \"wanted to present literature that promoted human rights and civil liberties and promoted cultural understanding.\" They founded Curbstone in the basement of their home in Willimantic, CT in 1975 and continued in active operation through 2005.
