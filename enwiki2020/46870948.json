    "text": "' is a very small, monolithic asteroid and fast rotator, classified as a near- Earth object of the Apollo group, approximately in diameter. It was first observed on 5 January 2001, by astronomers of the LINEAR program at Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States. The presumed S-type asteroid has a rotation period of only 10 minutes. It has an exceptionally low MOID of 0.66 lunar distance (LD) and will approach Earth at 0.81 LD on 11 November 2029. == Orbit and classification == is a member of the dynamical Apollo group, which are Earth-crossing asteroids. Apollo asteroids are the largest subgroup of near-Earth objects. Unlike many Apollo asteroids, this asteroid is not a Mars-crosser, as its aphelion is smaller than the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66 AU. This asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.97\u20131.59 AU once every 17 months (531 days; semi-major axis of 1.28 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 0\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery found in ESO's Astrovirtel data archive , in August 2000, less than 5 months prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro. === Close approaches === has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of , which translates into 0.7 lunar distances (LD). Due to its small size, that is, an absolute magnitude fainter than 22, this asteroid is not classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid. On 18 November 2013, the asteroid passed Earth at 2.7 LD. The angle of approach made it a good target for radar observations. On 11 November 2029, the orbit of is predicted to bring the asteroid within a nominal distance of or 0.81 LD of Earth. It will also pass the Moon at an even shorter nominal distance of ==Physical characteristics== is an assumed stony S-type asteroid. === Rotation period === A rotational lightcurve of was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomers Robert J. Whiteley, Carl Hergenrother and David Tholen. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 0.1701 hours (612 second) with a brightness amplitude of 0.26 magnitude (). With such a short period, it is a notable fast rotator. The observers classified it as a \"monolithic fast-rotating asteroid\" (MFRA). === Diameter and albedo === The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and derives a diameter of 0.03 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 24.9. == Numbering and naming == As of 2018, this minor planet has neither been numbered nor named. == References == == External links == * Table of Asteroids Next Closest Approaches to the Earth, Sormano Astronomical Observatory * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend * Forthcoming Close Approaches To The Earth \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * * # Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) # # # 20010105 ",
