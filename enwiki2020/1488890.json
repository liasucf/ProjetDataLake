    "text": "White River () is a small holiday and farming town situated just north of Mbombela in Mpumalanga, South Africa. The farms in the region produce tropical fruits, vegetables, flowers and timber. == Origin == After the Boer War, the British demarcated land on the Emanzimhlope River, a tributary of the Crocodile River. Emanzimhlope translates from Swazi as 'White Waters'. Lord Milner (administrator of the defeated Transvaal) tasked his attache, Tom Lawrence, to demarcate land on the 'Emanzimhlope' \u2013 a tributary of the Crocodile River \u2013 to demobilised British Anglo-Boer War soldiers. The longest street in town is still named after Lawrence, who was the first manager of the new settlement. The farming tradition of the community that settled here after the Anglo-Boer War has remained virtually unchanged to this day. After a 26-km canal to channel water from the river was built, the new settlers planted fruit trees and established new cultivation methods. ==Government== White River (Ward 30) is governed by the Democratic Alliance (DA), South Africa\u2019s official opposition party. The DA are the majority party in the town. Rowan Torr was placed as councillor after a by election on the 7 August 2019, where he succeeded Trudie Grove Morgan as councillor. == Agriculture == The agriculture involves largely the production of tropical fruits, vegetables, flowers and timber and tobacco, and is one of the most fertile in the province.
