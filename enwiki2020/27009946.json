Anticlus was the only one to not resist and attempt to answer as he heard her talking in the voice of his wife Laodamia, but just as he was on the point of calling out in response, Odysseus shut his mouth with his hands to prevent him from answering, and thus saved his companions.Homer, Odyssey, 4. 274-289.Bibliotheca, Epitome of Book 4, 5. 19 Some say he held Anticlus so tight that he strangled him.Tryphiodorus, The Taking of Ilios, 477 - 483 The asteroid 7214 Anticlus is named for the mythological figure. ==Notes== Category:Achaeans (Homer) ",
