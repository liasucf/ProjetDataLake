    "text": "\"I Just Fall in Love Again\" is a song written by Larry Herbstritt, with co- writers Steve Dorff, Harry Lloyd, and Gloria Sklerov. Herbstritt had composed the melody and chords for the chorus and a chord progression for the verse, which he took to his friend Steve Dorff. Harry Lloyd and Gloria Sklerov completed the lyrics. The song was originally recorded by the Carpenters and later covered by Dusty Springfield, whose version inspired Anne Murray to record her own cover. ==The Carpenters' version== The Carpenters' version was included on the duo's 1977 album Passage. On the Carpenters' official website, Richard Carpenter notes that he felt the song was perfect for his sister Karen's voice and felt their version had hit-single potential. However, A&M; Records decided not to release it because it was considered too long for Top 40 radio stations to play at the time (just over 4 minutes) and could not be abridged.Carpenters \u2022\u2022 I Just Fall In Love Again In 2004, Richard Carpenter added a remixed \"I Just Fall in Love Again\" to the Carpenters' 2-disc compilation, Gold: 35th Anniversary Edition. ===Personnel=== *Karen Carpenterlead vocals *Richard Carpenter keyboards *Joe Osbornbass guitar *Tony Pelusoelectric guitar *Ron Tuttdrums *Earle Dumleroboe *Gregg Smith Singersbacking vocals ==Dusty Springfield's version== Recorded in summer 1978 and released in early 1979 on Springfield's Living Without Your Love album the same week her record label, United Artists Records, was sold, the track was subsequently never released as a single and went largely unnoticed by the listening public due to lack of promotion for the album. ==Anne Murray's version== When Canadian country singer Anne Murray heard \"I Just Fall in Love Again\" as recorded by Dusty Springfield, her favorite female singer, she was inspired to record her own version of the song, releasing it in early 1979, on her Platinum-selling album New Kind of Feeling. Anne released her version as a single, and it topped Billboard's Country and Adult Contemporary charts for three weeks, while reaching number 11 on the Cash Box Top 100 and number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was the first of three successive number one Country hits and four consecutive number one Adult Contemporary hits during 1979 and 1980. Though Murray loves the song, she is quoted in The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits as saying she was surprised at its success on the Country charts, as she didn't feel the song sounded very \"country\". Nevertheless, Billboard ranked it as the number one Country hit of 1979. Murray included the song as a posthumous duet with Dusty Springfield on her own 2007 album Duets: Friends & Legends. ===Personnel=== *Pat Riccio Jr., Brian Gattokeyboards *Jorn Andersondrums *Peter Cardinalibass *Aidan Mason, Brian Russell, Bob Manguitars *Bob Luciersteel guitar *Rick Wilkins & Peter Cardinalistring arrangement ===Chart performance=== ====Weekly charts==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1979) !Peak position |- |Canadian RPM Country Tracks |align=\"center\"|1 |- |Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary |align=\"center\"|1 |- |Canadian RPM Top Singles http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound- recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.4753a&URLjpg;=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.4753a.gif&Ecopy;=nlc008388.4753a |align=\"center\"|1 |- |- |- |- |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|58 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |- |} ====Year-end charts==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1979) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada RPM Top Singles Bac-lac.gc.ca | style=\"text- align:center;\"|16 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Musicoutfitters.com | style=\"text-align:center;\"|72 |- |U.S. Cash Box | style=\"text- align:center;\"|85 |- |} == References == ==External links== * * * Category:1977 singles Category:1977 songs Category:1979 singles Category:Songs written by Steve Dorff Category:The Carpenters songs Category:Anne Murray songs Category:Dusty Springfield songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jim Ed Norman Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles of the year Category:Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:RPM Country Tracks number-one singles Category:RPM Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:A&M; Records singles Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Juno Award for Single of the Year singles Category:Pop ballads ",
