Toussaint also arranged and produced the song. In a song review for AllMusic, Mark Deming commented on the lyrics: \"In short, the song is about as prototypical as R&B; gets, though Lee Dorsey's great vocal performance and Allen Toussaint's expert arrangement give their version a distinctive edge\". He also notes that many other artists have also adapted the song, including the Leaves, Solomon Burke, Iron Butterfly, the Kingsmen, Roy Head, and Freddie King. In an review of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band album East-West (1966), Deming commented \"highlights came when the band pushed into new territory, such as the taut New Orleans proto-funk of 'Get Out of My Life, Woman'\". ==References== Category:1965 songs Category:1965 singles Category:1968 singles Category:Songs written by Allen Toussaint Category:Lee Dorsey songs Category:Solomon Burke songs Category:Iron Butterfly songs Category:The Kingsmen songs Category:Freddie King songs ",
