Egyptology : the missing millennium : ancient Egypt in medieval Arabic writings. London: UCL Press. . page 169. and historian born at Qusayn near Kufa in Iraq. He was the first historian to be able to at least partly decipher what was written in the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs,Dr. Okasha El Daly (2005), Egyptology: The Missing Millennium: Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings, UCL Press, (cf. Arabic Study of Ancient Egypt , Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation) by relating them to the contemporary Coptic language. ==Works== Ibn al-Nadim (in Kitab al-Fihrist) lists a large number of books on magic, statues, offerings, agriculture, alchemy, physics and medicine, that were either written, or translated from older books, by Ibn Wahshiyya.\"First, the books of the Nabatean corpus themselves claim to be translations from \"ancient Syriac\" (e.g. Filaha 1:5) made by Ibn Wahshiyya\" (H\u00e4meen-Anttila, Jaako (2006). The last pagans of Iraq : Ibn Wa\u1e25shiyya and his Nabatean agriculture. Leiden: Brill. .) His works on alchemy were co-authored with an alchemist named Abu Talib al-Zalyat; their works were used by Al-Dimashqi. ===The Nabataean Agriculture=== Ibn Wahshiyya translated from Nabataean the Nabataean Agriculture (Kitab al-falaha al-nabatiya; c. 904), a major treatise on the subject, which was said to be based on ancient Babylonian sources.Jaakko H\u00e4meen-Anttila Ideology 2002, Nabataean Agriculture 2006 The book extols Babylonian civilization against that of the conquering Arabs. It contains valuable information on agriculture and superstitions, and in particular discusses beliefs attributed to the Sabians \u2013 understood as people who lived before Adam \u2013 that Adam had parents and that he came from India. These ideas were discussed by the Jewish philosophers Yehuda Halevi and Maimonides, through which they became an influence on the seventeenth century French Millenarian Isaac La Peyr\u00e8re. ====Toxicology==== He wrote a toxicology treatise, the Book of Poisons, combining contemporary science, magic and astrology. ===Egyptology=== Ibn Wahshiyya was one of the first historians to be able to at least partly decipher what was written in the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, by relating them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in his time. An Arabic manuscript of Ibn Wahshiyya's book Kitab Shawq al-Mustaham, a work that discusses a number of ancient alphabets, in which he deciphered a number of Egyptian hieroglyphs, was later read by Athanasius Kircher in the 17th century, and then translated and published in English by Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall in 1806 as Ancient Alphabets and Hieroglyphic Characters Explained; with an Account of the Egyptian Priests, their Classes, Initiation, and Sacrifices in the Arabic Language by Ahmad Bin Abubekr Bin Wahishih, 16 years before Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion's complete decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs.Dr. Okasha El Daly, Deciphering Egyptian Hieroglyphs in Muslim Heritage , Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester This book was known to Silvestre de Sacy, a colleague of Champollion. Dr Okasha El Daly, at University College London's Institute of Archaeology, claims that some hieroglyphs had been decoded by Ibn Wahshiyya, eight centuries before Champollion deciphered the Rosetta stone. ===Cryptography=== He published several cipher alphabets that were used to encrypt magic formulas.Whitman, Michael (2010).
