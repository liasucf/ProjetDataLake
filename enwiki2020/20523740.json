No donations are accepted and no tickets are required, although seating is first-come, first-served. The four-story, multi- level stage used for the pageant is a temporary installment on the temple grounds. It takes three weeks to assemble and is disassembled after each Easter season. Auditions are required to participate in the Mesa Pageant, and all cast and crew positions are voluntary. Nearly 1,000 people auditioned in 2013 while only 475 (the largest cast to date) were invited back. While the cast is mostly composed of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, members of several other religious faiths participate in the production each year. Participation in the Mesa Pageant is meant to enrich both the viewer and the cast and crew. Before each performance, the cast and crew gather in the chapel adjacent to the temple grounds for a devotional. A portion of the cast and crew is also assigned to visit with the crowd before and after the production each night. The director as of November 2013 is Jenee Prince. ==See also== * List of pageants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints * Christian drama * Easter Drama * Passion play ==References== ==External links== * Pageants Latter-day Saints Official site * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Official site Category:Culture of Mesa, Arizona Category:Latter Day Saint movement in Arizona Category:Latter Day Saint plays and pageants Category:Recurring events established in 1928 Category:Stage portrayals of Jesus Category:Tourist attractions in Maricopa County, Arizona Category:1928 musicals ",
