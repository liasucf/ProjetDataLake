In 1854, the United States purchased the region from Mexico in what is known as the Gadsden Purchase. Americans of European descent from the East Coast of the United States began to arrive in the area. Some came to work as miners and others came to establish farms and ranches which provided food to the growing population.Gadsden Purchase, 1853\u20131854 The Phelps Dodge Corporation selected the area as a suitable site to establish a smelter for its copper mines in Bisbee. In 1888, mining pioneer Dr. James Douglas founded the Arizona and South Eastern Railroad. By 1901, the railroad line covered Bisbee, Fairbanks, Benson and finally Douglas. That same year the line was renamed the \"El Paso and Southwestern Railroad\".The town was founded in 1901 and was named after Dr. James Douglas. Two copper smelters operated at the site; the Calumet and Arizona Company Smelter and the Copper Queen.The Gadsden Hotel Douglas was incorporated in 1905.

During the Mexican Revolution the United States Army established Camp San Bernardino Ranch a.k.a. the Slaughter Ranch Outpost to deal with the border troubles.

Among them the Hotel Gadsden, the Southern Pacific Railroad Depot, the Grand Theatre and the first international airport in the United States.
