The deadliest event the Soviet Union's flag carrier went through in the decade occurred in , when a Tupolev Tu-104 crashed en route to Sverdlovsk, then located in the Russian SSR, killing all 80 occupants on board. In terms of fatalities, the accident ranks as the eighth worst accident involving a Tu-104, . Another aircraft of the type was involved in the second deadliest accident the airline experienced in the decade, this time in , when 64 people were killed when the aircraft crashed near Chita after entering an updraft. The Tu-104's tail was modified and the service ceiling lowered in the wake of these two accidents. The number of recorded fatalities aboard Aeroflot aircraft during the decade rose to 1059; likewise, 119 of its aircraft were written off in accidents or incidents, split into one Antonov An-10, 12 Antonov An-2s, two Avia 14Ps, 29 Ilyushin Il-12s, 15 Ilyushin Il-14s, one Ilyushin Il-18, 54 Lisunov Li-2s, 3 TS-62s, and 2 Tupolev Tu-104s. Most of the fatal accidents took place within the borders of the Soviet Union. The reluctance the Soviet government had for publicly admitting the occurrence of such events might render these figures higher, as fatal events tended to be admitted only when there were foreigners aboard the crashed aircraft, the accident took place in a foreign country, or they reached the news for some reason. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" |- !
