Joanne Peulen of Booklover Book Reviews said \"Black Rock White City defies typical genre categorisation, and that perhaps this is the mark of a truly great novel\u2026 with the intensity and suspense of a psychological thriller, the lyricism and universality of great literature, and the grittiness and brutality of a crime novel\".\"Book Review - Black Rock White City by A S Patric\" Booklover Book Reviews, 5 June 2016 Lisa Hill of ANZLitLovers said \"Black Rock White City is a stunning novel that places A.S. Patri\u0107 among the finest of our new crop of writers. His prose is uncompromising but his imagery is exquisite. He doesn\u2019t fall back on lashings of foul language to express ferocity and violence; and his use of poetry to reveal the Jovan unseen by the people he meets, is sublime.\"\"Black Rock White City, by A.S.
