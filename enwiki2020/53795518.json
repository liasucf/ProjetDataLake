    "text": "Dreamland was an amusement park in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City that operated at the site of the defunct Astroland park for the 2009 season. It was replaced with a new Luna Park the following year. The park was operated by Anthony Raffaele for Thor Equities. The park contained two large freak shows as well as independent attractions to see a giant snake,http://shutterfreaks.com/gallery21/main.php/d/70784-1/_DSC6010-Giant- snake.jpg a giant rat (really a baby capybara), and a tiny woman. It also included a carousel, a scrambler, and other rides. Thor Equities shut the park down before the end of the 2009 season due to $600,000 in unpaid back rent, locking them out in the middle of the night without a formal eviction. ==References== Category:Coney Island Category:Defunct amusement parks in the United States Category:Defunct amusement parks in New York (state) Category:2009 establishments in New York City Category:2009 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Amusement parks opened in 2009 Category:Amusement parks closed in 2009 ",
