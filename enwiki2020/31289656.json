To the east there are ruins that are alleged to be the remains of a Roman aqueduct. Inhabitants of the village have confirmed it was once called \"Connaya,\" suggesting a link to the ancient settlement of Conna, mentioned in the work of Antonius. Notable features include the monastery of \"Our Lady of Ras Baalbek\" (Deir Saidat ar-Ras) and two Byzantine churches. One church is in the centre of the village and the other lies by the Roman aqueduct. In 1838, Eli Smith noted Ras Baalbek's population as being predominantly Catholic Christian.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 144 In 2014, the war with ISIS in the nearby village of Arsal resulted in the residents of Ras Baalbek forming a militia to protect the village. The militias were allied to the Lebanese Armed Forces. In September 2016 the Lebanese Army attacked Islamic State positions near Ras Baalbek. ==Demographics== Around 15,000 people live in Ras Baalbek. The population is entirely Christian, mainly Greek Catholic, having switched from Orthodox Christianity in 1721. The village is fashion designer Zuhair Murad's hometown. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * Ras Baalbek website * Ras Baalbek Category:Populated places in Baalbek District Category:Great Rift Valley Category:Coloniae (Roman) Category:Populated places established in the 6th millennium BC Category:Melkite Christian communities in Lebanon ",
