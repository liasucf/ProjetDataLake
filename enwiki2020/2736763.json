The area between Flemington railway station and Parramatta Road is the site of Sydney Markets. The markets feature a number of divisions including Produce, Flowers, Growers, Fresh Food, Motor, Swap & Sell, Paddy's Markets and Sydney Markets Plaza.http://www.sydneymarkets.com.au/ Sydney Markets Sydney Markets Plaza, located near Parramatta Road, features a supermarket, hotel, post office, banks and many specialty shops below an office building. A different section of Sydney Markets Plaza lie to the east of the main market, and is technically in the suburb of Homebush, New South Wales. The residential parts of the suburb formerly known as Flemington are now known as \"Homebush West\", although the name \"Flemington\" is still often applied to the whole of the suburb. The village commercial centre of Homebush West is located immediately south of Flemington railway station, and are often referred to as the \"Flemington\" shops. These include multiple grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, butchers and fishmongers, medical surgeries and pharmacies. ==Transport== Flemington railway station is on the Inner West & Leppington Line of the Sydney Trains network. Parramatta Road and the M4 Western Motorway demarcate the northern border of Flemington. Homebush Bay Drive forms the western border. ==History== This area was originally known Liberty Plains but was called Flemington by John Fleming, who was granted here in 1806. The bush was turned into paddocks and later was the site of a cattle saleyard (which gave its name to Saleyards Creek). In the early 1970s, the Sydney Markets were built at Flemington to relieve the Paddy's Markets at Haymarket, in the city. Since the establishment of Sydney Markets at Flemington in 1975, the residential part of the suburb, south of the railway line became known as Homebush West, named after the separate suburb of Homebush immediately to the east. However, Homebush West is still commonly referred to as \"Flemington\". Both the railway station serving the suburb and various organisations and businesses in the suburb still carry the name \"Flemington\". ==Gallery== Image:Flemington Markets 1.JPG| Paddy's Markets Image:Flemington Markets 2.JPG| Flower Markets Image:Flemington Markets 3.JPG| Sydney Markets entrance Image:Flemington Railway Station 3.JPG| Flemington Railway Station ==References== *The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia * Jones, Michael (1985).
