It had a population of 28,535 in 2011 and is made up of five wards.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Table KS01 : Usual Resident Population Brookfield (part); Cadley, College, Garrison; Greyfriars; and Sharoe Green wards. Retrieved 24 May 2010 For several reasons, despite its close proximity to Preston, it has remained distinctly separated. Historically, Fulwood was governed independently from Preston until 1974. Furthermore, since the majority of the area is encompassed under The Fulwood Conservation Area, it has remained geographically separate from Preston. == History == Fulewde, 1199; Fulewude, 1228; Fulwode, 1297. The extract below by John Marius Wilson, Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870\u201372) described Fulwood and its history during its early Victorian foundations: \"FULWOOD, a township-chapelry in Lancaster parish, Lancashire; on the Lancaster and Preston railway, 1.5 mile N of Preston. It has a station on the railway; and its post town is Preston. Acres, 2077. Real property, \u00a36,218. Pop. in 1851, 1,748; in 1861, 2,313. Houses, 172. This was part of the ancient royal forest of Fulwood, now enclosed; and Preston race-ground was part of it. Extensive barracks are here. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Manchester.\" http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Fulwood/ == Economy and society == Fulwood has expanded in the 20th century, and has been popular with housing and business developers, with its close links to the M6 and M55 motorways. Since the 1970s when the Central Lancashire New Town was proposed, large sites have been made available for development, such as Longsands, which is a residential area, and \"East Preston\", where many businesses are currently located, including the Lancashire Evening Post (LEP), Asda, Royal Mail sorting office, Independent Inspections, Xchanging, CPC, EDS and Holiday Inn.Northern Britain Property Partners NBPP, Valtos, Collective Investment Schemes And Property Asset Management, Northern Britain Property Partners NBPP, Valtos, Collective Investment Schemes And Property Asset Management The B6241 (Eastway) provides a vital route, bypassing much of the residential and central areas of Preston, and a road via Longsands connects it to the M6 motorway (at junction 31A which was opened in the 1990s) and the Bluebell Way business park on the boundary with Brookfield. It is also the home of the Royal Preston Hospital, Sharoe Green Hospital was also in Fulwood until its closure in 2004.History of Sharoe Green Hospital , accessed 7 September 2009 Fulwood Barracks has been the home of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment, and other regiments, and is the site of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment Museum.Fulwood Barracks , accessed 7 September 2009 A notable former resident was Major John Rouse Merriott Chard, of the Royal Engineers, V.C., officer commanding at Rorke's Drift in 1879.

Due to large investments during the late Victorian era, Fulwood was an area of much development by wealthy Preston industrialists. Some of the finest Victorian buildings of Lancashire can be found in Fulwood,'The parish of Lancaster: Fulwood', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 7 (1912), pp. 137\u2013138. such as the Fulwood Barracks, Fulwood Union Workhouse, and Harris Orphanage. Many of the larger houses in Fulwood were also built during the Victorian period, particularly those in the Nooklands cul-de-sac. == Amenities == Fulwood has a large number of local amenities. The neighbourhood has a large number of local shops, primary and high schools, pubs, libraries, a large Asda supermarket and Booths supermarket, Preston's main hospital, a college, parks, and many other services.

Parts of the rural wards, named as Preston Rural East and Preston Rural North, were in the former Preston Rural District. Preston Council meetings are hosted every 3 months classified as Area Forum Meetings, of which Fulwood is the Northern Area Forum. Until 2010, the wards which make up Fulwood were split between a number of parliamentary constituencies due to local government boundaries changing between the Boundary Commission for England's reports on parliamentary boundaries. Thus, Fulwood was split unevenly between three constituencies; *Ribble Valley - parts of Rural North and Rural East, Greyfriars, Garrison, the northern parts of College, Sharoe Green, Cadley *Preston - southern parts of College ward *Fylde - elements of Preston Rural North and West. Following their review of parliamentary representation in Lancashire, the Boundary Commission have moved the whole of Fulwood into a new constituency of Wyre and Preston North. For Preston city council elections, see Preston local elections Between 1894 and 1974 Fulwood was governed by Fulwood Urban District council which was merged with other districts under the Local Government Act 1972 to become the new non- metropolitan district of the Borough (now City) of Preston. == Sport == The local cricket teams are Grasshoppers CC (Social Side) and Fulwood & Broughton CC who play in the Palace Shield.
