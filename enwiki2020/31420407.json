    "text": "English version of the slogan at a rally in Tahrir Square. ''''' ( , \"the people want to bring down the regime\") is a political slogan associated with the Arab Spring. The slogan first emerged during the Tunisian Revolution. The chant echoed at Avenue Habib Bourguiba in Tunis for weeks. The slogan also became used frequently during the 2011 Egyptian revolution. It was the most frequent slogan, both in graffiti and in chants in rallies, during the revolution in Egypt. The chant was raised at the protests in Bahrain. Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam has been used frequently in protests across Yemen. The slogan was used in rallies across Libya at the beginning of the 2011 revolt. In March 2011, a group of youths under the age of 15 were arrested in Dera'a in southern Syria, after having sprayed ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam graffiti. Their arrests sparked the uprising in Syria. The slogan was also used frequently in Sudan throughout the protests. In Jordan, a youth group named \"24 March\" used the slogan ash-sha\u02bbb yur\u012bd islah an-ni\u1e93\u0101m (\"the people want to reform the system\"). However, the slogan later changed to ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam in November 2012, when the government imposed a hike in the price of fuel. In Lebanon the slogan has been used in protests against that country's sectarian political system. In the Lebanese protests, an-nizam (\"the regime\") referred to the sectarian political order as such, rather the government. In Palestine, a variation of the slogan, ' (, \"the people want the division to end\"), emerged in protests calling for the two main factions Fatah and Hamas to settle their differences. A parody of the slogan has been used by Bashar al-Assad's supporters in Syria as ' ( \"the people want Bashar al- Assad\"). Another parody of the slogan has been used by King Hamad's loyalist in Bahrain as ' (\"the people want to bring down Al-Wefaq\"), referring to the main opposition party of Bahrain, Al-Wefaq. ==Variants== Syrian Islamists have appropriated the slogan for their own purposes, altering it to \u201cThe People want the declaration of Jihad\u201d (ash-sha\u2019ab yur\u012bd i\u2019l\u0101n al-Jih\u0101d), as well as \"The Ummah wants an Islamic Caliphate\" (al-Ummah tur\u012bd khil\u0101fah isl\u0101miyyah). In post-Mubarak Egypt, given the fact that the military government only partially met the demands of the revolutionaries, with the dreaded state of emergency remaining in place, some protesters started using a somewhat different version of the slogan: The people want to bring down the field marshal, referring to Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi, the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. ==Context== Uriel Abulof, professor of politics at Tel-Aviv University and a senior research fellow at Princeton University, commented: Beno\u00eet Challand, teaching Middle Eastern politics at the University of Bologna, commented on the slogan in the following way: Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said professor of Arab studies at Columbia University and the editor of the Journal of Palestine Studies, commented in the following manner: ==References== ==See also== * El pueblo unido jam\u00e1s ser\u00e1 vencido ==External links== *News footage of Egyptian protestors using the slogan *Ash-sha'ab yurid isqat an-nizam, Bahraini song *Ash-sha'ab lubnani yurid isqat an-nizam at-ta'ifi, Lebanese song *Video from rally in Benghazi Category:Political catchphrases Category:Arab Spring Category:Arabic words and phrases ",
