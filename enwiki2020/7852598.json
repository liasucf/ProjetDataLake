The first bishop of Australia's newest diocese was consecrated in 1968. The cathedral church of the diocese is Christ Church Cathedral, Darwin.

In June 2014 the diocese announced the appointment of Greg Anderson as the sixth bishop who was consecrated and appointed in November 2014. The position of Dean of Christ Church Cathedral, Darwin is currently vacant. ==Cathedral== Christ Church in Darwin became a cathedral when the Northern Territory diocese was created in 1968 out of the larger Diocese of Carpentaria. The building was almost totally destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in 1974. The present cathedral was completed in 1977 on the site of the previous building, incorporating the surviving porch of the old church. The porch had been constructed in 1944 by the Australian Navy. The back wall of the new octagonal building was formed from reclaimed stone from the old church. Many of the treasures of the original building were recovered and repaired. ===List of deans=== * Source: Cathedral website * 2013\u20132019: Keith Joseph (afterwards Bishop of North Queensland, 2019) * 2007\u20132013: Jeremy Greaves (afterwards Assistant Bishop of Brisbane, Northern Region, 2017) * 2003\u20132007: Michael Nixon * 1998\u20132000: Dennis Vanderwolf * 1992\u20131997: Michael Chiplin * 1983\u20131992: Murray Johnson * 1968\u20131983: Clyde Wood (afterwards Bishop of the Northern Territory, 1983) == List of bishops == # 1968\u20131983: Ken Mason # 1983\u20131992: Clyde Wood (later Bishop of North Queensland, 1996) # 1992\u20131997: Richard Appleby # 1999\u20132006: Philip Freier (translated to Melbourne, 2006) # 2007\u20132013: Greg Thompson (translated to the Anglican Diocese of Newcastle, 2014) # 2014\u2013present: Greg Anderson ==References== == External links == * Diocese of the Northern Territory website Northern Territory Category:1968 establishments in Australia Category:Religion in the Northern Territory Category:Anglican Church of Australia Ecclesiastical Province of Queensland ",
