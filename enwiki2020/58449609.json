During the 2016 presidential election, many journalists began paying attention to the site's delegate counts, and Quoctrung Bui of the New York Times noted that the site \"...does something very few media organizations are willing to do: accurately and independently tabulate delegates in real time.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:American political websites Category:Internet properties established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in the United States ",
