The Hornberg Basin during renovations in November 2008 The Hornberg Basin () is the upper reservoir of the Wehr power station, whose lower reservoir is impounded by the Wehra Dam. It lies near Herrischried (Hornberg) and near the town of Wehr in the county of Waldshut in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg on the dome of the Langer Eck, the highest hill in the Hotzenwald. It was opened in 1975, is only used to generate pumped-storage power and is operated by the Schluchseewerk. A few hundred metres south of the Hornberg Basin it is planned to build the Hornberg Basin II by 2021 as part of the Atdorf Power Station. With a length of almost one kilometre and storage capacity of 9 million m\u00b3 it will be considerably larger than the present Hornberg Basin. == See also == * List of dams in Germany == References == == Literature == *Festschrift Hornbergstufe der Schluchseewerk AG.
