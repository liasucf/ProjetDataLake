In 1954, Kelly was part of the Newtown side which claimed the minor premiership with the likes of Brian Clay, Kevin Considine and Ray Preston playing for the club at the time. Kelly played at five-eighth in the 1954 NSWRL grand final against South Sydney which Newtown lost 23-15. The following year, Newtown again claimed the minor premiership and reached the 1955 NSWRL grand final against Souths. Newtown went into the game as favorites as South Sydney were without a few of their star players including future immortal Clive Churchill. Kelly played at five-eighth in the game which Newtown led at halftime 8-4 before Souths came back to win a thrilling contest 12-11. This would be Newtown's last grand final appearance for another 26 years. Kelly played one further season for Newtown before retiring at the end of 1956.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players.
