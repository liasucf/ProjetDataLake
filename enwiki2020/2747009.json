Sleek Geek is part of National Science Week in Australia. In 2005, the inaugural University of Sydney Sleek Geeks Science Eureka Schools Prize was launched as part of University of Sydney Eureka Science Awards. The competition is sponsored by the Faculty of Science at the University of Sydney, with additional support from Abbey\u2019s Bookshop, Sydney and Microsoft. The competition encourages secondary school students to tell a scientific story via a short video piece, in a manner that is enjoyable and accessible for the general public. Entries are to take the form of a 1-3 minute video piece and a 250-word description of the video content. ==2006== University of Sydney Sleek Geeks Science Eureka Schools Prize - (prizes totalling A$11,000 are shared between contestants and their schools) ===Winners=== Alex Lee- Rekers, Olivia Jablonski and Thomas Marr Year 10, Conservatorium High School of Music, New South Wales *Nanosamurai Defense *For a simple explanation of the body's complex immune system.
