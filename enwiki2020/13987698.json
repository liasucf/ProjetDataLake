She relocated to New York City in 1991.Roberta Smith (June 4, 1993), Art Review: Jutta Koether New York Times. == Career == Koether's paintings are exercises in color, line, form and pattern and often feature text. Her style has precedent in the work of Sigmar Polke and Kenny Scharf. She is also inspired by artists and intellectuals who have created an alternative to mainstream culture, including underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger and musician Patti Smith.Jutta Koether \u2013 The Thirst, 5 March, 2011 - 24 April, 2011 Moderna Museet, Stockholm. She has collaborated with Sonic Youth\u2019s Kim Gordon on a number of projects, for example Her Noise at Tate Modern in 2005.Tate.org.ukHolly Myers (August 18, 2006), A message in the starkness Los Angeles Times. Koether's work is also affiliated with Martin Kippenberger. Their relationship began in Cologne when she interviewed him for Spex magazine. Although her work is not as grandiose as Kippenberger, both their works engage with the dense history of European, and more specifically, German painting. For much of the 1990s, she mixed graffiti-inspired brushwork, fluorescent colors (especially bright pink), fragmented images and assorted quotations on surfaces that had a vibrant, all-over undergrowth.Roberta Smith (April 15, 2005), Art in Review; Jutta Koether New York Times. Her solo show at Pat Hearn Gallery, New York, in 1997 featured a soundtrack by the artist, accompanied by Tom Verlaine.William McCollum, ArtNet.com Her visionary work, according to The New York Times art critic Roberta Smith, sees painting as multipurpose.Roberta Smith, \"Art in Review; Jutta Koether,\" NY Times Koether\u2019s 2009 show entitled Lux Exterior at Reena Spaulings further explored a common thematic in her work, the relation of painting with other aspects of theoretical and counter culture. Koether\u2019s 2009 show was discussed in David Joselit\u2019s essay entitled Painting Beside Itself. The exhibition, which included a painting entitled Hot Rod (after Poussin) (2009) along with sculptural found objects and a series of three performances, was noted by Joselit as a \u201csophisticated response to the question which I began [this essay]: How does a painting belong to a network?\u201d In spring 2012, Koether took part in the three-month exposition of Whitney Biennial. Around that time, she conceived two large series of works that respond directly to the French artist Nicolas Poussin, a reinterpretation of his The Seven Sacraments reimagined as a series of installations, and Seasons (2012), a response to Poussin\u2019s The Four Seasons.Jutta Koether: Seasons and Sacraments, 4 May 2013 to 7 July 2013 Arnolfini, Bristol. Since 1985, Koether has also worked as a reviewer and editor for many magazines and journals such as Spex, Texte zur Kunst, Flash Art and Artscribe.
