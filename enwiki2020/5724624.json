Dawes was born in Boston. Prior to the Revolution, he attended a regular school and worked as a mechanic. He ardently supported the Whigs, gaining infamy among Royalists; his house was plundered by the British when they withdrew from Boston in 1776. Later, he became active in politics, lived in a roomy house on Purchase Street beside John Adams, and worked as an architect and builder designing many notable buildings in Boston, including the Brattle Street Church and repairs and/or modifications on the Old State House in about 1772.Holland, Henry W.

This elevation of the Old State House was drawn by Thomas Dawes when he was 20 years old, and engraved by Nathaniel Hurd.

Only 11 days after the construction of Hollis Hall, a fire destroyed Old Harvard Hall, and in 1766, Thomas Dawes was again chosen as master builder, to replace this building. Three decades later Harvard again called upon him, this time to build Stoughton Hall. He helped build the Shirley-Eustis House for Governor William Shirley.Detwiller, Frederick C. \"Thomas Dawes: Boston's Patriot Architect,\" Old-Time New England, Bulletin of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, Vol. LXVII, Nos. 1-2, Summer-Fall 1977, Serial Nos. 249-250, pp. 1-5.
