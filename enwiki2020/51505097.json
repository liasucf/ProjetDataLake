This event was the heaviest of the boy's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 100 kilograms of body mass. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. Since there were only four attendees, it was decided that only one bronze medal will be granted instead of two bronze medals. ==Results== ===Main Bracket=== ==References== * Judo Contest Sheet & Fights Results * Official Judo Results Book Category:Judo at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics ",
