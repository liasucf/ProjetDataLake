    "text": "Walter Anthony \"Tony\" Bradford (born March 3, 1987), better known by his stage name Montana of 300 (or simply Montana), is an American rapper, singer and songwriter from Chicago, Illinois. His debut studio album, Fire in the Church, was released on May 20, 2016. He is best known for his rap style, incorporating trap, R&B;, and drill beats, while also making remixes to hit songs that, like his originals, often include religious subtext. Since releasing Fire in the Church, Montana has committed to releasing an album every year on May 20. The significance of the date is unknown. His third album, Don't Doubt the God, was released on May 20, 2017, and his fourth album, Pray 4 the Devil, was released on May 20, 2018, and his fifth album, Views from the General's Helmet, was released on May 20, 2019. ==Early life== Tony Bradford was born on March 3, 1989 in Peoria, Illinois. He has two brothers and three sisters. He started rapping at age 15, and grew up listening to artists such as 2Pac, DMX, Lil Wayne and Jay Z. Both his parents suffered from serious substance abuse issues, his father from alcohol and his mother from crack cocaine. After witnessing his parents' struggles, Montana ceased using narcotics, not wanting to \"fry his brain.\" In 2008, Montana, his friend from high school, Montelle Talley (known professionally as \"Talley of 300\"), as well as several others joined together to form the rap group \"300\". The name for the group was based on the movie of the same name, in which a group of 300 Spartans overcome more than 300,000 Persian Soldiers to hold on to their territory. Montana was particularly inspired by the line, \"No Surrender, No Retreat, Only the hard, only the strong, Against all odds\". ==Career== In 2014, Montana released his first mixtape titled, Cursed with a Blessing. In September 2015, Montana made a cameo appearance in the popular television show, Empire. In December 2015, Montana and Talley of 300 released a collaborative mixtape titled Gunz and Roses. Staples of this tape included \"FGE Cypher\" and \"Mf's Mad\". On May 20, 2016, Montana released his debut studio album, titled Fire in the Church. The 18-track release, which only included features from his Fly Guy Entertainment labelmates and Kevin Gates, was lauded by XXL magazine for its \"heat-seeking bars and thought-provoking metaphors\". The album peaked at #95 on the Billboard 200. On February 10, 2017, Montana released a compilation album with his Fly Guy labelmates, titled No Surrender No Retreat. ==Discography== ===Albums=== ====Studio albums==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US R&B;/HH ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US Rap ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US Ind. |- ! scope=\"row\" | Fire in the Church | * Released: May 20, 2016 * Label: Fly Guy Entertainment * Format: CD, digital download | 95 || 7 || 2 || 11 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Don't Doubt the God | * Released: May 20, 2017 * Label: Fly Guy Entertainment, E1 Music * Format: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 || 4 || 22 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Pray for the Devil | * Released: May 20, 2018 * Label: Fly Guy Entertainment, E1 Music * Format: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 || 3 || 37 |- ! scope=\"row\" | A Gun in the Teacher's Desk | * Released: November 16, 2018 * Label: Fly Guy Entertainment, E1 Music * Format: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 || 10 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Views from the General's Helmet | * Released: May 20, 2019 * Label: Fly Guy Entertainment, E1 Music * Format: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 || || \u2014 |} ====Mixtapes==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of mixtapes, with selected details ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:19em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\" | Cursed With a Blessing | * Released: December 1, 2014 * Label: Fly Guy Entertainment * Format: Digital download |- ! scope=\"row\" | Gunz n Roses (with Talley of 300) | * Released: December 2, 2015 * Label: TSO Records * Format: Digital download |- |} ====Compilation album==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\" | No Surrender No Retreat (with Fly Guy Entertainment) | * Released: February 10, 2017 * Label: Fly Guy Entertainment * Format: CD, digital download |- |} ===Singles=== ====As lead artist==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of singles as lead artist, showing year released and album name |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Derrick Rose MVP Song\" | 2011 | rowspan=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Ice Cream Truck\" | 2014 | rowspan=\"1\"|Cursed With a Blessing |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Gas Mask\" (with Talley of 300) | rowspan=\"3\"| 2015 | rowspan=\"3\"|Gunz n Roses |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Nothing New\" (with Talley of 300) |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"You Know\" (with Talley of 300) |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Mf's Mad, Pt. 2\" (featuring Talley of 300) | rowspan=\"4\"| 2016 | rowspan=\"4\"|Fire in the Church |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Land of the Dark\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Here Now\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Wts Now\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Dirty Dancin'\" | 2017 | rowspan=\"1\"| Don't Doubt the God |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Ugly\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2018 | rowspan=\"2\"| Pray for the Devil |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Chiraq vs. NY\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Been a Beast\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2018 | rowspan=\"2\"| A Gun in the Teacher's Desk |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Dip-n-Sauce\" |- |} ====As featured artist==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of singles as featured artist, showing year released and album name |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Bad Combo\" (Nasty Nem featuring Montana of 300) | rowspan=\"2\"| 2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Black On Black Everything\" (Talley Of 300 featuring Montana of 300) | Thanksgiving |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Upstate RockStar\" (Locx featuring Montana of 300) | rowspan=\"3\"| 2015 | rowspan=\"2\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Stephen Curry\" (J Real featuring Montana of 300) |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Black Out\" (Jax Teller featuring Montana of 300) | Just Another Crazy Kraka |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Like Me\" (Jewelz Montalvo featuring Montana of 300, Abbie and Tatiana Carrion) | 2016 | rowspan=\"2\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Come Up\" (Innocent featuring Montana of 300) | 2017 |- |} ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Television series |- !
