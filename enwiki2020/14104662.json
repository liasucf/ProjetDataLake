He began working in films in 1995 and has today established himself as a character actor. == Early life == Sharath had an inclination towards cricket and theatre as a child, and \"dramatise[d] Bhagat Singh on stage when in school.\" He \"used to read a lot of plays written by people like Kambar\" and rated himself as a \"fairly good singer too.\" He accompanied his father Lohithaswa, to his rehearsals for plays, and also took part in \"many stage and radio plays before doing amateur theatre in Bengaluru.\" This led his father Lohithaswa to suggest that Sharath take English-language as his graduation subject. Sharath also obtained a master's degree in English from Bangalore's National College, where he also went on to work as lecturer. == Career == After a while, \"boredom and monotony\" led Sharath to quit and taking to acting as a full-time profession starting with stage.

The roles that I was offered after Huliya were repetitive. I got fed up. Fortunately or unfortunately, I met with an accident and was forced to off work for at least two to three years. Godhuli came as a major break in my career.\" He received appreciation for his role as Cheluvanayaka in Chi. Guru Dutt's Godhuli, also fetching him the Aryabhata Award. While he began working in films starting 1995, it was television that gave him recognition. He appeared in Sathyu's Khayar and Poli Kitty.
