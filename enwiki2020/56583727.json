He has published extensively on the multicomponent assembly of large coordination cages. Compounds designed and prepared in his research group are variously described as three-dimensional synthetic receptors, coordination assemblies, molecular paneling, molecular flasks, and coordination capsules. He shared the 2018 Wolf Prize in Chemistry with Omar Yaghi \"for conceiving metal-directed assembly principles leading to large highly porous complexes\". ==Recognition== Structure of Fujita's {[Pd(en)]6L4}12+ (en = ethylenediamine, L = tripyridine ligand CH3CO2C(C5H4N)3). * 1994 - Progress Award in Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan * 2000 - Division Award of Chemical Society of Japan (Organic Chemistry) * 2001 - Japan IBM Science Prize * 2009 - The Commendation for Science and Technology by the MEXT Prizes for Science and Technology * 2010 \u2013 The 7th Leo Esaki Prize * 2010 \u2013 Thomson Reuters Research Front Award * 2011 \u2013 3M Lectureship Award (The University of British Columbia) * 2012 \u2013 Kharasch Lecturers (TheUniversity of Chicago) * 2013 \u2013 Arthur C.
