Voronin is married to his wife Yulia and they have three children together; Maria, Andriy Jr. and Sonja. He is a Ukrainian Orthodox Christian. ==Career== ===Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach=== Voronin left his youth club Chornomorets Odessa in 1995 to move to Germany, where he joined Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. He made his debut in the German Bundesliga against Bayern Munich in 1997 at the age of 18, but went on to spend a couple of years mainly in M\u00f6nchengladbach's youth teams. Having played just seven games and scored one goal in the top division, he saw his team relegated and after one season and just two matches in the 2. Bundesliga joined fellow second division strugglers Mainz for a fee of \u20ac45,000. ===Mainz 05=== Voronin became Mainz' leading striker in his two seasons at the club, and in his third season became the top scorer in the 2. Bundesliga with 20 goals. Voronin's start to the 2002\u201303 season with Mainz prompted the following quote from German football daily kicker: \"The star of the 23 year old forward is on a rise due to the new role he plays for the team \u2013 he has complete freedom of actions.\" This led to speculations about his future, with Dynamo Kyiv reported to be willing to bring him back to Ukraine. VfB Stuttgart, Bologna and a number of other clubs were then reported to approach his agent and Mainz initiated negotiations to extend his contract. UEFA.com described Voronin as \"one of the most sought-after talents in Germany.\" However, come the end of the season Mainz failed to win promotion. Voronin decided not to renew his contract and ultimately chose to continue his career with 1. FC K\u00f6ln, who had just been promoted to the top division. ===1. FC K\u00f6ln=== K\u00f6ln were relegated at the end of the season, however Voronin stayed in the top flight after signing for Bayer Leverkusen. Bayer had been interested in Voronin since his time at Mainz and were also impressed with his performance for K\u00f6ln in a 2\u20132 draw against them when Voronin scored one and created the other of K\u00f6ln's goals. After that game Express called him \"the only true good footballer at K\u00f6ln\" and Bild wrote: \"K\u00f6ln's only striker (Voronin) was more dangerous than Bayer's entire star attack (Schneider, Ponte, Neuville and Berbatov).\" ===Bayer Leverkusen=== After a successful first two seasons with Bayer as well as at the international level (culminating in participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany where Ukraine reached the quarterfinals), Voronin's contract was running out at the end of the 2006\u201307 season and he was reported to have declined Bayer's offer of an extension. According to the player, he was approached by clubs from France, Spain, Italy and Scotland (Celtic were reported to be contemplating a move). ===Liverpool=== Voronin in action for Dynamo Moscow in July 2010 On 26 February 2007, Liverpool announced that they had signed Voronin on a free transfer and that he would join the team during the summer. Voronin was unveiled as a Liverpool player on 6 July 2007 after signing a four-year deal. Voronin made his Premier League debut on 11 August 2007, coming on as a substitute in the 78th minute against Aston Villa in a 2\u20131 victory. A few days later on 15 August 2007, he scored his first ever goal for Liverpool in the 1\u20130 1st leg Champions League qualifier against Toulouse. Liverpool manager Rafa Ben\u00edtez was clearly impressed with Voronin, saying: > \"He is clever, has great game awareness and gives us so many more options in > attack. He can play behind a main striker, lead the line himself, or come > into the attack from the flanks.\" On 25 August 2007, Voronin scored his first Premier League goal against Sunderland in the 87th minute. He then scored his next goal in the next league game against Derby County which Liverpool comfortably won 6\u20130 to move top of the Premier League table. He also scored the first goal in the 2\u20132 draw with Tottenham Hotspur on 7 October 2007. He carried on his scoring record against Tottenham Hotspur by scoring in a win over the north London club on the last day of the season. On 25 January 2008, Voronin injured his ankle during training. He underwent surgery and made a small number of appearances at the end of the season but failed to make an impact. This led to rumours that Ben\u00edtez would sell him in order to raise funds for the summer 2008 transfer window, however Voronin played some of the summer friendlies scoring a total of 3 goals in the process. He made his first start of the 2009\u201310 season in the Champions League group stage game against Lyon. He had a particularly poor day as he missed various opportunities to score including a one-on-one with Hugo Lloris. He was later substituted for Ryan Babel who scored Liverpool's goal. ===Hertha BSC=== On the last day of the transfer market Andriy Voronin agreed to be loaned to Hertha BSC for a season.Voronin signs for Hertha Berlin He had two goals in a 2\u20131 victory over Bayern Munich on 14 February, to propel Hertha into first place in the Bundesliga. On 7 March he netted a hat-trick against Energie Cottbus. On 11 April 2009, following a retaliatory foul against Leon Andreasen of Hannover 96, he was sent off, receiving the 1000th red card in Bundesliga history. Voronin was unable to secure a permanent move back to Germany during the summer of 2009, and as a result he returned to the Liverpool squad for the start of the 2009-10 season. ===Dynamo Moscow=== On 8 January 2010, it was announced that Liverpool had accepted a \u00a34 million offer for him from Dynamo Moscow, Two days later, Voronin officially signed for FC Dynamo Moscow. ===Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf=== On 31 July 2012, Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf announced to have signed Voronin for one year on loan from Dynamo Moscow. ==International career== Voronin playing for Ukraine at UEFA Euro 2012. While at Mainz, Voronin was called up initially to Ukraine's Under-21 team and in January 2002 to the national team, at the age of 22. He made his international debut in a 4\u20131 friendly defeat to Romania in March 2002. However, he was dropped after that match, with coach Leonid Buriak explaining, \"I've been to Germany twice to watch him and made a conclusion that Andriy cannot compete with [Andriy] Shevchenko, [Serhiy] Rebrov, and [Andriy] Vorobei as a forward. He can play in midfield as well, but he still has to improve some aspects of his game. Anyway, we count on Voronin, especially considering his young age.\" Voronin was ultimately recalled to the national side, scoring his first international goal in a 2\u20130 Euro 2004 qualifying win over Greece in September 2002 and a second one in a 2\u20132 draw against Spain in March 2003. He was in the Ukrainian squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which Ukraine got to the quarter-finals, beaten by the eventual winners, Italy. played in the finals of Cyprus International Football Tournaments 2009, where Ukraine beat Serbia(1:0)http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/cypr-intltourn09.html ==Coaching career== On 14 October 2020 he returned to Dynamo Moscow as an assistant manager to Sandro Schwarz. ==Controversy== After a journalist addressed Voronin in Ukrainian after a defeat to Latvia, Voronin responded by saying \"can you speak to me in Russian?\" When the journalist said that Ukrainian is the state language, Voronin responded saying: \"Why do I need your Ukrainian? I was born in Odessa and never heard Ukrainian there.\" During his time at Liverpool, Voronin heavily criticized the standard of lifestyle in England and the United Kingdom in general and in particular the city of Liverpool. Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; \"Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned! As a result my wife had to go back to Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent and sometimes I have absolutely no clue what the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem.\" ==Career statistics== ===Club=== :Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach |1997\u201398 |7||1||1||0||0||0||8||1 |- |1998\u201399 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |1999\u201300 |2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- !|Total !9||1||1||0||0||0||10||1 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Mainz 05 |2000\u201301 |10||1||1||0||0||0||11||1 |- |2001\u201302 |34||8||2||1||0||0||36||9 |- |2002\u201303 |31||20||1||0||0||0||32||20 |- !|Total !75||29||4||1||0||0||79||30 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1.
