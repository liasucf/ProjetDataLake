With a few exceptions, the general blueprint of a Shinto shrine is Buddhist in origin. Before Buddhism, shrines were just temporary structures erected to a particular purpose. Buddhism brought to Japan the idea of permanent shrines and much of Shinto architecture's vocabulary. The presence of verandas, stone lanterns, and elaborate gates are examples of this influence. The composition of a Shinto shrine is extremely variable, and none of its possible features are necessarily present. Even the honden or sanctuary, the part which houses the kami and which is the centerpiece of a shrine, can be missing. However, since its grounds are sacred, they usually are surrounded by a fence made of stone or wood called tamagaki, while access is made possible by an approach called sand\u014d. The entrances themselves are straddled by gates called torii, which are therefore the simplest way to identify a Shinto shrine. A shrine may include within its grounds several structures, each destined to a different purpose.The History of Shrines, Encyclopedia of Shinto, retrieved on June 10, 2008 Among them are the honden or sanctuary, where the kami are enshrined, the heiden, or hall of offerings, where offers and prayers are presented, and the haiden or hall of worship, where there may be seats for worshipers. The honden is the building that contains the shintai, literally, \"the sacred body of the kami\". Of these, only the haiden is open to the laity. The honden is located behind the haiden and is usually much smaller and unadorned. Other notable shrine features are the temizuya, the fountain where visitors cleanse their hands and mouth and the shamusho (), the office that supervises the shrine. Shrines can be very large, as for example Ise Shrine, or as small as a beehive, as in the case of the hokora, small shrines frequently found on road sides. Before the forced separation of Shinto and Buddhism (Shinbutsu bunri), it was not uncommon for a Buddhist temple to be built inside or next to a shrine or to the contrary for a shrine to include Buddhist subtemples (Shinbutsu sh\u016bg\u014d). If a shrine was also a Buddhist temple, it was called a jingu-ji. At the same time, temples in the entire country adopted tutelary kami ( and built temple shrines called chinjusha to house them.Mark Teeuwen in Breen and Teeuwen (2000:95-96) After the forcible separation of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines (shinbutsu bunri) ordered by the new government in the Meiji period, the connection between the two religions was officially severed, but continued nonetheless in practice. ==The origin of shrines== The practice of marking sacred areas began in Japan as early as the Yayoi period (from about 500 BC to 300 AD) originating from primal Shinto tenets. Features in the landscape such as rocks, waterfalls, islands, and especially mountains, were places believed to be capable of attracting kami, and subsequently were worshiped as yorishiro. Originally, sacred places may have been simply marked with a surrounding fence and an entrance gate or torii. Later, temporary buildings similar to present day portable shrines were constructed to welcome the gods to the sacred place. Over time the temporary structures evolved into permanent structures that were dedicated to the gods. Ancient shrines were constructed according to the style of dwellings (Izumo Taisha) or storehouses (Ise Grand Shrine). The buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark. Such early shrines did not include a space for worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: taisha-zukuri, shinmei-zukuri, and sumiyoshi-zukuri. They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha respectively and date to before 552. According to the tradition of , the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.Presently only the Ise Grand Shrine is being rebuilt every 20 years. ==Common features== The composition of a Shinto shrine The following is a diagram illustrating the most important elements of a Shinto shrine: #Torii \u2013 Shinto gate #Stone stairs #Sand\u014d \u2013 the approach to the shrine #Ch\u014dzuya or temizuya \u2013 fountain to cleanse one's hands and face #T\u014dr\u014d \u2013 decorative stone lanterns #Kagura-den \u2013 building dedicated to Noh or the sacred kagura dance #Shamusho \u2013 the shrine's administrative office #Ema \u2013 wooden plaques bearing prayers or wishes #Sessha/massha \u2013 small auxiliary shrines #Komainu \u2013 the so-called \"lion dogs\", guardians of the shrine #Haiden \u2013 oratory #Tamagaki \u2013 fence surrounding the honden #Honden \u2013 main hall, enshrining the kami. On the roof of the haiden and honden are visible chigi (forked roof finials) and katsuogi (short horizontal logs), both common shrine ornamentations. ===Gate (torii)=== Senbon Torii at Fushimi Inari-taisha, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto The torii is a gate which marks the entrance to a sacred area, usually but not necessarily a shrine.Encyclopedia of Shinto Torii, accessed on December 15, 2009 A shrine may have any number of torii (Fushimi Inari Taisha has thousands) made of wood, stone, metal, concrete or any other material. They can be found in different places within a shrine's precincts to signify an increased level of holiness. Torii can often be found also at Buddhist temples, however they are an accepted symbol of Shinto, and as such are used to mark shrines on maps. The origin of the torii is unclear, and no existing theory has been accepted as valid. They may for example have originated in India as a derivative of the torana gates in the monastery of Sanchi, which is located in central India.JAANUS, Torii accessed on December 12, 2009 ===Pathway (sand\u014d)=== The sand\u014d is the road approaching either a Shinto shrine or a Buddhist temple.Iwanami Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version. Its point of origin is usually straddled in the first case by a Shinto torii, in the second by a Buddhist sanmon, gates which mark the beginning of the shrine's or temple territory. There can also be stone lanterns and other decorations at any point along its course. There can be more than one sand\u014d, in which case the main one is called omote-sand\u014d, or front sand\u014d, ura-sand\u014d, or rear sand\u014d, etc. ===Fountain (ch\u014dzuya)=== Ch\u014dzuya at Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b shrine in Nikk\u014d, Tochigi Before entering the shrine, visitors are supposed to wash their hands and mouths at a fountain built to the purpose called ch\u014dzuya or temizuya. ===Guardian lion-dogs (komainu)=== The two \"lions\" in front of a shrine are in effect warden dogs called . They were so called because they were thought to have been brought to Japan from China via Korea, and their name derives from , the Japanese term for the Korean kingdom of Koguryo.JAANUS, Komainu, accessed on November 8, 2009 They are almost identical, but one has the mouth open, the other closed. This is a very common pattern in statue pairs at both temples and shrines, and has an important symbolic meaning. The open mouth is pronouncing the first letter of the sanskrit alphabet (\"a\"), the closed one the last (\"um\"), representing the beginning and the end of all things.JAANUS, A un, accessed on November 8, 2009 The one with the open mouth is called , the other komainu, a name that in time came to be used for both animals. ===Worship hall (haiden)=== The haiden is the hall of worship or oratory of the shrine. It is generally placed in front of the shrine's main sanctuary (honden) and often built on a larger scale than the latter. The haiden is often connected to the honden by a heiden, or hall of offerings. While the honden is the place for the enshrined kami and off- limits to the general public, the haiden provides a space for ceremonies and for worshiping the kami. ===Offertory hall (heiden)=== The heiden is the part of a shrine used to house offerings, and normally consists of a section linking the honden and the haiden .Heiden, JAANUS, accessed on November 17, 2009 It can also be called or in other ways, and its position can sometimes vary. In spite of its name, nowadays it is used mostly for rituals. ===Sanctuary (honden)=== The honden at Uda Mikumari Shrine, located in Uda, Nara The honden, also called is the most sacred building of shrine, intended purely for the use of the enshrined kami. The kami, in itself incorporeal, is usually represented physically by a mirror or sometimes by a statue.Shinden, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica The building is normally in the rear of the shrine and closed to the general public. The sections Most common shrine styles and Other styles below are dedicates specifically to honden and their characteristics. ===Other elements=== ====Hokora==== A hokora or hokura is a very small Shinto shrine either found on the precincts of a larger shrine and dedicated to folk kami, or on a street side, enshrining kami not under the jurisdiction of any large shrine.Encyclopedia of Shinto, Hokora. Accessed on December 14, 2009 D\u014dsojin, minor kami protecting travelers from evil spirits, may for example be enshrined in a hokora. ====Sessha, massha==== and , also called are small or miniature shrines having a deep historical relationship with a more important shrine or with the kami it enshrines, and fall under that shrine's jurisdiction. The two terms used to have different meanings, but must be today considered synonyms. For this reason, this kind of shrine is now sometimes called .The term setsumatsusha is the combination of the two terms sessha and massha. ==Most common shrine styles== Shrine buildings can have many different basic layouts, usually named either after a famous shrine's honden (e.g. hiyoshi-zukuri, named after Hiyoshi Taisha), or a structural characteristic (e.g. irimoya-zukuri, after the hip-and-gable roof it adopts. The suffix -zukuri in this case means \"structure\".) The honden's roof is always gabled, and some styles also have a veranda-like aisle called hisashi (a 1-ken wide corridor surrounding one or more sides of the core of a shrine or temple). Among the factors involved in the classification, important are the presence or absence of: * \u2013 a style of construction in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs parallel to the roof's ridge (non gabled- side). The shinmei-zukuri, nagare-zukuri, hachiman-zukuri, and hie-zukuri belong to this type. * \u2013 a style of construction in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs perpendicular to the roof's ridge (gabled side). The taisha-zukuri, sumiyoshi-zukuri, \u014dtori-zukuri and kasuga-zukuri belong to this type. Proportions are also important. A building of a given style often must have certain proportions measured in ken (the distance between pillars, a quantity variable from one shrine to another or even within the same shrine). The oldest styles are the tsumairi shinmei-zukuri, taisha- zukuri, and sumiyoshi-zukuri, believed to predate the arrival of Buddhism. The two most common are the hirairi nagare-zukuri and the tsumairi kasuga- zukuri.Encyclopedia of Shinto,History and Typology of Shrine Architecture, accessed on November 29, 2009 Larger, more important shrines tend to have unique styles. ===Nagare-zukuri=== Ujigami Shrine in Uji, Kyoto Prefecture The or is a style characterized by a very asymmetrical gabled roof ( in Japanese) projecting outwards on the non-gabled side, above the main entrance, to form a portico. This is the feature which gives the style its name, the most common among shrines all over the country. Sometimes the basic layout consisting of an elevated partially surrounded by a veranda called hisashi (all under the same roof) is modified by the addition of a room in front of the entrance. The honden varies in roof ridge length from 1 to 11 ken, but is never 6 or 8 ken.JAANUS, Nagare-zukuri, accessed on December 1, 2009 The most common sizes are 1 and 3 ken. The oldest shrine in Japan, Uji's Ujigami Shrine, has a honden of this type. Its external dimensions are 5x3 ken, but internally it is composed of three measuring 1 ken each. ===Kasuga-zukuri=== as a style takes its name from Kasuga Taisha's honden. It is characterized by the extreme smallness of the building, just 1x1 ken in size. In Kasuga Taisha's case, this translates in 1.9 m x 2.6 m.JAANUS, Kasuga-zukuri, accessed on December 1, 2009 The roof is gabled with a single entrance at the gabled end, decorated with chigi and katsuogi, covered with cypress bark and curved upwards at the eaves. Supporting structures are painted vermillion, while the plank walls are white. After the Nagare-zukuri, this is the most common style, with most instances in the Kansai region around Nara. ==Other styles== Follows a list of other styles (in alphabetical order). Many are rare, some unique. Most deal with the structure of a single building but others, for example the Ishi-no- ma-zukuri style, define instead the relationship between member structures. In that case, the same building can fall under two separate classifications. For example, the honden and haiden at \u014csaki Hachimang\u016b are single-storied, irimoya-zukuri edifices. Because they are connected by a passage called ishi- no-ma and are covered by a single roof, however, the complex is classified as belonging to the ishi-no-ma-zukuri style (also called gongen-zukuri). ===Gongen-zukuri=== The name comes from Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b in Nikk\u014d because it enshrines the T\u014dsh\u014d Daigongen (Tokugawa Ieyasu). ===Hachiman-zukuri=== The honden at in Matsuyama, Ehime, is a rare example of the hachiman-zukuri style. The honden (left) is surrounded by a cloister-like corridor called kair\u014d (right). is a style used at Hachiman shrines in which two parallel structures with gabled roofs are interconnected on the non-gabled side, forming one building which, when seen from the side, gives the impression of two.JAANUS, Hachiman-zukuri accessed on December 1, 2009 The front structure is called , the rear one , and together they form the honden. There are entrances at the center of the non-gabled side. In general, the rear structure is 3x2 ken, while the front one is 3x1. The space between the two structures is one ken wide and forms a room called . The actual width and height of this room vary with the shrine. Extant examples are Usa Shrine and Iwashimizu Hachiman-g\u016b. This style, of which only five Edo period examples survive, may be of Buddhist origin, since some Buddhist buildings show the same division. For example, T\u014ddai-ji's hokke-d\u014dLiterally \"Lotus S\u016btra Hall. A hall whose layout allows walking around a statue for meditation is divided in two sections laid out front and back. Structural details also show a strong relationship with the Heian period style called shinden-zukuri used in aristocratic residences. Another possible origin of this style may have been early palaces, known to have had parallel ridges on the roof. ===Hiyoshi-zukuri=== Hiyoshi Taisha's Nishi Hon-g\u016b , also called or is a rare style presently found in only three instances, all at Hiyoshi Taisha in \u014ctsu, Shiga. They are the East and West and the . The building is composed of a 3x2 ken core called moya surrounded on three sides by a 1-ken wide hisashi, totaling 5x3 ken (see photo).JAANUS, Hie- zukuri, accessed on December 1, 2009 The three-sided hisashi is unique and typical of this style. The gabled roof extends in small porticos on the front and the two gabled sides. The roof on the back has a peculiar and characteristic shape. ===Irimoya-zukuri=== A hip-and-gable roof at Shimogamo Shrine is a honden style having a hipA hip roof, or hipped roof, is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls, usually with a fairly gentle slope.-and-gableA gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall enclosed between the edges of a sloping roof. structure, that is, a gabled roof with one or two hips, and is used for example in Kitano Tenman-g\u016b's honden.JAANUS, Irimoya-zukuri, accessed on December 1, 2009 The style is of Chinese origin and arrived in Japan together with Buddhism in the 6th century. It was originally used in the Kon-d\u014d and K\u014d-d\u014d (lecture halls) of Buddhist temples, but started to be used also in shrines later, during the Japanese Middle Ages.Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten (\u5ca9\u6ce2\u65e5\u672c\u53f2\u8f9e\u5178), CD-Rom Version. Iwanami Shoten, 1999-2001. The name derives from its . In Japan the gable is right above the edge of the shrine's moya, while the hip covers the hisashi. In lay architecture it is often called just moya-zukuri. Extant examples are Mikami Shrine in Shiga prefecture and Yasaka Shrine in Kyoto. A gongen-zukuri shrine. From the top: honden, ishi-no-ma, haiden. In yellow the ridges of the various roofs ===Ishi-no-ma-zukuri=== , also called , and is the name of a complex shrine structure in which the haiden, or worship hall, and the honden, or main sanctuary, are interconnected under the same roof in the shape of an H.Encyclopedia of Shinto, Gongen-zukuri accessed on December 2, 2009 The connecting passage can be called , , or . The floor of each of the three halls can be at a different level. If the ai-no-ma is paved with stones it is called ishi-no-ma, whence the name of the style. It can, however, be paved with planks or tatami. Its width is often the same as the honden's, with the haiden from one to three ken wider. One of the oldest examples is Kitano Tenman-g\u016b in Kyoto. The gongen-zukuri name comes from Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b in Nikk\u014d, which enshrines the T\u014dsh\u014d Daigongen (Tokugawa Ieyasu) and adopts this structure.Jaanus, Gongen-zukuri, accessed on December 5, 2009 ===Kibitsu- zukuri=== Kibitsu Shrine's honden-haiden complex. The main entrance (hidden) is on the right. , or is a style characterized by four dormer gables, two per lateral side, on the roof of a very large honden (sanctuary). The gables are set at a right angle to the main roof ridge, and the honden is part of a single complex also including a haiden (worship hall). Kibitsu Shrine in Okayama, Okayama Prefecture, Japan is the sole example of this style. ===Misedana-zukuri=== owes its name to the fact that, unlike the other shrine styles, it doesn't feature a stairway at the entrance, and the veranda is completely flat. It is normally used only in sessha and massha, tiny, 1 ken shrines sometimes found on the premises of larger ones. They can however be as small as beehives or relatively large and have 1x2, 1x3 or even, in one case, 1x7 bays.JAANUS, Misedana-zukuri, accessed on December 1, 2009. Apart from the lack of a staircase, such shrines belong to the nagare-zukuri or kasuga-zukuri styles and have their entrance on the non-gabled (hirairi) or gabled side (tsumairi). ===\u014ctori-zukuri=== The is a tsumairi style named after \u014ctori taisha in \u014csaka. Its floor is elevated and 2x2 ken in size, without a veranda or railings. This style seems to have the same origins as the ancient sumiyoshi- and taisha-zukuri styles, which it resembles, and the absence of a veranda may be due to the use in origin of an earthen floor, still in use in some shrines.JAANUS, Ootori-zukuri, accessed on December 1, 2009 The interior is divided in two, naijin (inner chamber) and gejin (outer chamber). The roof is covered with layers of cypress bark shingles and has a high ridge with an ornamental rather than functional role. It does not curve upwards at the eaves and the bargeboards are simple and straight. Chigi and three katsuogi are present. ===Owari-zukuri=== The Tsushima Shrine in Tsushima, Aichi is a complex style found in large shrines of what used to be called Owari province, near Nagoya. It features many structures within the same compound, among them a honden, a haiden, a tsuriwata-r\u014d (a suspended passageway), a yotsuashimon (a gate built with four pillars), and other buildings. Extant examples of this style include Owari \u014ckunitama Shrine and Tsushima Shrine. ===Primitive shrine layout without honden=== This style is rare, but historically important. It is also unique in that the honden, normally the very center of a shrine, is missing. It is believed shrines of this type are reminiscent of what shrines were like in prehistorical times. The first shrines had no honden because the shintai, or object of worship, was the mountain on which they stood. An extant example is Nara's \u014cmiwa Shrine, which still has no honden. An area near the haiden (hall of worship), sacred and taboo, replaces it for worship. Another prominent example of this style is Futarasan Shrine near Nikk\u014d, whose shintai is Mount Nantai. For details, see Birth and evolution of Shinto shrines above. ===Ry\u014dnagare-zukuri=== is an evolution of the nagare-zukuri in which the roof flows down to form a portico on both non-gabled sides. Examples are the honden at Itsukushima Shrine and at Matsuo Taisha. Ise ===Shinmei-zukuri=== is an ancient style typical of, and most common at Ise Grand Shrine, the holiest of Shinto shrines. It is most common in Mie prefecture.JAANUS, Shinmei-zukuri accessed on December 1, 2009 Characterized by an extreme simplicity, its basic features can be seen in Japanese architecture from the Kofun period (250\u2013538 C.E.) onwards and it is considered the pinnacle of Japanese traditional architecture. Built in planed, unfinished wood, the honden is either 3x2 ken or 1x1ken in size, has a raised floor, a gabled roof with an entry on one the non-gabled sides, no upward curve at the eaves, and decorative logs called chigi and katsuogi protruding from the roof's ridge. The oldest extant example is Nishina Shinmei Shrine, the shrine which gives the style its name. ===Sumiyoshi-zukuri=== Sumiyoshi-taisha's Funatama Jinja takes its name from Sumiyoshi-taisha's honden in \u014csaka. The building is 4 ken wide and 2 ken deep, and has an entrance under the gable.Jinja Kenchiku, Shogakukan Nihon Daihyakka Zensho, accessed on November 29, 2009 Its interior is divided in two sections, one at the front () and one at the back () with a single entrance at the front.JAANUS, Sumiyoshi-zukuri, accessed on December 1, 2009 Construction is simple, but the pillars are painted in vermilion and the walls in white. The style is supposed to have its origin in old palace architecture Another example of this style is Sumiyoshi Jinja, part of the Sumiyoshi Sanjin complex in Fukuoka Prefecture. In both cases, as in many others, there is no veranda. ===Taisha-zukuri=== is the oldest shrine style, takes its name from Izumo Taisha and, like Ise Grand Shrine's, has chigi and katsuogi, plus archaic features like gable-end pillars and a single central pillar (shin no mihashira). Because its floor is raised on stilts, it is believed to have its origin in raised-floor granaries similar to those found in Toro, Shizuoka prefecture.JAANUS, Taisha-zukuri, accessed on December 1, 2009 The honden normally has a 2x2 ken footprint (12.46x12.46 m in Izumo Taisha's case), with an entrance on the gabled end. The stairs to the honden are covered by a cypress bark roof. The oldest extant example of the style is Kamosu Jinja's honden in Shimane prefecture, built in the 16th century. ==Gallery== Image:Kashima-jinja (Takasago,Hyogo) torii1.JPG|A metal torii Image:Hushimi- inari-taisha omotesando.jpg|A sand\u014d Image:Yamatohime-no-miya 03.JPG|A temizuya Image:ItsukushimaKomainu7374.jpg| A komainu Image:IzumoTaisha Honden (detail).jpg|Izumo Taisha's honden Image:Hanazono-jinja haiden.jpeg|Hanazono Jinja's haiden Image:Kasuga-taisha05n3200colortuned.jpg|Kasuga Taisha's heiden Image:Shinra Zenjin Hall.jpg|Hirairi style: entrance on the non-gabled side Image:Hiyoshi-taisha nishihongu2.jpg|The typical shape of the back of a Hiyoshi-zukuri roof Image:Hokora-DSC2202.jpg|A hokora Image:Ootori_Zukuri.jpg|\u014ctori-zukuri Image:Ootori-taisha_main_shrine.jpg|\u014ctori Taisha's honden Image:Katsuragi-jinja (Gose, Nara) massha.jpg|Some setsumatsusha Image:Ise_Shrine_Meizukuri.jpg|Shinmei-zukuri Image:Sumiyoshi shrine Honden.jpg|Sumiyoshi-zukuri Image:Izumo_Shrine_Honden.jpg|Taisha- zukuri, Izumo Taisha ==See also== * Glossary of Shinto ==Notes== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * ",
