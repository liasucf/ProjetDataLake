    "text": "Rodriguez v. United States, 575 U.S. ___ (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case which analyzed whether police officers may extend the length of a traffic stop to conduct a search with a trained detection dog.Rodriguez v. United States, No. 13\u20139972, 575 U.S. ___ (2015), slip op. at 2\u20134. In a 6\u20133 opinion, the Court held that officers may not extend the length of a traffic stop to conduct a dog sniff unrelated to the original purpose of the stop.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1. However, the Court remanded the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to determine whether the officer's extension of the traffic stop was independently justified by reasonable suspicion.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 9. Some analysts have suggested that the Court's decision to limit police authority was influenced by ongoing protests in Ferguson, Missouri.Noah Feldman, , April 21, 2015: The Supreme Court Is Worried About the Police (Accessed July 2, 2015); Mark Joseph Stern, , April 21, 2015: The Ferguson Effect \u2013 Chief Justice Roberts Rules Against Police Abuse at the Supreme Court. Maybe He Finally Gets It. (Accessed July 2, 2015). ==Background== ===Constitutional guidelines for traffic stops=== Criminal detentions generally require probable cause that the suspect is engaged in criminal activity, but an officer may conduct a traffic stop if the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the driver is engaging in criminal activity.Berkemer v. McCarty, ; Delaware v. Prouse, ; Pennsylvania v. Mimms, ; see also Terry v. Ohio, (defining standards for investigatory stops). The Supreme Court of the United States has held that investigative detentions, including traffic stops, \"must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\"Florida v. Royer, . Consequently, traffic stops may become unreasonable if they are unnecessarily prolonged.United States v. Sharpe, . When an officer conducts a traffic stop based on reasonable suspicion that the driver has committed a traffic violation, the Fourth Amendment permits the officer to conduct a number of investigative inquiries before resolving the traffic stop.See, e.g., Arizona v. Johnson, . For example, officers may question the vehicle\u2019s occupants about matters unrelated to the traffic violation, and officers may walk a drug detection dog around the outside of the vehicle during the stop.Johnson, 555 U.S. at 333; Illinois v. Caballes, (holding that officers may conduct a dog sniff incident to a lawful traffic stop). Officers may briefly prolong traffic stops to conduct these inquiries so long as the officer performs his tasks in an amount of time \"reasonably needed to effectuate\" the law enforcement purpose of the stop.United States v. Sharpe, . ===Arrest of Dennys Rodriguez=== On the evening of March 27, 2012, Dennys Rodriguez was stopped by a police officer on a highway near Waterloo, Nebraska, after the officer observed him swerve out of his lane of traffic.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 16\u201319. When the officer approached the vehicle, he reported an \"overwhelming\" scent of air-fresheners emanating from the car.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 20. After questioning Rodriguez and another passenger in the car, the officer placed a call for backup and conducted a records check on the vehicle\u2019s passenger.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 23\u201327. The officer handed a warning ticket to Rodriguez, and then proceeded to walk Floyd, his drug detection dog, around the outside of Rodriguez\u2019s vehicle.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 28\u201329. When the dog indicated the presence of drugs, the officer searched the car and discovered methamphetamine inside the vehicle.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 33\u201334. The officer reported that approximately seven or eight minutes passed between the time he issued the warning ticket to the time at which the dog indicated the presence of drugs.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 34. Dennys Rodriguez was arrested on a highway near Waterloo, Nebraska (pictured). ===Trial and appeal to Eighth Circuit=== On May 22, 2012, Rodriguez was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 114. Rodriguez filed a motion to suppress evidence discovered by the drug detection dog, arguing that an officer may not extend an already completed traffic stop to conduct a canine sniff without reasonable suspicion or other lawful justification.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 6, 12. However, the district court denied the motion.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 112. On January 17, 2013, Rodriguez filed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to review the denial of his motion to suppress.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 11. On January 31, 2014, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to deny Rodriguez\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence.United States v. Rodriguez, 741 F.3d 905, 908 (8th Cir. 2014). The Eighth Circuit held that a seven- to eight-minute detention was de minimis and reasonable in order to ensure officer safety.United States v. Rodriguez, 741 F.3d 905, 907\u201308 (8th Cir. 2014). Rodriguez appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on October 2, 2014.Rodriguez v. United States, 135 S.Ct. 43 (2014) (granting certiorari). ==Opinion of the Court== In her majority opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (pictured) held that \"a dog sniff is not fairly characterized as part of the officer\u2019s traffic mission.\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 7. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that \"a police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the matter for which the stop was made violates the Constitution\u2019s shield against unreasonable seizures.\" Consequently, a traffic stop becomes unlawful if \"it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete the mission of issuing a ticket for the violation.\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Justice Ginsburg wrote that the purpose of the initial stop in this case was to investigate why Rodriguez swerved out of his lane of traffic.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 5. Therefore, the officer's authority to continue the stop ended once he completed his investigation of that infraction. Because the dog sniff was unrelated to the investigation of the original traffic infraction, the officer should not have extended the stop absent \"independently supported reasonable suspicion\" for the dog sniff.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 7\u20139. The Court then remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit to determine whether the officer did, in fact, have an independent basis for conducting the dog sniff. ===Dissenting opinions=== Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Samuel Alito each wrote a dissenting opinion. Justice Thomas argued that the brief extension to conduct a dog sniff was reasonable and that \"conducting a dog sniff does not change the character of a traffic stop that is lawful at its inception and otherwise executed in a reasonable manner.\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1, 9\u201310 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Illinois v. Caballes, (internal quotation marks omitted). He also argued that the dog sniff was independently justified by the officer's reasonable suspicion that Rodriguez and his passenger were engaged in criminal activity.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 10\u201312 (Thomas, J., dissenting). In a one-paragraph dissenting opinion, Justice Kennedy wrote that he agreed with all of Justice Thomas' opinion, except his conclusion that the officer had reasonable suspicion.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Because the Eighth Circuit did not address the question of whether the officer had reasonable suspicion, he argued \"the better course would be to allow that court to do so in the first instance.\" Justice Alito wrote a dissent in which he characterized the majority opinion as \"unnecessary, impractical, and arbitrary.\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1 (Alito, J., dissenting). He argued that the dog sniff was justified because the facts of the case \"easily meet our standard for reasonable suspicion.\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1\u20132 (Alito, J., dissenting) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Justice Alito also criticized Justice Ginsburg's opinion for ignoring concerns of officer safety, and that the occupants of the car may have attacked the officer if he conducted the dog sniff before backup arrived.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Alito, J., dissenting). Additionally, Justice Alito claimed it was \"arbitrary\" for the court to hold the Fourth Amendment was violated \"simply because of the sequence in which Officer Struble chose to perform his tasks.\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 3 (Alito, J., dissenting). ==Afterward== On remand, the Eighth Circuit ruled that because the police could rely in good faith on binding precedent from the Eighth Circuit, which at the time of the stop held that briefly prolonging a stop was legal, Rodriguez was entitled to no relief.United States v. Rodriguez, 799 F.3d 1222, 1223-24 (8th Cir. 2015). The United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of that decision. Rodriguez v. United States, 136 S.Ct. 1514 (Mem) (2016). ==Commentary and analysis== Commentators have observed that Rodriguez represents a significant departure from the Court's prior dog sniff cases and that the Court's \"view of the canine sniff investigatory technique is evolving.\"Leslie Shoebotham, , April 22, 2015: Guest Blog: Leslie Shoebotham, SCOTUS: No Post-\u201cTraffic Mission\u201d Dog Sniffs Without Reasonable Suspicion (Accessed July 2, 2015). One analyst suggested the Court \"is quietly distancing itself from its decision three decades ago in United States v. Place,\"United States v. Place, . where the Court held that a dog sniff is not a search under the Fourth Amendment. Other commentators praised the case for \"strengthening\" and \"reinvigorating\" constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio observed that despite the Supreme Court's favorable ruling, Rodriguez \"is not free of legal trouble yet\" because the Eighth Circuit may, and ultimately did, rule the dog sniff was permissible.Nina Totenberg, , April 21, 2015: Supreme Court: Police May Not Detain Traffic Violators Longer Than Necessary (Accessed July 2, 2015).Rordriguez, 799 F.3d 1222, 1223-24. Some analysts have also suggested that the Court's opinion was influenced by ongoing protests in Ferguson, Missouri. One commentator suggested the court's decision may have been shaped, in part, by recent high-profile \"killings of black men by police\" and that the Court's opinion was \"affected by changing social attitudes\" about the role of police in society.Noah Feldman, , April 21, 2015: The Supreme Court Is Worried About the Police (Accessed July 2, 2015). Another suggested that Chief Justice John Roberts may have been influenced by the shooting of Michael Brown and that he \"learned the lessons of Ferguson and is trading in his logical abstractions for some much-needed legal realism.\"Mark Joseph Stern, , April 21, 2015: The Ferguson Effect \u2013 Chief Justice Roberts Rules Against Police Abuse at the Supreme Court.
