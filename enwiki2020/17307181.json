    "text": "Point de Bute is an unincorporated community in Westmorland County, New Brunswick, Canada. The local service district of Pointe de Bute takes its name from the community but uses a different spelling. ==History== William Black would have preached. The Acadian Pierre Buhot settled here in the late 1600s, and the original name was Pont \u00e0 Buhot which evolved, via Pont \u00e0 Buot to the current name. Opposite his house was a bridge over the Missaguash River, leading to the Tantramar Marsh. It was near the outlet of a stream, Rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Ours and a redoubt, which was the first point of attack by Monckton's army in 1755 as it advanced from Fort Lawrence to cross the Missaguash river on the way to attack Fort Beausejour. ==Notable people== Point de Bute is the birthplace of the British Columbian transportation pioneer Stephen Tingley, World War I flying ace Albert Desbrisay Carter, and the scientist Edwin Colpitts. ==See also== *List of communities in New Brunswick ==References== Category:Communities in Westmorland County, New Brunswick Category:Local service districts of Westmorland County, New Brunswick ",
