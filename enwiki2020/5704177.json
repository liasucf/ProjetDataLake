South Africa, led by Ashwell Prince, batted first after winning the toss, compiling 169 before being dismissed on the first-day tea break. Sri Lanka lost two early wickets before a record-breaking 624 run partnership between Kumar Sangakkara (287) and captain Mahela Jayawardene (374; 26 runs short of Brian Lara's world-record individual score of 400). This partnership was particularly savage on spinner Nicky Boje, who ended with bowling figures of 0/221 from 65 overs. Sri Lanka were able to declare their innings closed at 756/5, leaving South Africa needing 587 runs just to make the home side bat again. Despite an opening partnership of 165, and solid performances in the middle order, Muttiah Muralitharan's 6/131 restricted South Africa to 434. Sri Lanka leads to two-Test series 1\u20130.
