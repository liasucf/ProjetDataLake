Some of the gold mined from the area was used to build Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b, a Shinto shrine in Tochigi Prefecture dedicated to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Agate was found in Hanaishi in 1877. Mining was started by Oshima Kanzaemon. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of people arrived in the area to mine existing seams of manganese, gold and silver and by the middle of the Meiji era many had settled in the Shiribetsu river area. The town was granted independent status as the village of Toshibetsu and formed from the neighboring town of Setana in 1897. It was settled by Norioshi Shikata and 15 other families, including the Imamura and Kanamori houses. These families had arrived in the area during the preceding five years and laid out the town into 129 housing sites, a city hall and a police station. Toshibetsu village formally received the name of Imakane in 1947 as part of its upgrade to town status. The name was taken from the family names of its two celebrated pioneers, and . The town's constitution was established on October 1, 1967. Imakane celebrated its 100th year of autonomous government on July 15, 1997. ==Immanuel Church== One of the attractions in rural Imakane is a very old church. In May 1881 Yoshiyuki Shikata and 10 other devout Christian students of the Doshisha University in Kyoto, settled in Imakane. They built a straw thatched church in March 1896 as their spiritual base and they worked hard on the land while leading a frugal religious life. In 1918 the church was rebuilt with wooden walls and again in November 1968 to its present-day state. The name of the church is; Immanuel which means \"God with us\" in Hebrew. However, during the war years foreign words were strictly controlled by the government so they changed the name to and the surrounding area to \u795e\u4e18, meaning \"God\u2019s land\" to preserve their religion. It was in this area around the church that Ginko Ogino, the first woman doctor in Japan, lived for a while. She had run her own hospital in Tokyo, but her second husband, Yoshiyuki Shikata, came to Hokkaido and settled in this area. She followed him, but the couple left a few years later. She was also the heroine in the novel \u201cHana-uzumi\u201d written by Japanese writer Jun\u2019ichi Watanabe, who used to be a doctor in Hokkaido. ==Industry== Today Imakane's main industry is farming. Imakane is famous nationwide for potatoes, especially the Danshaku variety. Fishing is also widespread; yamame, ayu, unagi, and iwana can be found in the area. ==Culture== Imakane has a number of festivals, including the Snow festival in mid February (usually the weekend after Sapporo's) and the Autumn Festival on September 19 and 20 every year. ==Symbol of the Town== The symbol of Imakane comprises the meandering Toshibetsu River and the 1st letter of \u8fb2\u8015 (farming) which can be written in katakana as \u30ce and pronounced \"no\". This symbol was decided upon by a public competition on the town\u2019s 70th anniversary (1967) Another symbol of Imakane is a large windmill located in the center of town where the old train station stood. It is called \"De Moren Imakane\". The Name \"De Moren\" is Dutch for \"windmill\".
