    "text": "The Beethoven-Haydn-Mozart Memorial () is an outdoor 1904 memorial to the classical composers Ludwig van Beethoven, Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, designed by Rudolf and Wolfgang Siemering and located in Tiergarten, Berlin, Germany. The monument was commissioned by Kaiser Wilhelm II. The monument suffered considerable damage during WWII and was not fully restored until 2007. After two years of restoration works, the Beethoven-Haydn-Mozart Denkmal was re-erected that year, providing the revitalized monument that can be seen today. ==See also== * 1904 in art ==References== ==External links== * Category:1904 establishments in Germany Category:1904 sculptures Category:Cultural depictions of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Category:Joseph Haydn Category:Monuments and memorials in Berlin Category:Monuments to composers Category:Outdoor sculptures in Berlin Category:Statuary of Ludwig van Beethoven Category:Tiergarten (park) ",
