    "text": "The Artists Project, formerly known as The Starving Artists Project, captures press portrait photography. This project provides press photo sessions for celebrities and then donates the rest of the day for artists, musicians, actors, or anyone in need of portrait photography, all on a donation basis. If attendees cannot afford to pay anything The Artists Project will provide press photography for free. This project uses the leverage of brands and celebrities to help get photography to starving artists. These press photos are taken in Los Angeles, CA in the home of the project's founder Michael Bezjian, who is a Getty Images contributing photographer. Bezjian not only photographs celebrities, which are referred to as Posing Heroes, but artists who have not yet broken into their careers, referred to by this project as \"the Artists.\" > \"We don't want their money. We will also set people up if they can't afford > transportation.\" > \\- Michael Bezjian > The SAP Founder The Artists Project also offers internships to those interested in gaining experience with photography, media coverage, production, videography, stylizing, editing, graphic designing, professional hair and make-up, and all umbrella aspects of the project and its respective industry, entertainment.
