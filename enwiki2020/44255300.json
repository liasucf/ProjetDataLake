In a race umpired by Robert Lewis-Lloyd, Oxford won by a margin of three lengths in a time of 21 minutes 51 seconds taking the overall record to 20-17 in their favour. ==Background== The Boat Race is an annual rowing eight competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. First held in 1829, the competition is a race along The Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the previous year's race by lengths, and held the overall lead, with 19 victories to Cambridge's 17 (excluding the \"dead heat\" of 1877). Cambridge were coached by Constantine William Benson (who rowed for Cambridge in the 1872, 1873 and 1875 races), Charles Gurdon (a Blue four times from 1876 to 1879), Thomas Edmund Hockin (also rowed four times from 1876 to 1879) and Edward Henry Prest (who represented Cambridge in the 1878, 1879 and 1880 races).Burnell, pp. 103-108 Oxford's coaches were S. D. Darbishire (who rowed for Oxford in the 1868, 1869 and 1870 races), William Grenfell (who rowed in 1877 and 1879, and was non-rowing boat club president in 1879), H. B. Southwell (a Blue three times from 1878 to 1880) and W. B. Woodgate (who rowed twice, in the 1862 and 1863 races).Burnell, pp. 97-102, 110-111 The umpire for the race was Robert Lewis-Lloyd (who had rowed for Cambridge four times between 1856 and 1859)Burnell, p. 106 and the starter was Edward Searle.Burnell, p. 49 The night before the race, an anniversary dinner was held to belatedly commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the event. ==Crews== The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11 st 11.75 lb (75.0 kg), more than their opponents. Cambridge's crew included two former Blues, with Humphrey Sandford making his third appearance in the event. Oxford saw five rowers with Boat Race experience return, including J. H. T. Wharton who was rowing for a third time. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col| Seat ! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col| Oxford 30px ! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col| Cambridge 30px |- ! Name !

In a cold north-easterly wind, the race commenced at 8.24 a.m. with the Dark Blues outrating Cambridge and taking an early lead. Taking advantage of the favourable bend in the river, Oxford were half-a-length ahead by the Crab Tree pub. Cambridge began to reduce the deficit as Oxford decreased their stroke rate, and by Harrods Furniture Depository the crews were nearly level. Although the bend of the river now was in favour of Cambridge, Oxford increased their rating once again and by Hammersmith Bridge held a three- quarter-length lead. They held off spurts from the Light Blues along Chiswick Reach and by Chiswick Eyot were clear. A two-length lead at Barnes Railway Bridge was increased to three by the time Oxford passed the finishing post, winning in a time of 21 minutes 51 seconds.Drinkwater, p. 77Burnell, p. 62 It was Oxford's second consecutive victory and took the overall record to 20-17 in their favour. ==References== Notes Bibliography * * ==External links== * Official website Category:The Boat Race Category:1881 in English sport Category:April 1881 sports events ",
