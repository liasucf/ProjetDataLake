Bill said to him \"Jerry, look at this album we doing , it's the Bad Back Seven album.\" Jerry asks him what he want him to do and Curtis says \"I don't know... let's do a rap man!\" Jerry said the following sentence, \"Do a rap? Hell, we can't even talk!\" Curtis recalls, \"One of the roaders is in the studio with us... Avery, and he said \"Hey man, I got a buddy who lives up there in the projects, he's a great rapper.\", and I said \"Can he rap?\" and he said, \"Yeah man!\" and I said \"Bring him in, tomorrow night.\" and he brought in Timothy Washington and I had to track him down 8 hours in Venice and everything. I flew him in on the trip and I said \"Hey man, go in there and start rapping.\" , and he just started rapping... and that's how it all came about.\" ==References== ==External links== *Fatback Band official site. *Bill Curtis Music.
