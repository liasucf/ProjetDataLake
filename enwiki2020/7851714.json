    "text": "Jingle Cats is a series of Christmas novelty recordings from producer Mike Spalla. The songs are created by Spalla who mixes actual animal sounds to match tones of the songs. He started with a version of \"Jingle Bells\" that was released to radio stations a few years before the full album came out. In all, it took more than 1,000 meows, screeches and growls to assemble 20 melodies.Wharton, David (1993). \"It's the Cats' Meows.\" Los Angeles Times. 1(3). In 1995, Here Comes Santa Claws won a \"Billie\" award from Billboard for point-of-purchase category. After following up what Billboard called \"excellent\" Jingle Cats and Jingle Dogs albums, Spalla also produced a Jingle Babies album for which Billboard described the series as having hit a \"brick wall\". ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Meowy Christmas (1993) *Here Comes Santa Claws (1994) *Rhythm and Mews (2002) *First Meowel (2009) ===Videos=== * Jingle Cats Christmas (2012) HD Blu-ray ===Jingle Dogs recordings=== * Christmas Unleashed (1995) * Puppy Holidays (2008) ===Jingle Babies recordings=== * Rockabye Christmas (1997) ==See also== * Cat Organ \u2014 a conjectural musical instrument using live cats * The Singing Dogs \u2014 a classic novelty recording project from the 1950s ==References== ==External links== *Jingle Cats official site Category:1990s Christmas albums Category:2000s Christmas albums Category:Cats in popular culture Category:Zoomusicology ",
