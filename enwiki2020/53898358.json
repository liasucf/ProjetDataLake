    "text": "Nilima Sheikh (born 18 November 1945, in New Delhi) is a visual artist based in Baroda, India. Since the mid-80s, Sheikh has done extensive research about traditional art forms in India, advocated for the sustainability of the practice of traditional painters, and used a wide range of visual and literary sources in her work. Her work focuses on displacement, longing, historical lineage, tradition, communal violence, and the ideas of femininity. She uses paper, painting, installation, large scrolls, theater set designs, as well as illustrations for children's books. She started exhibiting her work in 1969 and has participated in numerous group exhibitions, most recently documenta 14, Athens and Kassel in 2017. Her first museum exhibition was organized by The Art Institute of Chicago in 2014. == Education == Sheikh studied history at the Delhi University between 1962 and 1965, and received her Master of Fine Arts from the Faculty of Fine Arts, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in 1971. She was influenced by artists such as Kanwal Krishna, Devayani Krishna, and K.G. Subramanyan, and attributes the older Santiniketan experiment, Baroda's weightage to art history, and her earlier education in history as major influences. Sheikh who originally trained in Western-style oil painting and later transitioned to a self-taught miniature painter due to her interests in historical traditions of painting in Asia. She has also stated to be influenced by pre-modern Rajput and Mughal court paintings, especially traditional tempera paintings like Pichhwai and Thangka paintings. == Research and works == In the mid-1980s, she received a fellowship to document the traditional art forms, especially Picchwai paintings of Nathdwara. She made drawings of the motifs of these art forms, documented the tools and methods they use, and also corresponded with organizations related to cultural heritage to ask for support for the preservation of these art forms. After the inner turmoil that she experienced post the Gujarat riots in 2002, she was spurred to take up a long-pending art project that dealt with the Kashmiri poet Agha Shahid Ali\u2019s soul-stirring verses full of pain that inspired it. Nilima Sheikh won\u2019t term references in her work as religious, but more art historical in nature, all part of a history that we tend to term tradition or mythology. Actually it is history, part of one\u2019s past, she explains, adding that it\u2019s not merely Western art history. == Exhibitions == Solo exhibitions include Terrain: Carrying Across, Leaving Behind, Gallery Chemould, Mumbai (2017); \"Each night put Kashmir in your dreams,\" Chemould Prescott Road, Mumbai (2010), Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi (2010), and The Art Institute of Chicago (2014); Drawing Trails, Gallery Espace, Delhi, India (2009); The Country Without A Post Office, Gallery Chemould, Mumbai (2003); Painted Drawings, Gallery Espace, New Delhi (1999); and Images from Umrao, Galerie FIA, Amsterdam (1998).
