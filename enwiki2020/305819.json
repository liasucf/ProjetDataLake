    "text": "Olivenza () or Oliven\u00e7a () is a town situated on a disputed section of the Portugal\u2013Spain border. Its territory is administered by Spain as a municipality belonging to the province of Badajoz, and to the wider autonomous community of Extremadura. Portugal does not recognise Spanish sovereignty over the territory, based on its interpretation of the rulings of the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Spain accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, Oliven\u00e7a and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and this question remains unresolvedRongxing Guo, Territorial Disputes and Resource Management: A Global Handbook, Nova Science Publisher/New York, 2007. page 199 and Portugal holds a claim over it. The town of Oliven\u00e7a was under Portuguese sovereignty between 1297 (Treaty of Alca\u00f1ices) and 1801, when it was invaded by the Spanish during the War of the Oranges and ceded to Spain that year under the Treaty of Badajoz. Spain has since administered the territory (now split into two municipalities, Olivenza and also T\u00e1liga), whilst Portugal invokes the self-revocation of the Treaty of Badajoz, plus the Treaty of Vienna of 1815, to claim the return of the territory. In spite of the territorial dispute between Portugal and Spain, the issue has not been a sensitive matter in the relations between these two countries.Portugal desmiente a la CIA y niega que haya un conflicto por Olivenza Martins da Cruz Afirma Que a Quest\u00e3o de Oliven\u00e7a \"Est\u00e1 Congelada\" Olivenza and other neighbouring Spanish (La Codosera, Alburquerque and Badajoz) and Portuguese (Arronches, Campo Maior, Estremoz, Portalegre and Elvas) towns reached an agreement in 2008 to create a euroregion.Europacto en la frontera hispano-lusa Euroregi\u00e3o e Declara\u00e7\u00e3o de Oliven\u00e7a ==Geography== province of Badajoz. Oliven\u00e7a in the former Alto Alentejo Province. Olivenza is located on the left (east) bank of the Guadiana river, at an equal distance of south of Elvas in Portugal and Badajoz in Spain. The territory is triangular, with a smaller side resting on the Guadiana and the opposite vertex entering south-east and surrounded by Spanish territory. By an agreement between Spain and Portugal, the left bank of the river was recognized as being Portuguese territory (to a non-defined width, though), which sets the de facto border in that area. Besides the town, the municipality of Olivenza includes six villages: (), (), (), (), (), and (). Another village, , was detached to become the seat of a separate municipality in 1850. Total population is 10,762 (2002), of which 8,274 live in Olivenza. The total area is . Like the surrounding regions, population density is low, at 11 inhabitants per km\u00b2. Some monuments include the church of Saint Mary of the Castle (, ), Holy Ghost Chapel (, ), Saint Mary Magdalene Church (, , considered a masterwork of Portuguese Manueline architecture), Saint John of God Monastery (, ), the keep (, ), and the ruins of the Our Lady of Help Bridge (, , destroyed in 1709 and never rebuilt). There are still traces of Portuguese culture and language in the people, although the younger generations speak Spanish only. At the beginning of the 1940s the city was reportedly mainly Portuguese-speaking, but after the 1940s a language shift towards Spanish took place. ==Chronology== Manueline door of Olivenza town hall Ruins of 16th-century Ponte da Ajuda over the Guadiana, in the ancient road between Elvas and Olivenza Part of an 18th-century Spanish map, showing Olivenza as part of Portugal Portuguese late Gothic-style interior of Santa Maria Madalena church *1170 \u2013 Olivenza region falls for the first time into Portuguese hands during the conquests of Afonso Henriques, the first king of Portugal. *1189 \u2013 Muslims retake the region. *1230 \u2013 The Olivenza area (as part of the Badajoz surroundings) is taken from the Muslims by King Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n. *1259 \u2013 The Knights Templar already established in the nearby town of Alconchel, create the first settlement that can be identified as the origin of the town of Olivenza.

Quidnovi, Matosinhos/Lisbon, 2007, **6 June 1801 \u2013 The war is over with the simultaneous signing of two treaties in Badajoz, Spain, the first between France and Portugal, and the second between Spain and Portugal. As both treaties mention each other and share common clauses, they are frequently referred to as just the Treaty of Badajoz. Under one of the terms of the Treaty, Spain gives back all the occupied towns except those on the left bank of the Guadiana river (the territory of Olivenza), which are ceded by Portugal to Spain, including its inhabitants, on a 'perpetual' basis. The Treaty also stipulates that the breach of any of its articles leads to its cancellation.in Ant\u00f3nio Ventura, Guerra das Laranjas, Ed.

The Spanish representative to the Congress, Pedro Gomes Labrador, refuses to sign the Treaty, registering a protest against several of the Congress resolutions, including article 105. **27 October 1815 \u2013 Expecting the quick restitution of Olivenza, Prince Regent John nominates Jos\u00e9 Luiz de Sousa as Plenipotentiary. *29 January 1817 \u2013 Portugal occupies Uruguay due to rebel threats against Brasil. *7 May 1817 \u2013 Spain finally signs the Treaty of Vienna, since, in the Spanish interpretation, the text is not mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza to Portugal. However, the text clearly states that all the signatary winning powers promise to take all efforts to make sure that Olivenza is returned to Portugal. *1818\u20131819 \u2013 Spain and Portugal, with the mediation of France, England, Russia and Austria, negotiate in the Conference of Paris toward a peaceful restitution of Uruguay to Spain.

The demarcation of the border is not pursued further because of the situation of Olivenza. *1918/1919 \u2013 With the end of World War I, the Portuguese government studies the possibility of taking the situation of Olivenza to the Paris Peace Conference. However, as Spain had not participated in the War, the intervention of the international community in this issue is not possible. *29 June 1926 \u2013 Portugal and Spain sign the Convention of Limits (1926) an agreement demarcating the border from the confluence of Ribeira de Cuncos with the Guadiana, just south of Olivenza, to the estuary of the Guadiana, on the far South. The border between Portugal and Spain from the confluence of the Caya river to the confluence of the Cuncos is not demarcated and remains so nowadays, with the Guadiana being the de facto border. *1936\u20131939 \u2013 During the Spanish Civil War, Portuguese Colonel Rodrigo Pereira Botelho volunteers to occupy Olivenza.

All frontier rivers (including the non-demarcated section in the Guadiana river) are covered, distributing the hydraulic exploitation between both countries. The hydraulic exploitation of the non- demarcated section in the Guadiana river is assigned to Portugal (in the same way as the rights on hydraulic exploitation over other frontier rivers are assigned either to Portugal or to Spain). The only difference between this section and the rest is that the term \"international\" is omitted (all the sections are named \"international section\" but the non-demarcated one in the Guadiana river).Instrumento de ratificaci\u00f3n del Convenio y Protocolo adicional entre Espa\u00f1a y Portugal para regular el uso y aprovechamiento hidr\u00e1ulico de los tramos internacionales de los r\u00edos Limia, Mi\u00f1o, Tajo, Guadiana y Chanza y sus afluentes, firmado en Madrid el 29 de mayo de 1968..

Portugal is now in full charge of constructing the new bridge and preserving the old bridge, therefore not putting the Portuguese claim to the territory of Olivenza at stake. *March 1995 \u2013 The Portuguese government sends its Spanish counterpart a study on the effects of the construction of the Alqueva Dam on Spanish territory. Information on Olivenza is not included. Later, Portugal sends further information, including data on Olivenza, under the title \"Territory of Spain and Olivenza\". *October 1999 \u2013 The Spanish police stop preservation works being undertaken by the Portuguese on the old Ponte da Ajuda Bridge on the left bank (Spanish side) of the Guadiana river. The Portuguese had been working on that side of the bridge without Spanish permits assuming that the left bank-side of the Guadiana river belonged to Portugal, according to the 1968 covenant. In subsequent events, a Portuguese court order prevents Spain from taking over the works. *11 November 2000 \u2013 The new Olivenza Bridge, constructed by Portugal, is inaugurated. *2003 **Spain restarts work on the old bridge, under protest from the Portuguese government. *2004 **25 June 2004 \u2013 The Portuguese parliament raises the issue of Olivenza and exhorts the Minister of Foreign Affairs to try to solve the question, in a friendly and cooperative way, with Spain and the people of Olivenza, within the European Union. **4 September 2004 \u2013 The Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonio Martins da Cruz states that the Olivenza issue \"is frozen\".Martins da Cruz Afirma Que a Quest\u00e3o de Oliven\u00e7a \"Est\u00e1 Congelada\" , P\u00fablico.\u00abUna cuesti\u00f3n congelada\u00bb, seg\u00fan Portugal , ABC, September 15, 2004 **7 September 2004 \u2013 The Government of the autonomous community of Extremadura declares the old Ponte da Ajuda Bridge a Heritage Monument.RESOLUCI\u00d3N de 6 de septiembre de 2004, de la Consejer\u00eda de Cultura, por la que se incoa expediente de declaraci\u00f3n de bien de inter\u00e9s cultural, para el puente de Ajuda en la localidad de Olivenza (Badajoz) . *2007 \u2013 Guillermo Fernandez Vara, who was born in Olivenza, is elected president of Extremadura. *2010 \u2013 The ancient Portuguese street names, that were removed in the first half of the 20th century, return to the historical city centre of Oliven\u00e7a. *December 2014 \u2013 Portuguese Nationality is given to 80 residents of Olivenza, after their formal request.

During the War of the Oranges, French and Spanish troops, under the command of Manuel de Godoy, took the town on May 20, 1801. In the aftermath of that conflict, the Treaty of Badajoz was signed, with the Olivenza territory remaining a part of Spain. Spain claims \u2018de jure\u2019 sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz still stands and has never been revoked, thus making the case that the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be demarcated as said by the treaty. Portugal claims de jure sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds of the cancellation of the Treaty of Badajoz, since it was revoked by its own terms. The breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation, and that happened when Spain invaded Portugal in the Peninsular War of 1807. Portugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 (which Spain signed in 1817) that states that the winning countries are \"committed to employ the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza to Portuguese authority\" and that the winning countries \"recognize that the return of Olivenza and its territories must be done\". Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be demarcated by the Treaty of Alcanizes of 1297. Spain interprets Article 105 as not being mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza to Portugal, thus not revoking the Treaty of Badajoz. Portugal has never made a formal claim to the territory after the Treaty of Vienna, but neither has it directly acknowledged Spanish sovereignty over Olivenza. Portuguese military maps do not show the border at that area, implying it to be undefined. Also, the latest road connection between Olivenza and Portugal (entirely paid by the Portuguese state, although it involved the building of a bridge over the Guadiana, an international river) has no indication of the Portuguese border, again implying an undefined status. There is no research on the opinion of the inhabitants of Olivenza about their status. Spanish public opinion is not generally aware of the Portuguese claim on Olivenza. On the other hand, awareness in Portugal has been increasing under the efforts of pressure groups to have the question raised and debated in public. == Famous people born in Olivenza == * Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Vara (1958) \u2013 Spanish politician, president of Extremadura. * Pedro da Fonseca (?\u20131422) \u2013 Portuguese cardinal. * Paulo da Gama (1465-1499), Vasco da Gama's elder brother, commander of S\u00e3o Rafael in the discovery of the route to India. * Vicente Lusitano (c. 1461 \u2013 c. 1561) \u2013 Portuguese composer and music theoretician. * Tom\u00e1s Romero de Castilla (1833\u20131910) \u2013 Spanish theologian, founder of the Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Provincial de Badajoz. ==References== ==External links== *CIA World Factbook reference to Olivenza in the \"Disputes \u2013 international\" section on the Spain page * Official Map of Portugal with Olivenza IGEOE *Official Portuguese statements GAO *CIA World Factbook reference to Oliven\u00e7a in the \"Disputes \u2013 international\" section on the Portugal page * Olivenza in the official website of the Province of Badajoz * Olivenza in the official website for Tourism in the Region of Extremadura * Website for Portuguese pressure group \"Group of Friends of Olivenza\" * Portuguese, Spanish Website for Oliventino cultural group Alemguadiana Category:Municipalities in the Province of Badajoz Category:Portugal\u2013Spain border Category:Territorial disputes of Portugal Category:Territorial disputes of Spain Category:Municipalities of \u00c9vora District ",
