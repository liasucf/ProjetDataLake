In 2011 the population was 819 Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica in an area of 5.81 km\u00b2.Eurostat It is situated on the Ave River near the north-eastern frontier with the municipality of Barcelos, and resides in the shadow of its larger municipal neighbor. ==History== The exact toponymy of this parish is not certain. It may have been named after a Casais Moorish castle with the same name, a Roman bridge near Monte da Reguenga, or a subterranean road that led to the Este River, where travelers stopped to water their horses.Manuel Fernando Soares Pinho (2005) It is very likely that a medieval castle existed in Argifonso, since multiple structures and a castro were discovered in the vicinity, but Moorish influences in the Iberian peninsula only occurred at the end of 711. During Roman occupation, any settlements would have maintained cultivated fields, causing the abandonment of the castros. The Castro of Casais still presents vestiges of the Castro culture and Roman artifacts. Legend refers to an ecclesiastical parish dedicated to Sant'Iago in Moldes, although no documented proof of this legend exists. The parish's landmark, the bridge spanning the Ave River, dates back to the 12th century, though historians suggest that an ancient bridge spanned the river prior to 1140. Medieval documents refer to this bridge as the via vecteris (old way), alluding to its Roman origin. In 1836, Arcos was included as part of Vila do Conde. There is a reference to S\u00e3o Miguel de Arcos in the ecclesiastical census in Braga and Guimar\u00e3es during the 11th century (1078-1091). However, neither records from the census administered by bishop D. Pedro, in the S\u00e9 Cathedral in Braga, nor the 1220 inventory of Afonso II of Portugal ever refer to Arcos as an ecclesiastical parish. ==Geography== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right;\" | |} Arcos is situated north of the Ave River and alongside the Este River in the north-eastern portion of Vila de Condo, near the municipality of Barcelos.
