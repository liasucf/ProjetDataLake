A history of Texas, commissioned by the U.S. government's Federal Writers' Project in 1934, noted that \"The borders of New Santander did not stop at the Rio Bravo\" (the Mexican name for the Rio Grande); and added that the borders \"went north to the Nueces, near Corpus Christi, then west and north to the Medina, then south again on a line along Laredo to the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madres, deep in Mexico.\" Federal Writers' Project, The WPA Guide to Texas: The Lone Star State (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1934, reprinted by Trinity University Press, 2013) Nuevo Santander was named after Santander, Cantabria, Spain, and settled by Spanish American colonists in a concerted settlement campaign peaking in 1748\u20131750. It fell under the jurisdiction of the Real Audiencia of Guadalajara in judicial matters, and in 1776 Nuevo Santander became part of the semi-autonomous Provincias Internas. Jos\u00e9 de Escand\u00f3n founded the colony in 1747. In 1755 Jim\u00e9nez was founded which became the major town and capital of the colony. The state was subsequently renamed to Tamaulipas once Mexico gained its independence in 1821. ==See also== *Governors of Nuevo Santander *History of Mexico *History of Texas *Brownsville, Texas *Laredo, Texas *Blas Mar\u00eda de la Garza Falc\u00f3n *New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n *Eastern Internal Provinces ==References== *Some historical and genealogical information on Nuevo Santander ==External links== *Worldstatesmen.org: Provinces of New Spain Category:New Spain Category:Colonial Mexico Category:Former provinces of Spain Category:Former states of Mexico Category:Mexican Texas Category:Tamaulipas Category:States and territories established in 1746 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1821 Category:1746 establishments in New Spain Category:1821 disestablishments in New Spain Category:1740s establishments in Mexico Category:1821 disestablishments in Mexico ",
