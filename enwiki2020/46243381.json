Keykubat assigned \u00c7oban as the commander of the sea campaign to Sudak in 1223. \u00c7oban captured the city and the Kypchacks declared their loyalty to Keykubat. He returned to Sinop in 1224.Enfal history page According to Sel\u00e7ukname the history book written by Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu Ali, an Ottoman historian of the early 15th century, when Keykubat travelled to east to take precations against a possible Mongol invasion, his regent in west Anatolia was H\u00fcsamettin \u00c7oban with Ertu\u011frul (father of Osman I of the Ottoman Empire) and his brother being his subordinates.Y\u00fccel-Sevim p. 183 ==The beylik== In historical documents his name is not mentioned after the campaign to Sudak.
