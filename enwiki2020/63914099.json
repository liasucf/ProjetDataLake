    "text": "Bori\u0107evi\u0107 dynasty was the first known family who ruled Bosnia as Bans of Bosnia. The first known, and most likely progenitor of the dynasty, was Ban Bori\u0107 who 1154\u201363 as a Hungarian vassal. Progenitor of the dynasty, Ban Bori\u0107 was first mentioned in 1154 and the last in 1163. He was also mentioned in Byzantine Greek historian John Kinnamos' history book covering years 1118\u20131176. The first certain mention was 1154 regarding the Byzantine- Hungarian war, with engagements in the Danube area, where he was described as taking part in the conflict on the side of Hungarian force, as Hungarian vassal and the ban of Bosnia. Kinnamos described Bori\u0107 as \"exarch (governor) of the land/country of Bosnia\". It is uncertain how and when Bori\u0107 came to rule Bosnia. According to Vladimir \u0106orovi\u0107, he was not a native Bosnian; his homeland is taken to have been central Slavonia. As Hungary became the overlord of Bosnia in the 1130s, it is most likely that Bori\u0107 was appointed governor in Bosnia as a Hungarian vassal, and was obliged to participate in the march on Brani\u010devo. Ban Bori\u0107 had two sons named Bori\u0107 and Pavao. Bori\u0107 Bori\u0107evi\u0107 and Pavao Bori\u0107evi\u0107 had sons named Odola, \u010celk and Bori\u0107. The extended family also included Detmar and Benedikt (also called Bori\u0107). In the 13th century his descendants had possessions on both sides of the river Sava, in the eastern and western parts of what is now the Po\u017eega County. ==See also== *List of rulers of Bosnia ==References== Category:12th century in Bosnia Category:Bosnian royal families Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina history stubs Category:Royalty stubs ",
