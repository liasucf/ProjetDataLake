Son de Rey's Latin Alternative sound blends traditional cumbia, and Latin beats with pop electronica. ==Biography== In 2014, the Austin Music Awards named Son de Rey #2 Best Performing Latin Band and #4 Best Performing World Music Band. In May, 2015, Son de Rey performed at Pachanga Latino Music Festival. ===Beginnings=== Son de Rey first began in 2008 when keyboardist David Moreno wanted to create a group of his own after working with various Tejano, and Latin artists including Shelly Lares, Bombasta, and Gary Hobbs. After years of switching out lead singers and playing numerous festivals including the Tejano Music Awards Fan Fair, the band was beginning to develop a following in the Central Texas area. In the spring of 2010 lead singer Luis Mikael Ram\u00edrez graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with degrees in Broadcast News and Spanish Language Teaching. After a failed audition for a job as a Royal Caribbean cruise ship singer, Luis began exploring the Austin Music Scene looking for bands to possibly join. Luis posted a Craigslist Ad saying that he was a musician and he was looking for a project in Austin. Then David Moreno contacted him and invited him to join the group as a backup singer. But when he was integrated into Son de Rey, several members withdrew and other entered, leaving him as the main voice, while Deborah Moreno, David Moreno and Marc Ruiz became their dream mates. Being four young Mexican- Americans, they understood that they were to explore their roots, and \"being in Texas, we knew we had to satisfy the anglo and Hispanic audience,\" says Luis. So they changed language and melody and began creating the signature sound Son de Rey carries today. ===Ojos Azules EP and album=== In August 2012, Son de Rey released Ojos Azules \u2013 EP produced by Grammy Winner Fabian Hernandez, noted for his work with Little Joe Y La Familia, Ruben Ramos & The Mexican Revolution, and Hamilton Loomis. The album reached the top 100 downloads in the iTunes Pop Latino Category and has consistently remained at the Top 10 in the ReverbNation Austin Latin Charts. They were soon invited to join the top Mexican Regional and Tejano artists in a music video filming of \u201cSomos Hermanos,\u201d as featured on Univsion\u2019s Primer Impacto in an effort to fight children\u2019s hunger. Todo Austin Magazine hailed the group as \u201cAustin\u2019s next wave of Latin Rockers.\u201d They began touring across Texas, with showcases in popular music festivals including Pachanga Latino Music Festival, Pecan Street Festival, Tejano Music Awards Fan Fair, Poteet Strawberry Festival, and El Camino Real Music Festival. During SXSW 2014 they took home 3 Austin Music Award Nominations including Best Latin Rock Act, Best Latin Traditional Act, and Best New Austin Act. Soon after, the group was ranked among the top 30 Latin Bands in Telemundo's 'Buscando Mi Ritmo' competition, which searched for the best latin groups in the US. Later that year they released the new single and video \u201cPray For A Lover\" Having shared the stage with some of the best in the music (A.B. Quintanilla and Los Kumbia All-Stars, Del Castillo, Ruben Ramos & The Mexican Revolution, Michael Salgado, and Dennis Quaid) Son de Rey continues to raise the bar for new wave Latin music with their dynamic performances, and unforgettable beats. During SXSW 2015 they were nominated once again for 2 Austin Music Awards including Best Latin Band and Best World Music Band. In May, 2015, Son de Rey released their first full length Album project Ojos Azules, also produced by Fabian Hernandez, with plans for a second statewide and national tour. ==Discography== ===Singles and EPs=== * Ojos Azules - EP (2012) * \"Pray for a Lover\" - Single (2014) ===Albums=== * Ojos Azules (2015) ==Members== * Luis Mikael Ram\u00edrez : Male Vocals. * Deborah Moreno : Female Vocals * David Moreno : Keyboard * Marc Ruiz : Drums * Eric Calistri : Guitar * David Moreno Sr. : Bass * Carlos De Leon : Percussion * Laura De Leon : Percussion ==References== ==External links== * Son de Rey Official website * Son de Rey on iTunes Category:Alternative rock groups from Texas ",
