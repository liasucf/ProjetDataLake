    "text": "A leader writer is a senior journalist in a British newspaper who is charged with writing the paper's editorial either in the absence of the editor or in cases where the editor chooses not to write editorials because their editorial skills may rest more in management of the company than in writing daily editorials. Some major newspapers have a number of leader writers. Often different individuals may write editorials in their own specialist areas, for example, the political editor would write some or all editorials on political matters, and so on. Leader writers are often also columnists in their newspapers. Outside the UK, leader writers are known as editorial writers. Some leader writers include: *Daniel Finkelstein *Amanda Platell *Jonathan Freedland *David Aaronovitch *Libby Purves *Matthew Parris *Simon Hoggart *Julia Hartley-Brewer *Patrick Hennessy *Quentin Letts *Simon Heffer *Peter Hitchens *Melanie Phillips *Oliver Kamm *Trevor Kavanagh *Michael White *Peter Oborne *Andrew Rawnsley *Annunziata Rees-Mogg *Peter Riddell *Michael Portillo *Kevin Maguire *Jackie Ashley *Simon Jenkins *Polly Toynbee *Tim Stanley *Michael Toner Category:Journalism lists Category:Lists of journalists ",
