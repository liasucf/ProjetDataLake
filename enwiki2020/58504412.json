    "text": "Eteonus or Eteonos () was a town of ancient Boeotia, mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad by Homer, who gives it the epithet of \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2. It lay to the right of the Asopus. Strabo says that it was afterwards called Scarphe (\u03a3\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c6\u03b7). It probably lay between Scolus and the frontier of the territory of Tanagra.Statius, Thebais, 7.266. Historically, another name for the town is Skaphaliai. A tradition, collected by Lysimachus of Alexandria said that, when Oedipus died, the inhabitants of Thebes and of another Boeotian village called Ceus did not want his remains buried in their territories and his body was transported to Eteonus, where he was buried, at night, in an enclosure dedicated to Demeter. When the inhabitants of Eteonus learned of the fact, they consulted the oracle about what they should do and the answer was that the worshiper of the goddess should not be disturbed, so the remains were buried there. His grave, afterwards, was shown at Eteonus. Its site has not been located. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Boeotia Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Locations in the Iliad Category:Lost ancient cities and towns ",
