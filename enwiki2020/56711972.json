The aircraft is supplied complete and ready-to-fly.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 236. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The design was introduced publicly at the Flying Show in Birmingham in December 2011, where writer Demitri Delemarle reported that it \"stole the show\", due to its unusual semi-enclosed cockpit design. ==Design and development== The PulsR was designed to comply with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale microlight category, including the category's maximum gross weight of with a ballistic parachute. The aircraft has a maximum gross weight of with a ballistic parachute and without. The design was first shown in 2011 and remained in prototype-only form until 2015. The aircraft design features a strut-braced topless hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats-in- tandem semi-enclosed cockpit with a cockpit fairing and windshield, tricycle landing gear with main gear wheel pants and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft fuselage is a monocoque design made from composite carbon fibre, with its double surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its span wing is supported by struts and uses an \"A\" frame weight-shift control bar, which is routed through the open side window spaces in the semi-enclosed fairing. The powerplant is a four-cylinder, air and liquid-cooled, four- stroke, dual-ignition Rotax 912ULS engine. The aircraft has an empty weight of and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of . With full fuel of the payload is . ==Operational history== Writer Demitri Delemarle reports that the design \"never fails to attract attention\" wherever it is shown, due to its unusual aerodynamic cockpit design, which makes it much faster and gives a better glide ratio than other trikes. ==Specifications (PulsR) == ==References== ==External links== * PulsR Category:2010s British sport aircraft Category:2010s British ultralight aircraft Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Ultralight trikes ",
