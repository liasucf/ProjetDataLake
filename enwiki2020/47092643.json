Therefore, it is considered the second novel of a series.Amazon.com website, at https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316211222 . ==Plot== This book has two plots. The primary plot concerns a serial killer who targets newlyweds on their honeymoons. FBI agent John O'Hara (who was central to the first book of this series) works this case, trying to determine who the killer is and why the killer targets particular newlyweds, but in a seemingly random manner. The second plot involves O'Hara personally, but he does not know this until another FBI agent, Sarah Brubaker, brings the matter to his attention. ==Reviews== The Book Reporter website has a very positive review of Second Honeymoon.
