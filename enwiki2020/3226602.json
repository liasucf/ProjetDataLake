    "text": "\"Better Man\" is a song by the American rock band Pearl Jam. It is the eleventh track on the band's third studio album, Vitalogy (1994). The song was written by vocalist Eddie Vedder. Despite the lack of a commercial single release, \"Better Man\" reached the top of the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and spent a total of eight weeks at number one. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003). ==Origin and recording== The song was written by vocalist Eddie Vedder when he was in high school. He said, \"I wrote 'Better Man' before I could drink\u2014legally\u2014on a four-track in my old apartment.\"Marks, Craig. \"Let's Get Lost\". Spin. December 1994. In another interview, Vedder stated, \"Sometimes I think of how far I've come from the teenager sitting on the bed in San Diego writing 'Better Man' and wondering if anyone would ever even hear it.\"Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\". Los Angeles Times. December 22, 1996. Its melody and chord progression are based loosely on the song \"Save It for Later\" by The English Beat, which the band sometimes jams to live after \"Better Man\". He first performed it with a San Diego, California\u2013based group called Bad Radio, with slightly faster tempo but altogether quite similar to the Vitalogy rendition. Vedder later recorded it with Pearl Jam, although Pearl Jam was initially reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility. Producer Brendan O'Brien said of the song: > There's a great song we recorded for Vs., \"Better Man,\" which ended up on > Vitalogy. One of the first rehearsals we did they played it and I said \"Man, > that song's a hit.\" Eddie just went \"uhhh\". I immediately knew I'd just said > the wrong thing. We cut it once for Vs., he wanted to give it away to this > Greenpeace benefit record, the idea was that the band was going to play and > some other singer was going to sing it. I remember saying to the engineer, > Nick [DiDia], \"This is one of their best songs and they're going to give it > away! Can't happen!\" And we went to record it and I'm not going to say we > didn't try very hard, but it didn't end up sounding very good. I may have > even sabotaged that version but I won't admit to that. It took us to the > next record, recording it two more times, before he became comfortable with > it because it was such a blatantly great pop song.Weisbard, Eric, et al. > \"Ten Past Ten\". Spin. August 2001. ==Lyrics== Al Weisel of Rolling Stone called the song a \"haunting ballad about a woman trapped in a bad relationship.\"Weisel, Al. Vitalogy review. Rolling Stone. December 15, 1994. Retrieved on March 1, 2008. When \"Better Man\" was performed on VH1 Storytellers in 2006, Vedder introduced it as a song about \"abusive relationships.\"Cohen, Jonathan. \"Pearl Jam Tells Its 'Story' At VH1 Taping\". Billboard. June 2, 2006. Before a performance of the song at Pearl Jam's show on April 3, 1994 in Atlanta at the Fox Theatre, Vedder clearly said \"it's dedicated to the bastard that married my Momma.\" He was referring to his stepfather, Peter Mueller, a California attorney whom Vedder had long believed to be his biological father and who divorced his mother in the early 1980s. ==Reception upon release== Although never released as a single, \"Better Man\" nonetheless became one of Pearl Jam's most-played songs on the radio in the U.S. \"Better Man\" became the most successful song from Vitalogy on the American rock charts. The song reached the top of Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, number two on their Modern Rock Tracks chart, and number 13 on their Top 40 Mainstream chart in 1995. The song spent a total of eight weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. It appeared on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 Airplay chart, reaching the top 20.

At the 13th annual Pop Music Awards of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, \"Better Man\" was cited as one of the most-performed ASCAP songs of 1995. Chris True of Allmusic proclaimed it as \"arguably the stand out track on 1994's Vitalogy\u2014and equally arguably\u2014[one of] the band's better songs in the whole of their career.\" He added, \"Vitalogy was, admittedly, the end of Pearl Jam's reign as top rock act and it's because of songs like \"Better Man\" that they were able to stay there without succumbing to all the traps of stardom and shameless marketing.\"True, Chris.
