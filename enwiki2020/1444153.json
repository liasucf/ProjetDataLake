    "text": "Fomins & Kleins was a Latvian rock group formed in 2002. Its members Ivo Fomins and Tomass Kleins were already accomplished and recognized rock musicians. Both are from the western Latvian port city of Liep\u0101ja. ==Previous collaborations== Both have worked together previously, in Soviet times forming the underground group \"Sald\u0101s sejas\" (Sweet Faces), which also featured well known Latvian musicians Zigfr\u012bds Muktup\u0101vels and Guntars Ra\u010ds \u2014 with whom a creative relationship continues to this day, since Ra\u010ds himself is the author of the lyrics to all of Fomins & Kleins' songs. ==Ivo Fomins== Singer Ivo Fomins, also educated as a chef, has taken part in many musical projects in Latvia, performing together with the band \"Liep\u0101jas Br\u0101\u013ci\" (Brothers of Liep\u0101ja) and as a solo artist. At the Jurmala Young Pop Singer Competition Ivo reached 3rd place in 1989 and received the viewer's choice award. Ivo's older brother Igo ((:lv:Igo)) is a popular Latvian singer and is well known throughout the Baltic countries and Russia due to his work with the maestro Raimonds Pauls, which led to the formation and massive popularity of the band Remix. ==Tomass Kleins== Tomass Kleins is the group's guitarist, as well as the author of all the group's music. In his time, he has formed many groups and has played in the famous group \"Nept\u016bns\" (Neptune), led by \"Zodiaks\" (Zodiac) producer and composer J\u0101nis L\u016bs\u0113ns. ==Eurovision== The group's debut album \"Muzikants\" (Musician) was released in 2003, and the album's title track became a huge hit after the duo successfully performed at the Latvian National Eurovision Competition and finished in second place. In 2004, they again found themselves singing the only Latvian-language song in the country's Eurovision pre-selection. This time they won, and the song \"Dziesma par laimi\" was selected as Latvia's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 in Istanbul. Due to the poor result of the previous year's Latvian entry, Fomins and Kleins had to take part in the novelty of a Eurovision semi-final, in which they failed to achieve the top-ten placing needed to advance to the grand final, finishing 17th in a field of 22. ==Membership== Together with Ivo Fomins and Tomass Kleins, the group is rounded out by bass guitarist Egils Me\u017es, drummer Valery Inutin and keyboardist J\u0101nis L\u016bs\u0113ns Jr., and drummers Nellija Bubujance and T\u0101lis G\u017eibovskis. == Discography == ===Albums=== *Muzikants (Musician) \u2013 2003 *Dzimis Latvij\u0101 (Born in Latvia) \u2013 2004 === Radio singles === *\"Sniegs\" (Snow) \u2013 2002 *\"Sol\u012bjums\" (Promise) \u2013 2003 *\"Muzikants\" (Musician) \u2013 2003 *\"Kur esi tu\" (Where are You) \u2013 2003 *\"T\u0101lu prom\" (Far Away) \u2013 2003 *\"Man vairs nav vienalga\" (Now I Care) \u2013 2004 *\"Aizejo\u0161\u0101s dienas\" (Departing Days) \u2013 2004 *\"Nekas\" (Nothing) \u2013 2004 *\"Dziesma par laimi\" (Song of Happiness) \u2013 2004 == Videos == *\"Sol\u012bjums\" (Promise) \u2013 2003 *\"T\u0101lu prom\" (Far Away) \u2013 2003 *\"Dziesma par laimi\" (Song of Happiness) \u2013 2004 == External links == *Fomins & Kleins homepage Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Latvia Category:Musicians from Liep\u0101ja Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 2004 Category:Latvian rock music groups Category:Latvian Romani people ",
