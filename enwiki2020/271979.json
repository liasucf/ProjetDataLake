His ancestry came from the region of Dinawar, in Kermanshah in modern-day western Iran. He was instructed in the two main traditions of the Abbasid-era grammarians of al-Ba\u1e63rah and of al- K\u016bfah. His principal teachers were Ibn al-Sikk\u012bt and his own father. He studied grammar, philology, geometry, arithmetic, and astronomy and was known to be a reliable traditionist. His most renowned contribution is Book of Plants, for which he is considered the founder of Arabic botany. Dinawari was said to have been of Persian origin. Although he was also said to have been Kurdish, or Arab of Persian ancestry.Encyclopedia of Islam, ed., Th. Houtsma, Brill Academic, 1993 p. 977 He may have studied astronomy in Isfahan.. ==Works== The tenth century biographical encyclopedia, \"al-Fihrist\" of Al- Nadim, lists sixteen book titles by Dinawari: ===Mathematics and natural sciences=== #Kit\u00e2b al-kusuf (\"Book of Solar Eclipses\") #Kit\u0101b an-nab\u0101t yufadiluh al-\u2018ulam\u0101' f\u012b ta\u2019l\u012bfih (), \u2018Plants, valued by scholars for its composition' #Kit\u0101b Al-Anw\u0101 () 'Tempest' (weather) #Kit\u0101b Al-qiblah wa'z-zaw\u0101l () \"Book of Astral Orientations\" #Kit\u0101b \u1e25is\u0101b ad-d\u016br (), \"Arithmetic/Calculation of Cycles\" #Kit\u0101b ar-rud \u2018al\u0101 ra\u1e63d al-I\u1e63bh\u0101n\u012b () Refutation of Lughdah al-I\u1e63bh\u0101n\u012b #Kit\u0101b al-ba\u1e25th f\u012b \u1e25us\u0101 al-Hind (), \"Analysis of Indian Arithmetic\" #Kit\u0101b al-jam\u2019 wa'l-tafr\u012bq (); \"Book of Arithmetic/Summation and Differentiation\" #Kit\u0101b al-jabr wa-l-muqabila (), \"Algebra and Equation\" #Kit\u0101b nuw\u0101dr al-jabr (), \"Rare Forms of Algebra\" ===Social sciences and humanities=== #Kit\u0101b al-akhb\u0101r al-\u1e6diw\u0101l (), \"General History\" # Kit\u0101b Kab\u012br () \"Great Book\" [in history of sciences] #Kit\u0101b al- fa\u1e63\u0101ha (), \"Book of Rhetoric\" #Kit\u0101b al-buld\u0101n (), \"Book of Cities (Regions) (Geography)\" #Kit\u0101b ash-sh\u2019ir wa-shu\u2019ar\u0101\u2019 (), \"Poetry and the Poets\" #Kit\u0101b al-Wa\u1e63\u0101y\u0101 (), Commandments (wills); #Kit\u0101b ma yulahan f\u012bh al\u2019\u0101mma (), How the Populace Errs in Speaking; #Isl\u00e2h al-mantiq (\"Improvement of Speech\") #Ans\u00e2b al-Akr\u00e2d (\"Ancestry of the Kurds\"). ==Editions & Translations== His General History (Al-Akhbar al-Tiwal) has been edited and published numerous times (Vladimir Guirgass, 1888; Muhammad Sa'id Rafi'i, 1911; Ignace Krachkovsky, 1912; 'Abd al-Munim 'Amir & Jamal al-din Shayyal, 1960; Isam Muhammad al-Hajj 'Ali, 2001), but has not been translated in its entirety into a European language. Jackson Bonner has recently prepared an English translation of the pre-Islamic passages of al-Akhbar al-Tiwal. ==Book of Plants== Al-Dinawari is considered the founder of Arabic botany for his Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants), which consisted of six volumes. Only the third and fifth volumes have survived, though the sixth volume has partly been reconstructed based on citations from later works. In the surviving portions of his works, 637 plants are described from the letters sin to ya. He describes the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit., in The first part of the Book of Plants describes astronomical and meteorological concepts as they relate to plants, including the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, anwa, and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, and floods. The book also describes different types of ground, indicating which types are more convenient for plants and the qualities and properties of good ground. Al-Dinawari quoted from other early Muslim botanical works that are now lost, such as those of al-Shaybani, Ibn al-Arabi, al-Bahili, and Ibn as-Sikkit. ==See also== * List of Persian scientists and scholars * Muslim Agricultural Revolution * Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * Dinawari at Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica * The Book of plants of Abu Hanifa ad-Dinawari * Translation of the Pre-Islamic Portion of al- Akhbar al-Tiwal by Jackson Bonner Category:815 births Category:896 deaths Category:9th-century Iranian people Category:9th-century astronomers Category:9th-century geographers Category:9th-century historians Category:9th- century mathematicians Category:9th-century philologists Category:9th-century Arabic writers Category:9th-century biologists Category:9th-century botanists Category:9th-century linguists Category:9th-century scholars Category:9th- century scientists Category:9th-century writers Category:9th-century zoologists Category:Poets of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Scholars of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Iranian Arabists Category:Astronomers of medieval Islam Category:Botanists of medieval Islam Category:Geographers of medieval Islam Category:Grammarians of Arabic Category:Grammarians of Kufa Category:Kurdish scholars Category:Kurdish scientists Category:Linguists from Iran Category:Mathematicians of medieval Islam Category:Medieval grammarians of Arabic Category:Medieval Kurdish philosophers Category:Medieval Persian philosophers Category:Medieval Persian astronomers Category:Medieval Persian geographers Category:Medieval Persian mathematicians Category:People from Dinawar Category:Persian Muslim historians of Islam Category:Pre-Linnaean botanists Category:Iranian grammarians ",
