    "text": "The 1959\u201360 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team represented the University of Idaho during the 1959\u201360 NCAA University Division basketball season. The independent Vandals were led by first-year head coach Dave Strack and played their home games on campus at Memorial Gymnasium in Moscow, Idaho. In the four years between the demise of the Pacific Coast Conference (1959) and the founding of the Big Sky Conference (1963), Idaho was an independent; this season the Vandals had an record. After just one season in Moscow, Strack resigned in May to return to Michigan, his alma mater; he was succeeded by Joe Cipriano, a former player (and assistant coach) at Washington in Seattle. ==References== ==External links== *Sports Reference \u2013 Idaho Vandals: 1959\u201360 basketball season *Gem of the Mountains: 1960 University of Idaho yearbook \u2013 1959\u201360 basketball season *Idaho Argonaut \u2013 student newspaper \u2013 1960 editions Category:Idaho Vandals men's basketball seasons Idaho Idaho ",
