In 1800, an Ode sur les vertus civiles opened her the doors of the Society of Literature and of the salons of Paris. Fanny de Beauharnais, the First consul aunt, gave the signal for applause by sending these verses, with her poem l\u2019Ile de la F\u00e9licit\u00e9: Later were published Odes sur la mort de Dolomieu, an ode to Denis Lebrun, la Vertu est la base des r\u00e9publiques, and her M\u00e9moire sur Klopstock, sa vie et ses ouvrages, which earned her entrance in the \"Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e des arts\" of Paris. However, Fortun\u00e9e Briquet's most important work is undoubtedly her famous Dictionnaire historique, litt\u00e9raire et bibliographique des Fran\u00e7aises et des \u00e9trang\u00e8res naturalis\u00e9es en France (Paris, Gill\u00e9, 1804, in-8\u00b0). She still produced a few pieces in 1807, but soon stopped writing. Domestic troubles poisoned her last days, her health faltered and she died. The historian was her son. == References== == Bibliography == * Henri Beauchet-Filleau, Charles de Cherg\u00e9, Paul Beauchet-Filleau, Dictionnaire historique et g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique des familles du Poitou, Paris, Hachette, 1876, (p. 785). *Nicole Pellegrin, \u00ab Fortun\u00e9e Briquet \u00bb == External links == * Fortun\u00e9e Briquet on po\u00e9tesses d'expression fran\u00e7aise * Fortun\u00e9e Briquet on Data.bnf.fr Category:French bibliographers Category:19th-century French poets Category:1782 births Category:People from Niort Category:1815 deaths Category:19th-century French women writers Category:19th-century women writers ",
