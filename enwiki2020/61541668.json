    "text": "The sixteenth season of The Bachelorette features Clare Crawley, a 39-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, California. The season was originally set to premiere on May 18, 2020, but has been postponed to October 13, 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The season is also set to air on Tuesday nights instead of its regular Monday timeslot. Crawley was the runner-up on the 18th season of The Bachelor featuring Juan Pablo Galavis. She also made appearances on seasons one and two of Bachelor in Paradise, and on Bachelor Winter Games. At 39, Crawley is the oldest Bachelorette in the show's history, taking over from Rachel Lindsay who was 32 on her season. ==Filming and development== ===Production=== Clare Crawley was named as the Bachelorette on Good Morning America on March 2, 2020. Other women considered for the role included season 22\u2019s Tia Booth and Kendall Long, season 23\u2019s Tayshia Adams and Katie Morton, previous Bachelorette Hannah Brown, and season 24's Kelsey Weier. For the first time since the second season of The Bachelorette, the dates and travel would take place entirely within the United States due to concerns over the coronavirus. Filming was due to begin on March 13, 2020, but with the aforementioned pandemic growing rapidly, the season was forced to suspend production and filming was postponed to a later date. Additionally, the season was planned to be filmed partially in Italy, but this was pulled by the production crew due to a worsening outbreak there. On June 17, 2020, it was announced that the season is scheduled to premiere in fall 2020. The following day, it was announced that production was set to begin in July, with the show becoming the first non-scripted American television program to begin production since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, for the first time since season eight, this season would not be filming at Bachelor mansion, but at an isolated resort. During filming in August 2020, host Chris Harrison had to go into a two-week quarantine after taking time to help his son move in to his dorm at Texas Christian University. Season twelve Bachelorette JoJo Fletcher temporarily took over hosting duties during that period. ==Contestants== 32 potential contestants were revealed on March 11, 2020. Host Chris Harrison later revealed that they would likely be recasting the season due to the filming delay. One of the intended 32 contestants, Matt James was instead recast as the lead for season 25 of The Bachelor \u2013 becoming the first African-American to lead The Bachelor and the second African-American lead of the Bachelor franchise following Rachel Lindsay of the 13th season of The Bachelorette. An updated cast list containing 42 potential contestants was released on July 15, 2020. The season began with 31 contestants. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; |- !Name !Age !Hometown !Occupation !Outcome !Place !Ref |- | Ben Smith | 29 | Noblesville, Indiana | Army Ranger | |colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"22\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:lightblue;\"|Participating |- | Bennett Jordan | 36 | Atlanta, Georgia | Wealth Management Consultant | |- | Blake Monar | 31 | Phoenix, Arizona | Male Grooming Specialist | |- | Blake Moynes | 29 | Hamilton, Ontario | Wildlife Manager | |- | Brendan Morais | 30 | Milford, Massachusetts | Commercial Roofer | |- | Chasen Nick | 31 | Walnut Creek, California | IT Account Executive | |- | Dale Moss | 31 | Brandon, South Dakota | Former Pro Football Wide Receiver | |- | Demar Jackson | 26 | Scottsdale, Arizona | Spin Cycling Instructor | |- | Ed Waisbrot | 36 | Miami, Florida | Health Care Salesman | |- | Garin Flowers | 34 | Fort Lauderdale, Florida | Professor of Journalism | |- | Ivan Hall | 28 | Dallas, Texas | Aeronautical Engineer | |- | Jason Foster | 31 | Rutland, Vermont | Former Pro Footballer Lineman | |- | Jay Smith | 29 | Langhorne, Pennsylvania | Fitness Director | |- | Joe Park | 36 | North Woodmere, New York | Anesthesiologist | |- | Jordan Chapman | 26 | Southington, Connecticut | Software Account Executive | |- | Kenny Braasch | 39 | Oak Lawn, Illinois | Boy Band Manager | |- | Riley Christian | 30 | Long Island City, New York | Attorney | |- | Tyler Smith | 36 | Georgetown, Texas | Music Manager | |- | Uzoma \"Eazy\" Nwachukwu | 29 | Allen, Texas | Sports Marketing Agent | |- | Yosef Aborady | 30 | Daphne, Alabama | Medical Device Salesman | |- | Zac Clark | 36 | Haddonfield, New Jersey | Addiction Specialist | |- | Zach Jackson | 37 | St. George, Utah | Cleaning Service Owner | |- | Brandon Gross | 28 | Cleveland, Ohio | Real Estate Agent | Week 2 | 23 | |- | AJ Jalawan | 28 | Irvine, California | Software Salesman |rowspan=\"9\"|Week 1 |rowspan =9 |24\u201331 |rowspan=\"9\"| |- | Chris Conran | 27 | Salt Lake City, Utah | Landscape Design Salesman |- | Jeremy Higgins | 40 | Virginia Beach, Virginia | Banker |- | Jordan Manier | 30 | Dearborn, Michigan | Cyber Security Engineer |- | Mike Tobin | 38 | Calgary, Alberta | Digital Media Adviser |- | Page Pressley | 37 | Santa Fe, New Mexico | Chef |- | Robby Stahl | 31 | St. Pete Beach, Florida | Insurance Broker |- | Tyler Cottrill | 27 | Gassaway, West Virginia | Lawyer |- |} ==Call-out order== {|class=\"wikitable nowrap\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=2|Order||rowspan=\"2\"|Bachelors|| colspan=\"10\" |Episode / Week |- !1 !2/3 |- !1 | Ben | bgcolor=\"skyblue\"| Dale | bgcolor=\"gold\"| Riley |- !2 | Riley | Blake (ON) | bgcolor=\"gold\"| Jason |- !3 | Zac C. | Eazy | bgcolor=\"gold\"| Chasen |- !4 | Jordan M. | Ben | bgcolor=\"orange\"| Blake (ON) |- !5 | Jason | Riley | |- !6 | Ivan | Zach J. | |- !7 | Kenny | Tyler S. | |- !8 | Brendan | Joe | |- !9 | Mike | Jason | |- !10 | Jeremy | Demar | |- !11 | Blake (AZ) | Chasen | |- !12 | Tyler C. | Jordan C. | |- !13 | Bennett | Blake (AZ) | |- !14 | Blake (ON) | Kenny | |- !15 | Chris | Brendan | |- !16 | AJ | Garin | |- !17 | Joe | Ed | |- !18 | Garin | Bennett | |- !19 | Robby | Zac C. | |- !20 | Eazy | Jay | |- !21 | Jay | Brandon | |- !22 | Chasen | Ivan | |- !23 | Demar | Yosef | bgcolor=\"hotpink\"| Brandon |- !24 | Ed | bgcolor=\"tomato\" rowspan=\"8\" | AJ Chris Jeremy Jordan M.
