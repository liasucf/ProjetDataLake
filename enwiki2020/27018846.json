The Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health is in the background The Clark County Government Center serves as the government center building for Clark County, Nevada. It is located in Downtown Las Vegas. The complex designed by Fentress Bradburn and opened in 1995 consists of a six-story county administration building, three one-story buildings for the county commissioners\u2019 chambers, a multipurpose community facility and a central plant. It includes space for government administration, a law enforcement complex, a performing arts complex, a child-care facility and structured parking. It also contains a single-story auditorium, a pyramid- shaped cafeteria and a cylindrical, six-story reception hall, as well as office buildings. Designed by Fentress Architects, the complex design physically embodies Clark County\u2019s philosophy of providing open, accessible government in a new civic cultural center. The government center is organized around a multifunctional County courtyard and shaded pedestrian spine. The shaded, circular arcade completes the circular form of the buildings. Aligned radially with the columns are three rows of trees framing a sloped lawn amphitheater. A centered raised platform creates the stage. The amphitheater, an acre and a half in area and in diameter, is capable of accommodating almost any type of major public gathering, theater, or ceremony. It has received awards including \u201cBest Non-Hotel Architecture\u201d and the \u201cPeople\u2019s Choice Las Vegas Journal\u201d award in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. ==Notes== Category:Buildings and structures in Las Vegas Category:County government buildings in Nevada Category:Clark County, Nevada Category:Downtown Las Vegas Category:Government buildings completed in 1995 Category:Pyramids in the United States Category:1990s architecture in the United States ",
