    "text": "William Martin (born February 16, 1957 in Bethesda, Maryland) is an American botanist and microbiologist, currently Head of the Institut f\u00fcr Molekulare Evolution, Heinrich Heine Universit\u00e4t, D\u00fcsseldorf. Born in Bethesda, Maryland, Martin was educated at Richland College, Dallas, Texas, and Texas A&M; University. After working as a carpenter in Dallas, Martin moved to Hannover, Germany, and obtained his university Diploma from Technische Universit\u00e4t Hannover in 1985. Martin's PhD is from Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Z\u00fcchtungsforschung, Cologne, where he did postdoctoral research, followed by further postdoctoral work at Institut f\u00fcr Genetik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, where he obtained his Habilitation in 1992. In 1999, Martin became full (C4) professor at Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf. Martin is a distinguished and sometimes controversial contributor to the field of molecular evolution. He is known particularly for his work on the evolution of the Calvin cycle and plastids including chloroplasts, and, more generally, for contributions to understanding the origin and evolution of eukaryotic cells. Martin is co-author, with Miklos Mueller of Rockefeller University, of the 1998 paper The Hydrogen hypothesis for the first eukaryote. A wealth of subsequent research papers include contributions, independently and with Michael J. Russell of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to understanding the geochemical origins of cells and their biochemical pathways. Martin's work is well cited (nearly 30,000 times) and he has an h-index of 84. == Awards == * 1990: Heinz Maier-Leibnitz-Preis of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft * 1997: Technology Transfer Prize, Industrie und Handelskammer Braunschweig * 1998: Miescher-Ishida Prize of the International Society of Endocytobiology *2017: Spiridion Brusina Medal of the Croatian Society of Natural Sciences. * 2018: Preis der Kl\u00fch Stiftung == Honours == * 2000-2007 Foreign Associate, CIAR Programme in Evolutionary Biology * 2001- Faculty 1000 Member for Plant Genomes and Evolution * 2006- Elected Fellow, American Academy for Microbiology * 2006-2009 Julius von Haast Fellow of the New Zealand Ministry for Research, Science and Technology * 2008 Elected Member of the Nordrhein- Westf\u00e4lische Akademie der Wissenschaften == Selected publications == * * * * * * Madeline C.
