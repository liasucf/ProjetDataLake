The Werkst\u00e4tte brought together architects, artists and designers working in ceramics, fashion, silver, furniture and the graphic arts. It is regarded as a pioneer of modern design, and its influence can be seen in later styles such as Bauhaus and Art Deco.Pevsner, Nikolaus (2005). Pioneers of Modern Design: From William Morris to Walter Gropius. 4th ed. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 164. . Following World War I, the workshop was beset by financial troubles and material shortages. Attempts to expand the workshop's base were unsuccessful, and ultimately it was forced to close in 1932. ==Origins== The enterprise evolved from the Vienna Secession, founded in 1897 as a progressive alliance of artists and designers. From the start, the Secession had placed special emphasis on the applied arts, and its 1900 exhibition surveying the work of contemporary European design workshops prompted the young architect Josef Hoffmann and his artist friend Koloman Moser to consider establishing a similar enterprise. Finally in 1903, with backing from the industrialist Fritz W\u00e4rndorfer, the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte began operations in three small rooms; it soon expanded to fill a three-story building with separate, specially designed facilities for metalwork, leatherwork, bookbinding, woodworking and a paint shop. The range of product lines also included; leather goods, enamel, jewellery, postcards and ceramics. The Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte even had a millinery department. ==Style== Beginning with the 14th Exhibition of the Vienna Sezession in 1902, the radical distinctiveness of certain Viennese artists began to emerge, setting a foundation for the widespread Modernist movement; this became known as Wiener-Werkst\u00e4tte-Stil (literally, the Vienna Workshops Style). Among the innovators were the Austrian designers Gisela Falke von Lilienstein and Else Unger, and the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann. The latter's cubist sculpture created in 1902 marked a break into independence for many Viennese artists. His works from this period are especially remarkable when one considers that the term \"cubism\" only found its way into the art lexicon around 1907 to describe the work of Pablo Picasso. ==Production== Most of the objects produced in the Wiener Werkstatte were stamped with a number of different marks: the trademark of the Wiener Werkstatte, the monogram of the designer and that of the craftsman, who created it. The Wiener Werkstatte had about 100 employees in 1905, of whom 37 were masters of their trade. The seat of the venture was in Neustiftgasse 32\u201334, where a new building was adapted to their requirements. Eventually the project exhausted W\u00e4rndorfer's fortune. The circle of customers of the Wiener Werkstatte and Josef Hoffmann mainly consisted of artists and Jewish upper middle class supporters of the Austro- Hungarian Empire. Several branches of the workshop were opened in Karlsbad 1909, Marienbad, Z\u00fcrich 1916/17, New York 1922, Berlin 1929. In architectural commissions such as the Sanatorium Purkersdorf and the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte was able to realize its ideal of the Gesamtkunstwerk (total artwork), a coordinated environment in which everything down to the last detail was consciously designed as an integral part of the whole project. For several years, beginning in 1904, the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte had its own carpentry workshop. Josef Hoffmann designed a furniture line noted for its simple forms for the firm of Jacob & Josef Kohn. But only few pieces of furniture were made there. Most of the furniture known as Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte Furniture were made by cabinet-makers as: Portois & Fix, Johann Soulek, Anton Herrgesell, Anton Pospisil, Friedrich Otto Schmidt and Johann Niedermoser. Some historians now believe that there are no existing original products of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte Furniture division. From 1905, the Wiener Werkstatte produced handpainted and printed silks. The Backhausen firm was responsible for the machine-printed and woven textiles. In 1907, the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte took over distribution for the Wiener Keramik, a ceramics workshop headed by Michael Powolny and Berthold L\u00f6ffler. And in the same year Moser, embittered by the financial squabbling, left the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, which subsequently entered a new phase, both stylistically and economically. ==Expansion== Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte Museum at the textile company Backhausen in Vienna (2009) Palais Stoclet in Brussels, a Gesamtkunstwerk example of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte The founding of textile and fashion divisions in 1909 and 1910 brought a further shift in the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte's emphasis\u2014away from the architectural and toward the ephemeral. After a close brush with bankruptcy in 1913, W\u00e4rndorfer left to America and the following year Otto Primavesi, a banker from Moravia, took over as chief financier and patron. During and immediately following the First World War the Wiener Werkstatte was influenced by a new generation of artists and craftsmen, especially Dagobert Peche, who became creative director in 1915, and the director of the Z\u00fcrich branch in 1917. Peche's playfully theatrical aesthetic reimagined decorative motifs of the Baroque and Rococo in a modern way.\"Dagobert Peche\".

After the war, material shortages encouraged experimentation with less durable, less expensive materials such as wood, ceramics and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. One of the ceramics contributors was Walter Bosse.Schreyer-Hartmann, Cherica, and Hans- Hagen and Johanna Hottenroth. Walter Bosse Leben Kunstund Handwerk 1904\u20131979. Vienna: Verlag Christian Brandst\u00e4tter, 2000. The original, grand Gesamtkunstwerk vision became diluted and submerged by the Kunstgewerbliches\u2014the artsy-craftsy. At the beginning of the 1920s, Philipp Hausler attempted to eliminate the \"bad habits\" and \"extravagances\" which devoured so much money by broadening the workshop's base. The WW artists, however, insisted upon their accustomed exclusivity, and Hausler left in 1925.\"Vienna Museum of Applied Arts Attempts to expand the workshop's scope\u2014adding such items as wallpaper to its limited program of industrial licenses, and establishing branches in Berlin, New York and Zurich\u2014were not particularly successful. The Werkst\u00e4tte's financial situation grew desperate due to the effects of the war and the onset of the worldwide Depression in 1929. In the 1932 it was compelled to declare bankruptcy and closed. ==Legacy== With its avant-garde, artistic, yet timeless designs, the Wiener- Werkstaette-Stil influenced generations of architects and designers in the 20th century. The Bauhaus in Germany, Art Deco in America from 1920 to 1940, Scandinavian design from 1940-1960 (see for example Arne Jacobsen), as well as Italian design (see Mario Bellini) between 1960 and 1980, were all strongly influenced by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte. A work representative is the Stoclet Palace in Brussels, which is considered a Gesamtkunstwerk of the company. The chocolate company Altmann & K\u00fchne uses many of the designs of the company for its chocolate boxes, as does Demel. == Literature == * \u00dcner, Stefan: Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, in: Wagner, Hoffmann, Loos und das M\u00f6beldesign der Wiener Moderne.
