William Rust, bought a grand house on Rocky Point Road at Sans Souci from Thomas Holt (1811\u201388), which he turned into a luxurious hotel.http://www.rockdale.nsw.gov.au/pages/rockdale_sub_sanssouci.aspx Later, he moved to Strippers Point renamed it Sandringham and built the Prince of Wales Hotel. As an ardent royalist, it is thought he chose the name to honour Edward VII, the Prince of Wales who in 1872 was also building a royal residence at Sandringham, in Norfolk, England. The area between Cooks River and Georges River was originally known as Seven Mile Beach. It was changed to Lady Robinson\u2019s Beach in 1874 to honour the wife of Governor Sir Hercules Robinson.
