    "text": "Hippopotamus gorgops is an extinct species of hippopotamus. It first appeared in Africa during the late Pliocene, and eventually migrated into Europe during the early Pleistocene (where its fossils were first discovered). It became extinct during the Middle Pleistocene. Fossil records found at Ubeidiya, Israel suggested that they migrated out of Africa around 1.6 million years ago. Some have speculated that H. gorgops and H. behemoth are actually the same species given their similar sizes and where they have been found ==Taxonomy== Model Skull With an estimated length of , a shoulder height of , and a weight of 3900-4500 kg (8600-9900 lb), H. gorgops was larger than its living relative, H. amphibius. Another feature setting it apart from H. amphibius was the placement of its eyes. Modern hippos have eyes placed high on the skull, but H. gorgops had eyestalk-like orbits extruding above its skull, making it even easier for the creature to see its surroundings while (almost) fully under water. This species was described by German scientist Wilhelm Otto Dietrich in 1928.Dietrich, W. O. (1928). Pleistoc\u00e4ne Deutsch\u2013Ostafrikanische Hippopotamus\u2013reste.
