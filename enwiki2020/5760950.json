Portrait from the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum, 1553 Ahijah the Shilonite ( \"Yah is My Brother\"See Gesenius, who interprets the name as \"friend of Jehovah,\" taking the literal expression 'brother' as metaphorical for friendship. ), was a Levite prophet of Shiloh in the days of Solomon, as mentioned in the Hebrew Bible's First Books of Kings. Ahijah foretold to Jeroboam that he would become king ().\"Ahijah\", Jewish Encyclopedia The Hebrew Bible records two of his prophecies. In , he announced the separation of the Northern ten tribes from Solomon's United Kingdom of Israel, forming the Northern Kingdom. In , Ahijah's prophecy, delivered to the wife of Jeroboam, foretold the death of the king's son, the destruction of the House of Jeroboam, and the fall and captivity of Israel \"beyond the River\", a stock expression for the land east of the Euphrates.Holman Bible Dictionary, \"Beyond the River\" According to the Second Book of Chronicles, Ahijah also authored a book, described as the \"Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite,\" which contained information about Solomon's reign. This text, however, has not survived and is one of the non- canonical books referenced in the Bible. In it is referred to as the Acts of Solomon. Rabbinic tradition credits Ahijah with having lived a very long life, linking his life-span with that of antediluvian patriarchs such as Methuselah and Adam.Babylonian Talmud, Bava Batra 121b ==References== Category:Hebrew Bible people Category:Solomon Category:Books of Kings Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown Category:10th-century BCE Hebrew people ",
