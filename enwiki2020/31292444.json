    "text": "The Guerrilla war in the Baltic states or the Forest Brothers resistance movement was the armed struggle against Soviet rule that spanned from 1940 to the mid-1950s. After the occupation of the Baltic territories by the Soviets in 1944, an insurgency started. According to some estimates, 10,000 partisans in Estonia, 10,000 partisans in Latvia and 30,000 partisans in Lithuania and many more supporters were involved. This war continued as an organised struggle until 1956 when the superiority of the Soviet military caused the native population to adopt other forms of resistance. The guerrilla movement in the post-war Baltic states was of a size proportionately similar to that of the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. ==See also== *Forest Brothers *Operation Priboi *Occupation of the Baltic states ==References== * *Clodfelter, M.
