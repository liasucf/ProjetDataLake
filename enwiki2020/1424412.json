It is the flagship product of South African Breweries and has recently been recognised as the National Beer of South Africa, based on the fact that it is 100% grown and produced in the country, and for its ability to unite the community behind a common cause. == History == Castle Lager\u2019s origins can be traced to the Johannesburg gold rush of 1886. Charles Glass, founder of the Castle Brewery, began selling beer to the miners after noticing a gap in the market. The new beer soon became popular amongst the prospectors of the gold rush, and in 1889 one of Johannesburg's early newspapers, The Digger's News, declared it \"a phenomenal success.\" In 1895, on the success of Castle Lager, South African Breweries (SAB) was founded, with its head office being the Castle Brewery. Two years later, SAB became the first industrial company to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Today, Castle Lager is brewed in nine countries and is available in over 40 countries worldwide. In 2000 Castle Lager was awarded in the \"World's Best Bottled Lager\" category at the Brewing Industry International Awards. In 2002, South African Breweries bought Miller, forming SABMiller. In 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller. ==Sponsorships== Castle Lager sponsorships include: *Premier Sponsor of the South African Football Team (Bafana Bafana). *Team Sponsor of the South African Cricket Team (Castle Lager Proteas). *Associate Sponsor of the South African Rugby Team (Springboks). *Official beer supplier to the HSBC Sevens World Series Leg: Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa. *Official beer supplier to the Vodacom Super Rugby Tournament. *Official beer supplier to the Premier Soccer League (PSL). ==Related products== Castle Milk Stout *Castle Lite - introduced in 1994, Castle Lite is a reduced alcohol and lower calorie variant of Castle Lager.
