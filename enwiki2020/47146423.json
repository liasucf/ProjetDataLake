It runs shows independently, in conjunction with local festivals, as well as with other organizations and wrestling promotions. ==History== Riot City Wrestling was founded in Adelaide in January 2006. In 2010, RCW appeared at the Adelaide Fringe, hosting the STRENGTH Cup tournament, and was voted one of the festival's top five attractions by the Adelaide Advertiser. They returned to the festival in 2011, hosting the tournament again. For the 2014 festival, the company promoted a lucha libre-themed show. On 1 July 2012, the Goodwood Saints Football Club of the South Australian Amateur Football League hosted RCW for a special fundraiser. RCW wrestlers the Basso Boys, who competed at the event, had previously played C Grade Australian Rules Football. As of August 2014, Jeff Jarrett's American-based Global Force Wrestling announced working agreements with Riot City Wrestling. That month, during a WWE tour of Australia, several RCW wrestlers were also invited to participate in a WWE training camp. Wrestling reviewer Rod Lewis has noted the promotion for its \"high octane acrobatics\" as well as \"the comical theatrics and surprising plot twists\". RCW has built an alliance with Melbourne City Wrestling, which has featured a rivalry between wrestlers from the two promotions. RCW runs a training academy, which is located in Hindmarsh. Wrestlers who have competed for RCW include former NXT tag team champion Buddy Murphy, Voodoo, who competes for Grand Pro Wrestling, and Rhea Ripley. ==Championships== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Championship !Current champion(s) !Date won !Previous champion !Reference |- |RCW Championship |Rocky Menero |24 May 2019 |Zak Sabbath | |- |RCW Women\u2019s Championship |Izzy Shaw |10 October 2020 |Vacant | |- |RCW Tag Team Championship |The Parea (Eli Theseus and Gabriel Aeros) |19 September 2020 |World Class Egos (Chris Basso and Matt Hayter) | |} ===RCW Championship=== ====Names==== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Name !Years |- |RCW Heavyweight Championship |April 30, 2006 - December 13, 2019 |- |RCW Championship |December 13, 2019 - Present |} ====Reigns==== ====Combined reigns==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|\u2020 |Indicates the current champion |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !Rank !Wrestler !No. of reigns !Combined days |- !
