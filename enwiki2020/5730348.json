The settlement grew quickly and was granted town status in 1969. From October 2005 until December 2006, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was jailed in Krasnokamensk on his conviction for tax evasion and fraud.Where is Khodorkovsky? - Report from the Westdeutschen Rundfunk (German) ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Krasnokamensk serves as the administrative center of Krasnokamensky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Registry of the Administrative-Territorial Units and the Inhabited Localities of Zabaykalsky Krai As a municipal division, the town of Krasnokamensk, together with one rural locality (the settlement of Oktyabrsky), is incorporated within Krasnokamensky Municipal District as Krasnokamensk Urban Settlement.Law #317-ZZK ==Economy== The town is best known for its uranium mine - Priargunsky mine - the largest in Russia.

About 500-1000 homes or more suffer from radiation exposures far above international standards.http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org Blacksmith Institute Website In recent years, the dangerously high levels of radioactivity led to evacuation and resettlement of residents living near the tailing dumps. ==Sister city== * Manzhouli, China ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * Category:Cities and towns in Zabaykalsky Krai Category:Cities and towns built in the Soviet Union Category:1968 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:Populated places established in 1968 ",
