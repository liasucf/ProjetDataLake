    "text": "Los \u00fanicos () is a 2011 Argentine superhero live-action television series aired by El Trece in the prime time. The \"uniques\" are a superhero team working as a covert operation unit. Main actors are Arnaldo Andr\u00e9, Mariano Mart\u00ednez and Griselda Siciliani, the two main supervillains are played by Favio Posca and Carlos Belloso. ==Premise== Unlike most productions by Pol-ka, Los \u00fanicos is not a telenovela featuring common people or a vengeance plot. Instead, it is a crime fiction comedy with metafictional elements. As such, it avoids the usual constrains of the plots of the aforementioned genres. The plot is influenced by the X-Men film series, Heroes and Sky High. Nicol\u00e1s Cabr\u00e9 makes a spin-off of the Sin C\u00f3digo telenovela, playing again his former character of \"Axel Etcheverry\". In the new plot, the \"Nielsen Security\" group has gone bankrupt, and Axel blames his former teammate Gabriel Nielsen for it. Nielsen (which was played by Adri\u00e1n Suar, creator of both series) has appeared a number of times, as well as other characters and references to the former telenovela. Arnaldo Andr\u00e9 composed his character, an experimented leader managing a team, based over his own protective relations with relatives, and the ways TV producers try to motivate him to accept a work. He made a deliberate effort to avoid giving an authoritarian style to the character, to avoid comparisons with his former character at Valientes. ==Production== The series has had cameos from notable Argentine actors, such as Esteban Prol, Eugenia Su\u00e1rez, Carlos Baute and Anabela Ascar. Gonzalo Heredia, from the previous successful telenovela Malparida, played himself in a casual scene, with a brief cameo of Juana Viale, also from that telenovela. Osvaldo Laport will play again his former character of \"Amador Heredia\" from Soy Gitano. Miguel \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez and Mart\u00edn Bossi will play crime bosses, and Ana Mar\u00eda Orozco will join the team. A fashion show will include the presence of P\u00eda Slapka, acting as herself, and fashion designer Roberto Giordano. The series had a successful rating, with nearly 20 points. ==Plot== The \"Uniques\" are actually one of several covert operation units of skilled or superpowered people working at different countries. Alfredo Monterrey organized many of those units, and the series is about the creation and organization of the Argentine branch. His recruits are Diego Rouvier, Axel Etcheverry, Mar\u00eda Soledad Marini, Rub\u00e9n Hagi, Rosario Ahumada, Violeta Morano and Hugo Albarrac\u00edn. Mar\u00eda has superhuman strength, Axel has an unbreakable skeleton, Rub\u00e9n Hagi has indestructible skin, and Violeta Morano is precognitive. Diego and Rosario have no superhuman powers: Diego is a skilled secret agent, and Rosario a former burglar with a taste for high-stake thefts. The team is opposed by the villains Livio Muzak and Ronco Milevich. Ronco is capable of electric manipulation. ==Cast== * Mariano Mart\u00ednez as Diego Rouvier (season 1) * Nicol\u00e1s Cabr\u00e9 as Axel Etcheverry * Griselda Siciliani as Mar\u00eda Soledad Marini (season 1) * Nicol\u00e1s V\u00e1zquez as Ruben Hagi * Eugenia Tobal as Rosario Ahumada (season 1) * Brenda Asnicar as Keira Beltr\u00e1n * Marcelo Mazzarello as Adolfo Fortuna * Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Monje as Hugo Albarrac\u00edn (season 1) * Mar\u00eda Eugenia Su\u00e1rez as Sof\u00eda Reyes * Jimena Bar\u00f3n as Mar\u00eda Paula Said (season 1) * Claudia Font\u00e1n as Soraya Bismarck * Arnaldo Andr\u00e9 as Alfredo Monterrey (season 1) * Rodrigo Noya as Bruno Epstein * Juan Manuel Guilera as Lucas Miller * Victorio D'Alessandro as Ciro Fuentes * Julieta Zylberberg as Helena Epstein (season 1) * Pilar Gamboa as Violeta Morano \u2020 (season 1) * Marina Bellati as Melania * Leo Kreimer as \"Zurdo\" * Ana Mar\u00eda Castel as Elvira (season 1) * Fabi\u00e1n Arenillas as Manuel Soria * Carlos Belloso as Livio Muzak \u2020 (season 1) * Favio Posca as Ronco Milevich * Fabi\u00e1n Gianola as Dreyfus * Mart\u00edn Bossi as Patr\u00f3n Carranza * Tom\u00e1s Fonzi as Joaqu\u00edn Ferragut \u2020 (season 1) * Daniel Hendler as Wilson Castro \u2020 (season 1) * Emilio Disi as Am\u00e9rico (season 1) ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Category:2010s Argentine television series Category:2011 telenovelas Category:2011 Argentine television series debuts Category:2012 Argentine television series endings Category:Superhero comedy television series Category:Spanish-language telenovelas Category:Sequel television series Category:Pol-ka telenovelas ",
