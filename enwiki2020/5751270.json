    "text": "The Erenik (; Serbian Cyrillic: \u0415\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a / \u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a), or the Ribnik, is a river in Kosovo. Located in the west of the country, it measures -long, a right tributary to the White Drin. The Erenik originates near the Albanian border, in the northern slopes of the Junik Mountains, a part of the Prokletije massif, under the \u0110eravica peak (), the highest of such in Kosovo. The river flows to the south and south-east, following the eastern edge of the Prokletije mountains, dividing them from the western region. Before passing through Gjakova, there is a string of settlements: the villages of Jasi\u010b, Nivokaz and Pono\u0161evac, the small town of Junik and the village and mine of Babaj Boks. It receives many streams from the right, flowing down from the Prokletije mountains (most notably, \u0160lepica and Re\u010dica), but the Erenik's major tributaries are from its western side (Trava and Lo\u0107anska Bistrica). After Gjakova, the Erenik flows beside the villages of Ra\u010da and Bistra\u017ein, soon emptying into the White Drin near the village and hill of Gradi\u0161te. The river formed an epigene gallery feature called \u0160vanjski most in the hill. The river valley in this final section serves as a part of the route of the Pe\u0107- Gjakova-Prizren road. The Erenik belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin, draining an area of . It is not navigable. ==See also== * Terzijski Bridge ==Notes== ==References== * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan \u0110.
