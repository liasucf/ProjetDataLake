On May 19, 2015, they released the art work for their new album and announced that the album will be released on August 28, 2015. They launched a preview for their new single titled \"Jekyll and Hyde\" in a special video message. They also announced the dates of a co-headlining North American Tour with Papa Roach and accompanied by In This Moment as special guests with support from From Ashes to New for the tour, during which they will promote the album. The release date was later moved back a week to September 4, 2015. Drummer Jeremy Spencer said of the new album in an interview, \"I'm digging it, man. It's actually more brutal, with more extreme dynamics. There are some really mellow parts and then some really brutal parts. So we're running the whole gamut of sounds.\". ==Reception== Selling 119,000 units in its first week, Got Your Six debuted at number two on the September 26, 2015, survey of the Billboard 200, and number one on the Top Rock Albums survey of the same date.
