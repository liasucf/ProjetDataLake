Earlier, Stucky served on the board of the Sanger Independent School District for fifteen years, four as the president. Stucky was elected to the House in 2016, when the incumbent Republican in the district, Myra Crownover, of Lake Dallas, retired after sixteen years in the position. In 2017, Stucky joined state Senator Kirk Watson of Austin in filing legislation to refer the issue of feral hog proliferation to a university study to determine what impact that poisoning these animals, as proposed by Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, would have on the land, agriculture, and hunters. Stucky and Watson want the research conducted before Miller can proceed with his proposal to exterminate the hogs, which have caused millions of dollars in damage to area landowners.\"Lawmakers file slew of last-minute bills\", San Antonio Express-News, March 11, 2017, p.
