Idaho competed as a member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), and played their home games in the Kibbie Dome, an indoor facility on campus in Moscow, Idaho. The Vandals were led by Dennis Erickson, hired following the departure of Nick Holt for an assistant's position at USC in February 2006. Erickson was previously the head coach of the Vandals from 1982 to 1985, his first collegiate head coaching position. The Vandals won their first three conference games to move to 4\u20133 overall, then lost their final five games, all in conference. They finished the season with a 4\u20138 overall record and 3\u20135 in conference play, which was the team's seventh-straight season with a losing record. Erickson departed in December to become the head coach at Arizona State. ==Schedule== Idaho's reported home attendance for 2006 was 72,717 for five games, an average of 15,543. The maximum was 17,000 for the Boise State game on October 21, and the minimum was 10,435 for the San Jose State game on November 25, two days after Thanksgiving. ==References== Idaho Category:Idaho Vandals football seasons Idaho Vandals football ",
