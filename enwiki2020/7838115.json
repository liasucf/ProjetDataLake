His sons fought for control and, after a series of family tragedies, the hotel was subleased in 2002 to Steven Greenberg, the founder of the Roxy nightclub. A bar was added to the roof but the restaurant closed. It began to attract a younger clientele and the prices began to increase rapidly.

Schnabel designed the interiors, many fixtures and furniture pieces throughout the hotel. In 2010 Schrager sold his interests in the hotel and is no longer affiliated with it.\"Past Projects\" on the Ian Schrager Company website Gramercy Park Hotel is currently owned by the real estate firm RFR Holding LLC, and operated by Manhattan Hospitality Advisors.
