    "text": "Clic is a 1974 album by Italian experimental musician Franco Battiato. The album, released on the Island Records label (catalogue ILPS 9323), is a brooding and intense collection of instrumental/vocal arrangements. Dedicated to Karlheinz Stockhausen, the music has stylistic similarities with Philip Glass and Tangerine Dream, but is more lyrical and has elements of musique concr\u00e8te. It was later re-released on CD with a different track listing. ==Reception== Reviewing the 1998 re-release of album for AllMusic, Ned Raggett said: > Aside from backing vocals and a string quartet, everything else is > Battiato's doing, with the Krautrock touches apparent in his previous work > starting to surface all the more readily here. Things are generally more > meditative and reflective, though certainly Battiato isn't far from his > usual wry humor (thus \"Propriedad Prohibida,\" the title of his bitterly wry > take on more-leftist-than-thou Italian bands of the time like Area, though > the song itself is a quietly entrancing instrumental). ... \"Il Mercato Degli > Dei\" is as representative of the album as anything, an instrumental composed > of various parts and consisting almost entirely of Battiato's various > keyboard explorations arranged and overdubbed, but emphasizing calm, quiet > arrangements rather than Rick Wakeman-like orgies of sound. \"I Cancelli > Della Memoria\" makes for a great start to the album, soothing Tangerine > Dream-like airs and bubbling synth bass loops mixing with everything from > (apparently) Battiato's own sax work to his more expected piano parts. ==Musicians== * Franco Battiato - voice, piano, keyboards, VCS3, kalimba, special effects * Gianni Mocchetti - bass, electric guitar * Gianfranco D'Adda - percussion * Gianni Bedori - saxophones * Jutta Nienhaus - vocals on \"Revolution in the Air\" * Juri Camisasca - vocals ==Other personnel== * Producer: Pino Massara * Art Director: Franco Battiato, Peppo Delconte * Designer: Mario Covertino * Photography: Roberto Masotti ==Track listing (original 1974 vinyl release)== *Music and lyrics by Franco Battiato. # \"Propiedad Prohibida\" (5.22) # \"No U Turn\" (4:53) # \"Gates of Memory\" (6:11) # \"Revolution in the Air\" (14:02) ==Track listing (1998 CD re-release)== (all music and lyrics by Battiato) # \"I Cancelli Della Memoria\" # \"No U Turn\" # \"Il Mercato Degli Dei\" # \"Rien Ne Va Plus: Andante\" # \"Propiedad Prohibida\" # \"Nel Cantiere Di Un'Infanzia\" # \"Ethika Fon Ethica\" ==References== Category:1974 albums Category:Franco Battiato albums Category:Island Records albums ",
