    "text": "Duncan Cowan Ferguson (born 27 December 1971) is a Scottish former professional footballer who is the assistant manager of Premier League club Everton. He began his career at Dundee United in 1990, and moved to Rangers in 1993 for what was then a British transfer record fee. He spent the remainder of his career in England, moving to Everton in 1994 before a stint with Newcastle United between 1998 and 2000, after which he returned to Everton. Ferguson retired from playing in 2006, and was promoted to the first team coaching staff at Everton in 2014. Following the dismissal of Everton manager Marco Silva in December 2019, Ferguson was named as the team's caretaker manager until Silva's replacement Carlo Ancelotti was appointed manager a few weeks later, at which point Ferguson was made assistant manager. During his career, Ferguson won the FA Cup with Everton in 1995. He was capped for Scotland seven times but subsequently made himself unavailable for selection for the national team due to a dispute with the Scottish Football Association. He has scored more goals than any other Scottish player in England's Premier League since its creation in 1992. Ferguson's aggressive style of play resulted in nine red cards and a three-month prison sentence following an on- field assault of Raith Rovers' John McStay in 1994. Eight of those red cards were in the Premier League, where he holds the joint record for dismissals alongside Patrick Vieira and Richard Dunne. He is known by the nicknames \"Big Dunc\" and \"Duncan Disorderly\". ==Club career== ===Dundee United=== Born in Stirling, Ferguson played for the juvenile side Carse Thistle. Dundee United signed him as a schoolboy and he went on to win the BP Youth Cup in 1990. Later that year Ferguson made his professional debut for them against Rangers at Ibrox Stadium on 10 November 1990. His first goal was an extra time winner against East Fife in the Scottish Cup on 29 January 1991. The following season saw him become a first team regular, with 41 appearances and 16 goals he became the club's top scorer. His good form continued in 1992\u201393 with 33 appearances and 15 goals. The form he displayed at Dundee United also saw him win a call up to the Scottish national team. ===Rangers=== Ferguson in 1994, during his spell at Rangers Ferguson moved to Rangers in 1993 for a transfer fee of \u00a34 million, which set a new British record. During a match with Raith Rovers in April 1994, Ferguson headbutted the visitors' John McStay in the south-west corner of the Ibrox pitch. Referee Kenny Clark did not see the incident, but Ferguson was subsequently charged and found guilty of assault. As it was his third conviction for assault, in addition to two other convictions, he received a three-month prison sentence in October 1995. The SFA banned Ferguson for 12 matches before the court case was heard. https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12697532.sfa-beaks-deliver-their-verdict- on-ferguson-striker-considers-appealing-against-his-12-game-ban/ Ferguson scored a last-minute winner against Motherwell, from a Brian Laudrup assist on the first game of the season. Four days later, Ferguson scored a hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win over Arbroath. ===Everton=== In October 1994, Everton were struggling under the management of Mike Walker and looking for options to reinvigorate their faltering season. The solution enacted was to take two Rangers players on a loan deal, Ian Durrant for one month and Ferguson for three. Ferguson's move to Everton was later made permanent by Walker's successor Joe Royle, and Ferguson played a key role in saving Everton from relegation, and also helping them win the 1994-95 FA Cup. The subsequent 1995\u201396 season was less successful for Ferguson. A persistent hernia problem caused him to be unavailable for large amounts of time, as did his prison sentence during the first half of the season. On 28 December 1997, Ferguson scored a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers in a 3\u20132 victory, the first time that a trio of headers had been scored in the Premier League. Everton finished the season surviving relegation only on goal difference. Ferguson was sold to Newcastle United for a fee of \u00a38 million in November 1998. The deal was done to sell Ferguson by the Everton chairman, Peter Johnson, without the knowledge of Walter Smith. Ferguson wrote a two-page goodbye letter in the club magazine to fans, stating his sadness at leaving and that he would never forget them. ===Newcastle United=== After bringing Ferguson to Newcastle, manager Ruud Gullit was rewarded when Ferguson scored twice on his debut against Wimbledon in the Premier League. The final result was a 3\u20131 victory to Newcastle. Ferguson subsequently suffered an injury and played only seven times in the 1998\u201399 season. This included a substitute appearance in the 1999 FA Cup Final, which Newcastle lost to Manchester United. His extended absence lasted from late December until April. Likewise, Ferguson was injured in the first half of the 1999\u20132000 season, and was unable to play in the last seven league matches of the season. His final appearance came in the FA Cup semi-final defeat to eventual winners Chelsea. ===Return to Everton=== Ferguson on his testimonial in 2015 On 17 August 2000, Ferguson moved back to Everton for a fee of \u00a33.75 million. The transfer had previously been close to collapse as he sought a \u00a31 million \"loyalty payment\" from Newcastle for not personally asking for a transfer; he had made the same amount of money from Everton when he transferred in 1998 on the same basis. Two days after signing, he played his first game in a 2\u20130 loss at Leeds United, coming on for Stephen Hughes after 56 minutes. On 23 August, on his return to Goodison Park, he scored twice in a 3\u20130 win over Charlton Athletic after coming on for Mark Hughes in the 67th minute. On 1 April 2002, Ferguson was sent off after 20 minutes for elbowing Bolton Wanderers' Kostas Konstantinidis in an off-the-ball incident in a 3\u20131 win for a struggling Everton side. In August 2003, Jamie Jackson of The Guardian called Ferguson \"arguably the biggest waste of money of all\", citing his high transfer fees and wages compared to his injury record and age. By that point, he had scored 12 times in 41 games in three years at Everton, while earning over \u00a35 million in salary. His 192 minutes of play in 2002\u201303 as a goalless substitute cost the club \u00a39,000 per minute. Ferguson was accused of racial abuse by Fulham's Lu\u00eds Boa Morte after an FA Cup fourth round match in January 2004. The accusation was dismissed by the Football Association, who found insufficient evidence. On 28 December that year, Ferguson came on for Marcus Bent in the 74th minute of Everton's 2\u20130 loss at Charlton, and within ten minutes he was sent off for an elbow on Hermann Hrei\u00f0arsson. During the 2005\u201306 season, Ferguson was sent off against Wigan Athletic for violent conduct. His confrontation with Paul Scharner and subsequent fracas with Pascal Chimbonda resulted in a seven-match ban and saw his Premier League red\u2013card count reach eight, equalling Patrick Vieira's record. On 7 May 2006, against West Bromwich Albion at Goodison Park, Ferguson was named captain in the game that marked the end of his Everton career. His 90th-minute penalty kick was saved by Tomasz Kuszczak, but he subsequently scored from the rebound, netting his final goal for the club. Ferguson was not given a new Everton deal and retired, moving his family to Mallorca and spurning advances from a number of clubs. Ferguson played for Everton in a testimonial match in his honour on 2 August 2015 against Villarreal. ==International career== Ferguson made his first full international appearance for Scotland in May 1992. He hit the crossbar with an overhead kick during a friendly match with Germany. He made seven Scotland appearances in all, with his last appearance coming in February 1997.Football: Scots open door to reluctant Ferguson, The Independent, 3 April 1999Silent hero enjoying life, The Guardian, 19 March 2000 He refused international selection after 1997, partly in protest against his treatment by the SFA after his conviction for assault on John McStay and in particular the imposition of a 12-game ban on top of his 3-month prison sentence.Ferguson in ToffeeWeb ==Coaching career== Having spent five years in Mallorca following his retirement from playing, Ferguson contacted his former manager at Everton, David Moyes. Ferguson asked if he could work with the Everton academy students at Finch Farm.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/8835107/Duncan- Ferguson-returns-to-Everton-to-coach-youth-team.html Initially Ferguson was a voluntary worker at the academy, working for Alan Irvine, a former mentor of his from his playing career. Although Ferguson remains disappointed with the Scottish FA for what he sees as a lack of support following his sentencing in 1995, he enrolled on a nine-day Scottish FA organised coaching course in Largs, Scotland to earn a UEFA B-Licence. In May 2012, he returned to Largs to achieve a UEFA A licence and in January 2013 he enrolled on a further course and is working towards a UEFA Pro Licence. In February 2014 Ferguson was promoted to the first team coaching staff at Everton. His first game in the role was a home game against West Ham United on 1 March 2014. Following the dismissal of manager Marco Silva on 5 December 2019, Ferguson was named as caretaker manager of Everton. In his first game in charge two days later, Everton beat Chelsea 3\u20131 to lift themselves out of the relegation zone. Following the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti as the new manager later that month, Ferguson was made assistant manager. ==Personal life== ===Burglary attempts at his homes=== In 2001, two burglars broke into Ferguson's home in Rufford, Lancashire. Ferguson confronted them and was able to detain one of them, who subsequently spent three days in hospital. The second man managed to flee but was eventually caught. Both men were sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment for their actions. In 2003, Ferguson caught another burglar at his home in Formby, Merseyside; the burglar attacked Ferguson, who retaliated. The burglar was hospitalised and later alleged that Ferguson had assaulted him, but this was dismissed by police. ===Convictions for physical altercations=== Ferguson has had four convictions for assault \u2013 two arising from taxi rank scuffles, one an altercation with a fisherman in an Anstruther pub, and one for his on-field headbutt on Raith Rovers defender John McStay in 1994 while playing for Rangers, which resulted in a rare conviction for an on- the-field incident. The first incident led to a \u00a3100 fine for headbutting a policeman and a \u00a325 fine for a Breach of the Peace,Duncan Cowan Ferguson v Andrew Christie Normand (Procurator Fiscal, Glasgow) 1995 S.C.C.R. 770 while the second resulted in a \u00a3200 fine for punching and kicking a supporter on crutches. He was sentenced to a year's probation for the third offence.\"Football: Trials of the pounds 4m man: James Traynor looks at the troubled life and career of Rangers' record signing\", The Independent, 24 October 1993 For the 1994 on-the-field headbutting, he received and served a three-month jail term for assault. Ferguson's troubles with the law and his imprisonment inspired Finnish composer Osmo Tapio R\u00e4ih\u00e4l\u00e4 to write a symphonic poem as a \"musical portrait\" of Ferguson, titled Barlinnie Nine. ===Campaigning=== Ferguson has pledged his support to the \"Keep Everton in Our City\" campaign, saying: ==Career statistics== :Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | League Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
