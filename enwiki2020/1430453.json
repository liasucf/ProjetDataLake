Agriculture and supporting industries are the town's primary economic activities. The town is the first town on the Wildflower Way, a tourist route that stretches north to Mullewa. The town has an elevation of . At the 2016 census, Dalwallinu had a population of 699. The name of the town comes from the Aboriginal word that means \"place to wait a while\" or possible \"goodlands\". The first inhabitants of the area were Aboriginal people who used the area for hunting and gathering. The Badimaya people lived in the northern areas of the shire and the Karlamaya peoples inhabited the southern areas. Originally called South Nugadong, the site of the town was officially gazetted in 1914. The first Europeans to arrive were Benedictine monks who came from New Norcia to graze their sheep on the pastoral leases that they had taken up. The first settlers arrived, hoping to develop the lands for wheat, in 1907. The region was surveyed in 1909 and then opened for selection in 1910 with crops being planted shortly afterward. Two brothers, Albert and Frederick Ellison, built a well on the southern end of the township in 1909. The well acted as a permanent source of water to the settlers. The well, named Billum Billum well, was built from locally occurring timber such as gimlet and salmon gum. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. Dalwallinu is on the railway route that used to be utilised for Northam to Mullewa rail services, such as The Mullewa. They no longer operate, with the line inoperational between Dalwallinu and Perenjori South.https://www.arcinfra.com/ARCInfrastructure/media/documents/Network%20Specifications/Arc- Infrastructure-Network-Control-Boundaries.pdf ==References== ==External links== Category:Towns in Western Australia Category:Wheatbelt (Western Australia) ",
