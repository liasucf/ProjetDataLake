    "text": "Ronald Montague Barnes (June 11, 1927 \u2013 November 3, 1997), was an American carillon performer, teacher, composer, and arranger throughout the twentieth century. He was a major force in establishing an American approach to carillon performance, composing and arranging. Barnes' style revolved around the carillon as a concert instrument, requiring an intense focus on the sound of the bells. He began playing the carillon at First-Plymouth Congregational Church, earning his BMus in 1950 at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and his MA at Stanford University in 1961. Barnes joined the Guild of Carillonneurs of North America (GCNA) in 1948, serving as the publisher of the Guild's Bulletin and president for three terms. From 1952 to 1963 he was University Carillonist at the University of Kansas, Lawrence. He was Cathedral Carillonneur at the National Cathedral, Washington, DC, from 1963 to 1975 and University Carillonist at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1982 until his retirement in 1995. Much of Barnes' music is considered to be standard playing for carillon students. At Berkeley, he founded the Berkeley Carillon Institute, and in 1988 he was awarded the GCNA's Certificate of Extraordinary Service. Barnes died of leukemia on November 3, 1997 at Coming Home Hospice in San Francisco. He was 70. In 1998, the GCNA established a memorial scholarship in his name to support the future of the carillon art in North America. ==Works for Carillon (alphabetical)== Below is a selective list of Barnes works for carillon. * 14 Carillon Preludes on Appalachian White Spirituals * Andante Cantabile * Canzone * Capriccio I * Capriccio II (1992) * Capriccio III (1993) * Concerto for Two to Play (1982) * Concerto Grosso I * Concerto Grosso II * Corelliana Suite (1984) * Dances for After Dark * Dialogues * English Folksong Prelude on \"The Keeper\" * Eulogy for Ira Schroeder * Fantasy-Pastorale * Fantasy-Variations on \"Dr. Bull's Juell\" * Fantasy-Variations on \"Jenny Jones\" * Folksong Prelude on \"Sweet Nightingale\" * Four Old English and French Dances (1968) * Giulianiana * Introduction and Sicilienne (1982) * Introit for Christmas Eve * Menuet Champ\u00eatre Refondu * Mrs. Nordan's Alborada * Musick for a While (1993) * Nativity Triptych * No\u00ebl Suite I * No\u00ebl Suite II * Paraphrase on a Siciliana of Pasquale Ricci (1984) * Paraphrase on \"The Irish Carol\" * Prelude (1952) * Prelude and Fugue on Old 104th (1988) * Prelude, Intermezzo and Finale * Prelude on \"My Lord of Carnarvon's Jig\" * Prelude on Veni Creator (1982) * Promenade (1964) * Sarabande (1952) * Scottish Folk Song Preludes * Serenade for Carillon I (1978) * Serenade for Carillon II (1979) * Signals * A Simple Suite (1992\u201393) * Six Classical Country Dances (1984) * A Somber Pavan (1984) * Sonatine * Song Prelude on \"Past Three o'Clock\" * A Suite of English Folksongs * Three Anglo-American Folksongs (which caution against some of the perils of falling in love) * Three Dream Dances * Three Sketches * Variations on Wilson's Wilde (1984) * Waltz (1984) * Western Wind (1966) == References == == External links == * Video of Ronald Barnes' Serenade I - Processional * Guild of Carillonneurs of North America * The Carillon of Washington Cathedral, by Ronald Barnes and Richard Strauss Category:Carillonneurs Category:1927 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Stanford University alumni Category:University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln alumni Category:Composers for carillon ",
