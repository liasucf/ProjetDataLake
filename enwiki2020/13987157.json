He studied in England, in Germany, and in Paris and graduated doctor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig. Acting under the advice of Andrieux, a well-known poet, he settled in Paris as a professor of English, and found employment at L'\u00c9cole de Commerce, at L'\u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es, at L'\u00c9cole des Mines, and at the Lyc\u00e9e Bonaparte. Spiers was nominated an Agr\u00e9g\u00e9 de l'Universit\u00e9 (roughly, a professorship), an Officier de l'Instruction Publique (officer of the Education Minister), Examinateur \u00e0 la Sorbonne, and Inspecteur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Universit\u00e9. He received the cross of the Legion of Honour from Napoleon III. He married in 1853 Victoire Dawes Newman, by whom he left five sons. He died at Passy, near Paris, on 26 Aug. 1869. ==English-French dictionary== For fourteen years he devoted himself largely to compiling a new English-French and French-English dictionary. It appeared in 1846 as General English and French Dictionary, newly composed from the English dictionaries of Johnson, Webster, Richardson, &c.;, and from the French dictionaries of the French Academy, of Laveaux, Boiste, (London, 1846). It proved superior to anything which had preceded it, and was at once \u2018autoris\u00e9 par le conseil de l'instruction publique\u2019, 3 July 1846. The twenty-ninth edition, in two volumes, appeared in 1884 (remodelled by H. Witcomb, Spiers's successor at the \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es), and it remained for a long time a standard dictionary. Both Ralph Waldo Emerson and John Muir owned copies. An abridgment, under the title of Dictionnaire abr\u00e9g\u00e9 Anglais-Fran\u00e7ais et Fran\u00e7ais-Anglais, abr\u00e9g\u00e9 du Dictionnaire G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de M. Spiers, was brought out in 1851 and supplied to almost every school and lyc\u00e9e in France. In November 1857 he brought an action against L\u00e9on Contanseau and his publishers, Longmans & Co., for violating the copyright of his dictionaries in a work entitled A Practical Dictionary of the French and English Languages\u2019 but Vice-chancellor Sir William Page Wood (afterwards Lord Hatherley), in his decision on 25 February 1858, said that, although great use of Spiers's books had been made without due acknowledgement, yet in regard to such publications, which were not entirely original, a charge of piracy could not be sustained. Major General Sir Edward Louis Spears, 1st Baronet (1886\u20131974) was his grandson, who had changed his name from Spiers to Spears. ==Works== Besides his Dictionary, Spiers's chief publications were: :1. Manual of Commercial Terms in English and French, 1846. :2. Study of the English Prose Writers, Sacred and Profane, 1852. :3. Treatise on English Versification, 1852. :4. The English Letter- Writer, 1853. :5. Study of English Poetry, a choice collection of the finest pieces of the poets of Great Britain, 1855. All these works were issued in both English and French editions in London, Paris, and America (New York or Philadelphia). Spiers also printed and edited for French students Sheridan's The School for Scandal and The Essays of F. Bacon, Viscount St. Albans (1851). ==References== ;Attribution Category:1807 births Category:1869 deaths Category:\u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech alumni Category:English lexicographers ",
