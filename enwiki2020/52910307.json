The scion of an aristocratic family, he was made to study for a career in the church, but fled Moldavia and studied abroad. Acquainted with the Romanian liberal movement, and an ardent Romanian nationalist, he helped establish bodies of intellectuals dedicated to cultural and political cooperation across the Danubian Principalities and beyond\u2014including, in 1846, the Romanian library of Paris. His purchase of mainly Baroque paintings, donated by him to Academia Mih\u0103ilean\u0103, forms the core of the Ia\u0219i Museum of Art. With Nicolae B\u0103lcescu and C. A. Rosetti, V\u00e2rnav also managed the Society of Romanian Students in Paris, whose revolutionary agenda brought him into conflict with European governments. He then played a small part in the French Revolution of 1848, before returning to take orders at Neam\u021b Monastery, a Hieromonk and Starets. Throughout the 1850s, he and his brother Constantin, who was the son-in-law of Gheorghe Bibescu, took part in the nationalist movement that established the United Principalities, and was especially active as an electoral campaigner. However, his support of modernization in schools and the church was not welcomed by the religious establishment, and his stand-off with the conservative monks of Neam\u021b resulted in the establishment of a dissident monastery. Subsequently, V\u00e2rnav lost the backing of Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, although he still approved of Cuza's authoritarian agenda. After campaigning nationally in support of Carol I, V\u00e2rnav ended his career in Tutova County. Active in antisemitic circles, he was allied with the Free and Independent Faction. On this basis, he contested a seat in the Assembly of Deputies during December 1867, but died after sudden illness just days after winning. Rumors of his poisoning by the Romanian Jews sparked a riot, which had to be quelled by armed intervention, and an official inquiry. He was survived by his brother Constantin and a nephew, engineer and politician Scarlat C. V\u00e2rnav. ==Biography== ===Early activities=== It is known that V\u00e2rnav was a native of Hili\u0219eu (or Sili\u0219eu), Dorohoi County, but other details remain sketchy, with his year of birth given as far back as 1801Dimitrie R. Rosetti, Dic\u021bionarul contimporanilor, p. 190. Bucharest: Editura Lito- Tipografiei Populara, 1897 or as recent as 1813.Dimitrescu, p. 65; Isar, p. 1442 He belonged to a large family of the Moldavian boyar nobility, attested back to 1621; he was distantly related to Teodor V\u00e2rnav, the Bessarabian writer.Arthur Gorovei, Monografia Ora\u0219ului Boto\u0219ani, pp. 142\u2013153.

Scarlat had a younger brother, Constantin (also known as Costandin or Costache), who trained himself as a surgeon. Together, the two inherited Hili\u0219eu estate and part of Liveni.Ghib\u0103nescu (1929), pp. 35\u201336. See also Iftimi & Iftimi, p. 102 After an early education provided by his father,Dimitrescu, pp. 65\u201366 Scarlat was selected by his mother to take orders in the Moldavian Church. While tutored by Sofronie Miclescu, he escaped to his relatives in the Duchy of Bukovina, and later made his way to Paris.Dimitrescu, p. 66 These events are tentatively dated to 1834 or 1836.Isar, p. 1433 V\u00e2rnav lived in France until 1848, attending Paris Law Faculty and probably also hearing literature courses at the College of Sorbonne.Isar, pp. 1433\u20131434. See also Dimitrescu, p. 66 With his own private funds, he purchased the art collection of Aguado de las Marismas on the recommendation of Gheorghe Panaiteanu Bardasare. It included paintings by Caravaggio, Philippe de Champaigne, Egbert van Heemskerck, Eustache Le Sueur, Pietro Liberi, Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo, and Fran\u00e7ois Stella;Ichim, pp. 318\u2013319 V\u00e2rnav also owned a copy of Philippoteaux's La Retraite de Russie, which was probably done by the artist himself, and which he may have purchased at the Exposition nationale des beaux-arts of Brussels, in 1842.Grigorescu, pp. 256\u2013257 In 1847, he donated all artworks in his possession to the Moldavian state, which took little interest in the offer. The collection was left to deteriorate at a shipyard in Gala\u021bi.Dimitrescu, p. 66; Ichim, pp. 318\u2013319, 325 Taking up the cause of Romanian nationalism, V\u00e2rnav established in 1846 a Romanian library, which he dedicated to the \"new era\" of European liberalism,Nistor, p. 532; Stino, pp. 85\u201386 and also set the foundation for a Romanian Orthodox chapter in Paris.Dimitrescu, p. 66; Pocitan Ploe\u0219teanu, pp. 83, 89 According to the Moldavian liberal writer Gheorghe Sion, V\u00e2rnav was good friends with a Rom, Dinc\u0103, born into slavery at Pa\u0219cani. He tried to persuade Dinc\u0103 not to return to his owners to Moldavia, offering to employ him as a secretary of the library.Gheorghe Sion, Suvenire contimporane, p. 38. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1915. In the mid 1840s, V\u00e2rnav was also in contact with the agronomist and political thinker Ion Ionescu de la Brad, sponsoring his attempts to set up a model farm in southern Moldavia, and also offering to employ Ionescu as a trainer of peasants.Bogdan- Duic\u0103, p. 103. See also Isar, pp. 1440, 1441\u20131442 V\u00e2rnav family coat of arms In his address to the library's patrons, he explained that he regarded the Romanian language and the church as the two \"protective genii of our nationhood.\"Stino, p. 86 V\u00e2rnav's manifesto also chided Westernized Romanians for forgetting their modernizing mission, and even their native language, suggesting that the two were inextricably linked. He proposed that the emerging Romanian literature needed to keep cosmopolitan tendencies in check: the predominant themes needed to display \"originality and Romanianism\" rather than the \"illusions of the senses\" and \"chimeras of individual hurdles.\"Isar, pp. 1438\u20131439 His focus was on providing young intellectuals with a cultural training that was already in their vernacular language; this included efforts to discard the Cyrillic orthography as \"foreign\", and familiarize students with the various adaptations from Latin.Stino, pp. 86\u201388. See also Iorga, pp. 175\u2013179 His own experiments resulted in what historian Nicolae Iorga deems a \"bizarre personal orthography\".Iorga, p. 175 While the nationalist movement was struggling to popularize the name \"Romanian\" for the shared ethnicity and culture, and trying to settle on a spelling of that word, V\u00e2rnav suggested the variant Roum\u00e9n(\u00e9), later replaced by rom\u00e2n and rom\u00e2n\u0103.Pocitan Ploe\u0219teanu, p. 26 He also proposed that linguists from the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia), as well as from other Romanian-speaking regions, meet up in congress \"somewhere central to the Romanian lands\".Iorga, p. 176; Stino, pp. 87\u201388 ===Student activist=== In V\u00e2rnav's own definition, the political unification of Moldavia and Wallachia could originate from the cultural \"fusion\" that he was promoting in the Romanian student colony; his letters of the time opened with the slogan Vivat Unirea (\"Long Live Union\").Isar, p. 1440 His campaigning led to the establishment of a Society of the Romanian Students in Paris, which met at his house in Quartier de la Sorbonne (Place de la Sorbonne, 3, where the library was also housed).Bodea, pp. 79, 297\u2013298, 309; Dimitrescu, p. 66; Iorga, pp. 176\u2013177; Isar, pp. 1436\u20131437; Nistor, pp. 531, 534; Pocitan Ploe\u0219teanu, pp. 25\u201326 Its triumvirate leadership comprised Ion Ghica and C. A. Rosetti of Wallachia, with the Moldavian V\u00e2rnav as cashier.Xenopol, pp. 236\u2013237. See also Isar, p. 1436 However, Rosetti and V\u00e2rnav handled most of daily business, with Ghica effectively absent from Paris after August 1846; in later months, Rosetti also left, to be replaced by Nicolae B\u0103lcescu. This and other concerns prompted the Society to seek patronage from conservative figures in both Principalities\u2014Nicolae Ghica- Com\u0103ne\u0219ti, Roxanda Roznovanu, Alexandru Sturdza-Micl\u0103u\u0219anu, and various others.Bodea, pp. 78\u201380, 82, 85 V\u00e2rnav also offered honorary presidency to the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine who, as he recalled, accepted with \"the greatest joy and affection\".Bodea, p. 83; Stino, p. 85 From about 1845, V\u00e2rnav had been accepted into the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e des Etrangers, a Masonic lodge of the Grand Orient de France.Marian Dul\u0103, \"Francmasoneria \u0219i Biserica\", in Revista Nou\u0103, Nr. 3/2011, p. 63 Despite his public overture to the conservative boyars, he had also joined the Wallachians' secret society, Fr\u0103\u021bia (\"The Brotherhood\"), which was repressed at home but maintained a presence in the diaspora; the Society itself may have been a front for Rosetti's revolutionary conspiracy.Bodea, pp. 50\u201351 Privately, he expressed his dislike for the patronage, noting that Ghica-Com\u0103ne\u0219ti and the others had surrendered the Society to \"backbiters\".Bodea, p. 80 The Society was still highly popular, and, according to ledgers published by V\u00e2rnav, made a yearly profit of 21,200 francs in subscriptions and donations.Pocitan Ploe\u0219teanu, p. 26. See also Iorga, pp. 178\u2013179 He was able to sponsor scholarships for new recruits to the nationalist cause, including Nicolae Ionescu,Iorga, p. 179 N. Chinezu, and Ianache Lecca.Bodea, pp. 114 V\u00e2rnav's brother Constantin In Moldavia, Constantin became famous for his advocacy of balneotherapy, and also for his work during the 1848 cholera epidemic: he was the only doctor of Ia\u0219i to have survived the calamity. This was particularly unusual, as he did not believe that cholera was contagious, and relied on folk medicine in his attempts to cure it.Iorga, pp. 185\u2013187 He shared some of Scarlat's views about modernization, publishing his plans to set up a sanitary service and medical schools.Iorga, pp. 182\u2013186 From 1844, he was also son-in-law of the Wallachian Prince Gheorghe Bibescu,Bodea, p. 268 a conservative figure. Nonetheless, the Students' Society revolutionary connections irritated Bibescu, and also caused concern in Russia, which, at the time, shared custody of the Principalities. Despite Lamartine's support, these developments also worried the French monarchy, which was transitioning to conservatism. The Guizot government chose not to give any recognition to the Society, pushing it into the underground.Bodea, pp. 90\u201391. See also Isar, p. 1437 ===Revolutionary=== By November 1847, V\u00e2rnav, B\u0103lcescu, Lecca and Chinezu, alongside Grigore Arghiropol, Dimitrie Br\u0103tianu, Ion C. Br\u0103tianu and Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu, founded the semi-legal \u00censocierea Lazarian\u0103 (\"Lazarian Association\"). Named in honor of Gheorghe Laz\u0103r, it had a political project to unify and standardize education in both Principalities.Bodea, pp. 91\u201394. See also Isar, pp. 1437\u20131439 This agenda was seen as untimely by other intellectuals, including Alexandru G. Golescu, who refused to participate.Bodea, pp. 91\u201394 Now openly drawn to radical politics, V\u00e2rnav became an active participant in the February Revolution, serving in the National Guard. He reportedly tried to cross the border into Moldavia that March, just days before of the abortive liberal revolution; the conservative Prince Mihail Sturdza ordered the border guards to prevent him from doing so. One of his companions, Teodor R\u00e2\u0219canu, managed to pass through, but soon after had to flee for Wallachia.Gh. Ungureanu, \"Fram\u00eent\u0103ri social-politice premerg\u0103toare mi\u0219c\u0103rii revolu\u021bionare din 1848 \u00een Moldova\", in Studii. Revist\u0103 de Istorie, Nr. 3/1958, p. 19. See also Ghib\u0103nescu (1915), p. 373 V\u00e2rnav made a return to Bukovina, where other Moldavian radicals had found temporary refuge. He proposed that the library funds be used to sponsor selective clandestine returns to the country; when other Society members argued against this initiative, he promised to pay back the money using his personal assets.Isar, p. 1442 He himself eventually returned to his native country alongside Claude Thions, Consul to Moldavia of the French Second Republic. According to Ion Nistor, V\u00e2rnav received the title of Postelnic and was advanced to Sublieutenant in the Moldavian Militia;Nistor, p. 535 however, Iorga indicates, these were bestowed upon another Scarlat V\u00e2rnav, who had remained in Moldavia.Iorga, p. 186 Upon arrival, Moldavian officials asked him to pay storage fees for the Marismas collection, but he was also able to recover it from Gala\u021bi in 1850.Ichim, pp. 318\u2013319, 325 He ordered its restoration, and assigned it to Bardasare and Gheorghe Asachi at Academia Mih\u0103ilean\u0103.Dimitrescu, pp. 66\u201367 It was the basis of the Ia\u0219i Museum of Art, which opened for the public in 1860.Dimitrescu, pp. 66\u201367; Grigorescu, p. 257; Ichim, pp. 318\u2013319 In 1850, after only a few months' novitiate,Rosetti, p. 692 the former revolutionary was ordained a monk at Neam\u021b Monastery, taking the name Sofronie V\u00e2rnav (transitional alphabet: Sof\u0440onie \u0412a\u0440na\u0432\ua64b\u0306). Described by Iorga as intelligent, charitable and industrious, he was for a while the community's Starets, but apparently also returned to Hili\u0219eu, where he enjoyed living among the peasants.Iorga, pp. 179\u2013181 He still maintained contacts with the Paris Orthodox circles, donating 5,000 ducats to the Romanian chapel,Pocitan Ploe\u0219teanu, p. 83 and, with Constantin, ceded a Czernowitz townhouse to the Romanian library of Bukovina, which opened in 1852.Nistor, pp. 529, 531 In 1851, both brothers also sponsored the establishment of a boys' school in Dorohoi.Gh. Amarandei, \"Vechi institu\u021bii culturale dorohoiene\", in Hierasus. Anuar '78, 1979, p. 414 The V\u00e2rnavs sold their Dorohoi estate over the late 1850s, with Scarlat liquidating all his assets there in December 1857; his land was sold to Eugeniu Alcaz.Ghib\u0103nescu (1929), p. 36 As argued by Iorga, the monk was adamantly \"democratic\", and from the 1840s proudly listed himself a taxpayer (birnic).Iorga, pp. 175\u2013176, 180 Similarly, historian Nicolae Isar argues that, by using birnic as his title, V\u00e2rnav highlighted at once his ideas of self-sacrifice for the greater good and his critique of the boyar class as a drain on Moldavia's budget.Isar, pp. 1441\u20131442 From before 1850, V\u00e2rnav had been affiliated with the National Party, which supported the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia. This prompted speculation that his turn to religion was a ruse for nationalists to have an agent of influence in the clergy.Rosetti, pp. 692\u2013693 He was again visible in political life shortly after the Crimean War, which inaugurated a series of major changes in Moldavian society. At the time, he openly celebrated Captain G. Filipescu for his defiance of the invading Russian Army, and later sent him a stallion. By June 1856, V\u00e2rnav was one of the Roman County clergymen who adhered to the National Party's Unionist Committee, which openly advocated the Principalities' merger, and later signed petitions for union's international recognition.Nistor, pp. 534\u2013535. See also Xenopol, pp. 332\u2013335 Before the election of July 1857, as \"Hieromonk Varnav\", he was a registered elector for the clergy estate in the Diocese of Hu\u0219i, while Constantin was registered with the boyars' college at Dorohoi.Iftimi & Iftimi, pp. 97\u201398, 100\u2013102 He endorsed an old friend, Vasile M\u0103linescu, who became a county delegate to the ad-hoc Divan.Isar, pp. 1440\u20131441 The younger V\u00e2rnav brother published the short-lived gazette Timpul (\"Times\"),Iorga, p. 187 and eventually ran in the elections of 1858, representing Dorohoi in the Divan. His campaign was organized by Scarlat, who rallied the peasant voters of Hili\u0219eu in church and re-baptized the village rallying point as \"Union Square\".Iorga, pp. 179\u2013180 The Divan's subsequent election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as Domnitor of the United Principalities was saluted as a major fulfillment in Scarlat's letters to Constantin Hurmuzachi. Described as an \"independent unionist\", he agitated in the streets, mocking his 1848 adversary Prince Sturdza, who had stood as a Moldavian-and-separatist candidate for the throne. V\u00e2rnav quipped that Strudza's royal cypher, M.S.V., stood for Mai St\u0103i Voinice (\"Whoa There Fella\"), and thus launched an urban legend.N. Petra\u0219cu, Scriitori rom\u00e2ni contemporani, I: Vasile Alecsandri, pp. 35\u201336. Bucharest: Tipografia Bucovina I. E. Torou\u021biu, 1930. He introduced several slogans for the unionist cause, which appeared on painted banners; his favorite was: Via\u021ba, averea, onorul, / Patriei prostern\u0103 Rom\u00e2nul! (\"The Romanian to his Motherland / Pledges his life, his fortune, his honor!\"). This was also featured on his 1859 testament, by which he donated all his belongings to the Paris library.Isar, p. 1441 ===Church conflicts=== 1859 cartoon mocking the censorship laws enforced under Alexandru Ioan Cuza Returning to live among the monks of Neam\u021b, V\u00e2rnav involved himself in the controversy over the secularization of monastery estates. Moldavia's Education Minister, Alexandru Teriachiu, assigned him to a reform committee which uncovered great irregularities at Neam\u021b, including a dysfunctional seminary and an inhumane ward for the insane.Rosetti, pp. 690\u2013693 V\u00e2rnav refurbished the seminary, and then also organized the peasant schools of Neam\u021b County, serving as inspector. Proposed innovations he \"learned at Paris\", now included the establishment of a printing press and the demolition of new additions to the historical site.Iorga, p. 181 However, he was also suspected of giving away boons, including the monastery's cloth factory and a large press, to his patron Kog\u0103lniceanu and to the government itself.Rosetti, p. 693 Such activism, and also his harsh temper,Rosetti, pp. 693, 885 led to numerous complaints. The new minister, Dimitrie Ros\u0103t, protected V\u00e2rnav. He scolded those monks who wanted him tried by church tribunal,B\u00eerzu, p. 104 calling them the \"hirelings of Russia\".Rosetti, p. 885 V\u00e2rnav himself had a long-standing feud with Hieromonk Andronic Popovici, whom he accused of using sermons to promote anti-Cuza sentiments and Russophilia. In September 1861, he obtained Popovici's demotion,B\u00eerzu, pp. 104\u2013105 prompting the latter to cross over into the Bessarabia Governorate and set up Noul Neam\u021b Monastery outside Kitskany. Andronic claimed that this establishment was merely a lavra for the old one. V\u00e2rnav, who kept the monastery seal on him, did not validate this in writing, but his adversaries either forged or obtained permission from other administrators.Rosetti, p. 897 Eventually, by 1862, Alexandru A. Cantacuzino took over at the ministry and had V\u00e2rnav arrested.Iorga, pp. 180\u2013182 V\u00e2rnav pleaded for his case and petitioned the Divan with letters also taken up in Tribuna Rom\u00e2n\u0103 gazette. Archimandrite Timotei Ionescu dismissed his defense as fantasy, depicting V\u00e2rnav as a persecutor of his monks, who had loosely interpreted Cuza's policies in order to suppress dissent at the monastery.Timotei Ionescu, \u0420e\u0441\u043f\u0223n\u0441\ua64b\u0306 \u043ba \u043feti\u0446i\u0223nea Sf-sa\u043be mona\u0445\u0223\u043b\u0223\u012d Sof\u0440onie \u0412a\u0440na\u0432\ua64b\u0306. Ia\u0219i: Tipar\u012dul Tribune\u012d Rom\u0103ne, 1862 According to church historian Melchisedec \u0218tef\u0103nescu, V\u00e2rnav, being \"detested by the public and disgraced by prince Cuza\", settled in Bucharest, \"providing his services to whoever would need them.\" He sees the former Starets as an extremist and a heretic, \"formed in the school of Blanqui, Pyat [and] Rochefort\".Melchisedec \u0218tef\u0103nescu, \"Biseric'a Ortodoxa si Calindariulu\", in Biseric'a si Sc\u00f3l'a, Nr. 28/1882, p. 290 V\u00e2rnav returned to favor in January 1864, when Dimitrie Bolintineanu, who chaired the unified ministry of education, appointed him to a commission that was tasked with assessing calendar reform. However, his name was immediately flagged and stricken out by the Metropolitan Bishop, Nifon Rusail\u0103. V\u00e2rnav, who was reportedly a delegate to the Elective Assembly in 1864, supported Cuza's anti- parliamentary coup.Ioan C. Filitti, Biserica Sf. Dumitru din Bucure\u0219ti (Strada Carol), p. 22. Bucharest: Tipografia C\u0103r\u021bilor Biserice\u0219ti, 1932 During the incident, he lived in a rented townhouse at Sf\u00e2ntul Dumitru\u2013Po\u0219t\u0103 Church in Lipscani, shared with Cuza's uncle Grigore. During the plebiscite of June 1864, organized by the Domnitor, he put up a \"lit sign\" reading: Popa V\u00e2rnav zice da (\"Father V\u00e2rnav Says [to Vote] Yes\"). Also a Cuza loyalist, Constantin V\u00e2rnav continued to serve on the Princely Court of Justice, where he notably enforced censorship laws against Ionescu de la Brad.Bogdan-Duic\u0103, pp. 69\u201370 ===1867 campaign and death=== In early 1866, Cuza and his authoritarian regime were deposed by a \"monstrous coalition\", with Carol of Hohenzollern presented as the new Domnitor. There was a plebiscite on his acceptance, during which V\u00e2rnav traveled as far south as Ploie\u0219ti and as far north as Bac\u0103u, persuading Wallachians and Moldavians alike to vote for Carol (and thus, for a cemented union).Iorga, p. 182 As Calinic Miclescu and others put up separatist resistance in Ia\u0219i, he also took an emergency trip there, effectively acting as a negotiator between the two camps.Iorga, pp. 181\u2013182 He ultimately settled in B\u00e2rlad in 1867,Antonovici, p. XIV and his last months were spent in Tutova County politics, but also in efforts to furnish the local hospital. According to Melchisedec \u0218tef\u0103nescu, he also continued to \"propagate his political and religious heresies\". With Ion and Constantin Codrescu, P. Chenciu, A. V. Ionescu, and Ioan Popescu, he established a \"National Liberal Party\", which functioned as the provincial affiliate of the Moldavian-wide Free and Independent Faction.Antonovici, pp. XIV\u2013XV Like other Factionalists, V\u00e2rnav also involved himself in the debates over the issue of Jewish emancipation, and is described by biographer Dimitrie R. Rosetti as a \"firebrand antisemite\". According to a Jewish man's letter, published in L'Echo Danubien, his \"preaching against the Israelites [was] of the most barbaric kind\", disturbing the otherwise tolerant mood of Tutova.Loeb, pp. 298\u2013299 V\u00e2rnav put himself up as a candidate for the Assembly of Deputies in the election of December 1867, winning a mandate at Tutova's Fourth College. Without ever taking his seat, he died at B\u00e2rlad, on ,\"D\u2013lu\u012d Redactore al\u016d d\u0326iarulu\u012d Rom\u00e2nul\u016d\", in Romanulu, January 1\u20133, 1868, p. 3. Isar (p. 1442) proposes December 26 after illness that lasted \"just one day\".\"Bucuresc\u012d 28 \u00cendrea 1867/9 C\u0103rindari\u016d 1868\", in Romanulu, December 25\u201329, 1868, p. 1 The mysterious circumstances led to an autopsy, which found nothing of relevance. His stomach and intestines were dispatched to Bucharest, for a more in-depth toxicological inquest. Already before his death, rumor spread that his Jewish enemies had poisoned the Starets, and a riot (or attempted pogrom) erupted in the city. As noted by Rosetti, \"the excitement of the population required intervention of troops sent in from bordering counties, as a safeguard for the Jews, whose lives were being threatened.\" The same is noted by Iorga: \"His death was found suspicious, and military measures were taken to curb the anti- Jewish movements.\" The conspiracy theory was shunned as \"infamy\" by the left- liberal daily Rom\u00e2nul, which noted that \"ignorance was exploited\" by \"the enemies of the country\"\u2014both in Tutova and Ialomi\u021ba County (the scene of a scandal over allegations of blood libel). However, the paper also played down the riot, reporting that only the local synagogue and a few Jewish houses had been damaged. According to a note of protest signed by 200 notables of B\u00e2rlad, the riot was started by mourners gathering in front of V\u00e2rnav's home, located opposite a Jewish establishment; altercations, they claimed, had been provoked by the Jews, who \"insulted [...] the agonizing patient\" and \"threw boiling water before the audience\". The petitioners asked the Interior Minister Ion Br\u0103tianu not to punish the populace for what it viewed as \"calumnies by the adversaries of the national cause\". Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle (AIU) sources tell that V\u00e2rnav himself had incensed the crowds earlier in the campaign, with endorsement from the \u0218tefan Golescu government.Loeb, pp. 167\u2013168, 298\u2013299 The pogrom, they argue, was attempted by some of the petitioners themselves, and higher authorities, who \"arrested all the Jews, supposedly to protect them\", actually \"facilitated things for the rioters\"; the investigation of the riot \"was opened, but carried no effect.\"Loeb, pp. 167\u2013168, 298\u2013300 On February 25, Br\u0103tianu spoke in the Assembly to announce that \"solely Jews\" had participated in the riot.Loeb, p. 300 As noted by the AIU, V\u00e2rnav's death was likely caused by \"some rather particular disease.\"Loeb, p. 167 Eventually, he was buried at B\u00e2rlad later that month, but his belongings, including itemized lists of donations for the Transilvania Cultural Society, were still in police custody by February.\"Romani'a. Adunarea Societ\u00e2tiei Transilvani'a procesu-vorbale (Urmare.)\", in Federatiunea, Nr. 28/1868, p. 108 Constantin, who served several terms in the Assembly and Senate, survived his brother by nine years, dying shortly after Romanian independence was achieved. His own son, Scarlat C. V\u00e2rnav, was by then becoming distinguished as a civil and military engineer. After managing the School of Bridges, Roads and Mines, he also pursued a career in politics with the Junimea constitutionalists in the 1890s. By then, Iorga claims, both his father and uncle had been unduly forgotten. In the interwar period, Iorga took over and revived V\u00e2rnav's student library, which became the nucleus of a Romanian School in Fontenay-aux-Roses.Nicolae Liu, \"Cartea \u0219i biblioteca, mijloace de cunoa\u0219tere \u0219i de apropiere \u00een istoria rela\u021biilor rom\u00e2no-franceze\", in Revista de Istorie, Nr. 3/1985, pp. 293, 299 ==Notes== ==References== Category:19th-century births Category:1868 deaths Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:Free and Independent Faction politicians Category:People of the Revolutions of 1848 Category:Romanian Freemasons Category:Romanian monarchists Category:Romanian educational theorists Category:Language reformers Category:Romanian activist journalists Category:Romanian propagandists Category:Romanian librarians Category:Romanian art collectors Category:Romanian book and manuscript collectors Category:Romanian conservationists Category:19th-century philanthropists Category:Romanian philanthropists Category:Romanian Orthodox monks Category:Romanian Orthodox priests Category:Starets Category:Romanian civil servants Category:People from Boto\u0219ani County Category:Moldavian nobility Category:Romanian expatriates in France Category:University of Paris alumni ",
