He was born in Wexford and later came to Newfoundland. He was employed in the fishery supply business at St. John's and St. Mary's. His business ran into difficulties about the same time as he served in the Newfoundland assembly. He later was involved in another fishery supply business with a nephew J.J. Tobin; it was dissolved in 1893. == References == Category:Members of the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly Category:1835 births Category:1908 deaths Category:Irish emigrants to pre-Confederation Newfoundland Category:Newfoundland Colony people ",
