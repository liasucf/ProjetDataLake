    "text": "The 1993 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat was a bloodless military coup which took place in Nigeria on 17 November 1993 when the Armed Forces, headed by Defence Minister General Sani Abacha, forced Interim President Chief Ernest Shonekan to resign. Shonekan assumed the interim presidency on 26 August 1993, succeeding General Ibrahim Babangida as head of state, in the aftermath of Babangida's annulment of the 12 June 1993 presidential election. In a nationwide broadcast following the coup, Abacha cited the stagnant nature of Shonekan's government, and him being unable to manage the democratic process in the country as a cause of his resignation. In September 1994, Abacha issued a decree that placed his government above the jurisdiction of the courts, effectively giving him absolute power. Another decree gave him the right to detain anyone for up to three months. Abacha stayed in power until his death on 8 June 1998 at the presidential complex (Aso Villa) in Abuja. He was succeeded by the Chief of the Defence Staff Major General Abdulsalami Abubakar as head of state. ==References== Category:History of Nigeria Category:Military coups in Nigeria Category:1993 in Nigeria Category:November 1993 events in Africa Category:1990s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts Category:Conflicts in 1993 ",
