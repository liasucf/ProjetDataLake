He grew up in the Hyde Park neighborhood on the city's South Side, where his father owned two restaurants. He had two brothers, Edward and Robert. From the age of 15, Morton bused tables, worked in the kitchen, and performed a wide array of odd jobs in the family business. He graduated from Hyde Park High School and enlisted in the United States Army during World War II where he saw eight months of action after arriving in Normandy, France immediately after D-day. After the war, he attended the University of Alabama where he played football for two years. ==Career== Arnie Morton opened his first restaurant, the Walton Walk, between Rush Street and Michigan Avenue in the 1950s. This paved the way for a partnership with Victor Lownes and Hugh Hefner, launching the Playboy Club in 1960. Morton was the right-hand man of Hugh Hefner when he launched the Playboy Empire on February 29, 1960. He served as Executive Vice President of Playboy Enterprises, where he developed the worldwide chain of Playboy Clubs.

In 1958, his parents having died, Morton relocated the restaurant to the newly-opened Shore Drive Motel, at 56th and South Shore Drive. The menu was sophisticated for the era, featuring filet mignon, roast duck, lamb shish kebab flambe, and Caesar salad. In 1978, Morton closed the Hyde Park location to open the first Morton's Steakhouse (see below). In the 1970s, he and Klitsch opened several successful ventures in Chicago\u2018s Newberry Plaza including Arnie's on Chicago's Gold Coast; the seafood restaurant LaMer; and the disco/night club Zorrine's (named after Morton's wife).Los Angeles Times: \"Arnie Morton, 83; He Worked the Room at His 'Steakhouses for the Rich'\" by Myrna Oliver May 31, 2005 In 1978, Morton's of Chicago opened in the basement of Newberry Plaza in Chicago adjacent to the existing Arnie's restaurant.

He got the idea when he went to a similar event in New York in the late 1970s. Thinking that Chicago could do much better, he lined up restaurants to participate and persuaded then Mayor Jane Byrne to block off Michigan Avenue for the first Taste of Chicago on July 4, 1980. A crowd of 100,000 was expected, but more than 250,000 showed up, with food and soda sales grossing $300,000.
