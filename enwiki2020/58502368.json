Accessed at: http://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=717363 on 2018-09-16 All known species are parasitic on the gills of Tonguefish (Family Cynoglossidae). Members of the genus Furcohaptor have a haptor with atypical structure (two long haptoral arms, one pair of typical anchors, one pair of rod-shaped hooks, five pairs of typical-shaped marginal hooks, and one pair of marginal hooks which are reduced in size) and the genus was originally placed in the family Ancyrocephalidae, but a study based on morphology and molecules demonstrated in 2017 that it was a member of the Diplectanidae. ==Species== According to the World Register of Marine Species, the valid species included in the genus are: * Furcohaptor brevis Nitta & Nagasawa, 2017 * Furcohaptor cynoglossi Bijukumar & Kearn, 1996 ==References== Category:Diplectanidae Category:Monogenea genera ",
