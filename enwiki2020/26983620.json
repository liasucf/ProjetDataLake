In the 1910s and 1920s, she played leading soprano parts in Budapest, Vienna, London and on Broadway. According to Richard Traubner, S\u00e1ri Petr\u00e1ss and S\u00e1ri Fed\u00e1k remain \"the two best-remembered Hungarian female operetta stars of all time.\"Traubner, Richard (2003). Operetta: a theatrical history. Routledge. . p. 331. ==Biography== Petr\u00e1ss was born in Ver\u0151ce, Hungary in 1888 and was a niece to Bertha von Suttner, countess Kinsky.Sari Petrass Has Prima Donna Role. The New York Times, August 26, 1916. Petr\u00e1ss debuted in as a lead singer in November 1911 in Le\u00e1nyv\u00e1s\u00e1r along with S\u00e1ri Fed\u00e1k. The show produced at the Kir\u00e1ly Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z (King Theater), Budapest became an international hit as was instantly picked up by Carltheater in Vienna and by the English impresario George Edwardes. In 1912, Edwardes \"imported\" her and most of the original Budapest cast to London.Traubner, Richard (2003). Operetta: a theatrical history. Routledge. . p. 252. Petr\u00e1ss quickly mastered singing in English and performed at the Daly's Theatre in Edwardes's English language version of Franz Leh\u00e1r's Gipsy Love (1912) at Daly's Theatre, which ran 299 performances.Traubner, pp. 238\u2013239, She then performed at Daly's in The Marriage Market (1913) and in a revival of A Waltz Dream (1913), all with Gertie Millar and Robert Michaelis. Petr\u00e1ss was an expert horse rider, and rode a donkey called Jenny in the opening scenes of The Marriage Market. In February 1916, the American media spread a rumour that Petr\u00e1ss had been executed in Budapest as a spy. Allegedly, after the outbreak of World War I she returned from England to Hungary to spy against the Central Powers for the British. The exact origin of the rumour is unknown; later it was confirmed that she indeed returned from England to Vienna and starred there in The Beautiful Unknown by Oscar Straus.\"My Lady's Glove\" Comes from Vienna. The New York Times, June 19, 1917. William Boosey wrote that the London show of The Gipsy Princess with Petr\u00e1ss failed owing to cast selection, despite a \"phenomenal run everywhere\".Boosey, William (1931). Fifty Years of Music. 2008 reprint: Read Books, pg. 166; . In late 1916, she settled in New York City and starred at the New Amsterdam Theatre. The New York Times praised her performance in the September 1916 premiere of Miss Springtime. The show was originally billed as Little Miss Springtime but A.L. Erlanger of New Amsterdam decided against \"anything Little\"\"Sari Petrass Has Prima Donna Role\", New York Times, 26 August 1916, Trautner, pg. 252. by Emmerich K\u00e1lm\u00e1n and Jerome Kern: \"a prima donna new to these shores and destined to be a reigning favorite... in addition to her other talents, she is a clever actress. Miss Petrass is pretty and graceful and her voice, while not large, has a lovely quality and is used with great discretion.\"\"Miss Springtime\" Has Rich Melodies\", New York Times, 26 September 1916. A few days later Alexander Woollcott objected: \"while S\u00e1ri Petr\u00e1ss is an ingratiating and pretty vivacious prima donna, she can scarcely take first rank as a singer.\"Woollcott, Alexander. \"Second Thought on First Nights\", New York Times, 1 October 1916. In March 1917 Petr\u00e1ss married Felix Augustus Eugene Sommerhoff, a broker from Cedarhurst, New York.\"Sari Marries: 'Light Opera Prima Donna Weds Felix A. E. Soerlmerhoff, Broker.

She soon withdrew from Miss Springtime and toured the United States with The Beautiful Unknown. In 1921, Petr\u00e1ss reprised her role in The Gipsy Princess at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London.Traubner, Richard (2003). Operetta: a theatrical history. Routledge, pg. 266; . Petr\u00e1ss and a friend, Lady Horne, were killed in an accident in Antwerp, Belgium on 9 September 1930.\"General Cable News\", Sydney Morning Herald, 11 September 1930.
