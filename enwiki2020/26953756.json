    "text": "Eighty-six or 86 is American English slang used to indicate: that an item is no longer available, traditionally from a food or drinks establishment; or referring to a person or people who are not welcome in the premises. Its origins are unknown but seem to have been coined in the 1920s or 1930s. The term is now more generally used to 'get rid of' someone or something. In the 1970s its meaning expanded to refer to murder. == Etymology and meanings == Chumley's at 86 Bedford Street in the West Village According to the Merriam- Webster Dictionary, 86 means to \"refuse to serve (a customer)\", to \"get rid of\" or \"throw out\" someone or something. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it primarily means \"to eject or debar (a person) from premises; to reject or abandon\". It is often used in food and drink services to indicate that an item is no longer available or that a customer should be ejected. There are many theories about the origin of the term but none are certain. It seems to have originated in the 1920s or 1930s. Possible origins include: * Rhyming slang for nix. * Part of the jargon used by soda jerks. Walter Winchell wrote about this in 1933, in his syndicated On Broadway column. In this, the code 13 meant that a boss was around, 81 was a glass of water and 86 meant \"all out of it\". Professor Harold Bentley of Columbia University studied soda jerk jargon and reported other numeric codes such as 95 for a customer leaving without paying. * Author Jef Klein theorized that the bar Chumley's at 86 Bedford Street in the West Village of Lower Manhattan was the source. His book The History and Stories of the Best Bars of New York claims that the police would call Chumley's bar during prohibition before making a raid and tell the bartender to \"86\" his customers, meaning that they should exit out the 86 Bedford Street door, while the police would come to the Pamela Court entrance. This story is repeated by Sherlock Holmes in the series Elementary. * Another explanation offers that 86th Street stop was the end of the line on the Chicago \"L\" train, and drunks and derelicts who were still on board would have to exit the train. According to Cassell's Dictionary of Slang, the meaning expanded in the U.S. during the 1970s to also mean \u201cto kill, to murder; to execute judicially\u201d. Other slang dictionaries confirm this definition. ==Notable uses== === In entertainment === * The 1947 song \"Boogie Woogie Blue Plate\", by Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five, uses hipster lingo, among which is \"86 on the cherry pie\". * Agent 86 in the 1960s TV show, Get Smart, gets his code number from the term. * David B. Feinberg's first novel, Eighty-sixed (1989), refers to \"the gay community wiped out by AIDS\". It won Feinberg the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Men's Fiction and the American Library Association Gay/Lesbian Award for Fiction. * The song \"86\" (1995) by Green Day is about them being rejected from their punk rock community when they started achieving commercial success. * Dan Fante\u2019s novel, 86'd (2009) is loosely based on his own struggles with alcoholism and substance abuse. * Neon Indian\u2019s comedy crime film, 86'd (2018), takes place at a 24-hour restaurant. === In politics === * In 2005, the grassroots campaign 8664 was started in Louisville, Kentucky to advocate for removing Interstate 64's segment through downtown. * In 2018, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, then-White House Press Secretary under President Donald Trump, was asked to leave the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. This was reported by Brennan Gilmore with a note saying \"86 \u2013 Sara Huckabee Sanders\". * In 2020, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer had a small sign inscribed with \"8645\"\u2014an allusion to the term and the 45th US President (Trump)\u2014in the background during a Meet the Press interview. Representatives of the 2020 Trump presidential campaign interpreted it as encouragement for the assassination of Trump. A spokesperson for Whitmer stated in response, \"The silly season is officially here. It's pretty clear nobody in the Trump campaign has ever worked a food service job.\" Whitmer herself said about the Trump campaign's accusation, \"That was ridiculous. Eighty-six means reject, and I do reject Donald Trump. I reject Donald Trump's rhetoric, I reject Donald Trump's bungled COVID response, and I reject Donald Trump's decisions to pit Americans against Americans.\" ==See also== * Deep Six (disambiguation) * 23 skidoo * List of restaurant terminology ==References== Category:Slang Category:Restaurant terminology Category:Jargon Category:English language ",
