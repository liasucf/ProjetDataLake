    "text": "The Women's Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge () is the women's event of Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge, an annual road bicycle racing event in Wallonia, Belgium, held in late April. The inaugural race, won by Olympic champion Anna van der Breggen, was run on 23 April 2017. With the reboot of the Amstel Gold Race for Women and the creation of a women's Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge in 2017, the women's season has the same trio of Ardennes classics as the men's. Both races are held on Sundays mid-April, in addition to La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne F\u00e9minine, which has been on the women's calendar since 1998. ==Route== The inaugural event started in Bastogne and finished in Li\u00e8ge. At 135.5 km, the race is approximately half the distance of the men's event. Hence, it doesn't start in Li\u00e8ge but in Bastogne, from where it heads north past Li\u00e8ge to finish in Ans. The route features four categorized climbs: the C\u00f4te de la Vecqu\u00e9e, C\u00f4te de La Redoute, C\u00f4te de la Roche aux faucons and C\u00f4te de Saint-Nicolas. The top of the last climb of Saint-Nicolas comes at 5.5 km from the finish. ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccccff;\" !Year !1st !2nd !3rd |- |2017 | Anna van der Breggen Boels\u2013Dolmans | Lizzie Deignan Boels\u2013Dolmans | Katarzyna Niewiadoma WM3 Pro Cycling |- |2018 | Anna van der Breggen Boels\u2013Dolmans | Amanda Spratt Mitchelton-Scott | Annemiek van Vleuten Mitchelton-Scott |- |2019 | Annemiek van Vleuten | Floortje Mackaij | Demi Vollering |- |2020 | Lizzie Deignan Trek-Segafredo | Grace Brown Mitchelton-Scott | Ellen Van Dijk Trek-Segafredo |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:UCI Women's World Tour races Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2017 Category:Cycle races in Belgium Category:2017 establishments in Belgium ",
