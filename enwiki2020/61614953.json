    "text": "Austin Kendall is an American football quarterback for the West Virginia Mountaineers. ==Early years== Kendall attended Cuthbertson High School in Waxhaw, North Carolina. He committed to the University of Oklahoma to play college football. ==College career== === Oklahoma === ==== 2016\u20132018 ==== As a freshman at Oklahoma in 2016, Kendall appeared in two games as a backup to Baker Mayfield, completing 16 of 22 passes for 143 yards with two touchdowns. After redshirting in 2017, Kendall appeared in six games and made one start as the backup to Kyler Murray. For the season, he completed 12 of 17 passes for 122 yards and one touchdown. In 2018, he played in four games where he threw for 122 yards and one touchdown. === West Virginia === ==== 2019 ==== Prior to the 2019 season, Kendall was expected to be a contender for the Sooners' starting quarterback. However, he entered the NCAA transfer portal shortly after Jalen Hurts transferred to Oklahoma. Kendall transferred to West Virginia University before the start of the season as a graduate transfer. Initially, Oklahoma was not willing to grant Kendall immediate eligibility to play at West Virginia, citing an NCAA rule giving them such power if he transferred to another school in the same conference (both Oklahoma and West Virginia are members of the Big 12 Conference). However, after some media backlash, Oklahoma acquiesced and Kendall was granted immediate eligibility with the Mountaineers. In his first year at West Virginia, he was named the starting quarterback. ==References== ==External links== *West Virginia Mountaineers bio Category:Living people Category:People from Waxhaw, North Carolina Category:Players of American football from North Carolina Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Oklahoma Sooners football players Category:West Virginia Mountaineers football players Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
