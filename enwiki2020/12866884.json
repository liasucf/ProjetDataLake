    "text": "\"Rush Rush\" is a song by American singer Debbie Harry. Released as a single in 1983, it is taken from the soundtrack album of the film Scarface (1983). ==Song information== \"Rush Rush\" was the first single Harry released after Blondie broke up in 1982, and was one of the several projects she worked on in between her first and second solo albums. It was Harry's second collaboration with Italian producer Giorgio Moroder, the first being Blondie's 1980 number- one hit \"Call Me\" (from the 1980 movie American Gigolo). The song was a reference to drug use, \"llello\" being a Spanish colloquialism for cocaine. \"Rush Rush\" was released both as a 7\" single and an extended 12\", the A-side of which would later be included on the 1988 Blondie/Debbie Harry remix compilation Once More into the Bleach as well as Harry's 1999 compilation Most of All - The Best of Deborah Harry. A music video was produced, but it was primarily a montage of clips from Harry's past videos including ones from Blondie. \"Rush Rush\" peaked at #105 on the US Billboard chart, but became a moderate US dance hit. The single also peaked at #87 in the UK. The song was also featured in the 2001 video game Grand Theft Auto III on the fictional in- game radio station \"Flashback 95.6\" (Flashback FM) alongside four other songs from the Scarface soundtrack. The song also appears in the 1986 Tom Hanks film The Money Pit. It was also used in the video game Scarface: The World Is Yours.https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scarface-chops- up-80s-mix/1100-6156015/ The song was covered by the British band Happy Mondays for their 2007 album Uncle Dysfunktional, though was not released as a single. The song was also sampled by The Beatnuts for their 2002 song \"Yae Yo\". In 2008 Septimus Orion covered the song on its first studio album Caged.
