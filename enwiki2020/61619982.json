    "text": "The men's 60 kg weightlifting competitions at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London took place on 9 August at the Empress Hall of the Earls Court Exhibition Centre.Official Report, p. 476. The featherweight class, which had been the lightest from their introduction in the 1920 Summer Olympics until the 1936 Summer Olympics, was now the second-lightest, with a bantamweight (56 kg) class split off into a separate competition. Each weightlifter had three attempts at each of the three lifts. The best score for each lift was summed to give a total. The weightlifter could increase the weight between attempts (minimum of 5 kg between first and second attempts, 2.5 kg between second and third attempts) but could not decrease weight. If two or more weightlifters finished with the same total, the competitors' body weights were used as the tie-breaker (lighter athlete wins).Official Report, p. 481. ==Records== Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows. {| class=\"wikitable\" |rowspan=4|World record | Press | | 105 kg | | 1939 |- | Snatch | | 102.5 kg | | 1939 |- | Clean & Jerk | | 131 kg | | 1946 |- | Total | | 300 kg | Paris, France | 18\u201319 October 1946 |- |rowspan=6|Olympic record |rowspan=2| Press | | 92.5 kg | Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28 July 1928 |- | | 92.5 kg | Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28 July 1928 |- |rowspan=2| Snatch | | 90 kg | Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28 July 1928 |- | | 90 kg | Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28 July 1928 |- | Clean & Jerk | | 120 kg | Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28 July 1928 |- | Total | | 287.5 kg | Amsterdam, Netherlands | 28 July 1928 |} ==Results== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !rowspan=2 | Rank !rowspan=2 | Athlete !rowspan=2 | Nation !rowspan=2 | Body weight !colspan=4 | Press (kg) !colspan=4 | Snatch (kg) !colspan=4 | Clean & Jerk (kg) !rowspan=2 | Total |- !1 !2 !3 !Result !1 !2 !3 !Result !1 !2 !3 !Result |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.71 || 85 || 90 || 92.5 || 92.5 || 97.5 || 102.5 || 105 || 105 || 130 || ~~135~~ || 135 || 135 || |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 60.00 || 90 || 97.5 || ~~100~~ || 97.5 || 90 || 95 || 97.5 || 97.5 || 115 || 122.5 || ~~127.5~~ || 122.5 || 317.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.99 || 95 || 100 || ~~102.5~~ || 100 || 90 || 95 || 97.5 || 97.5 || 115 || ~~120~~ || ~~120~~ || 115 || 312.5 |- | ||align=left|Nam Su-il ||align=left| || 59.80 || ~~90~~ || 90 || 92.5 || 92.5 || ~~87.5~~ || 92.5 || ~~95~~ || 92.5 || ~~117.5~~ || 117.5 || 122.5 || 122.5 || 307.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.92 || 97.5 || ~~105~~ || ~~105~~ || 97.5 || 87.5 || ~~92.5~~ || 92.5 || 92.5 || 117.5 || ~~125~~ || ~~125~~ || 117.5 || 307.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 60.00 || 87.5 || ~~92.5~~ || 92.5 || 92.5 || 90 || 95 || ~~97.5~~ || 95 || 120 || ~~127.5~~ || ~~127.5~~ || 120 || 307.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 60.00 || 90 || 95 || ~~97.5~~ || 95 || 90 || ~~95~~ || ~~95~~ || 90 || 115 || ~~120~~ || 120 || 120 || 305 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.68 || 80 || 85 || ~~87.5~~ || 85 || 90 || ~~95~~ || 95 || 95 || 115 || 120 || ~~125~~ || 120 || 300 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.85 || 85 || ~~90~~ || ~~90~~ || 85 || 87.5 || 92.5 || ~~95~~ || 92.5 || 117.5 || 122.5 || ~~125~~ || 122.5 || 300 |- | 10 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.86 || 80 || 85 || 87.5 || 87.5 || 85 || 90 || 92.5 || 92.5 || 115 || ~~120~~ || 120 || 120 || 300 |- | 11 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.65 || 75 || 80 || ~~82.5~~ || 80 || 87.5 || 92.5 || ~~95~~ || 92.5 || 112.5 || ~~120~~ || 120 || 120 || 292.5 |- | 12 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.74 || 80 || 85 || 87.5 || 87.5 || 82.5 || 87.5 || 90 || 90 || ~~115~~ || ~~115~~ || 115 || 115 || 292.5 |- | 13 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.77 || 85 || ~~90~~ || \u2013 || 85 || ~~92.5~~ || ~~92.5~~ || 92.5 || 92.5 || ~~115~~ || 115 || \u2013 || 115 || 292.5 |- | 14 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.90 || 82.5 || ~~87.5~~ || 87.5 || 87.5 || 82.5 || ~~87.5~~ || 87.5 || 87.5 || 110 || 115 || 117.5 || 117.5 || 292.5 |- | 15 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.50 || 82.5 || ~~87.5~~ || ~~87.5~~ || 82.5 || ~~90~~ || 90 || ~~95~~ || 90 || 110 || 115 || 117.5 || 117.5 || 290 |- | 16 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 58.45 || 85 || ~~90~~ || ~~90~~ || 85 || 80 || 85 || ~~87.5~~ || 85 || 110 || ~~115~~ || \u2013 || 110 || 280 |- | 17 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.75 || 82.5 || 87.5 || ~~90~~ || 87.5 || ~~80~~ || ~~80~~ || 80 || 80 || 105 || || 110 || 110 || 277.5 |- | 18 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.46 || 75 || ~~80~~ || ~~80~~ || 75 || ~~85~~ || 85 || ~~95~~ || 85 || ~~115~~ || 115 || ~~125~~ || 115 || 275 |- | 19 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.60 || 75 || ~~80~~ || ~~80~~ || 75 || 85 || ~~90~~ || ~~90~~ || 85 || 110 || 115 || ~~120~~ || 115 || 275 |- | 20 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.50 || ~~87.5~~ || 87.5 || ~~92.5~~ || 87.5 || 80 || ~~85~~ || ~~85~~ || 80 || 105 || ~~110~~ || ~~110~~ || 105 || 272.5 |- | 21 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.45 || 70 || 75 || ~~80~~ || 75 || 75 || 80 || ~~85~~ || 80 || 100 || 105 || ~~110~~ || 105 || 260 |- | 22 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 59.90 || 75 || 80 || ~~82.5~~ || 80 || 75 || ~~80~~ || ~~82.5~~ || 75 || 95 || 100 || ~~105~~ || 100 || 255 |- | 23 ||align=left|Choi Hang-gi ||align=left| || 59.45 || ~~95~~ || ~~95~~ || ~~95~~ || 0 || 85 || ~~90~~ || ~~90~~ || 85 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || 85 |} ==New records== {|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- | Press |100 kg |align=left| |, |- | Snatch |105 kg |align=left| |, |- |Clean & Jerk |135 kg |align=left| |, |- |Total |332.5 kg |align=left| |, |} ==References== Category:Weightlifting at the 1948 Summer Olympics ",
