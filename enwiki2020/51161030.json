    "text": "Tears from a Grieving Heart is the debut studio album by the Australian doom metal band Mournful Congregation. It is regarded as a pioneering release in the funeral doom subgenre. It was originally recorded as a demo but was rereleased as a CD in September 2002 by American record label 20 Buck Spin, with a slightly altered track listing and a bonus track. The band has stated in interviews that it is their first full-length album. It is also the final Mournful Congregation release to be recorded as a duo and the first to feature drummer Adrian Bickle, after the departure of band co-founder Ben Petch the previous year following the \"An Epic Dream of Desire\" demo, although he has writing credits on this record. ==Track listing== ===Original version=== ===CD version=== ==Personnel== ;Mournful Congregation *Damon Good \u2013 Vocals, guitar, bass guitar *Adrian Bickle \u2013 Drums ;Additional personnel *Ben Petch \u2013 songwriting *Anne O'Neill \u2013 cover art *Pat di Palo \u2013 layout *Steve Fieldhouse \u2013 mixing, mastering ==References== Category:Mournful Congregation albums Category:2002 debut albums ",
