However, Hungary was one of seven countries which failed to qualify for the Eurovision final from a pre-qualifying round, so they were not represented in Oslo. ==Before Eurovision== === National final === The national final was organised by broadcaster Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3 (MTV) and was held at their studios in Budapest, hosted by Istv\u00e1n V\u00e1g\u00f3. 14 songs took part with the winner being chosen by voting from five regional juries, who each awarded 10-7-5-3-1 to their top five songs.ESC National Finals database 1996 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\" |+ style=\"font-size: bigger;\" | ! colspan=\"5\" |Final \u2013 24 February 1996 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

The countries occupying the bottom seven places after the pre-qualifier would be unable to take part in the main contest. After the voting, \"Fortuna\" had received 26 points, tying with Finland for the final 22nd qualifying position, however the spot was awarded to Finland because the country attained a higher top score, bringing Hungary's participation in 1996 to a premature end. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Points awarded to Hungary (Pre-qualifying round) |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * |- |} ==See also== *Hungary in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1996 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1996 Category:Hungary in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1996 in Hungary ",
