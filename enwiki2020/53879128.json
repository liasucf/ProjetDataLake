In his review of the Off-Broadway production, Ben Brantley in The New York Times called it a \"smart, silly and often convulsively funny thesis, performed by a motor-mouthed cast that is fluent in many tongues\".\"Review: In \u2018Spamilton,\u2019 Broadway\u2019s Savior Meets His Match. It\u2019s Not Burr.\" The New York Times, September 8, 2016 Frank Scheck, in his review of the Off-Broadway production for The Hollywood Reporter, wrote the musical \"is so infectiously fun that it could easily run as long as its inspiration.\"\"'Spamilton': Theater Review\" The Hollywood Reporter, September 8, 2016 Marilyn Stasio in reviewing the Off-Broadway production in Variety, wrote, \"Like the original show, the pants are tight, the boots are shiny, the bosoms are uplifting and the vests show just enough chest to look manly. Switch-hitting as director/choreographer, Alessandrini assigns his performers signature moves that make each character look authentic, if ever-so-slightly goofy. Getting those physical details right lays the groundwork for the witty character impersonations to come.\"\"Off Broadway Review: \u2018Spamilton,\u2019 The Musical Spoof of \u2018Hamilton\u2019\" Variety, September 8, 2016 Hamilton creator Lin- Manuel Miranda and director Thomas Kail both attended a performance. Miranda praised the parody, saying, \"I laughed my brains out.\" ==Awards== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- ! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year ! style=\"width:20%;\"| Award ! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category ! style=\"width:25%;\"| Nominee ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result |- |rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|2017 |Drama League Awards |Distinguished Performance |Nora Schell | |- |Off-Broadway Alliance Awards |colspan=\"2\"|Best Unique Theatrical Experience | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Drama Desk Award |Outstanding Lyrics |Gerard Alessandrini | |- |Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical |Nora Schell | |- |Outer Critics Circle Awards |colspan=\"2\"|Outstanding New Off-Broadway Musical | |- |Theater Fans' Choice Awards | colspan=\"2\" |Best Off-Broadway Musical | |} ==References== == External links == * Category:Hamilton (musical) Category:Off-Broadway musicals Category:2016 musicals Category:Musical parodies ",
