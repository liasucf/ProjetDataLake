Lebanese men are often described as well-dressed and fashionable, with an affection for cars and nightlife.\"Reinforcing stereotypes about Lebanese men and maybe even creating some\", Michael Karam. The Daily Star (Lebanon). Published 22 November 1997. ===Generosity and friendliness=== The Lebanese are generous when welcoming others into their home or country, especially when it comes to food and drink. Hospitality is prized in Lebanese society, especially on the part of men. It is common for foreigners in Lebanon to be met with friendly greetings and an insistence on paying the bill for a meal. Lebanese people are generally more comfortable with physical contact than is permitted in Western society, and touching the shoulder, arm, or back is common to indicate closeness and friendliness. ===Celebrity=== Lebanese people are also widely perceived as successful people in business and entertainment, with Elie Saab, Bruno Bichir, Carlos Ghosn, Miguel Lay\u00fan, Carlos Slim, M\u00e1rio Zagallo, Nicol\u00e1s Mass\u00fa, and Shakira among the most popular Lebanese-born or from Lebanese descent celebrities. ==Neutral or mixed stereotypes== ===Hastiness=== One stereotype of Lebanese people is their supposed impatience and need to move quickly,\"Cultural Information - Lebanon - Stereotypes\".
