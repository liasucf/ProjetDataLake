Retrieved 20 November 2006. Prior to that, he had recorded a song for the late Sirisena Wimalaweera's Podi Putha. The song didn't make the final cut, as the Indian film composer on the film didn't consider Jothipala's voice good enough. Jothipala has said that he contemplated taking his life when he went with his friends to watch Podi Putha and found out that his song was not included. Later when Surathalee producer Jabir A. Cader wanted to hear one of his songs to consider him for the film, Jothipala almost passed on the offer as he did not possess enough money to create a record. He was helped out by veteran musician Stanley Omar who financed him for the sum of 35 rupees \u2013 a large amount of money at the time. Jothipala's song on the film, \"Siriyame Sara,\" still remains popular in Sri Lanka, having recorded the popular number under the direction of T.R. Papa at Wahini Studio in India. Jothipala has worked with many reputed directors of Sri Lanka. In the early stages of his prolific career, Jothipala got the chance to work with prolific film maker, Lester James Peries on the movie Sandeshaya.
