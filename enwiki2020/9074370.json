    "text": "Road-Sea Southampton was a football club best known for moving directly from playing in amateur league parks to the semi-professional Southern League during their short fourteen-year existence. ==History== Road-Sea were founded in 1973 and were named after their sponsors (a freight shipping company). The club originally played in the City of Southampton Sunday League, where they won every possible honour as they rose up through the divisions. In 1976\u201377 they reached the semi-final of the FA Sunday Cup. Road-Sea then purchased some land at Staplewood, Marchwood, near Southampton and with the aid of some fine financial backing, and momentum from team manager Peter Price saw the facilities develop. This resulted in an ambitious application to join the semi-professional Southern League being sensationally accepted in 1982 despite no history whatsoever of playing Saturday football. Whilst in the Southern League Southern Division, Road-Sea silenced their critics as they pushed for promotion to the Premier Division and after finishing a highly creditable 3rd in their debut season behind champions Fisher Athletic and Folkestone, they won promotion as champions in 1983\u201384. That season, they also enjoyed a fine run in the FA Vase where they reached Round 5 before being eliminated 1-2 away at Leyton Wingate. Road-Sea continued to thrive in the highly competitive Premier Division as they then finished a marvellous 5th in 1984\u201385. The following season was much tougher as the club finished mid-table. In 1986 Road-Sea surprisingly decided to withdraw from the league and become founder members of the new Wessex League (formed that year mostly by the Hampshire League's top clubs with the best facilities). Road-Sea then finished runners- up, reached the final of the Hampshire Senior Cup and won both the League and Russell Cotes Cup's but the club's short but amazing history was ended when they lost their financial backing, which resulted in their sudden demise. The club's home ground, Road-Sea Park was later sold to Southampton who use it to stage Reserve and Youth team games as well as training. ==Honours== *Southern League Southern Division **Champions 1983\u201384 *Wessex League **Runners-up 1986\u201387 *Wessex League Cup **Winners 1986\u201387 *Hampshire FA Senior Cup **Finalists 1986\u201387 *Hampshire FA Russell Cotes Cup **Winners 1986\u201387 ==Playing Records== === League === {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events |- |1982/83||Southern League Southern Division||3/18|| |- |1983/84||Southern League Southern Division||1/20||Champions, Promoted |- |1984/85||Southern League Premier Division||5/20|| |- |1985/86||Southern League Premier Division||16/20||Left competition |- |1986/87||Wessex League ||2/17||Runners- up - left competition |} === FA Cup === {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=text-align:center !Season !Round !Opponents !Result |- |1982/83||Did not enter|| || |- |1983/84||Preliminary Round||H v Oxford City||W 4-1 |- | ||1st Qualifying Round||H v Waterlooville||D 0-0 |- | ||Replay||A v Waterlooville||L 1-2 |- |1984/85||1st Qualifying Round||A v Melksham Town||W 3-0 |- | ||2nd Qualifying Round||A v Chippenham Town||D 2-2 |- | ||Replay||H v Chippenham Town||L 1-2 |- |1985/86||1st Qualifying Round||A v Redditch United||D 1-1 |- | ||Replay||H v Redditch United||W 3-2 |- | ||2nd Qualifying Round||H v Clandown||W 2-1 |- | ||3rd Qualifying Round||A v Ton Pentre||D 1-1 |- | ||Replay||H v Ton Pentre||L 1-2 |- |1986/87||1st Qualifying Round||A v Littlehampton Town||W 7-1 |- | ||2nd Qualifying Round||A v Devizes Town||W 2-0 |- | ||3rd Qualifying Round||H v Fareham Town||L 0-3 |} === FA Trophy === {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=text-align:center !Season !Round !Opponents !Result |- |1984/85||1st Qualifying Round||A v Taunton Town||L 0-2 |- |1985/86||1st Qualifying Round||A v Andover||W 3-0 |- | ||2nd Qualifying Round||H v Bridgend Town||D 1-1 |- | ||Replay||A v Bridgend Town||L 0-3 |} === FA Vase === {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=text-align:center !Season !Round !Opponents !Result |- |1982/83||Did not enter|| || |- |1983/84||Preliminary Round||A v Pagham||W 3-1 |- | ||Round 1||A v Chobham||W 5-0 |- | ||Round 2||H v Maidenhead United||W 4-2 |- | ||Round 3||H v Exmouth Town||W 3-0 |- | ||Round 4||H v Exmouth Town||W 3-0 |- | ||Round 5||A v Leyton Wingate||L 1-2 |- |1986/87||Preliminary Round||A v Warminster Town||W 5-0 |- | ||Round 1||A v Lymington Town||D 1-1 |- | ||Replay||H v Lymington Town||D 1-1 |- | ||Replay||H v Lymington Town||L 0-2 |} ==Famous Players== A number of former professionals played for Road-Sea Southampton during their Southern League days.
