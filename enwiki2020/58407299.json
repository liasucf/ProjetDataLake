    "text": "Fig. 1: some stone crosses in Cornwall Fig. 2: some more stone crosses The hundreds of Cornwall Wayside crosses and Celtic inscribed stones are found in Cornwall in large numbers; the inscribed stones (about 40 in number) are thought to be earlier in date than the crosses and are a product of Celtic Christian society. It is likely that the crosses represent a development from the inscribed stones but nothing is certain about the dating of them. In the late Middle Ages it is likely that their erection was very common. Since they occur in locations of various types, e.g. by the wayside, in churchyards, and in moorlands. Those by roadsides and on moorlands were doubtless intended as rout markings. A few may have served as boundary stones, and others like the wayside shrines found in Catholic European countries. Crosses to which inscriptions have been added must have been memorial stones. According to W. G. V. Balchin \"The crosses are either plain or ornamented, invariably carved in granite, and the great majority are of the wheel-headed Celtic type.\" Their distribution shows a greater concentration in west Cornwall and a gradual diminution further east and further north. In the extreme northeast none are found because it had been settled by West Saxons. The cross in Perran Sands has been dated by Charles Henderson as before 960 AD; that in Morrab Gardens, Penzance, has been dated by R. A. S. Macalister as before 924 AD; and the Doniert Stone is thought to be a memorial to King Dumgarth (died 878).Balchin (1954), pp. 62\u201363 Celtic art is found in Cornwall, often in the form of stone crosses of various types. Cornwall boasts the highest density of traditional 'Celtic crosses' of any nation (some 400). Charles Henderson reported in 1930 that there were 390 ancient crosses and in the next forty years a number of others have come to light.Hardy, Evelyn (1972, April/May) \"Hardy's runic stone?\", in: London Magazine; New series, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 85\u201391; citing Henderson's Cornwall: a Survey (1930), made for the Council for the Protection of Rural England In the 1890s Arthur G. Langdon collected as much information as he could about these crosses (Old Cornish Crosses; Joseph Pollard, Truro, 1896) and one hundred years later Andrew G. Langdon has done a survey in the form of five volumes of Stone Crosses in Cornwall, each volume covering a region (e.g. Mid Cornwall) which the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies has published.1: North Cornwall; 2: Mid Cornwall; 3: East Cornwall; 4: West Penwith; 5: West Cornwall. There are 2nd eds. of nos. 1, 2 and 3. N.B. The two Langdons are unrelated. Similar crosses are also found on Dartmoor in Devon. In modern times many crosses were erected as war memorials and to celebrate events such as the millennium. \"Here is an example of continuity in cultural traits extending over many generations: for we can look beyond the medieval cross to the inscribed stone and even farther back to the prehistoric m\u00eanhir, and yet bring the custom right up-to-date with the twentieth-century war memorial.\"\u2014W.

Langdon holds that place-names starting \"Lan\" indicate the location of a Burial Ground, not a church or monastery (p. 3, section d). The items listed in the book in Constantine are numbered 18 to 29. Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded six Cornish crosses in the parish; in the churchyard, at Bosvathick, at Merthen, at Nanjarrow, at Trevease and at Trewardreva {illustrated Fig. b8).Old crosses 1896 In 1993 a medieval stone cross was found built into a collapsing Cornish hedge at the junction of the road from Constantine to Penryn and the road from Mawnan Smith (illustrated Fig. b9).

The stone is 17 ft 6 in long and there is a local tradition that it marked the site of St Mylor's grave not far from the place where it was found. It is thoughtGuide to the Parish Church of St Mylor to be of pre-Christian origin. It was set up as it is now by sailors from HMS Ganges.Old crosses 1896, pp. 342\u201343Iago, W.

There is also an early cross-slab in the church.Old crosses 1896 An old carved granite stone can be seen approximately south-west of Porkellis Crossroads in the private field on the corner near Bodilly. The stone stands high, with a bas-relief cross on one side and an incised cross on the other. According to local oral history, it was called the \"Wendron God\" and people made the sign of the cross when passing by. Formerly located on a hill between Carilley and Burhos, it was unlawfully removed several times in the 19th century and finally relocated to Bodilly in 1886.Bond, Chris (2007). An Index to the Historical Place Names of Cornwall/ The Cornovia Press ; Vol. 1, p. 82. Arthur Langdon (1896) gave the following account of the Merther Uny crosses: \"The cross stands in situ on the Merther Uny estate, on Polglaze Hill, by the left- hand side of the road from St. Wendron to Constantine. Formerly there was a road leading down to Merther Uny old churchyard, the entrance to which was close to the cross; but all traces of this road have now disappeared. A tradition is still believed in the neighbourhood that a man lies buried beneath the cross. The monolith is known locally as 'Meruny Cross'.\"--\"The cross occupies its original site, near the south side of the entrance to the old churchyard, and stands on a base ...

The five similar stone crosses in Creed parish, including one now at Grampound church, may also have been due to him.The Cornish Church Guide (1925), p. 81 Merther-derwa's will says \"New stone crosses to be put up of the usual kind in those parts of Cornwall from Kayar Reslasek to Camborne church where dead bodies are rested on the way to their burial, that prayers may be made and the bearers take some rest\". As there are no Gothic stone crosses in Camborne or adjacent parishes it is likely that these crosses were set up at Creed instead. In Creed parish there are the remains of four 15th-century crosses, three of which were cut from Pentewan stone. The market cross of Grampound is more ornate than the other three crosses. Fair Cross is a Gothic cross shaft. Nancor Cross has a cross head which was found in the 1920s near Nancor Farm; it was later set on a new shaft and erected beside the A390 road. In 1995 it was broken into four pieces but repaired in 1996. The fourth cross consists only of a cross base at Creed Lane.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 30\u201332 There are two Cornish crosses in the parish of Feock: one is in the churchyard and the other at Trelissick. The cross in the churchyard probably dates from the 13th century (it has a crude crucifixus figure on one side of the head and a foliated cross on the other). The cross at Trelissick was moved from Tredrea in the parish of St Erth in the 1840s; it has a crude crucifixus figure on the front of the head but the back is defaced.Old crosses 1896, pp. 153\u201354 & 277\u201378Stone crosses; mid, p. 38 There is a fine Cornish cross in the churchyard of Gerrans.Old crosses 1896, pp. 263\u201364 According to Andrew Langdon (1994) this cross was not originally a churchyard cross but a wayside cross. No other ancient stone cross exists in the Roseland Peninsula; however a cross called Penpirthe Cross is shown on the parish terrier of 1613 as standing on the boundary of the parishes of Gerrans and Philleigh.Langdon A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 39 Arthur Langdon (1896) describes a Cornish cross in the manor house grounds at Eastbourne, Sussex, which was originally at Kenwyn. Davies Gilbert, a former resident of the manor house removed it from a roadside gate west of Truro where it was in use as a gatepost and had it transported to Eastbourne in 1817. The shaft is ornamented on all four sides.Old crosses 1896, pp. 303\u201307 The churchyard cross at Lamorran is a fine example of a Gothic stone cross.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall.

Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 41 Fig. e2: Sandyway Cross There are four stone crosses in the parish of Lanlivery: Trethew Cross consists of a crosshead which was found in 1900 and a separate base; Trevorry or Sandyway Cross was found in 1936; Menawink Cross is a cross with a mutilated head which was found c. 1990 and erected shortly thereafter on the opposite side of the road; Crewel Cross was first reported in 1870 built into a stile (in 1900 the two separate parts were joined together and erected on a base).Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 50\u201352 Two stone crosses from Lanlivery were removed in the 1840s and turned into monuments: one was taken to Boconnoc and one to St Winnow.Langdon, A. G. (2005) Stone Crosses in East Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 24 & 71 Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded three Cornish crosses and one cross base in the parish of Luxulyan. One cross is in the churchyard (illustrated above right); it was brought there in the 19th century from Three Stiles near Consence. Another cross is at Methrose and the third at Trevellan (lying horizontally and built into a hedge). The cross base is at Trevellan Lane End.Old crosses 1896, pp. 64\u201365, 81\u201382 & 423 Andrew Langdon (1994) does not mention the cross at Methrose. Trevellan Cross was removed from the hedge and erected at Lockengate in 1903; in 1972 it was moved a few yards to the crossroads on the A391.Langdon, A. G.

Great Trelowthas was the site of one of the medieval chapels in the parish, recorded as licensed in 1379. Probus was one of four places in Cornwall having a right of sanctuary which extended beyond the walls of the church, the others being Padstow, St Keverne and St Buryan. The missing Carvossa cross is thought to have marked the eastern limit of sanctuary and it is likely that this cross marked the western limit.Langdon, A. G.

Another cross is in the grounds of a house originally known as Moor Cottage. This house was built in 1819; the cross was brought from Hewas in the parish of Ladock.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 22 The Biscovey Stone, St Blazey, is the shaft of an ancient Celtic cross. It was inscribed, but the text is no longer readable. There are several theories about the stone; one says it dates from around 600 AD to show the Saxon advance into the county, another puts the date at around 900 AD. The head is thought to have been removed during the Reformation. The stone served as a gate post near the St Blazey turnpike gate. In 1896 it was moved to St Mary's Church, Biscovey. Arthur Langdon described the stone in 1896: he read the inscription as \"+ Alroron Ullici + filius\". It was also described by William Borlase in his Antiquities of Cornwall (1754), pp. 363\u201364.Old crosses 1896, pp. 368=72 The churchyard cross of St Dennis has a head of horseshoe shape and is ornamented with some unusual incised ornament.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 33 Fig. e4: St Ewe Cross A roadside Celtic cross once stood near Nunnery Hill, St Ewe (Charles Henderson in 1925 refers to it being at Lanhadron). However, the crosshead and shaft were thrown down in 1873 by a farmer looking for buried treasure, and both pieces were afterwards lost. The base has survived in situ with an inscription in insular script, unreadable except for the word crucem; Elisabeth Okasha dates the construction of this monument between the ninth and eleventh centuries.See the discussion and bibliography in Elisabeth Okasha, Corpus of Early Christian Inscribed Stones of South-west Britain (Leicester: University Press, 1993), pp. 129\u2013132 There is another cross at Corran, about half a mile east of the churchtown.Old crosses 1896, pp. 80\u201381 This cross is also known as Beacon Cross since its site is known as the Beacon. There is a cross at Heligan known as Bokiddick Cross; it came from Bokiddick Farm in the parish of Lanivet which was then owned by the Tremaynes who also owned Heligan. The cross in the churchtown stands on a massive base which is the only original part of it. The stones forming the cross came from elsewhere and nothing is known about the design of the original cross.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed.

The cross head was found at Treneague at the end of the 19th century and afterwards attached to a new shaft and set up in the churchyard. Treneague was the site of a chapel which was licensed in 1381.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 66 Fig. e7: the cross at High Cross At the edge of High Cross near Pydar Street in Truro, there is an ancient Celtic cross. A cross in Truro was mentioned in a document of 1290. In 1958 during excavations in St Nicholas Street the upper section of a stone cross was found and placed next to the museum. In 1981 it was erected outside the Marks and Spencer store. After it had been extended with a piece of Hantergantick granite it was re-erected at High Cross in 1988 and dedicated in 1992. It is likely that the cross originally at High Cross was a Gothic latin cross and that this cross was originally a simple wayside cross.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed.

Arthur Langdon suggested that the shaft had once been ornamented but the ornament had not survived because of the poor quality of the granite.Old crosses 1896, pp. 180\u201382 Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded four Cornish crosses in the parish of St Allen: one at the farm of Lower Town is buried upside down in the ground; the others are defaced crosses at Tolcarn, Trefronick and Trevalsa.Old crosses, pp. 222\u201323 & 217\u201318 Andrew Langdon (1994) also recorded four crosses as well as a font adapted from a Gothic cross base. Three of these crosses (illustrated Fig. f9, f10 & f11) are in the churchyard, of which one was removed from Trefronick Farm in 1911. Andrew Langdon (citing a 1913 paper by William J. Stephens in the Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall) notes that Arthur Langdon had described the same cross twice, as Trevalsa cross and Lower Town cross are the same.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 18\u201321 Fig. f4: A cross in St Columb churchyard There are four Cornish crosses in the parish of St Columb Major: two are in the churchyard (one of these is St Columba's Cross; illustrated Fig. f12), one is at the hamlet of Black Cross and another (defaced) at Black Rock.Old crosses 1896, pp. 206, 219 & 395\u201396Beacham, Peter & Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). Cornwall. New Haven: Yale University Press. ; p. 519 In 1856 the old college buildings next to St Columb church were pulled down and a stone cross from the site was rescued and re-erected near the church door. As of 1896 there were a Cornish cross and four cross bases in the parish of St Columb Minor: the cross was at Cross Close and is unusual in being almost circular in section. This cross, known as Double Stiles or Three Stiles Cross (illustrated, Fig. f13) was moved to a new position when a housing estate was built in 1954. A cross formerly at Lavethan, Blisland, was sold in 1991 and set up in a cottage garden in Newquay.Old crosses 1896, pp. 39\u201340Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed.

It was set up in the churchyard in 1879 but moved to a different position in the churchyard in 1893.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 34 Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded two Cornish crosses in the parish of St Mawgan: one, a small cross, is at Mawgan Cross and the other at Lanherne. The Lanherne cross is a highly ornamented example and stands in the grounds of the nunnery having been brought from Roseworthy in the parish of Gwinear. \"It is the most beautiful specimen of an elaborately decorated cross in Cornwall.\"Old crosses 1896, pp. 211 & 357\u201359 Andrew Langdon (1994) records four crosses. These are the Lanherne cross, the churchyard cross, Bodrean Cross and Mawgan Cross. The churchyard cross is the best preserved medieval lantern cross in Cornwall. Bodrean Cross (a cross head and small part of the shaft) was found in 1904 at Bodrean Farm in the parish of St Clement. In 1906 the cross head was provided with a new shaft and set up in St Mawgan churchyard.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 55\u201357 The mutilated head of a medieval lantern cross was found buried in the churchyard of St Newlyn East in 1959. William Borlase left a description of a lantern cross he had seen at Treledra (Treluddra) Farm; it is probable that these two crosses are the same.Langdon, A. G.
