    "text": "The Australian Banking Association (ABA), formerly the Australian Bankers' Association, is the trade association for the Australian banking industry. With its forebears going back to the late 1940s, the ABA was founded in 1985 and is based in Sydney, New South Wales. The ABA represents twenty two banks and also has associate members. It provides analysis, advice and advocacy for the banking industry and contributes to the development of public policy on banking and other financial services. The ABA 's stated goal is to advocate for a strong, competitive and innovative banking industry that delivers excellent and equitable outcomes for customers, and promote and encourage policies that improve banking services for all Australians, through advocacy, research, policy expertise and thought leadership. In 2020, under CEO Anna Bligh, the ABA's public profile has risen due to the industry's proactive response to Australia's 'Black Summer' fires, and collective measures to help cushion the economic impact of the corona virus pandemic. ==Leadership== ===Chairmen=== The following served as Chairman of the Association: {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"auto\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !
