Despite stating that his childhood passion was football, he started his career playing field hockey for Lomas Athletic Club. He quit his playing career in 1979, while at San Mart\u00edn, following the death of his father. In 1976, aged only 16, Holan took over Lomas' women's B-team, remaining in charge for three years before moving to Club Alem\u00e1n. After eight years, he was appointed coach of Olivos' women team, being in charge for three seasons. In 1990, Holan was Gustavo Paolucci's assistant at the Argentina women's national team for the year's World Cup. After the end of the tournament, he returned to Lomas, now as coach of the women's main squad. Holan subsequently worked with Banfield, San Fernando and Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires before taking over Uruguay women's national team in 2003. At the 2003 Pan American Games held in Santo Domingo, his side won the Bronze medal after losing the semifinals to champions Argentina. ==Football career== In 2003, after attending soccer clinics in Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, Holan was appointed Jorge Burruchaga's assistant at Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed. He continued to work with Burrruchaga in the following years, at Estudiantes, Independiente, Banfield and back at Arsenal. In 2011, Holan took over Argentinos Juniors' youth categories. On 26 June 2011, he was named Mat\u00edas Almeyda's assistant at River Plate, and was a part of the club's staff during the promotion back to the top tier. He also worked as Almeyda's assistant at Banfield. On 11 June 2015, Holan was named Defensa y Justicia manager, replacing Jos\u00e9 Oscar Flores. Earning plaudits for the team's performances, he led the club to a Copa Sudamericana qualification (the club's first ever international tournament), but resigned on 14 November 2016. On 29 December 2016, Holan was appointed manager of Independiente, in the place of fired Gabriel Milito. Roughly one year later, he lifted the 2017 Copa Sudamericana after defeating Flamengo at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. On 20 December 2017, Holan announced that he would not renew his contract with Independiente, which was due to expire in the end of the year. Three days later, however, he signed a new contract until the end of 2018. On 27 June 2018, Holan extended his contract with Independiente until 2021. The following 10 July, however, he left the club on a mutual agreement. On 16 December 2019, Ariel Holan signed his 2-years contract with CD Universidad Catolica of Chile, current Chilean Champion of Primera Division de Chile ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"8\"|Record !rowspan=2| |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |-align=center |align=center|Defensa y Justicia | |align=center|11 June 2015 |align=center|14 November 2016 | |-align=center |align=center|Independiente | |align=center|29 December 2016 |align=center|30 June 2019 | |-align=center |align=center|Universidad Cat\u00f3lica | |align=center|16 December 2019 |align=center|Present | |-align=center !colspan=\"4\"|Total !\u2014 |} == Statistics detailed by team and tenure== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #F9F9F9; font-size: 95%; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; clear:center\" border=\"1\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"2\" |-align=center ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"30px\"|Club ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"30px\" |Div. ! rowspan=\"2\" |Torn. ! colspan=\"8\" |Statistics |- style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" ! width=\"30px\" |G ! width=\"30px\" |W ! width=\"30px\" | D ! width=\"30px\" |L ! width=\"30px\" | GF ! width=\"30px\" |GA ! width=\"30px\" |GD ! width=\"30px\" |Win% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" | rowspan=\"6\" |Defensa y Justicia | rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"center\" |1.\u00aa |2015 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |15||6||3||6||13||10||+3 |46% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |2014\u201315 Copa Argentina |3||1||1||1||3||3||0 |44% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |2016 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |16||7||4||5||25||16||+9 |52% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |2015\u201316 Copa Argentina |3||2||0||1||4||2||+2 |66% |- style=\"text- align: center;\" |2016\u201317 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |10||1||5||4||6||11||-5 |26% |- style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Total!! 47 !! 17 !! 13 !! 17 !! 51 !! 42 !! +9 !45% |- |- style=\"text-align: center;\" | rowspan=\"12\" |Independiente | rowspan=\"11\" valign=\"center\" |1.\u00aa |2016\u201317 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |15||7||3||5||16||11||+15 |53% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |Sudamericana 2017 |12||8||2||2||21||9||+12 |72% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |2016\u201317 Copa Argentina |2||0||1||1||1||2||-1 |16% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |2017\u201318 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |27||13||7||7||29||19|| +10 |57% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |Recopa 2018 |2||0||2||0||1||1||0||33% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |2017\u201318 Copa Argentina |2||1||1||0||11||2||+9 |67% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |Libertadores 2018 |10||3||3||4||10||8||+2 |40% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |2018 Suruga Bank Championship |1||1||0||0||1||0||+1 |100% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |2018\u201319 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |25||10||8||7||35||28|| +7 |49% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |2019 Copa de la Superliga |2||0||1||1||3||4||-1 |17% |- style=\"text- align: center;\" |2019 Copa Sudamericana |4||3||0||1||10||5||+5 |75% |- style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Total!!103!!47!!33!!23!!138!!89!!+49 !% |-align=center |rowspan=\"7\" align=center valign=\"center\"|Universidad Cat\u00f3lica | rowspan=\"6\" valign=\"center\" |1.\u00aa |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |Campeonato AFP PlanVital 2020 |14||10||3||1||32||12||+20 |% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |Supercopa 2020 |0||0||0||0||0||0||+0 |0% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |Copa Chile 2019-20 |1||0||1||0||1||1||0 |0% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |Copa Chile 2020 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |0% |- style=\"text-align: center;\" |Libertadores 2020 |5||1||1||3||4||8||-4 |% |- style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Total!! 20 !! 11 !! 5 !! 4 !! 37 !! 21 !! +16 !! % |- |- style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" ! colspan=\"3\" |Total in his Teams!! 170 !! 75 !! 50 !! 45 !! 226 !! 152 !! +74 !% |} Updated up to 10 October 2020 ==Honours== ===Manager=== ;Independiente *Copa Sudamericana: 2017 *Suruga Bank Championship: 2018 ==References== ==External links== * Football World Rankings profile * * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine football managers Category:Argentine people of Czech descent Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n managers Category:Defensa y Justicia managers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente managers Category:Club Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica managers Category:Argentine expatriate football managers Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Chile Category:Expatriate football managers in Chile ",
