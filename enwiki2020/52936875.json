The church is part of the H\u00e6geland parish in the Otredal deanery in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden, octagonal church was built in 1830. The church seats about 250 people. ==History== The previous church was built sometime during the Middle Ages, likely before 1525. It was about long and wide. The old church was in poor condition and in 1824, discussions began about replacing the old church. In 1826, it was decided that they would build an octagonal church. In 1828, the nearby Hornnes Church was completed and it was used as a model for planning for a new church in H\u00e6geland. The old church was torn down in May 1829 and a new church was built on the same site, reusing some of the old timbers in the new building. ==Media gallery== Haegeland kirke2 crop.jpg|View of the church front Vennesla, H\u00e6geland 02.JPG|View of the church in the village Vennesla, H\u00e6geland kirke fra syd 01.JPG|Side view of the church ==See also== *List of churches in Vest-Agder ==References== Category:Churches in Agder Category:Vennesla Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings ",
