She spent her childhood living in central Delhi. She currently lives in Delhi with her parents. She wrote her first novel Almost Single from the idea that germinated as a result of some of the experiences that surrounded her. She said: \"The rapid way in which the concepts of love and courtship are evolving and continue to do so. Also the fact that the \"hunt\" was not necessarily the fiefdom of the male of the species.\" Almost Single was a runaway bestseller and called \"Bridget Jones in a saree\" by the UK's Independent newspaper. She quit the job of a hotel executive to write her next novel Almost There!, which was a sequel to her previous novel. Director Siddharth Anand had approached Kala to develop the story of two suicidal strangers who fall in love into a feature-length script. Although a bit hesitant initially as she had not written a screenplay before, she accepted the offer. Intrigued by the premise of the story, Kala started sketching the characters over the next few days and began writing the script, which she found was different from writing novels. Anand helped her in understanding the process of writing screenplays and co-wrote with her. Kala wrote the first draft, approaching it like writing a book, and sent it as chapters to Anand, saying: \"Writing a screenplay can also be a lonely process like writing a novel, but along the way when others get involved, it becomes a fun collaborative effort.\" The film starring Priyanka Chopra and Ranbir Kapoor, proved to be a commercial success. Sujoy Ghosh approached Kala with the idea for Kahaani, starring Vidya Balan. Kala took inspiration from her experience in Kolkata, where she had moved in 1999, akin to the protagonist in the film. She reported that despite facing a language barrier and the chaos and poverty of the metropolis, she was charmed by the warmth of the people, which was reflected in the film. Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010. Her research included reading the books Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled by Maloy Krishna Dhar and India's External Intelligence: Secrets of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) by V. K. Singh. Made on a budget of , Kahaani grossed over worldwide after a 50-day theatrical run. The film proved to be a critical success as well and garnered several awards and nominations.
