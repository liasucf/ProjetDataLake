By understanding and adapting to local conditions, he has achieved a remarkable degree of architectural innovation. As part of the process, villagers are involved and thus empowered in the improvement of their environment. Mr Hoang goes beyond building sustainability in that he also addresses cultural sustainability in his works, an aspect often neglected in developing economies.\" Hao's work focuses on supporting neglected communities by diverse projects, such as community houses, workers\u2019 houses, schools for disadvantaged children, children's playground systems and so on.
