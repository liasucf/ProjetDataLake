    "text": "Antigraviator is an anti-gravity racing video game developed by Cybernetic Walrus and published by Iceberg Interactive in 2018 for Windows PC. == Premise == Antigraviator's setting is described as a near future where racing has gotten very popular due to scientific breakthroughs in anti-gravity and terraforming. As a result of these breakthroughs, the antigraviator tournament was born. The anti-gravity ships used in this tournament are called 'Gravs'. == Gameplay == Antigraviator is an anti-gravity racing game in the vein of Wipeout and F-Zero, to which the game has been compared. The game has a single-player mode and a multiplayer mode that supports up to eight players. The game features no speed limit, as a result the game says to be the fastest game ever made. == Development == Antigraviator was expected to release in Q2 2018 for Windows PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game developer is Belgian indie studio Cybernetic Walrus. Cybernetic Walrus is composed of alumni of Howest University in Belgium. The game is made using the Unity engine. The game was announced to receive a Kickstarter campaign in April 2017. Subsequently, the game failed to receive funding. After the Kickstarter campaign, Dutch publisher Iceberg Interactive signed the game for a Q2 2018 multi-platform release. The game is set to be localized in English, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Simplified Chinese. Antigraviator was developed using the Unity engine, which Unity Technologies has taken notice of. The game was selected for exhibiting at the Unite Austin 2017 Made with Unity showcase, where \u201cunique games of varying styles, genres, mechanics, and platforms\u201d where chosen to exhibit. Cybernetic Walrus' CEO Mike Coeck and Environment Artist Szabolcs Csizmadia was invited as a speaker to Unite Austin 2017. They gave a lecture on how the Cybernetic Walrus team used Unity 2017 to develop Antigraviator. In addition, assets from the game were used in the Unite Austin training day, where attendees learned to create an anti-gravity racing game of their own using Antigraviator's assets. The training series was later released through YouTube. == Reception == According to CBS Interactive's review aggregator Metacritic, the game received \"mixed or average reviews\", average rating is 65/100. == References == == External links == * * Iceberg Interactive Official Website Category:2018 video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in Belgium Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Iceberg Interactive games Category:Futuristic racing games ",
