SNV is also a part of the International Sea Cadet Association through the SSCC. ==Swedish Sea Cadet Corps== Rowing Exercise of the Aspirant School Finnhamn 1942.

The Swedish Auxiliary Naval Corps run summer schools for young people aged 15\u201319 years. On the three-week-long summer schools, cadets are taught about seamanship, navigation, first aid, sailing, military demeanour, military history, defence knowledge, friendship, and everything else a navy man or woman is expected to be. In their first summer cadets go on the Basic Course (Grundkurs), in their second summer cadets go on the Advanced Course (Forts\u00e4ttningskurs) that provides advanced sailing skills, and in their third summer cadets go on the Internship Course (Praktikkurs), which provides practical knowledge in operating and working on larger vessels. There is also the possibility in their fourth summer for cadets to attend the Leadership Course (Ledarkurs) which trains Cadets to act as assistant instructors, who can then teach younger students. During the winter cadets have the chance to improve their knowledge of what they have learned during the summer courses. Emphasis is placed on navigation, and cadets are expected to have passed the Inshore Yachtmaster Diploma and Coastal Yachtmaster Diploma before they have completed their three years. In the summer months as well as attending the summer schools Cadets have the opportunity to sail with the SNV fleet schooners HSwMS Gladan or HSwMS Falken and participate in exchanges under the International Sea Cadet Association (ISCA). ==Local units== * Blekinge Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5ren Stockholm * Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5rsdivision Syd * Gotlands Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * G\u00e4vleborgs Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * G\u00f6teborgs Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * Kalmarsunds Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * Nordv\u00e4stra Sk\u00e5nes Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * Norra Sm\u00e5lands Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * Norrbottens Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * Roslagens Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * Syd\u00f6stra Sk\u00e5nes Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * S\u00f6dermanlands Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * S\u00f6dert\u00f6rns Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * V\u00e4sternorrlands Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * \u00d6resunds Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r * \u00d6sterg\u00f6tlands Sj\u00f6v\u00e4rnsk\u00e5r == See also == *Home Guard *Swedish Voluntary Flying Corps *Swedish Voluntary Radio Organization ==Footnotes== ==References== == References == * Category:Swedish Navy Category:Volunteer organizations in Sweden Category:Naval Cadet organisations Category:Swedish military youth groups ",
