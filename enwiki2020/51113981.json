    "text": "Carlos Torres (1 April 1908 - deceased) is a former Portuguese footballer who played as a forward. Torres started at CD Torres Novas, moving to Benfica in 1933, where he spent four years, scoring 34 goals in 60 matches, winning the Primeira Liga and the Campeonato de Portugal. ==Career== Born in Torres Novas, Torres played football for various clubs in his home-town, eventually settling at CD Torres Novas, where he spent seven seasons. In 1933, he moved to Benfica, making his debut on 25 February 1934, against Belenenses. He competed with Rog\u00e9rio and V\u00edtor Silva, but was still the team top scorer, bagging seven goals in seven appearances. The following season, Benfica signed Valadas, which brought more competition to him. Nonetheless, he scored 16 and helped the club win the Campeonato de Portugal on 30 June 1935, against Sporting. In 1935\u201336, Torres scored 9 in the Primeira Liga and helped Benfica win their first league title. With the breakthrough of Esp\u00edrito Santos in 1936\u201337, his influence was significantly reduced and he did not play in the league, thus not winning his second league title. He left the club with 34 goals in 60 matches, winning two major honours. ==Honours== Benfica *Primeira Divis\u00e3o: 1935\u201336 *Campeonato de Portugal: 1934\u201335 ==Personal life== He is the uncle of Jos\u00e9 Augusto Torres, who also played for Benfica from 1959 to 1971. ==References== General * Specific Category:1908 births Category:People from Torres Novas Category:Year of death unknown Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Primeira Liga players Category:S.L.
