    "text": "The Bloomingdale Regional Library was originally designed to lessen patron usage at the Brandon Regional Library, which was the busiest library in the Hillsborough County System, at the beginning of the 21st century. In the early stages of development, the Bloomingdale Library was often referred to as the South Brandon Library because it was expected to serve people in the FishHawk, Bloomingdale, Valrico, and Lithia areas. Though there were several discussed sites for the creation of the library, the Hillsborough County Commissioners narrowed down their selection to two locations. One of the locations was across the street from Lithia Springs Elementary School on Lithia Pinecrest Road, while the other locality was next to Bloomingdale High School on Bloomingdale Avenue.Hathaway, Ivan J.

Retrieved from http://cdm16054.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15391coll2/id/5452/rec/52 Though there were concerns regarding possible traffic congestion on Bloomingdale Avenue, the Commissioners ultimately decided to accept the latter option.Hathaway, Ivan J. (2001, July 22). Library site ideas focus of meeting. The Tampa Tribune, p. 1 and 3.

Plans for new public library under way. The Tampa Tribune. Retrieved from http://cdm16054.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15391coll2/id/2795/rec/14). Proposed blue prints for the library allowed for 15,000 square-feet with the possibility of adding an additional 10,000 at a later date. The space included a 3,770 square-foot reading room, a 1,150 square-foot children's room, and a 940 square-foot community collaboration room. Additional space was dedicated to meeting rooms and reading areas. With a holding of 53,000 books upon its day of opening, as well as the purchasing of thirty-five internet-accessible computers and the inclusion of free WI-fi, the Bloomingdale Library totaled in cost of $4.5 million.Frazier, Laura.

Retrieved from http://cdm16054.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15391coll2/id/2792/rec/7 The library had a soft opening on February 7, 2005 and it officially started service on February 10.White, D'Ann.

Retrieved from http://cdm16054.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15391coll2/id/2708/rec/6 Within a few months of opening, the Bloomingdale Library became a new home for the Greater Brandon Genealogy Society. The library specifically dedicated a genealogical research room with five computers that were directly linked to the John F. Germany's genealogical websites. In return for the genealogical center, the Greater Brandon Genealogy society offered to provide free tutoring for anyone interested in uncovering his or her family background. The genealogical center at Bloomingdale was the second in the county, with the John F. Germany acting as the only other center at the time of the former's creation.White, D'Ann. (2005, May 4).

Retrieved from http://cdm16054.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15391coll2/id/2749/rec/9 The Bloomingdale Library was expanded by an additional 10,000 square-feet in 2013, thereby making it a regional library. This additional space was geared towards creating a larger children's room, community rooms, seating for studying, a larger Friends of the Library Book Store, and more area for technology and teen activities.Hillsborough County Communications.

A new vending cafe for patrons was also part of the $2.1 million expansion.Hammett, Yvette C. (2012, December 12). Local libraries get more space to read, park. The Tampa Tribune. p. 10 and 12. Retrieved from http://cdm16054.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15391coll2/id/5423/rec/41 In the year before the expansion, the library circulated over 660,000 books and other multimedia. The library also took advantage of federal funding to purchase an electric charging station for electric cars. Cooking Oil Recycling Station: To support the recycling of cooking oil, the library has partnered with Hillsborough County Public Utilities and the C.O.R.E. program. All cooking oils can cause problems in home plumbing and the sewage collection system. Cooking oil recycling stations are available at some library locations countywide. Friends of the Library The Friends of the Bloomingdale Regional Library group is made up of citizens who support the library by raising money for special events and programs. One such event is the Friend\u2019s annual Book Sale. One such special program is the award-winning Life Story Writing Workshop. The Friends operate their Book Ends Bookstore, located in the library's lobby. Bloomingdale Regional Library.
