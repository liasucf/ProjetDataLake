    "text": "The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery is an album by American jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Most of its tracks exemplify two of Montgomery's distinguishing techniques: \"thumb picking\" and the use of octaves. In 2017, the album was selected for the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\" What made Wes Montgomery a legend-Inside The National Recording Registry-WNYC == Reception == The album is considered by many fans and critics to be the pinnacle of Montgomery's recorded studio work. The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested \"Core Collection\", calling it \"probably the best Montgomery record currently available\". Writing for Allmusic, music critic Michael G. Nastos praised the album, writing: \"Setting him apart from the rest, this recording established Montgomery as the most formidable modern guitarist of the era, and eventually its most influential...Montgomery is clearly talented beyond convention, consistently brilliant, and indeed incredible in the company of his sidemen, and this recording\u2014an essential addition to every jazz guitarist fan's collection\u2014put him on the map.\" Of the 1987 CD reissue, critic Chris May of All About Jazz wrote: \"The Incredible Jazz Guitar burst onto the US scene in 1960 like a benign hurricane, and it still sounds like a gale almost 50 years later... Montgomery\u2014empathetically accompanied by pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Percy Heath (then riding high with the Modern Jazz Quartet), and drummer Albert Heath\u2014makes the guitar sound like it never had before. It has sounded similar since, of course, thanks to the legion of Montgomery-influenced players, but rarely so close to perfection.... The Incredible Jazz Guitar endures, and will continue to do so.\" ==Track listing== #\"Airegin\" (Sonny Rollins) \u2013 4:26 #\"D-Natural Blues\" (Wes Montgomery) \u2013 5:23 #\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams\" (Jimmy Van Heusen, Johnny Burke) \u2013 4:44 #\"Four on Six\" (Montgomery) \u2013 6:15 #\"West Coast Blues\" (Montgomery, Granville Sascha Burland) \u2013 7:26 #\"In Your Own Sweet Way\" (Dave Brubeck) \u2013 4:53 #\"Mr. Walker (Renie)\" (Montgomery) \u2013 4:33 #\"Gone With the Wind\" (Allie Wrubel, Herb Magidson) \u2013 6:24 *Tracks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 recorded at Reeves Sound Studios, NYC, January 26, 1960 *Tracks 3, 7, and 8 recorded at Reeves Sound Studios, NYC, January 28, 1960 Riverside RLP 12-320, RLP 1169; Fantasy OJC 036, OJCCD 036-2 ==Personnel== * Wes Montgomery \u2013 electric guitar * Tommy Flanagan \u2013 piano * Percy Heath \u2013 bass * Albert Heath \u2013 drums Production notes: * Orrin Keepnews \u2013 producer * Jack Higgins \u2013 engineer ==References== Category:Wes Montgomery albums Category:1960 albums Category:Albums produced by Orrin Keepnews Category:Riverside Records albums Category:Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Category:Original Jazz Classics albums Category:United States National Recording Registry recordings ",
