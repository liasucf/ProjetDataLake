The Caudron G.4 was a French biplane with twin engines, widely used during World War I as a bomber. It was designed by Ren\u00e9 and Gaston Caudron as an improvement over their single-engined Caudron G.3. The aircraft employed wing warping for banking. The first G.4 was built in 1915, and it was manufactured in France, England and Italy. It was the world's first twin engines aircraft to be widely used from march 1915. The Caudron G.4 was used as a reconnaissance bomber against the German Empire. Later, when Germany developed a fighter force, the aircraft was used for night bombing. The G.4 was in use in Belgium, France, Finland, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. ==Development== While the Caudron G.3 was a reliable reconnaissance aircraft, it could not carry a useful bombload, and owing to its design, was difficult to fit with useful defensive armament. In order to solve these problems, the Caudron G4 was designed as a twin engined development of the G.3, first flying in March 1915. While the G.4 had a similar pod and boom layout to the G.3, it has two Le Rh\u00f4ne rotary or Anzani 10 radial engines mounted on struts between the wings instead of a single similar engine at the front of the crew nacelle, while wingspan was increased and the tailplane had four rudders instead of two. This allowed an observer/gunner position to be fitted in the nose of the nacelle, while the additional power allowed it to carry a bombload of 100 kg. The G.4 was one of the few twin engines aircraft to be able to fly with one engine stopped. With two engines and a large wing aera, the G.4 was enough powered to breake altitude records. On may 1915, the French aviator Etienne Poulet broke the altitude record with 3 passengers, reaching the altitude of 5.850m (19.226ft). In Italia, on the 9th november 1916, the Italian aviator Guido Guidi set a world absolute altitude record reaching the altitude of 26.083ft (7.950m). A total of 1358 G.4s were produced in France, while a further 51 examples produced by the A.E.R. company in Italy and 12 were built in Britain by the British Caudron company. ==Operational history== ===World War I=== The G.4 entered service with the French A\u00e9ronautique Militaire in November 1915. It was the first twin engined aircraft in service in any numbers with the French. The Caudron G.4 was used to carry out bombing raids deep behind the front line, being used to attack targets as far away as the Rhineland. Increasing losses led to its withdrawal from day bombing missions by the French in the autumn of 1916. The British Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) also used the G.4 as a bomber, receiving 55, of which twelve were licence built by the British Caudron company and the remainder supplied from France. Number 4 and 5 Wing RNAS using the G.4 for attacks against German seaplane and airship bases in Belgium. It was finally replaced in RNAS service by Handley Page O/100 aircraft in the autumn of 1917. Italian G.4s proved successful in operating in the mountainous Alpine fronts, where its good altitude capabilities proved useful. The G.4 was also used by the Imperial Russian Air Force for reconnaissance purposes. ===Use in Finland=== The Finnish Air Force purchased one G.4 as well as two G.3s aircraft with spares, from Flyg Aktiebolaget on 26 April 1923 for 100,000 Finnish markka. The G.4 was used by the FAF as an ambulance aircraft in 1923. ==Variants== The first G.4 prototype flew in March 1915. The G.4 was manufactured in three main versions, A.2 for reconnaissance, B.2 for bombing and E.2 for training. The A.2 was equipped with a radio for fire spotting, B.2 could carry of bombs and the E.2 was equipped with dual controls. G.4IB (French: Blindage) was an armoured version. There were also other bomber and escort aircraft versions. The Japanese Army received an unknown number of Caudron G.4s, which it designated \u620a 1 (Bo 1). The Caudron G.6 was a further developed G.4, with a conventional fuselage and tail replacing the pod and boom arrangement of the G.3. ==Operators== ;: *Belgian Air Force ;:Colombian Air Force ;:Aeronautique Militaire ;:Finnish Air Force ;:Corpo Aeronautico Militare ;:Portuguese Military Aeronautical Service ;:Royal Romanian Air Force ;:Imperial Russian Air Service ;:Soviet Air Force - Taken over from the Imperial Russian Air Force. ;:Royal Naval Air Service ; *American Expeditionary Force *United States Army Air Service ; *Venezuelan Air Force *Venezuelan Navy ==Survivors== Two Caudron G.4s are displayed in national museums.

A third Caudron G.4 is known to be under restoration in France on a private collection. ==Specifications (G.4)== Caudron G.4 drawing ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * ==External links== * Caudron G.4 (Smithsonian Museum) * Caudron Brothers Category:1910s French bomber aircraft G.4 Category:Biplanes Category:Rotary-engined aircraft ",
