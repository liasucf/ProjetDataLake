Not to long after, Kupriyanov was awarded the rank of Major general. After the liberation of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic in 1944, a few members of the command of the Karelian Front (including General Terenty Shytkov) proposed to deport the indigenous population of the Karelo-Finnish SSR to Siberia and the Kazakh SSR and liquidate the republic. However the mass deportation of the Karelo- Finnish did not happen. Some historians credit Kupriyanov for preventing the mass deportation. He joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1926, but worked as a social science teacher at Solgalich Secondary School from 1927 to 1929.

He served as the First Secretary of the Kuybyshevsky District Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1938 in Leningrad. Kupriyanov was elected as the First Secretary of the Karelian Regional Committee of the Communist Party in June 1938 on the recommendation of Andrei Zhdanov to Stalin. As a regional committee's First Secretary, Kupriyanov became part of the NKVD troika in September 1938. During the Winter War, he ordered the construction of the 132 kilometer-long Petrozavodsk- Shuezersk railway; the railway was built in 46 days.

He was imprisoned in Lefortovo Prison two days later. In October 1950, the investigation regarding Kupriyanov was finished and he was sentenced to capital punishment.
