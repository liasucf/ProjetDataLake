CBS was the last of the three U.S. major television networks to schedule a regular prime-time array of movies. Unlike its two competitors (NBC and ABC), CBS had delayed running feature films at the behest of the network's hierarchy.Edgerton, Gary T. The Columbia History of American Television. New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2007. p. 250. Indeed, as far back as 1960, when Paramount Pictures offered a huge backlog of pre-1948 titles for sale to television for $50 million,Segrave, Kerry. Movies at Home: How Hollywood Came to Television. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 1999. p. 75. James T. Aubrey, program director at CBS, negotiated with the studio to buy the package for the network. Aubrey summed up his thinking this way: \"I decided that the feature film was the thing for TV. A $250,000 specially-tailored television show just could not compete with a film that cost three or four million dollars.\"Cited in Oulihan, Richard and William Lambert. \"The Tyrant's Fall That Rocked the TV World\". Life (magazine). Vol. 59, No. 11. (Sept. 10, 1965): p. 94. However, the network's chairman, William Paley, who considered the scheduling of old movies \"uncreative\", vetoed the Paramount transaction. It was not until after Aubrey's departure from CBS in early 1965 that Paley finally conceded on the issue and cleared the way for the network to embark on its own prime-time weekly movie broadcast.Cited in Oulihan, Richard and William Lambert. \"The Tyrant's Fall That Rocked the TV World,\" etc. After completing negotiations with various studios that year, the network acquired exclusive rights to televise a total of 90 titles from Columbia Pictures, United Artists, Paramount, and Warner Brothers\u2014news of which resulted in rumors that the network would actually slate films for two prime-time nights rather than just one.Adams, Val. \"CBS May Offer 2 'Movie Nights': $8 Million Deal Suggests Plan for 2d Series in '66.\" New York Times. (August 27, 1965): p. 59. This scheduling addition, however, would not be made until a season later; but reports of further meetings between CBS and Columbia over the acquisition of 20 more titles signaled that the network was now a serious movie-night contender.\"A.B.C. and M-G-M Close 21-Film Deal.\" New York Times. (August 23, 1965): p. 51. The Thursday Night Movie thus began on September 16, 1965, with the TV debut of the original The Manchurian Candidate (1962), starring Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey. == Controversy == left CBS's new anthology was not to escape notoriety, as the network learned the evening of September 30. During its running of the Jack Lemmon-Kim Novak comedy, The Notorious Landlady, someone at the controls of the film's broadcast inadvertently got the reels mixed up, and it was with some chagrin that a network announcer issued an apology during a commercial break before a substantial portion of the movie was then replayed just to get the continuity back on track. What started out, therefore, as a 2-hour-and-15-minute airing wound up lasting approximately three hours.Erickson, Hal. \"Movies on Network TV: 1961 Onward (Part 3).\" Radio Discussions.. See also Trivia for The Notorious Landlady at the Internet Movie Database. Then a month later, when the Burt Lancaster film Elmer Gantry (1960) was televised with approximately 30 minutes total in various deletions from its original 146-minute length, viewers complained that because of all the omissions, the movie made little sense.Erickson, Hal. \"Movies on Network TV,\" etc. In fact, quite a few entries in the Thursday night anthology during the first season were over 2 hours long\u2014and this was without commercial interruptions. These included The Counterfeit Traitor (1961; 140 minutes), Parrish (1961; 138 minutes), Ocean's 11 (1960; 127 minutes), Mary, Mary (1963; 126 minutes), and Sunrise at Campobello (1960; 144 minutes). Before their broadcast, each of these films was cut to accommodate what CBS executives deemed a feasible running-time. Sunrise at Campobello, in particular, suffered a loss of nearly an hour from its footage after the network pared it down to a 2-hour broadcast including advertisements. Even so, CBS's affiliated stations were still forced on more than a few occasions to delay the start of their local 11:00 (ET) nightly newscasts. In one case, however\u2014that of the Anthony Quinn film Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962)\u2014the network considered the entry too short. Requiem had a running time of 85 minutes, but this was judged untenable by CBS executives. Columbia Pictures, the film's theatrical distributor, was contacted and arrangements were made to \"pad\" the film with extra footage. According to the movie's producer, David Susskind, there were 40 minutes of outtakes from the film in the studio's vault that had to be located. It was from these that an extra 10 minutes was assembled and added to the CBS print. In fact, this is believed to be \"the first time television has added footage to a movie.\"Adams, Val. \"10 Minutes Will Be Added to Feature Film for TV.\" New York Times.

The series' initial season thus comprised a total of 31 movies\u201312 from Warner Brothers, 13 from Columbia, 3 from Paramount, 2 from United Artists, plus one classic (Harvey) from Universal Studios in a transaction involving an aborted TV-movie deal. (See the article section below on the \"Rise of the Made-for-TV Movie.\") The next season, CBS would add a second anthology on Friday nights. The network's movie schedule for the 1966-67 season would begin in September with the Thursday Night Movie's television debut of the first half of The Music Man (1962), starring Robert Preston and Shirley Jones. The concluding half of the film would be televised the following evening as the premiere offering of the new CBS Friday Night Movie. == The 1966\u201367 and '67\u201368 seasons: Thursdays and Fridays == The film that CBS never aired. Among the films CBS had acquired from Paramount Pictures in 1965, there included the Alfred Hitchcock shocker Psycho (1960), which was scheduled for premiere the night of Friday, September 23, 1966. However, just days before the film was to air, U.S. Senator Charles H. Percy's (R-Illinois) college-aged daughter, Valerie, was reported slain by an unknown assailant, and details of the crime went viral in the national print and TV-radio media, including one news article that described the \"blonde and pretty\" Miss Percy as having been \"beaten and stabbed to death in her bed.\"\"Clues Studied in Girl's Slaying.\" Corpus Christi Times. (September 19, 1966): p. 2. To this day, the identity of Valerie Percy's murderer remains unsolved. The inevitable analogy between Valerie Percy and a \"blonde and pretty\" Janet Leigh, plus the fact that both the senator's daughter and the Leigh character in the film were both murdered while in a vulnerable state (Miss Leigh in the shower, Miss Percy while asleep) became too much of a coincidence for some of the network's affiliates in the Midwest who announced they would not carry the film.\"'Psycho' Date Up in Air.\" Corpus Christi Caller Times. (October 9, 1966): p. 15F. Thus, shortly before Psycho's broadcast, CBS, without notice, yanked it in favor of a Frank Sinatra war film Kings Go Forth (1958). Later that year, CBS decided not to air Psycho at any future date.Adams, Val. \"CBS Drops 'Psycho' from Film List.\" (New York Times News Service) Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (December 18, 1966): p. 22G. The film was thus cancelled altogether despite the hefty $500,000 price that CBS had paid Paramount for exclusive rights to televise the movie. The preemption of Psycho aside, however, the 1966-67 season saw an increase over the previous season in the number of Paramount films televised on CBS. These included Grace Kelly's Academy Award-winning performance in The Country Girl (1954), Marlon Brando's only directorial effort, One-Eyed Jacks (1961), and the Jerry Lewis comedy, The Delicate Delinquent (1957). Columbia Pictures also made a strong showing during the Thursday Night Movie's second season with such entries as Sam Peckinpah's Civil War epic Major Dundee (1964) and the Jack Lemmon comedy, Good Neighbor Sam (1964). But Warner Brothers output, so prominent throughout the anthology's first season, consisted of only five features\u2014and one of those was the animated Gay Purr-ee (1963), a film targeting the pre-teen audience and broadcast just two days before Christmas. Additionally, United Artists pictures during the season also totaled only five; however, the televising of one of those entries, Lilies of the Field (1963), became of particular interest when it was reported that its director, Ralph Nelson, was \"given the privilege [by CBS] of editing his own movie for television presentation.\"Kleiner, Dick. \"New Specter Rising in TV-Movie Marriage.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (March 26, 1967): p. 11F. Further, Nelson was allowed to insert commercial breaks anywhere he wanted. He was even successful in negotiating a bit of risqu\u00e9 dialogue delivered by Sidney Poitier, the film's star. Given that this occurred just a year after producer-director George Stevens had sued NBC over its telecast of his movie A Place in the Sun (1951), arguing that \"the network would damage the film by interrupting the narrative with a series of commercials\",Rich, John. Warm Up the Snake: A Hollywood Memoir. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006. p. 98. this move by CBS to collaborate with a filmmaker on the broadcast of his own work suggested that commerce could, on occasion, co-exist with art. Also of note, the religiously-themed film aired on Good Friday. Thursdays (1966\u201367): # 1966-09-15: The Music Man (1962), Part 1 # 1966-09-22: Good Neighbor Sam (1964)Before CBS aired this film, censors deleted several comedy sequences that poked fun at the Hertz car-rental TV commercials, which ran on TV throughout the early 1960s.

From May through August of that year, the series consisted of reruns. For the most part, features that had premiered on a Thursday night were rebroadcast months later on a Friday night, while Friday's premieres aired later in the season on a Thursday. The following September, the CBS Thursday Night Movie began its third season with a film from a new package of Metro-Goldwyn Mayer movies\u2014Jack Cardiff's Young Cassidy (1965), a bio-pic on the life of Irish playwright Se\u00e1n O'Casey. Then the next evening, the Friday Night Movie kicked off its sophomore year with an oddity: American- International Pictures' Beach Party (1963), the first of a series of zany romantic comedies featuring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Additionally, the network poured forth the remainder of United Artists titles acquired two years earlier\u2014a balance of 20 motion pictures, including Stanley Kramer's tense racial drama The Defiant Ones (1958), Jules Dassin's caper classic Topkapi (1964), as well as the inspirational One Man's Way (1964), based on the life of the influential pastor, Norman Vincent Peale. In fact, CBS aired this film the night of Martin Luther King's assassination; it seemed an especially apt gesture by the network, even if the film had been scheduled months earlier for just that very evening. Among the network's other offerings, Warner Brothers movies maintained their steady minority presence, among them actor Vic Morrow's eccentric interpretation of Prohibition-era bootlegger Dutch Schultz in Portrait of a Mobster (1961)\u2014a film so violent that its repeat performance in June 1968\"Thursday Highlights.\" (View TV Magazine Supplement) Gettysburg Times. (June 1, 1968): p. 4. had to be postponed for a later broadcast,\"Movies on TV: Friday.\" (View TV Magazine Supplement.) Gettysburg Times. (July 13, 1968): p. 5. as it had been scheduled just two days after the slaying of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. It was replaced by a rerun of the aforementioned One Man's Way.\"Regular TV Schedule is Suspended.\" Corpus Christi Times. (June 6, 1968): p. 6D. As the CBS Thursday (and Friday) Night Movie entered the 1967-68 season, media critics took increased notice of the mature topics and risque themes explored in network movies\u2014subject matter heretofore considered taboo in TV-land. For example, Jack Gould of the New York Times, singled out the network's September 1967 broadcast of Billy Wilder's The Apartment (1960), with its frank yet satirical treatment of office politics and adultery. Gould noted \"[t]he paradox...that in shows expressly produced for TV there continues to be the traditional concern over the preservation of blandness to suit all age groups. Matters of sex, let alone hints of extramarital relationships, are skirted like the plague.\"Gould, Jack. \"TV Chipping Away at Well-Entrenched Taboos.\" New York Times. (October 2, 1967): p. 95. But with the showing of The Apartment (an Academy Award-winner for Best Picture) and other movies that tackled risky subjects, Gould concluded that \"as the networks buy even more recent films, the trend [to challenge previous taboos] will very likely increase.\" A week later, Gould observed that \"there appears to be no denying that films of feature length...have established themselves as the most stable form of TV program\"Gould, Jack. \"Television: The Movie Revolution.\" New York Times. (October 8, 1967): p. D27\u2014stable, at least, in the sense that all three major networks had, by then, each committed two nights per week of their prime-time schedules to old but recent films. And Gould's colleague, George Gent, writing on the same page and same issue of the Times, confirmed this sentiment after \"national Nielsen figures\" revealed that CBS's two-part TV- premiere of the prisoner-of-war drama The Great Escape (1963) had been ranked #1 and #2 of that week's most-watched programs. \"Audience taste,\" concluded Gent, \"continues to run in the direction of feature-length movies.\"Gent, George. \"Everyone Wants to Stay Home\u2014And Watch Steve McQueen.\" New York Times. (October 8, 1967): p. D27. Not all critics, however, were receptive to this new trend in viewership. Syndicated entertainment writer Cynthia Lowry, for example, noted that CBS, as well as its two competitors, were engaged in the programming practice of front-loading\u2014in other words, \"piling in early the best feature-films.\" She warned that later \"they will have to put on some of the turkeys\u2014and there are those in every package.\"Lowry, Cynthia. \"After the Better Films, TV May Test Out Turkeys.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (October 13, 1967): p. 4B. Lowry further complained that as a result of the popularity of old movies, new TV programs were \"suffering seriously this season from the competition\" while attempting to establish a loyal fan base of their own during the crucial first weeks of their broadcast. Ms. Lowry's objections notwithstanding, however, as long as movie anthologies continued to deliver better-than-average product, superior viewer ratings would continue to endure\u2014which they did. Below is listed the entire CBS roster for a season that began with bubbling confidence.

In terms of quality and viewer attention, it was to mark the beginning of a dismal time for network movies. == The 1968\u201369 and '69\u201370 seasons: A decline in audience == Station's ad for Thursday Night Movie, 1969-70 season. Just as the previous season had begun with the biography of a playwright (Se\u00e1n O'Casey), CBS followed up in early September 1968 with another film based on a stage author's life. This time, it was Moss Hart, and the movie was Act One (1963), based on Hart's best-selling autobiography of the same title. Act One had already aired on local stations in a few markets, but this was its first network showing.\"Drama Puts Spotlight on Halls of Congress.\" Corpus Christi Times. (September 12, 1968): p. 6B. Thus, CBS declared the actual premiere date of the Thursday Night Movie's fourth season as September 26, when another biographical picture, the musical Gypsy, starring Natalie Wood as burlesque queen Gypsy Rose Lee, made its television bow. The next evening, a second Natalie Wood attraction, Sex and the Single Girl (1964), initiated a third year's roster for the CBS Friday Night Movie. This entry garnered a lot of box-office in its heyday,Weiler, A. H. \"Screen: Promoting Those Scenic Castles in Spain:'The Pleasure Seekers' and Other Films Bow 'Sex and Single Girl' Tenor's Biography.\" New York Times. (December 26, 1964). but critics had labeled it a dud.Whitman, as cited in Sullivan, Rebecca. Natalie Wood. London, UK: Palgrave, 2016. p. 90. In fact, similarly harsh judgments had been passed by critics on most of the other films CBS ran that season. With the exception of John Ford's Cheyenne Autumn (1964)\u2014and even some of Ford's biographers refused to rank this among the director's bestMcBride, Joseph and Michael Wilmington. John Ford. New York: Da Capo, 1975. p.99. With regard to the film, the authors quote Ford directly: \"I've long wanted to do a story that tells the truth about [the Indians] and not just a picture in which they're chased by the Cavalry.\" McBride and Wilmington then proceed to point out the irony that Cheyenne Autumn was indeed just another western about the Cavalry chasing Indians, suggesting that the director failed his intended purpose.\u2014the movies offered by the network's anthology in the fall of 1968 were by and large an inferior collection. Warner Brothers contributions, for example, ranged from soap-opera pathos (Youngblood Hawke, which the New York Times called \"as thin and glossy as wax paper\"\"'Youngblood Hawke' Opens at 2 Theaters.\" New York Times. (November 6, 1964)) to wooden heroics (the Troy Donahue western, A Distant Trumpet, with a story that \"looked implausible or just plain hollow.\"Moss, Marilyn Ann. Raoul Walsh: The True Adventures of Hollywood's Legendary Director. Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky, 2011.) Additionally, such MGM fluff as Quick Before It Melts (1964) could hardly be called a game-saver.Thompson, Howard. \"Movie Review: Antarctic Comedy.\" New York Times (April 1, 1965) Top it off with the Thanksgiving night showing of the same studio's Marco the Magnificent (1965), described by one critic as \"long on spectacle and short on plot\",Harty, Kevin J.

Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co., 2006. p. 177. and you have the ingredients to a disastrous season. Meanwhile, the movies ABC and NBC offered their viewers appeared to be equally unattractive because when the Nielsen ratings for the November 1968 sweeps were released, not a single network movie telecast finished in the Top 20Gould, Jack. \"Too Many Flicks Spoil the Ratings.\" New York Times. (December 29, 1968): p. D21.\u2014an interesting predicament considering the lofty pronouncements made a year earlier by top media observers concerning the popularity of feature films on television. But as CBS vice-president Michael Dann noted, \"There has been a decided shift [in audience] since the opening of the season. I think you will see a decline in all movies for television.\"Cited in Buck, Jerry. \"Movies Lose Footing in Rating Race\". St. Petersburg Times. (October 26, 1968): p. 7-B. And as Rick Du Brow, UPI's television critic, confirmed: Furthermore, Du Brow offered an explanation for this negative trend, one that went far beyond the inferiority of the films themselves. In short, he believed that audiences were \"getting weary of the old-style approach\" and that adherence to conventional modes of presentation by the networks had become constrictive, obsolete, and irrelevant for modern audiences. By means of contrast, the columnist held up newer, hip, innovative variety shows (like NBC's topical and sardonic Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In) as a means of advancing toward that \"new-style approach\" that in the late 1960s attracted the most viewers. As for 3-year-old feature-films like some of those listed below, however, they were declared old-hat.

How a Film Theory Got Lost and Other Mysteries in Cultural Studies. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2001. p. 151. Critic Jack Gould wondered whether a \"battle of film-against-film may not be as remote as some in TV had originally thought.\"Gould, Jack. \"In the Fall, Movies May be All.\" The New York Times. (Feb. 28, 1968): p. D21. And upon the arrival of 1969, another media critic made a hopeful New Year's prediction that \"[s]ome network will bravely drop one of those nightly two-hour movie reruns\" and replace it with \"two half-hour situation-comedies plus a one-hour variety show [whose star is] a very young singer with a Southern accent and a guitar\".Lowry, Cynthia. '\"Reviewer Predicts Future: Says It's Easy Because TV Seldom Changes.\" Corpus Christi Times. (January 7, 1969): p. 3B. That forecast proved only half-correct\u2014the singer with the Southern accent and guitar turned out to be Glen Campbell, whose weekly variety show premiered on CBS two weeks into January 1969. Campbell's broadcast, however, replaced neither of the network's movie anthologies. The beginning of the 1969-70 season saw a brief surge in audience numbers with CBS's two-part world TV premiere of The Guns of Navarone (1961), based on the Alistair MacLean best-seller.\"\"Advantage of an Early Start.\" Broadcasting (Magazine). (October 6, 1969): p. 42. Then 14 days later, the comedy Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding (1966) qualified as the sixth most- watched program of the Nielsen's rating period, while the Glenn Ford thriller Fate is the Hunter (1964) scored at #16 during the same week.\"ABC Blasts to Top In Incredible Week.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (October 18, 1969): p. 13A. And in the season's fifth week, the Gothic thriller Two on a Guillotine and another Glenn Ford picture, The Last Challenge, both wound up in the Top 20.\"CBS Tops Nielsens.\" Broadcasting (Magazine). (November 3, 1969): p. 9. But another trend became evident in CBS's film-anthologies as viewers began to notice a sharp increase of repeat broadcasts. As a result, there was a corresponding decrease in new films available for showing, and there was a good reason for this. Production of new theatrical films had slackened to a near-standstill in Hollywood and as a result, some studios, among them 20th Century Fox and Paramount, were \"waiting to unload their expensive backlog of films\" to the networks.Thomas, Bob. \"Stars Lose Their Allure.\" Corpus Christi Times. (November 17, 1969): p. 4C. Indeed, CBS had completed a deal with Fox a year earlier for exclusive rights to televise some of its most recent films (Rio Conchos and Guns at Batasi, to name some), but the network had been allowing those to merely trickle through to viewers at a rate of 5 or 6 per season. This was becoming CBS's programming strategy with product leased from other studios as well. Consequently, the films listed below for the new season, 1969\u201370, included a greater number of reruns than in previous years.

Up until 1970, censors would simply bleep salty dialogue or edit shots, trusting that such excisions would not detract from a film's storyline. In some cases, however, it became necessary to remove so much of a film that additional scenes had to be written and produced by a network and then inserted into the movie so that its telecast not only filled a 2-hour time slot but also made sense to viewers. NBC, for example, had contracted with Universal to run the R-rated Three into Two Won't Go (1969) during the fall of 1970. Questionable scenes from this British-made thriller were either severely chopped or completely eliminated and replaced with 17 minutes of new footage produced in a Hollywood studio and featuring actors who had not appeared in the original conception.Canby, Vincent. \"TV's Movie Butchery.\" (New York Times News Service) Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (November 8, 1970): p. H-17.Trivia for Three Into Two Won't Go at the Internet Movie Database. As a result of such practices, the networks were \"beginning to smart under the criticisms of their cutting and re-shaping\" of additional films such as Secret Ceremony (1968) and The Night of the Following Day (1968).\"NBC Makes Midseason Changes.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times.

Also see Trivia for Night of the Following Day on the Internet Movie Database This was a consequence of the displacement impact of broadcast television. Motion picture studios, having withstood the long decline of theater-attendance by families (who presumably preferred to stay home and watch TV), had increasingly re-crafted their product during the 1960s to appeal to a smaller, more mature (adult) audience in both theme and presentation. Consequently, some films became essentially impossible to re-cut or revise into family broadcast-ready entertainment. Recognizing this, NBC soon abandoned these attempts at the bowdlerization and/or alteration of a theatrical film's content. But at the same time, it became apparent to all three networks that if some movies could not be successfully repackaged for family viewing, then perhaps a stronger emphasis should be focused on producing more films specifically for television. As a result, this hybrid genre began to exert a larger presence on American home screens. The origin of the American network TV-movie had actually occurred years earlier, when NBC had entered into an agreement with Universal wherein the studio produce films approximately 98 minutes long to be broadcast initially on the network. Universal, however, retained the distribution rights to re-release these productions in overseas theatre and television markets. Moreover, NBC agreed to pay \"from 30 to 65 percent of the production costs\" in return for U.S. theatrical and syndication rights as well as \"the right to show the films first.\"Bart, Peter. \"TV Moviemaking Begins in Earnest.\" New York Times. (March 10, 1966): p. 26. This pact resulted in such successful TV-films as the disaster movie The Doomsday Flight (1966) starring Jack Lord; The Borgia Stick (1967), an industrial spy drama with Don Murray and Inger Stevens; and Prescription: Murder (1968), the original manifestation of Peter Falk's police detective/character, Lt. Columbo. NBC thus remained the acknowledged pioneer in TV-movies until 1969, when the ABC network produced and premiered its new weekly series of made-for-TV films, The ABC Movie of the Week. Some of these features were so popular that they were later released to theaters in America and Europe for further exhibition, among them Joseph Sargent's Tribes (1970), Buzz Kulik's Brian's Song (1971) and Steven Spielberg's Duel (1971).See trivia for Tribes (1970) at the Internet Movie Database.McKenna, Michael.

Dean Jagger and Glenn Ford in The Brotherhood of the Bell. By contrast with its competitors, CBS had contributed a scant number of made-for-TV feature-length films; and what little they had scheduled were mostly produced in association with independent companies like QM Productions or the network's own theatrical film-producing arm, Cinema Center 100. However, four years earlier, CBS had entered into an agreement with Universal to contribute $340,000 to the studio's million-dollar budgeted remake of the classic western The Plainsman (1966).Adams, Val. \"CBS Won't Show 'The Plainsman'.\" New York Times. (Jan. 19, 1966): p. 83. In return, CBS was granted the right to exclusively premiere the film as a Thursday Night Movie telecast. However, once production was completed and The Plainsman was screened for Universal's top brass, they concluded they had a hit movie on their hands. Thus, the studio re-negotiated with CBS to drop its commitment to run the film first so that Universal could instead open The Plainsman in theaters. The network agreed, but only on condition Universal promise in return \"to give [CBS] an existing feature film from their backlog.\"Adams, Val. \"CBS Won't Show 'The Plainsman'\", etc. (That replacement feature turned out to be the 1950 fantasy Harvey, starring James Stewart.) Nevertheless, CBS vice- president Michael Dann, a fan of the TV-movie innovation, predicted two months afterward that in the near-future \"the studios will be making 50 to 75 such pictures a year.\"Cited in Bart, Peter, \"TV Moviemaking Begins in Earnest,\" etc. The 1970-71 season would prove him correct. And when the Thursday Night Movie opened its fall schedule with the premiere of a low-budget, made-for-TV movie, rather than a proven Hollywood blockbuster guaranteed to lure mass viewership, it became CBS's way of declaring its commitment to product that, although cheaply manufactured, was nevertheless new and topical. In this case, the movie was The Brotherhood of the Bell, and the film's star was Glenn Ford, a movie actor who had never appeared in a television-film. In fact, before shooting on the project even began, Ford had been warned by friends in the industry that he would hate the experience. Instead, the actor reported that \"it was five of the most enjoyable weeks I've ever spent working...it was a good solid script with people like Maurice Evans and Dean Jagger working with me.\"Cited in Lowry, Cynthia. \"The Ford Festival.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (October 25, 1970): p. D-11. The film received respectable notices from the critics, and its reputation has grown ever since. In 1986, for example, critic David Deal would label Brotherhood \"one of the very best television movies of the era...a first-rate production.\"Deal, David. Television Fright Films of the 1970s. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co., Inc., 1986. p. 15 And in recent years, it has acquired the reputation of a conspiracy-theory cult classic.Ford, Peter. Glenn Ford: A Life. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 2011. p. 253. As a result of the film's success, the new season would witness CBS's determination to increase its output of works produced directly for television\u2014especially during late February to early April 1971, when 5 out of 11 features shown were made-for-TV world premieres.

And on February 14, 1971, there was a special Sunday-night world TV premiere of the film Ben-Hur (1959), featuring Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd. This Academy-Award winner for Best Picture was five hours long when aired with commercial interruptions, running from 7 pm to midnight (ET). In addition, just as the network had done during the previous year, CBS premiered a handful of movies throughout its summer schedule. Among those were included: The Violent Ones (1967; shown June 3), Night Must Fall (1964; debuting June 10), The Wrong Box (1966; premiering Sunday, June 20), The Frozen Dead (1967; June 24), Doctor Faustus (1968; June 25), The Money Jungle (1968; July 1), and An American Dream (1966; July 2). == The 1971\u201372 season: Thursdays and Sundays == A CBS Yuletide tradition. Throughout the summer of 1971, CBS prepared its own weekly series of TV-movies for the new fall season. It was dubbed The New CBS Friday Night Movies. but one network representative advertised it as \"nothing more than an old- fashioned suspense anthology series,\" much like the old U.S. Steel Hour or Playhouse 90\u2014only \"tricked out with film,\" as opposed to live studio broadcasts, the norm for presentation during the early 1950s.Kliener, Dick. \"Borrowing from the Past.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (June 20, 1971): p. H-13. This new project was originally envisioned by producer Philip Barry, Jr. (son of the playwright Philip Barry) to exclusively consist of \"all-suspense of various sorts.\" Barry further promised viewers that the new anthology would avoid \"doing any law enforcement shows, no doctors, no lawyers, none of the usual things.\"Cited in Kliener, Dick. \"Borrowing from the Past\", etc. Director Alf Kjellin, who had learned his craft under fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman, was hired to helm one of the show's premiere entries, The Deadly Dream. Though Kjellin responded positively to the 90-minute television format for filmmaking, he was bothered by certain impractical restrictions, telling one interviewer, \"Ten days is not a long time to make a picture.\"Cited in Buck, Jerry. \"Grab the Audience and Run.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (August 8, 1971): p. H-10. Nonetheless, the New CBS Friday Night Movie began its run in September 1971, occupying the 9:30\u201311:00 time slot (Eastern Time). It was not to be a successful outing, chiefly because it was scheduled opposite NBC's own World Premiere series, which began one hour earlier. In order to accommodate its new suspense anthology, CBS shuffled its Sunday night line-up to make room for its alternative presentation-format for old movies. Thus what had been known for the past 5 years as the CBS Friday Night Movie became the CBS Sunday Night Movie, airing from 7:30 to 9:30 pm (Eastern Time). This was a highly publicized programming change because it necessitated the cancellation of CBS's signature variety series, the long-running Ed Sullivan Show. After 23 successful years, this icon of the airwaves was ordered to vacate the premisesBuck, Jerry. \"CBS Changes Schedule Drastically.\" Corpus Christi Times. (March 17. 1971): p. 12B. and beginning in September, the CBS Sunday Night Movie launched its 1971-72 season with the TV premiere of the Spencer Tracy- Katharine Hepburn 1967 comedy-drama, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. But this would be remembered as the year the holiday classic The Homecoming: A Christmas Story (1971), a TV film starring Patricia Neal, was first aired. Critics lavished unqualified praise, including one writer who labeled it \"a lovely pre-holiday program\u2014sweet but never cloying and sparked with humor.\"Lowry, Cynthia. \"Story Warm and Moving.\" Corpus Christi Times. (Dec. 20, 1971): p. 9D. Not only was this production repeated each year at Yuletide throughout the decade, but it also served as the genesis for the long-running family-drama series The Waltons.

There was also the TV debut of the Danny Kaye military comedy On the Double (1961) on June 8, which included a bawdy sequence in a wartime Berlin cabaret where the comedian/hero, in drag, impersonates Marlene Dietrich and is later \"seduced\" in a dressing room by a drunken Luftwaffe officer. In earlier years, these scenes would have been considered too racy for prime-time audiences, what with their satire of transvestism and gay sex. As it happened, however, CBS had broadcast another film with similar scenes, albeit in a more serious framework, less than four months prior\u2014Luchino Visconti's The Damned (1969), originally rated X when it first opened in theaters. Obviously, the film had to \"undergo some severe editing to conform\" with a TV audience's acceptance\"Television Today.\" San Antonio Express. (Feb. 28, 1972): p. 6-D. and the resulting presentation, which was pre-screened for affiliates via closed-circuit, was so incoherent that many stations refused to run it.Levine, Elana. Wallowing in Sex: The New Sexual Culture of 1970s American Television. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2007. p. 52. The Damned was never intended for prime-time airing. Instead, it was among the initial presentations by CBS for television's first late-night network film anthology, for on the evening of Valentine's Day 1972, the network mailed a love-letter to America's film fans when it broke with network late-night tradition by cancelling its Merv Griffin talk-show to make way for The CBS Late Movie. In so doing, the organization that years earlier had spurned the scheduling of old movies as \"uncreative\" was suddenly running a total of 7 feature-films each week. The axing of the Griffin show was of little consequence when one considers that his program was being broadcast on only 129 affiliates, whereas the CBS Late Movie debuted on 179.Mark, Norman. \"Feeling Superior to 'The Green Slime.'\" (Chicago Daily News Service) Corpus Christi Caller-Times.

It was also a wise business decision when taking into account that the network was paying, on average, only $30,000-40,000 for each of the 220 movies leased from Warner Brothers and MGM. At such cheap rates, CBS was clearing $100,000 per late-night broadcast.Segrave, Kerry. Movies at Home: How Hollywood Came to Television. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co., 1999. p. 87.Mark, Norman. \"Feeling Superior to 'The Green Slime.'\", etc. Meanwhile, in prime time, the CBS Sunday Night Movie appeared to be holding its own in terms of audience shares, especially during the first half of October when it was rated the third most-watched network telecast.Gould, Jack. \"NBC Drops to Third in Ratings.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (October 17, 1971): p. H-4. Unfortunately, those numbers did not hold up; and with ratings for the New CBS Friday Night Movie also sagging, it was decided the upcoming season to return the Sunday Night Movie to its original Friday night time slot and to transfer the Friday made-for-TV movie anthology to Tuesdays. However, one trend introduced late in 1971\u2014the sporadic pre-emption of CBS's Thursday films for news specials\u2014would continue into the next season. This was largely due to the fact that 1972 was not only an election year, but it was also a time when an American president made important overseas state visits to both China and the Soviet Union. It is during such events that information programming enjoys its most receptive audience.Richter, Richard. \"Commentary.\" The Future of News: Television, Newspaper, Wire Services, Newsmagazines. Eds. Philip C. Cook, Douglas Gomery, and Lawrence H. Lichty. Washington, D.C.: Woodrow Wilson Press Center, 1992. p. 38. And in the next season, with the Watergate scandal gathering steam despite President Nixon's landslide re-election, television documentaries and network panel discussions would draw better-than-usual ratings. Thus, news specials would continue to pinch-hit for the Thursday Night Movie on select occasions. == The 1972\u201373 season: Return to Thursdays and Fridays == The movie 100 CBS affiliates refused to air. In the fall of 1972, the issue dominating most discussions on matters related to TV and radio involved on-air obscenities. It even preoccupied lawmakers in Congress, where Sen. John Pastore (D-Rhode Island), chairman of the Commerce Committee, led an investigation into alleged broadcast profanity. He later told one reporter, \"Frankly, there have been some things that have shocked me. There have been four-letter words used on radio. Of course, they haven't gone that far on television...the networks have bleeped them out.\"Cited in Sharbutt, Jay. \"Senator Keeps Eye on TV 'permissiveness.'\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (December 3, 1972): p. F20. Apparently the senator overlooked network film- telecasts, for it was the potty-mouth controversy that cost the CBS Thursday Night Movie half its audience. It occurred on an evening in mid-November when roughly 100 affiliates refused to air the true-crime film In Cold Blood (1967) \"on the grounds of explicit content\"Stanich, Dorothy. \"Around the Dial.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (November 26, 1972): p. 3F.\u2014specifically, the uncensored use of the word \"frigging\" by one of its two lead characters.See the film's transcript of dialogue. Despite the massive affiliate boycott of the movie, its broadcast finished at #18 in the Nielsen ratings for the week it was shown. See \"Patton, NBC in Nielsens.\" Broadcasting (Magazine). (December 4, 1972): p. 44. ABC, however, experienced viewer wrath of a different kind when John Wayne's most famous line of dialogue ever was altered by network censors. This is how Chicago news columnist Mike Royko illustrated the situation: What perplexed viewers about ABC's censorship was that a week later, the same network would show the movie Patton (1970), leaving George C. Scott's swear words intactStanich, Dorothy, \"Around the Dial\", etc.\u2014a move that may have emboldened CBS to retain the double entendres and much of the blue language in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. New York Times critic Howard Thompson praised the telecast, especially the manner in which the network's commercial breaks were carefully placed so as not to detract from the power of Edward Albee's drama. As for the questionable dialogue, Thompson noted that every 'hell' and 'damn' prevailed. He added, \"Sharp ears may have caught an early 'goddamn' from Miss Taylor [and] she bellowed the same word later...an agonized shriek underscoring the despair of a drama that by then had many viewers riveted to their chairs.\"Thompson, Howard. \"TV: Film of Albee's 'Virginia Woolf' Is Adult Earful.\" New York Times. (February 24, 1973): p. 59. In fact, CBS slated the film for broadcast during the all-important sweeps month of February 1973. However, the strategy backfired; the film finished at #38 for the week it was shown. This prompted columnist Rick DuBrow to call out TV executives who persisted in programming a \"comfortably predictable list of motion pictures and determine by title and category how they will do in the ratings game.\"DuBrow, Rick. \"Movie Goers Differ from TV Watchers.\" Boca Raton News. (March 9, 1973): p. 10. In other words, an Oscar-winning movie that features a hot tabloid item like Liz and Dick exchanging curse-laden insults will not always guarantee a huge TV audience\u2014and unfortunately for the network, it didn't. But if CBS's roster of theatrical features failed to match programming expectations, its Tuesday night made-for-TV product was a disaster. As writer Norman Mark noted, \"CBS has flopped with almost all of its [new] films this season, an unequaled record.\"Mark, Norman. \"A 'Vintage Year' for Television?\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (December 3, 1972). One exception, however, was the much-touted A War of Children, starring Jenny Agutter as an Irish-Catholic girl in war-torn Belfast who falls in love with a British/Protestant soldier. According to New York Times critic John J. O'Connor, the film \"got off to a fine start and came to a convincingly moving end. It was somewhere around the middle that the drama failed [and became] almost fatally vague.\"O'Connor, John J. \"Drama is Hurt by Mother's Role.\" (New York Times News Service). Corpus Christi Times. (December 7, 1972): p. 15C. But CBS's Thursday-night world premiere of Gay Talese's Honor Thy Father in March 1973 received rave notices, including one that bestowed high praise on the film's star Joseph Bologna for \"a highly fascinating portrayal\" of Salvatore Bonanno, heir to legendary crime boss Joe Bonanno.DuBrow, Rick. \"'Honor Thy Father' on Tonight.\" Boca Raton News. (March 1, 1973): p. 7B. These works, however, were the only two high points of a disappointing season.

Boca Raton News. (April 12, 1973): p. 7B. As a result, it would not be televised until several years later by another network, NBC. But the Thursday (and Friday) Night Movie did manage intermittent summer premieres, including The Last of the Secret Agents? (1969), featuring the comedy team of Allen and Rossi, on June 7, plus the coming-of-age teen comedy Secret World (1969), aka The First Time, starring Jacqueline Bisset, a week later. Also, there was the debut of the Merchant-Ivory production The Guru (1969), with Rita Tushingham and Michael York, on June 22, as well as the July 19th TV premiere of the Michael Caine film, Deadfall (1968).

Wood discussed \"the changing tastes and standards of society and the growing maturity\" of television audiences that influenced his network's decision to air such controversial films as In Cold Blood and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Wood confirmed that he had deliberately taken \"certain calculated risks.\" However, he felt those gambles were justified.\"CBS Executive Defends Programming.\" (New York Times News Service). Corpus Christi Caller. (October 17, 1973): p. 7C. Later, as if to echo Wood's sentiment, NBC president Herbert S. Schlosser stated that \"television will never lead any parade of permissiveness. But it should [never] be chained to the past by a few hundred letters of complaint.\"Cited in O'Connor, John J. \"TV: New 'Permissiveness' in Prime-Time Fare.\" New York Times. (October 25, 1973): p. 95. Yet to critic John J. O'Connor, the entire issue was irrelevant. He felt that \"despite the injection of 'contemporary' and 'mature' situations, the mix of regular prime-time TV is no less banal or blatantly manipulative than it ever was.\"O'Connor, John J. \"TV: New 'Permissiveness'\", etc. However, another critic, Ron Power of the Chicago Sun-Times, cited a new troubling trend in network programming\u2014violence and sadism. Adopting a highly alarmist stance, Power published what was, in essence, an angry manifesto blasting the networks: Cicely Tyson in a TV-movie classic. Power called for \"organized reform\" by both the media as well as those who viewed their product and patronized their sponsors\u2014and his was not a lone voice. TV/movie director Buzz Kulik stated: \"I don't care what anyone says. I think there's a connection between television violence and real violence. You just can't differentiate between the real and the unreal.\"Cited in \"'Remember When' Director Swears Off TV Violence.\" Corpus Christi Caller. (March 21, 1974): p. 13F. That connection between the reality of violence and the illusion of fictional mayhem on TV reverberated in news headlines throughout the fall of 1973. For example, there were a number of reports about youth gangs pouring gasoline on helpless victims and setting them aflame. These incidents occurred in various parts of the country.Television and Social Behavior: Beyond Violence and Children. Eds. Stephen B. Withey and Ronald P. Abeles. Hillside, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., 1980/2013.\"Fla. Gang Burns White Husband of Black Woman.\" Wilmington Morning News. (November 13, 1973): p. 4. In one instance, a young Boston woman was forced by 6 youths to \"douse herself with two gallons of gasoline\" before they \"then set her afire.\"\"Six Youths Burn Woman to Death in Boston Attack.\" New York Times.

Vol. 42, Issue 3 (1981): p. 676. Even an interracial couple in Fort Lauderdale suffered the same cruel fate.\"Gang Douses Man With Fluid, Sets Him Afire.\" Sarasota Herald-Tribune. (November 13, 1973): p. 9-A. Furthermore, it was pointed out that these attacks occurred almost immediately after \"a television showing of the movie Fuzz (1972) which depicted similar violence\"\"Blacks Burn White Man Who Wed Black Woman.\" Corpus Christi Times. (November 12, 1973): p. 6C. The movie Fuzz was broadcast by The ABC Sunday Night Movie on September 30, 1973. See \"TV Week: Sunday Evening.\" Sarasota Herald-Tribune. (September 30, 1973): p. 4.\u2014specifically, a scene in which one of the characters is doused with a flammable fluid and then ignited. Thus, as in the year before, the stage was set for more debates centering on the issue of censorship and network film telecasts. Amid such controversy, CBS ordered its film cutters to work. The Thursday Night Movie's slate for the 1973-74 season included two of the most violent films of the Sixties\u2014Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969). Both of these works had been championed by critics as masterpieces that used violence to make valid artistic statements about the American contemporary scene.Kael, Pauline. \"Onward and Upward Into the Arts: 'Bonnie and Clyde.'\" New Yorker. (October 21, 1967): p. 147.Canby, Vincent. \"\"Violence and Beauty Mesh in 'Wild Bunch'. New York Times. (June 26, 1969). In spite of this, however, the two movies underwent radical cutting. But according to some in the audience, the network went too far, especially with the Peckinpah film. One viewer complained that \"when the censors at CBS snipped, they snipped without thinking, blindly...CBS did not show The Wild Bunch at all. Instead they showed some mutilated mess that once had been a masterful original.\"Novak, Tom. \"Mailbag: Why Pretend It Was 'The Wild Bunch'.\" New York Times. (October 28, 1973): Section II, P. 21. Another viewer protested that the network's broadcast of the controversial western \"amounted to little more than showing snippets, rather like coming attraction footage...I have never seen any film so extensively cut.\"Nocente, Martin. \"Mailbag: Why Pretend It Was 'The Wild Bunch'.\" New York Times, etc. For CBS, therefore, the new fall season of 1973 got off to a very rocky start. But ultimately it was also a successful one. Screenings of the first two Planet of the Apes films shot CBS to the top of the charts during that same period.\"New TV Shows Absent from Top 20 Ratings.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (September 23, 1973): p. H-10.\"'Ape' Movie Tops Ratings.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (November 11, 1973): p. H-10. And with Steve McQueen's box-office smash, Bullitt (1968), as well as Dustin Hoffman's breakthrough performance as The Graduate (1967) and the Clint Eastwood action-adventure Kelly's Heroes (1970) leading a pack of hit premieres, it was one of the Thursday Night Movie's most robust seasons. It was also a good year for the network's made-for-TV films, largely due to the January 31, 1974 premiere of The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, which was greeted with near-unanimous praise by critics like Jay Sharbutt, who called the work \"profoundly moving...it's the only description that seems to fit this production.\"Sharbutt, Jay. \"'Jane Pittman' Is Fine Show Of Black Life.\" Gettysburg Times. (January 31, 1974): p. 18. And Pauline Kael of the New Yorker, who devoted her entire weekly column to the film, praised John Korty's understated direction as well as Cicely Tyson's performance,Kael, Pauline. \"Cicely Tyson Goes to the Fountain.\" New Yorker.

The remainder of the total 76 telecasts were either (a) reruns of theatrical films from previous seasons; (b) reruns or premieres of made-for-TV films; (c) TV pilot episodes for projected series; or (d) pre-emptions for CBS news, sports, or variety specials. When compared with the total of 52 theatrical-film premieres that the network aired during the 1966-67 season, one can observe that the number of available films for first-time broadcast had dropped by well over 50 percent. However, CBS did schedule four additional new titles to fill its roster during the summer of 1974. These included the June 6 TV premiere of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969), featuring Maggie Smith's Academy Award-winning performance as an unorthodox teacher in a 1930s Edinburgh girls' school. There was also the June 14th television debut of The Looking Glass War (1970), based on a John le Carr\u00e9 spy novel and starring Christopher Jones. And to round out its list of the season's newcomers, the Richard Burton film Villain (1971) premiered June 27, while the medieval drama Alfred the Great (1969), with David Hemmings in the title role, made its bow the next evening. In the fall of 1974, one of CBS's competitors, NBC, premiered the TV-movie, Born Innocent. The film was the beneficiary of an intense promotional campaign by the network, as well as a provocative disclaimer just before its broadcast.Christians, Clifford G., Mary Fackler, Kathy Brittain Richardson, Peggy J. Kreshel, and Robert H. Woods, Jr. Media Ethics: Cases and Moral Reasoning. (9th ed.) London: Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group, 2016. p. 285. And when it finally aired, viewers were exposed to what, up until then, was one of the most graphic depictions of sadism and cruelty ever presented on the small screen.Cowan, Geoffrey. See No Evil: The Backstage Battle Over Sex and Violence in Television. New York: Touchstone/Simon $ Schuster, 1978. p. 287. The story's heroine (played by Linda Blair), a teen-ager serving time inside a juvenile detention center for young women, becomes the victim of sexual assault when she is forcibly violated with a foreign object by a gang of the institution's most violent inmates. A few weeks after the film's broadcast, a 9-year-old girl, walking with a friend along a San Francisco beach, was subjected to a similar act by a trio of teen-age boys. When the young perpetrators were questioned by authorities as to the reason they had chosen this method of attack, they freely admitted having been inspired by the film's controversial scene.Doerkin, Maureen. Classroom Combat: Teaching and Television. Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Educational Technology Publications, 1983. p. 69. Later that year, the mother of the victim sued NBC, claiming the organization was \"responsible for this rape because the network had studies showing that children and susceptible people might imitate crimes seen on TV.\"Sadler, Roger L. Electronic Media Law. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2005. p. 222. The case was eventually thrown out of court, and an appeals panel would later affirm the lower court's judgment to nonsuit,126 Cal.App.3d 488 (Cal. Ct.App. 1981),cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1108(1982) but by then NBC had re-edited the scene for the movie's repeat airing.Brown, Les. \"NBC Plans Replay of 'Born Innocent'. New York Times. (September 27, 1975): p. 61. This case represented one of several legal skirmishes resulting from the television industry's decision to accommodate what CBS president Robert Wood had earlier described as \"the changing tastes and standards of society and the growing maturity\" of a 1970s audience.Cited in \"CBS Executive Defends Programming\", etc. 1974-75 season premiere entry. In a way, Born Innocent represented a trend with which American cineastes had become all too familiar\u2014specifically, the W.I.P. subgenre of films. Exploitation of the lucrative \"women in prison\" premise had reached a point where advertisements for theatrical B-movies, with titles such as Caged Heat (1974), The Big Bird Cage (1972), and Women in Cages (1971), became a familiar and titillating sight on just about every newspaper's amusement pages.Schubart, Rikke. Super Bitches and Action Babes: The Female Hero in Popular Cinema, 1970-2006. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, 2007. pp. 43-49. Of course, a film like Born Innocent, a work produced specifically for television, could hardly resort to the kind of explicit sadism characteristic of the usual drive-in movie fodder. But NBC's film was sensational enough for CBS to program a copycat version that was aired on the Friday Night Movie just 6 months later. This new TV-film was titled Cage Without a Key and, again, it was set in a prison for young women. The heroine (this time, played by Susan Dey) is unwittingly involved in a crime planned and carried out by others. Convicted and sentenced, she is incarcerated in a venue where the inmates' favorite pastime is gang activity. Although St. Petersburg TV critic Charles Benbow argued that this new TV-film \"differs significantly\" from Born Innocent,Benbow, Charles. \"Drama Exposes Breakdowns in Reform School.\" St. Petersburg Times. (March 14, 1975): p. 12-D. author Elana Levine observed that \"Cage features a post-shower, same-sex sexual assault scene that leaves its victim shaken and distraught, and in that respect it clearly follows Born Innocent's formula.\"Levine, Elana. Wallowing in Sex: The New Sexual Culture of 1970s American Television. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2007. p. 94. And author Stephen Tropiano noted the attempt by both films to marginalize lesbians as predatory sex offenders.Tropiano, Stephen. The Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV. New York: Applause Theatre & Cinema, 2002. p. 159. As for the rest of its 1974-75 roster, the CBS Thursday (and Friday) Night Movies started well enough with Robert Altman's original film version of M*A*S*H (1970), along with an amiable trio of satirical westerns. But aside from that, there was little the network could offer its viewers. Hollywood product that could be suitably packaged for TV audiences was becoming a rare commodity. And as a result, this would be the final full season for CBS's Thursday night movies.

Thus, in addition to the eight premieres in early June (as listed above), there was also the July 18 TV debut of The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz (1968), starring Elke Sommer as an East German athlete who fantasizes pole- vaulting over the Berlin Wall to the other side. If this movie seemed like an extended TV comedy, it may have been due to the presence of several actors from the defunct Hogan's Heroes television series, including Ms. Sommers's co- star Bob Crane, along with the show's other regulars, Werner Klemperer, John Banner, and Leon Askin. == Fall 1975: The end == During the summer of 1975, all three networks decided to cut one movie night per week from their fall prime-time schedules. For CBS, it was a choice of keeping either a Thursday- night or a Friday-night anthology. The network chose to retain Thursday. As CBS program director Fred Silverman explained, \"There aren't that many good pictures to begin with...We'd rather take those 2 hours [on Friday nights] and do original television programming. Because finally that's what television is all about: Creating new material for the viewer at home.\"Cited in Marguiles, Lee. \"Bad News Due for TV Film Addicts.\" Corpus Christi Caller-Times. (June 1, 1975): p. E-8. Apparently, Mr. Silverman's idea of \"creating new material\" was the programming of more episodes for two old crime serials, Hawaii Five-O and Barnaby Jones\u2014because beginning in September, that was what Friday night viewers were offered. But in cutting back the airing of theatrical films to its original movie-night, CBS may have provided some consolation for film buffs. There were fewer reruns of old product and less pre-emptions for news and variety specials. In that respect, the Fall 1975 season of The Thursday Night Movie would resemble the format of its maiden Fall 1965 schedule\u2014one where viewers could feel reasonably confident that Thursday's 9:00-11:00 pm (ET) time slot would be reserved only for movies. To be sure, there were still occasional made-for-TV premieres, such as the sports biography Babe (1975), starring Susan Clark as the multi-talented athlete Babe Didrikson. In fact, this production was nearly doomed before it began. Earlier, when Babe's co- producer Stanley Rubin tried repeatedly to convince Didrikson's widower/husband George Zaharias to sell him the exclusive rights to her story, he flatly refused. As Rubin later recalled, \"He said he had several opportunities to sell Babe's story. Once, he had gotten badly burned in some deal. So he was understandably leery of the whole thing.\"Cited in Kleiner, Dick. \"Story of Babe Didrikson Made into TV-Movie.\" Corpus Christi Caller- Times. (June 29, 1975): p. F-7. One Saturday, however, Zaharias relented and phoned Rubin, granting him permission for the story, but only if he hand- delivered a cashier's check by that very afternoon. Since few banks were open for business on weekends, Rubin was barely able to make it to Zaharias's residence in time with the necessary check to close the deal. As it turned out, Babe's reviews were quite good. Syndicated columnist Joan Hanauer, for example, praised writer Joanna Lee's scenario. She stated that even if Babe's story \"loses in suspense because the end is preordained, [it] gains in poignancy because Babe was a real woman...whose beautifully functioning body was no more able to conquer cancer than those of her weaker sisters.\"Hanauer, Joan. \"Babe's Life Makes Poignant Drama.\" Boca Raton News. (October 23, 1975): p. 9A. It was positive critical reaction such as this that made Rubin's persistence pay off. There was also the world premiere of the TV-movie Fear on Trial, which has been described by film critic James Monaco as \"CBS's mea culpa about how it contributed to the anticommunist blacklisting\" of media personalities during the 1950s.Monaco, James. Celebrity: The Media as Image Makers. New York: Dell, 1978. p. 59 But as author Robert Sherill pointed out, \"No matter how much pain they inflicted on individuals, corporations could always find a way to profit from their Cold War perfidy.\"Sherill, Robert. First Amendment Felon: The Story of Frank Wilkinson, His 132,000-Page FBI File, and His Epic Fight for Civil Rights and Liberties. New York: Nation Books, 2005. p. 23. Sherill further argued that CBS's new film did exactly that\u2014by taking the real-life case of persecuted radio entertainer John Henry Faulk (played by William Devane) and dramatizing his battle in court, where he is ably represented by high-powered lawyer Louis Nizer (George C. Scott). Although the film carries an upbeat message, the reality of the trial's aftermath was far different. Faulk's cash judgment of $3.5 million was later reduced considerably on appeal. After paying his attorney, Faulk wound up with only $75,000, most of which was spent on alimony payments.Sherill, Robert, etc. Later, as if to atone for its past mistreatment, CBS offered Faulk a job as a regular on Hee Haw.

Friday, it was decided, would become the lone designated prime-time movie night for the network, beginning December 5.Brown, Les. \"CBS Is Switching Some Shows\". The New York Times. (November 5, 1975): p. 87. Thus, after over ten consecutive seasons on the air, The CBS Thursday Night Movie would come to an end. Perhaps it was just as well because at the same time, VHS and Betamax videocassette recorders were just being introduced into the American marketplace, enabling consumers to either rent or purchase copies of movies for in-home viewing, uncensored and without commercial interruptions. The so-called \"video revolution\" had begun. Moreover, there were the recent start-ups of pay-TV networks such as Home Box Office and The Movie Channel, both showcasing uncut versions of recent movies on cable systems across the country. Such attractive innovations in programming were sounding a death knell for network prime-time film anthologies; they had become essentially obsolete and were on a slow path to extinction. Therefore, in a historical context, the cancellation of the CBS Thursday Night Movie was more than just another programming strategy. It was a move that signaled the end of one television era and the beginning of the next. == Notes and references == Category:1960s American television series Category:1970s American television series Category:1965 American television series debuts Category:1975 American television series endings Thursday Night Movie Category:American motion picture television series ",
