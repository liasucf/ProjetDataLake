From 1940 to 1949, he played for the New York Yankees (1940\u201346) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1947\u201349). Bonham, who batted and threw right-handed, won 21 games for the Yankees in 1942. He was born in Ione, California, and nicknamed \"Tiny\" because he was an imposing tall and weighed . ==Career== In a 10-season career, Bonham posted a 103\u201372 (.589) record with 478 strikeouts and a 3.06 ERA in 1,551 innings pitched. Bonham kept opposing batters off balance with an assortment of deliveries. He started his professional baseball career with the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League in 1935. He worked his way up through the New York Yankees minor league system until 1940, when he was summoned from Triple-A Kansas City to anchor a weak Yankees pitching staff. Remaining with the Yankees until , Bonham was a pitching mainstay of manager Joe McCarthy's pennant-winning combinations between 1941 and 1943. Bonham supplied his team with the decisive complete game 4-hit 3\u20131 victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers in Game Five of the 1941 World Series played at Ebbets Field. But Bonham was ill- fated in his other Series starts, losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1942 and 1943, both times by 4\u20133 scores. His most productive season came in 1942, when he led the American League with 21 wins, six shutouts, 22 complete games and a .808 winning percentage. He made the All-Star team that season and again in 1943. Hampered by a chronic back ailment during his last few years with the Yankees, which were interrupted by a brief time in the Army in 1944, Bonham was sent to the Pittsburgh Pirates before the 1947 season. Although his physical condition was such that he could not be counted on regularly, Bonham provided three solid seasons for the Pirates. After a 1\u20134 start in 1949, Bonham won six straight games for a floundering Pittsburgh club, including an 8\u20132 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on August 27, his final game.
