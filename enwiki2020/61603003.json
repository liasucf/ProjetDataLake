    "text": "F\u00e1bio Daniel Soares Silva (born 19 July 2002) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for club Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his professional debut for Porto in August 2019, and set several club records relating to his young age. ==Club career== Born in Gondomar, Porto District, Silva began his career at FC Porto before transferring to rivals S.L. Benfica in 2015, then returning two years later. With 20 goals in 26 games for the under-19 team by February 2019, he was called up by manager S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o to train with the first team. === Porto === He made his Primeira Liga debut for Porto on 10 August 2019 in a 2\u20131 loss at Gil Vicente, playing the final 11 minutes in place of Otavinho; at 17 years and 22 days, he surpassed Bruno Gama as the youngest league player in the club's history. On 19 September against BSC Young Boys in the UEFA Europa League group stage, he became the club's youngest player in European competitions, beating R\u00faben Neves. Six days later, he became the club's youngest starter in any competition when he lined up against C.D. Santa Clara in the Ta\u00e7a da Liga group stage, beating a record held by Serafim Pereira since 1960. On 19 October, Silva scored his first goal to conclude a 5\u20130 win at neighbouring S.C. Coimbr\u00f5es in the third round of the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal; with this goal he surpassed Neves as the youngest goalscorer in the club's history, by a month. Eight days later, he beat the same player's record as Porto's youngest league goalscorer in a 3\u20130 home win over F.C. Famalic\u00e3o. On 10 November, in a 1\u20130 win at Boavista F.C. in the Derby da Invicta, he became the youngest starter in the club's history, a record held since Serafim's days. On 9 February 2020, Silva dropped into Porto's reserve team in LigaPro, debuting as a starter in a 1\u20131 home draw with S.C. Farense, as one of three appearances at this level. He made two further appearances for Porto's first team following the resumption of the league after the coronavirus-enforced shutdown as the club won the league title. ===Wolverhampton Wanderers=== On 5 September 2020, Silva moved to English Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers in a five-year deal for a club record fee of a reported \u00a335 million. He made his full club debut on 17 September 2020 in an EFL Cup defeat to Stoke City. Silva made his Premier League debut as a second-half substitute in Wolves's home game against Manchester City on 21 September 2020. ==International career== Silva had his first international experience with Portugal's under-15 team in 2017. He was part of the under-17 team that reached the quarter-finals of the 2019 UEFA European Championship in the Republic of Ireland, scoring in a 4\u20132 group win over Iceland. On 11 October 2019, Silva scored a hat-trick for the under-19s in a 4\u20131 friendly win over Italy in Bragan\u00e7a. ==Personal life== Silva's father Jorge was a defensive midfielder who won the league in 2001 for Boavista F.C. and was capped twice by Portugal, and his older brother also named Jorge played that position for S.S.
