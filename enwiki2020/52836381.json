He said: \"I remember the first girl I was with, that the first and most of the second album was about, that I was with from school. And I remember the guy she was with, meeting him one day and being like, he is so much suited to her than I ever was. Seeing them together, we never looked like that, we were never that couple, we were never that happy. So it was having a kind of epiphany moment, and writing a song that was basically that.\" \"Happier\" was written in the key of C major with a tempo of 90 beats per minute. The song was composed in common time ( time). ==Critical reception== Taylor Weatherby of Billboard described it as the \"most heartbreaking track\" and \"perhaps one of the prettiest songs\" on the album.

It was directed by Emil Nava, and features a puppet caricature of Sheeran from the music video of his single \"Sing\" sad about the other is about his balloon girlfriend with another puppet and ends with the balloon girl flying away. ==Formats and track listings== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017\u201318) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Brazil International Pop Songs (Crowley Charts) | 9 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Croatia (HRT) | 12 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 73 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI) | 31 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Slovenia (SloTop50) | 8 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 99 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 79 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 58 |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | 68 |} {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 75 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) | 35 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop Wallonia) | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 63 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (R\u00e1di\u00f3s Top 40) | 57 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Israel (Galgalatz) | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) | 28 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 187 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Slovenia (SloTop50) | 30 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 81 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) | 98 |} {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 231 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Version ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | rowspan=\"3\"| 27 April 2018 | rowspan=\"3\"| Contemporary hit radio | rowspan=\"3\"| Original | rowspan=\"3\"| Warner | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy | |- ! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| Various | 25 May 2018 | rowspan=\"4\"| Digital download | Acoustic | rowspan=\"4\"|Asylum | |- | 1 June 2018 | Ti\u00ebsto remix | |- | 8 June 2018 | Cazzette remix | |- | 27 July 2018 | Kasbo remix | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Germany | 6 July 2018 | CD single | Original | Warner | |} ==References== Category:2017 songs Category:2018 singles Category:Ed Sheeran songs Category:Song recordings produced by Benny Blanco Category:Songs written by Benny Blanco Category:Songs written by Ed Sheeran Category:Songs written by Ryan Tedder Category:Music videos featuring puppetry Category:Asylum Records singles Category:Atlantic Records singles ",
