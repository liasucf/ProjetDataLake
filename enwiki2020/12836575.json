    "text": "Donald John Dearson (13 May 1914 \u2013 24 December 1990) was a Welsh footballer who won three caps for his country and played in the Football League for Birmingham City, Coventry City and Walsall. ==Biography== Dearson was born in Ynysybwl, Glamorgan. He began his football career as an inside forward with Barry and moved to First Division Birmingham in 1934. By 1936\u201337 he had established himself as a first-team player. The following season, he was joint top goalscorer, sharing the honour with Welsh international colleague Wilson Jones. In the last full season played before the Second World War, he moved to half-back. He won three full caps for Wales in their last three pre-war internationals. A qualified electrical engineer, he was in a reserved occupation during the war, and was available to represent his country in 15 wartime and victory international matches. Chosen to play against England at Birmingham's home ground, St Andrew's, in 1941, Dearson missed a penalty; Wales lost 2\u20131. He also made 166 appearances for Birmingham in wartime football, including helping the club to the championship of the 1945\u201346 Football League South. By the time the Football League proper resumed after the war, Dearson was past his best. He played another half-season for Birmingham as a full back before moving to Second Division Coventry City and then to Walsall of the Third Division South, before finally giving up League football at the age of 37. He still played another couple of years of non- league football with Birmingham Combination side Nuneaton Borough and Bilston. After retiring from the game he worked for BSA and British Leyland, and died in Sheldon, Birmingham at the age of 76. ==Honours== * with Birmingham City ** Football League South champions 1946 ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:1914 births Category:People from Ynysybwl Category:People from Sheldon Category:1990 deaths Category:Welsh footballers Category:Wales international footballers Category:Barry Town United F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Nuneaton Borough F.C. players Category:Association football utility players Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Association football wing halves ",
