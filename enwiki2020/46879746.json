    "text": "This is a list of former high school athletic conferences in the Northwest Region of Ohio, as designated by the OHSAA. If a conference had members that span multiple regions, the conference is placed in the article of the region most of its former members hail from. Because the names of localities and their corresponding high schools do not always match and because there is often a possibility of ambiguity with respect to either the name of a locality or the name of a high school, the following table gives both in every case, with the locality name first, in plain type, and the high school name second in boldface type. The school's team nickname is given last. ==Auglaize County League== * Wapakoneta Blume Redskins (192?-29, to Mid-Western League) * Buckland Indians (192?-64, consolidated into Wapakoneta) * Cridersville Rams (192?-64, consolidated into Wapakoneta) * St. Marys Memorial Roughriders (192?-29, to MWL) * New Bremen Cardinals (192?-70, to Wayne) * New Knoxville Rangers (192?-70, to Wayne) * Wapakoneta St. Joseph Saints (192?-70, to Wayne)1 * Waynesfield-Goshen Tigers (192?-70, to West Central Ohio Conference)2 # Concurrent with Wayne 1956-70. # Concurrent with Logan County League 1960-70. ==Big Five League== * Bowling Green Bobcats (1929-31, to Buckeye League 1934) * Lima Central Spartans (1929-31, to Southern Ohio League 1941) * Defiance Bulldogs (1929-31, to Northwest Ohio) * Fostoria Redmen (1929-31, to Buckeye League 1934) * Lima South Tigers (1929-31,to Southern Ohio League 1941) ==Black Fork Valley Conference== The all-time members of the Black Fork Valley Conference.

Toledo Waite representatives also mentioned that having to play conference newcomer Toledo Macomber in the Toledo City League would have made it impossible for them to continue playing in both leagues. An interest in joining the league was expressed by Hamilton, Middletown, Springfield, and Toledo Libbey in 1949, but those schools ultimately decided the travel was too much for them to consider as well. ==Ohio Wrestling League (wrestling only)== Disbanded after 2013-2014 season when the Blanchard Valley Conference expanded.http://www.bcsn.tv/news_article/show/460355 * Arcadia Redskins (Blanchard Valley Conference) * Oregon Cardinal Stritch Cardinals (Toledo Area Athletic Conference) * Mount Cory/Rawson Cory-Rawson Hornets (Blanchard Valley Conference) * Gibsonburg Golden Bears (Toledo Area Athletic Conference) * McComb Panthers (Blanchard Valley Conference) * Northwood Rangers (Toledo Area Athletic Conference) * Toledo Christian Eagles (Toledo Area Athletic Conference) * Van Buren Black Knights (Blanchard Valley Conference) ==Richland County League== see the Richland County Standings * Bellville Blue Jays (1948-1963) * Butler Bulldogs (1948-1963) * Lexington Minutemen (1948-1963) * Lucas Cubs (1946-1963) * Ontario Warriors (1948-1963) * Plymouth Big Red (1948-1963) * Shiloh Lions (1948-1958, Merged with Plymouth to create Plymouth-Shiloh School District) * Union (1947-1963, Merged with Savannah in 1963 and consolidated in Ashland Crestview in 1964) ==San-Wood League== *Grand Rapids Pirates (1961/62-1962/63) * Green Springs Bobcats (1961/62-1962/63) * Maumee Valley Country Day (1961/62-1962/63) * Olney/Northwood (1962/63) (last year of Olney HS, referred to as both names in various media during school year) *Tontogany Otsego Knights (1961/62-1962/63) *Woodville Warriors (1961/62-1962/63) ==Sandusky County League== While containing only Sandusky County teams for most of its existence, at one point the conference had members from four different counties.

By 1959, consolidation and schools leaving for other leagues had whittled the three leagues down to two, with the Northern and Southeast leagues combining into the Eastern Wood County League. This would only last for one year, as further consolidation caused a merger into a single league. The league ended in 1963, as the number of schools was whittled to three. ===Full Membership List=== * Bloomdale Bulldogs (193?-60, Consolidated into Elmwood) * Cygnet Zippers (193?-60, consolidated into Elmwood) * Grand Rapids Pirates (193?-63, to Seaway Conference) * Haskins Hawks (193?-1957/58, consolidated into Otsego) * Hoytville Jackson Knights (193?-60, consolidated into McComb) * Milbury Lake Flyers (193?-60, to Northern Lakes League) * Milton Center Mustangs (193?-56, consolidated into Westwood) * Wayne Montgomery Eagles (193?-1957/58, consolidated into Otsego) * North Baltimore Tigers (193?-63, to Seaway Conference) * Olney Eagles (193?-60, consolidated into Lake.
