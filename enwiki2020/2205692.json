    "text": "Abbe Lane (born Abigail Francine Lassman; December 14, 1932) is an American singer and actress. Lane was known for her sexy outfits for the times and sultry style of performing. In addition, Lane was the fourth wife of Latin bandleader and musician Xavier Cugat. ==Early years== Born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, Lane began her career at the age of four as a child actress on Vitaphone and radio. She began singing and dancing on Broadway. On Broadway she portrayed Bobo in Oh Captain! (1958). Early in her career, Lane was billed as \"Abbe Marshall\". Using that name, she appeared in the Broadway shows Barefoot Boy with Cheek (1947) and As the Girls Go (1948). ==Acting and singing== Abbe Lane with her husband Xavier Cugat Because of her work in Europe, Lane was known as an actress before she became recognized for her singing and dancing. She had a television program in Europe and made 21 films there early in her career. In 1952 Lane married bandleader Xavier Cugat, who was 30 years her senior. During the 1950s and early 60s she worked as a nightclub singer and was described in a 1963 magazine article as \"the swingingest sexpot in show business.\" Cugat's influence was seen in her music, which favored Latin and rumba styles. In 1958 she starred opposite Tony Randall in the Broadway musical Oh, Captain! but her recording contract prevented her from appearing on the original cast album of the show. Eileen Rodgers performed her songs for the cast LP; Lane later recorded her songs on a solo album. Lane made several recordings for RCA Victor and Mercury. She worked with Tito Puente on the album Be Mine Tonight released in 1958. She appeared on talk shows with Cugat until 1963. In 1964, Lane and Cugat divorced. They had no children together during their marriage. That same year Lane married Perry Leff. Lane attracted attention for her suggestive comments, such as \"'Jayne Mansfield may turn boys into men, but I take them from there.\" She said she was considered \"too sexy in Italy\". Her costume for an appearance on the Jackie Gleason Show was considered too revealing and she was instructed to wear something else. She was a guest on the television shows of Red Skelton, Dean Martin and Jack Benny. In the later 1960s Lane starred in several Italian films. She performed on television variety programs such as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Steve Allen Show, The Jack Paar Program, The Mike Douglas Show, The Hollywood Palace, The Joey Bishop Show, The Merv Griffin Show and The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson from the 1950s into the 1970s. She played guest roles in Naked City, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., The Flying Nun, F Troop, The Brady Bunch, Hart to Hart, and Vega$. Her last movie appearance was in Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983) in the minor role of an airline stewardess. ==Later years== In 1992, Lane wrote the semi- autobiographical novel But Where Is Love? which described the painful memories of a teenage girl married to an older man. Lane received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6381 Hollywood Boulevard for her contribution to television. ==Discography== ===As leader=== * Be Mine Tonight, with Tito Puente and His Orchestra (RCA Victor, 1957) * The Lady in Red, with Sid Ramin's Orchestra (RCA Victor, 1958) * Where There's a Man, with Sid Ramin and His Orchestra (RCA Victor, 1959) * Abbe Lane with Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra (Mercury, 1961) * The Many Sides of Abbe Lane (Mercury, 1964) * Rainbows (Butterfly Records, 1980) With Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra * Dance Time with Xavier Cugat (RCA Victor, 1953) * Cha Cha Cha (Philips, 1955) ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
