It was popular enough to be re-released in 1943. ==Synopsis== While on a family holiday in Blackpool, a mild-mannered man is mistaken for an international spy. He escapes a brush with the police in women's clothing which he has stolen but discovers a secret letter in the lady's handbag. This directs him to a meeting with representatives of Ptomania (a thinly-disguised Germany) who are involved in an attempt to sabotage an international glider competition. Hitler makes a brief appearance as the unnamed pilot of a doomed Ptomanian plane, complete with fringe, toothbrush moustache, and wild gesticulations. The film has some elements of music hall entertainments in a song and dance routine as well as a number of slapstick moments. It contains both live action and edited stunt routines. ==Partial cast== * Lupino Lane as Mr. Pog * Renee Clama as Sonia * Sari Maritza as Greta Gherkinski * Wallace Lupino as Ptomanian Ptough * Lola Hunt as Mrs. Pog * Herman Darewski And His Blackpool Tower Band * Eddie Jay as Bit Part * Sam Lee as Bit Part * Cyril McLaglen as Bit Part * Denis O'Neil as Singer * Charles Stone as Bit Part ==References== ==Bibliography== *Wood, Linda.
