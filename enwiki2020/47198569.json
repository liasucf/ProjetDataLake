Redline's first product, the AN-50 point-to-point wireless Ethernet bridge, was launched in February 2002. In October 2007, Redline Communications was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. While Redline's value grew quickly in its earlier years, growth tapered off shortly after their 2007 IPO, with shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange falling from a 2007 high of $6.50 to under $0.30 by 2009. With the discovery of accounting irregularities in April 2010, Redline\u2019s stock was cease-traded. In August 2010 it restated its revenues for the four years 2006 to 2009. Also in 2010, Redline Communications, along with KPMG LLP, its accountants at the time, was served with a class action lawsuit by investors alleging Redline overstated profits and downplayed costs in its financial statements. The case settled in Sept 2011 and in November 2011 the Ontario Superior Court approved the agreement of a $3.1 million payment by Redline Communications and $500,000 by KPMG, neither of which admitted liability. Eric Melka, formerly president of Redline shareholder Telemedia Inc., became the company\u2019s permanent CEO in January 2011, replacing the management team and reducing overall staff. The company\u2019s market emphasis shifted to oil and gas which by the end of 2012 represented 50% of the company\u2019s revenue. Melka's departure was announced in October 2012, citing health reasons. In December 2013, Robert Williams was appointed Redline CEO. On September 9, 2014, Redline Communications announced its purchase of the assets of PureWave Networks for $2 million.
