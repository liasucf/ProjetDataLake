The church was constructed from flint and rubble during the late 12th century; there also remains evidence that some Roman bricks and tiles were used as they are visible among the chancel walls, and also the north wall of the nave. Over the years there has been refurbishment and maintenance on the church. In the 15th or 16th century the roofs of the chancel and nave, which are ceiled in except for the plates and tie-beams, were renewed. Within the tower there is a font with an octagonal bowl which dates from the 14th century. Outside the south wall of the nave is the brick altar tomb of the philosopher John Locke (1704). A mural tablet, originally above the tomb, was moved inside the church for preservation in 1932.
