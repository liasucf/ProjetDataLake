    "text": "P\u00e9ry is part of the municipality of P\u00e9ry-La Heutte in the Jura bernois administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). ==History== The first mention of P\u00e9ry is in 884 where it is called villam Bedericam. In 1148 it was known as Peril, though that name comes from a 12th-century forgery. The municipality was formerly known by its German name B\u00fcderich, however, that name is no longer used. In 884, Charles the Fat granted P\u00e9ry to Moutier-Grandval Abbey. The Abbey owned the village and surrounding lands until 999 when the Prince- Bishop of Basel acquired the village. He incorporated it into the seigniory of Erguel and gave the village to the Lords of P\u00e9ry who ruled from Ch\u00e2tillon Castle, now a ruin, on a nearby hill. Beginning in the 14th century the feudal levies from P\u00e9ry were part of the Erguel army under the command of Biel. In 1530, Biel encouraged the village to accept the Protestant Reformation. The village of Rondch\u00e2tel was independent of P\u00e9ry until 1766. Based on the name, it is likely that a castle existed on the hill, but little is known about it. During the mid 14th century, the Prince-Bishop of Basel Johann II von Munsingen, granted Rondch\u00e2tel to his brother Conrad, who was an ecclesiastical bailiff of Biel in 1340-65. Starting at the end of the 14th century, Rondch\u00e2tel fief was owned by the de Nans and d'Orsans families out of Franche- Comt\u00e9. They held the village until 1766, when the last heir of the families died out and the fief reverted to the Prince-Bishop. The Prince-Bishop then leased Rondch\u00e2tel to the community of P\u00e9ry. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, P\u00e9ry became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. A few years later, it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut- Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, P\u00e9ry was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The village church of St. James was first mentioned in 884. After the village converted to the new Reformed faith in 1530, it became a Reformed church. The current church was built in 1706 around a core of an older, Gothic building. At some point it became the parish church for the parish of P\u00e9ry. From 1798 until 1840, Vauffelin was part of the parish. A Roman Catholic chapel was built in the village in 1906. Rondch\u00e2tel cement factory and quarry The Prince-Bishop of Basel, Johann Franz von Sch\u00f6nau-Zell (Bishop 1651-1656), had a blast furnace built at La Reuchenette in 1654. In 1693 he gave the furnace as a fief to Chemilleret family, who held it until the death of their last heir in 1756. By 1782 the site included an ironworks, a house, an inn. After the French invasion, it was declared a national treasure and the feudal ownership was abolished. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des forges d'Undervelier took over operation of the site until 1867, when it closed. The Biel-Les Convers railway opened in 1874 and encouraged industrial and population growth. The lime and cement factory in Rondch\u00e2tel (1874), the wood pulp plant at Biberist (1882) and a branch of the Rondch\u00e2tel cement factory in La Reuchenette (today Ciments Vigier SA) all contributed to the prosperity of the municipality. The watch manufacturer Dreyfus Fr\u00e8res SA of Biel opened a branch company in 1903 in P\u00e9ry. This company, called P\u00e9ry Watch, did not survive the financial crisis of the 1930s. The building was converted in 1934 into a typewriter ribbon, stencils and carbon paper factory under the name Carfa SA. Carfa remained in operation until 2003. In 2005, just over half of all jobs in the municipality were in manufacturing. On 1 January 2015 the former municipalities of P\u00e9ry and La Heutte merged to form the new municipality of P\u00e9ry-La Heutte.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 2 January 2013 ==Geography== Rondch\u00e2tel, castle hill terrace at the southern side Before the merger, P\u00e9ry had a total area of .
