    "text": "William Henry Grey (December 22, 1829, in Washington, D.C. \u2013 November 8, 1888, in Helena, Arkansas) was an American storeowner, church leader, and Reconstruction politician in Arkansas. The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture calls Grey \"a tireless fighter for the rights of freedmen.\" ==Biography== Grey was born into freedom in December 1829 in Washington, D.C., and moved with his family to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then to Cincinnati, Ohio, in the 1840s. In 1852, as an adult, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and found work as a cook on Mississippi River steamboats. In 1854, he wed Henrietta Winslow, who became the mother of his eight children. A member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, he was called to the ministry and became an AME lay minister. At some point he moved his family south from Missouri to the Arkansas Delta, a region with which he would already have been familiar through his steamboat duties. ===Reconstruction=== In 1865, the closing year of the American Civil War, Grey was living in Helena, Arkansas, as the operator and part-proprietor of a grocery and bakery. He participated in the Little Rock African-American convention in that year, a gathering called to discuss the community's response to the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment and the formal end of slavery in the United States. In 1868, Grey was elected as a representative from Phillips County to the 1868 Arkansas Constitutional Convention, in which he was one of eight African- American delegates. The atmosphere of the 1868 convention was embittered by resentments stemming from the war. A minority of delegates, described as \"Conservatives,\" fought to prevent African-Americans from possessing the right to vote. Another issue was inter-racial marriage. Grey served on four of the convention's standing committees, including those dealing with education and the right to vote. The new Arkansas constitution was ratified statewide with Republican support. As the new Arkansas government came into being, Grey's Phillips County neighbors elected him to the state legislature for the 1868\u20131869 term. Grey subsequently briefly filled a vacancy in the Arkansas Senate in 1875. Grey was elected clerk of the First Circuit Court and ex- officio Recorder of Deeds in 1870. In 1872, he was a delegate to the 1872 Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia. He was selected to co- second the nomination of Ulysses S. Grant for a second term as U.S. President. His speech is believed to have been the first address spoken by an African American to a presidential nominating convention of a major U.S. political party. Grey also, in 1872, took on the duties of Arkansas Commissioner of Immigration and State Lands, as the state had not yet been fully settled and was highly dependent upon additional immigrants. He had to lay down these duties in 1874 after suffering a possible stroke. Grey returned to Helena and was selected as clerk of the Phillips County probate and county courts. ===Jim Crow era=== In the 1870s, severe reverses struck Grey. The 1868 state constitution that he had helped to write was thrown out in 1874 and replaced by a new document, supported by many former Confederates. This constitution re-opened the door to Jim Crow government. In September 1878, Grey was paralyzed, an event believed to have been caused by a second and disabling stroke. The Democratic Party of Arkansas, which at that time was strongly oriented toward ex-Confederate interests, regained political control of Phillips County in the same year. This development permanently silenced Grey's voice in public affairs. He lived in obscurity until his death. ==Legacy and honors== Grey was called by historian Harry Ashmore \"the outstanding black leader of the period\" in Arkansas. ==Quote== * \"We are here to receive the amount due us from the State of Arkansas. Pay us, sir, the rights and privileges dues us as citizens of the United States and the State of Arkansas.\" ==References== Category:1829 births Category:1888 deaths Category:African-American people in Arkansas politics Category:African- American state legislators in Arkansas Category:Businesspeople from Arkansas Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives Category:Arkansas state senators Category:People from Washington, D.C.
