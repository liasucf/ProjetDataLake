Originally Punjabi music had all come from the Punjab, but there was a small Bhangra community in its infancy which was gaining popularity quite quickly. This was led by artists such as Alaap Group, Heera Group, Apna Sangeet, A.S Kang and DCS. One day, while having dinner, a family friend Baldev Mastana who was a well-known music director in England asked Neeru to join his group The Saathi\u2019s.

When she began her career, it was very difficult for a female singer to receive any degree or measurable success as a stage artist in the male dominated environment of Punjabi music, however she was able to break through these barriers and gain considerable success. Neeru has performed in almost each and every town and city in Punjab. She has performed in New Zealand, Australia, Dubai, Singapore, Malaysia, Holland, England, Canada and America.
