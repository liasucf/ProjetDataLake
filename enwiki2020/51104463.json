He was most known for his thirteen-year spell at Benfica, where he the league titles. ==Career== Born in Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio, Rosa joined Benfica in 1937, making his debut on 8 May 1938 in a match against Acad\u00e9mica. It was his only appearance all season, as Amaro was undisputed starter. Nonetheless, it was enough for him to be a part of the league title. The following season, new signing Martins surpassed him and Amaro to take the goalkeeper position, holding it tightly for six seasons, with Rosa relegated to about handful of appearances. In 1944\u201345, he finally overtook Martins and played 21 games, 13 in the league, to help Benfica win the league. However, he could not retain his place in the next season, with Martins appearing again to be the first choice. In 1946 and then in 1947, Benfica signed Pinto Machado and Contreiras, which further complicated his opportunities to play. Still, in 1949\u201350, Rosa overtook them all to be the most used goalkeeper in the league, winning his third league title. ==Honours== ;Benfica *Primeira Divis\u00e3o: 1937\u201338, 1944\u201345, 1949\u201350 ==References== General * Specific Category:1917 births Category:Year of death missing Category:People from Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Primeira Liga players Category:S.L.
