    "text": "42nd Street is a 1933 American pre-Code musical film directed by Lloyd Bacon and starring Warner Baxter, Bebe Daniels, George Brent, Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell and Ginger Rogers. The choreography was staged by Busby Berkeley. The songs were written by Harry Warren (music) and Al Dubin (lyrics). The script was written by Rian James and James Seymour, with Whitney Bolton, who was not credited, from the 1932 novel of the same name by Bradford Ropes. This backstage musical was very successful at the box office and is now considered a classic by many. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1998, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2006, it ranked 13th on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. ==Plot== Una Merkel, Ruby Keeler and Ginger Rogers in 42nd Street It is 1932, the depth of the Depression, and noted Broadway producers Jones (Robert McWade) and Barry (Ned Sparks) are putting on Pretty Lady, a musical starring Dorothy Brock (Bebe Daniels). She is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon (Guy Kibbee), the show's \"angel\" (financial backer), but while she is busy keeping him both hooked and at arm's length, she is secretly seeing her old vaudeville partner, out-of- work Pat Denning (George Brent). Julian Marsh (Warner Baxter) is hired to direct, although his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite a long string of successes, he is broke, a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash, so he must make his last show a hit, in order to have enough money to retire. Cast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few \"casting couch\" innuendos flying around. Na\u00efve newcomer Peggy Sawyer (Ruby Keeler), who arrives in New York from her home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is duped and ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming (Una Merkel) and Ann \"Anytime Annie\" Lowell (Ginger Rogers), take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee (George E. Stone); she also sees to it that Ann and Peggy are chosen. The show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler (Dick Powell), takes an immediate liking to Peggy, as does Pat. Naive newcomer Peggy makes her first faux pas, antagonizing tough director Julian Marsh When Marsh learns about Dorothy's relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy (Tom Kennedy) to rough him up. That, plus her realization that their situation is unhealthy, makes Dorothy and Pat agree not to see each other for a while. He gets a stock job in Philadelphia. Rehearsals continue for five weeks, to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's opening in Philadelphia, when Dorothy breaks her ankle. By the next morning Abner has quarreled with her and wants Julian to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. She, however, tells him that she can't carry the show, but the inexperienced Peggy can. With 200 jobs and his future riding on the outcome, a desperate Julian rehearses Peggy mercilessly (vowing \"I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl\") until an hour before the premiere. Billy finally gets up the nerve to tell Peggy he loves her; she enthusiastically kisses him. Then Dorothy shows up and wishes her luck, telling her that she and Pat are getting married. The show goes on, and the last twenty minutes of the film are devoted to three Busby Berkeley production numbers: \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", \"(I'm) Young and Healthy\", and \"42nd Street\". The show is a hit. As the theater audience comes out, Julian stands in the shadows, hearing the comments that Peggy is a star and he (Marsh) does not deserve the credit for it.Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub. Hal Leonard Corporation page 20 Plot note In the original Bradford Ropes novel, Julian and Billy are lovers. Since same- sex relationships were unacceptable in films by the moral standards of the era, the film substituted a romance between Billy and Peggy. ==Cast== * Warner Baxter as Julian Marsh * Bebe Daniels as Dorothy Brock * George Brent as Pat Denning * Ruby Keeler as Peggy Sawyer * Guy Kibbee as Abner Dillon * Una Merkel as Lorraine Fleming * Ginger Rogers as Ann Lowell (aka \"Anytime Annie\")Clip of first reference to Ginger Rogers' character as \"Anytime Annie\", a pre-Code element in 42nd Street (1933 film) on YouTube * Ned Sparks as Barry * Dick Powell as Billy Lawler * Allen Jenkins as Mac Elroy, the stage manager * Edward J.

The shooting schedule ran for 28 days at the Warner Bros. studio in Burbank, California. The total cost of making it has been estimated to be $340,000\u2013$439,000.IMDb Business Data for \"42nd Street\"TCM \"42nd Street\" (1933) Overview ==Musical numbers== All songs have music by Harry Warren and lyrics by Al Dubin.IMDb Soundtracks * \"You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me\" \u2013 sung by Bebe Daniels () * \"It Must Be June\" \u2013 sung by Bebe Daniels, Dick Powell and the chorus * \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\" Song Clip \u2013 sung and danced by Ruby Keeler and Clarence Nordstrom, with Ginger Rogers, Una Merkel and the chorus, () * \"Young and Healthy\" \u2013 sung by Dick Powell to Toby Wing and the chorus, () * \"42nd Street\" \u2013 sung and danced by Ruby Keeler, and sung by Dick Powell () The \"Love Theme\", written by Harry Warren, is played under scenes between Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, and Bebe Daniels and George Brent. It has no title or lyrics, and is unpublished. The music playing during dance rehearsals and the opening of the show is an instrumental piano piece that Harry Warren wrote, titled \"Pretty Lady.\" A special patter with different music was written for the song \"Forty-Second Street\" and the production number of same, with music by Warren and lyrics by Dubin. It was cut for unknown reasons from the finished film, but an unpublished manuscript of this still exists. Though the songs of 42nd Street all allude to sex, there is a single moment at the end of \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", when one word of the scripted lyrics, \"belly\", was changed to \"tummy\" presumedly to comply with the then weakly enforced Motion Picture Production Code of 1930. But in making the change, the filmmakers purposely drew attention to the censored word. During the last two verses, Una Merkel & Ginger Rogers sing about a traveling salesman who impregnates the farmer's daughter, and then is forced into a shotgun wedding. The lyric as scripted is: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his belly...\" But as Ginger sings it, Una gestures to her and she changes the last word: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his bel - - tummy\". ==Reception and legacy== The film premiered in New York on March 9, 1933 at the Strand Theatre, and went into general release two days later, becoming one of the most profitable ones of the year, bringing in an estimated gross of $2,300,000, equal to $ today. It received Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Sound Recording, and was named one of the 10 Best Films of 1933 by Film Daily.TCM \"42nd Street\" (1933) NotesIMDb Awards for \"42nd Street\" (1933)AllMovieGuide 42nd Street Awards Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called the film \"invariably entertaining\" and, \"The liveliest and one of the most tuneful screen musical comedies that has come out of Hollywood\". The New York World-Telegram described it as \"A sprightly entertainment, combining, as it did, a plausible enough story of back-stage life, some excellent musical numbers and dance routines and a cast of players that are considerably above the average found in screen musicals.\" \"Every element is professional and convincing\", wrote Variety. \"It'll socko the screen musical fans with the same degree that Metro's pioneering screen musicals did.\" John Mosher of The New Yorker called it \"a bright movie\" with \"as pretty a little fantasy of Broadway as you may hope to see\", and praised Baxter's performance as \"one of the best he has given us\", though he described the plot as \"the most conventional one to be found in such doings.\" Warner already had a follow-up of sorts \u2013 Gold Diggers of 1933 \u2013 in production before the film's release, and the success of both films permitted a higher budget and more elaborate production numbers in Warner's next follow-up, Footlight Parade. By the time of Busby Berkeley's death in 1976, the film had become revered as the archetypal backstage musical, the one that \"gave life to the clich\u00e9s that have kept parodists happy\", as critic Pauline Kael wrote. ===Box office=== According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $1,438,000 domestically and $843,000 abroad. ==Awards and honors== A tracking shot between dancers' legs Academy Award nominations * Best Picture * Best Sound \u2013 Nathan Levinson American Film Institute recognition * 2004 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs: ** \"42nd Street\", # 97 * 2005 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes: ** \"Sawyer, you're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!\", # 87 * 2006 \u2013 AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals \u2013 # 13 ==See also== * 42nd Street, the Broadway musical * 42nd Street, the actual street in New York City ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:1933 films Category:1930s romantic musical films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American romantic musical films Category:Films about musical theatre Category:Films adapted into plays Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on romance novels Category:Films directed by Lloyd Bacon Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Films produced by Darryl F.
