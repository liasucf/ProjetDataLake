    "text": "1919 Eternal (also stylized as 1919\u2605Eternal) is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Black Label Society. It was released on March 5, 2002 and was written for Zakk Wylde's father. ==Writing== Five songs from the album sessions were written by Zakk Wylde for Ozzy Osbourne's album Down to Earth. Ozzy rejected the songs because they were \"too Black Label\", so Zakk kept them for this album. The songs were \"Bleed for Me\", \"Life, Birth, Blood, Doom\", \"Demise of Sanity\", an alternate piano version of \"Bridge to Cross\", and a demo presumably called \"I'll Find the Way\". The latter two were never released. These original demo songs featured drummer Christian Werr, a friend of Zakk's who happened to be in the right place at the right time to record the tracks. Later, when Zakk went to re-record these demos for 1919 Eternal, Christian's drum tracks were used for \"Bleed for Me\", \"Life, Birth, Blood, Doom\", and \"Demise of Sanity\", which is why Craig Nunenmacher does not appear on these songs. ==Artwork== The album artwork is based on a German Nazi propaganda poster used to recruit Dutchmen into the Schutzstaffel (SS). ==Track listing== All songs written by Zakk Wylde, except \"America the Beautiful\" by Katharine Lee Bates and Samuel A. Ward. #\"Bleed for Me\" \u2013 5:31 #\"Lords of Destruction\" \u2013 5:11 #\"Demise of Sanity\" \u2013 3:23 #\"Life, Birth, Blood, Doom\" \u2013 4:21 #\"Bridge to Cross\" \u2013 5:49 #\"Battering Ram\" \u2013 2:22 #\"Speedball\" \u2013 0:58 #\"Graveyard Disciples\" \u2013 3:20 #\"Genocide Junkies\" \u2013 5:53 #\"Lost Heaven\" \u2013 4:24 #\"Refuse to Bow Down\" \u2013 4:53 #\"Mass Murder Machine\" \u2013 5:47 #\"Berserkers\" \u2013 5:06 #\"America the Beautiful\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:17 #\"Llabdeeps\" (Japanese bonus track) \u2013 1:00* Note: The 15th track is an unlabeled bonus track on the Japanese edition of the album, \"Speedball\" reversed. ==Credits== *Zakk Wylde \u2013 vocals, guitars, bass *Robert Trujillo \u2013 bass (\"Demise of Sanity\" and \"Life, Birth, Blood, Doom\") *Craig Nunenmacher \u2013 drums ==Additional personnel== *Christian Werr \u2013 drums (tracks 1, 3, 4) ;Production *Produced by Zakk Wylde *Associate producer \u2013 Eddie Mapp *Engineered by Eddie Mapp and Sam Storey, assisted by Lou Michaels and Kent Hitchcock *Editing by Kent Huffnagle *Mastered by Ron Boustead *Management \u2013 Bob Ringe (Survival Management) *A&R; \u2013 Paul Bibeau, Tami Fukatami *Art concept \u2013 Zakk Wylde *Art direction and design \u2013 Zakk Wylde and Peter Tsakiris (Drunken Monkey Studios) *Illustrations \u2013 Adam Guyot (Eternal Art Tattoo, Canyon County, CA) *Photography \u2013 Maryanne Bilham ==References== ==Additional Sources== * Category:Black Label Society albums Category:2002 albums Category:Spitfire Records albums ",
