The name is derived from the curving browned lower edge which resembles a potato. It is also called galletas de huevos (\"egg crackers\") due to the use of egg-white glazing, or tengang daga (\"mouse ears\") due to its shape. ==See also== *Galletas del Carmen *Galletas pesquera *Roscas == References == Category:Philippine pastries Category:Biscuits ",
