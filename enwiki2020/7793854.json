    "text": "Rownd a Rownd () is a Welsh soap opera created by Rondo Media (formally Ffilmiau\u2019r Nant) and shown on S4C since 11 September 1995. It was claimed to be the first Celtic-related language soap specifically directed at a youth audience. It is set in the fictional harbour town of Glanrafon in Anglesey. At its inception, the soap was targeted towards an adolescent and young adult audience, but it now has broadened its appeal to all age groups. It has famously covered many taboo subjects ranging from arson to cancer. Beginning with a small cast of characters, the serial now has upwards of forty cast members. The soap is consistently in the top 20 most watched programmes of the week on S4C. The show currently averages around twenty thousand viewers per episode. Two episodes are produced each week. Since February 2020 these have been broadcast at 20:25 on Tuesdays and Thursdays (with the previous episode being repeated at 18:30). In addition, a weekly omnibus with in-vision English language subtitles airs on Sunday daytime. Every summer Rownd a Rownd takes a two month seasonal break; finishing in mid July and re-starting in September to coincide with the new season. ==Background== Rownd a Rownd was first broadcast in September 1995 and was originally based on young people who did a paper round\"Pen-blwydd Rownd a Rownd\", BBC Cymru Fyw (in Welsh), 9 September 2016. Retrieved 8 December 2016. (hence the programme's title, based on the wheels of a bicycle). It has since grown to include both their daily school life and their family life. Phil Redmond, creator of Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks, acted as a consultant to the series on its launch in 1995, and again on its tenth anniversary. Rownd a Rownd also has a presence on social networking sites Facebook, Twitter and Instagram on which they post weekly. In 2016, it celebrated its 21st birthday, with S4C broadcasting an anniversary special hosted by Tudur Owen. ==Production== alt=refer to caption The series is filmed in Menai Bridge, Anglesey and Caernarfon, North Wales, and is produced by Rondo Media (previously known as Nant Films). When it began, the production company converted a disused garage in Dale Street (Welsh name: \"L\u00f4n Cilbedlam\") in Menai Bridge into a fake row of shops, which include a caf\u00e9, a hairdresser, a newsagent, a taxi firm, a pizza place and a bar. There is a sign outside this set informing the public that the shops are not real. School scenes are filmed in Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni and Ysgol David Hughes. Hospital scenes are often filmed in nearby Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, usually in one of the staff hostels. The soap also regularly makes use of incidental music in their program. On 18 March 2020 it was announced that filming for Rownd a Rownd would be suspended in the light of the spread of COVID-19. Filming resumed in August 2020 with social distancing guidelines in place. The show's cast were required to do their own hair and make-up, which is normally done by a make-up artist. Two additional filming sites were also added to Rownd a Rownd's set in Menai Bridge in order to keep people sufficiently apart. These are located in near-by towns Caernarfon and Llangefni. ==Cast== This includes characters who have been in the habit of returning after a long absence. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width:170px;\"|Character ! style=\"width:130px;\"|Actor ! style=\"width:70px;\" |Duration ! style=\"width:600px;\"|Details |- |Jim \"Gym\" Williams || Iestyn Garlick || 1995\u2013 || Former physical education teacher.
