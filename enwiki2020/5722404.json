    "text": "Arute Field is a 5,500-seat multi-purpose stadium in New Britain, Connecticut, United States. It is home to the Central Connecticut State University Blue Devils Football and Men's and Women's Lacrosse teams. The first incarnation of Arute Field was on land now occupied by the Elihu Burritt Library. The field was moved to its current location in the late 1960s. Jack Arute, Sr., the owner of what was then one of the state's largest construction businesses, built the first field to bear his family's name. The second incarnation of the stadium was built in 1970 and demolished in 1998. The third and current version of the stadium was built on the same site of the second one, and opened in November 2000. Before the 2012 season, 2,500 seats were added to the east side of the stadium as well as a new state-of-the-art video board. ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I FCS football stadiums ==References== ==External links== *Central Connecticut State Blue Devils - Arute Field Category:Buildings and structures in New Britain, Connecticut Category:College football venues Category:College lacrosse venues in the United States Category:Central Connecticut Blue Devils football Category:American football venues in Connecticut Category:Lacrosse venues in Connecticut Category:Multi- purpose stadiums in the United States Category:Sports venues in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Ultimate (sport) venues Category:2000 establishments in Connecticut Category:Sports venues completed in 2000 ",
