    "text": "The G20 developing nations (and, occasionally, the G21, G23 or G20+) is a bloc of developing nations established on 20 August 2003. Distinct and separate from the G20 major economies, the group emerged at the 5th Ministerial WTO conference, held in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, from 10 September to 14 September 2003. The group accounted for 60% of the world's population, 70% of its farmers and 26% of world\u2019s agricultural exports. == History == Its origins date back to June 2003, when foreign ministers from Brazil, India and South Africa signed a declaration known as the Brasilia Declaration, on June 6, 2003.IBSA \u2013 trilateral, developmental initiative between India, Brazil and South Africa in which they stated that \"major trading partners are still moved by protectionist concerns in their countries\u2019 less competitive sectors [...] and emphasized how important it is that the results of the current round of trade negotiations provide especially for the reversal of protectionist policies and trade-distorting practices [...] Furthermore, Brazil, India and South Africa decided to articulate their initiatives of trade liberalization\". Nonetheless, the \"official\" appearance of the group occurred as a response to a text released on 13 August 2003 by the European Communities (EC) and the United States with a common proposal on agriculture for the Canc\u00fan Ministerial. On 20 August 2003 a document signed by twenty countries and re-issued as a Canc\u00fan Ministerial document on 4 September proposed an alternative framework to that of the EC and the US on agriculture for the Canc\u00fan Meeting. This document marked the establishment of the group. The original group of signatories of the 20 August 2003 document went through many changes, being known as such different names as the G-21 or the G-22. The title G-20 was finally chosen, in honor of the date of the group's establishment. Since its creation, the group had a fluctuating membership. Previous members include: Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Turkey. In December 2017, the group had 23 members. == References == == External links == *G20 press release on 19th of March, 2005 (includes the group's logo). *G20, the developing country coalition in Focus on Trade 98, April 2004. *The G - 20: Aims and Perspectives of a New Trade Alliance at dissertation.com (Universal Publishers). * Category:Intergovernmental organizations Category:2003 in economics Category:Countries by international organization Category:Investment Category:International development Category:Organizations established in 2003 ",
