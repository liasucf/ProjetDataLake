    "text": "Symphonische Ges\u00e4nge, Op. 20 () is a collection of small songs for baritone or alto and orchestra composed in 1929 by Austrian composer Alexander von Zemlinsky. == Composition == A Jew with Muslim and Catholic ancestry, Zemlinsky composed the Symphonische Ges\u00e4nge in 1929 using an evocative musical language, since his direct experience with African societies and music was limited. However, the plight of black Americans was appealing to many Viennese Jews, among them Zemlinsky, which was representative of the post-World War I situation in both Germany and Austria. The Ges\u00e4nge were composed using texts extracted from a Viennese anthology of poems from the Harlem Renaissance, entitled Afrika Singt (), published by Anna Nussbaum the same year the Ges\u00e4nge were finished. The set was dedicated to the memory of Zemlinsky's wife Ida von Zemlinsky. The text was edited by Wilhelm Grosz and translated by Jean Forman. This composition was premiered in Brno on April 8th, 1935 and was later published in 1977 by Universal Edition. == Structure == This set features a total of seven songs written in German and has a total duration of 18 minutes. The song list is as follows: This composition is scored for a large orchestra made up of one piccolo, two flutes, three oboes, one cor anglais, one clarinet in E-flat, two clarinets in B-flat, one bass clarinet in B-flat, two bassoons, one contrabassoon, two horns in F, three trumpets in C, three trombones, one bass tuba, timpani, a percussion section for two percussionists, a mandolin and a string section. Like other works from the same period such as his String Quartet No. 3 and his opera Der Kreidekreis, Zemlinsky relies on tight motivic cells, static ostinato patterns and the Neue Sachlichkeit restraint. The austere, Berg-like pared-down style is far from the jazzy, rhythmic \"swing\" he used in some other compositions from his period, developed after having conducted Ernst Krenek's Jonny spielt auf and Kurt Weill's Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny, two operas that incorporate elements of jazz into their musical idiom. == Recordings == Following is a list of some of the most notable recordings of this composition: {|class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Conductor !align=\"center\"|Orchestra !align=\"center\"|Baritone (or alto) !align=\"center\"|Label !align=\"center\"|Year of Recording |- |align=\"center\"|Riccardo Chailly |align=\"center\"|Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra |align=\"center\"|Willard White |align=\"center\"|Decca Records |align=\"center\"|1993 |} == References == Category:Compositions by Alexander von Zemlinsky Category:1929 compositions ",
