    "text": "William Berger, also known as Bill Berger and Wilhelm Berger, born Wilhelm Thomas Berger (June 20, 1928 \u2013 October 2, 1993) was an Austrian American actor, mostly associated with Euro and spaghetti Westerns, as well as travel documentaries. ==Biography== ===Career=== Berger in Faccia a faccia (1967) A former roommate of Keith Richards, his earliest work was in Broadway theatre, but while visiting Italy, he was cast in his first Western, Break Up, in 1965. A series of Westerns followed, including Faccia a faccia (1967), Today We Kill, Tomorrow We Die! (1968), If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death (1968), Sabata (1969), and Keoma (1975). He also starred in the horror films Five Dolls for an August Moon, My Dear Killer, Monster Shark, and The Murder Clinic. Berger was heavily into drug experimentation, which frequent co-star Brett Halsey said sometimes interfered with filming, recounting one incident where they were shooting a scene on horseback and without warning Berger leant forwards and slid off his horse. In the early 1970s, Berger spent some time in an Italian prison, having been wrongly accused of possession of hashish and cocaine, but resumed his acting career after his release. His later fare included Super Fly T.N.T. (1973), Oil! (1977), Hercules (1983), and The King's Whore (1990). His 1985 memoirs, Half Way Home, recount his life to that point. Berger collaborated with his good friend, famed Spanish horror film director Jesus Franco, appearing in seven of his films: The Sinister Eyes of Dr. Orloff, Night of the Killers, Faceless, Golden Temple Amazons, Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun, Dirty Game in Casablanca, and A Captain of 15 Years. ==Personal life== William Berger was married five times and was father to five children. He had three children with his first wife Marjorie Berger: daughters Carin Berger (born in 1952) and actress Debra Berger (born March 17, 1957), and son Wendell Nelson Berger (born December 28, 1972). After his marriage to Marjorie ended, he married actress Carolyn Lobravico. While Berger was busy with the filming of The Murder Clinic, Carolyn was arrested for drug possession. A diabetic, she died in prison from lack of insulin. His third marriage was to singer and actress Hanja Kochansky. They had one child together, son Kasimir Berger (born in London on October 7, 1974). Berger was also stepfather to actress Katya Berger, daughter of Hanja Kochansky from a previous relationship. Berger starred with his son Kasimir in the TV miniseries Christopher Columbus and Tuareg \u2013 The Desert Warrior. After his divorce from Kochansky, he married his fourth wife, D\u00f6rte V\u00f6lz. With her, he had a son named Alexander V\u00f6lz. His fifth and last marriage was to Linda Berger. William Berger died on October 2, 1993 in Los Angeles, California, of prostate cancer. Jesus Franco was particularly upset by his passing, speaking of his grief in various interviews. ==Selected filmography== *Back Street (1961) - Airport Attendant (uncredited) *Von Ryan's Express (1965) - Man from the Gestapo (uncredited) *Break Up (1965) - Benny (segment \"L'uomo dei 5 palloni\") (uncredited) *Ringo's Big Night (1966) - Jack Balman / Ringo *The Murder Clinic (1966) - Dr. Robert Vance *Cisco (1966) - El Cisco *A Bullet for the General (1967) - Bill 'Ni\u00f1o' Tate (English version, voice, uncredited) *Her Harem (1967) - Mario *The Day the Fish Came Out (1967) - Man in Bed *Face to Face (1967) - Charley 'Chas' A.
