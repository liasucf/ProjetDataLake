    "text": "Michael Snow (born December 10, 1928) is a Canadian artist working in a range of media including film, installation, sculpture, photography, and music. His best-known films are Wavelength (1967) and La R\u00e9gion Centrale (1971), with the former regarded as a milestone in avant-garde cinema. ==Life== Michael Snow was born in Toronto and studied at Upper Canada College and the Ontario College of Art. He had his first solo exhibition in 1957. In the early 1960s Snow moved to New York with his wife, artist Joyce Wieland, where they remained for nearly a decade. For Snow this move resulted in a proliferation of creative ideas and connections and his work increasingly gained recognition. He returned to Canada in the early 1970s \"an established figure, multiply defined as a visual artist, a filmmaker, and a musician.\" His work has appeared at exhibitions across Europe, North America and South America. Snows' works were included in the shows marking the reopening of both the Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2000 and the MoMA in New York in 2005. In March 2006, his works were included in the Whitney Biennial. ==Work== ===Films=== Snow is considered one of the most influential experimental filmmakers. Annette Michelson, in writing about Snow, his 1967 film Wavelength, and his films in general, speaks of the impact of Snow's films, placing viewers in a \"position to more fully understand the particular impact of Snow's filmic work from 1967 on, to discern the reasons for the large consensus given\" to Wavelength when it was honoured with the Grand Prize at the 1967 Experimental Film Festival EXPRMNTL 4 in Knokke, Belgium, and that \"Wavelength, [appears] as a celebration of the 'apparatus' and a confirmation of the status of the subject, and it is in those terms that we may begin to comprehend the profound effect it had upon the broadest spectrum of viewers....\" Michelson, \"About Snow\" October Vol. 8 (Spring, 1979): 118. Wavelength has been the subject of numerous retrospectives internationally. Film scholar Scott MacDonald says of Snow that \"[f]ew filmmakers have had as large an impact on the recent avant- garde film scene as Canadian Michael Snow, whose Wavelength is probably the most frequently discussed 'structural' film.\"Scott MacDonald, \"So Is This by Michael Snow\" Film Quarterly Vol. 39, No. 1 (Autumn, 1985): 34. Wavelength has been designated and preserved as a masterwork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada and was named #85 in the 2001 Village Voice critics' list of the 100 Best Films of the 20th Century . Snow's films have premiered in film festivals worldwide and five of his films have premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). In 2000, TIFF commissioned Snow, along with Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg, to make a series of short films collectively titled Preludes, for the 25th Anniversary of the festival. In his Village Voice review of Snow's 2002 film *Corpus Callosum, J. Hoberman writes that Snow's films are \"[r]igorously predicated on irreducible cinematic facts [and] Snow's structuralist epics\u2014Wavelength and La R\u00e9gion Centrale\u2014[announce] the imminent passing of the film era. Rich with new possibilities, *Corpus Callosum heralds the advent of the next. Whatever it is, it cannot be too highly praised.\" *Corpus Calossum was screened at the Toronto, Berlin, Rotterdam, and the Los Angeles film festivals amongst others. In January 2003, Snow won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Douglas Edwards Experimental/Independent Film/Video Award for *Corpus Callosum. Tied with Kenneth Anger \"for his body of work\". ===Music=== Originally a professional jazz musician, Snow has a long-standing interest in improvised music, as indicated by the soundtrack to his film New York Eye and Ear Control. As a pianist, he has performed solo and with other musicians in North America, Europe and Japan. Snow performs regularly in Canada and internationally, often with the improvisational music ensemble CCMC and has released more than a half dozen albums since the mid-1970s. In 1987, Snow issued The Last LP (Art Metropole), which purported to be a documentary recording of the dying gasps of ethnic musical cultures from around the globe including Tibet, Syria, India, China, Brazil, Finland and elsewhere, with more thousands of words of pseudo-scholarly supplementary notes, but was, in fact, a series of multi- tracked recordings of Snow himself, who gave the joke away only in a single column of text in the disc's gatefold jacket, printed backwards and readable in a mirror. One track, purported to be a document of a coming-of-age ritual from Niger, is a pastiche of Whitney Houston's song \"How Will I Know.\" Snow, with Richard Serra, James Tenney and Bruce Nauman, performed Steve Reich's Pendulum Music on May 27, 1969 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. ===Other media=== Canada geese in flight. Before Snow moved to New York in 1961, he began a long-term project that for six years would be his trademark: the Walking Woman. Martha Langford in Michael Snow: Life & Work describes this work as employing a single form that offered an infinite number of creative possibilities, the figure itself perceived variably as \"a positive (a presence to be looked at) and a negative (an absence to be looked through).\" Langford identifies duality as a guiding principle in Snow\u2019s work. By combining materials and methods Snow creates hybrid objects that often defy classification. A work which exemplifies Snow's testing of stylistic boundaries is his 1979 installation Flight Stop (also titled Flightstop), a site-specific work in Toronto's Eaton Centre mall, which looks like a sculptural representation of sixty geese, but is in fact an intricate combination of fibreglass forms and photographs of a single goose. In 1982, Snow sued the corporate owner of the Toronto Eaton Centre for violating his moral rights by altering Flight Stop. In the landmark case Snow v Eaton Centre Ltd, the Ontario High Court of Justice affirmed the artist's right to the integrity of their work. The operator of the Toronto Eaton Centre was found liable for violating Michael Snow's moral rights by putting Christmas bows on the work.(1982), 70 CPR (2d) 105. Snow's works have been in Canadian pavilion at world fairs since his Walking Women sculpture was exhibited at Expo 67 in Montr\u00e9al. His recent bookwork BIOGRAPHIE of the Walking Woman / de la femme qui marche 1961-1967 (2004) was published in Brussels by La Lettre vole. It consists of images of the public appearances of his globally famous icon. Anarchive2: Digital Snow describes Michael Snow as \"one of the most significant artists in contemporary art and cinema of the past 50 years.\" This 2002 DVD was initiated by Paris\u2019 Centre Pompidou and was produced with the support of la foundation Daniel Langlois, Universit\u00e9 de Paris, Heritage Canada, the Canada Council, T\u00e9l\u00e9film Canada and Montreal\u2019s \u00c9poxy. It is an encyclopedia of Snow's works across media, browsed in a manner inimitably and artfully created by Snow. Its 4,685 entries include film clips, sculpture, photographs, audio and musical clips, and interviews. ==Retrospectives and honours== In the background you can see multiple stadium sculptures on the eastern side of Skydome Rogers Centre. Michael Snow's sculpture 'Red, Orange and Green' (1992) at Rogers Building (Canada) In 1993, The Michael Snow Project, lasting several months, was a multivenue retrospective of Snow\u2019s works in Toronto exhibited at several public venues and at the Art Gallery of Ontario and The Power Plant. Concurrently his works were the subjects of four books published by Alfred A. Knopf Canada. Snow has shown internationally in both galleries and cinemas, including a retrospective of his work at the British Film Institute, London where his celluloid works where shown in the cinemas and his digital works in the gallery (The BFI Gallery). The project, titled 'Yes Snow Show', took place in 2009 and was co-curated by Elisabetta Fabrizi and Chris Meigh-Andrew.Fabrizi, Elisabetta 'The BFI Gallery Book', BFI, London 2011. In 1981, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2007 \"for his contributions to international visual arts as one of Canada\u2019s greatest multidisciplinary contemporary artists\". He received the first Governor General\u2019s Award in Visual and Media Arts (2000) for cinema. In 2004, the Universit\u00e9 de Paris I, Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne awarded him an honorary doctorate. The last artist so awarded was Pablo Picasso. In 2006, Lima's Museum of Art (MALI) held a selective retrospective exhibition as well as a screening of his films in Peru, as part of the Vide/Art/Electronic Festival. ===Honorary degrees=== Universit\u00e9 de Paris I, Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne (2004), Emily Carr Institute, Vancouver (2004) Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax (1990), University of Toronto (1999), University of Victoria (1997), Brock University (1975). ===Academic appointments=== * Visiting Artist/Professor at MAPS (Master of Art in Public Sphere), Ecole Cantonale d\u2019Art du Valais, Sierre, Switzerland (February 2005, January 2006) * Visiting Artist/Professor at L\u2019\u00e9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019Art de Bourges, France.

Some of these sequences one might possibly glimpse in the windows of a sophisticated hotel, condo, spa and parking garage building, but many sequences are \"impossible,\" e.g. in one sequence fish swim from window to window. This installation was opened as an official event of the Toronto International Film Festival September 2006. * Flight Stop - Toronto Eaton Centre a collection of life sized Canada geese in flight hanging over the main section of the mall.
