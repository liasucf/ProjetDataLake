She was the wife of painter Eug\u00e8ne Goyet and daughter-in-law of painter Jean- Baptiste Goyet. ==Career== Zo\u00e9 Goyet was a direct descendant of the influential Parisian art dealer and engraver Jean Mariette.Audiffred, Hyacinthe. \"N\u00e9crologie: Eug\u00e8ne Goyet\", Revue des Beaux-Arts, tome 8, 1857, pp. 237-8. Her marriage to Eug\u00e8ne Goyet brought her into the household and atelier he shared with his father, Jean-Baptiste Goyet, at 3 Rue de l'Abbaye in Paris. All three were artists, exhibiting their works at the prestigious annual Paris Salon and exhibitions in other cities in France. Zo\u00e9 exhibited portraits at the Salon from 1834 to 1839 and in 1841; she received a medal in 1837.Auvray, Louis. Dictionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des artistes de l'\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise, 1882-1885, p. 684. In 1838 she painted a portrait of the popular novelist Michel Masson that was widely reproduced in his books.Coyecque, Ernest. Collection Parent de Rosan: inventaire des estampes, tome 1, p. 424. In 1837, after the Goyets moved to 25 Rue de la Chaus\u00e9e-D'Antin, they set up their studios next door at number 27, where Eug\u00e8ne and Zo\u00e9 also taught drawing and painting to female students.Le Charivari, 24 December 1837 p. 7. At least one graduate of her atelier exhibited at the Paris Salon, in 1864.Veuve Victoire-Ad\u00e8le Keuler, \"\u00e9l\u00e8ve de Mme. Goyet,\" Explication des Ouvrages de Peinture et Dessins, Sculpture, Architecture et Gravure des Artistes Vivans, aux Palais des \u00c9lys\u00e9es, 1864, p. 599. Eug\u00e8ne Goyet died in 1857. In 1859, Zo\u00e9 Goyet completed her husband's final commission\u2014of a painting of Christ at Calvary, for La chapelle Notre-Dame du Calvaire, Garbriac, Averyon, France\u2014marking the end of over three decades in which the three Goyets played a prominent role in the world of French art. Zo\u00e9 died in 1869. ==Gallery== File:Zoe Goyet--Portrait of a well-dressed man--signed--Swann Gallery 2019.jpg|Undated and untitled portrait, private collection.If this work is authentically by Goyet, it may noted that she here signs her first name with a diaeresis (Zo\u00eb) rather than an accent aigu (Zo\u00e9), as it is uniformly found in contemporary printed sources.left File:Zoe Goyet--Marechal-Kellermann.jpg|Portrait of Fran\u00e7ois Christophe de Kellermann, Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e, Paris File:Zo\u00e9 Goyet--Christ at Calvary--La chapelle Notre-Dame du Calvaire, Gabriac, Aveyron, France-- 1859.jpg|Christ at Calvary, La chapelle Notre-Dame du Calvaire, Gabriac, Aveyron, France (1859) File:Gabriac chapelle ND du Calvaire.jpg|La chapelle Notre-Dame du Calvaire, Gabriac, Averyon, France ==References== Category:1869 deaths Category:French painters Category:Year of birth missing Category:19th- century French painters Category:19th-century French women artists ",
