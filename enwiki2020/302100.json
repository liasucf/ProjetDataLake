    "text": "Sorrell Booke (January 4, 1930 \u2013 February 11, 1994) was an American actor who performed on stage, screen, and television. He acted in more than 100 plays and 150 television shows, and is best known for his role as corrupt politician Jefferson Davis \"Boss\" Hogg in the television show The Dukes of Hazzard. ==Early life and education== Booke was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of Dr. Sol Booke, a local physician. As a child, he entertained patients in his father's waiting room, and began acting on radio at nine As a young radio actor he was known for his impersonations. He won a radio contest for mimicking the voice of Adolf Hitler, and appeared regularly as an actor on local radio stations WGR and WEBR.He attended Bennett High School and was valedictorian of the Class of 1946. Booke enrolled in Columbia University at 16, and performed in Shakespearean plays in Columbia's drama club. He graduated from Columbia at 19 in 1949, and received a Master of Fine Arts at the Yale School of Drama. He served in the United States Army during the Korean War for two years as a counterintelligence officer. ==Career== After his Army service, Booke appeared off-Broadway in The White Devil and had his first television role in the series Omnibus. His Broadway debut was in 1956, in Michael Redgrave's production of The Sleeping Prince. One prominent early role was that of Senator Billboard T. Rawkins in the 1960 revival of Finian's Rainbow. He also appeared in the films Black Like Me, A Fine Madness, and Fail-Safe. In 1962, he starred in the Broadway musical Fiorello! as the title character. Aside from his film roles he appeared on television, among them ABC's 12 O-Clock High, and he worked as a voice actor in the 1980s and early 1990s. Booke also was a guest conductor at the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. Booke earned an Emmy nomination for his appearance in Dr. Kildare in the episode \"What's God to Julius?\". He appeared in an episode of Mission: Impossible from the first season in 1966. Booke appeared in two early episodes of M*A*S*H, as General Barker in \"Requiem for a Lightweight\" and \"Chief Surgeon Who?\"; the latter marked the debut of the character Corporal Klinger, with whom Booke's character had previously dealt. He also had a recurring role in All in the Family as Mr. Sanders, personnel manager at Archie Bunker's workplace, Prendergast Tool and Die Company. (He had previously appeared on All in the Family as Lyle Bennett, the manager of a local television station.) Booke was featured on an episode of Good Times, and had a recurring role as the Jewish mob boss \"Lefkowitz\" on Soap. ===The Dukes of Hazzard (1979\u20131985)=== Booke's most notable role was in The Dukes of Hazzard as the humorously wicked antagonist to Bo and Luke Duke. The series ran on CBS for seven seasons, from 1979 to 1985 and spawned an animated series, The Dukes (1983), two reunion TV specials (by which time Booke had died, and the character of Boss Hogg was also said to be deceased), a feature film (2005) and The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning (a 2007 TV movie). Booke had stopped appearing physically in acting roles, but he continued to perform voice work on several television shows and movies, occasionally as narrator, and sometimes as a cartoon character's voice, in such movies as Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers (1987 TV movie), Gravedale High (1990 television series), and Rock-A-Doodle (1991). ==Personal life== Booke was five feet six inches tall and 185 pounds at the time of his Boss Hogg role, and wore padding to seem fatter. He copied the Hogg character's drawl from U.S. senators Sam Erwin and Strom Thurmond. He claimed fluency in French, Japanese, Spanish, Russian and Italian, and said that he \"fusses\" with a half-dozen other languages. One of his hobbies was moving into and restoring rundown houses. In 1981, he lived in a \"modest home on a modest street in Los Angeles,\" where he did his own gardening and carpentry. He called his Boss Hogg character \"despicable,\" but enjoyed meeting with fans of the show. Booke was married to Miranda Knickerbocker, then a senior at Barnard College, in 1958. She was the daughter of journalist Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker. They divorced in 1973. ===Death=== On February 11, 1994, Booke died of colorectal cancer in Sherman Oaks, California. He is interred at the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. He was survived by a brother, two children, Alexandra and Nicholas, and one grandson. ==Partial filmography== *Gone Are the Days!
