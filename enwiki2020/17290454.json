Clapham Rovers were one of the twenty-one London and suburban football clubs that followed Rugby School rules that assembled at the Pall Mall Restaurant in Regent Street and formed the Rugby Football Union on 26 January 1871 and Birkett was not only present but also became one of the thirteen original committee members. Birkett was selected for the first international rugby match for England vs Scotland in 1871.

Despite conceding four goals, he was on the winning side, England prevailing 5\u20134. The following year, Clapham Rovers once again made it to the FA Cup final.
