When the house was first built there were a few trees and a small hedge surrounding the front lawn of the house.Hall, Percival, \u201cThe Complete Sorority House: Sigma Tau\u2019s New House at Washington State College,\u201d The Angelos of Kappa Delta, May, 1936, 210-14. Today, the hedge no longer exists and there are no longer small trees on the lawn but instead large maple trees on the sidewalk surrounding the lawn.

The large lawn and lack of trees creates an openness around the house. ==Design== The current house was contracted by Howard S.
