Jeffery & Co and originally designed for use in rook rifles for hunting small game and target shooting. It gained an excellent reputation for accuracy and was widely used for target shooting before being superseded by the .22 Long Rifle as a miniature target round, and it was also chambered in some single- shot pistols.
