He was a Western movie star married to actress Clara Bow, and the 21st Lieutenant Governor of Nevada. ==Film career== Bell made his film debut in Wild West Romance in 1928, and went on to act in a number of films, mostly Westerns, in which he had the lead role. He left the movie industry in 1936, although he had generally small roles in a few later films. In 1931, Bell and his wife, actress Clara Bow, founded the Walking Box Ranch, at Searchlight, Nevada. His final film appearance was a brief cameo as a cowboy in John Huston's film The Misfits (1961), which was shot on location in Nevada. He appeared in the film with actress Marilyn Monroe, who died a month after Bell in the summer of 1962. ==Political career== In 1944, Bell ran for the United States House of Representatives on the Republican ticket against Democrat Berkeley Bunker. The Nevada State Journal commented on November 1: \"He has made friends where ever he appeared, but consensus is that the time is too short to overcome a handicap of not being so well known as his opponent\".Nevada State Journal, November 1, 1944 The election was held November 7, and Bell got 19,096 votes while Bunker received 36,648.Nevada State Journal, November 18, 1944 Bell was the leader of the Nevada Republican Party and in 1948 was an alternate to the Republican National Convention.

MacDonald's 1960 novel The Only Girl in the Game). He died in office of a heart attack in 1962. ==Other activities== ===Television=== Bell was host of the program Cowboys and Injuns in 1950.
