Ch\u014dtetsu then extended the line in several stages, first reaching Yecheon on 1 November 1928,\u671d\u9bae\u7e3d\u7763\u5e9c\u5b98\u5831 \u79c1\u8a2d\u9244\u9053\u904b\u8f38\u55b6\u696d\u958b\u59cb (Bulletin of the Public Journal of the Governor-General of Korea: Private railway transportation enterprise started), 13 November 1928 then reaching Gyeongbuk Andong on 16 October 1931;\u671d\u9bae\u7e3d\u7763\u5e9c\u5b98\u5831 \u79c1\u8a2d\u9244\u9053\u904b\u8f38\u55b6\u696d\u958b\u59cb (Bulletin of the Public Journal of the Governor-General of Korea: Private railway transportation enterprise started), 21 October 1931 however, the Jeomchon\u2013Andong section was dismantled in 1944 to use the material elsewhere as Japan's military faced material shortages during the Pacific War.\u671d\u9bae\u7e3d\u7763\u5e9c\u5b98\u5831 (Bulletin of the Public Journal of the Governor-General of Korea), Sh\u014dwa No. 1130, 15 September 1944 After the Liberation of Korea, Ch\u014dtetsu was nationalised along with all other railways in the country. The Gyeonbuk Line was subsequently operated by the Korean National Railroad, retaining the name Gyeongbuk Line but extending it to Yeongju instead of rebuilding it to Andong. ==Services== In the November 1942 timetable, the last issued prior to the start of the Pacific War, Ch\u014dtetsu operated the following schedule of third- class-only local passenger services:T\u014da Travel Co.
