    "text": "The 1914 College Football All-Southern Team consists of American football players selected to the College Football All-Southern Teams selected by various organizations for the 1914 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association football season. Tennessee and Auburn both had claims to the SIAA championship. It was Tennessee's first championship of any kind. Washington and Lee and Virginia both had claims to the SAIAA championship. Ted Shultz of Washington & Lee was selected an All-American by the Philadelphia Public Ledger. ==Composite eleven== The composite All-SIAA eleven compiled from a total of seven sports writers, coaches, and others by Z. G. Clevenger, University of Tennessee athletic director: Farmer Kelly of Tennessee. *Goat Carroll, end for Tennessee. Carroll scored all the points in the 16 to 14 victory over Vanderbilt, the school's first over its rival. An account of the first touchdown reads \"Four minutes of play had barely drifted by when Tennessee's weird, mystic, elusive forward pass, May to Carroll, deadly in accuracy, went sailing home for the first touchdown of the game. The chesty Tennessee quarterback sent the oval whizzing for a distance of thirty-five yards and Carroll gathered in the ball near his goal line, when he hurried beneath the posts with all the speed at his command.\" *Rabbit Curry, quarterback for Vanderbilt, included on Outing magazine's \"FOOTBALL ROLL OF HONOR: The Men Whom the Best Coaches of the Country Have Named as the Stars of the Gridiron in 1914.\". During the First World War, he was killed in aerial combat over France. He was a beloved player of Coach Dan McGugin, described by one writer as \"the player who has most appealed to the imagination, admiration, and affection of the entire university community through the years.\" *Bull Kearley, end for Auburn, last year moved to this position from halfback. Donahue's 7-Box or 7-2-2 defensive scheme required fast ends which could disrupt a play from the start. This was role was filled by Kearley. He recovered three fumbles in the game with Georgia Tech in 1914, a 14 to 0 victory. \"Bull Kearley was the star on both sides and gave an exhibition of football the like of which has never been seen on a southern gridiron before. He covered every punt and nearly every time nailed the man in his tracks, once coming down the field so hard that the man, receiving the punt, fumbled it to get out of the way.\" *Mush Kerr, guard for Tennessee. One account of the Sewanee game reads \"Mush Kerr played a wonderful game in the line as did Capt. Kelly. The work of the Tennessee line was easily the feature of the contest, and Sewanee early discovered that it was practically useless to rely on line plunges to gain ground.\" *Farmer Kelly, tackle and captain for Tennessee, included on Outing magazine's \"FOOTBALL ROLL OF HONOR.\" *Hunter Kimball, halfback for Mississippi A&M.; In 1932, he was appointed the first Executive Director of the Mississippi Game and Fish Commission. *Rus Lindsay, fullback for Tennessee. In the Sewanee game: \"Lindsay, as usual, ploughed through the opposing line for consistent gains, and when it was absolutely necessary that Tennessee gain a certain number of yards 'Russ' was sure to be called upon.\" *David Paddock, quarterback for Georgia, the school's second All-American. He was named such by Parke H. Davis. Paddock is the only player in school history to have a petition circulated by the student body requesting that he play for the Bulldogs. Included on Outing magazine's \"FOOTBALL ROLL OF HONOR.\" *Boozer Pitts, center for Auburn, the lone unanimous selection. One writer claims \"Auburn had a lot of great football teams, but there may not have been one greater than the 1913-1914 team.\" Included on Outing magazine's \"FOOTBALL ROLL OF HONOR.\" Pitts later coached and was once professor of mathematics at Auburn. *Big Thigpen, guard for Auburn. The Atlanta Constitution praised his \"smashing brilliant game in the line.\" *Bully Van de Graaff, tackle for Alabama. He was selected for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869-1919 era. The brother of the inventor of the Van de Graaff generator which produces high voltages. ==Composite overview== The composite All-SIAA overview.
