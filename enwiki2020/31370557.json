His nickname was The Game. ==Career== Douglas won the 1995 WDF Europe Youth Cup, and made his BDO World Darts Championship debut in 2000. He defeated Gary Spedding in the first round before losing to eventual champion Ted Hankey in the second round. Douglas returned to the BDO World Championship stage in 2011, losing 0-3 in the first round to Gary Robson. He has also appeared in the Last 16 of the World Masters in 2009 and again in 2011. Douglas qualified for the World Championship again in 2012, and again was drawn against Robson in the first round. On this occasion, Douglas defeated Robson 3-0. He was defeated in the second round by Paul Jennings. He was the main administrator of the BDO's Players Forum, along with John Leatherbarrow and Lucy Evenden.Profile for Steve Douglas Douglas entered PDC Q School in January 2014, but only entered three of the four days and failed to win enough games to acquire a tour card. However, by participating he gained PDPA membership which gave him entry into certain events. In May, he beat two-time world champion Adrian Lewis on his way to the last 16 of a PDC event for the first time at the 10th Players Championship of the year, where he lost 6\u20131 to Tony Newell. He was defeated in two Challenge Tour finals during the year to Mark Frost 5\u20131 and Matt Clark 5\u20134 (after having been 4\u20132 ahead). This helped Douglas to finish eighth on the Challenge Tour Order of Merit. In 2015 he participated in the Qualifying School to renew his tour card due to him being ranked outside the top 64. Douglas earned a two- year tour card on day three of four with a 5\u20134 victory over Jermaine Wattimena. At the UK Open he enjoyed wins over Mark Robinson, John Bowles and Andy Boulton to reach the third round where John Henderson ended his run with a 9\u20137 victory. A sole last 32 exit was his best result during the rest of the year. ==World Championship Performances== ===BDO=== * 2000: 2nd Round (lost to Ted Hankey 0\u20133) * 2011: 1st Round (lost to Gary Robson 0\u20133) * 2012: 2nd Round (lost to Paul Jennings 2\u20134) * 2013: 2nd Round (lost to Tony O'Shea 1\u20134) ==Personal life== Douglas suffered a heart attack on 13 December 2012 and required a stent to be fitted after a blood clot was found in his coronary artery.
