He links these fields of research to make clear policy recommendations, including his recommendation of significantly reducing hospital locations and the number of hospital beds in Germany, while still retaining the clinical staffing levels, which would significantly improve quality of care. Busse's primary research areas are: health systems, health services, health economics, and health technology assessment (HTA). Health systems: Busse's work has had a particular emphasis on reforms in Germany, the systematic and comparative description and evaluation (performance assessment) of other countries health systems, including those in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as research about the design of social insurance systems, benefit baskets and the tension between market and regulation in the international and national contexts. He also researches the role of the EU in the health care sector. Beyond thematic areas, Busse's research has also focused on the methods of comparative health systems analysis. In this regard, his work has helped advance international health system research. The Coverage Cube, designed by Busse, is used worldwide to describe Universal Health Coverage (see Goal 3 of Sustainable Development Goals). Health services: Busse focuses on the design and effect of payment mechanisms, in particular Diagnosis-related groups (DRG-systems), quality of care, models of integrated care and the role of nursing staff, among other things on its impact on patient outcomes, a line of study he has developed since the 1990s. Health economics: Busse's health economics research centers on the assessment of health systems, in general, and of health technologies such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, in particular. HTA: Busse's work on developing methods to appropriately and effectively assess health technologies has been instrumental in this area of activity. For example, the methodology used across Europe today was informed by Busse's publication from 2002, entitled BEST PRACTICE IN UNDERTAKING AND REPORTING HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENTS: Working Group 4 Report). == Excerpt of other activities and memberships == * 2003: Elected to the Fellowship of the Faculty for Public Health of the Royal College of Physicians of the United Kingdom * 2006-2009: Dean of the Faculty VII Economics and Management, Technical University of Berlin * 2007-2008: Member of the Ministry of Health-appointed Scientific Advisory Board on the further development of the risk structure compensation (until the collective resignation of the Advisory Board in 2008) * 2009-2011: Principal investigator (coordinator) of the EU-funded project \"EuroDRG: Diagnosis-Related Groups in Europe: towards Efficiency and Quality\" * Since 2011: Editor-in-Chief of the international peer review journal Health Policy * Since 2012: Head of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research-funded Berlin Centre of Health Economics Research (BerlinHECOR) * 2016-2017: Chairman of the German Association for Health Economics In addition, from 2015-2018, Busse acted as Speaker of the Board of Directors of the then newly-established inter-university Berlin School of Public Health (BSPH), involving Alice Salomon University of Applied Sciences Berlin, Charit\u00e9, and Technical University of Berlin, and aimed at training a new generation of public health professionals in Germany and the world.
