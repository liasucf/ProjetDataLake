The Finnish Railway Museum () is located in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4, Finland. It was founded in 1898 and located in Helsinki. The museum was moved to Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 in 1974. The museum is on the original station and yard site of the Hanko\u2013Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 railway. In addition to the station building, there is a roundhouse and several other preserved buildings, mainly from the 1870s. Unique objects are on display, including the only surviving imperial train of the Russian Emperor. The locomotives include the British Neilson and Company locomotive (0-6-0 No 1427) dating 1869, a British Beyer Peacock locomotive dating from 1868, and a 2-10-0 steam locomotive Tr2 1319 ALCO No 75214 built 1947, which is one of 20 Russian \"Decapod\" locomotives sold to Finland. The museum also has a live steam backyard railroad track, where train rides are offered to the public during special run days in the summer months. == Museum locomotives == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Image !!
