    "text": "10 Minute School (, abbreviated as 10MS) is an online educational platform in Bangladesh created in 2015 by internet entrepreneur Ayman Sadiq. The platform covers academic classes from classes 1 to 12 covering the entire academic syllabus of the Bangladesh schooling system, university admission subjects covering different branches of study, and skills training. == History == Ayman Sadiq founded 10 Minute School in mid 2014 as a YouTube Channel. Largely self- sponsored in the beginning, 10 Minute School did not initially have a website and solely reached students through educational info graphics. It started creating video tutorials for Mathematics and English and eventually started taking live classes on Facebook. 10 Minute School went on to cover the entire academic syllabus from Class 1 through Class12, university admission subjects covering topics from public and private university examinations and extensive software and skills training. While one of the major challenges for the organization back then was to find a suitable sponsor to fund its operational activities, it later came to be supported by telecom operator Robi Axiata Ltd and the Ministry of Bangladesh. == Content == As of September 2020, the website has produced 19440+ video lessons, 1114+ SmartBooks, 49530+ quizzes and 1300+ blogs.Nisikto10 Minute School == References == Category:Education in Bangladesh ",
