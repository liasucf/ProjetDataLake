It was established around 1155 and was abolished when the country became Protestant in 1550. The monastery is best known about its early Abbot N\u00edkul\u00e1s Bergsson and his famous publication Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan, which was basically a guidebook for pilgrims about the routes from Northern Europe to Rome and Jerusalem. The monastery once was the home of such heroes of saga literature as Einar \u00dever\u00e6ingur, V\u00edga- Gl\u00fams and Bergur Sokkason. It is believed to be the burial place of Sighvatur Sturluson and his sons who died in the Battle of \u00d6rlygssta\u00f0ir. The current church in Munka\u00fever\u00e1 was built in 1844. In front of the church, there is a memorial dedicated to J\u00f3n Arason, who attended the monastery and did his studies there. ==External links== * * Munka\u00fever\u00e1 church Category:Benedictine monasteries in Iceland Category:Christian monasteries established in the 12th century Category:1155 establishments in Europe Category:1550 disestablishments in Europe Category:Churches completed in 1844 Category:12th-century establishments in Iceland Category:Monasteries dissolved under the Icelandic Reformation ",
