    "text": "Panther Stadium at Blackshear Field is a stadium on the campus of Prairie View A&M; University in Prairie View, Texas. The venue is a multi-sport field used primarily for American football and is the home field of Prairie View A&M; Panthers football. Initial capacity is 15,000 with future phases calling for expansion up to 30,000 being possible. The 15,000-seat stadium holds 10 skyboxes/suites and 500 premium seats, a field house featuring a large weight room, a dining area, academic support space, locker rooms and training rooms, and other amenities. The stadium's inaugural game was held on September 4, 2016 between Prairie View A&M; and Texas Southern. ==History== Interior of Panther Stadium at Blackshear Field The new stadium was announced in 2014. It would cost an estimated $60 million to build and would be built on the old Edward L. Blackshear Field. Led by Roy Perry, Prairie View A&M; alums earned an estimated $30 million and started the Prairie View A&M; Foundation in 2009. Those funds would be used for campus enhancements with $10 million being set aside for football stadium renovations. The Texas A&M; board of regents approved the project in early 2015, and the old stadium was demolished that fall, forcing Prairie View A&M; football to find a local high school to host their 2015 home games. Prairie View A&M; hopes the new stadium will increase enrollment in the school. Overall students raised nearly 2/3 of the funds to build the new stadium. Additional construction at and around the stadium includes a new U.S. Olympic track and a new soccer stadium. ==See also== * Prairie View A&M; Panthers football * List of NCAA Division I FCS football stadiums ==References== ==External links== *Prairie View A&M; Athletics: Panther Stadium Category:American football venues in Texas Category:College football venues Category:Prairie View A&M; Panthers football ",
