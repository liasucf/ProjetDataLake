During the storm, multiple U.S. states declared states of emergency, and icy road conditions caused traffic incidents and fatalities. An outbreak of 11 tornadoes also struck Texas, injuring two.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Texas/2017/January/table ==Meteorological history== In mid-January, an unusual surge of atmospheric moisture surged into northwestern Mexico associated with an upper-level low near California. This moisture began to move into the High Plains and Central United States by the jet stream ahead of the low late on January 13, and, with below-freezing temperatures at the surface in much of Oklahoma, northern Texas, and Kansas, freezing rain began to explode into existence. The frozen precipitation continued to blossom as the day progressed. The low began to inject the aforementioned moisture into the state of Texas and Oklahoma as it slowly moved east-northeastwards across the Baja California peninsula and across the northern Gulf of California throughout the day on January 14. Meanwhile, icy conditions continued in much of the Central United States. By late on January 14, a surface low developed east of the upper-low as it moved swiftly towards the United States\u2013Mexico border. The surface low, while intensifying, as a result of interaction with the incoming moisture, developed a squall line of thunderstorms along its cold front, as it and the upper-low emerged into the Southwestern United States. The entire storm system continued to push northeastwards through the state of Texas on January 15. In advance of the squall line that was moving rapidly to the east, scattered supercell thunderstorms popped up, and at one point during the nighttime hours, a tornado warning had to be issued for the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, a rare occurrence. ==Preparations and impact== ===West=== ====Oregon==== Snow covered car in Portland, Oregon The storm impacted Portland, Oregon on January 10, 2017.

Residents in these areas were urged stay indoors during the storm and to prepare by buying food, water, and fuel. Icy conditions contributed to a fiery crash between two semitrailer trucks on Interstate 80 near Kearney, Nebraska on January 15, and no injuries were reported. The University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln canceled classes on January 17 due to the road conditions. Since 2016 was an abnormally dry year for Nebraska, some local farmers appreciated the moisture from the storm. On January 15, the storm left of ice on some parts of Iowa, and hundreds of crews were sent to clear the roads. ===Great Plains=== ====Oklahoma==== On January 12, 2017, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency.

Road conditions stranded several vehicles in Oologah, Oklahoma, and Interstate 40 was closed due to multiple accidents. ====Texas==== On January 15\u201316, the ice storm impacted Texas, creating severe storms and tornadoes in South Clifton and in the counties Bosque and Hill.
