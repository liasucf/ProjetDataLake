    "text": "Thomas Robert Mann (born 1947) is an American jewelry artist known primarily for his metalsmithing and assemblage techniques. Combining industrial-style metals with found trinkets and baubles, Mann has dubbed his style \"Techno- Romantic\" and runs Studio I/O in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he now lives and works. == Early life and education == Mann was born in Northampton, Pennsylvania and raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania. His father was a machinist for Bethlehem Steel, an influence to which Mann credits his \"fondness for machinery.\" While in high school, Mann experimented with jewelry-making and worked at a silversmith shop in Allentown. The jewelry he sold during his teen years helped fund his education at East Stroudsburg University, where he earned a degree in performing arts in 1970. In 1977, Mann began exhibiting at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and later established his home and studio in New Orleans in 1982. == Selected collections == *Museum of Fine Arts, HoustonThomas Mann, \"Big Link\" Necklace, 1989, mixed media, Gift of Don and Rita Newman, MFAH 2014.275. https://www.mfah.org/art/detail/122043 *Museum of Fine Arts, BostonThomas Mann, \"Space Frame Neck Piece (Do you Believe in Luck?),1992, mixed media, The Daphne Farago Collection, MFAB 2006.345. https://collections.mfa.org/objects/458919/space-frame-neck-piece-do-you- believe-in-luck;jsessionid=A8C0B1B63F4EF2D7DC45F27F4E723692?ctx=ef8e18aa- cd33-4c08-bfea-8a80df18bdbb&idx;=3Thomas Mann, \"Memory Map\" Collage Box with Brooch, 1992, mixed media, The Daphne Farago Collection, MFAB 2013.1712. https://collections.mfa.org/objects/475232/memory-map-collage-box-with- brooch;jsessionid=A8C0B1B63F4EF2D7DC45F27F4E723692?ctx=ef8e18aa- cd33-4c08-bfea-8a80df18bdbb&idx;=4 *Smithsonian American Art MuseumThomas Mann, 6 brooches, 1993, mixed media, Gifts of E.
