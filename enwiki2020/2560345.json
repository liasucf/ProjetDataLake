    "text": "The Al-Fatiha Foundation was an organization which advanced the cause of LGBTQ Muslims. It was founded in 1997 by Faisal Alam, a Pakistani American, and was registered as a nonprofit organization in the United States until 2011. ==History== Members of Al Fatiha at the LGBT Pride parade in San Francisco 2008. Alam founded Al-Fatiha in November of 1997. The organization grew out of an internet listserve for questioning Muslims from 25 countries, and by October 1998 had developed numerous in-person chapters. At its height, Al- Fatiha had 14 chapters in the United States, as well as offices in England, Canada, Spain, Turkey, and South Africa and was the largest gay rights organization in the world. The name \"Al-Fatiha\" means \"the Opening.\" It is also the name of the first chapter of the Qur'an. In the beginning of that chapter ('surah'), God is described as compassionate and merciful; the organization's founders believe that these attributes characterize Islam, rather than hatred and homophobia. Each year, Al-Fatiha hosted an international membership retreat and conference. Early conferences took place in Boston, New York, and London in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and focused on issues such as the reconciliation of religion and sexual orientation. The last Al-Fatiha conference was held in 2005 in Atlanta, Georgia. ===Fatwa=== In 2001, Al-Muhajiroun, an international organization seeking the establishment of a global Islamic caliphate, issued a fatwa declaring that all members of Al-Fatiha were murtadd, or apostates, and condemning them to death. Because of the threat and coming from conservative societies, many members of the foundation's site still prefer to be anonymous so as to protect their identity while continuing a tradition of secrecy.Tim Herbert, \"Queer chronicles\", Weekend Australian, October 7, 2006, Qld Review Edition. ===Challenges=== While Al-Fatiha worked to combat homophobia within Muslim communities, it also felt it faced the challenge of seeking to avoid provoking an Islamophobic reaction among non-Muslims. After the organization's founder, Faisal Alam, stepped down, subsequent leaders failed to sustain the organization. It began a process of legal dissolution in 2011. One of the challenges that Al-Fahita faced is that the basic and common value regarding genders of Islam religion. The value of fundamental Islamist toward genders is relatively, in fact, very strict compare to other religions. For example, the extreme Muslim group \"Taliban\" actively harass women and LGBT people inside Afghanistan Taliban controlled territories. They kill women for going to school and kill LGBTs for being sexual minorities. Sometimes, Muslim communities not only discriminating, but also violent. ==See also== * Liberal movements in Islam * Lut, source of Qur'anic injunctions against homosexuality * Homosexuality and Islam * Board member Daayiee Abdullah ==References== ==External links== * Al- Fatiha homepage (website discontinued since 2009) * Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (Founded 2013, USA) * Imaan, UK Muslim LGBT support organisation Category:LGBT Muslim organizations Category:International LGBT political advocacy groups Category:LGBT political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Islamic charities based in the United States Category:Liberal and progressive movements within Islam Category:1997 establishments in the United States Category:2011 disestablishments in the United States Category:Islamic organizations established in 1997 Category:Organizations disestablished in 2011 Category:1997 in LGBT history Category:2000s in LGBT history Category:1990s in Islam Category:LGBT religious organizations in the United States ",
