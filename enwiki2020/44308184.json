    "text": "Tricholoma sejunctum (colloquially yellow blusher in the eastern regions of North America) is a mushroom that appears across much of the Northern Hemisphere and is associated with pine forests. ==Edibility== There is some dispute as to its edibility, though it does seem to have been traditionally consumed in much of world without noted ill effects. More recently, in Europe it has been identified as responsible for poisonings. However, it also shows promise as an anti-viral or anti-cancer mushroom. ==Flavour== The mushroom is described both in North America and in China as having a 'mealy' flavour, indeed in China's Yunnan province where it is most frequently consumed it is generally known as \u835e\u9762\u83cc (Pinyin: qiao mian jun; lit. 'Buckwheat Noodle Mushroom') on account of this property, despite the fact that its proper name is \u9ec4\u7eff\u53e3\u8611 (lit. 'Yellow Green Mouth Mushroom'). ==See also== *List of North American Tricholoma *List of Tricholoma species ==References== ==External links== * sejunctum Category:Fungi described in 1799 Category:Fungi of Asia Category:Fungi of Europe ",
