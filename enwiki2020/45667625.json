Namibia won the tournament (its first) on net run rate from Kenya, with both teams progressing to the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland and Scotland. Two other African sides, South Africa and Zimbabwe, are ICC full members, and thus qualify directly for the World Twenty20. Namibian Gerrie Snyman and Kenyan James Ngoche led the tournament in runs and wickets, respectively, and Ngoche was Player of the Tournament. The 2015 event was the third edition of the ICC Africa Twenty20 Championship's Division One, instituted prior to the 2012 World Twenty20 Qualifier. It was held in South Africa for the first time, with the two previous editions held in Uganda. Six teams participated, each playing each other once in a round- robin. Five of the teams were associate members of the ICC, with Ghana the only affiliate member at the tournament. == Points table == Source: CricHQ {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !width=200 |Team !width=30 | !width=30 | !width=30 | !width=30 | !width=30 abbr=\"No result\" |NR !width=30 abbr=\"Points\" |Points !width=60 abbr=\"Net run rate\" |NRR |- | align=\"left\" | || 5 || 4 || 1 || 0 || 0|| 8 || +2.182 |- |align=\"left\" | || 5 || 4 || 1 || 0|| 0|| 8 || +1.663 |- |align=\"left\" | || 5 || 3 || 2 || 0 || 0|| 6 || +0.612 |- | align=\"left\" | || 5 || 3 || 2 || 0 ||0 || 6 || \u20131.450 |- |align=\"left\" | || 5 || 1 || 4 || 0 || 0|| 2|| \u20131.259 |- | align=\"left\" | || 5 || 0 || 5 || 0|| 0|| 0|| \u20131.774 |} :Won \u2013 2 points :Lost \u2013 0 points :Tie or No Result \u2013 1 point ==Fixtures== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Statistics== ===Most runs=== The top five runscorers are included in this table, ranked by runs scored and then by batting average. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
