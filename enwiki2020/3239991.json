It is the first school in South Carolina to be home to an International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Southside is also the defending state AAA Boys' Basketball champions for the second year in a row. Currently it is 226th in the nation for its forensics team. Its Academic team was ranked number 2 in the nation as of last year. Also the school is host to a very successful AFJROTC drill team. == SAT Performance and Graduation Rate == According to a report by the Greenville County School District , Southside students scored 1023 on average on the SATs in 2003. This is 12 points higher than the Greenville County School Average (1011) and 7 points higher than the national public school SAT average (1016). This average may not clearly represent the distinction between the two distinct academic groups present at the school, the local zoned enrollment and the magnet enrollment due to the school's Advanced Placement and IB Diploma Programs. == Advanced Placement and IB Diploma Programs == Southside is the first high school in South Carolina to offer an International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Southside couples the IB Diploma Program with the opportunity for students to take Advanced Placement Program exams. Many courses taught at the school incorporate expected materials from both programs. In addition, the IB Middle Years Program was implemented during the Fall of 2006; the current Program Coordinator at Southside High School is Dr. Lavetta Collins. Southside offers IB courses in Higher Level (HL) English, Standard Level (SL) and HL Chemistry, SL Biology, SL and HL Physics, AB Initio (introductory), SL, and HL Spanish, AB Initio, SL, and HL French, HL History of the Americas, SL and HL Psychology, SL Studies and HL Mathematics, and Theory of knowledge (IB course). In 2002, 103 students from Southside took 383 AP exams. 45 percent of those exams were scored at 3 or higher (generally considered a passing score). In the same year, 63 students took 230 IB Diploma exams with 63% of these exams scored at 4 or higher. .
