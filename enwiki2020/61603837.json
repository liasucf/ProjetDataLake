It is one of the largest growth areas in Klaukkala. Haikala and Ripatti, the other residential areas of Klaukkala, are located around M\u00e4ntysalo. The most important road connection to the center of Klaukkala is Kirkkotie, which divides the areas of Haikala and M\u00e4ntysalo. The future Klaukkala bypass, which is under construction, will pass north of M\u00e4ntysalo.Ohikulkutien rakennusty\u00f6t alkavat pian M\u00e4ntysalossa \u2013 asukkailla nyt mahdollisuus vaikuttaa meluun (in Finnish)Ohikulkutien rakennusty\u00f6t pian k\u00e4yntiin M\u00e4ntysalossa \u2013 ty\u00f6skentelyajat asukkaiden huolena (in Finnish) == History == Henrik Viktor Engvist (1912-1987), the son of a merchant from Jakobstad, was responsible for the birth of the M\u00e4ntysalo area. Engvist and his family moved from Helsinki to the northern part of Klaukkala, known as the then small village, and in 1960 purchased the Karppo estate, where they built a modest, 18-square-meter log cabin. In order to secure his livelihood, Engvist came up with the idea of sketching out other potentials for residents in the area. He went to offer a draft plan for the municipal administration, but because the answer was negative, relentless Engvist went on to present a draft to the Uusimaa Provincial Government. The province architect was fascinated by the draft and, while hoping that Engvist would refine the draft a little, he also asked him to develop names for the area and the streets to come. The place was named M\u00e4ntysalo, despite the fact that the forest consisted of spruce trees () rather than pine trees, but Engvist's wife Lempi considered the name \"Kuusisalo\" less beautiful. == Society and services == Established in 1996, M\u00e4ntysalo has an elementary school with grades 4-9 (formerly grades 3-9).M\u00e4ntysalon koulu (in Finnish) There are two kindergartens/preschools, M\u00e4ntysalon p\u00e4iv\u00e4koti and Havum\u00e4en p\u00e4iv\u00e4koti.
