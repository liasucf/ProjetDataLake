    "text": "The 2007 Miami Hurricanes football team, representing the University of Miami was Randy Shannon's first as head coach of his alma mater. It was also the last in which Miami played its home games in the Miami Orange Bowl. Miami was 5\u20137 for the season their first losing season since going 5\u20136 in 1997. ==Changes== Miami finished the 2006 season with a 7\u20136 record, their worst since 1997's 5\u20136 campaign. Former head coach Larry Coker was fired, after continuous regression following a national championship his first season in 2001. Following a brief coaching search, Randy Shannon, previously the team's defensive coordinator, was hired by the University of Miami. Since his hiring, Shannon has made several reforms. He has banned firearms, declaring any player carrying one will be dismissed from the team and the school. He also banned the use of cell phones during class, confiscating them from anyone caught with them for two weeks. He requires players maintain a 2.5 grade point average in order to live off campus, and any player who skips class faces extra conditioning as well as demotion on the depth chart. On July 24, Shannon announced to the press that the Hurricanes were stripping the names on the back of their jerseys for the 2007 season, which is highly unusual in Division I football. The Miami Herald then labeled Miami a \"no name offense and defense\". Shannon has also hired with six new coaching assistants, headlined by offensive coordinator Patrick Nix, who held the same position in 2006 with Georgia Tech. During meetings with the ACC media, Shannon stated he believes the team can rebound and win the ACC, saying \"I don't expect anything less.\" ==Recruiting class of 2007== {| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"80%\" !bgcolor=\"#006600\"| Player !bgcolor=\"#006600\"| Position !bgcolor=\"#006600\"| Height !bgcolor=\"#006600\"| Weight !bgcolor=\"#006600\"| 40-time !bgcolor=\"#006600\"| Hometown |- align=\"center\" | Daniel Adderley || WR || 6'6\" || 215 || 4.59 || Simpsonville, SC |- align=\"center\" | Allen Bailey || DE || 6'3\" || 265 || 4.8 || Darien, GA |- align=\"center\" | Damien Berry || DB || 5'11\" || 197 || 4.46 || Belle Glade, FL |- align=\"center\" | Jared Campbell || DB || 6'0\" || 195 || 4.5 || Aurora, CO |- align=\"center\" | Lee Chambers || RB || 5'10.5\" || 189 || 4.56 || Coffeeville, MS |- align=\"center\" | Graig Cooper || RB || 5'11\" || 185 || 4.65 || Memphis, TN |- align=\"center\" | Kayne Farquharson || WR || 6'2\" || 185 || 4.4 || Homestead, FL |- align=\"center\" | Orlando Franklin || OL || 6'6\" || 300 || 5.47 || Delray Beach, FL |- align=\"center\" | Harland Gunn || OL || 6'2\" || 300 || 5.2 || Omaha, NE |- align=\"center\" | Leonard Hankerson || WR || 6'2\" || 185 || 4.4 || Fort Lauderdale, FL |- align=\"center\" | Tyler Horn || OL || 6'5\" || 290 || 5.3 || Memphis, TN |- align=\"center\" | Robert Marve || QB || 6'1\" || 189 || 4.65 || Tampa, FL |- align=\"center\" | Jermaine McKenzie || WR || 6'1\" || 164 || 4.41 || Bradenton, FL |- align=\"center\" | Shawnbrey McNeal || RB || 5'9\" || 181 || 4.45 || Dallas, TX |- align=\"center\" | Joseph Nicolas || S || 6'2\" || 195 || 4.5 || Homestead, FL |- align=\"center\" | Adewale Ojomo || DE || 6'3\" || 217 || 4.6 || Hialeah, FL |- align=\"center\" | Andres Arroyo || DT || 6'7\" || 350 || 5.50 || Miami, FL |- align=\"center\" | DeMarcus Van Dyke || DB || 6'1.5\" || 157 || 4.35 || Miami, FL |- align=\"center\" | Doug Wiggins || DB || 5'11\" || 180 || 4.5 || Miami, FL |-align=\"center\" | colspan=3 | Total commitments | colspan=3 | 19 |} In the pre-season, ESPN listed incoming running back Graig Cooper as one of the top-10 impact freshman for 2007.Mark Schlabach, Illinois' Benn, ND's Clausen impact newcomers for 2007, ESPN.com, June 22, 2007. ==Personnel== {| class=\"wikitable\" !

After this season, the Hurricanes moved their home games from Orange Bowl Stadium to nearby Miami Gardens and Dolphin Stadium. They had been at the Orange Bowl for seventy years. ==Game summaries== ===Marshall (1\u20130)=== Pregame line: Miami -18.5 The Hurricanes defeated Marshall in Randy Shannon's debut game, which was also the first between of the two teams. The running backs provided the majority of the Hurricanes' offense, as sophomore Javarris James and true freshman Graig Cooper combined for 215 yards on the ground with James scoring two touchdowns. Starting quarterback Kirby Freeman completed only 9 of 21 passes for 86 yards, but was praised by Shannon for \"controlling the game.\" Wide receiver Sam Shields sat out of the game for violating team rules. Defensively, the Hurricanes made four interceptions, six sacks, and held Marshall to 51 rushing yards. Following the game, James said, \"We started off this year with a bang and hopefully we can continue.\"James scores twice as Miami dominates Marshall in Shannon's debut ===#6 Oklahoma (1\u20131)=== Pregame line: Miami +11.5 The last time the Sooners and the Hurricanes had competed was in the 1988 Orange Bowl. Miami won 20\u201314 and earned its second national championship. The Sooners are 27\u20135 against current ACC members with three of those losses to the Hurricanes. The Sooners entered the game favored by between 10 and 11 points. The Hurricanes were within one score halfway into the third quarter, before the game, nationally televised on ABC, became a washout for the Sooners. The Oklahoma defense was able to limit James and Cooper to a combined 54 yards. Freeman went 3 of 9 for only 17 yards before being benched in favor of former starter Kyle Wright, who led the Hurricanes on their only touchdown drive and completed 7 of 14 for 65 yards. The Hurricanes' defense was able to contain the Sooners, going into halftime with a 21\u201310 deficit, and scoring a field goal early in the third quarter to pull as close as 21\u201313, but Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford launched an aerial attack, going 19 of 25 for 205 yards and 5 touchdowns. The loss was the Hurricanes' biggest since 1998, when they were defeated by Syracuse 66\u201313. ===Florida International (2\u20131)=== Pregame line: Miami -31.5 Last season was the first football game between the two cross-town schools. The Hurricanes won 35\u20130, but the game was most notable for its on-field brawl. Both teams hired new head coaches in the off-season; FIU was led by Mario Cristobal, who was previously the Hurricanes' offensive line coach. The Hurricanes made changes following the Oklahoma defeat for the FIU game, the most noticeable of which was Shannon's decision to rename Kyle Wright, who was the starter last season before falling to injury, the starting quarterback. Wright went 10 of 19 for 224 yards, while Javarris James went for 92 yards as the Hurricanes won 23\u20139, extending FIU's losing streak to 15. ===#16 Texas A&M; (3\u20131)=== Pregame line: Miami -3 This was the second match between the Aggies and the Hurricanes, with the Aggies having won the 1944 game. The game was the final nonconference game of the season for both teams. Despite being unranked, the Hurricanes entered the game three-point favorites over the undefeated 16th-ranked Aggies. Played before a near-capacity crowd in the Orange Bowl and a national television audience on ESPN, the Hurricanes dominated the Aggies for much of the game, with a successful offense. By the time Aggies kicker Matt Szymanski put the first Texas A&M; points on the board by way of a field goal in the fourth quarter, Miami had already scored 31. Kyle Wright led an effective passing attack, finishing 21\u201326 for 275 yards, and showing an ability to lead the Hurricane offense, which achieved 402 yards to A&M;'s 240. Defensively, the Hurricanes limited the Aggie's leading rushers Stephen McGee, Mike Goodson, and Jorvorskie Lane to 38 combined rushing yards in the first half and 98 yards overall \u2013 significantly less than their previous combined game average of 235 yards. Miami DE Calais Campbell, whose fumble recovery in the second quarter lead to a field goal that put the Hurricanes up 24\u20130 going into halftime, said of the statement victory: \"Knowing this is the last year in the Orange Bowl, we want to make history here.\" ===Duke (4\u20131)=== Pregame line: Miami -24 Duke entered the game with the 47th ranked pass offense in the nation,Blue Devils Preview: Miami Hurricanes led by former Miami-area quarterback Thaddeus Lewis. Lewis threw for 241 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions against the Hurricanes, getting within a field goal in the fourth quarter. However, the Hurricanes' defense sacked Lewis nine times, helping the Hurricanes win the game 24\u201314.ESPN: Miami 24, Duke 14 Calais Campbell was named ACC Defensive Lineman of the Week as he totaled 16 tackles, including 2.5 sacks, 3.5 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles against Duke. He now places seventh in the conference in sacks, fourth in tackles for loss, and is tied for third in fumbles forced. Graig Cooper ran for 101 yards and a touchdown in only twelve carries. He also caught a pass for 25 yards, and was given ACC Rookie of the Week honors for this.Calais Campbell, Graig Cooper Named ACC Players of the Week Miami leads the overall series 4 to 1. ===North Carolina (4\u20132)=== Pregame line: Miami -7 This was the first match between North Carolina, led by head coach Butch Davis, against his former team. For the Hurricanes, the first half included two Kyle Wright interceptions, six plays allowed for 18 yards or more, and a short missed field goal attempt. The Tar Heels' first half domination included a blocked punt that eventually led to a touchdown, and added to the 27\u20130 score at halftime. The second half was mostly controlled by Miami, who scored 27 points of their own \u2013 including a 97-yard touchdown catch by senior Darnell Jenkins. However, two North Carolina field goals in the fourth quarter and an errant Wright pass intercepted at the North Carolina 3-yard line (his fourth interception of the game) led to the Hurricanes losing.Davis' North Carolina holds off former team Miami ===Georgia Tech (4\u20133)=== Pregame line: Miami -2.5 The Hurricanes struck first with a 39-yard run by freshman Shawnbrey McNeal and took a 7\u20130 lead into halftime. The second half, however, was mostly controlled by the Yellow Jackets, who outgained the Hurricanes 244\u201379 in the half. Georgia Tech was led by running back Tashard Choice, who ran for a career-high 204 yards on 37 carries. A fourth-quarter touchdown pass from Kyle Wright to Sam Shields tied the game, but it was Travis Bell's 39-yard field goal with 7 minutes 34 seconds left that gave Georgia Tech the win. Georgia Tech became the third team in the last 25 years to beat the Hurricanes in three consecutive seasons, joining Virginia Tech and Florida State (both of whom accumulated the wins during the Hurricanes' probation years).Georgia Tech 17, Miami 14 All three Georgia Tech wins came by a touchdown or less. ===Florida State (5\u20133)=== Pregame line: Miami +4.5 Florida State and the Hurricanes both entered this game unranked for the first time since 1977. The teams exchanged turnovers (nine total, five by FSU) and scores, staying close for most of the game. With 5 minutes 29 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Hurricanes, losing 29\u201324, appeared to have lost their best chance to win when Kirby Freeman was stopped for no gain on a fourth- and-1 at the Florida State 1. But Freeman, who replaced injured Kyle Wright in the first half, drove Miami 83 yards in under two minutes to take the lead 30\u201329 on a 13-yard pass to Dedrick Epps with 1:15 left. FSU quarterback Xavier Lee, who was intercepted twice, then fumbled after being hit by Miami's Teraz McCray, and Colin McCarthy ran it in. This was the first game since 2001 that was decided by more than a touchdown. Miami now leads the all-time series of the rivalry, 30\u201322. ===NC State (5\u20134)=== Pregame line: Miami -11 With Virginia and Virginia Tech both losing the week before, the Hurricanes has the potential to advance to the ACC Championship games, needing only to win out.

The Hurricanes then took a 10\u20130 lead when quarterback Kirby Freeman completed his only pass of the game, an 84-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Darnell Jenkins. NC State then became the first visiting team this season to score in the first half against the Hurricanes when with 2 minutes 4 seconds left until halftime, running back Daniel Evans took the ball in from one yard out to make the score 10\u20137 at the half. There was just one score in the 3rd quarter which was a 33-yard field goal by the Hurricanes. The score was then 13\u20137 going into the fourth quarter.

The Hurricanes were then forced to kick a 27-yard field goal to send it into overtime. The Hurricanes got the ball first in overtime and chose 6 run plays to open. They then attempted another 27-yard field goal which sailed wide left. NC State then got the ball and kicker Steven Hauschka kicked a 42-yard field goal to win the game.
