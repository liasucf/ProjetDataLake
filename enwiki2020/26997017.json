Record World Vol 36 #1671 (28 July 1979) \"Black Music Report\" by Ken Smikle p.45 The album peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard R&B; albums chart. ==Overview== After working for several years with her then-husband Brian Russell as session musicians and by themselves as the duo Brian & Brenda in the mid-1970s, the couple divorced and Brenda Russell embarked on a solo career by signing with A&M; Records. The album was written almost entirely by Russell and produced by Andre Fischer. The single, \"So Good So Right\", reached Nos. 8, 15 and 30 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary, Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts, respectively. The track, \"\"Think It Over\", written by Russell with her then-husband Brian, was previously recorded by Charlie's Angels star Cheryl Ladd. ==Sampling== In 1998, American rapper Big Pun sampled \"A Little Bit of Love\" on his hit single \"Still Not a Player\". In 2003, Mexican singer Thal\u00eda sampled the song in \"I Want You\", and in 2013 Ariana Grande and Mac Miller sampled the same song for their Top 10 hit single, \"The Way\". In 2001, singer Mary J. Blige sampled \"God Bless You\" in her song \"Flying Away\". In 2006, singer Janet Jackson sampled \"If Only For One Night\" in her song \"Do It 2 Me\" off the album 20 Y.O.. In 2000, the album was re-released on CD with new cover artwork and included Russell's most well known hit \"Piano in the Dark\" from 1988 as a bonus track. ==Track listing== # \"So Good, So Right\" - 3:20 # \"In the Thick of It\" - 3:56 # \"If Only for One Night\" - 4:13 # \"Way Back When\" - 4:23 # \"A Little Bit of Love\" - 4:41 # \"You're Free\" \u2013 3:30 # \"Think It Over\" - 5:17 # \"God Bless You\" - 4:48 All tracks composed by Brenda Russell, except: \"You're Free\" (lyrics: Brenda Russell, music: Andre Fischer, Brenda Russell) \"Think It Over\" (lyrics: Brenda Russell, music: Brian Russell, Brenda Russell) ==Personnel== * Brenda Russell \u2013 lead vocals, backing vocals (1-7), acoustic piano (1, 2, 3, 5), Wurlitzer electric piano (4, 7), Fender Rhodes (5), horn arrangement (5), rhythm arrangements, vocal arrangements * Ron Stockert \u2013 Fender Rhodes (1, 3, 4, 7, 8), acoustic piano (4, 8), clavinet (5) * Ian Underwood \u2013 synthesizers (2, 4) * Clare Fischer \u2013 string arrangements (3, 8), organ (4, 7), concertmaster (6), electric guitar (7) * David Wolfert \u2013 electric guitar (1, 7), horn arrangements (1), string arrangements (1, 7) * Fred Tackett \u2013 electric guitar (1, 6), acoustic guitar (2) * George Sopuch \u2013 electric guitar (1, 2, 6), guitar solo (6) * Ed Brown \u2013 bass * Andre Fischer \u2013 drums, rhythm arrangements * Victor Feldman \u2013 percussion (2, 4), vibraphone (5) * Henry Gibson \u2013 percussion (2) * Hector Andrade \u2013 timbales (5) * Tom Saviano \u2013 soprano saxophone (1) * Doug Richardson \u2013 tenor saxophone (2, 8) * Larry Williams \u2013 baritone saxophone (5), alto flute (5, 6) * Bill Reichenbach Jr. - baritone (5), bass trombone (5), horn arrangements (5) * Judd Miller \u2013 trumpet (1) * Steve Madaio \u2013 trumpet (1), flugelhorn (1) * Chuck Findley \u2013 flugelhorn (5, 6), piccolo trumpet (5) * Jerry Hey \u2013 trumpet (5) * Gary Herbig \u2013 English horn (6) * David McKelvy \u2013 harmonica (7) * Jerry Peters \u2013 string arrangements (4, 6), horn arrangements (6) * Harry Bluestone \u2013 concertmaster (1, 7) * Gerald Vinci \u2013 concertmaster (3, 8) * Assa Drori \u2013 concertmaster (4) * Doublerock Baptist Junior Choir \u2013 backing vocals (5) * Michele Aller \u2013 backing vocals (5, 7, 8) * Susaye Greene \u2013 backing vocals (5, 7, 8) * Elaine Hill \u2013 backing vocals (5, 7, 8) * Joe Esposito \u2013 backing vocals (7) * Eddie Hokenson \u2013 backing vocals (7) * Arnold McCuller \u2013 backing vocals (7) * Petsye Powell \u2013 backing vocals (7) * Bruce Sudano \u2013 backing vocals (7) * Kathy Collier \u2013 backing vocals (8) * Venette Gloud \u2013 backing vocals (8) * Carmen Twillie \u2013 backing vocals (8) ==Production== * Producer \u2013 Andre Fischer * Associate Producer \u2013 Brenda Dash * Recorded by John Rhys * Mixed by Al Schmitt * Mix Assistants \u2013 Don Henderson, Murray McFadden, Phil Moores and Terry More. * Mastered by Mike Reese at The Mastering Lab (Los Angeles, CA). * Art Direction \u2013 Roland Young * Design \u2013 Amy Nagasawa * Photography \u2013 Claude Mougin ==Charts== Album {| class=\"wikitable\" !
