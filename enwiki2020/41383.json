    "text": "A multicast address is a logical identifier for a group of hosts in a computer network that are available to process datagrams or frames intended to be multicast for a designated network service. Multicast addressing can be used in the link layer (layer 2 in the OSI model), such as Ethernet multicast, and at the internet layer (layer 3 for OSI) for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) or Version 6 (IPv6) multicast. ==IPv4== IPv4 multicast addresses are defined by the most-significant bit pattern of 1110. This originates from the classful network design of the early Internet when this group of addresses was designated as Class D. The CIDR notation for this group is . The group includes the addresses from to . Address assignments from within this range are specified in RFC 5771, an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Best Current Practice document (BCP 51). The address range is divided into blocks each assigned a specific purpose or behavior. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !IP multicast address range !Description !Routable |- |224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 |Local subnetwork | |- |224.0.1.0 to 224.0.1.255 |Internetwork control | |- |224.0.2.0 to 224.0.255.255 |AD-HOC block 1AD-HOC Block 1 | |- |224.3.0.0 to 224.4.255.255 |AD-HOC block 2AD-HOC Block 2 | |- |232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255 |Source-specific multicast | |- |233.0.0.0 to 233.251.255.255 |GLOP addressing | |- |233.252.0.0 to 233.255.255.255 |AD-HOC block 3AD-HOC Block 3 | |- |234.0.0.0 to 234.255.255.255 |Unicast-prefix-based | |- |239.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 |Administratively scoped | |} ;Local subnetwork :Addresses in the range of to are individually assigned by IANA and designated for multicasting on the local subnetwork only. For example, the Routing Information Protocol (RIPv2) uses , Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) uses and , and Multicast DNS uses . Routers must not forward these messages outside the subnet from which they originate. ;Internetwork control block :Addresses in the range to are individually assigned by IANA and designated as the internetwork control block. This block of addresses is used for traffic that must be routed through the public Internet, such as for applications of the Network Time Protocol using . ;AD-HOC block :Addresses in three separate blocks are not individually assigned by IANA. These addresses are globally routed and are used for applications that don't fit either of the previously described purposes.RFC 5771 Section 6. ;Source-specific multicast :The (IPv4) and (IPv6) blocks are reserved for use by source-specific multicast. ;GLOP :The range was originally assigned by as an experimental, public statically- assigned multicast address space for publishers and Internet service providers that wished to source content on the Internet. The allocation method is termed GLOP addressing and provides implementers a block of 255 addresses that is determined by their 16-bit autonomous system number (ASN) allocation. In a nutshell, the middle two octets of this block are formed from assigned ASNs, giving any operator assigned an ASN 256 globally unique multicast group addresses. The method is not applicable to the newer 32-bit ASNs. , superseding , envisioned the use of the range for many-to-many multicast applications. Unfortunately, with only 256 multicast addresses available to each autonomous system, GLOP is not adequate for large-scale broadcasters. ;Unicast-prefix-based :The range is assigned by as a range of global IPv4 multicast address space provided to each organization that has or larger globally routed unicast address space allocated; one multicast address is reserved per of unicast space. A resulting advantage over GLOP is that the unicast-prefix mechanism resembles the unicast-prefix capabilities of IPv6 as defined in . ;Administratively scoped :The range is assigned by RFC 2365 for private use within an organization. Per the RFC, packets destined to administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses do not cross administratively defined organizational boundaries, and administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses are locally assigned and do not have to be globally unique. The RFC also discusses structuring the range to be loosely similar to the scoped IPv6 multicast address range described in . ===Notable IPv4 multicast addresses=== The following table is a list of notable well-known IPv4 addresses that are reserved for IP multicasting and that are registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !IP multicast address !Description !Routable |- |224.0.0.0 |Base address (reserved) | |- |224.0.0.1 |The All Hosts multicast group addresses all hosts on the same network segment. | |- |224.0.0.2 |The All Routers multicast group addresses all routers on the same network segment. | |- |224.0.0.4 |This address is used in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) to address multicast routers. | |- |224.0.0.5 |The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) All OSPF Routers address is used to send Hello packets to all OSPF routers on a network segment. | |- |224.0.0.6 |The OSPF All Designated Routers \"\"(DR)\"\" address is used to send OSPF routing information to designated routers on a network segment. | |- |224.0.0.9 |The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) version 2 group address is used to send routing information to all RIP2-aware routers on a network segment. | |- |224.0.0.10 |The Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) group address is used to send routing information to all EIGRP routers on a network segment. | |- |224.0.0.13 |Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Version 2 | |- |224.0.0.18 |Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) | |- |224.0.0.19\u201321 |IS-IS over IP | |- |224.0.0.22 |Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) version 3RFC 3376 Section 4.2.14 | |- |224.0.0.102 |Hot Standby Router Protocol version 2 (HSRPv2) / Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) | |- |224.0.0.107 | Precision Time Protocol (PTP) version 2 peer delay measurement messaging | |- |224.0.0.251 |Multicast DNS (mDNS) address | |- |224.0.0.252 |Link-local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) address | |- |224.0.0.253 |Teredo tunneling client discovery addressRFC 4380 item 2.17 | |- |224.0.1.1 |Network Time Protocol clients listen on this address for protocol messages when operating in multicast mode. | |- |224.0.1.22 |Service Location Protocol version 1 general | |- |224.0.1.35 |Service Location Protocol version 1 directory agent | |- |224.0.1.39 |The Cisco multicast router AUTO-RP-ANNOUNCE address is used by RP mapping agents to listen for candidate announcements. | |- |224.0.1.40 |The Cisco multicast router AUTO-RP-DISCOVERY address is the destination address for messages from the RP mapping agent to discover candidates. | |- |224.0.1.41 |H.323 Gatekeeper discovery address | |- |224.0.1.129\u2013132 |Precision Time Protocol (PTP) version 1 messages (Sync, Announce, etc.) except peer delay measurement | |- |224.0.1.129 |Precision Time Protocol (PTP) version 2 messages (Sync, Announce, etc.) except peer delay measurement | |- |239.255.255.250 |Simple Service Discovery Protocol address | |- |239.255.255.253 |Service Location Protocol version 2 address | |} ==IPv6== Multicast addresses in IPv6 use the prefix .

A multicast is indicated by the first transmitted bit of the destination address being 1. of the destination MAC address are treated as multicast frames and are flooded to all points on the network. While frames with ones in all bits of the destination address () are sometimes referred to as broadcasts, Ethernet generally does not distinguish between multicast and broadcast frames. Modern Ethernet controllers filter received packets to reduce CPU load, by looking up the hash of a multicast destination address in a table, initialized by software, which controls whether a multicast packet is dropped or fully received. The IEEE has allocated the address block to for group addresses for use by standard protocols. Of these, the MAC group addresses in the range of to are not forwarded by 802.1D-conformant MAC bridges. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Some well known Ethernet multicast addresses !Ethernet multicast address !Ethertype !Usage |- | | |Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), Unidirectional_Link_Detection (UDLD) |- | | |Cisco Shared Spanning Tree Protocol Address |- | | |Spanning Tree Protocol (for bridges) IEEE 802.1D |- |, or |0x88CC |Link Layer Discovery Protocol |- | |0x0802 |Spanning Tree Protocol (for provider bridges) IEEE 802.1ad |- | |0x8808 |Ethernet flow control (pause frame) IEEE 802.3x |- | |0x8809 |\"Slow protocols\" including Ethernet OAM Protocol (IEEE 802.3ah) and Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) |- | |0x88f5 |GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (also known as IEEE 802.1q GVRP) |- | through |0x8902 |Ethernet CFM Protocol IEEE 802.1ag |- | through |0x0800 |IPv4 Multicast (RFC 1112), insert the low 23 bits of the multicast IPv4 address into the Ethernet addressRFC 7042 2.1.1. |- | through |0x86DD |IPv6 Multicast (RFC 2464), insert the low 32 Bits of the multicast IPv6 Address into the Ethernet Address RFC 7042 2.3.1. |- | through |0x88B8 |IEC 61850-8-1 GOOSE Type 1/1A |- | through |0x88B9 |GSSE (IEC 61850 8-1) |- | through |0x88BA |Multicast sampled values (IEC 61850 8-1) |- | or |0x88F7 |Precision Time Protocol (PTP) version 2 over Ethernet (native layer-2) |} ==802.11== 802.11 wireless networks use the same MAC addresses for multicast as Ethernet. ==See also== *Broadcast address *Reserved IP addresses ==Notes== ==References== Category:Network addressing ",
