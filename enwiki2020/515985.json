Leaving Newfoundland in 1935, he was appointed as Governor of New South Wales but served only briefly due to his ill health. He died while in office aged 62. ==Early life and career== Anderson was born on 11 April 1874, the second son of General David Anderson, Colonel of the Cheshire Regiment, and his wife Charlotte Christina, n\u00e9e Anderson in Newton-by-Chester in Cheshire, England. His elder brother was Lieutenant General Sir Warren Hastings Anderson. In 1887, as a 13-year-old, he became a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.

Anderson saw further action against West-African rebels and in the Ashanti Campaign. In May 1902, he was posted as First and gunnery lieutenant to the cruiser on the Channel Squadron. In 1905 he was promoted to commander and was posted to the Royal Yacht HMY Victoria and Albert in 1908. That year, he married a New Zealander, Edith Teschemaker. On 29 July 1910 Anderson was appointed a Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order. On 11 August 1911, he was promoted to captain and posted as Flag Captain on from 1913 to 1917. When the First World War broke out he took part in the operations that resulted in the destruction of the in German East Africa, and was Mentioned in Despatches in 1915. For his actions leading to the capture of Dar es Salaam he was appointed a Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1918.

Anderson was then appointed on 20 October 1932 as the Governor of Newfoundland. He became His Majesty's Representative at a time of great instability in the Dominion of Newfoundland. Newfoundland had been hit badly by the Great Depression, leaving most of the banks on the verge of insolvency, saved only by emergency loans from Britain, the state Treasury was empty and the political process was discredited by corruption and incompetence.Noel, SJR, Politics in Newfoundland, University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1971, p220 The Government, led by Prime Minister Frederick C. Alderdice, called upon the British government to take direct control until Newfoundland could become self-sustaining. The United Kingdom, concerned over Newfoundland's likelihood of defaulting on its loans, asked the government to establish the Newfoundland Royal Commission, headed by a Scottish peer, Lord Amulree. Its report, released in 1933, assessed Newfoundland's political system as institutionally corrupt and its economic future as bleak, recommending the abolition of responsible government, and its replacement by a Commission of the British Government. Acting on the report's recommendations, Alderdice's government voted itself out of existence in December 1933. Appointed as Chair of the Commission of Government in 1934, Anderson found his role as Governor with significantly expanded powers and proved himself up to the job, constantly sending reports back to the Dominions Office and giving advice to the Dominions Secretary on how to deal with the Commission members. Despite his new-found powers, Anderson took the position as the neutral mediator, intervening only when there was a dispute in the Commission.Noel, pg 227 He was nevertheless involved with restructuring the administration of the state, including government departments, social services, the health system and the postal system. His approach proved to be not enough to bring the Commission out of petty arguments and disputes and in October 1935 it was announced that he would be replaced by another Naval Officer, Sir Humphrey Walwyn. Anderson and his wife departed from Newfoundland the following January. ==Governor of New South Wales== entering Sydney Harbour on 6 August 1936 carrying Sir Murray and Lady Anderson In November 1935 it was announced that he was to become the Governor of New South Wales, a relatively quieter post. He was invested by King Edward VIII as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 5 May 1936, and as a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem on 23 June 1936. En route to Australia he was taken ill, and had to spend six weeks in hospital in Perth, Western Australia. He was sworn in at Sydney on 6 August 1936. Because of his recurring illness, Lady Anderson undertook many official duties on his behalf, while the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Street, carried out his legislative and ceremonial duties. On 29 October he collapsed and died of a cerebral haemorrhage early in the morning the next day at Government House. His body was laid in state in St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney and was shipped back to England for burial. Lady Edith Muriel Anderson was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) on 11 May 1937 for public service in New South Wales.Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, DBE, 11 May 1937, itsanhonour.gov.au, Citation: Public service in New South Wales. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |rowspan=2|80px || Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) || 1930 |- | Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) || 1923 |- |rowspan=2|80px || Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) || 1936 |- | Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) || 1918 |- |80px || Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) || 1910 |- |80px || Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem (KStJ) || 1936 |- |80px|| Africa General Service Medal || |- |80px || 1914\u201315 Star || |- |80px || British War Medal || |- |80px || Victory Medal with MID Palm || |- |80px || King Edward VII Coronation Medal || 1902 |- |80px || King George V Coronation Medal || 1911 |- |80px || King George V Silver Jubilee Medal || 1935 |- |80px || The Order of St. Anna (Russia) || |- |80px || The Order of the Redeemer (Greece) || |- |80px || Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark) || |- |80px || Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar, Second Class (Zanzibar)|| |- |80px || Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd Class, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon (Japan) || |- |} ==References== ==Further reading== * |- |- Category:1874 births Category:1936 deaths Category:People from Malpas, Cheshire Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Members of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Recipients of the Order of the Rising Sun Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Anna Category:Governors of the Dominion of Newfoundland Category:Governors of New South Wales Category:Ambassadors and High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to South Africa Category:Knights of the Order of the Dannebrog Category:Members of the Newfoundland Commission of Government ",
