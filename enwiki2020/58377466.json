    "text": "\"i sing of Olaf\" (sometimes referred to as \"i sing of Olaf glad and big\") is a poem by E.E. Cummings. It first appeared in Cummings' 1931 collection ViVa. It depicts the life of Olaf, a conscientious objector and pacifist during the First World War who is tortured by the United States Army but nonetheless \"will not kiss your fucking flag\", and subsequently dies in prison. ==History== The poem is based on the true story of a \"big blond conscientious objector who was reading Sir Thomas Browne\",\"E. E. Cummings, A Life\", by Susan Cheever; page 64; published 2014 by Pantheon Books whom Cummings briefly encountered while stationed at Camp Devens in 1918;Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century, page 164-165, by Catherine Tramonta, edited by Eric L. Haralson; published 2014 by Routledge Susan Cheever noted that Cummings never learned the man's name, and only \"vividly imagined his fate\". ==Analysis== Critics have noted the similarity of the opening stanza to that of Virgil's Aeneid, underlining the contrast between Olaf (whose heroic values are based in peace) and Achilles (whose heroic values were based in war).\"So Many Selves\" (chapter 3) (p 38-41), I Am: A Study of E.

Cummings\", edited by Harold Bloom, published 2009 by Infobase Publishing Gary Lane has observed that the poem's \"laconic conclusion\" prefigures W. H. Auden's \"The Unknown Citizen\". ==Censorship== Although the poem's original publication contained the word \"fucking\", anthologies typically bowdlerized this to \"f.ing\";A Frieze for a Temple of Love, by Edward Field, published 1998 by David R.
