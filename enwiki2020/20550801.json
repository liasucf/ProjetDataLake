Allmusic Review accessed September 17, 2011 ==Track listing== :All music by Keith Jarrett except as indicated. # \"La Scala, Part 1\" - 44:54 # \"La Scala, Part 2\" - 27:42 # \"Over the Rainbow\" (Harold Arlen, E.Y. \"Yip\" Harburg) - 6:01 Total effective playing time: 1:16:34 (the album contains 2:04 applause approximately) ==Personnel== *Keith Jarrett \u2013 piano == Technical Personnel == * Jan Erik Kongshaug - Remixing Engineer * Judith Joy Ross - Liner Photo * Mayo Bucher - Cover Graphic * Michael Hofstetter - Cover Design * Manfred Eicher - Remixing Engineer and Executive Producer ==Musicological notes== Probably not without a sense of irony to the setting of this recording, Part 1 climaxes into a sheer citation of the famous aria Nessun Dorma from the opera Turandot by Italian composer Giacomo Puccini. == References == Category:Keith Jarrett live albums Category:1997 live albums Category:ECM Records live albums Category:Albums produced by Manfred Eicher Category:Instrumental albums Category:Solo piano jazz albums ",
