It is the most common style in modern writings and third most common in publications (after the Ming and gothic styles, which are used exclusively in print). ==History== left|200px|thumb|Sheng Jiao Xu by Chu Suiliang: calligraphy of the Kaishu style. \u5176\u6578\u7136\u800c\u5929\u5730\u82de/\u4e4e\u9670\u967d\u800c\u6613\u8b58\u8005/\u4ee5\u5176\u6709\u8c61\u4e5f\u9670\u967d/\u8655\u4e4e\u5929\u5730\u800c\u96e3\u7aae Regular script came into being between the Eastern H\u00e0n and C\u00e1o W\u00e8i dynasties,Qi\u00fa 2000 p. 143 and its first known master was Zh\u014dng Y\u00e1o (sometimes also read Zh\u014dng Y\u00f3u; \u937e\u7e47),Qi\u00fa 2000 p. 142 who lived in the E. H\u00e0n to C\u00e1o W\u00e8i period, c. 151\u2013230 CE. He is known as the \"father of regular script\", and his famous works include the Xu\u0101nsh\u00ec Bi\u01ceo (\u5ba3\u793a\u8868), Ji\u00e0nj\u00eczh\u00ed Bi\u01ceo (\u85a6\u5b63\u76f4\u8868), and L\u00ecm\u00ecng Bi\u01ceo (\u529b\u547d\u8868). Qiu Xigui describes the script in Zhong\u2019s Xu\u0101nsh\u00ec Bi\u01ceo as: However, other than a few literati, very few wrote in this script at the time; most continued writing in neo-clerical script, or a hybrid form of semi- cursive and neo-clerical. Regular script did not become dominant until the early Southern and Northern Dynasties, in the 5th century; there was a variety of regular script which emerged from neo-clerical as well as from Zhong Yao's regular script,Qi\u00fa 2000 p. 146 known as \"Wei regular\" (\u9b4f\u6977 Weikai) or \"Wei stele\" (\u9b4f\u7891 Weibei). Thus, regular script has parentage in early semi-cursive as well as neo-clerical scripts. The script is considered to have matured stylistically during the Tang Dynasty, with the most famous and oft-imitated regular script calligraphers of that period being: * Four great calligraphers of the early Tang (\u521d\u5510\u56db\u5927\u5bb6): ** Ouyang Xun (\u6b50\u967d\u8a62) ** Yu Shinan (\u865e\u4e16\u5357) ** Chu Suiliang (\u891a\u9042\u826f) ** Xue Ji (\u859b\u7a37) * \"Yan-Liu\" (\"\u984f\u67f3\") ** Yan Zhenqing (\u984f\u771f\u537f) ** Liu Gongquan (\u67f3\u516c\u6b0a) ==Name== In addition to its many names in Chinese, regular script is also sometimes called \"block script\"Gao, James Z. (2009), Historical Dictionary of Modern China (1800-1949), Scarecrow Press, p.41. or \"standard script\"http://www.columbia.edu/~xc2282/calligraphy/calligraphy.html (alternate translation of \u6977) in English. ==Characteristics== Regular script characters with width (or length) larger than 5 cm (2 in) is usually considered larger regular script, or dakai (\u5927\u6977), and those smaller than 2 cm (0.8 in) usually small regular script, or xiaokai (\u5c0f\u6977). Those in between are usually called medium regular script, or zhongkai (\u4e2d\u6977). What these are relative to other characters. The Eight Principles of Yong are said to contain a variety of most of the strokes found in regular script. Notable writings in regular script include: * The Records of Yao Boduo Sculpturing (\u59da\u4f2f\u591a\u9020\u50cf\u8a18) during the Southern and Northern Dynasties * The Tablet of Guangwu General (\u5ee3\u6b66\u5c07\u8ecd\u7891) during the Southern and Northern Dynasties * The Tablet of Longzang Temple (\u9f8d\u85cf\u5bfa\u7891) of the Sui Dynasty * Tombstone-Record of Sui Xiaoci (\u8607\u5b5d\u6148\u5893\u8a8c) of the Sui Dynasty * Tombstone-Record of Beauty Tong (\u8463\u7f8e\u4eba\u5893\u8a8c) of the Sui Dynasty * Sweet Spring at Jiucheng Palace (\u4e5d\u6210\u5bae\u91b4\u6cc9\u9298) of the Tang Dynasty ===Derivatives=== *Imitation Song typefaces () are typefaces based on a printed style which developed in the Song dynasty, from which Ming typefaces developed. *The most common printed typeface styles Ming and sans-serif are based on the structure of regular script. *The Japanese textbook typefaces (; Hepburn: ky\u014dkashotai) are based on regular script, but modified so that they appear to be written with a pencil or pen. They also follow the standardized character forms prescribed in the J\u014dy\u014d kanji. *Zhuyin Fuhao characters, although not true Chinese characters, are virtually always written with regular script strokes. ==In computing== ==References== *Qiu Xigui (2000).
