    "text": "The gens Laecania or Lecania was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens first appear in history during the reign of Tiberius. The first to attain the consulship was Gaius Laecanius Bassus in AD 40.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 727 (\"Lecanius\"). ==Origin== The nomen Laecanius seems to belong to a class of gentilicia formed using the sufix -anius, typically derived from cognomina ending in -anus, or derived from other \"a-stem\" words.Chase, p. 118. The name might be derived from the surname Laeca, which was used by a family of the Porcia gens, or from the same root.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 498 (\"Porcia Gens\"). ==Branches and cognomina== The only important family of the Laecanii bore the cognomen Bassus, originally indicating someone stout.Chase, p. 110. ==Members== ===Laecanii Bassi=== * Gaius Laecanius Bassus, praetor urbanus in AD 32, and consul in 40..PIR, vol.
