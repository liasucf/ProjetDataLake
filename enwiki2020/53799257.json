    "text": "Pavel Illyich Bulgakov (3 August 1856 \u2013 1940) was an Imperial Russian division and corps commander. He fought in the war against the Ottoman Empire. He took part in the Russian invasion of East Prussia, a part of the German Empire. On 18 February 1915, his forces were surrounded the German Tenth Army in the Augustow Forest. On 21 February 1915 he and surviving men surrendered. This provided time for the rest of the Russian Tenth Army to form a new defensive position. Bulgakov was taken prisoner by the Germans and remained in captivity until after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. On 3 August 1918 he was released. He traveled by train to Mtsensk in Oryol Oblast, where he was hospitalized after arriving on 8 August 1918. On 6 September 1918 he went to B\u0103l\u021bi, Bessarabia (now in Moldova, then controlled by Romania). He remained there for the duration of the Russian Civil War and after the Bolshevik victory. He died shortly after Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union. ==Awards== *Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov), 3rd class, 1879 *Order of Saint Vladimir, 3rd class, 1898 *Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov), 1st class, 1905 *Order of Saint Anna, 1st class, 1910 *Order of Saint George, 4th degree (13 January 1915) *Order of the White Eagle (Russian Empire) (26 February 1915) ==Sources== * \u0417\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a. \u0410. \u041a\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0435. \u041c., 2003. * \u0413\u0443\u0449\u0438\u043d \u0424. \u0410., \u0416\u0435\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0421. \u0421. \u041f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438 1914\u20141917. \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u044c. 2010. * \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0421. \u0412. \u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0438. \u041c. 2002 * Category:1856 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Russian military personnel of the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878) Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus (Russian), 3rd class Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Vladimir, 3rd class Category:Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus (Russian), 1st class Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Anna, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Russian) ",
