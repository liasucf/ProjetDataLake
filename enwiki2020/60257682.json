He rose to prominence for interacting with a small herd of deer that visited his backyard, whom he later named and referred to collectively as the Deer Squad. As of October 2020 he currently has 2.2 million Twitter followers. Pe\u00f1a is also the founder of the nonprofit organization Everybody Eats Foundation. ==Early life and education== Pe\u00f1a was born in New York to a Dominican father and a Puerto Rican mother. He moved to Puerto Rico with his mother as an infant and lived there until he was 8, after which he moved to Killeen, Texas. He spent summers in Washington Heights, Manhattan with his father. He was on the swim team at Shoemaker High School, where he graduated from in 2016 with a 3.80 GPA and ranked 16th in his class. He is the brother of New York-based rapper, Slayter. ==Career== Pe\u00f1a first received media attention for a viral Twitter video in August 2016 when he was 17, in which he was interacting with and speaking to a wild deer in his backyard in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. He named this deer Money. He released several more videos that showed him feeding several more deer, playing basketball around them, and naming them. He used the catchphrase \"everybody eats\" in the videos. He later named the family of deer in his yard \"the Deer Squad\" and called them Canela, Bambi, and Lola. Pe\u00f1a regularly posts videos of himself traveling internationally and interacting with animals such as chimpanzees, penguins, and goats. Super Deluxe licensed a short documentary called Deer Squad, which profiled Pe\u00f1a and the family of deer he had befriended. The film premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in the Shorts Programming category. Director Scott J. Ross stated that he and his collaborators had contacted Pe\u00f1a the day after Pe\u00f1a's first viral video to shoot the documentary. ===Everybody Eats Foundation=== Pe\u00f1a created the nonprofit organization Everybody Eats Foundation in late 2016 to, \"help single-parent families during the holidays and after-school kids year-round.\" That Thanksgiving, the organization delivered 150 turkeys to churches and families in need. After Hurricane Maria, Pe\u00f1a used Everybody Eats to raise money and supplies for the victims. He raised over $3,000 in donations from his Twitter followers. ===Controversial Tweets=== In October 2018, several Tweets surfaced in which Pe\u00f1a used antiblack and anti-Semitic language. According to the date of the Tweets, Pe\u00f1a was 12 years old at the time they were published. He posted a note on Twitter apologizing for his language. In the note, he stated \"I apologize for 12-year-old Kelvin and take total responsibility for my words. Everyone changes, everyone learns, everyone makes mistakes.\" ===December 2019 altercation=== In December 2019, Pe\u00f1a visited Miami, Florida for a beach clean up event. On the night of the 6th, videos surfaced on Twitter depicting him being violently hit and kicked in a sandwich shop as bystanders looked on. Twitter user @phatdabb_gmn, who had been pictured in a club with Pe\u00f1a a day earlier, tweeted \u201cI just beat the dog shit outta brother nature in la Sandwicherie,\u201d though the tweet has been deleted. ==References== ==External links== * Official Twitter * Deer Squad documentary on YouTube Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:American Internet celebrities Category:Nonprofit businesspeople Category:People from Killeen, Texas Category:American people of Dominican Republic descent Category:American people of Puerto Rican descent ",
