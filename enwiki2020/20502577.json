It was their final album in the UK. == Background == By late 1981, the group had released two consecutive flop singles, \"In a Riddle\" from the previous album and \"Taken at the Flood\", a stand-alone single, which wasn't considered good enough for inclusion on this album. The group spent the year recording this album with new producer, former pop singer Barry Blue. In September, the lead single \"And I Wish\" was released. An upbeat pop song, it became their first chart entry for a year, but only managed to reach No.52.Official Charts Company - \"And I Wish\" chart details The album was released soon after.
