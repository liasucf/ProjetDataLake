    "text": "The Pr\u00e9vost reaction is chemical reaction in which an alkene is converted by iodine and the silver salt of benzoic acid to a vicinal diol with anti stereochemistry.Charles Pr\u00e9vost; C.A. 27, 3195 (1933) The reaction was discovered by the French chemist Charles Pr\u00e9vost (1899\u20131983). The Pr\u00e9vost reaction == Reaction mechanism == The reaction between silver benzoate (1) and iodine is very fast and produces a very reactive iodinium benzoate intermediate (2). The reaction of the iodinium salt (2) with an alkene gives another short-lived iodinium salt (3). Nucleophilic substitution (SN2) by the benzoate salt gives the ester (4). Another silver ion causes the neighboring group substitution of the benzoate ester to give the oxonium salt (5). A second SN2 substitution by the benzoate anion gives the desired diester (6). The mechanism of the Pr\u00e9vost reaction In the final step hydrolysis of the ester groups gives the anti-diol. This outcome is the opposite of that of the related Woodward cis-hydroxylation which gives syn addition. == References == == See also == * Woodward cis-hydroxylation Category:Organic redox reactions Category:Substitution reactions Category:Name reactions ",
