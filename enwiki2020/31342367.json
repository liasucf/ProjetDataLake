    "text": "This list of rail trails in Massachusetts details former railroad right-of- ways in Massachusetts that have been converted to trails for public use and proposed rail trails where trails exist but have not been fully established. Massachusetts has at least \"69 rail-trails, covering 347 miles. A massive new project proposed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, called the Landline, seeks to connect these trails, creating a 1,400-mile network of greenways and foot trails within the Boston region. When finished (currently 45 percent of the greenway network and 60 percent of the foot trail network is complete), the network would bring trail access within a half mile of three- quarters of the region\u2019s residents, and 92 percent of residents would be within one mile of the nearest trail or path.\"\"How to make the most of New England\u2019s rail-trail system\" https://www.boston.com/travel/travel/2018/08/15/how-to-make-the-most-of-new- englands-rail-trail-system == Established rail trails == * Alewife Linear Park (Cambridge) * Amesbury Riverwalk Trail * Ashburnham Rail Trail * Ashuwillticook Rail Trail (12 miles in North Berkshires) * Assabet River Rail Trail southwest end (5.8 miles, Hudson to Marlboro) completed, & northeast end 3.4 miles (from South Acton station (MBTA) through Maynard to Stow) * Bedford Narrow Gauge Trail (Bedford) a.k.a.
