She also discovered two asteroids, 1718 Namibia and 2437 Amnestia, at the Turku Observatory in 1942. ==Background== Marja V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 was the daughter of astronomer Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4, a renowned discoverer of minor planets. After she graduated from the university, she was going to start working as his father's assistant. However, she had heard from one of the student friends, Lahja V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen, of missionary work in Ovamboland. V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen's parents, missionaries Nestor W\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen and Martta W\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen, had worked as in Ovamboland, Nestor during 1907\u20131918 and 1921\u20131928 and Martta during 1909\u20131918 and 1921\u20131928, and Lahja herself was born in Ongandjera, Ovamboland, in 1915, so she was personally familiar with the missionary work in Ovamboland. Later she also worked in South West Africa herself, in Kavango during 1947\u20131953.Peltola 1958, p. 263, 270. ==Work in Swakopmund== ===Preparing for her work=== V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 arrived in Africa in 1949. She spent her first year there in South Africa, studying the most important languages in Southern Africa, English and Afrikaans, and the local culture. South West Africa was for all practical purposes the fifth province of South Africa at the time. ===The location of the school=== Before V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 arrived in South West Africa, the Finnish missionaries there had heard of a \u201cmaster of sciences in astronomy\u201d, and they were afraid that such a highly learned person might not be suitable for teaching small children. However, V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 turned out to be excellent both in pedagogics and organization. At the time, the Finnish missionaries were debating where the future Finnish school should be founded. Some of the missionaries favoured Ovamboland, and it is clear that they were thinking that some of the children would be able to live at home when attending the school. However, the children whose homes were in Kavango would not have had the same benefits, as their journeys home during vacations would have been much longer than for the other children. V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 favoured Swakopmund for two reasons. First, the weather was better for children there than in Ovamboland, and there they would also be safe from the diseases that were encountered in Ovamboland, e.g. malaria. It would also be possible for the children to engage in sports activities, since the climate was cooler. V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 also considered the cultural atmosphere of Swakopmund to be better there than that of Ovamboland. The matter was finally resolved by the board of the Finnish Missionary Society, which, like V\u00e4is\u00e4nen, favoured Swakopmund as the location of the new school.Sepp\u00e4nen 1994, p. 29, 38\u201339. ===The school facilities=== V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 started the school in rented premises in 1950, but it soon turned out that the premises were not large enough. The owners, too, informed her that they were going to sell the premises in the near future. In 1952 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 heard that the town planned to have a new neighbourhood to the north of the town centre. On the last day of May that year, she signed a bill of purchase for two adjacent lots in the future Vineta neighbourhood. The Finns then built a house, which would function as both a school and a dormitory. A housewarming party was held in connection with the church service for the first advent in 1953. In 1858, an annex was built on the same lot, containing a garage and a room.Sepp\u00e4nen 1994, p. 41\u201350. ===The curriculum=== V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 decided to stick to the curriculum of the schools in Finland. However, the school year was that of South Africa, i.e. it was the same as a calendar year. This would have meant difficulties for those families which were returning to Finland, but many children were sent to school in Swakopmund at the age of 6, and they were ahead of children in Finland by some six months. V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 taught her students three languages, English, German and Swedish. History was taught according to Finnish textbooks, but in geography and biology she concentrated on local circumstances, plants and animals. Singing and music were taught, too, but physical education, arts and crafts and art did not receive as much attention as other subjects.Sepp\u00e4nen 1994, p. 66\u201370. ==Teaching methods== V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 used a method she had devised herself, and called it \u201cthe method of expanding circles\u201d. This method evolved out of necessity, when she had children of various grades in the same room. \"The topic of the lesson would be the same for all children, but the younger students would be taught elementary knowledge and basics, whereas with the older students she would get deeper into details,\" wrote Kalle Sepp\u00e4nen in his 1994 master's thesis in theology. Sepp\u00e4nen wrote the following concerning V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4's methods:Sepp\u00e4nen 1994, p. 72. V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 felt that the teaching of the first grade was the most difficult task, especially if the children did not know how to read when they came to school. Also, the grades from the 3rd grade up were problematic, because she was not able to devote as much time for these students as she would have wanted to. During later years she was able to get other teachers to help her with her tasks. According to Sepp\u00e4nen, V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 was ahead of her time what came to her teaching methods. Often, she would actually teach the children but help them find out about things for themselves. This was the case inside the school building and during the many excursions and tours that she organized to various places.Sepp\u00e4nen 1994, p. 72\u201374. In 1963, the head of the Finnish mission in South West Africa asked V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 if it would be possible to transfer her to the Oshigambo High School in Ovamboland, as the founder of that school, Toivo Tirronen was about to leave for Finland for a furlough. V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 wrote later that already during the preceding year she had thought that her various difficulties and the illnesses of the children were becoming too much for her, and she had pondered whether she was already too old to teach young children. Thus she decided to say yes to the head of the mission.Sepp\u00e4nen 1994, p. 74\u201375. ==Work in Ovamboland== During 1963\u20131972, V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 worked at the Oshigambo High School in Ovamboland as its teacher of mathematics and natural sciences. She described the first years of this school in her book Ambolukion lehtorina (\"teaching in the Ovambo high school\"; 1967). She returned to Finland in 1972 to take care of her elderly mother. == Discovery of asteroid == The Minor Planet Center credits V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 with the discovery of the asteroids 1718 Namibia and 2437 Amnestia, both discovered at Turku Observatory on 14 September 1942. The official for 1718 Namibia was published on 1 April 1980 (), and the was published by the Minor Planet Center on 26 May 1983 (). ==Works== * == See also == * == References == * * * == External links == * Minor Planet Discoverers (Alphabetically), Minor Planet Center * Image of asteroid 2437 Amnestia, www.taivaanvahti.fi Category:1916 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Finnish schoolteachers Category:Missionaries of the Finnish Missionary Society Category:Discoverers of minor planets Category:Finnish expatriates in Namibia ",
