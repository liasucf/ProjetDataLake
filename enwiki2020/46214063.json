    "text": "Playthings was an American trade magazine focusing on the toy and game industry. It was founded in 1902 by editor Robert McCready and publisher Henry C. Nathan, and it was published in physical form by Sandow Media on a monthly basis until Fall 2010 when it became an insert section and was merged with Gifts & Decorative Accessories magazine. Playthings was also published online and is supplemented by a weekly email newsletter, Playthings Extra. The magazine won multiple Jesse H. Neal Awards, and was generally regarded as the premier trade magazine of the American toy industry. ==Historical timeline== *1902 - Playthings is founded by editor Robert McCready and publisher Henry C.
