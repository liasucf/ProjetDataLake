The mission of the IDA is \"to preserve and protect the night time environment and our heritage of dark skies through quality outdoor lighting.\"IDA Mission & Goals Light pollution is the result of outdoor lighting that is not properly shielded, allowing light shine into the eyes and night sky. Direct light that shines into the eyes is called glare, and light directed into the night sky above the horizon causes skyglow. Lighting can also cause light trespass when it enters areas where unwanted (e.g. a neighbor's yard and windows). IDA was the first organization in the dark-sky movement, and is currently the largest. ==Principal approach== IDA's principal approach is to raise awareness about the value of dark, star-filled night skies and encourage their protection and restoration through education about the problems and solutions, including outdoor lighting practices that create less light pollution. In 2011, the organization had about 5,000 members in 70 countries. ==International Dark Sky Places== To promote awareness about the issues, the IDA has an International Dark Sky Places program that aims \"to protect locations of exceptional nighttime visages for future generations.\" 'What is an International Dark Sky Place?', IDS Places ===International Dark Sky Parks=== * Natural Bridges
