    "text": "Lost Boyz is a record label and hip hop group from South Jamaica, Queens, New York City, consisting of MC Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Kah and K Chrys. The group originally consisted of Cheeks, Freaky Tah (deceased), Spigg Nice (incarcerated), and Pretty Lou. ==History== In 1995, the group released their debut single \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Shameless\", charting on the Billboard Hot 100. The release landed them a record deal with Uptown Records. They contributed a single to the Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood soundtrack, titled \"Renee\". The song became a major hit, breaking into the Top 40 on the Hot 100 chart. The single also reached Gold status in 1996. On June 4, 1996, the group released their debut album Legal Drug Money. The work was highly acclaimed, and featured five Hot 100 hits, including their past singles \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Shameless\", \"Renee\", \"Music Makes Me High\", \"Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz & Benz\", and \"Get Up\". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1996. Their second album, Love, Peace & Nappiness, was released on June 17, 1997 through Uptown/Universal Records. It featured another Hot 100 single, \"Me & My Crazy World\". One of the most famous songs on the album was the posse cut \"Beasts from the East\", featuring A+, Redman, and Canibus. The album was not as acclaimed as their debut, but fared well commercially, reaching Gold status in late 1997. In 1996, the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD America Is Dying Slowly, alongside Wu-Tang Clan, Coolio, and Fat Joe, among others. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African-American men, was heralded as \"a masterpiece\" by The Source magazine. On the night of March 28, 1999, at a birthday party for Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah was shot in the head while exiting the Sheraton Hotel in Queens. Tah was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center where he was pronounced dead at 4:20 am, aged 27. The getaway driver, Raheem Fletcher, was sentenced to seven years in prison for manslaughter. In 2001, Kelvin Jones pleaded guilty to the murder. The three remaining group members finished their third album, LB IV Life, released in September 1999. The effort fell short critically and commercially, failing to provide any Hot 100 hits, and failing to reach Gold status. These circumstances led Mr. Cheeks to begin a solo career. He released his first solo effort John P. Kelly in 2001, which featured the hit single \"Lights, Camera, Action!\". The album also featured a tribute song to Freaky Tah titled \"Till We Meet Again\", featuring Bob Marley's son Stephen. Cheeks released another album in 2003, titled Back Again!, then followed in 2004 with Ladies & Ghettomen. On January 16, 2004, Spigg Nice was tried and convicted of multiple bank robberies in New Jersey and was sentenced to 37 years in prison.http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=2798 The group released a compilation album Lost Boyz Forever in 2005, featuring past hits and previously unreleased material. ==Members== ===Current=== * Mr. Cheeks * Freaky Kah * K Chrys ===Former=== * Freaky Tah (deceased) * Spigg Nice (incarcerated) * Pretty Lou ==Discography== *Legal Drug Money (1996) *Love, Peace & Nappiness (1997) *LB IV Life (1999) *Next Generation (2019) *LEGACY (2020) ==References== ==External links== *Official website * Category:African- American musical groups Category:Five percenters Category:Hip hop groups from New York City Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1999 Category:Musical groups from Queens, New York Category:Musical quartets ",
