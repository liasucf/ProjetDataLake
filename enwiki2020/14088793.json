    "text": "Hova () is a locality and one of the two seats of Gullsp\u00e5ng Municipality, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, Sweden, the other is Gullsp\u00e5ng. It had 1,288 inhabitants in 2010. ==Overview== The main part of the municipal administration is located in Hova, thus constituting the municipal seat. However, the municipality avoids the term seat (centralort) due to the rivalry between Hova and Gullsp\u00e5ng some 20 km north-west. Instead it is called one of the municipality's two \"main localities\". Celebrities from Hova include Stikkan Anderson and August Olsson. Each summer Hova hosts a renaissance fair whose theme is the battle of Hova in 1275. ==References== ==External links== Category:Populated places in V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County Category:Populated places in Gullsp\u00e5ng Municipality Category:Municipal seats of V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County Category:Swedish municipal seats ",
