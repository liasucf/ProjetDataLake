Lang received his Master of Science in Physics in 1979 from the University of Warsaw, and his Ph.D. in Physics in 1985 from the University of Rochester. For his M.S. thesis, he conducted studies of collisions of relativistic alpha particles (He-4) with nuclei of tantalum mounted in a liquid propane bubble chamber , Characteristics Of Pi- Production In The Collisions Of 4.2-(GeV/c)/nucleon D, Alpha And C-12 Beams With Tantalum, G.N. Agakishiev et al., Z. Phys.

After graduate he became a research assistant at the Instytut Bada\u0144 J\u0105drowych. In 1981, he was admitted to a graduate program of the University of Rochester. After initially working with Prof. Tom Ferbel he joined the group of Prof. Arie Bodek to work on the Chicago-Columbia- Fermilab-Rochester (CCFR) and Rockefeller neutrino experiment E701 at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). E701 was conceived to search for neutrino oscillations using a narrow-band beam of neutrinos and two detectors separated by a distance of 1 km (the 'near' detector was installed in Wonder Building and the 'far' detector was in Lab E) .

Lett. 52 (1984) 1384, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.52.1384 Lang's Ph.D. dissertation, defended in May 1985, was focused on \"Experimental Studies of Dimuons in High Energy Neutrino Interactions\". Results laid to rest an anomaly of \"like-sign dimuons\" - a previously hinted unexpected high-rate of same sign two-muon (dimuon) final states in neutrino interactions. The work also reported the measurement of the fraction of strange quarks in nucleons based on the analysis of opposite-sign dimuons. Neutrino Production of Dimuons, CCFR Collaboration, K. Lang et al., Z. Phys. C 33, 483 (1987), https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01548260 == Career and research == As a postdoctoral associate at the University of Rochester, Lang worked at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) on a deep inelastic electron scattering experiment (SLAC E140 Measurement of the Difference in R = \u03c3L / \u03c3T and \u03c3(A) / \u03c3(D) in Deep Inelastic e-D, e-Fe and e-Au Scattering, S. Dasu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 60 (1988) 2591, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.2591. ) measuring the spin content of the nucleon and on a search for low-mass axions (SLAC E141 A Search for Short Lived Axions in an Electron Beam Dump Experiment, E. M. Riordan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 59 (1987) 755, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.755). In 1986, he joined the group of Prof. Stanley W\u00f3jcicki at Stanford University to work on a search for rare decays of neutral kaons at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) on Long Island, NY. In 1991, Lang assumed a faculty position at the University of Texas at Austin, 160 miles south of Waxahachi, near Dallas, where an ill-fated Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), cancelled in October 1993, was being constructed. The two BNL experiments, E791 (beam exposure 1986-1988) and E871 (1993-1996) pioneered blind analysis in particle physics and reached unprecedented sensitivities for branching fractions into two leptons in the final state B(K0L \u2192 \u03bc e) < 4.7 \u00d7 10\u221212 New limit on muon and electron lepton number violation from K0L \u2192 \u03bce decay, D.

A collateral and significant success of E871 included high precision studies of the \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212 decay of kaons Improved branching ratio measurement for the decay K0L \u2192 \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212, D.

In 1990, the E791 collaboration was joined by Prof. Val Fitch's group from Princeton to conduct a search for a hypothetical doubly-strange dibaryon H. The experiment E888 (1991-1992) used a reconfigured apparatus of E791 and set stringent limits on the production of H. Search for the weak decay of an H dibaryon, J. Belz et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 76 (1996) 3277-3280, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.3277, Phys. Rev. C56 (1997) 116, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.56.1164 In 1995, Lang joined a newly proposed MINOS experiment at Fermilab, a long-baseline search for neutrino oscillations. Discovery of neutrino oscillations in Japan in 1998 invigorated the physics program of MINOS that took data between 2003 (since 2005 with the NuMI neutrino beam) and 2012. The experiments operated two detectors separated by 734 km. It continued at a higher beam energy as MINOS+ between 2013 and 2016. Lang and Prof. Jennifer Anne Thomas of UCL are Co- Spokespersons of MINOS+. Together, MINOS and MINOS+ achieved some of the most precise determination of oscillation parameters \u03b823 and \u0394m232 and have set some of the most stringent constraints on the existence of sterile neutrinos ``Measurement of Neutrino and Antineutrino Oscillations Using Beam and Atmospheric Data in MINOS, P. Adamson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 (2013) no.25, 251801, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.251801 Search for sterile neutrinos in MINOS and MINOS+ using a two-detector fit, P. Adamson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 (2019) no.9, 091803, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.091803 and other processes beyond the Standard Model. Since 2004 Lang has also contributed to the NEMO-3 and SuperNEMO experiments designed to discover the neutrinoless double-beta decay. This process, if observed, would demonstrate neutrino to be a Majorana particle (i.e., particle and anti-particle represent the same fundamental quantum field). The NEMO detection technique was invented by Serge Jullian and collaborators at LAL Orsay and successfully applied to seven isotopic samples of NEMO-3 (Ca-48, Se-82, Zr-96, Mo-100, Cd-116, Te-130, and Nd-150). NEMO-3 has reached an upper limit for an effective neutrino mass of 330 - 620 meV, Results of the search for neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay in Mo-100 with the NEMO-3 experiment,' R. Arnold et al., Phys.Rev. D92 (2015) no.7, 072011, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.072011 where the range reflects the uncertainty of the nuclear matrix element. The goal of SuperNEMO is further improvement of the experimental method that would allow to probe the effective neutrino mass in the 50 meV range.
