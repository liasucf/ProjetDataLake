It was acquired from the Gonzagas by Charles I of Great Britain. On his execution it was valued at \u00a380 and sold, before being reacquired by the royal family on the Restoration. It now hangs in Kensington Palace. ==See also== * Muses in popular culture ==External links== *https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/13/collection/405476/the- muses Category:Paintings by Tintoretto Category:Paintings of the Royal Collection of the United Kingdom Category:1578 paintings Category:Greek Muses ",
