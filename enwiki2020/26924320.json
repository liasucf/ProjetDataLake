    "text": "Latvia was represented by Marie N, with the song \"I Wanna\" (previously billed as \"I Wonna\"), at the 2002 Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 25 May in Tallinn, Estonia. It went on to bring Latvia victory in only their third Eurovision participation. This was at the time the shortest time lapse between first participation and first victory of any country not present at the inaugural contest of 1956; however it was bettered in 2004 when Ukraine won the contest at their second attempt. Latvia had originally been relegated from the 2002 contest following a bad result in 2001, but were reprieved when Portugal opted out. ==Before Eurovision== === Eirodziesma 2002 === The final took place on 2 March 2002 at the Olympic Centre in Ventspils, hosted by Ija Circene and \u0112riks Niedra. The song with the highest number of votes from the public, \"I Wonna\" performed by Marie N, was declared the winner.ESC National Finals database 2002 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" ! colspan=\"6\" |Final \u2013 2 March 2002 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

Rather than the song itself, the exceptionally slick and memorable stage presentation and choreography of Marie N and her backers, combined with the advantageous late performance draw, is largely credited for the victory. When voting started the contest quickly turned into a two-horse race between Latvia and Malta with voting always very tight between the two. Malta held a marginal lead over the first half before Latvia gradually edged ahead, finally claiming victory with 176 points to Malta's 164. \"I Wanna\" picked up maximum 12s from Estonia, Germany, Israel, Lithuania and Spain, with only Romania failing to award the song any points at all. The 12 points from the Latvian televote were awarded to Estonia.ESC History - Latvia 2002 ===Points awarded to Latvia=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Points awarded to Latvia |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | * * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | |} ===Points awarded by Latvia=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} ==See also== *Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 2002 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 Category:Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:2002 in Latvia ",
