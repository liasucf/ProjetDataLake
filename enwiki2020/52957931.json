    "text": "The World of Anna Sui was an exhibition housed at London's Fashion and Textile Museum from May 26 to October 1, 2017. The exhibition was curated by the museum's head curator Dennis Nothdruft and focused on the effect of Sui's work on the history of fashion design. The exhibit featured over 100 looks from the Sui\u2019s archive, spanning the entirety the designer's career from 1981 to 2017. It also marked the first time an American fashion designer had been the feature of a retrospective exhibit in the United Kingdom. One key theme of the exhibition was the exploration of national identity through the medium of fashion and textiles. == See also == * The Fashion and Textile Museum * Anna Sui * History of fashion design == References == Category:Fashion exhibitions Category:Exhibitions in the United Kingdom Category:2017 in art Category:History of clothing Category:Fashion events in the United Kingdom Category:American fashion ",
