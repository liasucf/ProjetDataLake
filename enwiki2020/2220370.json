    "text": "\"The Dance\" is a song written and composed by Tony Arata, and recorded by American country music singer Garth Brooks as the tenth and final track from his self-titled debut album, from which it was also released as the album's fourth and final single in April 1990. It is considered by many to be Brooks' signature song. In a 2015 interview with Patrick Kielty of BBC Radio 2, Brooks credits the back to back success of both \"The Dance\" and its follow up \"Friends in Low Places\" for his phenomenal success. ==Background== At the opening of the music video, Brooks explains that the song is written with a double meaning - both as a love song about the end of a passionate relationship, and a story of someone dying because of something he believes in, after a moment of glory. * Key: G Major * Length - 3:42 ==Music video== The song's music video, directed by John Lloyd Miller, features an introduction by Brooks himself explaining the alternative meaning of the song. The video shows several American icons and examples of people who died for a dream. These include archive footage of the following: * Lane Frost - World Champion Bull rider, who was killed in 1989 by the bull he rode for a full eight seconds during a rodeo. * Keith Whitley - Country singer who died in 1989 from alcohol poisoning. The Whitley scenes featured his then-wife Lorrie Morgan. * Martin Luther King Jr. - Baptist minister who is best known for his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement and was assassinated in 1968. * The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger, shortly before it disintegrated after its launch in 1986. * John F. Kennedy - President of the United States who was assassinated in 1963. * John Wayne - Film actor best known for his roles in Westerns.
