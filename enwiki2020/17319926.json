    "text": "K\u00e2te is a Papuan language spoken by about 6,000 people in the Finschhafen District of Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. It is part of the Finisterre\u2013Huon branch of the Trans\u2013New Guinea language family (McElhanon 1975, Ross 2005). It was adopted for teaching and mission work among speakers of Papuan languages by the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea in the early 1900s and at one time had as many as 80,000 second-language speakers. ==Dialects== The name K\u00e2te means 'forest', an epithet for the inlanders on the tip of the Huon peninsula, excepting the people living along the Mape River (Flierl and Strauss 1977). The coastal people to the south, mostly speaking Jab\u00eam, are called H\u00e2wec 'sea' and those to the north, speaking Momare and Migabac, are called Sop\u00e2c 'grass'. These were geographical rather than language names. The indigenous glossonyms referred to smaller linguistics units that can be called dialects. McElhanon (1974: 16) identifies five dialects at the time of earliest mission contact in 1886, each named according to how they pronounce a common word or phrase. * Wana ('where?'), the southernmost dialect * Wamor\u00e2 ('why?') * M\u00e2gobineng ('they are saying it') or Bamot\u00e2 ('why?'), nearly extinct in 1974 * Parec, already extinct by 1974 * Wemo ('what?') or Wena, adopted as the mission lingua franca Wana and Wemo are nearly identical, but they differ considerably from M\u00e2gobineng and Wamor\u00e2, to such an extent that these might be considered to be three closely related languages. Parec was probably a transitional dialect between Wemo and Wamor\u00e2. The K\u00e2te dialects formed a chain with the neighboring Mape dialects. All dialects of the chain are being supplanted by Wemo (Suter 2014: 19). ==Phonology== ===Vowels (orthographic)=== K\u00e2te distinguishes six vowels. The low back vowel \u00e2 (representing /\u0254/) sounds like the vowel of English law or saw (Pilhofer 1933: 14). Length is not distinctive. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! ! Front ! Back |- ! High | i | u |- ! Mid | e | o |- ! Low | a | \u00e2 |} ===Consonants (orthographic)=== The glottal stop, written -c, only occurs after a vowel and Pilhofer first describes it as a vowel feature that distinguishes, for instance, bo 'sugarcane' from boc 'very' and si 'planting' from sic 'broth'. However, McElhanon (1974) notes that final glottal stop is barely phonemic in the Wemo dialect, but corresponds to a wider variety of syllable-final consonants in Western Huon languages (-p, -t, -k, -m, -n, -\u014b), which are neutralized (to -c, -\u014b) in the Eastern Huon languages, including K\u00e2te. Pilhofer (1933) writes the lateral flap with an l, but Schneuker (1962) and Flierl and Strauss (1977) write it with an r. The fricatives f and w are both labiodentals, according to Pilhofer (1933), but bilabials, according to Flierl and Strauss (1977). Alveopalatal z and \u0292 are affricates, [ts] and [dz] respectively, but they otherwise pattern like the stops, except that z only occurs between vowels, while \u0292 occurs morpheme- initially (Flierl and Strauss 1977: xv). Both Pilhofer (1933: 15) and Flierl and Strauss (1977) describe the labiovelars q and \u024b as coarticulated and simultaneously released [kp] and [gb], respectively. (The letter \u024b is a curly q with hooked tail that cannot properly be rendered if it is missing from system fonts.) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! ! Labial ! Labiovelar !

However, this distinction is not maintained in pronominal affixes. The table of free pronouns is from Pilhofer (1933: 51-52). Personal pronouns are only used to refer to animate beings. Demonstratives are used to refer to inanimates. Like nouns, free pronouns can occur in subject or object positions in clauses, although the longer form of the singular pronouns (noni, goki, eki) can only occur in subject position (Schneuker 1962: 28). Like nouns, free pronouns can also occur with directional affixes and case- marking postpositions, as in no-raonec 'from me'. go-raopec 'toward you', n\u00e2he-hec 'with him and me', ja\u014be t\u00e2miric 'without them'. The forms in parentheses ending in -c are \"emphatic pronouns\" and can be added to regular pronouns, as in go gahac 'you yourself' or jahe jahac 'they themselves'. The free pronouns can also be appended to nouns to indicate (1) number, as in \u014bic ja\u014be (man 3pl) 'the men' and qaqazu n\u00e2\u014be (teacher 1pl) 'we teachers'; (2) definiteness, as in \u014bokac e (woman 3sg) 'the woman'; or (3) person, as in qaqazu-ge no (teacher-2sg 1sg) 'me your teacher'. A free pronoun coreferent with the head noun frequently marks the end of a relative clause and the resumption of the matrix sentence, as in \u014bic monda-o ware-wec e \u0292ira mi fo-wec (man Monday-on come-3sgFPst 3sg here not sleep-3sgFPst) 'the man who came on Monday did not stay here'. (Schneuker 1962: 31-32) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! Free pronouns ! Singular ! Dual ! Plural |- ! 1st person inclusive | | n\u00e2h\u00e2c | n\u00e2\u014b\u00e2c |- ! 1st person exclusive | no(ni) (nahac) | n\u00e2he (n\u00e2h\u00e2c) | n\u00e2\u014be (n\u00e2\u014b\u00e2c) |- ! 2nd person | go(ki) (gahac) | \u014bohe (\u014bahac) | \u014bo\u014be (\u014ba\u014bac) |- ! 3rd person | e(ki) (jahac) | jahe (jahac) | ja\u014be (ja\u014bac) |- |} ====Genitive pronouns==== K\u00e2te has two types pronominal genitives: possessive suffixes on nouns, and preposed free pronouns suffixed with -re after final vowels or -ne after forms ending in -c (glottal stop) (Pilhofer 1933: 54-57; Schneuker 1962: 27-32). The latter suffix resembles the invariable -ne that turns nouns into adjectives, as in op\u00e2 'water' > op\u00e2-ne 'watery', hulili 'rainbow' > hulili-ne 'rainbow-colored', h\u00e2moc 'death' > h\u00e2moc-ne 'dead', or fiuc 'theft' > fiuc-ne 'thievish' (Pilhofer 1933: 49). Examples of preposed possessive pronouns include no-re fic 'my house'; no nahac-ne fic 'my very own house'; e-re h\u00e2mu 'his/her coconut palm'; ja\u014be-re wiak 'their concern/matter' (Schneuker 1962: 28). {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Simple vowel-final verb stems are obligatorily affixed with -c before accusative suffixes, except when the 3rd person singular object suffix is zero. Compare mamac-zi hone-c-gu-wec 'father saw me' vs. mamac-zi hone-wec 'father saw him/her'. (Pilhofer 1933: 38-43; Schneuker 1962: 29-30) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Accusative suffixes !! Singular !!

(Schneuker 1962: 30) ====Indirect object suffixes==== Indirect object (dative) suffixes come between dative verb stems and the subject-marking suffixes (Pilhofer 1933: 40-43; Schneuker 1962: 30), {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Dative suffixes !! Singular !! Dual !! Plural |- | 1st person || -nare- || -n\u00e2cte- || -n\u00e2re- |- | 2nd person || -gare- || -\u014bacte- || -\u014bare- |- | 3rd person || -cne- || -jacte- || -jare- |} * Ne\u014bgoc-ge-zi n\u00e2n\u00e2 ba-ware-gare-wec me? * (mother-2sg-Erg food hold-come-2sgDat-3sgFPst Ques) * Did your mother bring you some food?' (Schneuker 1962: 31) ===Verb morphology=== ====Final (independent) verbs==== Each finite independent verb is suffixed to show tense and the grammatical person of the subject. There are five tense forms: present, near past, far past, near future, and far future. Animate subjects are marked for three persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and three numbers (singular, dual, plural), although the same suffixes are used for both 2nd and 3rd person dual and plural. Inanimate subjects are only marked as 3rd person singular. Durative aspect can be conveyed by adding -e- before the present tense marker or -ju- before the near past tense marker. Two hortative moods can be signaled by subtracting final -mu from the near future tense suffix (to elicit more immediate responses) or substituting a different but similar set of final subject markers (to elicit responses over longer-terms). (Pilhofer 1933: 26-32) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Present tense (\u00b1 durative -e-) !! Singular !! Dual !!

Coordinate-dependent (clause-medial) verbs are not marked for tense (or mood), but only for whether their actions are sequential, simultaneous, or durative in relation to the next verb in the SR clause chain. If the subject is the same (SS) as that of the next verb, its person and number is not marked. Verbs are suffixed for person and number only when their subject changes (DS). One dependent verb may be marked for both Durative and Simultaneous if its duration is extended enough to overlap with the beginning of the event described by the next clause. (Pilhofer 1933: 35-36) The examples come from Schneuker (1962). {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Same-subject (SS) suffixes !! |- | Sequential (Seq) || -r\u00e2 |- | Simultaneous (Sim) || -huc |- | Durative (Dur) || -ku |} * Hata-o ra-huc homa moc hone-po. * (road-on go-SimSS snake one see-1sgFPst) * 'Going along the road I saw a snake.'

(1933: 36) ====Other verbal affixes==== =====Adverbial affixes===== A small class of adverbial intensifying affixes can be added before final inflectional suffixes (Pilhofer 1933: 81-82). Examples include -f\u00e2re- 'all, together'; -j\u00e2mb\u00e2\u014bke- 'truly'; -h\u00e2mo- 'well, thoroughly'; saricke- 'well, skillfully'; sana\u014bke- 'firmly, permanently'; -(b)ipie- 'futilely, in vain'. Sentence examples from Schneuker (1962: 154-158) follow. * No motec jaza-f\u00e2re-pac (1sg boy tell-all-1sgPst) 'I told all the boys.' * Motec ja\u014be mamasiri e-j\u00e2mb\u00e2\u014bke- mbi\u014b (boy 3pl play do-truly-3plFPst) 'The boys really played.' * N\u00e2n\u00e2 mi \u0292\u00e2- h\u00e2mo-kac (food not cook-thoroughly-3sgPres) 'The food isn't cooked thoroughly.' * Fic kec\u0292i-zi \u014be-sana\u014bke-ocmu (house this-Erg last- permanently-3sgFut) 'This house will last forever.' * So\u014ba\u014b-zi d\u00e2\u014b mu-ipie-wec (elder-Erg word speak-in.vain-3sgFPst) 'The elder spoke in vain.' ==Evolution== Below are some K\u00e2te (Wemo dialect) reflexes of proto-Trans-New Guinea proposed by Pawley (2012): {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! proto-Trans- New Guinea !!
