Beliatore is the birthplace of artist Jamini Roy.It has some villages around...like Oltora, Chandar, Bandhkana, Bandkana, kanchchala etc Indian Art Circle ==History== Binoy Ghosh visited Beliatotre in 1968, primarily to attend the Gajan and fair of Dharmathakur held on the occasion of Ashadha Purnima. Three deities \u2013 Dharmaraj, Swarupnarayan, Madan \u2013 were taken on large wooden horses and the ritual of ban-phonra (piercing of tongue, hand or breast with bamboo splinters) was performed by devotees from the lower castes such as Bauris, Khaira, Lohar and others. The village was predominantly populated by the people of lower castes, mainly Bauris, in earlier days. Some well-to-do trading families came and settled there and around two hundred years ago the zamindars, the Roy family, came in. Both belonged to the upper castes. The worship of Dharmathakur, in its present form, was taken up at Beliatore after both the zamindar and trading families had dreams about it. The worship of a popular folk deity of the lower castes was taken up by the upper caste people as per dream wishes and obviously as a part of the process of Brahminisation in the area. With the passage of time, the proportion of upper caste people in the village has gone up and that of the lower castes has come down. Manasa puja and Bhadu festival are celebrated in a big way. In earlier days, Jhapan Utsav, with display of live snakes, was celebrated in Beliatore, but it has been discontinued.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part I, 1976 edition, pages 394-399, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata Kachu Roy came and first settled in Jagannathpur and then moved to Beliatore, around 200 years prior to Binoy Ghosh\u2019s visit. Kachu Roy had three sons \u2013 Atmaram, Banchharam and Panchanan. The renowned artist Jamini Roy was great grandson of Panchanan Roy.
