    "text": "Gender inequality in Nigeria is influenced by different cultures and beliefs. In most parts of Nigeria, women are considered subordinate to their male counterparts, especially in Northern Nigeria. It is generally believed that women are best suited as home keepers. Feminism had not appeared in Nigeria until roughly 40 years ago. This has been attributed to Funmilayo Ransome- Kuti. She was born in Nigeria, and was educated through the British schooling system. She supported and fought for women's rights, as well as for women having a larger impact in the Nigerian government. She was a part of the WIDF (Women's International Democratic Federation), which helped more women to gain government positions, furthering what she wished to accomplish with women in Nigeria. Ransome-Kuti died in 1978. One of Nigeria's well-known newspapers referred to her as \"a progressive revolutionary\" and \"a Pan-African visionary.\"Johnson-Odim, Cheryl. \"'For Their Freedoms': The Anti-imperialist and International Feminist Activity of Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti of Nigeria.\" ScienceDirect. Elsevier, 2009. Web. 23 Oct. 2016 Historically, feminist movements have tried to push agendas leading to more gender equality in Nigeria. Among the most known are Federation of Nigerian Women's Societies (FNWS), Women in Nigeria (WIN), Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND) and Female in Nigeria (FIN). Still, most of them have failed to bring about significant political, social or economic growth. Though not without protest, new feminist movements and gender awareness are forming in Nigeria. Online, women are using mobile phones for social capital building and empowerment, to access information and to form relationships with communities they would not normally engage with. == See also == * Women in Nigeria * Female empowerment in Nigeria * Girl Child Labour in Nigeria * Female genital mutilation in Nigeria * Prostitution in Nigeria ==References == Category:Women's rights in Nigeria Category:Women in Nigeria Nigeria ",
