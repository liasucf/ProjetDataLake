The costal area is streaked with ochreous and there are two dark postmedial costal marks, three hyaline (glass like) patches beyond the lower angle of the cell, as well as dark specks on the veins between them, and bounded by an oblique ochreous postmedial line. There is also an indistinct minutely dentate ochreous submarginal line. The hindwings have an oblique dark antemedial line, three hyaline patches beyond the lower angle of the cell, a dark-edged ochreous postraedial line and a dentate ochreous submarginal line.Transactions of the Entomological Society of London 1902 ==References== Category:Moths described in 1902 Category:Drepaninae Category:Taxa named by Charles Swinhoe ",
