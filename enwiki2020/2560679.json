Kuiek became known as Ani Lorak in March 1995 when she took part in a contest at the television program \"Morning Star\" in Moscow, Russia. There was a Russian singer with the same name already enrolled in that competition so Kuiek had to invent a stage name. Ani Lorak is the name Karolina read backwards. Ani Lorak moved to Kyiv in 1995. By that time her name was well known in Ukrainian show business. She became even more popular after winning the \"Big Apple Music 1996 Competition\" in New York City.

Her narrow defeat in the 2005 national pre-selection competition was particularly controversial, given that the winners, GreenJolly, did not have to qualify for the final by winning one of the fifteen preliminary heats (unlike her). Lorak finished in second place in the Ukrainian national final with the song A Little Shot Of Love. ===2008=== Having come close to singing the home country's entry in 2005, when Ukraine staged the Eurovision Song Contest, Ukrainian television NTU announced in late December that Ani Lorak, one of the country's most successful singers would represent the country at Eurovision in Belgrade and that the public and a jury would choose the song. On 23 February, Ani performed five potential entries, in a special show and the winner, chosen by both the public and by the jury was \"Shady Lady\",Clip of performance of \"Shady Lady\" at the preselection written by Greek composer and producer Dimitris Kontopoulos, also known in the Eurovision bubble. She also recorded a Russian version of her Eurovision song \"Shady Lady\" with the title \"S neba v nebo\". Ani had visited other countries to present her song, like Malta, Russia, Bulgaria, Spain and Germany. At the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest in Belgrade, she sang the song \"Shady Lady\" in the second semi final on 23 May 2008, winning a place in the final. She took the second place in the final after Dima Bilan. She was awarded a prize for being the Best Artist at the contest from the media. Italian designer Roberto Cavalli designed a dress for Ani Lorak performance at the festival. The ornate dress was made with Swarovski Diamonds, and her choreography produced by Fokas Evangelinos who designed the stage show for her entry. He also arranged the stage shows of Greece 2005, Russia 2006 and Belarus 2007. == Charity == Lorak spends a lot of time on charitable activities. Since 2004-2005 Lorak has been a UN Goodwill Ambassador on HIV/AIDS in Ukraine. UNICEF and UN in Ukraine have awarded a commendation to Lorak for assistance and help to HIV positive citizens of Ukraine. In 2005, Lorak was conferred with the St. Stanislav Order of the 4th degree and the Officer's Cross \"for strengthening the international authority of Ukraine, for the high professionalism, great creative achievements, charity and adherence to the ideals of chivalry\".Biography (Official website) ==Albums== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
