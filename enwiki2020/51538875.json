He said that the story is developed with elements of drama to make the audience interested in the characters. According to the screenwriter, Kim Kematt, \"This is a drama film with horror spices. The audience will see something new. That, horror films can not only show fear and shock. But there are also very strong stories. Furthermore, the point is, we all live side by side with other dimensions.\" The film sparked controversy because Laudya Cynthia Bella is not wearing a hijab (veil) in the film even though Bella has worn a hijab since January 2015. She clarified on October 27, 2015, that this film was shot before Bella made her decision to wear a hijab. == Release == The film's release was delayed from March 2015 to November 2015, because of 21 Cineplex's tight schedule and the need to cut some scenes. == Reception == According to Puput Puji Lestari from Fimela, this film is not an ordinary horror and it provides drama and comedy between the tension. She praised Bella's and Saputra's acting but thought that the sound arrangement is \"loose\". == References == == External links == * * @Official Trailer KAKAK (Sister) Category:Indonesian films Category:Indonesian horror films Category:2015 horror films ",
