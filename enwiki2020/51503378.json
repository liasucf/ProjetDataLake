Early in her career, she focused on questions of human health and the environment, co-authoring Environmentalism and the New Logic of Business (Oxford, 2000) and The Ethics of Environmentally Responsible Health Care (Oxford, 2004). Since the 2000s, much of her work has focused on human relationships with animals. She collaborated with Marc Bekoff for Wild Justice (Chicago, 2010), and authored The Last Walk (Chicago, 2012) and Run, Spot, Run (Chicago, 2016). ==Career== Pierce completed her Bachelor of Arts at Scripps College, before studying for a Master of Divinity at Divinity School of Harvard University.

Edward, Jessica Pierce and Richard H. Dodd (2000). Environmentalism and the New Logic of Business. Oxford: Oxford University Press.

During her time at Colorado, her second book, The Ethics of Environmentally Responsible Health Care (co-written with Andrew Jameton) was published by Oxford,Pierce, Jessica, and Andrew Jameton (2004).

Having previously focussed her research on human health, including her early research interests in the connections between health and the environment, Pierce began to focus her research on animals in the 2000s. She co-authored Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals with the ecologist and ethologist Marc Bekoff, and this was published in 2010 by the University of Chicago Press.Bekoff, Marc, and Jessica Pierce (2010). Wild Justice. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. In the book, the authors draw upon evolutionary theory and ethology to argue that many animals display evidence of consciousness, as well as a range of behaviours which they categorise under the categories of cooperation, empathy and justice. These observations are used to make a case that animals may have a sense of morality.Sax, Boria (2010). \"Book review: Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals\".
