She grew up in Eidsvoll. Her brother Ingvald Falch, Jr. (1884\u20131962) became a district stipendiary magistrate too. In September 1900 she married Kristian Schreiner. Their Johan Schreiner became a noted historian, and through another son, civil servant Fredrik Schreiner they had the grandson Per Schreiner, an economist and civil servant. ==Career== She took her examen artium at Ragna Nielsens skole in 1892 and graduated with the cand.med. degree in 1899. She was also an intern at the hospital Rikshospitalet in 1900, before studying children's and women's illnesses abroad. She was never hired in an academic position, but conducted research together with her husband, who was a professor. They released textbooks on the human organism for university students in three volumes between 1918 and 1921, and a textbook for school students in 1923. Her most read book was Slegtslivet hos menneskene. In the 1920s the couple became more involved in physical anthropology. She released Antropologische Studien an norwegische Frauen in 1924, Die Nord-Norweger. Anthropologische Untersuchungen an Soldaten in 1929 and two books under the moniker Anthropologische Lokaluntersuchungen in 1930 and 1932. Neither of them delved into the Nazi type of racial hygiene. Her husband and son were even imprisoned by Nazis in Grini concentration camp.Giertsen, ed 1946: p. 330 However, Alette Schreiner held that all races contained elements with unsatisfactory genetics. Schreiner also helped establishing Blindern studenthjem, the sole students' dormitory at Blindern.
