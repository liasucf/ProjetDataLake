    "text": "France was represented by their 1962 Eurovision Song Contest winner Isabelle Aubret, with the song '\"La Source\", at the 1968 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 6 April in London. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster ORTF. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Aubret performed 10th in the running order, following Finland and preceding Italy. \"La Source\" was a deceptively gentle-sounding song with a much-praised lilting musical arrangement which, to non-French speakers, hid lyrics often said to deal with the darkest subject matter - rape and murder - ever heard in a Eurovision song.\"La Source\" translation @ diggiloo.net In the early voting Aubret appeared to be on course to become the first performer to score two Eurovision victories, as after six juries had voted \"La Source\" held a seemingly commanding lead of 17 points over the United Kingdom on 10. Then the song suffered one of Eurovision's more spectacular voting collapses, gaining only 3 more points from the remaining ten juries - and none at all from the final six - to finish the evening in third place with 20 points. The French jury awarded 4 points apiece to eventual contest winners Spain and runners-up the United Kingdom.ESC History - France 1968 ==See also== *France in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1968 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 Category:France in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1968 in France ",
