    "text": "Leanderthal Lady, discovered in January 1983, is the skeletal remains of a prehistoric woman found at the Wilson-Leonard Brushy Creek Site (an ancient Native American campsite) in the city of Cedar Park, Texas, by the Texas Department of Transportation. The remains were also alternatively labeled \"Leanne\". Both names were inspired by the proximity of the site to the town of Leander, to the north. ==Analysis== Carbon dating and stratigraphic analysis showed the remains to be 10,000 to 13,000 years old. The skeleton is of a tall female who was approximately eighteen to thirty years old at the time of death. The find was significant as one of the oldest and most complete human skeleton finds in North America. ==See also== *List of unsolved deaths ==References== ==External links== *Leanne's Burial Category:1983 archaeological discoveries Category:1983 in Texas Category:Oldest human remains in the Americas Category:People from Cedar Park, Texas Category:People from Leander, Texas Category:Unsolved deaths Category:Williamson County, Texas ",
