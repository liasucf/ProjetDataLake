    "text": "Cape d'Or lighthouse overlooking the Dory Rips The Dory Rips is a phenomenon involving extreme tidal agitation of waters located in the Bay of Fundy off the headland of Cape d'Or in Nova Scotia, Canada. The phenomenon occurs at the entrance to the Minas Basin, which is known for the globe's highest tides.Tides at Central Nova Scotia Tourism AssociationHigh/Low Tidal Finder; Worldwide Tide Forecast website (enter country, then location); accessed October 2015 The turbulence does not result from a simple rip tide, but rather from the collision of three opposed tidal currents whose violence is enhanced by the presence of a subsurface reef that forces the water upward. The powerful incoming tidal current loops back and collides with itself while another current, coursing in semicircular fashion around Advocate Bay, slams into the collision point at a 90-degree angle. ==Marine Hazard== Diagram showing the currents creating the Dory Rips To warn mariners away from the Dory Rips, a foghorn was placed at Cape d'Or in 1875 and a lighthouse, which is still operational, was established in 1922.\"Cape d'Or Lighthouse\" at Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society ==See also== * Rip current ==References== d'Or Category:Tides Category:Tourist attractions in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia ",
