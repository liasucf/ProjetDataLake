    "text": "J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.S. 127 (1994), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court ruling that peremptory challenges based solely on a prospective juror's sex is unconstitutional.. J.E.B. extended the court's existing precedent in Batson v. Kentucky (1986), which found race- based peremptory challenges in criminal trials unconstitutional,. and Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company (1991), which extended that principle to civil trials.. As in Batson, the court found that sex-based challenges violate the Equal Protection Clause. == Background == On behalf of T.B., the mother of a minor child, the state sued J.E.B. for child support in Jackson County, Alabama. During jury selection, challenges intentionally targeted male potential jurors resulting in an all-female jury. == Decision == The Majority opinion was written by Justice Blackmun. Justice O'Connor wrote a concurring opinion, and Justice Kennedy separately concurred in the judgment. Chief Justice Rehnquist filed a separate dissenting opinion. Justice Scalia also filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Thomas. == See also == *Hoyt v.
