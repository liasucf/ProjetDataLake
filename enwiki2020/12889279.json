The group's sound had developed and Coulter, as well as playing piano on the record, had brought in other instrumentalists as well. The album featured \"Scorn Not His Simplicity\", a song that Coulter had composed about his own son, who had Down syndrome, as well as a poem penned by Luke Kelly entitled \"For What Died The Sons Of R\u00f3is\u00edn?\".
