    "text": "No. 190 Squadron was a Royal Air Force squadron with a relatively short existence, but a very broad career. It served as a trainer squadron during the first World War and as convoy escort, airborne support and transport squadron during World War II. ==History== ===Formation in World War I=== No 190 Squadron was formed at Rochford, England on 24 October 1917 as a night training squadron operating amongst others the Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2e and the Airco DH.6. The squadron moved to RAF Newmarket, Suffolk on 14 March 1918 and was disbanded a year later at RAF Upwood in April 1919. ===Reformation with Coastal Command=== The squadron was re-formed on 1 March 1943 at Sullom Voe, Scotland. The squadron operated the Consolidated Catalina to patrol the North Atlantic. The first U-boat was sunk in the first month of operations. The main role of the squadron was protecting the convoys to and from Russia (\"Operation Locomotive\"). The squadron disbanded on 31 December 1943, when it was re-numbered to 210 Squadron. ===Airborne Forces squadron=== The squadron was re-formed again five days later, on 5 January 1944 at RAF Leicester East as an airborne support unit flying the Short Stirling. It became part of 38 Group on 6 November 1943. On 6 June 1944 the squadron first carried 426 paratroopers to Caen, France. The squadron then returned and the next night towed 18 Airspeed Horsa gliders into France. It moved to RAF Fairford and carried out supply-dropping missions to the advancing troops and SOE operatives. The squadron involvement in supply drops at Battle of Arnhem caused 11 aircraft losses in 3 days. The next move was to RAF Great Dunmow where it towed gliders for the Rhine crossing and paratroopers into the Netherlands to disrupt the German retreat. ===On Halifaxes as Transport Squadron=== As the war ended the squadron re-equipped with the Handley Page Halifax which it used as a freighter for Transport Command until the end of 1945. It was disbanded at Great Dunmow on 21 January 1946 by being renumbered to 295 Squadron. ==Aircraft operated== {|class=\"wikitable\" |+Aircraft operated by No 190 Squadron RAF, data from ! From !!
