    "text": "Funk Your Head Up is the second studio album by American hip hop group Ultramagnetic MCs. It was released on March 17, 1992 via Mercury Records/PolyGram. Many of the tracks were remixed by outside producers at Mercury Records' insistence. The result was an album that disappointed hardcore fans of the group, while doing little to improve their sales. The sole hit single was a Beatminerz remix of \"Poppa Large\" that was not included on the album. ==Track listing== == Personnel == * Keith Matthew Thornton - main artist, producer * Maurice Russell Smith - main artist, producer * Cedric Ulmont Miller - main artist, producer * Trevor Randolph - main artist, producer * Timothy Blair - featured artist (tracks: 21, 23) * Henrik Milling - featured artist & producer (track 9) * Charles Lewis - producer (track 17) * Henrik Leif Marquart - co-producer (tracks: 3, 16, 19) * William \"Spaceman\" Patterson - guitar (tracks: 10, 15, 16, 21) * Alli Truch - art direction & design * Michael Bays - art direction * Michael Lavine - photography ==References== ==External links== Category:1992 albums Category:Mercury Records albums Category:Ultramagnetic MCs albums ",
