He is the recipient of several accolades, including two Academy Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, a BAFTA award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019. After pursuing an MFA degree from New York University, Ali began his career as a regular on television series, such as Crossing Jordan (2001\u20132002) and Threat Matrix (2003\u20132004), before his breakthrough role as Richard Tyler in the science fiction series The 4400 (2004\u20132007). His first major film release was in the David Fincher-directed fantasy The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). He gained wider attention for his supporting role in the Netflix political thriller series House of Cards (2013\u20132016), as Boggs in the final two films of The Hunger Games film series, and as Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes in the Luke Cage series. Ali won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances as Juan in the drama film Moonlight (2016) and for his portrayal of Don Shirley in the comedy-drama film Green Book (2018). This made him the first black actor to win two Academy Awards in the same category. In 2019, he played the lead role of a troubled police officer in the third season of the HBO anthology crime series True Detective. In 2020, he starred in the second season of the Hulu comedy-drama series Ramy. == Early life and education == Mahershala Ali was born as Mahershalalhashbaz Gilmore in 1974, in Oakland, California, the son of Phillip Gilmore (1956\u20131994) and Willicia Goines (born 1957). He was raised a Christian in Hayward, California by his mother, an ordained Baptist minister. His father was an actor who appeared on Broadway. Maher-shalal-hash-baz is the name of a prophetic child in chapter 8 of the Biblical Book of Isaiah.

He entered SMC with a basketball scholarship and went by the name \"Hershal Gilmore\" when playing for the SMC Gaels.

This later landed him an apprenticeship at the California Shakespeare Theater following graduation. After a sabbatical year working for Gavin Report, he enrolled in New York University's graduate acting program at Tisch School of the Arts, earning his master's degree in 2000. In 2000, he converted to Islam, changed his surname from Gilmore to Ali, and joined the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.

Ali was known professionally by his full name, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, from 2001 until 2010, when he began to be credited as Mahershala Ali. Ali had considered shortening his name for a while, saying that using his full first name was \"a crazy thing to do considering that we're in Hollywood\", although he had never been pressured by managers or agents to change it. He decided to use a shorter version of his first name after being told that his full name was too long to fit on the poster for the film The Place Beyond the Pines. He did not want the alternative of \"M. Ali\" to represent himself on the poster, so he chose to adopt the shorter version of his name.

Other notable films include Predators, The Place Beyond the Pines, Free State of Jones, Hidden Figures, and as Boggs in The Hunger Games series.
