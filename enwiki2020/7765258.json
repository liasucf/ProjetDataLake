    "text": "Mono traditional narratives include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the Mono people, including the Owens Valley Paiute east of the Sierra Nevada and the Monache on that range's western slope, in present-day eastern California. An interesting contrast exists in Mono oral literature. The eastern group, the Owens Valley Paiute, have narratives that most closely match those of their Great Basin kinsmen, the Northern Paiute, Shoshone, Southern Paiute, and Kawaiisu. The traditions of the western group, the Monache, are more similar to those of such central Californians as the Yokuts and Valley and Sierra Miwok. ==See also== *Traditional narratives (Native California) *Owens Valley ==On-Line Examples of Mono Narratives== * The North American Indian by Edward S.
