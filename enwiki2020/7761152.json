Some of his most noted works are Po\u00e8mes M\u00e9lancoliques (1901), Sonnets- M\u00e9daillons (1909), and Cendres et Flammes. He killed himself by tying a Larousse dictionary around his neck and jumping off a bridge, to expose how the French language, imposed upon him by colonists, had killed him artistically.Henry Louis Gates, Jr, 'Editor's Introduction: Writing 'Race' and the Difference It Makes', Race, Writing and Difference, University of Chicago Press, 1987, page 13 ==References== * Category:1876 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Haitian educators Category:Haitian male poets Category:20th- century Haitian poets Category:20th-century male writers ",
