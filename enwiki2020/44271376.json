Electrical production and aircraft manufacturing regulation was transferred to the Ministry of Munitions. Posts, telephone and telegraph, post office bank and insurance came under the Communications Institute, where issues relating the transportation came under the Directorate General of Shipping. In May 1945, the Communications Institute became the Communications Council, reporting directly to the Cabinet, and the Ministry of Communications and Transport was renamed the Ministry of Transport. ===Post- war dissolution=== After the surrender of Japan, the American occupation authorities briefly reestablished the Ministry of Communications on April 1, 1946; however it was in charge of only posts and telecommunications. The Ministry was formally abolished on April 1, 1949 and its responsibilities divided between the new Ministry of Posts and Ministry of Telecommunications. ==Ministers of Communications== {| class=wikitable ! ||Name|| Cabinet || Date in office || comments |- | align=\"right\" | 1 || Enomoto Takeaki || 1st It\u014d, Kuroda || 22 December 1885 || concurrently Agriculture & Commerce |- | align=\"right\" | 2 || Got\u014d Sh\u014djir\u014d || Kuroda, 1st Yamagata, 1st Matsukata || 30 April 1888 || |- | align=\"right\" | 3 || Kuroda Kiyotaka || 2nd It\u014d || 8 August 1892 || |- | align=\"right\" | 4 || Watanabe Kunitake || 2nd It\u014d || 17 March 1895 || concurrently Finance Minister |- | align=\"right\" | 5 || Shirane Senichi || 2nd It\u014d, 2nd Matsukata || 9 October 1895 || |- | align=\"right\" | 6 || Nomura Yasushi || 2nd Matsukata || 26 September 1898 || |- | align=\"right\" | 7 || Suematsu Kench\u014d || 3rd It\u014d || 12 January 1898 || |- | align=\"right\" | 8 || Hayashi Y\u016bz\u014d || \u014ckuma || 30 June 1898|| |- | align=\"right\" | 9 || Yoshikawa Akimasa || 2nd Yamagata || 8 November 1898 || |- | 10 || Hoshi T\u014dru || 4th It\u014d || 19 October 1900 || |- | 11 || Hara Takashi || 4th It\u014d || 22 December 1900 || |- | 12 || Yoshikawa Akimasa || 1st Katsura || 2 June 1901 || |- | 13 || Sone Arasuke || 1st Katsura || 17 July 1903 || concurrently Finance Minister |- | 14 || \u014cura Kanetake ||1st Katsura || 12 September 1903 || |- | 15 || Yamagata Isabur\u014d || 1st Saionji || 7 July 1906|| |- | 16 || Hara Takashi ||1st Saionji || 14 January 1908 || concurrently Home Minister |- | 17 || Hotta Masayasu || 1st Saionji || 25 March 1908 || |- | 18 || Got\u014d Shinpei ||2nd Katsura || 14 July 1908 || |- | 19 || Hayashi Tadasu || 2nd Katsura || 30 August 1911 || concurrently Home Minister |- | 20 || Got\u014d Shinpei || 3rd Katsura || 21 December 1912 || |- | 21 || Motoda Hajime || 1st Yamamoto || 20 February 1913 || |- | 22 || Taketomi Tokitoshi || 2nd \u014ckuma || 16 April 1914 || |- | 23 || Minoura Katsundo || 2nd \u014ckuma ||10 August 1915 || |- | 24 || Den Kenjir\u014d || Terauchi || 9 October 1916 || |- | 25 || Noda Utar\u014d || Hara, Takahashi || 29 September 1918 || |- | 26 || Maeda Toshisada || Kat\u014d Tomosabur\u014d || 12 June 1922 || |- | 27 || Inukai Tsuyoshi || 2nd Yamamoto || 2 September 1923 || concurrently Education Minister |- | 28 || Yoshir\u014d Fujimura || Kiyoura || 7 January 1924 || |- | 29 || Inukai Tsuyoshi || Kat\u014d Takaaki || 11 June 1924 || |- | 30 || Adachi Kenz\u014d ||Kat\u014d Takaaki, 1st Wakatsuki || 30 May 1925 || |- | 31 || Mochizuki Keisuke|| Tanaka || 20 April 1927 || |- | 32 || Fusanosuke Kuhara|| Tanaka || 23 May 1928 || |- | 33 || Matajir\u014d Koizumi || Hamaguchi, 2nd Wakatsuki || 2 July 1929 || |- | 34 || Ch\u016bz\u014d Mitsuji || Inukai || 13 December 1931 || |- | 35 || Hiroshi Minami || Sait\u014d || 26 May 1932 || |- | 36 || Tokonami Takejir\u014d || Okada || 8 July 1934 || |- | 37 || Keisuke Okada || Okada || 9 September 1935 || concurrently Prime Minister |- | 38 || Mochizuki Keisuke || Okada || 12 September 1935|| |- | 39 || Tanomogi Keikichi || Hirota || 9 March 1936 || |- | 40 || Tatsunosuke Yamazaki || Hayashi || 2 February 1937 || concurrently Agriculture & Forestry Minister |- | 41 || Hideo Kodama || Hayashi || 10 February 1937 || |- | 42 || Ry\u016btar\u014d Nagai|| 1st Konoe || 4 June 1937 || |- | 43 || Suehiko Shiono || Hiranuma || 5 January 1939|| concurrently Justice Minister |- | 44 || Harumichi Tanabe || Hiranuma || 7 April 1939 || |- | 45 || Ry\u016btar\u014d Nagai || Abe || 30 August 1939 || concurrently Railway Minister |- | 46 || Masanori Katsu || Yonai || 16 January 1940 || |- | 47 || Sh\u014dz\u014d Murata || 2nd Konoe, 3rd Konoe || 22 July 1940 || |- | 48 || Ken Terajima || T\u014dj\u014d || 18 October 1941 || |- | 49 || Yoshiaki Hatta || T\u014dj\u014d || 8 October 1943 || concurrently Railway Minister |- |} ==References== * * * * * Category:Politics of the Empire of Japan Communications Category:1885 establishments in Japan Category:1949 disestablishments in Japan ",
