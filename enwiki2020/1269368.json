    "text": "Formoterol, also known as eformoterol, is a long-acting \u03b22 agonist (LABA) used as a bronchodilator in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Formoterol has an extended duration of action (up to 12 h) compared to short-acting \u03b22 agonists such as salbutamol (albuterol), which are effective for 4 h to 6 h. LABAs such as formoterol are used as \"symptom controllers\" to supplement prophylactic corticosteroid therapy. A \"reliever\" short-acting \u03b22 agonist (e.g., salbutamol) is still required, since LABAs are not recommended for the treatment of acute asthma. It was patented in 1972 and came into medical use in 1998. It is also marketed in the combination formulations budesonide/formoterol and mometasone/formoterol. ==Side effects== In November 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a health advisory alerting the public to findings that show the use of long-acting \u03b22 agonists could lead to a worsening of wheezing symptoms in some patients. At the current time, available long-acting \u03b22 agonists include salmeterol, formoterol, bambuterol, and sustained-release oral salbutamol. Combinations of inhaled steroids and long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread \u2013 combination preparations include fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol. ==Mechanism of action== Inhaled formoterol works like other \u03b22 agonists, causing bronchodilation by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airway so as to treat the exacerbation of asthma. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Inhaler for a powder based in budesonide and formoterol It is marketed in three forms: a dry-powder inhaler (DPI), a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and an inhalation solution, under various brand names including Atock, Atimos/Atimos Modulite, Foradil/Foradile, Oxeze/Oxis, and Perforomist. * Foradil/Foradile capsules for oral inhalation (Schering-Plough in the U.S., Novartis rest of world) * Oxeze/Oxis Turbuhaler Dry powder inhaler (DPI) (AstraZeneca) * Atock (Astellas) * Atimos/Atimos Modulite Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) (Chiesi) * Perforomist inhalation solution (Mylan N.V.) ==Uses and combinations== * Arformoterol ((R,R)-(\u2212)-formoterol) \u2014 an enantiopure compound used in the management of COPD * Combination drugs: ** Aclidinium bromide/formoterol ** Budesonide/formoterol ** Mometasone furoate/formoterol ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Beta2-adrenergic agonists Category:Phenol ethers Category:Phenols Category:Schering-Plough brands Category:Merck & Co. brands Category:AstraZeneca brands Category:Novartis brands Category:Formamides Category:Substituted amphetamines Category:Phenylethanolamines pnb:\u0622\u0645\u0648 \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627 ",
