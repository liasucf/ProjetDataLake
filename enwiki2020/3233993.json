Founded in 1954, Bayer bought out Monsanto's shares in the company in the 1970s. Mobay, along with Miles Laboratories, was a member of Bayer's menagerie of companies in the US while Bayer did not own the US rights to its name. After a first failed attempt of appearing under the Bayer USA Inc. name in the US, Bayer consolidated its US operations under the Miles name in 1992. == Military issues == Mobay was one of the suppliers of the dioxin- contaminated 2,4,5-T used to produce the Agent Orange sprayed in Operation Ranch Hand (1962-1972).CBGNetwork, 03/2013 BAYER: Company History Whitewashed (accessed 2013-07-13) Prior to the Gulf War, in April 1990, Mobay and Occidental Chemical Corporation refused to sell chemicals to the Department of Defense for military use (particularly, with thionyl chloride, a chemical needed for the production of sarin.)
