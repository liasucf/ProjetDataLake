Conceived by the Penang state government as part of the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP), the proposed line within the city of George Town will link the city centre with the industrial town of Bayan Lepas to the south. The Bayan Lepas LRT line is one of priority projects to be delivered under PTMP. Nineteen stations are to be built along the stretch. Eight additional stations will also be built on three islets that will be reclaimed off the southern coastline of Penang Island, bringing the overall length of the planned route to . The construction of the LRT line was approved by the federal government on 8 April 2019. Construction is expected to start in June 2020. == Overview == The Bayan Lepas LRT line forms the backbone of the Penang Transportation Master Plan, a comprehensive proposal formulated by the Penang state government to improve transportation within the State of Penang. Among the components of the plan, the LRT line is being prioritised by the state authorities for implementation, as the line will serve a densely populated urban and industrial corridor along the eastern coast of Penang Island, specifically between George Town proper and Bayan Lepas to the south. In addition, the LRT service would facilitate easier commute for tourists arriving via the Penang International Airport in Bayan Lepas. == History == SRS Consortium, a joint venture consisting of Gamuda Berhad, Ideal Property Development Sdn Bhd and Loh Phoy Yen Holdings, was appointed as the Project Delivery Partner (PDP) in 2015. Within the same year, the first public consultation session on the alignment of the proposed route was held. Following the sessions, the route was finalised and 27 stations identified; the eight southernmost stations will be built on three islets which will be reclaimed to the south of Penang Island. Much of the line will be elevated to reduce land acquisition and to preclude the relocation of underground utilities. As public transportation falls under the purview of the Malaysian federal government, the proposal was submitted to the Federal Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) by April 2016 for approval by the federal authorities. However, a political feud between the Pakatan Harapan-led Penang state government and the federal government at the time, which was dominated by Barisan Nasional, led to delays in securing the required federal approval. On 20 June 2020, chairman of the State Works Committee Zairil Khir Johari said that the LRT would continue, with or without the Federal government as it was funded through the land reclamation. == Stations == ==See also== * Transport in Penang == References == ==External links== *Penang Transport Master Plan __INDEX__ Category:Penang Integrated Transportation Masterplan Category:Transport in Penang Category:Proposed rail infrastructure in Malaysia ",
