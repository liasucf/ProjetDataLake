He was a contemporary of Meton and worked closely with this astronomer. Little is known of his work apart from his partnership with Meton and what is mentioned by Ptolemy. With Meton, he made a series of observations of the solstices (the points at which the Sun is seen at the greatest distance from the equator) in order to determine the length of the tropical year. Geminus and Ptolemy quote him as a source on the rising and setting of the stars. Pausanius's Description of Greece names Damon and Philogenes and Euctemon's children. The lunar crater Euctemon is named after him. ==References== ==External links== *Imago Mundi: Euctemon *The Ancient Library *Greek Astronomy Category:5th- century BC Athenians Category:Ancient Greek astronomers Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
