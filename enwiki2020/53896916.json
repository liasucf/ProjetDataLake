    "text": "The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Sculpture Garden is a sculpture park located in the right, left and front lawns of the Philippine International Convention Center, CCP Complex, Pasay City, Philippines. The sculpture garden was opened and dedicated on 22 November 1996. It was jointly organized by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the curator of the garden, in commemoration of the APEC Philippines 1996. The garden is composed of 20 unique sculptures made by artists from their respective APEC countries. Each sculpture embodies the collective ideals of the 20 APEC member economies. The countries that donated their sculptures to the garden include Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, People's Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Singapore, Thailand, United States and Vietnam. As of 2017, only Peru has yet to donate a sculpture to the garden. The exact location of the layout of each sculpture was studied individually and presented in the best space where it would harmonize or be enhanced by the surrounding landscape. The angles of each sculpture were likewise studied in relation to the PICC\u2019s minimalist architectural design, with the objective of bringing out the most unusual point of each sculpture\u2019s design. ==Sculptures== File:APEC Sculpture Garden - AUS.jpg|Australia File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Brunei.jpg|Brunei Darussalam File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Canada.jpg|Canada File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Chile.jpg|Chile File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Chinese Taipei.jpg|Chinese Taipei File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Hong Kong.jpg|Hong Kong File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Indonesia.jpg|Indonesia File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Japan.jpg|Japan File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Malaysia.jpg|Malaysia File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Mexico.jpg|Mexico File:APEC Sculpture Garden - NZ.jpg|New Zealand File:APEC Sculpture Garden - PH.jpg|Philippines File:APEC Sculpture Garden - PNG.jpg|Papua New Guinea File:APEC Sculpture Garden - PRC.jpg|People's Republic of China File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Republic of Korea.jpg|Republic of Korea File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Russia.jpg|Russian Federation File:APEC Sculpture Garden - SG.jpg|Singapore File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Thailand.jpg|Thailand File:APEC Sculpture Garden - US.jpg|United States File:APEC Sculpture Garden - Vietnam.jpg|Vietnam ==References== Category:Sculpture gardens, trails and parks in Asia Category:Parks in Metro Manila Category:Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Category:1996 establishments in the Philippines ",
