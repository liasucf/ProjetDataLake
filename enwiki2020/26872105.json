The second largest ballroom in Austin also is located at the Hilton Austin. In 2018, a $7.5 million overhead walkway was constructed to connect the sixth floor of the hotel with the fourth floor of the Austin Convention Center. The tower began an exterior renovation in early 2018, which is still underway in February 2019. The tower's orange color was changed to white, with black paint added between windows. The Hilton logo was replaced with the Hilton wordmark. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Austin, Texas *List of tallest buildings in Texas *List of tallest buildings in the United States ==References== Category:Hotel buildings completed in 2003 Austin Category:Skyscraper hotels in Austin, Texas ",
