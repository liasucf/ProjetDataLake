    "text": "In statistics, the folded-t and half-t distributions are derived from Student's t-distribution by taking the absolute values of variates. This is analogous to the folded-normal and the half-normal statistical distributions being derived from the normal distribution. ==Definitions== The folded non- standardized t distribution is the distribution of the absolute value of the non-standardized t distribution with u degrees of freedom; its probability density function is given by: :g\\left(x\\right)\\;=\\;\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{ u+1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{ u}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{ u\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\left\\lbrace \\left[1+\\frac{1}{ u}\\frac{\\left(x-\\mu\\right)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right]^{-\\frac{ u+1}{2}}+\\left[1+\\frac{1}{ u}\\frac{\\left(x+\\mu\\right)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right]^{-\\frac{ u+1}{2}} \\right\\rbrace \\qquad(\\mbox{for}\\quad x \\geq 0). The half-t distribution results as the special case of \\mu=0, and the standardized version as the special case of \\sigma=1. If \\mu=0, the folded-t distribution reduces to the special case of the half-t distribution. Its probability density function then simplifies to :g\\left(x\\right)\\;=\\;\\frac{2\\;\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{ u+1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{ u}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{ u\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\left(1+\\frac{1}{ u}\\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)^{-\\frac{ u+1}{2}} \\qquad(\\mbox{for}\\quad x \\geq 0). The half-t distribution's first two moments (expectation and variance) are given by: :\\operatorname{E}[X]\\;=\\;2\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{ u}{\\pi}}\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{ u+1}{2})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{ u}{2})\\,( u-1)} \\qquad\\mbox{for}\\quad u > 1, and :\\operatorname{Var}(X)\\;=\\;\\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{ u}{ u-2}-\\frac{4 u}{\\pi( u-1)^2}\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{ u+1}{2})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{ u}{2})}\\right)^2\\right) \\qquad\\mbox{for}\\quad u > 2. == Relation to other distributions== Folded-t and half-t generalize the folded normal and half-normal distributions by allowing for finite degrees-of-freedom (the normal analogues constitute the limiting cases of infinite degrees-of-freedom). Since the Cauchy distribution constitutes the special case of a Student-t distribution with one degree of freedom, the families of folded and half-t distributions include the folded Cauchy and half-Cauchy distributions for u=1. ==See also== * Cauchy distribution * folded normal distribution * half-normal distribution * normal distribution * Student-t distribution == References == ==Further reading== * * * * ==External links== * Functions to evaluate half-t distributions are available in several R packages, e.g. .
