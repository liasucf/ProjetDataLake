It is located on County Road 73, northwest of Oxley, Arkansas. It is a single-story wood frame structure with modest Greek Revival styling. Its construction date was long thought to be 1920, but it was more likely built around 1900, still an extremely late date for the Greek Revival. It was converted into a post office and general store in the 1920s by Henry Kuykendall. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. == See also == *National Register of Historic Places listings in Searcy County, Arkansas *List of United States Post Offices == References == Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Greek Revival houses in Arkansas Category:Government buildings completed in 1900 Category:Buildings and structures in Searcy County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Searcy County, Arkansas Category:Post office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas ",
