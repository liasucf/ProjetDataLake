Rahul ignores a lot of friend requests from girls on social networking sites i.e. Facebook and Malvika; being the female version of him, ignores a lot of requests from guys. Vishal likes Malvika and Preity likes Rahul. Vishal sends a friend request to Malvika through his own in Rahul's account.

But, he is actually talking to Preity, who is pretending to be Malvika and thinking that she's talking to Rahul.
