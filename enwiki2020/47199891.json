    "text": "The East 21st Street Bridge is a or or long cable-stayed bridge in Tacoma, Washington completed in January 1997. The bridge, whose most significant feature is two tall towers, carries four lanes State Route 509 (SR 509) across the Thea Foss Waterway from downtown Tacoma to the Port of Tacoma. SR 509 ends at a single point urban interchange with Interstate 705 west of the bridge, built as part of the same $165.3 million WSDOT project that also funded the bridge's construction. The architect for the bridge was Jim Merritt, a Tacoma architect. It is sometimes called Foss Waterway Bridge, although the Murray Morgan Bridge also crosses Foss Waterway. ==References== ==External links== *Tacoma cable-stayed bridge, Bridgehunter * Category:Bridges in Tacoma, Washington Category:Cable-stayed bridges in the United States Category:Bridges completed in 1997 ",
