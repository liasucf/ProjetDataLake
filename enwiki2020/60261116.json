It was first proposed in a letter of L. \u0410. Sosnovskiy to K.V. Frolov on September 30, 1984.. This term was first published in 1986.Sosnovskiy, L. A.

Currently, the number of works exceeds 1,100 titles.Tribo-Fatigue: bibliographic index (1985-2015) / compiled by S. A.

(in Russian). == Objects == Tribo- Fatigue studies mechanical systems where the friction process is implemented in its manifestations during rolling, sliding, slipping, impact, erosion, and the like. At the same time, friction accommodates and transfers the volume- alternating load, which is in particular cyclic. These are high-duty products. Thus, in the traditionally studied friction pair of the wheel and rail, the rail head is simultaneously subjected to alternating bending. Therefore, the performance of this system is determined by the complex wear-fatigue damage (WFD), which is the mechanical rolling fatigue.Sosnovskiy, L. A. Mechano- rolling fatigue: the main laws (summary article) / L. A. Sosnovskiy, N. A. Makhutov, V. A. Shurinov // Industrial laboratory. Diagnostics of materials. \u2013 1992. \u2013 \u2116 11. \u2013 P. 44\u201361. (in Russian). Similarly in the pair of the crankshaft and connecting rod, the shaft journal is simultaneously subjected to bending and torsion; therefore, its performance is determined by the complex WFD, which is the mechanic sliding fatigueSosnovskiy, L. A. Mechano- sliding fatigue: the main laws (summary article) / L. A. Sosnovskiy, N. A. Makhutov, V. A. Shurinov // Industrial laboratory. Diagnostics of materials. \u2013 1992. \u2013 \u2116 9. \u2013 P. 46\u201363. (in Russian).. In a variety of shaft-and-hub joints, the shaft is additionally subjected to bending with rotation. The joints' performance is determined by the complex WFD, which is the fretting fatigueSosnovskiy, L. A. Fretting-fatigue: the main laws (summary article) / L. A. Sosnovskiy, N. A. Makhutov, V. A. Shurinov // Industrial laboratory. Diagnostics of materials. \u2013 1992. \u2013 \u2116 8. \u2013 P. 45\u201362. (in Russian).. Meanwhile, the pipe-and-fluid system, often using oil, simultaneously realizes both hydrodynamic friction and internal pressure that loads in an alternating pattern. Therefore, its performance is determined by the complex WFD, which is the mechanic corrosion fatigue, also called the corrosion-erosion fatigue.Sosnovsky, L. A. On a multidisciplinary approach to the analysis and prediction of operational damageability and resource life of linear sections of the pipeline from the standpoint of tribo-fatigue / L. A. Sosnovskiy, Yu. V. Lisin, A. N. Kozik // Mechanics of machines, mechanisms and materials. \u2013 2017. \u2013 \u2116 3 (40). \u2013 P. 75\u201384. (in Russian).Sosnovskiy, L. A.

Diagnostics of materials. \u2013 1993. \u2013 \u2116 7. \u2013 P. 33\u201344. (in Russian).. Similarly, radiation-mechanical fatigue is characteristic of the primary circuit pipes of the nuclear power plant.Troshchenko, V. \u0422. Fatigue resistance of metals and alloys: handbook : in 2 volumes / V. \u0422. Troshchenko, L. \u0410. Sosnovskiy. \u2013 Kiev : Naukova dumka, 1987. \u2013 V. 2. \u2013 P. 320\u2013325. (in Russian). A tribo-fatigue system is any friction pair where at least one of the elements is additionally and simultaneously loaded with the volume (non-contact) load. At least one tribo- fatigue system can be found in virtually every modern machine, such as a car; the system must be heavily loaded and largely determines the operational reliability of the product. When particular damaging phenomena such as fatigue, friction, and wear are implemented simultaneously and jointly as the complex WFD, which is studied by Tribo-Fatigue, the technical and economic significance to modern technology increases by several times. This relates to friction and wear problems, studied by tribology, and problems of fatigue damage and fracture, studied by the field concerning mechanical fatigue. == Wear-fatigue damage == Figure 2 shows the classification of the main types of wear-fatigue damage (in four languages). Table 1 describes the three main classes of tribo-fatigue systems: 1) solid / solid; 2) solid / liquid; 3) solid / particles. alt= {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Table 1 \u2013 Typical tribo-fatigue system and their complex damage !

There are three main effects established and studied in Tribo-Fatigue. The direct effect in Tribo-Fatigue is to study the influence of processes and conditions of friction and wear on the change in the characteristics of fatigue resistance of tribo-fatigue systems and their elements.Vysotsky, \u041c.

The back effect is the impact of alternating stresses on the change in the characteristics of friction and wear of the tribo-fatigue system and its elements.Sharay, V. \u0422. Comprehensive study of wear and fatigue in steels / V. T. Sharay. \u2013 Kiev : Ukrainian Publishing of technical literature, 1959. \u2013 32 p. (in Russian). Likewise, experiments prove that cyclic stresses under the volume load excited in the contact zone can, depending on the conditions, either reduce or increase the wear resistance of a friction pair by 10 to 60 percent or more. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Table 2 \u2013 Comparison of the methodologies of scientific disciplines | rowspan=\"2\" |Discipline | rowspan=\"2\" |Object of study | colspan=\"2\" |Basic methods of studies | rowspan=\"2\" |Tasks |- |experimental |theoretical |- |Tribo-Fatigue |Tribo- fatigue system |Wear-fatigue tests |Mechanics of wear-fatigue damage |Optimal management of complex wear-fatigue damage processes of tribo-fatigue systems in order to reduce labor, equipment and materials costs in their production and operation |- |Tribology |Friction pair |Tribotesting |Contact mechanics |Combating wear up to wear-free friction and preventing jamming of friction pairs |- |Fatigue |Structural element |Fatigue tests |Mechanics of deformation and fracture |Reducing the rate of accumulation of damage and preventing fatigue failure of structural elements |} alt= The effect of \u039b-interactions of damage (\u03c9\u03c3, \u03c9\u03c4) is caused by normal stresses (index \u03c3) due to non-contact volume loads, which produce fatigue, and frictional stresses (index \u03c4w), which produce friction and wear. They can be illustrated by the following rule: According to this rule, damage from contact and volume loads is non-additive: they are not summed but interact dialectically. The dialectical nature of the interaction of damage is determined by the principle of L. A. Sosnovskiy: in which \u03c9\u03c3, \u03c9\u03c4, \u03c9T is irreversible damage under normal (index (\u03c3), shear (under friction) (index \u03c4) and thermal (index T) stresses. \u039b-functions should take three classes of values (\u039b > 1, \u039b < 1, \u039b = 1) to describe unity, diversity, and physical hardening-softening processes in a system (Figure 3). There are formulas for calculating the limiting stresses with direct (\u03c3\u22121\u03c4) and back (\u03c4f\u03c3) effects, taking into account \u039b-interactions of damage:Bogdanovich, A. V. Prediction of limiting states of tribo-fatigue systems / A. V. Bogdanovich. \u2013 Grodno : Grodno State University, 2008. \u2013 372 p. (in Russian). \u039b-functions defined at the macro-level are similar to non-additivity parameters in q-estimation.A. B. Abiba, A. A. Moreirab, J. S. Andrade Jr., M. P. Almeida, Phys. A, 322 (2003), 276\u2013284. They were used as the basis for development of the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nano-level.Olemskiy A. I., Yushchenko O. V., Badalyan A. Yu. Statisticheskaya teoriya polya neadditivnoy sistemy // TMF. \u2013 2013. \u2013 V. 174. \u2013 \u2116 3. \u2013 pp. 444\u2013466. (in Russian). They are fundamental in modern concepts of non-additive systems. The tribo-fatigue systems can be viewed as a real class of non-additive systems at the macro-level. By taking into account the above three effects, it is possible to formulate and address the tasks of optimal management in view of economic responsibility of the WFD processes of tribo-fatigue systems as well as to calculate strength and wear resistance of high-duty mechanical systems (see Table 2 and ). == Interdisciplinary results == Tribo-Fatigue has contributed to discoveries impacting other fields, including fundamental ones. * The generalized law of friction has been theoretically formulatedSherbakov, S.

Sherbakov // International Journal of Fatigue. \u2013 2014. \u2013 V. 66. \u2013 P. 207\u2013219.: in the general case, the friction force is proportional both to contact load (FN) and volume load (Pb) if the latter excites cyclic stresses (\u00b1\u03c3) in the area of contact: The coefficient of friction in the tribo-fatigue system is: where p0 is the maximum value of pressure p distribution in the contact area, k\u03c3/p is the function that depends on the correlation of stresses acting in the area of contact and caused by non- contact and contact loads, and f is the coefficient of friction according to the classic Amonton-Coulomb law. If friction is implemented in a tension zone with volume loading, f\u03c3/p < fs, while in the compression zone, becomes f\u03c3/p > fs. The difference between the values of f\u03c3/p and fs reaches 10% to 50% or more, depending on the loading conditions.Sosnovskiy, L. A.

Practical use of the classic law for analysis of friction in tribo-fatigue systems is unjustified since it results in a significant calculation error. * The mechanical-mathematical model of the combined stress-strain state of the tribo-fatigue system in three-dimensional setting (i, j) is as such:Vityaz, P. \u0410.

Superscripts M, N and Q correspond to the internal moment, and longitudinal and transverse forces during volumetric deformation such as by bending, tension, compression, and torsion. This model is the basis of formulating and solving a new class of contact problems, supplemented by the action of various non-contact forces.Sosnovskiy, L. A.

There are solutions for several particular cases. Thus the equation concerning criteria for a special case of mechanic sliding fatigue takes the following form: a\u03c3\u03c32+a\u03c4\u03c4w2)\u039b\u03c3\\\u03c4=1, where a<<1 are coefficients, which single out from the total energy, which is the energy delivered to the system. The amount of total energy is used to form the irreparable damage. Methods for calculating such coefficients have been developed. Numerous verifications of the equation showed its adequacy to experiments. * Experimental and theoretical studies formulated nine tribo- fatigue surprises.Sosnovskiy, L. A.

Surprises of Tribo-Fatigue / L. A. Sosnovskiy, S. S. Sherbakov. \u2013 Minsk : Magic Book, 2009. \u2013 200 p. According to a 2005 work, \"the scientists could not see, understand, imagine or analytically describe\" occurrences relating to \"the emergence of tribo-fatigue\". For example, surprise S3, a tribo-fatigue bomb, is the abnormally low resistance to fracture at fretting fatigue due to the strong interaction of a complex of weak damages. It turned out that such a surprise is found in a rotor of a unique turbine with a unit capacity of 1200 megawatts (MW) in a fusion reactor with a strong magnetic field, which was in a rocket engine with hydrogen fuel, in turn in an installation for drilling ultra-deep wells. Surprise S5, also known as the Troppy effect, is the formation of irregular residual surface undulating damage as a result of non- stationary process of elastoplastic deformation in an area of contact interaction during rolling friction. This phenomenon occurs in a wheel-and- rail system as wavy damage that occurs on the tread surface under severe operating conditions. * Entropy in thermodynamics is a characteristic of energy dissipation. Tribo-Fatigue proposes a similar characteristic of its absorption:Sosnovskiy, L. A. On one type of entropy as a measure of the absorption of energy spent on the production of damage in a mechanothermodynamic system / L. A. Sosnovskiy // Reports of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. \u2013 2007. \u2013 V. 51. \u2013 \u2116 6. \u2013 P. 100\u2013104. (in Russian). Tribo-fatigue entropy, which is surprise S7, generates irreversible damage \u03c9\u03a3 in dangerous volumes VP\u03b3 on moving and deformable solids interacting with either each other or the medium. Here T\u03a3 \u2265 T is the temperature caused by all sources, being the medium temperature. \u03b31(w) is the pressure or stress that results in the damage of a dangerous volume of a unit value U\u03a3,eff is the effective absorbed energy caused by loads of a different nature. Tribo-fatigue entropy was used to formulate and analytically record the general law of entropy increase for the first time in history.Sosnovskiy, L. A.

(in Russian). developed for the design of tribo-fatigue systems for strength, durability, reliability, and durability taking into account the risk of an operation can solve many tasks.Sosnovskiy, L. A. L-Risk (Mechanothermodynamics of irreversible damages) / L. A. Sosnovskiy. \u2013 Gomel : BelSUT, 2004. \u2013 317 p. (in Russian). Tribo-Fatigue moves away from the traditional design of individual parts and turns to the estimation and design of mechanical systems. With regard to the mechanic sliding fatigue of the bending shaft and sliding-surface bearing system, the following tasks can be set and practically solved: * determining the required diameter of the shaft taking into account the direct effect, * determining the required area of contact of the system elements taking into account the back effect, * selecting materials for both elements of the system, * setting the requirements of the value of the friction coefficient, * calculating the durability of the system and its elements, * assessing the reliability of the system under given operating conditions, * and calculating the risk factors and indicators of safe system operation. Figure 4 shows a comparative analysis of the methods of calculation of tribo-fatigue systems based on the criteria of Tribo-Fatigue (the parameters with the index TF), the criteria of mechanical fatigue (the parameters with the index F) and also the tribological parameter or the coefficient of friction. In all the graphs the horizontal dotted line means that in calculations based on individual criteria of either mechanical fatigue or tribology, the required parameters are assumed as singles. The curvilinear dotted lines describe the direct or the back effects providing the function of interaction of damages is \u039b\u03c3/\u03c4=1. The remaining (solid) lines characterize the above effects with the account of various conditions of interaction of damages: the softening processes prevail at \u039b\u03c3/\u03c4>1, the hardening processes prevail at \u039b\u03c3/\u03c4<1\\. alt= For example, let us comment on determination of the required cross section of the shaft. Its diameter dF taken according to the known method of calculation for mechanical fatigue is assumed equal to a unity dF=1. If the shaft is an element of the tribo-fatigue system, then the allowance for the effect of the processes of friction and wear, that are generally characterized by the relative value of friction stresses \u03c4W2/\u03c4f2, leads to the fact that in order to provide its strength reliability the value of dTF can be either significantly less (for example, 0.9dF) or significantly more (for example, 1.3dF) than the value of dF; it depends on the ratio between the occurring processes of hardening- softening (\u039b\u03c3/\u03c4>1 or \u039b\u03c3/\u03c4<1). The analysis of other graphs in Figure 4 leads to similar conclusions in deciding on the selection of the required area of contact, properties of a material, friction coefficient, etc. == Testing machines == alt= alt= A new class of testing equipment, called SI-series machines, for wear-fatigue testing of materials, models of friction pairs, and tribo-fatigue systems is based on inventions within the Tribo-Fatigue framework (Figure 5).Sosnovskiy, L. \u0410.

This initiates the formation of crack-like defects, the development of which during operation leads to a pipeline accident. From figure 11 it can be seen that during the period of operation before the development of the depreciation period (1964\u20261996), accidents were almost annually. In connection with the approaching depreciation period, JSC \"Gomeltransneft Druzhba\" and S&P; Group TRIBOFATIGUE Ltd developed a set of measures to restore the operability of such sections of the pipeline. The main ones were: stabilizing the pressure during operation and increasing the strength of the pipe material by loading with increased internal pressure (25% higher than the working one). The operation of the pipeline after the depreciation period (after 1996 in Figure 11) showed that there were no accidents for 12 years. The three accidents shown during this period relate to damage to the pipeline during repair and construction works. The working pressure was increased: before depreciation \u2013 42 MPa, after depreciation \u2013 45 MPa. Further operation of the pipeline (after 2010) showed that failures of underwater sections of the pipeline may not be according to the criterion of crack resistance (Figure 12, upper image), but according to the criterion of wear (Figure 12, lower images).Kozik, A.N.

After operational tests, the rails were dismantled for study. It was established: there was no vertical and lateral wear of the rail heads, there were no additional difficulties during operation in winter and summer, the general appearance and condition of the rails was normal, the rails can be re- stacked and operated in the existing section of the track.

(in Russian). the wear resistance of cast iron rails is approximately 1.5 times higher than steel, under the same operating conditions. This is due to the special properties of cast iron (self- lubrication, ability to dampen vibrations, etc.). For accelerated laboratory tests, original physical models of the wheel / rail system were developed, which are tested on SI-series machines (see Figure 5) under conditions close to operational. For example, test specimens are cut from the rail head in such a way that they contain a surface area damaged during operation. A laboratory test procedure has been developed, during which rail corrugation is reproduced (Figure 18).Hampton, R. D. \u201cRail corrugation \u2013 experience of US transit properties\u201d // R. D.

Laboratory models are shown in Figure 19. Accelerated laboratory tests of such models are carried out on SI-series machines (see Figure 5). An example of tests is shown in Figure 20.
