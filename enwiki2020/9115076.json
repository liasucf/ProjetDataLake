    "text": "90 Pound Suburban Housewife (Driving in Her SUV) was the song that became the anthem of fossil fuel conscious environmentalists in 2006. Written by Rozanne Gates and Suzanne Sheridan of Westport, Connecticut, 90 Pound Suburban Housewife offered social comment on the trend of American housewives driving large SUVs in the midst of environmental concerns and rising oil prices. Interest in the song was spurred when it was played on the National Public Radio show Car Talk in January 2006. The song garnered attention from local press and national media such as The Today Show, CNN, Associated Press coverage and radio play on stations throughout the United States. Gates, an actor's agent for 25 years, was the advocate of acting notables such as Edward Norton, Bronson Pinchot, Christopher Noth, and Joe Mantegna. Gates' community involvement includes executive positions at the Lynne Thigpen - Bobo Lewis Foundation, dedicated to helping young actors in the memory of actors Lynne Thigpen and Bobo Lewis and First Night Westport-Weston. Sheridan's career has spanned diverse areas of the arts: a musician, vocalist and photographer. In 1975 she won a Clio Award for her vocals on a Pepsi jingle. Sheridan also wrote music for the PBS show The Electric Company. Sheridan works as a photographer from her Westport, Connecticut studio, Suzanne Sheridan Photography. == External links == * USA Today: March 19, 2006 * Channel 7 Eyewitness News: March 28, 2006 * New York Times Online: March 26, 2006 * WTNH News Channel 8 Online * 90 Pound Suburban Housewife: Official Website * Suzanne Sheridan * Westport Now: March 12, 2006 * UUWorld.com/Unitarian Universalist Website Category:Comedy songs Category:2006 songs ",
