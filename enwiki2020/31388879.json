President Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, who is not a member of any political party, has ruled over a multiparty coalition of ADEMA-PASJ, which had recently come under internal stress due to rumors that the former PM was preparing for a 2012 Presidential bid.

The editor of the powerful Bamako daily, Le R\u00e9publicain, speculated that Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9's choice of woman Prime Minister was in part a symbol, reaching out to female voters in the year leading to the June 2012 Malian elections, and allowing the previous PM opportunity to run for the Presidency. He praised the President for his appointment in a \"still very conservative country remains divided on the issue of gender and the vicissitudes of the family code\", a reference to the Family Law bill proposed in 2009, that would have promoted women's rights, and was withdrawn after large conservative protests.Edito : Le symbole ou l\u2019efficacit\u00e9?
