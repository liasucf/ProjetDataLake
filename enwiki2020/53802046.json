    "text": "Bolshaya Pokrovskaya Street (. Short-name - Pokrovka) is the high street in the historical centre of Nizhny Novgorod and one of its oldest streets. Until 1917 it was considered a street for noblemen. Formed as the main street of the city by the end of the 18th century. It is considered an analogue of the Arbat in Moscow or 6-7 Lines of Vasilyevsky Island in St. Petersburg. == History == === Russian Empire === The street began to form in the Middle Ages. Then its direction was set on the road to Moscow. After the visit of Empress Catherine II, a new regular city plan was developed, providing for a quarterly system. In 1823 - 1824 the bell tower at the church of the Protection of the Holy Virgin () was built. Since then, the street has become known as the Bolshaya Pokrovskaya. Most often the street was called \"Pokrovka\". At the end of the 16th to the beginning of the 19th centuries stone buildings were added to the street. Since then it has become the main street of the city and has become known as the \"noble family\", because of the location on it of the estate of the generals, princely families, the governor, the vice-governor and other high officials. In 1896 Nicholas Theater was built, the opening of which was timed to coincide with the beginning of the All-Russia Exhibition. On 18 July 1896, it was visited by Emperor Nicholas II. By the beginning of the 20th century buildings and streets heavily compacted and houses began to form a continuous line on both sides of the street. In 1913, the main state bank was built on the street. Its opening was timed to the Romanov Tercentenary. === Soviet period === After the revolution, the street was renamed and began to bear the name of the revolutionary Yakov Sverdlov and was popularly called \"Sverdlovka\". Approximately in 1935, the Church of the Intercession was demolished. Until the 1980s, the street was a road and in the early 80's it was made pedestrian. === Current Russia === After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the street was renamed back to Bolshaya Pokrovskaya. In 2004 the 21st century the street was completely reconstructed. It was paved with paving stones, and bronze sculptures were installed along both sides. The most popular are the sculpture \"The Funny goat\", in front of the Dramatic Theater, and the sculpture of the policeman, on the Minin and Pozharsky Square.

They play in different musical styles and repertoires. Some days musicians give especially large-scale street concerts with the use of professional equipment, gathering around a large number of people.
