But 3 years later he returned to the Phillies as a member of its broadcasting team and he would remain with the team until his untimely death in 1997. *February 4 \u2013 For the second straight election, the BBWAA voters fail to elect a new member to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Edd Roush gets 146 votes, but 202 are necessary for election. Sam Rice (143) and Eppa Rixey (142) are next in line. *February 15 \u2013 In Caribbean Series action, the Elefantes de Cienfuegos completes a 6-0 sweep to give the Cuban team the Series championship for the fifth straight year. Camilo Pascual, who went 2-0 with 15 strikeouts including a one-hit shutout in the clincher, is named Most Valuable Player. *February 18 \u2013 Walter O'Malley, owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, completes the purchase of the Chavez Ravine area in Los Angeles by paying $494,000 for property valued at $92,000. *February 20 \u2013 Branch Rickey meets with officials of the proposed Western Carolinas League about pooling talent for Continental League clubs. *February 23 \u2013 Demolition of Ebbets Field begins. Lucy Monroe sings the National Anthem, and Roy Campanella is given an urn of dirt from behind home plate. ===March\u2013April=== *March 12 - The Cincinnati Red Sing Tony Perez as an undrafted amateur free agent. Perez would go on to be a seven time all-star and key member of the Big Red Machine of the 1970s and was later elected to the hall of fame. *March 13 \u2013 The Chicago White Sox unveil new road uniforms with the players' names above the number on the back, another innovation by Sox owner Bill Veeck. *March 24 \u2013 Commissioner Ford Frick says he will not allow the Continental League to pool players in the Western Carolinas League as it would violate existing major-minor league agreements. *March 26 \u2013 A Baltimore Orioles-Cincinnati Reds series scheduled for Havana, Cuba, is moved to Miami, Florida by Baltimore chief Lee MacPhail. The Reds, with a farm club in Cuba, want the trip, but the Orioles fear increased political unrest in the area. *March 31 \u2013 By a vote of 8\u20131, the Professional Baseball Rules Committee turns down a PCL proposal to use a designated hitter for the pitcher. *April 1 - The Los Angeles Dodgers sent minor league prospect Clyde Parris to Toronto of the International League in exchange for Joe Altobelli. *April 4 \u2013 The Chicago White Sox send catcher Earl Battey and first baseman Don Mincher plus cash to the Washington Senators for first baseman Roy Sievers. *April 5 \u2013 The San Francisco Giants purchase first baseman Dale Long from the Chicago Cubs. *April 12: **With 42,269 fans in attendance, the San Francisco Giants edge the St. Louis Cardinals, 3\u20131, in the first game at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. Sam Jones pitches a three- hitter, and Cardinals outfielder Leon Wagner hits the first home run in the $15 million stadium. **Chuck Essegian bats an 11th-inning pinch-hit home run as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs, 3\u20132, before a record Opening Day crowd (67,550) at Los Angeles. The home run is Essegian's third straight as a pinch hitter, including two in the 1959 World Series. Don Drysdale pitches all the way, striking out 14, for the win over Don Elston. **In a deal that will haunt the Cleveland Indians, GM Frank Lane sends Norm Cash to the Detroit Tigers for third baseman Steve Demeter. Cash will be Detroit's regular first baseman for the next 14 years and will hit 373 home runs for them. Demeter will play four games for Cleveland. *April 17: **On Easter Sunday, GM Frank Lane brings AL batting champ Harvey Kuenn to the Cleveland Indians and sends co-home run champ Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers. Colavito, an unparalleled fan favorite in Cleveland, will hit 173 home runs before returning to Cleveland in 1965. Kuenn will report to Cleveland, pull a muscle, and never be the same hitter. He'll be traded after one season. **Eddie Mathews of the Milwaukee Braves hits his 300th home run, off Robin Roberts, plus a double and a triple, as Milwaukee beats the Philadelphia Phillies, 8\u20134. To date, only Jimmie Foxx hit his 300th at a younger age. *April 18: **In the American League opener at Washington, D.C., a week later than the National League start, President Dwight D. Eisenhower throws out the first ball, then watches the Senators' Camilo Pascual strike out 15 Boston Red Sox batters to tie Walter Johnson's team record. Boston's only run in a 10\u20131 loss is a Ted Williams home run, which makes Williams the first player to hit a home run in four different decades. **Trader Frank Lane continues to swap, sending Cleveland favorite Herb Score to the Chicago White Sox for Barry Latman. Score and Rocky Colavito, traded three days before, were the last two players to pre-date Lane's arrival in Cleveland. *April 19: **Before a home crowd of 41,661, Minnie Mi\u00f1oso celebrates his return to the Chicago White Sox with a fourth-inning grand slam against the Kansas City Athletics. Leading off the bottom of the 9th with the score tied 9\u20139, Mi\u00f1oso hits a solo homer for his sixth RBI. **On Patriot's Day at Fenway Park, Roger Maris makes his debut with the New York Yankees as he goes 4-for-5, including two home runs with four RBI. The Yankees spoil the Boston Red Sox opener with an 8\u20134 win. **The Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians play the longest season opener in major- league history, a 15-inning affair won by the Tigers 4-2 at Cleveland Stadium. *April 29 \u2013 At home, the St. Louis Cardinals crush the Chicago Cubs, 16\u20136. Stan Musial plays his 1,000th game at first base, becoming the first major league player ever with that many at two positions (1,513 games in the outfield). A bright spot for the Cubs is Ernie Banks hitting two home runs to break Gabby Hartnett's club record of 231 homers. ===May=== *May 1 \u2013 Skinny Brown of the Baltimore Orioles pitches a 4\u20131 win over the Yankees. Brown allows just one hit, a first-inning home run by Mickey Mantle. Rookie Ron Hansen matches Mantle to up his RBI total to an American League high 32. *May 4: **The Chicago Cubs make a trade with WGN (AM) plucking Lou Boudreau out of the broadcast booth to replace Charlie Grimm (6-11) as Cubs manager. \"Jolly Cholly\" replaces Boudreau behind the mike. The Cubs win, 5\u20131, over the Pirates as pitcher Dick Ellsworth gains his first ML victory. **Baltimore Orioles catcher Gus Triandos sets a pair of American League records with three passed balls in one inning (6th) and four in one game, but knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm, making a rare start, goes seven innings and gets credit for a 6\u20134 Baltimore win over the Chicago White Sox. Early Wynn records his 2,000th strikeout in a no-decision effort for Chicago. Triandos' PB mark for an inning will be tied by reserve backstop Myron Ginsberg in six days, and Tom Egan will collect five PBs in 1970 to erase Triandos' name from the top of the list. *May 6 \u2013 The Dodgers send veteran outfielder Sandy Amor\u00f3s to Detroit for first baseman Gail Harris. *May 7: **Pitcher Larry Sherry and catcher Norm Sherry of the Dodgers become the 10th sibling battery in ML history. Norman belts an 11th-inning home run to give his reliever brother Larry a 3\u20132 win against the Phillies. **Boston Red Sox pitcher Bill Monbouquette allows just one hit in beating the visiting Detroit Tigers, 5\u20130. Neil Chrisley's double is the only Tigers hit. **Takehiko Bessho becomes the winningest pitcher in Nippon Professional Baseball as his Tokyo Giants beat the Hanshin Tigers 6\u20133. Bessho has 302 wins in the league, one more than Victor Starfin. *May 10: **Catcher Joe Ginsberg of the Orioles loses a struggle with Hoyt Wilhelm's knuckleball facing the Athletics, and ties the record set six days earlier by teammate Gus Triandos with three passed balls in one inning. **Grand slams by Boston Red Sox teammates Vic Wertz and Rip Repulski at Fenway Park give Boston a 9\u20137 win over the Chicago White Sox. A former National League veteran, Repulski's eighth-inning shot off Don Ferrarese comes on his first American League at bat. *May 11: **Sam Jones pitches a two-hitter and draws a bases-loaded walk for the only run, as the Giants edge the visiting Phillies, 1\u20130. Jim Owens is the loser. **The Phillies announce a trade of first baseman Ed Bouchee and pitcher Don Cardwell to the Chicago Cubs for second baseman Tony Taylor and catcher Cal Neeman. *May 12 \u2013 Duplicating Sam Jones' effort of yesterday, the Giants' Jack Sanford pitches a two-hit, 1\u20130 win over the Phillies. Sanford matches Jones by striking out 11 and walking three. *May 13: **Mike McCormick's shutout of the Los Angeles Dodgers is the third straight by San Francisco Giants pitchers, following two-hitters against the Philadelphia Phillies by Sam Jones and Jack Sanford. The first-place Giants have seven straight wins. **Dick Groat of the Pittsburgh Pirates becomes the first National League player since Connie Ryan in 1953 to hit 6-for-6 as Pittsburgh beats the Milwaukee Braves, 8\u20132. **The Philadelphia Phillies suffer their third straight 1\u20130 shutout, losing to the hosting Cincinnati Reds. The Phillies, losers of back-to-back 1\u20130 games in San Francisco, tie the major- league record for straight 1\u20130 losses. Jim O'Toole's win is Cincinnati's ninth straight. **Two days after being traded from the Phillies to the Cubs, Don Cardwell pitches a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. A brilliant, leaping catch of Carl Sawatski's line drive by George Altman in the eighth inning saves Cardwell's gem. Ernie Banks' home run paces the 4\u20130 win, the first no-hitter against the Cards since May 11, 1919. *May 17 - Carl Furillo is released by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Forillo had been with the Dodgers since the team was in Brooklyn and the two time all-star was one of the last players who played with Jackie Robinson during Robinson's rookie season still on the roster. *May 19 \u2013 The New York Yankees send shortstop Andy Carey to the Kansas City Athletics for slugger Bob Cerv. Cerv had been with the Yankees for five years before going to KC where he hit 38 home runs in 1958 and was chosen as the American League left fielder in the All-Star game over Ted Williams. Cerv will be claimed in the 1960 expansion draft and the Yankees will again reacquire him. *May 25 \u2013 George Crowe of the St. Louis Cardinals set a major league record with his 11th pinch-hit home run, off Don McMahon, as the Cardinals win, 5\u20133, over the Braves. Crowe began the season tied with Smoky Burgess and Gus Zernial in most career pinch home runs. *May 27: **Since there is no rule limiting the size or shape of the catcher's mitt, Baltimore manager Paul Richards combats the team passed-ball problem while catching Hoyt Wilhelm (38 in 1959; 11 so far this year) by devising an oversized mitt to gather in Wilhelm's fluttering knuckleball. It is half again as large as the standard glove and 40 ounces heavier. Wilhelm goes the distance in beating New York, 3\u20132, at Yankee Stadium. Catcher Clint Courtney has no passed balls behind the plate. **Camilo Pascual strikes out 13 but the Washington Senators lose to the Boston Red Sox, 4\u20133, his third loss to Boston this year. *May 28 \u2013 Manager Casey Stengel is hospitalized with a virus and high fever and will miss 13 games. The Yankees go 7-6 under interim manager Ralph Houk. ===June=== *June 12 \u2013 In a record-tying three-hour-and-52-minute, 9-inning game, Willie McCovey's pinch-hit grand slam, the first slam of his career, and Orlando Cepeda's three-run double pace the Giants to a 16\u20137 rout of the Braves. *June 15 \u2013 Mexico City and Poza Rica combine to hit 12 home runs in one game, a Mexican League record. *June 19 \u2013 In a brilliant pair of pitching performances, Orioles pitchers Hoyt Wilhelm and Milt Pappas threw shutouts to beat the host Detroit Tigers. Wilhelm allowed two hits in winning the opener, 2\u20130, over Jim Bunning, and Pappas allows three hits in winning the nightcap, 1\u20130, over Don Mossi. Jim Gentile and Ron Hansen collected home runs as catcher Clint Courtney, using the big glove designed by manager Paul Richards, is twice charged with batter interference, the first loading the bases in the 4th inning. *June 24 \u2013 Willie Mays belted two home runs and made 10 putouts to lead the Giants in a 5\u20133 win at Cincinnati. Mays added three RBI, three runs scored, a single and stole home. *June 26 \u2013 Hoping to speed up the election process, the Hall of Fame changes its voting procedures. The new rules allow the Special Veterans Committee to vote annually, rather than every other year, and to induct up to two players a year. The BBWAA is authorized to hold a runoff election of the top 30 vote getters if no one is elected in the first ballot. *June 29 \u2013 The Cleveland Indians buy pitcher Don Newcombe from the Reds. *June 30 \u2013 Dick Stuart blasts three consecutive home runs, as the Pirates split with the Giants. Stuart drives in seven runs and joins Ralph Kiner as the second Pirates player to hit three home runs in a game at Forbes Field. ===July=== *July 1 - Bobby Thomson, who hit the infamous 'shot heard around the world' while playing for the New York Giants, is released by the Boston Red Sox. He is signed three days later by the Baltimore Orioles where he finishes his career. *July 4 \u2013 Mickey Mantle's three-run first-inning home run off Hal Woodeshick is the 300th of his career. Mantle becomes the 18th major leaguer to join the 300-HR club, but the Yankees drop a 9\u20138 decision to the Senators. *July 8 \u2013 The Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro brought an end to Havana's International League team. The Sugar Kings relocate in Jersey City, marking that city's return to the International League after a 10-year absence. Poor attendance at Roosevelt Stadium prompts the parent Cincinnati Reds to cease the minor league operation there following the 1961 season. ** The Cincinnati Reds sign Pete Rose as an undrafted amateur free agent. Rose would go on to be baseball's time hits leader. *July 9 \u2013 Jim Coates suffers his first loss after nine straight wins, and 14 straight over two seasons, as the Boston Red Sox beat the Yankees, 6\u20135. The Sox are led by Vic Wertz, who hit a home run, double and single to drive in four runs. Coates' major-league career-record is 17\u20132. ** The Los Angeles Dodgers release minor league pitcher Tommy Lasorda. *July 11 \u2013 At KC Municipal Stadium, one-hit three-innings shutout pitching by Bob Friend and home runs by Ernie Banks and Del Crandall paced the National League to a 5\u20134 win over the American League in the first of two All-Star Games. Friend, of the Pittsburgh Pirates, has notched two of the NL's last three All-Star wins. *July 13 \u2013 At Yankee Stadium, Vern Law became the second Pirates pitcher to win a 1960 All-Star Game, working two scoreless innings. Stan Musial came off the National League bench and hit his record sixth and last All-Star Game home run. Willie Mays, Ken Boyer and Eddie Mathews also homered in the 6\u20130 NL win, the third shutout in All-Star Game history. Law (1st, 2nd) combined the eight-hit shutout along with Johnny Podres (3rd), Stan Williams (5th, 6th), Larry Jackson (7th), Bill Henry (8th) and Lindy McDaniel (9th). Whitey Ford was the loser. *July 18 \u2013 The National League votes to expand to 10 clubs if the Continental League does not join organized baseball. The new NL clubs would invade CL territories. *July 19: **In a spectacular ML debut, Juan Marichal of the San Francisco Giants pitches no-hit ball until Clay Dalrymple pinch-hit singles with two out in the 7th inning. Marichal winds up with 12 strikeouts and a one-hit 2\u20130 win against the Phillies, becoming the first National League pitcher since 1900 to debut with a one-hitter. **Roy Sievers' 21-game hitting streak, the longest for any player in the season, ends, but Chicago White Sox teammate Luis Aparicio's inside-the-park home run and Billy Pierce's shutout beat Boston, 6\u20130. **Senators ace Pedro Ramos pitches a one-hitter 5\u20130 shutout over Detroit. Rocky Colavito's leadoff single in the eighth inning, a grounder that eludes shortstop Jos\u00e9 Valdivielso, is the lone safety. *July 20 \u2013 At Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Mickey Mantle golfs a Gary Bell pitch over the auxiliary scoreboard into the distant upper deck in right field, matching Luke Easter as the only major league players to reach that spot. Cleveland holds on for an 8\u20136 win over the Yankees. *July 21 \u2013 Robin Roberts pitches his third career one-hitter, and the 3rd one-hitter of the season in new Candlestick Park. Felipe Alou spoils Roberts' no-hit bid in the fifth inning of a 3\u20130 Phillies victory; third baseman Joe Morgan fields the batted ball, but falls down and cannot make a throw. *July 22 \u2013 At Fenway Park, the Boston Red Sox down the Cleveland Indians, 6\u20134. Vic Wertz has a three-run home run and four RBI. Ted Williams also homers, and in the 7th inning, steals second base. Williams sets a major league record as the only player to steal bases in four consecutive decades. He'll be matched by Rickey Henderson in 2000. The Indians' Jimmy Piersall homers twice, both off winner Ike Delock. *July 23 \u2013 Kansas City outfielder Whitey Herzog hits into the only All-Cuban Triple Play in ML history. The action goes from Washington Senators starting pitcher Pedro Ramos, to first baseman Julio B\u00e9cquer, to shortstop Jos\u00e9 Valdivielso. The victory, however, goes to reliever Chuck Stobbs (7-2) as the Senators take an 8\u20133 decision. Harmon Killebrew has a two-run home run. *July 27 \u2013 William Shea, chairman of Mayor Robert Wagner's New York baseball committee, announces the formation of the Continental League. The five founding cities are New York City, Houston, Toronto, Denver and Minneapolis/St. Paul. *July 30 \u2013 Just as he predicts, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Art Mahaffey picks off the first batter to get a hit against him. Then with the next batter to get a hit, he does it again. Curt Flood and Bill White of the St. Louis Cardinals are the base runner victims, but St. Louis still wins, 6\u20133. In his next game, the first batter to get a hit off Mahaffey will be Jim Marshall, and Mahaffey will pick him off as well. ===August=== *August 2 \u2013 In an agreement with the major leagues, the Continental League abandons plans to join the American League and National League. Walter O'Malley, chairman of the NL Expansion Committee, says, \"We immediately will recommend expansion and that we would like to do it in 1961.\" Milwaukee Braves owner Lou Perini proposes a compromise that four of the CL territories be admitted to the current majors in orderly expansion. Branch Rickey's group quickly accepts. The Continental League ends without playing a game. *August 3 \u2013 In an unusual move, Cleveland Indians GM Frank Lane trades managers with Detroit Tigers GM Bill DeWitt. The Indians' Joe Gordon (49-46) is dealt to the Tigers for Jimmy Dykes (44-52). For one game, until the pair can change places, Jo-Jo White pilots the Indians and Billy Hitchcock guides the Tigers. *August 7 \u2013 The Chicago White Sox win a pair from the Washington Senators, with reliever Gerry Staley picking up two victories. Staley will be 13\u20138, all in relief, with both wins and losses topping the American League relievers. *August 8 \u2013 A day crowd of 48,323, the largest day crowd ever at Comiskey Park, cheers White Sox pitcher Billy Pierce's four-hit victory over the Yankees, 9\u20131. Pierce faces just 31 batters. *August 9 \u2013 With fine relief pitching of Lindy McDaniel in the opener and a five-hitter by Curt Simmons in the nightcap, the St. Louis Cardinals sweep the Philadelphia Phillies, 5\u20134 and 6\u20130. Phillies Tony Taylor ties a major league record for a second baseman by going the entire doubleheader (18 innings) without a putout \u2013 the first to achieve the feat since Connie Ryan, of the Phillies, on June 14, 1953. *August 10 \u2013 Ted Williams blasts a pair of home runs and a double to pace the Red Sox to a 6\u20131 win over the Cleveland Indians. Williams has 21 homers for the season. The first of the two today, #512, moves him past Mel Ott into fourth place on the all-time list. After the game, Williams announces that he will retire at the end of the season. *August 18 \u2013 At County Stadium, Lew Burdette of the Milwaukee Braves no-hits the Philadelphia Phillies 1-0. He faces the minimum 27 batters, a fifth-inning hit-by-pitch to Tony Gonz\u00e1lez being the only Phillies base runner; Gonz\u00e1lez is retired on Lee Walls' double play ground ball one batter later. Burdette also helps his own cause by scoring the only run of the game; after doubling to lead off the eighth, he scores on Bill Bruton's double one batter later. *August 20 \u2013 Ted Williams draws the 2,000th walk of his career in the Red Sox' split of a twi-night doubleheader with the Orioles. Williams joins Babe Ruth as the only major leaguers to collect 2,000 walks. Rickey Henderson in 2000, and Barry Bonds in 2003, will join the select 2,000 walks group. *August 23 \u2013 Following up his no-hitter, Lew Burdette fires his third shutout in a row, pitching the Milwaukee Braves to a 7\u20130 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. *August 27 \u2013 After pitching 32 shutout innings, Braves pitcher Lew Burdette gives up a Felipe Alou home run as San Francisco defeats the Braves 3\u20131. *August 30 \u2013 Boston Red Sox second baseman Pete Runnels goes 6-for-7, as Boston edges the Tigers in the 15-inning opener of a twin bill. Runnels\u2019 15th-inning double brings Frank Malzone home with the winning run to win, 5\u20134. Runnels has three more hits in the nightcap victory, 3\u20132 in 10 innings. His six hits are the most in an American League game since July 8, 1955. With 9-for-11 in the doubleheader, Runnels ties the major league record. ===September=== *September 2 \u2013 Boston's Ted Williams hits a home run off Don Lee of the Senators. Williams had homered against Lee's father, Thornton, 20 years earlier. *September 3: **A battle of left-handed pitchers features Sandy Koufax of the LA Dodgers against Mike McCormick of the SF Giants. Felipe Alou's home run gives McCormick a 1\u20130 win, his second 1\u20130 win against Los Angeles in 1960. **In the International League, Al Cicotte of the Toronto Maple Leafs pitches an 11-inning no-hitter against Montreal. *September 6 \u2013 In his final game at Yankee Stadium, Ted Williams hits his 518th career home run in a Red Sox 7\u20131 win. *September 10 \u2013 In Detroit, the Yankees' Mickey Mantle hits a home run in the 6th inning, the ball clearing the right field roof and landing in the Brooks Lumber Yard across Trumbull Avenue. In June 1985, Mantle's blow was retroactively measured at 643 feet, and will be listed in the Guinness Book of World Records at that distance. *September 13 \u2013 18-year-old outfielder Danny Murphy becomes the youngest Chicago Cubs player to hit a home run when he clouts a three-run homer off Bob Purkey of the Cincinnati Reds, as the Reds win 8\u20136 at home. Murphy will play just 49 games for the Cubs from 1960 to 1962. He will come back as a pitcher for the Chicago White Sox in 1969-70. *September 15 \u2013 Willie Mays ties the modern major league record with three triples in a game against the Phillies. The last National League player to hit three triples in a game was Roberto Clemente, in 1958. *September 16: **At the age of 39, Warren Spahn notches his 11th 20-win season with a 4\u20130 no-hitter against the Phillies. Spahn also sets a Milwaukee club record with 15 strikeouts in handing the last-place Phils their 90th loss of the year. **The Baltimore Orioles (83-58) and New York Yankees (82-57) open a crucial four games series with the Orioles just .002 in back of New York. Three days later, during a doubleheader, the Yankees will sweep Baltimore. The faltering Birds, now four back, will end up in second place, eight games back. *September 18 \u2013 At Wrigley Field, Ernie Banks sets a record by drawing his 27th intentional walk of the season. *September 19 \u2013 The Chicago White Sox pennant hopes are damaged with a nightcap 7\u20136 loss to the Detroit Tigers, after they win the opener, 8\u20134. Pinch hitter Norm Cash scores the decisive run in game two. Cash thus ends the season by grounding into no double plays, becoming the first American League player since league records on this were started in 1940. Teammates Dick McAuliffe and Roger Repoz will duplicate this in 1968. *September 20 \u2013 Boston Red Sox outfielder Carroll Hardy pinch-hits for Ted Williams, who is forced to leave the game after fouling a ball off his ankle, and grounds into a double play. On May 31, 1961, Hardy will pinch hit for rookie Carl Yastrzemski, making him the only player to go in for both future Hall of Famers. Hardy also hit his first major league home run pinch-hitting for Roger Maris when both were at Cleveland (May 18, 1958). *September 25: **For the first time since 1927, the Pittsburgh Pirates are headed for the World Series. **Ralph Terry clinches the New York Yankees 25th pennant with a 4\u20133 win over the Boston Red Sox. Luis Arroyo saves the win. It is Casey Stengel's 10th pennant in 12 years at New York. *September 28 \u2013 In his last major league at bat, Ted Williams picks out a 1-1 pitch by Baltimore's Jack Fisher and drives it 450 feet into the right-center field seats behind the Boston bullpen. It is Williams' 521st and last career home run, putting him third on the all-time list. Williams stays in the dugout, ignoring the thunderous ovation at Fenway Park, and refused to tip his hat to the hometown fans. However, they would make up for that 39 years later. ===October=== *October 2 \u2013 The Baltimore Orioles defeat the Washington Senators 2-1 at Griffith Stadium in the Senators' final game before their move to the Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul area. Milt Pappas wins the pitchers' duel against Pedro Ramos, who gives up a home run to Jackie Brandt for the deciding run. *October 3 \u2013 The New York Yankees head into the World Series with a 15-game winning streak, the 8th longest streak in the American League this century, after Dale Long's two-run 9th-inning home run gives them an 8\u20137 win over the Boston Red Sox. The 193 home runs are an AL season record, three better than the 1956 Yankees. RBI leader Roger Maris drives in three runs, but falls one home run short of Mickey Mantle's league-high 40. *October 5 \u2013 In a portent of things to come, Bill Mazeroski's two-run 5th-inning home run off Jim Coates is the difference as Pittsburgh beats the Yankees 6\u20134 in its first World Series win since 1925. Roy Face survives a two-run 9th-inning Elston Howard home run to preserve Vern Law's victory. *October 6 \u2013 Mickey Mantle hits two home runs in a Yankees 16\u20133 victory at Forbes Field, evening the World Series. A seven-run 6th inning overwhelms Pittsburgh. *October 8 \u2013 At Yankee Stadium, Bobby Richardson collects six RBI, including a grand slam off reliever Clem Labine in a six-run first inning, and Whitey Ford pitches a four-hitter 10\u20130 shutout to give the Yankees a 2-1 World Series lead, spoiling Pittsburgh manager Danny Murtaugh's 43rd birthday. *October 9 \u2013 Vern Law wins again, thanks to his own RBI single and Bill Virdon's two-run hit. Roy Face retires the final eight batters in order. The Pittsburgh Pirates 3\u20132 win evens the 1960 World Series. *October 10 \u2013 Bill Mazeroski stars again. His two-run double stakes Harvey Haddix to a 3\u20130 lead. Roy Face is called on once more for another hitless effort to preserve a 5\u20132 win over the Yankees and 3-2 World Series lead for the surprising Pirates. *October 12 \u2013 In Game Six of the World Series, Whitey Ford preserves the Yankees hopes with a seven-hit shutout at Forbes Field. Bob Friend is bombed again as the Yankees coasts 12\u20130. Bobby Richardson's two run-scoring triples give him a WS record of 12 RBI. *October 13 \u2013 The Pittsburgh Pirates defeat the New York Yankees, 10-9, in Game 7 of the World Series, to win their third World Championship, and first since 1925, four games to three. In a 9\u20139 tie, Bill Mazeroski leads off the last of the ninth inning and hits what is arguably the most dramatic home run in WS history, off Yankees P Ralph Terry. The drama of Mazeroski's home run was heightened by the excitement that preceded the home run: A combined total of seven runs were scored by both teams in a wild and whacky bottom of the eighth and top of the ninth. An oddity in this game \u2013 it is the only World Series game this century with no strikeouts recorded. Another oddity, this one to the 1960 World Series itself \u2013 Mazeroski's home run makes this 1960 World Series the only World Series in Major League history won by a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning of the seventh and deciding game. Despite Mazeroski's heroics, however, Yankees 2B Bobby Richardson is named the Series MVP, as the Yankees outscore Pittsburgh, 55 to 27. *October 17 \u2013 The National League votes to admit Houston and New York City teams to the league in 1962, the first structural change since 1900, and to go to a 10-team league. *October 18 \u2013 Instituting a mandatory retirement age of 65, New York Yankees co-owners Dan Topping and Del Webb relieve Casey Stengel as the team manager. Stengel says \"I wasn't retired\u2014they fired me.\" The veteran skipper has a 1,149-696 career record. *October 20 \u2013 Coach Ralph Houk, at age 41, is named to succeed Casey Stengel as the Yankees manager. Houk briefly led the Yankees in 1960 when Stengel was hospitalized. *October 26 \u2013 Trying to jump ahead of the National League, the American League admits Los Angeles and Minneapolis teams to the league with plans to have the new clubs begin competition in 1961 in the new 10-team league. Calvin Griffith is given permission to move the existing Washington Senators franchise to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, Minnesota. (An expansion team, also called the Senators, will be placed in Washington.) American League president Joe Cronin says the league will play a 162-game schedule, with 18 games against each opponent. The National League will balk, saying the two expansions are not analogous and that the American League was not invited to move into LA. *October 31- The San Francisco Giants acquire Alvin Dark from the Milwaukee Braves in exchange for infielder Andre Rodgers. However, Dark is not acquired as a player, but instead is acquired so he can become the team's manager. ===November\u2013December=== *November 2 \u2013 Hank Greenberg asks for American League dates at the Los Angeles Coliseum, home of the National League Dodgers. Greenberg and Bill Veeck are expected to run the new Los Angeles club in the AL. On November 17, Greenberg will drop out of the bidding to run the new franchise. *November 21 \u2013 Bob Scheffing signs to manage the Detroit Tigers after the job is turned down by Casey Stengel. *November 22 \u2013 The American League proposes that both leagues expand to nine teams in 1961 and begin interleague play. It will delay entering the Los Angeles market if the National League agrees. (There will be expansion to 10 teams in the American League in 1961, followed by the National League doing so in 1962, but interleague play does not arrive until .) *November 23 \u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Frank Howard is selected National League Rookie of the Year with 12 of 24 votes. The six-foot, nine-inch Howard belted 23 home runs during the regular season. *November 26 \u2013 The relocated American League team in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis \u2013 Saint Paul chooses the appropriate nickname Twins to represent its franchise. The team recently moved from Washington, D.C., where they were known as the Senators. *December 3 - The Milwaukee Brewers purchase the contract of Billy Martin from the Cincinnati Reds. *December 5 \u2013 American League president Joe Cronin suggests that if the National League starts its new New York City franchise in 1961, the AL will stay out of Los Angeles until 1962. The NL turned down the suggested compromise of November 22 because Houston will not be ready in 1961. *December 6 \u2013 A group headed by movie star Gene Autry and former football star Bob Reynolds is awarded the new American League Los Angeles Angels. Charlie Finley withdraws his bid for Los Angeles and offers to purchase control of the Kansas City Athletics. On December 20, Finley will buy 52 percent of the A's from Arnold Johnson's estate. *December 21 \u2013 Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley says his team will have no manager, but will use a college of coaches. ==Births== ===January=== *January 3 \u2013 Randy Hunt *January 4 \u2013 Paul Gibson *January 8 \u2013 Randy Ready
