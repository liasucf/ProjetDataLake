Whitney, The New York Times, 16 January 1989 who assassinated Russian Bolshevik revolutionary Leon Trotsky in Mexico City in August 1940 with an ice axe. He served 20 years in a Mexican prison for the murder. His mother was presented with an Order of Lenin for her participation in the plot to kill Trotsky. His mother participated in the preparation of the assassination, waited for Ramon near the house of Trotsky but escaped to Moscow. For exception of Ramon Mercader all other persons who participated in the preparation of assassination obtained Soviet awards as well. Ramon was not awarded because nobody could learn how he behaved during the trial and how he would behave in prison.L. Mlechin, P. Guontiev. The state corporation of killers. //Novaya gazeta. 08.2020 Mercader was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union after his release in 1961. He divided his time between Cuba and the Soviet Union. ==Life== Mercader was born on 7 February, 1913 in Barcelona to Eustaquia (or Eustacia) Mar\u00eda Caridad del R\u00edo Hern\u00e1ndez, the daughter of a Cantabrian merchant who had become affluent in Spanish Cuba, and Pau (or Pablo) Mercader Marina (b. 1885), the son of a Catalan textiles industrialist from Badalona. Mercader grew up in France with his mother after his parents divorced. She was an ardent Communist who fought in the Spanish Civil War and served in the Soviet international underground. As a young man, Mercader embraced Communism, working for leftist organizations in Spain during the mid-1930s. He was briefly imprisoned for his activities, but was released in 1936 when the left-wing Popular Front coalition won in the elections of that year. During the Spanish Civil War, Mercader was recruited by Nahum Eitingon, an officer of the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, an agency preceding the KGB), and trained in Moscow as a Soviet agent.\"Soviet Readers Finally Told Moscow Had Trotsky Slain\", The New York Times, 5 January 1989. His cousin, actress Mar\u00eda Mercader, became the second wife of Italian film director Vittorio De Sica. Mercader's contacts with and befriending of Trotskyists began during the Spanish Civil War. George Orwell's biographer Gordon Bowkerrandomhouse.co.nz-authors Gordon Bowker biography in Random House website relates how English communist David Crook, ostensibly a volunteer for the Republican side, was sent to Albacete. He was taught Spanish\"The Spanish Civil War and the Popular Front\", lecture by Ann Talbot, World Socialist Web Site, August 2007 and also given a crash course in surveillance techniques by Mercader.\"The Guardian's Prism revelations, Orwell and the spooks\" by Richard Keeble, University of Lincoln, 13 June 2013 Crook, on orders from the NKVD, used his job as war reporter for the News Chronicle to spy on Orwell and his Independent Labour Party comrades in the POUM (Workers' Party of Marxist Unification) militia. ==Assassination of Trotsky== In 1938, while a student at the Sorbonne, Mercader, with the help of NKVD agent Mark Zborowski, befriended Sylvia Ageloff, a young Jewish-American intellectual from Brooklyn, New York and a confidante of Trotsky in Paris. Mercader assumed the identity of Jacques Mornard, supposedly the son of a Belgian diplomat. A year later, Mercader was contacted by a representative of the \"Bureau of the Fourth International.\"Sayers, Michael, and Albert E. Kahn (1946). The Great Conspiracy against Russia. Second Printing (Paper Edition), pp. 334-335. London, UK: Collet's Holdings Ltd. Ageloff returned to her native Brooklyn in September that same year, and Mercader joined her, assuming the identity of Canadian Frank Jacson. He was given a passport that originally belonged to a Canadian citizen named Tony Babich, a member of the Spanish Republican Army who died fighting during the Spanish Civil War. Babich's photograph was removed and replaced by one of Mercader.Hansen, J. (October 1940). \"With Trotsky to the end,\" in Fourth International, volume I, pp. 115-123. Mercader told Ageloff that he had purchased forged documents to avoid military service. In October 1939, Mercader moved to Mexico City and persuaded Ageloff to join him there. Leon Trotsky was living with his family in Coyoac\u00e1n, then a village on the southern fringes of Mexico City. He was exiled from the Soviet Union after losing the power struggle against Stalin's rise to authority. Trotsky had been the subject of an armed attack against his house, mounted by allegedly Soviet-recruited locals, including the Marxist-Leninist muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros.Patenaude, Bertrand (2009). Stalin's Nemesis: The Exile and Murder of Leon Trotsky, p. 138\\. London, UK: Faber & Faber The attack was organised and prepared by Pavel Sudoplatov, deputy director of the foreign department of the NKVD. In his memoirs, Sudoplatov claimed that, in March 1939, he had been taken by his chief, Lavrentiy Beria, to see Stalin. Stalin told them that \"if Trotsky is finished the threat will be eliminated\" and gave the order that \"Trotsky should be eliminated within a year.\" After that attack failed, a second team was sent, headed by Eitingon, formerly the deputy GPU agent in Spain. He allegedly was involved in the kidnap, torture, and murder of Andreu Nin. The new plan was to send a lone assassin against Trotsky. The team included Mercader and his mother Caridad. Sudoplatov claimed in his autobiography Special Tasks that he selected Ram\u00f3n Mercader for the task of carrying out the assassination.Bart Barnes (27 September 1996). \"Pavel Sudoplatov, 89, dies\". The Washington Post Through his lover Sylvia Ageloff's access to the Coyoac\u00e1n house, Mercader, as Jacson, began to meet with Trotsky, posing as a sympathizer to his ideas, befriending his guards, and doing small favors.\"The fight of the Trotsky family - interview with Esteban Volkov\" (1988), In Defence of Marxism website, 21 August 2006 On 20 August 1940, Mercader was alone with Trotsky in his study under the pretext of showing the older man a document. Mercader struck Trotsky from behind and fatally wounded him on the head with an ice axe while the Russian was looking at the document.CNN, (11 July 2005). \"Trotsky murder weapon may have been found\" The blow failed to kill Trotsky, and he got up and grappled with Mercader. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky's guards burst into the room and beat Mercader nearly to death. Trotsky, deeply wounded but still conscious, ordered them to spare his attacker's life and let him speak.Deborah Bonello and Ole Alsaker, (20 August 2012). \"Trotsky's assassination remembered by his grandson\", The Guardian Caridad and Eitingon were waiting outside the compound in separate cars to provide a getaway, but when Mercader did not return, they left and fled the country. Trotsky was taken to a hospital in the city and operated on but died the next day as a result of severe brain injuries.Lynn Walsh (summer 1980). \"Forty Years Since Leon Trotsky's Assassination\", Militant International Review Official copy (dated 1944) of the sentencing decision passed by the Mexican court on Mercader, listed as \"Jacques Mornard Vandendresched or Frank Jackson\" Trotsky's guards turned Mercader over to the Mexican authorities, and he refused to acknowledge his true identity. He only identified himself as Jacques Mornard. Mercader claimed to the police that he had wanted to marry Ageloff, but Trotsky had forbidden the marriage. He alleged that a violent quarrel with Trotsky had led to his wanting to murder Trotsky. He stated: In 1940, Jacques Mornard was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison by the Sixth Criminal Court of Mexico. His true identity as Ram\u00f3n Mercader eventually was confirmed by the Venona project after the fall of the Soviet Union. Ageloff was arrested by the Mexican police as an accomplice because she had lived with Mercader, on and off, for about two years up to the time of the assassination. Charges against her eventually were dropped. ==Release and honors== Shortly after the assassination, Joseph Stalin presented Mercader's mother Eustaquia Caridad with the Order of Lenin for her part in the operation.Don Levine, Isaac (1960), The Mind of an Assassin, D1854 Signet Book, pp. 109-110, 173. After the first few years in prison, Mercader requested to be released on parole, but the request was denied by the Mexican authorities. They were represented by Jes\u00fas Siordia and the criminologist Alfonso Quiroz Cuar\u00f3n. After almost 20 years in prison, Mercader was released from Mexico City's Palacio de Lecumberri prison on 6 May 1960. He moved to Havana, Cuba, where Fidel Castro's new socialist government welcomed him. In 1961, Mercader moved to the Soviet Union and subsequently was presented with the country's highest decoration, Hero of the Soviet Union, personally by Alexander Shelepin, the head of the KGB. He divided his time between Cuba and the Soviet Union for the rest of his life. Ram\u00f3n Mercader died in Havana in 1978 of lung cancer. He is buried under the name Ram\u00f3n Ivanovich Lopez (\u0420\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043d \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0441) in Moscow's Kuntsevo Cemetery. His last words are said to have been: \"I hear it always. I hear the scream. I know he's waiting for me on the other side.\" ==Decorations and awards== * Order of Lenin and the star of a Hero, 1961 * Hero of the Soviet Union, 1961 ==In popular culture== * In 1967, West German television presented L.D.
