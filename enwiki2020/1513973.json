    "text": "is a manga artist from Tokyo. He made his debut with STRAIGHT in Morning, Kodansha's monthly seinen manga magazine, but is known for his works with Kodansha's rival publisher Shogakukan, including Tekkonkinkreet, Ping Pong and No. 5. He has received critical praise for his unconventional and often surrealist art style. Ping Pong and Blue Spring have been adapted into live- action feature films. Animation studio Studio 4\u00b0C adapted Tekkonkinkreet into an animated feature film. In 2007 he received an Excellence Award for manga at the Japan Media Arts Festival for the art of Takemitsu Zamurai. He is the cousin of Santa Inoue, another manga artist. ==Career== Matsumoto originally wanted to be a soccer player, but changed to artist as an occupation instead. After his initial success in the Comic Open contest, he began touring France in 1986, an event that became a significant point in his career. The manga he produced covers a variety of topics, from sports to family comedies to science fiction epics. In 1993, he began work on the Tekkonkinkreet manga, which became a success in the Big Spirits magazine, and published a series of short stories in a collection called Nihon no Kyodai that was publicized at the time by Comic Ar\u00e9 magazine. Ping Pong appeared in Big Spirits in 1996, soon followed by the series No. 5 in the Shogakukan magazine in 2001. The Tekkonkinkreet anime was released in Japan in late 2006, and both the anime and manga have been published in English. ==Influences== Matsumoto has cited Moebius, Enki Bilal, Katsuhiro Otomo, Shotaro Ishinomori and Tsuchida Seiki as influences on his work. ==Works== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
