He then began his musical career in 2007 under the moniker Punch. In March 2016, Punch revealed plans to release his debut studio album. Punch told Billboard that he plans on doing \"a project for sure\", even though his artistic process has usually come in spurts: \"I think I\u2019m going to finally finish it because I write a lot and I record every so often. I think I\u2019m just gonna go ahead and knock it out at this point.\" On December 5, 2016, Punch released a single titled \"Gold\". == Discography == === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of studio albums, with year released !
