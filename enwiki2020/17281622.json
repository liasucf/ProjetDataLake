Built in 1878, Providence City Hall is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==The Need for a City Hall== ===Market House=== Upon the city's incorporation in 1832, most city business was conducted at the Market House. The City Council, Mayor's Office, and Board of Aldermen were located on the second floor; as the city grew, the city spread to the third floor, and eventually took over the entire building, which became known as the \"City Building.\" Before long, even this wasn't enough space, and in 1845 the City Council resolved to create a permanent municipal building. The community spent the next 30 years searching for a suitable location, because half the Council votes were on the east side of the Providence River, and half the votes were on the west. This resulted in what some historians have referred to as \"Providence's Thirty Years War,\" as the council bickered over where to site the new building. ===The City Hall Theater=== The city purchased several lots for the construction of a new City Hall. Construction was delayed, however, and the land was leased to C.N. Harrington, who built a wood frame theater on the site. The theater was notable for lectures, performances and readings that included writer Charles Dickens. In 1869, the building was renamed \"Harrington Opera House.\" In 1874, the structure was closed for demolition. == Building history == ===\"Our Municipal Palace\"=== An open call for design led to twenty one submissions, and four finalists. Samuel J. F. Thayer's \"Blue Wafer\" design was chosen, and he was paid $1000.00USD.History of City Hall. Providenceri.com. Retrieved on June 1, 2014. The building, modified from its original design, would cost the city $1,000,000.USD. The cornerstone was laid on June 24, 1875. Inaugurated on November 14, 1878, The Providence Journal called the building \"Our Municipal Palace.\" President Teddy Roosevelt spoke on the City Hall steps on August 23, 1902, and John F. Kennedy spoke on November 7, 1960, just before he was elected president. In 2000, Friedrich St. Florian designed outdoor plaques for the building. Haven Brothers Diner, a Rhode Island landmark, is mobile cafe situated east of City Hall every evening. In 1975, Mayor Vincent A. Cianci, Jr., historian and preservationist, Antoinette Downing, and art history teacher Eleanore Monahon began efforts to rehabilitate the deteriorating structure, after concerns began to grow about possible demolition. The project was completed in the 1990s.History of City Hall. Providenceri.com.

It operated in a fashion similar to a grandfather clock, and each morning would be wound up by the janitor. It sent battery powered signals to other clocks in the building. Although the building was wired for electricity shortly after its construction, the clock mechanism remains in place and can be seen in the fifth floor Archives.\" \"The original main floor included a reception room and the office for the City Messenger. His office contained an elaborate array of communication devices, 50 speaking tubes, 50 electric bells and 50 annunciators which connected to all departments. Next to the Messenger's Office was an ornate reception room, 23 feet by 33 feet, with large mirrors hung at each end of the room.

The remainder of the fifth floor was used by the City Engineer and for storage. The upper levels of the building are within a high, convex, mansard slate roof that rises above the parallel-eaved parapet. Fashioned into the mansard dome are ornamental bulls-eye dormers.\" \"The mansard roof area is reached by an iron stairway from the fifth floor where, originally, large batteries were stored to generate electricity for the city-wide fire alarm system and for the operation of the clocks and bells in the building. Another flight of stairs led to a higher area in the mansard dome which was also used for storage.\"History of City Hall. Providenceri.com (June 3, 1916).

It is not true that the poor have grown poorer; but some of the rich have grown so very much richer that, where multitudes of men are herded together in a limited space, the contrast strikes the onlooker as more violent than formerly. On the whole, our people earn more and live better than ever before, and the progress of which we are so proud could not have taken place had it not been for the up building of industrial centers, such as this in which I am speaking. But together with the good there has come a measure of evil.\u2026 Under present-day conditions it is as necessary to have corporations in the business world as it is to have organizations, unions, among wage-workers. We have a right to ask in each case only this: that good, and not harm, shall follow.Context of 'August 23, 1902: Roosevelt Advocates Federal Regulation, Oversight of Corporations'.
