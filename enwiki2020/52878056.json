Mount Bogart is situated northwest of Mount Kidd, and both can be seen from Highway 40 near the Kananaskis Village junction. ==History== Mount Bogart was named by Donaldson Bogart Dowling (1858-1925), after his mother, whose maiden name was Bogart. Donaldson Dowling, an engineer with the Geological Survey of Canada, explored the area in 1904. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1930 by Kate Gardiner and Walter Feuz. The duo also made first ascents of Mount Lyautey and Mount Galatea in 1930.Thorington p. 19, 56 The mountain's name was officially adopted in 2006 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Mount Bogart is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Bogart is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains east into the Kananaskis River and west into Spray Lakes Reservoir which both empty to the Bow River. ==References== ===Sources=== * ==Gallery== File:Kananaskis aerial.jpg|Mount Bogart far left, Lougheed center, Skogan Peak right File:Mount Bogart in Kananaskis.jpg|Mount Bogart centered in the distance ==External links== * Mount Bogart photo : Flickr Bogart Bogart ",
