She is a professor in the department of mathematics at Emory University. ==Education and career== Powers graduated from the University of Chicago in 1980, with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. She completed her Ph.D. in 1985 at Cornell University. Her dissertation, Finite Constructable [sic] Spaces of Signatures, was supervised by Alex F. T. W. Rosenberg. After completing her doctorate, she joined the faculty at the University of Hawaii, but moved to Emory University only two years later, in 1987. She was on leave from Emory as a Humboldt Fellow and Alexander von Humboldt research professor at the University of Regensburg in 1991\u20131992, as a visiting professor at the Complutense University of Madrid in 2002\u20132003, and as a program officer at the National Science Foundation in 2013\u20132015. ==Personal== Powers is married to Colm Mulcahy, an Irish mathematician, magician, and columnist with the same doctoral advisor. ==References== ==External links== * * Home page Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Algebraic geometers Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Cornell University alumni Category:University of Hawaii faculty Category:Emory University faculty Category:Alexander von Humboldt Fellows Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
