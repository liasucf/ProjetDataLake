They both studied law together and Johnson\u2019s husband was admitted to practice law in 1915. Since women were not permitted to take the examinations, Johnson had to wait until a legislative act was passed in order to give women that right.

Johnson was the third woman, as she was preceded by Minnie Anderson Hale and Betty Reynolds Cobb respectively that same year. == See also == * List of first women lawyers and judges in Georgia == References == Category:Georgia (U.S. state) lawyers Category:American women lawyers ",
