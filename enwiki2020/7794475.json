They were housed in the open while huts were being built. By the spring of 1942 an estimated 18,000 had died of hunger and disease, mainly typhus fever. * April 1943: Part of the camp is turned into a hospital for POWs. The remainder of the camp is separated and taken over by the SS to house Jews ostensibly for shipment overseas in exchange for German civilians. * Late 1943: The POW camp is closed and the entire facility becomes Bergen-Belsen concentration camp ==See also== * Nazi concentration camps ==Sources== * Official web-site of the Bergen-Belsen memorial * Official list of Stalags in German. ==References== * Bergen-Belsen: Wehrmacht POW Camp 1940\u20131945, Concentration Camp 1943\u20131945, Displaced Persons Camp 1945\u20131950. ed. by Lower Saxony Memorials Foundation, G\u00f6ttingen 2010. .
