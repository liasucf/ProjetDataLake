    "text": "Climates were a British melodic hardcore band formed in 2011 in Lincoln, England, by Wesley Thompson, Sam Bowden, Fil Thorpe Evans, Harley Clifton and Henry Othen. However Evans departed in early 2013 to join Neck Deep full-time and Clifton and Othen both departed in 2012. The firing of Thompson in 2014 lead to the bands eventual break up (from which Bowden, Powels, Pritchard and Dawson recruited Kaya Tarsus forming Blood Youth). ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Album details ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| Type |- ! scope=\"row\"|What Means The Most | *Released: 6 August 2012 *Label: Self-Released | EP |- ! scope=\"row\"|Body Clocks | *Released: 13 October 2014 *Label: Small Town Records (UK), Artery Recordings (International) | LP |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Waiting To Exhale\", | *Released: 29 March 2012 *Label: Self-Released |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Reconcile\" | *Released: 26 December 2012 *Label: Self-Released |} ==Members== ===Final line-up=== *Wesley Thompson - lead vocals (2011-2014) *Sam Bowden - guitar (2011-2014) *Max Dawson - guitar (2013-2014) bass (2013) *Chris Pritchard - bass (2013; 2014) *Matt Powels - drums (2012-2014) ===Past members=== *Fil Thorpe Evans - guitar (2011-2012) *Josh Geeson - guitar (2013) *Harley Clifton - bass (2011-2012) *Henry Othen - drums (2011-2012) ===Timeline=== ==Musical style== Climates' musical style has been described as melodic hardcore, hardcore punk, heavy metal and post-hardcore ==References== Category:Melodic hardcore groups Category:British hardcore punk groups Category:Musical groups established in 2011 ",
