The red and white building behind the bridge is the old H\u00f4tel de Ville (town hall) Ch\u00ean\u00e9e (, Tchinn\u00eaye Walloon) is a former Walloon commune in Belgium that was merged into Li\u00e8ge in 1977. Ch\u00ean\u00e9e is part of the province and arrondissement of Li\u00e8ge. Ch\u00ean\u00e9e lays at the river mouth of the two rivers Vesdre and Ourthe. It had around 9.101 inhabitants in 2015. The postal code of Ch\u00ean\u00e9e is 4032 and is situated around 72 meters above sea level. == Etymology == The coat of arms of Ch\u00ean\u00e9e The name Ch\u00ean\u00e9e comes from the French ch\u00eanaie (oak-grove, a place many oak trees grew). The three diamonds in the coat of arms symbolize oak leaves or grains of sand, reflecting the city's history as a site of glass production. == History == Industrial quarter, Rue du Gravier, 1 \"Ch\u00ean\u00e9e - Rue du Moulin et Verrerie, (1850)\" USA 3070551 of 3rd Armored Division is welcomed by inhabitants of Ch\u00ean\u00e8, September 8th, 1944 Ch\u00ean\u00e9e originated at the crossing of two Roman roads; the first leading from Trier to Tongeren, the second from Jupille over Theux to Stavelot. The crossing was also close to a ford, which was important to pass cows over the Ourth before the Pont de Lhoneux (the bridge of Lhonneux) was built. Ch\u00ean\u00e9e was mentioned the first time in a 12th-century document under the name of Kesneies. Until 1266 Ch\u00ean\u00e9e was part of the Vogtei of Jupille, which was subordinated to the diocese of Verdun. At that year it was affiliated into the principality of Li\u00e8ge. The bishop of Verdun, Haimo of Verdun got the village as a gift from the German Emperor Henry II in the year 1008. In 1266 the Bishopric of Verdun Robert II of M\u00e9didan donated the Vogtei Jupille to the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge, Henry III of Geldern. That meant, that all the villages and villagers became property of Henry III and fell under his jurisdiction. Because of his unworthy and extravagant way of life, Henry III was deposed by Gregory X. In 1318 Ch\u00ean\u00e9e was burned down by John of Bohemia while being at war with prince-bishop Adolph II of the Mark. 1691 it was burned, again, this time by the army of Louis XIV of France under its lieutenant-general under the king in person Louis-Fran\u00e7ois de Boufflers. Ch\u00ean\u00e9e also had to suffer from the retreating Austrian army after the lost Battle of Fleurus in 1794. During the French epoch at the end of the 18th century, Ch\u00ean\u00e9e became an independent commune. The Battle of Li\u00e8ge (French: Bataille de Li\u00e8ge) was the opening engagement of the German invasion of Belgium and the first battle of the First World War. In World War II Ch\u00ean\u00e9e was liberated from Nazi occupation by troops of the 36th Infantry Regiment on September 8, 1944. In 1977 Ch\u00ean\u00e9e became a section of the city of Li\u00e8ge. 2008 the roof of the Saint-Albert elementary school of Ch\u00ean\u00e9e collapsed overnight. Nobody was hurt. At the junction of Vesder and Ourthe the building of a mill still stands. == Glass manufacturing == There were three glass manufactures in Ch\u00ean\u00e9e in 1758: Grandchamps & Coune, Bonniver and Cambresier & Co. In 1872, the glass factory of Van Steenacker was founded by the entrepreneurs Amiable, Belleflamme, Louvet and Berneau. Around the same time the company S.A. of the Verreries de was founded under the direction of Cochet. In the course of the closure of the glassworks Bougart in Manage 1875 one of the sons of Bougart and the production manager Auguste Van Steenacker came to Vaux. They founded the Verrerie Bougart, Sortia et Cie with Cochet, Sortia and Colin. When the company Belleflamme, Louvet et Berneau gave up its glassworks in Ch\u00ean\u00e9e in February 1888, it was taken over by the Verrerie de Vaux. After Fran\u00e7ois Delhaize and Herman Dethier had succeeded their parents, Auguste Van Steenacker took over the glassworks of Vaux in February 1895 and founded with his sons Fran\u00e7ois-Charles and William the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme des Verreries de Vaux. The glassworks of Ch\u00ean\u00e9e was then led by Fran\u00e7ois Delhaize. World War I interrupted production. In 1919, production was resumed, but meanwhile the competition had grown abroad. Many old markets were completely or almost completely lost. The glassworks of Vaux ran into considerable financial difficulties and could not find the urgently needed investor. In 1930, the hut was abandoned, the land and buildings were taken over by Magotteaux. In the end Verrerie Grandchamps stayed as the local manufacturer. They produced the bottles for the mineral water brand Spa. Verrerie Grandchamps succeeded Verreries d'Ambl\u00e8ve, who were founded 1721 in Aywaille. == People from Ch\u00ean\u00e9e == * Cl\u00e9lie Lamberty, Artist, painter (1930\u20132013) * Charles Descardre, Mayor (1882-1891) * Lucien Fran\u00e7ois, Judge at the Belgian Constitutional Court (1989\u20132004) (born in 1934) * Jean-Louis Lejaxhe, Writer * Nicolas Gilsoul, Rally Racer (born in 1982) * Some ancestors of Kate Bolduan, the family Rousselle, emigrated from Ch\u00ean\u00e9e to America in 1912. == External links == * old postcards with images of Ch\u00ean\u00e9es in the 19th century. * The 36th Armored Infantry Regiment frees Ch\u00ean\u00e8e during WWII - Images * Glass works from Ch\u00ean\u00e9e == Gallery == Ch\u00ean\u00e9e - maison communale.jpg|The former parish hall of Ch\u00ean\u00e9e.
