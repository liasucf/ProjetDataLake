    "text": "Francisco de Moraes Cabral, also spelled Francisco de Morais Cabral (1500? \u2013 1572), was a Portuguese writer. Born in Bragan\u00e7a, he served as personal secretary to the Portuguese ambassador in France, and composed, during two voyages to Paris (1540 and 1546), a chivalric romance called Palmerin d'Angleterre (Palmeirim de Inglaterra; Palmerin of England), a \"spin-off\" of the popular Amad\u00eds de Gaula series. Moraes' work would also obtain considerable success across Europe. Because of its title, it was particularly successful in England, where it was reprinted several times. A Spanish translation was made by Luis Hurtado in 1547, preceding the actual publication of the Portuguese text in 1567. It was translated from the Portuguese by Eug\u00e8ne-Fran\u00e7ois Garay de Montglave and can be found in Eug\u00e8ne Renduel, Biblioth\u00e8que portugaise Warnier, 1829, Paris, 4 vol. He also wrote an autobiographical work called Desculpas de uns amores, set in France, which was published posthumously in 1624. He died at \u00c9vora. ==References== *Auteurs: Francisco de Morais *Letteratura e media *Iberian Chivalric literature Category:1500s births Category:1572 deaths Category:16th-century Portuguese people Category:Date of death missing Category:People from Bragan\u00e7a, Portugal Category:Portuguese Renaissance writers Moras, Fancisco de Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
