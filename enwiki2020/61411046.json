    "text": "The chaj\u00e1 () cake is a typical dessert in Uruguayan cuisine. It was created on April 27, 1927 by Orlando Castellano, the owner of the Confiter\u00eda Las Familias in the city of Paysand\u00fa. This dessert owes its name to the Southern screamer, a bird (locally known as the chaj\u00e1) native to the central and southern parts of South America. This bird is also particularly abundant in the Entre Rios Province in Argentina. The main ingredients to this dessert are meringue, sponge cake (bizcochuelo), cream (crema de leche; crema doble) and fruits (typically peaches and strawberries are added). Variations of this dessert can be elaborated on by adding dulce de leche or chocolate. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Uruguayan cuisine Category:Uruguayan inventions Category:Cakes ",
