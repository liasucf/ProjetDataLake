    "text": "The Lourinh\u00e3 Formation () is a fossil rich geological formation in western Portugal, named for the municipality of Lourinh\u00e3. The formation is Late Jurassic in age (Kimmeridgian/Tithonian) and is notable for containing a fauna especially similar to that of the Morrison Formation in the United States and a lesser extent to the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. There are also similarities to the nearby Villar del Arzobispo Formation. The stratigraphy of the formation and the basin in general is complex and controversial, with the constituent member beds belonging to the formation varying between different authors Besides the fossil bones, Lourinh\u00e3 Formation is well known for the fossil tracks and fossilized dinosaur eggs. The Lourinh\u00e3 Formation includes several lithostratigraphic units, such as Praia da Amoreira-Porto Novo Members and the Sobral Unit.Weishampel, David B. et al. (2004). \"Dinosaur distribution (Late Jurassic, Europe).\" In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm\u00f3lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd ed., Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 545\u2013549. . == Lithology and depositional history == === Depositional history === Location of the Lusitanian basin within the Iberian Peninsula The Lourinh\u00e3 Formation is located within the Lusitanian Basin, a mostly onshore North South orientated rift basin within western Portugal, formed during the Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean, with sediment deposition beginning during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. It primarily consists of syn-rift near-coastal continental siliciclastic sediments, with several marine intercalations. The primary flow direction was North to South, originating from Galicia and flowing between the Iberian landmass to the east and the now largely submerged Berlengas horst, a North-South oriented ridge, to the west. === Stratigraphy === The unit was first formally proposed by Hill in 1988. The stratigraphy of the Lourinh\u00e3 Formation is complex and varies between sub-basins with several competing stratigraphic proposals and there is currently no consensus on the matter, one of the most recent stratigraphies, divides the formation into three members which are from oldest to youngest the Praia da Amoreira-Porto Novo Member, Praia Azul Member, and the Assenta Member. ==== Praia da Amoreira-Porto Novo Member ==== The Praia da Amoreira- Porto Novo Member is composed of the Priaia de Amoreira Member, which consists of massive mudrock-sand with metre thick sandstone lenses, with massive mudrock with calcrete. The overlying Poto Novo Mb. consists of massive bodies of sandstone, often cross bedded. The environment of deposition is interpreted as a meandering fluvial system, while the Porto Novo Mb is interpreted as a deltaic deposit. It is interpreted to be latest Kimmeridgian in age. ==== Praia Azul Member ==== The Praia Azul Member, formerly known as the Sobral unit/member is 80 to 130 metres thick and consists of tabular marls and mudstones, with rare sandstones bodies.There are three distinct laterally extensive (>20 km) thin shelly carbonate horizons within this member, indicating brief marine transgressions. South of Santa Cruz primarily consists of sandstone with rare conglomerate. The age is considered to be latest Kimmeridigan to earliest Tithonian. ==== Assenta Member ==== The Assenta Member is around 300 metres thick and predominantly consists of mudstones with frequent layers of caliche. Near the top of the member several layers of tens of metres thick nodular and marly bioclastic limestones are present, containing marine benthic forams, the nodularity is derived from intense Thalassinoides burrowing. It is predominately late Tithonian in age, with the last few metres probably being earliest Berriasian. The environment of deposition is interpreted as being an upper fluvial-dominated delta to meandering fluvial systems flowing on a paralic plain. == Dinosaurs of the Lourinh\u00e3 Formation == In a 2003 study, an analysis of all Portuguese dinosaurs was published. The study created a cladogram showing the possible relations of all Portuguese dinosaurs, including those at the time known from the Lourinh\u00e3 Formation. === Saurichia === ==== Theropods ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" |- !
