The house remained in the Clayton family until 1950. The present owners, who have owned the property since 1952, converted the property to office use in 1988. They operate a large marina and offer boat mooring services but plan to convert the property into flats. ==References== Category:Grade I listed buildings in Buckinghamshire Category:Country houses in Buckinghamshire Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Grade II listed parks and gardens in Buckinghamshire Category:Grade II listed buildings in Buckinghamshire Category:Buildings and structures on the River Thames Category:Georgian architecture in England Category:Marlow, Buckinghamshire Category:Robert Taylor buildings ",
