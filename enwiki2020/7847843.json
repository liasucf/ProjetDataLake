With partner Kimberly Navarro, he is the 2008 Four Continents bronze medalist and a two-time (2008 & 2009) U.S. national bronze medalist. == Personal life == Bommentre was born May 10, 1984 in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia. He attends Drexel University. He has two younger sisters, Ashley and Brianne. == Career == Early in his career, Bommentre competed with Allison Seitchik and Kirsten Frisch. He teamed up with Kendra Goodwin in the spring of 2003. They won the pewter medal at the 2004 U.S. Championships and competed at the 2004 Skate America and the 2004 Cup of Russia. Goodwin and Bommentre announced the end of their partnership in March 2005. Bommentre teamed up with Kimberly Navarro after a tryout in April 2005. They won the bronze medal at the 2008 U.S. Championships, and were chosen to represent the United States at the 2008 Four Continents, where they finished in 3rd, and the 2008 World Championships in Gothenburg, Sweden, where they were 12th. At the 2009 Nationals, Navarro/Bommentre again finished 3rd, but were left off the Worlds team in favor of Tanith Belbin / Benjamin Agosto, who had missed U.S. Nationals due to injury. They did compete at the 2009 Four Continents, where they finished in sixth place. In the Olympic season, Navarro/Bommentre finished 4th at U.S. Nationals, and were not named to the Olympic team. When Belbin/Agosto ended their competitive career following the Olympics, they were selected to compete at the 2010 World Championships. They were 14th in their second Worlds appearance. Navarro/Bommentre announced their retirement from competition on May 11, 2010. They perform with the Ice Theatre of New York and, in November 2012, they taped an appearance in an episode of Glee. == Programs == === With Navarro === {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
