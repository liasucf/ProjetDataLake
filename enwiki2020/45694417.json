    "text": "== Juneau Icefield Research Camp Facilities == The Juneau Icefield Research Program (JIRP) and its parent organization, the Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research (FGER), maintains several research facilities around the expanse of the Juneau Icefield for the purpose of providing educational and expeditionary experience to students with training in Earth sciences, wilderness survival, and mountaineering skills. These camps are private facilities and are operated in accordance with a U.S. Forest Service Special Use Permit, which stipulates that the facilities can be used only for educational and research purposes by the Juneau Icefield Research Program. Thus all non-JIRP related visitation and use of these camps is prohibited. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:both;border:2px solid black; background: lightcyan; color: black\" |+FFGR/JIRP Research Facilities Summary |- !
