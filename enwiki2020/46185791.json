    "text": "On May 25, 1905, there was a fight in Velika Ho\u010da () between the Serbian Chetnik Organization, a Serbian rebel faction, and Ottoman irregulars from Orahovac. ==Prelude== The Fight on \u010celopek (April 16, 1905), fought between 120 Serbian guerillas and Ottoman officers accompanied by Ottoman Albanian bashi-bozuks, ended in a great victory after the guerillas managed to overtake three peaks; the Ottomans had over 200 dead and wounded, while the guerillas only had 2 dead.; ; The victory enraged the Ottomans, who began manhunting the rebels. The rebels were forced to retreat across the border, and the bands were subsequently dispersed. The bands intended to cross Ibarski Kola\u0161in, Prizrenska Gora, \u0160ar Mountains and Suva Planina to their respective areas. The journey of Lazar Kujund\u017ei\u0107's band proved catastrophal. ==Fighting== The group of 7 fighters, led by vojvoda Lazar Kujund\u017ei\u0107, vojvoda Savatije Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and sub-lieutenant \u017divojin Milovanovi\u0107, arrived at night-time at the village of Velika Ho\u010da near Prizren. This group returned to the field having crossed Kur\u0161umlija, Podujevo, Ibarski Kola\u0161in and Podrima. The group's leader, teacher Kujund\u017ei\u0107, excellently knew the customs and language of the Albanians. Velika Ho\u010da was a Serbian village with only two Albanian tower houses (kule). In order to prevent revenge of the Albanians on the Velika Ho\u010da Serbs, Kujund\u017ei\u0107 chose to pay tribute to one of the Albanian houses, whose host gave him his word (besa). As the Chetniks had supper and fell asleep, the Albanian notified the Albanians of nearby Orahovac. A mob of 1,500 Albanians, and some Ottoman soldiers, surrounded the house. The Ottoman yuzbashi (captain) called for the Chetniks to give themselves up, to which the Chetniks answered with a bullet hail, killing the captain and four askeri. The fusillade continued over the day, until dusk, when a group of Albanians broke into the lower floor, which, as in all kule, was the stable for cattle. They shot through the ceiling, managing to kill five of the Chetniks, then set the house on fire. The remaining two jumped out of the house shooting, but were instantly killed. According to documents of the Consulate in Pristina, more than 40 Albanians and Ottoman soldiers died during the fight.

She replied that her son was a daskal (teacher), and no ka\u00e7ak (outlaw), and that the body was somebody else. Inspired by this event, count Ivo Vojnovi\u0107 wrote a drama in verse, Lazarevo Vaskrsenje (\"Lazar's Resurrection\"). Serbian major and Chetnik vojvoda Bo\u017ein Simi\u0107 cited that Kujund\u017ei\u0107's mother's words were: \"No, that is not my son. I was unlucky to have not given birth to such a hero.\" (Ne to nije moj sin. Ja nisam imala sre\u0107u da rodim takvog junaka). Serbian major Milosav Jeli\u0107, a journalist and Chetnik, published the poem Kujund\u017ei\u0107a majka (\"Kujund\u017ei\u0107's Mother\") in the collection of Srbijanski venac. Serbian history books about the Serbian Chetnik Organization call the group heroes. ==See also== *Fight in Tabanovce (1905) *Fight on \u010celopek (1905) *Fight on \u010celopek (1906) ==Annotations== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * Velika Ho\u010da Category:1905 in the Ottoman Empire Category:1905 in Serbia Category:Conflicts in 1905 Category:Chetniks of the Macedonian Struggle Category:May 1905 events ",
