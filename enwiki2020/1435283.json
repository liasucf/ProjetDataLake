    "text": "\"The Bonnie Blue Flag\", also known as \"We Are a Band of Brothers\", is an 1861 marching song associated with the Confederate States of America. The words were written by the entertainer Harry McCarthy, with the melody taken from the song \"The Irish Jaunting Car\". The song's title refers to the unofficial first flag of the Confederacy, the Bonnie Blue Flag. The left flag on the sheet- music is the Bonnie Blue Flag. The song was premiered by lyricist Harry McCarthy during a concert in Jackson, Mississippi, in the spring of 1861 and performed again in September of that same year at the New Orleans Academy of Music for the First Texas Volunteer Infantry regiment mustering in celebration. The New Orleans music publishing house of A.E. Blackmar issued six editions of \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\" between 1861 and 1864 along with three additional arrangements. The \"band of brothers\" mentioned in the first line of the song recalls the well known St. Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V (Act IV, scene ii). ==Lyrical variations== The Bonnie Blue Flag, the namesake and subject of the song.

Rees The first verse of the song goes: > We are a band of brothers, and native to the soil, Fighting for our liberty > with treasure, blood, and toil; And when our rights were threatened, the cry > rose near and far, Hurrah! for the Bonnie Blue Flag, that bears a single > star. These lyrics appear in a version held by the Library of Congress.https://www.loc.gov/resource/ihas.200002488.0/?sp=1/ It was published by A. E. Blackmar and Brother in New Orleans in 1861. The second line is sometimes given as \"fighting for the property we gained by honest toil.\" University of San Diego professor Steve Schoenherr and the library of Duke University record the \"property\" version which also has a publication date of 1861. When Major General Benjamin Butler captured New Orleans, he allegedly arrested Blackmar,Harwell, Richard B., Confederate Music, p.59 fined him $500, destroyed all copies of the music, and ordered that anyone caught whistling or singing \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\" would be fined $25 (roughly $500 in the 2010s). Eleven other editions of the song were published with different lyrics. Annie Chambers Ketchum, a Confederate widow who risked her liberty to publish new verses to be sung, published a new version of the song under the title \"The Gathering Song.\" The following verses were published in a eulogy by Gilberta S. Whittle in the 1904 Richmond Times Dispatch: > I \"Come, brothers, rally for the right! The bravest of the brave Sends forth > his ringing battle-cray Beside the Atlantic wave. She leads the way in > honor's path: Come, brothers, near and far, Come, rally round the Bonnie > Blue Flag That bears a single star! Hurrah! hurrah! for Southern rights > Hurrah! Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag That bears a single star! II We've > borne the Yankee trickery, The Yankee gibe and sneer, Till Northern > insolence and pride Know neither shame nor fear; But ready now with shot and > steel Their brazen front to mar, We holst aloft the Bonnie Blue Flag That > bears a single star. III Now Georgia marches to the front, And close beside > her come Her sisters of the Mexique sea, With pealing trump and drum; Till > answering back from hill and glen The rallying cry afar, A nation holsts the > Bonnie Blue Flag That bears a single star. IV By every stone in Charleston > Bay, By each beleaguered town, We swear to rest not night nor day, But hunt > the tyrants down; Till bathed in valor's holy blood The gazing world afar > Shall greet with shouts the Bonnie Blue Flag That bears a single star.\" ==Complete lyrics== > 1\\. We are a band of brothers and native to the soil Fighting for our > liberty with treasure, blood, and toil And when our rights were threatened, > the cry rose near and far :Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a > single star! Chorus: :Hurrah! Hurrah! :For Southern rights, hurrah! :Hurrah > for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star. 2\\. As long as the Union > was faithful to her trust Like friends and like brethren, kind were we, and > just But now, when Northern treachery attempts our rights to mar :We hoist > on high the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star. Chorus 3\\. First > gallant South Carolina nobly made the stand Then came Alabama and took her > by the hand Next, quickly Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida :All raised on > high the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star. Chorus 4\\. Ye men of > valor gather round the banner of the right Texas and fair Louisiana join us > in the fight Davis, our loved President, and Stephens statesmen rare :Now > rally round the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star. Chorus 5\\. Now > here's to brave Virginia, the Old Dominion State, With the young Confederacy > at last has sealed her fate, And spurred by her example, now other states > prepare :To hoist high the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star. > (Alternately: Now here's to brave Virginia, the Old Dominion State, Who with > the young Confederacy at length has linked her fate. Impelled by her > example, let other states prepare :To hoist high the Bonnie Blue Flag that > bears a single star.) Chorus 6\\. Then cheer, boys, cheer, raise a joyous > shout For Arkansas and North Carolina now have both gone out, And let > another rousing cheer for Tennessee be given, :The single star of the Bonnie > Blue Flag has grown to be eleven. Chorus 7\\. Then here's to our Confederacy, > strong we are and brave, Like patriots of old we'll fight, our heritage to > save; And rather than submit to shame, to die we would prefer, :So cheer for > the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star. ChorusPatriotic \u2013 the Bonnie > Blue Flag ==Historical inaccuracies== The third verse of the song misstates the order in which the states seceded from the Union. The dates on which the states seceded are as follows: # South Carolina (December 20, 1860) # Mississippi (January 9, 1861) # Florida (January 10, 1861) # Alabama (January 11, 1861) # Georgia (January 19, 1861) # Louisiana (January 26, 1861) # Texas (February 1, 1861) # Virginia (April 17, 1861) # Arkansas (May 6, 1861) # North Carolina (May 20, 1861) # Tennessee (June 8, 1861) Thus, Alabama did not take South Carolina by the hand, but delayed its secession until the departure of Mississippi and Florida. ==Union versions== As with many songs from the time of the American Civil War, this song had multiple versions for both the Union and Confederate sides. One Union version, written by J. L. Geddes, in 1863, a British-born colonel who immigrated to the U.S., was called \"The Bonnie Flag With the Stripes and Stars\". Singing of Unionism and equality, it went: > We're fighting for our Union, We're fighting for our trust, We're fighting > for that happy land Where sleeps our father dust. It cannot be dissevered, > Though it cost us bloody wars, :We never can give up the land :Where floats > the stripes and stars. Chorus: :Hurrah, Hurrah, :For equal rights hurrah, > :Hurrah for the good old flag :That bears the stripes and stars. We trusted > you as brothers, Until you drew the sword, With impious hands at Sumter You > cut the silver cord. So now you hear the bugles, We come the sons of Mars, > :To rally round the brave old flag :That bears the stripes and stars. Chorus > We do not want your cotton, We do not want your slaves, But rather than > divide the land, We'll fill your Southern graves. With Lincoln for our > chieftain, We wear our country's stars, :And rally round the brave old flag > :That bears the stripes and stars. Chorus We deem our cause most holy, We > know we're in the right, And twenty million freemen Stand ready for the > fight. Our pride is fair Columbia, No stain her beauty mars, :On her we'll > raise the brave old flag :That bears the stripes and stars. Chorus And when > this war is over, We'll each resume our home, And treat you still as > brothers, Where ever you may roam. We'll pledge the hand of friendship, And > think no more of war, :But dwell in peace beneath the flag :That bears the > stripes and stars. Chorus Another version went: > We are a band of Patriots who each leave home and friend, Our noble > Constitution and our Banner to defend, Our Capitol was threatened, and the > cry rose near and far, To protect our Country's glorious Flag that glitters > with many a star. Chorus :Hurrah, Hurrah, for the Union, boys Hurrah :Hurrah > for our forefather's Flag, :that glitters with many a star. Much patience > and forbearance, the North has always shown, Toward her Southern brethren, > who had each way their own; But when we made our President\u2014a man whom we > desired, Their wrath was roused, they mounted guns, and on Fort Sumter > fired. They forced the war upon us, for peaceful men are we, They steal our > money, seize our forts, and then as cowards flee, False to their vows, and > to the Flag, that once protected them, They sought the Union to dissolve, > earth's noblest, brightest, gem. We're in the right, and will prevail, the > Stars and Stripes must fly! The \"Bonnie Blue Flag\" will be hauled down and > every traitor die, Freedom and Peace enjoyed by all, as ne'er was known > before, Our spangled Banner wave on high, with stars just Thirty Four Additionally, the Song of the Irish Volunteers, an anthem of the famous 69th New York regiment known as the Irish Brigade, was sung to the same tune.Recording of song. ==In popular culture== * In the 1939 movie Gone with the Wind, Rhett Butler nicknames his child 'Bonnie Blue Butler' after Melanie Hamilton remarks that the child's eyes are as \"blue as the Bonnie Blue flag\". * In the 1956 movie The Searchers, the song playing as John Wayne approaches at the beginning of the film is a slow version of \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\". * In the 1959 movie The Horse Soldiers, \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\" is heard sung in the distance as a Confederate column passes on the other side of a river, and is also played by a company of Mississippi military school cadets, marching out to face the Union cavalry in an effort to delay their progress.
