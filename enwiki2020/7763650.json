These three stages are risk assessment procedures, substantive analytical procedures, and final analytical procedures. * Risk assessment procedures are used to assist the auditor to better understand the business and to plan the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures. * Substantive analytical procedures are used to obtain evidential matter about particular assertions related to account balances or classes of transactions. * Final analytical procedures are used as an overall review of the financial information in the final review stage of the audit. ==Evidence== Analytical procedures include comparison of financial information (data in financial statement) with prior periods, budgets, forecasts, similar industries and so on. It also includes consideration of predictable relationships, such as gross profit to sales, payroll costs to employees, and financial information and non-financial information, for examples the CEO's reports and the industry news.
