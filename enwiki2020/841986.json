The operative word most associated with it is \"innovation\" . Its leading feature is a \"linguistic plurality\", which is to say that no one music genre ever assumed a dominant position . Examples include the celebration of Arnold Schoenberg's rejection of tonality in chromatic post-tonal and twelve-tone works and Igor Stravinsky's move away from metrical rhythm . ==Definitions== Musicologist Carl Dahlhaus describes modernism as: > an obvious point of historical discontinuity ... The \"breakthrough\" of > Mahler, Strauss, and Debussy implies a profound historical transformation > ... If we were to search for a name to convey the breakaway mood of the > 1890s (a mood symbolized musically by the opening bars of Strauss's Don > Juan) but without imposing a fictitious unity of style on the age, we could > do worse than revert to Hermann Bahr's term \"modernism\" and speak of a > stylistically open-ended \"modernist music\" extending (with some latitude) > from 1890 to the beginnings of our own twentieth-century modern music in > 1910. Eero Tarasti defines musical modernism directly in terms of \"the dissolution of the traditional tonality and transformation of the very foundations of tonal language, searching for new models in atonalism, polytonalism or other forms of altered tonality\", which took place around the turn of the century . Daniel Albright proposes a definition of musical modernism as, \"a testing of the limits of aesthetic construction\" and presents the following modernist techniques or styles : *Expressionism *New Objectivity *Hyperrealism *Abstractionism *Neoclassicism *Neobarbarism (formless energy) *Futurism *Mythic method (cultivation of the prehistoric past) ==Periodization== Some writers regard musical modernism as an historical period or era extending from about 1890 to 1930, and apply the term \"postmodernism\" to the period or era after 1930 (; ). For Dahlhaus (quoted above), the purest form was over by 1910, but other historians consider modernism to end with one or the other of the two world wars . Other writers assert that modernism is not attached to any historical period, but rather is \"an attitude of the composer; a living construct that can evolve with the times\" . ==Jazz== According to jazz drummer and bandleader Kenny Clarke, bebop was initially referred to as \"modern jazz\" by himself and his contemporaries before it was co-opted to the name \"bebop\" by other writers . ==Popular music== Cultural studies professor Andrew Goodwin writes that \"given the confusion of the terms, the identification of postmodern texts has ranged across an extraordinarily divergent, and incoherent profusion of textual instances ... Secondly, there are debates within popular music about pastiche and authenticity. 'Modernism' means something quite different within each of these two fields ... This confusion is obvious in an early formative attempt to understand rock music in postmodern terms\" . Goodwin argues that instances of modernism in popular music are generally not cited because \"it undermines the postmodern thesis of cultural fusion, in its explicit effort to preserve a bourgeois notion of Art in opposition to mainstream, 'commercial' rock and pop\" . Modernism in popular music had been named as early as the late 1950s when burgeoning Los Angeles rock and roll radio station KRLA started dubbing their air space \"Modern Radio/Los Angeles\". Author Domenic Priore believes that: \"the concept of Modernism was bound up in the very construction of the Greater Los Angeles area, at a time when the city was just beginning to come into its own as an international, cultural center\" . Some examples which soon followed include the elaborately arranged \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\" by Ike & Tina Turner (1966) and \"Good Vibrations\" by the Beach Boys (1966). Desiring \"a taste of Modern, avant-garde R&B;\" for the latter's recording, group member and song co-writer Brian Wilson considered the music \"advanced rhythm and blues\", but received criticism from his bandmates, who derided the track for being \"too Modern\" during its making . Art rock and progressive rock artists such as the Velvet Underground, Henry Cow, Soft Machine, and Hatfield and the North would later exhibit modernist aspirations , although Goodwin posits that progressive rock should be considered \"anathema\" to postmodernism . ==See also== * Avant- garde music * Experimental music * Internet Archive * History of music *List of modernist composers * Musopen * Neoconservative postmodernism * Open Goldberg Variations * Philosophy of music * Public domain music * Surrealist music ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * Cited in The Pleasure of Modernist Music, edited by, Arved Ashby, 146 n13.
