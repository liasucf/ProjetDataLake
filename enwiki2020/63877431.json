    "text": "The Ulysses S. Grant Cottage was the Summer White House of U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant in Elberon, a part of Long Branch, New Jersey. Grant vacationed at the cottage starting in the summer of 1867, and thereafter spent three months of every summer there until 1885. He held cabinet meetings and composed parts of his memoirs at the cottage. The presence of Grant and the cottage helped popularize Elberon as a place for the elite to meet; a status that only faded when the railroad came to town and it became more accessible. The cottage was demolished in 1963 by its then owner, who did not possess the funds necessary to preserve the building. The site is today a grassy field. == History == Ulysses S. Grant with wife Julia and children Nellie, Jesse, Ulysses Jr. and Frederick relaxing at the cottage in 1870. Ulysses S. Grant received the cottage as a gift from wealthy acquaintances aligned with the Republican Party who had summer homes in Elberon, New Jersey. These homes, being within walking distance of each other, provided an atmosphere conducive to achieving a meeting of the minds as it pertained to the issues of the day.Khederian, Robert (July 13, 2017) \"Elberon, the High-profile Gilded Age Resort You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\", Curbed.
