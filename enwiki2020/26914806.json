    "text": "The SAIFAM Group is the biggest Italian record label and production company featuring hardstyle, Italo dance, Eurodance, Hi-NRG, pop and fitness music genres. ==History== The outfit was started by Mauro Farina and Giuliano Crivellente, a production duo who produced more than 1,000 tracks, selling over ten million albums worldwide. In 1981, they created the Factory Sound Studio and the SAIFAM Group. The pair have been recognized as founders of HI- NRG, the genre in which they achieved their first gold records, thanks largely to localized translations of their songs in the Asian market. In the early 1990s, their hits included \"What's Up\" by DJ Miko, \"Moments in Soul\" by JT and the Big Family, and \"Venus\" by Don Pablo's Animals, which entered the European and American charts. Since the mid 1990s, thanks to the birth of the Arsenic Sound division of their company, other hits are being produced such as the Zombie Nation Remix which entered the official charts in Europe, America and Asia. Perhaps their greatest international success came in 1998 with the dance track \"Free\" by female duo Bacon Popper. The 2000s saw releases \"La Follia\" by DJ Frederik, as well as Italian Hip Hop records from Club Dogo, Mondo Marcio, and Fabri Fibra on the Italian National Indies Sales Charts. In 2007, the track \u201cCream\u201d by Federico Franchi entered several international charts, selling over 100,000 units. In 2008-2009, the track \u201cKraze\u201d by Pitbull (with SAIFAM as co-publishers and co-masters owner) entered the US charts, selling more than 600,000 units (physical and downloads) and Simone Farina with the band Desaparecidos produced the tracks \u201cIbiza\u201d and \u201cFiesta Loca\u201d which entered several international charts and each sold over 100,000 units. In 2013, \"Deep in love\" by Tom Boxer reached platinum sales status in Italy. Technoboy and Tuneboy (when they collaborate they produce as Technoboy N' Tuneboy, or TNT for short) are among the earliest if not the very first pioneers of the Hardstyle genre, even to this day they are still considered legendary and without a doubt they made SAIFAM a globally recognised name in the hardstyle scene. They especially have very large fanbases in the countries of Italy, Nederlands, Australia, and Malaysia. They are greatly respected in the hardstyle scene, and some of the big names in the hardstyle scene such as Headhunterz have also cited them as major inspirations and people they look up to. ==References== ==External links== *SAIFAM on Discogs Category:Italian record labels Category:Electronic dance music record labels ",
