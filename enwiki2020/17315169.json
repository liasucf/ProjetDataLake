    "text": "Nicolae Constantin (born 9 December 1973 in Bucure\u015fti) is a retired Romanian footballer. He spent most of his playing career with his childhood club, Petrolul Ploiesti, and also at FC Rapid Bucuresti. He played mainly as a central defender, but could also go as a center forward. Although uncapped by Romania, he has been regarded as one of the best Romanian central defenders of his generation, since he was a very determined and hard-working man. Nae Constantin retired at the end of the 2010\u20132011 season, last playing for second-tier club Chimia Brazi. ==Career== Nae Constantin started his playing career with Victoria Flore\u0219ti, a local club in his home county of Prahova. After one season he made the big step to Prahova's biggest club, Petrolul Ploiesti. Despite being a central defender, he would go often up front and score goals for his team, as he proved so while loaned at AS Ploie\u0219ti, where he scored 6 goals in 21 games. He continued his good goalscoring statistics at Petrolul, where he managed 7 goals in 69 matches. In 2000, he switched to Romanian giants Rapid Bucure\u0219ti. Despite being loaned out several times to Electromagnetica, Astra Ploiesti and his previous club Petrolul Ploiesti, he was a main figure in his later years in Bucharest. Following R\u0103zvan Lucescu's resignation at Rapid, with whom he had a great partnership, he secured a transfer to Cypriot club Digenis Akritas Morphou. He only wore Digenis' jersey 7 times, as he returned quickly to his home country to join Lucescu and many more ex-Rapid players at FC Bra\u0219ov, following a mass exodus from the Bucharest club. Reunited with his former coach and teammates, he enjoyed playing 3 seasons with in Brasov, before joining for the 2010\u201311 season what proved to be his last club, Chimia Brazi. Nae Constantin was an important figure for the club, who missed out promotion to Liga II by only two points. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Rapid Bucure\u0219ti * Romanian League Championship: 2002\u201303 * Romanian Cup: 2001\u201302, 2005\u201306, 2006\u201307 ;FC Bra\u015fov *Romanian Second League: 2007\u201308 ==External links== * Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Romanian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Liga I players Category:Cypriot First Division players Category:SR Bra\u0219ov players Category:FC Astra Giurgiu players Category:FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti players Category:FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti players Category:Digenis Akritas Morphou FC players Category:Romanian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Cyprus Category:Romanian expatriate sportspeople in Cyprus Category:Romanian football managers Category:ACSF Comuna Recea managers ",
