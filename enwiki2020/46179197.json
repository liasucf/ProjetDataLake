The garden occupies an area of 3,000m2 and is bounded by Boundary Street, Embankment Road, Prince Edward Road West and Yuen Po Street.Leisure and Cultural Services Department: Yuen Po Street Bird Garden ==History== The garden was established after the former \"Bird Street\" at Hong Lok Street (\u96c0\u4ed4\u8857), off Argyle Street, was demolished by the former Land Development Corporation (now the Urban Renewal Authority) in the early 1990s. Langham Place was built on the site of the former Bird Street. Construction of the replacement garden was completed in March 1997 on a more peripheral site. The market was closed on 5 July 2012, following a positive swab sample of H5N1 avian influenza virus, from a bird cage of oriental magpie-robins. It was closed for 21 days and re-opened on 26 July. Each of the 69 affected shops were compensated with HK$12,000 and their rents waived for a month by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Mong Kok Category:Retail markets in Hong Kong Category:Urban public parks and gardens in Hong Kong ",
