    "text": "Embarcadero station is a combined BART and Muni Metro rapid transit station in the Market Street subway. Located under Market Street between Drumm Street and Beale Street near The Embarcadero, it serves the Financial District neighborhood and surrounding areas. The three-level station has a large fare mezzanine level, with separate platform levels for Muni Metro and BART below. Embarcadero opened in May 1976 \u2013 almost two years after service began through the Transbay Tube \u2013 as an infill station. With over 42,000 daily passenger entrances on weekdays, Embarcadero and Montgomery Street stations are the two busiest in the BART system. A major Bay Area transit hub, Embarcadero is also served by numerous bus routes of several other agencies which stop above the station and on surrounding streets. ==History== A Muni Metro train at Embarcadero in 1993 Service at the station began on May 27, 1976, three years after the other San Francisco stations. The station was not part of the original plans for the system. As a result of increasing development in the lower Market Street area, the basic structure of the station was added into the construction of the Market Street subway, anticipating a later opening. The later opening resulted in the Embarcadero station having a much different design than the other three Market Street stations. The station was designed by chief BART architect Tallie Maule and Hertzka & Knowles & Associates in collaboration with Parsons Brinckerhoff, Tudor Construction, and Bechtel. The station cost $30 million to construct. Muni Metro service began in February 1980 and Embarcadero was originally intended to be the inbound terminus for all of the Muni Metro lines. In 1998 a new southward extension was opened along the Embarcadero and to the Caltrain station at 4th and King Streets; however, several Muni Metro lines continue to terminate at Embarcadero. On March 4, 2000, F Market & Wharves streetcar service was extended northward to Fisherman's Wharf, with new stops above Embarcadero station at Main Street (inbound) and Drumm Street (outbound). Because the station is adjacent to the Transbay Tube, brake dust and other particles from train operations coat the walls of the station. A sandblasting in 2014 revealed the original white terrazzo platform walls under the dark grime. Since before 1992, the station was serenaded by Ronald Brewington, known as the \"Jazz Man\". He would play saxophone for commuters, and entertain them with conversation and charm. He claimed his name was Garrick Sherrod; however, that was an identity he had stolen. The Jazz Man was actually a fugitive from Albuquerque facing capital murder charges stemming from the 1987 death of his wife Diedre. He was arrested at a BART station in 2012, and extradited to New Mexico. In 2013, he pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. ===Artwork=== The bottom part of Wall Canyon Although original plans to include public art at every BART station did not come to fruition, several artworks were included in Embarcadero station. The platform walls and street entrances feature circle-based reliefs by William Mitchell. Wall Canyon, a -high colored ceramic relief by Stephen De Staebler, is partially hidden behind a staircase at the southwest end of the station. It was installed on January 1, 1977. A duotone granite portrait of Tallie Maule \u2013 the chief architect of the original BART system \u2013 is on the mezzanine level. A -tall, rope sculpture called Legs was installed at the northwest end of the station in 1976 or 1978. Created by Barbara Shawcroft, the orange-and-white Nomex sculpture moved with the breeze from passing Muni and BART trains. Legs soon accumulated the same dark grime as the station walls, hiding the original color. BART was required by the artist's contract to clean the sculpture but several attempts were unsuccessful. In 2013, BART included removal of Legs in its 2014 budget, which prompted a debate about whether it should be cleaned regardless of cost (which Shawcroft supported), or removed from the unsuitable environment of the station. The sculpture was removed in June 2014 and returned to Shawcroft \u2013 a professor emerita at UC Davis School of Design \u2013 who planned to repurpose it into other pieces. ==Station layout== One of the six station entrances Like the three other shared Muni/BART stations in the Market Street subway, Embarcadero has three underground levels. The uppermost level is a fare mezzanine, with one Muni paid area in the middle flanked by two BART paid areas. The second level has a single island platform (of which only the center portion is used) for Muni Metro, and the third level has an island platform for BART. The station is narrower than the other three \u2013 rather than \u2013 because of adjacent buildings and the high water table. It has six street entrances along its length. The station contains an unused underground entrance to the 388 Market Street building. Following the 2015 addition of a canopy over an escalator at 19th Street Oakland station, which reduced escalator downtime by one-third, BART decided to add canopies to all downtown Oakland and San Francisco entrances. Construction of the Market Street entrances will begin in 2020, with completion in 2027. ==Connections== Market and Drumm with the station entrances in the center and top left. An F Market & Wharves streetcar is running inbound on Market Street (left, just above center) and a cable car waits in the pinch tracks (lower right). Embarcadero station is located in the busy Financial District; numerous routes by several transit providers stop at or near the station. Most radial Muni bus routes terminate at several nearby locations: :*Ferry Plaza: , , , , , , , , :*Transbay Transit Center, with intermediate stops on Market Street near Embarcadero: , , , , :*Richmond express terminal at Davis Street and Pine Street: , , , , , Other Muni routes that stop or terminate near the station include routes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . The California Street line of the San Francisco cable car system terminates adjacent to the Drumm Street station entrance.

A number of Golden Gate Transit bus routes stop near Embarcadero on Fremont Street (2, 4, 38, 44, 54, 56, 58, 72, 72X, 74, 76) and/or Pine Street (2, 4, 8, 18, 24, 24X). Other transit agencies that stop nearby include SamTrans (292, 397, 398, 713, FCX), PresidiGo (Downtown Shuttle), and Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach. Embarcadero station is the nearest Muni Metro and BART station to the Ferry Building, the primary San Francisco terminal for Golden Gate Ferry and San Francisco Bay Ferry. The Transbay Transit Center, located about to the south, is the primary San Francisco terminal for AC Transit transbay routes, WestCAT, Greyhound Lines, Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach buses, some Golden Gate Transit routes, and Muni route . The second phase of the Transbay Transit Center \u2013 the Downtown Rail Extension \u2013 will include an -long pedestrian tunnel under Beale Street connecting Embarcadero station with the underground rail concourse. ==References== ==External links== *BART: Embarcadero station *SFMTA: Embarcadero inbound, outbound *SF Bay Transit (unofficial): MUNI Metro Embarcadero Station, Embarcadero BART station Category:Bay Area Rapid Transit stations in San Francisco Category:Muni Metro stations Category:Financial District, San Francisco Category:Market Street (San Francisco) Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1976 Category:United States bike stations Category:Railway stations located underground in California ",
