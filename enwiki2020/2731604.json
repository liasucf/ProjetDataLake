    "text": "Location of Biscoe Islands in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Pitt Islands is a group of small islands lying immediately off the N extremity of Renaud Island, at the N end of the Biscoe Islands. The name \"Pitt's Island,\" for William Pitt, British statesman, was applied by John Biscoe in 1832 to an island which he erroneously charted as lying about 25 miles West North West of these islands. The present application of Pitt Islands is based on the interpretation of the BGLE under Rymill, who charted the island group in 1935\u201336.
