    "text": "David Popper Hubay-Popper-Quartett in 1898 David Popper (June 16, 1843 \u2013 August 7, 1913) was a Bohemian cellist and composer. Some other sources list his date of birth as December 9, 1843. ==Life== Popper was born in Prague, and studied music at the Prague Conservatory. His family was Jewish.Steven Beller, Vienna and the Jews, 1867-1938: A Cultural History, Cambridge University Press (1990), p. 25Evan Burr Bukey, Jews and Intermarriage in Nazi Austria, Cambridge University Press (2010), pp. 7\u20138 He studied the cello under Julius Goltermann (1825\u20131876), and soon attracted attention. He made his first tour in 1863; in Germany he was praised by Hans von B\u00fclow, son-in-law of Franz Liszt, who recommended him as Chamber Virtuoso in the court of Prince von Hohenzollern-Hechingen in L\u00f6wenberg. In 1864, he premiered Robert Volkmann's Cello Concerto in A minor, Op. 33, with Hans von B\u00fclow conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. He lost this job a couple of years later due to the prince's death. He made his debut in Vienna in 1867, and was made principal cellist at the Hofoper. From 1868 to 1870 he was also a member of the Hellmesberger Quartet.Potter, The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet, p.44 In 1872, he married pianist Sophie Menter, a pupil of Liszt. She later joined the staff at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. In 1873, Popper resigned from his post at the Hofoper so as to continue his tours with his wife on a larger scale, giving concerts throughout Europe. Popper's and Menter's marriage was dissolved in 1886. That year, Liszt recommended Popper for a teaching position at the newly opened string department at the Conservatory at Budapest. In Budapest, he participated in the Budapest Quartet with Jen\u0151 Hubay.Campbell, The Cambridge Companion to the Cello, p. 71 He and Hubay performed chamber music on more than one occasion with Johannes Brahms, including the premiere of Brahms's Piano Trio No. 3 in Budapest, on December 20, 1886.Clive, Brahms and His World:A Biographical Dictionary, p. xxvii, xxviii,xxix Popper died in Baden, near Vienna. Among his notable students were Arnold F\u00f6ldesy, Jen\u0151 Kerpely, Mici Luk\u00e1cs, Ludwig Lebell and Adolf Schiffer (teacher of J\u00e1nos Starker). David Popper was one of the last great cellists who did not use an endpin. An 1880 drawing of Popper playing in a string quartet shows that although he started his cello career without using an endpin, he adopted it later in his life. ==Works== Popper was a prolific composer of cello music, writing four concertos, a Requiem for three cellos and orchestra (1891) and a number of smaller pieces which are still played today, including the solo piece Tarantella. His shorter showpieces were written to highlight the unique sound and style of the cello, extending the instrument's range with pieces such as Spinnlied (Spinning Song), Elfentanz (Dance of the Elves), or the Ungarische Rhapsodie (Hungarian Rhapsody), which was published by the Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag.Auff\u00fchrungstermine Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag 2011 He also wrote instructional pieces. Popper is also known for his High School of Cello Playing (Op. 73), a book of cello \u00e9tudes that is widely used by advanced cello students. An old edition of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians described him thus: \"His tone is large and full of sentiment; his execution highly finished, and his style classical.\" *Op. 2, Five Songs for Soprano *Op. 3, Scenes From a Masked Ball, cello and piano ** No. 1, Arlequin (Harlequin) in F Major ** No. 2, Warum?
