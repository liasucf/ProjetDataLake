    "text": "Ch\u1ebf Lan Vi\u00ean (October 20, 1920 \u2013 June 24, 1989) was a Vietnamese poet. He was born Phan Ng\u1ecdc Hoan, in \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0, in Central Vietnam. He grew up in Quy Nh\u01a1n further south, and started writing poetry at an early age. His first collection, published when he was seventeen, gained him notice as a poet of original, if morose, sensibilities. He participated in the events of the August Revolution of 1945, in the Quy Nh\u01a1n area. Afterwards, he wrote for a number of journals, including Quy\u1ebft Th\u1eafng (Resolve to Win) in support of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh's movement against French rule. After the Geneva Agreements of 1954, Ch\u1ebf Lan Vi\u00ean returned to H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, taking on responsibilities as a leading member of the Writers' Association of Viet Nam (H\u1ed9i Nh\u00e0 V\u0103n Vi\u1ec7t Nam). After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Ch\u1ebf Lan Vi\u00ean lived and worked in H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City (formerly S\u00e0i G\u00f2n). A prolific writer, he remained active in the literary scene, producing poetry, essays, memoirs, and commentary and criticism until his death in 1989. He was married to the novelist, V\u0169 Th\u1ecb Th\u01b0\u1eddng; their daughter, Phan Thi Vang-Anh, is a writer as well. ==Poetry== Ch\u1ebf Lan Vi\u00ean was associated with the B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Group of poets, whose other members were Qu\u00e1ch T\u1ea5n, H\u00e0n M\u1eb7c T\u1eed, and Y\u1ebfn Lan. The preface to his first collection, \u0110i\u00eau T\u00e0n, was also a statement of the aesthetics of the \"Disordered\" (Lo\u1ea1n), also known as \"Mad\" (\u0110i\u00ean), school of poetry. The poems in that volume are marked by ghastly, even demonic, subjects and imagery. Ch\u1ebf Lan Vi\u00ean was ethnic Ch\u00e0m (or Giao Ch\u1ec9) by birth, and the ruins referred to in the title are those of the extinct Ch\u00e0m Kingdom. The poems are haunted by catastrophe, by death and killings, and by memories of a lost past. Note: \"Giao Chi\" is not a Cham ethnic group. Giao Chi (Jiaozhi in Chinese) is the ancient name of northern Vietnam during the period of early Chinese domination of Vietnam. Che Lan Vien was born a Phan (Vietnamese) in Cam An Village, Cam Lo District, Quang Tri Province in 1920. He grew up in Quy Nhon (Binh Dinh Province) where there are many Cham ruins in the province, including the capital Do-Ban (Vijaya). Like many poets his time, Phan Ngoc Hoan decided to take up a pen name for his first published work. So, at the age of 17 Phan Ngoc Hoan, now known as Che Lan Vien (\"Che\" is a well-known Vietnamese surname of Cham ethnic origin) published Dieu Tan (Ruins) in 1937. Unlike Che Linh (Jamlen), who is Vietnamese of Cham ethnicity from Ninh Thuan Province, Che Lan Vien (Phan Ngoc Hoan) was not of ethnic Cham origin. His poetry during the war period was highly journalistic and heavily colored with nationalist sentiments. After the war, his writings reflected a return to normalcy, remembering the past and commenting on the realities of everyday living. ==Bibliography== ===Poetry=== *\u0110i\u00eau T\u00e0n (Ruins) 1937 *G\u1eedi C\u00e1c Anh (To My Brothers) 1954 *\u00c1nh S\u00e1ng v\u00e0 Ph\u00f9 Sa (Silt Sand and Light) 1960 *Hoa Ng\u00e0y Th\u01b0\u1eddng \u2013 Chim B\u00e1o B\u00e3o (Ordinary Flowers \u2013 The Storm-Omening Bird) 1967 *Nh\u1eefng b\u00e0i th\u01a1 \u0111\u00e1nh gi\u1eb7c (Poems To Fight the Enemy) 1972 *\u0110\u1ed1i tho\u1ea1i m\u1edbi (New Conversations) 1973 *Hoa Tr\u01b0\u1edbc L\u0103ng Ng\u01b0\u1eddi (Flowers Before a Monument) 1976 *H\u00e1i theo m\u00f9a (Picking According to the Season) 1977 *Hoa Tr\u00ean \u0111\u00e1 (Flowers Above the Rocks) 1985 *Di C\u1ea3o (Posthumous works) I (1994) & II (1995) ===Prose (partial)=== *V\u00e0ng Sao (The Yellow Star) 1942 *Th\u0103m Trung Qu\u1ed1c (Visit to China) 1963 *Nh\u1eefng Ng\u00e0y N\u1ed5i Gi\u1eadn (Days of Wrath) 1966 *Gi\u1edd c\u1ee7a \u0111\u00f4 th\u00e0nh (City Hours) 1977 == References == == External links== Category:Vietnamese male poets Category:1920 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:20th-century Vietnamese poets Category:20th-century male writers ",
