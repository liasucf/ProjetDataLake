    "text": "Advanced Sports International is an American bicycle company whose flagship brand is Fuji Bikes. It also owns smaller brands including triathlon-focused Kestrel USA, component maker Oval Concepts, Breezer bikes, and BMX maker SE Bikes. It is headquartered in Philadelphia and led by Patrick Cunnane. It has generally followed a strategy of buying struggling brands and returning them to profitability. It bought Fuji Bikes in 1998 after Fuji's sales had declined due to missing the mountain biking boom. It soon repositioned the brand from a mass-market brand sold mainly in sporting goods stores to a higher-end brand sold by more independent bicycle dealers. It bought Breezer Bikes in 2008, Oval Concepts in 2009, and Phat Cycles in 2015. In August 2016, it purchased the bicycle retailer Performance Bicycle. In 2007, the company's total revenue was $50 million, with about 5% market share among bikes sold by independent dealers. By 2015, that had grown to $105 million. It is associated with the Taiwanese bicycle manufacturer Ideal Bike Corp. Advanced Sports International filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 16, 2018. All Performance Bike stores are closing. On February 1, 2019, the Tiger Group won ASI at auction. == References == ==External links== * Category:Bicycle framebuilders Category:Companies based in Philadelphia Category:Privately held companies of the United States Category:Cycle manufacturers of the United States ",
