Robert Abele of Los Angeles Times wrote \"It\u2019s become a hallmark of the documentary/fiction hybrid that the realism on display feels both lived-in and poetic, and that\u2019s in De Sousa\u2019s face as well, which \u2014 like the obliquely titled \u201cAraby\u201d as it shuffles along to its unexpected, reflective conclusion \u2014 always registers a powerful synthesis of sensitivity and weariness.\"Glenn Kenny of The New York Times wrote, \" ...thanks to Mr. de Sousa\u2019s superb performance, the movie often convincingly portrays not just the exploited condition of laborers such as Cristiano, but the nagging sadness of life itself.\" == References == == External links == * Category:2017 films Category:Portuguese-language films Category:Brazilian films ",
