    "text": "Europe-Jeunesse is a French neo-pagan scouting organization established in 1973 and influenced by Nouvelle Droite values. == History == After a meeting in December 1972 between GRECE members Jean Mabire, Maurice Rollet and Jean- Claude Valla to discuss the creation of a pagan scouting organization, Europe- Jeunesse held its first camp in Bussy-en-Othe in July 1973, under the supervision of Raymond Ferrand, a former member of Europe-Action. Europe- Jeunesse is an attempt at a synthesis between the early French scouting movement of Nicolas Benoit (1875\u20131914), and the pre-Nazi German Youth Movement. The organization has adopted the symbol of Europe-Action and the FEN, a hoplite helmet. Europe-Jeunesse is made up of ten ethno-cultural \"bans\": \"Gallia Belgica\" for Wallonia, \"Liguerie\" for the Nice region, \"Blood and Gold\" around N\u00eemes, \"Armed-Lions\" in the P\u00e9rigord, \"Alpine\" around Lyon and Grenoble, \"An Avel Mor\" in Brittany, \"Comt\u00e9 Toulousain\", \"\u00cele-de-France\", \"Alsace\" and \"Normandie\". Each group is led by around sixty people in ma\u00eetrises (supervisory staffs), and activities follow natural pagan rhythms: the equinox, the solstice, the gathering of mistletoe, a camp for the Celtic Festival of Samhain, etc. == Members == Yvan Benedetti was a member of Europe- Jeunesse in his youth, as were the children of Jean-Yves Le Gallou. == References == === Bibliography === * * * Category:Scouting and Guiding in France Category:Youth organizations established in 1973 Category:Pan-European nationalism Category:1973 establishments in France Category:Neopagan organizations based in France Category:New Right (Europe) Category:Religious organizations established in 1973 ",
