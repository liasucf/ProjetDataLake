He excelled in the parts of Tsar Fyodor in Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich by Alexey K. Tolstoy (1935), Karenin in Anna Karenina (1937), Tuzenbach in Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov (1940), but before that as Alexey Turbin in The Days of the Turbins by Mikhail Bulgakov, which brought him critical recognition and fame in 1926.\u0425\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0451\u0432, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 at the Krugosvet Online Encyclopedia \"Khmelyov imparted his characters with extreme tension and clarity\u2026 His stage moves were both highly elaborate and unexpected, he was totally free in his choice of stylistic means and emotional colours, and he loved the sudden change of perspectives,\" Solovyova wrote. His Karenin and Turbin were lavishly praised by Iosif Stalin who, upon seeing MAT's Anna Karenina in 1937, instantly issued an order for Khmelyov and Alla Tarasova to be awarded the titles of the People's Artist of the USSR. A respected pedagogue, in 1932 Khmelyov founded his own theatre studio. In 1937 it merged with Yermolova Theatre, which he was the director of in 1937\u20131945. In 1920\u20131939 he was cast in seven Soviet films, including Salamander (1928), Bezhin Meadow (1937) and The Man in a Case (1939). Khmelyov was a recipient of numerous state awards (including the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, 1937) and a three times Stalin Prize laureate (1941, 1942 and 1946, posthumously). Khmelyov died on 1 November 1945 in the theatre, during the rehearsals for Hard Days by Alexey N. Tolstoy in which he played Ivan the Terrible. He is interred in Novodevichy Cemetery. == Filmography == * 1920 - Domestic Agitator \u2013 Groom * 1927 - The End of St. Petersburg \u2013 speculator * 1928 - Salamander \u2013 Prince Ruprecht Karlstein * 1932 - Dead House \u2013 Dostoevsky * 1936 - Generation of Winners \u2013 Evgeny Svetlov * 1936 - Bezhin Meadow \u2013 father Styopka * 1939 - The Man in a Case \u2013 Belikov == References == Category:People from Nizhny Novgorod Category:1901 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Soviet male film actors ",
