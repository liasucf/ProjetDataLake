    "text": "Gamtec () is a video game developer established in June 1989 and based in Taichung City, Taiwan noted for its unlicensed Sega Mega Drive games such as Legend of Wukong and Squirrel King. His motto would have to be: Believe in yourself (). The company also developed a number of NES and PC games, and claims to have developed for the Gamate, Super A'Can, Arcade, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, although it often acted as a contract developer for other companies so is frequently not credited in games it worked on. ==Games== Games in this list, unless otherwise specified, are those that explicitly credit Gamtec. Because the company is a contract developer, it may have helped develop other titles in which its name does not appear, such as those for the Bit Corporation Gamate handheld system. ===Nintendo Entertainment System=== * Fire Dragon [AKA Hu\u01d2l\u00f3ng] * King Tank [AKA Taan Hak Fung Wan] (1993) * Thunderbolt II [AKA L\u00e9i Di\u0101n II - Thunderbolt Fighting Plane] (1993) * The Universe Soldiers (1993) * Wisdom Boy (co-developed with Sun Team) ===Sega Mega Drive=== * 16 Tile Mahjong16 Zhang Mahjong [AKA 16 Zhang Mahjong (Sh\u00edli\u00f9 Zh\u0101ng M\u00e1ji\u00e0ng)] * 16 Tile Mahjong IIGM-95: The Series [AKA 16 Zhang Mahjong II (Sh\u00edli\u00f9 Zh\u0101ng M\u00e1ji\u00e0ng II)] * Adventurous Boy [AKA Adventure Kid (M\u00e0oxi\u01cen Xi\u01ceozi)]\\ * Super Mario Bros. 2 (Mega Drive) [AKA Sonic Jam 6] Sonic Retro Sonic Jam 6 (unconfirmed) * Bomboy [AKA Explosion Kid (B\u00e0ozh\u00e0 Xi\u01ceozi)] (1993) * Ch\u0101oj\u00ed D\u00e0 F\u00f9w\u0113ng * Legend of Wukong [AKA Wukong Rumors (W\u00f9k\u014dng W\u00e0izhu\u00e0n)] (1996; 2008: English version developed by Super Fighter Team) * The Lion King 2 [AKA Sh\u012bziw\u00e1ng II] * Magic 7 Block [AKA Variety Tangram (B\u01cei Bi\u00e0n Q\u012bqi\u01ceob\u01cen)] * Magic Girl [AKA Little Witch (Xi\u01ceo M\u00f3n\u01da)] (1993) * M\u00e8nghu\u00e0n Shu\u01d0gu\u01d2 P\u00e1n: 777 CasinoMeng Huan Shui Guo Pan: 777 Casino * Squirrel King (1995)Squirrel King for Genesis - GameFAQs * Super Bubble Bobble MDSuper Bubble Bobble MD - Sega Retro * Super Magician [AKA Elf Wor, and Spiritual Magic Priest (L\u00edng Hu\u00e0n D\u00e0oshi)] * Super Tank War * Thunderbolt II [AKA L\u00e9i Di\u0101n II - Thunderbolt Fighting Plane] (1995) * Tiny Toon Adventures 3 (1996)Tiny Toon Adventures 3 - Sega Retro Note: The Mega Drive title The Lion King 2 is credited as Lion King II on title screen. ====Accessories==== * Magicard cheat cartridge ==See also== * Thin Chen Enterprise - another Taiwanese console game developer ==References== ==External links== * Bingo King (Chinese) * Gamtec at Sega Retro Category:Video game development companies Category:Defunct video game companies of Taiwan ",
