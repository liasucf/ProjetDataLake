The following restrictions apply: * Onset ** First consonant (C1): Can be any consonant, including a liquid (). ** Second consonant (C2): Can be any consonant. (see #Consonant Clusters below) * Nucleus ** Semivowel (S1) ** Vowel (V) ** Semivowel (S2) * Coda ** First consonant (C3): Can be any consonant ** Second consonant (C4): Can be any consonant ===Consonant clusters=== Pashto also has a liking for word-initial consonant clusters in all dialects; some hundred such clusters occurs. However consonant gemination is unknown to Pashto. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! !!
