It enables users to get a portion of their cash back when making a purchase online or in-store at over 1,400 retailers. Cashrewards is partnered with over 1,400 brands, including Amazon, Myer, David Jones, Groupon, Coles, Agoda, Lenovo, Apple, Microsoft and Booking.com. Each participating partner pays a commission to Cashrewards, which is then shared with its members as a cashback offer. In the first five years the company has been operating, Cashrewards has generated A$2 billion in revenue for its partners, and A$100 million as cashback to its members. In addition to offering cashback, Cashrewards also features a selection of discount coupons and exclusive deal codes. == History == Cashrewards was founded in 2014 by Andrew and Lorica Clarke after their son developed and survived a serious illness. Seeking a way to give back to those who supported them during this time, they set up Cashrewards as a business which aims to benefit consumers while also contributing to charitable organisations. In 2017, Cashrewards joined the Salesforce charity initiative Pledge 1%, where one percent of the company's equity and one percent of cashback rewards are donated to a selected charity. Founders Andrew & Lorica chose the Starlight Children\u2019s Foundation due to the support this organisation provided to their son while he was battling his illness. In 2018, Cashrewards launched its In-Store Offers platform. Partnering with Visa, the platform allows members with a Visa credit card or debit card to earn cashback at hundreds of stores throughout Australia. In 2019, Cashrewards founder Andrew Clarke stated that the company seeks to achieve an initial public offering (IPO) by 2020. October 2019 also saw Cashrewards expand its In-Store Offers platform by partnering with Mastercard, allowing members using this payment card provider to access cashback benefits from participating retailers. == Funding == In 2018, Cashrewards secured A$3 million in capital from Silicon Valley-based Partners for Growth (PFG) through a tailored debt funding facility. In 2019, it acquired an additional A$5.25 million external equity funding round from Sydney-based Alium Capital. == Awards and accolades == |- | 2016 | Finalist: Best Fintech Startup | StartCon | | Australasian Startup Awards 2016 | |- | 2016 | Deloitte Tech Fast 50 Awards Australia | Deloitte | | Deloitte Technology Fast 500 2016 | |- | 2017 | Finalist: E-commerce Company of the Year | StartCon | | Australasian Startup Awards 2017 | |- | 2017 | Finalist: NSW Region | Telstra | | Telstra Business Awards 2017 | |- | 2017 | Finalist: Eastern Region | Ernst & Young (EY) | | Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year Award 2017 | |- | 2017 | Smart50 List (4th Place) | SmartCompany | | Smart50 Awards 2017 | |- | 2017 | Finalist: Corporate Social Responsibility Program of the Year | Optus & MyBusiness | | Optus My Business Awards 2017 | |- | 2017 | Media, Marketing and Advertising Business of the Year | Optus & MyBusiness | | Optus My Business Awards 2017 | |- | 2017 | Finalist: Deloitte Tech Fast 50 Awards Australia | Deloitte | | Deloitte Technology Fast 500 2017 | |- | 2017 | Businesses of Tomorrow Award | Westpac | | Westpac Businesses of Tomorrow 2017 | |- | 2018 | Fast 100 List (6th Place) | The Australian Financial Review | | Financial Review Fast 100 2018 | == References == == External links == * Category:Cashback and rebate Category:Online grocers Category:Online retailers of Australia ",
