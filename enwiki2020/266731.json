    "text": "50 euro cent coin made out of Nordic Gold. Nordic Gold (Swedish: nordiskt guld) is the gold-coloured copper alloy from which many coins are made. It had been in use for a number of coins in many currencies, most notably in euro 50, 20, and 10 cents, in the Swedish 5 and 10 kronor coins, the latter of which it was originally developed for, as well as the Polish 2 z\u0142ote commemorative coins. Its composition is 89% copper, 5% aluminium, 5% zinc, and 1% tin. Being a copper alloy, it contains no gold. Its colour and weight are unlike pure gold. It is non-allergenic; its other advantages include antimycotic and weak antimicrobial (especially after abrasion) attributes, and resistance to tarnishing. ==References== Category:Copper alloys Category:Eurozone Category:Coinage metals and alloys ",
