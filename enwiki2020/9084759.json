He was born at sea on a voyage to Barbados, the son of Henry George Windsor and his wife, Clara Windsor. He was baptised in November 1832 in Saint Michael, Barbados.Caribbean, Select Births and Baptisms, 1590-1928 His father was a slaveholder; he received \u00a3318 in compensation for 14 slaves he owned in Barbados, after the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.CJ Coventry, \"Links in the Chain: British slavery, Victoria and South Australia\" Before/Now 1(1) (2019), p. 32, https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:23672/datastreams/CONTENT/content Windsor's father died when he was five years old, and when he was about eight he was sent to school at Ottery, St Mary, Devonshire. He left school at 17, lived at Clifton and did some writing for the London press. He then returned to Barbados and for about 18 months taught at Codrington College. About the end of 1855 he went to Montreal and later to Glasgow. He worked as an army coach and also contributed to leading reviews; he had articles on Defoe and on Montaigne in the British Quarterly Review, in 1858. A collection of his articles was published in 1860, Ethica: or Characteristics of Men, Manners and Books. He was appointed editor of the Melbourne Argus not long afterwards, but resigned on a question of policy after holding the position for two and a half years. Windsor subsequently went to live at Castlemaine and edited the Mount Alexander Mail for three years. In 1872 he succeeded James Harrison as editor of The Age, and continued in this position for 28 years. It was a period of great importance for Victoria which saw the transition from a colony depending principally on the pastoral industry and gold-mining, to one in which agriculture and manufacturing were to be even more important. David Syme, as proprietor of the Age, directed its policy, and there were periods when he practically ruled Victoria. Windsor's vigorous and gifted mind was the medium through which Syme's ideas were brought before the public. The literary power of his leaders and other contributions was strongly felt by their readers, and Windsor's influence on the period marked him as one of the great journalists of his time. He retired in 1900 and lived at Melbourne until his death. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1832 births Category:1913 deaths Category:People born at sea Category:Australian journalists Category:Australian people of Canadian descent ",
