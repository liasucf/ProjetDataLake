    "text": "Tages 2 (commonly referred to as LP 2 or just 2) is the second studio album by Swedish pop group Tages, released on 4 August 1966 by Platina Records. Often considered their artistic breakthrough, six out of twelve tracks are original compositions. The album was recorded and released during a tense moment for the group, where drummer Freddie Skantze was just about to leave the group; he was briefly replaced by Tommy \"TT\" Tausis, who plays on four tracks on the album. Tages 2 would be the final albums for Skantze as he left following the recording, and Tausis would go on to play on Extra Extra before leaving towards the end of 1966. Both were replaced by drummer Lasse Svensson. Just like its predecessor Tages, it was issued in 6000 copies, and sold over 10000, becoming their second and last album certified in Sweden. Tages 2 yielded three singles of which two charted. The album itself did not chart on Kv\u00e4llstoppen. == Content == === Overview === In contrast to both their debut and later studio albums is that Tages 2 was self produced. The content is a lot more varied than their previous effort, in that it greatly contrasts in genres. The first track \"Dancing in the Street\" captures the spirit of their debut. It is also on this track that Tommy Tausis makes his debut; he sings and plays drums on the track. On tracks such as \"I Still Remember\", \"In My Dreams\", and \"Go\", influences from folk rock are apparent. On the album, six original compositions are present, of which five are credited to Tommy Blom, G\u00f6ran Lagerberg, Danne Larsson, Anders T\u00f6pel and Freddie Skantze. \"Guess Who\" can be considered an early expression of Freakbeat. On the album, Larsson takes up more instruments than his usual guitar; he plays piano and various other keyboard instruments. One single preceded the album, which was \"In My Dreams\". Recorded on 14 June 1966, it was Tages most successful release ever, reaching number one on both Tio I Topp and Kv\u00e4llstoppen. It became Tages one and only single to achieve this feat. \"In My Dreams\" heavily features bongo drums and flutes throughout, in an apparent attempt to experiment with their sound. The second single \"Crazy 'Bout My Baby\" was worked on by the band in May\u2013June. Released three months after the album, it became their biggest flop yet, as it did not reach Tio I Topp, and was the first release by them not to chart in the top ten on Kv\u00e4llstoppen, only reaching number 16. The final single was released almost a year later, and was the cover \"Dancing In The Street.\", which failed to chart on either list. === Vocals and album cover === The album is diverse in its vocal duties, with drummer Tausis singing lead on his tracks, something Skantze had previously only done on Tages closing track \"Stand by Me\", a vocal he shared with Tommy Blom. G\u00f6ran Lagerberg sings an overwhelming majority of the album's twelve tracks, similar to their debut album. Danne Larsson sings on \"I Still Remember\" and \"Go\" while Anders T\u00f6pel sings lead on \"I Got You (I Feel Good) and \"Dirty Mind\". The album cover depicts the band in front of a pitch-black background. No text is visible except the Platina logo in the top left corner along with a huge number \"2\" which takes up a majority of the right portion of the album cover. Interestingly, Tausis is not represented in any of the album covers, front and back. Instead, he is only mentioned in the liner notes. == Track listing == All tracks written by Tommy Blom, G\u00f6ran Lagerberg, Danne Larsson, Anders T\u00f6pel and Freddie Skantze unless noted. == Personnel == === Tages === * Tommy Blom \u2013 lead vocals on \"In My Dreams\", co-lead vocals on \"I Got You (I Feel Good) and \"Leaving Here\" * G\u00f6ran Lagerberg \u2013 bass guitar, lead vocals on \"Guess Who\", \"Get Out of My Life Woman\" and \"Those Rumours\", co-lead vocals on \"Dancing In The Street\", \"Jealous Girl\", \"Crazy 'Bout My Baby\", \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\", \"Leaving Here\" and \"Go\" * Anders T\u00f6pel \u2013 lead guitar, co-lead vocals on \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" and \"Dirty Mind\" * Danne Larsson \u2013 rhythm guitar, organ on \"Dancing in the Street\", \"Get Out Of My Life Woman\", \"Crazy 'Bout My Baby\" and \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\", piano on \"Dancing in the Street\", \"I Still Remember\", \"Guess Who\", \"Get Out Of My Life Woman\", \"Dirty Mind\" and \"Leaving Here\", spinet on \"Go\" * Freddie Skantze \u2013 drums on every track except \"Dancing in the Street\", \"Jealous Girl\", \"Crazy 'Bout My Baby\" and \"Go\", bongo drums on \"In My Dreams\" and \"Go\" * Tommy Tausis \u2013 drums and lead vocals on \"Dancing in the Street\", \"Jealous Girl\", \"Crazy 'Bout My Baby\" and \"Go\" === Other musicians === * Lasse Samuelsson\u00b4s Orchestra \u2013 flute, alto flute, clarinet and bass clarinet on \"In My Dreams\" === Technical === * Tages \u2013 producers *Bj\u00f6rn Almstedt \u2013 studio engineer * Ulf H.
