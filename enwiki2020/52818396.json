It has a gabled metal roof, and is clad in vertical board siding, which extends around to the insides of the portals. The siding on the portal ends extends outward to meet the ends of the gables, which extend beyond the sides. The deck consists of wooden planking. with The exact date of construction of the historic bridge is uncertain, as is its builder. Different sources claim construction dates of 1879 and 1881, and the builder as either E.P. Colton or John Colton. At the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, it had had no substantive alterations, notably not having had strengthening elements added. It was also the only surviving historic Paddleford truss bridge on a public roadway in the state. It was destroyed by an arsonist in 1997; the present bridge was completed in 2000. ==See also== * * * * * List of covered bridges in Vermont * National Register of Historic Places listings in Orleans County, Vermont * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont ==References== Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:National Register of Historic Places in Orleans County, Vermont Category:Bridges in Orleans County, Vermont Category:Buildings and structures in Irasburg, Vermont Category:Road bridges in Vermont Category:Wooden bridges in Vermont Category:Long truss bridges in the United States Category:Covered bridges in the United States destroyed by arson ",
