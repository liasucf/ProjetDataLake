    "text": "The Mother's Monument, or Monument to the Mother (Spanish: Monumento a la Madre), is a monument commemorating Mexican mothers, installed in Mexico City, inaugurated on May 10, 1949. It was destroyed on September 19, 2017, after an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 on the Richter scale that shook Mexico City, and reopened on November 21, 2018. ==Description and history== In Mexico, the idea of paying tribute to mothers with a monument arose in 1922, when then Secretary of Public Education, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, and the journalist Rafael Alduc\u00edn, founder of the newspaper Exc\u00e9lsior, wanted to pay \"a tribute of love and tenderness\", on May 10. In 1944, President Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho laid the first stone of what would be the Monument to the Mother. The monument was inaugurated by Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s on May 10, 1949. The architectural component was completed by Jos\u00e9 Villagr\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, while the sculptures were designed by Luis Ortiz Monasterio, who won a contest held by Exc\u00e9lsior in 1948. The monument is located in the Garden of Art, between the streets of Sullivan, Villalong\u00edn, and Avenida de los Insurgentes, dividing the colonies Cuauht\u00e9moc and San Rafael (in the Cuauht\u00e9moc delegation). It features three sculptures: an indigenous man seen writing, an indigenous woman with an ear of corn (a symbol of fertility), and a mother with a child in her arms. On September 19, 2017, the monument's central sculpture collapsed due to a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that shook Mexico City. On November 21, 2018, the government of Mexico City reopened the monument. The project was carried out by the architect Gabriel M\u00e9rigo. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1949 establishments in Mexico Category:1949 sculptures Category:Monuments and memorials in Mexico City Category:Monuments and memorials to women Category:Outdoor sculptures in Mexico City Category:Sculptures of children Category:Sculptures of men in Mexico Category:Sculptures of women in Mexico Category:Statues in Mexico ",
