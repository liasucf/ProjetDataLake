    "text": "Hurleyella is a genus of small flies in the family Dolichopodidae from the Nearctic and Neotropical realms. They belong to the \"micro-dolichopodids\", a group of probably unrelated genera from the New World which have a body length of 1 mm or less. The subfamily placement of this genus is currently uncertain, though in some aspects the genus fits into Medeterinae. The genus is named after the late dipterist Richard Hurley. == Species == * Hurleyella belizensis Runyon, 2019 * Hurleyella brooksi Runyon & Robinson, 2010 * Hurleyella cumberlandensis Runyon & Robinson, 2010 * Hurleyella salina Runyon, 2019 == References == Category:Dolichopodidae genera Category:Dolichopodidae Category:Diptera of North America ",
