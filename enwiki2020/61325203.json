    "text": "Sardar Chuhar Singh (born c. 1743) of Jharauli was a prominent general of Shaheedan Misl and a close relative of Sikh warriors Baba Deep Singh and Rai Singh Bhangi . He was originally came from the village Chung situated about 45 km south of Amritsar. Under the command of Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, he fought from Shaheedan Misl in Battle of Sirhind (1764) against Mughal Faujdar of Sirhind, Zain Khan Sirhindi and secured Jharauli, Fatehgarh Atri, Ajrana and seven other villages in the bet tracts of Markanda River as his share of battle. He had two sons, Karam Singh (d. 1808) and Mohar Singh (d. 1845). The younger Mohar Singh became incharge of Jharauli estate while his elder son Karam Singh took control of the family estate at Chung that finally incorporated to Lahore Darbar by Ranjit Singh after his death as issueless in 1808. Mohar Singh lost seven villages of Jharauli estate to Bhunga Singh of thanesar in 1780. The Jharauli estate was remained under the Court of Wards during 1885-1893 and then 1922-1947. == Early life == Sardar Chuhar Singh was born in Waraich clan of Sindhu Jats of village Chung around 1743. The village was named Chung after Waraich or Chung Jats were settled here in the time of adana Maliks. Motivated by Baba Deep Singh's teachings, he joined Shaheedan Misl under Karam Singh Shahid, grandson of Baba Deep Singh. At that time, the Sikhs of Mahja and Malwa were determined to conquer Muslim province of Sirhind so seven misls including Shaheedan misl from this area were united under the leadership of Jassa Singh Ahluwalia. == Fall of Sirhind, 14 January 1764 == Zain Khan Sirhindi, the Mughal Faujdar of Sirhind . The total strength of Sikh army, Dal Khalsa, was 50,000.The Sikhs lay encamped in three divisions. The six misls of Budha Dal under Jassa Singh Ahluwalia were stationed at Bhaganpur, while other five misls, Trauna Dal, were at Punja and the Phulkian misl was at Patiala. Zain Khan was informed of this situation and determined to take advantage of their scattered forces. One night he suddenly issued out Sirhind and attacked Trauna Dal at village Pir Zain Khan Munayra, seven miles east of Sirhind. Luckily the Sikhs had decided the last night to make a united attack on Sirhind and all of three sections of them already on the move from their encampments. The news of Zain Khan\u2019s attack was immediately conveyed to other two bodies and in a short time they surrendered Zain Khan on all sides. Zain Khan was forced to fight and found himself unable to cope the situation. He maintained his position at night and in early hours of morning began to send his detachments with guns, swivels and matchlocks with a view to divert the attention of Sikhs towards themselves, so that he might find time to escape. He was partially successful in his plans because the tranuna Dal actually fell upon the baggage and busy themselves in plunder But the Budha Dal under Jasa Singh Ahluwalia besieged him while he had gone only a little further.Zain Khan evaded his besiegers for some time more, but in his attempt to escape he was shot dead. His afghan troops fled in all directions in the state of panic, they were hotly pursued and cut to pieces indiscriminately. A vast track of Sirhind, 220 miles longs and 160 miles wide, fell into hands of Sikhs. This vast illaqa was divided among the Sardars.. From his share, Chuhar Singh retained ten villages for himself and gave the rest to his lieutenants. == Later years == After appointing his sons at Jharauli and Chung, he came back to Amritsar and remained in the driving seat of Gurdwara Shahid Bunga Baba Dip Singh for a long period of time, where a few years back his elder Baba Deep Singh took his last breath while saving Golden Temple from Ahmad Shah Durrani\u2019s army. During this time, he also acquired much land from either side of Ravi and was accounted one of most powerful Sardars of his time. The year of his death is unknown. The descendants of Chuhar Singh now live in Jharauli, Chandigarh and London. ==References== ==External links== *History Of The Sikhs Vol. IV The Sikh Commonwealth Or Rise And Fall Of Sikh Misls by Hari Ram Gupta. * Chiefs and families of note in the Delhi, Jalandhar, Peshawar and Derajat divisions of the Panjab (1890) by Massy, Charles Francis, 1845- *Who's Who In India Vol 1, Native States. *The Sikh Encyclopedia Online. *Indian Princely States. * SHAHIDAN (misl) *History and Philosophy of the Sikh religion by K.
