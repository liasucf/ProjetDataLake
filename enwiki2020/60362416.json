    "text": "The Gipuzkoa Football Federation's logo The Gipuzkoa Regional Championship (Spanish: Campeonato Regional de Guip\u00fazcoa; Basque: Gipuzkoako Herrialde Txapelketa) was an official football tournament in Spain, organised by the Gipuzkoan Football Federation in which affiliated clubs participated. It was played annually between 1918 and 1940 and served to elect the representative of the territory in the Copa del Rey. == History == In 1918, following several disagreements between the clubs in the North Federation of Spanish football, covering the Basque provinces of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, the National Committee of the Spanish Federation agreed to divide the existing region into separate championships. Thus, for the 1918\u201319 season Gipuzkoan clubs launched their own championship while the North Championship continued comprising the Biscay teams and the re-entry of Racing Santander, representing neighbouring Cantabria. In their last season as members of the North group, Gipuzkoans Real Uni\u00f3n took the title and went on win the 1918 Copa del Rey. Clubs belonging to other provinces were also affiliated to the Gipuzkoan Federation, together with those based in the province itself: clubs from Navarre and La Rioja were affiliated, the most notable being those of CA Osasuna and CD Logro\u00f1o, who played in the top level of the Gipuzkoa championship; Logro\u00f1o eventually even managed to win the title twice. In 1928 the Navarre Federation was founded and Osasuna left the Gipuzkoa championship, although by 1929 they had returned, with the competition becoming the 'Gipuzkoa-Navarre Combined Championship'. In 1931, clubs from Arag\u00f3n were added and the name changed to the 'Gipuzkoa- Navarre-Arag\u00f3n Combined Championship'; however, the Gipuzkoan teams remained dominant. In 1934 the Spanish Federation carried out a significant restructuring of the national tournaments, so that the regional championships were replaced by superregional ones, in which the best clubs of different regional federations were grouped. In the case of the Basque region, the 'Basque Cup' was launched in 1934\u201335. The teams of Gipuzkoa and Navarre were integrated into the Basque Cup, while CD Logro\u00f1o and the Arag\u00f3n teams were integrated into a new 'Cantabria-Castile-Arag\u00f3n Cup'. These tournaments were played for two years, until being interrupted by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. During the last months of the war in 1939, football activity was resumed in some areas controlled by the Nationalist side, under the impulse of the Spanish Federation and the regional federations. Six teams participated in the reborn Gipuzkoa Championship, the novelty of which was the inclusion of teams from \u00c1lava in the federation, since until then they had been affiliated to the Biscay Championship. The champions Alav\u00e9s and runners-up Donostia took part in the 1939 Copa del General\u00edsimo. The Gipuzkoa-Navarre-Arag\u00f3n Combined Championship resumed in the 1939\u201340 season, again providing qualification for the Spanish Cup, since then called Copa del General\u00edsimo. However, restructuring approved by the Spanish Federation in 1940 quickly led to the disappearance of the regional championships. ==Seasons summary== {|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#f7f8ff\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\" |- align=center bgcolor=#DDDDDD style=\"color:black;\" !width=\"50\"|Season !width=\"100\"|Champion !Copa del Rey !width=\"100\"|Runner-up !

Prior to the split between Gipuzkoa and Biscay, their players also formed a combined 'North' team (nominally including Cantabria, but dominated by Basque players) which evolved into the Basque Country team. In 2013, a match was staged between the amateur teams of Biscay and Gipuzkoa (which continue to operate provincial football leagues at the fifth level of the pyramid and below) resulting in a 1\u20131 draw, won by Biscay on penalties, to commemorate the centenary of the Biscay Federation (taking its foundation date as that of the North Federation), as had also taken place in 1964 for the 50th anniversary (6\u20130 to Biscay). The centenary of the Gipuzkoa Federation occurred in 2018, but the organisers opted for a conventional friendly between its two biggest clubs \u2013 Real Sociedad and SD Eibar \u2013 to mark the occasion rather than any match involving representative teams; that was also the case for the 50th anniversary in 1968, when Real Sociedad played twice against Alav\u00e9s. ===Results=== ===Table=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Opponent ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|25px Biscay |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- class=\"sortbottom\" !Total (2 opponents) |} == References == * Mart\u00ednez Calatrava, Vicente (2001).
