    "text": "The Dore Holm is a small uninhabited islet off the south coast of Esha Ness, located in the west of Mainland, Shetland, Scotland. Its natural arch can be seen from the coast between Tangwick and Stenness. The shape of the arch has been compared to a horse drinking deeply from the water. The name appears to be derived from 'door', the word 'holm' being of Scandinavian origin and meaning a small island. ==Sources== * This article incorporates text from Shetlopedia Category:Uninhabited islands of Shetland Category:Northmavine ",
