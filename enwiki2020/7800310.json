    "text": "The 1987 FA Cup Final took place on 16 May 1987 at Wembley Stadium. It was contested between Coventry City and Tottenham Hotspur. Spurs were appearing in their third final in seven seasons, having won the trophy in 1981 and 1982 and were strong favourites, while unfancied Coventry were appearing in their first ever domestic cup final. Spurs were going for a record eighth victory and had never lost a final. Coventry eventually triumphed 3\u20132 after extra time. ==Summary== BBC commentator John Motson stated that it was \"the finest Cup Final I've had the pleasure of commentating on\". There were no bookings and the game was generally considered a good advertisement for English football. Spurs played the game in their new kit for the following 1987\u201388 season but with white shorts instead of blue. Due to a mix up only half of the Spurs players wore the Holsten sponsorship on their shirts. Tottenham had been knocked out of the Football League Cup in the semi-finals, by fierce rivals Arsenal (who went on to win the trophy) and had finished third in the league, and so, having spent most of the season challenging for a unique domestic treble, they ended it with no major trophies at all. Aside from the third round against Bolton Wanderers, Coventry had progressed to the final by winning all of their games away from home, including victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford (Alex Ferguson's first FA Cup loss with United). One downside to Coventry's triumph was that they would not be able to make a challenge for the European Cup Winners' Cup; UEFA had voted for the ban on English clubs in European competitions, imposed in 1985 following the Heysel disaster, to continue for a third season. In an attempt to show some reward for their achievement, Coventry arranged 'the Anglo-Scottish Challenge Cup', a two-legged match against the Scottish Cup winners, St Mirren. After a 1\u20131 draw at Highfield Road, attended by fewer than 5,000 spectators, the second leg at Love Street was postponed and eventually abandoned.The Scotsman, 31 January 2009, accessed 23 April 2010 Steve Ogrizovic, who remained with Coventry until retiring as a player in 2000, was Coventry's last remaining player from the game when he played his last game for them. Gary Mabbutt, who remained with Tottenham until 1998, was the last player to leave runners-up Tottenham. Clive Allen scored his 49th goal of the season for Tottenham in the final, after a prolific season where his scoring exploits earned him the Player of the Year awards from both the FWA and PFA. London musicians Chas & Dave released a song called Hot Shot Tottenham!. It reached No. 18 in the charts. Coventry's single 'Go For It' reached No. 61. ==Road to Wembley== Home teams listed first. {|width = 100% |width=50% valign=top| ===Coventry City=== Round 3: Coventry City 1- 0 Bolton Wanderers Round 4: Manchester United 0\u20131 Coventry City Round 5: Stoke City 0\u20131 Coventry City Round 6: Sheffield Wednesday 1\u20133 Coventry City Semi-final: Coventry City 3\u20132 Leeds United |width=50% valign=top| ===Tottenham Hotspur=== Round 3: Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 Scunthorpe United Round 4: Tottenham Hotspur 4\u20130 Crystal Palace Round 5: Tottenham Hotspur 1\u20130 Newcastle United Round 6: Wimbledon 0\u20132 Tottenham Hotspur Semi-final: Tottenham Hotspur 4\u20131 Watford |} ==Match summary== The bus in which the victorious Coventry players paraded the cup through the city after their victory. It is now on display in the Coventry Transport Museum. After only two minutes, Clive Allen scored his 49th goal of the season, heading past keeper Steve Ogrizovic at the near post from a Chris Waddle cross from the right. Within seven minutes, though, the Sky Blues were level through Dave Bennett, a Cup Final loser in 1981 for Manchester City, coincidentally at the hands of Spurs. Bennett collected the ball in the box and got around the advancing goalkeeper to hit left footed into the net past Steve Hodge on the line. The London club were back in front five minutes before the break through defender Gary Mabbutt when he deflected the ball past the goalkeeper after a cross from the right. Midway through the second half the Midlanders were level again \u2013 Bennett's cross from the right was met by striker Keith Houchen with a diving header from six yards out, for a goal which was voted in the top 10 goals ever scored at Wembley. Houchen was also awarded the BBC's Goal of the Season for 1987. The scores stayed level until full-time and the game went into extra-time. Six minutes in, Mabbutt scored an own goal after Lloyd McGrath centred the ball from the right and it took a deflection off of the Spurs defender's left knee from six yards out and over keeper Ray Clemence. One of Coventry's fanzines is entitled 'Gary Mabbutt's Knee' in commemoration of the goal. ==Match details== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1 || Steve Ogrizovic |- |RB ||2 || David Phillips |- |LB ||3 || Greg Downs |- |MF ||4 || Lloyd McGrath |- |CB ||5 || Brian Kilcline (c) || || |- |CB ||6 || Trevor Peake |- |MF ||7 || Dave Bennett |- |MF ||8 || Micky Gynn |- |CF ||9 || Cyrille Regis |- |CF ||10|| Keith Houchen |- |MF ||11|| Nick Pickering |- |colspan=4|Substitutes: |- |DF ||14|| Graham Rodger || || |- |MF ||12|| Steve Sedgley |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| John Sillett and George Curtis |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1 || Ray Clemence |- |RB ||2 || Chris Hughton || || |- |LB ||3 || Mitchell Thomas |- |MF ||4 || Steve Hodge |- |CB ||5 || Richard Gough (c) |- |CB ||6 || Gary Mabbutt |- |CF ||7 || Clive Allen |- |MF ||8 || Paul Allen |- |MF ||9 || Chris Waddle |- |MF ||10|| Glenn Hoddle |- |MF ||11|| Ossie Ardiles || || |- |colspan=4|Substitutes: |- |FW ||12|| Nico Claesen || || |- |DF ||14|| Gary Stevens || || |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| David Pleat |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *Replay if scores still level. *Two named substitutes *Maximum of 2 substitutions. |} ==References== ==External links== *Official Match Highlights at the FA *Game facts at soccerbase.com 1987 FA Cup Final 1987 FA Cup Final 1987 Final FA Cup Final FA Cup Final ",
