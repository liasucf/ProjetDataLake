    "text": "Ernesto Gim\u00e9nez Caballero (2 August 1899 in Madrid \u2013 14 May 1988 in Madrid), also known as Gec\u00e9, was a Spanish writer, film director, diplomat, and pioneer of Fascism in Spain. His work has been categorized as being part of the Surrealist movement, while Stanley G. Payne has described him as the Spanish Gabriele d'Annunzio. ==Education== He took the baccalaureate education at the Instituto San Isidro. Between 1916 and 1920 he took studies in Letras at the Central University (where he wrote for the Conservative journal Filosof\u00eda y Letras and helped to launch a \"Group of Socialist Students\", some of whose members would soon after establish the Spanish Communist Party), and then collaborated for a time at the Centro de Estudios Hist\u00f3ricos before moving to the University of Strasbourg to work as lecturer in Spanish. Influenced by Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset's critique of democracy, however, he became a nationalist in the vein of Miguel de Unamuno.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 148 ==Military service== He performed his military service in Spanish Morocco, although his 1923 book on the experience, Notas Marruecas de un Soldado, which was influenced by Charles Maurras, caused such outrage amongst the generals that he was imprisoned for a time before being pardoned by General and Dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera. As literary critic for El Sol newspaper he went to Italy in 1928 and struck up friendships with such fascist thinkers as Giuseppe Bottai, Giovanni Gentile, Curzio Malaparte and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, eventually becoming an adherent of fascist beliefs himself. Having had already made a name for himself as an aesthetic writer, he announced his conversion to fascism in 1929 in an article in La Gaceta Literaria, a journal he had founded in 1927. Dubbed the \"Spanish d'Annunzio\", his conversion saw him cut off from Spain's high culture which was dominated by Liberals, becoming what he described as \"a literary Robinson Crusoe\".Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism: 1914-1945, London: Routledge, 2001, pp. 256-58 ==Ideology== Being married to an Italian, sister of the Italian Consul at Strasburg, Gim\u00e9nez Caballero's fascism was largely derived from the Italian model of fascism whilst also including an international dimension in which he saw fascism as the future of the Latin Roman Catholic world.Payne, A History of Fascism, p. 258 He had little sympathy for National Socialism, which he saw as too Protestant and northern, even going so far as foreseeing war between fascism and national socialism. Writing extensively about the decadence of modern society and fascism in his book 1932 Genio de Espa\u00f1a, Gim\u00e9nez Caballero called for a re-establishment of the Spanish Empire to its former glory under a Mussolini-led Latin union. His follow-up, La Nueva Catolicidad, underlined his commitment to Roman Catholicism within a fascist framework. Gim\u00e9nez Caballero was a promoter of cultural Philosephardism, publishing several philosephardist pieces himself in La Gaceta Literaria. His Philosephardism\u2014not exempt from contradictions\u2014was no impediment to the outburst of antisemitic ideas in Gec\u00e9, particularly once his Fascist romanism affirmed, although there is no clear boundary in the chronology. Gimenez Caballero declared his support for the plans of Ramiro Ledesma Ramos and became involved in his Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista. However the writer was no political organizer and generally left control of the movement to Ledesma. He went on to join the Falange Espa\u00f1ola y de las JONS and served on the council of the movement. However he was at odds with many of the ideas of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, son of his former redeemer from jail, General Miguel Primo de Rivera. He was expelled from the Falange in 1936 after he began to work with the Mallorca banker Juan March Ordinas in the Partido Espa\u00f1ol de Patrones y Empresarios. Later readmitted to the Falange, he fled to Italy during the Spanish Civil War, but from abroad encouraged Francisco Franco to merge the Falangists with the Carlists. He was rewarded for his encouragement with the post of Vice-Secretary for National Education in Franco's inaugural cabinet. ==Later years== One of the most bizarre of Gim\u00e9nez Caballero's actions was perhaps his unsuccessful attempt to marry Primo de Rivera's sister, Pilar, to Adolf Hitler, as a way to \"soften\" and \"catholicize\" the latter.Francisco Umbral: \"Ram\u00f3n y las vanguardias\", El Pa\u00eds, 5 August 1985 After the Spanish Civil War he spent most of his time abroad, holding positions in the Spanish embassies in Paraguay and Brazil before being appointed ambassador to Paraguay in 1958, a position he held for 14 years. In later life he continued as a writer, winning his final writing prize, Premio Espejo de Espa\u00f1a, for his work Retratos espa\u00f1oles (bastante parecidos) in 1985 whilst also directing a series of documentary films. Gim\u00e9nez Caballero, who spent his last months following a surgical procedure to treat cataract in his house in the El Viso colony under an ill condition and dealing with auditive disorders, finally died on 14 May 1988. ==References== == Bibliography == * * * * * ==External links== * Category:1899 births Category:1988 deaths Category:People from Madrid Category:Spanish diplomats Category:Spanish fascists Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War (National faction) Category:Spanish film directors Category:Spanish male writers Category:Spanish Roman Catholics Category:Complutense University of Madrid alumni Category:Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola Category:Antisemitism in Spain Category:Philosephardism in Spain ",
