    "text": "Phenom is an American sitcom about a tennis wunderkind that aired on ABC from September 14, 1993 to May 10, 1994. The series stars Angela Goethals, Judith Light, and William Devane. Phenom was placed in the time slot of Tuesdays at 8:30/7:30c, between Full House and Roseanne. The series did well in the ratings, ranking in the Top 20 and maintaining 95% of its Full House lead-in. ABC cancelled the show after one season and replaced it with Me and the Boys, which was also cancelled after one season. ==Synopsis== Fifteen-year-old Angela Doolan (Goethals) has the potential to be a sports superstar but worries about losing her normality and severing her family ties. Angela's father has deserted the family to rediscover his youth and dally with younger women, leaving her mother Dianne (Light) to raise her children (including older son Brian and youngest daughter Mary Margaret) and try to keep a lid on her bitterness. Added to the fray is Angela's obsessive tennis coach Lou (Devane), who is determined to bring out the champion in Angela regardless of the cost to her growth as a person. ==Cast== ===Main cast=== *Angela Goethals \u2013 Angela Doolan *Judith Light \u2013 Dianne Doolan *Ashley Johnson \u2013 Mary Margaret Doolan *Todd Louiso \u2013 Brian Doolan *William Devane \u2013 Lou Della Rosa (uncredited) *Jennifer Lien \u2013 Roanne ===Recurring cast=== *Sara Rue \u2013 Monica *Randy Josselyn \u2013 Jesse *Beverley Mitchell \u2013 Clara *Marianne Muellerleile \u2013 Sister Felicia *Debra Jo Rupp \u2013 Sister Mary Incarnata *John Christian Graas \u2013 Tony Lenchenko ==Production notes== The series was created by Dick Blasucci, Marc Flanagan, and Sam Simon. Blasucci also served as executive producer of the series, alongside Emmy Award-winner James L. Brooks and Danny Kallis, who previously worked alongside Judith Light as a writer/producer on Who's The Boss? Despite being one of the show's main stars, William Devane did not receive on-screen credit in any of the episodes. Devane was originally slated to get second billing in the cast, between Judith Light and Angela Goethals. He reportedly fought to have top billing,Judith Light: ABC's Ratings Phenom Continues Hot Streak, Orlando Sentinel, October 15, 1993. or at least shared top billing with Light, in response to his Knots Landing fame. Both the producers and ABC refused to move Devane's billing, believing that Judith Light having sole first billing would draw in more of the female 18-49 demographic that is attractive to advertisers and would bring back ABC viewers who had made Light's previous series, Who's the Boss?, a success. Devane ultimately told the producers that if he couldn't get a billing change, he would rather not be credited at all.Phenom's' William Devane Gets No Credit, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, May 15, 1994. Phenom's theme song, \"The Promise and the Prize,\" was written and performed by Carly Simon. Two versions of the song were used during the program's run, a one-minute version as well as a 30-second version that appeared in select episodes that ran over their allotted time. U.S. Open women's singles and Wimbledon mixed doubles champion Tracy Austin served as the technical consultant for the series. (Austin also appeared in a cameo in the series' pilot episode.) ==Episodes== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! style=\"background:#6991FF; color:#FFFFFF;\" | No. ! style=\"background:#6991FF; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Title ! style=\"background:#6991FF; color:#FFFFFF; textalign:center;\" | Directed by ! style=\"background:#6991FF; color:#FFFFFF; textalign:center;\" | Written by ! style=\"background:#6991FF; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Original air date |} ==Awards and nominations== {| style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B0C4DE\" ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\" |Year ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\" |Award ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\" |Result ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\" |Category ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\" |Recipient |- | rowspan=\"3\" |1994 || rowspan=\"3\" |Young Artist Awards || rowspan=\"2\" |Nominated || Youth Actress Leading Role in a Television Series || Angela Goethals |- | Best New Television Series || - |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA;\" | Won || Best Actress Under Ten in a Television Series or Show || Ashley Johnson (Tied with Ashley Peldon for Shameful Secrets) |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1993 American television series debuts Category:1994 American television series endings Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:American sports television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by Gracie Films Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles ",
