The ministers are not accompanied by their assistants, which makes the condition easier for informal and frank exchange of views. This type of meeting received its name from the first of such events held at Schloss Gymnich in Erftstadt, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. ==2019 meetings== * Bucharest: 31 January\u20131 FebruaryUpdated information \u2013 The Informal meeting of the EU foreign affairs ministers (Gymnich) * Helsinki: 29\u201330 AugustINFORMAL MEETING OF MINISTERS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (GYMNICH) ==2018 meetings== * Sofia: 15\u201316 FebruaryInformal meeting of European Union (EU) Foreign Ministers (Gymnich): 15-16 February 2018:Written statement - HLWS468 * Vienna: 30\u201331 AugustInformal meeting of European Union (EU) Foreign Ministers (Gymnich): 30-31 August 2018:Written statement - HCWS950 ==See also== *Foreign Affairs Council ==References== *http://www.cy2012.eu/en/events/informal-meeting-of- foreign-affairs-ministers-gymnich *Patrick Roger, \u00ab La tr\u00e8s couteuse pr\u00e9sidence fran\u00e7aise de l'Union europ\u00e9enne \u00bb, Le Monde, 2009-10-29 * William Wallace: \"Regional Integration: The West European Experience Transaction Publishers 1994 p. 46 * Clifford P.
