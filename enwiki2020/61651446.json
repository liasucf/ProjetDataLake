Construction began in 1884 and continued for three years, before being complicated by the architect's death. Tatsuno Kingo and, at one stage, Katayama T\u014dkuma were drafted in to oversee the remainder of the project, and works finished in 1892. On 9 July that year the Meiji Emperor visited, Empress Sh\u014dken attending the following day. The residence had a grand salon, large and small reception rooms, and a ballroom. It was destroyed in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake in 1923. ==See also== * Ch\u014dkokan ==References== Category:Nabeshima clan Category:Buildings and structures in Chiyoda, Tokyo Category:Buildings of the Meiji period Category:History of Tokyo ",
