    "text": "Ui (pronounced ooo-eee) was an American post-rock/funk band based in New York City, which started in 1990. The group was started by Sasha Frere-Jones and Clem Waldmann. Wilbo Wright joined the group in 1993. The group's songs are often described as \"bass-heavy\", as the band frequently used two bass guitars. Other instruments used by the band include banjo, synthesizers, tuba and timpani. Their musical style is described to range between funk, dub, post- rock and electronica. The group had a high reliance on samplers and other studio equipment to overdub and articulate rhythms. The group disbanded in 2003 shortly after the recording of the album Answers. ==Discography== ===Full length=== *Answers (Southern, June 2003) *Lifelike (Southern, April 1998) *Sidelong (Southern, March 1996) ===EPs and remixes=== *The Iron Apple (Southern, November 1999) *Fires as the group name \"Uilab\" (Bingo; Duophonic Records, February 1998), Ui and Stereolab collaborating on versions of \"St Elmo's Fire\" by Brian Eno *Dropplike (Southern, August 1996), 3 remixes of songs from Sidelong *Match My Foot 7\" (Soul Static Sound, February 1996) *The Sharpie (Soul Static Sound, February 1996) *Unlike: Remixes Volume 1 (Lunamoth, November 1995), remixes of material from The 2-Sided EP and Sidelong *The 2-Sided EP (Hemiola, December 1993) Ui have also remixed music for many groups, including Techno Animal and Microstoria. ==References== ==External links== *Official webpage (on Internet Archive) *UI at Discogs Category:American funk musical groups Category:American post-rock groups Category:Musical groups from New York City ",
