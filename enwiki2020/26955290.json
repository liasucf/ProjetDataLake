    "text": "The 2010\u201311 season was Chelsea Football Club's 97th competitive season, 19th consecutive season in the Premier League, and 105th year in existence as a football club. They went into the Premier League as the defending champions, but failed to retain it. The club was managed by their Double-winning manager Carlo Ancelotti, but his association with the club would be broken off, being sacked at the end of the season. Chelsea started off the season with an amazing five-consecutive-wins run in the Premier League, which was eventually halted by Manchester City when City skipper Carlos Tevez scored to lead his side into a 1\u20130 triumph over the defending champions. Chelsea were leading the Premier League table for almost half a season, before Manchester United overtook them when Chelsea went through a bad period during the winter saga. Altogether in the Premier League, Chelsea won 21 games, drew 8 and lost 9. They conceded the fewest goals compared to all the other clubs in the league, sharing this with Manchester City. In January 2011, on the last day of the transfer window, Chelsea bought Fernando Torres for a club-record-breaking and British-record-breaking fee of \u00a350 million from Liverpool. They also bought defender David Luiz from Benfica, for \u20ac25 million plus Nemanja Mati\u0107, on the same day. ==Key dates== *9 June 2010: Chelsea announce that they are to release Joe Cole, Michael Ballack and Juliano Belletti, whose contracts run out at the end of the month. *17 June 2010: Premier League fixtures for the 2010\u201311 season are announced.

After Sandro gives Tottenham the lead with a shot from 30 yards, Chelsea equalise before half time when Heurelho Gomes lets Frank Lampard's long range effort through his body and over the line. Replays later appear to indicate that all of the ball had not crossed the line, but the goal is given. Then substitute Salomon Kalou, with minutes to go, stabs in Didier Drogba's fluffed shot from close range. Replays later show that Kalou was offside when the shot was taken, but again the goal is given. The result brought Chelsea only three points behind league leaders Manchester United, following their 0\u20131 defeat to Arsenal \u2013 with Man United the next side for Chelsea to play. A victory would take Chelsea top of the league with only two games left to play. *8 May 2011: Manchester United beat Chelsea 2\u20131 to inch closer to the record 19th title. Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Nemanja Vidi\u0107 put United 2\u20130 up in the first half. Frank Lampard pulled one back in the second half, but it wasn't enough, as Manchester United kept their defense tight and held on to win the match. *22 May 2011: Carlo Ancelotti is sacked after the last match of the season. ==Club== ===Coaching staff=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Position !Staff |- |Manager|| Carlo Ancelotti |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Assistant managers|| Ray Wilkins (until 11 November 2011) |- | Bruno Demichelis |- | Paul Clement |- | Michael Emenalo (from 18 November 2010) |- |First team fitness coach|| Glen Driscoll |- |Assistant first team fitness coach|| Chris Jones |- |Individual team fitness coach|| Giovanni Mauri |- |Goalkeeping coach|| Christophe Lollichon |- |Head opposition scout|| Michael Emenalo (until 18 November 2010) |- |Senior opposition scout|| Mick McGiven |- |Medical director|| Dr. Bryan English |- |Sporting director|| Frank Arnesen |- |Reserve team manager|| Steve Holland |- |Youth team manager|| Dermot Drummy |- |Academy manager|| Neil Bath |- |Match analyst|| James Melbourne |} ===Other information=== |- ||Chief Executive|| Ron Gourlay |- ==Kits== Supplier: Adidas / Sponsor: Samsung {|border=\"0\" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |} ===Kits information=== Chelsea released all new home, away, third and goalkeeper kit for this season. *Home: The new home kit featured red trim on the collar, sleeves, and shorts for the first time in 1994\u201395 season.
