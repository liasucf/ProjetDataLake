He was briefly Vice-Chamberlain of the Household under Sir Robert Peel between December 1834 and April 1835. ==Background and education== Frederick Stewart was born on 7 July 1805 at Grosvenor Square, Mayfair, London. He was the only child of Charles Stewart and his first wife Catherine Bligh. His father would become the 3rd Marquess of Londonderry but was at the time only the second son of Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry. His father's family was Ulster-Scots. Frederick's mother was the fourth and youngest daughter of John Bligh, 3rd Earl of Darnley. He was his father's only son from his first marriage. His mother died in 1812 when he was seven while his father was serving in the army in the Peninsular War. His father remarried seven years later in 1819 and Frederick's half-siblings were born. He was the only child of his parents but had younger half-siblings: #Frederick William Robert Stewart (1805\u20131872). {| !align=\"left\"|Frederick's half-siblings |- | #George Henry Robert Charles William Vane-Tempest (1821\u20131884), 5th Marquess; #Frances Anne Emily Vane (1822\u20131899), married John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough; #Alexandrina Octavia Maria Vane (1823\u20131874), godchild of Alexander I of Russia, married Henry Dawson-Damer, 3rd Earl of Portarlington; #Adolphus Frederick Charles William Vane-Tempest (1825\u20131864), politician, became insane, and had to be medically restrained; #Adelaide Emelina Caroline Vane (c. 1830 \u2013 1882), disgraced the family by eloping with her brother's tutor, Rev.

He went to Eton in 1814, where he stayed until 1820.

Lord Castlereagh was wounded in the wrist; the Count was uninjured. After the duel, Grisi left her husband and began an affair with Lord Castlereagh. Their son, George Frederick Ormsby (1838\u20131901), was born in November 1838 and brought up by his father. By 1852, he \"had fallen out with his father, the 3rd Marquess of Londonderry over their views on the land question [and] was obliged to retire because of these differences\".Brian Walker, 'Landowners and Parliamentary Elections in County Down, 1801\u20131921' PP 307\u20138 in Lindsay Proudfoot, 'Down \u2013 History and Society', Geography Publications, 1997 Frederick Stewart married Lady Elizabeth Frances Charlotte Jocelyn, widow of Viscount Powerscourt and daughter of Robert Jocelyn, 3rd Earl of Roden, at the British Embassy in Paris on 2 May 1846. There were no children from the marriage. In 1855 his wife converted to Roman Catholicism. He succeeded his father in 1854 as the 4th Marquess of Londonderry. He built Scrabo Tower as a monument to the memory of his father. In 1857 he and his wife attended the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone. Arms of the 4th Marquess of Londonderry ==Decline, death and succession== In 1862 Londonderry was diagnosed as mentally ill. He was secluded in an mental institution at White Rock Pavilion in Hastings. He died there on 25 November 1872, aged 67 and was buried in the Newtownards Priory. His wife, the dowager Marchioness of Londonderry died on 2 September 1884, aged 70, and was buried with him in the double grave in Newtownards Priory. As he had no legitimate children, he was succeeded in the marquessate by his half-brother, George Vane-Tempest, 2nd Earl Vane. This had the effect that the fortunes of the Stewart and the Vane side of the Londonderry family were reunited in a single hand. ==Ancestry== ==Notes and References== * * \u2013 L to M * * * * ==External links== *Genealogy of Frederick William Robert Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry on The Peerage website * Category:1805 births Category:1872 deaths Category:Knights of St Patrick Category:Lord-Lieutenants of Down Category:Lords of the Admiralty 4 Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Castlereagh, Frederick Stewart, Viscount Category:People educated at Eton College Castlereagh, Frederick Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Frederick Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Frederick Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Frederick Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Frederick Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Frederick Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Frederick Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Frederick Stewart, Viscount Category:UK MPs who inherited peerages Frederick ",
