    "text": "This article describes the history of South African cricket from the aftermath of the First World War in 1919 to the end of the Second World War in 1945. ==Domestic cricket from 1919 to 1945== Domestic first-class matches focused on the Currie Cup competition which, although it was the national championship, was not always contested because of travel constraints and other reasons. The Currie Cup was not held in seasons when there was a Test tour of South Africa, though it was held in 1931\u201332 when the South African Test side travelled to Australia and New Zealand. ===Currie Cup winners from 1919\u201320 to 1944\u201345=== * 1919\u201320 not contested * 1920\u201321 Western Province * 1921\u201322 undecided * 1922\u201323 not contested * 1923\u201324 Transvaal * 1924\u201325 not contested * 1925\u201326 Transvaal * 1926\u201327 Transvaal * 1927\u201328 not contested * 1928\u201329 not contested * 1929\u201330 Transvaal * 1930\u201331 not contested * 1931\u201332 Western Province * 1932\u201333 not contested * 1933\u201334 Natal * 1934\u201335 Transvaal * 1935\u201336 not contested * 1936\u201337 Natal * 1937\u201338 Natal and Transvaal (shared) * 1938\u201339 not contested * 1939\u201340 not contested * 1940\u201341 not contested * 1941\u201342 not contested * 1942\u201343 not contested * 1943\u201344 not contested * 1944\u201345 not contested ===Second World War=== From the outset of the war, South Africa was actively involved as a member of the Allies. The war brought austerity and cricket was considered by many to be frivolous in such circumstances. Only one first-class game was played in South Africa during the wartime seasons. This match took place during the 1942 New Year period at Newlands in Cape Town between Western Province and Transvaal. It ended in a draw. Western Province batted first and scored 237 in 79.1 overs. In reply, James Pickerill's 71 was the top score and Reginald Lofthouse's 4\u201363 was the best return as Transvaal made 251 for 8 declared. Sidney Kiel top-scored in the match with 128 not out as Western Province declared on 236 for 8. This didn't quite leave enough time for a result and Transvaal had made 166\u20136 when stumps were drawn. ==International tours of South Africa from 1919\u201320 to 1944\u201345== ===Australian Imperial Forces (AIF) 1919\u201320=== * Western Province v AIF \u2013 AIF won by 2 wickets * Transvaal v AIF \u2013 match drawn * Natal v AIF \u2013 AIF won by 310 runs * Natal v AIF \u2013 AIF won by an innings and 42 runs * Transvaal v AIF \u2013 AIF won by an innings and 14 runs * South Africa v AIF \u2013 AIF won by 8 wickets * South Africa v AIF \u2013 AIF won by an innings and 129 runs * Western Province v AIF \u2013 match drawn The AIF team had players of the calibre of Jack Gregory, Herbie Collins, Bert Oldfield and Nip Pellew. ===Australia 1921\u201322=== * 1st Test at Lord's, Durban \u2013 match drawn * 2nd Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 match drawn * 3rd Test at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town \u2013 Australia won by 10 wickets ===England 1922\u201323=== * 1st Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 South Africa won by 168 runs * 2nd Test at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town \u2013 England won by 1 wicket * 3rd Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 match drawn * 4th Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 match drawn * 5th Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 England won by 109 runs ===England 1924\u201325=== A team captained by Lionel Tennyson and including 12 past or future England Test players toured South Africa between November 1924 and February 1925. ===England 1927\u201328=== * 1st Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 England won by 10 wickets * 2nd Test at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town \u2013 England won by 87 runs * 3rd Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 match drawn * 4th Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 South Africa won by 4 wickets * 5th Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 South Africa won by 8 wickets ===England 1930\u201331=== * 1st Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 South Africa won by 28 runs * 2nd Test at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town \u2013 match drawn * 3rd Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 match drawn * 4th Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 match drawn * 5th Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 match drawn ===Australia 1935\u201336=== * 1st Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 Australia won by 9 wickets * 2nd Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 match drawn * 3rd Test at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town \u2013 Australia won by an innings and 78 runs * 4th Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 Australia won by an innings and 184 runs * 5th Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 Australia won by an innings and 6 runs ===England 1938\u201339=== * 1st Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 match drawn * 2nd Test at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town \u2013 match drawn * 3rd Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 England won by an innings and 13 runs * 4th Test at Old Wanderers, Johannesburg \u2013 match drawn * 5th Test at Kingsmead, Durban \u2013 match drawn ==References== ==Further reading== * H S Altham and EW Swanton, A History of Cricket, Volume 2 (to 1945), George Allen & Unwin, 1947 * Rowland Bowen, Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development, Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1970 * Louis Duffus, South African Cricket, Volume 3, 1927\u20131947, The South African Cricket Association, 1948 * South African Cricket Annual \u2013 various editions * various writers, A Century of South Africa in Test & International Cricket 1889\u20131989, Ball, 1989 ==External links== * CricketArchive \u2013 itinerary of South African cricket Category:1921 in South African cricket Category:1922 in South African cricket Category:1927 in South African cricket Category:1928 in South African cricket Category:1930 in South African cricket Category:1931 in South African cricket Category:1935 in South African cricket Category:1936 in South African cricket Category:1938 in South African cricket Category:1939 in South African cricket 1945 1945 1945 ",
