    "text": "Ashgrove is an album by American artist Dave Alvin, released in 2004. It reached number 38 on the Top Independent Albums chart. ==Background== The title song is in reference to the Ashgrove club where Alvin first saw his early inspirations Big Joe Turner, T-Bone Walker, Lightnin' Hopkins and Reverend Gary Davis. \"The Man in the Bed\" is a reflection on the death of his father. ==Reception== Writing for Allmusic, music critic Mark Deming wrote of the album \"Dave is rockin' again...though just a little bit... Overall, the quieter material makes up the bulk of Ashgrove's playing time, but the handful of blues-based tunes on board give the set a texture that's cool and sharp, and the result resides in a satisfying middle ground that ought to please fans on both side of the electric guitar issue.\" Jason MacNeil of PopMatters wrote \"His latest album is suggested as a blues album, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find the mid-tempo blues tunes an improvement on the stellar folk-oriented side.\" ==Track listing== All songs by Dave Alvin unless otherwise noted. #\"Ashgrove\" \u2013 6:15 #\"Rio Grande\" (Dave Alvin, Tom Russell) \u2013 4:25 #\"Black Sky\" \u2013 4:48 #\"Nine Volt Heart\" (Alvin, Rod Hodges) \u2013 4:57 #\"Out of Control\" \u2013 6:34 #\"Everett Ruess\" \u2013 4:51 #\"Sinful Daughter\" (Alvin, Shannon McNally) \u2013 4:28 #\"The Man in the Bed\" \u2013 4:35 #\"Black Haired Girl\" \u2013 5:25 #\"Somewhere in Time\" (Alvin, David Hidalgo, Louie P\u00e9rez) \u2013 5:54 ==Personnel== *Dave Alvin \u2013 vocals, guitar *Chris Gaffney \u2013 background vocals *Bob Glaub \u2013 bass *Patrick Warren \u2013 keyboards *Don Heffington \u2013 drums, percussion *David Piltch \u2013 bass, double bass *Greg Leisz \u2013 guitar, slide guitar, pedal steel guitar, background vocals ==Production notes== *Mark Linett \u2013 engineer, mixing *Craig Parker Adams - recording engineer *Joe Gastwirt \u2013 mastering *Lou Beach \u2013 design *Issa Sharp \u2013 photography ==References== Category:2004 albums Category:Dave Alvin albums Category:Yep Roc Records albums ",
