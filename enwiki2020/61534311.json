    "text": "Venice Days (Italian: Le Giornate degli Autori) is an independent film festival section held in parallel to and in association with Venice Film Festival. It is modeled on Directors' Fortnight at Cannes Film Festival. Anac and 100autori are engaged to support and promote Venice Days. It was founded in 2004 by Giorgio Gosetti. Venice Days' goal, similarly to that of Directors' Fortnight's, is to balance the star studded main event more sensational approach with drawing attention to high quality authors' cinema, specifically the one that represents innovative, original and independent take on moviemaking. With Villa Degli Autori as its center hub and headquarters during the event Venice Days' ambition is also to create an \"informal and free space for authors, producers, distributors and journalists to meet and discuss their ideas\". The program usually includes 11 competition films and the closing- night film which all, in addition to special screenings and additional events, are screened at Venice Film Festival theaters and venues. Venice Days started in 2004 with zero budget, three months to organize and, as Venice Days' director and founder Giorgio Gosetti put it, one common goal: \"to go well beyond the simple showcase of films in the official selection and offer a bright window to the work of directors.\" The president of Venice Days is Andrea Purgatori. Honorary President is Roberto Barzanti. == Awards == * Giornate degli Autori Award * BNL People's Choice Award for the Official Selection's films * Label Europa Cinemas * Luigi De Laurentiis Award Lion of the Future == References == Category:Venice Film Festival ",
