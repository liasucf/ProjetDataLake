    "text": "Hatchet Warrior is the second studio album by American rapper Anybody Killa. The album went through various name changes before release, including \"Foo Dang\" and \"Psychopathic Warrior\". Released in 2003, it is the rapper's first release under Psychopathic Records. It peaked at #4 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart, #42 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #98 on the Billboard 200. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote that \"Lines like 'Shootin' off my arrows like AKs' and broad references to the 'native hydro' -- which may or may not be peyote -- make ABK's act seem gimmicky, not menacing, and certainly don't establish him as a new voice in Native American hip-hop\". ==Background== Anybody Killa made his first appearance in the Juggalo world on the Dark Lotus song Drunken Ninja Master which was featured on Twiztid's Cryptic Collection Vol. 2 album. He then went on to have multiple appearances on Blaze Ya Dead Homie's debut album 1 Less G n da Hood, and with the overwhelmingly positive response from the fans, Anybody Killa recorded the album from 2002 through early 2003. ==Legacy== Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote that \"Lines like 'Shootin' off my arrows like AKs' and broad references to the 'native hydro' -- which may or may not be peyote -- make ABK's act seem gimmicky, not menacing, and certainly don't establish him as a new voice in Native American hip-hop\". On January 6, 2017 it was announced that while on his 2017 April Fools Foolin' Tour (accompanied by Mr. Y.U.G., Mad V, Jay Villain) he will also be doing a Hatchet Warrior Show (doing the album in its entirety) at select shows and on those shows he will be accompanied by Michigan based rapper Skitzo. ==Track listing== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text-align:center; width:30px;\"|# ! style=\"text-align:center; width:145px;\"|Title ! style=\"text-align:center; width:20px;\"|Time ! style=\"text-align:center; width:135px;\"|Lyrics ! style=\"text-align:center; width:100px;\"|Music ! style=\"text-align:center; width:135px;\"|Featured performer(s) |- |1 |\"Intro\" |1:20 |James Lowery |Mike Puwal | |- |2 |\"Close Call\" |1:29 |James Lowery |Mike Puwal | |- |3 |\"Kill Me\" |2:12 |Jamie Spaniolo |Fritz \"the Cat\" Van Kosky Monoxide | |- |4 |\"Sticky Icky Situations\" |4:04 |James Lowery Chris Rouleau Joseph Bruce Esham Smith |Mike P.
