It is a vertical pipe intended to distribute water to multiple levels of a building or structure as a component of the fire suppression systems. Most buildings have a \"wet riser\" or \"wet standpipe\" system where the pipes are kept full of water for manual or automatic fire fighting operations. Dry risers are used when the water pressure of a building wouldn't be enough for fire suppression and in unheated buildings where the pipes could freeze. In the UK, dry risers must allow fire engine access within 18 m of the dry riser inlet box.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/832631/Approved_Document_B__fire_safety__volume_1_-_2019_edition.pdf Dry risers in occupied buildings must be within a fire-resistant shaft, usually one of a building's fire escape staircase enclosures. The riser is also where the gauges, valves, and alarm devices are located. Depending on regional nomenclature, the term \"dry riser\" may refer to a standpipe, intended to provide water to fire hose connections, or a vertical main pipe in an automatic dry pipe fire sprinkler system. A dry standpipe has an external fire department connection at ground level, such as a Storz coupling, through which water can be pumped from the fire engine pump to the fire hose attachments on each floor. A dry pipe fire sprinkler system is a network of pipes connected to fixed sprinklers inside a building, which is full of air until one of the sprinklers is triggered. ==See also== * Fire fighting * Fire sprinkler * Siamese connection * Standpipe (firefighting) ==References== Category:Fire suppression Category:Plumbing ",
