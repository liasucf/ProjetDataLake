He chops down a small topped tree which happens to be the winter home of two chipmunks Chip and Dale who follow him back to the cabin. After Donald places the log in the fireplace, while Donald is looking for the matches Chip and Dale get their nuts out of the log but it's too late. lights it, and is warming himself by the fire, the chipmunks sneak in behind his back, extinguish the fire, and blatantly carry the log out of the cabin in front of Donald. A slightly amused Donald easily takes it from them as they leave the cabin. The chipmunks later climb the roof and throw snowballs down the chimney in order to extinguish Donald's fire. Donald climbs up the chimney, rolls the chipmunks into a snowball and rolls them off the roof. Coming up with a new plan, Chip whispers in Dale's ear. Dale listens intently, and nods, agreeing to the plan. Chip climbs a steep hill directly in front of the front door of Donald's cabin and rolls a snowball down the hill. Dale laughs and knocks on the door to get Donald to answer. As the snowball rolls down the hill, it gets bigger and gains momentum. Finally Donald answers the door just as the massive snowball hits. Chip and Dale then retrieve their log, and as they are leaving, Dale takes an opportunity to kick Donald as he is helplessly embedded in the snow having his rear exposed. ==Voice cast== * Chip: Jimmy MacDonald * Dale: Dessie Flynn * Donald Duck: Clarence Nash ==Home media== *\"Chip 'n' Dale (with Donald Duck)\" (VHS) *\"Starring Chip 'n' Dale\" (DVD) *\"The Chronological Donald, Volume Three\" (DVD) ==Notes== Category:Donald Duck short films Category:Disney animated short films, 1940s Category:Films directed by Jack Hannah Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:1947 animated films Category:1947 films Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace Category:1940s American animated films Category:American films ",
