    "text": "The Brac\u0142aw Voivodeship (; ) was a unit of administrative division of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Created in 1566 as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, it was passed to the Crown of Poland in 1569 following the Union of Lublin. After partitions of Poland in 1793 the voivodeship was taken by the Russian Empire and replaced with the Bratslav Viceroyalty. In 1648-57 the territory of voivodeship was a part of Cossack Hetmanate following the Khmelnytsky Uprising and Truce of Andrusovo, while in 1672-99 it became part of Ottoman Ukraine which was a vassal Ottoman Empire (see: Treaty of Buchach and Treaty of Karlowitz). ==Overview== Together with the Podole Voivodeship it formed the historical province of Podolia and part of a bigger Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Officially, the capital of the voivodeship was in Braclaw (today Bratslav), but local voivodes also resided in Winnica (Vinnytsia). It was divided into County of Braclaw and County of Winnica. The County of Braclaw itself was divided into two districts\u2014Braclaw and Zwinogrodek (some sources claim there was a separate County of Zwinogrodek). In 1791, the Great Sejm also created Boh County (Polish: powiat nadbohski), but it was never created due to the Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792. Braclaw Voivodeship had two senators\u2014the Voivode and the Castellan of Braclaw. It also had six deputies to the Sejm\u2014two from Braclaw County, two from Winnica County, and two from District of Zwinogrodek. Local sejmiks took place in Winnica. Today the region belongs to Ukraine and Transnistria in Moldova. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of Braclaw Voivodeship: > After the Union of Lublin, the province of Podolia was annexed by the > Kingdom of Poland. Soon afterwards, Ukrainian Podolia, located lower than > Podole Voivodeship, between the Dniestr and the Boh rivers, was turned into > Braclaw Voivodeship. It had three castles at Braclaw, Winnica and Zwinogrod > (...) In 1570, a special royal commission was created to mark the borders of > the voivodeship. Its western boundary was marked by the Murachwa river, and > in the southeast, it was separated from Wallachia by the Dniestr. The > commission marked northern border of the voivodeship along the Black Tatar > Trail, and to settle arguments between Braclaw and Kijow Voivodeships, King > Stefan Batory in 1584 stated that boundary line was to be marked by the > Uhorski Tykicz river (...) > In the late 16th century, most of Braclaw Voivodeship was a depopulated wild > field. Political and social life existed only in the agricultural belt, > located in the immediate vicinity of royal castles. Settlers however began > to move into the desert, even along southern border of the province, in the > area called Pobereze (...) After the Union of Lublin, when Ukrainian lands > were annexed by the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, life became more > organized, with Polish-style starostas, voivodes, nobility, sejmiks, and > courts (...) > The County of Winnica was smaller, but more populated. It had the area of > 200 sq. miles, in northwestern corner of the voivodeship, along the Boh > river. The County of Braclaw had the area of 420 sq. miles, and consisted of > two districts - Braclaw and Zwinogrod. The district of Zwinogrod covered the > desert of the Blue Waters (see also Battle of Blue Waters), but due to > destruction of the Zwinogrod Castle, it did not emerge as a separate county > (...) In 1584, Stefan Batory divided this area between Braclaw and Kijow > Voivodeship, along the Uhorski Tykicz river (...) > In 1569, first voivode of Braclaw was Prince Roman Sanguszko, while first > castellan was Knyaz Jedrzej Kapusta. In 1589 Polish Sejm ordered that all > official documents in Braclaw Voivodeship should be written in Old East > Slavic language (...) The voivodeship had two senators (the voivode and the > castellan of Braclaw), six deputies to the Sejm, and two deputies to the > Lesser Poland Tribunal at Lublin. Furthermore, like in neighbouring Podole > Voivodeship, Braclaw had its own border judges, who cooperated with > officials of the Ottoman Porte and the Crimean Khanate, solving conflicts > between citizens of the two countries (...) > In 1598 the Sejm ordered that all courts and sejmiks be moved from Braclaw > to Winnica. As a result, Winnica came to be regarded the capital of the > voivodeship. Since in the 18th century the population of the region grew, in > 1791 the Sejm created another county, called Boh County, increasing number > of deputies from the voivodeship from six to eight. After the Partitions of > Poland, Russian authorities created Braclaw Governorate (1793 - 1796), whose > lands were then divided between Podolia Governorate, Volhynian Governorate, > and Kiev Governorate (...) > According to the 1625 census, Braclaw Voivodeship had 285 villages, but its > population grew so fast that in the early 1790s, the number of villages grew > to 1,500 (...) Before the Union of Lublin, there were some 30 castles, forts > and strongholds in the province. Fifty years after the union, the number of > castles grew significantly. Most of them were private, with the strongest > one being Uman (...) In the 18th century, the voivodeship had several grand > residences of Polish magnates, among them was Zofiowka of the Potocki > family, located in close proximity to Uman. ==Municipal government== Voivodeship Governor (Wojewoda) seat: * Brac\u0142aw (Bratslav) Regional council (sejmik generalny) for all Ruthenian lands * S\u0105dowa Wisznia (Sudova Vyshnia) Regional council (sejmik poselski i deputacki) seats: * Winnica (Vinnytsia) ==Administrative division== * Brac\u0142aw County (Powiat brac\u0142awski), Brac\u0142aw (Bratslav) * Winnica County (Powiat winnicki), Winnica (Vinnytsia) * Zwinogrodek District or Zwinogrodek County (powiat zwinogrodzki), * Boh County (powiat nadbohski), created in 1791, ==Voivodes== * Roman Sanguszko (16th century) * Aleksander Zas\u0142awski (1628\u2013?) * Stanis\u0142aw \"Rewera\" Potocki (1631\u20131636) * Adam Kisiel (1647\u2013?) * Andrzej Potocki (1662\u2013?) * Stanis\u0142aw Lubomirski (1764\u2013?) ==Neighbouring Voivodeships and regions== * Podole Voivodeship * Kij\u00f3w Voivodeship * Jedysan * Moldavia ==Sources== * Braclaw Voivodeship, description by Zygmunt Gloger *Central European Superpower, Henryk Litwin, BUM Magazine, October 2016.
