It receives Slippery Rock Creek from the northwest near Ellwood City, then joins the Beaver west of Ellwood City, approximately 3 mi (5 km) further downstream. ==Watershed== Connoquenessing Creek in Butler, Pennsylvania In 2000, a scientific study was conducted to determine the health of the creek. Researchers discovered that only the Mississippi River received more toxic materials than the Connoquenessing, making the small river the second most polluted waterway in the United States. \"The Armco Inc. steel facility in Butler, purchased last September [1999] by AK Steel, ranked first nationally for the amount of pollutant discharges. The steelmaker legally discharged more than 29 million pounds of nitrate compounds -- a waste produced when nitric acid is used to \"pickle\" or clean the surface of raw steel\u2014into Connoquenessing Creek.\" However, as of 2010, the Connoquenessing Creek was not listed in the national Top 10 for polluted waterways. Also, as of 2010, Armco Inc. steel in Butler was not listed in the Top 20 in regards to national pollutant dischargers.Butler, Kiera (2012-04-02). \"America\u2019s Top 10 Most- Polluted Waterways\" Mother Jones (magazine) Retrieved 2020-01-23. The creek is a popular canoeing and kayaking destination, with many boaters entering the creek at various locations. ==See also== *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== ==External links== *U.S. Geological Survey: PA stream gaging stations *Penn State Univ.: Geology of Butler County Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Beaver River Category:Rivers of Beaver County, Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Butler County, Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania ",
