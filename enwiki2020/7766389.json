    "text": "\"Children, Kinder, Enfants\" (English translation: \"Children, Children, Children\") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1985, performed in French (with some words in English and German) by Margo, Franck Olivier, Diane Solomon, Ireen Sheer, Malcolm and Chris Roberts. This group is for obvious reasons sometimes referred to as \"The Internationals\"; Margo is Dutch, Franck Olivier is Luxembourgian (the 4th Luxembourgish representative to actually be native to the Grand Duchy following the entrants of 1960/62, 1971 and 1984), Diane Solomon is American, Ireen Sheer is British, the late Malcolm Roberts (1944-2003IMDB.com, Chris Roberts) was British and Chris Roberts (1944-2017) was German. This was Ireen Sheer's third participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, in 1974 she represented Luxembourg with \"Bye Bye I Love You\" and in 1978 she sang \"Feuer\" for Germany. The song - a Ralph Siegel-Bernd Meinunger collaboration - is an up-tempo number in which the singers describe the unique qualities of children and ask the children of the world to teach them how to enjoy life properly. The group also recorded the song in English and German and as a multilingual French/English/German medley. The song was performed eighteenth on the night (following Austria's Gary Lux with \"Kinder dieser Welt\" and preceding Greece's Takis Biniaris with \"Miazume\"). At the close of voting, it had received 37 points, placing 13th in a field of 19. It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1986 Contest by Sherisse Laurence with \"L'amour de ma vie\". ==Sources and external links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1985 * Detailed info & lyrics, The Diggiloo Thrush, \"Children, Kinder, Enfants\". ==References== Category:Eurovision songs of Luxembourg Category:Songs written by Ralph Siegel Category:Songs written by Bernd Meinunger Category:Eurovision songs of 1985 Category:1985 songs ",
