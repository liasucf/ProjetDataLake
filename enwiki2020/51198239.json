    "text": "The 1993\u201394 Courage League National Division Three was the seventh full season of rugby union within the third tier of the English league system, currently known as National League 1. Following a reduction in size of the top four divisions of the league from thirteen to ten, the teams now play each other twice, home and away instead of just once. Following their relegation last season, Coventry won the division and return to National Division Two for next season. They are joined by the runner-up, Fylde, who were also relegated last season. Havant and Redruth are both relegated to National Four. Havant were runners-up last season and would have been promoted to National Division Two if the leagues had not been re-organised. == Participating teams and locations == Owing to a reduction from thirteen teams to ten in the top four divisions of the national leagues, only three teams participated in National Division Three last season, Exeter, Havant and Redruth. The remaining seven teams all played in National Division Two last season. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=100% |- !Team !Ground !Capacity !City/Area !Previous season |- | Bedford || Goldington Road || 7,000 || Bedford, Bedfordshire || Relegated from Courage League Division 2 (7th) |- | Blackheath || Rectory Field || 6,000 || Greenwich, London || Relegated from Courage League Division 2 (10th) |- | Coventry || Coundon Road || 9,000 || Coventry, West Midlands || Relegated from Courage League Division 2 (11th) |- | Exeter || County Ground || 5,200 || Exeter, Devon || 3rd |- | Fylde || Woodlands || 9,000 || Lytham St Annes, Lancashire || Relegated from Courage League Division 2 (12th) |- | Havant || Hook's Lane || 1,500 || Havant, Hampshire || 2nd (not promoted) |- | Morley || Scatcherd Lane || || Morley, Leeds, West Yorkshire || Relegated from Courage League Division 2 (13th) |- | Redruth || Recreation Ground || 12,000 || Redruth, Cornwall || 4th |- | Richmond || Athletic Ground || 4,500 || Richmond, London || Relegated from Courage League Division 2 (9th) |- | Rosslyn Park || The Rock || 2,000 || Roehampton, London || Relegated from Courage League Division 2 (8th) |- |} ==League table== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- |colspan=\"15\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"|1993\u201394 Courage League National Division Three Table |- !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"195\"|Club !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Played !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Won !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Drawn !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Lost !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points for !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points against !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points diff !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points |-style=\"background-color:#d8ffeb;text-align:center;\" | 1 ||align=left| Coventry || 18 || 14 || 0 || 4 || 406 || 259 || 147 || 28 |-style=\"background-color:#d8ffeb;text-align:center;\" | 2 ||align=left| Fylde || 18 || 13 || 0 || 5 || 339 || 219 || 120 || 26 |- | 3 || align=left| Bedford || 18 || 12 || 0 || 6 || 332 || 260 || 72 || 24 |- | 4 ||align=left| Blackheath || 18 || 11 || 0 || 7 || 305 || 222 || 83 || 22 |- | 5 || align=left| Rosslyn Park || 18 || 10 || 1 || 7 || 372 || 240 || 132 || 21 |- | 6 ||align=left| Exeter || 18 || 9 || 1 || 8 || 308 || 271 || 37 || 19 |- | 7 || align=left| Richmond || 18 || 9 || 0 || 9 || 337 || 300 || 37 || 18 |- | 8 || align=left| Morley || 18 || 6 || 0 || 12 || 245 || 334 || \u221289 || 12 |- style=\"background:#fcc; text-align:center;\" | 9 || align=left| Havant || 18 || 3 || 0 || 15 || 203 || 432 || \u2212229 || 6 |- style=\"background:#fcc; text- align:center;\" | 10 || align=left| Redruth || 18 || 2 || 0 || 16 || 178 || 488 || \u2212310 || 4 |- |colspan=\"15\"| * Points are awarded as follows: # 2 pts for a win # 1 pt for a draw # 0 pts for a loss |- |colspan=\"15\"| * If teams are level at any stage, the following tiebreaker is applied: # Difference between points for and against |- |-|align=left| |colspan=\"15\" style=\"border:0px;font- size:85%;\"| Green background are promotion places.
