    "text": "Chepstow railway station is a part of the British railway system owned by Network Rail and is operated by Transport for Wales. Chepstow station is on the Gloucester to Newport Line. It is from the town centre, at Station Road. Chepstow is a historic walled border town and ancient port, situated at the southern end of the Wye Valley, two hours from London. The line continues east from the station to Gloucester over the Chepstow railway bridge. It was formerly the junction station for the Wye Valley Railway to Monmouth Troy station until this line closed to passengers in 1959. The railway now consists of a double track line with a trailing crossover to the east of the station, plus some disused track in the former yard. ==Description== The cast-iron footbridge (2017) The single-storey buildings on the Gloucester/Birmingham side of the line are stone and timber-built structures, in an Italianate style. They were completed in 1850 for Isambard Kingdom Brunel's South Wales Railway, and according to architectural historian John Newman were designed by N. Lancaster Owen.John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p.184 A canopy provides shelter. On the more popular Newport/Cardiff side, there is just a small modern shelter. Access to this platform is via a cast-iron footbridge, making it difficult for passengers with pushchairs and the old and the infirm to cross. The footbridge is a now- rare survival of a typical GWR iron pattern, still with its wooden cladding and canopy, and is Grade II listed. It was cast in Edward Finch's ironworks, adjoining the station. Other Grade II listings at the station include the two bridges: the surviving piers and abutment of the Chepstow Railway Bridge, and the bridge providing access to the steam mill and ironworks site. ==Services== A CrossCountry service from Nottingham to Cardiff The local rail service is sporadic, running an hourly service in each direction. A local campaign has been established, with the support of the local MP, Welsh Assembly members, County Council and town council, to improve rail services to the town.
