He was probably the successor of Kanishka III and may have been succeeded by a king named Shaka Kushan. Vasudeva II probably only was a local ruler in the area of Taxila, in western Punjab, under the suzerainty of the Gupta Empire. Vasudeva II was a contemporary of Hormizd I Kushanshah of the Kushano-Sasanians, as he is known to have overstruck a large quantity of the early copper coins of Hormizd I issued south of the Hindu- Kush.
