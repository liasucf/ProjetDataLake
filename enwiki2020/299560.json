    "text": "Andrew Chi-Chih Yao (; born December 24, 1946) is a Chinese computer scientist and computational theorist. He is currently a Professor and the Dean of Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University. Yao used the minimax theorem to prove what is now known as Yao's Principle. Yao was a naturalized U.S. citizen, and worked for many years in the U.S., but in 2015, together with Yang Chen-Ning he renounced his U.S. citizenship and became an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ==Early life== Yao was born in Shanghai, China. He completed his undergraduate education in physics at the National Taiwan University, before completing a Doctor of Philosophy in physics at Harvard University in 1972, and then a second PhD in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 1975. ==Academic career== He was an assistant professor at MIT (1975\u20131976), assistant professor at Stanford University (1976\u20131981), and professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1981\u20131982). From 1982 to 1986, he was a full professor at Stanford University. From 1986 to 2004, he was the William and Edna Macaleer Professor of Engineering and Applied Science at Princeton University, where he continued to work on algorithms and complexity. In 2004, he became a Professor of the Center for Advanced Study, Tsinghua University (CASTU) and the Director of the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS), Tsinghua University in Beijing. Since 2010, he has served as the Dean of Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) in Tsinghua University. He is also the Distinguished Professor-at-Large in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ==Awards== In 1996 he was awarded the Knuth Prize. He received the Turing Award, the most prestigious award in computer science, in 2000, \"in recognition of his fundamental contributions to the theory of computation, including the complexity-based theory of pseudorandom number generation, cryptography, and communication complexity\". He is a member of U.S. National Academy of Sciences, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, and an academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences. His wife, Frances Yao, is also a theoretical computer scientist. == See also == * Yao's principle * Dolev-Yao model * Important publications in cryptography * Yao's test * Yao's Millionaires' Problem * Yao graph * Garbled circuit == References == == External links == * Andrew Yao at CASTU * * Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American scientists Category:20th-century Chinese scientists Category:21st-century American scientists Category:21st-century Chinese scientists Category:American computer scientists Category:American emigrants to China Category:American people of Shanghainese descent Category:American scientists of Chinese descent Category:Chinese computer scientists Category:Chinese emigrants to the United States Category:Chinese University of Hong Kong people Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery Category:Harvard University alumni Category:International Association for Cryptologic Research fellows Category:Knuth Prize laureates Category:Members of Academia Sinica Category:Members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:National Taiwan University alumni Category:Naturalized citizens of the People's Republic of China Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:People who lost United States citizenship Category:Princeton University faculty Category:Scientists from Shanghai Category:Stanford University Department of Computer Science faculty Category:Tsinghua University faculty Category:Turing Award laureates Category:University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign alumni Category:UC Berkeley College of Engineering faculty ",
