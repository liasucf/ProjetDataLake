    "text": "The Canon RF lens mount is an interchangeable-lens mount developed by Canon for its full-frame mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras, and featured first by the EOS R, followed by the EOS RP. The RF mount was announced in September 2018. The RF mount allows for the use of Canon EF and EF-S mount lenses using one of three Canon-made lens adapters. ==Details== Canon full-frame cameras have used the EF lens mount since 1987. In comparison with that mount, the RF mount's inner diameter is the same at 54 mm. The RF mount's flange focal distance at 20 mm is much shorter than that of the Canon EF and EF-S mounts at 44 mm. The EF-M mount has a flange focal distance of 18 mm. An EF-EOS R lens adapter enables Canon EF, EF-S, TS-E and MP-E lenses to be used on cameras that have the RF mount. The three adapters have differing features: * Mount Adapter EF-EOS R * Control Ring Mount Adapter EF-EOS R \u2013 the Mount Adapter EF- EOS R with a lens control ring * Drop-In Filter Mount Adapter EF-EOS R \u2013 the Mount Adapter EF-EOS R with the ability to use drop-in filters, either a variable neutral density (V-ND) filter or circular polarising (C-PL) filter, and a clear (CL) filter, to be released in 2019 The EOS R is a 30 megapixel (6720 \u00d7 4480) full-frame camera. If an EF-EOS R Mount Adapter is used with it to mount an EF-S lens, the camera will function as an 11.6 megapixel (4176 \u00d7 2784) crop camera. ==Lenses== At the time Canon announced its first R-series body, it announced four new RF-mount lenses: * Canon RF 24\u2013105 mm 4 L IS USM * Canon RF 28\u201370 mm 2 L USM * Canon RF 50 mm 1.2 L USM * Canon RF 35 mm 1.8 IS STM Macro \u2013 0.5x maximum magnification. In conjunction with the February 2019 announcement of the entry-level full-frame EOS RP, Canon announced that six additional lenses would be released by the end of that year, although it did not indicate release dates for any of them: * Canon RF 85 mm 1.2L USM * Canon RF 85 mm 1.2L USM DS \u2014 Same as the above, except includes \"defocus smoothing\" technology intended to improve bokeh. According to Canon, the effect is similar to that of an apodization filter, but achieved through special lens coatings instead of a filter. * Canon RF 24\u201370 mm 2.8L IS USM * Canon RF 15\u201335 mm 2.8L IS USM * Canon RF 70\u2013200 mm 2.8L IS USM * Canon RF 24\u2013240 mm 4\u20136.3 IS USM In 2020, Canon has announced 5 new RF mount lenses: * Canon RF 24\u2013105 mm 4\u20137.1 IS STM * Canon RF 100\u2013500 mm 4.5\u20137.1L IS USM * Canon RF 600 mm 11 IS STM \u2014 fixed-aperture lens * Canon RF 800 mm 11 IS STM \u2014 fixed-aperture lens * Canon RF 85 mm 2 Macro IS STM - 0.5x maximum magnification RF-mount lenses are not compatible with EF, EF-S or EF-M mount camera bodies. ==Compatibility== The cameras that can use the RF mount are: * Canon EOS R * Canon EOS RP * Canon EOS Ra * Canon EOS R5 * Canon EOS R6 == Canon RF-mount lenses == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- style=\"background:#CCCCCC\" !
