St. Mary's Minor Seminary is a Catholic senior secondary boarding school in Zambia, run by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chipata. The minor seminary is situated from the Chipata\u2013Chadiza Road. ==History and operations== The school is sometimes called new St. Mary's because it is the second seminary after the sale of the St. Mary's which was situated along Malawi Road. The new seminary was opened in 1980 by late Cardinal Medardo Joseph Mazombwe, then-Bishop of the Chipata Diocese, with the sole aim of raising up young men that would proceed to the Major seminary to pursue diocesan priesthood. ==Symbols== * The chapel symbolises the centrality of prayer and all spiritual activities of the seminary. * The hoe symbolises the hard work that the boys should cultivate. * The chalice and the Eucharist: celebration of Mass that should be the centre of life of every seminarian and a reminder that he is called to be a priest to offer mass for the people. * Motto: Ora et Labora (\"Pray and Work\") ==See also== * Education in Zambia * List of boarding schools * List of Roman Catholic seminaries * List of schools in Zambia * Roman Catholicism in Zambia Category:1980 establishments in Africa Category:1980s establishments in Zambia Category:Boarding schools in Zambia Category:Boys' schools in Zambia Category:Educational institutions established in 1980 Category:Private schools in Zambia Category:Catholic Church in Zambia Category:Catholic minor seminaries Category:Catholic secondary schools in Africa Category:Secondary schools in Zambia ",
