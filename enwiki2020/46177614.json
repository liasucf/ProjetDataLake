According to Qu\u00e9ruel (p. 21), the stage name originally chosen by the singer, \"M. La\u00ffs\" (no doubt pronounced 'la-\u00ecs' and whose diaeresis would eventually be dropped), was intended to avoid puns on his original surname, pronounced 'la-\u00ec' in Occitan but running the risk of being interpreted differently by French-speakers, probably as 'l\u00e8' , the same as the word \"laid\" (ugly). (14 February 1758 \u2013 30 March 1831The date 27 March is attested in the biography by Anne Qu\u00e9ruel. On the other hand, F\u00e9tis, Pitou and Elizabeth Forbes give the date of his death as 30 March.), was a French baritone and tenor opera singer. Originally destined for a career in the church, Lays was recruited by the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1779. He soon became a leading member of the company, in spite of quarrels with the management. Lays enthusiastically welcomed the French Revolution and became involved in politics with the encouragement of his friend Bertrand Bar\u00e8re. Bar\u00e8re's downfall led to Lays being imprisoned briefly, but he soon won back the public and secured the patronage of Napoleon, at whose coronation and second wedding he sang. This association with the Emperor caused him trouble when the Bourbon monarchy was restored and Lays's final years were darkened by disputes over his pension, mounting debts, the death of his only son and his wife's illness. After a career spanning more than four decades, he died in poverty. Lays was famous for the beauty of his voice. One of the Op\u00e9ra's most popular artistes, he enjoyed his greatest success singing comic roles, such as Anacreon in Gr\u00e9try's Anacr\u00e9on chez Polycrate (1797) and the bailiff in Lebrun's Le rossignol (1816). ==Biography== ===Youth and education=== Lays was born in the village of La Barthe-de-Neste in the region of Bigorre in what was then Gascony. His family intended him for a career in the Church at the Sanctuary of Notre-Dame-de-Garaison (Monl\u00e9on-Magnoac), where he stayed until he was 17, receiving a solid musical education as a chorister and developing a remarkable baritenor voice. He was transferred to Auch for a short while to study philosophy and work as a teacher before returning to Garaison to study theology.F\u00e9tis, op.cit. In 1778, the canons of the convent gave Lays a grant to study for a doctorate in theology in Toulouse. Lays was now determined to abandon a career in the Church and became increasingly active as a singer, joining the cathedral choir and accepting invitations to perform at local salons. In Toulouse, Lays formed a lifelong friendship with the young lawyer Bertrand Bar\u00e8re, the future French Revolutionary politician and member of the Committee of Public Safety. Bar\u00e8re introduced Lays to the city's Enlightenment circles. On Easter Sunday 1779, Lays was singing the liturgy in the cathedral when he was heard by the Intendant Royal of Languedoc. Following the recruitment practice then used by Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique (the Paris Op\u00e9ra), the Intendant decided to issue Lays with a royal ordinance (equivalent to a lettre de cachet) obliging him to travel to Paris for an audition.Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 18 ff. ===Early career=== Lays was immediately enrolled in the company as one of the lower male voices (known in France at the time as basse-tailles) and began a rapid ascent up the Op\u00e9ra career ladder. He was first introduced to the Parisian public on 10 October 1779, singing the aria \"Sous les lois de l'hymen\" by Pierre Montan Berton to great applause (it had been inserted into the acte de ballet La Proven\u00e7ale by Jean-Joseph Mouret and Pierre-Joseph CandeilleQu\u00e9ruel, p. 7. La Proven\u00e7ale was an entr\u00e9e added in 1722 by Jean-Joseph Mouret to his op\u00e9ra-ballet Les Festes de Thalie. It remained popular throughout the 18th century. In 1778 most of the entr\u00e9e was set to new music by Candeille to be given as part of a performance of \"fragments\" (also called \"spectacles coup\u00e9s\") which were very common in the latter half of the 18th century, or as an intermezzo to the opere buffe by Italian composers the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique was staging at the time.). He made his official debut on the 31st of the same month, playing Th\u00e9ophile in a revival of \"Th\u00e9odore\", the second entr\u00e9e from \u00c9tienne-Joseph Floquet's L'union de l'amour et des arts.Jullien, pp. 90\u201391. Having stepped in as a substitute in the role of Oreste in Gluck's Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride,Castil-Blaze, L'Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique (3e \u00e9poque \u2013 6e article), \"Revue de Paris\", New series, Year 1837, 37th volume, p. 23 (accessible for free online at Google Books). in 1780 he was given the first new roles of his career: a follower of Morpheus in Piccinni's Atys; the male protagonist in the unsuccessful acte de ballet Laure et P\u00e9trarque by Candeille;George Grove, Lays [Lai, La\u00efs, Lay], Fran\u00e7ois, in Stanley Sadie (ed.), John Tyrrell (ed.), The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2\u00aa ed., Oxford University Press, 2001, . and the bailiff in Floquet's Le seigneur bienfaisant, Lays's first big success.F\u00e9tis, op.cit.; Pitou, p. 493 (article: Le Seigneur bienfaisant). F\u00e9tis writes that the role was specifically composed with Lays in mind, whereas the 1781 libretto ascribes the character to another basse-taille of the company, M. Durand (Le Seigneur bienfaisant, Op\u00e9ra, compos\u00e9 des actes du Pressoir ou des F\u00e8tes de l'Automne, de l'Incendie, et du Bal, Paris, aux d\u00e9pens de l'Acad\u00e9mie, 1881, p. 8, accessible online at Google Books). The review published by the \"Mercure de France\" reports that Lays did in fact appear at the premiere and the audience did not appreciate the long arietta he sung: his performance, however, was much praised by the reviewer (\"Mercure de France\", 30 December 1780, pp. 222\u2013223, accessible online at Google Books). Between 1780 and 1791, he was a member of two of the main musical institutions at court, the Concerts de la reine (the Queen's concerts) and the King's Grand Couvert,Literally meaning 'a gala dinner', the term refers to the Versailles custom of performing music on the occasions when the royal couple had dinner in public in the antechamber of the Grand Couvert. The custom had been introduced by Marie Antoinette who wished to relieve the boredom of the public dinner ceremonial (cf. Chateau de Versailles website). soon becoming a favourite of the royal couple, and in particular of Marie Antoinette.Qu\u00e9ruel, Tableau chronologique, pp. 165\u2013171. His early career at the Op\u00e9ra was quite turbulent. The institution at the time was seething with discontent: the artistes resented the fact their wages were only a third of those of the actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise and the Com\u00e9die- Italienne; moreover, their pay was only partly fixed and permanent, the rest being linked to how frequently they appeared on stage and the size of their roles. The rebellious Lays soon became embroiled in a heated confrontation with the management, behaving almost like a modern union agitator, with the support of two singers who had joined the company around the same time, the haute-contre Sources traditionally report only the initial letter (J.) of this singer's name; full details, however, can be found in \"Organico dei fratelli a talento della Loggia parigina di Saint-Jean d'\u00c9cosse du Contrat Social (1773-89)\" (list of the members of this Masonic lodge), reported as an Appendix in Zeffiro Ciuffoletti and Sergio Moravia (eds), La Massoneria. La storia, gli uomini, le idee, Milan, Mondadori, 2004, . and the bass Auguste- Athanase Ch\u00e9ron (1760\u20131829). In June 1781, fire destroyed the second hall of the Palais Royal, the home of the theatre, causing performances to be suspended. This left the singers with only their meagre basic salaries, so the three decided to remedy the situation by accepting engagements elsewhere, even though they were prohibited by law from doing so as salaried artistes of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique. Rousseau alone managed to travel to Brussels surreptitiously and appear at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, then the second most important French-speaking theatre in the world. Lays, however, was arrested on the evening of 20 August 1781, the day before he was due to set off, and spent ten days in prison.Prison (or the threat of prison) was a fairly common method of bringing the Op\u00e9ra's intractable artistes to heel. In 1771, for instance, the principal tenor Joseph Legros, believing the role he had been allotted in La Borde's pastorale La Cinquantaine was supremely silly and tasteless, initially refused outright to perform it. However, according to an indignant Mathieu-Fran\u00e7ois Pidansat de Mairobert, he eventually had to bow to La Borde's threat of making him spend a good fifty days in For-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque prison (Louis Petit de Bachaumont et al., M\u00e9moires secrets..., London, Adamson, 1784, 5th tome, p. 296, accessible online at Google Books). Things went even worse for his successor \u00c9tienne Lainez. So deep was his loathing for the title role of Salieri's Tarare (1787), that the Op\u00e9ra's musical director, Louis-Joseph Franc\u0153ur, was only able to persuade him to appear in the sixth performance of the opera by informing him he had a warrant for the singer's arrest in his pocket. This was not enough, however, to prevent Lainez from being imprisoned on 25 November after he had again repeatedly refused to assume the hated role of Tarare (Lajarte, p. 358). He was provisionally released on the 30th because he was indispensable for filling the haute-contre role of Cynire in a revival of Gluck's Echo et NarcisseAccording to Qu\u00e9ruel, in 1781 Lays was going to take the role that had been created two years before by Henri Larriv\u00e9e, the company's leading bass-baritone. In fact, Larriv\u00e9e had not appeared in the premiere of Echo et Narcisse, where there are no bass-baritone leads, and the role of Cynire had been performed by the principal haute-contre Joseph Legros. The versatile Lays was probably just covering for his comrade Rousseau during the emergency created by latter's escape abroad. A hand-written score kept at the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France shows some changes made to the part of Cynire which are expressly designated \"pour Lays\" (for Lays): like the rest of the part, they are notated in the alto clef (C-clef on the third line) which was customarily used for the haute-contre voice. in the small hall of the Menus-Plaisirs which acted as a substitute for the theatre which had burned down. His enormous popularity with the public, with an encore of the main aria and several curtain-calls, made it practically impossible to send him back to prison, although he was forced to sign a solemn undertaking that he would not leave Paris without the express permission of his superiors.Qu\u00e8ruel, Chapter 2, Le rebelle \u2013 1779\u20131788, pp. 25\u201349 (passim) In 1782, the director of the Op\u00e9ra, Antoine Dauvergne, was forced to resign his post and the management of the theatre was assumed by the artists acting as a kind of cooperative. The results were so disastrous that the former director had to be recalled in April 1785, although even then his relationship with the trio of rebel singers did not improve very much. In a report to his superiors,\"Compte rendu des propos ind\u00e9cents tenus dans la s\u00e9ance de l'Academie Royale de Musique du 1er mars 1786\" (Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 37). Dauvergne described Lays as the black sheep of the group, Rousseau as a \"nice young man\", if only he had spent less time in the company of Lays, and Ch\u00e9ron as another \"nice young man\" (with the mind of a twelve-year-old), but scared of the beating Lays and Rousseau had promised him if he betrayed their alliance. In the end, the three had to bow to pressure from the theatre management, although not before being promoted to \"Premiers Sujets\" (leading artistes), the highest rank in the company hierarchy. Youri Carbonnier, Le personnel musical de l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris sous le r\u00e8gne de Louis XVI, \"Histoire, \u00e9conomie et soci\u00e9t\u00e9\", 2003, 22-2, 177-206, p. 192 (accessible online at Pers\u00e9e). ===Revolutionary era=== A long-time FreemasonThe presence of Lays, Rousseau and Ch\u00e9ron at a funeral ceremony held in 1785 by the Paris lodge of Les Neuf S\u0153urs, where they performed a Masonic hymn by Piccinni, is attested by Guillaume Imbert de Boudeaux in Correspondance secr\u00e8te, politique, & litt\u00e9raire (London, Adamson, 1789, XVII, p. 402; accessible for free online at Google Books). According to the website Mus\u00e9e virtuel de la musique ma\u00e7onnique (accessed on 6 May 2015), Lays and Rousseau were members of both Les Neuf S\u0153urs and the lodge of , whereas Ch\u00e9ron was only a member of the former (sources cited: Louis Amiable, Une loge ma\u00e7onnique d'avant 1789, la loge des Neuf S\u0153urs, Paris, Alcan, 1897, pp. 339 and 350, accessible for free online at Internet Archive; Alain Le Bihan, Francs-ma\u00e7ons parisiens du Grand Orient de France (fin du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle), Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale, 1966). and an avid reader of Rousseau, after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 Lays joined the Jacobin Club under the patronage of his old friend Bar\u00e8re.Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 57 and 166. Lays was a passionate believer in the ideals of the Revolution, promoting them among the members of the Op\u00e9ra company, which had been renamed Th\u00e9atre des Arts. This was not enough, however, to prevent his arrest in 1792 as a suspected royalist, on the grounds that he had been a leading singer in the Queen's concerts and the Grand Couvert. Only the timely intervention of Bar\u00e8re secured his release after a single night in prison.Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 66\u201369. It was on Bar\u00e8re's prompting that Lays decided to return to his native Gascony in 1793 as a propagandist for the new Reign of Terror. He was accompanied by his future wife, a young unemployed diamond-polisher named Marie Barb\u00e9. In Girondin Bordeaux, his political alignment with the Montagnards provoked such public hostility that he was forced to slip out of the city without even being able to complete his debut performance at the local theatre. Things went much better in his native region, the newly established d\u00e9partement of Hautes- Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, where the Bar\u00e8re clan were politically dominant and where Lays received a hero's welcome. He returned to Paris in mid-July via Toulouse, thus avoiding the hostile Bordeaux.Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 83\u201389. Back in the capital, he delivered a much applauded speech in front of the Commune of Paris.Michaud, op.cit. Lays's direct involvement in political life went little further than this, but, contrary to the claims of the brothers Michaud and F\u00e9tis, it was enough to cause him unpleasant repercussions when in 1794 the coup of 9 Thermidor and the downfall of Robespierre radically changed the political situation. Lays was branded a \"Terrorist actor\" alongside other leading performers with a Revolutionary past, such as Talma, Dugazon and Antoine Trial; and he was forced to try to defend himself by publishing a pamphlet entitled Lays, artiste du th\u00e9atre des Arts, \u00e0 ses concitoyens. Fran\u00e7ois Gendron, La jeunesse sous Thermidor, Paris, Presses Universitaires de France, 1983, p. 90. According to F\u00e9tis, the pamphlet (said to have become \"excessively rare\", and thus probably not consulted at first hand) had instead been published in 1793 (an octavo of 23 pages), and it is therefore described as a sort of report Lays made on his previous revolutionary activities after his expedition to Gascony. The thesis upheld by Gendron, however, is confirmed by the book Essai d'une bibliographie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du th\u00e9atre, compiled by Joseph De Filippi (Paris, Tresse/Aubry, 1864, p. 170, accessible online at Google Books), where it is stated that the pamphlet was published as an octavo in Paris in the month of Vendemiaire Year III (i.e. in September/October 1794, after the coup of 9 Thermidor Year II), and that through it \"the author tries to justify his political behaviour\". Surprisingly, Qu\u00e9ruel makes no reference to the pamphlet. When a warrant was issued for the arrest of Bar\u00e8re and three of his colleagues from the Committee of Public Safety in March 1795, other associates were implicated in his downfall: Lays was arrested and imprisoned for about four months together with an old friend who had shared his political trajectory \u2013 although his role had been far more prominent \u2013 the painter Jacques-Louis David. After his release on 3 July, Lays had to undergo the ritual humiliation the public was imposing on the \"Terrorist actors\": they were forced to sing the anti-Jacobin hymn \"Le R\u00e9veil du Peuple\", which had just been set to music by a tenor from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Feydeau, Pierre Gaveaux, and which seemed destined to replace the Marseillaise as the main Republican anthem. Antoine Trial, a colleague of Gaveaux from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique who was then in his sixties, had been forced to sing the new hymn kneeling on stage to boos, whistles and jeers from the audience, and had never recovered from the experience, eventually taking his own life with poison.Trial also found it unbearable that he had been dismissed from the political office he had held under the Paris Commune. He remains famous in musical history for giving rise to a new type of French comic tenor, named \"Trial\" after him. Qu\u00e9ruel writes Lays managed to avoid making his return to the stage in Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride, in which his character Oreste sang lines which were a little too suggestive coming from an ex-\"Terrorist\": \"J'ai trahi l'amiti\u00e9, j'ai trahi la nature/Des plus noirs attentats, j'ai combl\u00e9 la mesure\" (\"I have betrayed friendship, betrayed Nature/I have gone to the extreme of blackest deeds\"). On the other hand, according to the memoirs of Count , it was indeed in the role of Oreste that Lays sought to return to the stage. However, the implacable hostility of the audience prevented him from singing a single note and, after an hour of fruitless efforts, he eventually had to be replaced by an understudy.Jean- Nicolas Dufort de Cheverny, M\u00e9moires sur les r\u00e8gnes de Louis XV et Louis XVI et sur la R\u00e9volution (publi\u00e9s avec une introduction et des notes par Robert de Cr\u00e8vec\u0153ur), Paris, Plon, 1882, II, p. 257 (accessible online at Internet Archive). His actual reappearance then took place in a revival of Sacchini's \u0152dipe \u00e0 Colone, in which he sang the far less controversial character of King Theseus. Even then, things did not go smoothly: the audience booed and protested throughout the performance, although this time he was not prevented from completing it. At the end, the leading tenor \u00c9tienne Lainez returned onto the proscenium to sing, as usual, Le R\u00e9veil du Peuple, but he was shouted down and forced to take refuge in the wings. Lays was rowdily summoned back instead. Lainez accompanied his colleague on stage, hoping they would be allowed to sing together, but he was once more driven off by the furious audience, and Lays had to perform solo. No sooner had he managed to get through a couple of verses, however, than he too was driven off by booing, because the audience thought he was unworthy of the words he was singing. The unfortunate Lainez had to retake the stage for a third time to finish the performance. By the end of September, nevertheless, enthusiasm for such post- Revolutionary reprisals had abated and Lays was able to make a triumphant return as the Genius of Fire in Salieri's Tarare, his debut in the role.Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 101 ff. ===The Directory and Napoleonic era=== Lays, in the role of Aristippe in the opera Aristippe by Rodolphe Kreutzer Over the course of 15 years Lays had built a remarkable reputation as a singer. He had been a star at the court of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, before performing at the opening of the Estates General at Versailles in 1789. Later he had sung several works by Gossec at some of the grandest ceremonies of the French Revolution: he had performed in the Te Deum at the F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration on 14 July 1790; he had sung the funeral hymns when Mirabeau's and Voltaire's mortal remains were transferred to the newly established Panth\u00e9on in 1791;According to Qu\u00e9ruel, the hymn performed on the occasion of the transfer of Voltaire's mortal remains, where \" La\u00ffs's superb voice\" rose over Ch\u00e9ron's and Rousseau's responding in chorus, had been set to music by \u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul. However, other sources do not support this information. On the contrary, they are unanimous in attributing to Gossec a Hymne sur la translation du corps de Voltaire au Panth\u00e9on, for voice and brass or for three voices, male choir and band (cf. catalogue of Gossec's works at musicologie.org 2014). and he had sung the Hymne \u00e0 l'\u00catre-supr\u00eame at the Festival of the Supreme Being in June 1794. So it was unsurprising that his career continued to thrive in the new political climate under the government of the Directory. Lays was protected by the strong man of the new regime, Paul Barras, and became friends with his mistress, Josephine de Beauharnais, as well as the man who would become her husband, General Napoleon Bonaparte.Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 107 ff. With such patrons his position over the next two decades was secure. In late 1795, Lays was named Professor of Singing at the newly opened Paris Conservatoire. Four years later he resigned to avoid being involved in the quarrel then raging between the managements of the Conservatoire and the Op\u00e9ra. Qu\u00e9ruel credits Lays with teaching two future stars of the Op\u00e9ra: Madame Ch\u00e9ron and Mademoiselle Armand.Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 109 The latter is a possibility;Provided this is Jos\u00e9phine Armand (1787\u20131859), although still a young girl at the time, and not her better known aunt, Anne-Aim\u00e9e (1774\u20131846), who was professionally active at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique from 1793 to 1801 (Pitou, pp. 50\u201351) and thus unlikely to have attended the Conservatoire in the same period. the formerShe was born Anne Cameroy (1767 \u2013 c. 1862), and married Lays's friend, Auguste-Athanase Ch\u00e9ron. had begun her career in 1784 under the name Mademoiselle Dozon, and is thus unlikely to have attended the Conservatoire more than a decade later. Lays did play a part in promoting her early career: he had auditioned her when she was a young unknown in 1782 and had facilitated her studies, entrusting her to the best singing teachers available. Youri Carbonnier, Le personnel musical de l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris sous le r\u00e8gne de Louis XVI, \"Histoire, \u00e9conomie et soci\u00e9t\u00e9\", 22 February 2003, p. 179 (accessible online at Pers\u00e9e). Qu\u00e9ruel's mistake is probably due to the contents of a letter Lays sent to Cherubini in July 1826 (which is quoted by Qu\u00e9ruel herself on page 156). Aiming to have his pension favourably recalculated, Lays claimed he had discovered two future leading Op\u00e9ra sopranos, but, obviously, no more than one (if any) could possibly be credited to his teaching at the Conservatoire. In January 1797, Lays enjoyed one of the biggest successes of his career when he sang the lead role in Gr\u00e9try's Anacr\u00e9on chez Polycrate. The takings from this opera (9,354 livres on the first night alone) helped rescue the disastrous finances of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la R\u00e9publique et des Arts (as the Op\u00e9ra had been renamed).Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 109 ff. If the quality of his voice was universally admired, his lack of physical elegance, his short and stocky build and the southern accent he never completely managed to lose predisposed Lays to comic rather than dramatic roles, particularly middle-aged buffo characters, in which, \"singing of love and good wine, he proved to be sublime\".Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 112 Anacreon was one such role. Lays played the character again in 1803 in the opera Cherubini dedicated to the ancient Greek poet. A few decades later, Castil-Blaze \u2013 referring to the work by Gr\u00e9try \u2013 commented: > The opera sparkles with charming melodies; the role of Anacreon is the most > beautiful, the most complete ever written for Lays, the marvellous sonority > of whose voice was deployed so well in the ascending virtuoso passage > \"Prends, prends emporte mon or, mes tr\u00e9sors pour jamais.\" The trio \"Livre > ton c\u0153ur \u00e0 l'esp\u00e9rance\" makes a delightful impression.\" (Castil-Blaze, L' > Acad\u00e9mie imp\u00e9riale de musique (...) \u2013 De 1645 \u00e0 1855, Paris, Castil-Blaze, > 1855, II, p. 61)Accessible online at Internet Archive. The year 1798 was a turning point in Lays's private life: Marie Barb\u00e9, with whom he had been living for several years, gave birth to a daughter and Lays, to legitimise the child, decided to marry his companion, even though it was against his father's wishes. Old Lay was furious that his eldest child, who enjoyed a successful career, was marrying a foreign woman with no property. The couple went on to have four more children, including one son who would unwittingly cause Lays enormous grief.Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 116 ff. In the same year, Lays politely refused Napoleon's invitation to join him on his expedition to Egypt. Nevertheless, the pair remained on friendly terms and between 1801 and 1802, Lays \u2013 who had often performed in Josephine's salons \u2013 became chief singer of the Chapel Napoleon had established at the Tuileries under the directorship of Giovanni Paisiello.Queruel, pp. 114 ff. The date of the appointment is not very clear in Qu\u00e9ruel's text: in the final Tableau Chronologique the year 1799 is stated, but this date is evidently inaccurate given that Napoleon became First Consul only at the end of November. In the main part of her book, however, Qu\u00e9ruel also reports a conversation between the singer and the First Consul, during which the latter, proposing Lays's appointment, refers to Paisiello's direction of the Chapel, which only began in January 1802. As such, three years later, on 2 December 1804, Lays was the lead soloist in the music accompanying Napoleon's coronation as emperor. The ensuing celebrations culminated at the H\u00f4tel de Ville on 16 December with Lays and Ch\u00e9ron singing the cantata Trasibule, specially written for the occasion by Henri-Montan Berton.Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 125\u201329 In 1810, when Napoleon divorced Josephine and entered into a second marriage with the Austrian Archduchess Marie Louise, Lays was the obvious choice to perform at the wedding ceremony. Meanwhile, his stage activity continued unabated, and in 1807 he was also appointed to serve on the Op\u00e9ra jury in charge of evaluating new works to be staged.He had already been a member of the literary jury under the Ancien R\u00e9gime and the Republic. Other members of the jury came and went, but Lays remained in office continuously until 1815.Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 133 ff. ===Final years=== At the fall of Napoleon in 1814, Lays was one of the Emperor's most prominent favourites, so when the allied armies entered Paris under the leadership of Tsar Alexander I, he was understandably worried about his own future. On 2 April, Talleyrand ordered the Op\u00e9ra to mount a performance in honour of the tsar. The opera chosen, Le triomphe de Trajan by Persuis and Lesueur, had originally been given in 1807 to celebrate Napoleon's return to the capital. Not wanting to hurt the French public's feelings, Alexander requested a staging of Spontini's La vestale instead, an opera in which Lays always assumed the role of Cinna. At the end of the performance, the angry audience forced Lays \u2013 still dressed in his Roman toga \u2013 to return to the stage and recite some popular verses thanking the tsar for restoring the Bourbons.Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 140 ff. The lines were taken, with appropriate changes, from the popular comedy by Coll\u00e9, '. They ran as follows: \"Vive Alexandre/vive ce Roi des Rois!/Sans rien pr\u00e9tendre/Sans nous dicter ses lois,/Ce prince auguste/A ce triple renom/De h\u00e9ros, de juste,/De nous rendre les Bourbons...\" (Long live Alexander/Long live this king of kings!/Without demanding anything/Without dictating his laws to us/This august Prince/Has a triple reputation/As a hero, as a righteous man/And for restoring Bourbons to us...). According to the brothers Michaud, Alexander was moved to compassion by the sight of the terrified singer and sent one of his aides-de-camp on stage to reassure him. The first Restoration was quite mild and the only significant penalty Lays suffered was his dismissal from the former Chapelle Imp\u00e9riale with a resulting loss of income. When Napoleon returned to power for the so- called Hundred Days, Lays was inevitably reinstated in his post and he enthusiastically participated in the Te Deum of thanks. The second Restoration of the Bourbons was more serious for Lays.F\u00e8tis and the brothers Michaud briefly allude to Lays's career ending tranquilly, and to a serene old age spent singing for pleasure in provincial churches. On the contrary, Madame Qu\u00e9ruel (Chapter: L'idole d\u00e9chue. 1815\u20131831, pp. 147\u2013159), basing herself primarily on research conducted in the archives of the Op\u00e9ra and the Conservatoire (to which she summarily refers in footnotes), comes to quite different conclusions, as related in the present article. At the express wish of Louis XVIII he was again expelled \u2013 this time for good \u2013 from the new Chapelle Royale, but in return, in 1816, he was named professor of declamatory singing at the \u00c9cole royale de Musique et de D\u00e9clamation, which had replaced the Conservatoire. The salary was indispensable to Lays because his gout meant he was no longer able to appear at the Op\u00e9ra as regularly as he had done, leading to a drastic reduction in extra income.Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 147\u20138 Lays in the role of the bailiff in Le rossignol by Louis-S\u00e9bastien Lebrun In 1816, Lays had the satisfaction of enjoying one final triumph in the comic opera Le rossignol by Louis-S\u00e9bastien Lebrun (1764\u20131829), set in the foothills of his native Pyrenees. Lays took one of his favourite stock parts, \"a bailiff in his fifties, a lover of good food and beautiful young women, naive and credulous, convinced of his own powers of seduction. The audience, at first amused and then enthralled, gave him a standing ovation which cheered his heart.\" However, things subsequently took a turn for the worse. In 1817, the restored Intendant of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi, Papillon de la Fert\u00e9He was the son of Denis-Pierre-Jean Papillon de la Fert\u00e9, the former Intendant of the Menus- Plaisirs, guillotined during the Terror, who had protected Lays in the 1780s at the time of his quarrels with Dauvergne, and whose office his son had been granted under the Restoration. abolished all additional emoluments granted by Napoleon, leaving the singer to survive on his meagre salary from the school of music and the minimum pay from the Op\u00e9ra, at the very time when his son, stricken with tuberculosis, required expensive medical treatment and his four daughters needed money for their dowries. Lays turned to Luigi Cherubini.Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 149 Lays had repeatedly supported Cherubini when Napoleon had shown signs of dislike for the composer. Cherubini had now become one of the leading figures in the musical establishment under the Restoration.Qu\u00e9ruel repeatedly writes that Cherubini had recently been named director of both the Conservatoire and the Op\u00e9ra, but her assertion appears to be entirely without foundation. He had instead been named surintendant of the Royal Chapel in 1814, had been elected a member of the Institut de France in 1815 (during the Hundred Days), and was later to become the first real director of the \u00c9cole royale de musique et de d\u00e9clamation in 1822 (Marc Vignal, Dictionnaire de la musique italienne, Paris, Larousse, 1988; Italian edition consulted: Dizionario di musica classica italiana, Rome, Gremese, 2002, p. 47), after having been one of the Conservatoire's inspectors from its foundation in 1795, and having become an outstanding professor of the new \u00c9cole royale when it had replaced the Conservatoire in 1816. Cherubini's predecessor as head of the institution, Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Perne, only had the title of \"inspecteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9tudes\", and the actual direction was exercised by the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi. According to a contemporary Italian source, Cherubini might have retained the post of inspector even within the new institution (article: Luigi Carlo Zenobio Cherubini, in Serie di vite e ritratti de' famosi personaggi degli ultimi tempi, Milan, Batelli & Fanfani, 1818, article n. 51; accessible online at Google Books). He immediately intervened on Lays's behalf, but all he could obtain from Fert\u00e9 was the advice that the singer should go on a tour of the provinces as a way of supplementing his income.Having obtained leave of absence, Lays appeared in Nancy (where performances were interrupted by the death of the leading soprano) and Strasbourg, where Lays himself was obliged to interrupt them with disastrous effects on his finances: he had been unexpectedly summoned back to Paris on the pretext he was urgently needed for rehearsals of a new opera, Les jeux floraux; in reality, the rehearsals only took place two months later. Lays then applied to the royal administration, insisting he should be granted some of the potential economic benefits provided by law, but, after the new opera's premiere, his demands received a blanket rejection. According to Qu\u00e9ruel, when he protested stridently about this decision, he was forced into unpaid leave from his theatrical activities in late 1818. He subsequently spent about two years of hardship, during which his need to provide a dowry for his eldest daughter Marie-C\u00e9cile forced him further into debt.Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 148\u2013151 Qu\u00e9ruel relates that Lays was finally reinstated only on 9 January 1821, but this assertion cannot be accurate because the singer's name often appeared on the theatre bills in the meantime, for example the whole period between July 1819 and June 1820.See, for instance, the theatre programmes published daily in the following Paris newspapers: \"La Renomm\u00e9e\", 1819, numbers 16/18/39/42/44/58/76/78/83/85/92/95/99/101/108/110/138/141/148/150/159/160/162/164/167/171/174/176/178/185 (accessible for free online at Google Books); \"Le Drapeau Blanc, journal de la politique, de la litt\u00e9rature et des th\u00e9atres\", 1820, numbers 31/33/42/117/124/131/136/150/164 (accessible for free online at Google Books). Whatever the case, in response to his renewed demands for economic support, the administration granted him further leave to perform privately outside Paris. Lays went on a tour of the Low Countries and also put on several performances of Anacr\u00e9on chez PolycrateGr\u00e9try's opera remained highly popular throughout the first quarter of the 19th century: Castil-Blaze reports that Rossini was able to play whole passages from it by heart on the harpsichord (op. cit. above). at the same Brussels Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie to which he had tried to escape forty years earlier.And where he is reported to have already managed to go on tour in 1792/93 as part of a delegation from the Paris Op\u00e9ra led by Gossec, and to have later taken up an engagement in April 1818 (Jacques Isnardon, Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, Depuis sa Fondation jusq\u00f9'\u00e0 nos Jours, Brussels, Schott, 1890, pp. 83 and 151; accessible for free online at Internet Archive). The reviews from the local newspaper, the \"Mercure belge\", reported by Qu\u00e9ruel tell of a real triumph. On his return to Paris, however, he was greeted with disastrous news. It was now obvious that the singer had been targeted in high places: the Minister of the Maison du Roi, General Jacques Alexandre Law de Lauriston, who was ultimately in charge of the theatre, had discovered he had not previously authorised the leave of absence granted to Lays and, regarding it as null and void, intended to sue him for damages for missing performances at the Op\u00e9ra.Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 151\u2013153 The confrontation lasted for more than a year until, in 1823, the moment came for Lays to leave the Op\u00e9ra after almost 45 years of outstanding service. The benefit concert, to which artistes were entitled on their retirement, took place on 1 May. The performance ended with Le rossignol, during which almost all the stars who did not have roles in the opera paid homage to their respected and well-liked colleague by appearing on stage in the chorus. The first part of the concert saw the company of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais transfer to the Op\u00e9ra for a revival of Racine's tragedy Athalie, performed with incidental music and choruses by Gossec.Racine's tragedy had already been given at the Op\u00e9ra four years earlier, premiering on 8 March 1819, with the host theatre's company (included Lays himself) performing the choral and musical interludes written by Gossec, to which an excerpt from The Creation by Haydn was also added. An account of one of the performances can be found in The Journal of John Waldie Theatre Commentaries, 1799\u20131830, n. 29 (Journal 42), note from 15 March 1819 (available online at UCLA's eScholarship, edited by Frederick Burwick). The leading roles were taken by three star actors: Lays's old friend and political ally, Talma; the great Racine specialist Mademoiselle Duchesnois; and . The \"premiers sujets\" of the Op\u00e9ra sang as simple \"coryph\u00e9es\" in the chorus. The takings were considerable, amounting to the remarkable sum of 14,000 francs.Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique. Repr\u00e9sentation d'Athalie et du Rossignol pour la retraite de Lays.\u2013 Rentr\u00e9e de Lafon au Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, \"Journal des d\u00e9bats politiques et litt\u00e9raires\", 3 May 1823, pp. 1\u20134 (accessible for free online at Gallica \u2013 B.N.F.). Qu\u00e9ruel postdates this performance by exactly three years, to 1 May 1826, which leads her to misinterpret data and documents referring to the interval between the two dates. According to Qu\u00e9ruel, however, shortly afterwards a peremptory letter from the administration dated 1 June 1823 informed Lays of its intention to use the takings from the performance to make good the debts it claimed Lays owed it. It is not entirely clear, from Qu\u00e9ruel's account, how the issue was finally resolved. Whatever the case, the financial position of the singer and his family remained extremely precarious. He still kept his teaching post at the \u00c9cole royale de musique et de d\u00e9clamation, but the salary and pension were clearly not enough for him to cope with his debts and live a comfortable life, and thus, in spite of his ailing health and his now worn-out voice, he was forced to accept engagements, however humiliating, from provincial companies, just to make ends meet. According to Qu\u00e9ruel, posters of the time show he worked as an understudy in a company in Brest, a baritone in the choir of the Dunkirk Opera, a reserve baritone in Lille, a bass soloist in Valenciennes, and once more as a simple understudy at the Metz opera house. In late 1825, however, Lays again took to the Op\u00e9ra stage in a benefit concert for the great singer Giuditta Pasta. The show, held on 8 October, was a double bill: the final Paris performance of Meyerbeer's Il crociato in Egitto followed by another revival of Le rossignol. Meyerbeer's opera had previously been staged at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre italien and was performed by an almost entirely Italian company led by Pasta and Domenico Donzelli. In Le rossignol, Lays once more played his favourite character of the bailiff, while the principal female role of Philis was taken by Laure Cinti-Damoreau,Theatre programme and Macedoine, \"La Lorgnette\", II, n. 598, 8 October 1825, pp. 1 and 4 (accessible for free online at Gallica \u2013 B.N.F.). a pupil of Rossini, soon to become the leading lady in the composer's French operas.By that time, Cinti-Damoreau had been singing Italian opera for several years in Paris, London and Brussels. Along with Rossini, she now began to transfer to the Op\u00e9ra, where Le Rossignol was to remain in the repertoire \"largely as a showpiece for [her]\" (Benjamin Walton, Rossini in Restoration Paris: The Sound of Modern Life, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 238, note 60). New political developments did not bode well for Lays. Charles X, who had come to the throne in 1824, named the ultra-royalist as Director General of the Fine Arts. La Rochefoucauld had an aversion to Lays both as an inveterate supporter of the Revolution, and, in particular, for the ironic remarks the singer had made about his morality campaign, which included lengthening ballerinas' skirts and providing ancient statues with fig leaves. In 1826, La Rochefoucauld had the opportunity to demonstrate his dislike when Lays, realising that life in Paris was beyond his financial means, decided to leave his post as professor and retire to the provinces to be near his married eldest daughter. According to Qu\u00e9ruel. Lays, probably wanting to end his career of more than 40 years on a high note, sent the minister a petition signed by almost all the stars of the Op\u00e9ra and backed by Cherubini, asking for another benefit concert, in addition to the one three years earlier, this time in aid of his son who was working as a saute-ruisseau'Literally meaning a \"gutter-jumper\" or a \"skip-kennel\", the 'saute-ruisseau' was the lowest clerical assistant, a sort of errand boy or boy messenger, in French law firms (cf. Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Colonel Chabert; English translation by Ellen Marriage and Clara Bell accessible for free online at Project Gutenberg). at a notary's and whose legal studies Lays could not afford to maintain. Inevitably the request fell on deaf ears. Lays also asked for his pension to be recalculated, bearing in mind his years teaching at the conservatory. But this led to disputes to which the correspondence between Cherubini and La Rochefoucauld bears explicit testimony. In October, the former wrote:Both the following quotations are taken from Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 157 > I have the honour to inform you that Monsieur Lays has retired and is asking > for his pension. There is no doubt that he has a right to such recompense. > There is no need to tell you of the talent of this famous artist, whose > career has been long and fruitful. His reputation, which has endured for > half a century, makes all such talk superfluous. In the interests of the > professor, I must add that it is the meagreness of his fortune more than his > age which has forced him to ask for his pension. No longer able to live in > the capital in the manner to which he is accustomed, his intention is to > retire to somewhere in the provinces where he and his family will be able to > live more comfortably. A week later, having received no reply, Cherubini tried again: > Permit me to bring to your attention the services he has rendered to musical > and dramatic art, and the regrettable situation in which he finds himself > after such long services as well as having to provide for a large family. No response having come from the administration, Qu\u00e9ruel claims that Cherubini made the courageous decision to use his discretionary powers and take personal responsibility for authorising a special performance whose takings would be divided equally between the Acad\u00e9mie and Lays. Even if it is unclear what right the director of the \u00c9cole royale de musique et de d\u00e9clamation had to make such a decision, the performance did in fact take place at the Op\u00e9ra on 20 November 1826. The programme consisted of Boieldieu's op\u00e9ra comique Le calife de Bagdad; the second act of Anacr\u00e9on chez Polycrate, in which Lays played his most famous role for the last time; and the four-act pantomime- ballet Mars et V\u00e9nus, ou Les filets de Vulcain with music by Jean Schneitzh\u00f6ffer. However, the evening's takings of between 6,000 and 7,000 francs were markedly inferior to those Lays's presence on stage would once have guaranteed.Theatre programme and Bigarrures, \"Le Figaro, Journal non politique\", I, n. 300, 20 November 1826, and n. 303, 23 November 1826, p. 3 (accessible for free online at Gallica \u2013 B.N.F.: 20 November; 23 November). La Rochefoucauld's reply on the issue of the pension was delayed until January 1827, when he stated that Lays was not entitled to any pension increase with regard to his previous years of teaching, having already received the maximum provided for as a result of his theatrical activity, and having furthermore shared half the takings from an extra benefit performance. Meanwhile, Lays, his wife and unmarried daughters, had retired to Ingrandes in the Loire valley, where they joined his married daughter Marie-C\u00e9cile. Here he had already witnessed the death of his son Bertrand from consumption and was soon to see his wife stricken with paralysis. In his final years Lays spent his time singing hymns in local churches.Qu\u00e9ruel, pp. 158-9 He died aged 73 in 1831, leaving his wife and children the paltry sum of 1056 francs.Qu\u00e9ruel, p. 162. Further evidence of the Lays family's long-lasting economic difficulties, is provided by \"La France Musicale\", which published the following brief notice in August 1858 (also the basis of the article by Aldino Aldini cited in the bibliography): \"His Majesty the Emperor, having heard that the daughter of Lays, of the Op\u00e9ra, was in a state of the greatest poverty, ordered Monsieur Mocquart, his chef de cabinet, to forward her some assistance.\" ==Artistic characteristics== As mentioned above, Lays's voice was classified as basse- taille in the Op\u00e9ra company, a voice type which was initially roughly equivalent to the modern bass-baritone, but by the latter half of the 18th century had come to designate all low male voices. According to the brothers Michaud, however, Lays \"was not strictly a basse-taille, although he sometimes forced his voice downwards excessively to reach the lower notes, and he was listed among the company's leading basse-tailles\", neither was he, contrary to some erroneous contemporary descriptions, a tenor: he was in fact \"an admirable baritone or concordant, low, pure, sonorous and flexible, whose range and volume were amazing\". Irish tenor Michael Kelly, who happened to hear him in the 1780s, wrote that \"Monsieur Laisse\" possessed \"a fine baritone voice, with much taste and expression\".Reminiscences of Michael Kelly, Of the King's Theatre, and Theatre Royal Drury Lane (...), London, Colburn 1826, I, p. 289, (accessible for free online at Google Books). According to Kelly, however, Lays's greatest praise \"was, that he was very unlike a French singer\". The majority of modern authors share these opinions. According to Elizabeth Forbes, for instance, he possessed a \"voice, baritonal in quality, but which extended into the tenor range\".op. cit. In fact, his roles were mostly notated in the bass clef,The baritone clefs, both the C-clef on the fifth line and the F-clef on the third line, had long since fallen into disuse and all basse-taille parts would be notated in the bass clef. but there are also cases where the tenor clef was preferred, such as the title role of Anacr\u00e9on (1803) by Cherubini,Printed score: Anacr\u00e9on, ou L'Amour Fugitif, Op\u00e9ra ballet en deux actes, Paris/Lyon, Magasin Cherubini, M\u00e9hul, Kreutzer, Rode, Isouard et Boildieu/Garnier, s.d., p. 90 (accessible online at IMSLP). Cherubini had used bass clef notation for the part of Astor entrusted to Lays in D\u00e9mophoon (1788), to take one example (printed score: D\u00e9mophoon, Trag\u00e9die Lyrique en Trois Actes, Paris, Huguet, s.d., p. 45; accessible online at IMSLP). or the role of Cinna in La Vestale (1807) by Spontini.Printed score: La Vestale, Trag\u00e9die Lyrique en trois Actes, Paris, Pacini, s.d., p. 28 (accessible online at Gallica \u2013 BNF). While there seems to have been no doubt about the great beauty of Lays's voice, which he was able to preserve throughout his career, F\u00e9tis criticised his skill in managing it: Spire Pitou draws readers' attention to this last point in his work on the Paris Op\u00e9ra. Pitou was evidently unaware of Lays's attempted flight to Brussels in 1781 and the troubles of his final years, but his comments appear worthy of note nevertheless: The number of 68 characters listed by Pitou is incomplete. In fact, the roles Lays created amount to at least 73 (cf next section). Moreover, this obviously does not include the roles Lays did not create directly (including those already mentioned, such as Th\u00e9s\u00e9e in Sacchini's \u0152dipe \u00e0 Colone, Oreste in Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride and Cynire in Echo et Narcisse, both by Gluck, as well as Patrocle in the same composer's Iphig\u00e9nie en Aulide and Figaro in Le Mariage de Figaro by Mozart).Michaud, op. cit. In fact, he sang the role in 1793 in an interminable tripatouillage (a confused rehash) which involved a complete performance of the comedy by Beaumarchais interspersed with Mozart's arias, duos, trios and choruses retranslated into French (F\u00e9lix Gaiffe, Le Mariage de Figaro, Amiens, Malf\u00e8re, 1928, p. 129; accessible online at Gallica \u2013 BNF). Lays's contribution to the Op\u00e9ra repertoire, which lasted over forty years, was astonishing, and the long duration of the singer's career and the good vocal form he maintained to the last suggest that F\u00e9tis's adverse judgement on his technical skills should be accepted only with caution. ==Roles created== The following table contains a list of the roles created by Fran\u00e7ois Lays in the course of his long career.
