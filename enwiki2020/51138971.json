In 1884 he married Lelia Leftwich of Bedford County. ==First Baptist Church== In 1882 he moved to Roanoke to help start the First Baptist Church (Roanoke, Virginia). An aggressive and passionate speaker, he worked with the congregation to raise funds for the church building and parsonage, and became its first pastor. \"Born a slave in 1853, Reverend Richard R. Jones came to Roanoke in 1882 to head First Baptist Church. When completed in 1903 under exacting direction of Rev. Jones, the new First Baptist Church housed the largest black congregation west of Richmond. In 1901, the Roanoke Times condemned the outspoken ministry of Rev. Jones for disrupting \"essential harmony between blacks and whites.\" In 1904, a white mob of men and boys forced Rev. Jones to flee Roanoke, never to return.\"\"Roanoke's African American Heritage.\" The First Hundred Years, 1874 - 1973. ==Exile and Death== When a white woman in Roanoke was attacked by a black man, tensions ran high. The Rev. Jones preached that whites were not superior to blacks, and in anger, a large mob of whites attacked his home on February 5, 1904, threatening him and his family. Forced out of his home in Roanoke, Virginia, he fled by train to Washington, DC, then to Homestead, Pennsylvania. There he began a $30,000.00 lawsuit against the town of Roanoke and the city police.Bluefield Daily Telegram. Bluefield, West Virginia. March 4, 1905. Page 1.
