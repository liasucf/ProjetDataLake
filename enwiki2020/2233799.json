    "text": "The Huniade Castle, Timi\u0219oara The Huniade Castle (, ) is the oldest monument of Timi\u0219oara, built between 1443 and 1447 by John Hunyadi and Paolo Santini de Duccio over the old royal castle dating from the 14th century (built during the reign of Charles I Robert). The castle was rebuilt by the Turkish pashas in the 17th century and by Prince Eugene of Savoy in the 18th century. The structure owes its present appearance to the 1850s reconstruction campaign. It houses the History Section and the Natural Sciences Section of the Banat Museum. In front of the museum there are two lamps reminding that Timi\u0219oara was the first European town to have introduced electric public lighting in 12 November 1884. == See also == * Timi\u0219oara Fortress * Hunyad Castle in Hunedoara * List of castles in Romania * List of places in Timi\u0219oara * Tourism in Romania ==References== Category:Castles in Romania Category:Buildings and structures in Timi\u0219oara Category:Historic monuments in Timi\u0219 County ",
