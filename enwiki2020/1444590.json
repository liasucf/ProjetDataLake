    "text": "At a national level, Slovenia elects a head of state (a president) and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people using the run-off system. The National Assembly (Dr\u017eavni zbor), Slovenia's parliament, has 90 members each elected for four-year terms. All but two of these are elected using the D'Hondt method of list proportional representation. The remaining two members are elected by the Italian and Hungarian ethnic minorities using the Borda count. Slovenia's multi-party system means that any one party is unlikely to gain power alone. Coalition governments must therefore be negotiated and formed. == Latest elections == ===2014 parliamentary election=== ===2012 presidential election=== == See also == * Electoral calendar * Electoral system == Further reading == *Toplak, Jurij.
