The Forbes website described the conference attendees as \"senior figures from the world's leading companies and institutions will discuss the best ways to nurture and capitalize on innovation and reveal the latest global trends.\" ==Attendees== The conference had around 350 attendees, including Australian Prime Minister John Howard, former New South Wales Premier Bob Carr, and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. In the weeks before the conference, it was reported in the media that George H. W. Bush would be attending, however this was later found to be a hoax propagated by the protest group 30A Network. ==Protest== Police line in front of breached section of barricade A large protest was held to coincide with the conference. The protest assembled at 5pm in Customs Square, near Circular Quay, with about 1,000 people listening to numerous speeches. The protestors then marched along the Quay to the barricades that had been set up to prevent public access to the Opera House forecourt. A small number of protestors started rocking one of the barricades, causing it to collapse. A number of arrests were made, and the protest continued in a peaceful fashion until 9:30pm. == External links == * Conference website * 30A Network website (protest organisers) Forbes Global CEO Conference Forbes Global CEO Conference Category:International conferences in Australia Category:2000s in Sydney ",
