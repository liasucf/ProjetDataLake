    "text": "Ghagiel (variously Chaigidel, Chaigidiel, or Oghiel), in the belief system of Kabbalah, is the name of the Qliphah corresponding to the Sephirah Chokmah in the Tree of Life. They are demons, the Hinderers, described as black evil giants with serpents entwined around them, and they are attached to lying and material appearances, in opposition to those of reality and wisdom. ==Description== In the Kabbalah, the Qliphoth represent the unbalanced force of a particular Sephirah, or attribute of God. Chokmah, or \"Wisdom\" is the sephira concerned with creative, subjective energy, the phallic force that acts upon Binah, the great mother, the receiver of this energy and giver of form. If Chokmah is not balanced by the force of Binah, it remains proud, unrestricted energy, too stubborn to be bound by the matrix of the mother, unwilling to 'bow down to man' and take material form, as described in the Islamic legend regarding Iblis, or Satan. Therefore, Chokmah becomes Ghagiel, the force that hinders the natural evolution of divine energy flowing down into the creation, through pride and egotism, and maintains itself in the world of illusion and lies. ==References== Category:Qliphoth Category:Kabbalistic words and phrases ",
