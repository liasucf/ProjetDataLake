Famous for his eloquence, Sirvydas spent 10 years of his life preaching sermons at St. Johns' Church in Vilnius (twice a day \u2013 once in Lithuanian and once in Polish). == Biography == He was born in Lithuania some time between 1578 and 1581, in the village of Sirvydai near Anyk\u0161\u010diai. In 1612, he became a professor of theology at the Academia Vilnensis, the predecessor of Vilnius University. Between 1623 and 1624, he also briefly served as the deputy rector of his alma mater, after which he continued as a professor in theology, liberal arts and philosophy. == Works == At the same time, he began his career as a preacher, writer and scientist. First edition before 1620 - fifth in 1713, he published his tri-lingual Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Latin dictionary Dictionarium trium linguarum in usum studiosae juventutis, one of the first such books in Lithuanian literary history. It has been printed in at least five editions since that time. First and later editions slightly differed. Editions Until the 19th century, it was the only Lithuanian dictionary in print. Sirvydas' lexicon is often mentioned as a milestone in the standardization and codification of the Lithuanian language. The first edition contained approximately 6000 words, the second was expanded to include almost 11,000 words. It also had a lot of newly created Lithuanian words, including for example mokytojas (teacher), taisykl\u0117 (rule), kokyb\u0117 (quality). A decade later, in 1629, he published the first volume of a collection of his sermons entitled Punktai Sakym\u0173, and he later translated them into the Polish language as Punkty kaza\u0144. The Lithuanian version of this work was often used as a primer to teach the Lithuanian language. However, it was not until 1644, that the second volume was finally published. Around 1630, he compiled the first book of grammar of the Lithuanian language (Lietuvi\u0173 kalbos raktas \u2013 Key to the Lithuanian Language), which however did not survive to our times. He died from tuberculosis on August 8, 1631 in Vilnius. ==Other works== *Explanationes in Cantica Canticorum Salomonis et in epistolam D.
