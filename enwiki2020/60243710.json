    "text": "Terbium(III) nitrate is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula Tb(NO3)3. The hexahydrate crystallizes as triclinic colorless crystals with the formula [Tb(NO3)3(H2O)4]\u00b72H2O. It can be used to synthesize materials with green emission. ==Preparation== Terbium(III) nitrate can be prepared by dissolving terbium(III,IV) oxide in a mixture of aqueous HNO3 and H2O2 solution. ==Properties== It reacts with NH4HCO3 to produce Tb2(CO3)3 along with its basic carbonate. It forms Tb(NO3)52- in CH3CN with excess nitrate anions. ==References== Category:Terbium compounds Category:Nitrates ",
