    "text": "CoderDojo is a global volunteer-led community of free programming workshops for young people between 7 and 17. The movement is a grassroots organisation with individual clubs (called \"Dojos\") acting independently. A charity called the CoderDojo Foundation operates out of Dublin and supports the various clubs by providing a central websiteCoderDojo Foundation Official Webpage and some other support services. Supporters of CoderDojo believe it is part of the solution to addressing the global shortageGlobally there is a monumental shortage of programmers with the EU predicting a shortfall of almost 1 million technical workers by 2020 of programmers by exposing young people to ICT at a young age. The movement has seen significant growth since its founding. The CoderDojo Foundation estimates 1,250 Dojos spread across 69 countries,Raspberry Pi and CoderDojo Join Forces with a growth rate of several new Dojos every week. == History == Founded in July 2011 by James Whelton & Bill Liao, the first Dojo took place in NSC Cork, Ireland, on 23 July. James and Bill were self-taught programmers and wanted to create a space where young people could learn code in a social environment. In less than one year, the CoderDojo movement was spread across Ireland and other cities like London in England and San Francisco in the United States. In May 2017, Raspberry Pi foundation merged with CoderDojo. == Press Coverage == CoderDojo received positive reviews from newspapers including BBC, CNN, The Guardian, The Irish Times and TechCrunch. In 2015, Salesforce announced a partnership and a grant of $200,000 to CoderDojo in order to help \"support 14 CoderDojo code clubs \u2013 or Dojos \u2013 globally, with each of them being run by Salesforce.com \"champions\". == CoderDojo Girls == Many CoderDojo volunteers focus on improving the extreme shortage of women in technology In 2013, women made up 14 percent of all computer science graduates \u2014 down from 36 percent in 1984. This imbalance persists in the tech industry. by using specific strategies to engage girls. In particular, challenging the socially accepted idea among young women that the world of the computer sciences is \"not for them\". Some Dojos have even chosen to run special CoderDojo Girls sessions to encourage young women to participate in computer science. There has been some success with attracting girls into Dojos through making female mentors visible to newcomers. == CoderDojo Foundation == Established in mid-2013 by cofounder James Whelton, the CoderDojo Foundation is focused on supporting, scaling, and empowering the CoderDojo Community. With a small core team of 6 people based in Dogpatch Labs, Dublin, Ireland, the Foundation advises new and existing Dojos, develops resources to assist Dojos, and manages international partnerships and events on behalf of the Community. The focus is on scaling the CoderDojo movement to make coding clubs even more accessible for young people all over the world. The foundation has a stated target of encouraging: *100,000 children coding regularly *1,500 Dojos *Dojos spread across 60 Countries ==See also== *Ghana Code Club ==References== ==External links== *CoderDojo official website Category:Computer programming Category:Computer clubs Category:Irish educational websites ",
