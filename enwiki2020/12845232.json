    "text": "Cegedel S.A. (until 17 May 1997 the Compagnie Grand-Ducale d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Luxembourg ()), was a Luxembourg company that distributed electricity. It operated under a concession written into the law under which it was formed, and distributed 70% of the electricity used in the country, amounting to 6,616 GWh. The Government of Luxembourg owned one-third of the company, which made it the largest single shareholder, followed by the 30.4% stake held by Luxempart-Energie, with smaller stakes held by SNCI (12%) and Electrabel (8%). Shares of the company were listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, of which it was one of the ten (and one of the seven Luxembourg-based) members of the main index, the LuxX Index As a result of the European Union policy of liberalization of the energy market, Enovos Gruppe acquired Cegedel SA along with Soteg SA, the gas distributor, in 2009, and created a Luxembourg subsidiary, Creos Luxembourg to distribute both gas and electricity. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * Creos Luxembourg SA, distributor, official website * Enovos Luxembourg SA, generator and supplier, official web site * Enovos International SA, the parent corporation Category:Electric power companies of Luxembourg Category:Energy companies established in 1928 Category:Strassen, Luxembourg Category:1928 establishments in Luxembourg ",
