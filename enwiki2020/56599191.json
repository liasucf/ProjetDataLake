Jastrz\u0119biec. He had four brothers and six sisters. ==Early life== He studied abroad (Padua, Rome, Madrid). In 1545 he received the Pozna\u0144 canon. After returning from Italy, he stayed at the court of King Zygmunt August, where he became known as a man especially talented for foreign languages and for service in diplomacy. Hence, in 1560, after the death of Queen Bona, he was sent to Madrid in Spain, where he spent 10 years, trying to regain the so-called. Neapolitan sums. After returning to Poland, he was again sent to Spain after the death of Piotr Barzego, the castellan of Przemy\u015bl and a Polish deputy who made wrong decisions in state matters, which required immediate intervention and repair. As a member, he was also sent to Pope Gregory XIII. His diplomatic successes were due to very good knowledge of Italian, French and Spanish. Canceled from Spain, he returned to Poland in 1573. ==Episcopal career== In recognition of his diplomatic talent, Henryk Walezy appointed him in 1574, at the coronation sejm of the Crown Deputy, and then Stefan Batory as the Grand Chancellor of the Crown in 1576 and the Bishop of Przemy\u015bl. Shortly thereafter, he submitted the chancellor's seal to Jan Zamoyski, and having not yet approved the papacy for the diocese of Przemy\u015bl, he was nominated for the bishopric in P\u0142ock, where his rule lasted from 5 July 1577 until his death on 28 August 1590. In 1575 he signed the election of Emperor Maximilian II Habsburg.Leszek Kieniewicz, Senat za Stefana Batorego, (Warszawa 2000), p. 299. In 1589, he was a signatory of the ratification of the Bytom-B\u0119dzin treaty at the pacification parliament.Codex diplomaticus Regni Poloniae et Magni Ducatus Lituaniae, wyda\u0142 Maciej Dogiel, vol.I, (Wilno 1758), p.237. As a bishop of P\u0142ock, he twice conducted a diocesan synod in P\u0142ock and Pu\u0142tusk (1586 and 1589), which contributed to the reception of the reform undertaken at the Council of Trent in the diocese of P\u0142ock. He built the bishop's palace in Wyszk\u00f3w (1589); he renewed the collegiate church in Pu\u0142tusk. He was also known as a bibliophile - imported from abroad books he had set in light yellow parchment and brown skin. Accumulated books were donated by the Krak\u00f3w Academy (about 1000 volumes) and the library of the P\u0142ock chapter (130 works). ==References== Category:Bishops of P\u0142ock Category:Year of birth unknown Category:16th-century births Category:1590s deaths Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops ",
