A Last Train bid is typically made in a bidding sequence in which one of the partners has already indicated slam interest.

In the absence of any partnership agreement, most players would interpret the Last Train bid as a control bid, showing a high card value in the suit named. ==Examples== 1 - 3 4 - 4 The 4 bid shows a club control and slam interest. If the partnership has agreed to use Last Train, the 4 bid indicates extra values (i.e., responder's hand is at the upper end of the strength range indicated by the 3 bid), and invites partner to continue exploring slam. 4 does not show a diamond control, although of course responder might have one. 1 - 4 4 The 4 bid asks responder to consider bidding slam with values beyond those already shown (4 is a splinter bid showing at least four spades and a singleton diamond). ==References== Category:Bridge conventions ",
