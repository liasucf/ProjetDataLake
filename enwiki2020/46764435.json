Botaniska Notiser 118(4): 406\u2013411 Arctotis venusta is grown as a ground cover because of its silvery foliage and showy flower heads. It is adaptable to many conditions and is sometimes used to control erosion. It is a perennial with stout, woolly stems and aromatic, violin-shaped, heavily lobed leaves. The flower heads have many creamy-white to pink or bronze ray florets with lavender to reddish undersides and centers filled with purple disc florets. The fruit is a hard achene with a tuft of plumelike hairs on one end and an array of pappus scales on the other. The species is sometimes regarded as the same species as the rare A. stoechadifolia, but authors separate the two as distinct species.Flora of North America Arctotis stoechadifoliaCalflora taxon report, Arctotis venusta Norl., Blue-eyed african daisy ==References== ==External links== *Jepson Manual Treatment *United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile *African Plants Profile stoechadifolia Category:Endemic flora of South Africa ~ Category:Garden plants of Africa ",
