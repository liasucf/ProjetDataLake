    "text": "The president of the Bundestag ( or ) presides over the sessions of the Bundestag, the federal parliament of Germany, with functions similar to that of a speaker in other countries. In the German order of precedence, the office is ranked second after the president and before the chancellor. The 13th and current president of the Bundestag is Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, since October 24, 2017. == Election and customs == The president of the Bundestag is elected during the constituent session of each election period after the federal elections or in a later session, if the office has fallen vacant, by all members of the Bundestag. The president has to be a member of the Bundestag. Until the election of the president, the session is chaired by the father of the House, the so-called Alterspr\u00e4sident. Since 2017, this has been the longest serving member of the Bundestag; in 1949-2017, it was the oldest member of the Bundestag by age.Deutscher Bundestag, The Bundestag's constituent sitting Usually, the president of the Bundestag is a member of the largest parliamentary group. This custom had emerged already in times of the Weimar Republic, but this is not required by law. The term ends with the election period, and there is no provision for an early removal. The term of the president can only end prematurely if they resign the position, leaves the Bundestag or dies. They can be reelected in the next election period provided they become a member of the Bundestag again. Traditionally, the president of the Bundestag is elected uncontested. The only exception so far has been in 1954 after the unexpected death of Hermann Ehlers. Ernst Lemmer competed with the \"official\" CDU/CSU candidate, Eugen Gerstenmaier, and lost after three ballots with a difference of 14 votes (204 for Gerstenmaier, 190 for Lemmer, 15 abstentions). == Presidium of the Bundestag == The president of the Bundestag has several deputies, the vice presidents of the Bundestag ( or ), who are supplied by the other parliamentary groups. The number of vice presidents was not fixed in the Bundestag's Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung (rules of order) until 1994, when it was decided that each parliamentary group should be represented by at least one vice president. However, no AfD candidate for Vice President has been elected for the 19th Bundestag. Together, the president and the vice presidents make up the Presidium of the Bundestag. As of September 2019, the current vice presidents of the Bundestag are: * Hans-Peter Friedrich (CDU/CSU) * Thomas Oppermann (SPD) * Wolfgang Kubicki (FDP) * Petra Pau (Die Linke) * Claudia Roth (B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen) ==Legal background== The legal foundation for the office is Article 40 of the Basic Law which states that the Bundestag elects a president and vice presidents and is to give itself rules of order. Due to a 1952 Federal Constitutional Court decision, the Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung has to be enacted afresh in every election period, but usually the old rules are reenacted without change.
