She is a founding fellow of the International Association of Applied Econometrics, a fellow of the Econometric Society and a Director of the International Association of Applied Econometrics. == Academic career == Rossi graduated with a B.A in Economics from Bologna University in 1995, and she earned her PhD from Princeton University in 2001. Her graduate dissertation was titled, \u201cEssays in Long Horizon Testing and Predictive Ability in the Presence of High Persistence with Applications to International Macroeconomics.\u201d Before moving to Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, she previously was an Associate Professor with tenure at the department of Economics at Duke University. She has also been visiting researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Montreal in Canada, UC San Diego, the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, New York and Philadelphia, Norges Bank, Bank of France, and ENSAE-CREST in France. Aside from teaching, Professor Rossi is the editor of the Journal of Applied Econometrics and has previously served as associate editor of Quantitative Economics. In January 2017 she has been appointed vice chair of the Euro Area Business Cycle Network (EABCN) and subsequently appointed chair in January 2020. In 2017-2020, she was a member of the Council of the European Economic Association; she was a member of the European Standing Committee of the Econometric Society in 2015-2018; and has been a member of the EC2 standing committee since 2014.

Rossi's contributions to forecasting include having designed a variety of econometric procedures to evaluate forecasts especially in the presence of instabilities, including techniques to compare competing models' forecasts and to evaluate the predictive ability of a given model, Granger- causality tests robust to instabilities, techniques to detect forecast breakdowns, forecast evaluation techniques that are robust to the choice of the estimation window size,\"Out-of-sample forecast tests robust to the choice of window size\", by B Rossi, A Inoue (2012), Journal of Business & Economic Statistics 30 (3), 432-453. as well as several empirical works that investigate output and inflation predictability. In macroeconometrics, among other contributions, Rossi has designed techniques to study business cycles as well as the effects of monetary and fiscal policies.\"What Is the Importance of Monetary and Fiscal Shocks in Explaining US Macroeconomic Fluctuations?\", by B Rossi, S Zubairy (2011), Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 43 (6), 1247-1270. Rossi's research in the area of international finance encompasses several studies on the predictability of exchange rates\u2014in particular the robustness of such forecasts to instabilities\u2014and on the relationship between exchange rates and oil prices. == Books == Rossi wrote a chapter on \"Advances in Forecasting under Model Instabilities\" for the Handbook of Economic Forecasting (Elsevier-North Holland eds.),\"Advances in Forecasting under Model Instabilities\", Handbook of Economic Forecasting (Elsevier-North Holland eds.) a chapter on \"Forecasting in Macroeconomics\" for the Handbook of Research Methods and Applications in Empirical Macroeconomics,\"Forecasting in Macroeconomics\", Handbook of Research Methods and Applications in Empirical Macroeconomics and an article for the Journal of Economic Literature on exchange rate predictability. == Rossi's Research Funding == Rossi has been awarded two National Science Foundation grants as well a Marie Curie fellowship, an ERC grant, and the Spanish Ministry of Research. == Other activities == Along with her teaching and research responsibilities, Rossi holds various other professional positions.
