    "text": "Subaru of America, Inc. (commonly known as SOA), based in Camden, New Jersey, is the United States-based distributor of Subaru's brand vehicles, a subsidiary of Subaru Corporation of Japan. The company markets and distributes Subaru vehicles, parts and accessories through a network of more than 600 dealers throughout the United States. In 1967, Malcolm Bricklin approached Subaru with the idea of bringing the tiny Subaru 360 to the United States. After a great deal of regulatory red tape and negotiation, Bricklin made a deal with Subaru. Bricklin formed Subaru of America, Inc. to sell Subaru franchises and later brought in Harvey Lamm as the COO. Subaru of America was established in 1968 in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The headquarters later moved to Pennsauken, New Jersey and then Cherry Hill, New Jersey. In 1986, it was fully acquired by Fuji Heavy Industries (now named Subaru Corporation). In 1989, Subaru and then-partner Isuzu opened a joint factory in Lafayette, Indiana, called Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, Inc., or SIA, which initially manufactured the Subaru Legacy and Isuzu Rodeo. In 2001, Isuzu sold its stake in the plant to FHI for $1 due to flagging sales and it was renamed Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. SIA has been designated a backyard wildlife Habitat by the National Wildlife Federation, and has achieved a zero-landfill production designation. Subaru built a new 250,000 square foot headquarters in Camden, New Jersey and relocated there in 2018. In May 2019 demolition started on the previous Subaru building in Cherry Hill. == Products == Subaru cars available in North America: ===Present models=== * Subaru Legacy 1990 - current * Subaru Impreza 1993 - current **Subaru Impreza WRX (now known simply as WRX) 2002 - current ** Subaru Impreza WRX STI (now known simply as WRX STI) 2004 - current * Subaru Outback 1996 - current * Subaru Forester 1997 - current * Subaru BRZ 2013 - current * Subaru Crosstrek 2013 - current * Subaru Ascent 2019 - current ===Past models=== * Subaru 360 1968 - 1970 * Subaru 1100 1971 * Subaru 1300 1972 * Subaru 1400 1973 - 1976 * Subaru 1600 1977 - 1979 * Subaru BRAT 1978 - 1987 * Subaru DL/GL 1980 - 1989 * Subaru XT 1985 - 1991 * Subaru Justy 1987 - 1994 * Subaru Loyale 1990 - 1994 * Subaru SVX 1992 - 1997 * Subaru Baja 2003 - 2006 * Subaru Tribeca 2006 - 2014 == Motorsports == With the rise of rally racing, and the import scene in the U.S., the introduction of the highly anticipated Subaru Impreza WRX in 2001 was successful in bringing high performance, AWD compact cars into the sports car mainstream. Subaru supplies a factory-backed team for Rally America, and has won the driver's title in five of the seasons.
