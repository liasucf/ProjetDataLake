After garnering over one million views, the video was removed from the service at the request of Sam Cooke's music publishers. Following the popularization of this video, Jin began meeting with record labels, music business executives, and major network reality television shows. However, instead of partnering with a third-party, the musician decided to pursue his music career independently. A few months later, Jin appeared as a principal actor singing in a scene on U.S. TV series House of Cards. In 2014, Jin appeared on Christian radio network Moody Radio for an interview on the Chris Fabry Live program discussing his plans to take a leap of faith with limited musical experience. === 2015\u20132016: Kairos === Jin began his journey by packing up his entire life into two suitcases moving to New York City. Jin spent 3 months recording his debut album, titled KAIROS, with the help of his long time friend and the album's producer, Tim Ouyang of Tim Be Told. On October 6, 2015, Jin released his ten track debut studio album, Kairos. Jin appeared on ABC News numerous times for interviews and guest performances of \"Wild Creatures\" (Kairos) and \"Ain't About Love\" (Kairos). On August 28, 2020, Jin released a 31-track Kairos Super Deluxe album consisting of the original 10 songs as well as 21 bonus tracks that included live acoustic versions, a handful of special alternative versions, and instrumentals. The super deluxe also includes an in-depth commentary with album producer, Tim, as well as a special final track which includes Korean translation lyrics of Amen spoken by Jin's own birth mother. === 2017:Baltimore Boulevard === On November 3, 2017, Jin released his sophomore effort Baltimore Boulevard, an album collection of songs written over a 2 year span. In the same month, he was awarded a WeWork Creator Award given to those who \"bring new ideas into the world\". Jin was also invited to share his life story on stage at Madison Square Garden during the WeWork Global Summit. === 2018\u20132019: Letters & Drinks === On June 29, 2018, Jin released his third full-length album. Atwood Magazine's Mitch Mosk wrote: \"echoing the likes of Fun (band) and Jason Mraz, and with a voice like Sam Smith, Jin appeals to the deepest part of our souls \u2013 that tender, vulnerable side we too often build walls around. His songs truly come from the heart, whether he's dealing with tragedy as on \"Six Feet Above\", honoring family (his stepfather) as on \"Father's Land\", or trying to leave the world a better place \u2013 as in album opener \"Dance with Me\". His hit single, 11:11 has won him numerous songwriting awards, including the John Lennon Songwriting Award in 2019. He was also chosen as 8 finalists out of over 800 contestants for the prestigious NewSong Music Competition in Asheville, NC in November, 2019. === 2020\u2013present: singles, upcoming 4th album, & Winter EP === Jin released two original standalone singles \"So Wrong\" and \"Love U Like That\" in January and March respectively and will be releasing 3 additional standalone singles, \"The Cost (of Loving You),\" \"Castaway,\" and \"Pages.\" The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States postponed touring plans but Jin began recording his 4th studio album in July 2020 and will also be releasing a 31 track Super Deluxe version of his debut KAIROS album on August 28, 2020. == Touring == Jin played his first casual concerts as a solo artist in 2014 at various venues around the National Capital Region including Jammin' Java and Ebenezers Coffeehouse.

He attended Chantilly High School. Having spent 20 years in Baltimore, Maryland, he considers Baltimore his hometown. He has a Korean mother, Mihye, and a Caucasian stepfather, John Whiteside, who he considers his real father. At the age of 17, Jin was diagnosed with a terminal blood-bone marrow disorder. He underwent experimental chemotherapy at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Five years later, while he was a pre-med student at Johns Hopkins University, the illness returned, and Jin repeated the same chemotherapy, becoming the second patient in history to receive the treatment twice. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University, went on to partially complete an MPH degree from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and spent many years working in healthcare management at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, social enterprise and workforce development in East Baltimore (Baltimore), as well as time spent in the startup world. As Jin was preparing to commence a dual graduate degree in Medicine and Business (MD/MBA program), he chose instead to pursue a career in music at the end of 2014. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
