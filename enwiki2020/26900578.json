The song was chosen internally by broadcaster France 3. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Ba\u00efleche performed 19th in the running order, following Norway and preceding Poland. Although not dissimilar in style and structure to the previous year's \"Il faut du temps\", \"Monts et merveilles\" fared less well and at the close of voting had picked up only 19 points (the highest an 8 from Bosnia-Herzegovina - who had voted by jury rather than televote), placing France 18th of the 26 entries. The 12 points from the French televote were awarded to Belgium.ESC History - France 2003 France automatically qualified for the grand final of the 2004 Contest; as part of the \"Big Four\". ===Points awarded by France=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Points awarded to France (final) |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | |} ==See also== *France in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 2003 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 Category:France in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:2003 in French music ",
