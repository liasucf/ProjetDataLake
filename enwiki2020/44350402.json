    "text": "Jonatas Figueira Fernandes (born 16 January 1992), known simply as J\u00f4 or J\u00f4 Fernandes, is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a striker. J\u00f4 started his career with Corinthians, progressing through their youth system. He was the team's top scorer in the 2011 Copa S\u00e3o Paulo de Futebol J\u00fanior. Although he was considered one of the club's top prospects, J\u00f4 had a series of disciplinary problems in his early career, which caused him to quit professional football in 2012. He had a short stint playing futsal in 2013, and in 2015, J\u00f4 made his return to association football. He was the 2015 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie D top scorer and led his hometown club S\u00e3o Caetano to the quarterfinals. Following a number of successive knee injuries which kept him out of the 2017 season, he retired in February 2018. == Early life == J\u00f4 was born in S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul, S\u00e3o Paulo, to Marisa Figueira and M\u00e1rio Fernandes. He regularly played football in the streets of the Ol\u00edmpico neighbourhood, and during his childhood, he lived close to Est\u00e1dio Anacleto Campanella. J\u00f4 was a fan of his hometown club, and used to watch over cars in order to get money to buy S\u00e3o Caetano tickets. He began playing futsal at SERC Santa Maria. At age six, he joined Corinthians' youth futsal teams. After scoring eight goals in a futsal match, at the request of youth coach Z\u00e9 Augusto, J\u00f4 made the switch to association football, joining Corinthians' under-17 team. In 2008, at the age of 16, he signed his first professional contract with Tim\u00e3o. == Club career == === Corinthians === J\u00f4 scored five goals in the 2009 U-17 Campeonato Paulista, and in September 2009, he extender his contract with Corinthians until 30 October 2011. He was also the club's top scorer in the 2010 U-20 Campeonato Paulista. J\u00f4 was part of the squad that played in the 2011 Copa S\u00e3o Paulo de Futebol J\u00fanior. He led the team in scoring with four goals in four matches during the tournament but couldn't help Tim\u00e3o get past the round of 32. Nevertheless, his play impressed first- team manager Tite, who called him up to the senior squad on 18 January 2011, two days after the U-20 side was eliminated from Copa S\u00e3o Paulo, losing to Desportivo Brasil. He was expected to be the future replacement of star striker Ronaldo.While in the youth ranks of Corinthians, J\u00f4 was already infamous for his disciplinary problems. He missed several appointments without giving any explanation and regularly went out clubbing and drinking. He also had a strained relationship with club doctor Joaquim Grava, as well as with club director Afonso Harmonia, who said of J\u00f4: \"He's a 19-year-old boy with a BMW X1. If he would ride a bus to practice [...] The problem with him is the excess of vodka.\" Before a Campeonato Paulista match against S\u00e3o Bernardo. After Grava ruled him out of the game due to a meniscus injury on his right knee, J\u00f4 insisted on playing and had a quarrel with the club doctor. After the argument, J\u00f4 was absent from the team's training sessions for a few days and asked to be released by the club. === Gr\u00eamio === On 8 June 2011, J\u00f4 signed a four-year deal with Gr\u00eamio, the same club that his older brother M\u00e1rio Fernandes was playing for. Gr\u00eamio director C\u00e9sar Cidade Dias, aware of J\u00f4's disciplinary problems and injury history, said of him: \"We know all about J\u00f4's past, but we also know that he's a good kid and he's very talented. Here, it's a new life, we'll try and I'm sure we'll make an exceptional player out of him.\" He was expected to play in the club's under-20 team. However, J\u00f4 failed to make a single appearance for the Tricolor Ga\u00facho due to an ankle injury, and returned to Corinthians two months later.Irm\u00e3o de M\u00e1rio Fernandes volta para o Corinthians (Brother of M\u00e1rio Fernandes returns to Corinthians); RBS, 23 August 2011 === S\u00e3o Caetano === On 27 February 2012, J\u00f4 signed with S\u00e9rie B side S\u00e3o Caetano.

On 25 September 2014, J\u00f4 was loaned to Portuguesa for one year. He did not play in a single match for the club due to injuries.Portuguesa acerta com Bruno Moraes, ex-Santos; J\u00f4 Fernandes tamb\u00e9m chega (Portuguesa signs with Bruno Moraes, former Santos player; J\u00f4 Fernandes also arrives) ; Lusa News, 26 September 2014 He also had a trial with Russian club CSKA Moscow in 2014, but did not sign a contract due to his long-term absence from professional football. After his hiatus from professional football, J\u00f4 returned to S\u00e3o Caetano for the 2015 season. Weighing over 100 kg, he wasn't included in the squad that played in the 2015 Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A2, but kept training with the first team, getting in shape to play in the 2015 S\u00e9rie D. On 12 July 2015, head coach Lu\u00eds Carlos Martins put J\u00f4 in the starting lineup for S\u00e3o Caetano's first S\u00e9rie D match. Fourteen minutes into the match, J\u00f4 scored his first ever senior-level goal, following a Robson Fernandes assist. He would score again five minutes later, leading his team to a 5\u20130 home victory over Lajeadense. On 3 August, J\u00f4 opened the scoring with two goals in a 3\u20132 away win against Metropolitano. Two weeks later, he netted another brace against the same opponent, this time at Anacleto Campanella. He repeated the feat in the next two matches, reaching four consecutive S\u00e9rie D games in which he scored a brace. With his disciplinary problems now in the past, J\u00f4 returned to his best form, scoring 11 goals in the eight matches of the S\u00e9rie D first stage. In the first leg of the round of 16 fixture against Coruripe, J\u00f4 netted his 12th goal of the season as Azul\u00e3o defeated the home side 3\u20130. Although S\u00e3o Caetano failed to achieve promotion and were eliminated by eventual champions Botafogo de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto in the quarterfinals, the club had the best offensive record in S\u00e9rie D, with 26 goals scored, and J\u00f4 finished as the league's top goalscorer. J\u00f4 made his first appearance of the 2016 season in the opening match, a 0\u20130 draw with Batatais on 30 January 2016, playing the full 90 minutes. Four days later, he scored his first goal of the season with the winner in a 2\u20131 victory over Rio Branco at Anacleto Campanella. In the following match, against Votuporanguense, on 6 February, J\u00f4 scored a brace and led his team to a 3\u20130 away win. His sixth career multi-goal match came against Taubat\u00e9 on 3 April, in a 4\u20133 home win that helped Azul\u00e3o reach the top of the table. J\u00f4 finished the 2016 Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A2 as S\u00e3o Caetano's top goalscorer, with seven goals scored in 17 matches. His first hat-trick came in a 3\u20130 victory over Flamengo de Guarulhos in the Copa Paulista on 24 July 2016. Since midway through the 2015 S\u00e9rie D, J\u00f4 started taking injections for his right knee, on which he had surgery two times earlier in his career. Although a third surgery was needed, J\u00f4 kept on postponing it in order to keep playing. While suffering from knee pain, he managed to lead S\u00e3o Caetano to the semifinals of the 2016 Copa Paulista, scoring five goals during the tournament. In November 2016, J\u00f4 underwent right knee surgery for the third time in his playing career, which would kept him out of the remainder of the season. Although he was expected to be fit for the 2017 Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A2, an infection prompted him to undergo another surgery to his knee. J\u00f4 made his return for S\u00e3o Caetano on 30 September 2017 after coming on as a 88th-minute substitute in a 3\u20132 victory against Desportivo Brasil. J\u00f4 did not play in the remainder of the Copa Paulista, instead choosing to practice in order to get fit for the 2018 Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A1. J\u00f4 got the 2018 season underway in S\u00e3o Caetano's 2\u20130 away win against Linense on 24 January. He played the first half of the match before being subbed out. Three days later, J\u00f4 was also named in the starting lineup for the match against Novorizontino, but again was subbed out during half time. On 1 February 2018, he angrily left in the middle of a training session and asked to be released by the club. J\u00f4 cited his inability to keep on playing due to constant pain on his right knee as the reason for this, and at age 26, he retired from professional football. == Personal life == J\u00f4's older brother, M\u00e1rio, is also a footballer and member of the Russian national football team. Alongside M\u00e1rio and his father, they run a seven-a-side football team called Brothers MJ. ==Honours== ===Club=== S\u00e3o Caetano * Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A2: 2017 ===Individual=== * S\u00e9rie D top scorer: 2015 (12 goals) == References == == External links == * * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie D players Category:Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Desportiva S\u00e3o Caetano players Category:Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Desportos players Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista players Category:Gr\u00eamio Foot- Ball Porto Alegrense players ",
