    "text": "Charles Ruley \"Tod\" Brynan (July 1863 \u2013 May 10, 1925) was a right-handed pitcher/outfielder in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Stockings (later the Cubs) and Boston Beaneaters (now the Atlanta Braves). Brynan debuted with the White Stockings on June 22, 1888 against the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. He pitched in three games that season, completing two, on his way to posting a record of 2\u20131 with an inflated 6.48 ERA. He also made one appearance in left field during his tenure with the Stockings. At the plate that season, he hit .182 with a triple and an RBI in 11 trips to the plate. Brynan would not resurface until May 26, 1891, pitching for the Beaneaters. He started that game on the mound but did not last long, getting pulled after a disastrous first inning in which he allowed six earned runs on four hits and three walks for an unfortunate ERA of 54.00. He also played in the minors in the Southern Association in 1886, Northwestern League in 1887, Western Association from 1888 to 1889 and Michigan State League in 1889. ==References== Category:1863 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Chicago White Stockings players Category:Boston Beaneaters players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:Nashville Americans players Category:Memphis Grays players Category:Duluth Freezers players Category:Minneapolis Millers (baseball) players Category:St. Paul Apostles players Category:Des Moines Prohibitionists players Category:Milwaukee Brewers (minor league) players Category:Milwaukee Creams players Category:Grand Rapids (minor league baseball) players Category:19th-century baseball players ",
