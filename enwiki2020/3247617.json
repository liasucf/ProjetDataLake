    "text": "General ticket representation is a voting system comparable to block voting, except for the fact that voters elect parties, not candidates. The parties then select their representatives to fill out elected office. General ticket systems are or were used in elections to the US House of Representatives; in France, beginning in the Third Republic; in Italy and in Singapore. ==Examples== ===France=== The scrutin de liste (Fr. scrutin, voting by ballot, and liste, a list) was, before World War I, a system of election of national representatives in France by which the electors of a department voted for all the deputies to be elected in that department. It was comparable with the general ticket. It was distinguished from the scrutin d'arrondissement, also called scrutin uninominal, under which the electors in each arrondissement voted only for the deputy to be elected in it. Nowadays, it is used on two- round bases to elect one third of the members of the regional councils, so as to ensure a landslide victory to the party which receives a majority. ===Italy=== In Italy, general ticket representation is the system that has been used to elect one fifth of the members of the regional councils since 1995. As in the French version, its goal is to ensure that the assembly is controlled by the leading coalition of parties. Unlike France, it is used on a single round of voting. ===Singapore=== In Singapore, the general ticket system, locally known as the , is used to elect members of the Parliament of Singapore from multi-member districts known as group representation constituencies (GRCs), on a first-past-the-post basis. This operates in parallel to elections from single-member district and nominations. ===United States=== For convenience or in order to assure majority control, many states adopted general ticket representation to elect the multiple members of a state delegation to the House of Representatives. In doing so, those states ensured that a group which might be a majority in only a portion of the state would always be outvoted by the larger majority throughout the state. States using this method elected their entire delegation in a statewide manner, either on a single ballot (by means of bloc voting) or on separate ballots for each seat, but always allowing every voter in the state to vote for a candidate for each seat. It was a system used frequently until restricted by the 1842 Apportionment Bill and subsequent legislation, most recently in 1967.Public Law 90-196, ) After 1842, it has continued to be used in rare instances, typically states with small delegations or admitted to the union since the last census. The following is a table of every instance of the use of the general ticket in the United States Congress. {| class=\"wikitable mw- collapsible mw-collapsed\" ! Congress ! Dates !
