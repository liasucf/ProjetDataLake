Retrieved on June 30, 2010. The band has performed at multiple live venues and festivals around the world since 2011, and plans to release a new album in 2021. Coroner's music combines elements of thrash, classical music, avant-garde music, progressive rock, jazz, and industrial metal with suitably gruff vocals. With their increasingly complex style of progressive rock-infused thrash, they have been called \"the Rush of thrash metal\".[ Coroner biography at AMG]. Allmusic. Retrieved on May 8, 2008. Coroner's sound then progressed and the production became more refined, resulting in the more progressive albums No More Color (1989), Mental Vortex (1991) and Grin (1993). ==History== ===Career and breakup=== The Swiss thrash trio Coroner were originally road crew for Celtic Frost. They eventually cut their own songs, recording their demo Death Cult in 1986 with Tom G. Warrior of Celtic Frost on vocals. Their first full-length album R.I.P., released in 1987, featured bass player Ron Broder on vocals and he assumed the role for the rest of the group's existence. The group released four more albums through to 1993, ending with a greatest hits collection, Coroner, in 1995. Lack of media exposure brought this band to disbanding in 1995 \u2014 and to their farewell tour consequent to their self-titled album in January and February 1996. ===Reunion=== In March 2005, talks of a reunion were in the works, but later retracted. The main reason was that neither Marky, Ron, nor Tommy had the time it would require to do this properly, and also that none of them liked to \"reheat things, except spaghetti sauce.\" In June 2010, however, Coroner announced that they would reunite for next year's installments of Maryland Deathfest, Hellfest Summer Open Air and Bloodstock Open Air. The band was asked if they were planning to write a new album. Guitarist Tommy Vetterli replied, \"you know, making a new album is kind of difficult... (Pause) Well, you never know. Maybe after four or five shows we'll get into it and say, 'Hey! Let's do an album!' Nobody knows what's going to happen. We don't have a master plan\".Coroner Guitarist On Possibility Of New Studio Album: 'You Never Know'. Blabbermouth.net. Retrieved on July 9, 2010. In April 2011, drummer Marky Edelmann was asked why Coroner decided to reunite after their 15-year break up. He replied, \"It was a total trip; it was really like a time warp. It was totally strange. Sometimes you could play the songs automatically; it was still somehow programmed. It was really funny; your arms go left and right, and you don't know why. 'Oh, wow, that's why. I have to hit this cymbal right now.' [Laughs] So that was really quite a trip. It makes me feel like being [brought] back [in time] 15 years or more. And I missed playing drums, totally. That was also something I'm very happy about now \u2014 to just play drums.\" Marky also stated that a new Coroner album was not in the cards, but he also stated that the band could reissue their back catalog.Coroner Drummer Says There Has Been No Talk Of Recording New Studio Album.

Retrieved on November 22, 2018. however, it did not surface in 2017 and there had been no news about the album until April 2020, when Coroner announced via Twitter that they were \"going to record a NEW album this year.\" ==Evolution and style== Musically, Coroner evolved from a speed metal band with gothic and classical overtones like Celtic Frost and Bathory into a technical metal band. Coroner's first album, R.I.P., was based on neoclassical lines and was technical and classically influenced. The second album, Punishment for Decadence, saw a progression into a more complex sound with a unison of bass and guitar. Tempo changes interspersed mid-paced sections and the odd slow passage between the faster passages started to emerge. Lyrically, Coroner began to write about themes such as politics and personal introspection. No More Color was produced by Pete Hinton and the band. Coroner's music became more technical on No More Color as the guitar work was characterized by intricate modes and arpeggios, solo work that was chromatically colorful, as well as the de rigueur crunchy chords and speed runs; the drumming went beyond the 4/4 time of Coroner's two previous albums to incorporate unusual time signatures which became their trademark. Ron Royce's bass playing is also worth a mention as having an advanced three- finger technique which enables him to double the rhythm line as well as perform more intricate riffs. Prime examples of this are the opener \"Die By My Hand\" with its vicious riffing and the harmonic minor inspired riff in the middle of \"Mistress of Deception\". The closer \"Last Entertainment\" is a prescient take on TV. The opening track \"Die By My Hand\" is a classic piece of prog come thrash metal. It is technical but also brutal. Mental Vortex continued the evolution over No More Color. Continuing with the previous album's technical formula, the speed metal formula was re-integrated into Coroner's sound on this album but with a tone that made it sound not at all like R.I.P. or Punishment for Decadence. There were slower songs but none of the songs on Mental Vortex stayed the same speed for very long. The songs on Mental Vortex ranged from four to eight minutes. The last track \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" is a cover of The Beatles song, and a video was shot of it. Overall, the tone was a shift from the thrash/technical of No More Color which showed them gravitating towards their opus Grin. Grin saw a much more industrial sound and was a natural progression from Mental Vortex but was different from most of their previous material. It involved reflective guitar riffs and underlying bass line. It was a slower record and more refined in its metal sensibility. Brooding guitar over Royce's bass produced an almost hypnotic trance-like sound on some tracks. The lead guitar still shone on all tracks. Their eponymous album, Coroner, was a compilation which contained unreleased material, a selection of hits from previous albums, and a remix of the title song from the previous album Grin. The band appears on Br\u00fctal Legend with the song \"Skeleton On Your Shoulder\". ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *R.I.P.
