    "text": "Side view of the mummy Usermontu is an ancient Egyptian mummy exhibited at the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum of San Jose, California.Caption of the remains, from the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum (inv. No: RC 1779). The name Usermontu \u2013 which means, \"Powerful is Montu\" \u2013 almost certainly does not match the still- unknown name originally belonged to the mummified man. The mistake arose because long after death the mummy was placed in a coffin originally belonged to another man, a priest named Usermontu, and was still inside of it at the time of rediscovery. The mummy is very well preserved, and is also known for having an ancient but sophisticated prosthetic pin in its left knee. ==History== In 1971, the Rosicrucian Museum acquired two sealed ancient Egyptian coffins from Neiman- Marcus. Unbeknownst to all, one of the coffin still contained the mummy which was discovered soon after the purchase. On the basis of the embalming type originally provided to \u201cUsermontu\u201d, it is believed that he was an upper-class Egyptian male who likely lived during the New Kingdom of Egypt (between 16th\u201311th century BCE). For a reason that remains unknown to us, several centuries after death his corpse was put inside the coffin of the \u201creal\u201d Usermontu who lived during the 26th Dynasty. Some time around 400 BCE, as suggested by radiocarbon dating, the body underwent another wrapping with linen bandages which are still visible today. There is no clue of where the coffin and the mummy originally came from. In life the man should have been a natural redhead and his mummy is about tall. ===Prosthetic pin=== In August 1995, BYU professor C. Wilfred Griggs performed some X-ray scans on the Rosicrucian mummies and discovered the presence of a iron-made orthopedic screw inside \u201cUsermontu\u201d's left knee. Griggs initially believed that the pin was inserted in modern times in order to reattach the leg to the rest of the body, so he later obtained permission to unwrap the leg and directly examine the pin in order to solve the mystery. After the examination, Griggs realized that the pin could not be inserted in modern times, and must have been placed after the man's death but before his burial, a hypothesis confirmed by further analysis. The pin was held in place by an organic resin, analogous to modern bone cement. By doing so, those who performed the operation ensured the integrity of the body, required for the ancient Egyptian afterlife. ==References== Category:Ancient Egyptian priests Category:Ancient Egyptian mummies Category:2nd-millennium BC births Category:2nd-millennium BC deaths ",
