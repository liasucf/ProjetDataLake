He scored two goals for in an extraordinary match between Charlton Athletic and Huddersfield Town that took place on 21 December 1957 at Charlton Athletic's home ground, The Valley. Charlton played most of the match with 10 men after their captain Derek Ufton was injured, and Huddersfield were leading 5\u20131 with just 27 minutes remaining. At that point, Johnny Summers began an extraordinary passage of play in which he scored five goals and assisted with two others to allow Charlton to win 7\u20136. Huddersfield become the first, and still the only, team to score six goals in an English Football League match - or indeed any other professional football match - and still be on the losing side. ==References== ==External links== *Falkirk FC obituary * Category:1936 births Category:2014 deaths Category:AFC Bournemouth players Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:Falkirk F.C. players Category:Association football forwards Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Motherwell F.C. players Category:Footballers from Edinburgh Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish footballers Category:English Football League players Category:Date of death missing ",
