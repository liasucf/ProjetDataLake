The event made its debut in the FIA World Rally Championship during the 2004 season. From 2004 to 2007, the event was held on the twisty and narrow gravel roads of the Tokachi region near Obihiro. For the 2008 season, the event was moved to the region close to Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d's main city. Rally Japan was not held in 2009, but returned in 2010 for one year. Rally Japan will return in 2020 to the new location of Nagoya, but was cancelled on August 19 due to COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. It is confirmed to make its debut in 2021 as the first tarmac-based rally before Spain. ==History== A Daihatsu competitor during a stage in Rikubetsu in 2006. Rally Hokkaido was first organised as part of the 2002 Asia-Pacific Rally Championship on the northern island of Hokkaid\u014d. After two successful rallies the event was renamed Rally Japan and promoted to the 2004 World Rally Championship schedule. The rally was won by the 2003 world champion Petter Solberg of the Subaru World Rally Team. For 2005 the World and Asia-Pacific Rally events were split into two separate event with the APRC round returning to the Rally Hokkaido name. The 2005 Rally Japan was held on September 30 through October 2. Headquarters and the service park were located in and near Obihiro, Hokkaid\u014d. The rally was won by Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm in a Peugeot 307 WRC 1:22.1 ahead of S\u00e9bastien Loeb in a Citro\u00ebn Xsara WRC. This was the last of the three world rally wins for the 307 WRC, and also the last win for the Peugeot factory team. The 2006 event was won by Loeb 5.6 seconds ahead of Gr\u00f6nholm.

It featured 27 special stages, and was won by Mikko Hirvonen of BP Ford World Rally Team. This win was third in Hirvonen's career as a top level rally driver. The 2007 edition of the event was also remarkable for the retirements of both 2007 title contenders on the same rally; Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm retired on the first day of the rally after heavily damaging the roll cage of his Ford Focus RS WRC 07 on stage four. S\u00e9bastien Loeb retired on the next leg of the rally after his co-driver Daniel Elena called out the wrong pace note instruction for the first time in ten years. In December 2007, Rally Japan organisers announced that for the 2008 WRC season the event will move from Obihiro to Sapporo, the biggest city in Hokkaid\u014d. The 2008 Rally Japan featured 29 stages, including five super specials at the Sapporo Dome. The event saw Hirvonen take his second win in Japan in a row, ahead of his teammate Jari-Matti Latvala and Citro\u00ebn Total's S\u00e9bastien Loeb, who secured a record fifth title with his third-place finish. The rally also featured a bad crash by Fran\u00e7ois Duval, which injured his co-driver Patrick Pivato. ==Past winners== Mikko Hirvonen during a road section of the 2007 Rally Japan. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" |- !
