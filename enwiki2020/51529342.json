    "text": "The Octopus Frontier is a 1960 poetry collection by American writer Richard Brautigan. It is Brautigan's fourth poetry publication and his second collection of poetry, and includes 22 poems. ==Contents== The Octopus Frontier includes 22 poems: All but 5 of the poems were republished in the 1968 collection, The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster. ==Reception== In the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Caroline Bokinsky said the collection \"continues Brautigan's creation of order and meaning from objects in the literal world by using them to construct a fantasy world within his own imagination.\" Citing several examples, she describes the ways in which Brautigan makes connections and associations to lead readers through his imagination, acting \"as a painter, in a meticulous step-by-step process, putting each object in a specific place to create a painting.\" Fellow poet Richard McClure said the poems \"are filled with large simple images of vegetables and pumpkins floating on the tide, a poem about Ophelia, and poems about childhood.\" According to McClure, it was at this point in Brautigan's writing that there emerged \"a recognizable Brautigan style [...] but there is no indication that this work is greatly above the level of much North Beach poetry.\" ==Cover== The Octopus Frontier is the first Brautigan work to feature a photograph on the cover. The image, by San Francisco-based photographer Gui de Angelo, shows a person's feet standing on a six-foot octopus tentacle Brautigan bought for the purpose from a Chinatown fishmonger and carried to the roof of a building in North Beach. It has been described as being \"striking and just misses being sinister\". ==References== ==External links== * includes listing of contents, text of poems, and commentary Category:American poetry collections Category:Works by Richard Brautigan Category:1960 poetry books ",
