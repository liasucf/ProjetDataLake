Stacy Lemmens was the daughter of Thierry Lemmens and Christiane Granziero. Granziero had been found guilty of child neglect and was arrested on January 17, 2008 for drug trafficking.Search for sisters widens as Belgian nightmare returns, Daily Telegraph ==Disappearance== On June 10, 2006 at 01:00, the two were playing outside the bar \"Aux Armuriers\" in the borough Saint-L\u00e9onard, while Catherine Dizier and her friend Thierry Lemmens were inside, reportedly drunk. Around 3 a.m., their disappearance was noticed and the police and Child Focus alerted. ==Investigation== On June 13, the prime suspect, Abdallah Ait- Oud, turned himself in after seeing his photo on television. He denied having anything to do with the case and claimed to have an alibi. However, it was established that he was in the cafe that night. Moreover, he has a history of child abuse, for which he was incarcerated. He was released in December 2005 from a mental hospital after raping two minors, one being his niece. He never admitted to his previous crimes. On June 28, the bodies of both girls were found in a sewer in Li\u00e8ge, some 400 metres from the bar \"Aux Armuriers\".Police discover body of young girl, VRT Nieuws The Justice Department confirmed that the girls were murdered by strangulation, while Nathalie's body showed the signs of sexual abuse.

Vindplaats meisjes gemeld bij De Telegraaf, De Telegraaf The Justice Department also confirmed that DNA of a third person has been found on the bodies. The identity of this third person has not yet been established, since incredibly, there are still no conclusive results of the DNA analysis. His slight injuries and traces found on his clothes when Ait-Oud turned himself in are consistent with those he would have suffered when dumping the girls in the place they were found.

The suspect, of Slavic-Italian appearance, drove away in a Volkswagen Golf with a German license plate, together with an accomplice. ==Criminal trial and sentence== On June 10, 2008, Abdallah Ait Oud was found guilty by a jury of kidnapping, rape and murder of the children, and sentenced to life imprisonment (which, under the Belgian law, is most of the time not fully served in prison but later on changed into a suspended sentence).
