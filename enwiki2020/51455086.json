    "text": "Celebs Go Dating is a British dating reality series. It began broadcasting on 29 August 2016 on E4, with the first series having 15 episodes. Paul Carrick Brunson and Anna Williamson currently appear as the dating agents, with Tom Read Wilson as a client coordinator. Rob Beckett narrates the series. The eighth series of Celebs Go Dating began airing on 24 February 2020, and after the conclusion of the series, it was announced that a ninth series had been commissioned. ==Development and production== It was announced in March 2016 that E4 had commissioned a new reality dating series which sees celebrities go on dates with members of the public. Filming for the first series started in August 2016, with the programme premiering later that month. The first series was made up of 15 episodes, airing every weekday. In 2017, a second and third series was confirmed to air in early and late 2017, with 20 episodes per series. Series two saw the return of Joey Essex who broke the rules in the first series when he started dating a celebrity on the series. During the filming of series two, Stephen Bear brought many problems to the dating agency, breaking the rules of the show by dating another celebrity outside of the series; this led to his removal from the programme. It was announced on the official Celebs Go Dating Twitter account that the third series of the show will feature same-sex relationships for the first time. In September 2017, it was confirmed that the series would return for a fourth series in 2018. The fourth series also features same-sex relationships. The series was renewed for a fifth and sixth series in 2018. In 2019, the Celebs Go Dating was renewed for a seventh and eighth series. In June 2020, it was announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the programme would return with a special series titled Celebs Go Virtual Dating. With five 30-minute episodes, the series began airing on 27 July 2020. ==Broadcast== The first and second series of Celebs Go Dating aired every weeknight on E4 with a repeat at the weekend on Sunday morning. The third series was due to end on 29 September 2017, however an episode that was due to be aired on 15 September 2017 did not air, seemingly pulled from broadcast moments before its scheduled starting time. The show's social media accounts even posted the trailer for the evening's episode hours before airing. An E4 spokesman cited \"editorial reasons\" and said the show will return on Monday 17 September. In the fourth series, Celebs Go Dating began to air during the week and weekend, but there was no episode on Fridays or Saturdays. The Celebs Go Virtual Dating series was aired weekly on Monday evenings, marking it as the first time the programme had been transmitted weekly. ==Series and cast== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; margin:auto;\" |- !
