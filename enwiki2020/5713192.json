    "text": "Nakijin Castle, identified as Hokuzan's capital The is a period in the history of the Okinawa Islands when three polities, namely , and , are said to have co-existed on Okinawa. It is said to have started during King Tamagusuku's reign (traditional dates: 1314\u20131336) and, according to Sai On's edition of the Ch\u016bzan Seifu, ended in 1429 when Sh\u014d Hashi unified the island. Historical records of the period are fragmentary and mutually conflicting. Some even question the co-existence of the three polities. == Contemporary sources == Okinawa does not have their own contemporary records of the Sanzan period. Contemporary sources are limited to Chinese and, to a far lesser extent, Korean diplomatic records. They are in a fragmentary fashion and probably overshadowed by diplomatic fictions. Since the Chinese sources simply record local rulers who contacted China, they do not rule out the possibility that some other local rulers co-existed without establishing diplomatic contacts. For this reason, Okinawa's real situation remains largely a mystery. According to the Veritable Records of the Ming, the newly formed Ming dynasty sent an envoy to what it called the \"State of Ry\u016bky\u016b,\" among many other countries, in 1372 to start tributary relations. In response, a ruler who was referred to as Satto, King of Ch\u016bzan, sent his younger brother Taiki to pay tribute. In 1380, the King of Nanzan Ofusato sent a mission to Ming China, which was followed by the King of Hokuzan Haniji in 1383. The names of Hokuzan and Nanzan are apparently Ch\u016bzan-centric. It is not clear who coined these names. Ming China's perception of the co-existence of the Sanzan can be found in an article of 1383 of the Veritable Records, which was based on the report of a Ming envoy who visited Okinawa in 1382. The Ming considered that there were three rulers in the region who engaged in conflict. It recognized them as \"kings\" and called for peace. As for the King of Hokuzan, the Veritable Records record the un-Okinawan-looking names of three kings, Haniji, Min and Han'anchi, but make no mention of their blood relations. The last diplomatic contact of Hokuzan was of 1416. The records of Nanzan are more complicated. The diplomatic missions under the name of the King of Nanzan Ofusato lasted from 1380 to 1396. An unusual characteristic of Nanzan was that the \"King's father's younger brother\" (\u738b\u53d4) \u014ceiji also sent envoys from 1388 to 1397. In 1403, Ououso, who claimed to be Ofusato's younger brother or cousin, reported Ofusato's death in 1403 and was recognized as King of Nanzan the next year. In 1415, Crown Prince Taromai reported that King Ououso had been murdered by his \"elder brother\" Tafuchi. Taromai's blood relationship with Ououso was not mentioned. As the King of Nanzan, Taromai sent envoys from 1416 to 1429. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea records mysterious events about Nanzan. In 1394, the King of Ch\u016bzan Satto requested Korea to return the \"Nanzan Prince\" (\u5c71\u5357\u738b\u5b50) Ofusato, who had supposedly fled to Korea. In 1398, the King of Nanzan Oueishi fled to Korea after reportedly being banished by the King of Ch\u016bzan. He died there in the same year. These records clearly contradict with the Veritable Records, raising questions about the reliability of Okinawa's diplomatic reports to foreign countries. Ch\u016bzan sent envoys to China much more frequently than Hokuzan and Nanzan. The King of Ch\u016bzan paid tribute biennially from 1372 to 1382 and after that once or twice a year. Ch\u016bzan's missions were also unusual in that some of them were sent under the name of the crown prince although it should have been done by the king. In 1404, Crown Prince Bunei reported King Satto's death and was recognized as the next king. In 1407, Crown Prince Sh\u014d Shish\u014d's envoy reported his \"father\" Bunei's death to seek the approval of the succession to the throne. An article of 1425 in the Veritable Records states that Ming China let Crown Prince Sh\u014d Hashi succeed the late King Shish\u014d. Historians have noted suspicious patterns in the Sanzans' diplomatic missions. While Ming China bestowed vessels and their crews on Ch\u016bzan and Nanzan, Hokuzan has no such record. This may explain why Hokuzan's missions almost always coincided with Ch\u016bzan's even though they were supposedly in conflict. In addition, staffs in the missions were apparently shared. For example, Sangurumi, who was sent to China by the Nanzan King in 1392, claimed to be a nephew (\u59ea) of the King of Nanzan Ofusato. In Ch\u016bzan's missions, however, he appeared as a nephew (\u5f93\u5b50) of the King of Ch\u016bzan Satto in 1403 and as a nephew (\u59ea) of the Ch\u016bzan King Bunei in 1404. Even though historian Wada Hisanori regarded him as multiple persons with the same name, Wada acknowledged that the King of Nanzan Taromai's envoys and vessels clearly overlapped with those of the King of Ch\u016bzan. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty states that in 1418, Katsuren, the second son of the Ch\u016bzan King, called for trade with Korea and sent vessels that carried Chinese and Southeast Asian goods. Historians have no consensus on his true identity. It is noted by historians that the Veritable Records make no mention of the supposed unification. The only thing that can be inferred from the records is that Hokuzan and Nanzan ceased to send diplomatic missions. The King of Ch\u016bzan retained the title of \"King of Ch\u016bzan\" even after he became the sole ruler of the State of Ry\u016bky\u016b. In 1416, the Ashikaga sh\u014dgun sent a letter in reply to the yo-no-nushi of the State of Ry\u016bky\u016b (\u308a\u3046\u304d\u3046\u570b\u306e\u3088\u306e\u306c\u3057). This rare record has been handed down only on the mainland Japanese side. == Okinawa's later narratives == Okinawa's own narratives on the Sanzan period were recorded centuries later by Ry\u016bky\u016b. Major history books include the Ch\u016bzan Seikan (1650), Sai Taku's edition of the Ch\u016bzan Seifu (1701), Sai On's revised edition of the Ch\u016bzan Seifu (from 1724 onwards) and the Ky\u016by\u014d (1745). They reflect Okinawa's historical tradition to some degree. They are, however, desperate attempts to reconcile conflicting sources. Sai On, in particular, extensively rewrote his father's edition of the Ch\u016bzan Seifu using newly obtained Chinese sources. As a result, he damaged its historical value, from modern historians' perspective. Additionally, the Omoro S\u014dshi (1623) is helpful in understanding Okinawa's own world-view although it is a compilation of poems and by no means a history book. The Ch\u016bzan Seikan and Sai Taku's edition of the Ch\u016bzan Seifu follow Chinese sources in that they refer to the supposed polities as , Ch\u016bzan and . For some unknown reason, however, Sai On changed the names of Sanhoku and Sannan to and respectively. A world view presented in the Omoro S\u014dshi is strikingly different from that of the history books. The perception that Okinawa was divided into three polities is absent from the poem anthology. It never uses the terms of Sanzan, Sanhoku, Ch\u016bzan or Sannan. The King of Hokuzan is referred to as Nakijin Aji. The supposed King of Nanzan is \u014czato Aji. Alternatively, he is referred to as . They are no different from other regional rulers. According to Ry\u016bky\u016b's official history books, King Tamagusuku, who had maintained a unified polity, lost the support of local rulers. People in the south followed the \u014czato Aji while the northern region was controlled by the Nakijin Aji. In other words, these books identify the Nakijin Aji as the King of Hokuzan and the \u014czato Aji as the King of Nanzan. Most modern historians question this alleged split because they do not support the existence of a unified polity on Okinawa before the \"reunification\" in the 15th century. No personal names were recorded for the Nakijin Aji in the Ch\u016bzan Seikan or Sai Taku's edition of Ch\u016bzan Seifu. It was not known to Ry\u016bky\u016b how many rulers assumed the title. Sai On's edition of Ch\u016bzan Seifu adds three personal names, Haniji, Min and Han'anchi, which were taken from a Chinese source, not from Okinawa's own. Similarly, the Ch\u016bzan Seikan and Sai Taku's edition of Ch\u016bzan Seifu have no record of personal names of the \u014czato Aji. The names of Sh\u014dsatto, Ououso and Tarumi, added by Sai On to the Ch\u016bzan Seifu, are not based on Okinawa's tradition. Another problem is about the identification of the place of \u014czato. There are two candidates for it: Shimasoe-\u014czato in modern-day Nanj\u014d City and Shimajiri-\u014czato in modern-day Itoman City. In addition, the Omoro S\u014dshi divides southern Okinawa into three regions: the eastern region (covering Shimasoe-\u014czato), the central region and the western region (including Shimajiri-\u014czato). The Ch\u016bzan Seifu identify the Shimasoe-\u014czato Aji as the King of Nanzan, which appears to reflect Okinawa's own narratives. However, both editions of the Ch\u016bzan Seifu identify Shimajiri- \u014czato as the capital of Nanzan. According to the Ch\u016bzan Seikan, the Nakijin Aji's domain included Haneji, Nago, Kunigami, Kin, Ie and Iheya. The \u014czato Aji controlled the 11 regions of Sashiki, Chinen, Tamagusuku, Gushikami, Kochinda, Shimajiri-\u014czato, Kyan, Mabuni, Makabe, Kanegusuku and Tomigusuku. The Ch\u016bzan King subjugated Naha, Tomari, Urasoe, Chatan, Nakagusuku, Goeku, Yomitanzan, Gushikawa, Katsuren and Shuri. Shuri is treated as the everlasting capital of Ch\u016bzan. However, it is clear from literary evidence and archaeological findings that Urasoe was the center of the most powerful polity on the island before the capital was moved to Shuri. The King of Ch\u016bzan Tamagusuku was succeeded by King Seii. After Seii's death, people deposed the crown prince and enthroned Satto, the ruler of Urasoe, in 1350. Although his existence was supported by contemporary sources, his life is colored by mythology: he was a son of a humble farmer and a swan maiden. During his reign, he started to pay tribute to Ming China. Also, he received tribute from the southern island groups of Miyako and Yaeyama for the first time in history. Satto was succeeded by his son Bunei in 1395. Although the history books agree that Sh\u014d Hashi unified Okinawa, the accounts of the unification process contain non- negligible inconsistencies. The oldest Ch\u016bzan Seikan states that after Sh\u014d Hashi succeeded his father Sh\u014d Shish\u014d as Sashiki Aji in 1402, he overthrew the King of Nanzan and claimed the title. He then overthrew the Ch\u016bzan King Bunei in 1421 to become the King of Ch\u016bzan. He finally killed the King of Hokuzan in 1422. Sai Taku's edition of Ch\u016bzan Seifu generally follows the Ch\u016bzan Seikan. However, it dates Sh\u014d Hashi's conquest of Ch\u016bzan 16 years earlier than the Ch\u016bzan Seikan. It also claims that Sh\u014d Hashi installed his father Sh\u014d Shish\u014d as King of Ch\u016bzan instead of himself. Sh\u014d Hashi became the King of Ch\u016bzan only after Sh\u014d Shish\u014d's death in 1421. Sai On's edition of Ch\u016bzan Seifu is drastically different from these two books. It claims that Sh\u014d Hashi defeated the Ch\u016bzan King and installed his father Sh\u014d Shish\u014d in 1406. He conquered Hokuzan in 1416 and Nanzan in 1429. The Ch\u016bzan Seikan seems to follow Okinawa's own tradition. Sai Taku \"corrected\" the Ch\u016bzan Seikan with Chinese records which stated that Sh\u014d Shish\u014d, Crown Prince of Ch\u016bzan, reported the death of \"his father\" Bunei. Sai On's drastic revision was also based on Chinese records. The last diplomatic contact of Nanzan was of 1429 while that of Hokuzan was of 1416. From these records, Sai On na\u00efvely inferred that these two polities ceased to exist immediately after the last contacts. == Interpretations == Modern historians have also struggled to resolve contradictions. Unlike Sai On, Wada Hisanori attached weight to the Ch\u016bzan Seifu. He identified Taromai as the eldest son of Sh\u014d Hashi and concluded that the King of Nanzan Taromai was a puppet of Ch\u016bzan. According to Wada, Sh\u014d Hashi overthrew the King of Nanzan in 1403 and ascended to the throne. He overthrew the King of Ch\u016bzan Bunei in 1405 and installed his father Sh\u014d Shish\u014d as King of Ch\u016bzan. He gave the title of King of Nanzan to his son Taromai in 1415 to become the Crown Prince of Ch\u016bzan. He succeeded his father Sh\u014d Shish\u014d as King of Ch\u016bzan in 1422. After the death of Taromai around 1429, Sh\u014d Hashi formally abolished Nanzan. The reason that Sh\u014d Hashi nominally maintained Nanzan was that he wished to keep profitable Chinese trade conducted under the name of the King of Nanzan. Ikuta Shigeru presented an even more radical interpretation of the Sanzan period. He dismissed Okinawa's later narratives as mere legends. He argued that the King of Nanzan was under the control of the King of Ch\u016bzan from the very beginning. Due to lack of sufficient evidence, he refrained from determining Hokuzan's relationship with Ch\u016bzan. He related these alleged polities to Ming China's haijin (sea ban) policy. Unlike the preceding Mongol Yuan Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty prohibited Chinese merchants from engaging in oversea trade. In order to maintain international trade that covers the vast area from Southeast Asia to Japan and Korea, they set up tribute-paying missions under the names of foreign kings. At their height, they used three dummy names. As Okinawa's importance in international trade decreased, the names of Hokuzan and Nanzan ceased to be used. == Tripartite hypothesis == Ethnologist \u014cbayashi Tary\u014d argued that the narrative of the Sanzan period recorded centuries later by Ry\u016bky\u016b reflected the tripartite ideology, which the French scholar Georges Dum\u00e9zil found in Proto- Indo-European mythology. He mapped Hokuzan to military, Ch\u016bzan to sovereignty and Nanzan to productivity. \u014cbayashi provided two types of evidence for the tripartite hypothesis. One is justifications for the unification by Sh\u014d Hashi. Sh\u014d Hashi took over King Bunei's Ch\u016bzan because the king had not exercised juridical powers properly. He then destroyed the King of Hokuzan Han'anchi, who had been known for extraordinary military prowess. The official history book Ky\u016by\u014d records two theories regarding the downfall of King Taromai's Nanzan. One is that he lost public support because of his extravagant lifestyle. Another story is that he lost support from the peasantry after he exchanged his domain's lifeblood spring for Sh\u014d Hashi's gold-painted folding screen. In other words, he lost his country because he relinquished the source of productivity. Another type of evidence is regalia. Hokuzan's sacred treasure was a Japanese sword named Chiyoganemaru. When Hokuzan was about to fall, King Han'anchi got angry at the sacred sword's failure to protect the domain and threw it into the water. Nanzan's regalia was a gold-painted folding screen. It is not uncertain what kind of treasures Ch\u016bzan had before Sh\u014d Hashi's takeover. \u014cbayashi claimed that a song in Omoro S\u014dshi could be interpreted as Sh\u014d Hashi's possession of a sacred drum when he was a local ruler of Sashiki. The Omoro S\u014dshi suggests that sacred drums were believed to give the mythical power to bring people under control. == References == Category:History of Okinawa Prefecture ",
