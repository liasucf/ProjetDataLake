He served as President of the Estates of Cura\u00e7ao between November and December 2012 and once again from 24 March 2017 and 11 May 2017. ==Career== In the 2000s Thod\u00e9 served as secretary-general of the Party Workers' Liberation Front 30 May (FOL). He later switched to Movement for the Future of Cura\u00e7ao. At the first meeting of the Estates of Cura\u00e7ao on 10 October 2010 Thod\u00e9 was elected Vice President. On 2 November 2012 Thod\u00e9 was elected President of the Estates. After a new government coalition did not include Thod\u00e9's MFK he resigned as President of the Estates on 6 December 2012. In January 2016 Thod\u00e9 was convicted of leaking confidential information from a meeting from the College of Financial Oversight. He subsequently shared this information on a radio show and in an MFK press conference. Thod\u00e9 was sentenced to a conditional fine of 1400 Netherlands Antillean guilder. An appeal verdict at the Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba in December 2016 resulted in the same sentence. He appealed at the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on 4 January 2017. In March 2019 the Attorney General at the Supreme Court stated that there was a legal ground to convict Thod\u00e9. In October 2019 Thod\u00e9 lost his appeal. For the 2016 elections Thod\u00e9 held the fifth position on the MFK list. As the MFK obtained four seats he did not enter the Estates. When Gilmar Pisas became Prime Minister in March 2017 Thod\u00e9 returned to the Estates on 24 March and once more became President. William Millerson took over the Presidency on 11 May 2017. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Estates of Cura\u00e7ao Category:Movement for the Future of Cura\u00e7ao politicians Category:Party Workers' Liberation Front 30 May politicians Category:Presidents of the Estates of Cura\u00e7ao ",
