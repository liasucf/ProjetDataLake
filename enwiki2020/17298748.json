Elkins served as the president of the University of Maryland from 1954 to 1970, and then was president of the 5 campus University of Maryland System from 1970-1978.

At the University of Maryland, Elkins emphasized rigorous academic standards. In 1957, he created the \"Academic Probation Plan,\" threatening 1,550 students--18 percent of the undergraduate enrollment--with expulsion because their grade point averages were lower than a C. University administration sent 14% of students home, but by 1964, 82% of freshmen came from the top half of their high school classes, and Phi Beta Kappa--which had turned down Maryland twice before--had established a chapter on campus. Elkins supported the establishment of a faculty government and managed a major expansion and improvement of the physical plant, including the construction of the McKeldin Library and the Computer Science Center.
