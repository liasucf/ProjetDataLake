It was initially scheduled to take place in Mary, Turkmenistan, however, it was moved to Istanbul, Turkey. The contest is the junior equivalent of the Turkvision Song Contest; similar to the Junior Eurovision Song Contest being the younger equivalent of the Eurovision Song Contest. Thirteen countries and regions competed. Eligible to participate are Turkic regions, which have either a large Turkic population or a widely spoken Turkic language. The final took place on the 15 December 2015. Contestants must be aged between 8 and 15 and must perform in a Turkic language. ==Origins== Bala Turkvision was an annual song contest. Based on the similar format of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, Bala Turkvision focused primarily on participating Turkic countries and regions. A juror from each nation awarded between 1 and 10 points for every entry, except their own. In the Grand Final the jury determined the winner. Unlike the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in which the winning country proceeds to host the following year's event, hosting of the Bala Turkvision Song Contest took place in the country or region that is also hosting the Turkish Capital of Culture. ==Location== It was announced on 7 June 2015, that the inaugural Bala Turkvision Song Contest will be held in Mary, Turkmenistan. However, it was later confirmed that the competition had been moved to Istanbul, Turkey. The final took place on 15 December 2015. ==Participating countries and regions== The following Turkic regions and ethnic groups competed in the inaugural contest that took place in December 2015. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
