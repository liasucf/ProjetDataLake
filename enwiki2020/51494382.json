Based on his wide range of job experience, Tomomatsu found a philosophy of site-oriented action, which presents the principle of development work as \u201cin the beginning there are problems, not a specialization.\u201d At Utsunomiya University he educated action- oriented approaches, in international development cooperation, such as development facilitation and development intelligence, and proposed global career education for developing globally active manpower.
