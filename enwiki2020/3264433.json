The town, the second largest in the southeastern part of Iceland, offers scenic views of Vatnaj\u00f6kull (the largest ice cap in Europe by volume). The community was formerly known as Hornafjar\u00f0arb\u00e6r between 1994 and 1998. ==Geography== H\u00f6fn harbour H\u00f6fn from above H\u00f6fn is located on a peninsula in the southeast of Iceland. The name H\u00f6fn means harbour and it is a fishing port surrounded on three sides by the sea, with beaches on a long shoreline to the southeast. Shoals and glacial rivers traverse this area with many shifting lagoons and sand reefs being formed. H\u00f6fn is surrounded by several small islands to the east of the town, the largest of which is Mikley, followed by Kr\u00f3kal\u00e1tur and Hellir. H\u00f6fn is one of very few harbours in the southern part of Iceland and it needs to be navigated with care due to the changing pattern of shoals. Dredging is an essential requirement to remove sand that has accumulated near the harbour so that ships can safely moor. The entrance channel to H\u00f6fn port has a minimum depth of . However, the depth at the entrance itself is . The harbour at H\u00f6fn is reported to freeze during periods of extremely cold weather. Eagle Airways operates domestic flights from H\u00f6fn airport and the town is a major centre for visitors to the Vatnaj\u00f6kull Glacier. H\u00f6fn lies at the end of Road 99, which leaves Iceland's National Road 1 several kilometres north of the town. A tunnel is located near the town, measuring 1,300 metres in length, which is named Almannaskar\u00f0sg\u00f6ng. It was opened in 2005. Nearby areas include Su\u00f0ursveit (the birthplace of \u00de\u00f3rbergur \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson), \u00d6r\u00e6fasveit, L\u00f3n, M\u00fdrar and Nes. In Nes there is a small village called Nesjahverfi.

Fishing involves both sea fishing and processing and packaging in the factories; one major fish processing factory, Skinney- \u00deinganes is one of the largest fish factories in the eastern part of Iceland, which employs a large number of people. The main production of these factories is bacaloa (saltfish) and processed lobster. Herring and capelin are also processed. Ten large and a number of smaller boats operate from H\u00f6fn. During the summer tourist season, trips are organised to the nearby Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier. The surrounding area has served as a filming location for feature films including the James Bond movies Die Another Day and A View to a Kill, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and Batman Begins. Recently a song in the 2015 Bollywood movie \"Dilwale\" has been shot in the surrounding areas.http://icelandreview.com/de/node/82549 H\u00f6fn offers a variety of services and stores including a supermarket, pharmacy, a bank, three hairdressers, two gas stations and a swimming pool.

It has served at least three purposes and has been moved around southeast Iceland. First it was a trade center in Pap\u00f3s and then it was a store in H\u00f6fn. Most recently it has been moved again and now it serves as an information center.Author unknown. Hornafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur Cultural Centre. Retrieved 28.2.2013 from Originally called \"Kramb\u00fa\u00f0in\", meaning \"The Mercantile Store\", in a short time it had managed to become one of the main trade centers for the people of southeast Iceland, as there were few other settlements in the area. Just about everything available in these parts of Iceland was sold here. Farmers were the main group of people making purchases, so naturally it sold mostly tools and such things that farmers needed on daily basis. In 1897 it was moved to the harbor of H\u00f6fn and stayed there for 80 years.Bj\u00f6rnsson, S, Bjarnason, B and Bj\u00f6rnsson, G. (1976). Bygg\u00f0arsaga Austur-Skaftafellss\u00fdslu.
