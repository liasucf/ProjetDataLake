    "text": "The Moravian Historical Society in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1857. It aims to preserve and present the art, history, and culture of the Moravians in America, and it is the third oldest historical society in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Society is housed in the 1740/1743 Whitefield House on the Ephrata Tract in downtown Nazareth. The Society is affiliated with the Moravian Archives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the repository for records of the Moravian Church in North America, Northern Province. The Society collects objects relating to Moravian history in North America, provides research assistance, publishes, and offers lectures, programs, events, and activities for all ages and levels of interest. == Site == The Society owns three acres of land in Nazareth, PA, called the Ephrata Tract. It was on this site that the First House of Nazareth once stood. It operates out of two buildings on the Tract: the 1740/1743 Whitefield House and the 1740 Gray Cottage. === Ephrata Tract === In 1740, a Moravian group from Savannah, Georgia was hired by landowner and British cleric George Whitefield to build a school for orphaned slaves. Whitefield wanted to build his school on a 5000-acre area he called Nazareth, which he had purchased from William Allen that same year. Tensions arising from theological disputes between Whitefield and the Moravians led the Moravians to purchase and begin to establish Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, leaving Whitefield's school building unfinished. When Whitefield later went bankrupt, the Moravians purchased the 5000 acres, which included the Gray Cottage, First House, and the bottom portion of the Whitefield House. This area became known as the Ephrata Tract. The town of Nazareth was laid out in 1771 several blocks to the west. The First House was demolished in 1864, but the Whitefield House and Gray Cottage still stand. The buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 1980. The marker for the Moravian Historical Society === Whitefield House === Construction on the Whitefield House started in 1740 and completed in 1743. It was originally used to house 32 married couples arriving from England. Through the years, the Whitefield House operated as a place of worship, girls\u2019 boarding school, nursery, the Moravian Theological Seminary, and apartments for furloughed missionaries. Today, the Whitefield House houses the Society's museum, administrative offices, and gift shop. The museum runs a series of permanent and changing exhibitions showcasing the culture of the Moravians and their contributions to American history. === Gray Cottage === The Gray Cottage was constructed in October 1740 by the Moravians as protection from the harsh winter weather ahead. It is an oak log structure, and was originally called the \u201cOld Block House\u201d from the German word Block, meaning \u201clog.\u201d From 1743-1745, the building was used as a boys\u2019 school. It has also been used as a girls\u2019 school, a home for widows, a nursery, and a private residence. It is the oldest Moravian building still standing in North America. === First House === The marker designating the First House of Nazareth Constructed in June 1740, the First House sheltered Moravians during the construction of the Whitefield House. It was approximately 30\u2019 wide by 20\u2019 deep, and stood two and one half stories tall. It was demolished in 1864, but the foundation was discovered by archaeologists in September 2014 in the area between the Whitefield House and the Gray Cottage. Several artifacts including redware pottery and a brass horse bell were also discovered. A small stone marker stands on this site. == Monuments == The Society has placed several markers at locations of American Moravian historical significance: * The First House of Nazareth marker: A small stone marker on the Ephrata Tract indicating the location of Nazareth's First House, which was demolished in 1864. * Meniolagomeka in Monroe County (near Kunkletown), PA: Dedicated on October 22, 1901, at the former site of the Delaware Native American town of Meniolagomeka. Several Moravian missionaries labored here from 1752-1755. * Wechquetank in Monroe County (near Gilbert), PA: Dedicated on May 31, 1907, at the former site of the Delaware village of Wechquetank, which means willow tree in the Delaware language. The site was a Moravian mission from 1750-1756 and 1760-1763. * The Rose Inn in Northampton County (Upper Nazareth), PA: Built in 1752 by the Moravians; it was used as housing for refugees from 1755-1756. It formally closed in 1772, and was demolished in 1858. A stone marker sits on the original site near a barn made partially from wood of the original inn. * Shekomeko in Dutchess County (near Pine Plains), NY: Dedicated to the Mahican Native American village of Shekomeko, the first Native Christian congregation in America. Moravian missionaries worked there from 1740-1746, until new legislation expelled them from the area. The original monument was dedicated at the site of missionary Gottlieb Buettner's grave at Shekomeko on October 5, 1859, and rededicated as its current, more accessible site on June 22, 1926. * Gnadenhuetten in Borough of Lehighton, Carbon County, PA: Dedicated to the mission at the village of Gnadenhuetten. The village was destroyed in a massacre during the French and Indian War on Nov. 24, 1755. * Dansbury Mission in Monroe County (Stroudsburg), PA: Dedicated on June 25, 1931, to the Moravian mission that began in 1747, and was destroyed during the French and Indian War in 1755. * Friedenshuetten in Bradford County (near Wyalusing), PA: Dedicated on June 15, 1871, at the former Native American mission village of Wyalusing, 1763-1772. * Gnadensee (Indian Lake) in Litchfield County (near Sharon), CT: Dedicated on October 6, 1859, at Wechquanach near Shekomeko overlooking the Gnadensee. Missionary David Bruce's body was carried over the Gnadensee to Wechquanach in 1749. == Collections == The Whitefield House Museum's collection contains over 10,000 Moravian objects, which are featured in permanent and changing exhibits. Highlights from the collections include: * 23 oil paintings by John Valentine Haidt (1700-1780), the first artist in Colonial America to portray chiefly religious topics, * A 1776 pipe organ made by David Tannenberg, the most important organ-builder of his time, * The Antes violin: the earliest-known violin made in the American Colonies, * A cocklestove made prior to 1775, * The 2014 Civil War history exhibit inside the Society's museumRare first editions of books written by John Amos Comenius, the \"Father of Modern Education.\" The museum also contains a large collection of Moravian mission artifacts from six continents, as well as various textiles, household goods, and Native American artifacts.
