In 1846, he created the Els\u0151 Magyar Fest\u00e9szeti Akad\u00e9mi\u00e1t (First Hungarian Academy of Painting) which, as the name suggests, was the first school in Hungary devoted exclusively to painting. It was a private school, but numbered Andr\u00e1s F\u00e1y, G\u00e1bor D\u00f6brentei and Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary among its patrons and supporters. The school also sold shares to the general public. K\u00e1roly Lotz, Mih\u00e1ly Zichy, Soma Orlai Petrich and Mih\u00e1ly Kov\u00e1cs were some of the school's best-known students. Shortly after founding the school, Marastoni was named an Honorary Citizen of Pest. In his later years, he became Hungary's first professional Daguerrotypist. In 1859, his health began to deteriorate rapidly and he had to give up teaching. He soon went blind, and died in a mental institution. The school was closed shortly thereafter. His son, , was also a well-known painter and lithographer in Vienna. ==References== == Further reading == * P\u00e9ter Kornelia, Marastoni Jakab, Vol.38 in the Hungarian Art History series from P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University (1936) * \u00daj magyar \u00e9letrajzi lexikon IV.
