R.W.R McDonald wrote the first draft of The Nancys while at Faber Academy, Melbourne under the tutelage of award winning authors Toni Jordan and Paddy O'Reilly.

In 2017, The Nancys was highly commended in Victorian Premier's Unpublished Manuscript Award, this lead him to signing with his literary agent, Grace Heifetz. The novel centres around an eleven year old school girl, Tippy Chan and her babysitting Uncle Pike and his boyfriend Devon, who together form a secret amateur detective club \"The Nancys\" to try and solve Tippy's teacher's murder in her small town over one summer. Craig Sisterson, reviewer and founder of the Ngaio Marsh Awards said of the book \"First-time novelist McDonald has opened his account with a real belter, a unique and enthralling tale.\" Vanda Symon review of The Nancys in Landfill Review stated \"It is a bold author who writes a crime fiction novel from the perspective of an eleven-year-old girl, but Rob McDonald has captured the essence and heart of his young narrator, and with it brought a view of her world that is illuminating, funny, bewildering, heart-breaking and determined.\" Auckland Libraries listed McDonald and The Nancys in their Top 10 New Voices as part of their 2019 Top 100 list. McDonald is currently working on his second novel in The Nancys trilogy. == Awards and nominations == \u2022 Victorian Premier's Unpublished Manuscript Award, 2017 Highly commended for The Nancys \u2022 Ngaio Marsh Award, 2020, Best Crime Novel, Finalist for The Nancys \u2022 Ngaio Marsh Award, 2020, Best First Novel, Finalist for The Nancys \u2022 Ned Kelly Awards, 2020, Best First Novel, Shortlisted for The Nancys == Bibliography == \u2022 The Nancys (2019) == References == == External links == * Category:People from Balclutha, New Zealand Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Writers from Melbourne Category:New Zealand crime fiction writers Category:21st-century New Zealand novelists Category:New Zealand expatriates in Australia ",
