    "text": "The UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS), informally known as UCLA Engineering, is the school of engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). It opened as the College of Engineering in 1945 and was renamed the School of Engineering in 1969.UCLA Engineering School Timeline Since its initial enrollment of 379 students, the school has grown to approximately 6,100 students. The school is ranked 16th among all engineering schools in the United States. The school offers 28 degree programs and is home to eight externally funded interdisciplinary research centers, including those in space exploration, wireless sensor systems, and nanotechnology. __TOC__ ==History== Engineering IV building The school was renamed for its alumnus and professor Henry Samueli, who received his B.S. (1975), M.S. (1976), and Ph.D (1980) in Electrical Engineering there. Samueli is co-founder, chairman, and chief technology officer of Broadcom Corporation and a philanthropist in the Orange County community. He and his wife Susan donated $30 million to the school in 1999. It was at UCLA that Dr. Henry Nicholas and Dr. Henry Samueli met and later formed Broadcom. The main building is Boelter Hall (Engineering II and III), named after Llewellyn M. K. Boelter, a Mechanical Engineering professor at UC Berkeley who became the first Dean of the school. He \"often took an active role in the lives of the school's students, and his approach to engineering impacted many of their careers,\" according to the school.Remembering Dean Boelter, UCLA Engineer, Fall 1999 He retired in 1965 and was succeeded by Chauncey Starr, a pioneer in nuclear power development. HSSEAS is housed in two other buildings: Engineering IV, and Engineering V, which houses the Department of Bioengineering and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Engineering I was demolished in August 2011, to be replaced by Engineering VI, which will house the Western Institute of Nanotechnology on Green Engineering and Metrology (WIN-GEM) in 2014. The ground breaking ceremony for Engineering VI building was held October 26, 2012 with Congressman Henry A. Waxman and Henry Samueli. On March 19, 2015, Engineering VI phase I was dedicated and phase II broke ground with the help of James L. Easton, class of '59 alumnus.Bill Kisliuk, UCLA Engineering Celebrates Opening of Engineering VI, UCLA Engineering, March 20, 2015 The school is credited as the birthplace of the Internet, where the first message was sent to a computer at Stanford University on October 29, 1969 by Professor Leonard Kleinrock and his research team at UCLA.1969 -- First On the 'Net On September 29, 2008, President George W. Bush presented the 2007 National Medal of Science to Kleinrock for \"his fundamental contributions to the mathematical theory of modern data networks, and for the functional specification of packet switching, which is the foundation of Internet technology. His mentoring of generations of students has led to the commercialization of technologies that have transformed the world.\" White House News Sept. 29, 2008 Room 3420 at Boelter Hall, where the first message was sent, has been converted into The Kleinrock Internet Heritage Site and Archive (renamed KIHC \u2013 The Kleinrock Internet History Center at UCLA).Beginning of the Internet commemorated in new UCLA museum, Southern California Public Radio, July 19, 2011 UCLA conferred its first Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering in 1947, its first Master of Science degree in 1948, and its first Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1950. Annual Engineering commencement ceremonies are held in June at Pauley Pavilion. ==Departments and Programs== HSSEAS has seven departments and one interdepartmental program, which are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).
