    "text": "Greg Quinn (born 1950) is an American farmer in Staatsburg, New York, who with the help of several state senators and assemblypersons overturned a 1911 New York state ban in 2003 on the commercial cultivation of blackcurrants, a berry fruit used in juice, jams, candy, yogurt, ice cream, and cereal that provides twice the antioxidant ORCA capacity per serving of blueberries, four times the vitamin C content of oranges, and twice the potassium content of bananas. With no supply and no market, his company, CurrantC, began to grow black currants on his , farm and Quinn sought to interest consumers and New York farmers in the fruit, which was then being supplied to the United States by Europe. CurrantC is the number one supplier of Currant products in the United States. In addition to farming and teaching at the New York Botanical Garden, Quinn has written eight children's books published by Scholastic Press, including the titles A Gift of a Tree, The Garden in Our Yard, 365 Meditations for Teachers, and books within the Natural Treasure series. He also has written for SKY magazine, Good Housekeeping, and Fine Gardening and has been \"The Garden and Nature Guy\" on WHUD and other Pamal Broadcasting radio stations, and FOX 5 television, WNYW out of New York City. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * * * Greg Quinn in the news * - Greg Quinn's Facebook page Category:1950 births Category:American activists Category:Farmers from New York (state) Category:Living people Category:People from Staatsburg, New York ",
