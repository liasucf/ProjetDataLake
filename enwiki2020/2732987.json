He also became a footnote to one of the most bizarre personnel transactions in baseball annals. On August 3, 1960, the Tigers and Cleveland Indians traded their managers, Jimmy Dykes for Joe Gordon. Hitchcock served as Detroit's interim skipper for one game while Gordon was en route from his Cleveland assignment, and the Tigers defeated the New York Yankees, 12\u20132, on August 3 at Yankee Stadium.Retrosheet In , Hitchcock was named the full-time manager of the Baltimore Orioles.

During his presidency, the league added new teams, expanded its playoffs, and introduced split-season play. Other improvements included stadium refurbishments and efforts to make the league more family-friendly. Attendance figures rose dramatically during his tenure, from 333,500 in 1971 to over 1.7 million in 1980. The Southern League championship trophy is named after Hitchcock, and in 1980 he was presented with the King of Baseball award given by Minor League Baseball. He stepped down from the presidency in 1980. ==College athletics== In addition to his baseball resume, Hitchcock also made a name for himself in college football and golf. As an All-Conference tailback, he led Auburn to its first bowl game (a 7-7 tie against Villanova on January 1, 1937). Later in life, he established the Billy Hitchcock Golf Tournament at his alma mater. In recognition of his contribution to the school, Auburn renamed its renovated baseball stadium \"Hitchcock Field\" in 2003. Also in that year, Baseball America named it the best college baseball facility in the country. ==Death== Hitchcock died in Opelika, Alabama at age 89.Hitchcock, former player, manager, dies at 89 ==References== ==External links== *Billy Hitchcock at SABR (Baseball BioProject) * : Category:1916 births Category:2006 deaths Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:American Presbyterians Category:Atlanta Braves coaches Category:Atlanta Braves managers Category:Auburn Tigers baseball players Category:Auburn Tigers football players Category:Baltimore Orioles managers Category:Baseball players from Alabama Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) managers Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Detroit Tigers coaches Category:Detroit Tigers managers Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Kansas City Blues (baseball) players Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Milwaukee Braves scouts Category:Minor league baseball executives Category:Montreal Expos scouts Category:People from Bullock County, Alabama Category:People from Opelika, Alabama Category:Philadelphia Athletics players Category:Players of American football from Alabama Category:St. Louis Browns players Category:Southern League (baseball) Category:United States Army Air Forces soldiers Category:Washington Senators (1901\u20131960) players ",
