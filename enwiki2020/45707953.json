At his brother\u2019s house, art lovers regularly met up to study the work of the great Dutch and Flemish masters.Pair of winter and summer landscapes sold at Sotheby\u2019s on 9 December 2009 in London, lot 5 It is not known when or where Carel Beschey died but it is assumed he died in Antwerp c. 1770. ==Work== Carel Beschey painted mainly landscapes usually with many figures and occasionally with a religious scene. He was one of a number of Antwerp artists from the second half of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century who painted landscapes in a style reminiscent of earlier Flemish landscape painting. In particular, the work of Jan Brueghel the Elder. These artists included, amongst others, Izaak van Oosten, Peeter Gijsels, Adriaen Frans Boudewyns, Pieter Bout, Joseph van Bredael and his brother Balthasar Beschey. What these artists had in common was that they liked to paint pleasant landscapes with peasant scenes in fresh colours, which exuded a bucolic sense of happiness. Most of their landscapes were populated with small figures in anecdotal poses set against a backdrop of a nice landscape or of some buildings.About Theobald Michau at Jean Moust The preferred palette was pronounced blue-green.Carel Beschey, Landscape with buildings, a market, wagons and figures at Hampel Fine Art Auctions Landscape with figures The landscapes of Carel Beschey are closely based on the work of Jan Brueghel the Elder. Carel Beschey had a preference for wide, rural landscapes in which the rich scenery with farmers and travellers clearly evokes the model of landscape painting of the 17th century.Carel Beschey (1710\u20131786), The Rest on the Flight into Egypt at Bonhams Beschey painted a few pairs of winter and summer landscapes. His winter landscapes display a greater level of independence from the Brueghel model. An example is A winter landscape with hunters and skaters on a frozen river running through a village (sold at Sotheby's on 9 December 2009 in London, lot 5). ==References== ==External links== * Category:1706 births Category:1770s deaths Category:People from Antwerp Category:Flemish history painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish art dealers Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:18th- century Flemish painters ",
