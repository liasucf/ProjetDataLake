    "text": "Chris Moraitis, who performed as M\u00e1ndu, was an Australian rock music vocalist. He released his debut solo album, To the Shores of His Heaven, in 1974. He joined Lobby Loyde's Southern Electric group and was recorded on two of their albums, Obsecration (May 1976) and Live with Dubs (live album, 1980). According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, M\u00e1ndu had \"a distinctive and emotional voice\" and his solo album, \"stands as a worthwhile period piece, a work graced with elegant songs, soaring arrangements and fine musicianship.\" However, in 1980 \"[he] disappeared from view, re-emerging briefly during the mid-1980s with a band called M\u00e1ndu B\u00e1ndu.\" == Biography == M\u00e1ndu (Chris Moraitis) arrived in Melbourne from Queensland in the early 1970s. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' He issued a concept album, To the Shores of His Heaven, in 1974 using studio musicians: Steve Cooney on mandolin and guitar, Phil Manning on guitar, Barry Sullivan on bass guitar, Peter Sullivan on keyboards and Gary Young on drums. It was recorded at Melbourne's Armstrong Studios and produced by Ern Rose for Image Records/Astor Records. Ian McFarlane, an Australian musicologist, felt that, \"the cosmic concept album... stands as a worthwhile period piece, a work graced with elegant songs, soaring arrangements and fine musicianship.\" M\u00e1ndu toured Australia with a backing band of Cooney, Peter Sullivan, Bob Bickerton on drums (ex-Rock Granite and the Profiles), Mike Clarke on bass guitar (ex-Skylight) and Greg Cook on guitar (ex-Cam-Pact, the Mixtures, Skylight). The album was retitled, We Ran Across the Sky, and reissued in 1980. A bonus track, \"Gimme Shelter\", a cover version of the Rolling Stone's single was added to a remastered and reissued version, To the Shores of His Heaven, in February 2008 via Aztec Music. M\u00e1ndu joined Australian rock guitarist, Lobby Loyde's group Southern Electric, and was recorded on their album, Obsecration (May 1976). He left for the United Kingdom and returned to Melbourne to record that group's live album, Live with Dubs (1980). McFarlane noticed that subsequently, \"[he] disappeared from view, re-emerging briefly during the mid-1980s with a band called M\u00e1ndu B\u00e1ndu.\" He observed that the artist, \"was something of an enigma and a sadly overlooked talent. He had a distinctive and emotional voice, but only issued one album that was received with bemused indifference.\" ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of albums, with Australian chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | AUS |- ! scope=\"row\" | To The Shores 0f His Heaven | * Released: 1974 * Format: LP * Label: Image (ILP743) | align=\"center\" | 42 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" !
