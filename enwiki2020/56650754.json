For example, the Warre Miyo are referred to Reer Miiyo in Somali as well found in Akisho oromo, but Warre Miyo in Ethiopia.

Also the Madahweyne Dir, Akisho clan is one of the largest Dir sub-clans within the borders of the Somali region of Ethiopia based on the Ethiopian population census.Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Central Statistical Agency Population of Ethiopia for All Regions At Wereda Level from 2014 p. 21 Somali region They also live in the Oromia region reaching further past the town of Metehara along with the Afar region. Many Akisho's live in the Afar region of Ethiopia. The Akisho live in Jijiga district where they make up a large part of the Kebri Beyah and Fafan Zone. The Dir-Madaxweyne Akisho, along with the Gurgura, Issa and Gadabuursi subclans of the Dir represent the most native and indigenous Somali tribes in Harar. == History == The city of Dire Dawa was originally called Dir Dhabe and used to be part of Adal Sultanate during the medieval times and was exclusively settled by Dir clan which is a major Somali tribe. The Akisho name is originally derived from \"Cayisho\" which means, in old Somali, the (Cayilsan) \"Fat One.\" The Gurre and Gurgurre both are very closely related to the Akisho, use a nickname and were referred to the Oromo and Somalis as the traders or Gurgure from the old Somali and Oromo word \"gorgortan\" which means one who sells and trades. According to the folklore historians of the Southern Suure Dir of the Mudug region, the Akisho and gurre and the Gurgure madahweyne Dir produced some of the most famous Somali folk heroes like the Somali queen Araweelo who was Warre Miyo. Also the Akisho and Gurgure clans were instrumental in spreading the Muslim faith in the hinterlands of Ethiopia. The Sheikh Abba Hussein in Southern Ethiopia is said to be of Dir, as well as Awbarkadleh and Awbuube who are two major saints of the Somalis. Currently Muhiyadiin Odowa is the Sultan of the Akisho. The information in contained in this Response was provided by Matt Bryden, a consultant and Somali specialist now working with the United Nations Institute for Research on Social Development (UNRISD) in Nairobi (16 June 1998). He stated that the Akisho \"are related to the Dir clan family, and live mainly between Jigjiga [in Ethiopia], Hargeysa and many regions in Ethiopia. In Somaliland, they have been awarded a seat in the constituent assembly. They face no threat of persecution in any of the areas in which they live.\" The Research Directorate was unable to corroborate the Akisho's participation in the constituent assembly nor whether they face \"persecution.\" According to the Ethiopian Review the Akisho may be more numerous in Ethiopia than they are in Somalia (30 Apr. 1996).
