As a film editor he collaborated with directors Marcel Carn\u00e9, Ren\u00e9 Clair, and G\u00e9za von Radv\u00e1nyi among others. His three films with Carn\u00e9 in the late 1930s \u2014 Port of Shadows, H\u00f4tel du Nord, and Le Jour Se L\u00e8ve \u2014 are widely admired examples of poetic realism. He also directed films from 1935 to 1950. Perhaps the best-known is Colonel Chabert (1943), which was a film adaptation of a famous novella by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac. Le H\u00e9naff retired from filmmaking in 1968. ==Selected filmography== ===Editor=== * The Shark (1930) * Sous les toits de Paris (Under the Roofs of Paris) (1930) * \u00c0 Nous la Libert\u00e9 (1931) * Bastille Day (1933) * Le Scandal (The Scandal) (1934) * Samson (1936) * Le Quai des brumes (Port of Shadows) (1938) * H\u00f4tel du Nord (1938) * Le Jour Se L\u00e8ve (1939) * Le Quai des brumes (Women Without Names) (1950) * L'\u00c9trange D\u00e9sir de monsieur Bard (Strange Desire of Mr. Bard) (1954) * Der Arzt von Stalingrad (The Doctor of Stalingrad) (1958) * Twelve Hours by the Clock (1959) ===Director=== * Fort Dolor\u00e8s (1939) * Colonel Chabert (1943) *St. Val's Mystery (1945) * The Husbands of Leontine (1947) ==References== ==External links== * Category:French film editors Category:French centenarians Category:1901 births Category:2005 deaths ",
