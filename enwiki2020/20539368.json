    "text": "The Whitney\u2013Farrington\u2013Cook House was a historic house in Waltham, Massachusetts. The -story wood-frame house was built c. 1858, and was a good example of Italianate styling. It had a three-bay facade, with a single-story porch across the facade which is supported by Tuscan columns. The main entry was flanked by sidelights and simple pilasters, and topped by an entablature. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It was demolished circa 2012. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Houses in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:Italianate architecture in Massachusetts Category:Houses completed in 1858 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Massachusetts ",
