He is originally from Mitcham, South London.Steve voted The X Factor winner BBC News ==Early and personal life== Brookstein was born in Dulwich, London, England, the son of Malle, a council worker, and Errol Brookstein, a lorry driver. His father is South African and his mother is of Estonian descent. He is a supporter of Crystal Palace F.C. In 1997, seven years before his breakthrough on The X Factor, Brookstein was a finalist on the ITV series The Big Big Talent Show, hosted by Jonathan Ross.Bushell on the box: ITV'S RECYCLED TALENT ==Career== ===2004\u20132005: The X Factor and Heart and Soul=== In early 2004, Brookstein auditioned for the first series of The X Factor, a talent series that aimed to discover new recording artists in the UK. His audition failed to impress two of the judges, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh, who thought he lacked the motivation and confidence to succeed but the third, Simon Cowell, asked Brookstein to return the following day and sing again. At the second audition, Brookstein managed to impress the other judges and was put through to the next stage of the competition. He went on to reach the live shows, where contestants are put to the public vote, as one of three contestants in the Over 25s category mentored by Cowell. He reached the grand final on 11 December 2004 alongside G4 and won, despite him mixing up words and lines in his winner's song and a controversial outburst against him from Osbourne. However, according to Osbourne's subsequent autobiography, he had gained the most votes in every single one of the live shows. For five years, he held the record for the greatest number of votes ever received in the final - 6 million, but this is now held by series 6 winner Joe McElderry, who received over 6.1 million votes. After winning The X Factor, Brookstein was immediately signed to the Sony BMG record label through which he released his first single, a cover of Phil Collins' 1984 power ballad \"Against All Odds\", on 20 December 2004. The song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number two and then climbed to number one on 2 January 2005, going one better than Collins' original and staying there for one week. In Ireland, the song peaked at number 11. The music video for the song was a montage of clips from his time on The X Factor, from his initial audition to his final performance after being declared the winner. Brookstein released his debut album Heart and Soul on 9 May 2005 through Sony BMG. Although Brookstein continued to perform tracks from the album on television shows such as CD:UK, a second single failed to materialise. In August 2005 it was announced that Sony BMG had dropped him from their line-up only eight months after his X Factor victory and despite the success of his debut single and album. Brookstein maintains that the decision to drop him reportedly came after he was offered a second album and to come back on the show, which he declined as it was to be another album of covers and he preferred a mix of old and new.Steve Brookstein: 'I turned down Simon Cowell's sloppy seconds' - The X Factor News - Reality TV - Digital Spy In August 2005, eight months after being dropped from his record label,Brookstein: X Factor is killing music | Showbiz.
