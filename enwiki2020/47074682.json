The multiple tracks do not add diverse perspectives but contribute towards common mess.\" Shaikh Ayaz of Rediff gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 saying that, \"Lack of imagination and an oddball cast lets down Rakesh Mehta's Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi\". Blessy Chettiar of DNA India gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 and said that, \"There\u2019s no reason to go pay and watch them on the big screen. Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi is best avoided.\" Martin D'Souza of Glamsham gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5 and said that, \"Casting has let the film down big time and that is very disappointing because this film had the potential to make an impact. \" Shaheen Parkar of Mid-Day gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 saying that, \"The story meanders around their trials and tribulations with Manu Rishi providing the light moments with the rest doing their bits in a script that has nothing much to offer.\" Rohit Vats of News18 said that, \"'Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi' is slow but that's not the prime concern. It doesn't convey anything which was expected from a film with four characters carrying four separate notions.\" The critic gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and concluded his review by saying that, \"'Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi' lacks a well thought out treatment which allows good actors to come up with wayward acting.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and said that, \"LIFE KI TOH LAG GAYI has a fascinating concept, but the writing plays the spoilsport\". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5 and said that, \"I went in expecting nothing, and I was rewarded by a film that surprised me despite some predictable patches, and kept me engaged.\" ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack of Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi consists of 9 songs composed by Vinay Jaiswal and Pardeep Kotwal, the lyrics of which have been written by Vinay Jaiswal. == References == == External links == Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:Indian films Category:Indian action comedy films ",
