    "text": "In chemistry, a reactivity series (or activity series) is an empirical, calculated, and structurally analytical progression of a series of metals, arranged by their \"reactivity\" from highest to lowest. It is used to summarize information about the reactions of metals with acids and water, single displacement reactions and the extraction of metals from their ores. ==Table== {| class = \"wikitable\" !

Magnesium, aluminium and zinc can react with water, but the reaction is usually very slow unless the metal samples are specially prepared to remove the surface layer of oxide which protects the rest of the metal. Copper and silver will react with nitric acid; but because nitric acid is an oxidizing acid, the oxidizing agent is not the H+ ion as in normal acids, but the NO3\u2212 ion. == Comparison with standard electrode potentials == The reactivity series is sometimes quoted in the strict reverse order of standard electrode potentials, when it is also known as the \"electrochemical series\": :Li > Cs > Rb > K > Ba > Sr > Na > Ca > Mg > Be > Al > H (in water) > Mn > Zn > Cr(+3) > Fe(+2) > Cd > Co > Ni > Sn > Pb > H (in acids) > Cu > Fe(+3) > Hg > Ag > Pd > Ir > Pt(+2) > Au The positions of lithium and sodium are changed on such a series; gold and platinum are in joint position and not gold leading, although this has little practical significance as both metals are highly unreactive. Standard electrode potentials offer a quantitative measure of the power of a reducing agent, rather than the qualitative considerations of other reactive series. However, they are only valid for standard conditions: in particular, they only apply to reactions in aqueous solution. Even with this proviso, the electrode potentials of lithium and sodium \u2013 and hence their positions in the electrochemical series \u2013 appear anomalous. The order of reactivity, as shown by the vigour of the reaction with water or the speed at which the metal surface tarnishes in air, appears to be :potassium > sodium > lithium > alkaline earth metals, the same as the reverse order of the (gas-phase) ionization energies. This is borne out by the extraction of metallic lithium by the electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride: lithium metal is formed at the cathode, not potassium. ==See also== * Reactivity (chemistry), which discusses the inconsistent way that the term 'reactivity' is used in chemistry. ==References== ==External links== * Science Line Chemistry Category:Inorganic chemistry ",
