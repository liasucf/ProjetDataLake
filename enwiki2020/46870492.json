Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.|| 566 U.S. __ || 2012 || 9-0 || Patent Eligibility || Medical Treatment || The patent claims say nothing significantly more than apply the law, i.e., apply the natural laws that they describe and that simple additional instruction, by itself, is insufficient to transform an otherwise unpatentable claim into a patentable one. || 35 U.S.C. 101|| Invalidated attempt to patent natural law. |- | Caraco v.

Myriad Genetics|| __ U.S. __ || 2013 ||9-0|| Patent Eligibility || Isolation of Genetic Materials || Myriad's claims are not saved by the fact that isolating DNA from the human genome severs the chemical bonds that bind gene molecules together. The claims are not expressed in terms of chemical composition nor do they rely on the chemical changes resulting from the isolation of a particular DNA section. Consequently Myriad's patent on BRCA gene\u2014on the BRCA gene, are invalid. But because cDNA is not naturally occurring but is instead the product of human ingenuity, we conclude that cDNA is distinguishable from not- patentable products of nature. ||35 U.S.C. 101|| Invalidated patents on naturally occurring DNA segments, but not on cDNA. |- | FTC v. Actavis, Inc.|| __ U.S. __ || 2013 || || || || |||| Pay-for-delay is subject to antitrust analysis |- | Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International|| __ U.S. __ || 2014 || 9-0 || Patent Eligibility || Business Transaction and Hedging || Under Section 101 precedence and instruction to apply an abstract idea using a generic computer is not enough to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. Petitioner's system and media claims are patent-ineligible, too, because they add nothing of substance to the underlying idea. ||35 USC 101|| Invalidated patent based on abstract idea. |- | Medtronic v. Boston Scientific|| __ U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 843 || 2014 || || || || ||Declaratory Judgment Act|| Burden of persuasion on infringement in declaratory judgment cases |- | Octane Fitness v. Icon Health & Fitness|| 572 U.S. __ || 2014 ||9-0||Damages||Attorney Fees||An \"exceptional\" case is simply one that stands out from others because of its frivolous nature relating to the legal arguments or merits of the claim. District courts may determine exceptionalness by considering the totality of the circumstances on a case-by- case basis. The Court rejected the appellate court's \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard that successful patent litigants would have to establish in order to receive fees. Instead, the Court held that a simple discretionary inquiry would serve to determine whether granting attorney fees is appropriate.||35 U.S.C. 285||The lower appellate court construed the attorney fees statute in a manner that was unduly rigid. Restricting the grant of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in all but two exceptions would render the statute meaningless and would contradict patent litigation norms. The appellate court's interpretation of the statute would also impermissibly encumber the district court's discretionary power to award such fees. |- | Highmark v. Allcare|| __ U.S. __ || 2014 || || || || |||| Fee- shifting. |- | Limelight Networks v. Akamai Technologies|| 572 U.S. __ || 2014 ||9-0||Patent Infringement||Induced Infringement||A defendant cannot be liable for inducing infringement of a patent unless some party directly infringes the patentee's legal rights. Direct infringement of a method patent in turn can only occur where all steps of the method are performed because the patentee has a legally protected interest only in the claim's set of steps as a whole. A method patent steps have not all been performed as claims by the patent unless they are all attributable to the same party.||35 U.S.C. \u00a7271(a) and (b)|| Induced Infringement liability requires direct infringement. The en banc federal circuit court of appeal held that even assuming that Limelight did not directly infringe the patent, the evidence could nevertheless support a finding of inducement of infringement because the defendant who performs some steps of the patent and encourages others to perform the remaining steps may be liable for inducement even if all the steps are not attributable to the defendant. SCOTUS reverses this position. |- | Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc.|| 572 U.S. __ || 2014 ||9-0||Patentability Requirement||Claim Definiteness||Determining whether a patent claim is sufficiently definite must be done by evaluating the patent with the perspective of an individual learned in the relevant field, a standard that accepts a certain amount of ambiguity in the patent claim. However, because patents serve a public service function, patent claims must be definite enough to appraise the public at large as to what has or has not been patented yet. In attempting to balance these interests, the Court held that a patent is sufficiently definite when the patent taken as a whole, which includes the patent application, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's response, and any amendments made by the applicant, informs those learned in the relevant field of the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty. || 35 U.S.C. \u00a7112|| SCOTUS rejected the Court of Appeals' indefiniteness test of whether a patent claim is \"amenable to construction of insolubly ambiguous\" because such standard is insufficiently exacting. The asserted test is that if its claims read in light of the patent's specification and prosecution history failed to inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty, then a patent is invalid for indefiniteness. A definite claim takes into account the inherent limitations of languages and is meant to be understood by a PHOSITA. |- | Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc.|| 574 U.S. __ || 2015 ||7-2||Standard of Review|| Claim Construction || A federal appellate court could only overturn a district court's finding of fact if those findings were determined to be \"clearly erroneous.\" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) established this standard without any exceptions, and there was no reason to create one in this case. Because the construction of a patent claim is essentially a factual determination, it should be governed by this well-established standard. Therefore, while an appellate court may still review a lower court's construction of a claim de novo, to overturn the lower court's ruling, the appellate court must find that the lower court has made a clear error with respect to the findings of fact. ||Common Law|| Claim interpretation in patent, standard of review by the Federal Circuit. |- | Commil v. Cisco|| 575 U.S. __ || 2015 || 6-2 || Defense to Indirect Infringement || Standard of Induced Infringement || A defendant's good-faith belief that a patent is invalid is not a defense to a claim of induced infringement. ||Case Law || After a trial court awarded damages to Commil, Cisco appealed and argued that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that the standard for inducement was negligence and precluded the submission of evidence of Cisco's good-faith belief that Commil's patent was invalid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and held that the standard for induced infringement is actual knowledge or willful blindness, and therefore that a good-faith belief of patent invalidity was a defense to claims of induced infringement. SCOTUS reversed. |- | Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC|| 576 U.S. __, 135 S. Ct. 2401 || 2015 || 6-3 || Defense Based on Patent Misuse || Royalty Payments Beyond Patent Term || The precedent established in Brulotte v. Thys Co.\u2014that a patentee cannot receive royalty payments after the patent has expired\u2014should be upheld because there was no sufficient reason to overturn it. ||Case Law || [Patent misuse] doctrine is governed by patent policy, not antitrust policy; not necessary to show anticompetive impact in misuse case |- | Halo Electronics v. Pulse Electronics Inc.|| 579 U.S. __, || 2016 || 9-0 || Damages || Willful Infringement Determination || The plain language of Section 284 simply stated that courts \"may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed.\" There is no language that creates the kind of test (referring to the two-part test in In re Seagate.) that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit applied and precedent had established that the word \"may\" connotes judicial discretion. Enhanced damages serve as a sanction for egregious infringement behavior (e.g., willful, wanton, malicious, bad-faith, deliberate, consciously wrongful, flagrant, or acting like a pirate). ||35 U.S.C. \u00a7284 || The Seagate two-part test that required both objective and subjective bases is overruled. This case reviewed both Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc. and Stryker Corp. v. Zimmer, Inc., both of which used the Seagate two-part test to determine willful infringement as the basis for deciding enhanced damages per Section 284. SCOTUS held the test overly rigid and could insulate some of worst patent infringers from liability for enhanced damages. Courts should take into account all related factors in applying Section 284. |- | Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. || citation ||2016||8-0||Damages||Design Patent Damages||For the purpose of calculating damages in a patent infringement action, the infringing \"article of manufacture\" may be defined as either an end product sold to a consumer or as a component of that product. ||35 U.S.C. \u00a7289||The relevant text of the Patent Act encompasses both an end product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product. The fact that a component may be incorporated into the larger end product does not place it outside the category of an \"article of manufacture.\" Therefore, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit erred in interpreting that phrase too narrowly to only refer to the end product. Under the proper reading of the phrase, an infringer will sometimes be liable for the total profit from the component of the end product, but the Court declined to determine whether that is the case. |- | Peter v. NantKwest, Inc. || 589 U.S. ||2019||9-0||Damages||Attorney fees||USPTO cannot recover the salaries of its legal personnel under section 145 of the Patent Act.||35 U.S.C \u00a7 145||Patent applicants who are unhappy with the final decision of the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board have two options to appeal: they can appeal to the Federal Circuit (which conducts a limited review of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's decision) or sue the USPTO Director in the Eastern District of Virginia (which can consider new evidence not presented to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board). Because the second option is more expensive, litigants who choose it must pay all of the government's expenses regardless of whether they win or lose. The Supreme Court held that \"all expenses\" did not include the government's attorney fees. |- |} ==See also== * List of United States Supreme Court copyright case law * List of United States Supreme Court trademark case law == References == * Lisa Larrimore Ouellette, \"Supreme Court Patent Cases\", Written Description * Donald S.
