The focus of the journal is on research that provides novel insights into the genome biology of all organisms, including advances in genomic medicine. This scope includes genome structure and function, comparative genomics, molecular evolution, genome-scale quantitative and population genetics, proteomics, epigenomics, and systems biology. The journal also features interesting gene discoveries and reports of cutting-edge computational biology and high-throughput biology methodologies. New data in these areas are published as research papers, or methods and resource reports that provide novel information on technologies or tools that will be of interest to a broad readership. The journal was established in 1991 as PCR Methods and Applications and obtained its current title in 1995. Disregarding review journals, Genome Research ranks 2nd in the category 'Genetics and Genomics' after Nature Genetics. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2019 impact factor of 11.093. == References == == External links == * Category:Genetics journals Category:Delayed open access journals Category:Publications established in 1991 Category:Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press academic journals Category:Monthly journals Category:English- language journals Category:1991 establishments in New York (state) Category:Genomics journals ",
