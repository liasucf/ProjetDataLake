The Nuclear Physics Institute in Krakow on 19 November 1990 received the first IP address in Poland (192.86.14.0) assigned to it by United States Department of Defense. On November 20, 1990 CERN was sent the first e-mail to Poland and received it by this institute using the microVax II computer. ==Pricing== According to an OECD report, in September 2012 the price of Internet access in Poland ranged from $0.45 to US$127.12 PPP per megabit per second of advertised speed. This places Poland in the middle of the pack on the low end (18th lowest out of 34 countries) and at the top on the high end (second highest behind New Zealand at $130.20). This compares with ranges of $0.40 to $23.25 for Germany, $0.40 to $12.35 for the Czech Republic, and $0.53 to $41.70 for the U.S.\"Broadband subscription price ranges per megabit per second of advertised speed, with line charges, September 2012, USD PPP\", spreadsheet, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 9 July 2013. Retrieved 22 February 2014. According to Eurostat, OECD and others, Internet access in Poland is among the most expensive in Europe. This is mostly caused by the lack of competitiveness and lack of know-how. New operators like Dialog and GTS Energis are making their own provider lines and offer more attractive and cheaper service. In February 2011, the Polish Office of Electronic Communication issued an order forcing the TPSA to rent 51% of their ADSL lines to other ISPs at 60% discount of their market pricing. As the result the prices are non-competitive, other ISP charge as TPSA making a guaranteed 40% profit, while TPSA has no incentive to lower its consumer prices, because it would result in lowering of wholesale prices as well. ==ADSL== The most popular ADSL services for home users in Poland are Neostrada provided by TPSA and Net24 provided by Netia. Both provide download speeds in the range of 10 to 80 Mbit/s and upload speeds of 1 Mbit/s or more. Business users as well as some home users use Internet DSL TP also offered by TPSA. ===Neostrada=== ADSL and VDSL service is offered by Neostrada. ===Internet DSL TP=== There is another ADSL option available, targeted mainly at business clients, called Internet DSL TP. The link availability is guaranteed plus offers static IP address(es) and a modem with Ethernet interface. ===Net24=== ADSL service called Net24, provided by TP's main competitor Netia. The service can be installed on ISDN lines. Netia also offers ADSL (BiznesNet24) and SDSL (SuperNet24) subscriptions for business customers, which offer static IP address and higher speeds. ===Multimo=== ADSL service called Multimo, provided by GTS Energis for TP customers via Bit Stream Access. ===DialNET DSL=== ADSL service called DialNET DSL, provided by Dialog now bought by Netia. ==Cable== Cable providers such as Multimedia, UPC , Vectra and ASTER offer triple play services. ===VECTRA=== Vectra after the purchase Multimedia is the largest cable network in Poland. (reach 4.4 million household) ===INEA=== Cable providers from Greatpoland . Offers 10Gbit/s for anyone in their networks via fibre . ===UPC=== UPC has upgraded its \"Fiber Power\" internet service to higher speeds, offering internet with download speeds from 10 Mbit/s up to 1 Gbit/s . (reach 1.5 million household) ===ASTER=== ASTER used to provide triple play to many cities in Poland, especially Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w with speeds ranging from 1 Mbit/s to 120 Mbit/s. On January 2, 2012, Aster merged with UPC. As a result, every service was bumped into the higher tier and the daytime half speed throttling has been removed. ===HETAN=== HETAN provides stationary Internet via Satellite to whole Poland for private and business customers with speeds ranging from 10 Mbit/s to 20 Mbit/s in download and from 2 Mbit/s to 6 Mbit/s in upload. HETAN launched its services in August 2011, and is since then market leader in providing internet via KA-satellite services to private households and SME's in Poland.

Operations focus on Lower Silesia and Masovia regions, where telecommunications services are offered to both retail and business clients. KORBANK is also founder of the first in Europe IPTV Platform based on Unicast Protocol - AVIOS.AVIOS, KORBANK. ==Internet censorship and surveillance== The government does slightly restrict access to the Internet by using a black registry of internet sites, the PiS party deems un lawful, but there are no credible reports that it monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority. The constitution guarantees freedom of expression and forbids censorship. Libel remains a criminal offense, but possible penalties were reduced in 2009.\"Poland\", Freedom in the World 2013, Freedom House. Retrieved 22 February 2014.\"Poland\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 2 April 2013. Retrieved 22 February 2014. The law no longer prohibits most arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence,but there were little evidence of these occurring. ; and the government does not always respect these prohibitions in practice. The law allows electronic surveillance for crime prevention and investigation. There is neither independent judicial review of surveillance activities nor any control over the use of information obtained by monitoring private communications. A number of government agencies have access to wiretap information. ===During Civic Platform government=== In early 2011, Internet censorship legislation that included the creation of a registry of blocked web sites was abandoned by the Polish Government, following protests and petitions opposing the proposal.\"Security Question 2 in Country Report: Poland\" , BSA Global Cloud Computing Scorecard, Business Software Alliance, 22 February 2012\"Government stopped from preparing \u2018illegal\u2019 anti-internet piracy legislation\", Polskie Radio, 2 March 2012\"Polish Government Feels Urge to Regulate Internet\", Marcin Sobczyk, Wall Street Journal, 16 March 2011 In 2011 the Office for Electronic Communications reported that law enforcement agencies requested access to telecommunications data (including call logs, telephone location, and names registered to specific numbers) 1.8 million times, an increase of 500,000 over the number of requests in 2010. In January 2012, thousands protested Prime Minister Tusk's signing of the Anti- Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) establishing international standards for enforcing intellectual property rights, accusing it of facilitating Internet censorship. And in February Tusk suspended ACTA's ratification because his government had made insufficient consultations before signing the agreement to ensure it was entirely safe for Polish citizens. In September 2012, the creator of the website Antykomor.pl that satirized President Komorowski was sentenced to 15 months of restricted liberty and 600 hours of community service for defaming the president. ==See also== * CERT Polska, Computer Emergency Response Team for Poland. * Media of Poland * Telecommunications in Poland == References == ==External links== ",
