    "text": "Super Why! (stylized as Super WHY!) is an American-Canadian children's computer animated educational show developed by Angela Santomero and Samantha Freeman Alpert. The series is produced by New York City-based Out of the Blue Enterprises and Toronto-based DHX Media through its Decode Entertainment division. The show debuted on September 3, 2007 on most PBS member stations and went on hiatus in October 2012 for 34 months. The series resumed again on August 17, 2015 to May 12, 2016. ==Plot== The show is set in Storybrook Village, where the title character, Whyatt Beanstalk, lives with his friends Pig, Red, and Princess Pea. In each of the episodes, one of the main characters has a \"super big problem\". The main characters then discuss their problem at the Book Club, then agreeing to look in a book to solve the problem. The goal of the Super Readers is to follow the storyline of the book to solve the problem. As they progress through the events of the story, they encounter obstacles, which can be solved by applying their literacy skills to change the story. As they overcome these obstacles, they are rewarded with red glittery \"Super Letters\" that form the solution to the \"super big problem.\" At the conclusion of the adventure, the Super Readers fly back to the Book Club. The Super Letters are put onto the giant computer screen and are spelled out to show the \"Super Story Answer.\" Then one of the Super Readers gives the reason why that particular word or phrase serves as the solution to the Super Big Problem. Once the solution is reached, the Super Readers sing a song to end the episode. ==Episodes== ==Characters== * Whyatt Beanstalk (voiced by: Nicholas Castel Vanderburgh (season 1), Nicholas Kaegi (season 2), Johnny Orlando (season 3)) \u2013 The host of the series and the leader of the group of characters who become the \"Super Readers\", Whyatt is an olive-skinned, blue- eyed, brown-haired boy who wears a dark blue polo shirt with green stripes and khaki pants.
