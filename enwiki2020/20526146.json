    "text": "Amanullin is a cyclic peptide. It is an amatoxin, all of which are found in several members of the mushroom genus Amanita. The oral of amanullin is approximately 20 mg/kg in mice; however, it is non-toxic in humans. ==Toxicology== Like other amatoxins, amanullin is an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Amanullin has a species dependent and specific attraction to the enzyme RNA polymerase II. Upon ingestion, it binds to the RNA polymerase II enzyme, effectively causing cytolysis of hepatocytes (liver cells). ==See also== *Mushroom poisoning ==References== ==External links== *Amatoxins REVISED *Poisonous Mushrooms (German) Category:Peptides Category:Amatoxins Category:Hepatotoxins ",
