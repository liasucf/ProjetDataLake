Ten national teams affiliated with the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) took part in the competition. The event was hosted by Switzerland and held in Geneva in May, 1935. The 2012 Latvian film Dream Team 1935 is based on the events of the tournament. It tells the story of the Latvian national basketball team, the winners of the tournament. ==Preliminary round== Before the tournament began, a qualification game was played between Spain and Portugal. The game was held in Madrid, Spain and refereed by Spanish coach Mariano Manent.
