    "text": "Oblique Apollo 16 image, facing north Nagaoka is a lunar impact crater that lies to the southeast of the Mare Moscoviense, on the far side of the Moon. To the east of Nagaoka is the somewhat larger Konstantinov. This is a moderately eroded crater formation, with the satellite crater Nagaoka W overlapping the northwestern rim. The remainder of the rim remains well-defined, although it is overlain by several tiny craterlets. The inner wall has slumped in places, forming terrace-like shelves. A few small craterlets lie within the crater interior. ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Nagaoka. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Nagaoka !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|U |align=\"center\"|19.9\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|151.4\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|30 km |- |align=\"center\"|W |align=\"center\"|20.0\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|153.0\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|29 km |} ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
