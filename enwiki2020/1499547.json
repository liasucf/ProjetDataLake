It participates in port projects across Asia, Europe and the Americas with flagship operations in PSA Singapore and PSA Antwerp. Its employees in Singapore are organised under the Singapore Port Workers' Union (SPWU) and the Port Officers' Union (POU). ==History== Under the 1912 Straits Settlements Port Ordinance, the Singapore Harbour Board was formed on 1 July 1913.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/f829dfda-99e5-4e21-b00e-b6d38f78e11d On 1 April 1964, the Port of Singapore Authority came into being under the 1963 Port of Singapore Authority Ordinance to replace the Singapore Harbour Board and several organisations that have been operating in the port.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/a7193804-3862-4f99-8b3b-46c867073a95 A parliamentary bill was passed on 25 August 1997 to turn the Port of Singapore Authority, a state organisation into an independent commercial company. PSA Corporation Limited (simplified Chinese: \u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6e2f\u52a1\u96c6\u56e2) was thus corporatised on 1 October 1997. The company kept the initials \u201cPSA\u201d as its brand name but it is no longer an acronym. The regulatory functions of the former authority were transferred to Singapore's new maritime regulator, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). In order to focus on its core port business, PSA Corporation set up The HarbourFront Limited (present day Mapletree) on 7 December 2000 to spearhead development of its properties. Following a restructuring exercise in December 2003, PSA International Pte Ltd (simplified Chinese: PSA\u56fd\u9645\u6e2f\u52a1\u96c6\u56e2) became the holding company for the PSA Group of companies with PSA Singapore as one of its flagship terminals.
