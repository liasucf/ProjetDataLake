    "text": "was a Japanese inventor and industrialist. He was born in Kosai, Shizuoka. The son of a farmer and sought-after carpenter, he started the Toyoda family companies. His son, Kiichiro Toyoda, would later establish Japan's largest automaker, Toyota. Toyoda is referred to as the \"King of Japanese Inventors\". Toyota Century introduced in 1967 and the name was derived from the 100th birthday of Sakichi Toyoda. ==Toyoda Automatic Loom Works== Toyoda Automatic Loom Works was the engineering manufacturing company established by Sakichi Toyoda in 1926.https://www.toyota- industries.com/company/history/toyoda_sakichi/ It earned him the moniker of father of the Japanese industrial revolution. He is also the founder of Toyota Industries Co., Ltd. Toyoda invented and innovated numerous textile-focused weaving devices, introducing innovative fueling systems used to power his Toyoda-branded machines. His most famous invention was the automatic power loom in which he implemented the principle of Jidoka (autonomous automation). The principle of Jidoka, which means that the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System. Toyoda developed the concept of 5 Whys: When a problem occurs, ask \"why\" five times to try to find the source of the problem, then put into place something to prevent the problem from recurring. This concept is used today as part of applying lean methodologies to solve problems, improve quality, and reduce costs. ==Early life and education== Sakichi Toyoda was born on February 14, 1867, in Yamaguchi, T\u014dt\u014dmi Province (present-day Kosai, Shizuoka), to Ikichi and Ei Toyoda. Ikichi was a carpenter and a farmer, and he taught carpentry to his son. Sakichi's boyhood would coincide with the end of the shogunate era, replaced by the Meiji and its reformist policies. Sakichi was an avid reader in his youth, and he organized a youth study group for teens. Inspired by a trip to Ueno to visit the Third National Machinery Exposition, he later revolutionized the textile industry, powered by steam, oil, and electricity. ===Family tree=== Ikichi --- Ei | == References == == External links == * * Biography of Sakichi Toyoda Category:1867 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Japanese Buddhists Category:Japanese founders of automobile manufacturers Category:Japanese inventors Category:People from Shizuoka Prefecture Category:People of Meiji-period Japan Sakichi Category:Toyota people ",
