    "text": "Marie Magdalene Elisabeth Hassenpflug (27 December 178821 November 1856) was a German author whose versions of various folk tales were an important source for the collection of tales by the Brothers Grimm. She is best known for her versions of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" (Rotk\u00e4ppchen), \"Sleeping Beauty\" (Dornr\u00f6schen), and \"Snow White\" (Schneewittchen). == Life == Marie Magdalene Elisabeth Hassenpflug was born in the Ortsteil Altenha\u00dflau of Linsengericht district in Landgrafschaft Hessen-Darmstadt, Imperial State of Holy Roman Empire on 27 December 1788. Her father Johannes Hassenpflug (1755\u20131834) had been married since 1788 to Marie Magdalena Dresen (1767\u20131840), who came from a Huguenot family living in Hanau. On 14 October 1789, the family moved into a house called Haus Lossow at the marketplace's corner of Lindenstra\u00dfe in Neustadt, when her father was appointed the Schulthei\u00df of Neustadt-Hanau. She grew up in that house, where the family lived until 1799. She had a brother, Hans Ludwig Alexander, as well as two sisters, Jeanette and Amalie. She was sickly when young, and one scholar, Heinz R\u00f6lleke, surmises that frequent bouts of being bedridden may have made her more receptive to fairy tales. Through another family, the Engelhards, she became friends with the Grimm family. Her brother Ludwig married the sister Lotte of the Brothers Grimm. On 15 April 1799, the Hassenpflug family moved to Kassel, where her father transferred to the post of advocatus fisci (financial supervisor) of the Landgrafschaft Hessen-Kassel. On 21 August 1814, Marie Hassenpflug married Friedrich von Dalwigk zu Schauenburg, who was stationed in Hanau as a captain of the Kurprinz regiment. They lived on her husband's estate in Hoof (today part of Schauenburg) and in Hanau, where their son, Ludwig Alexander, was born on 24 January 1817. From 1819 to 1824, she served as a court lady to Herzogin Marie Friederike von Anhalt-Bernburg, a daughter of the Landgraf and later Kurf\u00fcrst Wilhelm IX/I of Hesse-Kassel. When her husband was the chamberlain of the duchess, they lived in the Hanau City Palace. She died in Kassel on 21 November 1856. == Literary significance == Hassenpflug wrote a series of fairy tales that the Grimm brothers adapted for their children's and household fairy tales (Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen, KHM): Little Brother and Sister (KHM 11), Little Red Riding Hood (KHM 26), The Girl Without Hands (KHM 31), The Robber Groom (KHM 40), Daumerling's Wanderings (KHM 45), Sleeping Beauty (KHM 50), The Water Mermaid (KHM 79), The Golden Key (KHM 200), Phoenix Bird (KHM 75a), The Blacksmith and the Devil (KHM 81a), Der Froschprinz (KHM 99a), the text fragment with the louse, and possibly Snow White (KHM 53). The identification of Herman Grimm's \"Old Marie\" with the much younger Marie Hassenpflug, which Heinz R\u00f6lleke made in a 1991 essay, also explains the sometimes verbatim correspondence with similar fairy tales by Charles Perrault: her mother was a Huguenot from the Dauphin\u00e9, and thus the family was well acquainted with French fairy tales (R\u00f6lleke noted elsewhere that the family spoke French at the dinner table until the late 1880s), which Marie, as well as her sisters Jeannette and Amalia, then told to the Grimms.
