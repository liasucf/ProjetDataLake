    "text": "AFC Turris-Oltul Turnu M\u0103gurele, commonly known as Turris Turnu M\u0103gurele, or simply Turris, is a Romanian professional football club based in Turnu M\u0103gurele, Teleorman County. The team was founded as Voin\u021ba Saelele in 1965 and was originally based in Saelele, Teleorman County. The club played only at amateur level, Liga IV and Liga V, until 2017 when it won Liga IV \u2013 Teleorman County and the promotion play-off against CS Strehaia ensuring its first Liga III presence. In the summer of the same year the club was moved from Saelele to Turnu M\u0103gurele and changed its name in Voin\u021ba Turnu M\u0103gurele, then in the summer of 2018 in Turris-Oltul Turnu M\u0103gurele. ==History== AFC Turris-Oltul Turnu M\u0103gurele was founded in 1965 as Voin\u021ba Saelele and played for almost all its history at county level, Liga IV and Liga V. Voin\u021ba won for the first time Divizia D at the end of the 2003\u201304 season, but withdrew from the third tier before the start of the new campaign, selling its place to Petrolul Videle. At the end of 2016\u201317 Liga IV season, the team was crowned the champion of Teleorman County and went to the promotion play-off match where they defeated Mehedin\u021bi County champions, CS Strehaia, 12\u20132 on aggregate and promoted to Liga III for the first time in the history of the club. In the summer of 2017 Voin\u021ba changed its ownership and moved its headquarters from Saelele to Turnu M\u0103gurele, also changing its name from Voin\u021ba Saelele to Voin\u021ba Turnu M\u0103gurele. After a strong campaign of transfers and rebranding, Voin\u021ba has set as its goal a promotion to Liga II, but finally was ranked only 3rd, after Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti and FCM Alexandria. In the summer of 2018 the club moved also its home ground to Turnu M\u0103gurele and was renamed again, this time as Turris-Oltul Turnu M\u0103gurele, a name much closer to the football past of the city, this being actually the first name used by the old football club, Dun\u0103rea Turris Turnu M\u0103gurele. Turris-Oltul is the third football team in the history of Turnu M\u0103gurele, after Dun\u0103rea Turris and Sporting. At the end of the 2018\u201319 season, Turris-Oltul Turnu M\u0103gurele promoted to Liga II for the first time in its history, after winning the third series of the Liga III, being ranked ahead teams such as FC U Craiova, CSM Alexandria or SR Bra\u0219ov. ==Grounds== ===Stadionul Comunal=== Between 1965 and 2018, when the club was known as Voin\u021ba Saelele or Voin\u021ba Turnu M\u0103gurele, played its home matches on Comunal Stadium, from Saelele, Teleorman County with a capacity of 1,000. ===Stadionul Municipal=== From 2018 Turris-Oltul plays its home matches on Municipal Stadium, with a capacity of 2,000 people.
