In 2000, Chisholm and Jason \"J\" Brown had an on-off relationship. In February 2009, Chisholm gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Scarlet. In an interview with the BBC, Chisholm admitted that the arrival of her child proved to be a turning point in her life, \"Being a mum was so liberating because for the first time in my adult life, it wasn't all about me. It made me not only realise I had a huge responsibility to her but I have a huge responsibility to myself. In being her teacher, I had to treat myself better.\" Chisholm has a country home in Catbrook, Monmouthshire, Wales. She is a supporter of Liverpool Football Club and an amateur triathlete, having completed the London Triathlon twice. Chisholm is the half-sister of racing driver Paul O'Neill. ==Philanthropy== In 2000, all proceeds from sales of her \"If That Were Me\" single went towards the Kandu Arts charity.

She stated: \"I think she's inspired me a lot musically, and maybe [in] just the way I present myself.

Q Magazine ===Cultural impact and legacy=== As a Spice Girls member Chisholm was called \"Sporty Spice\" because she usually wore a tracksuit paired with athletic shoes, wore her long dark hair in a high ponytail, and sported a tough girl attitude as well as tattoos on both of her arms. She also possessed true athletic abilities, including being able to perform back handsprings. In this period, the phrase \"girl power\" put a name to a social phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. The term \"Cool Britannia\" became prominent in the media and represented the new political and social climate that was emerging with the advances made by New Labour and the new UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Coming out of a period of 18 years of Conservative government, Tony Blair and New Labour were seen as young, cool and appealing, a driving force in giving Britain a feeling of optimism. Some songs from Northern Star have appeared in films, such as \"Ga Ga\" which is heard in Charmed and Big Daddy. The song \"Go\" makes an appearance in Whatever It Takes. \"Suddenly Monday\" appears in Maybe Baby and on its soundtrack. After the song gained popularity, \"I Turn to You\" was featured in the film Bend It Like Beckham. It was covered by Darkseed on \"Ultimate Darkness\", by Machinae Supremacy on \"Webography\", and by Wig Wam on 667.. The Neighbour of the Beast. The song was also featured in the musical Viva Forever!, a musical show based on the songs of the Spice Girls. Some songs have also been covered by international artists such as Christine Fan, who covered and translated \"Suddenly Monday\" in Chinese for her debut album FanFan's World, and Dutch pop singer Do who covered the Japanese bonus-track \"Follow Me\", for her album of the same name. The single \"First Day of My Life\" was originally recorded by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, with lyrics in Italian as \"Un Nuovo Giorno\" (A new day) for his 2004 album Andrea, and he also released it as a single the same year. Chisolm's version of the single was a success in German-speaking countries because it was used as the title song of the German soap opera telenovela Wege zum Gl\u00fcck. At the time of The Seas release, the lead single \"Rock Me\" served as the official theme song for German TV channel ZDF's coverage of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Chisholm has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Spice Girls and her solo efforts. The main concept of the Spice Girl albums centred on the idea of Girl Power, embodying a feminist image, as both Madonna and Bananarama had employed before, and every track deals with different aspects of this notion. Other central themes in the writing of the group were the union, solidarity, friendship, independence, love, loss of virginity, sex, contraception, the relationship with parents during adolescence, vulnerability and fame. Many of these themes were carried out even during her solo career, but with a more mature writing, intense style and in some songs a more raw and direct language. Added to these were social issues such as homelessness, and introspective themes. Having co-written 11 UK number 1s, more than any other female artist, she remains the only female performer to top the charts as a solo artist, as part of a duo, quartet and quintet. With 12 UK Number 1 singles, including the charity single as part of the Justice Collective, she is the second female artist \u2013 and the first British female artist \u2013 with the most singles at number 1 in the UK, and with a total of 14 songs that have risen to number 1 in Britain (including the double A-sides), Chisolm is the first artist with most number 1 songs in the UK ranking history. ==Discography== * Northern Star (1999) * Reason (2003) * Beautiful Intentions (2005) * This Time (2007) * The Sea (2011) * Stages (2012) * Version of Me (2016) * Melanie C (2020) ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Film !
