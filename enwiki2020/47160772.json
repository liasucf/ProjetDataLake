    "text": "The Rivers State Monorail, also known as Rivers Monorail and occasionally as Port Harcourt Monorail, is a proposed monorail urban transportation project in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. The project was announced in 2011 and construction commenced in 2012. As of September 2017 construction has only been partially completed despite $400 million having been spent and the project is at a standstill. Some reports says the project will never be completed. ==Details== It will travel on a fully segregated, mostly elevated, right of way. The right of way will include two tracks, except for single- track sections at terminals and for one-directional loops. The initial route includes two segments - Phase 1A from Sharks Park to UTC Station, and Phase 1B further north to Waterlines. The overall distance from Sharks Park to Waterlines will be 5.4 km. Further extensions are in planning phases. It is planned to use Intamin People Mover P30 monorail trains, an electric driven train especially designed and most suitable for commuter services in cities. It is the most recent model of its kind and characterized by modern design, spacious cabins, and wide doors for easy access for passengers with luggage. The train runs on rubber wheels which are connected to bogies, and is laterally guided by means of side guiding wheels. The rubber-steel interface between train and guideway will have a good friction coefficient, leading to decreased vibration transmission to the train from the track. These attributes leads to higher ride quality and passenger comfort. One train will be in operation in Phase 1A, and six trains in Phase 1B. A train will consist of seven individual cars. Six cars will carry passengers, and the seventh car will house the motors and electrical equipment. Driver\u2019s cabins will be situated at each end of the train. Passenger cars will feature safety and comfort systems. The air conditioning system is designed to provide a comfortable train interior, even if the outside temperature reaches . Each train will be able to accommodate 172 passengers, with provision for 44 seated passengers included. One end car will have access for wheelchairs, and all cabin floors will be the same height as the station platforms to provide easy access for passengers with reduced mobility. Provision will be made for hand- held luggage only. The design operating capacity for Phase 1A is 1,200 passengers per hour. With a maximum operating speed of 70km/h, the train will travel between end stations in about 8 minutes. Six trains will have a design operating capacity of 2,700 passengers per hour. Train travel time between end stations will be about 22 minutes. Passengers can expect a train to arrive every 8 minutes. ==History== The decision to build the monorail was taken in 2009. In 2010, building of the project foundations began. The Government of Rivers State had in February 2013 announced that phase 1A and 1B of the monorail system would be completed during September that year. By 2014, monorail trains were performing test runs through UTC Station. In 2015, the LP gubernatorial candidate Tonye Princewill said he would cancel the system. However, he lost the election, receiving 0.86% of the vote. In 2015, newly elected Rivers State Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike announce that the project would be reviewed. In March 2016 it was reported the government had abandoned the project. In August 2016 it was reported the incomplete project had so far cost $400 million dollars and this compared unfavorably with the Moscow monorail that also used Intamin's design but had only cost $240 million dollars and was fully operational. In September 2017 it was reported the project is at a standstill. Another report says the project will never be completed. == See also == * List of monorail systems * Cross River Monorail, also in Nigeria, opened in April 2016 ==References== Category:Transportation in Rivers State Category:Proposed monorails Category:Proposed transport infrastructure in Nigeria ",
