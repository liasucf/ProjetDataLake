The album was released on April 13, 2010. ==Background== On April 12, 2009, Jason signed to Atlantic Records, and released his first official single, \"Let's Just Fall in Love Again,\" which peaked at number 113 on Billboard Hot 100 and number 94 on the Pop 100 chart. \"Hallelujah\" and \"Over the Rainbow\" were chosen because he sang them on American Idol. To promote the album, he toured through The Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore with Matt Hires and Caitlin Crosby. He also toured with Camera Can't Lie and his younger brother Michael. Jason also used two of his singles, \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"That's What I'm Here For,\" for the wedding of The Bachelor stars Jason Mesnick and Molly Malaney, which aired on February 27, 2010. In the eighth season of Idol, Castro's younger brother Michael auditioned for the show and passed through to the Hollywood Round. However, he failed to advance to the Top 36. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== Andrew Leahey of Allmusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, pointing out his \"spaced out goofiness.\" Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, calling the album \"worth springing for.\" ===Commercial performance=== The album debuted at number eighteen on the Billboard 200 albums chart with a first week sales of 20,000, and also peaked at number nine on the Top Digital Albums chart.
