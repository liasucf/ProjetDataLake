    "text": "The M118 is a four-stroke inline-four engine produced from 1965 to 1972. == Design == The M118 was originally developed by Mercedes-Benz for the mass- produced vehicle segment. It was first used by Audi in the F103, after Daimler AG sold the company to Volkswagen. The engine replaces the previous two-stroke engines, and features a water-cooled Solex carburetor that allowed for smoother operation and enhanced efficiency. It was later revised several times with increased displacements and reduced compression ratios for improved reliability. The success of the M118 allowed Audi to expand into more upscale market segments. == Engines == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" !Displacement !Power !Torque !Years |- | | at 4,750 rpm | at 2,600 rpm |1968\u20131972 |- | rowspan=\"3\" | | at 5,000 rpm | at 2,800 rpm |1965\u20131968 |- | at 5,000 rpm | at 3,000 rpm |1968\u20131972 |- | at 5,000 rpm | at 5,000 rpm |1966\u20131968 |- | | at 5,300 rpm | at 3,000 rpm |1966\u20131971 |} === M118 === 40 kW version * 1968\u20131972 Audi 60 53 kW version * 1965\u20131968 Audi 72 55 kW version * 1968\u20131972 Audi 75 59 kW version * 1966\u20131968 Audi 80 66 kW version * 1966\u20131971 Audi 90 == References == Category:Mercedes-Benz engines Category:Inline-four engines Category:Gasoline engines by model ",
