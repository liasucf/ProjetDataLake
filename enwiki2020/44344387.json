In 2009 The Infinite Staircase toured nationally with Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society, Sevendust and Dope during the \u201cBlack Label Bash Tour\u201d. In 2013 the band charted in the Top 30 on America's Rock Radio Music Charts with their single \"The Pride\", which was a song written and recorded to benefit the victims of Hurricane Sandy. \"The Pride\" features guest performances by Zakk Wylde, Kevin Martin of Candlebox, Morgan Rose of Sevendust and John \"JD\" DeServio of Black Label Society. \"The Pride\" spent 6 weeks in the Mainstream Rock Radio Top 40 in America with its highest rank being #27. The band's follow-up single, \"The Things We've Done\" is in rotation on Music Choice's Top 50 Active Rock Songs and at Rock and Active Rock Stations across the country. The Infinite Staircase is currently writing a new covers EP that features bassist John \"JD\" DeServio (Black Label Society and Cycle Of Pain) on bass and as producer and is poised to see the release sometime in 2014. Over the course of three and a half days, Le Projet wrote and recorded three songs from scratch with no preconceived notions or ideas. The band was joined by former Black Label Society guitarist Nick Catanese during these sessions. What came to be is \"Little Shits\", \"Save Yourself\" and \"Head Down\" - three songs which define a path of destiny, encompassing bits and pieces of each members' musical pasts yet culminating into something fresh, new and exciting. ==Discography== ===With The Infinite Staircase=== * The Things We Do (Acoustic Demos) (2008) * Misty Mountain Hop: A Millennium Tribute to Led Zeppelin (2008) * The Road Less Taken (2009) * Lit Up: A Millennium Tribute to Buckcherry (2009) * Single - \"The Pride\" (feat.
