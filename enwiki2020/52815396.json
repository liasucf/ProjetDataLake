    "text": "Elijah, Eliya,. or Elias of Nisibis (11February 975\u2013 18July 1046) was a Nestorian cleric who served as bishop of Beth Nuhadra (1002\u20131008) and archbishop of Nisibis (1008\u20131046). He has been called the most important Christian writer in Arabic\u2014or even throughout non-Christian Asia\u2014during the 11th century. He is best known for his Chronography, which is an important source for the history of Sassanid Persia. ==Name== He shares the name of the Biblical prophet Elijah (, Eliyahu), whose name meant \"My God is Jah\"... The Syriac form of his name was El\u012by\u0101 or El\u012by\u0101h. In Latin translation, this became Elias. He is usually distinguished as \"Elijah of Nisibis\" (; ) from the location of his archbishopric. He is also known by the patronymic (; ),. meaning \"Elijah, son of Shenna\", in reference to the place of his birth. ==Life== The valley of the Little Zab in the 19th century. StJacob Cathedral in present-day Nusaybin, Turkey. Elijah was born in Shenna, just south of the Little Zab's confluence with the Tigris (near present-day Al-Zab, Iraq) on 11 February 975. On Sunday, 15September 994, he was ordained as a priest at the monastery of Mar Shem\u02bfon by Yohannes, archbishop of Fars and bishop of Shenna. He studied throughout northern Mesopotamia, including Mosul. On Sunday, 15February 1002, he was consecrated bishop of Beth Nuhadra (present- day Dohuk, Iraq) by Yohannan, who had become the Nestorian patriarch in 1000 by appealing directly to the Abbasid governor at Shiraz without regard to the usual election procedures.Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (.Abeloos & al.), ii. 260\u20132. On Sunday, 26December 1008, he succeeded Yahballaha as archbishop of Nisibis (present-day Nusaybin, Turkey). From 15\u201329 July 1026, he paid a series of visits\u2014the \"Seven Sessions\"\u2014to the Abbasid vizier Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Maghribi to discuss Christian doctrines and other topics. Additional meetings between the two were held in December 1026 and June 1027. Three letters\u2014two by Elijah and one by the vizier\u2014are preserved from their correspondence the following year, showing their continuing good relations. He died on 18 July 1046 at Mayyafariqin. ==Works== ===Chronography=== Elijah is best known for his Chronography or Chronology (; ), which forms an important source concerning the history of Sassanid Persia. It is divided into two sections, a chronicle modeled after Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History and a treatment of calendars and calendrical calculations. It is exceptional among Syriac chronicles for the large amount of civil history Elijah included among his ecclesiastical notices. The chronicle includes separate lists of the Sassanid dynasty (after the lost 7th-century work of James of Edessa) and the patriarchs of Seleucia (after the lost 5th-century work of Annianus of Alexandria). The popes and other patriarchs are included in the general annals which begin during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius and end with the year 1018. His treatment of calendrical systems has tables for computation of the Syriac and Persian new years and includes several Zoroastrian calendars, along with their feasts and holidays. As seen, many of Elijah's own sources, which he thoroughly documents, have now been lost and his own work is preserved in only a single manuscript,British Library Add. MS 7197. which fortunately includes few omissions. The manuscript is in Syriac, with most paragraphs in the first section followed by an Arabic translation. The Chronography was the last East Syrian text to be written in Syriac. There have been two published editions of the work: * . * . & ===Book of Sessions=== Elijah's Book of Sessions or Dialogues () claims to relate his conversations during his seven visits to the Abbasid vizier Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Maghribi.. Dedicated to the \"honorable, believing, elder brother\" Abu al- \u02bfAla Sa\u02bfid ibn Sahl al-Katib, the work is intended as a literary apologetic as much as record of the events of the seven meetings, with its epilogue including the imprimatur of the patriarchal secretary Abu al-Faraj \u02bfAbd Allah ibn at-Tayyib. In order, the chapters cover: * God's unity and trinity * Jesus's incarnation of divine and human natures * Quranic support for considering some forms of Christianity as a monotheistic religion * Logical and miraculous justifications for various Christian doctrines * Elijah's own profession of monotheism * Language and considerations of its importance in theology * Christian perspectives on astrology, Islam, and the soul According to Elijah's account, the vizier asking for the meetings after he had experienced a miraculous cure at the hands of a Christian monk, causing him to reconsider his previous understanding of their faith as polytheistic and unfaithful to God. It is particularly remembered for its statement of Christian monotheism in trinity in its 5th dialogue.. A full critical edition of the Book of Sessions along with the correspondence between Elijah and Abu'l-Qasim al-Maghribi was published by Nikolai N. Seleznyov.Seleznyov, Nikolai N., Kit\u0101b al-maj\u0101lis li-m\u0101r \u02beIliyy\u0101, mu\u1e6dr\u0101n Ni\u1e63\u012bb\u012bn, wa-ris\u0101latuh il\u0101 \u02bel-waz\u012br al-k\u0101mil Ab\u012b \u02bel-Q\u0101sim al-\u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b \u02bel-Ma\u0121rib\u012b.

Moscow, Russia : Grifon, 1439 Anno Hegirae [=2017/8 CE]. , 9785988623663. ===Other works=== A 1524 manuscript edition of Elijah's Book of the Interpreter. Elijah also composed other theological and scholarly works. He wrote defenses of Nestorianism against both Islam and other Christian denominations and treatises on Syrian canon law, asceticism, and ethics. His guide to \"rational management\" of anxiety () is also dedicated to the Abbasid vizier, whom he claims requested such a book during their sessions together. It advocates cultivating a general thankfulness; treatment of general anxiety through the religious virtues of piety, gratitude, chastity, humility, mercy, and repentance; and treatment of specific anxieties through the philosophical virtues of seeking advice, behaving well, and being generous, just, and forgiving. His \"Letter on the Unity of the Creator and Trinity of His Hypotases\" () states the arguments for trinitarianism for a curious Islamic judge. His \"Letter on the Merit of Chastity\" () attempts to refute Mu\u02bftazil\u012b al-J\u0101hiz's (. 869) arguments in favor of physical pleasure. He also composed a Syriac grammar and a Syriac\u2013Arabic dictionary, The Book of the Interpreter (; ). Because a standard Arabic script had not yet developed, the Arabic sections of the book were written using Garshuni, a transliteration of Arabic into the Syriac alphabet.. The work was further translated into Latin by Thomas Obicini as his 1636 '.. ,& Editions of these works include: * . * . ==Legacy== In addition to Elijah's importance to Persian history and for his preservation of passages of otherwise lost ancient and medieval authors, he became famed throughout the Islamic world for his studious method and wide- ranging expertise in Christian and Islamic theology, language and literature, philosophy, medicine, and mathematics. ==Notes== ==References== In addition to surviving manuscripts of Elijah's own works, the other primary source for his story is Mari ibn Sulaiman's Book of the Tower, as expanded and emended by Amr ibn Matta and Saliba ibn Yuhanna. ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * . * . * . * . * . * . & * . * .
