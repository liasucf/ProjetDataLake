    "text": "Lego is the fourth full-length studio album by the Italian progressive death metal band Sadist, released in 2000 by kmg. In this unexpected release, the band loses death vocals altogether, while maintaining hard driving guitars which are still present for a thrash metal background with vocals altered to a more nu metal styling, but on occasion Trevor provides harsher vocals. The release and sudden change in style could be traced back to the very reason the band had split-up in the first place,Sadist Biography at BNR metal pages. bnrmetal.com. Retrieved on December 24, 2007. but it is still unclear as to why this occurred. The band then went on hiatus, never to be heard from for five years after Lego was released, and returned in 2005 with a new outlook and later redeemed themselves with their self-titled release in 2007.
