His brothers, Jos\u00e9 and Manuel (born 1849) also became painters. == Biography == His first art lessons came from his older brother, Jos\u00e9, followed by classes at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Santa Isabel de Hungr\u00eda under the direction of and Antonio Cabral Bejarano. In 1868, thanks to a four year stipend from a wealthy patron, he went to Rome to see the Old Masters and complete his studies with Mari\u00e0 Fortuny.\"Luis Jimenez y Aranda, un peintre moderniste\" @ the Pontoise website. In return, he had to send back a painting every year. He remained there after his stipend expired, until 1874, sharing a home with his friends, Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero and Francisco Peralta del Campo. They also took classes together from Eduardo Rosales. At that time, he and his Italian wife Lucia moved to Paris and made the acquaintance of the art dealer, Adolphe Goupil. Two years later, he moved to Pontoise, possibly after going there to meet Camille Pissarro. He would stay there the rest of his life, becoming a naturalized citizen of France in 1877. In the 1880s, he began painting en plein aire in the surrounding countryside. He participated in exhibits at the Salon and received recognition at the Exposition Universelle (1889). He also had a major showing at the World's Columbian Exposition (1893) in Chicago.Karin Sagner-D\u00fbchting, \"La Pintura en Espa\u00f1a en la \u00e9poca del Impresionismo\", in: El impresionismo, Ed. Ingo F. Walter, Oc\u00e9ano, 2003, He was a regular participant in the Spanish National Exhibition of Fine Arts, even after settling in France. In 1864, he was given honorable mention there for a depiction of Christopher Columbus presenting his case to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, and first prize in 1892 for The Doctor's Visit. He also acted as a sort of correspondent for the Spanish magazine La Ilustraci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola y Americana, providing images and commentary on life in France. When the Spanish landscape painter Emilio S\u00e1nchez Perrier came to France to study the Barbizon School, Jim\u00e9nez shared studio and exhibit space with him. Jim\u00e9nez himself was influenced by the Barbizon style and would come to favor it in his later years. ==Selected paintings== File:En el estudio del pintor, por Luis Jim\u00e9nez Aranda.jpg|In the Painter's Studio File:Estaminet andalou.jpg|Andalusian Tavern File:Luis_Jim\u00e9nez_Aranda,_Dama_en_la_Exposici\u00f3n_Universal_de_Paris_(1889).jpg|Lady at the World's Fair File:La visita al hospital de Luis Jim\u00e9nez Aranda.jpg|A Ward Being Visited by the Head of the Hospital (The Doctor's Visit) == References == == Further reading == * Enrique Valdivieso, Pintura sevillana del siglo XIX, Seville, 1981, pp. 104-105. * Cat\u00e1logo de las pinturas del siglo XIX.
