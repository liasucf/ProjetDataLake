Gujjar are a numerical minority. == History == The two influential Sawati families were Peer Khan family and Sultan Khan family. The village saw one of the most fierce conflicts between Gujjars and Sawatis in the late 1980s. This conflict was an outcome of years long suppression of Gujjar clans by the land owner Sawatis. A Left-inclined Kisan Mahaz (Farmer Front) motivated the Gujjers to stand against oppressive landlords. The conflict resulted in many liberties for the tenant classes, like freedom from free labor etc. ==References== Category:Populated places in Mansehra District ",
