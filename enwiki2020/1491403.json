    "text": "The Subways are an English rock band from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Their debut album, Young for Eternity, was released on 4 July 2005 in the UK and 14 February 2006 in the U.S. Their second album, All or Nothing, was released on 30 June 2008 and their third album Money and Celebrity debuted on 19 September 2011. The band's self-titled fourth album was released on 9 February 2015. Charlotte Cooper at the Southside Festival 2014 ==History== ===Beginnings (2002\u20132004)=== The Subways name comes from a time when Lunn, Morgan and Cooper used to hang around the local subway underpass which ran underneath a Welwyn Garden City roundabout. They began playing at an early age in Lunn and Morgan's home (they are brothers, Lunn's birthname is William Morgan) in Welwyn Garden City, first playing Nirvana, Green Day and other punk songs, under the name of Mustardseed. They later changed their name to Platypus, and began to tour small local venues, such as The Square in Harlow, Essex. An early CD of the band playing live was recorded at The Square which they sold at gigs. The band released many demos and EPs in their early days when playing the London circuit in the UK. With every batch of new songs that The Subways would compose, Lunn would insist that the band record them. However, at such a young age the group had no money with which to go into a studio to record consistently, so they came upon the idea of buying their own cheap recording system at home. Eventually, the band had their own website, thesubways.net, which Lunn himself constructed and maintained, where they put all their new songs. Through the use of their own home recording system they now had roughly eight demos worth of songs both on the internet and being sent out to local and London promoters at various venues. The Subways then began touring in the local and London area playing regularly at the Buffalo Bar in Highbury and Islington. Having the home recording system also proved useful for production, the band felt that it would not only benefit themselves, but other local bands who could not afford the studio prices, even in the Welwyn Garden City area. It was here that Billy and Charlotte both stumbled upon the opportunity that would eventually prove significant for the band. \"I was producing a local Welwyn Garden City band in my front lounge one day and I noticed that it was quite good so I asked if they were going to send it to any London venues, because I knew a few that would like it. They said that they were going to send it off to Michael Eavis who runs Glastonbury Festival, and I asked why...\" Michael Eavis that year was running an unsigned bands competition to play on the Other Stage, and The Subways decided that would be a great idea. \"It was really just another address to send one of our CDs off to. All we wanted was to play shows and this was another great opportunity. The CD we sent off to Michael Eavis was literally one among a bunch of 30 that were being sent out to London promoters for a load of gigs we wanted to book. We never expected the phone call saying that we'd won and were to play Glastonbury\", said Cooper on radio. The Subways remain friends with Eavis today, and have suggested that other upcoming bands should send demos to Eavis. ===Young for Eternity (2004\u20132007)=== After Glastonbury, The Subways went on to play The Carling Weekend 2004 in both Reading and Leeds, and then proceeded to play their very first (self funded) tour of the UK consisting of 35 dates. John Peel was the first DJ to play single \"1am\" on National radio. The band signed to City Pavement & Infectious Records in late 2004. Their first album, Young for Eternity, which was released on 4 July 2005, was produced by Lightning Seeds frontman Ian Broudie; with their debut single \"Oh Yeah\" reaching number 25 in the UK Singles Chart on its release week 21 March 2005. The Subways appeared during the seventh episode of the third season of The O.C., \"The Anger Management\", performing two songs at the music venue 'the Bait Shop', \"Rock & Roll Queen\" and \"Oh Yeah\". The episode came to a close with \"I Want to Hear What You Have Got to Say\" playing. The band postponed touring in April 2006 because Lunn had nodules on his vocal cords. They played a \"secret\" gig in The Green Room in their home town of Welwyn Garden City on 16 June, and also as support for the Foo Fighters in Manchester at the Lancashire County Cricket Ground on 18 June (along with Eagles of Death Metal, Angels & Airwaves and The Strokes), and have recently returned to touring. In the summer of 2006 the band travelled to North America where they made numerous appearances. These included opening for the co-headlining tour of Taking Back Sunday & Angels & Airwaves and performing on the talk shows, Late Show with David Letterman and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. On 4 August they performed at the Lollapalooza music festival, and the next day they performed at Street Scene in San Diego. On 7 August they appeared on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. On 25 August they returned to Reading and Leeds Festivals, this time on the main stage. ===All or Nothing (2007\u20132010)=== On 15 May 2007, the band announced they would begin recording their second album on 4 June, and the band began recording then in Los Angeles with producer Butch Vig at Conway Studios. The band had written around twenty-five tracks which were recorded over a period of several months. In August 2007 the band came back to the UK and played a series of small warm up shows showcasing their new material, before playing at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. On 3 September 2007, the band returned to Los Angeles to complete work on their second album. On 17 October 2007 the band finished recording All or Nothing. On 18 February 2008, the band recorded their live video at The Stoke Sugarmill for their first single, \"Girls & Boys\", which was released as a free download from their website on 25 March 2008. On 24 February 2008 in an exclusive interview found on www.sundaymail.co.uk, Lunn revealed he and Cooper split up in June during studio sessions for The Subways' second album, All or Nothing. He went on to say that the break-up will not affect the band. They are both happy with their new partners. By 25 March 2008, The Subways had started their first UK tour of the year and played at the Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park, Download Festival, Oxegen Festival and Reading and Leeds Festival. On 26 May 2008, the track \"This is the Club\" was released on the internet as part of a competition for fans to produce its video using 4 video clips. On 30 June 2008, All or Nothing was released, achieved with the help of producer Butch Vig. The band's song \"Girls and Boys\" was featured as the backing song for the television show The Riches on Virgin1.
