    "text": "Andrzej Krakowski, 2018 Andrzej Krakowski (1946-) is a Polish-American award winning film producer, screenwriter and director. His production of a 10-episode dramatic TV series titled We Are New York, which was funded by and produced for the Mayor\u2019s Office of New York, won two Emmy Awards in 2010. ==Early life== Krakowski was born in Warsaw in 1946. His father was at different times a high-ranking politician, head of national tourism, political prisoner, and finally the production head of a government owned film studio \u2018Kamera\u2019. His mother, a radio journalist, had held several important international posts in her field. His maternal grandmother was a Polish revolutionary, killed in Auschwitz, whose name is still affixed to schools, factories and streets throughout Poland. Andrzej Krakowski thus grew up surrounded by the powerful men of politics on the one hand, and the creative, often politically daring, geniuses of Polish cinema on the other. World renowned artists, writers and philosophers such as Diego Rivera, Pablo Picasso, Ilia Ehrenburg, Nazim Hikmet, Max Frisch, Pablo Neruda, Yves Montand and Leszek Kolakowski were just a few of the many guests at the Krakowski home. ==Education== Krakowski received his education at the Polish National Film School in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. He studied under several prominent film directors and worked as an intern assistant to Andrzej Wajda during the making of Ashes. Attacked in the press after the March \u201968 student demonstrations, Krakowski was unexpectedly offered a scholarship in Hollywood. Shortly after his arrival in the U.S., he was stripped of his Polish citizenship and forbidden to return to his homeland. In 2014 Krakowski received a Ph.D. in Film Arts from PWSFTviT in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. ==Career== In 1970, alongside David Lynch, Terrence Malick, Paul Schrader and Jeremy Kagan, he became a producing auditor, and then fellow, at the American Film Institute. During this period he worked on and line-produced several films for his AFI colleagues: Terrence Malick's Lanton Mills, Richard Patterson\u2019s Open Window, Jeremy Kagan\u2019s Love Song by Charles Faberman and Oscar Williams\u2019 The Final Comedown, launching careers of such actors as Ron Rifkin and Billy Dee Williams. Some of those films eventually attained a cult status and are being taught at American colleges as part of film curriculum. Upon completing his education Krakowski joined YASNY Productions, Inc. as head of production. Among films he had green-lighted and supervised production of was the 1976 Oscar nominated feature documentary California Reich. After leaving YASNY, he continued producing films with his own Filmtel, Inc, including Portrait of a Hitman, starring Rod Steiger and Jack Palance, and White Dragon, starring Christopher Lloyd and Dee Wallace Stone. The latter was the first co-production between CBS network and Perspektywa, a Polish government owned studio. In less than three years, Filmtel grew from a small production company into an international production and distribution conglomerate with offices in Los Angeles, New York, London and Sydney. Expanding into television, Filmtel co-financed and distributed such successful TV shows as The Richard Simmons Show (for 4 years #1 daily-strip show) and Showtime\u2019s XIV International Championship of Magic, hosted by the legendary Tony Randall. After selling Filmtel, Krakowski returned to his first love, and today his screenwriting credits include: Triumph of the Spirit, starring Willem Dafoe and Edward James Olmos, Eminent Domain, with Donald Sutherland and Anne Archer, Tides of War, a vehicle for Ernest Borgnine and David Soul, Genghis Khan with Charlton Heston, the most expensive Italian production to date, Ogniem i Mieczem (With Fire and Sword), the highest-grossing film in Poland, and Managua, with Louis Gossett, Jr and Assumpta Serna in the lead. Facing the loss of his wife to breast cancer, Krakowski wrote, produced and directed a feature-length documentary The Politics of Cancer, which received theatrical distribution in the U.S., and were shown at the Cannes, Palm Springs and Santa Barbara Film Festivals. During 1997-2002 Krakowski, aside from his creative work, became a co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of two successful television networks: the first dual platform (over-the-air and satellite) in Central Europe NaszaTV (now Scripps Networks) and the first US Internet TV network (ForeignTV.com) in New York. In the first decade of 2000, Krakowski produced and directed a feature film based on a popular comic book, Campfire Stories, which has been sold to over 30 countries, a hit stage musical in Tokyo Felix The Cat\u2019s Musical Journey, a feature-length docudrama Farewell To My Country, chronicling the expulsion of the last Polish Jews from their homeland in 1968, and several commercials for Mercedes and BWIA airlines featuring Geoffrey Holder. Krakowski\u2019s latest feature film, Looking for Palladin, was shot in Antigua, Guatemala.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/30/movies/30looking.html?_r=0 NYTimes. Retrieved 4 April 2015.
