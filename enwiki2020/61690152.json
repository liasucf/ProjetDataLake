    "text": "Troy Daniel Reeder (born September 13, 1994) is an American football linebacker for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Penn State and Delaware. ==Early life and high school== Reeder grew up in Hockessin, Delaware and attended the Salesianum School, where he played football and lacrosse. In football, Reeder was named first team All-State (second straight season) at linebacker and the Delaware Defensive Player of the Year after making 96 tackles (60 solo) with 3.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and three fumbles recovered and first team All-State at running back after rushing for 1,154 yards and 18 touchdowns as the Sallies won the DIAA state championship. In lacrosse, Reeder was a three-time first team All-Sate selection and three time state champion. He originally committed to play the sport collegiately at North Carolina, but de-committed during his senior year as interest from football programs increased. Rated a four-star prospect by ESPN.com and a three-star recruit by Rivals, Scout, and 247Sports, Reeder committed to play college football at Penn State over offers from Miami, Vanderbilt, Virginia, Boston College, Rutgers, and Delaware. ==College career== Reeder began his college career at Penn State, redshirting his freshman year. He became the starting middle linebacker for the Nittany Lions the following season after Nyeem Wartman-White suffered a season-ending injury in the season opener against Temple. He finished the season with 67 tackles (fourth-most on the team), including 5.5 for loss, and an interception in 12 games played (11 starts) and was named to the Big Ten Conference All-Freshman team. Shortly after the end of the season, Reeder announced he would be transferring to the University of Delaware. Reeder immediately entered the Blue Hens starting lineup at outside linebacker and was named second team All- Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) after recording 63 tackles (4.5 for loss), one sack, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery along with two interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown in his Delaware debut against Delaware State, and a blocked kick. He was named first team All-CAA as a redshirt junior after leading the team with 89 (seven for loss), an interception, three pass breakups, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and a blocked kick. In his final collegiate season, Reeder led the CAA with 131 tackles and 13.5 tackles for loss and was again named first team all- conference. ==Professional career== Reeder signed with the Los Angeles Rams as an undrafted free agent on April 27, 2019 and made the team out of training camp. He made his NFL debut in the Rams season opener against the Carolina Panthers on September 8, 2019, making a tackle on special teams. Reeder made his first career start on October 3, 2019 against the Seattle Seahawks, replacing injured starter Bryce Hager and making a game-high 13 tackles. He started eight of the Rams last 12 games and finished his rookie season with 58 tackles and two forced fumbles. In Week 5 of the 2020 season against the Washington Football Team, Reeder recorded 11 tackles and the first three sacks of his NFL career during the 30\u201310 win. ==Personal life== Reeder is the son of former Delaware and Pittsburgh Steelers running back Dan Reeder. His mother Cheryl, played basketball at Elizabethtown College and was a member of the 1982 team that won the Division III national championship. His younger brother Colby was also a standout two-way player at Salesianum and plays linebacker for the Blue Hens. Colby's commitment to play football at Delaware was a factor in Troy's decision to transfer there from Penn State. ==References== ==External links== *Penn State Nittany Lions bio *Los Angeles Rams bio *Delaware Blue Hens bio Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:American football linebackers Category:People from Hockessin, Delaware Category:Los Angeles Rams players Category:Players of American football from Delaware Category:Penn State Nittany Lions football players Category:Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football players Category:Sportspeople from Wilmington, Delaware Category:Salesianum School alumni ",
