    "text": "Emperor of Central Africa () was the title used by Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa from 4 December 1976, and was crowned on 4 December 1977 in a lavish ceremony that was estimated to cost his country US$20 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Although nominally a constitutional monarch, in practice Bokassa ruled with absolute power. For all intents and purposes, the country was still a military dictatorship, as had been the case since Bokassa took power in the 1966 coup d'\u00e9tat. Bokassa I attempted to justify his actions by claiming that creating a monarchy would help Central Africa \"stand out\" from the rest of the continent, and earn the world's respect. The coronation consumed one third of the nation's annual budget and all of the French aid that year, but despite generous invitations, no foreign leaders attended the event. Many thought Bokassa was insane, and compared his egotistical extravagance with his contemporary \u2013 Africa's other well-known eccentric dictator, President of Uganda Idi Amin. ==Gallery== File:Imperial Crown of Bokassa I.svg|Imperial Crown of Bokassa I.
