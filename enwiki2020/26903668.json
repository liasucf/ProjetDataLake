Phocas and his family were likely of Thraco-Roman origin.Bury (2009), p. 197 Phocas and Domentziolus' mother was named Domentzia. A third brother is known, named Comentiolus.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 326 In 603, Phocas appointed Domentziolus as his magister officiorum, a post he continued to hold throughout Phocas' reign. In 610, facing the revolt of Heraclius, Domentziolus was sent by Phocas to man the Anastasian Wall. When he heard however that Heraclius' fleet had reached Abydos, he fled to Constantinople.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 417 After the overthrow and execution of Phocas, he too was executed on the orders of Heraclius, but his apparent son, the general and curopalates Domentziolus, was spared at the intercession of Theodore of Syceon.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 417\u2013418 == References == == Sources == * * Category:6th- century births Category:610 deaths Category:Magistri officiorum Category:Executed Byzantine people Category:7th-century Byzantine people Category:7th-century executions by the Byzantine Empire Category:Generals of Phocas ",
