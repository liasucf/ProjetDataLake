    "text": "Alain Weber (8 December 1930 \u2014 14 November 2019) was a French composer and music educator. == Training and activities == Born in Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, Weber began his studies at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1941. First Grand Prix de Rome in 1952, he won the same year the Sogeda Prize for his ballet Le Petit Jeu. Lecturer at the Conservatoire de Paris since 1957, he taught preparation for the teaching profession, solf\u00e8ge and counterpoint, then in 1970 he assumed the function of professor advisor to studies. The Grand Prix du disque fran\u00e7ais was awarded to him in 1982 for his television work La Rivi\u00e8re Perdue. President of many juries, he was also a member of the symphonic commission of the SACEM (1980\u201383), then of the reading committee of Radio France. He carried out numerous educational missions abroad (Tunisia, Canada, Yugoslavia, Taiwan...). Alain Weber was an officer of the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite. == Technique and aesthetics == Weber's work focuses on an exploration of forms of writing that are constantly being renewed. Parallel to some serials works freely treated (Variations pour dixtuor, 1965 - Synecdoque pour hautbois, 1970), he developed a writing in quarter tones (Saxophone Quartet, 1984 - Constellaire, 1994). He also employed various techniques of indeterministic composition, such as certain uses of transparent sheets, which, seen from different angles, generate transformations of pre-established melodic and harmonic propositions (Linear I, II, III, respectively for saxophone and orchestra, for octet, and for sextet of ondes Martenot, 1973\u201377). Fascinated by poetic forms, he knows how to reconnect with the spirit of the pantoum (Strophes, 1965), and acrostic (\u00c9tudes Acrostiches, 1973), also inspired by the phonemes of Jean Cocteau's Po\u00e8me de l'\u00c9toile to create a vocal expression in onomatopoeias (Phon\u00e8minie, 1983 - Le \"Chan\" du Potager, 1984). He composed a musical tale for children (Le rus\u00e9 petit Jean, 1984), but also instrumental works: his pedagogical research led him to use random, a rather flexible technique, assimilable by young performers (Concertante for guitar and guitars, 1993). Each work poses a different musical problem, however, Weber's compositions evolve through a certain unity, never revealing a real break. == Selected works == * Variations (1965), for tentet, piano and percussion, \u00e9dition Leduc. * Strophes (1966), for trumpet, string orchestra and percussions, \u00e9dition Leduc. * D'Apr\u00e8s Wols (1969), 3 watercolours for cello and orchestra, \u00e9dition Billaudot. * Synecdoque (1970), for solo oboe, \u00e9dition Leduc. * \u00c9tudes Acrostiches en forme de variations (1970), for piano, \u00e9dition Leduc. * Epitome (1972), for solo cello, \u00e9dition Billaudot. * Lin\u00e9aire I (1973), for alto saxophone and orchestra, \u00e9dition Billaudot. * Projections (1974), for percussion ensemble, \u00e9dition Leduc. * Mantra (1974), for oboe and celtic harp, unpublished. * Ricordarsi (1975), for string ensemble, unpublished. * Lin\u00e9aire II (1977), for Octet, unpublished. * Syllepse (1977), for piano, percussion, ondes Martenot, unpublished. * La Rivi\u00e8re Perdue (1982), for nine instruments and string orchestra, unpublished. * Phon\u00e8minie (1983), for mixed choir and instrumental ensemble, unpublished. * Quatuor de saxophones (1984), quarter-tone piece, unpublished. * Concertante for guitare and guitares (1993), an unpublished work of an educational nature. * Concert des Mille: \"Concerto pour un conservatoire\" (1998), for the thousand students performing of the , unpublished. == Selected discography == * Concertino for French horn and orchestra, Disque Magic Horn DC 191110(1), 1958. * D'apr\u00e8s Wols, unpublished ORTF, Barclay 995040, 1969. * Bruissement, Verseau M.10044, 1979. * Cantus, Quantum SM 61, 1990. * Chant de Biwa, BB-Music LC 9161, 1994. * Musique de chambre, REM 311318, 1998. * Cadentiel, FDS 57926, 1998. == References == == External links == * Biography, selection of works, discography, links, musical extracts, musicological interview * * Biography of Alain Weber on Centre de documentation de la musique contemporaine Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:Prix de Rome for composition Category:French male composers Category:20th-century French composers Category:1930 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry Category:Officers of the National Order of Merit (France) Category:20th- century French male musicians ",
