    "text": ".nl is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Netherlands. It is one of the most popular ccTLDs with over six million registered .nl domains . It was one of the first ccTLD to be registered, and the first to be registered outside the United States, when the authority for the .nl domain was handed over to Piet Beertema of the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in 1986. ==Registry== Since 31 January 1996, .nl domains are registered by the Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Nederland (SIDN, in English: Foundation for Internet Domain Registration Netherlands), based in Arnhem. Most registrars are ISPs, IT service bureaus and media service bureaus, but several large enterprises with many brand names have also become a registrar, or participant as SIDN calls them, which is a quite uncommon phenomenon in the domain name industry. Registrars have to pay SIDN a fee for each domain since 1 April 1996, until then registration was free. SIDN does not deal directly with Registrants. In the early days, most of the registrants were universities and research departments of large companies, such as Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium. ==Second-level domains== Official second-level domains do not exist. A number of companies have taken the opportunity to register domains like co.nl and com.nl, using them to sell third-level domains. These are not affiliated with SIDN. Individuals were allowed to register a second-level .nl domain since 2003. As a forerunner, individuals were allowed to register a third-level domain since 2000. Such 'personal domains' had the form of . They never became popular, and registration has been suspended since 2006. Because there were only around 500 of such domains registered, in contrast to about 5 million second-level domains, SIDN announced the discontinuance of personal domains as of 2008 on 4 July 2007. ==Other country-code TLDs under the Kingdom of Netherlands== * .an \u2013CC TLD for the former multi-nation Netherlands Antilles federation * .aw \u2013CC TLD for Aruba * .bq \u2013CC TLD for the Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba) * .cw \u2013CC TLD for Cura\u00e7ao * .sx \u2013CC TLD for Sint Maarten ==See also== * Internet in the Netherlands * .amsterdam * .eu \u2013CC TLD for the European Union * .frl TLD for the province of Friesland ==References== ==External links== * .nl Domain Delegation Data * .nl Registry website * List of .nl registrars Category:1986 establishments in the Netherlands Category:Internet properties established in 1986 Category:Country code top-level domains Category:Internet in the Netherlands Category:Mass media in the Netherlands Category:Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries members sv:Toppdom\u00e4n#N ",
