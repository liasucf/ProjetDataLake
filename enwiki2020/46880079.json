    "text": "Moderate Islam and moderate muslim is a label used within counterterrorism discourse as the complement of \"Islamic extremism\", implying that the support of Islamic terrorism is the characteristic of a \"radical\" faction within Islam, and that there is a \"moderate\" faction of Muslims who denounce extremist violence such as Islamic terrorism, militant Jihadism and radical Islamism. Moderation in Islam or moderate Islam is also a term that occurs as interpretation of the Islamic concepts of Wasatiyyah or Wasat (the middle way, center, balanced, best) as well as Iqtisad (\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f) (right way, middle way, honest, truthful way) and Qasd (\u0642\u0635\u062f). These terms are used in the Quran, for example to describe the muslim community: Moderate views, in the first sense, are widespread according to opinion polls. A majority in eleven Sunni Muslim countries are very negative towards the Islamic State. Moderate perceptions are especially common among Muslims in the western world, for example Euroislam. Of US Muslims, 82 percent (2017) are concerned about Muslim global extremism, 81 percent believe that suicide bombing can never be justified, and 48 percent believe Muslim leaders have not done enough to prevent extremism (2011). ==Criticism== Several Muslim scholars have noted the harm caused by using the term \"moderate.\" It implies that being fully Muslim is dangerous, and that terrorism and extremism are the norm in the Islamic tradition. The writer Shireen Younus explains, \"The qualifier of \u201cmoderate\u201d suggests that there is something innately violent about Islam. It leads to the false conclusion that a small group of \u201cmoderates\u201d is standing in opposition to a large swath of violent, ISIS-supporting radicals. This is simply not true because the reality is the complete opposite. When the media talks about \u201cmoderate Muslims\u201d, they are perpetuating a dangerous narrative of Islam as a violent religion that is at odds with American society.\" The Doctor of Law Lorenzo G. Vidino describes the term as \"inherently controversial, vague and subjective\" and Muslim scholars such as Dr Debbie Almontaser have argued that Muslim populations predictably find the \"moderate Muslim\" label offensive. Adrian Cherney and Kristina Murphy argue that the categorisations of moderate/extremist are not neutral, and that their widespread deployment \"deprives Muslims of the agency to define the parameters of the debate around counterterrorism and also the terms of reference through which they are labelled as either for or against terrorism.\" Although some Muslims do employ the use of such language, it is seen by others as further stigmatising Muslim communities and Islam. The Pakistani born journalist Sarfraz Manzoor also explains that the \"moderate Muslim\" label offensive, as he believes that it implies ordinary Islam is not inherently peaceful. Others believe that it implies that \"moderate Muslims\" are not \"fully Muslim\", or that the term equivalates \"progressive\" or \"secular\" with \"moderate\". Others, such as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan (in response to the Saudi Crown Prince's \u2018moderate Islam\u2019 pledge) reject the term as a Western notion stating that there is only one Islam.Erdo\u011fan criticizes Saudi Crown Prince\u2019s \u2018moderate Islam\u2019 pledge, Hurriyet, 10 Nov 2017 The general criticism of this term is that it implies that the \"Islam\" and \"Muslim\" refer to something inherently violent, giving the impression that they need an adjective (\"moderate\") to assure otherwise. ==Related branches of Islam== Liberalism and progressivism within Islam is sometimes seen as a subset of moderate orientations of Islam, while other moderate views may be conservative. ===Moderate islamism=== Moderate islam should not be confused with moderate islamism. Before the 2008 Egypt election, the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood was described as moderate Islamists in comparisons to the more radical Islamists in the country's Salafist party,Robert S. Leiken, Steven Brooke, The moderate muslim brotherhood, , the thinktank Council on Foreign Relations March/April 2007 although the movement has always taken a stand against secularism, it has been banned in the country and later has been classified as a terrorist organization by several countries. The Ennahdha Party of Tunisia has been described as a moderate Islamist party since the 1980s, when it advocated a \"Tunisian\" form of Islamism recognizing democracy, political pluralism and a \"dialogue\" with the West. In 2011, a spokesman for the party described it as moderate Islamic rather than Islamistic, since it does not want a theocracy. ==See also== *Cultural muslim *Moderate *Wasatiyyah (Islamic term) *Enlightened moderation *Euroislam *Islam and modernity *Islamic modernism *Liberalism and progressivism within Islam *Liberal Catholicism *Moderate, a middle position in a left/right political scale *Moderation, the process of eliminating or lessening extremes. *Pacifism in Islam *Peace in Islamic philosophy ==References== ==External links== *The Plight of the Hypocrites *The Mix of Disbelieving People * * Category:War on Terror Category:Islam and politics Category:Islamic terrorism ",
