Her career began in design, illustration, and brand consultancy for a prestigious portfolio of brands and designers, including Miu Miu, Versace, DKNY, Moncler, Lacroix, Calvin Klein, and Theory. She was the stylist of the first Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 1995. Bartlett gained accolades styling for Bj\u00f6rk, Madonna, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, Chloe Sevigney, Pharrell Williams, and Venus Williams. She was Fashion Editor at Allure magazine prior to becoming Fashion Director for Interview and BIG Magazine. She has created fashion editorials for i-D, Num\u00e9ro, V, French, Italian, and L'Uomo Vogue. In the Fall of 2003, Victoria branched out on her own as the sole designer and originator of VPL. This award-winning line filled a niche between lingerie and sportswear with utilitarian, stylish garments that were meant to be mixed, matched, and layered. Merging comfort, functionality, and fashion, VPL positioned itself well as an everyday uniform for a sophisticated, multi-faced clientele. The line grew in the high-end contemporary collection, and in 2013 it extended into fashion active with the addition of swim, shoes and accessories, with collections sold in more than 25 countries with hundreds of retail partners and a flagship store in SOHO. Victoria exited VPL in February 2016 to embark on new projects: She is currently consulting a new fashion active line with Stella Ishi and will preview for S/S 2018.
