As president of the Jeunes Socialistes (young socialists), he was made prisoner and taken to the Dachau concentration camp. After his liberation from the camp, he spoke about the atrocities of the Nazi regime and its efforts to impose a regime that precludes free speech and many forms of freedom and liberties, this leading to extermination of any opponents to the regime, and many people considered as passively opposed to the Regime, like the Jews, the Romani and many others. He died in Brussels as a result of a thrombosis. == External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20120717052242/http://www.arthurhaulot.be/ Category:1913 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Belgian poets in French Category:Belgian journalists Category:Walloon people Category:Belgian resistance members Category:Dachau concentration camp survivors Category:Deaths from thrombosis Category:People from Li\u00e8ge Category:20th- century Belgian poets Category:Belgian male poets Category:20th-century Belgian male writers Category:20th-century journalists ",
