    "text": "Tom Shaner is an American songwriter and musician, performer, director, and writer based in New York City. Much of his music revolves around three styles, \"his trilogy,\" as he describes, which are ghost songs, waltzes, and rock and roll. Woven together, these three elements define his sound. Tom has been described many different ways. Some have said he is somewhere between Leonard Cohen and Radiohead, among other comparisons. His music roots could be considered deep. Informed by American acoustic and electric Blues, Sun Records, the British Invasion, to Punk, New Wave, to Hip Hop, and Indie Rock, Shaner is known for his rich and mercurial songwriting. Before becoming a solo artist, Tom was lead singer and songwriter for NYC based band Industrial Tepee, and was a buddy and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jeff Buckley. Shaner first garnered success as a solo artist with the release of his E.P. titled \u201cGet Real or Get Gone.\u201d (2011) The E.P. was reviewed favorably by a number of online magazines including NeuFutur and Music Emissions. According to Mark Morton of Music Emissions, \"Tom Shaner is a folk singer-songwriter, whose sound borders on the surreal, placing him somewhere between the realms of Nick Cave and Tom Waits. Yet, he performs with a true unpretentious earnestness akin to classic Simon & Garfunkel.\" Similar accolades were given by James McQuiston of NeuFutur Magazine: \"There are few singer-songwriters that are able to create something that successfully marries the rich tradition brought the genre by luminaries like Dylan and Cohen in the sixties with a vitality and vibrancy that is germane to current audiences. However, I believe that Tom Shaner does just that.\" Shaner then released the full-length album \"Ghost Songs, Waltzes, and Rock and Roll\" (2012) on the Mother West Label to critical acclaim. Music journalists from RUST, Baby Sue Music Review, Galway Independent, New York Music Daily, Power of POP, all gave the album praising reviews. RustZine.com said \"Tom Shaner is thoroughly American, completely New York, 100% right now, and this is an album that simply must be heard. It's a celestial alignment of ideas, people and energies. It's an all-time great album, from a rarified artist. Essential.\" The Galway Independent's said \"It is this eclectic taste, which lends his dusty Americana a fresh and modern sound. There are undoubtedly strong hints of Dylan and Waits in his voice and songs, but, while his sound has its roots in the past, it is not stuck there. \u2018Forever Drug\u2019, from his latest album \u2018Ghost Songs, Waltzes and Rock & Roll\u2019, for example, sounds like Beck jamming with Alabama. Tom\u2019s songs often have an undercurrent of humour running through them; even the more somber numbers have an eccentricity to them that few artists can muster...Shaner\u2019s music has an infectious swagger and underlying positivity that seems effortless.\" Just recently (November) Shaner proudly released his second full length album titled \u2033I Hate To See Your Spirit Fade.\u2033 (2015). It's a dynamic collection of 17 tracks that continues and deepens the world of songs Shaner staked out on his previous album in 2012. The new record was produced by Tom and mastered by Grammy winner Brian Lucey (The Black Keys, The Shins, The Arctic Monkeys, Beck, The Arcs). == History == === Early life=== Shaner was raised in Connecticut where he was involved in sports and theater.
