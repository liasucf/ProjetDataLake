    "text": "Baljit Singh Khakh is a British neuroscientist and Professor of Physiology and Neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. ==Education and career== Baljit Khakh completed his Ph.D. at University of Cambridge in 1995 in the laboratory of Patrick PA Humphrey. He then completed postdoctoral fellowships first in the laboratory of Graeme Henderson at the University of Bristol, then in the laboratories of Henry A. Lester and Norman Davidson at California Institute of Technology. In 2001, Khakh joined the faculty as a Group Leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. In 2006, Khakh moved to the University of California, Los Angeles and is now Professor of Physiology and Neurobiology. In 2013, Khakh was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology as well as awarded the National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award. In 2018, he was awarded the Paul G. Allen Distinguished Investigator Award. In 2019, Khakh received a R35 Outstanding Investigator Award from NINDS. ==Research== Khakh's research has focused on the regulation and role of astrocytes in the brain. His group is particularly well known for working on ion channels that are involved in regulating astrocyte function. ==Major publications== *Tong X, Ao Y... Khakh BS (2014).
