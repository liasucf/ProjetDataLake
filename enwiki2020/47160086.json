    "text": "David Milford Hume (21 October 1917, Muskegon, Michigan, United States - 19 May 1973), was an American medical doctor and pioneer in kidney disease research and treatment. He was part of the team that performed the first successful kidney transplant. Hume also published a landmark paper on renal transplantation. Following Dr. Hume's untimely death in an airplane crash his legacy at The Medical College of Virginia lived on thanks to the efforts of Gene Pierce, Medical College of Virginia Medical School Surgery Department. Gene hired a health care administrator who transformed Dr. Hume's multiple grant funded transplant segments to a hospital based Medicare funded program when Medicare assumed the funding of End Stage Renal Disease. The hospital's Dietary Department assumed responsibility for food service to the Transplant Unit and the hospital's clinical laboratory assumed responsibility for all lab work. The Tissue Typing Laboratory, Organ Harvesting Program and ALG Laboratory continued to function along with the Transplant Program's inpatient unit. ==David M. Hume Memorial Award== The David M.
