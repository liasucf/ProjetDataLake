    "text": ":For other singers named Zo\u00eb, see Zoe Zo\u00eb (born Zo\u00eb Pollock, 19 January 1969, Peckham, London) is a British pop singer and songwriter, who had brief success in 1991 with two hit singles, \"Sunshine on a Rainy Day\", which climbed to number 4 on the UK Singles Chart, and \"Lightning\", which reached number 37 (and spent three weeks in the UK Top 40). Zo\u00eb has released two solo albums and five singles. ==Career== She initially started her career in the mid-1980s, by auditioning for Jimi Cauty and Youth to be the lead singer for their band Brilliant. She began dating Youth, who would later produce her two solo albums. Zo\u00eb released her debut single, \"Sunshine On A Rainy Day\", in late 1990, with two different music videos. It failed to reach the UK Top 40, however it was remixed and re-released in 1991 and it became a Top 10 hit, peaking at number 4. Her d\u00e9but album, Scarlet Red and Blue (to which singer Sam Brown contributed) included \"Sunshine on a Rainy Day\" and another moderately popular song, \"Lightning\", which peaked and spent a respectable 3 weeks at number 37 on the UK Singles Chart. The album, despite good promotion and reviews, however, did not sell well, reaching only number 67 on the UK Albums Chart. It featured similar dance-pop tracks as well as soulful ballads. Soulful vocalists Sam Brown and Yazz both provided backing-vocals on the album. \"Holy Days\" was the last single from Scarlet Red and Blue, released in February 1992, but only managed number 72. In 1991, Zo\u00eb sang backing vocals on Bananarama's Pop Life album, which was produced by Youth. In 1996, Zo\u00eb re- emerged (still signed to M&G; Records) with a revamped image, style and sound. Her new album, Hammer was American rock. The title track was released as a single, but failed to reach the UK Singles Chart. After this album she disappeared from the music scene for several years, travelling around the world and becoming a sculptor and potter. Zo\u00eb recorded an EP under the alias Hephzibah Broom, released by an independent Manchester label. Zo\u00eb became part of the female folk duo Mama, with singer Sarah McQuaid. They released their debut album, Crow Coyote Buffalo, in late 2008. The album includes a folk re- recording of Zo\u00eb's signature song, \"Sunshine on a Rainy Day\", for which the group also made a music video. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"|UK |- |1991 |Scarlet Red and Blue | * Released: 1991 * Label: Polydor, M&G; | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 67 |- |1996 |Hammer | * Released: 1996 * Label: M&G;, BMG | style=\"text- align:center;\" | - |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Year ! rowspan=\"2\" |Single ! colspan=\"5\" |Peak chart positions |- !AUS !IRE !SWE !UK\"Chart Log UK - Z2 \u2013 ZZ Top\".
