    "text": "Sexy Beast is a 2000 crime film directed by Jonathan Glazer (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Louis Mellis and David Scinto. It stars Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsley and Ian McShane. It follows Gal Dove (Winstone), a retired ex-gangster visited by a violent gangster (Kingsley) who demands that he takes part in a bank job. Kingsley's performance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In 2004 the magazine Total Film named Sexy Beast the 15th best British film. ==Plot== Ex-criminal Gary \"Gal\" Dove is happily retired in Spain with his beloved wife DeeDee, best friend Aitch and Aitch's wife Jackie. A boulder falls from a hill, nearly hits him, and lands in his swimming pool, damaging its double-heart insignia. After an unsuccessful rabbit hunt with Aitch and Enrique, a Spanish boy who helps him around the house, Gal has a dream of a demonic, anthropomorphic rabbit pointing a gun at him. An old criminal associate, the feared sociopath Don Logan, arrives at Gal's villa, intent on enlisting Gal for a bank robbery in London. Crime lord Teddy Bass learned about the vault from Harry, the bank's chairman, whom he met at an orgy. Gal politely declines, claiming he is no longer \u201cmatch fit\u201d (and, privately, still traumatised by a prior long prison stay) but Don grows increasingly aggressive and violent. After Gal suggests Don's real reason for visiting is his infatuation with Jackie, with whom he had a brief affair, Don grows furious and demands to be taken to the airport. On the plane, Don refuses to extinguish his cigarette prior to take-off, is aggressive to staff and other passengers, and is ejected. Don returns to the villa screaming obscenities and attacks Gal with a bottle. Enrique threatens him with a gun, but Don disarms him. DeeDee aims Gal\u2019s shotgun at Don, but in the next scene Gal appears in a rainy London at the hotel where he was told to stay by Don, suggesting he has had no alternative but to accept the job. Teddy asks Gal where Don is. Gal claims Don called him from Heathrow Airport and continues to feign ignorance and hide his panic as Teddy asks more questions. During the heist, Teddy's crew use diving gear to drill into Harry's vault from a pool in a neighbouring bath house. As Gal works, Don\u2019s fate is revealed \u2013 DeeDee shot Don in the stomach with the shotgun and then she, Jackie and Gal beat him. When a bloodied Don taunts Aitch that he had sex with Jackie, Aitch crushes his head with a barbeque set. The pool water floods the vault and shorts its security system. As the crew empties the vault's safe deposit boxes, Gal secretly pockets a pair of ruby earrings encrusted with diamonds. After the job, Teddy insists on driving Gal to the airport. He stops at Harry's home, where he kills Harry and demands Gal tell him where Don is. Gal finally responds that he is \"not into this any more\", effectively admitting he did not want to do the job and has killed Don. Teddy tells Gal that he does not care about Don but implies Gal would also be dead if he did. He gives Gal \u00a310 as payment for the job (Don had promised him 2.5 or 3% of the takings), giving him a twenty-pound-note and demanding change. Teddy leaves Gal at a bus stop. Gal pulls out the stolen gem encrusted earrings, his hidden reward for the job. Gal returns to his friends and family in Spain, where DeeDee wears the earrings and life has returned to normal. Gal hears Don's voice tell him that he knew Gal would do the job; Gal responds that Don is dead now and can shut up. Under the restored double-heart insignia of the swimming pool, the demonic rabbit kicks open a coffin, revealing Don, who exhales smoke with contempt. ==Cast== * Ray Winstone as Gary \"Gal\" Dove, a retired criminal who married DeeDee and moved to Spain to start a new life * Ben Kingsley as Don Logan, a violent sociopath and recruiter for the London underworld * Ian McShane as Teddy Bass, a London crime boss * Amanda Redman as DeeDee Dove, Gal's beloved wife and a former porn star * James Fox as Harry, a banker who shows Bass the vault * Cavan Kendall as Aitch, Dove's best friend * Julianne White as Jackie, Aitch's wife, who had a fling with Logan * \u00c1lvaro Monje as Enrique, a Spanish boy who helps Gal around the house ==Production== Producer Jeremy Thomas later remembered his experience making the film: ==Reception== , the film has an approval rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 134 reviews with an average rating of 7.21/10.
