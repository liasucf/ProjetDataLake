It is also known as the cranberry bean, Roman bean, romano bean (not to be confused with the Italian flat bean, a green bean also called \"romano bean\"), saluggia bean, gadhra bean or rosecoco bean. The bean is a medium to large tan or hazelnut-colored bean splashed or streaked with red, magenta or black. Saluggia beans are named after Saluggia in northern Italy, where they have been grown since the early 1900s. ==Characteristics== The borlotti bean is a variety of the cranberry bean bred in Italy to have a thicker skin. It is used in Italian, Portuguese (Catarino bean), Turkish, and Greek cuisine. The cranberry bean looks similar to the pinto bean, but cranberry beans are larger and have big maroon specks on a creamy white background, more like Great Northern beans. After cooking, however, the specks vanish and the beans take on a more even, darker color. (a) three raw borlotti beans. (b) the same three borlotti beans, but cooked.
