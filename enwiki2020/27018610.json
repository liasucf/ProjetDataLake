He has been identified with the Cristiano Vurstisio who was credited by Galileo with introducing the teachings of Copernicus to the University, where Galileo was teaching mathematics. He may have been a son of Christian Wursteisen of Basel, who has also been credited with introducing the Copernican system to Padua.
