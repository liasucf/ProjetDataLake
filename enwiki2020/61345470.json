Lapa station photo, viewed from Rua William Speers. Lapa station was opened by S\u00e3o Paulo Railway on 20 February 1899. In 1947, SPR lines were transferred to the federal government, which created Santos-Jundia\u00ed Railway (EFSJ). Later, EFSJ started the line electrification and rebuilt many stations, among them Lapa station, in the 1950s. In this decade, Lapa station of Sorocaba Railway was built, away from the EFSJ station. After the decay of commuter trains, in the 1970s and 1980s, the station was transferred in 1994 to CPTM, which started a small reform in it years later. ==Projects== Due to the existence of two Lapa stations, separated by and without any connection, CPTM elaborated a unification project. Besides the unification, the station should receive one more train line, 8-Diamond, and two Metro lines, 20-Pink (Lapa-Prefeito Saladino) and 23-Magenta (Lapa-Dutra). ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1899 ",
