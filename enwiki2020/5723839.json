The mayor sentences them to hang. Their father comes to plead for them, but is unsuccessful. The daughters, if they appear, also plead without success. On his return, the father may tell the mother that their sons will return at Christmas. In some variants, the daughters and the parents die as well, of grief. ==Commentary== This ballad appears closely related to The Wife of Usher's Well.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 173, Dover Publications, New York 1965 In some variants of that ballad, the wife's dead sons return to her as ghosts at Christmas; this sort of appearance may be what the father means in the variants when he speaks of their coming at Christmas. ==References== Category:Child Ballads Category:Year of song unknown ",
