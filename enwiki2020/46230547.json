    "text": "Al Anad Air Base is a military airbase in the Lahij Governorate, Yemen. It is the biggest air base in Yemen. == History == The base served as a headquarters for United States intelligence-gathering and counterterrorism operations in southern Yemen until the aftermath of the 2014\u201315 Yemeni coup d'\u00e9tat, in which the Houthis took control of the Yemeni government and launched a military offensive against the remnants of the Western-backed administration in Aden. In March 2015, the U.S. withdrew its remaining special forces from the base when Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) briefly took over the governornate. Days later, on 25 March, the installation was taken over by Houthi fighters and the 201st Armoured Brigade of the Yemen Army. The following day, forces loyal to President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi shelled the base, causing at least some Houthis to flee. Loyalist fighters backed by Saudi and UAE ground forces retook the installation on 3 August 2015, with its rebel defenders fleeing to the nearby hills. The recapture came two weeks after the government's victory in the Battle of Aden. On 31 January 2016 it was reported that a Tochka tactical ballistic missile fired by Houthi rebels struck the base killing dozens of Sudanese fighters and new Yemeni recruits. A Houthi drone penetrated the air base on January 10, 2019, and exploded above a podium where senior army officials were sitting. The head of Yemen Inteligence Agency and six soldiers were killed and some senior officials were injured. ==References== Category:Military installations of Yemen Category:Military history of Yemen Category:Lahij Governorate Category:United States\u2013Yemen relations ",
