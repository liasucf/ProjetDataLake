Rudy Giuliani wrote of this period in his 2002 book, Leadership, explaining that she capably served as a solid mayoral adviser after September 11 because she \"had been a nurse for many years, and afterward a pharmaceutical executive; she had managed a team of people and had many organizational skills.
