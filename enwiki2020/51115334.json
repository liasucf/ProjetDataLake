    "text": "The Arauco Basin () is a sediment-filled depression \u2013a sedimentary basin\u2013 in south-central Chile. In the context of plate tectonics it is classified as a forearc basin. The basin has an approximate area of and at its deeper parts the surface of its sedimentary fill reaches below sea-level. The basin is interpreted as being part of an uplifted part of the continental shelf. To the west it bounds an active accretionary prism that lies next to the Chile trench and to the east it bounds metamorphic basement representing a fossil Paleozoic accretionary complex that has been intruded by the Coastal Batholith of central Chile. Traditionally the centre of coal mining in Chile, large-scale coal mining in Arauco Basin ended in the 1990s.Explotacion Reservas. CNE. Accessed on September 10. 2012. Given a high density of geological faults that have displaced the coal beds and the thin nature of these (less than one metre) mining activity in Arauco Basin has proven difficult to mechanize.Carb\u00f3n mantiene su sitial en Chile == Stratigraphy == The sedimentary fill has a maximum thickness of ca. . Parts of the basin are on land in Arauco Peninsula where Eocene coal-bearing rocks of marine and continental origin and Eocene age are exposed. On top of these rocks and toward the centre of the peninsula Miocene and Pliocene sedimentary rocks exists. Towards the east Cretaceous sedimentary rocks crop out.

It lies on an unconformity that cuts across all other formations of the basin. At present it reaches above sea level in some locations and is dissected by a number of small valleys. The base of the Ranquil Formation is the so-called \u201cmain unconformity\u201d which is thought to have formed by erosion during a period of tectonic inversion. == Tectonic evolution == A three-stage model of evolution has been proposed for the Arauco Basin. First a phase of extension in the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. Then a basin inversion lasting from the Middle Eocene to the Miocene causing the uplift and erosion that created the \u201cmain unconformity\u201d and finally a post-inversion phase of strike-slip faulting in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The subduction of the Mocha Fracture Zone under the basin that begun about 3.6 million years ago is believed to have caused the uplift of the basin plus some further tectonic inversion and contraction. == See also == * Caldera Basin * Cura-Mall\u00edn Basin * Magallanes Basin == Notes == == References == Category:Forearc basins Category:Sedimentary basins of Chile Category:Geology of Biob\u00edo Region ",
