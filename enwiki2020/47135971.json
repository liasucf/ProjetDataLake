Patel, 576 U.S. 409 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a Los Angeles law, Municipal Code \u00a7 41.49, requiring hotel operators to retain records about guests for a ninety-day period is facially unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it does not allow for pre-compliance review.City of Los Angeles v. Patel: SCOTUSblog, SCOTUSblog.com, n.d. (last viewed July 13, 2015); , slip op. (2015) (hereinafter cited as Patel). == Background == Los Angeles, in its city code,Los Angeles, Cal. Municipal Code \u00a7 41.49 (hereinafter cited as LAMC). required hotels to keep certain specified information about their customers, including the name and address, vehicle information, dates of the stay, room number, and how the customer paid the bill, among other information.Patel, at *5-6; City of Los Angeles v. Patel article, The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law (last visited June 24, 2015) (hereinafter cited as Oyez Project). The hotel had to keep the information for 90-days, and if a police officer requested the information, the hotel had to make it available or face criminal penalties.LAMC \u00a7 41.49(3)(a). In 2003, Naranjibhai and Ramilaben Patel and other hotel operators sued the city in the federal district court, alleging that the ordinance violated the Fourth Amendment.Patel, at *7; Oyez Project. ===Lower courts=== ====U.S. District Court==== The case was first heard in the U.S. District Court by Judge Dale S. Fischer.Patel v. City of Los Angeles, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78914 (C.D. Cal., Sept. 5, 2008). The city argued that the hotel industry was \"closely regulated,\" which would allow administrative inspections without a search warrant.2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78914, at *5; Oyez Project. Judge Fischer found that the industry was not closely regulated, noting that the city had provided no information to show that it was closely regulated.2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78914, at *6. She concluded, however, that the hotel owners had no reasonable expectation of privacy and that the ordinance was therefore constitutional.2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78914, at *7-8; Oyez Project. ====Circuit court of appeals==== Patel appealed to the Ninth Circuit court, where it was heard by a three judge panel consisting of judges Harry Pregerson, Richard R. Clifton, and Carlos T. Bea. The court, in a 2-1 decision, affirmed the decision of the district court on the same grounds.686 F.3d at 1090; Oyez Project. ====En banc rehearing==== The Patels then requested that the case be reheard en banc, before a larger panel of judges in the Ninth Circuit. The en banc court found that the owners did, in fact, have a possessory interest in the registry and an expectation of privacy.738 F.3d at 1061. The fact that this was hotel property and there was a reasonable expectation of privacy placed the documents under the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.738 F.3d at 1062; Oyez Project. The court reversed on a 7-4 vote.738 F.3d at 1059. After the ruling, the City of Los Angeles filed a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court, which the Court granted on October 20, 2014.City of Los Angeles v. Patel, 135 S.

The majority opinion held that \"facial challenges under the Fourth Amendment are not categorically barred or especially disfavored,\" citing cases such as Sibron v. New York and Chandler v. Miller. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Roberts and Thomas, wrote a dissent to argue that such a warrantless search is permitted in this case because it satisfies the conditions of a regulatory scheme for a closely regulated business. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Thomas, filed a second dissent, listing five other scenarios where the law could be applied constitutionally. ==See also== * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 576 == Notes== == References == ==External links== * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law Category:2015 in United States case law Category:Hotels in Los Angeles ",
