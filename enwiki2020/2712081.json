Their name, literally meaning \"board shield barbarians\", is derived from their fighting style of charging with shields to break the enemy line. They were also called the Bohu Yi (\u767d\u864e\u5937), meaning the \"white tiger barbarians\". In the second century CE, the Bandun Man converted to the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. == See also == * Nanman Category:Ancient peoples of China Category:History of Sichuan ",
