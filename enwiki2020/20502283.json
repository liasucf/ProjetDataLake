Worcester's first Modern Orthodox \"shul\" (and 6th overall), Shaarai Torah was considered the city's \"Mother Synagogue\" for many years. ==Origins== The congregation, which was incorporated on January 1, 1904, held daily worship services for two years in a cottage they had purchased at 32 Providence Street in the heart of Worcester's east side Union Hill neighborhood, where most Jewish immigrants to Worcester lived. High Holiday services in 1904 and 1905 were held at A.O.H. (Ancient Order of Hibernians) Hall at 26 Trumbull Street while the present structure was being built. At a final cost of $30,000 ($ in current dollar terms), the new building, designed by Edwin T. Chapin in a Classical Revival style, and modeled after Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun in New York City,Kaufman, David. Shul with a pool: the \"synagogue-center\" in American Jewish history.

One of the major issues was the use of English in the synagogue.Albert B. Southwick. \"Shaarai Torah's 1906 birth is remembered.\" Telegram & Gazette 3 Oct. 1999. As early as 1907, Sons of Abraham leaders discussed implementing changes to make merging with Shaarai Torah possible. The merger finally took place in 1948. From then on, the synagogue was officially known as Congregation Shaarai Torah Sons of Abraham. ==West Side branch== Shaarai Torah WestBy 1957, roughly 74% of Worcester's 9,333 Jews lived on the tonier west side of the city, leaving less than 1,600 living on the east side.http://www.jewishdatabank.org/Archive/C-MA- Worcester-1957-Summary_Report.pdf Additionally, most west side Jews, who were generally younger and more assimilated than those who remained on the east side, attended Reform Temple Emanuel or Conservative Congregation Beth Israel as Orthodoxy fell out of favor with most upwardly mobile American Jews. On September 10, 1959, Shaarai Torah purchased the former home of Beth Israel at 835 Pleasant Street as a west side branch, naming it Shaarai Torah West. The original building became known as Shaarai Torah East. Shaarai Torah West, affiliated with the Orthodox Union, became an independent congregation on November 9, 1964 and continues to operate to this day. ==Final days== The Providence Street building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. The synagogue stopped functioning in 1996 and finally closed shortly after a devastating arson fire in 1999.James Dempsey. \"Synagogue last working on East Side Temple has haggard look of place whose time gone. \" Telegram & Gazette 22 Sep. 1999. Once one of at least 12 neighborhood Orthodox synagogues, when it closed Shaarai Torah was the last remaining functioning synagogue on the east side of Worcester. The building had been sold in 1997 to Al Tapper, a Worcester native and philanthropist who had plans to turn it into a Jewish museum or multi-ethnic community center, but those plans were scrapped after the fire.Shaun Sutner. \"Fire hits East Side synagogue Two teens charged; landmark had been set for renovation :[ALL Edition].\" Telegram & Gazette 17 Sep. 1999.

In 2003, the building was finally sold to developer Selim LaHoud who hired Kopec Contracting to convert it into 13 apartments known as Red Oak Condominiums.Bronislaus B.
