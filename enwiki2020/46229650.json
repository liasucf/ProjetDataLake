Images |- | N/A | CMN 41357 | Canadian Museum of Nature | Vagaceratops irvinensis | Campanian | Dinosaur Park Formation | Canada | A smooth depression set into a patch of wrinkly- textured bone above the right eye and the squamosal bone, probably due to advanced age. This individuals neck exhibits extensive bony growth with a \"cauliflower\" texture fusing the fifth through 9th vertebrae and their ribs. Rega, Holmes, and Tirabasso have hypothesized that this growth was a chondrosarcoma resulting from several osteochondromas occurring there. They also identified a benign osteoma in the fourth toe of the right hind foot. They also found lesions and bony growths deforming the animal's first right metacarpal. | The skull of CMN 41357. |- | N/A | ROM 843 | Royal Ontario Museum | Chasmosaurus belli | | | Canada | The skull of ROM 843 exhibits resorption of bone both near the eye-horns and on the frill, thought to be signs of aging. It also has bony growths on its fourth right metacarpal and on its eighth and ninth body ribs. However, the most important pathology are the many lesions covering the animal's thumbs. These lesions give the bone a very rough texture and deform the digits. The right thumb was the most severely deformed and is bent at a 42 degree angle, while the left thumb was bent 20 degrees away from healthy alignment. | |- | N/A | TMP 79.11.9 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Centrosaurus | | | Canada | An unidentifiable skull bone from this specimen seems to have been \"[d]iseased\". | |- | N/A | TMP 82.18.227 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Centrosaurus | | | Canada | A round exostosis formed on the shaft of this specimen's ulna. | |- | N/A | TMP 85.112.39 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | One of the rearward left dorsal ribs has a false joint. | |- | N/A | TMP 85.112.52 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | This animal seems to have broken the shaft of one of its middle ribs and a bony callus formed there. | |- | N/A | TMP 85.112.70 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | This specimen developed a stress fracture in one of its phalanges. | |- | N/A | TMP 85.112.86 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | One of this specimen's ribs had a false joint. | |- | N/A | TMP 86.55.111 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | A rounded growth of unknown origins projects from the underside of this specimen's squamosal bone. Tanke and Rothschild failed to determine its cause, but hypothesized that it might be the result of an avulsion injury. | |- | N/A | TMP 86.55.304 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | The jugal and epijugal of this specimen bear a 2 cm wide round hole, although Tanke and Rothschild have considered that this hole may have formed as a result of non-pathological processes. | |- | N/A | TMP 87.18.27 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Centrosaurus | | | Canada | One of this specimen's vertebrae is deformed. | |- | N/A | TMP 87.55.90 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | One of this animal's rear right dorsal ribs was broken twice.

One was a \"large hole\" located in below and in front of the right eye. There was also a short round growth on the left branch of the maxilla and lesions on the left squamosal. | |- | N/A | TMP 89.55.1300 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | This specimen had a bony lump on the underside of one of its rear left dorsal ribs' necks. | |- | N/A | TMP 89.55.1503 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | The horns on the rear edge of the right parietal were larger and curved in a different direction than those on the left side. Tanke and Rothschild suggested that this asymmetry may just be an anatomical idiosyncrasy of this individual animal rather than a pathology. | |- | N/A | TMP 89.55.1541 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Pachyrhinosaurus n. sp. | Campanian | Wapiti Formation | Canada | This specimen had a \"[s]mall rounded exostosis\" on its parietal. | |- | N/A | TMP 90.18.1 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Centrosaurus | | | Canada | A thin callus of bone formed on one of this specimen's ribs. | |- | N/A | TMP 91.18.18 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Centrosaurus | | | Canada | This specimen has a lesion on its left squamosal bone. | |- | N/A | TMP 91.18.30 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Centrosaurus | | | Canada | The far end of one of this specimen's phalanges is covered in pits. | |- | N/A | TMP 91.18.31 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Centrosaurus | | | Canada | One of this specimens rear dorsal ribs has a callus that formed at the site of a fracture. | |- | N/A | TMP 91.18.77 | Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology | Centrosaurus | | | Canada | One of this specimen's rear ribs has a large false joint. | |- | | | | | | | Canada | An isolated ceratopsian neck vertebra with healed fracture. | |- | | DMNH D2596 | Dalian Museum of Natural History | Psittacosaurus | Aptian | Yixian Formation | China | | |- | | JZMP-V-11 | | Psittacosaurus | | | | | |- |} ==Sauropodomorphs== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" |- !

The divot appears to be located at the origin of the deltoid or teres major muscles. Some experts have hypothesized that gout caused the formation of small patches of eroded bone discovered on Sue's first and second metacarpals. Five other pathologies have been documented in Sue; a pathology on each side of its skull, a twisted and discolored tooth, two pathological tail vertebrae in series, and a broken and healed fibula with associated abnormal bone growth. | Sue. |- |} ==Footnotes== ==References== * McWhinney, L., Carpenter, K., and Rothschild, B., 2001, Dinosaurian humeral periostitis: a case of a juxtacortical lesion in the fossil record: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D.
