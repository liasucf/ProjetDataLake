    "text": "A handshake, symbol of agreement, whose first step could have been a request for association. A Request for association (RFA) or request for collaboration, also called, though less frequently (see below) request for partnership, request for partner or request for alliance, is a commercial document issued by a party which demands association to another party. This request may be specific, with the addressee stated within, or unspecific, open to anyone interested in association. ==Characteristics== The proposed association usually has business (for example a joint venture) or voluntary sector purposes. Being on a less formal level than a letter of intent, a RFA is typically not legally binding. Instead of describing in detail the specifications of a product (as a request for quotation does), a RFA focuses on mutual benefits that both parties would obtain from their alliance: \"...engages the potential sponsor in thinking about how your project could help his or her own larger goals.\" One of the parties may provide ideas, experience or raw materials, whilst the other one may provide money, machines or workers. ==See also== * Request for quotation * Request for information * Request for proposal * Request for solution == References == Category:Procurement Category:Business terms ",
