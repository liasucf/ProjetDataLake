He was the coach of the Austrian national team at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. However, after the sensational and embarrassing 1\u20130 defeat against the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying game of UEFA Euro 1992, he decided to quit and after that coached Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf (1990\u20131992) and Austria Wien (1993\u201394). Hickersberger then worked for a few years in the Middle Eastern region, where he trained several teams, among them the Bahrain national football team, and Al Wasl FC Dubai, one of the most popular clubs in the UAE. In 2002, Hickersberger came back to Austria, and brought back success to Rapid. With him as coach, Rapid won the Austrian Championship of 2004\u201305, nine years after the last triumph, and accordingly qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage where Rapid faced the teams of Bayern Munich, Juventus and Club Brugge. He coached the Austrian national team during the UEFA Euro 2008 played in Austria and Switzerland, obtaining only one point out of nine. Austria lost 1\u20130 against Croatia and Germany, and rescued a late draw, a 1\u20131 against Poland with a goal of Ivica Vasti\u0107 on minute 93. Austria stayed in the third position in the Group B, staying out of the competition in their own country. Hickersberger and Joachim L\u00f6w were sent off in the match between Austria and Germany after claiming some errors made by Manuel Enrique Mejuto Gonz\u00e1lez. On 23 June 2008, he quit the Austrian national team post. On 10 December, he signed a contract by Al-Wahda FC (Abu Dhabi) as head coach until 30 June 2009. After finishing fourth, therefore earning a play-off berth in the Asian Champions League, and leading the team to the Etisalat Cup Final in his first year at the club, he signed a one-year extension. He also brought along two of his former national team assistant coaches, including Klaus Lindenberger. His son Thomas Hickersberger played for the Austria national football team in 2002. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"6\"|Record |- !G!!W!!D!!L!!Win % |- |align=left|Austria |align=left|1 January 1988 |align=left|14 September 1990 |- |align=left|Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf |align=left|1 January 1991 |align=left|28 August 1991 |- |align=left|Austria Wien |align=left|1 July 1993 |align=left|30 June 1994 |- |align=left|Al Ahli SC |align=left|1 July 1995 |align=left|30 June 1997 |- |align=left|Bahrain |align=left|1 January 1996 |align=left|21 December 1996 |- |align=left|El Mokawloon SC |align=left|1 July 1997 |align=left|30 June 1999 |- |align=left|Al-Shaab CSC |align=left|1 July 1999 |align=left|30 June 2000 |- |align=left|Al Wasl FC |align=left|1 July 2000 |align=left|30 June 2001 |- |align=left|Al-Gharafa Sports Club |align=left|1 July 2001 |align=left|30 June 2002 |- |align=left|Rapid Wien |align=left|1 July 2002 |align=left|21 December 2005 |- |align=left|Austria |align=left|1 January 2006 |align=left|23 June 2008 |- |align=left|Al Wahda S.C.C. |align=left|10 December 2008 |align=left|1 June 2010 |- |align=left|Bahrain |align=left|3 June 2010 |align=left|20 October 2010 |- |align=left|Al Wahda S.C.C. |align=left|22 October 2010 |align=left|31 May 2012 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total |} *1.Statistics includes league and Europe. ==Honours== ===As a player=== * Austrian Football Bundesliga: 1968\u201369, 1969\u201370, 1981\u201382 * Austrian Cup: 1968\u201369, 1970\u201371, 1978\u201379 ===As a manager=== * Austrian Cup: 1993\u201394 * Bahraini Premier League: 1995\u201396 * Qatari League: 2001\u201302 * Austrian Football Bundesliga: 2004\u201305 ==References== ==External links== * Josef Hickersberger at Austria Archive * Josef Hickersberger at Rapid Archive * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:People from Amstetten, Lower Austria Category:Austrian footballers Category:Austria international footballers Category:1978 FIFA World Cup players Category:FK Austria Wien players Category:Kickers Offenbach players Category:Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf players Category:FC Wacker Innsbruck players Category:SK Rapid Wien players Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga players Category:Bundesliga players Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Austrian football managers Category:Austria national football team managers Category:Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf managers Category:FK Austria Wien managers Category:Bahrain national football team managers Category:Al-Wasl F.C. managers Category:Al-Gharafa SC managers Category:SK Rapid Wien managers Category:1990 FIFA World Cup managers Category:UEFA Euro 2008 managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Bahrain Category:Austrian expatriate football managers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Expatriate football managers in Egypt Category:Al Mokawloon Al Arab SC managers Category:Sportspeople from Lower Austria ",
