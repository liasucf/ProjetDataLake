He was born in the affluent city of Yazd, Iran in the 1370s. He devoted much of his life to scholarship, furthering his education in Syria and Egypt until Timur's death in 1405 (1,19). As a young man, he was a teacher in his native Yazd and a close companion of the Timurid ruler Shahrukh (1405\u201347) and his son Ibrahim Sultan. In 1442/43 he became the close advisor of the governor of Iraq, Mirza Sultan Muhammad, who lived in the city of Qom. Sharif al-Din rebelled against Shahrukh Timur in 1446-1447 when the government was vulnerable, but was later commissioned to different cities for his acumen. The later years of his life were spent in Taft, where he eventually died in 1454 (Monfared 539). Yazdi was directed to write a biography of Timur in 1421 known as the Zafarnama, completing it four years later in 1425. Timur's grandson Sultan Abu al-Fath Ibrahim Mirza was patron during the completion of his grandfather's biography (Monfared 539). ==Translated works== *The History of Timur-Bec: Known by the Name of Tamerlain the Great, Emperor of the Moguls and Tartars: Being an Historical Journal of His Conquests in Asia and Europe, Volume 2 (1723) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Iranian historians Category:People from Yazd Category:1454 deaths Category:Iranian biographers Category:Male biographers Category:15th-century historians Category:Year of birth unknown Category:15th-century Iranian people ",
