Shaww\u0101l stems from the verb sh\u0101la () to 'lift or carry', generally to take or move things from one place to another, so named because a female camel normally would be carrying a fetus at this time of year. ==Fasting during Shaww\u0101l== The first day of Shaww\u0101l is Eid al-Fitr. Some Muslims observe six days of fasting during Shaww\u0101l beginning the day after Eid ul-Fitr since fasting is prohibited on this day. These six days of fasting together with the Ramadan fasts, are equivalent to fasting all year round. The reasoning behind this tradition is that a good deed in Islam is rewarded 10 times, hence fasting 30 days during Ramadan and 6 days during Shaww\u0101l is equivalent to fasting the whole year in fulfillment of the obligation. Islam online. The Shia scholars do not place any emphasis on the six days being consecutive while among the Sunnis the majority of Shafi`i scholars consider it recommended to fast these days consecutively. They based this on a hadith related by Tabarani and others wherein Muhammad is reported to have said, \"Fasting six consecutive days after Eid al-Fitr is like fasting the entire year.\" Other traditional scholarly sources among the Hanafiyya and Hanbaliyya do not place an emphasis on consecutive days, while the strongest opinion of the Malikiyya prefers any six days of the month, consecutively or otherwise. ==Timing== The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, and months begin when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. Since the Islamic lunar calendar year is 10 to 11 days shorter than the solar year, Shaww\u0101l migrates throughout the seasons.
