The soldiers of the cohort were recruited from the Asturians and Callaecans in the territory of today's Asturias and Galicia. *Equitata : partially. The unit was a mixed bandage of infantry and cavalry. The addition does not appear explicitly in any of the military diplomats, but 2 military diplomats were exhibited for riders of the cohort.John Spaul, List of the Imperial Roman Army , British Archaeological Reports 2000, BAR International Series (Book 841), p. 81 There are no references to the milliaria (1000 men), so it is assumed that the unit was a Cohors equitata. The target strength of the cohort was 600 men (480 man infantry and 120 riders) consisting of 6 centuria infantry with 80 men and 4 turmae cavalry each with 30 riders. ==History== Roman military diploma Carnuntum.The first record of the unit was in the province of Pannonia in a military diploma dating back to AD 80.
