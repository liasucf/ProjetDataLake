    "text": "The Gershonites were one of the four main divisions among the Levites in Biblical times. The Bible claims that the Gershonites were all descended from the eponymous Gershon, a son of Moses and gransdson of Levi, although some biblical scholars regard this as a postdictional metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the clan to others in the Israelite confederation. Peake's Commentary on the BibleJewish Encyclopedia The Bible ascribes a specific religious function to the Gershonites, namely care of the curtains, hangings, and ropes of the sanctuary. This differentiation of religious activity between the Gershonites and other Levites, in particular the Aaronids, is found only in the Priestly Code, and not in passages that textual scholars attribute to other authors.Cheyne and Black, Encyclopaedia Biblica According to the Book of Joshua, rather than possessing a continuous territory, the Gershonites possessed several cities scattered throughout the geographic regions of Galilee and Bashan: *in the territory of Manasseh: Golan, and Beeshterah{{https://www.biblegateway.com/resources/encyclopedia-of- the-bible/Beeshterah-Be-Eshterah *in the territory of Issachar: Kishon, Dabareh, Jarmuth, and En-gannim *in the territory of Asher: Mishal, Abdon, Helkath, and Rehob *in the territory of Naphtali: Kedesh, Hammoth-dor, and Kartan ==See also== *Kohathites *Merarites *Aaronites ==Notes and citations== Category:Hebrew Bible people Category:Levites ",
