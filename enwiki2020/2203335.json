    "text": "The Zero Page (or Base Page) is a data structure used in CP/M systems for programs to communicate with the operating system. In 8-bit CP/M versions it is located in the first 256 bytes of memory, hence its name. The equivalent structure in DOS is the Program Segment Prefix (PSP), a 256-byte structure, which, however, is by default located at offset 0 in the program's load segment (rather than in segment 0) immediately preceding a loaded program. In 8-bit CP/M, it has the following structure: {| class=\"wikitable\" !Offset !Size !Contents |- |00-02||Code||Exit program (jumps to the BIOS, and is also used to find BIOS entry points). |- |03||Byte||I/O byte, an optional feature allowing device reassignment in CP/M 2. |- |04||Byte||Current command processor drive (low 4 bits) and user number (high 4 bits). |- |05-07||Code||Jump to CP/M BDOS entry - main system call entry point. This is also the address of the first byte of memory not usable by the program. |- |08-3A||Code||8080 restart/interrupt vectors. |- |3B-4F||Bytes||Reserved |- |50||Byte||The drive from which the program was loaded (CP/M 3) |- |51-52||Word||Address of the password for the first FCB (CP/M 3) |- |53||Byte||Length of the password for the first FCB (CP/M 3) |- |54-55||Word||Address of the password for the second FCB (CP/M 3) |- |56||Byte||Length of the password for the second FCB (CP/M 3) |- |57-5B||Bytes||Reserved |- |5C-6B||||Default FCB 1 |- |6C-7F||||Default FCB 2 (overwritten if FCB 1 is opened) |- |80||Byte||Number of characters in command tail. |- |81-FF||Bytes||Command tail (everything after the program name). |} In CP/M-86, the structure is: {| class=\"wikitable\" !Offset !Size !Contents |- |00-02||Bytes||Length of code group in bytes |- |03-04||Word||Segment address of code group |- |05||Byte||8080 model flag - set if program only has one segment |- |06-08||Bytes||Length of data group in bytes |- |09-0A||Word||Segment address of data group |- |0B||Byte||Reserved |- |0C-11||||Descriptor for extra group - same format as for data |- |12-17||||Descriptor for stack group |- |18-1D||||Descriptor for X1 group |- |1E-23||||Descriptor for X2 group |- |24-29||||Descriptor for X3 group |- |2A-2F||||Descriptor for X4 group |- |30-4F||Bytes||Reserved |- |50||Byte||The drive from which the program was loaded (CP/M 3) |- |51-52||Word||Address of the password for the first FCB (CP/M 3) |- |53||Byte||Length of the password for the first FCB (CP/M 3) |- |54-55||Word||Address of the password for the second FCB (CP/M 3) |- |56||Byte||Length of the password for the second FCB (CP/M 3) |- |57-5B||Bytes||Reserved |- |5C-6B||||Default FCB 1 |- |6C-7F||||Default FCB 2 (overwritten if FCB 1 is opened) |- |80||Byte||Number of characters in command tail. |- |81-FF||Bytes||Command tail (everything after the program name). |} ==See also== * Zero page (processor property) * Page boundary relocation ==References== * - in particular: ** ** ==External links== * - In-depth description of CP/M zero page functions Category:CP/M technology ",
