He worked on stage, television and film. ==Early life and career== Ashby was born as Rashid Suhrawardy to Pakistani (Bengali) politician Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, who served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan, and a Russian mother of Polish descent, actress Vera Alexandrovna Tiscenko Calder. He received his early education at Charterhouse School and graduated from the University of Oxford. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and later joined the Royal Shakespeare Company. Described by Pakistan Today as \"the quintessential theatre actor\", on screen he was known for playing Jawaharlal Nehru in the film Jinnah (1998) and a Doctor Who villain, the Borad, in the serial Timelash (1985). ==Politics== In politics, Ashby was deeply committed to the people of Bangladesh. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, he was very vocal and, as a result of that, he had a strained relationship with his sisters and others in Karachi. He was invited to join politics in Bangladesh but declined, citing his language issues and saying that \"he was not as great as his father\". However, he headed Awami League's election steering committee in 1996. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed her \"profound shock and sorrow\" at the news of his death. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1940 births Category:2019 deaths Category:20th-century British actors Category:20th-century British writers Category:Alumni of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:British people of Bengali descent Category:British people of Pakistani descent Category:British people of Polish descent Category:British people of Russian descent Category:Children of Prime Ministers of Pakistan Category:People educated at Charterhouse School Category:Suhrawardy family ",
