    "text": "In mathematics, the Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem (also written as the Cauchy\u2013Kowalevski theorem) is the main local existence and uniqueness theorem for analytic partial differential equations associated with Cauchy initial value problems. A special case was proven by , and the full result by . ==First order Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem== This theorem is about the existence of solutions to a system of m differential equations in n dimensions when the coefficients are analytic functions. The theorem and its proof are valid for analytic functions of either real or complex variables. Let K denote either the fields of real or complex numbers, and let V = Km and W = Kn. Let A1, ..., An\u22121 be analytic functions defined on some neighbourhood of (0, 0) in W \u00d7 V and taking values in the m \u00d7 m matrices, and let b be an analytic function with values in V defined on the same neighbourhood. Then there is a neighbourhood of 0 in W on which the quasilinear Cauchy problem : \\partial_{x_n}f = A_1(x,f) \\partial_{x_1} f + \\cdots + A_{n-1}(x,f)\\partial_{x_{n-1}}f + b(x,f) with initial condition : f(x) = 0 on the hypersurface : x_n = 0 has a unique analytic solution \u0192 : W \u2192 V near 0\\. Lewy's example shows that the theorem is not valid for all smooth functions. The theorem can also be stated in abstract (real or complex) vector spaces. Let V and W be finite-dimensional real or complex vector spaces, with n = dim W. Let A1, ..., An\u22121 be analytic functions with values in End (V) and b an analytic function with values in V, defined on some neighbourhood of (0, 0) in W \u00d7 V. In this case, the same result holds. ==Proof by analytic majorization== Both sides of the partial differential equation can be expanded as formal power series and give recurrence relations for the coefficients of the formal power series for f that uniquely determine the coefficients. The Taylor series coefficients of the Ai's and b are majorized in matrix and vector norm by a simple scalar rational analytic function. The corresponding scalar Cauchy problem involving this function instead of the Ai's and b has an explicit local analytic solution. The absolute values of its coefficients majorize the norms of those of the original problem; so the formal power series solution must converge where the scalar solution converges. ==Higher-order Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem== If F and fj are analytic functions near 0, then the non-linear Cauchy problem : \\partial_t^k h = F\\left(x,t,\\partial_t^j\\,\\partial_x^\\alpha h \\right),\\text{ where }j with initial conditions : \\partial_t^j h(x,0) = f_j(x),\\qquad 0\\le j has a unique analytic solution near 0. This follows from the first order problem by considering the derivatives of h appearing on the right hand side as components of a vector-valued function. ===Example=== The heat equation : \\partial_t h = \\partial_x^2 h with the condition :h(0,x) = {1\\over 1+x^2}\\text{ for }t = 0 has a unique formal power series solution (expanded around (0, 0)). However this formal power series does not converge for any non-zero values of t, so there are no analytic solutions in a neighborhood of the origin. This shows that the condition |\u03b1| + j \u2264 k above cannot be dropped. (This example is due to Kowalevski.) ==Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya\u2013Kashiwara theorem== There is a wide generalization of the Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem for systems of linear partial differential equations with analytic coefficients, the Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya\u2013Kashiwara theorem, due to . This theorem involves a cohomological formulation, presented in the language of D-modules. The existence condition involves a compatibility condition among the non homogeneous parts of each equation and the vanishing of a derived functor Ext^1. ===Example=== Let n\\le m. Set Y=\\\\{ x_1=\\cdots=x_n \\\\}. The system \\partial_{x_i} f=g_i, i=1,\\ldots,n, has a solution f\\in \\mathbb C \\\\{ x_1,\\ldots,x_m\\\\} if and only if the compatibility conditions \\partial_{x_i}g_j=\\partial_{x_j}g_i are verified. In order to have a unique solution we must include an initial condition f|_Y=h, where h\\in \\mathbb C \\\\{ x_{n+1},\\ldots,x_m\\\\}. ==References== * Reprinted in Oeuvres completes, 1 serie, Tome VII, pages 17\u201358. * * (linear case) * * (German spelling of her surname used at that time.) * ==External links== *PlanetMath Category:Augustin-Louis Cauchy Category:Partial differential equations Category:Theorems in analysis Category:Uniqueness theorems ",
