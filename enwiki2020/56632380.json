She competed in the two-woman event at the 2018 Winter Olympics and won the gold medal. ==Career== Buckwitz started off as a heptathlete. Buckwitz took up bobsleigh in 2013, and trains at the club. She won two junior championships. In 2015, Buckwitz and Cathleen Martini won the two-woman Bobsleigh World Cup event in K\u00f6nigssee. In 2016, Buckwitz and Stephanie Schneider won a bronze medal in the two-woman at the Bobsleigh European Championship, and came fourth in the two-woman event at the IBSF World Championships in Igls, Austria. In 2017, Buckwitz, Christopher Grotheer, Stephanie Schneider, Tina Hermann, Nico Walther and Philipp Wobeto won the silver medal in the mixed team event at the IBSF World Championships in K\u00f6nigssee. They finished behind another German team. At the beginning of the 2017-18 season, German bobsleigh coach Ren\u00e9 Spies paired Buckwitz with Mariama Jamanka. The pair were nicknamed the \"Berlin Bob\", as Buckwitz and Jamanka are both from Berlin. Buckwitz and Jamanka won a silver medal at the 2018 Bobsleigh European Championships. At the 2018 Winter Olympics, Buckwitz and Jamanka competed in the two-woman event and won the gold medal. The win was unexpected, as the other German bobsleigh, containing Stephanie Schneider and Annika Drazek, was the favourite to win. German teams won all three of the bobsleigh events at the Games. As a result of her Olympic win, Buckwitz was awarded the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), and was voted Brandenburg's Sportswoman of the Year. Buckwitz and Jamanka won the opening race of the 2018\u20132019 Bobsleigh World Cup in Sigulda, Latvia.
