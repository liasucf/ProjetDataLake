    "text": "Havering Sixth Form College (alternatively styled Havering VI Form College), abbreviated as HSFC, is a sixth form college in Wingletye Lane, Hornchurch in the London Borough of Havering, East London, England. Built on the site of Dury Falls Secondary School, it opened in September 1991, and educates full- time students from the ages of 16 to 19. The college offers a wide range of subjects, in A-level, BTEC and diploma formats, amongst others. The current principal is Paul Wakeling. ==Courses== The college offers many programmes of study for students of different abilities and talents. Qualifications offered include: * AS level (Level 3) * A level (Level 3) * BTEC (Level 2, Level 3, Level 4 Art) * GCSE (Level 2) * ILEX (Level 2) In addition to these, students are required to take at least one enrichment course in their first year. Whilst not a qualification in itself, this fills the student\u2019s timetable and gives them the opportunity to explore their interests. Most Upper Sixth students are also required to take General Studies. The International Baccalaureate formally used to offered however, now that is no longer the case. ===Enrichment courses=== The college offers a range of complementary enrichment course for students to study alongside their chosen qualifications. Many of these courses integrate a Key Skills in Communications qualification, which is necessary for those who achieved a grade C or below in English at GCSE level. If the student's chosen enrichment course does not incorporate Key Skills, then the student must study this subject separately in order to obtain a Key Skills qualification. In recent years, the college has made it compulsory for students to receive a qualification equal to a Level 2 ICT qualification, and Level 2 Communications. However, these will not be necessary if these qualifications have already been received in any form of previous education in a way that deems it irrelevant to study them at the college. ==Buildings== The college is divided into nine main buildings, or blocks: * Library Wing (ICT, computing, history, politics, health and social care) * Science Wing (sciences) * Theatre Wing (performing arts, music) * Dury Falls Wing (business studies, economics, law) * Newcourt (sociology, psychology, mathematics, law) * Gatehouse (English, classical civilization, languages) * Minster Court (art, graphics, photography, product design, media) * Horsa Building (art, dance) * International Building (geography, religious studies, philosophy, archaeology) * Berners-Lee House (ICT, computing) * Olympia House (Travel and Tourism) ==Facilities== *Large athletics hall *Completely furbished gym, complete with all manner of exercise machines *Fully equipped theatre space, with lighting, sound and recording facilities *Numerous sound-proof recording studios *Comprehensive library, with internet capabilities ==College Council== The views of the student body are voiced through the College Council, which is made up of at least one representative per tutor group, as well as members of subcommittees including the Executive, Catering, Environmental, Charity and Social committees. The full council meets every half term to get feedback from each committee and discuss/vote upon issues that the representatives bring from their tutor group members. ==Notable alumni== * Michael Adebolajo Islamic terrorist convicted of the Murder of Lee Rigby * Tim Aker, Politician and MEP * Alex Day, Musician * Eddie Hearn, Sports Promoter * Mark Hunter, Olympic Gold Medalist * Sally Oliver, Actress ==References== ==External links== *Official website * Category:Education in the London Borough of Havering Category:Sixth form colleges in London Category:Hornchurch Category:1991 establishments in England ",
