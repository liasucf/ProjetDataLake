    "text": "The Bell House is a historic house at 302 West Woodruff Avenue in Searcy, Arkansas. It is a single-story brick structure, with an irregular roofline. A porch, headed by a side gable entrance projects to the right, continuing across the front to meet a small front-gable projecting in front of a higher front-facing gable roof. The porch is supported by high brick piers topped by short wooden posts. Built in 1915, it is a fine local example of Craftsman architecture. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in White County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1925 Category:Houses in Searcy, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Searcy, Arkansas ",
