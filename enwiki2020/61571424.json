However, Gr\u00eamio, Internacional and Juventude, that, due to disputing the national divisions, had even more matches to play in the year than the others, came to December multiple matches behind, with only 17 days left until the end of the season. As a consequence, Juventude on two occasions had to play twice on the same day, and Gr\u00eamio at one point had to play three matches in one day. The length of the championship led it to be dubbed the \"Intermin\u00e1vel\" (Neverending) by the press. ==References== Category:Campeonato Ga\u00facho seasons Ga\u00facho ",
