    "text": "Xu Shao (150\u2013195), courtesy name Zijiang, was a government official, commentator, and character evaluator who lived in the Eastern Han dynasty. ==Early life and career== Xu Shao was from Pingyu County (\u5e73\u8f3f\u7e23), Runan Commandery (\u6c5d\u5357\u90e1), which is present-day Pingyu County, Henan. As a youth, he maintained a good reputation and had a keen interest in the study of human relations. He was known for appraising people. His fame put him on par with others such as Fan Zizhao (\u6a0a\u5b50\u662d) and He Yangshi (\u548c\u967d\u58eb). Xu Shao and Guo Tai (\u90ed\u6cf0) were famous character evaluators at the time and their appraisals were highly valued among scholar- officials.(\u8a31\u52ad\u5b57\u5b50\u5c07\uff0c\u6c5d\u5357\u5e73\u8f3f\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002\u5c11\u5cfb\u540d\u7bc0\uff0c\u597d\u4eba\u502b\uff0c\u591a\u6240\u8cde\u8b58\u3002\u82e5\u6a0a\u5b50\u662d\u3001\u548c\u967d\u58eb\u8005\uff0c\u4e26\u986f\u540d\u65bc\u4e16\u3002\u6545\u5929\u4e0b\u8a00\u62d4\u58eb\u8005\uff0c\u54b8\u7a31\u8a31\u3001\u90ed\u3002) Houhanshu vol. 68. Xu Shao started his civil career as an Officer of Merit (\u529f\u66f9) in his home commandery. Xu Qiu (\u5f90\u7486), the commandery administrator, treated him very respectfully. The other officials in the commandery office became more cautious and conservative in their manners when they heard that Xu Shao was going to be their colleague. When Yuan Shao was on his way home to Runan County after resigning from his post of Prefect (\u4ee4) of Puyang County, he rode in a carriage and was surrounded by many guards and attendants. Before entering Runan, he ordered his men to leave, saying, \"How can I let Xu Zijiang see me like this?\" He then travelled home in a single carriage.(\u521d\u70ba\u90e1\u529f\u66f9\uff0c\u592a\u5b88\u5f90\u7486\u751a\u656c\u4e4b\u3002\u5e9c\u4e2d\u805e\u5b50\u5c07\u70ba\u540f\uff0c\u83ab\u4e0d\u6539\u64cd\u98fe\u884c\u3002\u540c\u90e1\u8881\u7d39\uff0c\u516c\u65cf\u8c6a\u4fe0\uff0c\u53bb\u6fee\u967d\u4ee4\u6b78\uff0c\u8eca\u5f92\u751a\u76db\uff0c\u5c07\u5165\u90e1\u754c\uff0c\u4e43\u8b1d\u9063\u8cd4\u5ba2\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u543e\u8f3f\u670d\u8c48\u53ef\u4f7f\u8a31\u5b50\u5c07\u898b\u3002\u300d\u9042\u4ee5\u55ae\u8eca\u6b78\u5bb6\u3002) Houhanshu vol. 68. ==Appraisals of Chen Shi and Chen Fan== When Xu Shao went to Yingchuan Commandery (\u6f41\u5ddd\u90e1; covering present-day southern and central Henan), he visited and mingled with many reputable men in the region, except for Chen Shi. Later, when Chen Fan's wife died, many people attended her funeral but Xu Shao did not show up. When asked, Xu Shao replied, \"Taiqiu (Chen Shi) is too well-acquainted, it's difficult for him to be thorough; Zhongju (Chen Fan) is a serious person who hardly makes compromises. These are the reasons why I didn't visit them.\"(\u52ad\u751e\u5230\u6f41\u5ddd\uff0c\u591a\u9577\u8005\u4e4b\u904a\uff0c\u552f\u4e0d\u5019\u9673\u5bd4\u3002\u53c8\u9673\u8543\u55aa\u59bb\u9084\u846c\uff0c\u90f7\u4eba\u7562\u81f3\uff0c\u800c\u52ad\u7368\u4e0d\u5f80\u3002\u6216\u554f\u5176\u6545\uff0c\u52ad\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u592a\u4e18\u9053\u5ee3\uff0c\u5ee3\u5247\u96e3\u5468\uff1b\u4ef2\u8209\u6027\u5cfb\uff0c\u5cfb\u5247\u5c11\u901a\u3002\u6545\u4e0d\u9020\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u5176\u591a\u6240\u88c1\u91cf\u82e5\u6b64\u3002) Houhanshu vol. 68. ==Appraisal of Cao Cao== When Cao Cao was still relatively unknown, he prepared expensive gifts and behaved humbly when he visited Xu Shao in the hope of receiving an appraisal. Xu Shao viewed Cao Cao with contempt and refused to evaluate him, but Cao later found an opportunity to threaten and coerce Xu into giving comments about him. Xu Shao said, \"You're a treacherous villain in times of peace and a hero in times of chaos.\" Cao Cao was very pleased and he left.(\u66f9\u64cd\u5fae\u6642\uff0c\u5e38\u5351\u8fad\u539a\u79ae\uff0c\u6c42\u70ba\u5df1\u76ee\u3002\u52ad\u9119\u5176\u4eba\u800c\u4e0d\u80af\u5c0d\uff0c\u64cd\u4e43\u4f3a\u9699\u8105\u52ad\uff0c\u52ad\u4e0d\u5f97\u5df2\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u541b\u6e05\u5e73\u4e4b\u59e6\u8cca\uff0c\u4e82\u4e16\u4e4b\u82f1\u96c4\u3002\u300d\u64cd\u5927\u6071\u800c\u53bb\u3002) Houhanshu vol. 68. However, Sun Sheng's Yitong Zayu (\u7570\u540c\u96dc\u8a9e) recorded a different quote from Xu Shao. It mentioned that when Cao Cao asked Xu Shao to give him an appraisal, Xu initially refused but eventually relented and said, \"You'll be a capable minister in times of peace, and a jianxiong in times of chaos.\" Cao Cao laughed when he heard that.(\u751e\u554f\u8a31\u5b50\u5c07\uff1a\u300c\u6211\u4f55\u5982\u4eba\uff1f\u300d\u5b50\u5c07\u4e0d\u8345\u3002\u56fa\u554f\u4e4b\uff0c\u5b50\u5c07\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5b50\u6cbb\u4e16\u4e4b\u80fd\u81e3\uff0c\u4e82\u4e16\u4e4b\u59e6\u96c4\u3002\u300d\u592a\u7956\u5927\u7b11\u3002) Yitong Zayu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 1. ==Relationships with others== Xu Shao's granduncle was Xu Jing (\u8a31\u656c). Xu Jing's son was Xu Xun (\u8a31\u8a13). Xu Xun's son, Xu Xiang (\u8a31\u76f8), became one of the Three Ducal Ministers by flattering the court eunuchs. Xu Xiang invited Xu Shao to meet him numerous times, but Xu Shao despised him for being a sycophant and refused to see him.(\u52ad\u5f9e\u7956\u656c\uff0c\u656c\u5b50\u8a13\uff0c\u8a13\u5b50\u76f8\uff0c\u4e26\u70ba\u4e09\u516c\uff0c\u76f8\u4ee5\u80fd\u8ac2\u4e8b\u5ba6\u5b98\uff0c\u6545\u81ea\u81f4\u53f0\u53f8\u5c01\u4faf\uff0c\u6578\u9063\u8acb\u52ad\u3002\u52ad\u60e1\u5176\u8584\u884c\uff0c\u7d42\u4e0d\u5019\u4e4b\u3002) Houhanshu vol. 68. Xu Shao was initially on good terms with Li Kui (\u674e\u9035), who was from the same hometown as him and was known for his good moral conduct, but relations between them soured later. Xu Shao also could not get along with his cousin Xu Jing (\u8a31\u9756). These two incidents caused some damage to Xu Shao's reputation. Before falling out with each other, Xu Shao and his cousin Xu Jing were famous commentators and they would give comments on certain persons or topics on the first day of every month.(\u52ad\u9091\u4eba\u674e\u9035\uff0c\u58ef\u76f4\u6709\u9ad8\u6c23\uff0c\u52ad\u521d\u5584\u4e4b\uff0c\u800c\u5f8c\u70ba\u9699\uff0c\u53c8\u8207\u5f9e\u5144\u9756\u4e0d\u7766\uff0c\u6642\u8b70\u4ee5\u6b64\u5c11\u4e4b\u3002\u521d\uff0c\u52ad\u8207\u9756\u4ff1\u6709\u9ad8\u540d\uff0c\u597d\u5171\u8988\u8ad6\u90f7\u9ee8\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u6bcf\u6708\u8f12\u66f4\u5176\u54c1\u984c\uff0c\u6545\u6c5d\u5357\u4fd7\u6709\u300c\u6708\u65e6\u8a55\u300d\u7109\u3002) Houhanshu vol. 68. ==Later life and death== Yang Biao (\u694a\u5f6a), the Excellency of Works (\u53f8\u7a7a; one of the Three Ducal Ministers), once attempted to recruit Xu Shao to serve in his office but the latter refused. Later, when the Han imperial court wanted to recruit Xu Shao again, he declined, \"Villains are rampant. The political scene is about to become chaotic. I intend to seek refuge in Huaihai (\u6dee\u6d77) and keep my family safe.\" He then moved south to Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675; around present-day Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Tao Qian, the Inspector (\u523a\u53f2) of Xu Province, treated Xu Shao generously, but Xu felt uneasy and he told others, \"Tao Gongzu (Tao Qian) appears to enjoy a good reputation but he is actually not sincere and faithful on the inside. He may treat me very well but his attitude towards me will worsen later. I'd better leave.\" He then headed further south to Qu'e County (\u66f2\u963f\u7e23; present-day Danyang, Jiangsu), where he joined Liu Yao, the Inspector of Yang Province. Later, as Xu Shao predicted, Tao Qian arrested all his reputable guests.(\u53f8\u7a7a\u694a\u5f6a\u8f9f\uff0c\u8209\u65b9\u6b63\u3001\u6566\u6a38\uff0c\u5fb5\uff0c\u7686\u4e0d\u5c31\u3002\u6216\u52f8\u52ad\u4ed5\uff0c\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u65b9\u4eca\u5c0f\u4eba\u9053\u9577\uff0c\u738b\u5ba4\u5c07\u4e82\uff0c\u543e\u6b32\u907f\u5730\u6dee\u6d77\uff0c\u4ee5\u5168\u8001\u5e7c\u3002\u300d\u4e43\u5357\u5230\u5ee3\u9675\u3002 ... \u5f90\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u9676\u8b19\u79ae\u4e4b\u751a\u539a\u3002\u52ad\u4e0d\u81ea\u5b89\uff0c\u544a\u5176\u5f92\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u9676\u606d\u7956\u5916\u6155\u8072\u540d\uff0c\u5167\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u3002\u5f85\u543e\u96d6\u539a\uff0c\u5176\u57f6\u5fc5\u8584\u3002\u4e0d\u5982\u53bb\u4e4b\u3002\u300d\u9042\u5fa9\u6295\u63da\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u5289\u7e47\u65bc\u66f2\u963f\u3002\u5176\u5f8c\u9676\u8b19\u679c\u6355\u8af8\u5bd3\u58eb\u3002) Houhanshu vol. 68. When Sun Ce was on a series of conquests in the Wu region, Xu Shao and Liu Yao fled south to Yuzhang Commandery (\u8c6b\u7ae0\u90e1; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). Xu Shao died there at the age of 46 (by East Asian age reckoning).(\u53ca\u5b6b\u7b56\u5e73\u5433\uff0c\u52ad\u8207\u7e47\u5357\u5954\u8c6b\u7ae0\u800c\u5352\uff0c\u6642\u5e74\u56db\u5341\u516d\u3002) Houhanshu vol. 68. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==Notes== ==References== * Fan, Ye (5th century).
