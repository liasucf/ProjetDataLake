    "text": "Hokowhitu Lagoon, also sometimes called Centennial Lagoon, is a natural ox-bow lake in the city of Palmerston North, New Zealand. Hokowhitu was created from a meander of the Manawatu River. Many features surround the lagoon including a walkway, a Massey University campus and the Caccia Birch House. Hokowhitu gives its name to a residential area within Palmerston North. An artesian bore, which was completed in 2009, is drilled into an underground aquifer which supplies the lagoon with 250,000 litres of water daily. ==Features== Hokowhitu Lagoon is home to many water-life and birds. Perch is the most common fish in the lagoon, with 44 fish per 100m2. A walk follows the shore of the lagoon and is popular with local leisure seekers. The walk includes a truss bridge which crosses the lagoon at roughly its halfway mark. The Caccia Birch House, a Category I Historic location, sits on the northern side of the lagoon. The house was built in 1892 and was donated to the government in 1941. ==Diminishing water levels== During 2014 the lagoon's water levels dropped as the 2014 Eketahuna earthquake opened up channels in the underside of the lake. The leaking continued and in December 2014 environmentally-safe dye was put into the water to help locate leaks. The Artesian Bore, which was built in 2009, cannot compete with the heavy leaking. During mid-2016 a dive team was sent to investigate the lagoon bed to locate a source of the leaking. ==See also== *Hokowhitu *Water in New Zealand ==References== Category:Palmerston North Category:Lakes of Manawat\u016b-Whanganui ",
