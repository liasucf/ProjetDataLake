    "text": "Entergy New Orleans, formerly New Orleans Public Service Incorporated (NOPSI), is an electric and natural gas utility and former mass transit provider that was based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The various streetcar lines of New Orleans were consolidated under NOPSI's control in 1922. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, NOPSI converted all the original streetcar lines in New Orleans, except for the St. Charles Streetcar Line, to bus service. In 1983, control of the system's mass transit was transferred to a public agency, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority. NOPSI later became Entergy New Orleans, a subsidiary of Entergy. ==External links== * Category:Companies based in New Orleans Category:Transportation in New Orleans Category:Bus transportation in Louisiana Category:Passenger rail transportation in Louisiana Category:Electric power companies of the United States Category:Natural gas companies of the United States Category:Entergy ",
