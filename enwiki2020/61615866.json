    "text": "This article outlines the delivered and predicted impact of Brexit, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU). Some effects of Brexit depend on the negotiated withdrawal agreement. Other effects depend on the trade deal to be negotiated during the transition period after withdrawal, or whether the transition period ends before an agreement is ratified (a \"no-deal\" Brexit).\"What is a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit?\" Brexit effect can impact entities inside the UK, or have effect on Gibraltar, to impact the European Union and impact third countries. It is also likely to have an impact on the Irish border. == Academia == According to a 2016 study by Ken Mayhew, Emeritus Professor of Education and Economic Performance at Oxford University, Brexit posed the following threats to higher education: \"loss of research funding from EU sources; loss of students from other EU member states; the impact on the ability of the sector to hire academic staff from EU member states; and the impact on the ability of UK students to study abroad.\" The UK received more from the European agencies and institutions for research than it financially contributedBetween 2007 and 2013 the UK received \u20ac8.8 billion from the EU for research while contributing \u20ac5.4 billion to the EU's research budget. with universities getting just over 10% of their research income from the European agencies and institutions.Around 11% of the research income of British universities came from the EU in 2014\u20132015 All funding for net beneficiaries from European agencies and institutions, including universities, was guaranteed by the British government in August 2016. Before the funding announcement, a newspaper investigation reported that some research projects were reluctant to include British researchers due to uncertainties over funding. Currently the UK is part of the European Research Area and the UK is likely to wish to remain an associated member.\"It is likely that the UK would wish to remain an associated member of the European Research Area, like Norway and Iceland, in order to continue participating in the EU framework programmes.\" == Blue passport == Since March 2020, blue passports are issued by United-Kingdom while European Union keeps burgundy passports. The Home Office have said that the blue Brexit passport is seen as \"the greenest British passport ever\" and that \"the carbon footprint from manufacture is limited to zero by including projects for planting trees.\" The Home Office also said that the blue passport includes security features, such as a \"hard- wearing, super-strength polycarbonate data page\", with embedded technologies to secure personal data. The blue passport has been controversial. Home Secretary Priti Patel said \"leaving the European Union gave us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path in the world\" and \"by returning to the iconic blue and gold design, the British passport will once again be entwined with our national identity\". Patron of the European Movement and former MEP Edward McMillan-Scott said the passport would be seen as offensive to many Europeans and that \"it will be seen as a symbol of the attitude prevailing in the Conservative party towards the rest of Europe that is isolationist, ignorant and self-destructive\". ==Borders and customs== === Border between the UK and Ireland === The UK\u2013Ireland border crosses this road at Killeen (near Newry), marked only by a speed limit in km/h. (Northern Ireland uses mph.) The United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland have been part of the Common Travel Area since before the EU was formed. This allows their citizens freedom of movement within the area, with only passport checks at airports and seaports. Their membership of the EU Customs Union and Single Market means there are no customs checks or tariffs. Since 2005, the border has been essentially invisible. After Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU) will become the only UK\u2013EU land border. There was concern over this becoming a \"hard border\" with fewer, controlled crossing points and customs checks. This could have compromised the Good Friday Agreement that ended the Northern Ireland conflict,Brexit: the unexpected threat to peace in Northern Ireland Nic Robertson, CNN, 6 April 2018George Mitchell: UK and Ireland need to realise what's at stake in Brexit talks. Belfast Telegraph, 8 April 2018Brexit threatens Good Friday agreement, Irish PM warns. David Smith, The Guardian, 14 March 2018 and lead to violence. All involved parties agreed a hard border should be avoided. To forestall this, the EU proposed a \"backstop agreement\" (the Northern Ireland Protocol) that would have kept the UK in the Customs Union and kept Northern Ireland in some aspects of the Single Market also, until a lasting solution was found. The backstop was supported by the Irish government and many Irish nationalists, but opposed by many Ulster unionists and Conservatives. They say it would have undermined the UK's territorial integrity, prevented it making its own trade deals, and fear it could have kept the UK (or part of it) under EU rules indefinitely. The backstop was part of the Withdrawal Agreement, but the UK parliament overwhelmingly voted down the agreement. The original proposal was for Northern Ireland alone to remain in the EU Single Market and Customs Union. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) opposed this, believing it threatened the unity of the UK. Theresa May then agreed to keep the whole UK in the Customs Union, should it come into effect. When Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, he promised to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement and replace it with \"alternative arrangements\". In October 2019, the UK government and EU agreed on new arrangements for Northern Ireland in a revised withdrawal agreement. If there were a no-deal Brexit, the UK government announced that it would not have performed customs checks at the Irish border and acknowledged that might have presented a smuggling risk. European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, said if there was a no-deal Brexit the Republic of Ireland would have had to implement border checks on the EU's behalf.\"Jean-Claude Juncker: Border is coming in no- deal Brexit - but blame Britain, not EU\". Irish Independent. 23 September 2019. In 2019, the President of Ireland signed into law the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act, to help deal with challenges a no-deal Brexit posed to the Republic and its citizens.\"Emergency Brexit law passes Oireachtas with cross-party support\". The Irish Times. 14 March 2019.\"Which areas are covered in Brexit Omnibus Bill?\". RT\u00c9 News. 22 February 2019. According to Gove, Irish border will not have customs officers saying \u2018halt\u2019.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/12/government- spend-700m-readying-uk-border-brexit === Border with France === The French and British governments say they remain committed to the Le Touquet Agreement, which lets UK border checks be completed in France, and vice versa (juxtaposed controls).\"Calais migrants: UK and France sign new treaty\". BBC News. 19 January 2018. The two governments signed the Sandhurst Treaty in January 2018, which will shorten the time taken to process migrants attempting to reach the UK from Calais, from six months to one month. The UK also announced it will invest a further \u00a344.5 million on border security at the English Channel. If there had been a \"no-deal\" Brexit, trade between the UK and France would have defaulted to World Trade Organization rules. To ensure the smooth flow of freight, France created a new \"smart border\" which will scan trucks' licence plates and automatically link them to shipping documents filled out online by exporters. Trucks travelling to Britain will either be waved through, or undergo checks if they carry food, plants or livestock. G\u00e9rald Darmanin, French Minister of Public Action and Accounts, said there would not be long queues in Calais.\"France starts Brexit trial in northern port of Calais\". Radio France Internationale. 30 August 2019. France is spending \u20ac50 million on expanding port infrastructure and plans to recruit 700 more customs staff by the end of 2020.\"Brexit: What are EU countries doing to prepare for no deal?\". BBC News. 4 September 2019. === Customs between EU and UK=== At the end of the transition period, Michael Gove suggests all EU imports will be subject to checks due to inevitable border checks, which might be considered as a significant change.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/10/checks-on- eu-bound-goods-inevitable-gove-tells-business-leaders Those checks should include food and goods of animal origin, and also customs declarations and mandatory safety and security certificates, for products imported from the EU to the UK. Those issues could be solved in five years from 2021 to 2025, by replacing operational border by best border. With Brexit, deferred VAT payments will no longer exist. Avoiding border would be a breach to the prime minister mandate at the general election to affirm England departure. The Freight Transport Association's UK policy director considers that such a \"make do and mend\" (from latin mendicare) approach is rather realistic but costly. The UK alone spend \u00a3700m for Brexit borders with the EU minus Ireland for 500 custom workers and control postswhen UK leaves the single market at the end off the transition period in 2021. This is \u00a3235m for custom workers and IT systems and \u00a3470m for port and inland infrastructure. == Economic effects == Economists expect that Brexit will have damaging immediate and longer-term effects on the economies of the UK and at least part of the 27 other EU member states. In particular, there is a broad consensus among economists and in the economic literature that Brexit will likely reduce the UK's real per capita income in the medium and long term, and that the Brexit referendum itself damaged the economy. Studies on effects since the referendum show a reduction in GDP, trade and investment, as well as household losses from increased inflation. === Immediate === According to one study, the referendum result had pushed up UK inflation by 1.7 percentage points in 2017, leading to an annual cost of \u00a3404 for the average British household. Subsequent data shows that the Brexit referendum pushed up UK inflation by 2.9%, which amounts to annual costs of \u00a3870 for the average UK household. Studies published in 2018, estimated that the economic costs of the Brexit vote were 2.1% of GDP, or 2.5% of GDP. According to a December 2017 Financial Times analysis, the Brexit referendum results had reduced national British income by between 0.6% and 1.3%. A 2018 analysis by Stanford University and Nottingham University economists estimated that uncertainty around Brexit reduced investment by businesses by approximately 6 percentage points and caused an employment reduction of 1.5 percentage points. A number of studies found that Brexit- induced uncertainty about the UK's future trade policy reduced British international trade from June 2016 onwards. A 2019 analysis found that British firms substantially increased offshoring to the European Union after the Brexit referendum, whereas European firms reduced new investments in the UK. === In the long term === There is overwhelming or near-unanimous agreement among economists that leaving the European Union will adversely affect the British economy in the medium- and long-term. Surveys of economists in 2016 showed overwhelming agreement that Brexit would likely reduce the UK's real per-capita income level. 2019 and 2017 surveys of existing academic research found that the credible estimates ranged between GDP losses of 1.2\u20134.5% for the UK, and a cost of between 1\u201310% of the UK's income per capita. These estimates differ depending on whether the UK exits the EU with a hard Brexit or soft Brexit. In January 2018, the UK government's own Brexit analysis was leaked; it showed that UK economic growth would be stunted by 2\u20138% in total over the 15 years following Brexit, the amount depending on the leave scenario. According to most economists, EU membership has a strong positive effect on trade and as a result the UK's trade would be worse off if it left the EU. According to a study by University of Cambridge economists, under a \"hard Brexit\" whereby the UK reverts to WTO rules, one-third of UK exports to the EU would be tariff-free, one-quarter would face high trade barriers and other exports risk tariffs in the range of 1\u201310%. A 2017 study found that \"almost all UK regions are systematically more vulnerable to Brexit than regions in any other country.\" A 2017 study examining the economic impact of Brexit-induced reductions in migration\" found that there would likely be \"a significant negative impact on UK GDP per capita (and GDP), with marginal positive impacts on wages in the low-skill service sector.\" It is unclear how changes in trade and foreign investment will interact with immigration, but these changes are likely to be important. With Brexit, the EU would lose its second-largest economy, the country with the third-largest population and \"the financial capital of the world\", as the German newspaper M\u00fcnchner Merkur put it. Population is reduced from 513 million (EU-28) to 447 million (EU-27_2020). GDP is down from 15.9 trillion (EU-28) to 13.5 trillion (EU-27_2020) ; GDP per capita changes from 31,000 (EU-28) to 30,000 (EU-27_2020). Furthermore, the EU would lose its second-largest net contributor to the EU budget (2015: Germany \u20ac14.3 billion, United Kingdom \u20ac11.5 billion, France \u20ac5.5 billion). Thus, the departure of Britain would result in an additional financial burden for the remaining net contributors, unless the budget is reduced accordingly: Germany, for example, would have to pay an additional \u20ac4.5 billion for 2019 and again for 2020; in addition, the UK would no longer be a shareholder in the European Investment Bank, in which only EU members can participate. Britain's share amounts to 16%, \u20ac39.2 billion (2013), which Britain would withdraw unless there is an EU treaty change. All the remaining EU members (as well as Switzerland, Norway and Iceland) will also likely experience adverse effects (albeit smaller effects than the UK), in particular Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium. === In the short term === Short-term macroeconomic forecasts by the Bank of England and other banks of what would happen immediately after the Brexit referendum were too pessimistic. The assessments assumed that the referendum results would create greater uncertainty in markets and reduce consumer confidence more than it did. A number of economists noted that short-term macroeconomic forecasts are generally considered unreliable and that they are something that academic economists do not do, unlike banks. Economists have compared short-term economic forecasts to weather forecasts whereas the long-term economic forecasts are akin to climate forecasts: the methodologies used in long-term forecasts are \"well-established and robust\". === Regional inequality in UK === Studies on the economic impact that different forms of Brexit will have on different parts of the country indicate that Brexit will exacerbate regional economic inequality in the UK, as already struggling regions will be hardest hit by Brexit. === UK financial sector === Economists have warned that London's future as an international financial centre depends on whether the UK will obtain passporting rights for British banks from the European Union. If banks located in the UK cannot obtain passporting rights, they have strong incentives to relocate to financial centres within the EU. According to John Armour, Professor of Law and Finance at Oxford University, \"a 'soft' Brexit, whereby the UK leaves the EU but remains in the single market, would be a lower-risk option for the British financial industry than other Brexit options, because it would enable financial services firms to continue to rely on regulatory passporting rights.\" == Energy == According to a 2017 study by the University of Exeter and Chatham House researchers, there are considerable benefits for the UK to be integrated into the European energy market. The study notes, \"if the UK wants to enjoy the economic benefits of remaining part of what is an increasingly integrated European electricity market then, as European legislation is currently drafted, it will not only have to forgo an element of autonomy through accepting legislation and regulations made collectively at the EU level, but it will also lose much of its voice in that decision making process, effectively becoming a rule-taker rather than a rule- maker.\" == EU institutions and agencies == === Council of the EU === Analyses indicate that the departure of the relatively economically liberal UK will reduce the ability of remaining economically liberal countries to block measures in the Council of the EU. According to the Lisbon Treaty (2009), decisions of the Council are made by qualified majority voting, which means that a majority view can be blocked should at least four members of the Council, representing at least 35% of the population of the Union, choose to do so. In many policy votes, Britain, allied with other northern EU allies (Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian and the Baltic states), had a blocking minority of 35%. === European Parliament === The UK's 73 seats in the European Parliament became vacant upon its withdrawal in 2020. 27 of these seats were redistributed to other countries, with the remaining 46 reserved for potential new member states, reducing the overall number of MEPs from 751 to 705. UK MEPs retained full rights to participate in the European Parliament until withdrawal, though there were discussions about excluding UK MEPs from key committee positions. In April 2017, a group of European lawmakers discussed what should be done about the vacated seats when the UK leaves the EU. One plan, supported by Gianni Pittella and Emmanuel Macron, was to replace the 73 seats with a pan-European constituency list; other options which were considered include dropping the British seats without replacement, and reassigning some or all of the existing seats from other countries to reduce inequality of representation. As soon as the first February 2020, MEPs elected in 2019 who had their seat blocked by the UK still in the EU, became full MEP with their own seats. This makes a political shift in the European parliament, with 8 more seats for the right: 5 for the right wing PPE and 3 from the far right ID, and 13 seats less for the left: 6 less for the greens, 6 less for the S&D;, and one less for the GUE/GNL. The greens become a group smaller than the far right. https://www.lemonde.fr/les- decodeurs/article/2019/07/04/quelle-sera-la-composition-du-parlement-europeen- apres-le-brexit_5485397_4355770.html European Parliament constituencies in the United Kingdom disappeared. === EU agencies === Brexit requires the offices and staff of the European Medicines Agency and European Banking Authority, currently based in London, to move out of the UK. The agencies, which together employ more than 1,000 people, will respectively move to Amsterdam and Paris. == Farming == After Brexit, the UK will leave the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),Farm payments in a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit. House of Commons Library. 15 August 2019. which provides financial support to farmers in the EU. Most of the payments to farmers comes from the EU budget, paid for by contributions from member states.Common Agricultural Policy. Institute for Government. However, the UK receives much less than it contributes, and the CAP has been criticised for encouraging farming which harms the environment, favouring big landowners and imposing high food prices. Brexit allows the UK to develop its own agriculture policy.Brexit: UK agriculture policy. House of Commons Library. 11 September 2018. The UK government and devolved legislatures have set out plans to support farmers while enhancing the environment. The current UK government has committed to maintaining the same payments to farmers until the end of the current parliament, even without a withdrawal agreement. The Agriculture Bill is intended to replace the CAP with a new system based on paying farmers \"public money for public goods\" such as environmental protection, public access to the countryside and measures to reduce flooding. The UK government has also said it will ensure continued \"access to seasonal agricultural labour\" from abroad after Brexit. Farming unions warned that a \"no-deal\" Brexit, however, would have had \"severe impacts\" on farming.\"Farming unions in warning against no-deal Brexit\". BBC News. 10 January 2019. == Fisheries == Smoking fishermen sorting alt=Photo of crabs in large, open metal box surrounded by fishermen After Brexit, the UK will leave the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)Briefing Paper: Fisheries and Brexit. House of Commons Library. 5 September 2019. that lets all EU countries fish within 12 nautical miles of the UK coast\"Reality Check: How would Brexit affect the UK's fishing waters?\". BBC News. 31 May 2016. and lets the EU set catch quotas.Common Fisheries Policy. Institute for Government. The UK fishing industry has long criticised the CFP,What does a no deal Brexit look like for fishing?. UK in a Changing Europe. 7 February 2019. arguing that it favours non-UK fishermen because the UK has a larger fishing zone than most of its neighbours. The combined EU fishing fleets land about 6 million tonnes of fish per year, about half of which are from UK waters. The UK's share of the overall catch is about 750,000 tonnes. The UK will become an independent coastal state and be fully responsible for managing fisheries in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), extending 200 nautical miles (nm) from shore. It will still be bound by the UN Law of the Sea Convention, which requires it to co-operate with neighbours on managing shared fish stocks and prevent overfishing. By leaving the CFP, the UK could develop fisheries policy that better suits its needs. The UK will also leave the London Fisheries Convention that lets Irish, French, Belgian, Dutch and German vessels fish within six nautical miles of the UK's coast.\"UK to withdraw from international fishing arrangement\". BBC News. 2 July 2017. This was welcomed by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations and the Scottish government,\"Scottish government says UK is right to leave fishing deal\". BBC News. 2 July 2017. but the Irish fishing industry expressed concern as a third of its catch is from UK waters. Access for foreign fishing vessels to UK waters will be a matter for negotiation. According to Wageningen Economic Research, if there was a \"hard Brexit that banned EU fishermen from UK waters\", British fishermen could catch more fish but the price of their fish would drop, while the resulting trade barriers would lead to higher seafood prices for consumers, because the UK imports most of its seafood. This would be a \"lose-lose situation\" for both the UK and the EU, and for both British consumers and the fishing industry. According to a 2018 study, \"Brexit poses a major challenge to the stability of European fisheries management [...] potentially putting at risk recent recovery and future sustainability of shared fish stocks\". It said that denying access to foreign fishing vessels would risk tariffs being imposed, while granting access and seeking a more modest re-balancing of fishing entitlements would lessen this risk. In February 2020, as soon as the withdrawal occurred, Fisheries issue was raised in Guernsey. After the first ban, a temporary \u201cr\u00e9gime d\u2019autorisation\u201d has been set up to allow individual boats to fish in Guernsey.huffingtonpost == Gibraltar == Cars crossing into Gibraltar clearing customs formalities. Gibraltar is outside the customs union, VAT area, and Schengen Zone. Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, participated in the referendum and left the EU together with the UK, although 96% of those who participated in the referendum in Gibraltar voted to remain. Gibraltar is outside the EU Customs Union and Schengen Zone, meaning it has customs and identity checks at its border with Spain. Spain asserts a territorial claim on Gibraltar. After the referendum, Spain's Foreign Minister renewed calls for joint Spanish\u2013British control. This was rebuffed by Gibraltar's Chief Minister, and the UK government states it would only negotiate on Gibraltar's sovereignty with the consent of its people.\"the UK would seek the best possible deal for Gibraltar as the UK exits the EU, and there would be no negotiation on the sovereignty of Gibraltar without the consent of its people.\" Theresa May, 6 April 2017, The European Council's guidelines for withdrawal negotiations stated that UK\u2013EU agreements made after Brexit would not apply to Gibraltar without Spain's consent.\"Brexit: Gibraltar angered by Spain's EU 'veto'\". BBC News. 1 April 2017.

The Irish Times. 24 November 2018. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said that \"With Brexit we all lose, especially the United Kingdom, but when it comes to Gibraltar, Spain wins.\" == Health == A 2019 study in the Lancet suggested that Brexit would have an adverse impact on health services in the UK under every Brexit scenario, but that a no-deal Brexit would have had the worst impact. The study found that Brexit would deplete the National Health Service (NHS) workforce, create uncertainties regarding care for British nationals living in the EU, and put at risk access to vaccines, equipment, and medicines. It was claimed that supplies of life saving medications including cancer medication could have been disrupted for up to six months in no-deal Brexit. The Department of Health and Social Care stated in August 2019 that it had taken steps to ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted after Brexit.Health unions warn no-deal Brexit could cause 'fatal' medicine shortages The Independent. 29 August 2019 == Law and courts == After Brexit, the UK will have the final say over the laws that govern it.The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill: Supremacy and the Court of Justice. House of Commons Library, 8 November 2017. Under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which was passed by the British parliament, EU laws will no longer have supremacy over UK laws after Brexit. Explanatory notes on the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The Stationery Office. pp.4, 8 To maintain continuity, the Act converts EU law into UK law as \"retained EU law\". After Brexit, the British parliament (and the devolved legislatures) can decide which elements of that law to keep, amend or repeal. Furthermore, UK courts will no longer be bound by the judgments of the EU Court of Justice after Brexit. Its case law from before Brexit will still apply to UK courts, but the UK Supreme Court will not be bound by it.Barnard, Catherine. Where does Brexit leave UK law?. UK in a Changing Europe. 17 April 2019. According to Catherine Barnard from UK in a Changing Europe, any future UK\u2013EU trade agreement will require some EU law to take precedence in UK law. Brexit will leave Ireland and Cyprus as the only two remaining common law jurisdictions in the EU. Paul Gallagher, a former Attorney General of Ireland, has suggested this will isolate those countries and deprive them of a powerful partner that shared a common interest in ensuring that EU legislation was not drafted or interpreted in a way that would be contrary to the principles of the common law. Lucinda Creighton, a former Irish government minister for legal affairs, has said that Ireland relies on the \"bureaucratic capacity of the UK\" to understand, influence and implement EU legislation. == Migration == After Brexit, the UK would be able to control immigration from the EU and EEA.Managing migration after Brexit. Institute for Government. 8 March 2019. Being part of the EU and EEA means that citizens of any member state can move to the UK to live and work with very little restrictions (freedom of movement). The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains freedom of movement as UK law until it is repealed.Factsheet: end of free movement. Home Office. 21 December 2018. The Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill would repeal free movement and make EU immigration subject to UK law.The Immigration Bill: An end to free movement. House of Commons Library. 15 March 2019. The current UK government intends to replace it with a new system. The government's 2018 white paper proposes a \"skills- based immigration system\" that prioritizes skilled migrants, limits the length of time low-skilled migrants can work in the UK, and applies a stricter criminality threshold. EU and EEA citizens already living in the UK can continue living there after Brexit by applying to the EU Settlement Scheme, which began in March 2019. Irish citizens will not have to apply to the scheme.\"The post-Brexit immigration plans at a glance\". The Guardian. 19 December 2018.Briefing Paper: EU Settlement Scheme. House of Commons Library. 19 September 2019.Future skills-based immigration system: executive summary. Home Office. 19 December 2018. If there is a no-deal Brexit, EU citizens who arrive in the UK before the end of 2020 can apply to stay until the end of 2023.\"No-deal Brexit plan: EU nationals could stay three years\". BBC News. 4 September 2019. Studies estimating the long-term impact of Brexit on immigration note that many factors affect future migration flows but that Brexit and the end of free movement will likely result in a large decline in immigration from EEA countries to the UK. The Migration Policy Institute estimated immediately after the referendum that the UK \"would continue to receive 500,000 or more immigrants (from EU and non-EU countries taken together) per year, with annual net migration around 200,000\". The decline in EEA immigration is likely to have an adverse impact on the British health sector. Official figures for June 2016\u2013June 2017 showed that net non-British EU immigration to the UK slowed to about 100,000 immigrants per year (corresponding to the immigration level of 2014) while immigration from outside the EU rose. Taken together, the two inflows into the UK resulted in an only slightly reduced net immigration of 230,000 newcomers. The Head of the Office of National Statistics suggested that Brexit could be a factor for the slowdown in EU immigration, but cautioned there might be other reasons. The number of non-British EU nurses registering with the NHS fell from 1,304 in July 2016 to 46 in April 2017. Since the referendum, some British citizens have attempted to retain their EU citizenship by applying to other EU member states for citizenship, and petitioning the European Commission. ===Sport=== Currently, EEA sportspersons face minimal bureaucracy when playing in the UK. After Brexit, any EU citizen wanting to do so could be required to hold a work permit. Such work permits can be tricky to obtain, especially for young or lower ranked players. Conversely, British nationals playing in EEA states may encounter similar obstacles where none exist today. It has been computed that with Brexit, people like N'Golo Kant\u00e9 or Riyad Mahrez would not have qualified to work in England or Wales. The same occurs with those under 18, such as Cesc F\u00e0bregas or Paul Pogba when they signed for their respective English clubs.https://www.france24.com/fr/20190325-brexit-quel-impact-premier-league An agreement will be need to be reached on how regulations might change after Brexit when UK will no longer be a member of the Espace \u00e9conomique europ\u00e9en. ==People== Brexit impacts people with some kind of uncertainty. The withdrawal agreement solved some issues. Some other Brexit issues remained unsolved by withdrawal agreement, including continued freedom of movement within the EU, posted workers (in the meaning of Council Directive 96/71/EC) and other complex individual issues.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/british-residents-in- spain-confused-and-alarmed-about-post-brexit-future In France, on 15 March 2020, 800 elected conseillers municipaux of British nationality did not have the right to be reelected anymore, due to Brexit having occurred.https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/reportage-municipales- ces-elus-que-le-brexit-prive-de-leurs-droits For European citizens, entering the UK will require a passport from October 2021 and onward (i.e. an identity card will no longer be sufficient). == Transport == === Aviation === By leaving the EU, the UK would leave the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA), a single market in commercial air travel.Aviation and the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA). Institute for Government. 10 September 2017. The UK will negotiate a future relationship with the EU on the \"basis of equivalence of traffic rights and a level playing field\".Air services from the EU to the UK if there is a no-deal Brexit. Government of the United Kingdom. 5 September 2019. It could negotiate to re-join as a non-EU member (like Bosnia and Herzegovina), negotiate access through a bilateral agreement (like Switzerland), or negotiate a new 'open skies' bilateral deal with the EU. If there is a \"no-deal\" Brexit, UK airlines will still have permission to operate within the EU with no restrictions, and vice versa. UK airlines licensed before Brexit will still have permission to operate provided they are majority owned and effectively controlled by nationals of the UK and/or nationals of the EU and EEA. The UK government seeks continued participation in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Otherwise, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority would take on the role of regulator for UK airlines. A substantial increase in CAA staff and resources would be needed to meet the demands of its new role. The UK has its own air service agreements with 111 countries, which permit flights to-and-from the country, and these will continue after Brexit. It has air service agreements with a further 17 countries through its EU membership, and it has sought to replace these. By July 2019, the UK had concluded air service agreements with the United States, Canada Switzerland, Albania, Georgia, Iceland, Israel, Jordan, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, North Macedonia and Norway.International agreements if the UK leaves the EU without a deal: Aviation. Government of the United Kingdom. 18 July 2019. Three British airlines, Monarch, Flybmi and Thomas Cook, went bankrupt in the period 2017\u20132019; all three bankruptcies have been partially attributed to Brexit, more specifically the political uncertainty of the Brexit process and the falling exchange rates of the Pound sterling. === Rail === The EU announced that the Channel Tunnel rail link would remain open on current terms for three months if there had been a \"no-deal\" Brexit. The EU Commission said this should be enough time for new permanent arrangements to be agreed.\"EU announces plans to keep Channel Tunnel rail link open after no-deal Brexit\". Reuters. 12 February 2019. === Road traffic === While the UK will not benefit anymore from the EU road traffic policy, the UK remains member of other treaties which provide some kinds of transport facility. The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic is recorded by the UN, not the EU, allowing road traffic between the UK and EU member states member of that convention. The UK was in the European Common Transit Convention (CTC) as an EU member and has negotiated continuous membership after Brexit. This would apply to any new trading relationship with the EU.Logistics Manager, 18 December 2018 The CTC applies to moving goods between the EU member states, the EFTA countries (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) as well as Turkey, Macedonia and Serbia. The CTC, with its supplementary Convention on the Simplification of Formalities in the Trade of Goods, reduces administrative burdens on traders by removing the need for additional import/export declarations when transiting customs territories, and provides cash flow benefits by allowing the movement of goods across a customs territory without the payment of duties until the final destination.\"UK to remain in European Common Transit Convention after Brexit\", Irish Examiner, 17 December 2018. === Shipping === Ferries will continue, but with obstacles such as customs checks. New ferry departures between the Republic of Ireland and the European mainland have been established. == Scotland == First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon addresses journalists over Brexit and Scotland's place within Europe at Bute House. After the Brexit referendum, the Scottish Government\u2014led by the Scottish National Party (SNP)\u2014announced that officials were planning another independence referendum because Scotland voted to remain in the EU while England and Wales voted to leave. It had suggested this before the Brexit referendum. The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, requested a referendum be held before the UK's withdrawal. The UK Prime Minister rejected the requested timing, but not the referendum itself. In March 2017, the Scottish Parliament voted in favour of holding another independence referendum. Sturgeon called for a \"phased return\" of an independent Scotland back to the EU. On 21 March 2018, the Scottish Parliament passed the Scottish Continuity Bill. This was passed due to stalling negotiations between the Scottish Government and the British Government on where powers within devolved policy areas should lie after Brexit. The Act allows for all devolved policy areas to remain within the remit of the Scottish Parliament and reduces the executive power upon exit day that the UK Withdrawal Bill provides for Ministers of the Crown. The bill was referred to the UK Supreme Court, which found that it could not come into force as the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which received royal assent between the Scottish Parliament passing its bill and the Supreme Court's judgement, designated itself under schedule 4 of the Scotland Act 1998 as unamendable by the Scottish Parliament. The bill has therefore not received royal assent. == Security == Concerns have been raised that Brexit might create security problems for the UK, particularly in law enforcement and counter-terrorism where the UK could use the EU's databases on individuals crossing the British border. Security experts have credited the EU's information-sharing databases with helping to foil terrorist plots. British leaders have expressed support for retaining access to those information-sharing databases, but it could be complicated to obtain access as a non-member of the EU. Brexit would also complicate extradition requests. Under a hard Brexit scenario, the UK would lose access to databases comprising European plane travel records, vehicle registrations, fingerprints, and DNA profiles. == UK bilateral international agreements == Before the withdrawal agreement was ratified, the Financial Times said that there were approximately 759 international agreements, spanning 168 non-EU countries, that the UK would no longer have been a party to upon leaving the EU. == UK\u2013EU relationship post-Brexit == The UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU could take several forms. A research paper presented to the UK Parliament in July 2013 proposed a number of alternatives to being a member state which would continue to allow access to the EU internal market. These include remaining in the European Economic Area, negotiating deep bilateral agreements on the Swiss and Norwegian model, or leaving the EU without EEA membership or a trade agreement under the WTO Option. == UK relations with CANZUK countries and the United States == Pro-Brexit activists and politicians have argued for negotiating trade and migration agreements with the \"CANZUK\" countries\u2014those of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Numerous academics have criticised this alternative for EU membership as \"post-imperial nostalgia\". Economists note that distance reduces trade, a key aspect of the gravity model of trade, which means that even if the UK could obtain similar trade terms with the CANZUK countries as it had as part of the Single Market, it would be far less valuable to the UK. In August 2019 United States President Donald Trump pledged to negotiate a \"very big trade deal\" with the UK after Brexit.\"Johnson Walks Tightrope at G7, as Trump Pledges \u2018Very Big Trade Deal\u2019 for U.K.\" The New York Times. 25 August 2019. ==World Trade Organization== Questions have arisen over how existing international arrangements with the EU under WTO terms should evolve. Some countries\u2014such as Australia and the US\u2014wish to challenge the basis for division (i.e., division between the UK and the continuing EU) of the trade schedules previously agreed between them and the EU, because it reduces their flexibility. ==Notes== ==References== ",
