    "text": "The Sri Lanka cricket team toured South Africa in February and March 2019 to play two Tests, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The ODI fixtures were part of both teams' preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In February 2019, Sri Lanka named Dimuth Karunaratne as the captain of their Test side, after Dinesh Chandimal was dropped due to poor form. Chandimal was also omitted from Sri Lanka's ODI squad for the tour. Sri Lanka won the Test series 2\u20130, their first Test series win in South Africa. It was also the first time that a team from Asia had won a Test series in South Africa. South Africa won the ODI series 5\u20130. It was the fourth time in less than two years that Sri Lanka had been whitewashed in a five-match ODI series. For the T20I series, Faf du Plessis was named as South Africa's captain for the first match, with JP Duminy named as captain for the remaining two fixtures. South Africa also completed a whitewash in the T20I series, winning 3\u20130. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto\" |- !colspan=2|Tests !colspan=2|ODIs !colspan=2|T20Is |- ! ! ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Faf du Plessis (c) * Hashim Amla * Temba Bavuma * Theunis de Bruyn * Quinton de Kock (wk) * Dean Elgar * Zubayr Hamza * Keshav Maharaj * Aiden Markram * Wiaan Mulder * Duanne Olivier * Vernon Philander * Kagiso Rabada * Dale Steyn | * Dimuth Karunaratne (c) * Niroshan Dickwella (vc, wk) * Lasith Embuldeniya * Oshada Fernando * Vishwa Fernando * Chamika Karunaratne * Suranga Lakmal * Kusal Mendis * Angelo Perera * Kusal Perera * Kasun Rajitha * Lakshan Sandakan * Mohamed Shiraz * Kaushal Silva * Dhananjaya de Silva * Milinda Siriwardana * Lahiru Thirimanne | * Faf du Plessis (c) * ~~Hashim Amla~~ * Quinton de Kock (wk) * JP Duminy * Reeza Hendricks * Aiden Markram * David Miller * Wiaan Mulder * Lungi Ngidi * Anrich Nortje * Andile Phehlukwayo * Dwaine Pretorius * Kagiso Rabada * Tabraiz Shamsi * Dale Steyn * Imran Tahir * Rassie van der Dussen | * Lasith Malinga (c) * Niroshan Dickwella (vc, wk) * Akila Dananjaya * Avishka Fernando * Oshada Fernando * Vishwa Fernando * Kamindu Mendis * Kusal Mendis * Angelo Perera * Kusal Perera * Priyamal Perera * Thisara Perera * Kasun Rajitha * Lakshan Sandakan * Dhananjaya de Silva * Upul Tharanga * Isuru Udana | * Faf du Plessis (c) * JP Duminy (c) * Junior Dala * Quinton de Kock (wk) * Reeza Hendricks * Aiden Markram * David Miller * Chris Morris * ~~Lungi Ngidi~~ * ~~Anrich Nortje~~ * Andile Phehlukwayo * Dwaine Pretorius * Sinethemba Qeshile (wk) * Kagiso Rabada * Tabraiz Shamsi * Lutho Sipamla * Dale Steyn * Imran Tahir * Rassie van der Dussen | * Lasith Malinga (c) * Niroshan Dickwella (vc, wk) * Akila Dananjaya * Asitha Fernando * Avishka Fernando * Suranga Lakmal * Kamindu Mendis * Kusal Mendis * Angelo Perera * Priyamal Perera * Thisara Perera * Sadeera Samarawickrama * Lakshan Sandakan * Dhananjaya de Silva * Isuru Udana * Jeffrey Vandersay |} Ahead of the last two ODIs, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla and JP Duminy were added to South Africa's squad, with Reeza Hendricks and Wiaan Mulder being dropped.
