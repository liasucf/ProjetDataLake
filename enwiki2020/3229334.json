    "text": "3-Carene is a bicyclic monoterpene consisting of fused cyclohexene and cyclopropane rings. It occurs as a constituent of turpentine, with a content as high as 42% depending on the source. Carene has a sweet and pungent odor, best described as fir needles, musky earth, and damp woodlands combination.Mediavilla, Vito, Simon Steinemann, Essential oil of Cannabis sativa L. strains. Journal of the International Hemp Association, 1997, 4(2):80-82. A colorless liquid, it is not soluble in water, but miscible with fats and oils. It is chiral, occurring naturally both as the racemate and enantio-enriched forms. ==Reactions and uses== Treatment with peracetic acid gives 3,4-caranediol. Pyrolysis over ferric oxide induces rearrangement, giving p-cymene. Carene is used in the perfume industry and as a chemical intermediate. Because carene can be found in cannabis naturally, it can also be found in cannabis distillates. Greater concentrations of carene in a distillate give it an earthier taste and smell. ==References== Category:Flavors Category:Cyclohexenes Category:Monoterpenes Category:Bicyclic compounds Category:Cyclopropanes ",
