    "text": "Mori in her youth, around 1920s was a Japanese author. New York University Professor Keith Vincent has called her a \"Japanese Electra\", referring to the Electra complex counterpart put forth by Carl Jung to Sigmund Freud's Oedipal complex. ==Early life and family== Mari Mori was born in Hong\u014d, Tokyo. Her father was novelist Mori \u014cgai. ==Career== Mori won the Japan Essayist Club Award in 1957 for a collection of essays called My Father's Hat. She began a movement of writing about male homosexual passion (tanbi shousetsu, literally \"aesthetic novels\") in 1961 with A Lovers' Forest, , which won the Tamura Toshiko Prize. Later works include I Don't Go on Sundays (1961) and The Bed of Dead Leaves (1962). She was greatly influenced by her father; in A Lover's Forest, the older man can be seen as imbued with the same virtues and honor as she saw in her father. An older man and younger boy are trademarks of Mori Mari's work. The older man is extremely rich, powerful, wise, and spoils the younger boy. In The Lover's Forest, for example, the older man, Guido, is 38 or so, and Paulo is 17 or 18. (However, he is not yet 19, the age that Mori was when her father died.) Paulo is extraordinarily beautiful, prone to lounge lazily, and has a lack of willpower in all but the field of his pleasure. (Guido dies when Paolo is 19, and Paulo subsequently falls in love with a man who's been waiting in the wings, another one just like Guido.) In 1975 her won the 3rd Izumi Ky\u014dka Prize for Literature. ==Personal life== Her first husband was Tamaki Yamada, whom she married in 1919 and divorced in 1927. Her second husband was Akira Sato \u4f50\u85e4\u5f70. Mori Mari died of heart failure on 6 June 1987. ==References== == External links == * Summary of Prof. Keith Vincent's lecture at NYU (see 10 February) * An interview with a Japanese writer who mentions Mori, centerforbookculture.org * \"Mari and Annu: Childhood Re-Imagined\" Includes summary of a paper about Mori \u014cgai's daughters (archived), aasianst.org * The Room of Sweet Honey: The Adult Shoujo Fiction of Japanese Novelist Mori Mari (1903\u20131987) Category:Japanese writers Category:LGBT writers from Japan Category:1903 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Writers from Tokyo ",
