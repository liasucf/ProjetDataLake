    "text": "\"Whenever You're Near Me\" was the second single from Swedish group Ace of Base's third American record, Cruel Summer. The original version of the song, \"Life Is a Flower\", was a huge hit in Europe and Japan. The lyrics were rewritten by song composer Mike Chapman, and the song was released to radio stations in North and South America on October 6, 1998. This version peaked at number 76 in the United States and number 51 in Canada; it was the band's last charting hit in both countries. ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that the song \"shows Ace Of Base revisiting the more familiar pop/reggae sound that made the group a top 40 favorite.\" He noted that the track \"builds upon a bankable sound rather than mimicking it. The song has a decidedly more complex arrangement, which is rife with sunny Caribbean percussion and a sweet smattering of acoustic guitar/synth interplay.\" He also added that Jenny's and Linn's vocals are \"notably more restrained here than on past singles, which allows the melody and chorus to work their contagious magic without vocal overkill. Downright irresistible, this cute single should saturate airwaves within seconds.\" Gary Shipes from The Stuart News noted in his review, that \"Whenever You're Near Me\" and \"Adventures in Paradise\" are pristine pop productions worthy of ABBA and Trevor Horn's '80s confections for Buggles, Dollar and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.\"Shipes, Gary (7 August 1998). \"MAKING A CASE FOR ACE OF BASE; UN-APEELING 'AVENGERS'\".
