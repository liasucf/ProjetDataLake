    "text": "Seaton Park is a public park in the Old Aberdeen area of Aberdeen, Scotland. One of the city's biggest parks, it was bought by the city for use as a public park in 1947 from Major Hay. The River Don passes through the edge of the park, and there are paths running along both sides of the river. There are well-maintained flower beds on the lawns that run down the centre of one of the park's main pathways, with flowers that are tended daily and planted annually. There is also a secluded set of walled gardens next to a small private housing mews called Seaton Stables. The park is often used as a path for students of the University of Aberdeen to move between the university campus and the Hillhead Halls of Residence, which lie atop a hill overlooking the park on the side opposite from St. Machar's Cathedral. The path from the residence halls to the campus leads along the flowerbeds on the main walkway and past the Cathedral via the Chanonry Road. The University authorities advise students to be cautious during dark hours due to the lack of street lighting. Aberdeen Football Club often train on the grass pitches in the park. Part of the park has been turned into a wetland area to manage the tendency to flooding. ==References== == External links == *Seaton Park at Aberdeen City Council *Friends of Seaton Park Category:Parks in Aberdeen Category:History of Aberdeen ",
