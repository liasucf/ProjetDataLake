    "text": "\"Love Makes Sweet Music\" was the first single released by the psychedelic rock group Soft Machine. It is one of the first British psychedelic releases, predating Pink Floyd's \"Arnold Layne\" by a month.The Sunday Times, Sept 2, 2007 The A-side is more pop-orientated, featuring Robert Wyatt on lead vocals. The other side, \u2018Feelin\u2019 Reelin Squeelin\u2019 is a disturbing tour de force with Kevin Ayers handling the lead vocal for the verses, while Robert Wyatt sings the chorus; there is an elliptical series of strange noises and flute in the solo. The tracks from the single have been reissued on the Soft Machine compilations Triple Echo and Out-Bloody-Rageous - An Anthology 1967 -1973 (Sony), while both sides of the single also appear on the 1972 Polydor compilation LP Rare Tracks; recently, the 2009 CD edition of the album \"The Soft Machine\" has the two songs as bonus tracks. The original copy of the single commands very high prices when it turns up for auction. ==Track listing== #\"Love Makes Sweet Music\" (Kevin Ayers) #\"Feelin\u2019 Reelin' Squeelin\u2019\" (Kevin Ayers) == Personnel == *Kevin Ayers - guitar (\"Love Makes Sweet Music\"), bass (\"Feelin...\"), vocals *Daevid Allen - bass (\"Love Makes Sweet Music\"), guitar (\"Feelin...\") *Robert Wyatt \u2013 drums, vocals *Mike Ratledge - keyboards ==References== ==External links== *http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/1790 Review Category:Kevin Ayers songs Category:1967 debut singles Category:Songs written by Kevin Ayers Category:Song recordings produced by Chas Chandler Category:1967 songs Category:Polydor Records singles ",
