    "text": "Porter Andrew Moser (born August 24, 1968) is the head men's basketball coach at Loyola University Chicago. Originally from Naperville, Illinois, Moser attended and played varsity basketball at Benet Academy, and then Creighton University. Moser previously held the head coaching position at Illinois State (2003\u20132007) and Arkansas-Little Rock (2000\u20132003). Prior to being hired at Loyola, Moser was an assistant coach at Saint Louis under Rick Majerus for the 2007-08 season, and the associate head coach from 2008-11. ==Playing career== During his high school career, Moser helped lead Benet Academy in suburban Lisle to a 70-14 (.833) record in three years on the varsity roster, playing for coach Bill Geist. The Naperville native led Benet to three East Suburban Catholic Conference titles and was a three-time all-conference and two-time all-area selection. As a senior, he was named Most Valuable Player in the West Suburban Catholic Conference. On May 6, 2017, he was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association (IBCA) Hall of Fame. http://www.loyolaramblers.com/news/2017/5/8/Moser_Inducted_Into_Illinois_Basketball_Coaches_Association_Hall_Of_Fame.aspx Moser went on to play college basketball at Creighton University for coach Tony Barone, where he helped the Bluejays to a Missouri Valley Conference Championship and NCAA Tournament appearance in 1989. He played in 102 games including 27 starts, averaging 4.6 points and 1.7 assists per game during his collegiate career. https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/porter- moser-2.html ==Coaching career== ===Assistant=== After graduating from Creighton, Moser began his coaching career in the 1990\u201391 season as a graduate assistant at Creighton under Barone. Following Barone to Texas A&M;, Moser was an assistant there from 1991 to 1995 and helped Texas A&M; make its first postseason appearance in seven years, in the 1994 National Invitation Tournament. After serving as an assistant at Milwaukee in the 1995\u201396 season, Moser returned to Texas A&M; for what would become Barone's final two seasons as head coach from 1996 to 1998. From 1998 to 2000, Moser was an assistant coach at Arkansas\u2013Little Rock, under Wimp Sanderson in his first season and Sidney Moncrief in his second. ===Arkansas\u2013Little Rock=== Moser's first head coaching job was with Arkansas\u2013Little Rock from 2000 to 2003. Inheriting a 4-24 team, Moser led the Trojans to an 18-11 record in his first season and finished with an overall 54-34 record. Statistically, the Trojans moved from last to first in the Sun Belt Conference in field goal percentage defense and three-point field goal percentage defense in Moser's first season in 2000\u201301. ===Illinois State=== Moser was the head coach at Illinois State from 2003 to 2007. After finishing the 2003-04 season 10-19, Moser led Illinois State to a 17-13 overall record and sixth-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). However, Illinois State dropped to 9-19 in 2005-06 season, including a 1\u20139 finish. Despite an improvement to 15\u201316 in 2006-07 season, Illinois State lost in the first round of the MVC Tournament for the 3rd consecutive season. Seeking a change \"in the overall direction of the program,\" Illinois State Athletics Director Sheahon Zenger fired Moser and terminated the contracts of Moser's three assistant coaches on March 5, 2007. ===Saint Louis=== Ranked in the top 50 Division I assistant coaches by Basketball Times in 2009, Moser was an assistant coach at Saint Louis under Rick Majerus from 2007 to 2011, including as associate head coach from 2008 to 2011. In 2009\u201310, Saint Louis finished 23-13 and as CBI runners-up. ===Loyola\u2013Chicago=== On April 5, 2011, Loyola University Chicago named Moser head coach of the Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team. Moser's hire followed the firing of Jim Whitesell, who went 109\u2013107 in seven seasons. In his introductory press conference, Moser said that he aspired to make Loyola\u2013Chicago into a Horizon League contender similar to Butler. Under Moser, Loyola\u2013Chicago went 7\u201323 in the 2011\u201312 season and 15\u201316 in 2012\u201313 before moving from the Horizon League to the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) in 2013. In its first season in the MVC, Loyola\u2013Chicago went 10\u201322. Moser's fourth season was his first at Loyola\u2013Chicago with a winning record, at 24\u201313 (8\u201310 MVC) and the College Basketball Invitational title following a two-game sweep of Louisiana\u2013Monroe.https://www.sports- reference.com/cbb/schools/loyola-il/2015-schedule.html After a 15\u201317 season in 2015\u201316, Loyola\u2013Chicago had its second winning season under Moser in 2016\u201317 with an 18\u201314 (8\u201310 MVC) record. ====2018 Final Four run==== Moser had his most successful season at Loyola\u2013Chicago in 2017\u201318, with a 32\u20136 (15\u20133 MVC) record, MVC regular season and tournament titles, and appearance in the Final Four as a no. 11 seed. The MVC preseason poll picked Loyola\u2013Chicago to finish third, with one vote picking Loyola\u2013Chicago for first place. On December 6, 2017, Loyola\u2013Chicago beat a top-five team for the first time since the 1984\u201385 season after a 65-59 away upset of no. 5 Florida. On March 4, 2018, Loyola\u2013Chicago defeated Moser's former school Illinois State 65-49 in the MVC Tournament final to qualify for the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1985. Entering the NCAA Tournament as a no. 11 seed, Loyola\u2013Chicago had close upset victories in the first three rounds, 64-62 over no. 6 Miami (FL) in the Round of 64, 63-62 over no. 3 Tennessee in the Round of 32, and 69-68 over no. 7 Nevada in the Sweet 16. The win over Nevada was the 30th overall win for Loyola\u2013Chicago, enough for the most wins in program history. Loyola\u2013Chicago advanced to its first Final Four since the 1963 national title year, after a 78-62 win over no. 9 Kansas State. Loyola became only the fourth no. 11 seed to reach the Final Four, after LSU in 1986, George Mason in 2006, and VCU in 2011. On March 31, Loyola\u2013Chicago lost to no. 3 Michigan 69-57 in their Final Four game held at the Alamodome in San Antonio. Prior to Final Four weekend, Moser expressed hope that his team's run in the tournament would make it easier for other mid-major programs to earn at-large NCAA Tournament bids. ====Recruiting Chicago Players==== Unlike his recent coaching predecessors at Loyola, Moser has had success drawing recruits from the Chicago area talent pool. Former players Milton Doyle (Marshall) and Donte Ingram (Simeon) as well as current players Lucas Williamson (Whitney Young), Cameron Krutwig (Jacobs), Marquise Kennedy (Brother Rice) and Tom Welch (Naperville North) are all from the Chicago area.https://loyolaramblers.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster ==Broadcasting== During the 2019 NCAA Tournament, Moser signed on with CBS and Turner as a guest TV studio analyst for the second round of the tournament. ==Head coaching record== ==Personal== Moser has a wife, Megan, and four children, Jordan, Jake, Ben, and Max.
