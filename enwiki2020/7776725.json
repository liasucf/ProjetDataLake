The station was originally part of the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway. ==History== The station opened on 1 December 1877,Butt (1995), page 222 and was located close to the junction between the lines to Glasgow St Enoch via Gorbals Junction (opened the year before the station itself, in 1876) and the older route towards (first opened in 1848 by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway). It closed to passengers permanently on 28 May 1962.
