    "text": "The 7.35\u00d751mm Carcano is a rifle cartridge that was the main small arms ammunition used by the Italian military during World War II. It was designed during the 1930s, to replace the 6.5\u00d752mm Carcano used by the Italian military. Unlike the 6.5 mmm, the 7.35 mm cartridge featured a Spitzer-style bullet, to minimize air resistance in flight. ==Description== After reports of inadequate performance of the 6.5\u00d752mm Mannlicher\u2013Carcano at both short and long rangesDunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), pp. 47-48: The 6.5mm Carcano had reportedly proved inadequate in stopping charges of native tribesmen for a number of years, prompting various stop-gap solutions such as brass-jacketed multiple projectile or frangible explosive bullets, apparently for use against tribesmen in colonial conflicts.Weeks, John, World War II Small Arms, New York: Galahad Books, p. 47: the 6.5mm's blunt bullet and relatively low velocity also gave poor long range performance in machine guns, compared to the cartridges used by most other nations. during the campaigns in Italian North Africa (1924-1934), and the Second Italo- Abyssinian War (1935/36), the Italian army introduced a new short rifle in 1938, the Modello 1938, together with a new cartridge in 7.35x51mm caliber. In addition to the slightly larger caliber, Italian ordnance designers introduced a spitzer-type bullet for the new cartridge, with the tip filled with aluminum to produce an unstable (tumbling) projectile upon impact with soft tissue (a design most likely copied from the .303 British Mk VII bullet). Although the intention was to create a more powerful and precise rifle cartridge, the decision to adopt a lighter bullet than in the 6.5 mm Carcano,http://bobshellsblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/735-carcano-rifle.html Bob Shell's Blog and various design problems of the 91/38 rifle, did not permit the cartridge to achieve the intended success. ==See also== * Table of handgun and rifle cartridges ==Notes== Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges Category:Military cartridges ",
