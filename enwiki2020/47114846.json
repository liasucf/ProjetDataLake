Twenty-one All-Star Games have been held since the Ottawa Senators entered the league in 1992, with at least one player chosen to represent the Senators in each year. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez- vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games. Ottawa has hosted one of the games. The 59th took place at the Canadian Tire Centre, then known as Scotiabank Place. * Selected by fan vote * Selected by Commissioner {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Ottawa Senators players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game |- !scope=\"col\" | Game !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 44th |rowspan=\"2\" |1993 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 45th |1994 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 46th |1996 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 47th |1997 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 48th |rowspan=\"2\" |1998 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 49th |rowspan=\"2\" | 1999 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 50th |2000 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 51st |rowspan=\"3\" |2001 | | |rowspan=\"3\" | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 52nd |2002 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 53rd |rowspan=\"4\" |2003 | | |rowspan=\"4\" | |- | | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| 54th | rowspan=\"3\"|2004 | | | rowspan=\"3\"| |- | (Did not play) | |- | (Did not play) | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 55th |2007 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 56th |rowspan=\"3\" |2008 | | |rowspan=\"3\" | |- | (Did not play) | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 57th |2009 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 58th |2011 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| 59th |rowspan=\"4\" |2012 | | |rowspan=\"4\" | |- | | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 60th |2015 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 61st |2016 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 62nd |2017 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 63rd |2018 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 64th |2019 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| 65th |rowspan=2| 2020 | | |rowspan=2| |- | (Replaced Auston Matthews) | |} ==Career achievements== ===Hockey Hall of Fame=== The following is a list of Ottawa Senators who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Ottawa Senators inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame ! scope=\"col\" |Individual ! scope=\"col\" |Category ! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted ! scope=\"col\" |Years with Senators in category ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2014 |2005\u20132006 |, retrieved June 29, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2020 |1997\u20132004 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Builder |2002 |2001\u20132003 |, retrieved June 29, 2015 |} ===Retired numbers=== The Ottawa Senators have retired three of their jersey numbers.
