    "text": "Gustav \"Gusto\" Arthur Gr\u00e4ser (16 February 1879 \u2013 27 October 1958) was a German alternative lifestyle advocate, artist, and poet. He is considered one of the fonders of communal lifestyle in Germany. Together with his brother and fellow artist Karl Gr\u00e4ser, he co-founded one of the earliest social reform settlements, which was located along Monte Verit\u00e0 in Ascona. His penned and painted works included many of that were not published until a revival of interest during the counterculture of the 1960s emerged. Gr\u00e4ser was born in Bra\u0219ov (Kronstadt), a city in the Transylvania region of Austria-Hungary that is now part of Romania. At an early age, he was influenced by the philosophy of social reformer Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach. In 1897, Gr\u00e4ser lived in Diefenbach's commune, Himmelhof, located in Ober Sankt Veit, near Vienna, and embraced his ideas of pacifism, a human civilization in harmony with nature, and a vegetarian diet, while studying art. However, Gr\u00e4ser was dissuaded by Diefenbach's despotic leadership, and left the commune in 1898 to form his own following in Munich. In 1900, Gr\u00e4ser completely cut ties with his hometown to wander, and co-founded his own commune near Monte Verit\u00e0 in Ascona with his brother, Karl Gr\u00e4ser. Among the settlement's inhabitants included several artists and authors such as Otto Gross, Leonhard Frank, Erich Muhsam, Franziska Countess zu Reventlow, and Hermann Hesse, whom Gr\u00e4ser influenced in his written works. Gr\u00e4ser helped fund the commune by giving lectures in various cities and selling copies of his poetry, but was often faced with ridicule for his appearance. In 1911, Gr\u00e4ser moved his family of six to the outskirts of Berlin. He became a leading figure in the political reconstruction of the youth movement, in particular, the Free German Youth Movement. However, Gr\u00e4ser's teachings were met with hostility, in 1912 he was arrested and expelled from Saxony, and again from Baden in the following year. In 1915, Gr\u00e4ser was deported to Austria and sentenced to death for being a conscientious objector, but, instead, was ruled to be legally insane, and was transported to a mental institution. After he was released, Gr\u00e4ser briefly returned to Mount Verita, before becoming an activist against the First World War. Although he was expelled from Bavaria in 1919, Gr\u00e4ser migrated with a \"new crowd\" known as the \"crusade of love\" with his associate, Friedrich Muck- Lamberty, which was a subject in Hesse's story, Journey to the East. In 1927, Gr\u00e4ser began public speaking in Berlin's Anti-War Museum, settled in the commune of Grunhurst, and traveled through Germany with his son, Otto Brobohmig, to distribute his writings. When the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, Grunhurst was destroyed, and many of its inhabitants, including some of Gr\u00e4ser's family, were killed or sent to internment camps in 1936. Gr\u00e4ser managed to avoid capture by fleeing to Munich, living in seclusion in fellow poets' attics, and wrote some of his most acclaimed pieces including Siebenmah and Wunderbar. After continuing his travels through Germany, Gr\u00e4ser died in 1958 in Munich. His unpublished poetry was saved before the destruction of his home and preserved in the Municipal Library in Munich. ==Works== *Efeubl\u00e4tter. Gedichte.
