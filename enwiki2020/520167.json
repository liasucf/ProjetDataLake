    "text": "Easdale () is one of the Slate Islands, in the Firth of Lorn, Scotland. Once the centre of the Scottish slate industry, there has been some recent island regeneration. A ferry sails from Easdale to Ellenabeich (Gaelic: Eilean nam Beathach) on the nearby island of Seil (Gaelic: Saoil), which is separated from Easdale by only a narrow channel. Confusingly, Ellenabeich is sometimes known as Easdale as a result of its traditional connections with the island. ==Etymology== In 1549, Donald Monro, \"Dean of the Isles\" wrote, in brief reference to Easdale, of an island \"namit in the Erische Leid Ellan Eisdcalfe\"Monro (1549) \"Eisdcalfe\" No. 36. Translation from Scots: \"named in the Gaelic language Eilean Eisdcalfe\".Gillies (1909) p. 154 However the derivation of \"Eisdcalfe\" and this word's etymological relationship to \"Easdale\" is not clear. Haswell Smith (2004) notes that eas is Gaelic for \"waterfall\" and dal is Norse for \"valley\".Haswell Smith (2004) p. 78 Nonetheless, it is not clear why either description should apply to the island which is low lying and has no waterfalls. The Gaelic name, \u00c8isdeal () or Eilean \u00c8isdeal has a long vowel and local folk legend attributes this to a derivation from \u00e8ist thall \"listen to that yonder\". Gaelic Place-Names of Scotland states that the first element is obscure, the second Norse dalr. It is not clear if this \u00c8isdeal shares its derivation with Gleann \u00c8isdeal (Glen Ashdale) (Glen of Ash trees) on the Isle of Arran. Ellenbeich is usually analysed as Eilean nam Beathach () \"island of the animals\" but this may be a reflex of an earlier and homophonous form Eilean nam Beitheach \"island of the birch trees\". ==History== Once a centre of the British slate industry, Easdale had a community of more than 500 working as many as seven quarries, some of which extended to below sea level. Easdale slate helped to build major cities of the British Empire and can still be seen on rooftops as far afield as Melbourne, Nova Scotia, Dunedin and Dublin. The great storm of 1850 flooded most of the quarries. Lacking any means of pumping the water away, the slate industry on the island more or less came to an abrupt end.\"Slate Islands - The Islands that Roofed the World\" southernhebrides.com. Retrieved 21 October 2015. The last slate was cut in the 1950s and the once active quarries are little more than still pools which provide a safe haven for a wide variety of flora and bird life. Nearby the former island Eilean-a-beithich once stood in the Easdale Sound between Easdale and Seil; however, it was quarried to a depth of below sea level leaving only the outer rim of the island. This was eventually swept away by the sea and little visible sign of the island now remains. By the early 1960s, the population had dwindled to only four people and the island appeared doomed. Descendants of the original quarrymen, along with others from around the world, have moved to Easdale to create a model of island regeneration. The island now has a population of around sixty people and is the smallest permanently inhabited island of the Inner Hebrides.This is true only if bridged and tidal islands are excluded. Eilean B\u00e0n, which is part of the Skye Bridge and Eilean Donan, which is tidal, were both inhabited at the time of the 2001 Census and smaller.General Register Office for Scotland (28 November 2003) Occasional Paper No 10: Statistics for Inhabited Islands The Scottish plant collector Clara Winsome Muirhead surveyed the plant life of the island and published The Flora of Easdale and the Garvellachs in 1962. British indie rock band Florence and the Machine filmed their double-feature music video for their singles \"Queen of Peace\" and \"Long & Lost\" on the island, with the videos using the villagers as the cast.Munro, Alistair (28 June 2015)\"Florence and the Machine film music video on Easdale\" The Scotsman.

Clive created local issues of stamps, and Jonathan has continued doing this. ==Facilities and activities== The island is home to a folk museum owned and operated by the Eilean Eisdeal, a development trust, as well as a bar/restaurant called \"The Puffer\".\"Eilean Eisdeal\" easdale.org.
