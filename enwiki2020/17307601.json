He participated in the T-4 euthanasia program in Nazi Germany and, after the invasion of Poland, in Operation Reinhard phase of the Holocaust. ==Life== Barbl was a tinsmith and plumber employed at the nitrogen works in Linz as a gas and waterpipe fitter.Gordon J. Horwitz, In the Shadow of Death: Living Outside the Gates of Mauthausen, p. 69, Maxwell Macmillan International, 1990 He joined the Nazi Party and the SS after the Anschluss of Austria. He was posted to Hartheim Euthanasia Centre at the onset of the Action T4 forced euthanasia program, and served at Grafeneck Euthanasia Centre as well. At both institutions he was a Stanzer, stamping sheet metal with names of the dead to form nameplates. He would then attach them to small urns which he used to fill up with ash indistinctively. The urns were then sent to victims' relatives correctly named, but invariably with the wrong contents, as he filled them up with ashes shoveled indiscriminately from the adjacent crematorium.Henry Friedlander, The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, p. 234, UNC Press, 1995, Google Books ===Operation Reinhard=== In 1942 Barbl was posted to Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp, the first of the Nazi German extermination camps created for the purpose of implementing the secretive Operation Reinhard. Barbl was often drunk on duty. Not particularly intelligent (which might also explain his low rank), he was frequently made fun of by his SS colleagues. Camp commandant, SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Gottlieb Hering did not allow him to participate in the execution of sick and elderly arrivals because, \"he is so daft that he would shoot us, not the Jews\". Consequently, he was the only person to be excused from this duty. However, no one was certain whether Barbl was genuinely stupid, or if he was merely acting a fool just to avoid more demanding tasks.Robin O'Neil, Belzec: Stepping Stone to Genocide (excerpts) - Chapter 6. . Barbl was not exempt from his commandant's punishments. He was frequently whipped by Christian Wirth for his drunken behavior,O'Neil, Belzec: Stepping Stone to Genocide - Chapter 8. and for an unknown reason in the winter of 1942-43, Hering allegedly had him imprisoned in a cell for several days. Barbl was sent to Sobibor extermination camp by Wirth for his plumbing skills, to help fit the exhaust piping for the gas chambers. Barbl boasted that he had made the gas chambers look like neat shower rooms.Sobibor Interviews: Biographies of SS-men After the war Barbl was interrogated by Austrian police but was never put on trial.Dick de Mildt, In the Name of the People: Perpetrators of Genocide in the Reflection of Their Post-War Prosecution in West Germany. The \"Euthanasia\" and \"Aktion Reinhard\" Trial Cases, p. 394, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1996. Google Books. He submitted his testimony in Linz on September 6, 1965 at the Austrian Ministry of Internal Affairs. No further details are known of his life and death. ==References== Category:1900 births Category:Year of death missing Category:People from Rohrbach District Category:Tinsmiths Category:Austrian Nazis Category:Belzec extermination camp personnel Category:Sobibor extermination camp personnel Category:SS personnel ",
