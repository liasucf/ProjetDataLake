They are known for subsistence hunting of langur and macaque monkeys. They gather wild forest tubers, fruits, and greens on a regular basis. To obtain grain (rice), iron, cloth, and jewelry, they carve wooden bowls and boxes to trade for goods from local farmers. They do not sell other forest products, bushmeat, or forest medicinal plants. Their population is estimated at about 650, with 618 in Nepal's 2011 census,https://unstats.un.org/unsD/demographic/sources/census/wphc/Nepal/Nepal- Census-2011-Vol1.pdf people living in small settlements in the regions of western Nepal. Most have been forcibly settled by the government of Nepal but there are about 150 nomadic Raute, who, as late as 2016, still chose to live a nomadic life. The government of Nepal has permitted them to cut down small trees in state - run forests needed for poles in erecting their tents, which often puts them in friction with the local population.BBC Documentary on Nomadic Life|Kate Humble, , BBC Documentary / Nov 2016, minutes 14:02\u201317:13. The Raute move from place to place, spending no more than 4 to 5 months at one place at a time, and often no more than a few days, in search of better water sources, or of villages where they can sell their wood products for food staples. The Raute language is called \"Raute\" in most studies and sometimes \"Khamci,\" meaning \"our talk\" in a few other studies. It is closely related to the language spoken by two related ethnic groups, the Ban Raji (\"Little Rulers of the Forest\") and Raji (\"Little Rulers\") of the same region (Fortier and Rastogi 2004). Rautes emphasize that they wish to remain full-time foragers and not assimilate into the surrounding farming population. ==Founding principles== The Raute people emphasize that their continued existence is based on three principles: * Remaining nomadic * Continuing their own native culture, language, and education * Remaining hunter-gatherers ==References== == Sources == * Bista, Dor Bahadur 1978 Encounter with the Raute: Last Hunting Nomads of Nepal.
