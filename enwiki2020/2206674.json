The Senate was then composed of 12 Liberals, 10 Nacionalistas and two independents who caucus with the latter. Shortly before the Senate adjourned, Lim took the floor to buy time to wait for the arrival from the United States, of fellow Nacionalista Senator Alejandro Almendras. Lim had to stand the entire time, leaning only on the podium on occasions. He only had water nearby to sustain him and was even prohibited from going to the comfort room; forcing him to relieve in his pants. Upon learning of Almendras' arrival in the session hall, Lim ended his filibustering after 18 hours and 30 minutes. Immediately after he was able to cast his vote for Rodriguez, Lim was carried out of the session hall on a stretcher due to exhaustion. Only to find out later that Almendras voted for Marcos. ===Later career=== When Marcos bolted from the Liberals to the Nacionalistas to run as president in the 1965 election, Lim supported President Diosdado Macapagal of the rival Liberal Party. When Marcos won the election, Lim transferred to the Liberals. In 1970, Lim was elected to the 1971 constitutional convention. In 1973, Marcos appointed Lim to the Court of Appeals. ==Legacy== Roseller Lim was the first and only politician from Zamboanga to be elected to the Philippine Senate.
