    "text": "S\u00e3o Miguel Paulista is a train station belonging to CPTM Line 12-Sapphire, located in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. ==History== The station was built by EFCB on 7 February 1926, along with Variante de Po\u00e1, which was opened only on 1 January 1934. In the end of the 1970s, it was rebuilt by RFFSA, being reopened on 10 June 1982. It was operated by Brazilian Company of Urban Trains (CBTU) until 1994, when it was transferred, along with other CBTU lines and stations, to the CPTM. The rebuilt plan of the station to west of the capital was published initially in 2002, in the CPTM Director Plan. In 2004, the Una Arquitetos office was hired for the development of the basic plan. Besides it was announced on June 2007, the rebuilt didn't happen until the 2010s, when the executive project was made. In 2010, a new station was built a little bit ahead, towards Br\u00e1s. After many delays, the new station was delivered on 29 July 2013, but only with the track towards Br\u00e1s working, because, to board towards Calmon Viana, it was needed to use the old structure. On 3 August 2013, the new station started definitively on both tracks, deactivating the old station in Rua Salvador de Medeiros. The new station was opened only with the south access, next to Pra\u00e7a Padre Aleixo. On 21 October 2014, the north access was opened, made by Jardim Lapenna. Therefore, it's possible to cross from one side to another, serving as a connecting catwalk for both neighbourhoods. The displacement of the station from its original location caused losses for the S\u00e3o Miguel commercial centre, specially in the boardwalk of Rua Serra Dourada, installed in 1979 in front of the south exit of the old station, being the only of its kind outside the central region of S\u00e3o Paulo. Besides the protests of local shopkeepers and the promise of a project for a new access to the rebuilt station, which would attend Rua Salvador de Medeiros and Rua Serra Dourada, nothing was made until then. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1934 Category:Railway stations opened in 2013 Category:1934 establishments in Brazil ",
