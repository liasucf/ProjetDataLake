    "text": "William Hugh \"Hughie\" Russell (10 March 1921 \u2013 10 December 1991) was an English professional footballer. Shortly after World War II Russell joined Gillingham, then a non-league team. He scored 98 goals in just 126 games for the Kent side prior to their return to the Football League in 1950, including a haul of nine goals in a match against Gloucester City in the 1946\u201347 season, a club record for a single match which stands to this day. Contemporary newspaper reports state that he hit the post late on with a shot which could have given him double figures. Russell remained at the club after its re- election to the Football League, but could not repeat his non-league scoring feats, registering just 8 goals in over 60 matches. He was forced to retire through injury in 1952 and later served as the club's trainer before leaving football entirely to work as a hotelier. He died in Taunton in 1991. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:1991 deaths Category:People from Redcar Category:Association football forwards Category:English footballers Category:South Bank F.C. players Category:Bishop Auckland F.C. players Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:British Army personnel of World War II ",
