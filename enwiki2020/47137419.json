    "text": "You Disgust Me is the third studio album by the hip hop duo Gangrene, consists of rappers/producers The Alchemist and Oh No. This is the second project they released in 2015, the first being Welcome to Los Santos, a compilation album in the spirit of GTA V, a game that they have composed the music of alongside Woody Jackson and Tangerine Dream. ==Background== On Twitter, Oh No mentioned that a third project by Gangrene is in the making. Following the release of the Grand Theft Auto V score produced by Alchemist and Oh No, they revealed that their focus was now on a new Gangrene album. In an exclusive interview on the show \"Jigga Juice\" on an Israeli radio station (106.2FM) on June 25, 2014, The Alchemist said that the album is almost finalized. On November 7, 2014, Alchemist tweeted again about new Gangrene coming soon and then, Director Jason Goldwatch announced that they are making songs and videos (more specifically, \"songs for videos, instead of the other way around\"). On January 14, 2015, Goldwatch said that the editing of the first video, for a single named \"Driving Gloves\" is done, and the video is coming soon. The video was released on July 17. Gangrene revealed the album title to be \"You Disgust Me\". The album was first released on iTunes, on August 7, 2015, and then on physical copy a week or so later. The album consists of 13 tracks and a bonus track for iTunes downloaders (Hot Pillow, that was released as a single too on SoundCloud on July 2). The production was handled by The Alchemist and Oh No as usual, but one song (the single \"Driving Gloves\") was produced by Tommy Mas. Also, on \"Sheet Music\", Party Supplies produced the song alongside Alchemist. The album has guest features from Action Bronson, Evidence, Your Old Droog, Fashawn, Chuck Strangers, Havoc and Sean Price. Sean Price died only a few hours after the release of the album, making \"Sheet Music\" the last song to be released while he was still alive. ==Track listing== == References == Category:2015 albums Category:Oh No (musician) albums Category:The Alchemist (musician) albums Category:Mass Appeal Records albums ",
