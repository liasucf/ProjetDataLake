The team also fields modified racing cars for several drivers around the Northeastern United States. ==Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series== ===Truck No. 16 history=== The team ran part-time in 2016, using the No. 16 and entering the short track races with Friesen as driver. For the team's debut race at Eldora, the truck had a body from Kyle Busch Motorsports and an engine from Richard Childress Racing. ===Truck No. 52 history=== Stewart Friesen at Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway in 2019 In 2017, the team announced plans to run the full Truck schedule as Halmar Friesen Racing with Friesen driving the renumbered No. 52. HFR hired Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series team owner Tommy Baldwin Jr. of Tommy Baldwin Racing to serve as team manager. After the June Texas race, the team announced a two-race hiatus and that they would return in Kentucky in July. Friesen captured the pole for the 2017 Eldora Dirt Derby and finished second to Matt Crafton in the race after leading over half of the laps. On August 23, 2017, HFR announced the end of its partnership with Baldwin and the start of a new technical alliance with GMS Racing. On August 16, 2018, Friesen made the truck series playoffs for the first time in the organization's history. On July 11, 2019, NASCAR confiscated the No. 52 truck prior to the Kentucky race after discovering an issue with the firewall during pre-race inspection. The team was able to use their backup truck, which finished second in the race. On August 1, 2019, Friesen finally broke through to win his first career NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series race at Eldora. On December 3, 2019, it was announced that the team would switch from Chevrolet to Toyota in an alliance with Kyle Busch Motorsports starting in 2020, thus ending their previous alliance with GMS Racing. After missing the playoffs with Friesen, Timothy Peters was tabbed as a replacement driver for a late- season race at Kansas Speedway; Friesen had already scheduled a dirt racing appearance for the night of the race. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:NASCAR teams ",
