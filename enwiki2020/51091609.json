    "text": "This is a list of corps serving within the armies of the British Empire during the Second World War. A Corps was either a temporary military formation created for combat, or an \"administrative\" formation that coordinated specialist military functions across a national military force. A combat Corps was composed of specialist units from various \"administrative\" Corps from combat arms, combat support arms and combat services. Combat Arms were formation sized units from the Corps of infantry and armour, usually 2 or more divisions in strength. Combat Support Arms were smaller units from the Corps of artillery, engineers, signals, intelligence or reconnaissance. Combat Services were units from the Corps of medicine, general services, ordnance, pioneers, logistics and other more specialized functions. For example, I Canadian Corps consisted of 1 infantry division, 1 armour division, 1 armour brigade and Corps Troops (20 plus companies from the Corps of engineers, signals, medicine, military police, etc...) Military formations within the British Empire were composed of a changing mix of units from across Britain, its colonies and the dominions. As a result, military formations within the Empire and Commonwealth are not easily attributable to specific Imperial or national entities and naming conventions do not necessarily correlate with modern country names. ==British Army == ;Field Corps * I Airborne Corps * 1 Anti-Aircraft Corps * 2 Anti-Aircraft Corps * 3 Anti-Aircraft Corps * I Corps * II Corps * III Corps * IV Corps * V Corps * VII Corps * VIII Corps * IX Corps * X Corps * XI Corps * XII Corps * XIII Corps * XXX Corps ;Combat Arms * Army Air Corps * Corps of Royal Marines * Royal Armoured Corps * Royal Tank Corps ;Combat Support Arms *Reconnaissance Corps *Royal Engineers * Intelligence Corps * Royal Artillery * Royal Corps of Signals ;Combat Services *Army Catering Corps *Auxiliary Territorial Service * Corps of Army Music *Corps of Military Police * General Service Corps *Military Provost Staff Corps * Pioneer Corps * RAF Regiment * Royal Logistic Corps * Royal Army Medical Corps * Royal Army Ordnance Corps * Royal Army Pay Corps * Royal Army Service Corps * Royal Army Veterinary Corps * Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers ;Other * Army Educational Corps * Mechanised Transport Corps * Non- Combatant Corps * Royal Army Dental Corps * Royal Army Physical Training Corps * Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers ==Imperial and Dominion== ===Australian Army=== ;Field Corps *I Australian Corps *II Australian Corps *III Australian Corps *ANZAC CorpsEwer, Peter (2008).
