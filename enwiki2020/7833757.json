He now does his own program as part of the 1517 project discussed below. == Education == Rosenbladt was born in the western part of Washington state and studied psychology in his undergraduate degree at Pacific Lutheran University, Tacoma, Washington, and graduated with the B.A. in 1964. He then studied theology at Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary in Columbus, Ohio, and graduated with a B.D. in 1968. He pursued post-graduate studies in the philosophy of religion at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois, and graduated with an M.A. in 1972. There he was taught by John Warwick Montgomery, and since that time they have been lifelong friends. On Montgomery's advice and recommendation, Rosenbladt then proceeded to doctoral studies in theology at the University of Strasbourg, France, and graduated in 1978 with a Ph.D. == Career == Rosenbladt is a Lutheran minister in the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and assumed pastoral positions in parishes in Huntington Beach, San Gabriel, and La Jolla, California. He has lived in California since 1969 and has held teaching posts at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California (1973\u20131977) and at Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California (1973\u20131977). He was an adjunct member of faculty at Concordia University Irvine from 1979 to 1984, until receiving a permanent lecturer's position in which he has taught theology from 1984 to the present. During the 1980s, he also served as an evening lecturer in the Master of Arts program in Christian apologetics at the Simon Greenleaf School of Law. The school was founded by John Warwick Montgomery. Rosenbladt taught philosophy of religion and systematic theology to the MA students, and supervised various students' dissertations. He left the school at the same time that Montgomery resigned from his position there. Rosenbladt has on various occasions participated in formal public debates on theological and apologetic topics. He is also a frequent contributor to Modern Reformation magazine and a regular participant on the White Horse Inn radio program. On the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday, he was honored with a festschrift, Theologia et Apologia: Essays in Reformation Theology and its Defense Presented to Rod Rosenbladt. In 2014 he helped launch 1517 The Legacy Project, a non-profit initiative built, in part, upon his own work, the work of John Warwick Montgomery, and that of Martin Luther. == Bibliography == * \"The Gospel For Those Broken By The Church,\" Live presentation for South Orange County Outreach (2004). * Christ Alone (Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books, 1999). * \"Reclaiming the Doctrine of Justification,\" Modern Reformation, Vol. 1 No. 6 (Nov/Dec 1992). * \"Are You Prepared to Give a Defense?
