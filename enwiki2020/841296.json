Kakamega is 52 km north of Kisumu, the third largest city in Kenya and a port city on Lake Victoria. The average elevation of Kakamega is 1,535 metres. Kakamega county is Kenya's second most populous county after Nairobi. The county has 9 constituencies in total, namely Butere, Mumias East, Matungu, Khwisero, Shinyalu, Lurambi, ikolomani, Lugari and Malava. Kakamega was so named because the word \"kakamega\" translates roughly to \"pinch\" in Kiluhyah, which was used to describe how European colonists would eat the staple food, ugali. ==Naming== It is often told that Kakamega derives its modern name from the local dialect. The story goes that when European settlers first visited the area now known as Kakamega and were offered maize meal, the local staple food called Obusuma, they tried to emulate the eating style for which the tribe was famous. To the hosts though, the visitors were more like \u2018pinching\u2019 the Obusuma. The resulting administrative area was named \u2018Kakamega\u2019, which roughly translates to \u2018pinch.\u2019 Actually the name is from the former Nandi people who inbabited the area prior to the Luhya. There is a tale that the town was originally inhabited by the Nandi, and when the building started swelling, the Nandi called the area \u201cKokomego\u201d which loosely translate into there is a lot of buildings, in the Nandi dialect. The new inhabitants took the name and coined it into Kakamega. MORRIS KIRUGA. Daily Nation.

As a rainforest, the canopy of the trees has grown into a thin mesh of interlocking top branches that block most sunlight from reaching the ground below, resulting in less vegetation at the ground level. With few bushes along the darkened forest floor, the main obstacle is ancient fallen tree trunks blocking the paths between the standing trees. The German funded project BIOTA East is working in the forest since 2001, whereby firstly forest inventories for all sorts of life forms were performed and the aim is to find strategies for a sustainable use of the forest. More than 400 species of birds have been found in the Kakamega rainforest. The many song birds fill the air with various birdcalls. Kakamega is also home to Africa's largest and most aggressive cobra, the Kakamega forest cobra.
