Opened to the public in 1893, the park originated on the grounds on a country house estate dating from the 16th century. It was created to bring a feel of the countryside into what was a heavily industrial area. The park is situated on a hillside and offers views across the surrounding towns and countryside. Attractions include an adventure playground, an ornamental lake, formal lawns, a walled wildflower garden, sports facilities, a greenhouse and a caf\u00e9. ==References== Category:Parks and open spaces in West Yorkshire ",
