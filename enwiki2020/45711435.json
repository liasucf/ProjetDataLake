    "text": "Food Unwrapped is a 2014 book about the food industry by the British writer Daniel Tapper. It is based on a BBC Channel 4 television series of the same name, and covers food science and food technology in mass-produced foods with the objective of \"dispel[ing] food myths and reveal[ing] some truths about the food we buy\". Subjects covered in the book include the relative merits of sea salt versus table salt; and the harm or lack of harm in artificial food colorings and flavorings. The book's author has also been a contributor to The Guardian and Waitrose Kitchen. In 2013, using knowledge he acquired as a self- taught homebrewer, Tapper opened a brewery producing American Pale Ale style beer (using American Cascade hops). ==References== ==External links== *http://www.lawagency.co.uk/writer/daniel-tapper Category:2014 non-fiction books Category:Books about food and drink Category:British books ",
