    "text": "The Constitution of the State of Hawaii () refers to various legal documents throughout the history of the Hawaiian Islands that defined the fundamental principles of authority and governance within its sphere of jurisdiction. Numerous constitutional documents have been promulgated for the Kingdom of Hawaii, Republic of Hawaii, Territory of Hawaii and State of Hawaii. The first constitution was drafted by Kamehameha III. A few notable constitutions are the Bayonet Constitution of 1887 which stripped King Kalakaua of some decision making abilities without concurrence of his cabinet, and the Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, a replacement of the Bayonet Constitution promulgated by Queen Liliuokalani, which set off a chain of events that eventually resulted in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Other notable documents include the Constitution of 1978 that created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and declared the Hawaiian language to be one of the official languages of the state. ==List of constitutions== *1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1852 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1894 Constitution of the Republic of Hawaii *1950 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention *1959 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention *1968 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention *1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention ==Preamble== The current version of the Constitution of Hawaii features a preamble that states, \"We, the people of the State of Hawaii, grateful for Divine Guidance, and mindful of our Hawaiian heritage, reaffirm our belief in a government of the people, by the people and for the people, and with an understanding heart toward all peoples of the earth do hereby ordain and establish this constitution for the State of Hawaii.\" ==Bill of Rights== The preamble is followed by a twenty-point bill of rights: #All political power of this State is inherent in the people; and the responsibility for the exercise thereof rests with the people.
