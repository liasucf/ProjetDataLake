    "text": "EMBRACE (A European Model for Bioinformatics Research and Community Education) was a project, from year 2005 to 2010, with the objective of drawing together a wide group of experts throughout Europe who are involved in the use of information technology in the biomolecular sciences. The EMBRACE Network have worked to integrate the major databases and software tools in bioinformatics, using existing methods and emerging Grid service technologies. The integration efforts were driven by a set of test problems representing key issues for bioinformatics service providers and end-user biologists. As a result, groups throughout Europe were able to use the EMBRACE service interfaces for their own local or proprietary data and tools. EMBRACE made many bioinformatics web services available to the international research community. The project was run from the EBI in Hinxton, England. Fred Marcus was its EU project coordinator. The EMBRACE project was funded by the European Commission within its FP6 Programme, under the thematic area \"Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health\", contract number LHSG-CT-2004-512092. ==References== ==External links== * http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/74095_en.html Category:Bioinformatics Category:Grid computing ",
