An entrance to these caves (now sealed) was located in the woods near the cemetery. Currently, a marker bearing the names of these three children, James W., Margaret, and J. Howard Lewis, is mounted in the face of the rock-outcropping approximately fifty-yards into the woods on the cemetery property. The magazine Weird NJ recounts that the daughter, Margaret found her way into the cave and got lost. Her two brothers went in to find her and also got lost.Sceurman, Mark and Moran, Mark.
