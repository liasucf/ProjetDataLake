    "text": "Vive Charlie is a British online satirical magazine launched in January 2015 during the immediate aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo massacre. It has no connection to the French title. On 4 June 2015, the cover of Vive Charlie issue 15 was featured in the sport section of the Daily Telegraph. In the article, \"Sepp Blatter resigns: How the world's media reacted to shock announcement\", Vive Charlie was included in its choice of the best front and back pages from leading newspapers and magazines around the world. Vive Charlie was co-founded anonymously, using pseudonyms, by the satirist Jihadist Joe and the illustrator Noisykafir. Within the magazine they describe themselves as upholders of freedom of speech and lampoon anyone and anything that deserves ridicule. The majority of the content is provided by JihadistJoe and Noisykafir; however, there are regular and guest contributors. Regular and notable contributors to Vive Charlie include Katie Hopkins, Old Holborn, Robert Spencer, Mark Sparrow and the Lawyers' Secular Society. Vive Charlie includes regular recurring columns, features and comic strips, including Burkapapa, Speech Wars and Muslamic Whispers. The Independent (2 July 2015) reported that Shariawatch, Geert Wilders and Vive Charlie would be hosting a UK Mohammed Drawing Exhibition. The event was to be held in London in September 2015. It was later cancelled due to the threat of violence before a venue was revealed. \\- On 29 February 2016, the cover of issue 25 had an image by Noisykafir titled \"Nanny Jihadeee\", depicting a Muslim woman holding up the severed head of a child. The image was in reference to the murder of Anastasia Meshcheryakova by her nanny Gyulchekhra Bobokulova. The cover was widely reported by Russian media and was condemned as \"evil\" by Russian MPs. \\- == References == Category:Online magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Satirical magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in the United Kingdom ",
