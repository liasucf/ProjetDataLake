    "text": "The 2019 BYU Cougars women's soccer team represents BYU during the 2019 NCAA Division I women's soccer season. The Cougars are coached for a 25th consecutive season by Jennifer Rockwood, who was co-coach in 1995 and became the solo head coach in 1996. Before 1995 BYU women's soccer competed as a club team and not as a member of the NCAA. Overall the Cougars have made the NCAA tournament in 19 of the 24 seasons that Rockwood has been the head coach. Joining Rockwood as assistant coaches are Brent Anderson (3rd season) and Steve Magleby (2nd season) with volunteer assistants Rachel Jorgensen (6th season) and McKinzie Young (8th season). The Cougars came off of a season where they were first in the WCC and went 13\u20135\u20131, 8\u20131\u20130 in the WCC. The Cougars were picked to finish as co-champs by the WCC media. == Media == === Television & Internet Streaming === Most BYU women's soccer will have a TV broadcast or internet video stream available. BYUtv and WCC Network (the new name for TheW.tv) will once again serve as the primary providers. Information on these television broadcasts can be found under each individual match. === Nu Skin BYU Sports Network === For a sixth consecutive season the BYU Sports Network will air BYU Cougars women's soccer games. Greg Wrubell will provide play-by-play for most games with Jason Shepherd filling-in when Wrubell has football duties. Analysts will rotate. ESPN 960 and BYU Radio will act as the flagship stations for women's soccer. :Affiliates *BYU Radio- KUMT 107.9 FM *ESPN 960- Provo, Utah == Schedule == :*WCC game (*) :*Nu Skin BYU Sports Network/ESPN 960 broadcast (x) :*Television Broadcast (y) :*Internet Stream (z) === Exhibition: Blue/White Game === *Three 30 minute periods made up the exhibition.
