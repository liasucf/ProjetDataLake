Maury Henry Biddle Paul is credited with coining the phrase \"caf\u00e9 society\" in 1915. Members attended each other's private dinners and balls, and took holidays in exotic locations or at elegant resorts. In the United States, caf\u00e9 society came to the fore with the end of Prohibition in December 1933 and the rise of photojournalism to describe the set of people who tended to do their entertaining semi-publicly\u2014in restaurants and night clubs\u2014and who would include among them movie stars and sports celebrities. Some of the American night clubs and New York City restaurants frequented by the denizens of caf\u00e9 society included the 21 Club, El Morocco, Restaurant Larue, and the Stork Club. ==See also== * 1920s Berlin * Ann\u00e9es folles * Golden Twenties * Jazz Age * Paris between the Wars (1919\u20131939) * Roaring Twenties * Jet set ==Bibliography== * * ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:Social classes Category:Social groups Category:Sociolinguistics Category:Roaring Twenties ",
