    "text": "Human the Death Dance is the third solo studio album by American rapper Sage Francis. It was released on Epitaph Records on May 8, 2007. It peaked at number 97 on the Billboard 200 chart. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 16 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, \"Human the Death Dance may be his most personal effort, but it's also an incredibly well-built full-length -- even when it borrows from a handful of genres -- and it's arguably his best lyrical effort, undoubtedly his best production-wise.\" Roque Strew of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.9 out of 10, saying, \"'Going Back to Rehab' weaves allusions to the greats, Nas and Biggie, into a six-minute tapestry that encompasses everything great about Sage Francis's strongest album to date: Its neon rainbow of tones and moods, the almost telepathic harmony between producer and rapper, the riveting fault-line tiptoe between memoir and manifesto.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * Sage Francis \u2013 vocals, arrangement, executive production * Odd Nosdam \u2013 production (2) * Mr. Cooper \u2013 production (3) * Buck 65 \u2013 production (4) * Mark Isham \u2013 production (5, 11) * Alias \u2013 production (6, 7, 10) * Sixtoo \u2013 production (8) * Ant \u2013 production (9) * Big Cats! \u2013 production (12) * Kurtis SP \u2013 production (13) * Miles Bonny \u2013 production (14) * Reanimator \u2013 production (15), turntables (3, 15, 16) * Jolie Holland \u2013 fiddle (4), vocals (4, 12) * Nathan Harrop \u2013 harmonica (4) * Eaters \u2013 vocals (6) * Christopher Sneddon \u2013 synthesizer (6) * B.
