The text is known from several manuscripts which are from the early 1600s. It was probably written by an author in the east of Iceland and is a sequel to Hrafnkels saga. The saga revolves around the lives and times of the residents of the Flj\u00f3tsdalur region in Iceland, including Helge \u00c5sbj\u00f8rnsson (Helgi \u00c1sbjarnarson) and of Grim (Gr\u00edmr) and Helge (Helgi), two sons of the widow Droplaug, a pair of brothers who have their own saga, Droplaugarsona saga. ==Translations== *The Saga of the People of Fljotsdal.
