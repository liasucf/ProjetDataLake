It was held at the Vines Resort in Western Australia from 1990 to 2001 and moved to the Royal Melbourne Golf Club from 2002 to 2005. From 1996 onwards it was co-sanctioned by the European Tour. In 2005 it was the most lucrative golf tournament in Australasia, but the 2006 event was cancelled after the sponsor withdrew and the promoters were unable to find a replacement. This was one of a series of tournaments to be cancelled in Australia within the space of a few years. The winners of the Heineken Classic included former World Number 1s Ernie Els and Ian Woosnam and future U.S. Open champion Michael Campbell. ==Winners== ;European Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia event (1996\u20132005) {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%\" !Year!!Winner!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Margin of victory!!Runner(s)-up |- | 2005 || Craig Parry || ||align=center|270 ||align=center|\u221214 || Playoff || Nick O'Hern |- | 2004 || Ernie Els (3) || ||align=center|268 ||align=center|\u221220 || 1 stroke || Adam Scott |- | 2003 || Ernie Els (2) || ||align=center|273 ||align=center|\u221215 || 1 stroke || Nick Faldo Peter Lonard |- | 2002 || Ernie Els || ||align=center|271 ||align=center|\u221217 || 5 strokes || Peter Fowler David Howell Peter O'Malley |- | 2001 || Michael Campbell (2) || ||align=center|270 ||align=center|\u221218 || 5 strokes || David Smail |- | 2000 || Michael Campbell || ||align=center|268 ||align=center|\u221220 || 6 strokes || Thomas Bj\u00f8rn |- | 1999 || Jarrod Moseley || ||align=center|274 ||align=center|\u221214 || 1 stroke || Ernie Els Bernhard Langer Peter Lonard |- | 1998 || Thomas Bj\u00f8rn || ||align=center|280 ||align=center|\u22128 || 1 stroke || Ian Woosnam |- | 1997 || Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn || ||align=center|273 ||align=center|\u221215 || 1 stroke || Fred Couples |- | 1996 || Ian Woosnam || ||align=center|277 ||align=center|\u221211 || 1 stroke || Paul McGinley Jean van de Velde |} ;PGA Tour of Australasia event (1990\u20131995) {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%\" !Year!!Winner!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Margin of victory!!Runner(s)-up |- !colspan=7|Heineken Classic |- | 1995 || Robert Allenby || ||align=center|278 ||align=center|\u221210 || 1 stroke || Wayne Smith |- | 1994 || Michael Clayton || ||align=center|279 ||align=center|\u22129 || 3 strokes || Wayne Smith |- | 1993 || Peter Senior || ||align=center|275 ||align=center|\u221213 || 3 strokes || Michael Campbell |- !colspan=7|Vines Classic |- | 1992 || Ian Baker-Finch || ||align=center|276 ||align=center|\u221212 || 1 stroke || Jeff Maggert Frank Nobilo |- | 1991 || Blaine McCallister || ||align=center|278 ||align=center|\u221210 || 1 stroke || Wayne Grady Greg Turner |- | 1990 || Jeff Maggert || ||align=center|281 ||align=center|\u22127 || 1 stroke || Brett Ogle |} ==References== ==External links== *Coverage on the European Tour's official site Category:Former PGA Tour of Australasia events Category:Former European Tour events Category:Golf tournaments in Australia Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1990 Category:Recurring events disestablished in 2005 Category:1990 establishments in Australia Category:2005 disestablishments in Australia ",
