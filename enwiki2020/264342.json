The jump is guide-cable-controlled to prevent jumpers from colliding with the tower in case of wind gusts.SkyJump (from the official skyjump.co.nz website. Accessed 21 June 2008.) Climbs into the antenna mast portion ( heights) are also possible for tour groups, as is a walk around the exterior.SkyWalk (from the official skywalk.co.nz website. Accessed 27 May 2009.) ==Telecommunications== The tower is also used for telecommunications and broadcasting with the Auckland Peering Exchange (APE) being located on Level 48.What is the APE? Retrieved 5 June 2009 The aerial at the top of the tower hosts the largest FM combiner in the world which combines with 58 wireless microwave links located above the top restaurant to provide a number of services. These include television, wireless internet, RT, and weather measurement services. The tower is Auckland's primary FM radio transmitter, and is one of four infill terrestrial television transmitters in Auckland, serving areas not covered by the main transmitter at Waiatarua in the Wait\u0101kere Ranges. A total of twenty-three FM radio stations and six digital terrestrial television multiplexes broadcast from the tower. Two VHF analogue television channels broadcasting from the tower were switched off in the early hours of Sunday 1 December 2013 as part of New Zealand's digital television transition. ===Transmission frequencies=== The Sky Tower dominates the Auckland skyline, viewed from Waitemat\u0101 Harbour.

Harrison GriersonHarrison Grierson provided surveying services. It was designed by Gordon Moller of Craig Craig Moller architects and has received a New Zealand Institute of Architects National Award as well as regional awards.Sky Tower (from the website of Craig Craig Moller, Sky Tower's architects)Case Studies: Sky Tower (from the University of Auckland, Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering. Retrieved 1 December 2007.) The Project Architect was Les Dykstra., Les Dykstra - Director of Architects-ldl. Taking two years and nine months to construct, the tower was opened on 3 August 1997. ===Facts and figures=== Glass flooring seen inside one of the observation decks The tower is constructed of high-performance reinforced concrete. Its diameter shaft (containing four lifts and an emergency stairwell) is supported on eight \"legs\" based on 16 foundation piles drilled over deep into the local sandstone.Projects: Commercial: Sky Tower (from the Fletcher Construction website. Retrieved 2 December 2007.) The main shaft was built using climbing formwork. The upper levels were constructed from composite materials, structural steel, precast concrete and reinforced concrete, and the observation decks clad in aluminium with blue/green reflective glass. A structural steel framework supports the upper mast structure. During construction of concrete, of reinforcing steel, and of structural steel were used. The mast weighs over .Construction Facts (from the SkyCity Auckland website) It had to be lifted into place using a crane attached to the structure, as it would have been too heavy for a helicopter to lift. To then remove the crane, another crane had to be constructed attached to the upper part of the Sky Tower structure, which dismantled the big crane, and was in turn dismantled into pieces small enough to fit into the elevator. ===Safety=== The tower is designed to withstand wind in excess of and designed to sway up to in excessively high winds. As a safety precaution the Sky Tower's lifts have special technology installed to detect movement (such as swaying due to high wind) and will automatically slow down. If the building sway exceeds predetermined safety levels the lifts will return to the ground floor and remain there until the high winds and building sway have abated.\"Some homes still powerless after storm\". The New Zealand Herald, Friday 10 November 2006. The Sky Tower is built to withstand an 8.0 magnitude earthquake located within a radius. There are three fireproof rooms on levels 44, 45, and 46 to provide refuge in the event of an emergency, while the central service lift shaft and stairwells are also fire-safety rated. ==Lighting== The tower illuminated in Christmas colours. Various other lighting schemes and colours are also used. SkyCity Auckland lights the Sky Tower to show support for a range of organisations and charities. Common lighting events include: * Blue = Auckland Blues * Pink = Breast Cancer Awareness Month/Mother's Day * Red & Green = 'Kidz First' Childrens Hospital/Christmas * Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Gold & White = New Year's Eve * Red & Gold = Chinese New Year * Blue & Green = Starship Children's Foundation/Earth Day * Orange = Auckland Festival/40 Hour Famine * Green & Purple = The Auckland Cup * Red, White & Pink = Valentines Day * Green = St. Patrick's Day * Red = ANZAC Day (with Poppy emblem projection) * Green, Red & White = Rally New Zealand * Gold = New Zealand Olympic Team (if a player wins gold in each Olympics) * Blue & Red space = Matariki * Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Purple = Pride Month * Blue & Orange = Easter * Blue, White & Red = Waitangi Day * Orange, Purple & Green = Halloween * Green base and yellow top = Daffodil Day (Cancer Society New Zealand)/FIFA World Cup * Red and white = M\u0101ori Language Week * White = White ribbon awareness * No lighting (except aircraft warning lights) = Earth Hour/Memorial Day/Death of the Head of State, the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, any Governmental member or important people ===Energy efficient lighting=== The top half of the Sky Tower is lit by energy efficient LED lighting which replaced the original metal halide floodlights in May 2009. The LEDs can produce millions of different colour combinations controlled by a DMX lighting controller. The original lights used 66 per cent more energy than the current LED system. The bottom half is lit by metal halide lamps. The lighting on Sky Tower was upgraded in 2019 to LED lighting.https://skycityauckland.co.nz/sky-tower/lighting/ ===Energy conservation initiatives=== During the winter months, electricity consumption in New Zealand increases dramatically. As much of the power reserve in the country depends on the water level of the hydro-lakes, various power-saving schemes are introduced to prevent blackouts. In an effort to promote power saving, SkyCity turned off the tower lighting in Winter 2008, retaining only the flashing red aviation lights. SkyCity is also minimising fa\u00e7ade flood lighting across its complex. Simon Jamieson, General Manager SKYCITY Auckland Hotels Group, said: \"Like every New Zealander, we are concerned about the country's electricity supply, and we believe it is our responsibility to make this move to assist with the power saving request.\"SKYCITY Auckland switches off the Sky Tower (from a Skycity Entertainment Group press release. 10 June 2008. Accessed 14 September 2008.) The tower was reilluminated on 4 August in support of New Zealand athletes competing at the Beijing Olympics.Sky Tower Relights Auckland Skyline (from a Sky Entertainment Group press release. 4 August 2008. Accessed 14 September 2008.) The SkyTower also use wall lights for different events, for example, they had a LED Santa on the 2007 Christmas. ===Events=== The Sky Tower is used in support of special charity events. The Leukemia and Blood Foundation of New Zealand organises annual fundraising stair climb challenges, notably the \"Firefighters Sky Tower Stair Challenge\" which sees firefighters from around New Zealand race up 1,108 steps (out of 1,267 total steps). Climbing the Sky Tower stairs has been described as a \"vertical marathon\". The Sky Tower is also the venue of the annual \"Tower de Force\" competition. It includes a climb up 1,226 steps (out of 1,267 total steps), and various other military skills tests that change yearly. Participants include the RNZAF, RNZN, New Zealand Army, New Zealand Defence Force veterans, New Zealand Police and, more recently, units from the New Zealand Cadet Forces. The competition is used to raise funds for numerous charities, including in 2019 Mike King's The Key to Life Charitable Trust. ==See also== * List of tallest structures in New Zealand * Macau Tower (inspired by the Sky Tower, designed by the same company) * Sydney Tower (the second tallest observation tower in the Southern Hemisphere) ==References== ==External links== * Sky Tower (official website) * * Explore the Sky Tower (interactive Sky Tower, requires Macromedia Flash) * 360\u00b0 view from tower (from SkyCity Auckland website) * 360\u00b0 view from Sky Deck (from Google) * Orbit 360\u00b0 Dining (official website) * Photographs of the Sky Tower held in Auckland Libraries' heritage collections.
