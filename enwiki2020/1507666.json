Brychan Brycheiniog was a legendary 5th-century king of Brycheiniog (Brecknockshire, alternatively Breconshire)Richard Morgan & R. F. Peter Powell, A Study of Breconshire Place-Names, ( Llanrwst Wells: Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 1999). in South Wales. ==Life== According to Celtic hagiography Brychan was born in Ireland, the son of a Prince Anlach, son of Coronac, and his wife, Marchel, heiress of the Welsh kingdom of Garthmadrun (Brycheiniog), which the couple later inherited. Upon his father's death, he returned to Garthmadrun and changed its name to Brycheiniog.Koch, John T. Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio (15 March 2006) p. 301 Brychan's name may be a Welsh version of the Irish name Brocc\u00e1n and that of his grandfather Coronac may represent Cormac.Thornton, \"Brychan Brycheiniog (fl. c. 500).\" ODNB. Brychan's education was entrusted to one Drichan.Emmanuel, Hywel David. \"Brychan\", Dictionary of Welsh Biography, 1959, National Library of Wales The Life of St. Cadoc by Lifris (c. 1100) portrays Brychan fighting Arthur, Cai and Bedivere because of King Gwynllyw of Gwynllwg's abduction of his daughter St. Gwladys from his court in Talgarth. ==Portraiture and veneration== He is occasionally described as an undocumented saintCatholic Online, \"St Brychan\" but the traditional literature does not call him a saint, referring to him as a patriarch instead, and he has no churches named for him.Orme, Nicholas (2000) The Saints of Cornwall Oxford: Oxford University Press (6 January 2000) p. 77 A 15th-century stained glass window in the parish church at St Neot in Cornwall, supposedly depicts Brychan, seated and crowned, holding in his arms eleven children. This, however, has been described by a standard modern guide as \"God with Souls in his lap\".Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed., revised by Enid Radclife. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 198 ==Children of Brychan== According to Christian tradition, Brychan was married three times \u2013 to Prawst ferch Tydwal, Banhadlwedd ferch Banadi, and Gwladys \u2013 and had a very large family. These wives are mentioned in several manuscripts, including those by William Worcester, John Leland, and Nicholas Roscarrock. The number of children attributed to him varies from twelve to sixty-three, the number most frequently encountered being twenty-four. There are two main lists however, one of Welsh origin and one of Cornish origin. Most of his children appear to have travelled from Brecon to evangelise Cornwall and North Devon, where they are now venerated, but there is little agreement between the two lists. The number of Brychan's children may have grown over time, as more and more secular people as well as saints wished to claim descent from one of the \"Holy Families of Britain\". Listed below are children from Welsh, Cornish, Irish, and Breton sources: ===Sons in Welsh sources=== The sons listed in the Cognacio Brychan, De Situ Brecheniauc and the genealogies of Jesus College MS 20 are Cynog, Rhain Dremrudd, Clydwyn, Arthen, Papai, Dingad, Berwyn and Rhydog.
