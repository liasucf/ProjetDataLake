    "text": "The following 46 films, all from different countries, were submitted for the 67th Academy Awards in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film which took place in 1995. The bolded titles were the five nominated films, which came from Belgium, Cuba, Macedonia, Taiwan and the eventual winner, Burnt by the Sun, from Russia. Belarus, Bosnia, Cambodia, Guatemala, Macedonia and Serbia submitted films to the competition for the first time. Also for the first time, films from both the Czech and Slovak Republics competed against each other, although neither was nominated. It was also the first time that all five of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia all entered the race separately. Polish director Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski originally had two films in the race when Poland and Switzerland entered two of his Three Colors trilogy. An early favorite, Switzerland's Red was disqualified in a controversial Academy ruling which determined that although Red was co- produced by the Swiss national film board and although it took place in Switzerland and featured a largely Swiss cast, it qualified as a majority French, and not Swiss, production. Miramax Films appealed to the Academy to change its mind, but to no avail. However, it was eligible in other categories and received three nominations: Best Director; Best Cinematography and Best Original Screenplay. Poland's White screened alongside the other films but did not make the final five. ==Submissions== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\" |- !
