    "text": "The 2008 Washington Kastles season was the inaugural season of the franchise in World TeamTennis (WTT). The Kastles finished fifth in WTT's Eastern Conference with 6 wins and 8 losses and failed to qualify for the postseason. ==Season recap== ===Founding of franchise=== The founding of the Washington Kastles as an expansion franchise was announced by WTT CEO/commissioner Ilana Kloss on February 14, 2008. The team was founded by a group led by venture capitalist and entrepreneur Mark Ein, a resident of the Washington metropolitan area. At the press conference announcing the team's creation, Ein said, \"I am thrilled to bring World TeamTennis to our area. WTT tennis is great entertainment emphasizing fan interaction, and it is the only major sport with men and women playing together on the same team. The Washington Kastles season will be an exciting summertime addition to our local economy and a fun activity for our entire community.\" The team was named after Kastle Systems, LLC, a provider of building and office security systems, of which Ein was the majority owner and managing member. The Kastles became the first franchise in WTT history to be based in Washington. ===Drafts=== Serena Williams became the first player in history to sign with the Kastles, when she was selected by the team in the first round of the WTT Marquee Player Draft on March 19, 2008. In the Roster Player Draft on April 1, 2008, the Kastles selected Justin Gimelstob, Sacha Jones, Scott Oudsema and Mashona Washington. ===Kastles get a home=== At a press conference on April 30, 2008, that included Kastles owner Mark Ein, WTT CEO/commissioner Ilana Kloss, WTT co- founder Billie Jean King and Washington mayor Adrian Fenty, the Kastles announced plans for the construction of a temporary 2,020-seat stadium on the parking lot on which CityCenterDC was expected to be built in the future. The Washington Convention Center had formerly stood on the site. The temporary stadium was to feature both courtside premium box seating and affordable bleachers close to the action. Located at 11th and H Streets, the stadium could be reached by fans using the Washington Metro. After extolling the virtues of the stadium and its location, Ein said, \"We\u2019re going to take this parking lot and turn it into a home worth defending.\" The team announced that season tickets as well as three-match packages that included the inaugural home match in which Serena Williams was scheduled to appear and visits by John McEnroe and the New York Sportimes and by Anna Kournikova and the St. Louis Aces were on sale. Ein said that the Kastles were committed to integrating charitable and community-based initiatives into all of their activities. There would be a designated charity beneficiary for each home match, and the Kastles planned to host community-based programs at the stadium. The team expected to provide internship and volunteer opportunities for area youth. The Kastles planned to give away more than 1,000 tennis racquets to local children attending their matches and at community clinics sponsored by the team. ===Gimelstob suspension=== Justin Gimelstob appeared on The Junkies, a local radio sports and lifestyle talk show, in June 2008. During an hour-long interview, Gimelstob made several disparaging comments about female tennis players. He said, \"Female tennis players lack the social skills. They don\u2019t go to high school; they don\u2019t go to parties.\" Gimelstob used the term \"sexpot\" to describe both Tatiana Golovin and Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. He commented that there were fewer lesbians on the women's tour than there had been 15 years earlier \"because they're all Russian chicks, and there are some cute ones out there.\" Regarding Anna Kournikova of the St. Louis Aces, alongside whom he once trained, Gimelstob said, \"She's a bitch. Hate's a very strong word. I just despise her to the maximum level just below hate.\" Looking ahead to his upcoming meeting on the court with Kournikova in mixed doubles, Gimelstob said that he wanted to hit her hard in the midriff when serving in her direction. He added, \"If she\u2019s not crying by the time she walks off the court, then I did not do my job.\" Asked by the hosts if he would ever date Kournikova, Gimelstob responded, \"Definitely not. I have no attraction to her. She has a great body but her face is a five. I really have no interest in her ... I wouldn\u2019t mind having my younger brother, who\u2019s a kind of a stud, nail her and then reap the benefits of that.\" Following Gimelstob's comments, on June 25, 2008, WTT suspended him for one match without pay for violating the league's player code of conduct. In a statement released by the league, Gimelstob apologized and said that there was no excuse for his comments. He expressed \"heartfelt remorse\" and said that his comments did not represent who he is and the respect he has for women. Gimelstob said that he would be making a donation to the Women's Sports Foundation with the hope that positive action can speak louder than his words. On July 3, 2008, the Kastles signed Vince Spadea as a substitute player to replace Gimelstob in their inaugural match. ===Season- opening road trip=== The Kastles met the Philadelphia Freedoms in their inaugural match on July 4, 2008, at the King of Prussia mall in Upper Merion Township, Pennsylvania. Vince Spadea was the first player on the court for the Kastles, and he won the opening set of men's singles, 5\u20133. Mashona Washington followed with a 5\u20133 set win in women's singles. After Spadea teamed with Scott Oudsema to take the third set of men's doubles, the Kastles had a 15\u20139 lead. The Freedoms won the fourth set of women's doubles in a tiebreaker and followed by taking the final set of mixed doubles, 5\u20133, to send the match to overtime with the Kastles leading, 22\u201319. Washington and Oudsema won the first game of overtime to seal the Kastles' victory. The following day, the Kastles signed Tripp Phillips as a substitute player to fill in for Justin Gimelstob for their match in Delaware that evening. Gimelstob was unavailable, because he was working as a television analyst at Wimbledon. Washington and Oudsema carried the Kastles to their second straight win to start the season. They opened the match with a 5\u20132 set win in mixed doubles. Oudsema teamed with Phillips in the third set of men's doubles for a 5\u20133 set win. Washington paired with Sacha Jones to take the fourth set of women's doubles in a tiebreaker that gave the Kastles an 18\u201314 lead. After Oudsema dropped the final set of men's singles to cut the Kastles' lead to 20\u201319, he won the first game of overtime to clinch a 21\u201319 triumph over the Delaware Smash. ===Home opener=== The Kastles inaugural match at home was the climax of an all-day event. The team conducted a youth tennis clinic at Kastles Stadium, and Serena Williams, fresh off a loss in the Wimbledon Ladies' Final to her sister, Venus, and a transatlantic flight arrived about an hour late. She participated in the clinic for 19 minutes, giving advice about both tennis and life and hitting volleys with some of the 50 children present. After an interview with the Tennis Channel, Williams held a press conference for the 20 reporters on hand, who quizzed her about the loss to her sister. Later in the day, Williams stopped by the Kastles VIP tent to speak with the guests. Kastles owner Mark Ein joined the sellout crowd, taking his courtside seat, flanked by Washington mayor Adrian Fenty and WTT co-founder Billie Jean King, prepared to watch his undefeated team. However, when the players hit the court, the visiting Boston Lobsters quickly erased the festive mood. In the opening set of men's doubles, Amir Hadad and Jan-Michael Gambill thumped Scott Oudsema and Justin Gimelstob, who was making his season debut, 5\u20131. Williams and Gimelstob followed by dropping the second set of mixed doubles, 5\u20132. After Gimelstob lost the third set of men's singles in a tiebreaker, the Lobsters had a 15\u20137 lead. Williams and Mashona Washington managed to take the fourth set of women's doubles in a tiebreaker to cut the lead to 19\u201312. Williams converted a break point in the sixth game and won the closing set of women's singles, 5\u20132, over Marie-\u00c8ve Pelletier to send the match to overtime with the Lobsters leading, 21\u201317. Williams won the first two overtime games, before Pelletier held serve in the third to secure a 22\u201319 victory for the Lobsters. On the day of their home opener, the Kastles announced they had signed Robby Ginepri as a substitute player to fill in for Gimelstob on July 11, 2008. ===First home victory sparks a winning streak=== After their home debut, the Kastles embarked on a two- match New York road trip and lost to both the New York Buzz and the New York Sportimes. The Kastles returned home to face the Buzz on July 11, 2008, looking to secure their first home victory and break their three-match losing streak, having dropped all three matches in which Serena Williams appeared. After the Kastles dropped the opening set, Sacha Jones and Mashona Washington evened the match at 8 all with a 5\u20133 set win in women's doubles. The Buzz took the next two sets and held an 18\u201313 lead heading to the final set of men's singles. Robby Ginepri, making his Kastles debut, won the set, 5\u20133, over Nathan Healey to send the match to overtime. Ginepri then won three straight overtime games over Healey to tie the match at 21 all and force a super tiebreaker. Ginepri completed the dramatic comeback by taking the super tiebreaker, 7\u20134, to give the Kastles their first home victory in franchise history. The following day, the Kastles announced they had signed Kevin Kim as a substitute player to replace Justin Gimelstob in their July 13 match at Newport Beach. Williams and Kim were the key players in the Kastles' victory over the Newport Beach Breakers. They opened the match with a 5\u20132 set win in mixed doubles. After the Breakers took both the women's and men's doubles sets, they held a 12\u20138 lead. Williams dominated Lilia Osterloh, 5\u20130, in women's singles to put the Kastles in front, 13\u201312. Kim faced eventual 2008 WTT Male Most Valuable Player Ram\u00f3n Delgado in the final set of men's singles. Delgado entered the match leading WTT in men's singles winning percentage having taken 31 of 47 games played and had not yet dropped a set in the event all season. Delgado went up a break in the set and pushed to a 4\u20131 lead while giving the Breakers a 16\u201314 lead in the match. Kim used strong baseline play to hold in the sixth game, break back in the seventh and hold in the eighth game. The set went to a tiebreaker with the Kastles leading, 17\u201316. Kim won the set tiebreaker, 5\u20132, to avoid the super tiebreaker and give the Kastles an 18\u201316 win. ==Event chronology== * February 14, 2008: WTT announced the founding of the Washington Kastles to begin play in the 2008 season. * March 19, 2008: The Kastles selected Serena Williams at the WTT Marquee Player Draft. * April 1, 2008: The Kastles selected Justin Gimelstob, Sacha Jones, Scott Oudsema and Mashona Washington at the WTT RosterPlayer Draft. * April 30, 2008: The Kastles announced their home matches would be played in a temporary stadium to be erected on the proposed future site of CityCenterDC. * June 25, 2008: Justin Gimelstob was suspended by WTT for one match without pay for violating the league's player code of conduct. * July 3, 2008: The Kastles signed Vince Spadea as a substitute player. * July 4, 2008: The Kastles defeated the Philadelphia Freedoms, 23\u201319 in overtime, in the inaugural match for the franchise. * July 5, 2008: The Kastles signed Tripp Phillips as a substitute player. * 'July 6, 2008: The Kastles lost the franchise's inaugural home match to the Boston Lobsters, 22\u201319 in overtime. * July 6, 2008: The Kastles signed Robby Ginepri as a substitute player. * July 11, 2008: The Kastles earned the first home win in franchise history, 22\u201321 in a super tiebreaker, over the New York Buzz. * July 12, 2008: The Kastles signed Kevin Kim as a substitute player. ==Draft picks== With 11 teams making selections in WTT's two 2008 drafts, the Kastles, as an expansion team, were assigned the middle pick (sixth) in each round. ===Marquee Player Draft=== In the Marquee Player Draft on March 19, 2008, the Kastles selected Serena Williams in the first round.
