    "text": "Drikung Kagyu Lineage Tree Drikung Kagyu or Drigung Kagyu (Wylie: 'bri-gung bka'-brgyud) is one of the eight \"minor\" lineages of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. \"Major\" here refers to those Kagyu lineages founded by the immediate disciples of Gampopa (1079-1153) while \"minor\" refers to all the lineages founded by disciples of Gampopa's main disciple, Phagmo Drupa (1110-1170). One of these disciples, Jigten Sumg\u00f6n (1143-1217), is the founder of Drikung. == History == Phagmodrupa with His Previous Incarnations and Episodes from His Life, 14th-century painting from the Rubin Museum of Art Jigten Sumgon, founder of Drikung Kagyu Like with all other Kagyu lineages, origins of Drikung Kagyu can be traced back to the Great Indian Master Tilopa who passed on his teachings to Mahasiddha Naropa who lived around 10th and 11th century. The founder of the Drikung Kagyu lineage was Jigten Sumg\u00f6n (1143-1217) of the Kyura clan, who was the disciple of Phagmo Drupa. According to historical account from the time, Jigten Sumg\u00f6n's teachings attracted more than 100,000 people at a time, with the highest number of attendance recorded at 130,000. Several sub-schools branched off from the Drikung Kagyu including the Lhapa or Lhanangpa Kagyu, founded by N\u00f6 Lhanangpa (, 1164\u20131224) who came to Bhutan in 1194. This school was at one time important in Western Bhutan, particularly in the Thimphu and Paro regions, where they were rivals of the Drukpa Kagyu. The Lhapa first came into conflict with the early Drukpa teacher, Phajo Drugom Zhigpo (b. 12th century)see: Dargye and S\u00f8rensen (2001) pp.ix\u2013x, 34\u201336, 41\u201346 and finally with Ngawang Namgyal (1594\u20131651). In 1640 the remaining followers of the Lhapa Kagyu were expelled from Bhutan together with the Nenyingpa followers as both had sided with the attacking Tsangpa forces against the Drukpa during their three invasions of Bhutan and continued to refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Shabdrung.Dorje, Sangay and Kinga (2008) pp.146\u20137. ==Teaching and practice== The unique doctrines of Drikung Kagyu as taught by its founder, Jigten Sumg\u00f6n is preserved in \"The Single Intention\" or \"One thought of Drikung\" (Drikung Gonchik, Wylie: dgongs gcig)For the Gongchig see the blog by Jan-Ulrich Sobisch (Copenhagen University) dgongs1.com. and \"The Essence of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Teachings\" (Wylie: theg chen bstan pa'i snying po). According to Jampa MacKenzie Stewart, the Gonchik \"recasts Buddhism in a fascinating and innovative form, emphasizing each aspect as being capable of revealing the full process of enlightenment.\"Steward, Jampa MacKenzie (2004), The Life of Gampopa, Shambhala, p. 130. The main practices of Drikung Kagyu are \u201cThe Five-fold Profound Path of Mahamudr\u0101,\u201d and \u201cThe Six Dharmas of N\u0101ropa.\u201d The five-fold Mahamudr\u0101, also known as the \"possessing five\", consists of five elements:Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche (2009), The Practice of Mahamudra, Shambhala, pp. 11-12. * Setting the motivation, arousing bodhichitta, * Deity yoga, generating the Yidam. The main deity in Drikung is Chakrasamvara (in union with consort Vajravarahi), but Milarepa taught this method by using Chenrezig. * Guru yoga * Mahamudr\u0101 meditation (Samatha and Vipasyana) * Dedication of merit. This practice is traditionally cultivated in retreat alongside the Six Dharmas of Naropa, and it is preceded by the preliminary practices called ngondro.Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche (2009), The Practice of Mahamudra, Shambhala, pp. 13-14. This presentation is outlined in Clarifying the Jewel Rosary of the Profound Five-Fold Path by Kunga Rinchen, the Dharma heir to Jigten Sumg\u00f6n. The Drikung Kagyu also have a tradition of Dzogchen teachings, the Yangzab Dzogchen.Helmut Krasser, Tibetan studies, International Association for Tibetan Studies. Verlag der \u00d6sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1997 - Tibet (China), page 586 It is based on termas revealed by the Drikung Tert\u00f6n (hidden treasure revealer), Rinchen Phuntsog in the sixteenth century. ===Phowa=== The Drikung lineage is popularly known for its development of the practice of Phowa, in which a practitioner learns how to expel his/her consciousness or mindstream through the posterior fontanelle at the top of the skull at the moment of death. One of the Six Yogas of Naropa, this practice is said to aid the practitioner in remaining aware through the death experience, thus aiding one in attaining enlightenment in the Bardo (the state in between death and the next rebirth) or in achieving a birth conducive to the practice of Dharma. ==Monasteries and centers== A building in Drikung monastery overlooking the valley, Maizhokunggar County, Lhasa, Tibet The first and main Drikung Kagyu monastery is Drikung Thil Monastery,A Brief History of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism founded in 1179 by Jigten Sumg\u00f6n approximately 150 kilometers northeast of Lhasa. Aside from the Drikung Valley in \u00dc, the Drikung Kagyu has a strong presence in Nangq\u00ean County in what was Kham, in western Tibet (including Kailash), and in Ladakh. Tsari and Lapchi - two important sacred sites for all Tibetan Buddhists - also have a strong Drikung Kagyu presence. Among the so-called \"four major and eight minor\" Kagyu lineages, Drikung Kagyu is one of four Kagyu lineages that continue to exist as independent institutions (the other three being the Karma Kagyu, Drukpa Lineage and Taklung Kagyu). Outside of Tibet, the headquarters for the tradition in exile is Jangchubling, located in Dhera Dun, in the Indian state of Uttarakhand.Gruber, Elmar R., From the Heart of Tibet: The Biography of Drikung Chetsang Rinpoche, the Holder of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage, Shambhala Publications, 2010, Foreword by the Dalai Lama. Drikung Kagyu is one of the most prominent lineages in Ladakh where its main monasteries are Phyang and Lamayuru, with roughly 50 other monasteries spread across Ladakh region. A series of Drikung Dharma centers were also founded in the West, a project begun by Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche in 1978.Lewis, James R. The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions, p. 290. ==Lineage notes== ===Spiritual heads=== Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche, the thirty-seventh and current Drikung Kyabgon, the head of the Drikung order From the founding of Drikung Thil Monastery in 1179 to the present day, the Drikung Kagyu lineage has been led by a succession of spiritual heads (\"throne-holders\"). One of the two current heads of the lineage, Drikung Kyabg\u00f6n Chetsang Rinpoche,His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche, Head of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, will visit St. Petersburg September 14-15, 2010 His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang K\u00f6nchok Tenzin Kunzang Thinley Lhundrup (b. 1946), Synopsis the 37th Drikungpa resides at Drikung Kagyu Institute at Dehra Dun, India. The other head of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage, the 36th Drikungpa, Drikung Kyabg\u00f6n Chungtsang Rinpoche, K\u00f6nchok Tenzin Ch\u00f6kyi Nangwa (b. 1942) lives in Lhasa, Tibet.His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chungtsang ===Female protector=== Another unique feature of the Drikung lineage is its female dharmap\u0101la, Achi Chokyi Drolma. The great-grandmother of Jigten Sumg\u00f6n,Achi Chokyi Drolma she prophesied his birth and vowed to protect those in his lineage. She is unusual in that she is both a female protector and an enlightened bodhisattva that can be taken as an i\u1e63\u1e6dadevat\u0101 in meditation practice. She is depicted either sitting on a horse or standing with a kapala in her left hand and a mirror in her right hand.Worldly Protector (Buddhist) - Achi Chokyi Drolma Achi's practice became so popular that she has been included in other lineages, such as the Karma Kagyu. ===First nun=== In 2002 Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, became the first bhikkhuni (a fully ordained Buddhist nun) in the Drikung Kagyu lineage. She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as an abbot in the Drikung Kagyu lineage, having been installed as the abbot of the Vajra Dakini Nunnery (America's first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery, located in Vermont) in 2004.Women Making History ==Drikung Kagyu lineage timeline== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Name !scope=\"col\" width=\"50\" |Date of Birth !scope=\"col\" width=\"50\" |Date of Death !scope=\"col\" width=\"50\" |Year Lineage Holding Begun !scope=\"col\" width=\"50\" |Year Lineage Holding Relinquished |- |Phagmodrupa |1110 |1170 | | |- |Lord Jigten Sumgon |1143 |1217 |1179 |1217 |- |Kenchen Gurawa Tsultrim Dorje |1154 |1221 |1217 |1221 |- |On Rinpoche Sonam Drakpa |1187 |1234 |1221 |1234 |- |Chen-nga Rinpoche Drakpa Jungne |1175 |1255 |1234 |1255 |- |Telo Dorje Drakpa |1210 |1278 |1255 |1278 |- |Thog-khawa Rinchen Senge |1226 |1284 |1278 |1284 |- |Chen-nga tsamchedpa Drakpa Sonam |1238 |1286 |1284 |1286 |- |Dorje Yeshe |1223 |1293 |1286 |1293 |- |Chu-nyipa Dorje Rinchen |1278 |1314 |1293 |1314 |- |Nyer-gyepa Dorje Gyalpo |1283 |1350 |1314 |1350 |- |Nyermyipa Ch\u00f6kyi Gyalpo |1335 |1407 |1350 |1395 |- |Shenyen Dondrup Gyalpo |1369 |1427 |1395 |1427 |- |Dakpo Wang |1395 |According to The Great Kagyu Masters (Gyaltsen, 270) \"he went to Five Peaked Mountain in China and achieved the state of immortality.\" |1427 |1428 |- |Chogyal Rinchen Pal Zangpo |1421 |1469 |1428 |1469 |- |Rinchen Ch\u00f6kyi Gyaltsen |1449 |1484 |1469 |1484 |- |Gyalwang Kunga Rinchen |1475 |1527 |1484 |1527 |- |Gyalwang Rinchen Phuntsok |1509 |1557 |1527 |1534 |- |Rinchen Namgyal Chodak Gyaltsen |1527 |1570 |1565 |1570 |- |Chokyi Namgyal |1557 |1579 |1570 |1579 |- |Tsungme Chogyal Phuntsok |1547 |1602 |1579 |1602 |- |Naro Nyipa Tashi Phuntsok |1574 |1628 |1602 |1615 |- |Jets\u01d6n K\u00f6nchog Rinchen (1st Chetsang) A Brief History of the Drikung Kagyu\"A system of two lineage holders was established, that of the elder (Chetsang) and the younger (Chungtsang) brother.\" They aren't considered brothers by blood, but by lineage.
