In 2012 Ferrario shaved her hair off to raise money and awareness for cancer, alopecia and trichotillomania. She then grabbed the attention of fashion photographer Peter Coulson who photographed Ferrario for his book In My Pants, a charitable publication to raise money and awareness for cancer and the Cancer Council (Australia). In February 2015, Ferrario started a campaign with television presenter Ajay Rochester to end the use of the term \"plus size\" to describe models who are above a US dress size 4 by the modelling industry. Ferrario posted a picture with the caption \"I am a model FULL STOP\" with the hashtag \"#droptheplus\" which gained coverage in the media and was heavily discussed, with mixed, but mostly positive reactions, on social media and within the fashion industry. In 2017 Stefania was amongst the four faces of Melbourne Fashion Week.https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/dont-call-me-plussize-face-of- melbourne-fashion-weeks-bodypositive-plea-20170719-gxe62u.html In an interview with Fuse magazine, Ferrario stated that she is tri-lingual, speaking English, French and Italian and identifies herself as bisexual. ==References== == External links == * * * #droptheplus website Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Australian female models Category:Models from Melbourne Category:Australian people of English descent Category:Australian people of Italian descent Category:People from Canberra Category:LGBT people from Australia Category:Bisexual women Category:LGBT models Category:IMG Models models ",
