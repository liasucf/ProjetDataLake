    "text": "Abdelhak Nouri (; born 2 April 1997) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Nouri operated primarily as an attacking midfielder, but could also be deployed as a winger. A youth product of Eredivisie club Ajax, he played two years of senior football with its reserve team and the first team. He also represented the Netherlands at various youth levels. In July 2017, at age 20, during a pre-season friendly match, Nouri collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrhythmia attack, which left him with severe and permanent brain damage and unable to continue as a footballer. ==Early life== Nouri was born in Amsterdam, and is of Moroccan descent. He made his name as a footballer largely in his youth, attracting attention from multiple publications as a future star. He was named as one of the best 40 youth players in the world by The Guardian in 2014, before he made his professional debut. ==Club career== Nouri was a youth exponent from the academy at Ajax, and made his professional debut for the reserve side, Jong Ajax, on 13 March 2015, in an Eerste Divisie game against VVV Venlo, replacing Danny Bakker after 78 minutes in a 1\u20130 loss. On 21 September 2016, Nouri made his official first-team debut in a KNVB Cup match against Willem II, and scored a goal. His exploits throughout the season for Jong Ajax saw him being gifted the Player of the Season award for the 2016\u201317 season, as well as promotion to the first team for the 2017\u201318 season. ==Collapse== Jan Mulder talks about Nouri in a broadcast from De Wereld Draait Door, 9 January 2018 On 8 July 2017, Nouri collapsed during a friendly match against Werder Bremen, due to cardiac arrhythmia. He was taken to the hospital by a trauma helicopter, and his condition was announced as stable. Five days later, however, Ajax reported that Nouri had suffered severe and permanent brain damage as a direct result of the incident. Nouri eventually left intensive care on 25 July 2017, being able to breathe unaided, but will not be able to play football again. In June 2018, Ajax announced an investigation had found that the medical treatment Nouri received on the field was \"inadequate\", which prompted a lawsuit from Nouri's family against Ajax through the Royal Dutch Football Association's arbitration panel, who stated a failure to resuscitate him with due haste was responsible for causing his brain damage. As of August 2018, Nouri was no longer in a coma and is said to be able to recognise and communicate with members of his family by moving his mouth and eyebrows. In September 2019 Nouri remained in a hospital bed. On 27 March 2020, Nouri's family confirmed that he had awoken from his coma, returned home to his family, and that they were caring for him. Shortly afterwards, Ajax announced they had cancelled Nouri's contract, which was due to automatically renew on 1 July, and that they were in talks with his family about a \"future solution\" for Nouri. === Tributes === Following Nouri's retirement, several tributes were conducted in his honor by Ajax and players at other clubs. In December 2018, Ajax renamed their \"Talent of the Future\" award for Nouri, while a number of Nouri's former Ajax and Dutch teammates, including Justin Kluivert, Philippe Sandler, Amin Younes, Kevin Diks, Jo\u00ebl Veltman and Donny van de Beek have adopted Nouri's shirt number (34) at their new clubs. The club's 34th league championship was dedicated to Nouri by the players, who celebrated with his father during the trophy presentation on 16 May 2019. ==Honours== ===Club=== Ajax * UEFA Europa League: runner-up 2016\u201317 ===Individual=== * Best player of AEGON Future Cup: 2014 * UEFA European Under-19 Championship Team of the Tournament: 2016 *Eerste Divisie Player of the Season: 2016\u201317 ==See also== * List of people who awoke from a coma ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch people of Moroccan descent Category:Footballers from Amsterdam Category:Dutch footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Jong Ajax players Category:AFC Ajax players Category:Eerste Divisie players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Netherlands youth international footballers Category:People with hypoxic and ischemic brain injuries ",
