    "text": "The Battle of London is a 15-minute British propaganda film made in 1941. It chronicles the impact on the capital city of the winter bombing campaign from 7 September 1940 to 10 May 1941 which German historians consider to be the second phase of the Battle of Britain and which both contemporary parlance and subsequent British historians have always called the Blitz. The first scenes are of a quiet, peaceful London, apparently before the Battle, then quickly progresses to the first spate of bombings that the city endured and the spirit of resilience in which Londoners pull together in various ways to keep the city going. The film ends with the stirring cry \"London can take it, and London can give it too!\" == External links == *Complete film at Movieflix Category:1941 films Category:British World War II propaganda films Category:British films Category:British short films Category:Battle of Britain films Category:British black-and-white films ",
