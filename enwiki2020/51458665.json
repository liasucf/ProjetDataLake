A combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including Dormammu and \"certain individuals who live in other dimensions\". Motivated by the loss of his family to become a Master of the Mystic Arts, Kaecilius became disillusioned with what he considered the Ancient One's hypocrisy and it influenced his choice to serve Dormammu by using the same life-extending ritual his former master used to channel the Dark Dimension's energy. Believing in Dormammu's promise of eternal life, Kaecilius and his Zealot followers proceed to destroy the Sanctums so Earth can be consumed by the Dark Dimension. Doctor Strange manages to convince Dormammu to renounce his attack on Earth while having the entity honor his promise to Kaecilius. Dormammu agrees to the terms and drags Kaecilius and his surviving followers into the Dark Dimension. ===Video games=== * Kaecilius appears in the mobile game Marvel: Future Fight. * Kaecilius appears in the mobile game Marvel Avengers Academy. * Kaecilius appears as a boss in the mobile game Marvel Puzzle Quest.
