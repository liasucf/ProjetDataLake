Photophobia is a common symptom of visual snow.\u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus\u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus ==Presentation== Severe or chronic photophobia, such as in migraine or seizure disorder, may result in a person not feeling well with eye ache, headache and/or neck ache. These symptoms may persist for days even after the person is no longer exposed to the offensive light source. Further, once the eyes have become sensitized to the offensive light source (which can occur even in short duration exposures), they may become even more photosensitive with extreme pain occurring upon exposure to light. Chronic photophobia may also adversely impact a person's ability to interact in social settings and the work place. Bright overhead lighting may make shopping a very painful experience for example, or render the patient dysfunctional in the work place. Office lighting intended to allow employees to get their work done may prevent one with photophobia from getting the job done and lead to such person getting fired. The physical and psychological effects of being in constant pain and overwhelmed with bright light that co- workers cannot perceive also stacks the deck heavily against one with photophobia having a successful career or even making a living. As such, photophobia can be a cruel, yet invisible disorder. Cultural factors associating darkness with evil, lack of interest or training among general practitioners or specialists, and a historical lack of medical research interest/support in the area have also tended to stigmatize and isolate photophobia patients, leaving them vulnerable to workplace discrimination or unfair treatment/job loss. ==Causes== Patients may develop photophobia as a result of several different medical conditions, related to the eye, the nervous system, genetic, or other causes. Photophobia may manifest itself in an increased response to light starting at any step in the visual system, such as: *Too much light entering the eye. Too much light can enter the eye if it is damaged, such as with corneal abrasion and retinal damage, or if its pupil(s) is unable to normally constrict (seen with damage to the oculomotor nerve). * Due to albinism, the lack of pigment in the colored part of the eyes (irises) makes them somewhat translucent. This means that the irises can't completely block light from entering the eye. *Overstimulation of the photoreceptors in the retina *Excessive electric impulses to the optic nerve *Excessive response in the central nervous system *Elevated trigeminal nerve tone (as it is sensory nerve to eye, elevated tone makes it over reactive). Elevated trigeminal tone causes elevated substance P which causes hypersensitivity. Often due to jaw misalignment.J Pain Res. 2014; 7: 99\u2013115. Published online 2014 Feb 21.Orofacial pain management: current perspectives; Marcela Romero-Reyes and James M Uyanik Common causes of photophobia include migraine headaches, TMJ, cataracts, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI), or severe ophthalmologic diseases such as uveitis or corneal abrasion. A more extensive list follows: ===Eye-related=== Causes of photophobia relating directly to the eye itself include: * Achromatopsia * Aniridia * Anticholinergic drugs may cause photophobia by paralyzing the iris sphincter muscle. * Aphakia * Blepharitis * Buphthalmos * Cataracts * Coloboma * Cone dystrophy * Congenital abnormalities of the eye * Viral conjunctivitis * Corneal abrasion * Corneal dystrophy * Corneal ulcer * Disruption of the corneal epithelium, such as that caused by a corneal foreign body or keratitis * Ectopia lentis * Endophthalmitis * Eye trauma caused by disease, injury, or infection such as chalazion, episcleritis, keratoconus, or optic nerve hypoplasia * Hydrophthalmos, or congenital glaucoma * Iritis * Isotretinoin has been associated with photophobia * Optic neuritis * Pigment dispersion syndrome * Pupillary dilation (naturally or chemically induced) * Retinal detachment * Scarring of the cornea or sclera * Uveitis ===Nervous-system- related=== Neurological causes for photophobia include: * Autism spectrum disorders * Chiari malformation * Dyslexia * Encephalitis including Myalgic encephalomyelitis * Meningitis *Trigeminal disturbance causes central sensitization (hence, multiple other associated hypersensitivities. Causes can be bad bite, infected tooth, etc.J Pain Res. 2014; 7: 99\u2013115.

If the triggering factor or underlying cause can be identified and treated, photophobia may disappear. Tinted glasses are sometimes used. ==Artificial light== People with photophobia may feel eye pain from even moderate levels of artificial light and avert their eyes from artificial light sources. Ambient levels of artificial light may also be intolerable to persons afflicted with photophobia such that they dim or remove the light source, or go into a dimmer lit room, such a one lit by refraction of light from outside the room. Alternatively, they may wear dark sunglasses, sunglasses designed to filter peripheral light, and/or wide-brimmed sun hat or a baseball caps. Some types of photophobia may be helped with the use of precision tinted lenses which block the green-to-blue end of the light spectrum without blurring or impeding vision.Katz, Bradley J., and Kathleen B. Digre. \"Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of photophobia.\" Survey of Ophthalmology (2016). Other strategies for relieving photophobia include the use of tinted contact lenses and/or the use of prescription eye drops that constrict the pupil, thus reducing the amount of light entering the eye. Such strategies may be limited by the amount of light needed for proper vision under given conditions, however. Dilating drops may also help relieve eye pain from muscle spasms or seizure triggered by lighting/migraine, allowing a person to \"ride out the migraine\" in a dark or dim room. A paper by Stringham and Hammond, published in the Journal of Food Science, reviews studies of effects of consuming Lutein and Zeaxanthin on visual performance, and notes a decrease in sensitivity to glare. ==Disability== Photophobia may preclude or limit a person from working in places where offensive lighting is virtually ubiquitous (e.g., big box stores, airports, libraries, hospitals, warehouses, offices, workshops, classrooms, supermarkets and storage spaces), unless the person is able to obtain a reasonable accommodation like being allowed to wear tinted glasses when the employee dress code prohibits such glasses otherwise (which may be required to be provided by an employer under the Americans with Disabilities Act). Some people with photophobia may be better able to work at night, or be more easily accommodated in the work place at night. Outdoor night lighting may be equally offensive for persons with photophobia, however, given the wide variety of bright lighting used for illuminating residential, commercial and industrial areas, such as LED lamps.Guide to Photophobia/Light Sensitivity, axonoptics.com.
