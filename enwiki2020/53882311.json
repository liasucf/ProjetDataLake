Little Lungs in a Great Big World is a stop-motion animated tragicomedy public service announcement series that is part of a campaign for the FDA Center for Tobacco Products by FCB named \"The Real Cost.\" The advertisements, released on March 15, 2017, were directed by British animator Peter Sluszka and produced by New York City studio Hornet. The commercials follow a set of anthropomorphic young lungs named Little Lungs that \"smoked as a teen and never grew to normal size.\"Oster, Erik (March 15, 2017). \"FCB New York Introduces \u2018Little Lungs\u2019 to Show \u2018The Real Cost\u2019 of Smoking for the FDA\". AgencySpy. Mediabistro. Retrieved April 24, 2017. Little Lungs tries to enjoy leisure activities with his friends but always ends up facing horrific consequences in his attempts to do so. FCB's approach towards animated entertainment for PSAs was a deviation from most anti-smoking advertisements that they felt were \"overplayed warnings\" most teenagers ignored. ==List of advertisements== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! style=\"background:#1E5994; color:white;\" scope=\"col\"| Title ! style=\"background:#1E5994; color:white;\" scope=\"col\"| Summary |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Snowboard\" |Little Lungs snowboards with his friends on a snowy mountain, but he can't get enough air to control where's he going which leads him to impale on a moose's horns. |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Birthday\" |During his birthday party, Little Lungs blows very hard to blow out the candles. However, he doesn't have enough air to do so and blows so hard to the point of landing facefirst on the candles, being set on fire, and being blown out of the window by a fire extinguisher. |- !scope=\"row\"|\"P.E.\" |During gym class, Little Lungs climbs a rope but gets to a point where he doesn't have enough air to climb further and ultimately falls down, severely burning on the fabric of the rope to the point where he splits apart. |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Pool\" |Little Lungs gets tragically eaten by a shark for not being able to swim fast enough out of a pool. |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Bike\" |Little Lungs rides his bike with his friends, but the slope of a road he is riding on is too much for his amount of breathe to handle. This leads him to roll down so fast that he falls off his bike to the front lawn of a house where is he is shredded by a lawnmower. |} ==Concept and analysis== The scenarios Little Lungs goes through in the advertisements reflect those of the leisure activities teenagers commonly do. As David Gianatasio of Adweek wrote, \"Teens want to enjoy fun activities and be accepted by their peers. The notion that smoking might ruin their leisure time or social lives could make some think twice before lighting up.\" In the words of FCB chief creative officer Ari Halper, Little Lungs was meant to be a \"character people could fall in love with and root for, even if doing so proved to be a lost cause.\" He said that the PSAs intended to move away from \"overplayed warnings\" most teenagers ignored in favor of \"disarmingly entertaining animated shorts.\u201d The Little Lungs advertisements have a distasteful comedy style similar to shows such as Robot Chicken and South Park that are heavily watched by the teenage demographic the PSAs are aimed at.Gianatasio, David (March 16, 2017). \"An Adorable, Shriveled Pair of Smoker\u2019s Lungs Live a Comically Miserable Life in FDA\u2019s New Ads\".
