    "text": "2 gauge (also called II gauge) is a model railway gauge originally , then standardised in 1909 at , a 20% reduction and a change in definition: from mm to inch. It has since fallen into disuse. The gauge was introduced by M\u00e4rklin at the Leipzig toy fair in 1891. 2 gauge was equivalent to a 1:22.5 scale. ==Related scales and gauges== After the change to in 1909, gauge was standardised as 3 gauge (or III gauge). European G gauge trains are built to the same II gauge scale, but with a narrow rail gauge of (the same as 1 gauge). This G gauge at 1:22.5 scale represents narrow-gauge railways. This scale-gauge combination is sometimes called IIm in European literature. In the UK, No 2 Gauge was while No 3 gauge was . From this, it follows that G gauge is sometimes, albeit rarely, referred to as 3m. A gauge of standard gauge locos gives a scale of 1:28.25, not so far off the 1/29 used by some manufactures with gauge track. In the grand tradition of model rail gauges often being narrower than the full scale equivalent (00 scale being the classic example) this is deemed perfectly acceptable. ==References== * Model Railways and Locomotives Magazine Vol. 1 No 8 August 1909 ==See also== *Rail transport modelling scales Category:Model railroad scales ",
