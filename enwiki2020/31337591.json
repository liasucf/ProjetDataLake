Systematic Botany 33(4), 719-731. ==Description== The defining morphological features of the Stipeae include single-flowered spikelets lacking a rachilla extension, and the lemmas (the external bract) have either a sharp point or a terminal awn (long bristle).Cialdella AM, Giussani LM, Aagesen L, Zuloaga FO, Morrone O (2007) A phylogeny of Piptochaetium (Poaceae : Pooideae : Stipeae) and related genera based on a combined analysis including trnL-F, rp116, and morphology. Systematic Botany 32(3), 545-559. ==Genera== The tribe includes 28 genera: Many species initially placed into Stipa have now been split off into new genera.
