She is also a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2015. == Research == Mazzucato's research focuses on the relationship between financial markets, innovation and economic growth \u2013 at the company, industry and national level. She works within the Schumpeterian framework of evolutionary economics, studying the origin and evolution of persistent differences between firms and how these differences vary across sectors and over the industry life-cycle. Her empirical studies have focused on the automobile, PC, biotech and pharma industries. Her most recent work has analyzed the co-evolution of technological change and stock market bubbles. In this, she claims that stock price volatility tends to be highest at the firm and industry level, when technological innovation is the most \"radical\". In 2013 Mazzucato published The Entrepreneurial State: debunking public vs. private sector myths (Anthem). The ideas in the book were first set out in a shorter pamphlet for the think tank Demos, called The Entrepreneurial State. The 2013 book argues that the idea of the State as a static bureaucratic organisation only needed to \u2018fix\u2019 market failures, leaving dynamic entrepreneurship and innovation to the private sector, is wrong. She outlines a number of case studies across different sectors, including biotech, pharmaceuticals and clean technology, to show that the high-risk investments are being made by the state before the private sector gets involved. In a chapter examining the iPhone, she outlines how the technologies that make it \u2018smart\u2019 \u2013 the internet, GPS, its touchscreen display and the voice-activated Siri \u2013 were all Government funded. Two chapters in the book are dedicated to the emerging \u2018green technology\u2019 revolution. She details the public funds that she argues are laying the groundwork for this revolution in a similar way that the state invested in the most high-risk areas of biotech and nanotech. The book concludes with the author's contention that in all these examples, the risks were socialized while the rewards were privatized, and considers different ways to change this dynamic to produce more \u2018inclusive growth\u2019. In 2015 a US edition was published by PublicAffairs that included a new introduction. Her 2015 article in Foreign Affairs provides a summary of the book and outlines its implications for the public sector sharing not only risks, but also rewards.\"\u2018The Innovative State\u2019\", Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb 2015 She has also focused on inequality in her work with William Lazonick (Professor and Director of the University of Massachusetts Center for Industrial Competitiveness). Their joint article, \"The Risk-Reward Nexus: Who takes the risks? Who gets the rewards?\" for a special issue of Corporate and Industrial Change, edited by Mazzucato, describes the tension between how value is created and how value is extracted in modern-day capitalism. The authors argue that there is a disproportionate balance between the 'collective' distribution of risk taking in the innovation process, and the increasingly narrow distribution of the rewards. The paper was first published in a 2012 paper for the think tank Policy Network.M. (2012), Policy Network, The Risk-Reward Nexus: The Risk-Reward Nexus: Innovation, Finance and Inclusive Growth Similarly, in another paper for the think tank Policy Network called \"Rebalancing What?\", Mazzucato argues that the problem is not only one of short-termism, it is also about the way in which financial activities focused on value extraction have been rewarded above activities focused on value creation \u2013 often leading to value destruction.Mazzucato, M. (2012), Policy Network, Rebalancing What?: Reforming finance for creative destruction not destructive creation In her recent work, since 2014, Mazzucato has developed her critique of \"market failure theory\" and her concept of the state's role in the economy as one of \"creating and shaping new markets\" rather than just fixing them. Her work with Carlota Perez has considered how such a view can enable a new understanding of \u2018green\u2019 as a redirection of the entire economy. Her work with Caetano Penna has focussed on the way in which a mission oriented market shaping framework can provide a new understanding of the role of state investment banks. Her new book The Value of Everything: making and taking in the global economy was published in April 2018 in the UK by Penguin (Allen Lane), and was launched in the US in September 2018 by Public Affairs. It has been shortlisted for this year's Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year prize. == Awards and nominations == In 2013, Mazzucato's book Entrepreneurial State was listed in Financial Times Selection of Books of the Year. The book also won her the New Statesman/SPERI Prize in Political Economy in the next year. In 2014, she was nominated for the IPEG Book Prize and the Industry & Innovation DRUID Award for Best Paper for her novel thinking in understanding the roles of the state in public policy and innovation. In the same year, a German translation of The Entrepreneurial State (Das Kapital des Staates) was shortlisted for the \"German Business Book Prize\" (\u201cDeutscher Wirtschaftsbuchpreis\u201d). In 2015, she was awarded the Hans Matth\u00f6fer German book prize by the German political foundation Friedrich Ebert Foundation. She was awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa Award by National University of San Mart\u00edn and a Doctor Honoris Causa by Simon Fraser University in 2016. She was also awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa by Hasselt University in 2017. In 2018, her research focused on how governments foster innovation won her the Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought. In 2019, she was awarded the All European Academies Madame de Sta\u00ebl Prize for Cultural Values, honoring her contributions for analyzing the governments' roles in fostering innovation.\"https://www.allea.org/economist-mariana-mazzucato-winner-of- the-2019-madame-de-stael-prize/\" == Reception == Critics have argued that Mazzucato offers a confused definition of \"public goods,\" which is a \"crucial point,\" since \"the non-rivalrous and non-excludable nature [of public goods] make them difficult to profit from providing,\" and thus the private sector cannot, by definition, be interested in them.\"The Intellectual Hole At The Heart Of Mariana Mazzucato's Entrepreneurial State\" by Tim Worstall, Forbes, December 15, 2013 Others claim that she is \"too hard on business\"\"The entrepreneurial state\", The Economist, August 31, 2013 but acknowledge that \"she is right to argue that the state has played a central role in producing game-changing breakthroughs, and that its contribution to the success of technology-based businesses should not be underestimated.\" Martin Wolf wrote that The Entrepreneurial State offers \"a controversial thesis,\" but \"it is basically right,\"\"A much-maligned engine of innovation\" by Martin Wolf, Financial Times, August 4, 2013 and warns that the \"failure to recognise the role of the government in driving innovation may well be the greatest threat to rising prosperity.\" Another critic stated that \"it is one thing to legitimize the state as a driver of innovation and give credit where credit is due \u2013 something [Mazzucato's] book does masterfully\", but \"it is another thing altogether to craft effective innovation policy that deals with risk in a politically acceptable way.\"\"Winners only the state can pick: Mariana Mazzucato's The Entrepreneurial State\" by Robert D.
