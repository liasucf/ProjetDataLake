For example, Warrant Officers, Regimental Sergeant Majors and Master Sergeant are referred to as Sayagyi, literally meaning \"Old Teacher\", Sergeant are referred to as Saya and Corporal/Lance Corporal as Sayalay. These unofficial ranks are used throughout the daily life of all branches. Non- Commissioned Officers (NCO) within the Myanmar Armed Forces are usually seasoned veteran soldiers.
