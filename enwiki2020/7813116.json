It was sponsored by Microsoft Research. The award was open to any research scientist who had made a significant contribution at the intersection of computing and the sciences covering Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering. The prize recognized the importance of interdisciplinary research at the interface of science and computing for advancing scientific boundaries, as well as the importance of investing in European scientists to give Europe a competitive science base. The recipient was selected by a Committee comprising members of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences and Fellows of the Royal Society. The prize consisted of a trophy and monetary amount of \u20ac250,000, of which \u20ac7,500 is prize money and the rest earmarked for further research. The first award was made in 2006 and the last in 2009. It has now been replaced by the Royal Society Milner Award. ==List of winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Winner ! Affiliation !
