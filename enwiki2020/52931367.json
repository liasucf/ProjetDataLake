His father was a college professor. His mother was a homemaker, and he had two siblings. When Goolrick lost his job as an advertising copywriter, he turned to memoir writing. He wrote a memoir and his parents disinherited him, so he moved to New York. The End of the World As We Know It: Scenes from a Life highlighted \"the excesses and failures of both the social underpinnings of the time and his parents' inevitable alcohol-fueled decline, culminating in a devastating portrayal of the sexual abuse he suffered as a child.\" He sought \"something resembling peace\" in his writing. After years living in New York City, he returned to Virginia. In 2015 he moved from Whitestone, Virginia to Weems, Virginia. He reads from his book \"A Reliable Wife\" in a video posted for his Facebook followers to which he added, \"For people who can't come to a bookstore, this is what I look like and what I sound like, thanks to my friend Ashraf Meer.\" ==Works== *2007: The End of the World as We Know It: Scenes from a Life, Algonquin Books, *2009: A Reliable Wife, Algonquin Books, *2012: Heading Out to Wonderful, Algonquin Books, *2015: The Fall of Princes, Algonquin Books, *2018: The Dying of the Light, Harper, == Works translated into French == *2009: Une femme simple et honn\u00eate, [\u00ab A Reliable Wife \u00bb], translation by Marie de Pr\u00e9monville, Paris, \u00c9ditions Anne Carri\u00e8re, 413 p. *2010: F\u00e9roces, [\u00ab The End of the World as We Know It: Scenes from a Life \u00bb], translated by Marie de Pr\u00e9monville, , 254 p. . *2012: Arrive un vagabond, [\u00ab Heading Out to Wonderful \u00bb], translation by Marie de Pr\u00e9monville, \u00c9ditions Anne Carri\u00e8re, 319 p. ::- Prix Laurent-Bonelli Virgin-Lire 2012 ::- Grand prix des lectrices de Elle 2013. *2014: La Chute des princes [\u00ab The Fall of Princes \u00bb], translation by Marie de Pr\u00e9monville, \u00c9ditions Anne Carri\u00e8re, 360 p. . *2017: Apr\u00e8s l\u2019incendie, followed by the short story Trois lamentations, \u00c9ditions Anne Carri\u00e8re, 300 p. == Book recommendations by Goolrick for children == Robert Goolrick listed his six favorite books for children: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain; Oh, the Places You'll Go! by Dr. Seuss; Canada by Richard Ford; The Patrick Melrose Novels by Edward St. Aubyn; The Family Fang by Kevin Wilson; and Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris. == Prizes == *2013: Grand prix des lectrices de Elle for Arrive un vagabond (Heading Out to Wonderful) *2015: Prix Fitzgerald for La Chute des princes == References == == External links == * Beautiful People, Wretched Childhood on The New York Times * Robert Goolrick, author of the best-seller A Reliable Wife, talks about writing as the path to something resembling peace on Nashville scene * Robert Goolrick on KirKus * Goolrick's life spins from 'tortured' to 'Wonderful' on USA Today * Robert Goolrick > Quotes on Goodreads * 'A Reliable Wife' by Robert Goolrick on {Washington Post (8 April 2009) * Robert Goolrick on Book reporter * The End of the World as We Know It: Scenes from a Life by Robert Goolrick on bookslut.com Category:21st-century American novelists Category:1948 births Category:People from Virginia Category:Living people ",
