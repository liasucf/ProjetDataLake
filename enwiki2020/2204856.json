Casagrande was a professional cyclist between 1992 and 2005. ==Biography== He was a proven performer in the Grand Tours and the major one-day races. He wore the leader's jersey into the penultimate stage of the 2000 Giro d'Italia, but faltered badly and wound up 2nd to fellow Italian Stefano Garzelli. Casagrande did, however, win the mountains classification, wearing the corresponding green jersey on the podium. In major one-day races, he has won the Cl\u00e1sica de San Sebasti\u00e1n in 1998 and 1999, followed by the 2000 editions of the La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne and Subida a Urkiola. Also in 1999, he placed 4th in the World Cycling Championships Road Race behind \u00d3scar Freire, Markus Zberg, and Jean-Cyril Robin. In his early career, Casagrande won the 1996 Tirreno\u2013Adriatico and Tour of the Basque Country -- both one-week stage races. In 1998, Casagrande tested positive for doping with testosterone during the Tour de Romandie, and consequently was fired by his team .Cofidis bids farewell, CNN, 1998 He was originally given a six-month sentence, later extended to nine months by the UCI. He returned to racing at the 1999 Tour de Suisse, a race that he won, taking the leader's jersey away from Laurent Jalabert on stage 9. Casagrande also scored victories at the 2001 and 2002 Giro del Trentino and the 2002 Settimana Ciclistica Internazionale Coppi-Bartali. In the 2002 Giro d'Italia, Casagrande was expelled from the race, after knocking down another cyclist.Giro gets downright weird: Casagrande sent packing, Velonews, 2002 In 2003, Casagrande won two mountain stages in the Tour de Suisse, but lost the leader's jersey in the penultimate day's time trial to Alexander Vinokourov. He was unable to start the last stage due to urethritis. Casagrande was barred from competing in the 2004 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a a day before its start due to a high hematocrit level, indicating the use of erythropoietin (EPO), a popular doping product. In 2005, Casagrande retired.Casagrande stops, Cyclingnews, 2005 ==Major results== ;1994 :1st Tour of Tuscany :1st Tour of Emilia :1st Milano\u2013Torino ;1995 :1st Tour of the Apennines ;1996 :1st 20px Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico :1st 20px Overall Tour of the Basque Country ;1998 :1st Cl\u00e1sica de San Sebasti\u00e1n ;1999 :1st Cl\u00e1sica de San Sebasti\u00e1n :1st 20px Overall Tour de Suisse ;2000 :1st Giro del Trentino ;2001 :1st Giro del Trentino :1st Coppa Agostoni ;2003 :1st Coppa Agostoni :1st 20px Overall Tour de Suisse ** 2 stage wins === Major wins === * Giro d'Italia ** 1 stage win ** Winner mountains classification ** Leading the general classification for 12 days === Runner-up === * Giro d'Italia (2000) * Giro di Lombardia (2000) * Cl\u00e1sica de San Sebasti\u00e1n (2001) * Giro del Lazio (1999) * HEW Cyclassics (2000) * Giro del Veneto (1999, 2000) * Tour of Emilia (2001, 2004) ===Grand Tour general classification results timeline=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Grand Tour ! scope=\"col\" | 1993 ! scope=\"col\" | 1994 ! scope=\"col\" | 1995 ! scope=\"col\" | 1996 ! scope=\"col\" | 1997 ! scope=\"col\" | 1998 ! scope=\"col\" | 1999 ! scope=\"col\" | 2000 ! scope=\"col\" | 2001 ! scope=\"col\" | 2002 ! scope=\"col\" | 2003 ! scope=\"col\" | 2004 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A pink jersey Giro d'Italia | style=\"text- align:center;\"|40 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|22 | style=\"text-align:center; background:#ddf;\"|10 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|31 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 | style=\"text- align:center; background:#ddf;\"|2 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|DNF | style=\"text-align:center;\"|DSQ | style=\"text-align:center;\"|DNF |\u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A yellow jersey Tour de France |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center; background:#ddf;\"|6 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|DNF |\u2014 |\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|DNF |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A red jersey Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center; background:#ddf;\"|7 |\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|DNS |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Legend |- ! scope=\"row\" | \u2014 | Did not compete |- ! scope=\"row\" | DNF | Did not finish |- ! scope=\"row\" | DSQ | Disqualified |} ==See also== *List of doping cases in cycling *List of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offences ==References== ==External links== * Category:1970 births Category:Sportspeople from Florence Category:Living people Category:Italian male cyclists Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of Italy Category:Italian Giro d'Italia stage winners Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:Tour de Suisse stage winners Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cyclists Category:Tour de France cyclists Category:Giro d'Italia cyclists Category:UCI Road World Rankings winners ",
