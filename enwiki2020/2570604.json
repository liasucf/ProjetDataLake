    "text": "openDemocracy is a United Kingdom-based political website. Founded in 2001, openDemocracy claims that through reporting and analysis of social and political issues, they seek to \"challenge power and encourage democratic debate\" across the world. The founders of the website have been involved with established media and political activism. It has been funded by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation among other organisations including the Open Society Foundation the National Endowment for Democracy, the Ford Foundation and Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust. ==History== openDemocracy was founded in 2000 by Anthony Barnett, David Hayes, Susan Richards and Paul Hilder. Publishing started in May 2001.Tony Bennett (Autumn/Winter 2005-06). \"Opening up democracy, interview with the founder of openDemocracy.net Anthony Barnett\" (PDF). Society Matters (8): 15. Retrieved 2017-01-26. Originally attracting a meager following, visits to openDemocracy's website grew exponentially following the September 11 attacks after it published an article by Todd Gitlin on the subject, who was in New York during the attacks. In it, Gitlin wrote that what was needed was \"a focused military response\u2014 a precise one, not a revenge spasm... but an action that distinguishes killers from civilians.\" openDemocracy began receiving daily international contributors and many Americans who were dissatisfied with their media's coverage on the issue logged onto the website for an alternative source. With a shift to a more broad base, the e-magazine \"became a forum of debate for political activists, academics, journalists, businesspeople, politicians, and international civil servants from around the world\" drawing interest from charitable sponsors. By 2002, the three main topics of debate covered on the website were: the impact of globalisation, the use and abuse of American power around the world and the character of Islam. As the magazine grew, so did its coverage of topics from climate change and regulation of global markets to the future of multiculturalism and the impact of migration. openDemocracy's mission statement asserts: \"With human rights as our central guiding focus, we ask tough questions about freedom, justice and democracy. We give those fighting for their rights the agency to make their case and to inspire action.\u201d In 2008, the website averaged 224,000 monthly visits while receiving visits from 229 countries in the previous two years. It attracts around 8 million hits a year. openDemocracy is owned and published through a non-profit foundation. It has been funded by a number of philanthropic organisations, including George Soros' Open Society Initiative for Europe, the Mott Foundation, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, Ford Foundation, David and Elaine Potter Foundation, Lush, Andrew Wainwright Trust and the Network for Social Change. Founder Anthony Barnett, Charter 88 organiser and political campaigner, was the first editor (2001\u20132005) and Isabel Hilton was editor from 2005\u20132007. She was succeeded by Rosemary Bechler. In 2012 the editor-in-chief was Magnus Nome who was then succeeded by Mary Fitzgerald. In May 2017, openDemocracy helped sponsor The Convention on Brexit. ==References== ==External links== * Category:British political websites Category:Internet properties established in 2001 ",
