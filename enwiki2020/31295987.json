    "text": "Monticello High School is a coeducational public secondary institution located in Monticello, Illinois. It is a part of Community Unit School District #25. The school draws from the towns of Monticello, Cisco, and White Heath; and the counties of Piatt, Champaign, and DeWitt. ==History== A Monticello High School building was built in 1894 and was in use by the district as part of Washington Elementary. The current high school building was constructed directly next to the original structure. However, due to a current renovation, the 1894 building was struck down in the summer of 2019. A new gymnasium (Art \"Buz\" Sievers Center) will host its first event in August of 2020. Also, a new auditorium and various new classrooms will be completed by the start of the 2020-2021 school year. ==Athletics== Monticello boys and girls teams participate in the Illini Prairie Conference, a high school athletic conference whose member schools have similar enrollments and are all located in the central Illinois region. The statewide class designation is A, 1A, or 2A, depending on the sport. The mascot is the Sages, which is often represented by a wise owl. The Sage mascot is named \"Sammy Sage\". The basis comes from the Thomas Jefferson nickname \"Sage of Monticello\", which is also the town's namesake. It is a unique nickname among schools in the United States. ==Monticello Marching Sages== Monticello High School has boasted an exemplary music program which is headed by band director Alison Allender. The Monticello Marching Sages are known as one of the finest high school bands in Central Illinois. With their productions titled Lincoln (2017) and The Only Way Out ... Is Through (2019), the Marching Sages won the Governor's Trophy both years at the Illinois Marching Band Championships, which many say is equivalent to winning state. ==Notable alumni== * Robert C. Burke, 1967, posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor; killed in action during the Vietnam War * Harry Combes, 1933, head basketball coach, University of Illinois 1947\u20131967 * Allen F.
