There can be a pouill\u00e9 of a parish, an abbey, a deanery, a diocese, etc. The pouill\u00e9 is established for the assessment and collection of tax and charges and may include the revenues of profits, the number of taxpayers or even the complete list of these parties with the amounts paid. In some cases, we call a pouill\u00e9 a register in which are transcribed acts affecting a church building, abbey, etc. and the description of the property. Sometimes the term polyptych is used. General pouill\u00e9s include all the archbishops and bishops of the kingdom or state. == References == Category:Catholic Church and finance ",
