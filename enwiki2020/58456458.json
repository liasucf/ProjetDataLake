Prichard is mostly known for his tale, entitled \u2018The adventures and vagaries of Twm Shon Catti, descriptive of life in Wales: interspersed with poems\u2019. The novel was one of the first publications to feature the Welsh folklore character, Twm Si\u00f4n Cati, a sly highwayman often described as the 'Welsh Robbin Hood'. The volume was a large financial success and was regarded by some as Wales\u2019s first ever novel. The original 1828 edition, printed in Aberystwyth, was further developed in two subsequent editions, printed in 1839 and 1873. https://blog.library.wales/?p=17714 == References == Category:Welsh literature Category:Welsh folklore ",
