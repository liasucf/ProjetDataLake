The team is coached by Jay Ronayne, he is in his 11th year at Iowa State. The Cyclones host their home meets at Hilton Coliseum on Iowa State's campus. ==History== Iowa State first put together a women's gymnastic team in time for the 1973-1974 season, Char Christiansen lead that squad. Christiansen led the Cyclones to their first Big Eight Conference title in 1975.http://bigeightsports.com/Sports/WomensGymnastics/WomensGymnasticsChampionships.htm The Cyclones had limited success through most of the late 1970s and 1980s. The rebuilding process of the Cyclone program began with the hiring of Head Coach Amy Pyle in 1994. In 2000, her final season, the team won their first Big 12 championship and placed 8th overall at the NCAA Tournament, the highest finish in program history at that point. After Pyle's retirement Iowa State hired former letter winner and assistant coach K.J. Kindler, she would go on to be the most successful coach in program history. The highlights of her tenure were making back-to-back NCAA Finals in 2005-2006 and Janet Anson's individual career. In 2006 they won their second Big 12 Championship and made the first and only Super Six in school history. During her collegiate career Anson was a four time First Team All-American in vault (twice), floor, and all-around. At the conclusion of the season she left for Oklahoma. Current Head Coach Jay Ronayne has continued where Kindler left off. Under his leadership the Cyclones have qualified for NCAA Regionals every year and has had seven Big 12 Champions. ==Individual Accomplishments== === All-Americans === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ style=\"\" | First Team All- Americans |- align=center ! style=\"\" |Year ! style=\"\" |Player ! style=\"\" |Event |- | 2000 || Kelli More Betsy Hamm || Balance Beam Balance Beam |- | 2004 || Janet Anson || Vault |- | 2005 || Laura-Kay Powell Janet Anson || Floor Vault |- | 2006 || Laura-Kay Powell Erin Dethloff Janet Anson Janet Anson Janet Anson || Floor All-Around Floor All-Around Vault |- | 2013 || Michelle Shealy || Balance Beam |- | 2014 || Camille Santerre-Gervais || Uneven Bars |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ style=\"\" | Second Team All-Americans |- align=center ! style=\"\" |Year ! style=\"\" |Player ! style=\"\" |Event |- | 2000 || Betsy Hamm Betsy Hamm || Bars All-Around |- | 2003 || Erin Dethloff || All-Around |- | 2004 || Erin Dethloff Janet Anson Janet Anson || Beam All-Around Floor |- | 2005 || Erin Dethloff Laura-Kay Powell || All-Around Vault |- | 2006 || Erin Dethloff Erin Dethloff || Floor Uneven Bars |- | 2007 || Janet Anson || Beam |- | 2015 || Caitlin Brown || Beam |} ===Conference Individual Champions=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ style=\"\" | Big 12 Individual Champions |- align=center ! style=\"\" |Year ! style=\"\" |Player ! style=\"\" |Event |- | 1996 || Libby Bell || Floor |- | 1997 || Kim Mazza || Floor |- | 1998 || Kelli More || Beam |- | 1999 || Kelli More Sissy Huey || Beam Bars |- | 2000 || Betsy Hamm Betsy Hamm Sissy Huey Betsy Hamm || Beam Bars Bars All-Around |- | 2001 || Sissy Huey Stephanie Sweitzer Shelly Kringen Shelly Kringen || Floor Beam Vault All-Around |- | 2002 || Sissy Huey Stephanie Sweitzer Sissy Huey || Bars Bars All-Around |- | 2003 || Abigail Richey || Vault |- | 2004 || Erin Dethloff || Bars |- | 2005 || Janet Anson || Floor |- | 2006 || Erin Dethloff Janet Anson Janet Anson || Bars Vault Floor |- | 2007 || Janet Anson || Bars |- | 2009 || Jasmine Thompson Cecilia Maccani Megan Barnes || Beam Bars Vault |- | 2012 || Celine Paulus || Vault |- | 2014 || Camille Saterre-Gervais || Bars |- | 2015 || Caitlin Brown Haylee Young || Bars All-Around |} ==Facilities== The team practices at the Amy and Dennis Pyle Family Gymnastics Facility that was renovated in 2002.
