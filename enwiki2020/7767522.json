    "text": "Serrano traditional narratives include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the Serrano people of the San Bernardino Mountains and southern Mojave Desert of southern California, originally in the Serrano language. Serrano oral literature is closely linked with the traditions of the Serrano's closest linguistic relatives, the Takic-speaking groups to their south, as well as with the traditions of the Yuman\u2013speaking groups. These relationships are particularly evident in the sharing of the distinctive Southern California Creation Myth. '''''' ==Sources for Serrano Narratives== * Benedict, Ruth. 1926. \"Serrano Tales\".
