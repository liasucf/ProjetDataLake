    "text": "Wolgash or Vologash (Hatran Aramaic: \ud802\udce5\ud802\udceb\ud802\udce2\ud802\udcf4) was a king of Hatra, an ancient city in nowadays Iraq. He is known from more than 20 inscriptions found at Hatra and reigned from about AD 140 to 180. He was the son of Na\u1e63ru who reigned from about AD 128 to 140.Dijkstra (1995) p.178 He was one of the first rulers of Hatra calling himself \ud802\udcec\ud802\udceb\ud802\udcea mlk (king), but he bears also the title \ud802\udcec\ud802\udce3\ud802\udce9\ud802\udce0 mry' (lord).Dijkstra (1995) p.179 Both titles are also attested for his brother Sanatruq I. It is unclear whether they both reigned together and took the title king at some point in their reign, or whether Sanatruq succeeded Wolgash. His successor was either his brother or his nephew Abdsamiya. == References == * Category:2nd-century Arabs Category:Hatra Category:2nd-century monarchs in the Middle East ",
