She presented the first two seasons of the popular show Let's Dance with David Hellenius. ==Early life== She was born in a small town in 300 km north of Stockholm. When she was a child she was fond of handball, badminton and track- and-field athletics but most of all she was in love with theatre. She frequented a theatre group \u201dSlingerbultarna\u201d with her friends and often performed in different revues. And in a while her passion to theatre resulted in her moving to the capital of Sweden, but she returns to her native place in between times because it is the only safe spot for her and because she feels strong connection with her roots there.Sj\u00f6din, mitt live(my life) Retrieved on 20 Jan 2018 In Stockholm in 1985 she studied theatre and worked in the cafe \u00abNybropaviljongen\u00bb which doesn't exist any more. In 1989-1991 she moved in G\u00f6teborg where she worked as a specialist in lighting in Stadsteatern. On February 15, 1991 she debuted together with Adam Alsing as a program manager on TV in the first issue of \u201dTur i K\u00e4rlek\u201d(Happy in love). In 1999, she gave birth to her daughter Maja. They built up a close and hearty relationship between them. == Television work == Sj\u00f6din started her career as a light technician; she was fixing lights at TV4 for television shows. Adam Alsing, a presenter for TV4, was looking for a female co-host for a new game show called Tur i k\u00e4rlek. After auditioning several applicants, he asked Sj\u00f6din to audition, found her suitable and asked her to co-present the show with him. The show, which started airing in 1992 and became a huge success, was the first game show on the channel. Sj\u00f6din continued on television, co-presenting the travel game show Jakten p\u00e5 den f\u00f6rsvunna diamanten with Bengt Magnusson which was broadcast on TV4, but did not receive good reviews and was cancelled soon after. She next co-hosted F\u00e5ngarna p\u00e5 fortet with sport star Gunde Svan. The show was recorded at Fort Boyard in France, and Swedish celebrities performed different tasks in the fort's dungeons. Between 1996 and 1999, she presented Sm\u00e5 Stj\u00e4rnorna and Sikta mot stj\u00e4rnorna. In the following years she was the comp\u00e8re for Gladiatorernaa Swedish version of The Gladiators. In her role on \"Saknad\" she reunited guests with lost relatives and parents they had not met for many years. Sj\u00f6din did not appear on TV4 for three years. Sj\u00f6din has twice presented the Miss Sweden beauty contest.Dags att v\u00e4lja ny Fr\u00f6ken Sverige Aftonbladet Retrieved 20 August 2016 ==Other projects== Agneta Sj\u00f6din pursued a singing career and appeared on the show \"Alls\u00e5ng p\u00e5 Skansen\" broadcast on SVT.
