It was also the first broadcasting station to be operated by a church. ==History== Local electrical engineer Thomas J. Williams built WDM's original transmitter.\"Sermons and Jazz\" by J. Farrell, Radio News, June 1922: Part 1 (page 1104), Part 2 (pages 1208-1209). WDM was first licensed on December 22, 1921 to the Church of the Covenant (now the National Presbyterian Church) at 18th and N Streets, N.W., in Washington, D.C., for broadcasting on the standard \"entertainment\" wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz).\"New Stations\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 2. Limited Commercial license, serial #261, issued for a thirty day period to the Church of the Covenant in Washington, D.C. The call letters were randomly assigned, and the station's equipment was constructed by local electrical engineer Thomas J. Williams. (Williams later founded station WPM, which operated for about a year beginning in early 1922). WDM was the first broadcasting station to be established by a religious body.\"Religion On Radio: Beginnings\", The Concise Encyclopedia of American Radio edited by Christopher H. Sterling and Cary O'Dell, 2010, page 675. The station's debut broadcast was made on the afternoon of January 1, 1922, and featured a speech by Senator William Borah (R-Idaho) in support of the Four-Power Treaty.\"200 Miles Away, They Hear Church Services by Radio\", Washington Herald, January 2, 1922, page 1. Programming primarily consisted of Sunday religious services.\"When the Sexton Turns Radio-Telephone Operator\" by S. R. Winters, Radio News, July 1922, page 26. However, in September the station was used to broadcast Washington's first \"radio wedding\".\"Wireless Here to Broadcast Wedding Ritual\", Washington Times, September 06, 1922, page 13. Initially all broadcasting stations transmitted on a single \"entertainment\" wavelength of 360 meters, which required regional time-sharing agreements. By late 1922 there were numerous stations in the Washington area sharing this wavelength, and a major dispute developed between WDM and a second Washington station on 360 meters, WJH. WDM regularly broadcast the 8:00 p.m. Sunday services of Reverend Charles Wood. However, on December 3, 1922 WJH began simultaneously broadcasting the Reverend Earle Wilfrey's service from the Vermont Avenue Christian Church, drowning out both stations for most listeners.\"Radio News\", Washington Evening Star, December 4, 1922, page 16.\"Preachers Battle For Air Supremacy\", Washington Herald, December 4, 1922, page 1. The simultaneous transmissions were repeated on the evening of December 10,\"Ministerial Eloquence Again to Clash in Radio Sermons\", Washington Evening Star, December 10, 1921, page 1. and the clashing signals began to gain national attention.\"Radio 'War' Wages Hot Between Rival Churches\" (I.N.S.), Bridgeport (Connecticut) Times, December 11, 1922, page 1. The Department of Commerce regulated U.S. radio at this time, and then- Secretary Herbert Hoover was asked to intervene in the dispute,\"Hoover Asked to Settle Sabbath 'Battle of the Air' Between Churches\", Washington Herald, December 18, 1922, page 1. but refused to become involved. The technology for keeping stations on their assigned frequencies was rudimentary at this time, and Rev. Wilfrey claimed that, either by purposeful adjustments or due to natural technical variations, the two stations, while nominally transmitting on the same frequency, were actually separated enough so that only the most unskilled listeners using primitive receivers were reporting problems.\"Pastor Denies Conflict in Radio\", Washington Times, December 18, 1922, page 15. Due to the limited technology for maintaining steady transmitting frequencies at this time, a contemporary account noted that \"stations were scattered a little below and over 360 meters\". (\"Broadcasting Q R M\" (correspondence from Walter L. Edwards, Murfreesboro, Tennessee), Radio News, January 1923, pages 1399-1400). However, this did not resolve the issue, and despite talks between the two ministers,\"Ministers Talk Peace in Air War\", Washington Herald, December 25, 1922, page 1. the two stations continued to schedule their conflicting 8:00 p.m. broadcasts until the middle of May.\"By Radio Today: Local Stations\", Washington Sunday Star, May 13, 1923, part 1, page 23. At this time the Commerce Department greatly expanded the number of available transmitting frequencies,\"What the New Broadcasting Schedule Means to You\" by John V. L. Hogan, Popular Radio, pages 64-70. and, as part of the implementation of the new policy, on May 15, 1923 WJH was reassigned to 273 meters (1100 kHz).\"Radio Gossip and News\", Washington Sunday Star, May 13, 1923, part 1, page 23. WDM was briefly deleted in late 1923\"Strike out all particulars\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 2, 1924, page 7. but quickly relicensed, now assigned to 1280 kHz.\"New Stations\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 1, 1924, page 4. In mid-1925 it was reassigned to 1110 kHz.\"Alterations and Corrections\", Radio Service Bulletin, March 2, 1925, page 7. The station was reported to be still be active in late May 1925\"Local Radio Entertainment\", Washington Evening Star, May 24, 1925, Part 1, page 32. but subsequently went silent, and was formally deleted on June 8, 1925.\"Strike out all particulars\", Radio Service Bulletin, July 1, 1925, page 10. WDM's equipment was then donated to the Smithsonian Institution.\"Newest Museum In The Nation's Capital Emphasizes Electronic Communications\", Technician- Engineer, July 1964, page 9. ==References== DM Category:Radio stations established in 1921 Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:1921 establishments in Washington, D.C.
