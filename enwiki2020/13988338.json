    "text": "The Gold Medal of Military Valour () is an Italian medal established on 21 May 1793 by King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia for deeds of outstanding gallantry in war by junior officers and soldiers. The face of the medal displayed the profile of the king, and on its reverse was a flag decoration and the words \"for valour\" On 14 August 1815, Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia replaced it with the Military Order of Savoy, now known as the Military Order of Italy. Charles Albert of Sardinia revived it on 26 March 1833, and added to it the Silver and Bronze medals. These had, on their faces, the coat of arms of Savoy with laurel branches, the royal crown, and the words \"for military valor\". On the reverse were two laurel branches enclosing the name of the decorated soldier, and the place and date of the action. With the proclamation of the Republic on 2 June 1946, the coat of arms of the House of Savoy was replaced with the emblem of the Italian Republic.Preceding paragraphs translated and adapted from which describes the book \"Le medaglie d'oro al valor militare: volume primo, Roma, [Gruppo Medaglie d'Oro al Valor Militare d'Italia], 1965, 804 p.; 22 cm\" For actions performed by individuals during World War I, the Gold Medal was awarded some 368 times, as well as 37 times to military units, and once to the Unknown Soldier. Only four of the individual awards went to foreigners, one of these being Czar Nicholas II of Russia. The other three were for acts of gallantry in which the recipient was killed in action or died from his injuries (the Frenchmen John O'Byrne and Roland Morillot, and the American Coleman deWitt).The website of the Italian Presidency: List of all recipients can be obtained by going to http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/onorificenze.aspx, going to \"onorificenza\" (under \"Maschera di recerca\"), selecting \"Medaglia d'oro al valor militare\" and pressing \"avvia\". Also see \"Nel 1\u00b0 Centenario della istituzione della Medaglia al Valor Militare\" edizione del 1933 dell' Ufficio storico dell' esercito The Gold Medal of Military Valor was one of the most parsimoniously awarded medals of World War I, granted less frequently than even the Victoria Cross which was awarded 628 times. During World War II the medal was awarded to soldiers of the Royal Italian Army; after these forces were reorganized following the Armistice with Italy in 1943, it was awarded to members of the Allies-supporting Italian Co-Belligerent forces. The Axis-affiliated Italian Social Republic created another design of the medal, with a Gladius replacing the arms of Savoy, for members of the Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano from 1943 to 1945. This version of the award was not given recognition by the postwar Italian government. The Gold Medal for Military Valor is still awarded by the Italian state, and it, along with Silver and Bronze medals for Military Valor as well as the War Cross of Military Valour( which can only be awarded in time of war) was established by the Royal Decree of 4 November 1932, in which the purpose of these medals is defined as, \"to distinguish and publicly honor the authors of heroic military acts, even ones performed in time of peace, provided that the exploit is closely connected with the purposes for which the Armed Forces are constituted, whatever may be the condition or quality of the author.\" ==Notable recipients== The first recipient was Domenico Millelire of the Royal Sardinian Navy on 6 April 1793 and the latest recipient was in 2014 Chief Corporal-Major Andrea Adorno of the 4th Alpini Paratroopers Regiment for combat operations in Bala Murghab, Afghanistan in 2010. === Individuals === * Abele Ambrosini * Amedeo Guillet * Annibale Bergonzoli * Antonio Locatelli (thrice awarded) * Carla Capponi * Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia * Carlo Fecia di Cossato * Carmelo Borg Pisani * Cesare Battisti * Charles Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke * Domenico Millelire * Emanuele Beraudo di Pralormo * Emilio Fa\u00e0 di Bruno * Enrico Toti * Filippo Illuminato * Francesco Baracca * Fulco Ruffo di Calabria * Furio Niclot Doglio * Giovanni Fornasini * Giuliano Gozi * Giulio Martinat * Giuseppe Caimi * Giuseppe Galliano (twice awarded) * Hans-Joachim Marseille * Inigo Campioni * Irma Bandiera * Joachim M\u00fcncheberg * Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Morato * Junio Valerio Borghese * Luigi Arbib Pascucci * Luigi Giorgi (twice awarded) * Luigi Gorrini * Luigi Reverberi * Luigi Rizzo (twice awarded) * Maurizio Giglio * Nicola Calipari * Orlando Lorenzini * Paolino Mattina * Pore Mosulishvili * Roland Morillot * Salvo D'Acquisto * Sandro Pertini * Teseo Tesei * Tito Minniti * Unat\u00f9 Endisciau, the only native soldier awarded the Gold Medal === Military units === The first military unit awarded a Gold Medal was His Majesty's Dragoons Regiment (Reggimento Dragoni di Sua Maest\u00e0) on 21 April 1796 for unit's conduct during the Battle of Mondov\u00ec. Although at the time the Medal was exclusively awarded for personal bravery, King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia ordered the regiment's standard to be decorated with two medals for saving his army from Napoleon's attack. Until 1859, when the rules for awarding the Gold Medal were expanded to include cities and military units, only the \"Cuneo\" Brigade was awarded a Special Gold Medal of Military Valour by King Charles Felix of Sardinia for suppressing the Revolution of 1821. The first unit to be awarded the Gold Medal after 1859 was the French Imperial 3rd Zouaves Regiment for its conduct in the Battle of Palestro.
