It was also known as the royal palace (; ) or the Hala dels Draps. It was located in the Pla de Palau, in the center of the Ciutat Vella district of Barcelona. The palace had its origin in a woolen port warehouse of medieval times, until it was converted into a palace in 1652 and became the official residence of the viceroys of Catalonia. It became the Royal Palace and residence of the Spanish Royal Family in Barcelona in 1844. It was destroyed by a fire in 1875. ==History== ===Middle Ages=== The palace has its origins in the \u2018Porxo del Forment\u2019, a wheat warehouse constructed in 1314. Next to it, a cloth market was built in 1389, which was also known as the Hala dels Draps. The buildings were merged in 1514 and a floor was added to the building which served as an arsenal. ===Palace of the Viceroy=== King Philip IV confiscated the building in 1652 and purposed it to serve as the residence of the Viceroy of Catalonia. By order of Viceroy Vicente Gonzaga Doria a new palace was constructed between 1668 and 1688. The architect was Josep de la Concepci\u00f3, a Carmelite monk, who designed a baroque building. The palace had a quadrangular plan with a central courtyard, three levels with balconies and a facade with Gothic elements. Of the interior, the main hall, called Sal\u00f3n de los Festines, stood out, with a rectangular floor plan and two floors high. In 1700, by initiative of viceroy Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt a connection was added to the Santa Maria del Mar church. During the War of the Spanish Succession Archduke Charles of Habsburg was installed as king of Spain in the building in 1705. Three years later, he married Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel in the Santa Maria del Mar in 1708. They resided in the palace until 1711, when they left for Vienna in Austria. With the Nueva Planta decrees the office of the viceroy was abolished, and the palace became the residence of the Captain General of Catalonia. The palace got a fa\u00e7ade in a neoclassical style in 1771, designed by the architect Juan Miguel de Roncali. ===Royal Palace=== The palace became the royal palace in 1844, when the Captain General moved his residence to a former convent. During this time, the palace was reconstructed in neo-gothic style. During the various visits to Barcelona the Spanish Royal family staid in the palace. During the First Spanish Republic it was the seat of a court. The palace was destroyed by a fire in 1875 and was not rebuilt. It was not until 1919, that a new royal residence was erected in Barcelona, the Palau Reial de Pedralbes. The current royal residence in Barcelona is the Palaeut Alb\u00e9niz in the Joan Maragall Gardens on the Montju\u00efc mountain, which was designed for the 1929 Universal exposition in the exhibition site itself. ==Bibliography== * * ==References== *This article was initially translated from the Spanish Wikipedia. == External links == ==See also== *List of missing landmarks in Spain Category:Former palaces in Spain Category:Royal residences in Spain Category:Palaces in Barcelona Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1875 ",
