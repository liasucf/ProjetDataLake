Her alarm clock rings, but when she turns it off, her alarm clock turns into a cactus. Scared, Carpenter takes her hand off and hits the glass that falls on the floor. She gets up, but when she gets up she watered the foot and then the water turns into glitter. She wears her robe and makes up her bed, while she was tidying up her bed she pushes a sheet and turns it into a table towel. The next scene shows Carpenter in a red dress spinning to sit on a chair, but instead of sitting on a chair, she sits on a couch. Leaving a door, Carpenter takes off the dress she was wearing at the last scene and it shows a shirt with jeans behind it; She sits down on the couch and starts playing several \"instruments\" like a guitar, a tennis racket and an ukulele. When she ends up singing the first chorus, it shows a scene when she was tying her Converse in her bedroom, she leaves the chair she was sitting and her Converse turns into roller skates; later, in the final scene of the video, she falls and takes off the curtains and drops in her bed. Carpenter opens an umbrella at home and when she opens the umbrella, she appears outside the house spinning the umbrella near to an orange tree.

In all the video, it shows a scene where Carpenter is sitting and singing the song. ===Critical reception=== Michelle McGahan of PopCrush called the video \"a perfect introduction to the star, who is adorably goofy in the sweet vid for the upbeat song. Carpenter shows off her feminine side with loose blonde waves and a barrage of silly ensembles that she dresses up in throughout the video. But she also shows off her musicianship, playing both the acoustic guitar and ukelele (and even a tennis racket) while singing her heart out.\" ==Critical reception== Monique Melendez of Billboard pointed the relatability of the song by saying: \"[...] the lyrics cross the generational gap with their relatability, with lyrics like \"Here I am again, the same old situation / Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated.\" Anna Marie of A Kid's Point of You said \"The EP kicks off with the title track / hit single , \u201cCan\u2019t Blame A Girl For Trying.\u201d Flawless vocals, an undeniably sophisticated edge, and an effortless ability to inspire listeners makes this song a feel- good anthem (not to mention the adorable music video). This is a cute song about an innocent love story, and it speaks to the girls who make mistakes, but keep trying.\" Dolph Malone of Headline Planet said \"Valuable from a marketing standpoint, the inclusion of two Meghan Trainor co-writes is even more valuable from a musical standpoint. \u201cCan\u2019t Blame a Girl for Trying\u201d and \u201cDarling I\u2019m a Mess,\u201d those songs, possess the same self-awareness and same intimate, conversational approach that fuels Trainor\u2019s own hits.\" ==Live performances== Carpenter first performed the song at the 2014 Radio Disney Music Awards along with \"The Middle of Starting Over\". A few time later, she performed on City at BT Studio where she was wearing a blue dress. She performed an acoustic version of the song on Perez TV along with \"The Middle of Starting Over\".
