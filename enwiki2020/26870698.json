The tower rises just 15 feet from its shorter neighbor to the east, 100 Congress. The Ashton was one of the first skyscrapers built in Austin during the city's 2006-2010 skyscraper boom. The building is notable for its extensive pool deck located atop the podium. The Ashton is the twin of a building of the same name in Dallas, Texas, though the Austin property is 16 stories taller. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Austin ==References== Category:Residential skyscrapers in Austin, Texas Category:Residential buildings completed in 2009 Category:HKS buildings ",
