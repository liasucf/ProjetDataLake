Featuring himself in the lead role and as a producer, Youreka signed on actress Sandra Amy and completed the film by mid-2014. However, the film went through production troubles and was only released several years later in January 2017.http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-columns/audio-beat- sivappu-enakku-pidikkum-red- alert/article5826115.ecehttp://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/170117/a-film- on-sex-education.html His latest release was Thoppi (2015) starring newcomers Murali Ram and Raksha Raj. The film was also marred with a spat towards release, with the director complaining that the producer cut scenes considerably in the second half without his knowledge. In their review, the Times of India noted \"perhaps, the director's cut was more engaging\" but \"for now, we have to settle for a film that is modestly engaging but doesn't fulfil its initial promise\".http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie- reviews/thoppi/movie- review/46487253.cmshttp://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/etcetera/article6868899.ece In April 2017, he began working on a project titled Kattu Paya Sir Intha Kaali featuring Jaivanth and Ira Agarwal.http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/040417/beauty- queen-set-to-wow-celluloid.html ==Filmography== *All films are in Tamil, unless otherwise noted. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\" |- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" !
