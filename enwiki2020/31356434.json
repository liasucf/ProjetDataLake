It was written by Anne Brown and published by TSR, Inc. ==Contents== According to reviewer Gene Galloway, the module is for a group of characters of levels 8\u201310. Gameplay takes place in the world of Ravenloft. A notable aspect of the story is the well-developed non-player characters, including Captain Garvyn of the ship Endurance. Galloway states that the setting's mood is excellent as well: \"Sights, sounds, smells, and creepy feelings are described in such a way as to make you look over your shoulder\". He also highlighted the artwork of Clyde Caldwell and Stephen Fabian as noteworthy. ==Publication history== ==Reception== Gene Alloway reviewed the module in the May/June 1992 issue of White Wolf Magazine. He assessed that it is \"one of the better efforts by TSR\" and \"you can't go wrong here. This is one adventure that you will have a good ol' scary time with\". He rated the game an overall 4 out of a possible 5. ==References== Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules Category:Ravenloft ",
