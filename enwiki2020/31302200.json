The organization was co-founded by Edward Balassanian, Ph.D., an architect and urban planner, also of Armenian descent.

Honorary Commissioner: Jean Boghossian Organized by: Armenian Center for Contemporary Experimental Art ==Sources== *Active departments of the Center in 2011 are Department of Fine Arts (Painting, sculpture, installation video arts, etc.), Department of Theater, Cinema and Video, and Department of Architecture. *In the past, from time-to-time active departments of the Center have been departments of music (experimental and rock) and literature. *Since April 1996 ACCEA/NPAK has been operating at a 1,823 m2 (19,450 square foot) space provided by the Government of Armenia. The venue is located at the heart of Yerevan in walking distance from the Republic Square, where the Prime Minister\u2019s office, several ministries and the National Museum of History and National Gallery of Paintings are located. ==Activities of ACCEA/NPAK== Main objectives of ACCEA/NPAK have been, and continue to be, encouraging and assisting free and uninhibited expression, and opening \u201cnew horizons\u201d in arts and artistic expression of Armenian artists, as well as discovery of new and young artistic talents and providing them opportunity of presenting their work. This is the main objective of annual festival of alternative art organized by ACCEA/NPAK. At the center active parts are played by \u201cThe Project Room\u201d, where artists present new and experimental projects, and the \u201cOpen Studio\u201d, which has been initiated in 2011. Here individual artist creates a single work during a limited period, showing the creative process as well as the end result at the end of the period. As an indicator of successes of the center suffice it to state that while in 1992-1994 period it started with one group exhibition per year, during 2001 through 2010 period the number of individual and group exhibitions have fluctuated between 10 and 20 per year. During the last decade parallel with exhibitions the center has organized two international festivals of experimental theater and video (short and feature films) per year. In appreciation of cultural services provided to the Armenian contemporary art in early 2002, Government of Republic of Armenia issued a decree by which the space occupied by ACCEA/NPAK was provided to it for indefinite period free of charge. In 2003 by sponsorship of late writer and architect Rouben H. Avanessian (Pen- name: R. Ben) ACCEA/NPAK initiated erection of quadruple-scale bronze cast of forefather of Armenian Contemporary art Yervand Kotchar\u2019s \u201cMelancholy\u201d sculpture in Yerevan, in front of the entrance of the center. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in social and cultural life of the Capital of Armenia. ==Educational activities== On the informal level of education ACCEA/NPAK as a rule always publishes booklets and sometimes extensive catalogues for exhibitions, which contain texts by curators describing the conceptual basis and arguments leading to organization of events and exhibitions. Sometimes the publications include artist\u2019s statement. The body of these publications form an informal public education initiative for introducing and promoting contemporary concepts of art. ACCEA/NPAK is in the process of initiating Independent Study Program (ISP) based on the model of New York\u2019s Whitney Museum ISP, where newly graduated artists get opportunity to meet experienced masters in the arts and culture and enrich their insight and global appreciation of art. ==References== ==External links== *www.accea.info *www.soniabalassanian.com Category:Armenian art Category:Buildings and structures in Yerevan ",
