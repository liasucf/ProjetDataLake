Finnur J\u00f3nsson 1902\u20138, p. 31) af Harallde Gormssyne (dative), ch. 14 (p. 58) vi\u00f0 Haralld konong Gorms sun (accusative). , died c. 985/86) was a king of Denmark and Norway. He was the son of King Gorm the Old and of Thyra Dannebod. Harald ruled as king of Denmark from c. 958 \u2013 c. 986. Harald introduced Christianity to Denmark and consolidated his rule over most of Jutland and Zealand. Harald's rule as king of Norway following the assassination of King Harald Greycloak of Norway was more tenuous, most likely lasting for no more than a few years in the 970s. Some sources say his son Sweyn Forkbeard forcibly deposed him from his Danish throne before his death. == Name== Curmsun disc with \"Harald\" inscription (Arald Curmsun) at the top lines Harald's name is written as runic haraltr : kunuk\u0280 (\u16bc\u16c5\u16b1\u16c5\u16da\u16cf\u16b1 \u16ec \u16b4\u16a2\u16be\u16a2\u16b4\u16e6) in the Jelling stone inscription. In normalized Old Norse, this would correspond to Haraldr konungr, i.e. \"Harald king\". The Latinized name as given in the medieval Danish chronicles is Haraldus Gormonis filius. The given name Haraldr (also Haralldr) is the equivalent of Old English Hereweald, Old High German Heriwald, from hari \"army\" and wald- \"rule\".A. F\u00f6rstemann, Altdeutsches Namenbuch (1856), 631f. Harald's name is also inscribed on the so-called Curmsun disc, rediscovered in 2014 (but part of a Viking hoard previously discovered in 1841 in the crypt of the Gro\u00df- Weckow village church in Pomerania, close to the Viking Age stronghold of Jomsborg), as +ARALD CVRMSVN + REX AD TANER + SCON + JVMN + CIV ALDIN, i.e. \"Harald Gormson, king of Danes, Scania, Jumne, [in] \". The first documented appearance of Harald's nickname \"Bluetooth\" (as blatan; Old Norse *bl\u00e1t\u01ebnn) is in the Chronicon Roskildense (written ca. 1140), alongside the alternative nickname Clac Harald.Mortuo patre, [Haraldus] quinquaginta annos regnavit. Hic Christianus extitit cognomine Blatan sive Clac Harald. ed. Langebek (1772) p. 375. Clac Harald appears to be a confusion of Harald Bluetooth with the legendary or semi-legendary Harald Klak, son of Halfdan. The byname is given as Blachtent and explicitly glossed as \"bluish or black tooth\" (dens lividus vel niger) in a chronicle of the late 12th century, Wilhelmi abbatis regum Danorum genealogia.ed. Ludewig, Reliqui\u00e6 Manuscriptorum, vol. IX, 591\u2013650: Haraldus, hinc cognomento Blachtent, id est, dens lividus, vel niger The traditional explanation is that Harald must have had a conspicuous bad tooth that appeared \"blue\" (i.e. \"black\", as bl\u00e1r \"blue\" meant \"blue-black\", or \"dark-coloured\"). Another explanation, proposed by Scocozza (1997), is that he was called \"blue thane\" (or \"dark thane\") in England (with Anglo-Saxon thegn corrupted to tan when the name came back into Old Norse).Scocozza, Benito (1997), Politikens bog om danske monarker, K\u00f8benhavn: Politikens Forlag, ==Reign== Harald's kingdom (in red) and his vassals and allies (in yellow) During his reign, Harald oversaw the reconstruction of the Jelling runic stones, and numerous other public works. The most famous is fortifying the fortress of Aros (nowadays Aarhus) which was situated in a central position in his kingdom in the year 979. Some believe these projects were a way for him to consolidate economic and military control of his country and the main city. Ring forts were built in five strategic locations with Aarhus perfectly in the middle: Trelleborg on Zealand, Borrering in eastern Zealand (the inner construction of this fort is still yet to be established), Nonnebakken on Funen, Fyrkat in Himmerland (northern Jutland) and Aggersborg near Limfjord. All five fortresses had similar designs: \"perfectly circular with gates opening to the four corners of the earth, and a courtyard divided into four areas which held large houses set in a square pattern.\"Fortehad, Oram and Pedersen, Viking Empires, Cambridge University Press (2005) p. 180. A sixth Trelleborg of similar design, located at Borgeby, in Scania, has been dated to about 1000 and may have been built by King Harald and a second fort named Trelleborg is located near the modern town of Trelleborg in Scania in present- day Sweden, but is of older date and thus pre-dates the reign of Harald Bluetooth. He constructed the oldest known bridge in southern Scandinavia, the wide and long Ravning Bridge at Ravning meadows. While quiet prevailed throughout the interior, he turned his energies to foreign enterprises. He came to the help of Richard the Fearless of Normandy in 945 and 963, while his son conquered Samland, and after the assassination of King Harald Greycloak of Norway, managed to force the people of that country into temporary subjugation to himself. The Norse sagas present Harald in a rather negative light. He was forced twice to submit to the renegade Swedish prince Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong of the Jomsvikings- first by giving Styrbj\u00f6rn a fleet and his daughter Thyra, the second time by giving up himself as hostage, along with yet another fleet. When Styrbj\u00f6rn brought this fleet to Uppsala to claim the throne of Sweden, Harald broke his oath and fled with his Danes to avoid facing the Swedish army at the Battle of F\u00fdrisvellir. As a consequence of Harald's army having lost to the Germans at the Danevirke in 974, he no longer had control of Norway, and Germans settled back into the border area between Scandinavia and Germany. They were driven out of Denmark in 983 by an alliance of Obodrite soldiers and troops loyal to Harald, but soon after, Harald was killed fighting off a rebellion led by his son Sweyn. He is believed to have died in 986, although several accounts claim 985 as his year of death. According to Adam of Bremen he died in Jumne/Jomsborg from his wounds.Rosborn, Sven (2015) A unique object from Harald Bluetooth\u00b4s time? Malm\u00f6: Pilemedia, pp. 4\u20135 www.academia.edu The Curmsun Disc was found in Gro\u00df-Weckow, Pomerania and according to the inscription, Swedish archaeologist Sven Rosborn proposes that Harald may have been buried in the church there (after 1945 Wiejkowo), close to Jomsborg. From 1835 to 1977, it was wrongly believed that Harald ordered the death of the Haraldsk\u00e6r Woman, a bog body previously thought to be Gunnhild, Mother of Kings until radiocarbon dating proved otherwise.\" Haraldskaer Woman: Bodies of the Bogs\", Archaeology, Archaeological Institute of America, December 10, 1997 The Hiddensee treasure, a large trove of gold objects, was found in 1873 on the German island of Hiddensee in the Baltic Sea. It is believed that these objects belonged to Harald's family.Pontus Weman Tell (2016), The Curmsun Disc \u2013 Harald Bluetooth\u00b4s Golden Seal? www.academia.edu ==Conversion to Christianity== King Harald Bluetooth's conversion to Christianity is a contested bit of history, not least because medieval writers such as Widukind of Corvey and Adam of Bremen give conflicting accounts of how it came about. Widukind of Corvey, writing during the lives of King Harald and Otto I, claims that Harald was converted by a \"cleric by the name of Poppa\" who, when asked by Harald to prove his faith in Christ, carried a \"great weight\" of iron heated by a fire without being burned.Widukind, Res gestae Saxonicae 3.65, ed. Paul Hirsch and Hans-Eberhard Lohmann, MGH SS rer. Germ. in usum scholarum (Hanover, 1935), pp. 140\u2013141. Translated from Latin by Anders Winroth, \u00a9 2006. According to 12th-century Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in his work Gesta Danorum, Poppo performed his miracle for Harald's son Sweyn Forkbeard after Sweyn had second thoughts about his own baptism. Harald himself converted to Catholicism after a peace agreement with the Holy Roman Emperor. Adam of Bremen, writing 100 years after King Harald's death in \"History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen\", finished in 1076, describes Harald being forcibly converted by Otto I, after a defeat in battle.Adam of Bremen, History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, trans. Francis J. Tschan (New York, 2002), pp. 55\u201357. However, Widukind does not mention such an event in his contemporary Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres or Deeds of the Saxons. Some two hundred and fifty years later, the Heimskringla relates that Harald was converted with Earl Haakon, by Otto II. A cleric named Poppa, perhaps the same one, also appears in Adam of Bremen's history, but in connection with Eric of Sweden, who had supposedly conquered Denmark (the fact that Eric conquered Denmark during the realm of Sweyn Forkbeard is explained by Saxo as a punishment of Sweyn's apostasy).Adam of Bremen, History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, trans. Francis J. Tschan (New York, 2002), pp. 77\u201378. The story of this otherwise unknown Poppo or Poppa's miracle and baptism of Harald is also depicted on the gilded altar piece in the Church of Tamdrup in Denmark (see image at top of this article). The altar itself dates to about 1200.Anders Winroth, Viking Sources in Translation, 2009. Adam of Bremen's claim regarding Otto I and Harald appears to have been inspired by an attempt to manufacture a historical reason for the archbishops of Hamburg- Bremen to claim jurisdiction over Denmark (and thus the rest of Scandinavia); in the 1070s, the Danish king was in Rome asking for Denmark to have its own arch-bishop, and Adam's account of Harald's supposed conversion (and baptism of both him and his \"little son\" Sweyn, with Otto serving as Sweyn's godfather) is followed by the unambiguous claim that \"At that time Denmark on this side of the sea, which is called Jutland by the inhabitants, was divided into three dioceses and subjected to the bishopric of Hamburg.\" As noted above, Harald's father, Gorm the Old, had died in 958, and had been buried in a mound with many goods, after the pagan practice. The mound itself was from c. 500 BCE, but Harald had it built higher over his father's grave, and added a second mound to the south. Mound-building was a newly revived custom in the 10th century, perceivably as an \"appeal to old traditions in the face of Christian customs spreading from Denmark's southern neighbors, the Germans.\"Anders Winroth, Viking Sources in Translation, in text drawing on a caption by Anders Winroth in Barbara Rosenwein, Reading the Middle Ages, (Peterborough, Ont., 2006). p. 266. The larger Jelling stone, showing the inscription concerning Harald After his conversion, around the 960s, Harald had his father's body reburied in the church next to the now empty mound. He had the Jelling stones erected to honour his parents.megalithic.co.uk C. Michael Hogan, \"Jelling Stones\", Megalithic Portal, editor Andy Burnham The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica considers the runic inscriptions as the best-known in Denmark.books.google.com Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica The biography of Harald Bluetooth is summed up by this runic inscription from the Jelling stones: Harald undoubtedly professed Christianity at that time and contributed to its growth, but with limited success in Denmark and Norway. ==Marriages and children== Spouses: # Gunhild # Thora (Tova) the daughter of Mistivir in 970. She raised the S\u00f8nder Vissing Runestone after her mother. # Gyrid Olafsdottir Children: *Tyra of Denmark, married Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong. *Sweyn Forkbeard. Born about 960. Usually given as the son of Harald and Gunhild, though it is said in some of the older sagas that he was an illegitimate son. *Haakon. Born in 961(?). *Gunhilde. She married Pallig, Jarl and Ealdorman of Devonshire. It is thought that they both died in the St. Brice's Day massacre in November 1002. ==Bluetooth technology== The Bluetooth wireless specification design was named after the king in 1997, based on an analogy that the technology would unite devices the way Harald Bluetooth united the tribes of Denmark into a single kingdom. The Bluetooth logo consists of a Younger futhark bindrune for his initials, H (\u16bc) and B (\u16d2).Bluetooth, About the Bluetooth SIG . ==See also== *Curmsun disc *Hagrold, a 10th-century Danish Viking in Normandy, mentioned as a Danish king, who became conflated with Harald Bluetooth in a later historical account. Harald/Hagrold was in fact the uncle of Harald Bluetooth, a younger brother of Harald's father Gorm the Old according to . Gorm expelled his brother Harald from Denmark after what would have seemed to be a kind of civil war between the two brothers and their followers, who both claimed to be kings of Denmark. These events took place in the second half of the 930s and the first years of the 940s. *Hiddensee treasure ==Footnotes== ==References== * This article incorporates text from the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia article \"Harold Bluetooth\" by Pius Wittmann, a publication now in the public domain. ==External links== * Category:980s deaths Category:10th- century Christians Category:10th-century kings of Denmark Category:10th- century Norwegian monarchs Category:Burials at Roskilde Cathedral Category:Christian monarchs Category:Converts to Christianity from pagan religions Category:Danish Christians Category:House of Kn\u00fdtlinga Category:Norwegian monarchs Category:Viking warriors ",
