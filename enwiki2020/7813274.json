    "text": "Indian Prairie School District 204 (abbreviated IPSD) serves roughly 28,500 students from the Illinois communities of Aurora, Bolingbrook, Plainfield and Naperville, in DuPage and Will counties. Currently, one preschool, twenty-one elementary schools, seven middle schools, three high schools, and one alternative high school are in the district. There are thirty-one District 204 schools in Naperville and Aurora and one in Bolingbrook. ==History== The district was formed in 1972 by the mergers of Wheatland Elementary District 40, Elementary District 90 and Indian Plains Elementary District 182. The district began as a Kindergarten-8th Grade (K-8) district, with its students attending Naperville Central High School for 9th Grade-12th Grade until Waubonsie Valley High School was constructed for District 204 and opened in 1975. The district opened eleven buildings during the 1990s, at all levels of primary and secondary education. Neuqua Valley High School was introduced to the district in 1997. Another two elementary buildings were opened in 2001-2002, another in 2007, and a third traditional high school, Metea Valley High School, opened in 2009, to relieve overpopulation of Neuqua Valley High School and Waubonsie Valley High School. ==Preschools== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | School's name ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | School's namesake !
