    "text": "Fern Knight is an American psychedelic folk band currently based in Washington, D.C. Formed in 1999 by Margaret Ayre (n\u00e9e Wienk), the group performs music inspired by the spooky, pastoral sounds of classic British acts like Pentangle and Steeleye Span. Their music has been referred to as \"a delightfully creepy homage to the Celtic-Appalachian tradition.\" ==History== Ayre formed Fern Knight in Providence, Rhode Island, releasing the band\u2019s first album, Seven Years of Severed Limbs, on the Normal label in 2003. After relocating to Philadelphia, Fern Knight fell in with the city's burgeoning psychedelic folk scene, playing alongside bands like Espers. In 2006 - 2008, Fern Knight collaborated with members of Espers on The Valerie Project, an alternate soundtrack to the Czechoslovakian cult film Valerie and Her Week of Wonders. Fern Knight\u2019s most recent album, Castings, was released on VHF Records in 2010. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Seven Years of Severed Limbs (2003) *Blithewold EP (2005) *Music for Witches and Alchemists (2006) *Fern Knight (2008) *Castings (2010) == References == ==External links== *Fern Knight at Bandcamp Category:American folk musical groups Category:Musical groups from the United States with local place of origin missing Category:Musical groups from Washington, D.C.
