    "text": "The Manding languages (sometimes spelt Manden) are a dialect continuum of Mande languages spoken in West Africa. Their best-known members are Bambara, the most widely spoken language in Mali; Mandinka, the main language of the Gambia; Maninka, or Malink\u00e9, a major language of Guinea; and Jula, a trade language of the northern Ivory Coast and western Burkina Faso. ==Subdivisions== The Manding languages, and what distinguishes one from the rest and relationships among all of them are matters that continue to be researched. In addition, the nomenclature \u2013 being a mixture of indigenous terms and words applied by English and French speakers since before the colonisation of Africa \u2013 makes the picture complex and even confusing. The Mandinka people speak varieties from the first two groups; the differences between the western and eastern branches manifest themselves primarily phonetically. While dialects of the western group usually have 10 vowels (5 oral and 5 long/nasal), the eastern group, typified by Bambara, has 14 vowels (7 oral and 7 nasal): ;Manding-West *Kassonke \u2013 Western Maninka (Mali, Senegal) *Mandinka (Senegal, Gambia, Guinea Bissau) *Kita Maninka (Mali) *Jahanka (Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, Mali; one of several dialects under this name) ;Manding-East * Marka (Dafin) (Burkina Faso, Mali) * Bambara\u2013Dyula (Northeastern Manding; Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast) * Eastern Maninka (Southeastern Manding; multiple varieties in Mali, Guinea, Ivory Coast) *Bolon (Burkina Faso) In addition, Sininkere (Burkina Faso) is of unclear placement within Manding. ==Writing== The Manding languages have a strong oral tradition, but also have written forms - adaptations of Arabic and Latin alphabets,Donaldson, Coleman (2017) \u201cOrthography, Standardization and Register: The Case of Manding.\u201d In Standardizing Minority Languages: Competing Ideologies of Authority and Authenticity in the Global Periphery, edited by Pia Lane, James Costa, and Haley De Korne, 175\u2013199.

Arabic script or Ajami is still commonly used for Mandinka. *The Latin script was introduced into the region following European conquest and colonization. It is used fairly widely, with \"official\" versions in many countries, for teaching, literacy and publication. *The N'Ko script, developed in 1949 by Solomana Kante, is designed to write Manding using a common literary standard comprehensible to speakers of all these varieties. It is gaining in popularity.Donaldson, Coleman (2017) Clear Language: Script, Register and the N\u2019ko Movement of Manding-Speaking West Africa.
