    "text": "Reporters Without Borders () is an international non-profit and non- governmental organization that safeguards the right to freedom of information. Its advocacy is founded on the belief that everyone requires access to the news and information, inspired by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that recognizes the right to receive and share information regardless of frontiers, along with other international rights charters.RSF Annual Report 2018, p5 RSF has consultative status at the United Nations, UNESCO, the Council of Europe, and the International Organisation of the Francophonie. == Activities == RSF works on the ground in defence of individual journalists at risk and also at the highest levels of government and international forums to defend the right to freedom of expression and information. It provides daily briefings and press releases on threats to media freedom in French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Farsi and Chinese and publishes an annual press freedom round up, the World Press Freedom Index, that measures the state of media freedom in 180 countries. The organization provides assistance to journalists at risk and training in digital and physical security, as well as campaigning to raise public awareness of abuse against journalists and to secure their safety and liberty. RSF lobbies governments and international bodies to adopt standards and legislation in support of media freedom and takes legal action in defence of journalists under threat.RSF Annual Report 2018, pp14-16 To mark World Day Against Cyber-Censorship on 12 March, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has unveiled a list of 20 Digital Predators of Press Freedom and announces that it is now unblocking access to a total 21 websites in the sixth year of its Operation Collateral Freedom. ==History== Head office in Paris RSF was founded in Montpellier, France in 1985 by Robert M\u00e9nard, R\u00e9my Loury, Jacques Mol\u00e9nat and \u00c9milien Jubineau. It was registered as a non-profit organization in 1995. M\u00e9nard was RSF's first secretary general, succeeded by Jean-Francois Juillard. Christophe Deloire was appointed secretary-general in 2012. == Structure == RSF's head office is based in Paris. It has 13 regional and national offices, including Brussels, London, Washington, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro and Dakar, and a network of 146 correspondents. RSF Annual Report 2018, pp51-52 It employs 57 salaried staff in Paris and internationally.RSF Annual Report 2018, p10 A board of governors, elected from RSF's members, approves the organization's policies. An International Council has oversight of the organization's activities and approves the accounts and budget. ==Advocacy== ===World Press Freedom Index=== upright=2.25|thumb|right| 2020 Press Freedom Index === Information and Democracy Initiative === In 2018, RSF launched the Information and Democracy Commission to introduce new guarantees for freedom of opinion and expression in the global space of information and communication. In a joint mission statement, the Commission's presidents, RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire and Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi identified a range of factors currently threatening that freedom. This includes: political control of the media, subjugation of news and information to private interests, the growing influence of corporate actors, online mass disinformation and the erosion of quality journalism. This Commission published the International Declaration on Information and Democracy to state principles, define objectives and propose forms of governance for the global online space for information and communication. The Declaration emphasised that corporate entities with a structural function in the global space have duties, especially as regards political and ideological neutrality, pluralism and accountability. It called for recognition of the right to information that is diverse, independent and reliable in order to form opinions freely and participate fully in the democratic debate. At the Paris Peace Forum in 2018, 12 countries launched a political process aimed at providing democratic guarantees for news and information and freedom of opinion, based on the principles set out in the Declaration. === Journalism Trust Initiative === RSF launched the Journalism Trust Initiative (JTI) in 2018 with its partners the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), Agence France Presse (AFP) and the Global Editors Network (GEN). JTI defines indicators for trustworthy journalism and rewards compliance, bringing tangible benefits for all media outlets and supporting them in creating a healthy space for information. JTI distinguishes itself from similar initiatives by focusing on the process of journalism rather than content alone. Media outlets will be expected to comply with standards that include transparency of ownership, sources of revenue and proof of a range of professional safeguards. === Actions === RSF's defence of journalistic freedom includes international missions, the publication of country reports, training of journalists and public protests. Recent global advocacy and practical interventions have included: opening a centre for women journalists in Afghanistan in 2017, a creative protest with street-artist C215 in Strasbourg for Turkish journalists in detention, turning off the Eiffel Tower lights in tribute to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Kashoggi and providing training to journalists and bloggers in Syria. In July 2018, RSF made an unprecedented mission to Saudi Arabia calling for the release of 30 journalists. The organization publishes a gallery of Predators of Press Freedom, highlighting the most egregious international violators of press freedom. It also maintains an online Press Freedom Barometer, monitoring the number of journalists, media workers and citizen journalists killed or imprisoned. Its programme Operation Collateral Freedom, launched in 2014, provides alternative access to censored websites by creating mirror sites: 22 sites have been unblocked in 12 countries, including Iran, China, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. RSF offers grants to journalists at risk and supports media workers in need of refuge and protection.Cumhuriyet's former editor-in-chief Can D\u00fcndar receiving the 2015 RSF Prize. Shortly thereafter, he was arrested. === Prizes === RSF's annual Press Freedom Prize, created in 1992, honours courageous and independent journalists who have faced threats or imprisonment for their work and who have challenged the abuse of power. TV5-Monde is a partner in the prize. A Netizen Prize was introduced in 2010, in partnership with Google, recognizing individuals, including bloggers and cyber-dissidents, who have advanced freedom of information online through investigative reporting or other initiatives. In 2018, RSF launched new categories for the Press Freedom Prize: courage, independence and impact. ==== Press Freedom Prizewinners 1992-2019 ==== * 1992 Zlatko Dizdarevic, Bosnia-Herzegovina * 1993 Wang Juntao, China * 1994 Andr\u00e9 Sibomana, Rwanda * 1995 Christina Anyanwu, Nigeria * 1996 Isik Yurt\u00e7u, Turkey * 1997 Ra\u00fal Rivero, Cuba * 1998 Nizar Nayyouf, Syria * 1999 San San Nweh, Burma * 2000 Carmen Gurruchaga, Spain * 2001 Reza Alijani, Iran * 2002 Grigory Pasko, Russia * 2003 Ali Lmrabet, Morocco; The Daily News, Zimbabwe; Mich\u00e8le Montas, Haiti * 2004 Hafnaoui Ghoul, Algeria; Zeta, Mexico; Liu Xiaobo, China * 2005 Zhao Yan, China; Tolo TV, Afghanistan; National Union of Somalian Journalists, Somalia; Massoud Hamid, Syria * 2006 Win Tin, Burma; Novaya Gazeta, Russia; Guillermo Fari\u00f1as Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuba * 2007 Seyoum Tsehaye, Eritrea; Democratic Voice of Burma, Burma; Kareem Amer, Egypt; Hu Jia, Zeng Jinyan, China * 2008 Ricardo Gonzales Alfonso, Cuba; Radio Free NK, North Korea; Zarganar and Nay Phone Latt, Burma * 2009 Amira Hass, Israel; Dosh, Chechnya * 2010 Abdolreza Tajik, Iran; Radio Shabelle, Somalia * 2011 Ali Ferzat, Syria; Weekly Eleven News, Burma * 2012 Mazen Darwish, Syria; 8Sobh, Afghanistan * 2013 Muhammad Bekjanov, Uzbekistan; Uthayan, Sri Lanka * 2014 Sanjuana Mart\u00ednez, Mexico; FrontPage Africa, Liberia; Raif Badawi, Saudi Arabia * 2015 Zeina Erhaim, Syria; Zone9, Ethiopia; Cumhuriyet, Turkey * 2016 Hadi Abdullah, Syria; 64 Tianwang, China; Lu Yuyu and Li Tingyu, China * 2017 Tomasz Piatek, Poland; Medyascope, Turkey; Soheil Arabi, Iran * 2018 Swati Chaturvedi, India; Matthew Caruana Galizia, Malta; Inday Espina-Varona; Philippines; Carole Cadwalladr, United Kingdom * 2019 Eman al Nafjan, Saudi Arabia; Pham Doan Trang, Vietnam; Caroline Muscat, Malta ==== Netizen Prize ==== RWB 2011 Netizen Prize * 2010 Change for Equality website, www.we-change.org, women's rights activists, Iran * 2011: Nawaat.org, bloggers, Tunisia * 2012: Local Coordination Committees of Syria, media centre, citizen journalists and activists, Syria * 2013: Huynh Ngoc Chenh, blogger, Vietnam * 2014: Raif Badawi, blogger, Saudi Arabia * 2015: Zone9, blogger collective, Ethiopia * 2016: Lu Yuyu and Li Tingyu, citizen journalists, China == Annual reports == === Report 2012 === Reporters Without Borders, in its comprehensive statistical report released on Wednesday, December 19, 2012, called 2012 the \"deadliest year\" for journalists compared to previous years.

Iran rises one place and exceeds to (174th). The report emphasized that in Iran the print and broadcast media and news websites are all controlled by the Ministry of Intelligence and the Revolutionary Guards. The Iranian authorities have internationalized their repression by making hostages out of the relatives of Iranian journalists who work abroad or in Iran for foreign news media. The Islamic Republic of Iran is one of the world's five biggest prisons for news and information providers. === Report 2014 === According to the Reporters without Borders (RSF) on the 2014 annual report, the number of journalists killed worldwide in 2014 was 66, two-thirds of whom killed in war zones. The deadliest areas for the journalists that year were Syria and Palestine, Ukraine, Iraq and Libya.

After Turkey, China, Syria, Egypt and Iran are nearly two-thirds of imprisoned journalists in the world. \"According to the report, the role of the journalist's citizen has been emphasized in recent years, especially in suppressive regimes or in war-torn countries. Which have played a decisive role in reflecting and publishing news.\" === Report 2017 === According to the Reporters without Borders (RSF) released, its annual report on 2017, 65 journalists, including 50 professional journalists killed, 326 prisoners and 54 journalists have taken hostage.

Iran rises three places and exceeds to (173th). Hiding information, disinformation, official lies - methods used by the Islamic Republic in times of crisis and disaster- again, have been deployed on a regular basis since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of informing the public about the reality of the pandemic, the Iranian government hiding information and disinformation (according to official figures, the country has had 70,000 cases and 4,500 deaths caused by the virus) could put the lives of millions of Iranians at risk. == Publications == In addition to its country, regional and thematic reports, RSF publishes a photography book 100 Photos for Press Freedom three times a year as a tool for advocacy and a fundraiser. It is a significant source of income for the organization, raising nearly a quarter of its funds in 2018: === Selected reports === *2016 Freedom of expression under state of emergency, Turkey (with ARTICLE 19 and others) *2016 When oligarchs go shopping *2017 Who owns the media? *2017 Media Ownership Monitor, Ukraine (with Ukrainian Institute of Mass Information) *2018 Women's Rights: forbidden subject *2018 Journalists: the b\u00eate noire of organized crime *2018 Cambodia: independent press in ruins *2018 Women's rights: forbidden subject *2019 China's Pursuit of a New World Order Media * 2019 Media Ownership Monitor, Pakistan (with Freedom Network) === Statements === On June 25, 2020, Reporters Without Borders issued a statement entitled \"Enforced online repentance, Iran's new method of repression\".

On April 16, 2020, Reporters Without Borders has written a letter to two United Nations special rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Health, urging the United Nations to issue serious warnings to governments that restrict freedom of expression in the context of the coronavirus epidemic. The letter, signed by Christian Mihr, Director, Reporters without Borders (RSF) Germany, states: \"Freedom of the press and access to information are more important than ever at the time of Corona's pandemic.\" On June 25, 2020, Reporters Without Borders issued a statement entitled \"Online Repentance, a New Method of Repression in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\" According to the report, the Revolutionary Guards summoned and threatened to detain a number of journalists, writers, and human rights activists, forcing them to express regret or apology for posting their views online to silence them.

On April 21, 2020, The RSF based in Paris said that the pandemic has amplified and highlighted many crises and over shadowed freedom of the press. Pointing the global impact of the coronavirus crisis, in a statement, the high representative of the EU, Josef Bourl reminded that the pandemic should not be used to justify the limitation of democratic and civil atmosphere and respecting the rule of law and international commitments. It should not limit the freedom of speech and media and also access to the information, both online and offline. These measures should not be used for restriction of human rights advocates, reporters, media staffs, and institutions of civil societies. == Funding == RSF's budget for 2018 totalled \u20ac6.1m. Fifty per cent of the organization's income comes from public subsidy; 12 per cent from foundations; 24 per cent from the publication of photography books and 9 per cent from public donations. Foundations supporting RSF's work include Adessium, IEDDH (International Cooperation and Development, European Commission), Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency), and Omidyar. RSF has attracted criticism in previous years for accepting funding from the National Endowment for Democracy in the US and the Center for a Free Cuba. At the time, secretary-general Robert M\u00e9nard pointed out that funding from NED totalled 0.92 per cent of RSF's budget and supported African journalists and their families. RSF ceased its relationship with the Center for a Free Cuba in 2008. == Public profile == === Recognition === RSF has received multiple international awards honouring its achievements: * 1992: received the \"Lorenzo Natali Prize\" from the European Commission for defending human rights and democracy. * 1997: received the \"Journalism and Democracy Prize\" from the Parliament Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). * 2005: shared the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for \"Freedom of Thought\" with Nigerian human rights lawyer Hauwa Ibrahim and Cuba's Ladies in White movement.\"Ladies, Ibrahim and Reporters joint Sakharov prize winners\", European Parliament, 27 June 2006 * 2007: received the \"Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award\" from Taiwan Foundation for Democracy and the \"Dawit Isaak Prize\" from Swedish Publicists' Association. * 2008: received the \"Kahlil Gibran Award for Institutional Excellence\" from the Arab American Institute Foundation. * 2009: shared the \"Roland Berger Human Dignity Award\" with Iranian human rights lawyer and Nobel peace laureate Shirin Ebadi. * 2009: received the \"M\u00e9daille Charlemagne\" for European Media. * 2012: received the \"Club Internacional de Prensa\" Award, in Madrid. * 2013: received the \"Freedom of Speech Award\" from the International Association of Press Clubs, in Warsaw.\"Reporters Without Borders, Laureate of the International Association of Press Clubs Award\", Reporters Without Borders, 4 June 2013.

Retrieved 8 November 2016. * 2019: Dan David Prize, Defending Democracy, jointly with Michael Ignatieff RSF was criticized for accepting the Dan David Prize, awarded by the Dan David Foundation in Israel. === Criticism === ====Funding==== Reports published in the Council on Hemispheric Affairs and the US Newspaper Guild journal in 2005 criticized RSF for receiving funding from the US government and Cuba opposition groups, and for being part of a \"neocons crusade\" against the Castro regime. RSF denied the allegations of a political agenda, but confirmed that it had received a grant from the National Endowment for Democracy which is funded through the State Department and from the Centre for a Free Cuba. In 2006, online magazine CounterPunch claimed that RSF had falsely linked former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the murder of journalists and had failed to criticize his successor's crackdown on press freedom. RSF was criticized for supporting media outlets that were in favour of the coup attempt in Venezuela in 2002. In response, RSF pointed out that it had in fact condemned media support of the coup. ====Otto Reich==== Lucie Morillon, RWB's then-Washington representative, confirmed in an interview on 29 April 2005 that the organization had a contract with US State Department's Special Envoy to the Western Hemisphere, Otto Reich, who signed it in his capacity as a trustee for the Center for a Free Cuba, to inform Europeans about the repression of journalists in Cuba.Reporters Without Borders Unmasked , Diana Barahona, CounterPunch, 17 May 2005 CounterPunch, a critic of RWB, cited Reich's involvement with the group as a source of controversy: when Reich headed the Reagan administration's Office of Public Diplomacy in the 1980s, the body partook in what its officials termed \"White Propaganda\" \u2013 covert dissemination of information to influence domestic opinion regarding US backing for military campaigns against left-wing governments in Latin America. ====Cuba==== RWB has been highly critical of press freedom in Cuba, describing the Cuban government as \"totalitarian\", and engages in direct campaigning against it.Reporters Without Borders ordered to pay 6,000 euros to Korda's heir over use of Che photo , Cubanet.org, 12 March 2004 RWB's campaign includes declarations on radio and television, full-page ads in Parisian dailies, posters, leafletting at airports, and an April 2003 occupation of the Cuban tourism office in Paris. A Paris court (tribunal de grande instance) ordered RWB to pay 6,000 Euros to the daughter and heir of Alberto Korda for non-compliance with a court order of 9 July 2003 banning it from using Korda's famous (and copyrighted) photograph of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara in a beret, taken at the funeral of La Coubre victims. RWB said it was \"relieved\" it was not given a harsher sentence. English translation: \"RSF and the photo of 'Che' \" The face had been superimposed by RWB with that of a May 1968 CRS anti-riot police agent, and the postcard handed out at Orly Airport in Paris to tourists boarding on flights for Cuba. On 24 April 2003, RWB organized a demonstration outside the Cuban embassy in Paris\"Reporters Without Borders protesters beaten up by Cuban embassy officials\" , CubaNet, 24 April 2003 RWB, as well as M\u00e9nard himself, in turn has been described as an \"ultra-reactionary\" organization by the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party, Granma. Tensions between Cuban authorities and RWB are high, particularly after the imprisonment in 2003 of 75 dissidents (27 journalists) by the Cuban Government, including Ra\u00fal Rivero and \u00d3scar El\u00edas Biscet. An article by John Cherian in the Indian magazine Frontline alleged that RWB \"is reputed to have strong links with Western intelligence agencies\" and \"Cuba has accused Robert Meynard [sic] the head of the group, of having CIA links\".Cherian, John (29 March \u2013 11 April 2008). \"Trouble in Tibet\" . Frontline. 25(7). RWB has denied that its campaigning on Cuba are related to payments it has received from anti-Castro organisations.\"Why we take so much interest in Cuba\" . Reporters Without Borders. 8 July 2005. In 2004, it received $50,000 from the Miami- based exile group, the Center for a Free Cuba, which was personally signed by the US State Department's Special Envoy to the Western Hemisphere, Otto Reich. RWB has also received extensive funding from other institutions long critical of Fidel Castro's government, including the International Republican Institute.Coups d'Etat sans fronti\u00e8res , English translation: \"Coups Without Borders\", Maurice Lemoine, Le Monde diplomatique, August 2002 ====Haiti==== In 2004, Reporters Without Borders released an annual report on Haiti, saying that a \"climate of terror\" existed in which attacks and threats persisted against journalists who were critical of Jean-Bertrand Aristide. An August 2006 article in CounterPunch accused RWB of ignoring similar attacks on journalists under the Latortue government in 2005 and 2006, including that of Pacifica Radio reporter Kevin Pina. Pina himself said: ====Venezuela==== Le Monde diplomatique has criticized RWB's attitude towards Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's government in Venezuela, in particular during the 2002 coup attempt. RWB is said to have lent its support for Venezuelan pro-coup media outlets, and have had as a Caracas correspondent Mar\u00eda Sol P\u00e9rez-Schael, an opposition adviser. In a right of reply, Robert M\u00e9nard declared that RWB had also condemned the Venezuela media's support of the coup attempt. RWB has also been criticized for supporting Globovision's version of events about its false reporting in relation to a 2009 earthquake, claiming Globovision was \"being hounded by the government and the administration\".\"Reporters Without Borders' Lies about Venezuela\", Salim Lamrani, English translation by Scott Campbell Les Blough, Axis of Logic, 27 June 2009. RSF has received criticism in relation to historic campaigns. ====Overemphasis on \"third-world dictatorships\"; alleged bias in favor of Europe and the U.S.==== In 2007 John Rosenthal argued that RWB showed a bias in favor of European countries.\"The Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index: Independent Assessment or EU Propaganda?\", John Rosenthal, World Politics Review: Part I, 6 November 2007 and Part II, 14 November 2007 In the 2009 article about RWB and Venezuela cited above, Salim Lamrani stated that \"RSF is not an organization that defends freedom of the press, but is an obscure entity with a political agenda precisely commissioned to discredit through all possible means the progressive governments in the world that find themselves on the United States' blacklist.\" Reports published in the Council on Hemispheric Affairs and the US Newspaper Guild journal in 2005 criticised RSF for receiving funding from the US government and Cuba opposition groups, and for being part of a \u2018neocons crusade\u2019 against the Castro regime. RSF denied the allegations of a political agenda, but confirmed that it had received a grant from the National Endowment for Democracy which is funded through the State Department and from the Centre for a Free Cuba. The Observatoire de l'Action Humanitaire (Centre for Humanitarian Action) criticized RWB's lukewarm criticism of US forces for their shelling, in 2003, of Palestine Hotel, in Baghdad, Iraq, which killed two Reuters journalists. The family of one of the deceased journalists, Spanish citizen Jos\u00e9 Couso, refused to allow the Spain chapter of RWB to attach its name to a legal action led by the family against the US Army, voicing disgust at the fact that RWB interviewed US forces responsible for the shelling, but not the surviving journalists, and that RWB showed acquiescence to the US Army by thanking them for their \"precious help\". In 2006, online magazine CounterPunch claimed that RSF had falsely linked former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the murder of journalists and had failed to criticise his successor's crackdown on press freedom. According to the Observatoire, ever since Robert M\u00e9nard was replaced by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Julliard in September 2008, RWB has been concerned with violations of press freedom not only in \"third-world dictatorships\" but also in developed countries like France. Through widening its geographical scope, RWB aims at countering accusations of overly focusing on left-wing regimes unfriendly to the US.Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res (Reporters Without Borders) : List of NGOs Studied in France : NGO Directory , Observatory of humanitarian action, 29 September 2010: \"Depuis que Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Julliard a remplac\u00e9 Robert M\u00e9nard en septembre 2008, l'association [...] ne s'occupe plus seulement des violations des droits de la presse dans les dictatures du tiers- monde et couvre aussi des pays d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s comme la France. Un pareil \u00e9largissement g\u00e9ographique permet notamment \u00e0 l'association de r\u00e9agir aux critiques qui l'accusaient de trop se focaliser sur les r\u00e9gimes de gauche hostiles aux Etats-Unis.\" (\"Since Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Julliard replaced Robert M\u00e9nard in September 2008, the association [...] is no longer concerned just with violations of media rights in third world dictatorships and now also covers developed countries like France. Such a geographic expansion notably allows the association to respond to critics who accused it of too much focus on leftist regimes hostile to the United States.\") For example, RWB condemned the 35-year sentence received by American soldier Chelsea Manning, calling it \"disproportionate\" and arguing that it reveals how \"vulnerable\" whistleblowers are. In April 2019, the RWB stated the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could \"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistleblowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future.\" RSF was criticised for supporting media outlets that were in favour of the coup attempt in Venezuela in 2002. In response, RSF pointed out that it had in fact condemned media support of the coup. ====UNESCO support for International Online Free Expression Day==== UNESCO, who initially had granted patronage to the first International Online Free Expression Day to be held on 12 March 2008, withdrew its patronage on the day of the event giving as reasons that RWB \"published material concerning a number of UNESCO's Member States, which UNESCO had not been informed of and could not endorse\" and that \"UNESCO's logo was placed in such a way as to indicate the Organization's support of the information presented.\" RWB responded in a press release that \"UNESCO has withdrawn its support to the promotion of this campaign because several of the nations which are part of the list of Internet Enemies published by the nongovernmental organization have directly put pressure to achieve it.\" == See also == * The Uncensored Library * Avocats Sans Fronti\u00e8res * Chilling effect * Committee to Protect Journalists * Electronic Frontier Foundation * Freedom of speech * Freedom of the Press Foundation * Freedom of the Press report * Internet censorship by country * List of sovereign states in Europe by Press Freedom Index * List of indices of freedom * Media transparency * Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe statistics * Political repression of cyber-dissidents * Technology diffusion *The Coalition For Women In Journalism ==References== ==External links== * Reporters Without Borders web site Category:International human rights organizations Category:International organizations based in France Category:Freedom of expression organizations Category:Organizations established in 1985 Category:International journalism organizations Category:Political advocacy groups in France Category:Internet- related activism Category:1985 establishments in France Category:Sakharov Prize laureates ",
