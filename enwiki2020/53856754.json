    "text": "Ohr Torah Stone (OTS) () is an international Modern Orthodox movement that aims to develop Jewish life, learning and leadership. The organization is led by Rabbi Dr. Kenneth Brander. In 1983 OTS was founded by Rabbi Dr. Shlomo Riskin. As of 2020 OTS included 27 educational institutions under its auspices. Edward Abramson, A Circle in the Square: Rabbi Shlomo Riskin Reinvents the Synagogue, Urim Publications 2008http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100951 , Rabbinical Council of America Website, Unknown Author, Retrieved on April 23, 2017 The organization also includes a network of 300-plus emissaries who serve in positions of spiritual and educational leadership across the globe in North America, South America, Central America, Australia, and New Zealand.Rabbi Eliahu Birnbaum, \"Rav Olami,\" First Source (Hebrew), October 4, 2013. OTS has initiated numerous programs in the realm of women's leadership and empowerment, leadership training, Jewish outreach, and social action, which have received both national and international acclaim for their groundbreaking nature.Isi Leibler, \"The Incredible Rabbi Shlomo Riskin,\" The Jerusalem Post, Thursday, March 3, 2011 OTS has stated that its primary guiding principle is to ensure the accessibility of Judaism to each and every Jew--particularly addressing populations which had been previously marginalized, disenfranchised or alienated.Zev Eleff, Modern Orthodox Judaism: A Documentary History, University of Nebraska Press, 2016Chagai Segel, First Source (Hebrew), January 1, 2012 ==Jewish women's empowerment== OTS's programs for women have opened doors in the realm of Jewish Orthodox female scholarship and leadership that had previously been shut to the entire female population. OTS started the first school to teach post-high school women Talmud on a high level. OTS\u2019s women\u2019s college features the largest women\u2019s beit midrash [study hall] in Jewish history. The college has produced female leaders of Jewish communities worldwide, including the first female to officially serve as the director of a rabbinical court. OTS's women's college developed a program specifically for women with special needs. The curriculum allows participants to acquire both learning and vocational skills, build independence and improve self-esteem, while expanding their love of Torah, Israel, and the Jewish people. The program had proven so successful that in 2017, a parallel program was established for young men.Bracha Bender, \"A Year of their Own,\" Mishpacha Magazine, Vol. Feb 8, 2012. Another OTS program enables religious women to serve in the Israeli army: where previously these women were forced to choose between service to their country and living an observant lifestyle, now they are inducted as a group and strengthened by intense study before, during and after their service. OTS also opened the first school in the world to train women and certify them as advocates in the Rabbinical Courts. Only because of OTS\u2019s appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court did women win the legal right to practice in the Courts \u2013an arena which was, previously open only to men. The school then opened a Legal Aid Center and Hotline for Israeli women who are agunot (The agunah is a woman literally \u201cchained\u201d to a dead or abusive marriage whose husband refuses to grant her a Jewish writ of divorce) and are in need of free advice and legal representation in matters pertaining to the process of obtaining a religious divorce. ==Contemporary Jewish leadership== Ohr Torah Stone\u2019s Rabbinical Seminary prepares rabbis to be both fluent in secular learning as well as the Talmud. The curriculum is one which is immersed in contemporary concerns as well as Jewish law and legal texts. At the same time, the OTS Educators Institute comprehensively trains educators to teach Judaic Studies in both Orthodox and non-Orthodox state and community schools across Israel and the Diaspora. An additional OTS yeshiva is geared towards young men both with and without previous yeshiva backgrounds from North America, Europe, South Africa and Australia. Hundreds of OTS-trained teachers and spiritual leaders have served in communities spanning the globe.http://hamodia.com/2017/04/19/torn-torah-scrolls-laid-rest-74-years/, Hamodia Staff, \"Torn Torah Scrolls Laid to Rest After 74 Years,\" Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 6:38 pm.https://ots.org.il/straus-seminary-musmach- appointed-chief-rabbi-frankfurt/, \"Straus Seminary Musmach Elected Chief Rabbi of Frankfurt\", March 9, 2016. Many of the OTS graduates have joined the ranks of OTS trained Jewish Cultural Facilitators who provide formal and informal Jewish education for Israelis of all ages and backgrounds. This initiative works in conjunction with Israeli Community Centers. Media coverage has reported that these facilitators actively promote Jewish values, national unity, and heritage awareness in a non-coercive environment. ==OTS high schools== OTS has established 6 modern Orthodox high schools within the Jerusalem and Gush Etzion regions. All of these high schools offer official matriculation and have been awarded recognition of excellence from the Israeli Ministry of Education. ==OTS around the world== Each year, OTS sends spiritual and educational leaders to serve as emissaries in Jewish communities all over the world. These emissaries are active in synagogues, campuses and schools, and Jewish communities across the globe. ==Schools and programs== ===Programs for men=== * Joseph and Gwendolyn Straus Rabbinical Seminary * Robert M.
