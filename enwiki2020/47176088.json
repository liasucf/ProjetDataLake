Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote: \"Brian Herzlinger's How Sweet It Is, an ode to the healing powers of musical theater, misfires so badly at the beginning that it takes a while to notice when it goes from godawful to sweetly awful. Mr. Herzlinger, who wrote the script with Jay Black, comes out swinging, with cut-rate gags and unpleasant clich\u00e9s, not to mention the treacly number that plays over the opening credits.\" Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times also gave a negative review, writing: \"Piscopo - one of the two break-out stars in the 1980s class of Saturday Night Live [the other was Eddie Murphy] \u2013 isn't just too good for this film, he's too good to be giving it this much effort.\" Chris Packham from The Village Voice wrote: \"Like the climactic musical itself, the film pivots on silly people and absurd situations that demand total, unhinged commitment.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s musical films Category:English-language films Category:American musical films Category:American films ",
