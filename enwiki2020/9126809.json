Gerasimov presumably lived in Novgorod for most of his life and worked mainly with Novgorodian clerics. In his youth he studied in Livonia, where he learnt Latin and German. These languages he put to extensive use in his translations of religious texts (including Hieronymus' comments on the Vulgate, commentary on the Psalter compiled by Bruno of W\u00fcrzburg, and some tracts aimed at combating the Sect of Skhariya the Jew), and as an interpreter on Muscovite embassies to Emperor Maximilian I, Prussia, Sweden and Denmark. In 1525 he was an ambassador in his own right to Pope Clement VII, when the Grand Duke Vasily III desired to join the anti-Ottoman League. During his stay in Rome, Dmitri related details to Giovio of the geography of Russia and the northern countries. This information was compiled by Giovio into a separate book, and subsequently mapped by Battista Agnese in Venice and was a pattern for most 16th-century maps of Muscovy. Gerasimov also translated Ars grammatica by Aelius Donatus, juxtaposing the Latin grammar against that of Church Slavonic and proposing a terminology for Slavic grammar. He was a prominent collaborator of Maxim Grek, Greek-born humanist Michael Trivolis who worked in Russia. It is widely held that Gerasimov was the Russian translator of the Maximilianus Transylvanus' Letter on Magellan voyage. == See also == * The Tale of the Princes of Vladimir ==Sources== *Leo Bagrow.
