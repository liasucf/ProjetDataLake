    "text": "St. Andrew's Church is a historic church located at 44078 St. Andrew's Church Road, California near Leonardtown, St. Mary's County, Maryland. It was built in 1766 to serve as the parish church of St. Andrew's Parish, which had been established in 1744. It is a rectangular brick box church laid in Flemish bond with a gable roof and round-arched windows trimmed with brick segmental arches. At two corners stand two-story square brick towers with a diminutive spire. Richard Boulton designed the church in 1766; he was also responsible for the outstanding carving and ornamentation at Sotterley. George Plater (1735-1792), who briefly served as Maryland's governor before his death, was an active parish member, serving twenty-eight years as a vestryman. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. ==See also== * List of post 1692 Anglican parishes in the Province of Maryland ==References== ==External links== * *, including undated photo, at Maryland Historical Trust * Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Churches in St. Mary's County, Maryland Category:Anglican parishes in the Province of Maryland Category:Episcopal church buildings in Maryland Category:Churches completed in 1766 Category:18th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland Category:Leonardtown, Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in St. Mary's County, Maryland ",
