He studied medicine at Greifswald and Berlin, and was appointed an associate professor of anatomy at Halle in 1854. Five years later he became a full professor of anatomy and histology and director of the Anatomical Institute at the University of Bonn.\"Schultze, Max(imilian) Johann Sigismund\", in Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB). Band 23, Duncker & Humblot, Berlin 2007, , pp. 703 ff. He died in Bonn on 16 January 1874; his successor at the anatomical institute being Adolph von La Valette-St. George. He was the older brother of obstetrician Bernhard Sigmund Schultze (1827\u20131919). He founded, in 1865, and edited the important \"Archiv f\u00fcr mikroskopische Anatomie\", to which he contributed many papers, and he advanced the subject generally, by refining on its technical methods. His works included: *Beitr\u00e4ge zur Naturgeschichte der Turbellarien (1851). *Uber den Organismus der Polythalamien (1854). *Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntnis der Landplanarien (1857). *Zur Kenntnis der elektrischen Organe der Fische (1858). *Ein heizbarer Objecttisch und seine Verwendung bei Untersuchungen des Blutes, (In 1865 Schultze provided the first accurate description of the platelet). *Zur Anatomie und Physiologie der Retina (1866). His name is especially known for his work on the cell theory. Uniting F\u00e9lix Dujardin's conception of animal sarcode with Hugo von Mohl's of vegetable protoplasma, he pointed out their identity, and included them under the common name of protoplasm, defining the cell as a nucleated mass of protoplasm with or without a cell wall (Das Protoplasma der Rhizopoden und der Pflanzenzellen; ein Beitr\u00e4g zur Theorie der Zelle, 1863). Max Schultze studied medicine with the naturalist Fritz M\u00fcller, a German biologist and doctor who became a naturalized Brazilian. It was mainly because of his friendship and correspondence with Schultze that M\u00fcller to some extent was able to follow the debate in Europe about Darwin's theory of evolution. Max periodically sent him scientific literature, among which was Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and a small microscope manufactured in Berlin, by Friedrich Wilhelm Schiek (1857). Thanks to this microscope, M\u00fcller hypothesized from his own studies that \"all higher Crustacea probably will be traceable to a Zoea ancestor\". Based on these studies M\u00fcller also wrote his book F\u00fcr Darwin, in defense of Darwin's theories, corroborating the theory of natural selection. ==See also== * Schultze reagent ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:1825 births Category:1874 deaths Category:German zoologists Category:German anatomists Category:German microbiologists Category:People from Freiburg im Breisgau Category:University of Greifswald alumni Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:University of Halle faculty Category:University of Bonn faculty Category:People from the Grand Duchy of Baden ",
