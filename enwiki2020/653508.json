A brother, Wesley Jr., was born in 1903. The family moved to Memphis, where the brothers, who were not close, spent their childhood. Richard attended Memphis University School, where his favorite subjects were geography and history; he also showed promise as a violinist, and was a fair golfer and tennis player. In 1915 he developed a rapid heartbeat and spent some four months in bed before its symptoms were relieved. This included some time at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan, run by the eccentric and innovative John Harvey Kellogg, whose philosophy of care featured regular exercise, sound nutrition, and frequent enemas.Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and the Religion of Biologic Living- By Brian C. Wilson, Sept 18, 2014 - Indiana University Press In 1917, family tragedy struck when, following an apparent bout of rheumatic fever, Richard's brother, thought strong and in fine health, suddenly died. At 5'7\" (170 cm) and about 140 pounds (64 kg), Halliburton was never robust but would seldom complain of sickness or poor stamina.Jonathan Root, Richard Halliburton \u2013 The Magnificent Myth, p. 39 et seq. He graduated from the Lawrenceville School in 1917, where he was chief editor of The Lawrence. In 1921 he graduated from Princeton University, where he was on the editorial board of The Daily Princetonian and chief editor of The Princetonian Pictorial Magazine. He also attended courses in public speaking and considered a career as a lecturer.Jonathan Root, Richard Halliburton \u2013 The Magnificent Myth, p. 44 et seq. The first in a series of syndicated columns Richard Halliburton wrote for newspapers across the country carried an editorial biography of the travel writer. See, for instance, The Sunday Magazine, Milwaukee Journal, September 2, 1934 ==Career== ===\"An even tenor\"=== Historical marker for Richard Halliburton in Brownsville, Tennessee Leaving college temporarily during 1919, Halliburton became an ordinary seaman and boarded the freighter Octorara that July, bound from New Orleans to England. He toured historic places in London and Paris, but soon returned to Princeton in early 1920 to finish his schooling. His trip inspired in him a lust for even more travel. Voiced in different ways, seizing the day became his credo. The words of Oscar Wilde, who in works like The Picture of Dorian Gray enjoined experiencing the moment before it vanished, inspired Halliburton to reject marriage, family, a regular job, and conventional respectability as the obvious steps after graduation. He liked bachelorhood, youthful adventure, and the thrill of the unknown. To earn a living he intended to write about his adventures. He dedicated his first book to his Princeton roommates, \"...whose sanity, consistency and respectability ... drove [him] to this book\". Halliburton's father advised him to get the wanderlust out of his system, return to Memphis and adjust his life to \"an even tenor\": > \"I hate that expression\", Richard responded, expressing the view that > distinguished his life-style, \"and as far as I am able I intend to avoid > that condition. When impulse and spontaneity fail to make my way uneven then > I shall sit up nights inventing means of making my life as conglomerate and > vivid as possible.... And when my time comes to die, I'll be able to die > happy, for I will have done and seen and heard and experienced all the joy, > pain and thrills\u2014any emotion that any human ever had\u2014and I'll be especially > happy if I am spared a stupid, common death in bed.\" Reprinted Memphis > Magazine, April 2001 ===Lecturer and pioneer of adventure journalism=== While Halliburton was attending Princeton, Field and Stream magazine paid him $150 for an article (). This initial success encouraged him to choose travel writing as a career. His fortunes changed when a representative of the Feakins Agency heard him deliver a talk, and soon Halliburton was given bookings for lectures. Despite a high-pitched voice and occasional discomfort on the details, Halliburton displayed such enthusiasm and recounted such vivid recreations of his often bizarre foreign encounters that he became popular with audiences. On the strength of his lecturing and increasing celebrity appeal, publisher Bobbs- Merrill, whose editor-in-chief David Laurance Chambers was also a Princeton graduate, accepted Halliburton's first book, The Royal Road to Romance (1925).Cf. Jonathan Root, Halliburton \u2013 The Magnificent Myth, op. cit., pp. 100\u2013105 Halliburton's first book, published in 1925 by Bobbs-Merrill as The Royal Road to Romance, became a bestseller. Two years later he published The Glorious Adventure, which retraced Ulysses' adventures throughout the Classical Greek world as recounted in Homer's Odyssey, and which included his visiting the grave of English poet Rupert Brooke on the island of Skyros. In 1929, Halliburton published New Worlds To Conquer, which recounted his famous swim of the Panama Canal, his retracing the track of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s' conquest of Mexico, and his cast in the role, in full goat-skin costume, of Robinson Crusoe (Alexander Selkirk), \"cast away\" on the island of Tobago. Animals figure prominently in this and many other of Halliburton's adventures. ===Ascent to fame=== Halliburton's friends during this time included movie stars, writers, musicians, painters, and politicians, including writers Gertrude Atherton and Kathleen Norris, Senator James Phelan and philanthropist No\u00ebl Sullivan, and actors Ram\u00f3n Novarro and Rod La Rocque. Casual acquaintances were many, as lectures, personal appearances (notably to promote India Speaks), syndicated columns, and radio broadcasts made him a household name associated with romantic travel.For Mallory and other names mentioned see Index in Gerry Max, Horizon Chasers \u2013 The Lives and Adventures of Richard Halliburton and Paul Mooney. McFarland and Company, 2007 Halliburton was acquainted with swashbuckling cinema star Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who was also a world traveler. Halliburton himself, though several times approached about film versions of his adventures (notably by Fox Film Corporation in 1933 for The Royal Road to Romance), only appeared in one movie, the Walter Futter- produced semi-documentary India Speaks (1932; re-released in 1947 as Bride of Buddha or Bride of the East). ===Flying Carpet Expedition=== Halliburton (forward) and Moye Stephens (aft) shaking hands from Stearman C-3B Flying Carpet, NR882N In 1930 Halliburton hired pioneer aviator Moye Stephens on the strength of a handshake for no pay, but unlimited expenses\"Moye W. Stephens, Richard Halliburton and the Flying Carpet\". Reprinted in part from Tarpa Topics (The Retired Trans World Airlines Pilot's Magazine), April 1996. Accessed online January 2, 2008\u2014to fly him around the world in an open cockpit biplane. The modified Stearman C-3B was named the Flying Carpet after the magic carpet of fairy tales, subsequently the title of his 1932 best-seller. They embarked on \"one of the most fantastic, extended air journeys ever recorded\" taking 18 months to circumnavigate the globe, covering 33,660 miles (54,100 km) and visiting 34 countries. The pair started on Christmas Day 1930, making stops along the way, from Los Angeles to New York City, where they crated the airplane and boarded it on the oceanliner RMS Majestic. They sailed to England, where their extended mission began. They flew to France, then Spain, the British possession of Gibraltar, and on to Africa at Fez, Morocco (where Stephens performed aerobatics for the first air meet held in that country). They crossed the Atlas mountains and set out across the Sahara to Timbuktu, using the fuel caches of the Shell Oil Company. While in Timbuktu, they were guests of Pere Yakouba, a French Augustinian monk who had years before fled from the distractions of modern society and become patriarch and a noted scholar of the community. They flew to their destination without mishap, then continued eastward, spending several weeks in Algeria with the French Foreign Legion, and continuing via Cairo and Damascus, with a side trip to Petra. Elly Beinhorn in Morocco, 1931 In Persia (now Iran) they met German aviator Elly Beinhorn, who was grounded by mechanical problems. They assisted her and then worked out shared itineraries. Later, Halliburton wrote a foreword to her book Flying Girl about these and other of her adventures in the air. Now exhausted, and their plane tiring, Stephens and Halliburton continued their eastward journey. In Persia, Crown Princess Mahin Banu had a ride in the airplane. In neighbouring Iraq, the young Crown Prince Ghazi had a ride; they flew him over his school yard. In India, Halliburton visited the Taj Mahal, which he had first visited in 1922. In Nepal, as The Flying Carpet flew past Mount Everest, Halliburton stood up in the open cockpit of the plane and took the first aerial photograph of the mountain. To the delight of an amazed Maharajah of Nepal, Stephens and Beinhorn performed daring aerobatics. In Borneo, Halliburton and Stephens were feted by Sylvia Brett, wife of the White Rajah of Sarawak. They gave her a ride, making Ranee Sylvia the first woman to fly in that country. At the Rajang River, they took the chief of the Dyak head hunters for a flight: he gave them 60 kilos of shrunken heads, which they dared not refuse but dumped as soon as possible. They were the first Americans to fly to the Philippines: after arriving in Manila on April 27, the plane was again loaded onto a ship () to cross the ocean. They flew the final leg from San Francisco to Los Angeles. A fictionalized account of his travels in India and Asia was depicted in the 1933 film India Speaks. Moye Stephens was a skilled pilot. Halliburton, in a reassuring letter to his parents (January 23, 1932), recited his many flight skills. Stephens, for instance, during one aerobatic display, astutely aborted a slow roll the moment he realized that Halliburton had not fastened his seat belt. Stephens later became chief test pilot of the Northrop Flying Wing, which evolved into today's B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. The around-the-world trip had cost Halliburton over $50,000, plus fuel; in the first year, the book he entitled The Flying Carpet (after his valiant plane) earned him royalties of $100,000, in those depression-era days a remarkably large sum.See Ronald Gilliam, \"Around the World in the Flying Carpet.\" Aviation History, vol. 14, issue 5 (May 2004), pp. 22\u201360. Earlier recounted in Richard Halliburton, The Flying Carpet (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1932), with itinerary maps. Retold in Jonathan Root, Richard Halliburton \u2013 The Magnificent Myth, pp. 169\u2013205. Cf. Gerry Max, Horizon Chasers, pp. 77\u201391. On the preface to the Elly Beinhorn book issued by Halliburton's own British publisher Goeffrey Bles see Richard Halliburton \u2013 His Story of His Life's Adventure As Told in Letters to His Mother and Father (Bobbs-Merrill, 1940), p. 352 Barbara H. Schultz's Flying Carpets, Flying Wings \u2013 The Biography of Moye Stephens (2011), besides recounting the Flying Carpet Expedition from a flier's viewpoint as well as documenting Stephens' (1906\u20131995) contributions to aviation history, contains Stephens' extended reports of the adventure. With rare glimpses into the travel writer's art, these give historic balance to Halliburton's often romanticized renditions. ===Commissioned research travel and feature article writing=== Early in 1934 the Bell Syndicate Newspapers contracted with newspapers throughout the United States, beginning with the Boston Globe, to publish weekly feature stories prepared by Halliburton. Of about one thousand words each with pictures, ultimately fifty stories resulted. Among these were stories on the Seri Indians of Southern California; Fort Jefferson, where Dr. Samuel Mudd, convicted of conspiracy in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, was imprisoned; Admiral Richmond Pearson Hobson, who deliberately sank his own ship during the Spanish\u2013American War, and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba a month later; Henri Christophe and the Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re in Haiti; Christopher Columbus, Lord Byron, and \"The Girl from Martinique Who Wrecked Napoleon\". Paid well, Halliburton traveled extensively to fulfill his end of the deal: to Cuba, Haiti, Martinique, to Miami, Washington, D. C. (to do research at the Library of Congress), to New York, to Europe, and ultimately to Russia. At the height of his popularity and self-fulfillment, he appeared on radio, attended celebrity parties (including one at the home of novelist Kathleen Norris who, like Halliburton, had stories regularly featured in the newspapers), and, after the purchase of a used Ford roadster, explored the heartland of California and the beauties of the Lake Tahoe area. Other commissions followed: United Artists, producing a movie about Benvenuto Cellini, asked him to do a story on the Renaissance artist's love life. The lectures continued. Halliburton even turned down \"job\" offers, one of which was for the considerable sum of $500 a week, for 26 weeks, from a radio company \"to speak on a beer program\". Meanwhile, besides the Memphis Commercial Appeal, newspapers in Milwaukee, Kansas City, Columbus, and Toronto published his syndicated stories. At the end of the year, he was again in Europe to commence his dream of emulating Hannibal and crossing the Alps on an elephant, one chosen for the task from a Paris zoo and given the name \"Miss Dalrymple.\" The following year Bobbs-Merrill published Halliburton's Seven League Boots, filled with his latest adventures and arguably the last of the great travel works of the classic period.See Richard Halliburton \u2013 His Story of His Life's Adventure As Told in Letters to His Mother and Father (Bobbs- Merrill, 1940), pp. 349\u2013355, quoted p. 350. \"Commissioned travel and writing\" submitted by Gerry Max ===Hangover House in Laguna Beach, California=== Hangover House (2016); the word \"HANGOVER\" (in mirror writing) is stamped into the concrete retaining wall In 1937 William Alexander Levy designed a house for Halliburton in Laguna Beach, California, which is now known as \"a landmark of modern architecture.\" Alexander was a novice architect, a recent graduate of the New York University School of Architecture and close friend of Paul Mooney. Mooney managed the construction of the house. The house, built of concrete and steel and fortress-like in appearance, contained a spacious living room, a spacious dining room and three bedrooms: one for Halliburton, which featured a wall-sized map of the world; one for Mooney; and one for Levy. Because of its position, perched 400 feet (120m) above a sheer canyon, it was called \"Hangover House\" by Mooney, and this title was cast into a retaining wall on the site. Writer Ayn Rand, who visited the house in 1937 when she was still an unknown writer, is believed to have based the \"Heller House\" in The Fountainhead (1943) upon Halliburton's home.Wells, Ted. \"Hangover House: An Obscure Modern Masterpiece.\" Ted Wells' Living Simple: Architecture, Design, and Living, 7 March 2007: Also see Gerry Max, \"House in Flight\", in Horizon Chasers, op. cit, pp. 139\u2013171 ===Sea Dragon expedition and disappearance=== On September 23, 1938, Halliburton boarded the , bound for Hong Kong. From Hong Kong he intended to sail a Chinese junk across the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. The junk, named the Sea Dragon (),The four characters on the stern read from right to left as \u9999\u6e2f\u6d77\u9f8d, which state the port (Hong Kong) along with the name of the ship. Refer to contemporary photographs such as the one posted to was an essentially Wenchow-style junk, 75 feet in length, modified to Halliburton's specifications and built in the shipyards of Kowloon by cartwright Fat Kau. Its stern emblazoned with a colorful dragon and interior hull equipped with a diesel engine, the Sea Dragon, a dramatic symbol of East meeting West, was to be an attraction at the Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE) in San Francisco (at Treasure Island); there, after its three-month voyage across the Pacific, it would dock and, for a small admission fee, take fair-goers on excursions around San Francisco Bay. According to Halliburton's first cousin, whom he visited in 1938, the trip was meant, in part, to renew interest in Halliburton whose fame at the time was in decline. Biographers credit the idea for the voyage to Walter Gaines Swanson, who, as the Exposition's public relations manager, promoted its goal of celebrating both the Oakland and Golden Gate bridges as well as the cultures of the Pacific rim. Despite an interest in sailing craft since childhood, Halliburton himself had little practical navigation experience. Seeking capable leadership, he hired veteran mariner John Wenlock Welch as his captain and Henry Von Fehren as his engineer. Besides Halliburton's secretary Paul Mooney, the initial crew included George Barstow III, a 21-year-old student at Juilliard, and engineer's assistant Richard Davis (who bowed out). Crew composition would change. A Chinese messboy, Chinese bosun and two Chinese sailors ultimately completed the crew. After inspecting a number of junks along the China coast, finding most either too expensive or wholly unseaworthy, Halliburton decided to have a junk built. Though it took less than six weeks to complete, its construction was marked by cost overruns, delays, engineering errors, and what Halliburton perceived as the primitive work habits of the Chinese carpenters, issues prompting him to write, \"If any one of my readers wishes to be driven rapidly and violently insane, and doesn't know how to go about it, let me make a suggestion: Try building a Chinese junk in a Chinese shipyard during a war with Japan.\" Funding for the project was from the start a main problem. The corporate sponsors whom Halliburton approached thought the risks of the enterprise greater than its rewards. Chinese venture capitalists in Chinatown thought it far too dangerous in a China torn by war and Buick refused to be associated with something called a \"junk\". While the Sea Dragon Expedition was partly crowdfunded through paid subscriptions to a projected series of progress reports Halliburton intended to send from China, sales from commemorative tokens and other keepsakes, besides the tourist excursions, were expected sources of revenue. Major and immediate funding, however, came from Halliburton's wealthy relatives, including the wife of his cousin Erle Halliburton; $14,000 of the $26,500 raised--perhaps $300,000 to $400,000 in today's money, came from the three crew members from Dartmouth: Robert Chase, John \"Brue\" Potter, and Gordon Torrey, lads with extensive amateur sailing experience. A trial run in January 1939 revealed its flaws; the completed Sea Dragon, distinctly top heavy, rode precariously low, rolling and heeling in moderately active waters. Halliburton nevertheless assured his subscribers, on January 27, that the dry deck of the craft indicated its buoyancy and, implicitly, its sea-worthiness. To improve its stability, however, ten tons of concrete ballast were supposedly poured into its hull. There were other concerns. Many observers, most notably, thought the heavy diesel engine, which released endangering fumes, was out of place aboard a vessel that traditionally sailed sufficiently without mechanical assistance. Chief Officer Dale Collins of the , moreover, noted, as did others, that the masts and sails were far too heavy, and that the poop deck, meant to house a radio cabin and galley, was higher than befit a junk of its size. The first attempted voyage in February was forced to turn back on February 14 after a week at sea, due to an illness among the crew. For medical reasons, Potter stayed behind after the junk's unsuccessful first voyage and, as would Torrey, later offered an account of his experiences in Hong Kong. Besides poor performance by the junk in rough seas, the February attempt was aborted as the result of an injury Potter had sustained when struck by the mainsail boom while handling the -long tiller. Sea Dragon Expedition researcher Gerry Max has noted, as an added factor, that Potter (as Torrey who didn't make the trip, and a couple other crew members who did) may have contracted gonorrhea during his time in Hong Kong. Dysentery also afflicted several crew members, including Captain Welch. Halliburton himself suffered from a skin rash, the result perhaps of high anxiety and nervous exhaustion. Days before the first crossing attempt, Mooney broke an ankle after falling down a ladder. Halliburton sent four letters to subscribers from Hong Kong between November 20, 1938 and February 16, 1939; the fifth, he promised, would be sent from Midway Island. Hastily repaired and recaulked, the Sea Dragon left port once again on March 4, 1939. Recruits added to replace Potter and Torrey were able-bodied seamen Ben Flagg and Ralph Granrud, both in their early twenties. His seaman skills uncertain, globe-trotter Velman Fitch, at the last minute, hitched a ride. The first couple weeks of the voyage, if uneventful, went according to plan. Calamity struck suddeny when, three weeks out to sea, on March 23, the ship sailed into a typhoon and at a point approximately west of Midway, where it was due to call on April 3. Presumed the closest friendly ship to the junk, perhaps away, was the liner President Coolidge, itself battling mountainous seas some west of Midway Island and presumed on its way for a rendezvous with the beleaguered craft. Among the radio messages the liner received from the junk's Captain Welch was an ironically cheerful one: \"Having a wonderful time. Wish you were here instead of me.\" As noted by the Coolidge waves during those dire moments were estimated at high. The next message was different: \"Southerly gale. Heavy Rain Squalls. High sea. Barometer 29.46. True course 100. Speed 5.5 knots. Position 1200 GCT 31.10 north 155.00 east. All well. When closer may we avail ourselves of your direction finder. Regards Welch.\" That was the last message heard from the junk. Until then, Halliburton had kept regular, if sporadic, contact with radio stations and trans-Pacific ocean liners. At first the Coast Guard at Hawaii delayed searching for the missing ship, possibly thinking Halliburton staged his disappearance as a publicity stunt. After Sea Dragon was overdue to call at Midway by a week, on April 10, friends petitioned the Coast Guard to send a search vessel. A Yugoslavian freighter, , was the first to arrive at the last reported position of Sea Dragon, on April 16. Later in May, an extensive US Navy search with several ships and scout planes, including , scouring over the course of many days, found no trace of the junk or the crew, and the effort was ended. Halliburton's mother abandoned hope that he would be found alive by June. As with Amelia Earhart, many rumors and reports of Halliburton's fate continued to arise over the years, with fans hoping he might yet turn up alive. The ocean liner , captained by Charles Jokstad, passed flotsam in the middle of the Pacific, covered with an estimated one year-old growth of barnacles in 1940 and believed to be from the wreck of the Sea Dragon, perhaps the ship's rudder. Later, in 1945 a 30-foot skeleton of a 150-foot boat of oriental design, mistaken by some as that of the 75-foot Sea Dragon, washed ashore in San Diego California. Richard Halliburton's monument Missing at sea since March 1939, Halliburton was declared dead on October 5, 1939 by the Memphis Chancery Court. His empty grave is at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis at the Halliburton family gravesite. His ghost is reputed to haunt his final residence, Hangover House, completed in 1938 by architect William Alexander Levy in Laguna Beach. ==Personal life== Halliburton never married. While young he dated several young women and, as revealed in letters to them, was infatuated with at least two of them. As an adult, his companions were chiefly male. Among those romantically linked to him were film star Ram\u00f3n Novarro and philanthropist No\u00ebl Sullivan, both of whom enjoyed, as Halliburton, a bohemian lifestyle.Allan R. Ellenberger, Ram\u00f3n Novarro: A Biography of the Silent Film Idol, 1899\u20131968, McFarland and Company, 1999. . p. 141Andr\u00e9 Soares, Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ram\u00f3n Novarro, St. Martin's Press, 2002. . p.163. See also Gerry Max, Horizon Chasers \u2013 The Lives and Adventures of Richard Halliburton and Paul Mooney, op. cit., p. 3 et passim Halliburton's most enduring relationship was with freelance journalist Paul Mooney, with whom he often shared living quarters and who assisted him with his written work.For recent views, and approaches, see Charles E. Morris III, \"Richard Halliburton's Bearded Tales\", Quarterly Journal of Speech, Vol. 95, No. 2, May, 2009, pp. 123-147 regarding Halliburton's \"sexual provenance\" as well as \"closet eloquence, or rhetorical repertories of sexual passing in U. S. history.\" French police reports, dated 1935, noted the famed traveler's homosexual activity when in Paris at about the time of his planned crossing by elephant over the Alps: \"Mr Halliburton is a homosexual well known in some specialized establishments. He is in the habit of soliciting on Saint-Lazare Street\"Archives of the Paris Police Prefecture, report n\u00b069000.245 from the Vice Squad (Brigade Mondaine), quoted by Fran\u00e7ois Buot, Gay Paris. Une histoire du Paris interlope entre 1900 et 1942, Fayard 2013. p.282 : \"Mr Halliburton est un homosexuel tr\u00e8s connu dans certains \u00e9tablissements sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s. Il a pris l'habitude de racoler rue Saint-Lazare.\" (near the station of the same name). ===Private writing=== Halliburton admired English poet Rupert Brooke (1887\u20131915), whose beauty and patriotic verse captivated a generation. Halliburton intended to write his biography and kept ample notes for the task, interviewing in person or corresponding with prominent British literary and salon figures who had known Brooke, including Lady Violet Asquith Bonham-Carter, Walter de la Mare, Cathleen Nesbitt, Noel Olivier, Alec Waugh, and Virginia Woolf. Halliburton never began the book, but his notes were used by Arthur Springer to write Red Wine of Youth\u2014A Biography of Rupert Brooke (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1952).Richard Halliburton Papers: Correspondence , Manuscripts Division, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library. Accessed online 2 January 2008. Gerry Max, Horizon Chasers, p. 12 et passim. Also Jonathan Root, Halliburton--The Magnificent Myth, p. 70 et passim A vigorous correspondent, Halliburton wrote numerous letters to fans, friends, editors, sponsors, and literary acquaintances. To his parents alone, he wrote well over a thousand letters; a large selection of these, edited in part by his father Wesley, was published in 1940 by Bobbs-Merrill as Richard Halliburton: His Story of His Life's Adventure As Told to His Mother and Father. ==Character of published work== In his colorful and simply-told travel adventures Halliburton was the \"innocent abroad\", receptive to new ideas and with a quiet erudition. He displayed a romantic readiness which shone through his best prose, prose at once picturesque, gently informative, extroverted (though self-enlisted), and personally confiding. He often described his attaching himself to a famous historic person (and key event for which that person was known) or to a revered place, such as the Taj Mahal. Acting as sort of an emcee, or performing some often cleverly garish stunt, he recalled that person and invoked a place associated with him; by so doing, he escorted readers into a different time and to a different locale, with of course some compelling modern touches. Thus he duplicated Hannibal's crossing of the Alps by elephant \u2013 naming the pachyderm he had gotten from a Paris zoo Miss Elysabethe Dalrymple; he emulated Ulysses' myriad adventures in the Mediterranean dressed often as a beach-comber or playboy; he re-enacted Robinson Crusoe's island solitude, adopting a menagerie of domestic pets with names such as Listerine, Kitty and Susie. Examples of the device filled his work and helped define his public image: of further note, he retraced the fateful expedition of Hernando Cortez to the heart of the Aztec Empire; like his hero Lord Byron, he swam the Hellespont, metaphorically bridging Europe and Asia; and he lived among the French Foreign Legion in North Africa. He did not just view legendary places and landscapes, but often embraced them by some athletic feat ultimately intended to thrill armchair travelers as well as to educate them: he swam the Panama Canal, climbed the Matterhorn and Mount Fuji (its first documented winter ascent), and twice he descended into the Mayan Well of Death, the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza. The occasional trouble that he received from authorities only contributed to the drama of his adventures: taking photos of the guns at Gibraltar (and being arrested for it as a breach of security); attempting to enter Mecca, which is forbidden to non-Muslims; hiding from gatekeepers on the grounds of the Taj Mahal, to experience in solitude the sunset as well as to swim under the moonlight in the pool facing the tomb. Halliburton's books were meant for the general reading public. What racial comments Halliburton made, though casual and for his time not unique to him, are unsettling today. Describing a hiking trip in the Rocky Mountains at age twenty, for instance, he commented that his two Indian guides were \"as irresponsible as our southern niggers.\" See Richard Halliburton, His Story of His Life's Adventures (Bobbs-Merrill,1940), Letter, July 20, 1920, p. 59. See also Jonathan Root, Halliburton \u2013 The Magnificent Myth, p. 55. \"Character of Published Work\" provided by Gerry Max. Halliburton's love of the world's natural wonders, and such monuments of mankind which seemed best to blend into those wonders, derives in part from the Romanticism of poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge (acquaintance with whom may have been sharpened by his exposure at Princeton to English Professor Henry Van Dyke, a popular essayist and poet of his time, who also had been a teacher of Halliburton's editor David Laurance Chambers). As theirs, Halliburton's view of technology was dim, and he gently urged that one see the world's marvels before \"modern Progress\" obliterated them.See Richard Halliburton, The Book of Marvels \u2013 The Occident (Bobbs-Merrill, c1937), pp. 154\u2013155. Halliburton was a cultural relativist: he adhered to the credibility of multiple perspectives and believed that \"culture was king\", stances which may explain his claim of purchasing a slave child in Africa \u2013 which did not happen, according to Moye Stephens \u2013 or adopting the garb of a particular region to \"go native.\" As a sort of cultural ambassador, he met heads of state from Peruvian dictator Augusto Leguia, to Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, to the Last Emperor of China, to King Feisal al Husain of Iraq and his son the Crown Prince.Comments submitted by Gerry Max. An early letter (1923) expressed his \"virulent antipathy for democracy as practiced in America\" and a hatred \"for the laboring class\", but these views contrast with the plight he shared with the downtrodden, as at Devil's Island, and his occasional working with rough-hewn seamen. His last writings, done in collaboration with journalist Paul Mooney, the four letters (of a projected seven) comprising Letters from the Sea Dragon as well as the fifteen articles comprising The Log of the Sea Dragon--in their descriptions of the displacement of peoples engendered by the Japanese advance, suggest the war-reportorial course his writing might have taken had he lived. A news correspondent's role is also suggested by his skilled interview with the executioner of the Romanovs, the last ruling dynasty of Russia.Gerry Max, Horizon Chasers, p. 7 et seq. The claims of the man Halliburton interviewed, Peter Zacharovitch Ermakov, have been discredited. See John Maxwell Hamilton, Journalism's Roving Eye \u2013 A History of American Foreign Reporting (Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2009), p. 259. For an additional view about Halliburton's racial attitudes, see p. 257; about his sexuality, see pp. 257\u2013258. For Halliburton's early view on democracy, see letter and comment, in James Cortese, Richard Halliburton's Royal Road(White Rose Press, Memphis, c1989), pp. 94\u201395 Distinguished by their readerliness, the essays of historic personages appearing in both his books and newspaper articles, notably of Spanish\u2013American War hero Captain Richard Hobson and of Haitian leader Henri Christophe, show the skills of the natural biographer, and offer further hint of career evolution. ==Legacy== Publisher James O'Reilly, who reissued The Royal Road to Romance to celebrate the centenary of Halliburton's birth, characterizes him thus: \"From the Jazz Age through the Great Depression to the eve of World War II, he thrilled an entire generation of readers.\" He was \"clever, resourceful, undaunted, cheerful in the face of dreadful odds, ever-optimistic about the world and the people around him, always scheming about his next adventure.\"Quoted by James O'Reilly in his introduction to the 2000 reprint of Royal Road to Romance He notes that Halliburton's \"manhood spanned the brief interval between the two World Wars\" and acclaims him as a \"spokesman for the youth of a generation.\" Halliburton throughout his career also insisted on the importance of travel abroad as a means to self-improvement and discovery. He was an advocate by example of the 'grand tour' championed by monarchs from the days of Henry VIII, and fostered the study abroad programs featured in the curricula of many colleges and universities today. Halliburton wanted to be remembered as the most-traveled man who had ever lived, though he was bested in that regard by contemporary globetrotters, and influences, Burton Holmes and Harry Franck. In his day he had few rivals, though Eugene Wright (The Great Horn Spoon) and Martin and Osa Johnson (Safari) could as equally captivate. Halliburton influenced his contemporaries Thomas Wolfe, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Corey Ford and Ernest Hemingway. Writers Paul Theroux, Jim Harrison and Susan Sontag, among others, have offered debts of gratitude for his influence on their work. Television news celebrity and author Walter Cronkite, who heard him lecture in the mid-1930s, credited Halliburton with steering him into a career in journalism.For Walter Cronkite see his A Reporter's Life (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996), pp. 34-35. As the writer of a succession of bestsellers, and as a popular lecturer, Halliburton figured prominently in educating several generations of young Americans in the rudiments of geography, history and culture, especially through his two Books of Marvels,See, for instance, Gerry Max, \"Richard Halliburton and Thomas Wolfe: When Youth Kept Open House\", North Carolina Literary Review no. 5 (1996), 82\u201393. Also see Horizon Chasers, p. 5, also 7 et seq. For Eugene Wright, see p. 262n21 re-issued in one volume after his death. Halliburton Tower, Rhodes College (2009) Two structures commemorate Halliburton: Hangover House in Laguna Beach, California, and the Memorial Tower at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee. Architecture historian and writer Ted Wells considers Hangover House, which Halliburton commissioned, one of the \"best modern houses in the United States\".Wells, Ted. \"Hangover House: An Obscure Modern Masterpiece.\" Ted Wells' Living Simple: Architecture, Design, and Living, 7 March 2007: Nearly a quarter century after Halliburton's disappearance, his father donated $400,000 to build an imposing bell tower. It was dedicated in 1962 as the Richard Halliburton Memorial Tower, and the elder man died the following year at age 95. In his Second Book of Marvels, Halliburton stated, \"Astronomers say that the Great Wall is the only man-made thing on our planet visible to the human eye from the moon.\" Although untrue, this statement was a possible source for the urban legend that the Great Wall of China could be seen from space.Great Walls of Liar, Snopes.com.
