Grant as Professor Julius Greengrass * Laura Fraser as Polly * Antonia Bernath as Jimi * Adam F as Chapman * Tamsin Greig as Simon * Richard Brake as Lone Wolf ==Production== Cuckoo was shot on location in December 2007 and January 2008 in London and Norwich, and in a studio built in a disused grain warehouse in Yarmouth. Filming locations included Berwick Street and Wardour Street in Soho in London. ==Release== The premiere of Cuckoo was premiered in September 2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival, where Clive James called the film \"masterly and thrilling\". Other UK film festival screenings followed at the last Filmstock festival in Luton, attended by Shere Hite who called Cuckoo \"gripping from beginning to end\", and at Glasgow Film Festival in February 2010, after which Scottish arts magazine The Skinny wrote that the film was \"as tangible a representation of a troubled mind as you are likely to encounter on film\". Cuckoo was released in UK cinemas on 17 December 2010 by Verve Pictures and on DVD, Blu-ray and iTunes in the UK by Verve Pictures on 28 February 2011.

Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph wrote \"After a debut as impressive as The Gigolos, writer-director Richard Bracewell concocts a dismayingly daft script for this shoestring psychological thriller\". David Jenkins in Time Out commented that the film was \"not particularly exciting or original, especially as it's never made quite clear what all the fuss is about\". Andrew Lowry in Total Film called it \"well-intentioned but fairly undramatic\". In a four-star Daily Mirror review, David Edwards wrote that the film was \"an unsettling, unconventional ... quite unlike anything our film industry is pumping out these days\", adding that \"Fraser is superb as a woman who just might be on the verge of a nervous breakdown\". In a four-star Den of Geek review, Doralba Picerno wrote that Cuckoo was \"a little gem of a movie ... which will keep you engrossed for its duration and get you to do a lot of thinking about it afterwards. This is independent British cinema at its best, a thought-provoking feature where there are no clear demarcations of either guilt or reality and the atmosphere is rarefied and eerie.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * Guardian Film Weekly podcast interview with Jason Solomons and Richard Bracewell * ITV Anglia News report on set in Yarmouth.
