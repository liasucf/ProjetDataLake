This building is called the Pearce Block in memory of Mr T. Pearce who was rector from around 1904 to 1929. Subsequent buildings were named after George Uttley, Malcolm Leadbetter, Don Grant and Laurie Cornwell. The gymnasium was named after Jim Page. Southland Boys High School The west end of the Pearce Block suffered a fire during Easter 1980 which was well recorded in the 1980 year book \"The Southlandian\". The fire extensively damaged three class rooms on the upper floor whilst the Rector's, DP's and Senior Master's offices on the ground floor were water damaged (in the right hand side of the photo). The school co-hosted the 2006 State Twenty20 Cricket Knock-Out Tournament in Invercargill. ==Notable alumni== Well-known former students include Jeremy Waldron, who attended the school until 1970 and is now a prominent legal and political philosopher in the United States, and Andrew White, who played rugby for the All Blacks in the 1920s. Back in the early 1980s there were several rows of framed photos in the downstairs corridor of the Grant Block of Old Boys who had gone on to represent New Zealand at rugby or cricket. One student, Brian McKechnie, is the only Double All Black to date. He played 26 Tests for the All Blacks between 1977-1981 at Full Back and First Five-Eighth and also represented The New Zealand Black Caps in Cricket between 1975-1981. The Leadbetter Wing also had framed photos of the First 15 rugby team dating back to around 1913. Other notable All Blacks are 100 test veteran Malili (Mils) Muliaina, former captain Paul Henderson who also played professional rugby for the Highlanders in Super Rugby, props Jamie Mackintosh, and Clarke Dermody. The school also has a proud tradition in providing New Zealand schoolboys Rugby representatives. Recent names include Robbie Robinson, John Hardie and Scott Eade. Outside sport, George Mason has made a name for himself in television with recurring roles in hit programs such as Shortland Street, Go Girls, and most recently Home and Away (Australian soap).
