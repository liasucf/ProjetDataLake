Adhikari also learned the Tamil martial art Kalaripayattu under the able guidance of Indian facilitator Arka Mukhopadhyay.

Rashtriya Rangothsava in Bengaluru, India (2018). Adhikari had his directorial debut at the Short and Sweet theatre festival in Kolkata in 2015 with a ten-minute play titled One Two Three. In 2016, Adhikari had his maiden silver screen venture as an actor in the critically acclaimed Bengali film Tope - The Bait, directed by Buddhadeb Dasgupta, which travelled to the Toronto International Film Festival, the 60th BFI London Film Festival, and the 21st Busan International Film Festival.
