    "text": "Mohamed Harkat () (born August 6, 1968, Algeria) is a native-born Algerian and permanent resident of Canada who was arrested in 2002 on suspicion of ties to terrorism and was imprisoned under security certificates. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) alleged that he entered the country as a sleeper agent for al-Qaeda. He had worked in Pakistan from 1990-1994 for a charity that assisted refugees. After immigrating to Canada in 1995, Harkat applied for refugee status and for a Permanent Resident card. He worked as a gas station attendant and a deliveryman for Pizza Pizza during his first seven years in Canada. He was released on May 23, 2006 under house arrest, while fighting deportation. ==Early life and education== Mohamed Harkat was born in Taguine, Algeria to El-Ait, and is one of seven sons. His father was born in Algeria, but worked both there and in France in the construction business. As a student at the University of Oran, Harkat joined the Front Islamique du Salut (FIS) in 1989, when it was still a legitimate political movement. He offered them the use of a family-owned house in Zmalet El Emir Abdelkader as a registered district office. Harkat was excused from Algerian military service because he broke his left leg as a child and it never properly healed.Transcript of proceedings - Federal Court File No. DES-4-02 \"In the matter of Mohammed Harkat\", heard at Ottawa, Ontario, October 27, 2004, pp. 179-181. In March 1990, the Algerian government stormed the house and arrested the FIS members within. Harkat was not present, and was warned by his uncle that security forces were seeking him. ==Leaving Algeria== Harkat departed in April 1990 for a trip to Saudi Arabia using a Hajj passport. From there he travelled to Pakistan, where the Muslim World League employed him and sent him to Peshawar in May 1990, to help distribute relief packages and organise aid programs.CSIS interview of Harkat, May 1, 1997 For the next four years, Harkat worked and lived out of a Babbi warehouse. He picked up shipments of food and relief supplies for the refugee camps in the city from the Peshawar airport and train station, earning $300\u2013500 monthly.Transcript of proceedings - Federal Court File No. DES-4-02, In the matter of Mohammed Harkat, heard at Ottawa, Ontario, October 27, 2004, pp. 85, 91-101, 117, 124-125, 128-129. CSIS has alleged that during this time he also worked for Human Concern International. They suggest that this meant he was a formal colleague of Ahmed Khadr, and that he may have run a guest house for foreign mujahideen traveling to participate in the Afghan civil war.Duffy, Andrew. Ottawa Citizen, \"Terror suspect once worked on Khadr's behalf: CSIS\" , Vancouver Sun, May 29, 2009 In June 1994 Harkat lost his job. He lived off his $18,000 in savings for the next year.October 28, 2004 testimony by Harkat He has made contradictory statements suggesting he either deposited $12,000 of his earnings in a bank through his friend Haji Wazir, or that he never used a bank and kept all his money with him.CSIS interview of Harkat, October 4, 1997CSIS Immigration Screening interview of Harkat, June 11, 1998 CSIS contends that Pacha Wazir, to whom they believe Harkat is referring, is an Emirati citizen known to have connections to al-Qaeda.Canadian Press, \"Harkat shows classic signs of 'sleeper' agent: CSIS\", November 5, 2008 The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) alleges that Harkat and \"Mohammad Adnani\" were the same person, and that during this time, he joined the more militant Groupe Islamique Arm\u00e9 wing of FIS. They allege he eventually aligned with Gama`at Islamiyya. CSIS will not provide a source for this claim, arguing that the information came from \"open sources\". In September 1995, Harkat paid $5000 for airfare to travel from Pakistan to Malaysia, from where he hoped to catch a direct flight to Canada.Immigration Screening interview of Harkat, June 11, 1998, Q&A; 71-72 In Kuala Lampur, he purchased a forged Saudi passport in the name of Mohammed M. Mohammed S. Al Qahtani for $1200 from a stranger named Abu Abdallah Pakistani, to carry in addition to his legitimate Algerian passport. Saudi passports did not require entry visas to visit Canada.Service Immigration Screening interview of Harkat, June 11, 1998 ==In Canada== Holding about $1000, Harkat flew from Malaysia to Toronto via the United Kingdom on October 6, 1995. He contacted Taher, a colleague he had met in 1994 in Peshawar then living in Ottawa, Ontario. He arranged to meet him at the Ottawa bus station, since he said he had been told that it was best to start a refugee claim from the city. Taher met him at the bus terminal and took him to the mosque, where he was introduced to Abrihim, a convert to Islam who lived beside the mosque. He allowed Harkat to live with him for a week or two.Duffy, Andrew. \"Harkat: I'm no terrorist, just a victim of chaos\", Ottawa Citizen,October 28, 2004Transcript of proceedings, Federal Court File No. DES-4-02, In the Matter of Mohammed Harkat, testimony of Harkat, October 27, 2004, pp. 156 to 160.

In March, he applied for Permanent Resident status. While attending prayers at the Ottawa Mosque on Northwestern Avenue, he met Mohamed el-Barseigy, who was looking for someone to share his apartment. Accepting el-Barseigy's offer of a drive back to Toronto, Harkat was introduced to Ahmed Khadr, who was also in the van. Harkat has said that Khadr was silent during most of the trip, and his only advice to Harkat was \"tell the truth to immigration authorities.\" (A Federal Court justice commented that this was \"inherently implausible and incredible\".)Federal Court of Canada, \"Reasons for denial of bail to Mohamed Harkat\" They never met again after the 5-hour drive.Duffy, Andrew. \"Ottawa man a terrorist, judge rules\", Ottawa Citizen, March 23, 2005 Harkat was also in contact with Fahad al-Shehri, who was later deported from the country. In 1996, after el-Barseigy moved to a new home, Harkat moved to 391 Nelson Street, Apartment 1. At the end of the year, he enrolled in English courses at the Ottawa Technical High School. On October 4, 1997, he was interviewed by CSIS, and was accused of using the alias \"Abu Muslima\", which he denied.Service interview of Harkat, October 4, 1997 In 2004, he recanted his denial and admitted using the name in Pakistan.Transcript of proceedings - Federal Court File No. DES-4-02 In the matter of Mohammed Harkat heard at Ottawa, Ontario, October 28, 2004, pp. 64-65.

He said that a man named Wael, a mutual friend with Harkat's close friend Abdel Mokhtar, had come to Canada with $60,000 to start a business. Liking Harkat, he offered to loan him $10,000 and then an additional $8,000 to open an antique store and a gas station. Harkat also stated that the money was from Mokhtar, rather than Wael.Transcript of proceedings - Federal Court File No. DES-4-02 In the matter of Mohammed Harkat heard at Ottawa, Ontario, October 27, 2004, pp. 133, 184-189. It later came to light that one of the CSIS agents detailed to collect information on Harkat had been Theresa Sullivan, who had been fired in 2002 after she carried on an extramarital affair with one of her informants. Given this behavior, Harkat questioned in court whether information she provided about him to CSIS was reliable. ==Marriage and family== Harkat married Canadian citizen Sophie Lamarche. ==Arrest== Mohamed Harkat is represented in a 2004 protest outside the Toronto office of CSIS. Harkat was arrested in Ottawa on December 10, 2002 as a threat to national security, after a security certificate was issued on the recommendation of CSIS. Its officers relied upon secret evidence that has not been revealed due to national security concerns.Media for Social Change, \"Measuring Security Measures\", National Film Board Public statements indicated that Abu Zubaydah, who was waterboarded during harsh interrogations by the United States, described a man \"similar to\" Harkat running a guest house in Pakistan that shuttled mujahideen to Chechnya, although he did not use Harkat's name. This led the United States to accuse Harkat of \"assisting terrorists, including the September 11 hijackers\".Library of Congress, Federal Research Division. \"Asian Criminal and Terrorist Activity in Canada\", July 2003 On March 22, 2005, Federal Court judge Eleanor Dawson ruled that the security certificate binding Harkat was reasonable. On December 30 of that year, a federal court judge dismissed Harkat's application for release.CBC, \"Court refuses to order Harkat's release\", December 30, 2005 In April 2006, he was moved, along with the other four detainees, to a section at the Millhaven Institution specifically built for those held under security certificates. ==Release and subsequent trials== On May 23, 2006, Harkat was released on a $100,000 bail by Justice Dawson. The release conditions stipulated that he be in the company of his wife, Sophie Harkat, or mother-in-law, Pierrette Brunette, at all times. Additionally, Harkat was required to wear a tracking bracelet and was prohibited from using electronic means of communication. Any trips outside of his house were to be approved by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) 48 hours in advance. The CBSA were also allowed constant access to his house, were required to approve any visitors to the house, and had two agents accompany him on any outings.CBC, \"The CSIS case against Mohamed Harka\"t, CBC, July 17, 2006 On June 13\u201314, 2006, the Supreme Court of Canada heard the case of Harkat v. Canada on the constitutionality of security certificates. On December 22, Harkat's lawyer, Paul Copeland, announced that Federal Court Chief Justice Allan Lutfy would grant a judicial review of the original deportation order in Federal Court.CBC, \"Harkat Deportation , December 22, 2006 The Canada Border Services Agency added six full-time positions for surveillance agents to follow Harkat at all times, at an annual cost of $868,700, as well as purchasing a new $31,000 car for the tailing, and spent $5,000 monthly to have staff monitoring Harkat's tracking bracelet. On January 29, 2008, CBSA agents entered Harkat's home while he was showering, and placed him under arrest. They cited a breach of bail conditions, since his mother-in- law had not stayed at the house for several days following an argument with her husband.Radio Canada, \"Mohamed Harkat arr\u00eat\u00e9\", Radio Canada, January 30, 2008 He was released after being questioned about the matter. On September 24, 2008, judge Simon No\u00ebl ruled that CSIS must disclose their \"secret\" evidence against Harkat, allowing him and his lawyers to view the material.Toronto Star, \"Terror suspect wins right to see CSIS material\", September 24, 2008 CSIS said this could take up to six months. Six months later, Judge No\u00ebl ordered the release conditions be loosened, allowing Harkat to remain home alone without requiring his wife to be present at all times.Toronto Star, \"Did spy's affair taint case against terror suspect?\", Toronto Star, March 7, 2009 In May 2009, judge No\u00ebl had said that the unwillingness of CSIS to share its material regarding the reliability of an informant who gave evidence against Harkat was \"troubling.\" He ordered them to disclose the confidential files to Harkat's defence lawyers who held security clearance.Toronto Star, \"Judge slams CSIS actions in Harkat terror case\", Toronto Star, May 27, 2009 CSIS claimed to have destroyed all original copies of their evidence, and offered copies to the court and defence lawyers. In May 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that security certificate process used against Harkat was fair and reasonable. While this theoretically cleared the way for his deportation to Algeria, the risk that he could be tortured if returned requires the Canada Border Services Agency to balance these risks prior to removing him from Canada. In March 2016 filmmaker Alexandre Trudeau, the younger brother of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, wrote a letter to Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale asking that Harkat be allowed to stay, causing Erin O'Toole, the Conservative public safety critic and Democracy Watch to demand the Prime Minister recuse himself from any decision regarding Harkat. == Danger Opinion Process == The decision on the reasonableness of Harkat's security certificate became final when it was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2014. That said, his removal process remains outstanding. The CBSA sought a danger opinion from the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to determine whether Mr. Harkat poses a danger to national security or whether the nature and severity of the acts committed reach a serious level of gravity and if so, whether the risk to Mr. Harkat of deporting him outweighs the danger. The danger opinion package with Mr. Harkat\u2019s submissions was provided to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada for decision on March 8, 2017, and a senior officer was assigned to the case on March 31, 2017, for consideration. A decision was then reached in his case on October 2, 2018 in which the Minister\u2019s Delegate determined that Mr. Harkat, a citizen of Algeria, should not be allowed to remain in Canada based on the nature and severity of the acts he committed.Harkat, Mohamed v. M.C.I. and M.P.S.E.P. (F.C., nos. DES-5-08, IMM-5330-18), Roussel, June 3, 2020; 2020 FC 662, , paras. 4 and 32. Harkat's lawyer, Barbara Jackman, told Al Jazeera she filed for a judicial review of his deportation order in November 2018. She indicated to Al Jazeera that as of December 2019 the Federal Court has not received all the information on which the government based its removal decision, and without the complete record, it is unclear when the case will proceed. That counsel stated that she will not act for Mr. Harkat on a legal aid certificate. She applied to court seeking an enhanced hourly fee and the payment of experts\u2019 fees, an application which was denied on the basis that Mr. Harkat had not appealed his denial of legal aid and had provided insufficient information to the court about his finances.Harkat, Mohamed v.
