Project and build the railway were big challenges for the British technicians. The solution adopted to transpose Serra do Mar was to build many tilted surfaces, with a 10% of declive, and use stationary locomotives to transport the trains through cables. S\u00e3o Paulo Railway, organized in London, was made to build the railway that would connect Santos to Jundia\u00ed. The opening of the railway was on 16 February 1867 and significantly improved the transport of agricultural products from the countryside to Santos Docks, specially the coffee produced in S\u00e3o Paulo, improving the local development. The growing of the then-called Vila do Pilar encouraged the Superintendence of S\u00e3o Paulo Railway Company to install a new station of the railway in that location. In 1883, Pilar station was opened, all constructed in wood, which would represent a key to the industrialization process of the future city. In 1926, Pilar station was renamed to Mau\u00e1. ===New station=== In the 1970s, occurred a growing in the demand of passengers in the station, which couldn't handle with that movement. On 26 January 1976, after another failure in the suburban trains, RFFSA decided to build a new station, as the recovery of the old building was impracticable. The new station was opened on 27 March 1979. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1883 Category:Railway stations opened in 1978 ",
