    "text": "A cycloalkene or cycloolefin is a type of alkene hydrocarbon which contains a closed ring of carbon atoms, but has no aromatic character. Some cycloalkenes, such as cyclobutene and cyclopentene, can be used as monomers to produce polymer chains. Due to geometrical considerations, smaller cycloalkenes are almost always the cis isomers, and the term cis tends to be omitted from the names. In larger rings (from around 8 atoms), cis\u2013trans isomerism of the double bond may occur. ==Examples== Image:Cyclopropene 2D skeletal.svg|Cyclopropene Image:Cyclobutene.svg|Cyclobutene Image:Cyclopentene.svg|Cyclopentene Image:cyclohexene.svg|Cyclohexene Image:Cycloheptene.svg|Cycloheptene Image:1,3-cyclohexadiene.svg|1,3-Cyclohexadiene Image:1,4-cyclohexadieen.png|1,4-Cyclohexadiene Image:1,5-Cyclooctadiene.svg|1,5-Cyclooctadiene ==See also== * Perfluorocycloalkene (PFCA) * Alicyclic compound * Olefin * Cycloalkyne * Cycloalkane ",
