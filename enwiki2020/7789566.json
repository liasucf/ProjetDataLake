    "text": "The Micro Flying Robot (\u00b5FR) is the world\u2019s smallest and lightest robot helicopter prototype, which was developed by Seiko Epson and demonstrated at the International Robot Exhibition in Tokyo in Nov 2003.Micro Flying Robot The purpose of its development was to demonstrate its micro-mechatronics technology and to explore the possible use of micro robots and the development of component technology applications. ==Features and capabilities== The \u00b5FR is levitated by contra-rotating propellers powered by four 7x2x1-mm ultrasonic motors (originally developed for wristwatches) and is balanced in mid-air by means of a stabilizing mechanism that uses a linear actuator. Though the \u00b5FR is radio-controlled, it relies on power from an external battery via a power cable and thus its flying range is limited. The \u00b5FR includes two microprocessors, a bluetooth module, a gyro-sensor, an accelerometer and an image sensor. ==Development of \u00b5FR-II== The \u00b5FR-II is the enhanced version of the \u00b5FR. It was developed in 2004 for full wireless operation paired with independent flight capability. The main challenge was the need to combine lighter weight with greater dynamic lift. Epson made the robot lighter by developing a new gyro-sensorGyro-Sensor News Release that is one-fifth the weight of its predecessor. Dynamic lift was boosted 30% by the introduction of more powerful ultra-thin ultrasonic motors and newly designed, optimally shaped main rotors.FR-II The \u00b5FR-II includes two 32-bit RISC microcontrollers, an on-board lithium polymer battery, as well as an image sensor that can capture and transmit images via Bluetooth wireless connection. At the moment it has a flight time of just 3 minutes. == Specifications == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! ! \u00b5FR ! \u00b5FR-II |- | Power | 3.5 V | 4.2 V |- | Power Consumption | 3 W | 3.5 W |- | Diameter | 130 mm | 136 mm |- | Height | 70 mm | 85 mm |- | Weight | 8.9 g | 12.3 g |- | Levitation Power | 13 g/f | 17 g/f |} ==Possible Applications. == \u00b7 Security and Surveillance \u00b7 Disaster Rescue \u00b7 Space Exploration Applications Space Apps ==References== == External links == * \u00b5FR Epson News Release in Nov 2003 * \u00b5FR-II Epson News Release in Aug 2004 * Micro Flying Robotics in Space Missions NASA Article * BBC News article on the \u00b5FR-II Category:Miniature helicopters Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of Japan Category:Robotics at Seiko Epson Category:2003 robots Category:Aerobots ",
