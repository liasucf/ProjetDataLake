She stated that: \"the interval between the two EPs will be a little more than two or three months because I believe that today we devour more than we consume and, for this reason, I like the idea of doing everything little by little. At the end of November the first part will come out\". In November 2018, the first part of this two-part studio album, Tr\u00e1iler (2018), was released. It went straight to number one on the charts. In March 2019, the singer announced that she would be embarking on an intimate promotional concert tour the month after. At the tour's first stop, in Barcelona, the singer revealed that she had changed her mind a little bit. Now, she wasn't scheduled to release another 6-track EP but a full album.
