    "text": "Seaford House, Belgrave Square Seaford House, originally called Sefton House, at 37 Belgrave Square is an aristocratic mansion in London, England. It is the largest of the three detached houses which occupy three corners of Belgrave Square in the district of Belgravia. Seaford House is a magnolia stucco building with four main stories. Dating from 1842, it was designed by Philip Hardwick for the Earl of Sefton. The house and its railings and gate piers have been listed Grade II* for their architectural merit. In 1902, Sefton House was remodeled for Lord Howard de Walden, who was also Baron Seaford. It was at this time that it became known as Seaford House. Lord Howard de Walden had a marble staircase, friezes and paneling installed. It is now the home of the Royal College of Defence Studies, and it is usually open to the public free of charge on Open House Weekend each September. The main vestibule of Seaford House was used as Titanic's Grand Staircase in the 1979 miniseries SOS Titanic. Seaford House later stood in as the exterior of the home of Maggie Gyllenhaal's character Nessa Stein in the BBC and SundanceTV television miniseries The Honourable Woman in 2014. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== *History of Seaford House from the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom *Flickr images tagged Seaford House Category:Belgravia Category:Headquarters in the United Kingdom Category:Houses completed in 1842 Category:Houses in the City of Westminster Category:Grade II* listed buildings in the City of Westminster Category:Grade II* listed houses in London ",
