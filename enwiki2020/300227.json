    "text": "Golden Gate University (GGU or Golden Gate) is a private, university in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1901, GGU specializes in educating professionals through its schools of law, business, taxation, and accounting. The university offers six undergraduate degrees with eleven concentrations and 15 graduate degrees with 24 concentrations. ==History== GGU Campus The university evolved out of the literary reading groups of the San Francisco Central YMCA at a time when, according to one contemporary estimate, only one of every two thousand men had a college education. GGU shares its YMCA roots with a number of other U.S. universities, including Capital University Law School, Michigan State University College of Law, Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts), Northern Kentucky University Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Roosevelt University, South Texas College of Law, University of Toledo College of Law, Western New England University, and Youngstown State University. On November 1, 1881 at the YMCA building at 232 Sutter Street, which the organization had occupied since 1868, the YMCA Night School was established. Classes were offered in bookkeeping, mathematics, stenography, elocution, Spanish and gymnastics. Successful completion of these courses led to a certificate that was recognized by more than 100 colleges and trade schools. Other offerings of the association would include a common school for boys. In April 1894 the YMCA moved to a new five-story building at the northeast corner of Mason and Ellis Streets. West Wing of GGU's SF Campus The night school was renamed the Evening College on October 1, 1896, and became a full-fledged operation in 1901 with the creation of a law school. The law school was the first of the Y's educational departments to offer a full degree-level course, and thus the university traces its founding to the law school's establishment. Courses in Accountancy and Business Administration leading to the degree of Bachelor of Commercial Science began in 1908. Later, courses in foreign trade were added. The YMCA building was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 earthquake. Following the earthquake, the school was conducted out of tents, and later leased space at 1220 Geary St. (now Geary Boulevard near Franklin Street in the Western Addition). In November 1910 the school moved into the YMCA's new building (closed in 2009) at 220 Golden Gate Avenue at Leavenworth Street, in the Tenderloin neighborhood. A student contest in 1927 resulted in the adoption of the new name Golden Gate, originally suggested by law student Charles H. Pool, Jr. (1895\u20131977) (LLB 1925) because contest judges thought it symbolized \"romantic California.\" The institution was separately incorporated from the Central YMCA on May 18, 1923, as Golden Gate College with the power to confer degrees as California law then provided. The college became fully independent of the YMCA in 1962; however, the \"Y\" contributed members to the school's Board of Trustees for some time thereafter. The college continued to share the YMCA's building until June 1968, when it moved into the Allyne Building, a warehouse at 536 Mission Street originally built in 1924 as the showroom and wholesale department of Sherman Clay, a large retailer of pianos, records, record players, and other musical instruments. The college had purchased the building at auction in April 1964, and the Law School had occupied the first two floors since December 1964. In 1972, the college expanded and elevated itself to university status. In 1979, a new \"west wing\" of the university was completed, where most of the classroom space is located today. ==Schools== Golden Gate University is primarily a post-graduate institution focused on professional training in law and business, with its smaller undergraduate programs linked to its larger graduate and professional schools. Its five schools, with the year a university degree was first offered in the academic discipline, are as follows: *School of Law (1901) *Edward S. Ageno School of Business (1908) *School of Accounting (1908) *Bruce F. Braden School of Taxation (1970) *School of Undergraduate Studies (2019) Founded in 1901, Golden Gate University School of Law was the first Northern California law school with an evening program and is one of the oldest law schools in the Western United States. The School of Law offers the JD, LLM and JSD (Doctor of Juridical Science) degrees, while the Ageno School of Business offers the degrees of BA, BS, MS, MBA, PMBA, and DBA (Doctor of Business Administration). The Braden School of Taxation offers an MS in Taxation and the School of Accounting offers the MAc (Master of Accountancy). ==Administration== At its incorporation as a separate institution from the YMCA in 1923, the college governance was divided between a four-member (increased to nine members in 1948) Board of Governors, which ran educational programs of the college including the conferral of degrees, and a five-member Board of Trustees to hold the college property. The Board of Governors met monthly, while the Board of Trustees only met occasionally when its approval was required on a matter. Day-to-day operations of the college were handled by a Director of Education. The appointments of the Director, Governors and trustees were made by the San Francisco YMCA, though appointments to the latter two bodies were made on the Director of Education's recommendation. A 1948 reorganization raised the Director of Education to President, the incumbent Director, Nagel T. Miner (since 1931), becoming President. In September 1949 the Board of Governors and Board of Trustees were merged, with all current trustees retiring, and the members of the Board of Governors being elected onto the Board of Trustees, which had 14 members out of a possible maximum of 21 members. Presently, the university is managed by a self-sustaining Board of Trustees of between 20 and 47 members. Trustees serve 3-year terms with one-third up for election annually. The president of the university and the president of the Alumni Association hold voting seats on the Board. Additionally there are four non- voting ex officio members, the President of the Student Government, the President of the Student Bar Association (law school student government); the President of the University Faculty Senate, and the Chair of the Law Faculty. The trustees are selected from the worlds of business, law, accounting, taxation and philanthropy. Since 2003 the majority of trustees have been alumni of the university. Of the current trustees all but two have at least one academic degree (excluding honorary degrees) from GGU. Prominent former trustees have included Curtis D. Wilbur, U.S. Secretary of the Navy under Calvin Coolidge. John L. McNabb, a former United States Attorney for the Northern District of California; Warren H. Pillsbury, an expert in the federal law of workers compensation (Governor 1923-1949, Trustee 1949-1963); James E. Hammond, a partner with what is now PricewaterhouseCoopers (Governor 1923-1949, Trustee 1949-1968); George Christopher, a former Mayor of San Francisco; and Caspar Weinberger, an executive with Bechtel and a U.S. Secretary of Defense. Day-to-day operation of the university is in the hands of a president, five vice-presidents and the deans of the four schools (Accounting, Business, Law and Taxation). ===Presidents=== Prior to 1948, the top executive was called the Director of Education. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
