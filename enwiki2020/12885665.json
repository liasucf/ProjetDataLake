According to a legend surrounding Heady Lane Cemetery there are spirits along the Hollow at 126th Street in Fishers at Allisonville Road. Conner Prairie keeps the legend alive every Halloween by telling of how a ghost of a tormented grave-robber traded in cadavers, until one night he dug up his own son's body, haunts the woods that line the roadway. Another version on the Heady Hollow Legend describes a fire that burned down a schoolhouse and killed several children run by the Heady family in the late 19th century. The legend goes that the ghosts of children come out on foggy nights not far from Heady Lane Cemetery at Heady Hollow, in Fishers where Allisonville Road intersects at 126th Street a very dark and wooded area prone to fog. An article explaining the legend of Heady Hallow by Georgianne Neal appeared in the Noblesville Ledger, June 4, 1979. According to the Hamilton County Historical Society records, there was no known school at the location of Heady Hollow. In contrast, an 1866 map of Delaware Township located on the Hamilton County Surveyors page clearly shows a school (School No. 2) located on the northeast corner of 126th & Allisonville Rd. This is likely the school attributed to the legend. No further information about the fire has been found thus far. == See also == * Conner Prairie == References == * Kobrowski, Nicole Encyclopedia of Haunted Indiana 2008. == External links == *Heady Hollow proofparanormal article *Heady Hollow on Ghosthounds *Hamilton County Historical Society *1866 Surveyors Map of Delaware Township Showing The School Category:Cemeteries in Indiana Category:Protected areas of Hamilton County, Indiana Category:19th-century establishments in Indiana ",
