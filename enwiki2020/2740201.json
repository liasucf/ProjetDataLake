    "text": "Qulliq Energy Corporation (QEC) is a Canadian Crown corporation owned by the Government of Nunavut. It draws its name from the qulliq (kudlik), an Inuit oil lamp. The company uses name Nunavut Power as a trading name for power generation. It is headquartered in Baker Lake, Nunavut. ==History== Qulliq Energy was established by the Nunavut Power Utilities Act (now the Qulliq Energy Corporation Act) in 2001, two years after the 1999 creation of Canada's Nunavut Territory, to take over the assets within Nunavut of the Northwest Territories Power Corporation. Its original name was Nunavut Power Corporation and it was renamed Qulliq Energy Corporation in 2002 and the mandate of the corporation expanded to include energy conservation and alternative generation development. The power generation trading name Nunavut Power was adopted in 2003. Qulliq Energy established Nunavut Energy Centre in 2006 as a division focusing on energy conservation through public outreach. The centre was closed down on March 31, 2009, and its functions were transferred to the territorial government departments. ==Operations== Low population, severe weather and remoteness of transportation and construction technology make long distance high voltage grids unviable. Every community in Nunavut relies on independent diesel generators, fueled by the annual sealift re-supply during the summer shipping season. This dependence on diesel presents its own set of environmental and economic impacts, leaving the territory vulnerable to world energy price fluctuations. The first new power generation facility since establishment of the company will be expansion of the Iqaluit power plant. The geography of Nunavut presents unique challenges to hydro-electric facilities, but the company is actively engaged in site reviews for hydro-electric developments in the 12-20 MW range around Iqaluit, the territorial capital. The hydro-electric plants are planned in Jaynes Inlet and Armshow South on the south shore of Frobisher Bay. During the 1970s, there had been suggestions of NCPC employing \"slowpoke\" nuclear generators to produce power in the many isolated communities. Since the establishment, periodic discussions continue regarding the possibility of combining Nunavut's fuel delivery functions under Qulliq Energy. ===Iqaluit Hydroelectric Project=== In 2005, Quilliq Energy initiated a study of potential sites near Iqaluit for the development of a hydroelectric power station. Two sites, Jaynes Inlet and Armshow South, were selected as the most cost effective and viable solutions after comprehensive research. The Jaynes Inlet site () would be the site of a 12.5 MW hydroelectric dam that is expected to meet Iqaluit's current energy demand. The Armshow South site () would be the site of a 7.3 MW hydroelectric dam that would be developed when additional capacity is needed. However, Quilliq Energy does not have an adequate revenue surplus or borrowing ability in order to fund the project on its own, especially as 13 of the 25 diesel-fired power stations across the territory are in need of replacement. As a result, the hydroelectric project was shelved in 2014. ==Controversies== In 2010 and 2011, five lawsuits were filed against Qulliq Energy by former employees for wrongful/constructive dismissal, while some other former workers accused the company for the violation of Inuit rights in the workplace. ==See also== * List of Canadian electric utilities * List of power stations in Nunavut ==References== ==External links== * Qulliq Energy Corporation ** Ikuma I, 2001 Report ** Ikuma 2, 2002 Report Category:Electric power companies of Canada Category:Crown corporations of Nunavut Category:Energy companies established in 2001 Category:Kivalliq Region Category:2001 establishments in Nunavut ",
