    "text": "Motnik, a village in the Tuhinj Valley The Tuhinj Valley (; ) is a valley in Slovenia linking the Celje Basin with the Ljubljana Basin in an east-west direction along the courses of the Nevljica and Motni\u0161nica rivers. ==Geography== The western part of the valley was formed by the watershed of the Nevljica, flowing into the Kamnik Bistrica, and the narrower, eastern part by the Motni\u0161nica, a tributary of the Savinja River. Their drainage divide is at the Kozjak Pass at an elevation of 655 m between Cirku\u0161e v Tuhinju and \u0160pitali\u010d. The largest settlements in the valley include Laze v Tuhinju, \u0160martno v Tuhinju, and Motnik. The large number of old settlements points to the fact that the valley was an important thoroughfare in the Middle Ages and later as a passage between Lower Styria and Upper Carniola. ==Name== The Tuhinj region was mentioned in written sources circa 1400 as Tuchein, Tuchen, and Tucheiner alben. The name was originally *Tuxyn\u2032\u044c, derived from the hypocorism *Tuxyn\u044a (based on the Slavic personal name *Tux\u044a or *Tuxa). This root is also the source of similar names such as Tuhinje in Herzegovina, Tuin in Macedonia, Tukhin in Russia, and Tuchy\u0148a in Slovakia. ==Industry== Until the mid-20th century brown coal was mined in the valley near Motnik. Tourism has only recently started to develop with the building of the Snovik Spa.Slovenian Tourist Board site == References == == External links == * Category:Valleys in Upper Carniola Category:Kamnik Bistrica basin Category:Savinja basin ",
