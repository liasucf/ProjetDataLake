The television edit of the song was published on digital platforms on July 23, 2018, while the full single version was released on October 3, 2018. The single reached the top of the iTunes rock charts in Japan, Finland, Greece, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Brazil and Hong Kong, making it the best performing anime song in the history of the iTunes rock chart. It also reached No. 6 in the US chart and No. 8 in the UK chart. The song reached the top ten in the iTunes mainstream charts in 16 countries. The song debuted at No. 4 in the Oricon Singles Chart and No. 3 in the Oricon Digital Singles Chart. ==Background and release== On July 8, 2018, it was revealed at Anime Expo in Los Angeles that X Japan had teamed up with Hyde from L'Arc-en-Ciel to create the theme song of the third season of the Attack on Titan anime. \"Red Swan\" was originally announced as an X Japan song, that would only feature Yoshiki and Sugizo, with Hyde on vocals. However, later that month the song was announced to now be credited to \"Yoshiki feat. Hyde\". \"Red Swan\" was inspired by a section of X Japan's 1994 number-one single \"Rusty Nail\". Its standard edition cover art was designed with elements from the cover art of \"Rusty Nail\", namely the blood dripping from a woman's mouth. On September 15, Yoshiki revealed that \"Red Swan\" was actually completed just days earlier in Los Angeles. Two days later, Yoshiki and Hyde performed the song live on Music Station. The television edit of the song was published on digital platforms on July 23, 2018, while the full song was released digitally and on CD, in two different versions, on October 3, 2018. ==Tracklist== ==Personnel== * Yoshiki \u2013 drums, piano, guitar, bass, synthesizers, production, orchestration * Hyde \u2013 vocals Special guest appearances * Sugizo \u2013 guitar * Pata \u2013 guitar * Heath \u2013 bass Production * Mark Needham \u2013 mixing * Stephen Marcussen \u2013 mastering * Shelly Berg \u2013 orchestration * Daniel Sternbaum \u2013 recording engineer * Ryan Boesch \u2013 recording engineer * Yuji Sugiyama \u2013 recording engineer * Toshi Minesaki \u2013 recording engineer * Hisayuki Watanabe \u2013 recording engineer * Steve Churchyard \u2013 orchestra recording * Brian Fedirko \u2013 programming ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan Weekly Singles (Oricon) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|4 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan Hot 100 (Billboard) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|5 |} ==Sales== |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (RIAJ) | | 27,954 |- ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:2018 singles Category:Japanese rock songs Category:Anime songs Category:Attack on Titan Category:Pony Canyon singles Category:Songs written by Yoshiki (musician) Category:2018 songs ",
