His maternal grandfather was the 16th Duke of Infantado. Moren\u00e9s inherited the Countship of Villada the day he was born. He succeeded in his parents' titles when these died in 1950; his father Luis as Marquess of Bassecourt and his mother Mar\u00eda de las Mercedes as Marquess of Arg\u00fceso and a personal Grandeeship of Spain.Nobleza Espa\u00f1ola. Grandezas Inmemoriales 2\u00aa edici\u00f3n, p. 296 ==Hunting== Up until the Spanish Civil War, he had been professionally dedicated to pigeon-shooting, where he won more than 300 competitions. In the 1940s, he became president of the Madrid Pigeon- Shooting Club. Along with fellow American pigeon-shooter Homer Clark Jr., he designed a unique gun. Being the latter keen on guns with short barrels, and using one of his damaged ones, they both created a prototype with the help of Victor Sarasqueta, Purveyor of Spain's Royal House. It proved successful; Villada's daughter Mar\u00eda Antonia was proclaimed world champion of pigeon- shooting in Rome in 1956.Priego (2017). p. 189 Moren\u00e9s became a regular guest at some of the most famed fincas of Spain.

In 1955, he hosted a hunt for the Sha of Persia.Priego (2017). p. 189 The Count of Villada was one of the many \"golden age Spanish hunters\" that became a board member of the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation and was also a member of the Amateur Trapshooting Association.
