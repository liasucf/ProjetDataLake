    "text": "Rema-Rema was a short-lived English music group, consisting of Gary Asquith (guitar/vocals), Marco Pirroni (guitar), Mick Allen (bass/vocals), Mark Cox (keyboards) and Dorothy Max Prior (drums, generally known only as \"Max\"). ==History== Asquith and Allen went to the same school. After his departure from punk band The Models, Allen asked Asquith to join in a new project, called Rema-Rema. However, the band dissolved when Marco Pirroni joined Adam and the Ants. Pirroni had been an original member of Siouxsie and the Banshees, and was a short-time integrant of Cowboys International, but shortly afterwards went on to fame as a member of Adam and the Ants. Asquith, Allen, and Cox went on to form another short-lived band Mass, which then split up to form Renegade Soundwave (Asquith) and The Wolfgang Press (Allen and Cox). Max later joined Psychic TV, and also recorded a single \"I Confess\" under the name Dorothy, cowritten with Alex Fergusson, released on Industrial Records in 1980. Their sole four-track EP, Wheel In The Roses (released 1980 on 4AD), featured one side of studio recordings and another of live material. Their songs \"Fond Affections\" and \"Rema-Rema\" were later covered by This Mortal Coil and Big Black respectively. Two live tracks from the Acklam Hall gig of April 1979, \"Why Ask Why?\" and \"Christopher\" appeared on the tape only release, The Men With the Deadly Dreams, on White Stains in 1981. ==Discography== ;Releases * Wheel in the Roses EP (1980) * Fond Reflections 2x CD (2019) ;Compilation appearances * Natures Mortes - Still Lives (1981) ==References== == External links == *4AD Rema-Rema Profile *Eyesore database: Rema-Rema *The Story of \"I Confess\" Category:4AD artists Category:English post-punk music groups Category:English rock music groups ",
