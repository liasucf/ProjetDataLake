    "text": "Shooting at Unarmed Men was the music project of former Mclusky member Jon Chapple (vocals/guitar), Steve Morgan (drums), and Big Joan member Simon Jarvis (bass). The original bassist for the band's formal incarnation was King Alexander member Simon Alexander (bass/vocals), although the band had existed as a sporadic joke since circa 1999. Alexander also co-wrote the Mclusky song \"Chases\", from the Mclusky Do Dallas album. ==History== They released their first mini-album, Soon There Will Be..., on Too Pure Records, on 17 October 2005.http://www.discogs.com/Shooting-At-Unarmed-Men-Soon-There-Will- Be/release/1205204 The second, \"Yes! Tinnitus!\" was released on 22 May 2006http://www.discogs.com/Shooting-At-Unarmed-Men-Yes-Tinnitus/release/836890 \u2013 however, Chapple has since moved to Melbourne for two years (the band played their last gig in the Northern Hemisphere on 16 April 2006 at Cardiff's Clwb Ifor Bach, where Chapple also sold most of his books, videos and some of his records).
