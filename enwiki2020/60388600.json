(The first team with the first pick went last in round two, giving the team who went last in round one to go first in round two). A one-minute countdown clock was started for picks. *Eligible players must currently be in their senior season. *No current picks could be traded for picks in a future draft. *No trading of players already on rosters for draft picks. {| class=\"wikitable\" text-align:center; |- !

After halftime, the Whipsnakes continued their goal streak with a 4\u20130 run. However, being down by 7 goals, the Redwoods mounted an amazing comeback when they scored 6 goals (including a 2-point shot), pulling within 2 points if the Whipsnakes (10\u20138) in the third quarter. The fourth quarter saw the Redwoods tie it up with 5:49 left to play. Then the Redwoods scored one more to pull ahead.
