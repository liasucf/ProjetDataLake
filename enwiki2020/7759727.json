Foreign banks which do not wish to obtain a banking authority may operate a representative office for liaison purposes, but the activities of that office are restricted. There are a number of foreign subsidiary banks; however, only a few have a retail banking presence \u2014 HSBC Bank Australia, Delphi Bank, Bank of Sydney and Citibank Australia have a small number of branches. Foreign banks have a more significant presence in the Australian merchant banking sector. {|class=\"wikitable\" !Bank ||Headquarters |- | Arab Bank Australia || Sydney |- | Bank of China (Australia) || Sydney |- | Bank of Sydney, subsidiary of Bank of Beirut || Sydney |- | Citibank Australia || Sydney |- | HSBC Bank Australia || Sydney |- | HDFC Bank Australia || Sydney |- | ING Bank (Australia) a subsidiary of ING Group, Netherlands || Sydney |- | Rabobank Australia (a subsidiary of Rabobank Nederland from October 1994) || Sydney |} ==Branches of foreign banks== * ABN AMRO Bank N.V. * Bank of America, National Association * Bank of Baroda * Bank of China Limited * Bank of Communications Co., Ltd. * Barclays Capital (the trading name of Barclays Bank plc) * BNP Paribas * China Construction Bank Corporation * China Everbright Bank Co.
