    "text": "Richard Siward (died 1248) was a 13th-century soldier who fought as a mercenary. In 1217 he fought on the side of Henry III of England in the Battle of Sandwich. He was a member of Henry's Royal Council. == Rebellion == In 1220 he supported William de Forz's rebellion against King Henry III. An account of his activities during this period cited how he led campaigns against the lands of the king's counselors. Aside from the detailed descriptions of the destruction and booty taken, it was also written that his soldiers \"observed one good rule amongst them generally: they did not do any injury or attack any one, except these unjust advisers of the king.\" The rebellion failed in 1221 though Siward was pardoned later that year. Two years later, Siward was again embroiled in another rebellion. His role was established from the very beginning after he and his band of soldiers attacked and looted the bishop of Winchester's manors and followed this action with raids on Devizes and the freeing of Hubert de Burgh, the justiciar. Events, thereafter, following a truce indicated that the rebels won as Siward and other participants such as Gilbert Marshall were reconciled to the king. In 1234 Siward was given control of Bolsover Castle by the English king. He participated in the 6th Crusade as documented in the Chronica Majora by Matthew Paris.Early Blazon, http://www.earlyblazon.com/ ==Personal life== Little is known about Siward's family pedigree. One of the theories, however, suggest that he was descended from Syward, the Saxon Earl of Northumberland. He was described as undistinguished landholder of limited means. One of the earliest records citing his name involved an arraignment for murder in 1215 before entering William Marshal II's household through service to the latter's kinsman the Poitevin earl of Aumale. In 1229 he married Philippa Basset (died 1265),Coss, Peter. \"Basset, Philippa, countess of Warwick\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 23 September 2004. Accessed 13 January 2019. thus becoming Lord of the Manor of Headington. The Bassets were related to Gilbert Basset and to the west country families such as Vautort and Malet. They later divorced in 1242.http://www.headington.org.uk/history/famous_people/lordsofmanor1.htm ==References== Category:1248 deaths Category:13th-century English people Category:13th-century soldiers ",
