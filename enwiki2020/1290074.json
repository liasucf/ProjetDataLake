Amicus Bank briefly provided services under its own name through Bell Sympatico's portal. It also took on the operation of non-branch automated banking machines (primarily stand-alone ABMs at services stations, convenience stores) which were co-branded for Amicus Bank and CIBC. The bank asked for and received approval from the Minister of Finance for voluntary dissolution in 2002. Services operated by Amicus Bank are now provided by the direct banking division of CIBC. President's Choice Financial is now a unit of CIBC Retail Markets. Amicus Bank had 1100 employees in Canada and the US. XtraCash ATM Incorporated (founded 1998) was acquired under Amicus FSB in 2001. ==US operations== Amicus had an American unit, Amicus FSB (Amicus Federal Savings Bank), which was formed in 2000 and has since ceased operations due to cancellation of joint ventures south of the border.
