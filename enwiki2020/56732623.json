Burgabo lies at the mouth of the Burgabo River and is connected via a dirt road to Kamboni, the southernmost town in Somalia, away at the Kenyan border. The connections with the sparsely populated inland and towards the north consist of barely accessible paths. The district capital Badhaadhe lies to the northwest. Offshore are reefs and the Bajuni Islands, which extend northeastward to Kismayo. On the northern edge of the town, there are extensive charcoal storage sites; charcoal is produced in the hinterland and exported from Burgabo to the Arabian Peninsula via dhow. This export is banned by the United Nations Security Council because the Islamic terror group Al-Shabaab is financed by the proceeds.\"Report of the Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea pursuant to Security Council resolution 2182 (2014): Somalia.\", Document S/2015/801, 10 October 2015. p. 42. (Photos of storage locations on pages 310\u2013313.) Burgabo has a tropical savanna climate with an average annual temperature of 27.2 \u00b0C. The hottest month is April with an average of 28.8 \u00b0C; the coolest month is July, averaging 25.6 \u00b0C. The annual precipitation amounts to approximately . The dry season is from January to March, followed by a rainy season from April to July. After that, rainfall regularly falls with a small peak in October. The wettest month is May when there is then about , more than a quarter of the annual total. The annual fluctuations can also be considerable.Climate data at Climate-Data.org. ==History== ===Greco-Roman=== The area is believed to correspond with the ancient emporium of Nikon, which is described in the 1st century CE Greco-Roman travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The archaeogical site (known by the early 20th century name Port Dunford) contains a number of ancient ruins, including several pillar tombs. Prior to its collapse, one these structures' pillars stood 11 meters high from the ground, making it the tallest tower of its kind in the wider region. Additionally, the area features a square edifice covered with a low, dome-shaped vault. It is one of the main local standing structures. In 1913, Haywood reportedly found at Port Dunford a large collection of old coins, along with a vessel similar to a Greek amphora. He later disposed of the amphora pieces, and the vessel was also said to have been crushed during a storm. In 1930, Hayward showed the coins to an official with the British Museum, H. Mattingly. 87 pieces in total, they ranged in date from the 3rd century BCE to the early 4th century CE. Among the coins were 17 copper mints from the Ptolemy III to Ptolemy V dynasties of Ptolemaic Egypt, five pieces of uncertain origin dating from the 1st to 3rd centuries BCE, six pieces that had been minted under Imperial Rome between the reigns of Nero and Antoninus Pius, forty-six coins ranging from Roman Emperors Maximinus II to Constans, six mints derived from the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate, and seven pieces from Ottoman Egypt. ===Early trading=== Based on the archaeological finds, Mortimer Wheeler suggested that Port Dunford was likely a trading station from at least the Roman period. In 1955, he and Dr. A.G. Mathew in turn visited the area. They discovered porcelain, pottery and building remains dating from the 16th century onwards. ===19th century=== Following an agreement between the German East Africa Company and Sultan Ali ibn Ismail of Kismayo at the end of 1886, a German trading station called Hohenzollernhafen\"Port Durnford.\" Meyers Konversations-Lexikon 1905. was establishedJutta B\u00fcckendorf. \"Schwarz-weiss- rot \u00fcber Ostafrika!\": deutsche Kolonialpl\u00e4ne und afrikanische Realit\u00e4t. M\u00fcnster: LIT Verlag, 1997. p. 231. at Wubushi (Burgabo) Bay. At that time, the entire southern part of the Somali coast was nominally in the hands of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, but the Germans circumvented that problem by concluding a protection treaty with Ali ibn Ismail, who was hostile to Zanzibar. After the Heligoland\u2013Zanzibar Treaty of 1890, the area came under British suzerainty and the port was renamed Port DurnfordEncyclopaedia Britannica Tenth Edition. Volume 34: Maps. Plate 56. (also Port Dunford or WubushiEncyclopaedia Britannica Tenth Edition. Volume 34: Maps. p. 490.). ===20th century=== In 1905, the area was described as follows: Port Durnford formed part of the East Africa Protectorate (first part of Tanaland province and later Jubaland) until, along with the rest of Jubaland, was ceded to the Italians in 1924 when it became known as Bur Gavo. First part of Trans-Juba, it became part of Italian Somaliland in 1926 and, with independence in 1960, part of Somalia. ===21st century=== At the beginning of the 21st century, the town numbered just under 4,000 residents, similar to the population at the start of the 20th century (about 3,500 residents). In the Somali Civil War, the city was a haven for various Islamist groups, and the population fell to around 300 in 2011. Expeditionary Kenya Defence Forces and Somali Armed Forces of the Federal Government of Somalia, supported by French naval artillery and U.S. air strikes, occupied the area of Burgabo at the end of October 2011 in the campaign against Al-Shabaab terrorists.\"Kenyans head for showdown in Somalia.\" UPI. 27 October 2011.
