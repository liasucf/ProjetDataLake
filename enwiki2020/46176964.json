    "text": "Quartet (Santa Cruz) 1993 is a double CD by American composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton recorded live in 1993 and released on the hatART label in 1997.Anthony Braxton discography accessed March 20, 2015 ==Reception== The AllMusic review by Thom Jurek states \"This double CD documents with a finality just what the quartet had achieved in its eight years together. Braxton had realized within this group of musicians a goal he had previously thought unattainable: the ability to interchange any composition from any of his periods with any other -- and within each other -- in a small group setting. And given the far-reaching musical tenets each of these \"sets of compositions\" notated by tracks are, that is no mean feat\".Jurek, T. Allmusic Review accessed March 20, 2015 The JazzTimes review by John Murph enthused \"this exhausting yet fascinating two-disc adventure transports the listener to a cubist realm of terse tonal manipulations, extreme volume dynamics, and controlled collective chaos\".Murph, J., JazzTimes Review, November 1997 ==Track listing== All compositions by Anthony Braxton.
