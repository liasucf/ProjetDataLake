When he was six years old, his family moved to the Llor\u00e9ns Torres public housing project. There he lived for the next 25 years. Warrington left school when he was a teenager and made a living by polishing shoes at a local barbershop. One of the barbershop's regular customers was Tommy Mu\u00f1iz, a television show producer. One day Warrington asked Mu\u00f1iz for a job in television but was told to get some more education and come back to him after he graduated.Puerto Rico Popular Culture ==Bizcocho== Encouraged by Mr. Mu\u00f1iz's challenge, Warrington returned to school and graduated from San Juan's Central High School in 1960; he then went back to Mr. Mu\u00f1iz to take him up on his earlier offer. Tommy Mu\u00f1iz kept his word and let Otilio assist in the TV show \"El Special de Corona\" (The Corona Special). Thus, Warrington became the \"first\" black Puerto Rican male comedian to be regularly featured on a local TV program. One of the show's sections involved a group of \"wacky\" soldiers and included Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot and Jacobo Morales. When Otilio joined the group, Morales baptized him as \"Soldier Bizcocho\" (Cake), a nickname that would remain with him for the rest of his life. Mu\u00f1iz saw potential in Otilio and paid for his college education; as a result Warrington attended the University of Puerto Rico graduating with an associate degree in Television Direction and Production. After graduation Otilio participated in many local TV programs such as: \"Ja ja ji ji jo jo con Agrelot\" and \"El Show del Mediod\u00eda\" (The Noon Show). Warrington joined ASTRA productions in the 1970s and after working for different shows landed a spot in \" Cogiendo Impulso\", which was transmitted on Channel 11; it was here that he developed the characters of \"Juancito\" and \"Pito\".

The plot involved a female cosmetologist who was involved in all kinds of hilarious and off-the-wall situations. \"Cuca G\u00f3mez\" became very popular in Puerto Rico and soon appeared in other TV shows as a special guest star. In 1985, Warrington was named \"Mr. Television\" by the Artistic Association of Puerto Rico.Imdb ==Music== In 1986, Piju\u00e1n, a Puerto Rican musician, in conjunction with Bizcocho created an album called Bizcocho & Piju\u00e1n \"El premio 'Gordo' del Sabor\", under Private Ranch Records. ==Later years== In the 1990s, Warrington starred in his own TV show, Mi Familia (My Family), where he acted as \"Arcadio\".
