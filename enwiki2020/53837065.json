    "text": "Ponce The native Ta\u00edno tribes have played a major role in the history and culture of the island of Puerto Rico. At the head of each tribe was a cacique who, along with the nita\u00ednos, governed each of the yucayeques, or villages of the island. ==History of island inhabitance== It has been suggested that the first tribe to begin settling in the Caribbean was the Banwari, a small group that left Venezuela for Trinidad and Tobago around 5,000 BC. This group was succeeded by the Casimiroid people coming from Central America, the Ortoiroid people from South America, and several other groups before the Ta\u00edno took over several hundred years after. ==Position in societal hierarchy== The Ta\u00edno of Puerto Rico lived in villages known as yucayeques, spread throughout the island. At the bottom of the hierarchy were the common people, who were known as naborias. These naborias were workers who also hunted, prepared food, and built houses in the community, which were called boh\u00edos. According to The Encyclopedia of Caribbean Religions, \"Naborias may have been descendants of \"less pure\" kinship lines, that is, descendants of Guanahatabey or the unnamed indigenous peoples of the third wave, or of kinship lines not as crafty in statesmanship as others.\" Above the naborias were the nobles, known as the nita\u00ednos. They were in charge of keeping the naborias in check as well as leading them into battle. Finally, above the nita\u00ednos were the caciques. Caciques were not only government officials, they acted as religious figures as well. These leaders held control of the yucayeques with often nobody higher to answer to except occasional situations where there were multiple caciques governing a single region, in which they would answer to a supreme cacique. ==Significance in Puerto Rican history== Caciques played a large role in the history of the island, most notably when the Spanish came to take their territory. Upon Spanish arrival in 1508, there were an estimated 20,000-50,000 Ta\u00ednos living on the island. Believing the Spaniards were spiritual entities, the Ta\u00ednos were very hospitable to the Spanish. Knowing this, the Spanish used the Ta\u00ednos for labor and finding gold on the island. After much mistreatment, and the implement of the encomienda system over the land, the caciques and Ta\u00ednos as a group lost their control of the island. As a result of the Spanish abuse and dwindling number of Ta\u00ednos, cacique Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II was appointed to head cacique after the death of his brother. Skeptical about the Spaniards being spiritual figures, Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II and Urayo\u00e1n ordered an ambush of Spaniard Diego Salcedo as he was attempting to cross the R\u00edo Grande de A\u00f1asco. The Ta\u00edno drowned the Spaniard and kept his body for three days, fearing resurrection. After seeing the man was in fact mortal, the Ta\u00ednos declared war on the Spanish, leading to the Spanish\u2013Ta\u00edno War of San Juan\u2013Borik\u00e9n. The Ta\u00edno, led by caciques Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II, Urayo\u00e1n, Coxiguex, Yauco, Jumacao, Loquillo, Orocobix, Guayama, as well as many others, rebelled, however they lacked the weaponry to defeat the Spanish. The Ta\u00edno were defeated and ultimately killed off by European abuse and disease. ==References== * Category:Titles and offices of Native American leaders Category:Titles of nobility in the Americas . * Category:Latin American history Category:Mesoamerican people Category:Spanish colonization of the Americas Category:Tribal chiefs of the Caribbean ",
