    "text": "Walvis Bay, meaning \"Whale Bay\" in English, is a city in Namibia and the name of the bay on which it lies. It is the second largest city in Namibia (in terms of population) and the largest coastal city in the country. The city covers a total area of of land. The bay is a safe haven for sea vessels because of its natural deepwater harbour, protected by the Pelican Point sand spit, being the only natural harbour of any size along the country's coast. Being rich in plankton and marine life, these waters also drew large numbers of southern right whales,Southern Right Whale, Eubalaena australis, The Namibian Dolphin Project attracting whalers and fishing vessels. The Dutch referred to it as Walvisch Baye and the English as Whale Bay. In its eventual formal incorporation, it was named Walfish Bay, which was changed to Walvish Bay, and ultimately to Walvis Bay. It has also been referred to as Walwich BayNarrative of a voyage to the South Seas Charles Medyett Goodridge, Hamilton and Adams, 1832, page 16 or Walwisch Bay.The World of Waters or A Peaceful Progress o'er the Unpathed Sea, Fanny Osborne, R. Carter, 1852, page 337 The Herero people of the area called it Ezorongondo.Windhoek?! Rather make that Otjomuise Werner Menges, The Namibian, 12 May 2005 A succession of colonists developed the location and resources of this strategic harbour settlement. The harbour's value in relation to the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope had caught the attention of world powers since it was discovered by the outside world in 1485. This explains the complicated political status of Walvis Bay down the years. The town is situated just north of the Tropic of Capricorn in the Kuiseb River delta and lies at the end of the TransNamib Railway to Windhoek, and on B2 road. Walvis Bay, with its large bay and sand dunes, is an important centre of tourism activity in Namibia. Attractions include the artificial Bird Island, centre of a guano collection industry, the Dune 7 sand dune, the salt works, the abundant birdlife, and a museum. Kuisebmund Stadium, home to two clubs in the Namibia Premier League, is also located in the city. The beach resort of Langstrand lies just a few kilometres north. The Walvis Bay Export Processing Zone is an important facet of the local economy. ==History== Map showing location of Walvis Bay and reference to South Africa before the handover to Namibia Portuguese navigator Diogo C\u00e3o reached Cape Cross, north of the bay, in 1485.Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415\u20131580, Diffie Bailey University of Minnesota Press, 1977, page 156 There followed Bartolomeu Dias, who anchored his flagship S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o in what is now Walvis Bay on 8 December 1487, on his expedition to discover a sea route to the East via the Cape of Good Hope.Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism, James Stuart Olson, Robert Shadle, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1991, page 170 He named the bay \"O Golfo de Santa Maria da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\".\u00c0s portas da \u00cdndia em 1484, Abel Fontoura Costa, Imprensa da Armada, 1935, page 31 However, the Portuguese did not formally stake a claim to Walvis Bay. Little commercial development occurred on the site until the late 19th century. During the Scramble for Africa, the British occupied Walvis Bay with a small area surrounding the territory. They permitted the South African Union to complete the annexation of the territory in 1884, following initial steps which had been taken in 1878.Britannica, Walvis Bay, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019Succession of States and Namibian territories, Y.

However, South Africa had also sought to annex South West Africa itself, and had presented such a proposal to the League of Nations. Consequently, in 1949, the Act was amended to give representation in the Parliament of South Africa to whites in South West Africa.Official Documents of the 4th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, United Nations, 1949, page 11 In 1977, following increasing international pressure to relinquish its control over South West Africa, South Africa repealed the Act, but transferred control of Walvis Bay back to the Cape Province, thereby making it an exclave.The Green and the dry wood: The Roman Catholic Church (Vicariate of Windhoek) and the Namibian socio-political situation, 1971-1981, Oblates of Mary Immaculate, 1983, page 6 From 1980, it was represented in both the Provincial Council and the House of Assembly as part of the Green Point constituency in Cape Town, before becoming a separate constituency in 1982.Sub-Saharan Africa Report, Issues 2578-2584, Foreign Broadcast Information Service., 1982, page 48 In response, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 432 (1978), which declared that \"the territorial integrity and unity of Namibia must be assured through the reintegration of Walvis Bay within its territory\". In 1990, South West Africa gained independence as Namibia, but Walvis Bay remained under South African sovereignty, with South Africa increasing the number of troops.Namibia Nears Freedom, But S.

Following the signing of a treaty between the two countries, South Africa formally transferred sovereignty of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands to Namibia on 1 March 1994. == Geography == === Climate === Despite its location within the tropics, Walvis Bay features the very rare mild variation of the cold desert climate (BWk) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. It is caused by the rain shadow of the Naukluft Mountains and the cooling effect of the coastal sea temperature by the Benguela Current. Walvis Bay receives only average precipitation per year, making it one of the driest cities on earth. Despite its dry climate, the city is relatively humid. Average relative humidity throughout the year remains above 80%. The warmest month is February with average temperature , while the coolest months are August and September with average temperature . The diurnal temperature range is also low, averaging only . As one of the effects of anthropogenic climate change, there has also been considerable warming at the airport in recent years.

Walvis Bay is an important logistical port for the southern African region, providing port facilities for the import and export of cargo for the rest of Namibia, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Botswana. Since the Walvis Bay Corridor Group (WBCG) was established in 2000, cargo moving through the port has increased from 30,000 containers a year to 370,000 containers in 2016. As of 2017 the port was being upgraded to increase its capacity to move 1 million containers a year by 2019. Bureaucratic and logistical problems at the city's competitor port at Durban, South Africa have diverted traffic to the port at Walvis Bay. Ninety-five percent of all cargo hauled overland through Walvis Bay is carried by truck. The Walvis Bay Corridor Group is gearing up to increase import/export-business opportunities in Namibia. The Namibian National Development Plan expects to complete the expansion programme of the Walvis Bay port by 2019. Because of the harbour's geographical positioning, authorities plan to gain a footprint in providing landlocked Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries with a vital logistical hub. In addition to the importance of the port, development would strengthen trade corridors which consists of current road and rail networks. In an attempt to strengthen and enhance trade relations between other African countries, Namport (the Namibian Port Authority) in April 2019 signed a five-year MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with the Port Authority of Dakar, Senegal.https://neweralive.na/posts/namport-and-port-of-dakar-sign- mou Walvis Bay International Airport provides commercial flight services to the city's residents, as well as to neighbouring towns and villages.
