    "text": "The 2019 Pan American Games medal table is a list of National Olympic Committees (NOCs) ranked by the number of gold medals won by their athletes during the 2019 Pan American Games, held in Lima, Peru from July 26 to August 11, 2019. Approximately 6,650 athletes from 41 NOCs will participate in 419 events in 39 sports. The United States topped the medal count with 120 gold and 293 overall medals, its best result in the 21st century. Brazil pulled off its best performance in history, winning 54 gold and 169 overall medals, and finishing second in the standings. Mexico (37 golds) edged Canada (35), Argentina (33) and Cuba (33) in the battle for the third place. The Canadians, however, won the most total medals among the three, 152. For Cuba, it was their worst result since 1971 in terms of gold medals. ==Medal table== The ranking in this table is based on information provided by Panam Sports and is consistent with convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \"nation\" is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code. In badminton, boxing, judo, karate, racquetball, taekwondo, table tennis, and wrestling two bronze medals will be awarded for each event. Also in bowling, fencing and squash two bronze medals will be awarded in some events. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals will be greater than the total number of gold or silver medals. The following is the medal table maintained by the official website of the games. The British Virgin Islands won its first ever gold medal and its first ever Pan American Games medal after Chantel Malone won the women's long jump athletics event. Aruba also earned its first medal in the history of the Pan American Games, a bronze medal won by sailor Mack van den Eerenbeemt in men's RS:X. Barbados, Bolivia, Grenada and Paraguay won their first ever gold medals at the Pan American Games. ==Changes in medal standings== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%;\" |- !style=\"width:8%\"|Ruling date !!style=\"width:12%\"|Sport/Event !!style=\"width:20%\"|Athlete (NOC) !!style=\"width:2%\"| !!style=\"width:2%\"| !!style=\"width:2%\"| !!style=\"width:4%\"|Total !!style=\"width:50%\"|Comment |- | colspan=8 | List of official changes in medal standings (during the Games) |- | rowspan=4 | 11 August 2019 | rowspan=4 | Bowling Men's doubles | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || \u22121 || || || \u22121 | rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jean P\u00e9rez Faure, a member of the Puerto Rican team that won the gold medal in the men's doubles has tested positive for doping with chlorthalidone, a prohibited diuretic. The Panam Sports Disciplinary Commission announced this positive the day the Lima Games are closed, on 11 August 2019. As a consequence, the Puerto Rican duo loses gold, which passes to the United States. Colombia gets the silver and the bronze goes to the Mexico team. |- | align=left | || +1 || \u22121 || || 0 |- | align=left | || || +1 || \u22121 || 0 |- | align=left | || || || +1 || +1 |- | colspan=8 | List of official changes in medal standings (after the Games) |- | rowspan=4 | 27 September 2019 | rowspan=4 | Judo Women's 57 kg | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || \u22121 || || || \u22121 | rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:left;\"| Rafaela Silva that won the gold medal in the women's 57 kg category, has tested positive for doping with fenoterol after the Games. |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || +1 || \u22121 || || 0 |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || +1 || \u22121 || 0 |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || || +1 || +1 |- | rowspan=25 | 26 December 2019 | rowspan=4 | Rowing Men's quadruple sculls | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || \u22121 || || || \u22121 | rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:left;\"| The team from Uruguay was disqualified for doping. |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || +1 || \u22121 || || 0 |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || +1 || \u22121 || 0 |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || || +1 || +1 |- | rowspan=3 | Karate Men's 84 kg | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || \u22121 || || || \u22121 | rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:left;\"| Carlos Sinisterra from Colombia was disqualified for doping. |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || +1 || \u22121 || || 0 |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || +1 || \u22121 || 0 |- | rowspan=4 | Boxing Women's 75 kg | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || \u22121 || || || \u22121 | rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jessica Caicedo from Colombia was disqualified for doping. |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || +1 || \u22121 || || 0 |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || +1 || \u22121 || 0 |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || || +1 || +1 |- | rowspan=3 | Wrestling Men's Greco-Roman 67 kg | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || \u22121 || || \u22121 | rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:left;\"| Shalom Villegas from Venezuela was disqualified for doping. |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || +1 || \u22121 || 0 |- | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || || +1 || +1 |- | rowspan=3 | Athletics Women's discus throw | style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"| || || \u22121 || || \u22121 | rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:left;\"| Andressa de Morais from Brazil was disqualified for doping.
