They push Smith to playing low-down grooves that truly cook: \"Sagg Shootin' His Arrow\" and \"Root Down (And Get It)\" are among the hottest tracks he ever cut...There are times where the pace slows, but the tension never sags, and the result is one of the finest, most exciting records in Smith's catalog. If you think you know everything about Jimmy Smith, this is the album for you.\" ==Track listing== # \"Sagg Shootin' His Arrow\" (Jimmy Smith) \u2013 7:09 # \"For Everyone Under the Sun\" (Peter Chase) \u2013 5:56 # \"After Hours\" \u2013 7:45 # \"Root Down (And Get It)\" (Smith) \u2013 7:44 # \"Let's Stay Together\" (Al Green) \u2013 6:30 # \"Slow Down Sagg\" (Smith) \u2013 6:43 2000 remastered edition (Verve By Request series) # \"Introduction\" (Hidden Track) - 2:07 # \"Sagg Shootin' His Arrow\" [Unedited version] \u2013 11:45 # \"For Everyone Under the Sun\" \u2013 5:55 # \"After Hours\" \u2013 7:51 # \"Root Down (And Get It)\" [Unedited version] \u2013 12:39 # \"Let's Stay Together\" \u2013 6:27 # \"Slow Down Sagg\" [Unedited version] \u2013 10:22 # \"Root Down (And Get It)\" [Previously unissued alternative version] \u2013 12:13 ==Personnel== *Jimmy Smith - Hammond B3 organ *Paul Humphrey - drums *Wilton Felder - bass guitar *Buck Clarke - congas, percussion *Arthur Adams - guitar *Steve Williams - harmonica ;Reissue personnel *Hollis King - art direction *Sherniece Smith - art producer *Carlos Kase - audio supervisor, producer, research coordination *Ed Green - engineer *Jack Hunt *Mark Smith - producer, research assistant *Tom Greenwood - producer, research coordination *John Wriggle *Eric Miller - producer, supervising editor, supervising engineer *Bryan Koniarz - production coordination *Ben Young - research ==References== ==External links== *Root Down at The Incredible Jimmy Smith site Category:1972 live albums Category:Jimmy Smith (musician) live albums Category:Verve Records live albums ",
