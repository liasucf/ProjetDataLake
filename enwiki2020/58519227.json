The band opts for a new, non-traditional release method with mixed results; teaming with Apple to deliver the album directly to any customer with an active i-Tunes account. The release proves to be divisive; on one hand, it leads to over 26 million downloads and an estimated 81 million people listening to the album within the first month; however, it also leads to concerns on the devaluation of the monetary value of music as a commercial product, and angers some iTunes customers due to its automatic download without the user's consent. A traditional commercial release occurs the following month, with the album debuting at number 9 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling just 28,000 copies, drastically lower than their prior release, No Line on the Horizon, which sold just under half a million copies in its first week of availability.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart- beat/6289335/florida-georgia-line-no-1-album-bob-seger-game-u2 ===October=== *Nickelback's single \"Edge of a Revolution\" tops the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart for two weeks.

As of 2015, the band is the only band to top both simultaneously with a song in the 2010s, with the feat becoming rare due to alternative music's shift to less guitar-driven music. *Foo Fighters release their eighth studio album, Sonic Highways.
