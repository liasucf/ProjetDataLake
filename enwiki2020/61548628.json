A four-story mansion in the grand old Victorian resort style, it was built in 1896 as Kurhaus N\u00fcnalphorn by the tourism pioneer Franz Hess-Michel. In the 1950s, it was renamed the Paxmontana. It was extensively restored between 1999 and 2011. Its restaurant has a distinct long veranda at the front. The hotel is listed as a cultural property of national significance. ==History== The hotel in 2009 prior to renovation of the fa\u00e7ade The hotel, a four-storey mansion in the grand old Victorian resort style, was originally built in 1896 as a modern flat roof construction, but it was given its characteristic towers at the beginning of the 20th century. The Lucerne architects Heinrich Walter Schumacher and Otto Schnyder extended the building in 1905-1906 by two storeys in response to the increasing demand for upscale accommodation by tourists. By 1938, the owner Franz Hess had fallen into financial difficulties and the hotel was taken over by the Obwalden Kantonalbank. In 1953 the Bruder Klausen Foundation acquired the hotel, and three years later it was renamed the \"Paxmontana\". Since 1999, the hotel has been renovated in stages, with renovation of the terrazzo floors, stucco ceilings and ceiling paintings. From the fall of 2009 to December 2011, the hotel was closed for a major refurbishment at a cost of 26 million francs, with the installation of a new elevator, constructional reinforcement with fire and earthquake protection, new seminar rooms in the basement and a new kitchen. Likewise, the fa\u00e7ade was completely renovated and the roof with the tower structures was repainted with the original pattern of the bricks. In 2002 the Swiss National Group of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) awarded Paxmontana special recognition for restoration according to monument preservation criteria and in 2014 it was awarded the Special Award for Historic Hotel of the Year. ==Restaurant and rooms== The hotel's Restaurant Veranda The restaurant is noted for its long veranda at the front, overlooking the Sarneraatal and the Glaubenberg. 4 of the 83 rooms are furnished with the furniture of the original hotel. ==References== ==External links== *Official site *Article with history and historic pictures Category:Hotels in Switzerland Category:Hotels established in 1896 Category:Buildings and structures in Obwalden Category:Sachseln Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Switzerland Category:1896 architecture ",
