As he learned the retail trade he became involved in the confectionery business and by age 19 had a few vans on the road and a small factory producing sweets and fancy goods. At aged 23 he married Elizabeth Lambert from Rathmines and in the 1950s they decided to emigrate to North America, and spent about 6 years living in Los Angeles where he became involved with the motor trade, starting off working for Chevron in a gas station and progressing to owning 3 stations of his own. On returning to Dublin, he entered into a new career path by buying his first licensed premises, Bohans of Meath Street. He would go on to buy and run a number of well known Dublin pubs over the years. During this period he became Chairman of the Licensed Vintners Association who nominated him to run for election on the Industrial and Commercial Panel in the 1987 Seanad elections where he won the first of his 5 election campaigns holding a seat for 20 years.
