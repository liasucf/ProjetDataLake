    "text": "YG Future Strategy Office (), also known as YG FSO (), is a South Korean web television series on Netflix starring Seungri as the head of YG Entertainment's fictional strategic resources department, with Yoo Byung-jae, Baek Young-kwang, Kim Ga-eun, Son Se-bin, and Sechs Kies' Lee Jai-jin starring as his co-workers. Various artists from YG Entertainment also appeared as guests. The show is directed by Park Joon-soo, who produced the South Korean mockumentary show God of Music, and is written by Kim Min-suk, who was one of the writers for SNL Korea. == Synopsis == In order to deal with its troublemaking artists and misfits, YG Entertainment forms a new department called the future strategy office, with Seungri as head of the department. The show follows him and his co-workers struggling to regain the company's reputation in the midst of a crisis. The black comedy series was based loosely on YG Entertainment artists' real-life drug and sex scandals. ==Development and production== The show was first announced on February 22, 2018 through a press release published by Netflix. Producer Park Joon-soo declared to have been inspired by Samsung's former Future Strategy Office, which used to be an important department of the company before it was disbanded. He went on saying that he has \"been producing a series of shows that make fun of the dark sides of Korea's entertainment industry\" and he thought of YG because it was \"going through a dark patch\" at the time. During filming, the crew and cast were given different versions of the script in order \"to make the show as realistic as possible.\" However, Seungri mentioned during a press conference \u2014 which took place in Seoul on October 1, 2018 \u2014 that he seldom read the scripts, wanting \"to show the real [him]\" as much as he could. == Cast == === Main === ====YG FSO team==== * Seungri as the head and consultant of YG FSO * Yoo Byung-jae as a staff member who runs errands for the department * Lee Jai-jin as an employee who rarely goes to work * Son Se-bin is an assistant of the department with calm air * Kim Ga-eun is the financial manager of the department with a direct personality that is always \"challenging\" Seungri * Park Chung-hwan as the assistant manager ====Other regulars==== * Baek Young- kwang as Seungri's manager and the department's bodyguard * Choi Shin-deok as the department's bodyguard * Jinu (Jinusean) === Special appearances === * Yang Hyun-suk * Blackpink * Daesung * Nam Tae-hyun * Kim So-young * Winner * Oh Sang-jin * Jinusean * Park Bom * One * Son Se-eun * Son Se-bin * iKon * Sunmi * Kim Chung-ha * Son Na-eun * Yoo In-na * Lee Hi * Lee Su-hyun ==Episodes== Each episode features a quote by Yang Hyun-suk, YG's chairman, which relates to the episode's story.
