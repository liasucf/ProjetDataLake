    "text": "The 2017 UEFA Europa League Final was the final match of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League, the 46th season of Europe's secondary club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 8th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League. It was played on 24 May 2017 at the Friends Arena in Solna, Stockholm, Sweden, between Dutch side Ajax and English side Manchester United. Manchester United won the match 2\u20130 to secure their first title in this competition. With this victory, they joined Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea as the only clubs to have won all three major European trophies (European Champion Clubs' Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/Europa League, and the now-defunct Cup Winners' Cup). Manchester United earned the right to play against the winners of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid, in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup. They also entered the group stage of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League, as the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. Police of Stockholm took measures against potential terrorist attacks which they described as \"the new normality\", since two had occurred in Stockholm in 2010 and just a month before the final, and also prepared for potential clashes between supporters. ==Teams== In the following table, finals until 2009 were in the UEFA Cup era, since 2010 were in the UEFA Europa League era. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Team !Previous finals appearances (bold indicates winners) |- | Ajax |1 (1992) |- | Manchester United |None |} ==Venue== The Friends Arena in Solna hosted the final Friends Arena, located in the Solna Municipality of the Stockholm urban area, was announced as the final venue on 30 June 2015, following the decision of the UEFA Executive Committee meeting in Prague, Czech Republic. ==Background== This was Ajax's second final in the UEFA Cup/Europa League, having won in the 1992 UEFA Cup Final over Torino on away goals. This was Manchester United's first final in the UEFA Cup/Europa League. They were seeking to join Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea as the only clubs to have won all three major European trophies (European Champion Clubs' Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/Europa League, and the now defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup). The two sides had previously met four times in European competitions, all in the UEFA Cup/Europa League, with a record of two wins each. However, Manchester United had eliminated Ajax on both occasions, 2\u20131 on aggregate in the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup first round, and 3\u20132 on aggregate in the 2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League round of 32. ==Road to the final== Note: In the table, the score of the finalist is given first (H = home; A = away). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=4| Ajax !Round !colspan=4| Manchester United |- style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" |colspan=4|Champions League | |colspan=4|Europa League |- |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Opponent |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Agg. |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|1st leg |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|2nd leg |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Qualifying phase (CL, EL) |colspan=4 rowspan=4|Bye |- |align=left| PAOK |3\u20132 |1\u20131 (H) |2\u20131 (A) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Third qualifying round |- |align=left| Rostov |2\u20135 |1\u20131 (H) |1\u20134 (A) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Play-off round |- style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" |colspan=4|Europa League | |- style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" |Opponent |colspan=3|Result |Group stage |Opponent |colspan=3|Result |- |align=left| Panathinaikos |colspan=3|2\u20131 (A) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Matchday 1 |align=left| Feyenoord |colspan=3|0\u20131 (A) |- |align=left| Standard Li\u00e8ge |colspan=3|1\u20130 (H) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Matchday 2 |align=left| Zorya Luhansk |colspan=3|1\u20130 (H) |- |align=left| Celta Vigo |colspan=3|2\u20132 (A) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Matchday 3 |align=left| Fenerbah\u00e7e |colspan=3|4\u20131 (H) |- |align=left| Celta Vigo |colspan=3|3\u20132 (H) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Matchday 4 |align=left| Fenerbah\u00e7e |colspan=3|1\u20132 (A) |- |align=left| Panathinaikos |colspan=3|2\u20130 (H) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Matchday 5 |align=left| Feyenoord |colspan=3|4\u20130 (H) |- |align=left| Standard Li\u00e8ge |colspan=3|1\u20131 (A) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Matchday 6 |align=left| Zorya Luhansk |colspan=3|2\u20130 (A) |- |colspan=4 valign=top|Group G winners |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Final standings |colspan=4 valign=top|Group A runners-up |- style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" |Opponent |Agg. |1st leg |2nd leg |Knockout phase |Opponent |Agg. |1st leg |2nd leg |- |align=left| Legia Warsaw |1\u20130 |0\u20130 (A) |1\u20130 (H) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Round of 32 |align=left| Saint-\u00c9tienne |4\u20130 |3\u20130 (H) |1\u20130 (A) |- |align=left| Copenhagen |3\u20132 |1\u20132 (A) |2\u20130 (H) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Round of 16 |align=left| Rostov |2\u20131 |1\u20131 (A) |1\u20130 (H) |- |align=left| Schalke 04 |4\u20133 |2\u20130 (H) |2\u20133 (A) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Quarter-finals |align=left| Anderlecht |3\u20132 |1\u20131 (A) |2\u20131 (H) |- |align=left| Lyon |5\u20134 |4\u20131 (H) |1\u20133 (A) |style=\"background:#C1E0FF\"|Semi-finals |align=left| Celta Vigo |2\u20131 |1\u20130 (A) |1\u20131 (H) |} ==Pre-match== ===Ambassador=== The ambassador for the final was former Swedish international player Patrik Andersson, who won the Champions League with Bayern Munich against Valencia in 2001. ===Logo=== UEFA unveiled the brand identity of the final on 26 August 2016 in Monaco during the group stage draw. ===Ticketing=== With a stadium capacity of 48,000 for the final, a total amount of 37,000 tickets were available to fans and the general public, with the two finalist teams receiving 10,000 tickets each and with 17,000 tickets being available for sale to fans worldwide via UEFA.com from 17 to 28 March 2017 in four price categories: \u20ac150, \u20ac100, \u20ac70, and \u20ac45. The remaining tickets were allocated to the local organising committee, UEFA and national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters, and to serve the corporate hospitality programme. ===Opening ceremony=== A minute's silence was observed before the final in memory to victims of the bombing in Manchester which occurred two days before the final; the opening ceremony was thus considerably reduced. ==Match== The players during the first half of the game. ===Officials=== Slovenian referee Damir Skomina was announced as the final referee by UEFA on 12 May 2017. ===Summary=== Paul Pogba opened the scoring for Manchester United in the 18th minute when his low left foot shot from just outside the penalty area took a deflection off Davinson S\u00e1nchez which wrong footed the goalkeeper before looping over him and into the net. Henrikh Mkhitaryan got the second goal three minutes into the second half when with his back to goal he flicked the ball into the net with his right foot from three yards out after the ball had been knocked down to him by Chris Smalling after a corner from the right by Juan Mata. Wayne Rooney, who entered minutes before the final whistle, took the captain's armband and later led the team to lift the trophy in his final game for United; he would return to Everton less than two months later. ===Details=== The \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the semi-final draw, which was held on 21 April 2017 at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. Ajax as the \"home\" team played with their new home kit which would be used the following season. United wore their outgoing away (European third) kit. {| width=92% |- | | |} {| style=\"width:100%\" |- |style=\"vertical-align:top; width:40%\"| {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||24|| Andr\u00e9 Onana |- |RB ||3 || Jo\u00ebl Veltman || |- |CB ||5 || Davinson S\u00e1nchez |- |CB ||36|| Matthijs de Ligt |- |LB ||4 || Ja\u00efro Riedewald || || |- |CM ||10|| Davy Klaassen (c) |- |CM ||20|| Lasse Sch\u00f6ne || || |- |CM ||22|| Hakim Ziyech |- |RF ||9 || Bertrand Traor\u00e9 |- |CF ||25|| Kasper Dolberg || || |- |LF ||11|| Amin Younes || |- |colspan=\"3\"|Substitutes: |- |GK ||33|| Diederik Boer |- |DF ||2 || Kenny Tete |- |DF ||16|| Heiko Westermann |- |MF ||21|| Frenkie de Jong || || |- |MF ||30|| Donny van de Beek || || |- |FW ||45|| Justin Kluivert |- |FW ||77|| David Neres || || |- |colspan=\"3\"|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Peter Bosz |} |style=\"vertical-align:top|300px |style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%\"| {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||20|| Sergio Romero |- |RB ||25|| Antonio Valencia (c) |- |CB ||12|| Chris Smalling |- |CB ||17|| Daley Blind |- |LB ||36|| Matteo Darmian |- |DM ||21|| Ander Herrera |- |RM ||8 || Juan Mata || || |- |CM ||27|| Marouane Fellaini || |- |CM ||6 || Paul Pogba |- |LM ||22|| Henrikh Mkhitaryan || || |- |CF ||19|| Marcus Rashford || || |- |colspan=\"3\"|Substitutes: |- |GK ||1 || David de Gea |- |DF ||4 || Phil Jones |- |DF ||24|| Timothy Fosu-Mensah |- |MF ||14|| Jesse Lingard || || |- |MF ||16|| Michael Carrick |- |FW ||10|| Wayne Rooney || || |- |FW ||11|| Anthony Martial || || |- |colspan=\"3\"|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Jos\u00e9 Mourinho |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size:90%\" | Man of the Match: Ander Herrera (Manchester United) Assistant referees: Jure Praprotnik (Slovenia) Robert Vukan (Slovenia) Fourth official: Gianluca Rocchi (Italy) Additional assistant referees: Matej Jug (Slovenia) Slavko Vin\u010di\u0107 (Slovenia) Reserve assistant referee: Toma\u017e Klan\u010dnik (Slovenia) |style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"| Match rules * 90 minutes. * 30 minutes of extra time if necessary. * Penalty shoot-out if scores still level. * Seven named substitutes, of which up to three may be used. |} ===Statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+First half |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px\"| Statistic ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\"| Ajax ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\"| |- !scope=row|Goals scored |0 |1 |- !scope=row|Total shots |6 |4 |- !scope=row|Shots on target |1 |2 |- !scope=row|Saves |1 |1 |- !scope=row|Ball possession |66% |34% |- !scope=row|Corner kicks |2 |0 |- !scope=row|Fouls committed |6 |9 |- !scope=row|Offsides |0 |1 |- !scope=row|Yellow cards |0 |1 |- !scope=row|Red cards |0 |0 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Second half |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px\"| Statistic ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\"| Ajax ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\"| |- !scope=row|Goals scored |0 |1 |- !scope=row|Total shots |11 |2 |- !scope=row|Shots on target |2 |2 |- !scope=row|Saves |1 |2 |- !scope=row|Ball possession |67% |33% |- !scope=row|Corner kicks |3 |2 |- !scope=row|Fouls committed |9 |8 |- !scope=row|Offsides |0 |0 |- !scope=row|Yellow cards |3 |2 |- !scope=row|Red cards |0 |0 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Overall |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px\"| Statistic ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\"| Ajax ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\"| |- !scope=row|Goals scored |0 |2 |- !scope=row|Total shots |17 |6 |- !scope=row|Shots on target |3 |4 |- !scope=row|Saves |2 |3 |- !scope=row|Ball possession |67% |33% |- !scope=row|Corner kicks |5 |2 |- !scope=row|Fouls committed |15 |17 |- !scope=row|Offsides |0 |1 |- !scope=row|Yellow cards |3 |3 |- !scope=row|Red cards |0 |0 |} ==See also== *2017 UEFA Champions League Final *2017 UEFA Super Cup *AFC Ajax in European football *Manchester United F.C. in European football ==References== ==External links== *2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League *2017 UEFA Europa League Final, UEFA.com 2017 Final Europa League Final Category:International club association football competitions hosted by Sweden Category:AFC Ajax matches Category:Manchester United F.C. matches Europa League Final Europa League Final Category:May 2017 sports events in Europe Category:2017 in association football ",
