    "text": "Ice Hockey at Sheffield Arena Sheffield has a long history of involvement in sport. Although cricket was the first organised sport, it has gradually been supplanted by football. Both the main two local football teams grew out of cricket teams. Sheffield can claim many firsts in football the most famous one being Sheffield F.C. being the world's first and oldest football club. Today it has a club in every major team sport in England. Sheffield became the first UK National City of Sport in 1995 and is now home to the English Institute of Sport (EIS). Today the city is home to two league clubs Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United, top flight ice hockey (Sheffield Steelers) and basketball (Sheffield Sharks) and a Premier League speedway team (Sheffield Tigers). Sheffield Eagles is the main rugby league club and operates a level below the Super League. There are six boxing world champions from Sheffield, Clinton Woods and Johnny Nelson. David Sherwood is a top ten British tennis player from the city and the former England cricket captain, Michael Vaughan, was brought up and lives in Sheffield. Joe Simpson, a famous climber also comes from the city. The largest stadium is Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday, which holds around 39,850. The now-demolished Don Valley Stadium was formerly the largest athletics stadium in the United Kingdom. Bramall Lane is the world's oldest major football ground and holds around 33,000 and Sandygate Road, home to Hallam F.C., is the oldest football ground. The World Snooker Championships has been held at the Crucible Theatre since 1977. ==History== === Early sport=== The earliest reference to cricket involving Sheffield was a match between Sheffield and Nottingham in 1771.Bygone cricket (last accessed 4 August 2006) The first recorded game of football in Sheffield was played in 1793 between Sheffield and Norton (a village in Derbyshire at the time but now a suburb of Sheffield). The game initially started as six a side but numbers swelled after both sides called for reinforcements. It continued for 3 days after which it descended into a general row.Percy M. Young (1962), Football in Sheffield, S. Paul Hallam Cricket Club was formed in 1804 and started using land in Sandygate as their ground. It continues to be used to this day and is acknowledged as the oldest ground in the world. Sheffield Wednesday Cricket Club was formed in 1820. The first cricket match between Yorkshire and Lancashire took place at Hyde Park in 1949. ===Birth of Football=== By the 1850s the city had several cricket clubs, the matches mainly being played during the summer. Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest wanted to start a team that could keep the players together during the winter and formed Sheffield F.C. In 1857 they decided to write the first rule book for football called Sheffield Rules. By 1860 there were 15 football clubs in the city. Sheffield United Cricket Club was formed in 1854, so called because it was made up of the uniting of several local sides. It was the first club to be named United. The Bramall Lane ground was built a year later. Yorkshire County Cricket Club was also formed in the city in 1863. The teams continued to play under the Sheffield Rules after the formation of the FA known locally as the London FA. They formed their own association in 1867 and played the first ever competitive football competition, the Youdan Cup, in the same year. Another significant event was the formation of Sheffield Wednesday football club. The first inter-association football match between Sheffield FA and London (the FA) was played at Bramall lane. Sheffield won the match 3\u20131. Many such matches were played during the 1870s with the home side dictating which rules they should play under. This eventually led to a merger of the two set of rules in 1878. ===Decline of cricket, rise of football=== Sheffield United F.C. were formed in 1889. In the same year Sheffield Wednesday turned professional and applied for membership of the Football League. This was denied so they became founding members of the Football Alliance and won its competition in the first season. Both the clubs were accepted into the Football League in 1892. Wednesday into division 1 and United into the newly formed second division. At the turn of the century the city enjoyed huge success starting with Sheffield Wednesday winning the FA Cup in 1896. United then won the league in 1898, the FA Cup the following year, and again in 1902. Wednesday then won the league twice in a row in 1903/4 and 1904/5. Sheffield F.C. also won their first cup, the FA Amateur Cup, in 1904. Meanwhile, cricket in the city was in decline. Yorkshire CCC moved its headquarters to Headingley, Leeds in 1893. Although Bramall Lane hosted its first test match in 1912, the experiment was seen as a disaster and was never repeated. England lost to Australia, which was blamed on poor light conditions caused by the heavy air pollution which used to plague the city. Sheffield Wednesday cricket club ceased to exist in 1925 due to a lack of players. The following decades saw intermittent success for both clubs, including another brace of league titles for Wednesday in 1928\u20131930. The last FA Cup win for a Sheffield club was in 1935 by Wednesday. ===Post war years=== Both clubs then went into decline after the Second World War. Wednesday sank to the third division in 1974 and United were relegated as far as the fourth division by 1981. Cricket matches, at a national level, ceased altogether in the city 1973 when the last county match was played at Bramall Lane. In 1989, Sheffield Wednesday's home ground of Hillsborough was the scene of a tragedy when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death during an FA Cup semifinal in the infamous Hillsborough disaster. This prompted a series of safety improvements at football grounds around the country, with terraced stands converted to all seated accommodation. The early 1990s saw an upsurge in the fortunes of both clubs starting with Wednesday winning the League Cup in 1991. The two teams then met in the FA Cup semi-final in 1993. Wednesday won the match 2\u20131 but went on to lose both the final and League Cup final, both to Arsenal, during which season the Owls visited Wembley four times. Both teams, however, began to lose fortune as the decade progressed and were both relegated from the top fight; United in 1994, and Wednesday in 2000. The Blades hovered in the second tier for more than 10 years, until they briefly re-entered the Premier League for the 2006\u201307 season, but were relegated straight back down after an unsuccessful campaign accumulating only 38 points. Wednesday's performance in the first decade of the 21st century has been arguably the worst in the club's history; following relegation from the Premier League in 2000 they were further relegated to the third tier in 2003. The Owls came back to the Championship in 2005 via the League One Play-offs, but after a five season spell in the Championship, the club again found themselves back down in the third tier for the 2010\u201311 season. United were also relegated to League One in time for the 2011\u201312 season, a season in which both clubs contested to get out of the division, with Wednesday being victorious in the end finishing in second place to return to the Championship. United contested the play-offs, but lost in the final to Huddersfield. In the 2010s, Sheffield Wednesday have once again been the more successful of the two Sheffield Clubs, having regained promotion to the Championship in 2012, whilst Sheffield United continue to compete in League One, on the back of three unsuccessful play-off campaigns over four seasons. Sheffield was briefly home to a third Football League club from 2008 to 2012 when Rotherham United played their home matches at Don Valley Stadium, following a dispute with the owner of their Millmoor ground. Rotherham moved back to their hometown in 2012 following the completion of the New York Stadium ==Football== There are two derbies played in the city. Sheffield United and Wednesday contest the Steel City Derby in the league or sometimes as a pre-season friendly if they are not in the same division. Hallam F.C. and Sheffield F.C. still play the world's oldest derby. They are currently both in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division. ===Existing Clubs=== *Hallam F.C. *Sheffield F.C. *Sheffield United F.C. *Sheffield Wednesday F.C. *Stocksbridge Park Steels F.C. ==Cricket== Sheffield still has a number of local cricket teams, including Sheffield United Cricket Club, Shiregreen Cricket Club, Hallam Cricket Club and Sheffield Collegiate CC.

They have dominated the National League winning it every year from 1991 to 2002. However, other teams have caught up in recent years. Both Sheffield University and Sheffield Hallam University have basketball teams and SHU has produced many good BUCS (British Universities and College Sports) basketball teams over the years reaching the national finals several times. Many SHU players have gone on to play on in other high-level basketball leagues around the country. ==Boxing== Sheffield has enjoyed huge success in boxing mainly due to the Wincobank gym run by Brendan Ingle. During the 1990s several world champions were produced including Naseem Hamed, Herol Graham, Johnny Nelson and Paul Jones. Sheffield continued to produce world champions in the 2000s with the likes of Clinton Woods, Junior Witter, and Kell Brook. ==Other sports== Other notable clubs are the Sheffield Eagles rugby league club based at Don Valley Stadium who won the Rugby League Challenge Cup in 1998. Sheffield Tigers is a local speedway team based at Owlerton Stadium. Speedway arrived at Owlerton in Sheffield in 1929 and a team took part in league speedway for a number of the pre-war seasons. The track re-opened in 1945 for a couple of meetings and the re-formed Tigers raced in the Northern League of 1946 and the National League Division Two 1947 \u2013 1950. (In part of 1950 the team were known as The Tars.) In 1951 the promotion failed after competing in the Division Two Regional competition and a few open meetings were staged in 1952.
