M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed ( 1848 \u2013 June 23, 1870) was the youngest child of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith founder Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and his wife \u00c1s\u00edyih Kh\u00e1num. He was given the title G\u035fhusn-i-Athar (\"Purest Branch\" or \"Purer Branch\").The elative is a stage of gradation in Arabic that can be used both for a superlative or a comparative. G\u035fhusn-i-Athar could mean \"Purest Branch\" or \"Purer Branch.\" == Biography == He was born in Tehran, Persia as Mehdi Nuri.Named after his father's deceased brother, Nuri being his father's surname. Mirza Mehdi was his mother's favourite child. Mihd\u00ed did not remember his once luxurious life as at the age of four his father, founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, was arrested and imprisoned on account of his faith. The family were left in penury and his sister later recollected how the siblings would hold each other and weep. When his family were exiled to Baghdad, the family thought it necessary to leave M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed in Persia as a result of his health. He was left to the care of his maternal great-grandmother and his paternal aunt. The separation was hard for his family, especially his mother. At the age of twelve, he rejoined his family in Baghdad. There he accompanied his father through all his exiles and grew very close to him. He later became the amanuenses of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and a staunch companion. He was beloved by the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds; revered in a similar sense to \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and was noted for his meekness, piety, purity and sincerity. Whilst rapt in prayer, chanting the Ode of the Dove (a prayer revealed by his father during the period in Kurdistan) and pacing on the rooftop, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed fell through a skylight, and the wooden crate that he fell onto pierced his ribs and injured his lungs. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h was horrified and asked for a physician to attend his son. However, by this time it was too late. His mother was especially hurt and poignantly caressed her blood-soaked son shortly before his death. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h was heard lamenting \u201cMihd\u00ed! O Mihd\u00ed!\u201d as his son was dying. His companions surrounding him on his death-bed remember his courtesy despite his pain, and even apologizing that he was lying before their presence.In Persian custom, it is rude to be lying down in front of people; it is viewed as disrespectful. The graves of Navv\u00e1b and Mirz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed within the Monument Gardens. He died on June 23, 1870, at the age of twenty-two. His dying wish was that the believers would attain the presence of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, a wish which the broken-hearted Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h accepted. His body was taken away and buried in a Muslim cemetery. His sister collected the blood-soaked clothes of Mihd\u00ed and other relics. These are seen in the International Archives in Israel. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h eulogized his son and connected the subsequent easing of restrictions and pilgrims' ability to visit him to his dying prayer. He wrote that his death caused \u201cthe Concourse on high to lament\u201d. He also exalted his death, comparing it to the intended sacrifice of Abraham's son, the crucifixion of Christ and the martyrdom of the Imam Husayn. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h also named him the Purest Branch. The exiles and companions commented that he had been a \"pillar of strength\" amongst the exiles and adored for his gentleness and patience. Shoghi Effendi later removed the body of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed and reinterred it alongside his mother, in the gardens below the Arc on Mount Carmel, Haifa, in an area now called the Monument Gardens. == See also == Others buried in the Monument Gardens: * \u00c1siyih Kh\u00e1num, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's first wife, Mirz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed's mother (also called Nawab). * Bah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num, Mirz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed's elder sister. * Munirih Kh\u00e1num, wife of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, Mirz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed's elder brother. ==Notes and citations== ;Notes ;Citations == References == * * * * * * * * == External links == * The Purest Branch * M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed The Purest Branch Category:Family of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h Category:People from Tehran Category:Burials in Israel Category:People from Acre, Israel Category:Iranian prisoners and detainees Category:1870 deaths Category:1848 births Category:Iranian emigrants to the Ottoman Empire Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Ottoman Empire Category:19th-century Iranian people ",
