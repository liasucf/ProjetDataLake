    "text": "__notoc__ Robert Ian Goldblatt (born 1949) is a mathematical logician who is Emeritus Professor in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand. His most popular books are Logics of Time and Computation and Topoi: the Categorial Analysis of Logic. He has also written a graduate level textbook on hyperreal numbers which is an introduction to nonstandard analysis. He has been Coordinating Editor of The Journal of Symbolic Logic and a Managing Editor of Studia Logica. He was elected Fellow and Councillor of the Royal Society of New Zealand, President of the New Zealand Mathematical Society, and represented New Zealand to the International Mathematical Union. In 2012 he was awarded the Jones Medal for lifetime achievement in mathematics. ==Books and handbook chapters== * 1979: Topoi: The Categorial Analysis of Logic, North-Holland. Revised edition 1984. Dover Publications edition 2006. Internet edition, Project Euclid. :: Benjamin C. Pierce recommends it as an \"excellent beginner book\", praising it for the use of simple set-theoretic examples and motivating intuitions, but noted that it \"is sometimes criticized by category theorists for being misleading on some aspects of the subject, and for presenting long and difficult proofs where simple ones are available.\" But the preface of the Dover edition observes (p. xv) that \"This is a book about logic, rather than category theory per se. It aims to explain, in an introductory way, how certain logical ideas are illuminated by a category-theoretic perspective.\" * 1982: Axiomatising the Logic of Computer Programming, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 130, Springer-Verlag. * 1987: Orthogonality and Spacetime Geometry, Universitext Springer-Verlag * 1987: Logics of Time and Computation.
