    "text": "Air pirates (also known as sky pirates) are a type of stock character from science fiction and fantasy. ==Description== Fictional air pirates typically operate as pirates in the air, or, in general, the atmosphere of a planet, dwarf planet or moon, and travel by aircraft, as opposed to the more traditional pirates on the high seas, who travel by ship. However, just as traditional seafaring pirates target sailing ships, air pirates serve a similar role in science fiction and fantasy media: they capture and plunder aircraft and other targets for cargo, loot and occasionally they steal an entire aircraft, sometimes killing the crewmembers in the process. However, their dress and speech may vary; it may correspond to the particular author's vision of the story's setting, rather than their seafaring counterparts. On the other hand, air pirates may be modeled after stereotypical sea pirates. Some air pirates use airborne aircraft carriers as mobile bases from which to conduct raids. Air pirates made early appearances in novels, silent films, comics and pulp magazines, and have since appeared in a variety of media, including alternate history, steampunk, and dieselpunk works. ==In popular culture== * Robur, an inventor who kidnaps people and takes them aboard his advanced aircraft in the 1886 novel Robur the Conqueror and its 1904 sequel Master of the World (both written by Jules Verne), as well as in the 1961 film adaptation based on elements of both novels. * Captain Mors, a.k.a. the \"Air Pirate\", in the German pulp magazine The Air Pirate and His Steerable Airship (1908\u20131911). * Captain Alfonso Payton, a.k.a. the \"Sky Pirate\", in the 1909 novel The Sky Pirate. * The 1910 short story The Sky Police by John A.

This occurred in 1917, when the civilian Norwegian schooner Royal was boarded and captured by a boarding party from the German Zeppelin Zeppelin LZ 66 |L23 . ==See also== * * * * * ==References== Category:Stock characters ",
