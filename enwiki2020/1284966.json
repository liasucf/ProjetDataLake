    "text": "Balys Sruoga (February 2, 1896, in Baibokai, Kovno Governorate \u2013 October 16, 1947, Vilnius) was a Lithuanian poet, playwright, critic, and literary theorist. ==Early life== He contributed to cultural journals from his early youth. His works were published by the liberal wing of the Lithuanian cultural movement, and also in various Lithuanian newspapers and other outlets (such as Au\u0161rin\u0117, Rygos naujienos etc.). In 1914, he began studying literature in Saint Petersburg, and later in Moscow, due to World War I and the Russian Revolution. In 1921, he enrolled in the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where in 1924 he received his Ph.D for a doctoral thesis on Lithuanian folklore. After returning to Lithuania, Sruoga taught at the University of Lithuania, and established a theater seminar that eventually became a course of study. He also wrote various articles on literature. From 1930 he began writing dramas, first Mil\u017eino paunksm\u0117, later Radvila Perk\u016bnas, Baisioji naktis and Aitvaras teis\u0117jas. In 1939, he began teaching at Vilnius University. ==Nazi captivity== ===Forest of the Gods=== Sruoga's best known work is the novel Forest of the Gods (Diev\u0173 mi\u0161kas), based on his own life experiences as a prisoner in Stutthof concentration camp in Sztutowo, Free City of Danzig now present-day Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland, where he was sent in March 1943 together with forty-seven other Lithuanian intellectuals after the Nazis started a campaign against possible anti-Nazi agitation in occupied Lithuania. In the book, Sruoga revealed life in a concentration camp through the eyes of a man whose only way to save his life and maintain his dignity was to view everything through a veil of irony and humor, where torturers and their victims are exposed as imperfect human beings, being far removed from the false ideals of their political leaders. For example, he wrote \"A man is not a machine. He gets tired.\", referring to the guards beating prisoners. Originally the novel was suppressed by the Soviet officials; it was ultimately published in 1957, ten years after the author's death. In 2005, a movie with the same titled as the book was released. The film \"The Forest of the Gods\" became the most profitable film released after Lithuania gained independence. ==Later life== After the Soviets liberated the Nazi camps, Sruoga continued to be held in the same camp. However, in 1945, he returned to Vilnius and continued teaching at Vilnius University, where he wrote the dramas Paj\u016brio kurortas and Barbora Radvilait\u0117. The authorities' refusal to publish Forest of The Gods and weak health resulting from his time in concentration camps led to his death in October 16, 1947.Baltic Online Lesson 2: Lithuanian The 2005 film Forest of the Gods was based on the book. ==References== ==External links== * Bibliography Category:1896 births Category:1947 deaths Category:20th-century dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century poets Category:Lithuanian dramatists and playwrights Category:Lithuanian folklorists Category:Lithuanian poets Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:People from Bir\u017eai District Municipality Category:People from Kovno Governorate Category:Saint Petersburg State University alumni Category:Stutthof concentration camp survivors Category:Vilnius University faculty Category:Vytautas Magnus University faculty ",
