    "text": "The 1938 FA Cup Final was contested by Preston North End and Huddersfield Town at Wembley Stadium. Preston, losing finalists the previous year, won by a single goal. This was their second win in the competition. ==Background== After 29 minutes of extra time it was still 0-0 and BBC commentator Thomas Woodrooffe said \"if there's a goal scored now, I'll eat my hat\". Seconds later, Preston were awarded a penalty, from which George Mutch scored the winning goal; Woodrooffe kept his promise, though it was one made of cake and marzipan. This was the first FA Cup final to be broadcast on television. It was a repeat of the 1922 FA Cup Final. This time the scores were reversed but once again a penalty was needed to separate the two sides. Three of the players who participated in the final (Andy Beattie & Bill Shankly of Preston and Eddie Boot of Huddersfield) would all manage Huddersfield within 20 years of this final. The last surviving member of the winning team was Bobby Beattie, who died in September 2002 at the age of 86. ==Match details== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font- size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | ||1 || George Holdcroft |- | ||2 || Len Gallimore |- | ||3 || Andy Beattie |- | ||4 || Bill Shankly |- | ||5 || Tom Smith (c) |- | ||6 || Bob Batey |- | ||7 || Dickie Watmough |- | ||8 || George Mutch |- | ||9 || Bud Maxwell |- | ||10|| Bobby Beattie |- | ||11|| Hugh O'Donnell |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| James Taylor (acting) |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | ||1 || Bob Hesford |- | ||2 || Benny Craig |- | ||3 || Reg Mountford |- | ||4 || Ken Willingham |- | ||5 || Alf Young (c) |- | ||6 || Eddie Boot |- | ||7 || Joe Hulme |- | ||8 || Jimmy Isaac |- | ||9 || Willie MacFadyen |- | ||10|| Bobby Barclay |- | ||11|| Pat Beasley |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Clem Stephenson |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *Replay if scores still level. |} ==Road to Wembley== ===Preston North End=== ===Huddersfield Town=== ==References== ==External links== *FA Cup Final lineups Category:FA Cup Finals FA Cup Final FA Cup Final 1938 FA Cup Final 1938 FA Cup Final FA Cup Final ",
