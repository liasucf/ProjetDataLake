    "text": "Orgon (ancient: Urgonum, Castrum de Urgone) is a commune in the Bouches-du- Rh\u00f4ne department in southern France. ==Geography== Neighbouring villages and small towns include Les Baux-de-Provence, Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence and Cavaillon. Orgon is one of the twelve communes of the Alpilles area, a small mountain chain made famous through the paintings of Vincent van Gogh and novels of the French author Alphonse Daudet. The river Durance runs through it. ==Population== ==Sights== The village of Orgon harbours a 19th-century monastery overlooking the Durance valley (Notre Dame du Beauregard) and the ruins of a Templar castle. ==History== In history, Orgon is known through the attempted lynching of Napoleon Bonaparte on his way to Saint Helena passing through the village. Orgon was also the birthplace of the French poet Antoine Pomme (1620) and the painter Louis Esp\u00e9randieu (1787-1857). ==Ecology== Having given its name to a specific type of limestone found only in this area, the recent plans of extension of the mining activities of the company OMYA in Orgon have led to protest actions by French intellectuals throughout the country, worried about the risks to the preservation of the natural and historic specificities of Alpilles hills. The dispute regarding the extension plans of the multi-national mining company OMYA have to an extent come to an end through the announced nomination of the territory as a protected Regional Parc as of January 1, 2007. ==See also== * Communes of the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne department ==References== ==External links== * Tourism office website Category:Communes of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne Category:Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne communes articles needing translation from French Wikipedia ",
