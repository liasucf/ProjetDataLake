The star was given the formal name 'Parumleo' in January 2020.A star and its orbiting planet now bear names with Singapore connection == Star characteristics == The WASP-32 star is relatively depleted of lithium, which is common for massive stars hosting hot Jupiter planets.. == Planetary system == The \"hot Jupiter\" class planet WASP-32 b, later named 'Viculus', was discovered around WASP-32 in 2010. It was found to orbit the parent star in prograde direction in 2014. The follow-up study utilizing transit timing variation analysis, have failed to find any, therefore have excluded existence of other massive planets around WASP-32 as in 2015.Lei-Lei Sun, Sheng-Hong Gu, Xiao-Bin Wang at al., \"Long-term transit timing monitoring and homogenous study of WASP-32\", 2015 == References == Category:Planetary systems with one confirmed planet Category:Pisces (constellation) Category:G-type main-sequence stars Category:Planetary transit variables Parumleo J00155080+0112016 32 ",
