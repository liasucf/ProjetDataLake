    "text": "Gabriel Faur\u00e9: M\u00e9lodies is a 54-minute studio album of eighteen of Faur\u00e9's art songs performed by the mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade with piano accompaniment by Jean-Philippe Collard. It was released in 1983. A second, 57-minute version of the album, released in 2011, includes a bonus track in which von Stade sings the Chanson de M\u00e9lisande from Faur\u00e9's incidental music for Maurice Maeterlinck's play Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, accompanied by the Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse under the direction of Michel Plasson. ==Recording== The eighteen songs on the first version of the album were digitally recorded on 16-18 December 1981 and on 8 June 1982 in the Salle Wagram, Paris. The nineteenth song that was added to the second version of the album was recorded using analogue technology on 12-15 June 1980 in the Halle- aux-Grains, Toulouse. ==Cover art== The cover of the second version of the album was designed by Shaun Mills for WLP Ltd, and features a photograph of von Stade taken by Julian Broad. ==Critical reception== ===Reviews=== Gabriel Faur\u00e9 in 1905, photographed by F\u00e9lix Nadar J. B. Steane reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in March 1983, comparing it with other performances of Faur\u00e9's songs by Dame Janet BakerBaker, Janet: A French Song Recital, with Gerald Moore (piano), EMI LP, ASD-2590, Anne-Marie RoddeFaur\u00e9, Gabriel: M\u00e9lodies, with Anne-Marie Rodde and Th\u00e9odore Paraskivesco (piano), Calliope LP, CAL-1846 and Dame Maggie TeyteTeyte, Maggie: L'Exquise, EMI LP, RLS-716. \"Notre amour\", he wrote, exemplified the \"fine and seemingly spontaneous play of light and shade\" that Frederica von Stade brought to the composer. In the song's first line, \"Notre amour est chose l\u00e9g\u00e8re\", the love celebrated by Armande Silvestre's merry lass was \"light as air\", \"lifted by a gauze of finest weave in the hands of the sylphs\". \"Notre amour est chose charmante\", the m\u00e9lodie continued, and the charm of that love was equalled by the singer's and the song's. Next, \"Notre amour est chose sacr\u00e9e\", and von Stade darkened her tone to portray the poet's enigmatic forest where there seemed to be a message in the stillness. Lastly, \"Notre amour est chose \u00e9ternelle\", and von Stade's voice rose in uninhibited joy eloquent of the rapture of the lover's soul. Catulle Mend\u00e8s Not every interpreter of the song had expressed its different feelings so successfully. Anne-Marie Rodde, with her \"clear, young, very French tone\", was a \"delightful\" performer of Faur\u00e9, but although her \"amour\" was passionately happy, it did not seem to \"care a centime whether it was 'l\u00e9g\u00e8re' or 'sacr\u00e9e'.\" Janet Baker, usually an imaginative artist, made the song into a prosaic utterance comparatively devoid of charm.Steane, J. B.: Gramophone, March 1983, p. 91 Faur\u00e9's melodies were ideal material for von Stade, \"falling easily within the loveliest part of the voice, gaining warmth of expression from that deeper note of wistfulness often latent in the tone.\" Her interpretations served Faur\u00e9's music with selfless fidelity. She did not subject his music to emphases that called unwelcome attention to themselves, but did inflect his seemingly simple melodic lines to acknowledge his songs' harmonies and the words of his poets. One was seldom conscious of artifice intruding into performances that mostly sounded instinctive. Jean-Philippe Collard was for the most part a good partner at the keyboard. At times, his piano was too prominent, and there were moments - such as in the opening bars of \"Clair de lune\" - when his left hand sounded unduly heavier than his right. But in \"Mandoline\", his incisive playing gave \"a delicious spring to the rhythms of the serenade\", and in \"Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave\", his accompaniment supported von Stade's voice like the softest of pillows beneath the head of the song's awakening sleeper. Victor Hugo in 1876, photographed by \u00c9tienne Carjat Taken as a whole, the album's one arguable defect was that it was slower paced than some listeners might prefer (although in \"Dans les ruines d'une abbaye\", von Stade's reading had a greater momentum than the classic version sung by Maggie Teyte). EMI's engineers had recorded both voice and piano beautifully and balanced them judiciously. \"The recital\", Steane concluded, \"provides a delightful selection of Faur\u00e9's songs, including some of the best known and others very rarely met. It presents this lovely singer at her best, and a composer who gives increasing pleasure as the years go by: chose charmante.\" George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in October 1983. All of Gabriel Faur\u00e9's songs seemed simple on the surface, he wrote, especially those dating from the composer's early years, but hidden inside them was a world of rhythmic and harmonic sophistication. They were diverse in character and feeling. Some, like \"Le papillon et la fleur\", were virtually domestic salon pieces. Most, like \"Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave\" or \"Clair de lune\", were memorable for their sensuality. A few, like \"Prison\" or \"Au cimeti\u00e8re\", were \"startling with their muted passion or stark despair\". Jean Richepin Frederica von Stade presented Faure's music with \"a luscious tone that exploits the warmth of her mid-range and with a notable sensitivity to the poetic texts.\" Von Stade's singing had always been enjoyable, but some of her records had been marred by effects that sounded contrived. On her new disc, she had become a better artist then ever before. Her interpretations were now \"straightforward, unmannered and, when the mood calls for it, convincingly exultant.\" Jean- Philippe Collard's accompaniments were \"firm and muscular\", which was in accord with what Faur\u00e9 would have wanted - he was a musician who preferred the clear light of classicism to the mists of transcendence. Sometimes, indeed, as in \"Au bord de l'eau\", he was probably sterner than was advisable, and von Stade was deprived of some of the freedom that she should have been permitted. EMI's audio quality was excellent. The album was \"a beautiful record\" that was not just a treat but a prize.Jellinek, George: Stereo Review, October 1983, p. 66 The album was also discussed in The Complete Penguin Stereo Record and Cassette Guide, which praised von Stade as \"a deeply persuasive interpreter of French m\u00e9lodies\"Greenfield, Edward, Layton, Robert and March, Ivan: The Complete Penguin Stereo Record and Cassette Guide, Penguin, 1984, p. 410, and in Fanfare, where her recital was described as \"uptight and overblown\"Fanfare, Vol. 13, Issue 2, 1989, p. 205. ===Accolades=== Under the title Faur\u00e9: Eighteen Songs, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for the best classical vocal solo performance of 1983.https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/frederica-von-stade-0 Stereo Review judged the album to be the best recordings of the month, and J. B. Steane included the album in his 1983 Gramophone Critics' Choice list of the best recordings of the year.Steane, J.
