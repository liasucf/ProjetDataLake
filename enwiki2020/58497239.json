The medication is given once per month by injection into muscle. ==Medical uses== EBB/DHPA is used as a once-a-month combined injectable contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women. ===Available forms=== EBB/DHPA contains 10 mg estradiol benzoate butyrate (EBB), an estrogen, and 150 mg algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide; DHPA), a progestin. ==Pharmacology== ===Pharmacodynamics=== EBB/DHPA has been said to have relatively weak estrogenic activity and has been described as \"progestogen- dominant\". ===Pharmacokinetics=== EBB has a shorter duration than estradiol enantate of about 3 weeks. EBB/DHPA was developed because it was thought that the duration of EBB would be more suitable for use as a once-monthly combined injectable contraceptive than estradiol enantate in estradiol enantate/algestone acetophenide. ==Society and culture== ===Brand names=== EBB/DHPA is marketed under the brand names Neolutin N, Redimen, Soluna, and Unijab.https://www.drugs.com/international/soluna.html It was originally developed under the tentative brand name Unimens, but ultimately was not marketed under this particular brand name. ===Availability=== EBB/DHPA is available only in Peru and Singapore. ==See also== * Combined injectable birth control \u00a7 Available forms * Estradiol enantate/algestone acetophenide * List of combined sex-hormonal preparations ==References== Category:Combined injectable contraceptives ",
