It succeeded the First Turnbull Ministry following the 2016 Australian federal election on 2 July 2016. On 13 January 2017, Sussan Ley resigned from her portfolios after an expenses scandal. In the following rearrangement, the roles of Greg Hunt and Arthur Sinodinos were changed, while Ken Wyatt became the first Indigenous Australian to serve as a federal minister.

On 27 October 2017, Joyce and Fiona Nash were disqualified from parliament by the High Court, also due to holding dual citizenship, while Canavan was ruled eligible. The ministry ended with Malcolm Turnbull's replacement by Scott Morrison following the Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills, 2018. ==Final Cabinet composition== Following Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce's resignation from cabinet, the fifth rearrangement of the Second Turnbull Ministry was sworn in on 26 February 2018 by the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau, in her capacity as Administrator of the Commonwealth while Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove was overseas. Michael McCormack took on Joyce's roles after being elected National Party leader that morning.
