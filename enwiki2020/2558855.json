    "text": "In calculus, Leibniz's rule for differentiation under the integral sign, named after Gottfried Leibniz, states that for an integral of the form :\\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(x,t)\\,dt, where -\\infty < a(x), b(x) < \\infty, the derivative of this integral is expressible as :\\frac{d}{dx} \\left (\\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(x,t)\\,dt \\right )= f\\big(x,b(x)\\big)\\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} b(x) - f\\big(x,a(x)\\big)\\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} a(x) + \\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,t) \\,dt, where the partial derivative indicates that inside the integral, only the variation of f(x, t) with x is considered in taking the derivative. Notice that if a(x) and b(x) are constants rather than functions of x, we have a special case of Leibniz's rule: :\\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\int_{a}^{b} f(x,t)\\,dt \\right)= \\int_{a}^{b}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,t) \\,dt. Besides, if a(x)=a and b(x)=x, which is a common situation as well (for example, in the proof of Cauchy's repeated integration formula), we have: :\\frac{d}{dx} \\left (\\int_{a}^{x} f(x,t)dt \\right )= f\\big(x,x\\big) + \\int_{a}^{x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,t) dt, Thus under certain conditions, one may interchange the integral and partial differential operators. This important result is particularly useful in the differentiation of integral transforms. An example of such is the moment generating function in probability theory, a variation of the Laplace transform, which can be differentiated to generate the moments of a random variable. Whether Leibniz's integral rule applies is essentially a question about the interchange of limits. == General form: Differentiation under the integral sign == :Theorem. Let f(x, t) be a function such that both f(x, t) and its partial derivative fx(x, t) are continuous in t and x in some region of the (x, t)-plane, including a(x) \u2264 t \u2264 b(x), x0 \u2264 x \u2264 x1. Also suppose that the functions a(x) and b(x) are both continuous and both have continuous derivatives for x0 \u2264 x \u2264 x1. Then, for x0 \u2264 x \u2264 x1, ::\\frac{d}{dx} \\left (\\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)}f(x,t)\\,dt \\right) = f\\big(x,b(x)\\big)\\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} b(x) - f\\big(x,a(x)\\big)\\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} a(x) + \\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,t) \\,dt. This formula is the general form of the Leibniz integral rule and can be derived using the fundamental theorem of calculus. The (first) fundamental theorem of calculus is just the particular case of the above formula where a(x) = a, a constant, b(x) = x, and f(x, t) = f(t). If both upper and lower limits are taken as constants, then the formula takes the shape of an operator equation: ::\\mathcal{I}_t \\partial_x = \\partial_x \\mathcal{I}_t where \\partial_x is the partial derivative with respect to x and \\mathcal{I}_t is the integral operator with respect to t over a fixed interval. That is, it is related to the symmetry of second derivatives, but involving integrals as well as derivatives. This case is also known as the Leibniz integral rule. The following three basic theorems on the interchange of limits are essentially equivalent: * the interchange of a derivative and an integral (differentiation under the integral sign; i.e., Leibniz integral rule); * the change of order of partial derivatives; * the change of order of integration (integration under the integral sign; i.e., Fubini's theorem). == Three-dimensional, time- dependent case == Figure 1: A vector field F(r, t) defined throughout space, and a surface \u03a3 bounded by curve \u2202\u03a3 moving with velocity v over which the field is integrated. A Leibniz integral rule for a two dimensional surface moving in three dimensional space is :\\frac {d}{dt} \\iint_{\\Sigma (t)} \\mathbf{F} (\\mathbf{r}, t) \\cdot d \\mathbf{A} = \\iint_{\\Sigma (t)}\\left(\\mathbf{F}_t (\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\left[ abla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} (\\mathbf{r}, t) \\right] \\mathbf{v} \\right) \\cdot d \\mathbf{A} - \\oint_{\\partial \\Sigma (t)} \\left[ \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{F} ( \\mathbf{r}, t) \\right] \\cdot d \\mathbf{s}, where: :F(r, t) is a vector field at the spatial position r at time t, :\u03a3 is a surface bounded by the closed curve \u2202\u03a3, :dA is a vector element of the surface \u03a3, :ds is a vector element of the curve \u2202\u03a3, :v is the velocity of movement of the region \u03a3, :\u2207\u22c5 is the vector divergence, :\u00d7 is the vector cross product, :The double integrals are surface integrals over the surface \u03a3, and the line integral is over the bounding curve \u2202\u03a3. == Higher dimensions == The Leibniz integral rule can be extended to multidimensional integrals. In two and three dimensions, this rule is better known from the field of fluid dynamics as the Reynolds transport theorem: :\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{D(t)} F(\\vec{\\textbf x}, t) \\,dV = \\int_{D(t)} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} F(\\vec{\\textbf x}, t)\\,dV + \\int_{\\partial D(t)} F(\\vec{\\textbf x}, t) \\vec{\\textbf v}_b \\cdot d\\mathbf{\\Sigma}, where F(\\vec{\\textbf x}, t) is a scalar function, D(t) and \u2202D(t) denote a time- varying connected region of R3 and its boundary, respectively, \\vec{\\textbf v}_b is the Eulerian velocity of the boundary (see Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates) and d \u03a3 = n dS is the unit normal component of the surface element. The general statement of the Leibniz integral rule requires concepts from differential geometry, specifically differential forms, exterior derivatives, wedge products and interior products. With those tools, the Leibniz integral rule in n dimensions is :\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{\\Omega(t)}\\omega=\\int_{\\Omega(t)} i_{\\vec{\\textbf v}}(d_x\\omega)+\\int_{\\partial \\Omega(t)} i_{\\vec{\\textbf v}} \\omega+\\int_{\\Omega(t)}\\dot{\\omega}, where \u03a9(t) is a time-varying domain of integration, \u03c9 is a p-form, \\vec{\\textbf v}=\\frac{\\partial\\vec{\\textbf x}}{\\partial t} is the vector field of the velocity, i_{\\vec{\\textbf v}} denotes the interior product with \\vec{\\textbf v}, dx\u03c9 is the exterior derivative of \u03c9 with respect to the space variables only and \\dot{\\omega} is the time derivative of \u03c9. However, all of these identities can be derived from a most general statement about Lie derivatives: :\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\int_{\\text{im}_{\\psi_t}(\\Omega)} \\omega = \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathcal{L}_{\\Psi} \\omega, Here, the ambient manifold on which the differential form \\omega lives includes both space and time. :\\Omega is the region of integration (a submanifold) at a given instant (it does not depend on t, since its parametrization as a submanifold defines its position in time), :\\mathcal{L} is the Lie derivative, :\\Psi is the spacetime vector field obtained from adding the unitary vector field in the direction of time to the purely spatial vector field \\vec{\\textbf v} from the previous formulas (i.e, \\Psi is the spacetime velocity of \\Omega), :\\psi_t is a diffeomorphism from the one-parameter group generated by the flow of \\Psi, and :\\text{im}_{\\psi_t}(\\Omega) is the image of \\Omega under such diffeomorphism. Something remarkable about this form, is that it can account for the case when \\Omega changes its shape and size over time, since such deformations are fully determined by \\Psi. == Measure theory statement == Let X be an open subset of \\mathbf{R}, and \\Omega be a measure space. Suppose f\\colon X \\times \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R} satisfies the following conditions: #f(x,\\omega) is a Lebesgue-integrable function of \\omega for each x \\in X. #For almost all \\omega \\in \\Omega , the derivative f_x exists for all x \\in X. #There is an integrable function \\theta \\colon \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R} such that |f_x(x,\\omega)| \\leq \\theta ( \\omega) for all x \\in X and almost every \\omega \\in \\Omega. Then by the dominated convergence theorem for all x \\in X, :\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_\\Omega f(x, \\omega) \\, d\\omega = \\int_{\\Omega} f_x (x, \\omega) \\, d\\omega. == Proofs == === Proof of basic form === We first prove the case of constant limits of integration a and b. We use Fubini's theorem to change the order of integration. For every x and h, such that h>0 and both x and x+h are within [x0,x1], we have: : \\int_x^{x+h} \\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\,dt \\,dx = \\int_a^b \\int_x^{x+h} f_x(x,t) \\,dx \\,dt = \\int_a^b \\left(f(x+h,t)-f(x,t)\\right) \\,dt = \\int_a^b f(x+h,t) \\,dt - \\int_a^b f(x,t) \\,dt Note that the integrals at hand are well defined since f_x(x,t) is continuous at the closed rectangle [x_0,x_1] * [a,b] and thus also uniformly continuous there; thus its integrals by either dt or dx are continuous in the other variable and also integrable by it (essentially this is because for uniformly continuous functions, one may pass the limit through the integration sign, as elaborated below). Therefore: :\\frac{\\int_a^b f(x+h,t) \\,dt - \\int_a^b f(x,t) \\,dt }{h} = \\frac{1}{h}\\int_x^{x+h} \\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\,dt \\,dx = \\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h} Where we have defined: :F(u) \\equiv \\int_{x_0}^{u} \\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\,dt \\,dx (we may replace x0 here by any other point between x0 and x) F is differentiable with derivative \\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\,dt , so by the mean value theorem there is some x' in [x,x+h] satisfying: :\\frac{\\int_a^b f(x+h,t) \\,dt - \\int_a^b f(x,t) \\,dt }{h} = \\int_a^b f_x(x',t) \\,dt We now take the limit where h approaches zero. For the left hand side this limit is: :\\frac{d}{dx}\\int_a^b f(x,t) For the right hand side, we use the uniform continuity of fx(x',t) to get: : \\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\,dt since for uniformly continuous functions, one may pass the limit through the integration sign, as we now formally show: Since fx(x',t) is uniformly continuous at [x_0,x_1]X[a,b], for every \u03b5>0 there is a small enough region of x, such that for every x' in it and for every t in [a,b]: :f_x(x,t)-\\frac{\\epsilon}{|b-a|} < f_x(x',t) < f_x(x,t)+\\frac{\\epsilon}{|b-a|} thus: :\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\,dt - \\epsilon < \\int_a^b f_x(x',t) \\,dt < \\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\,dt + \\epsilon So indeed: \\lim_{x'\\rightarrow x} \\int_a^b f_x(x',t) = \\int_a^b f_x(x,t) And we thus prove the desired result: :\\frac{d}{dx}\\int_a^b f(x,t) = \\int_a^b f_x(x,t) ====Another proof using the bounded convergence theorem==== If the integrals at hand are Lebesgue integrals, we may use the bounded convergence theorem (valid for these integrals, but not for Riemann integrals) in order to show that the limit can be passed through the integral sign. Note that this proof is weaker in the sense that it only shows that fx(x,t) is Lebesgue integrable, but not that it is Riemann integrable. In the former (stronger) proof, if f(x,t) is Riemann integrable, then so is fx(x,t) (and thus is obviously also Lebesgue integrable). Let :u(x) = \\int_a^b f(x, t) \\,dt. \\qquad (1) By the definition of the derivative, :u'(x) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{u(x + h) - u(x)}{h}. \\qquad (2) Substitute equation (1) into equation (2). The difference of two integrals equals the integral of the difference, and 1/h is a constant, so :\\begin{align} u'(x) &= \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\int_a^bf(x + h, t)\\,dt - \\int_a^b f(x, t)\\,dt}{h} \\\\\\ &= \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\int_a^b\\left( f(x + h, t) - f(x,t) \\right)\\,dt}{h} \\\\\\ &= \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\int_a^b \\frac{f(x + h, t) - f(x, t)}{h} \\,dt. \\end{align} We now show that the limit can be passed through the integral sign. We claim that the passage of the limit under the integral sign is valid by the bounded convergence theorem (a corollary of the dominated convergence theorem). For each \u03b4 > 0, consider the difference quotient :f_\\delta(x, t) = \\frac{f(x + \\delta, t) - f(x, t)}{\\delta}. For t fixed, the mean value theorem implies there exists z in the interval [x, x + \u03b4] such that :f_\\delta(x, t) = f_x(z, t). Continuity of fx(x, t) and compactness of the domain together imply that fx(x, t) is bounded. The above application of the mean value theorem therefore gives a uniform (independent of t) bound on f_\\delta(x, t). The difference quotients converge pointwise to the partial derivative fx by the assumption that the partial derivative exists. The above argument shows that for every sequence {\u03b4n} -> 0, the sequence \\\\{f_{\\delta_n}(x, t)\\\\} is uniformly bounded and converges pointwise to fx. The bounded convergence theorem states that if a sequence of functions on a set of finite measure is uniformly bounded and converges pointwise, then passage of the limit under the integral is valid. In particular, the limit and integral may be exchanged for every sequence {\u03b4n} -> 0\\. Therefore, the limit as \u03b4 -> 0 may be passed through the integral sign. === Variable limits form === For a continuous real valued function g of one real variable, and real valued differentiable functions f_1 and f_2 of one real variable, :\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\,dt \\right )= g\\left(f_2(x)\\right) {f_2'(x)} - g\\left(f_1(x)\\right) {f_1'(x)}. This follows from the chain rule and the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Define : G(x) = \\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\,dt , and : \\Gamma(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} g(t) \\,dt . (The lower limit just has to be some number in the domain of g ) Then, G(x) can be written as a composition: G(x) = (\\Gamma \\circ f_2)(x) - (\\Gamma \\circ f_1)(x) . The Chain Rule then implies that : G'(x) = \\Gamma'\\left(f_2(x)\\right) f_2'(x) - \\Gamma'\\left(f_1(x)\\right) f_1'(x) . By the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, \\Gamma'(x) = g(x) . Therefore, substituting this result above, we get the desired equation: : G'(x) = g\\left(f_2(x)\\right) {f_2'(x)} - g\\left(f_1(x)\\right) {f_1'(x)} . **Note:** This form can be particularly useful if the expression to be differentiated is of the form: :\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} h(x)g(t) \\,dt Because h(x) does not depend on the limits of integration, it may be move out from under the integral sign, and the above form may be used with the Product rule, i.e. :\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} h(x)g(t) \\,dt \\right ) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(h(x) \\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\,dt \\right ) = h'(x)\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\,dt + h(x) \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\,dt \\right ) === General form with variable limits === Set :\\varphi(\\alpha) = \\int_a^b f(x,\\alpha)\\,dx, where a and b are functions of \u03b1 that exhibit increments \u0394a and \u0394b, respectively, when \u03b1 is increased by \u0394\u03b1. Then, :\\begin{align} \\Delta\\varphi &= \\varphi(\\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha) - \\varphi(\\alpha) \\\\\\ &= \\int_{a + \\Delta a}^{b + \\Delta b}f(x, \\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx - \\int_a^b f(x, \\alpha)\\,dx \\\\\\ &= \\int_{a + \\Delta a}^af(x, \\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx + \\int_a^bf(x, \\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx + \\int_b^{b + \\Delta b} f(x, \\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx - \\int_a^b f(x, \\alpha)\\,dx \\\\\\ &= -\\int_a^{a + \\Delta a} f(x, \\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx + \\int_a^b [f(x, \\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha) - f(x,\\alpha)]\\,dx + \\int_b^{b + \\Delta b} f(x, \\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx. \\end{align} A form of the mean value theorem, \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = (b - a)f(\\xi), where a < \u03be < b, may be applied to the first and last integrals of the formula for \u0394\u03c6 above, resulting in :\\Delta\\varphi = -\\Delta a f(\\xi_1, \\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha) + \\int_a^b [f(x, \\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha) - f(x,\\alpha)]\\,dx + \\Delta b f(\\xi_2, \\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha). Divide by \u0394\u03b1 and let \u0394\u03b1 \u2192 0. Notice \u03be1 \u2192 a and \u03be2 \u2192 b. We may pass the limit through the integral sign: :\\lim_{\\Delta\\alpha\\to 0}\\int_a^b \\frac{f(x,\\alpha + \\Delta\\alpha) - f(x,\\alpha)}{\\Delta\\alpha}\\,dx = \\int_a^b \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha}f(x, \\alpha)\\,dx, again by the bounded convergence theorem. This yields the general form of the Leibniz integral rule, :\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\alpha} = \\int_a^b \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha}f(x, \\alpha)\\,dx + f(b, \\alpha) \\frac{db}{d\\alpha} - f(a, \\alpha)\\frac{da}{d\\alpha}. === Alternative Proof of General Form with Variable Limits, using the Chain Rule === The general form of Leibniz's Integral Rule with variable limits can be derived as a consequence of the basic form of Leibniz's Integral Rule, the Multivariable Chain Rule, and the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Suppose f is defined in a rectangle in the x-t plane, for x \\in [x_1, x_2] and t \\in [t_1, t_2] . Also, assume f and the partial derivative \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} are both continuous functions on this rectangle. Suppose a, b are differentiable real valued functions defined on [x_1, x_2], with values in [t_1, t_2] (i.e. for every x \\in [x_1, x_2], a(x) , b(x) \\in [t_1, t_2] ). Now, set : F(x,y) = \\int_{t_1}^{y} f(x,t)\\,dt , for x \\in [x_1, x_2] and y \\in [t_1, t_2] and : G(x) = \\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(x,t)\\,dt , for x \\in [x_1, x_2] Then, by properties of Definite Integrals, we can write : \\begin{align} G(x) &= \\int_{t_1}^{b(x)} f(x,t)\\,dt - \\int_{t_1}^{a(x)} f(x,t)\\,dt \\\\\\ &= F(x, b(x)) - F(x, a(x)) \\end{align} Since the functions F, a, b are all differentiable (see the remark at the end of the proof), by the Multivariable Chain Rule, it follows that G is differentiable, and its derivative is given by the formula: : G'(x) = \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} \\left(x, b(x) \\right) + \\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\left(x, b(x) \\right) b'(x) \\right) - \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} \\left(x, a(x) \\right) + \\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\left(x, a(x) \\right) a'(x) \\right) Now, note that for every x \\in [x_1, x_2] , and for every y \\in [t_1, t_2] , we have that \\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(x, y) = \\int_{t_1}^{y} \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,t) dt , because when taking the partial derivative with respect to x of F , we are keeping y fixed in the expression \\int_{t_1}^{y} f(x,t)\\,dt ; thus the basic form of Leibniz's Integral Rule with constant limits of integration applies. Next, by the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have that \\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x, y) = f(x,y) ; because when taking the partial derivative with respect to y of F , the first variable x is fixed, so the fundamental theorem can indeed be applied. Substituting these results into the equation for G'(x) above gives: : \\begin{align} G'(x) &= \\left(\\int_{t_1}^{b(x)} \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,t) dt + f\\left(x, b(x) \\right) b'(x) \\right) - \\left(\\int_{t_1}^{a(x)} \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,t) dt + f\\left(x, a(x) \\right) a'(x) \\right) \\\\\\ &= f\\left(x,b(x)\\right) b'(x) - f\\left(x,a(x)\\right) a'(x) + \\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,t) dt, \\end{align} as desired. There is a technical point in the proof above which is worth noting: applying the Chain Rule to G requires that F already be Differentiable. This is where we use our assumptions about f . As mentioned above, the partial derivatives of F are given by the formulas \\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(x, y) = \\int_{t_1}^{y} \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,t) dt and \\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x, y) = f(x,y) . Since \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} is continuous, its integral is also a continuous function, and since f is also continuous, these two results show that both the partial derivatives of F are continuous. Since continuity of partial derivatives implies differentiability of the function, F is indeed differentiable. === Three-dimensional, time-dependent form === At time t the surface \u03a3 in Figure 1 contains a set of points arranged about a centroid \\mathbf{C}(t). The function \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}, t) can be written as :\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{C}(t), t) = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{C}(t) +\\mathbf{I}, t), with \\mathbf{I} independent of time. Variables are shifted to a new frame of reference attached to the moving surface, with origin at \\mathbf{C}(t). For a rigidly translating surface, the limits of integration are then independent of time, so: :\\frac {d}{dt} \\left (\\iint_{\\Sigma (t)} d \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\right) = \\iint_\\Sigma d \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{I}} \\cdot \\frac {d}{dt}\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\mathbf{I}, t), where the limits of integration confining the integral to the region \u03a3 no longer are time dependent so differentiation passes through the integration to act on the integrand only: :\\frac {d}{dt}\\mathbf{F}( \\mathbf{C}(t) + \\mathbf{I}, t) = \\mathbf{F}_t(\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\mathbf{I}, t) + \\mathbf{v \\cdot abla F}(\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\mathbf{I}, t) = \\mathbf{F}_t(\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot abla \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}, t), with the velocity of motion of the surface defined by :\\mathbf{v} = \\frac {d}{dt} \\mathbf{C} (t). This equation expresses the material derivative of the field, that is, the derivative with respect to a coordinate system attached to the moving surface. Having found the derivative, variables can be switched back to the original frame of reference. We notice that (see article on curl) : abla \\times \\left(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{F}\\right) = ( abla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{F} \\cdot abla) \\mathbf{v}- ( abla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot abla) \\mathbf{F}, and that Stokes theorem equates the surface integral of the curl over \u03a3 with a line integral over \u2202\u03a3: :\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\iint_{\\Sigma (t)} \\mathbf{F} (\\mathbf{r}, t) \\cdot d \\mathbf{A}\\right) = \\iint_{\\Sigma (t)} \\big(\\mathbf{F}_t (\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\left(\\mathbf{F \\cdot abla} \\right)\\mathbf{v} + \\left( abla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} \\right) \\mathbf{v} - ( abla \\cdot \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{F}\\big)\\cdot d\\mathbf{A} - \\oint_{\\partial \\Sigma (t)}\\left(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{F}\\right)\\cdot d\\mathbf{s}. The sign of the line integral is based on the right-hand rule for the choice of direction of line element ds. To establish this sign, for example, suppose the field F points in the positive z-direction, and the surface \u03a3 is a portion of the xy-plane with perimeter \u2202\u03a3. We adopt the normal to \u03a3 to be in the positive z-direction. Positive traversal of \u2202\u03a3 is then counterclockwise (right-hand rule with thumb along z-axis). Then the integral on the left-hand side determines a positive flux of F through \u03a3. Suppose \u03a3 translates in the positive x-direction at velocity v. An element of the boundary of \u03a3 parallel to the y-axis, say ds, sweeps out an area vt \u00d7 ds in time t. If we integrate around the boundary \u2202\u03a3 in a counterclockwise sense, vt \u00d7 ds points in the negative z-direction on the left side of \u2202\u03a3 (where ds points downward), and in the positive z-direction on the right side of \u2202\u03a3 (where ds points upward), which makes sense because \u03a3 is moving to the right, adding area on the right and losing it on the left. On that basis, the flux of F is increasing on the right of \u2202\u03a3 and decreasing on the left. However, the dot product v \u00d7 F \u2022 ds = \u2212F \u00d7 v \u2022 ds = \u2212F \u2022 v \u00d7 ds. Consequently, the sign of the line integral is taken as negative. If v is a constant, :\\frac {d}{dt} \\iint_{\\Sigma (t)} \\mathbf{F} (\\mathbf{r}, t) \\cdot d \\mathbf{A} = \\iint_{\\Sigma (t)} \\big(\\mathbf{F}_t (\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\left( abla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} \\right) \\mathbf{v}\\big) \\cdot d \\mathbf{A} - \\oint_{\\partial \\Sigma (t)}\\left(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{F}\\right) \\cdot \\,d\\mathbf{s}, which is the quoted result. This proof does not consider the possibility of the surface deforming as it moves. === Alternative derivation === Lemma. One has: :\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} \\left (\\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx \\right ) = f(b), \\qquad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left (\\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx \\right )= -f(a). Proof. From the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus, :\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} \\left (\\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx \\right ) &= \\lim_{\\Delta b \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta b} \\left[ \\int_a^{b+\\Delta b} f(x)\\,dx - \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx \\right] \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\lim_{\\Delta b \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta b} \\int_b^{b+\\Delta b} f(x)\\,dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\lim_{\\Delta b \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta b} \\left[ f(b) \\Delta b + O\\left(\\Delta b^2\\right) \\right] \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= f(b), \\end{align} and :\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left (\\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx \\right )&= \\lim_{\\Delta a \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta a} \\left[ \\int_{a+\\Delta a}^b f(x)\\,dx - \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx \\right] \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\lim_{\\Delta a \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta a} \\int_{a+\\Delta a}^a f(x)\\,dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\lim_{\\Delta a \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta a} \\left[ -f(a) \\Delta a + O\\left(\\Delta a^2\\right) \\right]\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= -f(a). \\end{align} Suppose a and b are constant, and that f(x) involves a parameter \u03b1 which is constant in the integration but may vary to form different integrals. Assume that f(x, \u03b1) is a continuous function of x and \u03b1 in the compact set {(x, \u03b1) : \u03b10 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b11 and a \u2264 x \u2264 b}, and that the partial derivative f\u03b1(x, \u03b1) exists and is continuous. If one defines: :\\varphi(\\alpha) = \\int_a^b f(x,\\alpha)\\,dx, then \\varphi may be differentiated with respect to \u03b1 by differentiating under the integral sign, i.e., :\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\alpha}=\\int_a^b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha}f(x,\\alpha)\\,dx. By the Heine\u2013Cantor theorem it is uniformly continuous in that set. In other words, for any \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u0394\u03b1 such that for all values of x in [a, b], :|f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta \\alpha)-f(x,\\alpha)|<\\varepsilon. On the other hand, :\\begin{align} \\Delta\\varphi &=\\varphi(\\alpha+\\Delta \\alpha)-\\varphi(\\alpha) \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\int_a^b f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx - \\int_a^b f(x,\\alpha)\\, dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\int_a^b \\left (f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)-f(x,\\alpha) \\right )\\,dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &\\leq \\varepsilon (b-a). \\end{align} Hence \u03c6(\u03b1) is a continuous function. Similarly if \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha} f(x,\\alpha) exists and is continuous, then for all \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u0394\u03b1 such that: :\\forall x \\in [a, b], \\quad \\left|\\frac{f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta \\alpha)-f(x,\\alpha)}{\\Delta \\alpha} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\alpha}\\right|<\\varepsilon. Therefore, :\\frac{\\Delta \\varphi}{\\Delta \\alpha}=\\int_a^b\\frac{f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)-f(x,\\alpha)}{\\Delta \\alpha}\\,dx = \\int_a^b \\frac{\\partial f(x,\\alpha)}{\\partial \\alpha}\\,dx + R, where :|R| < \\int_a^b \\varepsilon\\, dx = \\varepsilon(b-a). Now, \u03b5 \u2192 0 as \u0394\u03b1 \u2192 0, so :\\lim_{{\\Delta \\alpha} \\rarr 0}\\frac{\\Delta\\varphi}{\\Delta \\alpha}= \\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\alpha} = \\int_a^b \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} f(x,\\alpha)\\,dx. This is the formula we set out to prove. Now, suppose :\\int_a^b f(x,\\alpha)\\,dx=\\varphi(\\alpha), where a and b are functions of \u03b1 which take increments \u0394a and \u0394b, respectively, when \u03b1 is increased by \u0394\u03b1. Then, :\\begin{align} \\Delta\\varphi &=\\varphi(\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)-\\varphi(\\alpha) \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\int_{a+\\Delta a}^{b+\\Delta b}f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx -\\int_a^b f(x,\\alpha)\\,dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\int_{a+\\Delta a}^af(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx+\\int_a^bf(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx+\\int_b^{b+\\Delta b}f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx -\\int_a^b f(x,\\alpha)\\,dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\int_a^{a+\\Delta a} f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx+\\int_a^b[f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)-f(x,\\alpha)]\\,dx+\\int_b^{b+\\Delta b} f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)\\,dx. \\end{align} A form of the mean value theorem, \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx=(b-a)f(\\xi), where a < \u03be < b, can be applied to the first and last integrals of the formula for \u0394\u03c6 above, resulting in :\\Delta\\varphi=-\\Delta a\\,f(\\xi_1,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)+\\int_a^b[f(x,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha)-f(x,\\alpha)]\\,dx+\\Delta b\\,f(\\xi_2,\\alpha+\\Delta\\alpha). Dividing by \u0394\u03b1, letting \u0394\u03b1 \u2192 0, noticing \u03be1 \u2192 a and \u03be2 \u2192 b and using the above derivation for :\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\alpha} = \\int_a^b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} f(x,\\alpha)\\,dx yields :\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\alpha} = \\int_a^b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} f(x,\\alpha)\\,dx+f(b,\\alpha)\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial \\alpha}-f(a,\\alpha)\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial \\alpha}. This is the general form of the Leibniz integral rule. == Examples == === Example 1: Fixed limits === Consider the function :\\varphi(\\alpha)=\\int_0^1\\frac{\\alpha}{x^2+\\alpha^2}\\,dx. The function under the integral sign is not continuous at the point (x, \u03b1) = (0, 0), and the function \u03c6(\u03b1) has a discontinuity at \u03b1 = 0 because \u03c6(\u03b1) approaches \u00b1\u03c0/2 as \u03b1 \u2192 0\u00b1. If we differentiate \u03c6(\u03b1) with respect to \u03b1 under the integral sign, we get :\\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\varphi(\\alpha)=\\int_0^1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{x^2+\\alpha^2}\\right)\\,dx=\\int_0^1\\frac{x^2-\\alpha^2}{(x^2+\\alpha^2)^2} dx=-\\frac{x}{x^2+\\alpha^2}\\bigg|_0^1=-\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha^2}, which is, of course, true for all values of \u03b1 except \u03b1 = 0. This may be integrated (with respect to \u03b1) to find :\\varphi(\\alpha) = \\begin{cases} 0, & \\alpha = 0, \\\\\\ -\\arctan({\\alpha})+\\frac{\\pi}{2}, & \\alpha eq 0. \\end{cases} === Example 2: Variable limits === An example with variable limits: :\\begin{align} \\frac{d}{dx} \\int_{\\sin x}^{\\cos x} \\cosh t^2\\,dt &= \\cosh\\left(\\cos^2 x\\right) \\frac{d}{dx}(\\cos x) - \\cosh\\left(\\sin^2 x\\right) \\frac{d}{dx} (\\sin x) + \\int_{\\sin x}^{\\cos x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left (\\cosh t^2\\right )dt \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\cosh\\left(\\cos^2 x\\right) (-\\sin x) - \\cosh\\left(\\sin^2 x\\right) (\\cos x) + 0 \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= - \\cosh\\left(\\cos^2 x\\right) \\sin x - \\cosh\\left(\\sin^2 x\\right) \\cos x. \\end{align} == Applications == === Evaluating definite integrals === The formula :\\frac{d}{dx} \\left (\\int\\limits_{a(x)}^{b(x)}f(x,t) dt \\right) = f\\big(x,b(x)\\big)\\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} b(x) - f\\big(x,a(x)\\big)\\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} a(x) + \\int\\limits_{a(x)}^{b(x)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,t) dt can be of use when evaluating certain definite integrals. When used in this context, the Leibniz rule for differentiating under the integral sign is also known as Feynman's trick or technique for integration. ==== Example 3 ==== Consider :\\varphi(\\alpha)=\\int_0^\\pi \\ln \\left (1-2\\alpha\\cos(x)+\\alpha^2 \\right )\\,dx, \\qquad |\\alpha| > 1. Now, :\\begin{align} \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\varphi(\\alpha) &=\\int_0^\\pi \\frac{-2\\cos(x)+2\\alpha }{1-2\\alpha \\cos(x)+\\alpha^2} dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\int_0^\\pi \\left(1-\\frac{1-\\alpha^2}{1-2\\alpha \\cos(x)+\\alpha^2} \\right) dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\left. \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}-\\frac{2}{\\alpha}\\left\\\\{\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1+\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\right) \\right\\\\} \\right|_0^\\pi. \\end{align} As x varies from 0 to \\pi, we have :\\begin{cases} \\frac{1+\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\tan\\left(\\tfrac{x}{2}\\right) \\geq 0, & |\\alpha| < 1, \\\\\\ \\frac{1+\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\tan \\left( \\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\leq 0, & |\\alpha| > 1. \\end{cases} Hence, :\\left. \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1+\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\right)\\right|_0^\\pi= \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\pi}{2}, & |\\alpha| < 1, \\\\\\ -\\frac{\\pi}{2}, & |\\alpha| > 1. \\end{cases} Therefore, :\\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\varphi(\\alpha)= \\begin{cases} 0, & |\\alpha| < 1, \\\\\\ \\frac{2\\pi}{\\alpha}, & |\\alpha| > 1. \\end{cases} Integrating both sides with respect to \\alpha, we get: :\\varphi (\\alpha) = \\begin{cases} C_1, & |\\alpha| < 1, \\\\\\ 2\\pi \\ln |\\alpha| + C_2, & |\\alpha| > 1. \\end{cases} C_{1} = 0 follows from evaluating \\varphi (0): :\\varphi(0) =\\int_0^\\pi \\ln(1)\\,dx =\\int_0^\\pi 0\\,dx=0. To determine C_2 in the same manner, we should need to substitute in a value of \\alpha greater than 1 in \\varphi (\\alpha). This is somewhat inconvenient. Instead, we substitute \\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\beta}, where |\\beta| < 1. Then, :\\begin{align} \\varphi(\\alpha) &=\\int_0^\\pi\\left(\\ln \\left (1-2\\beta \\cos(x)+\\beta^2 \\right )-2\\ln|\\beta|\\right) dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\int_0^\\pi \\ln \\left (1-2\\beta \\cos(x)+\\beta^2 \\right )\\,dx -\\int_0^\\pi 2\\ln|\\beta| dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=0-2\\pi\\ln|\\beta| \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=2\\pi\\ln|\\alpha|. \\end{align} Therefore, C_{2} = 0 The definition of \\varphi (\\alpha) is now complete: :\\varphi (\\alpha) = \\begin{cases} 0, & |\\alpha| < 1, \\\\\\ 2\\pi \\ln |\\alpha|, & |\\alpha| > 1. \\end{cases} The foregoing discussion, of course, does not apply when \\alpha = \\pm 1, since the conditions for differentiability are not met. ==== Example 4 ==== :\\textbf I = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{(a\\cos^2 x +b\\sin^2 x)^2}\\,dx,\\qquad a,b > 0. First we calculate: :\\begin{align} \\textbf{J} &= \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{a\\cos^2 x + b \\sin^2 x} dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 x}}{a + b \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos^2 x}} dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\sec^2 x}{a +b \\tan^2 x} dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\frac{1}{b} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}\\right)^2+\\tan^2 x}\\,d(\\tan x) \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ab}}\\arctan \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{a}}\\tan x\\right) \\Bigg|_0^{\\pi/2} \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{ab}}. \\end{align} The limits of integration being independent of a, we have: :\\frac{\\partial \\textbf J}{\\partial a}=-\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\left(a\\cos^2 x+b \\sin^2 x\\right)^2}\\,dx On the other hand: :\\frac{\\partial \\textbf J}{\\partial a}= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{ab}}\\right) =-\\frac{\\pi}{4\\sqrt{a^3b}}. Equating these two relations then yields :\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\left(a \\cos^2 x+b \\sin^2 x\\right)^2}\\,dx=\\frac{\\pi}{4\\sqrt{a^3b}}. In a similar fashion, pursuing \\frac{\\partial \\textbf J}{\\partial b} yields :\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\left(a\\cos^2 x+b\\sin^2 x\\right)^2}\\,dx = \\frac{\\pi}{4\\sqrt{ab^3}}. Adding the two results then produces :\\textbf I = \\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{1}{\\left(a\\cos^2x+b\\sin^2x\\right)^2}\\,dx=\\frac{\\pi}{4\\sqrt{ab}}\\left(\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\\right), which computes \\textbf I as desired. This derivation may be generalized. Note that if we define :\\textbf I_n = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\left(a\\cos^2 x+b\\sin^2 x\\right)^n}\\,dx, it can easily be shown that :(1-n)\\textbf I_n = \\frac{\\partial\\textbf I_{n-1}}{\\partial a} + \\frac{\\partial \\textbf I_{n-1}}{\\partial b} Given \\textbf{I}_1, this integral reduction formula can be used to compute all of the values of \\textbf{I}_n for n > 1. Integrals like \\mathbf{I} and \\mathbf{J} may also be handled using the Weierstrass substitution. ==== Example 5 ==== Here, we consider the integral :\\textbf I(\\alpha)=\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\ln (1+\\cos\\alpha \\cos x)}{\\cos x}\\,dx, \\qquad 0 < \\alpha < \\pi. Differentiating under the integral with respect to \\alpha, we have :\\begin{align} \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\textbf{I}(\\alpha) &= \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{\\ln(1 + \\cos\\alpha \\cos x)}{\\cos x}\\right) dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{1+\\cos \\alpha \\cos x}\\,dx \\\\\\ &=-\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\left(\\cos^2 \\frac{x}{2}+\\sin^2 \\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\cos \\alpha \\left(\\cos^2 \\frac{x}{2}-\\sin^2 \\frac{x}{2}\\right)} dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{1-\\cos\\alpha} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\cos^2\\frac{x}{2}} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1+\\cos \\alpha}{1-\\cos \\alpha} +\\tan^2 \\frac{x}{2}} dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\frac{2\\sin\\alpha}{1-\\cos\\alpha} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\sec^2 \\frac{x}{2}}{\\frac{2 \\cos^2 \\frac{\\alpha}{2}}{2 \\sin^2\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} + \\tan^2 \\frac{x}{2}} dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\frac{2\\left(2 \\sin \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\cos \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)}{2 \\sin^2 \\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\cot^2\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\tan^2 \\frac{x}{2}} d\\left(\\tan \\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-2\\cot \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\cot^2\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\tan^2\\frac{x}{2}}\\,d\\left(\\tan \\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-2\\arctan \\left(\\tan \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\right) \\bigg|_0^{\\pi/2}\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\alpha. \\end{align} Therefore: :\\textbf{I}(\\alpha) = C - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2}. But \\textbf{I} \\Biggl(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\Biggl) = 0 by definition so C = \\frac{\\pi^2}{8} and :\\textbf I(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{8}-\\frac{\\alpha^2}{2}. ==== Example 6 ==== Here, we consider the integral :\\int_0^{2\\pi}e^{\\cos\\theta} \\cos(\\sin\\theta)\\,d\\theta. We introduce a new variable \u03c6 and rewrite the integral as :f(\\varphi) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{\\varphi\\cos\\theta} \\cos(\\varphi\\sin\\theta)\\,d\\theta. When \u03c6 = 1 this equals the original integral. However, this more general integral may be differentiated with respect to \\varphi: :\\begin{align} \\frac{df}{d\\varphi} &= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\varphi}\\left(e^{\\varphi\\cos\\theta} \\cos(\\varphi\\sin\\theta)\\right)\\,d\\theta \\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{\\varphi\\cos\\theta} (\\cos\\theta\\cos(\\varphi\\sin\\theta)-\\sin\\theta\\sin(\\varphi\\sin\\theta))\\,d\\theta. \\end{align} This is the line integral of F(x,y)=(e^{\\varphi x}\\sin(ty),e^{\\varphi x}\\cos(ty))over the unit circle. By Green's Theorem, it equals the double integral over the unit disk of \\partial F_2/\\partial x-\\partial F_1/\\partial y which equals 0. This implies that f(\u03c6) is constant. The constant may be determined by evaluating f at \\varphi = 0: :f(0) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} 1\\,d\\theta = 2\\pi. Therefore, the original integral also equals 2\\pi. ==== Other problems to solve ==== There are innumerable other integrals that can be solved using the technique of differentiation under the integral sign. For example, in each of the following cases, the original integral may be replaced by a similar integral having a new parameter \\alpha: :\\begin{align} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\,dx &\\to \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\alpha x} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} dx,\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{x}{\\tan x}\\,dx &\\to\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\tan^{-1}(\\alpha \\tan x)}{\\tan x} dx,\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln (1+x^2)}{1+x^2}\\,dx &\\to\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln (1+\\alpha^2 x^2)}{1+x^2} dx \\\\\\\\[6pt] \\int_0^1 \\frac{x-1}{\\ln x}\\,dx &\\to \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^\\alpha-1}{\\ln x} dx. \\end{align} The first integral, the Dirichlet integral, is absolutely convergent for positive \u03b1 but only conditionally convergent when \\alpha = 0. Therefore, differentiation under the integral sign is easy to justify when \\alpha > 0, but proving that the resulting formula remains valid when \\alpha = 0 requires some careful work. === Infinite series === The measure-theoretic version of differentiation under the integral sign also applies to summation (finite or infinite) by interpreting summation as counting measure. An example of an application is the fact that power series are differentiable in their radius of convergence. == In popular culture == Differentiation under the integral sign is mentioned in the late physicist Richard Feynman's best-selling memoir Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! in the chapter \"A Different Box of Tools\". He describes learning it, while in high school, from an old text, Advanced Calculus (1926), by Frederick S. Woods (who was a professor of mathematics in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The technique was not often taught when Feynman later received his formal education in calculus, but using this technique, Feynman was able to solve otherwise difficult integration problems upon his arrival at graduate school at Princeton University: > One thing I never did learn was contour integration. I had learned to do > integrals by various methods shown in a book that my high school physics > teacher Mr. Bader had given me. One day he told me to stay after class. > \"Feynman,\" he said, \"you talk too much and you make too much noise. I know > why. You're bored. So I'm going to give you a book.
