Hajsyn Podolia - died 29 November 1913 Paris) was a Polish landowner, social activist, supporter of the arts and philanthropist. He was awarded the hereditary title of 'count' by the Holy See. His name is associated with the grand palace and grounds in Guz\u00f3w in Masovia, Poland. ==Background== Soba\u0144ski's mother, R\u00f3\u017ca, Siberian Rose He was born into a Polish family of magnates. He was the youngest of four and the only son of Ludwik Soba\u0144ski (1791-1837) and his wife, R\u00f3\u017ca, n\u00e9e \u0141ubie\u0144ska, daughter of Feliks Lubienski and Tekla Teresa Lubienska. His father fell foul of the Russian authorities due to his dissident stance and was sentenced to years of exile in Siberia. His mother, at great personal risk, went to persistent lengths to aid her husband and others similarly banished. She used official means to bring them practical relief sending food parcels and correspondence. When the Russians cut off these supplies, she took to more clandestine methods. This earned her the sobriquet, Siberian Rose. Ludwik Soba\u0144ski's ordeals affected his health; he died at 46 years of age when Feliks was barely four.http://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/ludwik- sobanskihttp://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/roza-rozalia-sobanska-z- lubienskich Feliks' eldest surviving sister, Paulina (b.1824), married Adolf Je\u0142owicki (1809-1891), veteran officer of the November Uprising in Podolia.Borkowski, Genealogie; Drzewo genealogiczne 64-herbowe po mieczu i k\u0105dzieli Soba\u0144skich, \u0141ubie\u0144skich, Je\u0142owickich, Drohojowskich, W. 1912 s. 9\u201310, 47\u20138. Soba\u0144ski attended school in Odessa. He did not go on to university, but travelled instead. While he was staying in Warsaw in 1852 a cholera epidemic broke out. With his kinsman, Ogi\u0144ski, he set up a field hospital and helped to treat the victims. On his return to his home province, he was set to administer the family estates in Obod\u00f3wk\u0105 and Wasyl\u00f3wk\u0105. He was a member of the committee working to abolish Serfdom in Poland, which eventually happened in 1864 in the Russian Partition. ] Emilia, wife of Feliks In 1857 he married Emilia \u0141ubie\u0144ska, a cousin. They had two sons, Micha\u0142 and Kazimierz and a daughter, Wiktoria. From 1857 onwards, having acquired it at auction, he ran the vast 6,000 hectare estate of Guz\u00f3w. It was a sale arising out of the confiscation of his and his wife's uncle Henryk's property due to charges of fraud.Gajewski M., Urz\u0105dzenia komunalne Warszawy, W. 1979; Jaroszewski T. S., Baraniewski W., Pa\u0142ace i dwory w okolicach Warszawy, W. 1992 s. 43 Following the death in 1869 of his relative, Eustachy Je\u0142owicki, another November Uprising veteran, Soba\u0144ski became the legal guardian of his five children.http://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/index.php/a/feliks-hilary-michal-ludwik- sobanskibiogram Feliksa Soba\u0144skiego z Centralnej Biblioteki Rolniczej w Warszawie: http://www.cbr.edu.pl/rme-archiwum/2005/rme8/stronki/2.html ==Career== Peter and Paul Fortress, St. Petersburg Soba\u0144ski (like his father before him) was elected marshal of the nobility for the district of Brac\u0142aw (in present day Ukraine). When in 1862 his colleagues decided at an assembly in Kamieniec Podolski to seek to join the counties of Podolia and Wo\u0142y\u0144 to Congress Poland, he opposed the idea, but was out voted. Representations were therefore despatched to the Russian authorities. As a result, all the marshals were suspended from office, including Soba\u0144ski, and were taken on remand to the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. They were charged with Sedition. He was sentenced by decree of the Russian Senate to exile in the depths of Russia. He was later allowed to move to Odessa and, finally, given leave to return to Podolia. Following his release he travelled to France. While in Paris, he was caught up in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. He arranged with the International Red Cross to hire an ambulance and personally assisted in the removal of the wounded from the battlefield. Between 1872 and 1885 he concentrated on estate and rural matters. He invested huge sums in rebuilding and refashioning the Guz\u00f3w Manor, turning it into a French renaissance-style palace with a park in the English style. He was also concerned with the welfare of rural workers.S\u0142ownik polskich towarzystw naukowych, Wr. 1978 I In 1875, he became a co-founder of the Museum of Industry and Agriculture in Warsaw (whose vice-president he would remain until 1913).Koperska T., \u0141ukomska E., Bibliografia do dziej\u00f3w Muzeum Przemys\u0142u i Rolnictwa za l. 1875\u20131939 That same year, joined the committee of the Warsaw arts academy, the Zach\u0119ta. He ran an architectural competition under its auspices in 1878 to design a parish church for the Mill town of \u017byrard\u00f3w, for which he donated the land.K.

He was involved in the Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko Music Society, which raised funds to aid the impoverished composer. Soba\u0144ski financed an extensive portfolio of church and other buildings and monuments, such as in Radziwi\u0142\u0142\u00f3w, the chapel in Guz\u00f3w, restorations in Obod\u00f3wka and Wiskitki, paying for three marble altars to be brought from Italy for the church of St. Augustine in Warsaw or the restoration of the Sigismund's Column.List Ludwika G\u00f3rskiego do ks.

He also funded travel bursaries for seminarians studying for the priesthood in Warsaw. He was rewarded in 1880 with a hereditary title of nobility from Pope Leo XIII. ==Foundations== Among his other philanthropic projects were: * Headquarters and lodgings in Warsaw of a charity for disabled people, later expanded for: * Single women and a home for orphans * Catholic nursery in Kiev * Cottage hospital in Guz\u00f3w for free treatment for tenant farmers and estate workers * A secondary agricultural school in Obod\u00f3wka, overseen by the local farmers' association * A teacher training college in Ursyn\u00f3w ==Later years== Soba\u0144ski supported financially many social institutions in his homeland as well as in Paris, where there was a substantial Polish diaspora and where he settled for the last dozen years of his life. He participated in the cultural life of the capital and joined the Historical and Literary Society there. His final bounty was to give 100,000 roubles to the Polish rural workers retirement fund and 30,000 roubles to buy potatoes for the rural poor of Galicia suffering a period of famine. He died in Paris 1913 and was buried in the crypt of the church of St. Augustin.\u201eBulletin Polonais Litt\u00e9raire, Scientifique et Artistique\u201d 1913 nr 305 p. 404 His remains were transferred to Obod\u00f3wka in Podolia, shortly after the outbreak of World War I, but border controls prevented his family from abroad attending the interment.biogram Feliksa Soba\u0144skiego z Centralnej Biblioteki Rolniczej w Warszawie: http://www.cbr.edu.pl/rme- archiwum/2005/rme8/stronki/2.html ==See also== * Soba\u0144ski Palace * Feliks \u0141ubie\u0144ski * Th\u00e9odore de Korwin Szymanowski * Great Emigration ==References== ==Gallery== File:Obodowka.jpg|Soba\u0144ski palace in Obod\u00f3wka (Ukraine) File:Guzow palace north cm01.jpg|Guz\u00f3w Palace before restoration File:Wn\u0119trze ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.
