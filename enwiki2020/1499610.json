In 1982 he started working with Paul Weller to form The Style Council which released their first records early in 1983. Since the break-up of the Style Council in March 1990, Talbot has continued to play with Weller on his solo material. He is a member of the current line-up of Dexys (formerly Dexys Midnight Runners). He has also released albums with fellow former Style Council member Steve White, under the name Talbot/White. He has since begun playing alongside White and former Ocean Colour Scene bass guitar player Damon Minchella, in the jazz/funk band The Players. Talbot played keyboards in Galliano, on tour with Gene, and on the 1991 Young Disciples album Road to Freedom. Talbot toured the UK in 2009 with Candi Staton.
