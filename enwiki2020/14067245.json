Then he started towards Patteeswaram. Since the Solar movement was towards the Mituna star causing oppressive heat waves, the child Sambandar could not manage. The Lord sent his bhoodaganas(servants) to decorate the streets with beautiful Muthu pandal(ceiling made of Pearl). The bhoodaganas prepared the pandal (ceiling) without Sambandar's knowledge. Sambandar was astonished by the reverence of God and enjoyed the shade offered. In order that Sambandar has a view of the sanctum sanctorum from outside, Shiva ordered Nandi to shift position. Shiva is revered by the hymns of Sambandar.
