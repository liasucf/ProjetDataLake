    "text": "Borsonella is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Borsoniidae. ==Description== (Original description) The shell has a small, blunt nucleus of one or two whorls. The sculpture is chiefly spiral, feeble, except for one or two spiral carinae, sometimes with a few small riblets or beads on the principal carina. The periostracum is conspicuous, smooth or vermiculate. The siphonal canal is wide and very short. The outer lip is sharp, simple, arcuat. The columella is solid, with one strong, nearly horizontal plait continuous upon the whole axis. This axis is impervious, the operculum absent. Type Borsonia dalli There is never more than one plait in Borsonella ; in Cordieria Rouault, 1848, as restricted by Cossmann, there are never less than two. In Rouaultia the anal sulcus is narrow, sharp, and situated at the shoulder in the peripheral carina. Both Cordieria and typical Borsonia have a long and slender canal and the general aspect of Gemmula Weinkauff, 1875, while Borsonella resembles an Antiplanes Dall, 1902 with a strong plait on the proximal part of the columella.
