Hunter also appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia, Australian Vogue, American and international editions of Elle and Dutch Harper's Bazaar. Hunter posed nude for a cover-featured Playboy pictorial published in April 2004. Hunter is signed to Ford Models in New York, Select Model Management in London, and Chadwick Models in Sydney. ===Acting=== Hunter first appeared on television in 1985 in an advertisement for a New Zealand Ice-Cream brand promoting their \"Trumpet\" ice-cream. Hunter guest starred in a 1997 episode of The Drew Carey Show as herself. She has appeared in several independent films, including 1999's A Walk in the Park and 2000's Two Shades of Blue, an erotic thriller with Marlee Matlin. She stars as a lesbian cook doling out relationship advice in the award-winning indie film La Cucina. She had a brief appearance as a sexy mother in Dennis Dugan's The Benchwarmers (2006) and also played a sultry, bikini-clad mother in the music video for Fountains of Wayne's 2003 song \"Stacy's Mom.\" Hunter appeared on a 2005 celebrity episode of Lingo, where she and her partner Trista Rehn split $US30,000 for charity.

She appeared as a judge on New Zealand's Got Talent from 2012 to 2013. In 2015, Hunter fronted her own television series titled \"Rachel Hunter's Tour of Beauty\" for TV One where she travelled the world to discover what beauty meant in various countries. == Personal life == In the late 1980s Hunter lived with rock musician Kip Winger. Winger stated after their relationship ended that he was left heartbroken when Hunter left him for Rod Stewart. At the age of 21, Hunter met rock star Rod Stewart, 24 years her senior, in a Los Angeles nightclub. They married three months later at the Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church in Beverly Hills, California, on 15 December 1990. Together they have two children: Renee (b. 1992) and Liam (b. 1994). They separated in January 1999 after nine years of marriage, and their divorce was finalised on 2 November 2006. She had a year-long relationship with Canadian NHL ice hockey player Sean Avery in 2004, and in 2006 began a three- year relationship with Jarret Stoll, 13 years her junior, also a Canadian NHL player who played for, and won the Stanley Cup with, the Los Angeles Kings. Her son Liam was a junior player being mentored by him while playing for the LA Kings Juniors when they first met. Stoll proposed to Hunter in 2008 whilst he accompanied her on a trip home to her native New Zealand later that year and they were due to marry on 14 August 2009, but the wedding was called off by Stoll 7 weeks prior to their wedding day. == Filmography == === Film === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Year !Title !Role !Notes |- |1998 |Just a Little Harmless Sex |Marilyn |film debut |- |1999 |Two Shades of Blue |Susan Price | |- |1999 |Winding Roads |Kelly Simons | |- |1999 |A Walk in the Park |Sally's sister | |- |2000 |Tripfall |Gina Williams | |- |2001 |MacArthur Park |Karen | |- |2001 |Pendulum |Amanda Reeve | |- |2001 |Boys Klub |The Goddess | |- |2001 |Rock Star |A.C.'s Wife | |- |2002 |Redemption of the Ghost |Gloria | |- |2003 |Haunted Lighthouse |Rich Widow Feeney |Short film |- |2004 |El padrino |Newscaster | |- |2005 |You and Your Stupid Mate |Karen | |- |2005 |Freezerburn |Holly Hardin | |- |2006 |Final Move |Iris Quarrie | |- |2006 |I.R.A.: King of Nothing |British Intelligence Agent | |- |2006 |The Benchwarmers |Hot Mother | |- |2006 |Ozzie |Beth Morton | |- |2007 |Dead Write |Jade |also Associate Producer |- |2007 |Mexican American |Jacqueline |Direct- to-Video |- |2007 |7-10 Split |Chiropracter | |- |2007 |La cucina |Jude | |- |2009 |Jordon Saffron: Taste This! |Nikki | |- |2010 |The Brazen Bull |Detective Vinyec | |- |2010 |Black Widow |Dr. Laura | |- |2011 |A Matter of Justice |Nicole Ibiza | |- |2013 |The Banksters, Madoff with America |Mimi Mymen | |- |2014 |Soul Mates |Carly | |} === Television === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Year !Title !Role !Notes |- |1991 |Ford Super Model of the World |Herself (host) |Television Special |- |1993 |Boy Meets World |Ms. Miller (voice role) |Episode: \"Bobby Ties the Knot\" |- |1995 |Mad About You |Herself |television debut Episode: \"Just My Dog\" |- |1997 |The Drew Carey Show |Herself |Episode: \"Cap- Beer-Cino\" |- |1999 |Suddenly Susan |Meegan Garrity |Episode: \"Sometimes You Feel Like a Nut\" |- |2000 |Best Actress |Fiona Covington |Television Movie |- |2003 |Cribs |Herself |Episode: \"Rachel Hunter/Shannon Elizabeth/Sam Madison\" |- |2004 |The Vicar of Dibley |Herself |Episode: \"Merry Christmas\" |- |2005 |Larva |Hayley Anderson |Television Movie |- |2005 |Dancing with the Stars |Herself (contestant) |Reality series; 5 episodes |- |2006 |Make Me a Supermodel |Herself |Reality series; 6 episodes |- |2006 |Celebrity Paranormal Project |Herself |Reality series; 8 episodes |- |2008 |The Perfect Assistant |Judith Manion |Television Movie |- |2008 |Confessions of a Go-Go Girl |Donna Mercer |Television Movie |- |2008-2010 |She's Got the Look |Herself (Guest judge) |14 episodes |- |2010 |Gravity |Shawna Rollins |series regular; 10 episodes |- |2010 |10 Things I Hate About You |Herself |Episode: \"Too Much Information\" |- |2011 |Miami Magma |Antoinette Vitrini |Television Movie |- |2012 |Piranhaconda |Talia |Television Movie |- |2012 |New Zealand's Got Talent |Herself |Reality series |- |2012 |RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars |Herself (Guest Judge) |Episode: \"It Takes Two\" |- |2015 |Her Infidelity |Lily Helms |Television Movie |- |2016 |FabLife |Herself (Co-Hostess) |Episode: \"Beauty Secrets Spectacular with Supermodel Rachel Hunter\" |- |2016 |Hollywood Medium |Herself |Episode: \"Corey Feldman/Rachel Hunter/Evelyn Lozada\" |- |2017 |The Women Behind The Women: Behind Steel Dragon |Wife |Television Movie |} === Music videos === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Role !Notes |- |1991 |\"Broken Arrow\" by Rod Stewart |Woman |Directed by Peter Nydrie |- |2003 |\"Stacy's Mom\" by Fountains of Wayne |Stacy's Mom |Directed by Chris Applebaum |} == Dancing with the Stars == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Week # ! rowspan=\"2\" | Dance / Song ! colspan=\"3\" | Judge's scores ! rowspan=\"2\" | Result |- ! style=\"min-width: 4.5em;\" | Inaba ! style=\"min-width: 4.5em;\" | Goodman ! style=\"min-width: 4.5em;\" | Tonioli |- | 1 | Waltz / \"Three Times a Lady\" | 7 | 6 | 7 | No Elimination |- | 2 | Rumba / \"I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\" | 8 | 8 | 8 | Bottom two |- | 3 | Tango / \"Toxic\" | 8 | 9 | 9 | Safe |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 4 | Samba / \"Tequila\" | 7 | 9 | 9 | rowspan=\"2\" | Eliminated |- | Group Viennese Waltz / \"I Got You Babe\" | colspan=\"3\" | No scores given |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand female models Category:New Zealand emigrants to the United States Category:New Zealand film actresses Category:New Zealand television actresses Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:Family of Rod Stewart Category:People from Auckland ",
