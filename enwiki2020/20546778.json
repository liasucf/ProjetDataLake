    "text": "Stones is the debut solo album released by Dan Seals after he parted ways from the duo England Dan & John Ford Coley to pursue a career in country music. It is his only album using the 'England Dan' moniker. Its singles \"Late at Night\", \"Stones (Dig a Little Deeper)\", and \"Love Me Like the Last Time\" failed to chart on the Country, although the 1st one was a minor pop hit, peaking at #57 on the Hot 100. This album was finally released on CD in 2006 on the Wounded Bird label. ==Track listing== # \"Stones (Dig a Little Deeper)\" (Dave Loggins) - 4:40 # \"Late at Night\" (Dan Seals, Rafe Van Hoy) - 3:28 # \"Love Me Like the Last Time\" (Seals, Van Hoy) - 3:52 # \"Getting to the Point\" (Peppi Castro) - 3:52 # \"How Do I Survive\" (Paul Bliss) - 3:50 # \"Holdin' Out For Love\" (Tom Snow, Cynthia Weil) - 3:40 # \"You Could've Been the One\" (John Batdorf, Sue Sheridan) - 3:07 # \"Take You Home\" (Seals, Van Hoy) - 4:31 # \"When It's Over\" (John Ford Coley, Bob Gundry, Seals) - 2:49 # \"Lullaby\" (Seals, Van Hoy) - 3:31 == Personnel == * Dan Seals \u2013 lead vocals, backing vocals (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10), arrangements (3), acoustic guitar (10) * Jon Goin \u2013 electric guitar (1, 7) * Paul Jackson Jr. \u2013 electric guitar (1), guitar (5) * Ray Parker Jr. \u2013 guitar (1, 7) * Steve Lukather \u2013 electric guitar solo (1), lead guitar (3) * Rafe Van Hoy \u2013 gut-string guitar (2, 10), acoustic guitar (3, 8) * Paul Worley \u2013 electric guitar (3) * Richie Zito \u2013 electric guitar (4-8) * Charles Fearing \u2013 guitar (5) * Steve Gibson \u2013 electric guitar (7), guitar (8) * Bobby Thompson \u2013 acoustic guitar (9) * Shane Keister \u2013 synthesizer (1, 5, 7), keyboards (3, 4, 6, 8, 9) * David Foster \u2013 synthesizer (3, 6) * Bill Payne \u2013 acoustic piano (5) * Nathan East \u2013 bass (1, 5, 7) * Bob Wray \u2013 bass (3, 8) * Jack Williams \u2013 bass (4, 9) * Mike Baird \u2013 drums (1, 6, 7) * Larrie Londin \u2013 drums (2, 3, 4, 9) * Ed Greene \u2013 drums (5) * Kenny Buttrey \u2013 drums (8) * Paulinho da Costa \u2013 percussion (1, 5) * Farrell Morris \u2013 percussion (3, 4, 6-9) * Eberhard Ramm \u2013 French horn (4, 9) * Gene Page \u2013 arrangements (1, 5, 6, 7) * Bergen White \u2013 orchestral arrangements (4, 9, 10) * The Shelly Kurland Strings \u2013 strings (4, 9, 10) * Shari Kramer \u2013 backing vocals (1, 4, 6) * Dave Loggins \u2013 backing vocals (1, 4) * Lisa Silver \u2013 backing vocals (1, 6) * Diane Tidwell \u2013 backing vocals (1, 6) * Tom Kelly \u2013 backing vocals (3, 5, 8) * Denny Henson \u2013 backing vocals (7) * Sealatron \u2013 backing vocals (8, 9) === Production === * Producer \u2013 Kyle Lehning * Assistant Producer \u2013 Tony Gottlieb * Engineers \u2013 Tony Gottlieb and Kyle Lehning * Recorded at Larrabee Sound Studios, Producers Workshop and John Thomas Studio (Hollywood, CA); Redwing Studios (Tarzana, CA); Woodland Studios and Creative Workshop (Nashville, TN); Studio By The Pond (Hendersonville, TN). * Mixed by Bill Schnee at Cherokee Studios (Hollywood, CA). * Mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound (New York, NY). * Art Direction \u2013 Bob Defrin * Photography \u2013 Jim Houghton * Management \u2013 Susan Joseph Category:1980 debut albums Category:Dan Seals albums Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:Albums produced by Kyle Lehning ",
