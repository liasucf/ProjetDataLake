Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al, April 6, 2020. ==Critical response== For Le Devoir, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delgado praised Labr\u00e8che-Dor's performance, but wrote that the film overall was riddled with plot holes, most notably the fact that the film's physical and social setting showed virtually no traces of actually having been torn apart by war.J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delgado, \"\u00abLe rire\u00bb: faut-il (en) rire?\". Le Devoir, February 1, 2020. Andr\u00e9 Duchesne offered a similar assessment for La Presse, criticizing the lack of any significant information in the film about an event that would have been far more traumatic to society than was evident in the screenplay. He also noted that a key scene in the film, a soliloquy by the long-term care centre's human resources director, was so similar to a scene in Denys Arcand's 2003 film The Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions barbares) that he hoped, but did not know for sure, that the scene was intended as a deliberate homage. ==Accolades== The film received two Prix Iris nominations at the 22nd Quebec Cinema Awards: {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) and nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| Prix Iris | rowspan=\"2\" | 2020 | Best Actress | L\u00e9ane Labr\u00e8che-Dor | | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | Best Supporting Actress | Micheline Lanct\u00f4t | |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2020 films Category:2020 drama films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama films Category:French- language films Category:Films set in Quebec Category:Films shot in Quebec Category:Films directed by Martin Laroche ",
