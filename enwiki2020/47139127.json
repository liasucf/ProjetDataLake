    "text": "Steve Hurst (born c. 1948) is an American politician. He is a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from the 35th District, serving since 1998. He is a member of the Republican party. Hurst put forward a bill that, if approved, would require sex offenders who are 21 years of age or older, and committed a sexual offense against a child 12 years of age or younger, to undergo permanent surgical castration before being released from custody. According to Sputnik, \"only 7 states allow voluntary chemical castration as a replacement to imprisonment of those convicted of sexual offenses, and Texas is the only state that currently allows certain repeat offenders to elect surgical castration.\" ==References== Category:Living people Category:Members of the Alabama House of Representatives Category:Alabama Republicans Category:1940s births Category:21st-century American politicians ",
