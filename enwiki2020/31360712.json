    "text": "Convergence in sustainability sciences refers to mechanisms and pathways that lead towards sustainability with a specific focus on 'Equity within biological planetary limits'. These pathways and mechanisms explicitly advocate equity and recognise the need for redistribution of the Earth's resources in order for human society to operate enduringly within the Earth's biophysical limits. This use of the term 'convergence' harkens from the concept of contraction and convergence (C&C;), taking its core principles of Equity and Survival and applying them beyond the frame of greenhouse gas emissions to the wider sustainability agenda. ==References== ==External links== *The CONVERGE project website Category:Sustainability Category:Environmental terminology Category:Environmental social science concepts ",
