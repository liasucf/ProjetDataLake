The first text, entitled O tysta ensamhet (translated: Oh Silent Solitude), was written by Olof von Dalin. The second text, entitled Visa fr\u00e5n Utanmyra, was written by Bj\u00f6rn Lindroth. Lindroth's text is perhaps the best-known version today. Utanmyra is a sm\u00e5ort village located in Soller\u00f6n, Dalarna, Sweden. The song has been played in a jazz context and interpreted by several artists, including Arne Domn\u00e9rus, Monica Zetterlund, Wintergatan and Jan Johansson. Johansson's version was featured on his seminal 1964 album Jazz p\u00e5 svenska. Jan Johansson's version of the song was used in Svenska f\u00f6r Nyb\u00f6rjare (Swedish for Beginners), a recurring sketch on the TV program Hipphipp!. Swedish folktronica band Wintergatan covered the song in 2014. ==References== Category:Swedish folk music ",
