On 2 April, he performed during the London Eurovision Party, which was held at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris venue in London, United Kingdom and hosted by Nicki French. Between 3 and 6 April, Bengtsson took part in promotional activities in Tel Aviv, Israel where he performed during the Israel Calling event held at the Ha'teatron venue. On 8 April, Robin Bengtsson performed during the Eurovision in Concert event which was held at the Melkweg venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by Cornald Maas and Selma Bj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir. On 15 April, Bengtsson performed during the Eurovision Spain Pre-Party, which was held at the Sala La Riviera venue in Madrid, Spain. == At Eurovision == Robin Bengtsson during the opening ceremony of Eurovision 2017 According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big 5\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 31 January 2017, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Sweden was placed into the first semi- final, to be held on 9 May 2017, and was scheduled to perform in the first half of the show. Once all the competing songs for the 2017 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Sweden was set to open the show and perform in position 1, before the entry from Georgia. The two semi-finals and the final were televised in Sweden on SVT1 with commentary by M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w and Edward af Sill\u00e9n. The Swedish spokesperson, who announced the top 12-point score awarded by the Swedish jury during the final, was Wiktoria Johansson. ===Semi- final=== Robin Bengtsson took part in technical rehearsals on 30 April and 4 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 8 and 9 May. This included the jury show on 8 May where the professional juries of each country watched and voted on the competing entries. At the end of the show, Sweden was announced as having finished in the top 10 and subsequently qualifying for the grand final. It was later revealed that Sweden placed third in the semi-final, receiving a total of 227 points: 103 points from the televoting and 124 points from the juries. ===Final=== Shortly after the second semi-final, a winners' press conference was held for the ten qualifying countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists took part in a draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the reverse order the countries appeared in the semi-final running order. Sweden was drawn to compete in the second half. Following this draw, the shows' producers decided upon the running order of the final, as they had done for the semi-finals. Sweden was subsequently placed to perform in position 24, following the entry from Belgium and before the entry from Bulgaria. ===Voting=== Below is a breakdown of points awarded to Sweden and awarded by Sweden in the first semi-final and grand final of the contest, and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the two shows: ====Points awarded to Sweden==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"5\"| Points awarded to Sweden (Semi-final 1) |- !colspan=\"5\"| Televote |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * * |- !colspan=\"5\"| Jury |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"5\"| Points awarded to Sweden (final) |- !colspan=\"5\"| Televote |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * * * * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * * * |- !colspan=\"5\"| Jury |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * * * * * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * |- |} ====Points awarded by Sweden==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=3|Semi-final 1 |- !Score !Televote !Jury |- | bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| || |- | bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| || |- | bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| || |- |7 points|| || |- |6 points|| || |- |5 points|| || |- |4 points|| || |- |3 points|| || |- |2 points|| || |- |1 point|| || |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=3|Final |- !Score !Televote !Jury |- | bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| || |- | bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| || |- | bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| || |- |7 points|| || |- |6 points|| || |- |5 points|| || |- |4 points|| || |- |3 points|| || |- |2 points|| || |- |1 point|| || |- |} ====Split voting results==== The following five members comprised the Swedish jury: * Michael Cederberg \u2013 Chairperson \u2013 music editor * Wiktoria Johansson (Wiktoria) \u2013 artist * Maria Lundin \u2013 music producer, composer * Gustav Efraimsson \u2013 music producer, composer * Andreas Johnson \u2013 singer-songwriter {| class=\"sortable wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !colspan=11| Split voting results from Sweden (Semi-final 1) |- !rowspan=\"2\"| Draw !rowspan=\"2\"| Country !colspan=\"7\"| Jury !colspan=\"2\"| Televote |- ! ! ! ! ! !
