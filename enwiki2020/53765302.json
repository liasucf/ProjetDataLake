    "text": "BPM (Beats per Minute), also known as 120 BPM (Beats per Minute), () is a 2017 French drama film directed by Robin Campillo and starring Nahuel P\u00e9rez Biscayart, Arnaud Valois and Ad\u00e8le Haenel. The film is about homosexuality and the AIDS activism of ACT UP Paris in 1990s France. Campillo and co- screenwriter Philippe Mangeot drew on their personal experiences with ACT UP in developing the story. It had its world premiere at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, followed by screenings at other festivals. At Cannes it won critical acclaim and four awards, including the Grand Prix. It went on to win six C\u00e9sar Awards, including Best Film, and other honours. ==Plot== In the early 1990s, a group of HIV/AIDS activists associated with the Paris chapter of ACT UP struggle to effect action to fight the AIDS epidemic. While the French government has declared its intent to support HIV/AIDS sufferers, ACT UP stages public protests against their sluggish pace, accusing the government of censoring and minimizing the fight against the virus. When the pharmaceutical company Melton Pharm announces its plans to reveal its HIV trial results at a prominent pharmaceutical conference the following year, ACT UP invades its offices with fake blood and demands it release its trial results immediately. While ACT UP makes some headway with its public protests, its members fiercely debate the group's strategy, with conflicting goals of showmanship and persuasion, with conflicting aesthetics of positivity and misery. ACT UP struggles to plan a more effective Gay Pride parade than in previous years, bemoaning the depressing, \"zombie\" atmosphere the AIDS epidemic had created. The film gradually shifts from the political storyline of ACT UP's actions to the personal stories of ACT UP members. Foreshadowing later events in the movie, Jeremie, an HIV-positive youth in the group sees his health deteriorate rapidly. Per his wishes, the group parades in the streets after his death, putting his name and face to the ranks of AIDS victims. A gay, HIV-negative newcomer, Nathan, begins to fall in love with the passionate HIV-positive veteran Sean. Nathan and Sean start a sexual relationship, but Sean is already exhibiting signs of the disease's progression. Nathan cares for Sean as they both discuss their sexual histories. When Sean is released to Nathan's apartment for hospice, Nathan euthanizes him, and ACT UP holds a wake at his home. As per Sean's wishes, they invade a health insurance conference, sprinkling his ashes over the conference-goers and their food. ==Cast== ==Production== Director Robin Campillo co-wrote the screenplay, describing himself as \"an ACT UP militant in the '90s\", meaning he did not have to carry out any other investigation into how to accurately portray the experience. One scene was also based on his experience with the AIDS epidemic, as he said \"I've dressed up a boyfriend on his death\". Co-screenwriter Philippe Mangeot was also involved in ACT UP. At Cannes, Campillo explained his decision to go ahead with directing the film, saying \"BPM is above all a film I wanted to make where the force of words transforms into pure moments of action\". The budget of $5 million was raised in months. ==Release== Director Robin Campillo and his cast attend the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. The film had its world premiere at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival on 20 May 2017. On 24 June, it went to the Moscow International Film Festival, followed by the New Zealand International Film Festival in July. With the number of films at the Toronto International Film Festival being reduced from 2016, BPM (Beats per Minute) was nevertheless selected for the 2017 festival in September. At Cannes, The Orchard acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. It has been released in France on 23 August 2017 as scheduled. === Incidents === On 4 February 2018, a group of Christian protesters holding icons and singing church chants disrupted the screening of BPM at the Romanian Peasant Museum in Bucharest. Displaying banners with nationalist and Christian messages, the protesters claimed that \"a film with this plot is inadmissible to be screened\" at the Romanian Peasant Museum, because \"it is a film about homosexuals\", and \"the Romanian peasant is Orthodox Christian.\" After half an hour of dispute, the police took the protesters out of the cinema. The screening of BPM was part of a series of events dedicated to LGBT History Month. Director Tudor Giurgiu, a supporter of LGBT rights and witness to what happened, criticized in a Facebook post such demonstrations and asked for protection measures in cinema halls where LGBT-themed films are screened. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== On the French review aggregator AlloCin\u00e9, the film has an average review score of 4.5 out of 5 based on 31 critics, making it the highest rated film of the year. It holds a 98% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 107 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Moving without resorting to melodrama, BPM offers an engrossing look at a pivotal period in history that lingers long after the closing credits roll.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 84 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Jada Yuan, writing for Vulture.com, spoke of being moved to tears by the film, praising it as \"a unique, intimate portrait of the community from the inside\". The Toronto Star's Peter Howell observed French critics at Cannes were generally excited about it and opined it deserved a top award. The Hollywood Reporter critic David Rooney positively reviewed the dialogue and the youthful cast, while criticizing the pace. Tim Robey, writing for The Daily Telegraph, gave it three of five stars, complimenting the comedic moments and a sex scene, balancing awareness of risk, with one character being HIV positive, and sexiness. Vanity Fair critic Richard Lawson hailed it as a \"half sober and surveying docudrama, half wrenching personal illness narrative\". Lawson and The Hollywood Reporter critics compared the film to the play The Normal Heart by Larry Kramer. ===Accolades=== It competed for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. In July 2017, it was listed among 10 films in competition for the Lux Prize. It was selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"|Award ! scope=\"col\"|Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"|Category ! scope=\"col\"|Recipient(s) ! scope=\"col\"|Result !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Cabourg Film Festival |rowspan=1|18 June 2017 | Audience Award |rowspan=5|Robin Campillo | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=1| |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=4| Cannes Film Festival |rowspan=4|17\u201428 March 2017 | Grand Prix | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=1| |- | FIPRESCI Prize | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=1| |- | Fran\u00e7ois Chalais Prize | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2| |- | Queer Palm | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=13| C\u00e9sar Awards | rowspan=\"13\" | 2 March 2018 | Best Film | Hugues Charbonneau, Marie-Ange Luciani, Robin Campillo | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"13\" | |- | Best Director |rowspan=2| Robin Campillo | |- | Best Original Screenplay | |- | Best Supporting Actor | Antoine Reinartz | |- | Best Supporting Actress | Adele Haenel | |- |rowspan=2| Most Promising Actor | Nahuel P\u00e9rez Biscayart | |- | Arnaud Valois | |- | Best Original Music | Arnaud Rebotini | |- | Best Sound |Julien Sicart, Valerie de Loof, Jean-Pierre Laforce | |- | Best Editing | Robin Campillo | |- | Best Cinematography | Jeanne Lapoirie | |- | Best Costume Design | Isabelle Pannetier | |- | Best Production Design | Emmanuelle Duplay | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Chicago International Film Festival |rowspan=1|October 2017 | Gold Q-Hugo |rowspan=2| Robin Campillo | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=1| |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=3| European Film Awards | rowspan=\"3\" | 9 December 2017 | Best Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\" | |- | Best Actor | Nahuel P\u00e9rez Biscayart | |- | Best Editor |rowspan=2| Robin Campillo | |style=\"text- align:center;\" | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| Globes de Cristal Awards |rowspan=2| 12 February 2018 | Best Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2| |- | Best Actor | Nahuel P\u00e9rez Biscayart | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Guldbagge Awards | 22 January 2018 | Best Foreign Film |rowspan=2| Robin Campillo | |style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| International Film Festival of India | rowspan=2| 28 November 2017 | Best Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2| |- | Best Actor | Nahuel P\u00e9rez Biscayart | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Independent Spirit Awards | 3 March 2018 | Best International Film |rowspan=5| Robin Campillo | |style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Los Angeles Film Critics Association | rowspan=\"1\" | 3 December 2017 | Best Foreign Language Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lux Prize |rowspan=1|14 November 2017 | Best Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=1| |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=6| Lumi\u00e8res Awards |rowspan=6| 5 February 2018 | Best Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=6| |- | Best Director | |- | Best Actor | Nahuel P\u00e9rez Biscayart | |- | Best Screenplay | Robin Campillo and Philippe Mangeot | |- | Most Promising Actor | Arnaud Valois | |- | Best Music | Arnaud Rebotini | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Merlinka Festival | 13 December 2017 |Best Queer Film of the Year |rowspan=8| Robin Campillo | |style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| National Society of Film Critics | rowspan=\"1\" | 6 January 2018 | Best Foreign Language Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| New York Film Critics Circle | 3 January 2018 | Best Foreign Language Film | |style=\"text- align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Online Film Critics Society | rowspan=\"1\" | 28 December 2017 | Best Foreign Language Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| San Sebastian Film Festival |September 2017 |Sebastiane Award | |style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Satellite Awards | 11 February 2018 | Best Foreign Language Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Vancouver Film Critics Circle | rowspan=\"1\" | December 2017 | Best Foreign Language Film | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Washington D.C.
