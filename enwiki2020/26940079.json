The first publisher of the project was the deputy CEO of Rossiyskaya Gazeta Eugene Abov. ===2016=== * On January 9, 2016, RBTH became part of TV-Novosti whilst retaining its own distinct brand. ===2017=== * In 2017 the project dropped all printed versions. * On 5 September 2017, RBTH dropped the last two words of its full name, becoming Russia Beyond. == Structure == Russia Beyond is managed by a section of the state-operated domestic Russian-language news agency TV-Novosti, a daughter company of the Rossiya Segodnya. == Reception == Russia Beyond was accused of being propaganda by The Guardian commentator Roy Greenslade in 2014 and former Slate journalist Jack Shafer in 2007. In Europe, the Russian-state media entity paid London's Daily Telegraph, Le Figaro in France, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in Germany and the Italian daily La Repubblica to be distributed as an insert to those publications, and in the United States it partnered with The Washington Post until 2015; The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times were bundling the insert into their regular editions as of 2018. In the case of Britain's Daily Telegraph, the Kremlin-backed Beyond the Headlines paid the British publisher \u00a340,000 each month to be distributed as a supplement to its weekend publication, whilst the Telegraph website also featured content from RBTH's website. The monthly Russia-themed supplement first appeared in the British paper The Daily Telegraph and the American Washington Post in 2007 under the name Russia Now. == See also == * Russia Insider * Media of Russia == References == Category:Newspapers published in Russia Category:Companies based in Moscow Category:International newspapers Category:Publications established in 2007 Category:Asian news websites Category:European news websites ",
