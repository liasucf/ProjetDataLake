As there was no state provision for the poor, mutual aid organisations known as friendly societies were established to help families against hardship brought about illness or death. Such societies began as locally based groups, whose members contributed a small amount each month so that payouts could be made to those in need, with the rest of the money received either saved or invested. Shepherds Friendly started life as a sickness and benefits society, Ashton Unity, which was formed in Ashton-under- Lyne, Lancashire on Christmas Day in 1826. It was later renamed as the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds, \"loyal\" referring to the Crown and \"shepherds\" to the Nativity of Jesus. Its objects were \"to relieve the sick, bury the dead, and assist each other in all cases of unavoidable distress, so far as in our power lies, and for the promotion of peace and goodwill towards the human race\". It later spread across the country, organised into local branches; like other friendly societies such as the Oddfellows, these were known as 'lodges', and officers wore regalia somewhat similar to those of freemasons. By 1914 the membership had grown to 143,000. The Ancient Shepherds raised substantial funds from its members to support charities, presenting two lifeboats to the RNLI in the 1800s, and supported the Red Cross and YMCA in the Second World War.Friendly societies , Scottish Records AssociationVictoria Solt-Dennis, Discovering Friendly and Fraternal Societies, Shire Publications, 2005. .
