    "text": "Rachel Bean is a cosmologist and theoretical astrophysicist. She is a professor of astronomy at Cornell University. == Education == Bean received her bachelor\u2019s degree (Natural Sciences) from Cambridge University (1995). After graduation, she worked in the Strategy Division at Accenture before returning to academia. She received her master\u2019s (1999) and doctorate (2002) in theoretical physics from Imperial College London. She did postdoctoral research at Princeton University, before becoming a faculty member at Cornell University in 2005. == Research == Bean\u2019s research focuses on cosmological tests of the nature of dark energy and gravity, and the physical origins of primordial inflation, using data from large-scale structure and the cosmic microwave background. She is actively involved in a number of international astronomical surveys including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and the Euclid mission. == Awards == * 2018 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics (for the results of the WMAP mission) * 2016 Fellow, American Physical Society * 2012 Gruber Prize in Cosmology, for the results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission * 2010 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) * 2008 Cottrell Scholar Award, Research Corporation. * 2007 NASA Group Achievement Award (for the results of the WMAP mission) ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:American women astronomers Category:Cornell University faculty Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Alumni of Imperial College London ",
