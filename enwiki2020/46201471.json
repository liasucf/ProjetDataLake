It was famous and popular in Hong Kong during the 1960s and 1970s.\u767e\u5bb6\u5eca\uff1a\u5225\u77e3\uff0c\u9999\u6e2f\u8857\u908a\u5927\u6392\u6a94, \u9999\u6e2f\u6587\u532f\u5831(2008\u5e741\u67086\u65e5) The literal meaning of dai pai dong in English is \u201cBig license stall\u201d. The characteristics of Dai Pai Dong are lack of air- conditioners, unclean environment but various kinds of food.http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-wine/article/1556158/dai-pai-dong- endangered-species-hong-kong Dai Pai Dong Endangered Species in Hong Kong, South China Morning Post, (21 July 2014) However, starting from 1980s, the government stopped issuing new licenses and began buying them back. Due to its hygienic problem and the deaths of the license holders, dai pai dong closed down and was replaced by different kinds of restaurant. There are only 25 dai pai dong left in Hong Kong, according to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which manages the licenses. Nevertheless, because of voices about preserving local food culture, it is suggested that licenses should be issued again to the vendors and the dai pai dong owners.(Chinese)https://hk.news.yahoo.com/\u5c0f\u8ca9\u518d\u767c\u724c\u9808\u5730\u5340\u652f\u6301-221114515.html \u5c0f\u8ca9\u518d\u767c\u724c\u9808\u5730\u5340\u652f\u6301, \u661f\u5cf6\u65e5\u5831(2015\u5e742\u670826\u65e5)(Chinese)http://www.881903.com/Page/ZH- TW/newsdetail.aspx?ItemId=782608&csid;=261_341 \u98df\u885b\u5c40\u5efa\u8b70\u7c3d\u767c\u65b0\u5c0f\u8ca9\u53ca\u5927\u6392\u6a94\u724c\u7167, \u5546\u696d\u96fb\u53f0(2015\u5e743\u67082\u65e5) Besides, there are several changes of dai pai dong due to the urban development. == Background == Dai Pai Dong were popular among working class due to its cheap price in the 1950s and they earned the nickname \u201cpoor people\u2019s nightclub\u201d. However, the rise of hygiene and traffic congestion complaints forced the government to stop issuing \u201cbig licenses\u201d in 1956 and limited their transfer due to black market of selling licenses. The licensees could only transfer the licenses to their spouses upon their death, not even their children. If the licensees did not have a spouse, the license would expire.(Chinese)\u8857\u908a\u6709\u6a94\u5927\u724c\u6a94 \u838a\u7389\u60dc\u8457 \u9999\u6e2f\uff1a\u4e09\u806f\u66f8\u5e97 (\u9999\u6e2f) 2011 In 1975, with the opening of the first cooked food center, a lot of dai pai dong moved into these center and markets for easy control. In 1983, the government began to buy back licenses from the holders to improve public hygiene. Since the licenses could not be transferred, many aged license holders chose to sell their licenses to the government. The number of dai pai dong in Hong Kong dropped significantly. There were 68 dai pai dong in Kowloon City. But now there is none. Now, there are only 25 dai pai dong remaining in Hong Kong: 11 in Sham Shui Po, 10 in Central, three in Wan Chai and one in Tai O. Only a few of them are still on the streets in the traditional style. Nevertheless, while the traditional food stalls, which represent Hong Kong local food culture, closed down one by one because of urban development, there are voices suggesting preserving dai pai dong.(Chinese) http://paper.wenweipo.com/2005/07/31/HK0507310045.htm \u6c11\u5712\u9eb5\u5bb6\u550f\u5653\u8072\u4e2d\u7d50\u696d, \u6587\u532f\u5831(2005\u5e747\u670831\u65e5) At the same time, it is to preserve Hong Kong people collective memories. == Controversy == In 2005, the closing down of several local food stalls like Man Yuen Noodles has raised voices of preserving local food culture, including dai pai dong. About preserving dai pai dong, there are both agreeing and disagreeing. For the Agree side: === Food and Health Bureau === Preserving dai pai dongs and vendors helps Hong Kong to promote tourism, protect local culture, create job opportunities as well as alleviate proverty. Should the government finalises the decision of preserving local food culture, the Bureau will coordinate with the government. === Hong Kong citizens=== Not only do dai pai dongs represent Hong Kong traditional food culture, but also people\u2019s collective memory. The relationships between customers and stalls\u2019 owners are close and friendly.(Chinese) http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1032080 \u4e03\u5341\u5e74\u54c1\u8cea\u5805\u6301\u4e0d\u6575\u91cd\u5efa \u9b5a\u86cb\u7c89\u8001\u5e97\u52e2\u7d50\u696d, \u9999\u6e2f\u7368\u7acb\u5a92\u9ad4(2015\u5e743\u67085\u65e5) dai pai dong is one of the places connecting them. === Dai Pai Dongs owners === Dai Pai Dongs represent Hong Kong food culture.
