    "text": "The Shadow of the Sun (, literally \"Ebony\") is a travel memoir by the Polish writer and journalist Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski. It was published in 1998 and by Penguin Books in 2001 with the English translation by Klara Glowczewska. Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski spent nearly 30 years in various African countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, Nigeria, Ethiopia and more, detailing his accounts as a white, foreign visitor, of the development of the African states. Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's experience in Africa was unique, because he had the opportunity to stay with people of various classes in society, staying with ministers, as well as peasants in rural villages which gave him an honest perspective on what was the current situation of the continent.John Ryle (2001), \"At play in the bush of ghosts\" originally published as the \u201cTales of Mythical Africa\u201d by the Times Literary Supplement, 27 July 2001.
