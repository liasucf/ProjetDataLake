Fight of the Living Dead: Live-Action Video Game, which was produced before BlackBoxTV's partnership with YouTube Premium debuted on April 5, 2015, was a six episode pre-season, totaling under one hour combined. It starred Jesse Wellens, Meghan Camarena, Iman Crosson, Joey Graceffa, Justine Ezarik, Jeana Smith, Jarrett Sleeper, Sam Pepper and Olga Kay. Pre-Youtube Premium season one, titled Fight of the Living Dead, premiered on April 5, 2015. The first season, titled Fight of the Living Dead: Experiment 88, premiered on August 17, 2016. The second season, titled Fight of the Living Dead: Paradise Calls, premiered on October 31, 2017. == Premise == Very well known YouTubers are thrown into an experiment by an organization known as CONOP Who developed a biological weapon that reanimates the dead and transforms them into zombies. The experiment places them in an area where zombies known to be present. They must fight for their lives by completing different missions together to Survive a 72-hour period in said area. Each episode chronicles the events that transpire in the 72 hours. During their stay they meet up with several characters with unknown purposes and intent. == Missions == In each episode, CONOP instructs 1 or more Subjects via a Communications Room or through a radio whilst out of base to complete Missions which could potentially lead to those nominated facing the Zombies and risking death. The Subjects either decide as a group or are nominated by CONOP to venture out of the safe house. A mission is deemed complete if the primary objective is fulfilled. == Contestants == ===Live-Action Video Game=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Name !Age !Channel !Entered !Eliminated |- |Jesse Wellens |32 | Jesse |Episode 1 |Survivor (1st place) |- |Meghan Camarena |27 | Strawburry17 |Episode 2 |Episode 6 (2nd place) |- |Iman Crosson |33 | Alphacat |Episode 2 |Episode 6 (3rd place) |- |Joey Graceffa |23 | Joey Graceffa |Episode 1 |Episode 6 (4th place) |- |Justine Ezarik |31 | iJustine |Episode 1 |Episode 5 (5th place) |- |Jeana Smith |32 | Jen Smith |Episode 2 |Episode 5 (6th place) |- |Jarrett Sleeper |29 | Jarrett Sleeper |Episode 3 |Episode 4 (7th place) |- |Sam Pepper |26 | Sam |Episode 2 |Episode 2 (8th place) |- |Olga Kay |32 | Olga Kay |Episode 1 |Episode 1 (9th place) |} === Experiment 88 === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Name !Age !Channel !Eliminated |- |Rahat Hossain |26 | MagicofRahat |Survivor (1st place) |- |JC Caylen |23 | Jc Caylen |Survivor (1st place) (revived) |- |Tr\u00e9 Melvin |23 | Tr\u00e9 Melvin |Episode 7 (3rd place) |- |Brandon Bowen |18 | Brandon Bowen (Vine) |Episode 7 (4th place) |- |Raya Moab |23 | Raya |Episode 7 (5th place) |- |Yousef Erakat |26 | fouseyTUBE |Episode 6 (6th place) (revived) |- |Vitaly Zdorovetskiy |24 | VitalyzdTv |Episode 4 (7th place) |- |Shanna Malcolm |34 | Shanna Malcolm |Episode 3 (8th place) |- |Dennis Roady |33 | howtoPRANKitup |Episode 2 (9th place) |- |Brittani Louise Taylor |32 | Brittani Louise Taylor |Episode 1 (10th place) |- |} ==Progress Charts== ===Live-Action Video Game=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=\"8\" |Progress Chart |- !
