    "text": "The 1903 British Columbia general election was the tenth general election for the Province of British Columbia, Canada. It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. The election was called on September 5, 1903, and held on October 3, 1903. The new legislature met for the first time on November 26, 1903. This was the first election in British Columbia that was fought by political parties. Prior to this election, British Columbia politics were non-partisan. The first election was dominated by the Conservative and Liberal parties, which were affiliated with existing parties at the federal level. See Conservative Party of Canada and Liberal Party of Canada. The Conservative Party won over 46.4% of the popular vote and a slim majority of the seats in the legislature. ==Results by party== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"1\"|Seats !colspan=\"2\"|Popular vote |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |Conservative 1 |align=\"center\"|Richard McBride |align=\"right\"|41 |align=\"right\"|22 |align=\"right\"|27,913 |align=\"right\"| 46.43% |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|10 |align=\"right\"|2 |align=\"right\"|4,787 |align=\"right\"| 7.96% |Labour 2 |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|5 |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|4,421 |align=\"right\"| 7.36% |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|284 |align=\"right\"| 0.47% |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"|95 !align=\"right\"|42 !align=\"right\"|60,120 !align=\"right\"|100% |- | align=\"center\" colspan=\"7\"|Sources: Elections BC |- |} Notes: * Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election. 1 The Conservative Party and the Liberal Party each elected one candidate by acclamation. 2 There was no provincial \"Labour Party\" as such. Each of the three Electoral Districts with a Labour candidate (Nanaimo, Slocan, and Vancouver City) had a local, autonomous Labour Party. As well, some Liberal candidates appear to have run on a \"Liberal-Labour\" platform (Atlin, Victoria and Ymir). ==Results by riding== |- || |align=\"center\"|Henry Esson Young |align=\"center\" |Atlin Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Alberni Liberal |align=\"center\"|William Wallace Burns McInnes || |- || |align=\"center\"|Robert Grant |align=\"center\" |Comox Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Cariboo Liberal |align=\"center\"|Harry Jones || |- || |align=\"center\"|Richard McBride1 |align=\"center\" |Dewdney Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Cariboo Liberal |align=\"center\"|James Murphy || |- || |align=\"center\"|Charles Edward Pooley |align=\"center\" |Esquimalt Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Chilliwhack Liberal |align=\"center\"|Charles William Munro || |- || |align=\"center\"|William Roderick Ross |align=\"center\" |Fernie Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Columbia Liberal |align=\"center\"|Wilmer Cleveland Wells || |- || |align=\"center\"|George Arthur Fraser |align=\"center\" |Grand Forks Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Cowichan Liberal |align=\"center\"|John Newell Evans || |- || |align=\"center\"|Frederick John Fulton |align=\"center\" |Kamloops Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Cranbrook Liberal |align=\"center\"|James Horace King || |- || |align=\"center\"|Robert Francis Green |align=\"center\" |Kaslo Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Delta Liberal |align=\"center\"|John Oliver || |- || |align=\"center\"|John Houston |align=\"center\" |Nelson City Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Greenwood Liberal |align=\"center\"|John Robert Brown || |- || |align=\"center\"|Thomas Gifford |align=\"center\" |New Westminster City Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |The Islands Liberal |align=\"center\"|Thomas Wilson Paterson || |- || |align=\"center\"|Price Ellison |align=\"center\" |Okanagan Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Rossland City Liberal |align=\"center\"|James Alexander MacDonald2 || |- || |align=\"center\"|Thomas Taylor |align=\"center\" |Revelstoke Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Saanich Liberal |align=\"center\"|Henry Ernest Tanner || |- || |align=\"center\"|Francis Lovett Carter-Cotton |align=\"center\" |Richmond Conservative || || |align=\"center\" rowspan=4 |Victoria City Liberal |align=\"center\"|William George Cameron || |- || |align=\"center\"|Lytton Wilmot Shatford |align=\"center\" |Similkameen Conservative || || |align=\"center\"|Robert Low Drury || |- || |align=\"center\"|Charles William Digby Clifford |align=\"center\" |Skeena Conservative || || |align=\"center\"|Richard Hall || |- || |align=\"center\"|Charles William John Bowser |align=\"center\" rowspan=5 |Vancouver City Conservative || || |align=\"center\"|James Dugald McNiven || |- || |align=\"center\"|James Ford Garden || || |align=\"center\" |Yale Liberal |align=\"center\"|Stuart Alexander Henderson || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|Alexander Henry Boswell MacGowan || || |align=\"center\" |Nanaimo City Socialist |align=\"center\"|James Hurst Hawthornthwaite || |- || |align=\"center\"|Robert Garnett Tatlow || || |align=\"center\" |Newcastle Socialist |align=\"center\"|Parker Williams || |- || |align=\"center\"|Charles Wilson || || |align=\"center\" |Slocan Labour |align=\"center\"|William Davidson || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|Harry Wright |align=\"center\" |Ymir Conservative || | |align=\"center\" | |align=\"center\"| |- | |align=\"center\"|1 Premier-Elect |- | | |align=\"center\"|2 Leader of the Opposition |- | align=\"center\" colspan=\"10\"|Source: Elections BC |- |} ==See also== *List of British Columbia political parties ==Further reading & references== *In the Sea of Sterile Mountains: The Chinese in British Columbia, Joseph Morton, J.J.
