The line was not yet opened when the Ch\u014dsen Southern Railway merged with five other privately owned railways to create the Ch\u014dsen Railway on 1 September 1923;Establishment of the Chosen Railway, Dong-A Ilbo, 3 September 1923 (in Korean) it was only three months after the merger, on 1 December 1923, that the first section, from Masan to Gunbuk, was opened, under the name Gyeongnam Line. The remaining section to Jinju was opened on 15 June 1925. On 1 April 1931, the state-owned Ch\u014dsen Government Railway bought the Gyeongnam Line, merging it with its own Masan Line to create the Gyeongjeon Nambu Line running from Samnangjin to Jinju. ==Route== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- |+ \u6176\u5357\u7dda - \uacbd\ub0a8\uc120 - Keinan Line - Gyeongnam Line |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Distance !! colspan=\"4\" | Station name !! colspan=\"3\" | |- !
