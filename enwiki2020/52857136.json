    "text": "Pe\u010dovnik Mine is a defunct coal mine near Pe\u010dovnik, Slovenia. It is infamous as a mass grave and crime scene where Yugoslav Partisans killed 12,000 Croats by forcing them into the mine and covering them with concrete in 1945.Domagoj Mad\u017ear. \"Pe\u010dovnik Mine - where over 12,000 Croats were buried alive in concrete\", dnevno.hr, 19 February 2016; accessdate 1 May 2016. During World War II, the mine worked under the direction of Germans. After the defeat of Third Reich in 1945, Yugoslav partisans captured the mine. Shortly afterward, Josip Broz Tito ordered the Yugoslav Army to close it, although the local community argued that mine still had plenty of coal and was not ready to be closed. Before the mine was closed with concrete on 8-9 May 1945, partisans forced 12,000 Croats to enter it, including 2,000 women and children. The next day, the partisans closed the mine, leaving them underground to die from choking, dehydration, or hunger.Roman Leljak, \"In Pe\u010dovnik Minse was killed 12.000 Croats, [including 2.000 women and children\"], komunistickizlocini.net, 24 February 2016; accessed 1 May 2016 Some local Slovenes were arrested and prosecuted for reportedly giving testimony about the Pe\u010dovnik and Matja\u017eeva pits to international journalists.Janez \u010crnej, ognji\u0161\u0107e.si \"Witness of the horrible yugoslav crime against Croats in Pe\u010dovnik Mine\", oddaje.ognjisce.si, 23 January 2016; accessed 2 May 2016.
