    "text": "Buzay Abbey, dedicated to Our Lady, was a Cistercian Abbey at Rouans in Pays de la Loire, France, formerly in Brittany, founded in 1135 and dissolved in 1790. ==History== Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, founder Bernard of Clairvaux founded the abbey at Buzay in 1135, at the request of Ermengarde of Anjou, widow of Alan IV, Duke of Brittany, and mother of Conan III, Duke of Brittany.Pierre-Hyacinthe Morice, Histoire ecclesiastique et civile de Bretagne (1756), p. cxxxix (in French) The next year, in 1136, the first community of a dozen monks settled on the site of the new abbey with Nivard, a younger brother of Bernard de Clairvaux, as their prior.Arlette Lebigre, \u201cLes d\u00e9buts de l\u2019abbaye cistercienne de Buzay en pays de Rais, 1144-1250\u201d, in Revue historique de droit fran\u00e7ais et \u00e9tranger, Issue 3, July\u2013September 1967, pp. 451-482Abbaye de Buzay at infobretagne.com, accessed 27 April 2020 Bernard himself came for the dedication of the new foundation, accompanied by Geoffroy de L\u00e8ves, Bishop of Chartres, as they were travelling together on a visit to Parthenay to meet William X, Duke of Aquitaine.Anatole Bordot, Litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise, Origines (1866), p. 121 Around 1143, Bernard of Clairvaux came from Champagne to visit Buzay, but found its abbey in a state of great poverty and neglect. Conan III had not honoured his promises of support, and Bernard asked the monks to return to Clairvaux, but first he met Conan III, who admitted his fault and gave the monks everything he had denied them. They then decided to stay. The abbey became rich, thanks to the salt trade,A. R. Bridbury, England and the Salt Trade in the Later Middle Ages (Clarendon Press, 1955), p. 71 commercial traffic on the River Loire, and many gifts of land and other property. In 1177, Robert II, bishop of Nantes, approved the addition of a convent for nuns. In 1180, Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Nantes, a son of Henry II of England, Duke of Normandy, and of Eleanor of Aquitaine, assigned to the abbey in perpetuity twenty livres to be paid by the mills of the surrounding parish. The vaulted cellars of the Abbey survive Chartres Cathedral With effect from 1474, commendatory abbots were appointed by the duke or king, replacing the regular abbots elected locally. During the War in the Vend\u00e9e (March \u2013 December 1793), following the French Revolution, Buzay Abbey was destroyed by fire. What now remains of the buildings is a tower which had been rebuilt in the 18th century, and some vaulted cellars. Other survivals are the bells, which were transferred to Chartres cathedral, an Italian marble altar, which was moved to the church of Saint-Louis in Paimb\u0153uf, a pulpit, now in the church of St Peter in Bouguenais, and some other objects, including the oldest crucifix in the Pays de Retz, dating from the fourteenth century, in the chapel of St Anne of Tharon at Saint-Michel- Chef-Chef. ==Daughter houses== Villeneuve Abbey, in an engraving of 1695 From Buzay, three new Cistercian abbeys were instituted as daughter houses. On 1 July 1172, Buzay sent a few monks to the small \u00cele du Pilier, north of Noirmoutier. However, the small windswept island posed so many problems for the new community that in 1205 the monks fell back on the island of Noirmoutier and founded the abbey of Our Lady the White. On 25 March 1200, at the request of Constance, Duchess of Brittany, monks were sent for the founding of her new Villeneuve Abbey,Morice (1756), pp. cliii\u2013cliv (in French) on land belonging to Buzay, located on the Ognon, a river flowing into the lake of Grand-Lieu, near the Ch\u00e2tellenie of Touffou and the village of Bignon. The monks would help to drain the surrounding marshes, with advice from engineers of the Poitevin marshes, and would also help to dig a canal between Messan and the Loire. In 1259, Buzay was prosperous enough to establish Pri\u00e8res Abbey, at the request of John I, Duke of Brittany, and the Cistercian Order. ==List of Abbots== Charles de Lorraine, abbot 1552\u20131564 Henri de Gondi, abbot 1598\u20131622 Fran\u00e7ois Lefebvre de Caumartin, abbot 1675\u20131733 Louis de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9, abbot 1733\u20131737 ===Regular=== * 1144 : Pierre I * 1150\u20131153 : Guillaume I * 1155 : Adam * 1170 : Pierre II * 1175 : Geoffroi * 1177 : Richard * 1187 : Menno * 1199 : Guillaume II Robert * 1203 : Gaultier * 1206 : \u00c9gide I * 1206 : Raoul * 1232 : Richard II * 1236 : Mathieu * 1237 : Barth\u00e9lemy * 1244 : \u00c9gide II * 1268 : Robert * 1270 : Samson * 1276 : Daniel * 1310 : Henri I * 1317 : Jean I * 1325 : Jean II de Mez * 1359 : Henri II * 1377 : Louis * 1384 : Guillaume III Mar\u00e9chal * 1417 : Jean III Gendron * 1453 : Pierre Villageys * 1454\u20131471 : Humbert Boulay ===Commendatory=== * 1474\u20131492 : Odet de la Rivi\u00e8re * 1492 : Pierre III Gigan * 1494\u20131512 : Jean IV Bohier * 1519 : Jean V * 1524\u20131543 : Louis Tissart * 1552 : Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine * 1564 : Henri III Clausse * 1576 : Pierre IV de Gondi * 1598\u20131622 : Henri IV Cardinal de Gondi * 1622\u20131654 : Jean VI Fran\u00e7ois de Gondi * 1654\u20131675 : Jean Fran\u00e7ois Paul de Gondi, Cardinal de Retz * 1675\u20131733 : Jean VII Fran\u00e7ois Paul Lefebvre de Caumartin * 1733\u20131737 : Louis de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9, Count of Clermont * 1737 : Pierre V Augustin Bernardin de Rosset de Fleury * 1789\u20131790 : Jean Georges Lefranc de PompignanUlysse Chevalier, Notice chronologico-historique sur les archev\u00eaques de Vienne (1879), p. 18: \u201cJean VII Georges Le Franc de Pompignan, \u00e9v\u00eaque du Puy, lui succ\u00e9da... il se d\u00e9mit alors de son si\u00e9ge et re\u00e7ut l'abbaye de Buzay; il mourut le 29 d\u00e9cembre 1790\u201d == Notes== ==Links== *LA TOUR DE BUZAY at pornic.com Category:Cistercian monasteries in France Category:1130s establishments in France Category:1790 disestablishments in France Category:Former Christian monasteries in France Category:Monuments historiques of Pays de la Loire Category:Monasteries dissolved during the French Revolution Category:Destroyed Christian monasteries ",
