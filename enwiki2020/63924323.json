    "text": "This is a list of current NCAA Division I FBS radio broadcasters for both football and men's basketball. Traditionally, a radio broadcaster announces every game, or almost every game, for the team they cover, earning the distinction of being called the \"voice\" of that team. Most major colleges, as noted below, use the same announcer to serve as the voice of both their football and men's basketball teams. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ 2020 Division I FBS play-by-play broadcasters ! ! ! ! colspan=\"2\" |Football Voice ! colspan=\"2\" |Men's Basketball Voice |- !School !Nickname !Football Conference !Name !1st year !Name !1st year |- |Cincinnati |Bearcats |American (East) |Dan Hoard |2000 |Dan Hoard |2000 |- |Central Florida |Knights |American (East) |Marc Daniels | |Marc Daniels | |- |Temple |Owls |American (East) |Harry Donahue |1984 |Harry Donahue |2002 |- |South Florida |Bulls |American (East) |Jim Louk |1997 |Jim Lighthall |2007 |- |East Carolina |Pirates |American (East) |Jeff Charles |1988 |Jeff Charles |1988 |- |UConn |Huskies |American (East) |Mike Crispino |2018 |Mike Crispino |2018 |- |Memphis |Tigers |American (West) |Dave Woloshin |1997 |Dave Woloshin |1997 |- |Navy |Midshipmen |American (West) |Pete Medhurst |2013 |Pete Medhurst |2008 |- |SMU |Mustangs |American (West) |Rich Phillips |2001 |Rich Phillips |2001 |- |Tulane |Green Wave |American (West) |Andrew Allegretta |2019 |Andrew Allegretta |2019 |- |Houston |Cougars |American (West) |Kevin Eschenfelder |2013 |Jeremy Branham |2016 |- |Tulsa |Golden Hurricane |American (West) |Bruce Howard |1995 |Bruce Howard |1995 |- |Clemson |Tigers |ACC (Atlantic) |Don Munson |2014 |Don Munson |2017 |- |Louisville |Cardinals |ACC (Atlantic) |Paul Rogers |1992 |Paul Rogers |1995 |- |Wake Forest |Demon Deacons |ACC (Atlantic) |Stan Cotten |1996 |Stan Cotten |1996 |- |Florida State |Seminoles |ACC (Atlantic) |Gene Deckerhoff |1979 |Gene Deckerhoff |1974 |- |Boston College |Eagles |ACC (Atlantic) |Jon Meterparel |2005 |Josh Maurer |2018 |- |Syracuse |Orange |ACC (Atlantic) |Matt Park |2004 |Matt Park |2004 |- |NC State |Wolfpack |ACC (Atlantic) |Gary Hahn |1992 |Gary Hahn |1992 |- |Virginia |Cavaliers |ACC (Coastal) |Dave Koehn |2008 |Dave Koehn |2008 |- |Virginia Tech |Hokies |ACC (Coastal) |Jon Laaser |2015 |Jon Laaser |2015 |- |Miami |Hurricanes |ACC (Coastal) |Joe Zagacki |2002 |Joe Zagacki |2002 |- |Pittsburgh |Panthers |ACC (Coastal) |Bill Hillgrove |1974 |Bill Hillgrove |1970 |- |North Carolina |Tar Heels |ACC (Coastal) |Jones Angell |2011 |Jones Angell |2011 |- |Duke |Blue Devils |ACC (Coastal) |David Shumate |2017 |David Shumate |2017 |- |Georgia Tech |Yellow Jackets |ACC (Coastal) |Andy Demetra |2016 |Andy Demetra |2016 |- |Oklahoma |Sooners |Big 12 |Toby Rowland |2011 |Toby Rowland |2011 |- |Baylor |Bears |Big 12 |John Morris |1995 |John Morris |1995 |- |Texas |Longhorns |Big 12 |Craig Way |2001 |Craig Way |2001 |- |Oklahoma State |Cowboys |Big 12 |Dave Hunziker |2001 |Dave Hunziker |2001 |- |Kansas State |Wildcats |Big 12 |Wyatt Thompson |2002 |Wyatt Thompson |2002 |- |Iowa State |Cyclones |Big 12 |John Walters |2003 |John Walters |2003 |- |West Virginia |Mountaineers |Big 12 |Tony Caridi |1997 |Tony Caridi |1997 |- |TCU |Horned Frogs |Big 12 |Brian Estridge |1998 |Brian Estridge |1998 |- |Texas Tech |Red Raiders |Big 12 |Brian Jensen |2000 |Geoff Haxton |2016 |- |Kansas |Jayhawks |Big 12 |Brian Hanni |2016 |Brian Hanni |2016 |- |Ohio State |Buckeyes |Big Ten |Paul Keels |1998 |Paul Keels |1998 |- |Penn State |Nittany Lions |Big Ten |Steve Jones |2000 |Steve Jones |1982 |- |Michigan |Wolverines |Big Ten |Jim Brandstatter |2014 |Brian Boesch |2019 |- |Indiana |Hoosiers |Big Ten |Don Fischer |1974 |Don Fischer |1974 |- |Michigan State |Spartans |Big Ten |George Blaha | |Will Tieman |1999 |- |Maryland |Terrapins |Big Ten |Johnny Holiday |1979 |Johnny Holiday |1979 |- |Rutgers |Scarlet Knights |Big Ten |Chris Carlin |2004 |Jerry Recco |2016 |- |Wisconsin |Badgers |Big Ten |Matt Lepay |1994 |Matt Lepay |1988 |- |Minnesota |Golden Gophers |Big Ten |Mike Grimm |2011 |Mike Grimm |2006 |- |Iowa |Hawkeyes |Big Ten |Gary Dolphin |1997 |Gary Dolphin |1996 |- |Illinois |Fighting Illini |Big Ten |Brian Barnhart |2002 |Brian Barnhart |2002 |- |Purdue |Boilermakers |Big Ten |Tim Newton |2010 |Larry Clisby |1977 |- |Nebraska |Cornhuskers |Big Ten |Greg Sharpe |2008 |Kent Pavelka |2006 |- |Northwestern |Wildcats |Big Ten |Dave Eanet |1990 |Dave Eanet |1996 |- |Florida Atlantic |Owls |Conference USA (East) |Ken LaVicka |2009 |Ken LaVicka |2009 |- |Marshall |Thundering Herd |Conference USA (East) |Steve Cotton |1996 |Steve Cotton |1996 |- |Western Kentucky |Hilltoppers |Conference USA (East) |Randy Lee |2007 |Randy Lee |2007 |- |Charlotte |49ers |Conference USA (East) |Matthew Swierad |2013 |Matthew Swierad |2001 |- |Middle Tennessee |Blue Raiders |Conference USA (East) |Chip Walters |2009 |Chip Walters |2009 |- |Florida International |Panthers |Conference USA (East) |A.J.
