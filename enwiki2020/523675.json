    "text": "Ali Kemal Sunal (10 November 1944 - 3 July 2000) was a Turkish actor. With Hababam S\u0131n\u0131f\u0131, Kap\u0131c\u0131lar Kral\u0131 and Davaro, Sunal gained large popularity amongst Turkish cinema goers and was famed for his character \"\u015eaban\", a role he frequently played. == Career == Kemal Sunal graduated from Vefa Lisesi (Vefa High School). In his early ages, he started pursuing what was to become a long and successful acting career in minor roles in various theatres. For a brief period, he worked in the Kenterler Theatre and debuted in the play Zoraki Tabip. He was later transferred to the Deveku\u015fu Kabare Theatre, where he performed his acting. He was recognized as a real talent, and started receiving offers for movies with larger budgets and a more famous cast. His first bigger role was in the film \"Tatl\u0131 Dillim\" directed by Ertem E\u011filmez. In a matter of years, Sunal co-starred alongside Halit Ak\u00e7atepe, \u015eener \u015een and M\u00fcnir \u00d6zkul. Perhaps the most famous of all his parts was when he played in Hababam S\u0131n\u0131f\u0131 (The Outrageous Class) and was known by the name of \"\u015eaban\", but most of his classmates just called him \u0130nek (cow) \u015eaban. \u0130nek \u015eaban was constantly bullied and humiliated by his friends, but this never kept him from thinking the unthinkable, like digging a tunnel to escape school grounds (which later, turned out to lead to the vice-principal\u2019s office) or smoking in the school attic. The character was so pure and so fixed in the memories of the Turkish people, it was never replaced by another actor in the recent re- shootings of Hababam S\u0131n\u0131f\u0131, most probably as a sign of respect to Sunal. His other notable characters include: Tosun Pasha; S\u00fct Karde\u015f \u015eaban; \u00c7\u00f6p\u00e7\u00fcler Kral\u0131, who fell in love with a municipality officer\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; Doktor Civan\u0131m, a former hospital janitor pretending to be a doctor upon his return to his home village; and finally \"Orta Direk \u015eaban\", a naive man trying to become an athlete to impress his crush. The huge popularity of his movies stemmed not only from their unique humour but also their depiction of the many problems faced by the poor rural people in Turkey during the 1970s and 1980s. In almost all of his films, Kemal Sunal plays a poor man, trying to make a living. Sunal\u2019s last film was Propaganda, which was directed by Sinan \u00c7etin. Sunal, played a customs officer-in-charge (presumably) on the Syrian border. Being a serious drama, this film was a contrast to his other works. As the plot unfolded, Sunal\u2019s character fell into despair, trying to survive the dilemma between his duties as an officer of the law and his duties as a friend. In the public opinion, this film was not the best of his works. Another significant fact about this film is that it also included Ali Sunal, Kemal Sunal\u2019s son, cast as a junior customs officer. == Personal life == Sunal kept himself and his family away from the media and rarely appeared in public. People who knew him have commented on how serious he was in his real life, in contrast to the funny characters he played in his movies. Whilst he was at the top of his career, he decided to finish university, which he had dropped out of in his early career. Despite his fame, he attended the university like a regular student and stated that \"that was the way he liked it to be\". Sunal's dreams of higher-education were disrupted in 1980, during the period of military takeover. His attempts to earn a degree finally paid off in 1995, when he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in Radio Television and Cinema Studies from Marmara University. He then decided to pursue a master\u2019s degree (the topic of this thesis being himself), which he earned in 1998, also from Marmara University. This incident was covered by the media with headlines like \"\u0130nek \u015eaban Master Yapt\u0131\" (\u015eaban the Geek got a master's degree) while his 'classmates' from Hababam Sinifi made comments like \"Profesorluk Bekliyoruz\" (\"We expect full professorship\"). At his graduation ceremony, he made a speech joking that his path of first working and then attending university later in life was better as it allowed him to gain real life experience first. ==Death== Kemal Sunal died on July 3, 2000, as a result of a sudden heart attack aboard a flight to Trabzon just before take-off. He was reported to be afraid of flying. His death caused mourning that swept the entire nation and dominated news coverage for many days. He was interred at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery in Istanbul. Kemal Sunal and his wife G\u00fcl Sunal (born 1957) had two children, Ali Sunal (born 1977) and Ezo Sunal (born 1984). == Filmography == === Film === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Film ! Role !
