    "text": "This is a list of Native American actors in the United States, including Alaskan Natives and Native Americans who reside in the lower forty-eight states. Native American identity is a complex and contested issue rooted in political sovereignty that pre-dates the creation of colonial nation states like the U.S. and Canada and persists into the 21st century recognized under international law by treaty. The Bureau of Indian Affairs defines Native American as having American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry. Legally, being Native American is defined as being enrolled in a federally recognized tribe or Alaskan village. Ethnologically, factors such as culture, history, language, religion, and familial kinships can influence Native American identity.\"IV. Our Nation\u2019s American Indian and Alaska Native Citizens.\" US Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs. Retrieved 8 July 2012. All individuals on this list should have Native American ancestry. Historical figures might predate tribal enrollment practices and would be included based on ethnological tribal membership, while any contemporary individuals should either be enrolled members of federally recognized tribes or have cited Native American ancestry and be recognized as being Native American by their respective tribes(s). Contemporary unenrolled individuals are listed as being of descent from a tribe. == A == *Victor Aaron, Yaqui *Yalitza Aparicio, Mixtec-Triqui ==B== *Irene Bedard, Inuit, Creehttps://people.com/archive/irene-bedard-vol-43-no-18/ *Chief John Big Tree, Seneca *Moses Brings Plenty, Oglala Lakota \"Moses Brings Plenty is a Lakota born at Pine Ridge reservation.
