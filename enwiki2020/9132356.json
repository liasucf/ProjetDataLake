    "text": "|} The Cleeve Hurdle is a Grade 2 National Hunt hurdle race in Great Britain which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run on the New Course at Cheltenham over a distance of about 3 miles (2 miles 7 furlongs and 213 yards, or 4,822 metres), and during its running there are twelve hurdles to be jumped. The race is scheduled to take place each year in January. The race was first run in 1983 over a distance of 2 miles 5 furlongs and 110 yards. In the late 1980s the event was classed at Listed level, and its full title was the Bishops Cleeve Hurdle. It was promoted to Grade 1 status in 1991, and in the following years its title was shortened to the present form. It was downgraded to Grade 2 status in 2004, and its distance was extended to the present length in 2005. In its analysis of that year's running, the Racing Post commented that the modified Cleeve Hurdle was \"effectively replacing the long-distance hurdle formerly run at Haydock on Peter Marsh day.\" The race is now a leading trial for the Stayers' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! width=\"36px\" | Year ! width=\"160px\" | Winner ! width=\"40px\" | Age ! width=\"180px\" | Jockey ! width=\"180px\" | Trainer |- |1983||Al Kuwait||7||John Francome||Fred Winter |- |1984||Buckbe||5||Colin Brown||David Elsworth |- |1985||Rose Ravine||6||R Pusey||Fulke Walwyn |- |1986||Stans Pride||9||Ronnie Beggan||G Price |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1987Abandoned because of frost |- | 1988 | Cloughtaney | 7 | Tony Mullins | Paddy Mullins |- | 1989 | Calapaez | 5 | Simon Sherwood | Brooke Sanders |- | 1990 | Beech Road | 8 | Richard Guest | Toby Balding |- | 1991 | Crystal Spirit | 4 | Jimmy Frost | Ian Balding |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1992| Abandoned because of frost |- | 1993 | Muse | 6 | Paul Holley | David Elsworth |- | 1994 | Flakey Dove | 8 | Richard Dunwoody | Richard Price |- | 1995 | Mudahim | 9 | Norman Williamson | Chris Broad |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1996| Abandoned because of frost |- | 1997 | Large Action | 9 | Jamie Osborne | Oliver Sherwood |- | 1998 | Mistinguett | 6 | Carl Llewellyn | Nigel Twiston-Davies |- | 1999 | Lady Rebecca | 7 | Norman Williamson | Venetia Williams |- | 2000 | Lady Rebecca | 8 | Norman Williamson | Venetia Williams |- | 2001 | Lady Rebecca | 9 | Norman Williamson | Venetia Williams |- | 2002 | Kates Charm | 9 | Mick Fitzgerald | Robert Alner |- | 2003 | Classified | 7 | |Tony McCoy | Martin Pipe |- | 2004 | Crystal d'Ainay | 5 | Jimmy McCarthy | Alan King |- | 2005 | Patriarch Express | 8 | Jim Culloty | Sue Smith |- | 2006 | Fire Dragon | 5 | Tony McCoy | Jonjo O'Neill |- | 2007 | Blazing Bailey | 5 | Robert Thornton | Alan King |- | 2008 | Inglis Drever | 9 | Richard Johnson | Howard Johnson |- | 2009 | Big Buck's | 6 | Ruby Walsh | Paul Nicholls |- | 2010 | Tidal Bay | 9 | Brian Hughes | Howard Johnson |- | 2011 | Grands Crus | 6 | Tom Scudamore | David Pipe |- | 2012 | Big Buck's | 9 | Ruby Walsh | Paul Nicholls |- | 2013 | Reve De Sivola | 9 | Richard Johnson | Nick Williams |- | 2014 | Knockara Beau | 11 | Jan Faltejsek | George Charlton |- | 2015 | Saphir Du Rheu | 6 | Sam Twiston-Davies | Paul Nicholls |- | 2016 | Thistlecrack | 8 | Tom Scudamore | Colin Tizzard |- | 2017 | Unowhatimeanharry | 9 | Barry Geraghty | Harry Fry |- | 2018 | Agrapart | 7 | Lizzie Kelly | Nick Williams |- | 2019 | Paisley Park | 7 | Aidan Coleman | Emma Lavelle |- | 2020 | Paisley Park | 8 | Aidan Coleman | Emma Lavelle |} ==See also== * Horse racing in Great Britain * List of British National Hunt races ==References== * Racing Post: ** , , , , , , , , , ** , , , , , , , , , ** , , , , , , , , * * pedigreequery.com \u2013 Cleeve Hurdle \u2013 Cheltenham. ==External links== * Race Recordings Category:National Hunt races in Great Britain Category:Cheltenham Racecourse Category:National Hunt hurdle races Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1983 Category:1983 establishments in England ",
