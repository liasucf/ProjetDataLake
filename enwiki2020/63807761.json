    "text": "Paparajotes are a typical dessert of Murcia, SpainEl paparajote se cuela entre las Siete Maravillas Gastron\u00f3micas. La Opini\u00f3n de Murcia made with lemon leaves coated with a dough made with flour and egg that are fried and sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon. == History == They were introduced by the Arabs in Murcia and were made in peasant homes. The Murcians made it daily and took it after each meal, accompanying it with puchero coffee or caf\u00e9 de olla, all cooked with firewood. Its main ingredients are: flour, egg, milk, and lemon leaves. Even today the origin of the name remains a mystery. == Preparation == To make them, lemon leaves are taken from the local orchards to be used in the production of the dish. The leaves should be light green (young), and neither too soft or too hard. Once a leaf is chosen, it is coated with dough and fried. Yeast is used in the dough to cause the dough to rise and coat the leaf. == Consumption == Today, it is the typical dish of the spring festivities in Murcia (Bando de la Huerta) together with the fritters, dessert that is traditionally eaten on the day of San Jos\u00e9 and Matasuegras, some fried biscuits stuffed with pastry cream or chocolate. The leaf is not supposed to be eaten, it serves as a vessal for the dough to be eaten off of. === Stalls === Both in the spring festivities and during the Feria de Septiembra de Murcia, many Murcians put up stalls, which provide food to festival attendees. These stalls are located in places assigned by the relevant town hall, and it is there that people can enjoy the paparajotes, one of the symbols and hallmark of the Region of Murcia. == Paparajotes totaneros == Totana paparajotes are not sweet, but salty. They are a mixture of mashed chickpeas (previously cooked with cod), eggs, cod, garlic and parsley. This mixture is then collected with a spoon and fried at the same time in a frying pan with the oil very hot. It is customary to cook them at Easter and add them to a stew made of chickpeas and potatoes. == References == == External links == * P\u00e1gina oficial de la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia donde se explica la elaboraci\u00f3n de los paparajotes * Lo mejor de la gastronom\u00eda * La receta tradicional *San Jose *Bando de la Huerta Category:Desserts ",
