It is one of the six cities (along with Lepreum, Phrixae, Macistus, Epium, and Nudium) founded by the Minyans in the territory of the Paroreatae and Caucones. Herodotus comments that, in his time, most of the cities founded by the Minyans were ravaged by the Eleans. It is supposed that this happened around 460 BCE, after the Third Messenian War. Polybius reports that it was among the towns of Triphylia that decided to ally with Philip V of Macedon in the Social War (219 BCE), after he took Samicum. Its site is located at Agios Elias near modern Pyrgos, Elis, although other locations have been proposed. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Elis Category:Triphylia Category:Former populated places in Greece ",
