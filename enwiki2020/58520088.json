It is the company's first electric mass production car, and was first delivered in May 2019. It has an EPA range of , or in the updated model.https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33526095/2021-audi-etron-price-drop/ A Sportback variant, with of EPA range, entered production in early 2020.https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/brussels-belgium-203 == History == The Audi e-tron is based on the e-tron quattro concept that was unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. The final production version was revealed in San Francisco on 17 September 2018, and it publicly debuted at the 2018 Paris Motor Show. The car's certification in Germany by the KBA (Federal Motor Transport Authority) was not obtained until required changes were made to the car's software. In January 2019, United States market deliveries were due to commence in June. The first customer in Germany received his e-tron in March 2019, in late April 2019 it was reported that prospective customers faced waiting lists of 6\u20137 months (putting the expected delivery date close to the end of 2019). The delays caused controversy in Norway, where customers were informed that their cars would be delivered up to 6 months later than originally promised unless they paid extra for a significantly more expensive \"Fast Track\" car. Further to this, some customers were also informed that were they to cancel their reservation they would be liable for a fine equal to 8% of the purchase price. Both in Germany and in the United States, hundreds of e-trons were registered before the first publicized delivery to a customer in the respective area occurred, which suggests they performed the role of test vehicles of some sort. In June 2019 Audi of America claimed there are 1,644 e-trons in the United States and 540 of these are in the hands of customers. During the first three quarters of 2019, there were 3,540 registrations of the e-tron in the United States, 3,824 in Norway, 2,997 in Germany, and 706 in the Netherlands. In Norway, the e-tron was the best-selling car or truck of any kind in October 2019. In November 2019, it ranked #3. In the Netherlands, the e-tron was the #2 most registered car of any kind in December 2019.Data as of December 28, 2019. Audi paused production of the e-tron in February 2020 due to supply chain problems including issues with adequate supply of batteries for the e-tron. Production resumed in May 2020.https://www.audi- mediacenter.com/en/photos/detail/with-social-distancing-and-masks-production- of-the-audi-e-tron-sportback-in-brussels-resumed-at-the-beginning-of-may- while-following-strict-protective-measures-92246 ==Specifications== e-tron 55 Quattro The Audi e-tron is powered by a 95 kWh battery pack of which 83.6 kWh is usable. It is able to get an 80% charge in around 30 minutes when using 150 kW DC fast-chargers. For at-home charging in the EU, there is a standard 11 kW charger which charges it in 8.5 hours, while an optional 22 kW charger halves this time. In the US, a 40A 9.6kW J1772 charger is used instead. A liquid cooling system (also serving the motors and power electronics) keeps the battery between 23-35 degrees Celsius, and battery modules (twelve 60 Ah cells each) can be replaced. The quattro electric all-wheel drive uses two electric motors, one mounted to the front and one at the rear. In \"boost mode,\" the two motors provide a total system output of and of torque enabling the car to accelerate from in 5.7 seconds. When not in boost mode, the combined peak motor power is , with from the front motor at a torque of and from the rear motor at a torque of . This allows the car to accelerate from 0\u2013100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 6.6 seconds and on to its top speed of . The car uses an energy recuperation system which, on average, contributes 30% to the range. Recuperation can be achieved both when the driver releases the accelerator and when applying pressure to the brake. When the car is equipped with the virtual side mirrors the car has a drag coefficient of 0.27. The e-tron also sits slightly lower than a traditional SUV; at high, it is lower than the Audi Q5. It has of boot space, more than the Mercedes-Benz EQC, along with of storage space in the front. ===Cold-weather performance=== In temperatures ranging from , with cabin heating on, the e-tron achieved a real-world range of , compared to in the summer, which means a 10.5% range drop. The tests were done at the speed of . The real range drop might by slightly higher because in the aforementioned tests the \"winter\" car had the advantage of more aerodynamic wheels than the \"summer\" car. This stands well in comparison to other EVs; five other electric vehicles, including the 2017 Tesla Model S 75D, were tested at the temperature of with cabin heating on, and all of them had a range drop of at least 30%, and 41% on average (compared to when the temperature was and cabin heating/air conditioning was off). The e-tron is, in summer driving and without reaching European highway speeds, less efficient than the Tesla Model X in terms of distance covered per kWh of energy. However, as the e-tron is less affected by low temperatures, driving in the winter brings the results of these two vehicles closer. In a test done at temperatures in the range and including high-speed highway driving, the e-tron's efficiency was about 12.4% worse than in the Model X.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgvkgnL0Ndwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFu9pkpunuo In slightly below-freezing conditions, the difference was even smaller and the e-tron's efficiency was about 8.6% worse than in the Model X.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blqZ_rZ7WFI ===Charging=== The e-tron can be charged at an effective rate of 150 kW using a 175 kW charger. This is possible in a wide state-of-charge window, until the battery is about 80% charged. With such a charger, adding of range takes only 10 minutes. Audi of America is more cautious with their estimates, saying that of range can be added in 10 minutes when using a 150 kW charger.https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-e-tron At 90%, charging rate is about 82 kW and it remains above 50 kW until reaching 100%. Using a 50 kW charger, the car can be charged at a constant rate of 50 kW, up until reaching 100%. ==Equipment== Virtual side mirrors Standard equipment for the e-tron includes 12-way heated and ventilated front seats, a panoramic moonroof, and 20-inch wheels. Upgrades include massage seats, power door closers, leather upholstery, 21-inch wheels and orange brake calipers. The interior is in line with other Audi models with a 10.1-inch infotainment screen, a smaller 8.6-inch touchscreen display, Amazon Alexa voice control, Virtual Cockpit system, and an optional head up display. Other equipments include a Bang & Olufsen sound system, and an available Driver Assistance package with enhanced adaptive cruise control, automatic parking assist and night vision. The e-tron is the second production car to offer optional virtual side mirrors, which replaces the traditional side-view mirrors and instead use cameras transmitting images to a high-contrast 7-inch OLED embedded in the door panels. ==Sportback version== 2019 Geneva International Motor Show|alt= e-tron Sportback In addition to the conventional SUV body style, Audi released a 'Sportback' version with a sloping rear part of the roof, similar to the BMW X6 and the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe. Audi decided to compete with these ICE- powered rivals by offering only a pure electric vehicle. Comparisons to the styling of Audi's own A7 have also been made. The production version debuted at AutoMobility LA in Los Angeles in November 2019. The length and width are the same as in the standard model, while the height is lower.In the European- specification model.https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/elektroauto/audi-e- tron-quattro-2018-elektroauto-suv/technische-daten/https://www.auto-motor-und- sport.de/elektroauto/audi-e-tron-55-sportback-2020-suv-coupe-check/technische- daten/ A drag coefficient is lower that in the standard model (0.25 vs. 0.27),Both cars equipped with virtual side mirrors; Sportback also equipped with S-line package. while the powertrain and battery are the same as in the original model. The 2020 e-tron Sportback has an EPA range of .https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id;=42674 It is better than it was the 2019 e-tron conventional SUV, partially because a larger percentage of the battery capacity is usable. The e-tron's battery management system keeps part of the battery capacity as a buffer, which is not part of the usable capacity; now the size of that buffer was decreased to unlock more usable capacity. This change, plus some others like reducing usage of the AWD mode, was introduced in the e-tron conventional SUV during the production run.https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/better-efficiency-and- longer-range-technical-update-for-the-audi-e- tron-12382https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33526095/2021-audi-etron-price- drop In the e-tron Sportback, that change was present from the beginning. Cargo space measured by European standards is reduced from to .Or, according to a different methodology, from to . American sources, however, measure cargo space in a different way and indicate that the original e-tron has as much as of cargo space, so the reduction to is substantial. It entered production in early 2020https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/brussels-belgium-203 and became available in Europe and in the UShttps://insideevs.com/news/447169/audi-etron- sales-us-record-q2-2020/ in 2020.https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press- releases/suv-coupe-for-the-e-tron-family-the-audi-e-tron-sportback-12725 ==Models== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Model !Years !Power !Torque !0\u2013100 km/h (0-62 mph) !Top speed !Range |- |e-tron 55 quattro (post-update) |2020\u2013 | + (boost mode: ) | + (boost mode: ) |6.6 s (boost mode: 5.7s) | |EPA: unknown WLTP: |- |e-tron 55 quattro |2018\u20132019 | + (boost mode: ) | + (boost mode: ) |6.6 s (boost mode: 5.7 s) | |EPA: 204 mi (328 km) WLTP: |- |e-tron 50 quattro |2019\u2013 | + | + |6.8 s | |EPA: unknown WLTP: |- |e-tron 55 quattro Sportback |2020\u2013 | + (boost mode: ) | + (boost mode: |6.6 s (boost mode: 5.7 s) | |EPA: WLTP: |- |e-tron 50 quattro Sportback |2020\u2013 | + | + |6.8 s | |EPA: unknown WLTP: |} ==Marketing== The e-tron made an appearance in an Audi commercial tied to Avengers: Endgame, where it was introduced to Captain Marvel who was briefed about the events of Avengers: Infinity War and the things that had changed on Earth while she was gone, although it never made an appearance in the movie itself.The e-tron Sportback concept as shown at the 2017 Shanghai Motor Show, looking different than the production e-tron Sportback, made an appearance in the movie. Later, the e-Tron appeared in Spider-Man: Far From Home where it was used by characters played by Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders.http://www.imcdb.org/movie_6320628-Spider-Man--Far-From-Home.html The name e-Tron is very similar to the French word \u00e9tron (meaning turd), causing some ridicule of the e-Tron in France and by Tesla-CEO Elon Musk. ==Production issues and recall== Reports surfaced in April 2019 that the e-tron was subject to production delays and a cut in production targets due to supply of batteries and electric motors. Subsequently, weekly production hours at the assembly plant were foreseen to be reduced from 30 to 24. Audi announced a recall of certain e-tron models in early June 2019. The recall relates to a water leak that could lead to the high voltage electronics shorting, potentially causing a fire in extreme cases. == Markets == === Asia-Pacific === ==== Thailand ==== The Audi e-tron will be launched in Thailand by Meister Technik in 2019. and 15 October 2020 is Opening the Audi e-tron Sportback. ==== Pakistan ==== PAKISTAN ...Etron was launched in Pakistan in 2020 by Audi Pakistan ..source www.pakwheels.com === North America === ==== Canada ==== The vehicle went on sale in Canada in 2019.
