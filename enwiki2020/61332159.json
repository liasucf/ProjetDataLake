    "text": "Holotype skull of I. kalasinensis Indosinosuchus (\"Indochinese crocodile\") is a genus of teleosaurid neosuchian that lived during the Late Jurassic in what is now Thailand. It contains two species, the type species I. potamosiamensis and I. kalasinensis, both recovered from the lower Phu Kradung Formation.Weishampel, et al. (2004). \"Dinosaur distribution.\" Pp. 517-607. The age of Indosinosuchus is unclear, as vertebrate fossils like Indosinosuchus support a Late Jurassic age, while palynological data suggests an Early Cretaceous (Berriasian) age.
