    "text": "Fantastic Adventures magazine A fantasy fiction magazine, or fantasy magazine, is a magazine which publishes primarily fantasy fiction. Not generally included in the category are magazines for children with stories about such characters as Santa Claus. Also not included are adult magazines about sexual fantasy. Many fantasy magazines, in addition to fiction, have other features such as art, cartoons, reviews, or letters from readers. Some fantasy magazines also publish science fiction and horror fiction, so there is not always a clear distinction between a fantasy magazine and a science fiction magazine. For example, Fantastic magazine published almost exclusively science fiction for much of its run. == Major fantasy magazines == === Current magazines === * Abyss & Apex Magazine, 2003\u2013present * Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine, 2002\u2013present AUS * Apex Magazine, Apex Magazine, 2005\u2013present * Aurealis, 1990\u2013present, AUS * Bards and Sages Quarterly, 2009\u2013present * Beneath Ceaseless Skies, 2008\u2013present * Black Gate, 2001\u2013present * Clarkesworld Magazine, 2006\u2013present, webzine * Common Tongue Dark Fantasy Magazine, 2020-present, webzine, US * Daily Science Fiction, 2010\u2013present, webzine/email zine * Fantastyka, 1982\u2013present, Poland; the oldest SF/fantasy magazine in Eastern Europe, print * GUD Magazine, 2006\u2013present, print/pdf * Heavy Metal, 1974\u2013present * Hypnos, 2012\u2013presentHypnos * Lady Churchill's Rosebud Wristlet, 1996\u2013present * Lightspeed, 2006\u2013present webzine (Fantasy magazine merged with Lightspeed to become one title in 2012) * The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, 1949\u2013present, US * Mir Fantastiki, 2003\u2013present, Russia * Mithila Review, 2016\u2013present, India * On Spec, 1989\u2013present, CA * Orion's Child Science Fiction & Fantasy Magazine * Postscripts Magazine, 2004\u2013present, UK * Strange Horizons, 2000\u2013present, webzine * Three-lobed Burning Eye, 1999\u2013present * Weird Tales, 1923\u201354, US (multiple revivals, including 1986\u2013present, US) === Defunct magazines === * Absent Willow Review, 2008\u20132011Absent Willow Review * Argosy, 1882\u20131942, 1942\u20131978, US * Beyond Fantasy Fiction, 1953\u20131955, US * Electric Velocipede, 2001\u20132013 * Famous Fantastic Mysteries, 1939\u20131953, US * Fantastic, 1952\u20131980, US (title revived in the 2000s for the former Pirate Writings) * Fantastic Adventures, 1939\u20131953, US * Fantastic Novels, 1940\u201341, 1948\u20131951, US * Fantasy Fiction, 1953, US * Fant\u00e1zia, Slovakia * Fenix, 1990\u20132001, Poland * Forgotten Fantasy, 1970\u201371, US * Ideomancer, webzine, 2001\u20132015 * Imagination, 1950\u20131958, US * Jim Baen's Universe * Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine, 1988\u20132000, US * Der Orchideengarten, 1919\u20131921, Germany * Paradox Magazine, 2003\u2013? * Realms of Fantasy, 1994\u20132010, US * Science Fantasy, 1950\u20131967, UK (aka Impulse) * Shimmer Magazine, 2005\u20132018 * Subterranean Magazine, print 1995\u20132007, webzine 2007\u20132014 * Sybil's Garage, 2003\u20132010 * The Third Alternative, UK * The Twilight Zone Magazine, 1981\u20131987, US * Unknown, 1939\u20131943, US * Whispers, 1973\u20131987, US == See also== * Fan magazine * Horror fiction magazine * Science fiction magazine ==External links== * Duotrope - search engine for fiction magazines ==References== Fiction magazines Category:Lists of magazines ",
