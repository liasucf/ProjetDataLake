    "text": "Partulidae is a family of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Partuloidea. The family is endemic to Pacific islands.Myers, P., R. Espinosa, C. S. Parr, T. Jones, G. S. Hammond, and T. A. Dewey. 2006. The Animal Diversity Web (online). Accessed at http://animaldiversity.org. ITIS Standard Report Page: PartulidaeGerlach, J. (2016) Icons of Evolution - Pacific island tree snails, family Partulidae. Phelsuma Press, Cambridge == Genera == The Partulidae are divided into five genera: Cowie, R.H. (1992). Evolution and Extinction of Partulidae, Endemic Pacific Island Land Snails. Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences, Vol. 335, No. 1274 (Feb. 29, 1992), pp. 167-191. * Eua has four species, confined to Tonga and Samoa. * Partula has about 100 species, distributed from New Guinea to the Society Islands. * Samoana has about 23 species, distributed in Polynesia and the Mariana Islands. * Palaopartula has three species, restricted to the Palau. * Sphendone has a single species from the Palau. This cladogram shows the phylogenic relationships of genera in the family Partulidae:Lee T., Burch J. B., Coote T., Pearce-Kelly P., Hickman C., Meyer J.-Y. & Foighil D. O.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 9: 204. ==Anatomy== Partula gibba Partula langfordi Samoana fragilis In this family, the number of haploid chromosomes lies between 26 and 30 (according to the values in this table).Barker G.

CABI Publishing, Oxon, UK, 2001, . 1-146, cited pages: 139 and 142. ==Significance== The Partulidae represent a significant species radiation and were important in the development of modern evolutionary studies through the work of Henry Crampton in the early 20th century and later by Bryan Clarke, James Murray and Michael Johnson. ==Status== Most Partulidae species have declined since 1974 and a very large proportion are extinct. The main threat to their survival has been the introduction of the predatory snail Euglandina rosea. ==References== == External links == Partulidae evolution, diversity and conservation Partula Pages ",
