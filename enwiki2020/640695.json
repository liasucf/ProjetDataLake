    "text": "Willis Tower The buildings and architecture of Chicago have influenced and reflected the history of American architecture. The built environment of Chicago is reflective of the city's history and multicultural heritage, featuring prominent buildings in a variety of styles by many important architects. Since most structures within the downtown area were destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 (the most famous exception being the Water Tower) Chicago buildings are noted for their originality rather than their antiquity. Chicago is world-famous for its plethora of unique architectural styles, from Chicago Bungalows and Two-Flats to the grand Graystones along Logan Boulevard and Lawndale Avenue, from the skyscrapers of the Loop as well as a wealth of sacred architecture such as the city's ornate \"Polish Cathedrals\". ==Skyscrapers== File:2010-02-19_16500x2000_chicago_skyline_panorama.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|The 2010 Chicago skyline as seen from the Adler Planetarium poly 1044 1289 2225 1284 2221 1519 1035 1515 Field Museum of Natural History poly 2317 1409 2328 888 2407 892 2440 194 2678 210 2681 1343 2397 1352 2392 1409 One Museum Park poly 2251 1597 2246 1413 2393 1410 2394 1383 2508 1377 2508 1350 2971 1334 2962 1240 3121 1159 3137 1091 3158 1161 3306 1224 3308 1338 4143 1365 4146 1600 Shedd Aquarium poly 2831 1342 2830 896 2901 839 2956 887 2975 1034 2965 1336 The Columbian poly 5094 1587 5097 1229 5212 1218 5216 1184 5313 1185 5311 1115 5477 1119 5476 1188 5624 1192 5623 1225 5729 1224 5731 1593 Hilton Chicago poly 5728 1571 5729 1242 5769 1238 5769 1229 5811 1225 5845 1225 5845 1233 5887 1235 5887 1241 5897 1247 5903 1257 5909 1268 5914 1289 5911 1581 Renaissance Blackstone Hotel poly 5738 1236 5734 1115 5820 1099 5924 1107 5928 1329 5919 1328 5915 1277 5907 1255 5886 1230 5843 1223 5754 1228 5752 1239 One Financial Place poly 5841 1098 5844 1038 5858 1037 5858 839 5868 819 5889 818 5894 794 5958 794 5958 819 5984 822 5998 864 5996 1040 6044 1041 6044 1236 5984 1235 5980 1284 5964 1285 5962 1331 5928 1332 5924 1103 311 South Wacker Drive poly 6111 1587 6111 1431 6056 1431 6056 1401 6011 1403 6011 1378 6073 1375 6097 1376 6099 1393 6209 1400 6212 1601 Spertus Institute poly 6094 1348 6093 1236 6139 1235 6140 1218 6157 1218 6156 1333 6141 1333 6141 1343 200 South Wacker Drive poly 6157 1336 6153 902 6183 898 6184 637 6209 633 6203 205 6333 207 6333 627 6390 635 6389 896 6426 896 6419 1135 6401 1125 6367 1086 6361 1040 6332 1039 6330 1089 6291 1131 6277 1224 6274 1318 Willis Tower poly 6285 1325 6287 1225 6293 1131 6335 1087 6340 1038 6355 1045 6358 1087 6401 1121 6414 1222 6422 1362 6312 1358 6310 1337 Chicago Board of Trade poly 6387 1373 6641 1379 6645 1420 6828 1421 6828 1576 6385 1580 6390 1380 Congress Plaza Hotel poly 6521 1248 6516 1073 6603 1062 6705 1070 6705 1205 6679 1176 6575 1179 6545 1223 6548 1263 111 South Wacker Drive poly 6721 1263 6713 1217 6722 909 6745 885 6751 796 6859 790 6865 871 6903 911 6900 1055 6808 1075 6808 1284 Franklin Center North Tower poly 6810 1352 6808 1077 6870 1068 6872 1058 6928 1053 6969 1054 6972 1064 7036 1068 7033 1268 7023 1270 7021 1406 6938 1400 6936 1345Kluczynski Federal Building poly 6841 1421 7097 1422 7088 1584 6834 1585 Auditorium Building poly 7036 1236 7037 1117 7130 1119 7128 1230 Field Building poly 7129 1265 7126 901 7226 885 7441 903 7445 1264 7368 1259 7367 1270 7264 1289 7256 1439 7244 1438 7237 1409 7190 1409 7192 1269 CNA Center poly 7447 1241 7443 1049 7603 1049 7599 1241 Citadel Center poly 7578 1536 7573 1259 7608 1256 7609 1165 7653 1108 7669 1065 7679 1066 7686 1103 7727 1164 7737 1197 7737 1266 7772 1269 7768 1601Metropolitan Tower poly 7655 1069 7650 862 7892 837 7888 1291 7867 1308 7780 1300 7770 1270 7740 1263 7733 1186 7695 1114 7681 1070 7665 1069 Chase Tower poly 7895 1114 7890 939 7948 940 7989 1002 7964 1008 7963 1083 Three First National Plaza poly 7774 1545 7774 1329 7830 1314 7929 1312 7986 1337 7984 1543 Santa Fe Building poly 7896 1314 7897 1144 7908 1142 7908 1081 7967 1086 7967 1317 One South Dearborn poly 7968 1314 7964 1006 8082 986 8211 982 8211 1006 8337 1012 8344 1286 8037 1279 8034 1298 Mid-Continental Plaza poly 8173 1556 8320 1549 8320 1596 8172 1597 Buckingham Fountain poly 8348 1308 8347 1284 8339 1285 8337 1070 8387 1067 8388 1075 8400 1076 8402 1342 8384 1341 8383 1307 Richard J.

Beginning in the early 1880s, architectural pioneers of the Chicago School explored steel-frame construction and, in the 1890s, the use of large areas of plate glass. These were among the first modern skyscrapers. William LeBaron Jenney's Home Insurance Building was completed in 1885 and is considered to be the first to use steel in its structural frame instead of cast iron. However, this building was still clad in heavy brick and stone. The Montauk Building, designed by John Wellborn Root Sr. and Daniel Burnham, was built from 1882 to 1883 using structural steel. Daniel Burnham and his partners, John Welborn Root and Charles Atwood, designed technically advanced steel frames with glass and terra cotta skins in the mid-1890s, in particular the Reliance Building; these were made possible by professional engineers, in particular E. C. Shankland, and modern contractors, in particular George A. Fuller. Louis Sullivan was perhaps the city's most philosophical architect. Realizing that the skyscraper represented a new form of architecture, he discarded historical precedent and designed buildings that emphasized their vertical nature. This new form of architecture, by Jenney, Burnham, Sullivan, and others, became known as the \"Commercial Style,\" but it was called the \"Chicago School\" by later historians. In 1892, the Masonic Temple surpassed the New York World Building, breaking its two-year reign as the tallest skyscraper, only to be surpassed itself two years later by another New York building. Since 1963, a \"Second Chicago School\" emerged from the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. The ideas of structural engineer Fazlur Khan were also influential in this movement,Billington 1985, pp 234-235 in particular his introduction of a new structural system of framed tubes in skyscraper design and construction. The first building to apply the tube-frame construction was the DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building which Khan designed and was completed in Chicago by 1966. This laid the foundations for the tube structures of many other later skyscrapers, including his own constructions of the John Hancock Center and Willis Tower (then named the Sears Tower) in Chicago and can be seen in the construction of the World Trade Center, Petronas Towers, Jin Mao Building, and most other supertall skyscrapers since the 1960s. Willis Tower would be the world's tallest building from its construction in 1974 until 1998 (when the Petronas Towers was built) and would remain the tallest for some categories of buildings until the Burj Khalifa was completed in early 2010. ==Landmarks, monuments and public places== Chicago Avenue Pumping Station in the Old Chicago Water Tower District along the Magnificent Mile St. John Cantius, one of Chicago's 'Polish Cathedrals' Numerous architects have constructed landmark buildings of varying styles in Chicago. Among them are the so-called \"Chicago seven\": James Ingo Freed, Tom Beeby, Larry Booth, Stuart Cohen, James Nagle, Stanley Tigerman, and Ben Weese. Daniel Burnham led the design of the \"White City\" of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition which some historians claim led to a revival of Neo-Classical architecture throughout Chicago and the entire United States. It is true that the \"White City\" represented anything other than its host city's architecture. While Burnham did develop the 1909 \"Plan for Chicago\", perhaps the first comprehensive city plan in the U.S, in a Neo- Classical style, many of Chicago's most progressive skyscrapers occurred after the Exposition closed, between 1894 and 1899. Louis Sullivan said that the fair set the course of American architecture back by two decades, but even his finest Chicago work, the Schlesinger and Meyer (later Carson, Pirie, Scott) store, was built in 1899\u2014five years after the \"White City\" and ten years before Burnham's Plan. Sullivan's comments should be viewed in the context of his complicated relationship with Burnham. Erik Larson's history of the Columbian Exposition, The Devil in the White City, correctly points out that the building techniques developed during the construction of the many buildings of the fair were entirely modern, even if they were adorned in a way Sullivan found aesthetically distasteful. Chicago is well known for its wealth of public art, including works by such artistic heavyweights as Chagall, Picasso, Mir\u00f3 and Abakanowicz that are all to be found outdoors. City sculptures additionally honor the many people and topics reflecting the rich history of Chicago. There are monuments to: * Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko by Kazimierz Chodzinski * Nicholas Copernicus by Bertel Thorvaldsen * Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd by Joseph Strachovsky * Pope John Paul II, several different monuments (including by Czes\u0142aw D\u017awigaj) * Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk by Albin Polasek * Irv Kupcinet by Preston Jackson * Abraham Lincoln by Augustus Saint Gaudens * The Heald Square Monument featuring George Washington, Haym Salomon, and Robert Morris by Lorado Taft, (completed by Leonard Crunelle) * Christopher Columbus by Carl Brioschi * General John A. Logan by Augustus Saint Gaudens * Harry Caray by Omri Amrany and Lou Cella * Jack Brickhouse by Jerry McKenna * A memorial to the Haymarket affair by Mary Brogger * A memorial to the Great Northern Migration by Alison Saar There are also plans to erect a 1:1-scale replica of Wac\u0142aw Szymanowski's statue of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin along Chicago's lakefront. in addition to a different sculpture commemorating the artist in Chopin Park. In the 21st century, Chicago has become a leading urban focus for landscape architecture, and the architecture of public places. Building on 19th-20th century legacies of architects such as, Burnham, Frederick Olmsted, Jens Jensen and Alfred Caldwell, modern projects include Millennium Park, Northerly Island, the 606, the Chicago Riverwalk, Maggie Daley Park, and proposals in Jackson Park.Kamin, Blair (July 19, 2015) \"Landscape Design Takes Cemter Stage: Chicago leads way in architecture trend focus on public spaces\" Sec 1. p 7. ==Residential architecture== Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie School influenced both building design and the design of furnishings. In the early half of the 20th century, popular residential neighborhoods were developed with Chicago Bungalow style houses, many of which still exist. The two-flat apartment building, along with the larger three- and six-flat buildings, make up 30% of Chicago's housing stock.Chicago Architecture Center A two-flat includes two apartments, each of which occupies a full floor, usually with a large bay window and with a grey stone or red brick facade. The apartments typically have the same layout with a large living and dining room area at the front, the kitchen at the back and the bedrooms running down one side of the unit. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Illinois Institute of Technology campus in Chicago influenced the later Modern or International style. Van der Rohe's work is sometimes called the Second Chicago School. ==Preservation== Many organizations, notably Preservation Chicago and Landmarks Illinois are devoted to promoting the preservation of historic neighborhoods and buildings in Chicago.
