In 1997 Jordan shared the Massachusetts Psychological Association's \"Career Contribution Award\" with Irene Pierce Stiver and Janet Surray, and in 2010 she received the American Psychological Association Division 29's \"Distinguished Psychologist Award for Contributions to Psychology and Psychotherapy\". ==Early life== Jordan grew up in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. In school, Jordan was excluded from safety patrol and shop class in middle school (privileges reserved for boys), but she was encouraged by her mother to fight the exclusion.Robb, C. (2006). This changes everything: The relational revolution in psychology. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux., p.123 She attended Abbot Academy (now Phillips Andover Academy) for high school because she had excellent grades and was not being challenged in her small rural school. Jordan struggled with overwhelming homesickness and was shamed into believing that if she couldn't \"separate from home, [she] wouldn't be able to succeed at anything\" from school authorities.Robb, C. (2006). This changes everything: The relational revolution in psychology. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux., p.124 The school determined that Jordan should see a therapist, which was her initial introduction to the profession of psychology, and while this relationship was important, it did not deconstruct Jordan's internalized belief that she had to separate from the people that she loved in order to \"be successful\"Robb, C. (2006). This changes everything: The relational revolution in psychology. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux., p.124 Her interest in the power of connection found its roots in her own struggle to stay connected with important people in a world that told her that was a sign of \"weakness\". At Brown University she studied Psychology, and went on t get her Ph.D. from Harvard University, where she studied child development, and clinical psychology. She wrote her dissertation on how a competitive context interrupts girls' achievement behaviors. As a young faculty and clinician at Harvard Medical School, she began to write about the limitations of a \"separate self\" model of development and looked at the ways in which empathy provides an experiential sense of connection and compassion. ==Education and early career== Jordan received the award for outstanding achievement in her graduate class at Harvard University. She founded the Women's Studies Program and Women's Treatment Network at McLean Hospital and served as its first director. *Abott Academy (now Phillips Andover Academy), Andover, MA *BA, Brown University Phi Beta Kappa, Magna Cum Laude *Ph.D, Clinical Psychology, Harvard University, recognition for outstanding academic performance *Internship at McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA *1978, junior faculty, McLean Hospital Department of Psychology, working with Irene Pierce Stiver and colleague Jan Surrey At Harvard, Jordan was told that her position in the doctoral program was \"wasted on a woman,\" a refrain that was repeated to other leaders in feminist psychology (including Carol Gilligan).Robb, C. (2006). This changes everything: The relational revolution in psychology. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Jordan drew on her mother's experience of being repeatedly told to leave her M.D. program and excelled at Harvard, but she \"really went underground in terms of any sense of competence and strength\" until she joined Jean Baker Miller's Monday night group.Robb, C. (2006). This changes everything: The relational revolution in psychology. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux., p.124-125 In training, Jordan had been taught that the neutrality of the therapist was paramount to a patient's healing, and that for a therapist to demonstrate any emotional response to a patient's story or feelings would \"have a bad impact on the patient\".Robb, C. (2006). This changes everything: The relational revolution in psychology. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux. In her own practice, Jordan began to wonder if this distant neutrality was adversely affecting patients. She \"couldn't bring herself to abandon her patients to please her supervisors,\" and \"the kind of therapy she did 'felt deviant'\" in this respect.Robb, C. (2006). This changes everything: The relational revolution in psychology. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux., p.124-125 Jordan said that she began to meet with the women in Miller's Monday night group, \"whom I respected tremendously, seeing that they were living with the same kind of uncomfortableness in this position, and that they were making the same kind of changes in what they were doing was incredibly validating\".Robb, C. (2006). This changes everything: The relational revolution in psychology. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux., p.125 The core group met every other week for ten years, talking openly and honestly about the work that they were doing, and the things they were learning from and with their patients, in Jean Baker Miller's living room.Robb, C.
