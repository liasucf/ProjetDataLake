The film is produced under Sri Sravanthi Movies banner. The film stars Ram Pothineni and Raashi Khanna in the lead roles. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and it was a box office failure. ==Plot== Shiva (Ram) is a young and happy-go-lucky guy who supports love marriage and keeps helping couples to get married against their parents will. One day when he is in a train, he sees Tanu (Rashi Khanna) proposing to him loudly. He eventually jumps out. Tanu runs away after her friend Rishitha (Himaja) said her acting was good, but asked to whom she proposed. Shiva finally follows Tanu in a school. Tanu was doing rehearsal for her acting in theatre. He thought that Tanu fell in love with him. But she continuously rejects him. He makes Rishi's marriage with her lover and asks Tanu to turn back if she loves him, or he would never come into her life. But Bhoji Reddy's (Vineet Kumar) men come to beat him because he had beaten up his son. He says that if she turns back, he would beat them up; if she doesn't, he would come with them. Eventually, Abhi (Abhimanyu Singh), who was looking for Shiva, takes Tanu with him. Shiva beats them up after a man says that she turned back. Abhi reveals that Tanu was always lucky for him and wants to marry her. Shiva takes her away at her wedding, leaving a fight between Abhi and Bhoji. They both unite and search for Shiva. Tanu and Shiva go to Goa. In that time, Tanu falls for him. When she is about to propose to him, he fights with some goons to make two lovers unite. As he is seriously wounded, she asks him either she or they. Shiva eventually supports them, which makes her emotional. Bhoji kidnaps her. Shiva's father (Posani Krishna Murali) reveals that his son's real name is Ram. Ram and Shiva were best friends, until Shiva committed suicide. Ram learns that he loved a girl who also committed suicide. He hid this because Ram would risk his life to get them married. After hearing this, Tanu realizes her mistake, Bhoji too gives up, and Abhi goes through memory loss. As the film ends on a happy note, Tanu meets Shiva at a mall, falls in love with him and they live happily together. ==Cast== *Ram Pothineni as Shiva / Ram *Raashi Khanna as Tanu *Abhimanyu Singh as Abhi *Brahmanandam as Tiger Bhai *Vineet Kumar as Bhoji Reddy *Jaya Prakash Reddy as Bhoji Reddy's brother-in-law *Posani Krishna Murali as Shiva's father *Srinivasa Reddy as Ramakrishna, Shiva's friend *Himaja as Rishitha, Tanu's friend *Nagineedu as Krishna Murthy *Sapthagiri as Happy *Fish Venkat as Fish *Pankaj Kesari as Peddi Reddy *Krishna Bhagavan as IPod Shastry *Amit Tiwari *Mano as Tanu's father *Naresh *Madhunandan *Surekha Vani *Appaji Ambarisha Darbha as Inspector general of police ==Music== Devi Sri Prasad has scored the music for the soundtrack.
