    "text": "Motu One (Marquesan for \"Sand Island\"; ) is the name of a small sandbank with no vegetation located on the western edge of a coral reef. The reef is approximately in diameter and the islet or islets are less than a hectare in surface, rising only a few feet above sea level and changing shape regularly owing to the action of the currents. Motu One is the northernmost of the Marquesas Islands, located about northeast of E\u00efao and northeast of Hatutu. It is also the only island in the group that is not made of exposed volcanic material, being a calcareous coral reef on a volcanic plug. Motu One is administratively part of the commune (municipality) of Nuku-Hiva, itself in the administrative subdivision of the Marquesas. Although Motu One was reportedly visited by Marquesans, primarily on egg-collecting missions, there is no archaeological evidence that they were ever inhabited. The first Westerners to sight the islet were on the 1813-1814 voyage of the American commander Commodore David Porter, who named it Lincoln Island. Subsequent explorers also called it Sand Island. ==Ecology== Green sea turtles nest on Motu One. There is a large stand of Porolithon (Hydrolithon) that is unique in French Polynesia. There are a wide variety of pelagic birds nesting on the islets including a subspecies of the southern Marquesan reed warbler, the Mohotani Marquesan warbler (Acrocephalus mendanae consobrina) (Murphy & Mathews, 1928).Marquesan Reed-warbler (Acrocephalus mendanae) Since 1992, the whole reef and island ecosystem have been protected as the Motu One Reserve. ==See also== * Marquesan Nature Reserves * Desert island * List of islands == References == == External links == *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Ornithologie de Polyn\u00e9sie \"MANU\" Category:Islands of the Marquesas Islands Category:Uninhabited islands of French Polynesia ",
