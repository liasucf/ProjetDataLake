    "text": "The Diary of Maria Tholo was a series of interviews with a South African resident of Soweto, Maria Tholo, which were published by Ravan Press as Tholo's 'diary' in 1979. Maria Tholo was interviewed each week by a researcher, Carol Hermer, over a year starting in February 1976. Hermer chose to present the material \"in diary format [...] to lend immediacy to the events.\"The Diary of Maria Tholo, p.ix. Quoted in The interviews spanned a period of time which included the Soweto uprising, in which police infamously fired on schoolchildren. Maria Tholo provided eyewitness testimony of the township rioting and its after-effects, juxtaposed with quotidian detail of her own immediate family life. This gave her account of the uprising \"the ambivalence and complexity that history and hindsight sometimes erase\". ==References== ==External links== * The Diary of Maria Tholo by Carol Hermer Category:1979 non-fiction books Category:South African non-fiction books Category:Oral history books Category:Soweto Category:1976 in South Africa ",
