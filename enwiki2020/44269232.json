With no other options, Sarah tries to make the best of a bad situation and initially things seem to be going fairly well, as she finds that she gets along well with her neighbors. However it isn't long before a series of strange events culminates in a horde of zombies appearing and attacking the building's occupants. ==Cast== *Jason Mewes as Sid *Roxanne Pallett as Sarah MacColl *Frances Ruffelle as Kim *Jessica-Jane Clement as Kate *Jessica Ann Bonner as Beverly *Holly Henderson *Eddie Webber as Carnacki *Emma Buckley as Lucy ==Reception== Critical reception for Devil's Tower has been moderately positive, with multiple reviewers commenting that although the film was overly familiar and lacked originality, the movie's acting was decent and the film's script was entertaining. Dread Central gave the film three blades, praising the performance of Jessica-Jane Clement and writing: \"It's a strong enough story given some real effort by the cast and was obviously put together by filmmakers with a love of the genre and the drive to make it work regardless of limitations.\" FromPage2Screen.Com rated the film very highly again noticing the care and attention given to the film, by filmmakers who love their craft ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 films Category:2014 horror films Category:British zombie films Category:British films Category:British ghost films Category:British haunted house films ",
