The season was unique because it was the first time Tyra Banks allowed both men and women to compete against each for the first place. Throughout the show, Hindorff was forced to mature his inner-self to stand against the criticism of fellow male models and especially judge Rob for being too \"feminine\" and having a lack of masculine poses for the photoshoots He described it in an interview: \"I went through an identity crisis that almost completely destroyed me when I was on that show. All of that said, my experience on Top Model was incredible and life changing. It was a very positive thing. I just wish I could've desensitized myself to all of the pressure I was receiving to 'man up' or to \u2018act straight.\u2019\" Tyra Banks also helped Hindorff get through some tough times during the show: \"She told me that what I had to offer was polarizing\u2026and that I should use that to my advantage. That advice has served me very well! She was also the one who recommended that I get into event hosting and red carpet hosting! I've made most of the money I've earned in 2015 through hosting at events and on red carpets so she definitely knew what she was talking about! I love her endlessly.\" After his run on the 20th cycle of ANTM he returned for three cameos on the next season. === After ANTM === He went on to do several modeling jobs, including hosting the 2015 Queer Fashion Show and being on the cover of GPhilly. === Music career === In February 2015, he released his first single \"I\u00b4m Sorry\" and followed it with \"Carpe Diem\" on July that same year.
