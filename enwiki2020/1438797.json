    "text": "Northern Lights \u2013 Southern Cross is the sixth studio album by Canadian- American rock group the Band, released in 1975. It was the first album to be recorded at their new California studio, Shangri-La, and the first album of all new material since 1971's Cahoots. All eight songs are credited as compositions of guitarist Robbie Robertson. Northern Lights \u2013 Southern Cross was recorded using a 24-track tape recorder, which allowed Garth Hudson to include multiple layers of keyboards on several tracks. Three songs from the album \u2013 \"It Makes No Difference\", \"Ophelia\" and \"Acadian Driftwood\" \u2013 were performed at The Last Waltz, the Band's 1976 \"final performance\". \"It Makes No Difference\" and \"Ophelia\" were included in the Last Waltz film and on the original 1978 soundtrack album, and \"Acadian Driftwood\" was included in the 2002 extended re-release of the soundtrack album. These songs in particular have enjoyed subsequent revivals and cover versions. \"Acadian Driftwood\" was featured in a 1984 CBC-TV special titled Murray McLauchlan's Floating Over Canada. The only Band member to appear in the sequence was Levon Helm. In this presentation of the song, Levon, his wife Sandy Helm, and Murray McLauchlan depict the expulsion of Acadian citizens by British forces. The album was well-received critically: Rolling Stone declared that The Band had kicked \"a field goal\",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/northern-lights- southern-cross-19760129 and, while he was put off by the sentimentality of the lyrics, Robert Christgau wrote \"the pure comeliness of every melody on this album led to an immediate infatuation.\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Band ==Track listing== All songs written and composed by Robbie Robertson. ===Side one=== ===Side two=== * Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u20138 on CD reissues. ===Bonus track listing from 2001 re-release=== ==Personnel== ;The Band http://theband.hiof.no/albums/northern_lights_southern_cross.html *Rick Danko \u2013 bass, guitar, violin, harmonica, vocals, mixing *Levon Helm \u2013 drums, guitar, percussion, vocals *Garth Hudson \u2013 organ, keyboards, accordion, saxophones, synthesizers, piccolo, brass, woodwind, chanter, bass, mixing *Richard Manuel \u2013 acoustic and electric piano, keyboards, organ, drums, clavinet, percussion, vocals *Robbie Robertson \u2013 guitars, piano, clavinet, melodica, percussion, mixing ;Additional personnel *Byron Berline \u2013 fiddle on \"Acadian Driftwood\" *Nat Jeffrey \u2013 engineer, mixing *Rob Fraboni \u2013 engineer, mixing *Ed Anderson \u2013 engineer ==Charts== Album - Billboard (United States) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Chart !Position |- |1976 |Billboard 200 |26 |} Singles - Billboard (United States) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- |1976 |\"Ophelia\" |Hot 100 |62 |} ==External links== * \u2013 Peter Viney's article on \"Acadian Driftwood\" at theband.hiof.no * \u2013 Peter Viney's article on \"Jupiter Hollow\" at theband.hiof.no ==References== Category:The Band albums Category:1975 albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Albums produced by Garth Hudson Category:Albums produced by Levon Helm Category:Albums produced by Richard Manuel Category:Albums produced by Rick Danko Category:Albums produced by Robbie Robertson Category:Albums recorded at Shangri-La (recording studio) ",
