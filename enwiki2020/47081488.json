It was built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern as a replacement for an older wooden depot, then acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914, along with the rest of the LS&MS.; The passenger depot building has housed the Conneaut Historical Railroad Museum since 1964, and has a display track with the Nickel Plate Road #755 Berkshire steam engine. The station has been registered as the Lake Shore And Michigan Southern Passenger Depot on the National Register of Historic Places since March 27, 1975.
