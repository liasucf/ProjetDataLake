He co-directed Kung Fu Panda 3, alongside Jennifer Yuh Nelson. ==Biography== Born in Bologna, Carloni spent his childhood in Urbino, a walled city and World Heritage site southwest of Pesaro, known for its remarkable legacy of independent Renaissance culture and for being the birthplace of Renaissance master Raphael Santi. But, Carloni was not a young artist, at least not officially. Not even though his father worked as an illustrator for magazines, book covers, and advertisements. \u201cI was exposed to his work, but he never pushed me to be part of his studio,\u201d Carloni says. \u201cHe taught me many things. He wanted me to explore on my own.\u201d He became an artist almost despite himself. Carloni entered the University of Milan as a literature major, but to earn money, he began selling drawings. \u201cI got little jobs through my friends to help pay for meals and money here and there,\u201d he says. \u201cSmall things like invitation tickets for clubs.\u201d Those little jobs helped change his future. \u201cIt made me understand that my true passion was visual storytelling,\u201d he says. \u201cI cared about that more than continuing my studies.\u201d A friend in Germany suggested he apply to Munich Animation, and soon Carloni was an in-betweener. \u201cI drew all the tedious drawings,\u201d he says. But, that led to work as an animator, a story artist, a director, an art director, a character designer, a sculptor, and an animation supervisor for commercials, music videos, and feature films in Germany, Switzerland, and Denmark. Then, in 2000, he co-directed an award-winning animated short film through Munich Animation with writer-director Gabriele Pennacchioli. The studio envisioned the film, The Shark and the Piano, as a marketing tool. \u201cIt was still a time when American studios sent portions of their 2D feature films to Europe to produce,\u201d Carloni says, \u201cso we decided to make a film to show what we could do.\u201d But, by the time they approached the American studios, those studios had turned their focus to 3D. Since joining DreamWorks Animation in 2002, Carloni served as lead animator on Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas and Shark Tale, an animation supervisor on Kung Fu Panda, a story artist on Kung Fu Panda 2 and The Croods, and head of story on the first two How to Train Your Dragon movies and as a story artist on the third one. For his work on Kung Fu Panda, he was nominated in the category Storyboarding in an Animated Feature Production at the 36th Annie Awards. In early 2012, Carloni was attached as a director to the computer-animated/traditionally animated film Me and My Shadow for DWA, replacing the original director Mark Dindal. By early 2013, the film had returned into development following massive lay-offs at DWA. By early 2015, Carloni had joined Jennifer Yuh Nelson to help her co-directing Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016), in order to meet its release dateline. He has since moved to Ilion Animation Studios and Skydance Media to develop several animated films. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Role |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Fearless Four | 1997 | Assistant animator |- ! scope=\"row\" | Tobias and His Lion | 1999 | Rough animator |- ! scope=\"row\" | A Fish Tale | 2000 | Lead animator, sculptor |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Shark and the Piano | 2001 | Co- director, story developer, animation director, supervising effects animator, sculptures |- ! scope=\"row\" | Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas | 2003 | Lead animator: Sinbad |- ! scope=\"row\" | Shark Tale | 2004 | Lead animator: Crazy Joe, story developer |- ! scope=\"row\" | First Flight | rowspan=2 | 2006 | Storyboard artist |- ! scope=\"row\" | Over the Hedge | Animator, story artist, storyboard artist |- ! scope=\"row\" | Kung Fu Panda | 2008 | Animation supervisor, story artist, traditional animator: Mr. Ping (uncredited) |- ! scope=\"row\" | How to Train Your Dragon | rowspan=2 | 2010 | Head of Story |- ! scope=\"row\" | Kung Fu Panda Holiday | Head of character animation |- ! scope=\"row\" | Kung Fu Panda 2 | 2011 | rowspan=2 | Story artist |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Croods | 2013 |- ! scope=\"row\" |How to Train Your Dragon 2 | 2014 | Head of story |- ! scope=\"row\" | Kung Fu Panda 3 | rowspan=5 | 2016 | Co-director |- ! scope=\"row\" | Cake Wars | Himself: guest judge |- ! scope=\"row\" | Made in Hollywood | rowspan=3 | Himself: guest appearance (1 episodes) |- ! scope=\"row\" | Made in Hollywood: Teen Edition |- ! scope=\"row\" | Sidewalks Entertainment |- ! scope=\"row\" | How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World | 2019 | Story artist |- ! scope=\"row\" | Ron's Gone Wrong | 2021 | Director |- |} ==Nominations== * Best Storyboarding in an Animated Feature Production for How to Train Your Dragon (2010, Annie's) * Best Storyboarding in an Animated Feature Production for Kung Fu Panda (2008, Annie's) == References == == External links == * Alessandro Carloni page * * Official Twitter Page Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:American directors Category:American animators Category:American animated film directors Category:American storyboard artists Category:Italian directors Category:Italian animated film directors Category:Italian animators ",
