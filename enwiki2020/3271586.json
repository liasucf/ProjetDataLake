    "text": "Acheron () was an American death/black metal band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that was formed by Vincent Crowley in 1988. The band is named after the mythological river Acheron ( \u2013 Akh\u00e9r\u014dn) located in the underground kingdom of Hades in ancient Greek mythology. ==History== Founded in 1988 by vocalist/bassist/songwriter Vincent Crowley (formerly of Nocturnus, and leader of the satanic youth group \"Order of the Evil Eye\"),Rivadavia, Eduardo \"[ Acheron Biography]\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation Acheron's musical output is almost exclusively Satanic and anti-Christian in content. Early albums featured interludes by Peter H. Gilmore. Crowley was appointed a priest in the Church of Satan by its founder, Anton Szandor LaVey, and began spending a lot of his time debating local televangelists, limiting Acheron's output for a time. He later disassociated himself from the church to act independently.Apicella, Vinnie \"Acheron \u2013 Tribute To The Devil's Music\" (review), Ink19 In 2003, the band released an album of cover versions, Tribute to the Devil's Music, including songs originally recorded by Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Kreator, and Celtic Frost. On April 26, 2010, Vincent Crowley announced that the band was calling it quits. On December 27, 2010, it was announced that Acheron have reunited. ==Members== === Current=== * Vincent Crowley - Guitars (1988\u20131991, 1996\u20131998, 2008), Vocals (1991\u2013present), Bass (1992\u2013present) * Art Taylor - Guitars (2009\u20132010, 2012\u2013present) * Shaun Cothron - Guitars (2011\u20132012, 2014\u2013present) * Brandon Howe - Drums (2014\u2013present) === Past === * David Smith Bass (1988\u20131991) * James Strauss Drums (1988\u20131992) * Peter H.
