    "text": "Political Desk () is a South Korean news program airing on JTBC. It has a lighthearted, sometimes satirical, approach to political events in South Korea. It is presented by Lee Sang-bok, with Cho Ik-shin, Shin Hye-won, , Choi Jong-hyuk and . It airs Monday to Friday at 17:00 KST. == History and format == === Origins === Kim Pil-kyu had the idea of producing a political newscast, and he drew a cartoon about it, which was posted on the show's official Twitter account. Originally called Report! Political Meeting at 4:00, it premiered on April 7, 2014. It was presented by Choi Sang-yeon, with Oh Dae- young, Yang Won-bo, Nam Gung-wook and Lee Sung-dae on the panel representing the ruling party, National Assembly, the Blue House, and the opposition, respectively. Kim initially produced this show before being tapped to produce and host JTBC Newsroom's Fact Check segment later that year. He then became the main anchor of the show's weekend edition following Jeon Jin-bae's departure. === Reshuffles === ==== 2015 ==== Starting July 2015, multiple reorganizations were held. Im So-ra replaced Blue House captain Nam Gung-wook on July 6, 2015. Opposition leader Lee Sung-dae followed suit 18 days later, and Kim Jung-ha joined as the new head of the National Assembly, replacing Yang Won-bo who moved to Lee's vacated position. Announcer Kang Ji-young also joined the show on July 13, 2015 as a fixed member, hosting the segment Kang Ji-young's Talk Shooting Politics. Yang then stepped down on September 24, leading Yoo Sang-wook to join as the show's new opposition leader. Lee Sang- bok joined the show as its new anchor/moderator on December 14, replacing Choi Sang-yeon, who joined JoongAng Ilbo as one of its new editorial writers. As of this reorganization, only Oh Dae-young was the original member to be on the show. It was later revamped to Political Desk around the end of the year. ==== 2016 ==== 2016 also saw multiple reshuffles on the captains' assignments. Oh Dae-young, the program's only remaining original member, stepped down on the broadcast on July 8, along with Kim Jung-ha who was then the head of the National Assembly. Yang Won-bo returned to his original role vacated by Kim on July 11, while Jung Kang-hyun replaces Oh who was the leader of the ruling party. Jung was the head of JoongAng Ilbo's youth reporting team before joining the program. Later that year, Yoo Sang-wook also departed from his role as opposition leader after he was appointed the head of Social Issues team 2. Choi Jong-hyuk replaces him starting December 21. ==== 2017 ==== The first reshuffle of the year happened following the 2017 South Korean presidential elections. Then-opposition leader Choi Jong-hyuk and then-ruling party leader Jung Kang-hyun swapped places on May 10, 2017 at Lee Sang-bok's request, making it the first power switch since the show's inception. According to National Assembly captain Yang Won-bo, Jung seemed bitter about giving up his position to Choi, who was the show's youngest member at the time. Another change in its set and graphics happened on November 6, 2017, which was used until May 15, 2020. Towards the end of the year, Shin Hye-won joins the show as its new Blue House captain, replacing Im So-ra who left the show on December 8. ==== 2018 ==== July 13 saw the introduction of new opposition leader Go Suk-seung, who replaced Jung Kang-hyun following his departure. This year also saw Lee Sang-bok ascend to his new role as JTBC News' press director on November 20, officially replacing his title as director of the second politics division on the broadcast subtitles. ==== 2020 ==== Park Sung-tae and Cho Ik-shin joined the cast on January 6, 2020, following the departure of Lee Sang-bok and Yang Won-bo. Lee left to focus more on his role as press director due to the 2020 South Korean legislative elections, while Yang became the new general manager for JTBC News' policy team. Park eventually left on May 15, 2020 after over four months of hosting the show. It also became the show's last broadcast to be anchored from the open studio inside Trust Building. Choi Jong-hyuk teased towards the end that Lee Sang-bok might be making his return to the show after he did a reverse triangle gesture that became popular and was used on its opening IDs during his tenure. Park will now be JTBC Newsroom's new weekend editor. In addition, they will be moving to a new studio inside Creation Hall just beside it, and the open studio they used will be demolished and returned to the Trust Building's lobby. Lee Sang-bok made his official return to the show on May 18, 2020, while also debuting the show's new set and graphics package. Kang Ji- young's sole segment Talk Shooting Politics was abolished on the same day and replaced with On-site Briefing, promoting her as the show's on-site captain. Lee's former segment One-cut Politics made a return on the same day, along with Shin's Political School returning on June 3, 2020. It also established two new segments for each captain slowly, starting with Shin Hye-won (Minute Call-Call, New World), Choi Jong-hyuk (Check It Out, A Song For Something), Cho Ik-shin (Oh My Gosh, What's Wrong With You, Cho's Unanswered Questions) and Go Suk-seung (Ancient People, go! go! Sing!). There is also Dajeonghwe Theater, a segment where the captains work together for a skit. Starting June 22, 2020, Yang Won-bo hosts the JTBC Newsroom segment Won-broadcast after netizens expressed their enthusiasm for Yang's multiple appearances in the show. The segment has him making fun of different stories, reminiscent of his old Political Desk segments. Starting on July 20, 2020, Yang becomes the first Political Desk member to have his own show with the premiere of 3:10 Relay. === Format === The show's format is more lighthearted in approach than its other newscasts such as JTBC Newsroom, however, it took a more serious turn as Park Sung-tae became anchor/moderator. It is presented in the style of a meeting, as if to plan for a broadcast. The captains sometimes add jokes in their respective presentations, and tease each other, including Lee Sang-bok. === Opening theme === The opening theme is Lee Seung-hwan's Solo War, from his 2010 album Dreamizer. When he appeared on the third season of Hidden Singer, he expressed interest in the format of Political Desk and decided to let them use the song. Lee picked the song himself because of its rock sound and lyrical meaning. == Segments == The fixed segments are those which appear regularly on the program, or are regular segments of the main anchor and field captain. The recurring segments are only added in by the captains for fun. === Current segments === ==== Fixed segments ==== * Opening/Today's Political Meeting - the anchor/moderator (currently Lee Sang-bok) will be briefed by the panel about the day's political news. There was an instance that then-Newsroom weekday anchors Sohn Suk-hee and Ahn Na-kyung, as well as former weekend anchors Kim Pil-kyu and Jeon Jin-bae, along with Scandal Supervisor host Park Sung-joon, were spotted in the lobby just outside the studio. Choi Jong-hyuk pointed it out when Lee Sang-bok asked him why he kept looking towards them. Despite that, Sohn and Ahn have been seen on the background multiple times. This was temporarily stopped during the network's special coverage on the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, and in the process, the segments each captain host were also affected. It eventually went back on April 20, 2020, along with Intensive Talk. Starting May 18, 2020, only one of the captains (including Kang Ji-young starting May 20, 2020) brief the anchor about their piece of the day, while the rest sit on their respective seats. This does not proceed when there is breaking news. Starting August 27, 2020, only Lee Sang- bok does the opening due to the recent rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. * Intensive Talk - the main segment where each reporter gives their respective presentations. Each of the reporters have similar focus, but different in styles. This is also where the captains add a segment they created for fun. In the absence of the four captains, other political reporters take their spot, while one of the four captains take over the anchor chair if the anchor is absent. *Kang Ji-young's On-site Briefing (\uac15\uc9c0\uc601\uc758 \ud604\uc7a5 \ube0c\ub9ac\ud551) - Kang Ji-young goes to interview people in this segment introduced on May 18, 2020. The debut of this segment was in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Gwangju Uprising. She was also declared Field Captain towards the end of the segment, with Lee Sang-bok presenting her the said badge. It is aired two times a week, but there are instances that it airs once a week (like on June 2, 2020 to give way for the 56th Baeksang Arts Awards). This is typically done on Mondays and Wednesdays. This corner is not done if Kang is absent. *Lee Sang-bok's One-cut Politics (\ubcf5 \uad6d\uc7a5\uc758 \ud55c \ucef7 \uc815\uce58) - similar to the segment 60 Second Preview, he presents major political news within one minute. It was abolished on January 7, 2019 and was eventually brought back on May 18, 2020 with his return to the show as his fixed segment. He goes to the other side of the set, presenting it beside a revolving monitor (which is also used by Morning&). ==== Recurring Intensive Talk segments ==== *Captain Shin's Minute Call-Call (\uc2e0 \ubc18\uc7a5\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2dcCallCall) - it is a segment introduced on May 19, 2020 where Shin Hye-won calls someone related to the issue presented that day before the broadcast, usually pre-recorded. It is a spiritual successor to Jung's Separated Gaze. Interim Blue House captain Ryu Jeong-hwa did a one-time parody of this segment, titled Captain Ryu's Minute Call-Call. *New World (\uc2e0 '\uc138\uacc4') - a segment where Blue House captain Shin Hye-won reports on international issues. The name is derived from a wordplay of her surname. It is a spiritual successor to Go's Global TMI. Interim Blue House captain Ryu Jeong-hwa did a one-time parody titled Ryu World, which is a pun on her surname and the English name of the segment. *Shin's Political School (\uc2e0 \ubc18\uc7a5\uc758 \uc815\uce58\uc2a4\ucfe8) - a segment where Blue House leader Shin Hye-won delivers what is happening in the Blue House as if in a classroom, showing her proficiency in teaching, as she holds a certificate in secondary education. This segment hasn't aired for a long time, so it was classified as abolished. However, Shin clarified on the show's June 3, 2020 broadcast that it was never abolished. *Shin's Unanswered Questions ('\uc2e0' \uc870\uac83\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\uc2f6\ub2e4) - this segment hosted by Shin Hye-won has the same format as Cho's Unanswered Questions. *New Normal Life - stylized as NEWNORMALLIFE, Shin Hye-won details about life in the new normal in this new segment introduced on September 15, 2020. *Check It Out (\ucd5c\ud0a4\ub77c\uc6c3) - a newly- introduced segment where ruling party captain Choi Jong-hyuk delves on a controversial story and reads reactions from the YouTube live chat. It seems to be a spiritual successor to Responding Affectionately. *Back in the Day (\ub77c\ub5bc\ub294 \ub9d0\uc774\uc57c) - Choi Jong-hyuk will pull out an old clip of Lee Sang-bok reporting a certain story (mostly from his stint reporting in Washington), and usually begins it with \ub0b4\uac00 \uadf8\uac74 \uc798 \uc544\ub294\ub370~ (which translates to \"I know that very well\"). *Captain Cho's Presentation (\uc870 \ubc18\uc7a5 \ubc1c\uc81c) - a segment where National Assembly leader Cho Ik-shin presents three to four news stories that can either be real events or rumors. *Oh My Gosh, What's Wrong With You? (\uc138\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc870\ub7f0\uc77c\uc774) - although not different from Captain Cho's Presentation and Yang's Interesting Politics, it deals with a part of Cho Ik-shin's presentation and asks what's wrong with it. *Cho's Unanswered Questions (\uc870\uac83\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\uc2f6\ub2e4) - a segment where Cho Ik-shin presents arguments ala-Spotlight. The name is derived from the popular SBS investigative journalism program of the same name. Blue House captain Shin Hye-won brought it back as Shin's Unanswered Questions ('\uc2e0' \uc870\uac83\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\uc2f6\ub2e4). *Ancient People (\uace0\ub54c \uace0 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4) - this Go Suk-seung segment is similar to Choi's Traveling Back in Time where he uncovers past events that are related to his presentation. Initially aired as a dry run on May 29, it became an official segment on June 1. Its debut as a recurring segment on June 3 featured fellow captain Shin Hye-won. The title is taken from the Korean name of the 2006 film The President's Last Bang. *go! Go Go Sing! (go! \uace0\uace0\uc2f1!) - originally named Go's Global TMI, He deals with news related to international politics instead of domestic politics. Go promised to deal with it one day at a time, but it appears two to three times a week. *Dajeonghwe Theater (\ub2e4\uc815\ud68c \uadf9\uc7a5) - this is a segment where the captains work together to do a skit designed to inform and educate viewers. Every single captain has done this in their presentations except for Cho Ik-shin, but he has appeared in the other captains' skits before. === Former segments === * Jung's Separated Gaze - in this segment, Jung Kang-hyun interviews a politician related to his presentation. * When Politics Meet Music - this was Jung Kang-hyun's only fixed segment before the reorganization, in which he uses his extensive knowledge as a cultural reporter, as well as his musical ability, to bring a musically appropriate side to a political story. He also uses poetry and quotes from novels. * Friday Tea Room - this segment is similar to the When Politics Meet Music segment above, where viewers selected songs that go along with their stories. Go Suk-seung revived this segment as Golden Friday Tea Room. * Politicians Eat Dinner Together - named after the JTBC variety show Let's Eat Dinner Together, Jung Kang-hyun interviews a politician while eating together. When Jung left the show, Kang Ji-young hosted this corner for a short while. * Asian Cup Meeting - a short-lived segment hosted by Yang Won-bo where he presents the latest happenings at the Asian Cup tournament. * Responding Affectionately - this was a segment where the cast answers questions from what viewers post on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and their official website. It is similar to Social Live, but was broadcast everyday as opposed to Social Live where it is broadcast every other day (currently broadcast on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays). * Today's Speech - this was a corner where the captains present their respective pieces briefly. It served as the newscast's opening. *Lee Sang-bok's 60 Second Preview - a segment where Lee Sang-bok presents major political stories within one minute, similar to One-cut Politics. * Yang's Interesting Politics - this was Yang Won-bo's recurring segment before he was replaced by Cho Ik-shin, and is the same with Captain Cho's Presentation. *Kang Ji-young's Talk Shooting Politics - the sole segment held by announcer Kang Ji-young, she deals with light political topics and other social issues. Originally planned to be a segment in-between topics, it now airs at the end of each meeting. On Fridays, this corner is omitted because of the shortened runtime. This segment did not air from February 21, 2020 to cater to news related to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, but eventually resumed airing on April 20, 2020. This corner doesn't air if Kang is absent. This segment has been officially replaced by Field Briefing starting May 18, 2020. *Choi's Traveling Back in Time - a segment that shows past events related to ruling party leader Choi Jong-hyuk's article that day. It is similar to JTBC Newsrooms On This Day and SBS 8 News Today in History, although different in approach. The two segments show historical events that happened on a certain day, while Choi's segment focuses on the presentation and the events related to the story that day. *Chief Choi is Coming - a segment that shows Choi Jong- hyuk reporting breaking news. However, it is difficult to gather information and produce it like a news report. The two segments have officially been replaced by Check It Out and A Song for Something. *Go's Global TMI - TMI stands for too much issue instead of too much information on this segment headed by Go Suk-seung. He deals with news related to international politics instead of domestic politics. Go promised to deal with it one day at a time, but it appears two to three times a week. It is succeeded by New World. It was reestablished on July 29, 2020 with the name go! Go Go Sing! *Golden Friday Tea Room - on behalf of former opposition leader Jung Kang-hyun, Go Suk-seung brought back this corner where the panel interviews guests, mostly politicians. *Tea Party Hotline/Tea Party Invitation - this segment is not limited to one captain, but a corner in which someone conducts an interview via phone during the meeting. It is succeeded by Minute Call-Call. *A Song For Something (\ucd5c \ubc18\uc7a5\uc758 '\ud560\ub9d0\uc788\uc1a1') - a new Friday-only segment where Choi Jong-hyuk asks viewers to select a song to be played within the show. It seems to be a reincarnation of Friday Tea Room and When Politics Meet Music. This segment was suspended due to the 56th Baeksang Arts Awards, but was not brought back even when the show proceeded as usual. It is the last music-related corner of the program. *The North Now (\uc774 \uc2dc\uac01 \ub178\uc2a4(NORTH)\ub8f8) - a segment where Shin Hye-won delivers news about North Korea that parodies the 5-minute newscast Newsroom Now. It was abolished after only one episode. == Presenters == The current cast since May 18, 2020.
