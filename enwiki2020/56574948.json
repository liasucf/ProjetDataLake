They were joined by Hei\u00f0a Eriksson in 1994. The group split up in July 1999. ==Biography== The group was formed in 1993 by guitarist \u00de\u00f3r Eldon J\u00f3nsson (formerly Fan Houtens Koko, of The Sugarcubes, aka Thor Eldon, and former husband of Bj\u00f6rk), bassist Gunnar L\u00e1rus Hj\u00e1lmarsson (Dr. Gunni, former SH Draumur, ex-Bless). The name appeared during a game of Scrabble. They were then joined by Kristin on vocals, then the trio goes back to Gunni's apartment. On April 1 , 1994, they began recording their first studio album, titled \u00c6. During their sessions, the singer Hei\u00f0a Eriksson becomes a member of the group. In November 1994, their first album was released on the label Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson (formerly of Daisy Hill Puppy Farm), co-produces and plays keyboards on this album. In the spring of 1995 , the Icelandic lyrics of \u00c6 are translated into English and the English version, Super Shiny Dreams, is released on the Bad Taste label in November 1995 in the United States and Europe.. Bj\u00f6rk is supported by Unun for three British dates, including an appearance at Wembley Arena in January 1996. In 1997, the group participates in the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. In 1998, the group lost its contract with the label Deceptive, but managed to publish a four-track EP called Bones. Thor performs his last concert with Unun at the Midt Fyn Festival. Back in Iceland, the band records their second album, \u00d3tta, with Birna on keyboards, Viddi (ex- Quarashi) on bass, and Doddi (Kanada) on drums. The following year Unun toured Norway, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland. The group split up in July 1999.
