    "text": "Troglocambarus is a monotypic genus of troglobitic crayfish, endemic to Florida. Troglocambarus maclanei is found underground in Hernando, Marion, Alachua, Columbia, Gilchrist and Suwanee counties, and is named after Mr. William A. McLane who first collected it. Troglocambarus is believed to be the sister group to Procambarus. It is only found in subterranean waters and was first recorded in Squirrel Chimney, 11 miles north-west of Gainesville, Florida. T. maclanei has no body pigment and spends most of its life upside- down, hanging from the ceiling of a cave. It is distinguished from other genera by the great enlargement of the third maxillipeds. It is unknown what T. maclanei feeds on. Troglocambarus maclanei is listed as \"imperiled\" by NatureServe, and as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List. ==References== Category:Cambaridae Category:Endemic fauna of Florida Category:Freshwater crustaceans of North America Category:Cave crayfish Category:Monotypic crustacean genera Category:Crustaceans described in 1942 Category:Taxa named by Horton H.
