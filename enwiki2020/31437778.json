He was born at N\u00eemes, the son of Samuel B\u00e9n\u00e9dite and Isabelle B\u00e9n\u00e9dite born Lisbonne, whose second husband George Lafenestre (1837\u20131919), was a noted poet, art critic and curator of the Louvre, who helped raise the young Georges Aaron. Georges Aaron himself became a curator at the Louvre in the Department of Egyptology in 1907. B\u00e9n\u00e9dite is noted for his discovery of the tomb of Akhethetep at Saqqara on 28 March 1903. The chapel of Akhethotep, now in the Louvre was brought back by B\u00e9n\u00e9dite as was customary for egyptologists at the time. B\u00e9n\u00e9dite excavated several tombs in the Valley of the Kings, such as KV41 in 1900. He is one of the first to propose the existence of theater in ancient Egypt The tombs of Georges Aaron B\u00e9n\u00e9dite and Georges Lafenestre (French poet) in the cemetery of Bourg-la- Reine. B\u00e9n\u00e9dite is also known for his buying for the Louvre the Gebel el-Arak Knife from private antique dealer M. Nahman in Cairo in February 1914. B\u00e9n\u00e9dite immediately recognized the extraordinary state of preservation of the artefact as well as his archaic datation. On 16 March 1914, he writes to Charles Boreux, then head of the d\u00e9partement des Antiquit\u00e9s \u00e9gyptiennes of the Louvre about the knife an unsuspecting antique dealer presented him: B\u00e9n\u00e9dite died in Luxor, Egypt, shortly after visiting the tomb of Tutankhamun, further adding to the legend of the curse of the pharaoh. His body was brought back to France and was buried in the family vault in the cemetery of Bourg-la-Reine in the Hauts-de-Seine. ==Publications== * \u00c9gypte, Paris, Hachette, 1900, in three volumes, comprises 7 maps, 104 plans, 54 illustrations and 22 synoptic tables. ==References== ==External links== *Extensive biography, in french Category:French Egyptologists Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres Category:People from N\u00eemes Category:1857 births Category:1926 deaths ",
