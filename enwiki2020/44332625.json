He then briefly joined the National Party in 1917, then the Conservatives. During a parliamentary debate on the bill which became the Representation of the People Act 1918, he opposed the extension of the voting franchise: > \"There are obvious disadvantages about having women in Parliament. I do not > know what is going to be done about their hats. How is a poor little man to > get on with a couple of women wearing enormous hats in front of him?\" Hunt was also antisemitic, believing a Jewish plutocracy was secretly conspiring to subvert political life.Jay P. Corrin, Catholic Intellectuals and the Challenge of Democracy (University of Notre Dame Pess, 2002) He died at Lindley Green, Broseley, Shropshire, in November 1943 aged 85. ==References== == External links == * Category:1858 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for constituencies in Shropshire Category:People from Ludlow Category:Liberal Unionist Party MPs for English constituencies Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1900\u20131906 Category:UK MPs 1906\u20131910 Category:UK MPs 1910 Category:UK MPs 1910\u20131918 Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Magdalene College, Cambridge Category:British Army personnel of the Second Boer War Category:Lovat Scouts officers Category:City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) officers ",
