    "text": "Luxulyan railway station serves the civil parish and village of Luxulyan in mid-Cornwall, England. The station is situated on the Atlantic Coast Line, measured from . Great Western Railway manage the station and operates all the trains that call. ==History== The first railway at Luxulyan was a horse-worked line from Par Harbour to Molinnis which was built by Joseph Treffry, opening on 18 May 1847. It climbed up the side of the Luxulyan Valley on a cable- worked incline and then crossed it on the Treffry Viaduct. On 1 June 1874 a new line was opened by the Cornwall Minerals Railway. Running from Fowey to Newquay, it bypassed the incline, instead passing beneath the Treffry Viaduct and entering Luxulyan through the 50 yard (46m) Luxulyan Tunnel. The tramway was retained from Luxulyan over the Treffry Viaduct to a quarry at Colcerrow until about 1933. A passenger service was introduced on 20 June 1876 when a station was provided at Bridges, which was renamed \"Luxulyan\" 1 May 1905. The passing loop was lengthened in 1910 and again on 10 May 1936. The two original platforms were replaced by an island platform between the tracks as part of the 1910 alterations. A camping coach was kept in the goods yard for several years for hiring out to tourists who arrived by train. A new siding to serve the Treskilling China Clay Works was opened in 1916. This survived until 1975 but the public goods yard closed on 27 September 1964, as did the connection to the stub of the Colcerrow branch east of the station. The passing loop and the second platform face were taken out of use at the same time. ==Description== There is a single platform on the east side of the track which has a shelter and seats. At the southern end of this is the car park which connects to a small lane that leads to the village's main road. This lane crosses over the railway on a stone bridge a short distance south of the platform. The station has a solar powered help point which allows waiting people to find out when the next trains will arrive. ==Services== Luxulyan is a request stop on the line, so passengers wishing to alight must inform the conductor and passengers wishing to join the train must signal to the driver. The typical service is one train every two hours in each direction between Par and Newquay, with some services extending to Plymouth and one train in the summer extending to Penzance. On summer Saturdays, there is just one train per day in each direction due to the intercity services running through to Newquay in lieu of the local services. Trains are usually operated by Class 150 Sprinters. ==Community rail== The trains between Par and Newquay are designated as a community rail service and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The line is promoted under the Atlantic Coast Line name. The Kings Arms pub in Luxulyan is part of the Atlantic Coast Line rail ale trail. ==References== * * * ==External links== *LuxSoft: Derailment of a High Speed Train in the Valley Category:Railway stations in Cornwall Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1876 Category:Railway stations served by Great Western Railway Category:Railway request stops in Great Britain ",
