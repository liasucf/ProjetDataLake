It is based in the heart of the Massey design campus in the Old Museum Building off Buckle Street. It is a department of the Massey Wellington Students' Association (aka MAWSA) who partly fund the station, hence its ability to remain commercial free. The station brings in extra money through show sponsorship so it can continue to grow and to run events around Wellington. == References == Category:Student radio stations in New Zealand Category:Mass media in Wellington ",
