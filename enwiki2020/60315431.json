Two girls work together to uncover the truth about their captivity. ==Premise== An isolated and windowless boarding school teaches young girls to be 'clean' and proper. They are schooled in health and etiquette. However, two residents, Sophia and Vivien, become suspicious about the school's intentions after witnessing the late night behavior of security guards and the headmistress. They learn that they are not in a school for girls, instead, they are raised so rich \"sponsors\" can get the faces of these young girls transplanted onto their own heads, to make them appear more youthful. After learning of this by encountering the faceless body of another girl, they make plans to escape, despite being told that the air outside the school is toxic. ==Cast== * Katie Douglas as Vivien * Celina Martin as Sophia * Peter Outerbridge as Dr. Miro * Sara Canning as Miss Brixil * Sara DaSilva as young Vivien * Lori Phun as young Sofia == Production == Filming took place in a retired police station in Toronto that was built in the 1930s.
