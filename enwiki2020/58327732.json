Her 2008 debut album 19, which peaked at number-one on its initial release, also re-entered the top 10 this year, this time reaching number two. Following her death in July, Amy Winehouse's second album Back to Black returned to number- one. Meanwhile, her debut album Frank entered the top 10 for the first time, peaking at number three. Her posthumous compilation album Lioness: Hidden Treasures reached the top spot in December. The UK Albums Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best- selling albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Since 2004 the chart has been based on the sales of both physical albums and digital downloads. This list shows albums that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart during 2011, as well as albums which peaked in 2010 and 2012 but were in the top 10 in 2011. The entry date is when the album appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced). One-hundred and fifty-three albums were in the top ten this year. One album from 2009 and nineteen albums from 2010 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while Stereo Typical by Rizzle Kicks was released in 2011 but did not reach its peak until 2012. Every Kingdom by Ben Howard debuted this year but its peak position was not until two years later in 2013. Loud by Rihanna, Sigh No More by Mumford & Sons, The Beginning by The Black Eyed Peas and The Lady Killer by CeeLo Green were the albums from 2010 to reach their peak in 2011. Twelve artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 2011. Drake, Ed Sheeran, Jessie J, Matt Cardle, One Direction and Rizzle Kicks were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 album in 2011. The 2010 Christmas number-one album, Progress by Take That, remained at the top spot for the first week of 2011. The first new number-one album of the year was Loud by Rihanna. Overall, twenty-five different albums peaked at number-one in 2011, with Amy Winehouse (2) having the most albums hitting that position. ==Background== ===Multiple entries=== One-hundred and fifty-three albums charted in the top 10 in 2011, with one-hundred and thirty-five albums reaching their peak this year (including 19, All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra, Back to Black, Frank and Nevermind, which charted in previous years but reached a peak on their latest chart run). Twelve artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 2011. Amy Winehouse and Glee Cast both had four top 10 albums in 2011. Adele, Alfie Boe, Daniel O'Donnell, JLS, Kate Bush, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Olly Murs, Rihanna, Susan Boyle and The Wanted were the acts who had two top 10 albums this year. Alfie Boe, Daniel O'Donnell and Kate Bush's two entries were both released this year, with Frank by Amy Winehouse returning after missing the top 10 when it was first released in 2003 and 19 by Adele and Back to Black by Amy Winehouse both returning after making the top ten before. ===Chart debuts=== Thirty-eight artists achieved their first top 10 album in 2011 as a lead artist.
