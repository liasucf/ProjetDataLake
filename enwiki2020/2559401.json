He is famous for capturing the Prussian capital Berlin during the Seven Years' War. ==Early life== Andr\u00e1s Hadik, son of a lesser noble family, was born on October 16, 1710, in Csall\u00f3k\u00f6z (then Kingdom of Hungary, now \u017ditn\u00fd ostrov in Slovakia) or in K\u0151szeg, Kingdom of Hungary.

According to another source, he was of Hungarian ethnic origin, but the name \"Hadik\" is a diminutive from the Slovak appellative had (\"snake\"), the family was thus of Slovak extraction. Alternative theories also suggest his Tartar or Cherkess ancestry.In remembrance of Andr\u00e1s Hadik , Military Intelligence Office of Republic of Hungary His father, Mih\u00e1ly Hadik was a cavalryman. His mother, Franciska Hardy had a German background. Andr\u00e1s Hadik volunteered for the Ghil\u00e1nyi Hussar regiment when he was 20, and at 22 he was given the rank of officer and became the standard bearer in the Dessewffy Hussar regiment in the Habsburg army. Hadik fought in the War of the Polish Succession (1733\u20131738) and the Austro-Turkish War, 1737-1739. In 1738 Hadik was promoted to the rank of captain. ==Military successes== During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740\u20131748) he gained fame for his actions against the Prussians at the city of Neisse (Nysa, now Poland) using surprise attacks and tricks under the unwritten laws of the so-called \"small war,\" relying on the excellent training of his light cavalry hussars. During the war he served under Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1744 he gained the rank of Commanding Colonel of his own hussar regiment, then near the end of the war in 1747 he attained the rank of General and was appointed commander of a cavalry brigade. Early in the Seven Years' War (1756\u20131763), Hadik executed the most famous hussar action in history: when the Prussian King Frederick was marching south with his powerful armies, the Hungarian general unexpectedly swung his 5,000 force of mostly hussars around the Prussians and took their capital Berlin. The city was spared for a negotiated ransom of 300,000 thalers, which he distributed among his troops. For this feat, Hadik was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal. He was also awarded the Gro\u00dfkreuz of the Maria Theresia Order. ==Legacy== Slovak National Academy of Defense of Marshal Andrej Had\u00edk (2004\u20132008) was named after him. * Andr\u00e1s Hadik.
