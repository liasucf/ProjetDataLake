Shaw works with independent publishers and he has created small editions of several photographic series include: Retrospecting Sandy Hill (2015morelboks),Life as a Night Porter (Twinpalms\u20132006), Weeds of Wallasey (superlabo2012), horizon icons(adad publishers) (2015), Tokyo in HK (with Tokyo Rummando, (zenphoto2017), The Hunter gets captured by the game (Zenphoto2019). Writing in The Daily Telegraph, journalist John Preston said, \"Shaw remains an evasive, almost blurry character who seems to belong in the shadows and who can't bear being stuck in one place for too long.\" His working practice is mostly negative based, and heavily worked hand printed archival fibre-based black and white or colour prints. He believes in a physical contact between the materials and the photographer that produces them to form a photograph. His subjects range from night life to Landscape. ==Publications== ===Publications by Shaw=== *Life as a Night Porter. Santa Fe, NM: Twin Palms, 2006. .
