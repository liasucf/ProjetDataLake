It specialised in cross-Channel ferry flights carrying cars and their owners between its numerous bases in Southern England, the Channel Islands and Continental Europe. All-passenger and all-cargo flights were operated as well. Following several identity and ownership changes, it went out of business in 2001. In its final years, as British World Airlines, its head office was at Viscount House, London Southend Airport.\"How to Contact Us.\" British World Airlines. 7 May 1999. Retrieved on 17 February 2019. ==History== BUAF came into being on 1 January 1963 as a result of the merger of Channel Air Bridge and Silver City Airways.British United Air Ferries, Air Commerce, Flight International, 26 July 1962, p. 117British Air Ferries Ltd. (BAF), Flight International, 11 December 1975, p. 843Aircraft (Gone but not forgotten ... SILVER CITY), Vol 43, No 3, p. 44, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, January 2010 The newly formed airline was a wholly owned subsidiary of Air Holdings, which in turn was a subsidiary of British & Commonwealth (B&C;). This ownership structure made BUAF a sister airline of British United Airways (BUA), at the time Britain's biggest independent airline and the country's leading independent scheduled operator. BUAF operated scheduled and non-scheduled vehicle ferry, passenger and freight services. This included scheduled routes from Southend, Lydd Ferryfield and Hurn to ten points in the Channel Islands and Continental Europe. Aviation Traders Carvairs operated what the airline called \"deeper penetration\" routes to Basle, Geneva and Strasbourg. Bristol Superfreighters plied the routes to Jersey, Guernsey, Cherbourg, Le Touquet, Calais, Ostend and Rotterdam. The airline's scheduled services between the UK, Le Touquet and Ostend formed part of rail-air operations linking the respective capital cities at each end. These were operated in conjunction with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer fran\u00e7ais (SNCF) and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de fer Belges/Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen (SNCB/NMBS), the respective national railway companies of France and Belgium. (Amongst these, was a six-times daily Southend\u2014Ostend vehicle ferry service operated in conjunction with erstwhile Belgian flag carrier Sabena. This service, which had been launched by Air Charter in partnership with Sabena in 1957 with three dedicated Superfreighters in full Sabena livery and which BUAF had inherited from Channel Air Bridge, continued until 1964.Airliner Classics (SABENA \u2013 Belgium's Flag Carrier: Post-War Years), p. 63, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, July 2013) Coach-air services were provided in conjunction with local coach operators between the UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland via Calais, Ostend, Rotterdam and Basle. In addition, all-passenger configured Bristol Freighters/Superfreighters were used for inclusive tour work on behalf of BUA (Services) Ltd.

Some of the new Southampton routes were part of rail-air operations in conjunction with the French and Belgian national railway companies as well.British Airline Survey ...

incident.British United Air Ferries at the Aviation Safety Network Database On 24 September 1963, a Bristol 170 Superfreighter Mark 32 (registration: G-AMWA) was damaged beyond repair in a takeoff accident at Guernsey Airport.Aviation Safety Network > ASN Aviation Safety Database > Operator index > United Kingdom > British United Air Ferries Operating a scheduled passenger flight to Bournemouth, the Bristol 170 was preparing for takeoff from Guernsey Airport's runway 28. The first officer, who was flying the aircraft used full power to counteract the effects of a crosswind. Due to a problem with the port engine the First officer decided to abort takeoff as speed approached 80 knots. As the aircraft was going to overshoot the end of the runway he steered it to the left to avoid hitting obstacles. The aircraft became airborne for a short distance, crashing through the airport boundary fence, crossing a public road and coming to a halt a quarter of a mile from the runway end. Although the aircraft was a complete write-off, there were no fatalities among the four occupants (three crew and one passenger). The accident investigators established the probable cause of the accident as the inability of the pilot in command to bring the aircraft to a stop within the remaining runway length, following his decision to abandon the takeoff due to a malfunction of the port engine, .ASN Aircraft accident description Bristol 170 Superfreighter 32 G-AMWA \u2014 Guernsey Airport (GCI) The company suffered two non-fatal incidents during the British Air Ferries era.British Air Ferries at the Aviation Safety Network Database Vickers Viscount 806 G-APIM Viscount Stephen Piercey,named after Flight International magazine's former staff photographer Stephen Piercey who died on 20 May 1984 in a mid-air collision during an assignment at the Hanover Air Show was hit on 11 January 1988 by a Fairflight Shorts 330 (registration: G-BHWT), which had suffered a nosegear brake and steering failure while preparing to take off from Southend Airport to Fairflight's Biggin Hill base. The collision destroyed the left-hand side of the Viscount's nose. Although the aircraft was deemed damaged beyond economical repair, it was subsequently restored and put on display at the Brooklands Museum.ASN Aircraft accident description Vickers Viscount 806 G-APIM \u2014 Southend Municipal Airport (SEN) The final two recorded incidents occurred during the British World period. One of these involved fatalities.British World Airlines at the Aviation Safety Network Database On 25 February 1994, a BWA Vickers Viscount 813 (registration: G-OHOT) operating an all-cargo flight from Edinburgh to Coventry encountered severe icing conditions en route. This caused the no. 2 engine to fail and its propeller to autofeather while the aircraft had begun its descent from flight level (FL) 150. During that time, the no. 3 engine started losing power as well. In response air traffic control immediately cleared the flightdeck crew to descend to FL070 and thereafter, FL050. The crew attempted to restart the no. 2 and 3 engines but when this proved futile, they elected to divert to Birmingham. The crew did manage to restart the no. 2 engine but this was followed by failure of no. 4. Five minutes short of Birmingham, the aircraft lost all electrical power and as a result radio navigation and intercom. The aircraft struck trees on southwest of Uttoxeter, causing it to break up and kill one of the two pilots.ASN Aircraft accident description Vickers Viscount 813 G-OHOT \u2014 7.5 km/4.7 mi southwest of UttoxeterIcing blamed for Viscount crash, Air Transport, Flight International, 9\u201315 March 1994, p. 12 The official accident investigation report of the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) identified the several factors as the likely cause: # Multiple engine failures were a consequence of extreme icing conditions. # The flightdeck crew's failure to complete the emergency drills as a result of not referring to the emergency checklist prejudiced their chances of restarting the engines successfully. # The crew's actions to secure and restart the failed engines, which did not comply with the operator's procedures, restricted the power that was available. # The drag induced by the failed engines' unfeathered propellers and the weight increase suffered by the heavily iced airframe caused a loss of height and control before reaching the diversion airfield. # The crew had no contingency plan to avoid the forecast severe icing conditions and was unaware of the relative position of a closer diversion airfield that could have been chosen by using ATC services more effectively. This constituted poor crew resource management, which reduced the potential for emergency planning, decision making and workload sharing.Air Accidents Investigation Branch \u2014 Report No: 3/1995.
