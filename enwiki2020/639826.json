    "text": "Schubert Dip is the debut album by British rock band EMF, released on Parlophone Records on 7 May 1991. It features the worldwide hit single \"Unbelievable\" which reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The name of the album is a pun on the name of the popular sweet sherbet dip and the 19th-century composer Franz Schubert. == Critical reception == Alex Henderson of AllMusic gave the album three stars out of five, feeling that overall it was not as good as the standout single \"Unbelievable\": \"The only song that comes close to packing the punch of 'Unbelievable' is the intoxicating 'Long Summer Days'. For the most part, Schubert Dip is a prime example of an album that is simply decent when it should have been excellent.\" == Track listing == All songs written and composed by James Atkin, Derry Brownson, Mark Decloedt, Ian Dench & Zac Foley, except where noted. # \"Children\" \u2013 5:15 # \"Long Summer Days\" \u2013 4:00 # \"When You're Mine\" (Dench) \u2013 3:22 # \"Travelling Not Running\" (Dench) \u2013 4:20 # \"I Believe\" \u2013 3:43 # \"Unbelievable\" 3:29 # \"Girl of an Age\" \u2013 3:56 # \"Admit It\" (Dench) \u2013 3:28 # \"Lies\" (Dench) \u2013 4:27 (4:19 on reissue) # \"Longtime\" \u2013 4:25 (original length was 8:10, as it included \"EMF\" as a hidden track) # \"EMF\" (Live at the Bilson) \u2013 3:54 (hidden track on the original, later listed separately on reissue) Note *The track \"Lies\" on the first pressings of Schubert Dip originally began with a sample of the voice of John Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman, reciting the first two lines of the lyrics to Lennon's \"Watching the Wheels\". Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, objected to this sample and as a result all subsequent pressings of the album have omitted the sample of Chapman's voice. *The Hungarian speech at the beginning of the track \"Travelling Not Running\": \"\" (\"It is impossible to harm the oppositionist, the final result will decide it\".) The person was Berecz J\u00e1nos, a Hungarian Communist Party politician at the end of the Iron Curtain era. Sample credits *\"Unbelievable\" includes samples of US comedian Andrew Dice Clay throughout the track. *The song \"Girl of an Age\" contains a sample of the character Ernie from Sesame Street speaking to his friend Bert. *The song \"Longtime\" contains a sample of a reading of The Hollow Men by T. S. Eliot. == Personnel == EMF *James Atkin \u2013 vocals, guitars *Derry Brownson \u2013 keyboards, samples *Mark Decloedt \u2013 drums *Ian Dench \u2013 keyboards and guitars *Zac Foley \u2013 bass Additional personnel *DJ Milf \u2013 turntables, scratching & samples on \"When You're Mine\" & \"Unbelievable\" *Claudia Fontaine \u2013 backing vocals on \"Children\", \"I Believe\", \"Girl of an Age\" & \"Lies\" *Sindy Finn & Laurane McIntosh \u2013 backing vocals on \"Travelling Not Running\" *Mastering by George Marino at Sterling Sound, NYC == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart !Position |- |Australian Albums (ARIA) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|44 |- |New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 |- |UK Albums (Official Charts Company) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |US Billboard 200 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|12 |} == References == Category:EMF (band) albums Category:1991 debut albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Parlophone albums ",
