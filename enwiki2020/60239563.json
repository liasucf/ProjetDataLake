    "text": "Gable Lake is a small lake located in Navarre, Florida. The lake is primarily fed by a number of small unnamed creeks on the south shore. Subsequently, the lake outflows into the East Bay River and the East Bay via a small unnamed stream. Due to the lack of a GNIS entry on the body of water, the name of the lake is not official. However, the name is used by those living on the lake, as exemplified by the name of the road that semi-circumnavigates the pond, \"Gable Lake Road.\" == See also == * Arachno Creek * East Bay * East Bay River * Navarre, Florida * William's Creek == References == Category:Navarre, Florida Category:Bodies of water of Santa Rosa County, Florida Category:Lakes of Florida ",
