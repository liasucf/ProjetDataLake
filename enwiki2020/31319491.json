Raghavan Iyer.SIFA recording, 1988 In 1970 he gave his mridangam arangetram.SIFA recording, 1988 In the early 1970s he began playing Carnatic music on the guitar and in 1981 he was honored by the Music Academy, Madras for having adapted the western instrument guitar to Carnatic.SIFA recording, 1988 A cassette exists of him from 1985 playing several Carnatic standards, including one of the compositions for which he became renowned, \"Brova Barama.\" It is currently out of print.

It is learnt that he had associated himself with the Adi Parasakthi Peetam in Melmaruvattur, Chennai.He was with Price Water House, Chennai. ==Disappearance== The details of Prasad's disappearance from the Carnatic music scene are hazy at best, and many famed artists and scholars are unfamiliar with his contribution to Carnatic music. He toured the U.S. in 1988 and in Australia in 1989, but sometime shortly after he disappeared from the music scene. Poovalur Sriji, mridangam artist and professor at the University of North Texas postulated that, \"One reason I think is he was too trendy for the 1970's conservative audience. Institutions like the Academy won't (sic) give him stage as he was not [as] 'traditional' as Emani Sankara Sastry and Chitti Babu were since they used contact microphones....I have accompanied him in many concerts, most of them wedding events.\" ==Education== Sukumar Prasad received a degree from the AC College of Technology, Madras. ==References== ==External links== * Guitarist Prasanna's history of the Carnatic guitar * Prasad's rendition of Brova Barama Category:Carnatic instrumentalists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Indian film score composers ",
