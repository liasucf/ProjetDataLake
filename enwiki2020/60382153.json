The corps and the 14th Fortified Region were headquartered at P\u00e4rnu, while the 196th was at Aina\u017ei and the 189th at Kodara. While on garrison duty, the corps conducted combat training in preparation for participation in the blockade of the Courland Pocket. The 189th and the 196th would remain with the corps for the rest of the war. Transferring the 14th Fortified Region and its defensive sector to the direct subordination of the army headquarters, the corps made a march of between 170 to 200 kilometers to Riga between 16 and 19 February 1945 to hold defensive positions on Riga Bay. The 189th was headquartered in the artillery barracks in \u010ciekurkalns, the 196th in the western part of Riga, and the corps at Vecm\u012blgr\u0101vis. Between 10 and 12 April the two rifle divisions turned over their sectors to three separate machine gun artillery battalions in order to conduct battalion-level training at the army training center. On the night of 16\u201317 April they marched to new concentrations areas southwest of Riga, with the 196th holding positions from Mellu\u017ei southwest to Mezakakts and the Spro\u0123is forest, and the 189th from Plostmui\u017ea and the forests south of the latter west to Virknes and Sumragi.

In its new positions, the corps continued combat training. During the month, the 67th Army was reinforced by two more rifle corps. === Courland Pocket === The corps planned for an operation to break through the German line between Rasas and the Abava river, defended by the 81st Infantry Division, from 25 April. On the night of 6\u20137 May, the German troops began withdrawing from the defensive line towards the north and northwest, covered by small rearguard detachments. On the morning of 7 May, the 196th was directly subordinated to the army command. As a result of the German withdrawal, the corps began advancing on 10:00 on 7 May in the second echelon of the army, behind the 377th Rifle Division. By the end of the day, the 382nd had reached the line of Pampji and the south bank of the ravine 700 meters north of Tyuti to the west of the 189th, which reached the area of K\u016blaini and Jahthaus; the corps' positions were roughly 2 kilometers south of the German rearguard at Bluiskas. At 24:00, the 377th, which had advanced to a line between Irlava Manor and R\u0113pi\u0146i, was operationally subordinated to the corps. During the night of 7\u20138 May, the corps' assault battalions pursued the German rearguard from Bluiskas to the line of Kalninkas and Jaunmokas Manor to the west of Tukums, where they encountered the most organized resistance. Dislodging the German rearguard, the corps continued to advance and by the end of the day on 8 May the 377th had reached Vilksalu manor to the northwest of Tukums after three German battalions surrendered to it. To the west, the 189th's forward units were between two kilometers southwest of Vilksalu manor and B\u0101li\u0146i, and on the corps' left flank the 382nd was at S\u0113rmu\u013ci and Skrimbas. The German forces opposing the corps refused to accept battle and began a general surrender at 24:00. The corps, with the 189th and 196th Divisions, marched to the area of Talsi and Dundaga on 9 and 10 May to collect and disarm the surrendered German forces of the 207th Security Division and other units of Army Group Courland. The 196th was near Talsi and the 189th near Dundaga by the end of 10 May, and the corps headquarters was at Talsi from 9 May. The 377th and 382nd were directly subordinated to the army headquarters on 9 May. Until 12 May, the two divisions supervised the disarmament and the collection of weapons and equipment, handed over by the German commanders. The German prisoners of war were held in divisional POW camps, and then sent to L\u012bvb\u0113rze via Talsi and Tukums. == Postwar == In August 1945, the corps was withdrawn from Latvia to the Voronezh Military District, where it was headquartered at Voronezh. The 189th and 382nd Rifle Divisions were located at Voronezh, while the 196th was at Borisoglebsk. The corps was disbanded in January 1946, still under Rozhdestvensky's command.
