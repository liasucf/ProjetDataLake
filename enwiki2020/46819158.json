    "text": "Lost in Worship is the first studio album by Fusebox. Elevate Records alongside Inpop Records released the album on February 26, 2002. ==Critical reception== Awarding the album three stars for Christianity Today, Russ Breimeier writes, \"Fusebox manages to stand apart in the glutted modern- worship-band market \u2026 but perhaps not for the reasons they'd like.\" Kevin Breuner, giving the album a B at CCM Magazine, states, \"Those seeking to add more modern praise & worship music to their collection will enjoy Lost in Worship.\" Rating the album a six out of ten from Cross Rhythms, Trevor Kirk says, \"A promising debut\". John DiBiase, indicating in a three and a half star review by Jesus Freak Hideout, describes, \"A good debut with joyful worship tunes to take the listener to a higher place\". Signaling in a three out of five review for The Phantom Tollbooth, Zik Jackson writes, \"Lost in Worship is a passionate, heartfelt collection of both new and familiar tunes.\" ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2002 debut albums Category:Inpop Records albums ",
