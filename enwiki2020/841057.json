Yellow grease, also termed used cooking oil (UCO), used vegetable oil (UVO), recycled vegetable oil, or waste vegetable oil (WVO) is recovered from businesses and industry that use the oil for cooking. It is used to feed livestock, and to manufacture soap, make-up, clothes, rubber, and detergents.Murphy, Denis J. Plant lipids: biology, utilization, and manipulation. Wiley-Blackwell, 2005, p. 117. Due to competition from these other industrial sectors, the EIA estimates that less than a third of yellow grease could be spared for biodiesel production annually.Radich, Anthony Biodiesel Performance, Costs, and Use It is distinct from brown grease; yellow grease is typically used frying oils from deep fryers, whereas brown grease is sourced from grease interceptors.Brown Grease Feedstocks for Biodiesel.
