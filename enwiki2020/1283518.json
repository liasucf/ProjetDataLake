    "text": "Caridina multidentata is a species of shrimp in the family Atyidae. It is native to Japan and Taiwan.De Grave, S., Shy, J. & Cai, X. 2013. Caridina multidentata. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2013. Downloaded on 14 June 2016. Its common names include Yamato shrimp, Japanese shrimp, Amano shrimp, and algae shrimp.Fransen, C. (2015). Caridina multidentata Stimpson, 1860. Accessed through World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) on 14 June 2016. ==Description== This species has a translucent body covered with a broken line of reddish brown points on its sides. The dorsal surface has a white stripe that runs from the head to the tail and the eyes are black. Females are easily distinguished from males by their more elongated lower row of dots. Caridina multidentata fare best in temperatures of 18\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C. They are more active at higher temperatures, but may also have a shorter lifespan. They prefer a pH of 6.5 to 7.5. As with all crustaceans, they are extremely averse to copper due to their haemocyanin blood. Caridina multidentata mate in freshwater streams and marshes. Female shrimp signal readiness to mate much like other shrimp species, by releasing pheromones into the water for the males to follow. The fertilized eggs are released and go through larval stages in brackish and salt water as they drift out to sea. The larvae return from the sea once they reach their final growth stage, and they remain in freshwater for the remainder of their lives. ==In captivity== left According to different sources, Caridina multidentata was introduced into the world of aquaria by Takashi Amano in the early 1980s. They are usually used in an aquarium because they feed primarily on algae, thus cleaning the aquarium of it in large numbers. Caridina multidentata was previously known to aquarists as Caridina japonica but was renamed Caridina multidentata following a study in 2006. ==References== ==External links== * *Amano shrimp (Caridina multidentata), Aquarium Wiki Category:Atyidae Category:Freshwater crustaceans of Asia Category:Crustaceans described in 1860 Category:Crustaceans of Japan Category:Arthropods of Korea Category:Arthropods of Taiwan Category:Algae eaters Category:Taxa named by William Stimpson ",
