His tombstone epitaph tells of him as being \"a Serb [...] from the Serbian city of Skopje\". As an archdeacon, he served at the Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 under Patriarch Maksim I (s. 1655\u20131674). During the office of Patriarch Arsenije III (s. 1674\u20131690), Jefrem was ordained a priest. Jankovi\u0107 was appointed the bishop of the Eparchy of Polog (otherwise known as Eparchy of Tetovo, hence his byname), an eparchy under jurisdiction of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107. During the Great Turkish War (1683\u201399), in the event known as the Great Serbian Migration, Jankovi\u0107 and his countrymen feared Ottoman reprisal so they joined the Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III Crnojevi\u0107 and fled northwards into the Kingdom of Hungary, all the way to Szentendre, which the Patriarch made his new home. There, Jefrem was appointed in 1694 as the Orthodox bishop of Mohacs and Sziget, an important post because of the need to fight off aggressive Catholic propaganda. His seat was in the Orthodox monastery of Branjina.\u0414\u0440 \u0414. \u0408. \u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b, \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438 \u0443 \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438, \u043a\u045a. 1, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 334 Due to the pressure of the state to adopt union with Rome, Jefrem left for Russia in early 1703 as the Patriarch's envoy with an assignment to plead for help.\u0421. \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u043b\u045f\u0438\u045b, \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0430 \u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0421\u0430\u0434 1937, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 295 His departure was much to the joy of the Viennese court that forbade him to come back. Since he could not return home from Russia, in 1708 he was ordained as the bishop of Suzdal and Yuryevo. Jefrem was a man of many interests, most notably a bibliophile. He had a brother, Dimitrije, probably a monk, who visited him in 1709/1710 in Russia, bringing an Evangelion printed in the Kyiv Pecherska Lavra back to the Orahovica Monastery.\u0414\u0440 \u0414. \u041a\u0430\u0448\u0438\u045b, \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0438 \u0443 \u0425\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0458 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0438, \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 1971, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 189-190 He died in Russia, on 18 March 1718, and was buried at the church dedicated to the Birth of the Mother of God in Suzdal. ==See also== His contemporaries: *Gavrilo Stefanovi\u0107 Venclovi\u0107 *\u010cirjak Ra\u010danin (1660\u20131731), Serbian Orthodox monk and writer *Kiprijan Ra\u010danin (1650\u20131730), Serbian Orthodox monk and writer ==References== ==Sources== * * * * ==Further reading== * Category:1718 deaths Category:1640s births Category:17th-century Serbian people Category:18th-century Serbian people Category:18th-century Russian people Category:17th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:18th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:Habsburg Serbs Category:Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Category:Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church Category:Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Category:People from Skopje Category:Refugees of the Great Turkish War ",
