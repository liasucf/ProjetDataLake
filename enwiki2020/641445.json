The uncia (Latin, \"twelfth part\") was a Roman currency worth one twelfth of an as. ==Republican coin== By derivation, it was also the name of a bronze coin valued at of an as made during the Roman Republic., A Manual of Roman Coins: from the earliest period to the extinction of the empire, W. H. Johnston, 1865, p. 7. Available online. The uncia started as a Roman-Oscan weight of about 23 grams for a 273 gram pound, with Attic weight issues of about 27 grams under the libral standard for a 327 gram pound and was produced occasionally towards the beginning of Roman cast bronze coinage. Obverse types of the uncia include a knucklebone (c. 289-245 BC), a barleycorn (c. 280-245 BC), and the helmeted bust of Roma (from ). ==Empire coin== In imperial times the uncia was briefly revived under Trajan (98-117) and Hadrian (117-138). This coin was about 11-14 mm in diameter and weighed about 0.8-1.2 grams. It featured the bust of the emperor on the obverse with no inscription and \"SC\" (for Senatu Consulto) in a wreath on the reverse. If this issue belonged to the imperial system, meaning it was not a provincial piece, it would be an uncia. This issue may have been made only for circulation in the East. ==See also== *Duella *Roman currency *Roman Republican coinage ==Notes== Category:Coins of ancient Rome ",
