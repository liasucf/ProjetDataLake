    "text": "Crotalaria longirostrata, the chipil\u00edn, is a perennial legume that is native to Central America. Other common names include chepil, chepilin, chipilin and longbeak rattlebox. ==Description== Chipil\u00edn leaves are a common leafy vegetable in the local cuisines of southern Mexico, including Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Tabasco, and Central America, especially El Salvador and Guatemala. The leaves are high in iron, calcium, magnesium, and beta carotene. They can be boiled and served green, dried and used as an herb, or added to tamale doughs for color and flavor. When the pods of the plant dry, they dehisce (split open), spreading the seeds over a wide area. That, combined with the fact that the plant is not eaten by animals, has given chipil\u00edn the reputation of an invasive plant. In the continental United States, chipil\u00edn is characterized as a noxious weed, perhaps because other members of the genus Crotalaria are toxic to cattle. The importation of chipil\u00edn seeds or plants is banned in Australia. Introduced populations exist on the island of Maui in Hawaii. ==References== ==External links== * Leaf for Life description of chipil\u00edn * List of invasive plants in Hawai'i longirostrata Category:Edible legumes Category:Leaf vegetables Crotalaria longirostrata Crotalaria longirostrata Crotalaria longirostrata Crotalaria longirostrata Crotalaria longirostrata Crotalaria longirostrata Category:Plants described in 1838 ",
