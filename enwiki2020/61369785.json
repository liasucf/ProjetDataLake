The song was features background vocals from American singers Jhen\u00e9 Aiko and Ty Dolla Sign, as well as production from Johan Lenox, Amaire Johnson, Take a Daytrip, Cam O'bi, Dee Lilly, and Big Sean himself. The song samples \"I Wish\" by Carl Thomas and interpolates Sean's song \"I Don't Fuck with You\". == Background and composition == For about three years, Big Sean and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko dated one another on-and-off, but in March 2019, Aiko confirmed that they broke up. \"Single Again\" marks the first collaboration between them ever since. Lyrically, Big Sean mulls over the end of his relationship with Aiko and unnecessity of entirely blaming the shortcomings on the other person. He also recognizes the importance of taking time for himself to focus on his own needs, as well as the impact on his mental health resulting from the breakup. Prior to releasing the song, Sean tweeted lyrics of the song, as well as a message that details the song's meaning and the importance of finding solace in a relationship with himself: > I never knew that I didn't know how to be alone in life. I always would find > so much joy n happiness in a relationship or being with friends, but I > didn't know how important it was to be in a relationship with yourself. == Music video == A music video was released on July 29, 2019. Directed by Lawrence Lamont and stars Ryan Destiny, Keith Powers and Haha Davis, the visual follows a recently separated couple. Big Sean also raps in the middle of a street and inside a car surrounded by fans, and finds himself being put on trial and going to prison for infidelity. A shorter music video was released on August 26, 2019. == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 25 |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== == References == Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Big Sean songs Category:Songs written by Big Sean Category:Songs written by Ty Dolla Sign Category:Songs written by Mike City Category:GOOD Music singles Category:Def Jam Recordings singles Category:Jhen\u00e9 Aiko songs Category:Ty Dolla Sign songs ",
