In 1997, the city parliament decided favourably on an upgrade of the stadium whereas simultaneously, the city administration was working on a reconstruction plan. At the same time, the owners of the Hardturm football stadium were also planning to reconstruct their stadium. In 2003, the new Hardturm stadium was approved by the city population in a public vote, but subsequently, legal objections by neighbourhood and environmental groups put the timely realisation for the EURO 2008 tournament, for which it was chosen by UEFA in 2002 as one of eight venues, in jeopardy. As a result, the planning process for the new Letzigrund stadium was accelerated. In 2005, the city population approved in a vote the reconstruction of the public stadium, plus in a separate vote, the costs of temporarily adjusting the stadium to the requirements of EURO 2008. Originally planned for 2009, the new Letzigrund stadium was opened on August 30, 2007. The first sports event there was the annual Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich on September 7 with 26,500 spectators. The first football game was FC Z\u00fcrich vs. Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich on September 23. It hosted three games during the 2008 European championships, with a capacity of up to 30,000. The current capacity is 25,000 for football events, 26,000 for athletics and 50,000 for concerts. ==Gallery== File:Old Letzigrund Stadium by Raymond Lafourchette.jpg|The Old Stadium viewed from the Uetliberg File:D\u00e9molition Ancien Letzigrund par Raymond Lafourchette.jpg|Demolition of the old stadium File:New Letzigrund by Raymond Lafourchette.jpg|Building of the new stadium File:Letzigrund 2007ii.jpg|Opening ceremony (August 30, 2007) File:Zurich Letzigrund by Raymond Lafourchette.jpg|Interior view of the new Letzigrund File:Letzigrund 2007 1.jpg|The new stadium ==See also== *List of football stadiums in Switzerland ==References== ==External links== *Official Website *Stadion Letzigrund *Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich stadium information Category:FC Z\u00fcrich Category:Football venues in Switzerland Category:Athletics (track and field) venues in Switzerland Category:Diamond League venues Category:UEFA Euro 2008 stadiums in Switzerland Category:Sports venues in Z\u00fcrich Category:Tourist attractions in Z\u00fcrich Category:Sports venues completed in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in Switzerland ",
