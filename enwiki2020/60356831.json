The 16 wins in conference were also a school record. The team lost forward Buck Johnson to graduation, but signed freshman forward Keith Askins from Athens High School in Athens, Alabama. The Tide also won the 1987 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament, beating LSU in the final and earning an automatic bid to the 1987 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. They were seeded second in the Southeast Region, their highest ever in the NCAA tournament thus far. The Tide defeated North Carolina A&T; and New Orleans before falling to Providence in the Sweet 16. It was the Tide's third straight Sweet 16 appearance. Alabama's participation in the NCAA Tournament was later vacated by the NCAA. ==Roster== ==Rankings== ==Awards and honors== *Derrick McKey - SEC Player of the Year == References == Category:Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball seasons Alabama Alabama ",
