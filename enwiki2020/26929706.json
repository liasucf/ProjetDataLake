Named as the \u201cmost outstanding woman in the history of martial arts\u201d by Black Belt Magazine in 1978, she was the first woman to take a double victory in both fighting (kumite) and form (kata) in the International Women\u2019s Karate Championship, a feat she accomplished in 1976. She was the first woman to enter men's divisions at the World Championships in kata and weapons (steel whip), and to become World Champion in the men's division in both. At the peak of her career in 1977, she entered twenty-three tournaments and swept three divisions, including men\u2019s weapons kata. In 1990, Turner was the first woman in history to be nominated into the Black Belt Hall of Fame as \u201cCompetitor of the Year\u201d, the same year she was selected by Black Belt Magazine as their \u201cWoman of the Year\u201d. In 2009, she was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum \u201cHall of Fame\u201d. Born in Lyons, Kansas, Turner graduated from Westminster High School in Westminster, Colorado in 1963. At the age of 19, she began training in tae kwon do, before switching to kung fu, specifically the wun hop kune do technique taught by Al and Malia Dacascos. She began competing in official events in 1975 and retired from formal competition in 1979, at which point she formed the \u201cHard Knocks\u201d troupe demonstration team, which performed for three years. Upon her retirement from competition, she also entered the field of promoting, starting her own promotional firm, Superfights, Inc. in 1979. As President of Superfights, Inc., and serving on the executive board of the Professional Karate Association (PKA), Turner was an innovator in bringing mixed martial arts to cable television, promoting kickboxing\u2019s first pay-per-view event, Superfights, on ESPN in 1982, and securing kickboxing\u2019s first major sponsor with the Adolph Coors Brewing Company in that same year.\u201cKaryn Turner: Full Contact Karate\u2019s First Lady\u201d, Black Belt 22(11):34-37, December 1984. Eventually, frustrated with the small percentage of TV and promotion revenue\u2019s shared with promoters and fighters, Turner led a revolt by ex-PKA promoters to found a new association and to wrest control of the sport away from the PKA. The nascent Promoter\u2019s Association, started in 1985 in Denver, became the International Sport Karate Association, and Turner served as its first Commissioner.Van Winkle, Robert, \u201cRebel kick-boxing promoters get control, TV deal to boot\u201d, The Denver Post, July 26, 1987.
