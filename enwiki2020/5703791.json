() is a humorous weekly Israeli comic series geared towards Israeli teenagers. The creator of the series is the Israeli cartoonist Uri Fink, who has both illustrated and written the series for over three decades. The series has been published in the Israeli weekly youth magazine \"Ma'ariv La'Noar\" on a weekly basis since the 17 August 1987. Most of the chapters published in \"Ma'ariv La'Noar\" contain between 1-3 pages and comprise a single, self-contained storyline. Most chapters also contain a punch line in the last frame of the comic. The plot of the series focuses on the everyday life of an average Israeli adolescent, Gal Tichon, and his classmates at a fictional Israeli high school located in Gush Dan. The plot usually focuses in a humorous way on adolescent experiences as well as lampooning Israeli culture, society, and many aspects of the human condition. The characters' exaggerated personality traits are all based on common stereotypes (the geek, the bully, the queen bee, the evil teacher, etc.). Since its inception, the series has attained unprecedented success amongst its Israeli audience. This popularity has prompted the production of various related products under the \"Zbeng!\" brand: including, amongst others, several series of books; student diaries; a spin- off version, portraying the \"Zbeng!\" characters as children; a monthly magazine; and even a TV series loosely based on the comics. In 2015, Uri Pink decide to update the comics \"Zbeng!\" and make new characters while the original casts are their parents, it is called Zbeng!: The Next Generation. == Overview == \"Zbeng!\" was published for the first time in the popular Israeli teen magazine \"Ma'ariv La'noar\" on August 17, 1987 and attained popular success. Though originally published as a single-page item, the comic soon expanded to a multi-page format. Occasionally \"Zbeng!\" spoofed other regular columns in the magazine. The success of \"Zbeng!\" has been attributed in part to the author's willingness to make changes throughout the years and in response to reader feedback - for example, altering characters' appearances to reflect the latest fashions and trends. Despite the large fan base which the comics have acquired, \"Zbeng!\" has also been frequently and heavily criticized by Israeli parents and educators because of its portrayal of sexual activity, contempt for adult authority, and stereotypical characters. == Characters == === Main characters === * Gal Tichon (\u05d2\u05dc \u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05df) - the average teenager and series protagonist.
