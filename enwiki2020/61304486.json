    "text": "Sirenen \u2013 Bilder des Begehrens und des Vernichtens (Sirens \u2013 Images of Desire and Destruction) is an opera in three parts and eight scenes by Rolf Riehm, based on the Greek myth of Odysseus, Circe and the Sirens as told in Homer's Odyssey. It was premiered on 14 September 2014 at the Oper Frankfurt, conducted by Martyn Brabbins. The opera was published by Casa Ricordi. == History == Riehm wrote his own libretto based on several texts related to the meeting of Odysseus and Circe with the Sirens as told in Homer's Odyssey. He used text elements related to the story not only from the Odyssey but also by Karoline von G\u00fcnderrode, Giovanni Pascoli and Isabelle Eberhardt, illuminating various aspects of the myth. Riehm worked on the composition between 2010 and 2013. In 1994, he had composed the music theatre work Das Schweigen der Sirenen (The Silence of the Sirens) after a story by Franz Kafka for soprano and instruments. The opera was premiered on 14 September 2014 at the Oper Frankfurt, staged by Tobias Heyder and conducted by Martyn Brabbins. The production was the result of a long collaboration of all involved. Riehm worked on the score with the conductor, making changes even during the last phase of rehearsals. The composer met the singers, especially Tanja Ariane Baumgartner and Lawrence Zazzo, who sang the two main characters, and wrote their roles for their specific voices. The opera was published by Casa Ricordi. == Roles == {| class=wikitable !Role!!Voice type!!Premiere cast, 14 September 2014 Conductor: Martyn Brabbins |- | Circe || mezzo-soprano || Tanja Ariane Baumgartner |- | Odysseus || countertenor, actor || Lawrence Zazzo, Michael Mendl |- | Telegonos || actor || Domenic Betz |- | 8 Sirens || || Sarah Maria Sun, Annette Sch\u00f6nm\u00fcller, Frauke Burg, Britta Stallmeister, Barbara Zechmeister, Nina Tarandek, Maria Pantiukhova, Jessica Strong |- |} == Music and reception == A review notes that all the characters are wounded, and their stories are told indirectly through mental associations. The voice of Odysseus is a mix of the actor's speaking voice and the countertenor's expressive singing. Besides strings, instruments include archaic wood planks, a musical saw, accordion and piano. The first part of the opera plays on Circe's island Aiaia (Circe's Lamento). The second part opens with the \"Siren Song\". Circe, Odysseus und Telegonos dominate the final scene. == References == == External links == * Sirenen (trailer) Oper Frankfurt 2014 Category:German-language operas Category:Operas Category:2014 operas Category:Operas based on Greco-Roman mythology Category:Operas based on the Odyssey ",
