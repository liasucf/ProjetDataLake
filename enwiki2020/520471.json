Neighboring provinces are from the east clockwise Formosa, Chaco, Santiago del Estero, Tucum\u00e1n and Catamarca. It also surrounds Jujuy. To the north it borders Bolivia and Paraguay and to the west lies Chile. ==History== Before the Spanish conquest, numerous native peoples (now called Diaguitas and Calchaqu\u00edes) lived in the valleys of what is now Salta Province; they formed many different tribes, the Quilmes and Humahuacas among them, which all shared the Cac\u00e1n language. The Atacamas lived in the Puna, and the Wich\u00eds (Matacos), in the Chaco region. The first conquistador to venture into the area was Diego de Almagro in 1535; he was followed by Diego de Rojas. Hernando de Lerma founded San Felipe de Lerma in 1582, following orders of the viceroy Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa; the name of the city was soon changed to \"San Felipe de Salta\". By 1650, the city had around five hundred inhabitants. Colonial Cabildo in the city of Salta. An intendency of \"Salta del Tucum\u00e1n\" was created within the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. In 1774, San Ram\u00f3n de La Nueva Or\u00e1n was founded between Salta and Tarija (Tarija was added to the intendency later, in 1807). In 1783, in recognition of the growing importance of the city, the capital of the intendency of Salta del Tucum\u00e1n was moved from San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n to Salta. The battle of Salta in 1813 freed the territory from Spain, but occasional attacks were mounted from the Viceroyalty of Peru as late as 1826. Gervasio de Posadas created the Province of Salta in 1814, containing the current provinces of Salta, Jujuy, and parts of southern Bolivia and northern Chile. Exploiting internal Argentine conflicts that arose after the Argentine Declaration of Independence, Bolivia annexed Tarija in 1826. In 1834, Jujuy withdrew from Salta and became a separate province. The borders of Salta were further reduced in 1900, with the loss of Yacuiba to Bolivia. The National Government of Los Andes, constituted from the province in 1902 with a capital at San Antonio de los Cobres, was returned to Salta Province in 1943 as the Department of Los Andes.

The orientation of the Andes influences the distribution of precipitation within the province. The easternmost parts of the province have a semi-arid climate with a dry winter season. The mean annual temperature and precipitation are and . Temperatures can reach up to during summers, while they can fall down to during winters. The first slopes of the Andes force the moist, easterly winds to rise, provoking very high condensation leading to the formation of clouds that generate copious amounts of rain. The eastern slopes of the mountains receive between of precipitation a year, although some places receive up to of precipitation annually owing to orographic precipitation. Most of the precipitation is concentrated in the summer, with winters being dry. The high rainfall on these first slopes creates a thick jungle that extends in a narrow strip along these ranges, creating an area of great species diversity. At higher altitudes on these slopes, the climate is cooler and more humid, with the vegetation consisting of deciduous and pine trees. Between the high altitudes to the west and the low plains to the east lie the valleys. The climate of these valleys is temperate, allowing for human settlement and agricultural activities.

Further west, the Altiplano is a plateau at 3,000 m to 4,000 m above sea level. The climate is arid and cold: high temperatures vary little (since the warmer season is cloudy, and the coolest is sunny), ranging from 14 \u00b0C to 21 \u00b0C (57F to 70F); night temperatures go from 6 \u00b0C (43F) in midsummer, to -8 \u00b0C (18F) in midwinter, and extremes under -15 \u00b0C (5F) might be recorded.
