Coming from the first generation of jurists to practice after Justinian completed the codification of Roman law, he worked as a teacher of law, rhetor and advocate. His principal work is the Syntagma (572-77), a practical lawyer's edition of the Novellae in which he orders the Novellae into 22 titles and pioneers the use of paratitla, footnote-like references to other sources. Highly popular in its day, the Syntagma vanished from practical use together with the Novellae during the 7th century. ==References== * Category:6th-century Byzantine writers Category:Byzantine writers Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine jurists Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:6th-century jurists ",
