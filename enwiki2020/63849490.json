    "text": "Mario Andr\u00e9s Meoni (born 22 January 1965) is an Argentine politician, currently serving as the country's Minister of Transport since 10 December 2019, in the cabinet of President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez. From 2003 to 2015, Meoni was intendente (mayor) of Jun\u00edn, a partido in the Buenos Aires Province. ==Early and personal life== Mario Andr\u00e9s Meoni was born in 1965 in a road camp in Ascensi\u00f3n, a small town in General Arenales Partido in northern Buenos Aires Province. His father was a roadway maintenance worker, and he is of Italian descent through his grandfather, who worked as a smith. His family moved to Jun\u00edn when he was 6 years old, and stayed there ever since. He became interested in political activism after the return of democracy to Argentina in 1983, being drawn to the Radical Civic Union (UCR) inspired by President Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn. Meoni's political career began as private secretary to then-UCR senator Leopoldo Moreau. Since 1991 Meoni has been married to Laura Oliva, with whom he has twin sons. ==Political career== In 1987, Meoni was hired to work in the Plan Alimentario Nacional (PAN) of the Ministry of Social Action, during the presidency of Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn. From 1991 to 1995 he was a local councillor in Jun\u00edn, then going on to work as secretary of the UCR parliamentary bloc in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies from 1995 to 1999. In 1999 Meoni was elected to the Buenos Aires Province Chamber of Deputies in the UCR list, representing the fourth electoral district; he was the parliamentary bloc's vice president.

He was elected mayor on 14 September 2003 with 38.34% of the vote. Ahead of the 2007 general election, Meoni left the ranks of the UCR and joined the dissident \"Radicales K\" who supported the Kirchnerist government and the presidential candidacy of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner; thus he ran for re-election in the provincial list of the Plural Consensus coalition. During his second term as intendente, Meoni became a major collaborator of the OAS-based MuNET local development and transparency programme. Following the 2008 conflict between the government and farmers, in 2010 Meoni joined other radicales K who followed Vice President Julio Cobos in abandoning the Plural Consensus front and petitioning the UCR to allow them back into the party. Meoni went on to call for a public referendum to validate Cobos's permanency in his post following his controversial vote against Resolution 125, an idea that never materialized. Meoni ran for a third term in 2011, this time forming part of Uni\u00f3n Social para el Desarrollo (UDESO), the electoral alliance that backed the presidential candidacy of Ricardo Alfons\u00edn. On that occasion, Meoni won with 41,27% against the candidate from the Front for Victory. During his third term and starting in 2013, Meoni became close to Sergio Massa's Renewal Front. In 2015, Meoni ran for a fourth term, this time under the United for a New Alternative coalition of which the Renewal Front was part of. Meoni lost against the PRO candidate, Pablo Petracca, by over 7 thousand votes. ===Banco Provincia and Ministry of Transport=== On 14 January 2016 Meoni was appointed as one of the members of the directive board of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires (Banco Provincia) by the Provincial Senate of Buenos Aires, representing the Renewal Front and in replacement of Daniel Arroyo. At the 2019 general election, Meoni ran again for the mayoralty of Jun\u00edn against incumbent Petracca, but failed to regain the district and lost by a wide margin. On 6 December 2019, President-elect Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez announced the composition of his incoming cabinet, in which Meoni was touted to be the next Minister of Transport, succeeding Guillermo Dietrich. He took office alongside the rest of the cabinet on 10 December 2019. ==References== ==External links== *Official website of the Ministry of Transport (in Spanish) Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Radical Civic Union politicians Category:Mayors of places in Argentina Category:Government ministers of Argentina ",
