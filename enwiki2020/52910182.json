The album is a tribute album to Australian musician Peter Allen who died in 1992. In an interview with The Age in August 1997, Hewett was asked if she knew Allen. She said \"Look I'm not going to pretend he was my greatest friend. But we used to see each other, send each other flowers before concerts. I've always sung Peter Allen songs\", adding \"There seemed to be an awful lot of Peter's songs, so we thought we'd just do a tribute to him.\" == Track listing == # \"Tenterfield Saddler\" \u2013 3:49 # \"Quiet Please (There's a Lady on Stage)\" \u2013 3:48 # \"Over the Rainbow\" \u2013 3:26 # \"The More I See You\" \u2013 4:25 # \"I Still Call Australia Home\" \u2013 3:13 # \"Arthur's Theme\" \u2013 4:17 # \"One Step Over the Borderline\" \u2013 3:48 # \"I Honestly Love You\" \u2013 3:27 # \"Fly Away\" \u2013 3:55 # \"Don't Cry Out Loud\" \u2013 3:48 # \"I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love\" \u2013 3:59 # \"My Support\" \u2013 4:49 == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1997) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 67 |- |} == References == Category:1997 albums Category:Colleen Hewett albums Category:Tribute albums ",
