    "text": "Nathan Garrett, also known as the criminal Black Knight, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was a supervillain and descendant of the original Black Knight, and was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Dick Ayers. ==Publication history== Professor Nathan Garrett debuted as the modern-day supervillain Black Knight in Tales to Astonish vol. 1, #52 (Feb. 1964). This villainous Black Knight appeared in The Avengers vol. 1, #6, 14-15 (July 1964, March\u2013April 1965), and in the \"Iron Man\" feature in Tales of Suspense vol. 1, #73 (Jan. 1966), in which he was mortally wounded. ==Fictional character biography== Professor Nathan Garrett is the distant direct descendant of Sir Percy, and was born in London, England. He becomes a biologist, research scientist, and university professor. He then became the head of an espionage ring, and was captured by the hero Giant-Man. Garrett fled to Europe, where he found Sir Percy's tomb and the Ebony Blade. Garrett's evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, and he is shunned by Sir Percy's ghost. The embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology (including a lance that fired bolts of energy) and genetically engineers and creates a winged horse called Aragorn. Calling himself the \"Black Knight\", Garrett embarks on a career as a professional criminal to spite his ancestor. He battled Giant-Man again and the Wasp but is defeated.Tales to Astonish (vol. 1) #52 Garrett joins the supervillain team known as the Masters of Evil at the request of master villain Baron Heinrich Zemo as the counterpart to Giant-Man, and spreads Adhesive X over the city. However, with the help of jailed villain Paste-Pot Pete, the Avengers find an antidote and the Teen Brigade apply it to the containers, causing it to free the people. The Black Knight is defeated by Thor, as Captain America had decided to catch the Masters of Evil off guard by the Avengers 'switching' foes.Avengers (vol. 1) #6 He later attacked Stark Industries' plant to lure the hero Iron Man into battle, and was defeated.Tales of Suspense #59 Alongside the Masters of Evil, he again battled the Avengers and is captured.Avengers (vol. 1) #15-16 The Black Knight was among the villains assembled by Doctor Doom to destroy the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four Annual #3 Garrett kidnaps Happy Hogan and falls from his winged horse while trying to kill Iron Man.Tales of Suspense (vol. 1) #73 Mortally wounded, the dying Garrett summons his nephew Dane Whitman to their family estate, reveals his secret identity and repents for his life of crime, with Whitman deciding to adopt the Black Knight identity himself.Avengers (vol. 1) #48 After his death, Garrett is resurrected by Immortus as a member of the Legion of the Unliving. He battled Hank Pym once more, and \"dies\" again.Avengers West Coast #61 His horse is found by Victoria Frankenstein, great-granddaughter of Victor Frankenstein (creator of Frankenstein's Monster) who tried to restore the horse to normal, but instead only mutated further. The horse (now called the Hellhorse) later became the property of the supervillain Dreadknight.Iron Man (vol. 1) #101-102 ==Powers and abilities== Nathan Garrett was a normal man with gifted intelligence. He had a Ph.D. in genetics, was a brilliant biologist specializing in genetic engineering, and was a skilled electrical engineer as well. Garrett created a power-lance which fired heat beams, electrical charges, and concussive electromagnetic force beams. He also used a rope as a lasso, steel cables as bolas, red-hot spinning metal discs, and electrical energy-drainers which resembled doughnuts. He carried a paralyzer pistol which fired nerve gas that could paralyze or kill an opponent. He wore body armor made of an unknown steel alloy. He was a skilled equestrian, and rode a winged black horse that he created by genetic engineering. ==Other versions== ===Heroes Reborn=== In the Heroes Reborn universe, created by Franklin Richards, the Black Knight appeared as a member of Loki's Masters of Evil.Iron Man (vol. 2) #10 He is killed by Doctor Doom when he tries to gain an \"audience\" with him. ==In other media== ===Television=== * The Nathan Garrett version of Black Knight appeared in the \"Captain America\" and \"Iron Man\" segments of The Marvel Super Heroes, voiced by Len Carlson.The Marvel Super Heroes on TV!
