Despite the name, the LGE is not an all-boys school, but open to women since 1969. At the heart of the school is the original neo-classical building, built in 1909. This was first augmented in 1957, and the school underwent a rapid expansion in the 1960s and 1970s. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * Lyc\u00e9e de Gar\u00e7ons Esch-sur-Alzette official website Category:Lyc\u00e9es in Luxembourg Category:Schools in Esch-sur- Alzette Category:Boys' schools in Luxembourg Category:Educational institutions established in 1901 Category:Educational institutions in Luxembourg Category:Neoclassical architecture ",
