    "text": "South Davidson High is located near Denton, North Carolina. It adjoins South Davidson Middle School. ==History== South Davidson High School was originally Denton High School, which was opened in 1929 as part of a plan to bring a public high school to southern Davidson County. In 1989 the building became Denton Elementary School and the high school moved to its present larger building one mile north of Denton and was renamed South Davidson High School. When the new high school opened, Silver Valley Elementary, which had been a feeder school for nearby Central Davidson High School, became an additional feeder school for South. In 2009, a new wing was opened, including a new band room, new administrative offices, and eight new classrooms. ==Athletics== SDHS athletic teams are the Wildcats. The school is in the North Carolina High School Athletic Association, a part of the Yadkin Valley 1-A Conference, and has teams in wrestling, soccer, basketball, football, tennis, softball, baseball, track and field, cross country, and golf. South has inter-conference rivalries with North Moore High School and Chatham Central High School. ==References== == External links== * South Davidson High School - Home Category:Schools in Davidson County, North Carolina Category:Public high schools in North Carolina ",
