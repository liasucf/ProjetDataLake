    "text": "Hiwa Abdul Rahman Rashul, nicknamed Triple-X by his American guards, was the first ghost detainee to be publicly acknowledged by American authorities. Captured by Kurdish forces in Iraq in June or July 2003, he was turned over to the CIA who believed he was a member of Ansar al-Islam. He was then moved to a CIA prison in Afghanistan.Mayer, Jane, \"The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals\", 2008. p. 239 Office of Legal Counsel representative Jack L. Goldsmith informed Alberto R. Gonzales in October 2003 that Rashul was legally protected under the 4th Geneva Convention, and must legally be returned to Iraq. On June 16, 2004 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld acknowledged that he had ordered Rashul to be imprisoned without record, at the request of DCI George Tenet. Rashul was nicknamed \"Triple-X\" because, since he was kept off the books, his guards never learned his real name. When some of the circumstance of his incarceration became public, it was suggested that the reason he had been secretly incarcerated for seven months, without being interrogated, was that he got lost. Because of the order to keep him off the books those who would have interrogated him forgot about him, or could not find him. ==References== ==External links== *Transcript of a briefing, from Secretary Rumsfeld, where he answers questions on ghost detainees, June 17, 2004 *Rumsfeld Ordered Prisoner Hidden, CBS News, June 17, 2004 *Rumsfeld ordered secret detention of Iraqi suspect, The Guardian, June 18, 2004 *Iraq's invisible man: A 'ghost' inmate's strange life behind bars, US News and World Report, June 28, 2004 *Hiding a bad guy named Triple X: How the military treated some inmates at Abu Ghraib like 'ghosts', US News and World Report, June 28, 2004 *Army, CIA Agreed on 'Ghost' Prisoners, Washington Post, March 11, 2005 *David Weissbrodt, Amy Bergquist: Extraordinary Rendition: A Human Rights Analysis Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Iraqi extrajudicial prisoners of the United States ",
