    "text": "Tigernach mac Coirpri (d. 549) was an early Irish saint, patron saint of Clones (Co. Monaghan) in the province of Ulster. ==Background== Tigernach (anglicised Tierney) was one of the pre-eminent saints of the territory ruled by the U\u00ed Chremthainn dynasty, together with Mac Ca\u00edrthinn of Clogher and Mo Laisse of Devenish. His principal foundation is Clones, which lay in the western part of Fernmag, a kingdom ruled by the U\u00ed Chremthainn branch U\u00ed Nad Sluaig. The first foundation by Tigernach, in about the same area, is Gab\u00e1il- li\u00fain, now Galloon Island, Upper Lough Erne (Co. Fermanagh), on the border of that kingdom.Charles-Edwards, \"Ulster, saints of (act. c.400\u2013c.650)\" ==Life== Tigernach\u2019s Life depicts an early stage when the U\u00ed Chremthainn had not yet branched off but had a single royal seat near Clogher. Tigernach was born out of an illicit union between a king's daughter and an alien warrior: his mother, Der Fra\u00edch, was a daughter of Eochaid, king of the U\u00ed Chremthainn, while his father, Coirpre, was a Leinsterman in Eochaid's service, the Irish genealogies specifying that Coirpre belonged to the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain branch of the U\u00ed Bairrche. Soon after his birth, he was brought to Leinster. St Brigit of Kildare named the child Tigernach, meaning \"princely\". According to Butler, Tigernach was baptized by Conleth, bishop of Kildare with St. Brigid as godmother.Butler, Alban. The Lives of the Saints, Vol. IV, 1866 Tigernach's maternal uncle was Cairpre Daim Argat, King of Airg\u00edalla who died in 514. His maternal aunt was Saint Cinnia of Druim Dubhain (Feast Day 1 February). His maternal 1st cousin once removed was Saint Damhnat of Slieve Betha (Feast Day 13 June). His maternal second cousin was Saint Enda of Aran (Feast Day 21 March). His fourth cousins were Saints Dall\u00e1n Forgaill and Mogue. The Life goes on to describe a number of experiences in preparation for his career in Ulster: he was educated in Rosnat in Britain. Lanigan identifies Rosnat with Candida Casa, established by Ninian some time before. Lanigan, John. \"An Ecclesiastical History of Ireland\", p. 437, 1829 However, David Dumville does not find that credible and notes that St. Davids's in Dyfed has also been proposed.Dumville, David N., Saint Patrick, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 1999 Having heard his teacher prophesy the foundation of a prominent church, Tigernach went to Rome to obtain relics and returned to Brigit in Leinster, who urged him to become bishop.Latin Life of St Tigernach of Clones, ed. Heist. Tigernach then travelled to his birth land, but is not shown founding any church before relations with the ruling dynasty and the churches of the area are put in order. Eochaid welcomed Tigernach as a dear kinsman and offered to install him as bishop in Clogher. Since, however, this involved ejecting the bishop then in office, Tigernach refused and retreated to a minor church on a mountain slope. However, he earned a good reputation for his ascetic lifestyle and for a miracle by which he raised Doach, the archbishop of Armagh, from the dead. An angel appeared to him and following his directions, Tigernach sought out the boundary of the kingdom to make his first foundation, namely Galloon. Inspired by God, he offered it to Comgall of Bangor and moved a little further east to found Clones. There he is said to have lived like a hermit and died of plague. His festival is 4 April. ==History of the abbey== : Medieval stone sarcophagus of St. Tigernach, with a modern inscribed slab giving details of his life. In the grave yard by the round tower at Clones. Clones Abbey, the abbey founded by Tigernach in the 6th century, was dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul. It was still active before the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII, but it had experienced a number of misfortunes. The abbey was destroyed by fire in 836, 1095, and in 1184. In 1207, Hugh de Lacy destroyed the abbey and town; but five years after they were rebuilt by the English, who also erected a castle here. The ruins of a 12th-century abbey building can still be found in the town, along with a sarcophagus reputed to have been built to house Tigernach's remains, and a 9th-century round tower and high cross. ==Notes== ==References== * *Latin Life of St Tigernach of Clones, ed. ; ed. ==Further reading== * * Category:6th-century Irish people Category:People from County Monaghan Category:Medieval saints of Ulster Category:Medieval saints of Leinster Category:549 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ",
