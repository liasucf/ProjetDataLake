The bank was set up in 1997 at a time when he was Governor of the BoG. The bank was put into administration by the Bank of Ghana (BoG) in 2018 and then consolidated with four other defunct banks during Ghana's banking crisis. At the time of its administration the bank was led by his son Dr Kwabena Duffuor jr. In taking over the bank, the BoG cited weak supervisory standards, weak operations and persistent liquidity shortfalls and breaches in its cash reserve requirements as reasons for taking over the bank. At the time of its administration, it was reported that it had a negative capital adequacy of -24% at December 2017 and had been reliant on more than 2.2 billion cedis (US$498m at the time) of liquidity support from the BoG to continue to operate. The bank's Receivers subsequently sued Duffuor, HODA, his son and a number of others for the return of 5 billion cedis in assets. The Receivers allege that Directors and shareholders of the bank engaged in illegal transactions by giving out unlawful loans as well as illegal acquisition of assets in the name of related interests. Duffuor has attempt to regain control of the bank by countersuing the Ghana Government alleging the bank had been effectively expropriated. The lawsuit disclosed that almost all of uniBank's loan book was classed as impaired. His son has also sued the administrator KPMG and its staff alleging deceit and that they aimed to enrich themselves by deliberately misleading the Government into collapsing the bank. == See also == *List of Mills government ministers ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:University of Ghana alumni Category:Syracuse University alumni Category:Finance ministers of Ghana Category:Convention People's Party (Ghana) politicians Category:Ghanaian bankers Category:Ghanaian economists Category:Governors of Bank of Ghana Category:Recipients of the Order of the Volta Category:Prempeh College alumni ",
