It is described based on a male specimen found in the National Zoological Collections of the Zoological Survey of India in Chennai. It was collected from the Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu. The species epithet podhigai is named after the ancient Tamil name for the Aghastyamalai were the type locality is situated. ==Description and habitat== Gomphidia podhigai is similar to other Gomphidia species found in the hill streams of Western Ghats and Sri Lanka in general coloration and markings.
