It is a two- story wood frame structure with flanking single-story wings, finished in weatherboard and a metal roof. Built in 1915, it is the only surviving industrial building of its type in Stone County. Francis Brewer built it as a grist mill, a function to which it was restored in the 1980s. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Stone County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Grinding mills on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1914 Category:Buildings and structures in Mountain View, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Stone County, Arkansas ",
