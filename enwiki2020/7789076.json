    "text": "Donagh MacDonagh (22 November 1912 \u2013 1 January 1968) was an Irish writer, judge, presenter, broadcaster, and playwright. ==Personal life== MacDonagh was born in Dublin on St Cecilia's Day in 1912. He was still a young child when his father Thomas MacDonagh, an Irish nationalist and poet, was executed in 1916. Tragedy struck again when his mother, Muriel Gifford, died of a heart attack a year afterwards while swimming at Skerries to Lambay, County Dublin on 9 July 1917. The two children were then taken care of by their maternal aunts, in particular Catherine Wilson. His parents' families then engaged in a series of custody lawsuits, as the MacDonaghs were Roman Catholic and the Giffords were Protestant; in the climate of Ne Temere, the MacDonaghs were successful. NLI MacDonagh archives notes, p.6 He and his sister Barbara (who later married actor Liam Redmond) lived briefly with their paternal aunt Eleanor Bingham, County Clare before being put into the custody of strangers until their late teens, when they were taken in by Jack MacDonagh. He was married twice, to Maura Smyth and, following her death after she drowned in a bath whilst having an epileptic seizure, to her sister, Nuala Smyth. He had four children, Iseult and Breifne by Maura, and Niall and Barbara by Nuala. He died on 1 January 1968 and is buried at Deans Grange Cemetery. ==Legal career== MacDonagh was educated at Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD) with contemporaries Cyril Cusack, Denis Devlin, Charlie Donnelly, Brian O'Nolan, Niall Sheridan and Mervyn Wall. In 1935 he was called to the Bar and practised on the Western Circuit. In 1941 he was appointed a District Justice in County Mayo. To date, he remains the youngest person appointed as a judge in Ireland. He was Justice for the Dublin Metropolitan Courts at the time of his death. ==Writing== He published three volumes of poetry: \"Veterans and Other Poems\" (1941), The Hungry Grass (1947) and A Warning to Conquerors (1968). He also edited the Oxford Book of Irish Verse (1958) with Lennox Robinson. He also wrote poetic dramas and ballad operas. One play, Happy As Larry, was translated into a number of languages. He had three other plays produced: God's Gentry (1951, a ballad opera about the tinkers), Lady Spider (1959, about Deirdre of the Sorrows and the Three sons of Ussna and by far his best writing) and Step in the Hollow a piece of situation comedy nonsense. He also wrote short stories; published Twenty Poems with Niall Sheridan; staged the first Irish production of \u2018\u2019Murder in the Cathedral\u2019\u2019 with Liam Redmond, later his brother-in-law; and was a popular broadcaster on Radio \u00c9ireann. == Literature == === Poetry collections === * 1941 - Veterans and Other Poems, Cuala Press, Dublin 1941 * 1947 - The Hungry Grass, Faber & Faber, London 1947 * 1954 - The Ballad of Jane Shore, Dolmen Press, Dublin 1954 * 1958 - The Oxford Book of Irish Verse: XVIIth Century - XXth Century, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1958 (editor with Lennox Robinson) * 1969 - A Warning to Conquerors, Dolmen Press, Dublin 1969 (preface by Niall Sheridan) === Plays === * 1946 - Happy As Larry, Maurice Fridberg, London 1946 A ballad opera.
