    "text": "The Internet in Greece relied on PSTN/ISDN modem dial-up from 1990 until 2003, when ADSL was commercially launched by incumbent operator OTE. ADSL2+, VDSL2 and GPON are currently the main broadband standards. Greece also has 3G and 4G+ mobile broadband (HSPA) and a more expensive Satellite Internet access. Greece has an extensive fiber optic network throughout the country. ==Summary== * Top-level domain: .gr\"Communications: Greece\", World Factbook, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 4 December 2013.

The Quantum Cable will be laid at same time with the 2,000 MW EuroAsia Interconnector. It will upgrade Greece to telecom hub. ==FTTH== FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) is a form of fiber-optic communication delivery that reaches one living or working space. The fiber extends from the central office to the subscriber's living or working space. Once at the subscriber's living or working space, the signal may be conveyed throughout the space using any means, including twisted pair, coaxial cable, wireless, power line communication, or optical fiber. The main FTTH provider are: *Inalan - https://www.inalan.gr (Coverage in Athens & Thessaloniki, Speeds from 100/100 Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s) *HCN - http://www.hcn.gr (Coverage in Thessaloniki, Speeds up to 10 Gbit/s) **from April 2018 Kilkis, Greece *Vodafone Greece - http://www.vodafone.gr (Coverage in Athens - 2018, Thessaloniki - 2019, Patras - 2019)The first large FTTH network by Vodafone in Greece Cosmote have also run trials for FTTH for speeds up to 1 Gbit/s.OTE Group develops Fiber to the Home network ==DSL== A variety of new entrants have appeared since the liberalization of the market and local-loop unbundling. These operators typically offer lower prices than OTE. The main DSL providers are: *Cosmote *Cyta Hellas *Forthnet *Vodafone Greece (after merger with Hellas Online) *WIND Hellas Defunct: *On Telecoms *Vivodi Telecom ==Internet speed in Greece today== The available speeds are: *up to 24 Mbit/s ADSL2+ *up to 200 Mbit/s VDSL2 (with Supervectoring) *up to 120 Mbit/s FTTB *up to 250 Mbit/s AWMN (Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network) *up to 1 Gbit/s FTTO/FTTH ==Mobile broadband access== Mobile broadband offers are available from all three national mobile phone operators Cosmote, Vodafone Greece and WIND Hellas, with up to 375 Mbit/s downlink speeds. Mobile broadband was heavily marketed during 2008 by all three, leading to a surge in mobile Internet usage, primarily with mobile professionals and young users. Downstreams are realized via (HSDPA) technology with speeds for Wind Hellas and Cosmote reaching up to 28.8 Mbit/s and for Vodafone Greece up to 42.2 Mbit/s.\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 Vodafone Mobile Broadband (Vodafone Mobile Broadband data tariff plans), . Retrieved 6 January 2014. Upstreams of all three providers are realized via HSUPA technology, reaching up to 5.76 Mbit/s. ==Satellite broadband== Greece is covered by two satellite internet providers: * Hellas- Sat offers satellite service under the \"Hellas Sat Net\" brandname. OTE, as one of the owners of Hellas Sat, offers Hellas Sat Net service through its own distribution channels (website, shops etc.). The subscription packages either include a one-year commitment that is automatically renewed as unlimited time service after one year, or as a six-month limited subscription for \"seasonal business\" (as described on the oteshop website) that is renewable on demand. The equipment is installed by Hellas Sat accredited engineers and it includes a Satnet S3020 DVB - RCS VSAT Terminal (Advantech) satellite modem and a 0,96 m Antenna (satellite dish with transmitter receiver). Hellas Sat Net connections are also used to interconnect public administration offices and schools in remote areas (mostly remote islands of the Aegean Sea) to the national administration network Syzefxis and to the Internet). * Tooway covers Greece with broadband satellite Internet. Since 2011 they offer a downstream speed of up to 22 Mbit/s and an upstream speed of up to 6 Mbit/s. They address private and business customers and have a variety of packages reaching from traffic metered packages to flatrate programmes. * BigBlu is a UK company that begun offering satellite internet connection since August 2019 to the Greek market. Unlimited packages with speed of up to 50 Mbit/s and an upstream speed of up to 6 Mbit/s. They address private customers all over the country where telephone lines do not exist or underperform. ==Internet censorship and surveillance== Greece practices some internet censorship, including the blocking of websites that offer unauthorized online gambling. The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. Independent media are active and express a wide variety of views. Individuals can criticize the government publicly or privately without reprisal, and the government does not impede criticism. However, the law provides for prosecution of individuals who \"intentionally incite others to actions that could provoke discrimination, hatred, or violence against persons or groups of persons on the basis of their race or ethnic origin or who express ideas insulting to persons or to groups of persons because of their race or ethnic origin.\" In practice the government has never invoked these provisions. The law permits any prosecutor to order the seizure of publications that insult the president, offend any religion, contain obscenity, advocate for the violent overthrow of the political system, or disclose military secrets. The law provides criminal penalties for defamation, however, in most criminal defamation cases, authorities released defendants on bail pending trial and they served no time in jail. The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence. However, NGOs such as the Greek Helsinki Monitor report that authorities do not always respect these provisions in practice.\"Greece\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, April 2013. Retrieved 6 January 2014. On October 28, 2012 police arrested a Greek journalist, Kostas Vaxevanis, for violating personal privacy laws for publishing the \"Lagarde List\" of more than 2,000 alleged Greek tax evaders with Swiss bank accounts. On November 1, a court acquitted him; prosecutors appealed the verdict, and a re-trial date was pending at the end of 2012. In the 2013 re-trial, he was acquitted again. In September 2012 the cyber-crime police arrested a 27-year-old man, F. Loizos, charging him with \"malicious blasphemy and insulting religion\". The man reportedly created a Facebook page under the name \"Elder Pastitsios\" that played on the name of a legendary Mount Athos monk famous for his prophecies about Greece and Orthodox Christianity, and the name of a popular Greek dish. The cyber-crime police seized the man\u2019s laptop and removed the Facebook page. On January 16, 2014, he was found guilty of \"repeatedly insulting religion\" and was sentenced to ten months in jail, suspended while the prosecutor had recommended a smaller sentence. In the 2017 re-trial, however, the court acquitted Loizos. On August 6, 2009, the most- visited Greek blog (troktiko.blogspot.com) was shut down. Although Google cites potential violations of the terms of use, comments implying other reasons behind the closure of the Troktiko blog were published in several leading Greek blogs. The blog went back on-line a few months later and suspended its activities in July 2010, after the assassination of Sokratis Giolias, its administrator. On June 29, 2009, George Sanidas, the soon-to-be- retired Prosecutor of the Greek Supreme Court (Areios Pagos), declared that \"Internet-based communications are not covered by current privacy laws\" and are thus open to surveillance by the police. Such surveillance would be, according to Sanidas's mandate, completely legal. Following this proclamation, Greek bloggers, legal experts and notable personalities from the media have claimed that Sanidas's mandate contravenes both the Greek constitution and current EU laws regarding the privacy of Internet communications. Furthermore, this mandate has been greatly criticised as being a first step towards full censorship of all Internet content.* \"\u03a3\u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u0399\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\" (\"Breaks the confidentiality of communications on the Internet\" ), Alexander Avlonitis, \u0395\u0398\u039d\u039f\u03a3.gr, Nation Publishing SA, 30 June 2009.
