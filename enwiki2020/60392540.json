On All About Jazz, Mark F. Turner called it \"one of this years outstanding releases\" and said \"Kendrick Scott's debut recording The Source exudes a sense of purpose with music that is carefully orchestrated, coolly executed, and has an appeal that is both contemporary and cerebral\".Turner, M. F. All About Jazz Review, accessed April 2, 2019 On the Same site J. Hunter noted \"The Source lacks a big-time cleanup hitter ... The rotating reeds of Blake, Myron Walden, and Walter Smith III aren't enough to blast through the disc's overall shortcomings ... I hope Scott learns from his mistakes and goes on to the musical victories I know he can achieve\"Hunter, J.
