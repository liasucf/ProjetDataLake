Since 2002 he is Vice-President of the Paraguayan Episcopal Conference. Cuquejo was considered as a potential cardinal for a time; had he been selected, he would have been the first Paraguayan cardinal. His suffragan bishop, Rogelio Livieres Plano publicly claimed in 2014 that Cuquejo was homosexual, which caused a scandal in Paraguay. As a result, a visitation to Livieres Plano's diocese was arranged, and Livieres Plano was expelled from office by Pope Francis. In November 2014, Cuquejo resigned as Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Asunci\u00f3n due to age, and Pope Francis appointed Edmundo Valenzuela as the new Archbishop on 6 November. * * * * * * == References == == External links == * * Biography of Pastor Cuquejo Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Paraguayan Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Redemptorist bishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops ",
