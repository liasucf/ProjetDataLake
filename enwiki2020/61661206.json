    "text": "Andrew Neeme is an American professional poker player and poker vlogger from Michigan, United States. He is known for popularizing the \"meet-up game\" in which he announces on social media where he plays and searches for other players interested in playing in the game. ==Early life== Neeme was born in Michigan and attended Michigan State University. With a telecommunication degree, Neeme initially intended to work in the cell phone industry. He worked with a London based company which involved the music industry. However, despite liking the music industry, he wasn\u2019t satisfied with his salary. He found online poker at the start of the Moneymaker boom, in 2004, after moving to Los Angeles. He began playing on the now defunct poker site, Bugsy's Club and later switched his focus to live poker cash games. == Poker == His very first result in a tournament dates back from 2010, when he came in 26th place in a $340 No Limit Hold\u2019em tournament at the Venetian Deep Stack Extravaganza for $873. Overall, his live tournaments winnings are quite modest, preferring live cash games. As of September 2020, Neeme had won a little over $90,000 in live tournament formats. He has only cashed in 5 World Series events for a combined mere $23,977. In October 2016, Neeme began a poker vlog which generated interest. By January 2019, he had garnered over 100,000 subscribers. He has often been credited with popularizing the \"meetup game\" where fans and viewers could play him in a live setting. He often plays with fellow poker vlogger, Brad Owen. In March 2019, he temporarily partnered up with 888 Poker to provide live streams to his fans while he was playing poker in Alberta, Canada. ==References== ==External links== * * Andrew Neeme Hendon Mob results Category:American poker players Category:Living people Category:People from Michigan Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
