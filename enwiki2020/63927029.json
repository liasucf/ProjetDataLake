The Mach I was a single-seat automobile which rode on pressurized air, not wheels. Its name was inspired by the speed Mach 1, an aspiration speed not yet achieved by vehicles at the time. It used air pressure at a force of to provide lift and propulsion. In experiments, was used so that was needed for levitation and propelled it . An advertisement for the Mach I appeared in the magazine Boys' Life in 1960, in which it indicated the single-seater's dimensions: long; high; wide. The Levacar project was led by Andrew A. Kucher (a Ford Vice- President for Engineering and Research) and David J. Jay (a Senior Development Engineer). Kucher had initially conceived the concept around 1930. One of the lead designers was Gale Halderman, known for the initial designer of the Ford Mustang. In addition to the Mach I automobile, the project also developed a similarly outfitted scooter, the Levascooter. In experiments on a circular track, vehicles would raise off the ground and could jump obstacles. The Mach I was displayed for about two years in the late 1950s in Dearborn, Michigan. ==See also== *Hovercraft *Hoverboard *Maglev ==References== ==External links== *Ford Mach I at allcarindex.com Mach I Category:Hovercraft ",
