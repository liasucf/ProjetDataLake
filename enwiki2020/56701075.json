The architect behind the party is the editor and author Gunnar Sm\u00e1ri Egilsson, who at the launching of the party declared that it should be \"an advocate for wage earners and all those who are poor, invisible and powerless. The opponents of the Icelandic Socialist Party are the rich and those who serve their interests.\"Gunnar Sm\u00e1ri stofnar S\u00f3s\u00edalistaflokk \u00cdslands R\u00fav. 1. May, 2017.
