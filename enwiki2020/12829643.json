He also appeared in the North American Soccer League for the Baltimore Comets. He played as a forward. He started his career with Huddersfield Town in 1961 after being spotted by a talent scout, and went on to play for several English clubs including Bradford City who he signed for in 1972 and again in 1978. After his playing career ended his connection with Bradford City continued through a number of roles including groundsman, safety officer and commercial manager. A testimonial match was held for him at Valley Parade in 1998 and he retired in 2007. His Dementia diagnosis in the early 2010s is thought to be connected with a career of heading the football and has led to the setting up of Bradford Memory Walks which take place in aid of the Alzheimer's Society. ==References== ==External links== * Baltimore Comets: Allan Gilliver Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Rotherham Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:Rotherham United F.C. players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Baltimore Comets players Category:Boston United F.C. players Category:Gainsborough Trinity F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984) players Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:English expatriate footballers ",
