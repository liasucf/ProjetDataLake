Barrels of XM-15 firearms have a heavy profile and are hard chrome-lined 4150 alloy steel or 416 stainless steel. In Bushmaster's 2016 sales brochure, all new- production XM-15s are stated to be supplied with a 4150 steel barrel. The standard barrel has rifling of 1 turn in 9\". *E2S Series: The basic E2S is fitted with a 16-inch carbine-style barrel. **E2S Target \\- 20\" heavy-barrel target rifle with A2-style stock and carry handle upper, also available with 24\" and 26\" barrels. **E2S Shorty \\- 16-inch version with a \"shorty\" handguard. **E2S Shorty AK \\- Shorty variant with 14.5-inch carbine SBR barrel with an AK-74-style muzzle brake permanently welded to the end to increase the overall length to 16 inches. **E2S Dissipator \\- Variant with a Bushmaster- designed 16-inch \"Dissipator\" barrel.

The Bushmaster XM15-E2S \"M4 type\" carbine gained notoriety for its use in the October 2002 Beltway sniper attacks. A Bushmaster XM-15 was used in the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Just before the two-year anniversary of the massacre, nine families of the 26 victims of the shooting filed a class action lawsuit in Connecticut against Bushmaster, Remington Arms and others, seeking \"unspecified\" damages for the defendants' purported negligent entrustment and illegal marketing of the XM-15 rifle. Plaintiffs argued that both theories of liability fell within exceptions to the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which affords broad civil immunity to gun manufacturers. The case was dismissed in superior court and was appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court. In March 2019, the Connecticut Supreme Court reinstated the wrongful death lawsuit, holding that the plaintiffs successfully pleaded a cause of action for illegal marketing. Remington appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which denied review on November 12, 2019. The trial is scheduled for September 2021. An XM-15 was also used in the 2018 Nashville Waffle House shooting. An XM15-E2 was captured from Islamic State fighters in Sinjar Mountains by Peshmerga during the Iraqi Civil War. ==Legality== As a result of the Sandy Hook school shooting: * New York State banned the XM-15 series and assault weapons in the January 2013 NY SAFE Act. * The XM-15 series are among over 100 named firearms added to the Connecticut state assault weapon ban list in an April 2013 amendment, passed in the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting. ==Users== *: Federal Police of Brazil * * Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant *: New Zealand Policehttps://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/1923 * *: Used by JW GROM. * ** Boston Police Special Operations Unit ** Cincinnati Police Department ** United States Fish & Wildlife Service ==References== Category:5.56 mm firearms Category:Rifles of the United States Category:Semi- automatic rifles Category:Bushmaster firearms Category:ArmaLite AR-10 derivatives Category:AR-15 style rifles ",
