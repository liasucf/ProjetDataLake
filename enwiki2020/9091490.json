    "text": "Aston Rowant railway station was opened in 1872 and was a part of the Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway. Having closed in 1961, there have been proposals to reopen the station not only to the heritage services of the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway, but also National Rail commuter services operated by Chiltern Railways. ==History== Operated from the outset by the Great Western Railway it stayed part of that company after the Grouping of 1923. The station passed on to the Western Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, and was then closed by the British Transport Commission. The station was closed to passengers on 1 June 1957Oppitz, 2000, page 22 and to goods in January 1961. A single track ran through the station running through to pass under a bridge carrying the A40 main road between Oxford and London.Oppitz, 2000, page 20 The station appeared in four films: The Captive Heart (1946), My Brother Jonathan (1947), My Brother's Keeper (1948) and Portrait of Clare (1950). Excerpts of these films can be found at The Watlington Branch Line YouTube Playlist. == Present day == The station site is to be found just before the B4009 road meets the A40 road at the bottom of Beacon Hill near the M40 motorway. If approaching from the direction of Stokenchurch, the site is immediately to the right after passing the Icknield Way. The site is at a point where a bridge took the road over the line; this overbridge remains but is infilled to road level. The actual station site is to be found near a path through a wooded area.Disused Railways website An area where some remains may be covered is near the edge where the earth is piled high with little undergrowth. The area is now overgrown, yet a flat concrete surface is visible and the track bed is still apparent in undergrowth at the end of the flat area. If explored, the overgrown area of the site reveals signs of the station's platform. The original railings of the platform are heavily bent and twisted from nature but are still in their original position. The goods platform too can still be clearly made out showing the brick construction. Bricks etc. can be found strewn around this area of the site and at the edges, where the original boundary fences remain. == Future == There were reports in 1997 that the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway (CPRR) wished to extend its operations to Aston Rowant.This is Buckinghamshire, \"Discovering the charm of steam trains\", 5 June 2003 A joint venture between the CPRR and Chiltern Railways was also proposed whereby the national rail operator would construct a new station at Aston Rowant to allow frequent weekday commuter services along the Icknield Line to connect with main line traffic through to London Marylebone, leaving the CPPR to run heritage services at other times.Oppitz, pages 24\u201325. The scheme, which would cost around \u00a33m, would seek to take advantage of Aston Rowant's location near junction 6 of the busy M40 motorway.The Independent, \"Travel: Reopened rail line could relieve M40\", 22 December 1997. ==References== == Sources == * * * * * == External links == * Station on navigable 1946 O.S. map * Photograph of Aston Rowant Station Category:Disused railway stations in Oxfordshire Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1872 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1957 Category:1872 establishments in England Category:1957 disestablishments in England ",
