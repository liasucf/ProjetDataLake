    "text": "The Atlanta\u2013Fulton Public Library System is a network of public libraries serving the City of Atlanta and Fulton County, both in the U.S. state of Georgia. The system is administered by Fulton County. The system is composed of the Central Library in Downtown Atlanta, which serves as the library headquarters, as well as the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History, and 33 branch libraries. ==History== ===The Young Men's Library Association=== The origins of the public library system lie in the Young Men's Library Association (YMLA), a subscription library system established in 1867. The YMLA was open to the public, but only paying members could check out books. Membership was restricted to white men until 1873 when white women were allowed to join. The YMLA system remained the de facto library system of the city for the rest of the century. During the 1890s, however, the YMLA, Andrew Carnegie, and the City of Atlanta, started to work out the details of a new public library in Atlanta. ===The Carnegie Library=== Carnegie Library (1902\u20131977) On March 4, 1902, the first public library, the Carnegie Library, opened on the site of the current Central Library. When the library opened, only the basement, the stacks, and the children's room were completed. The Carnegie Library remained the main library of the system for most of the century. The library was renovated in 1950 and 1966 through city bond funding. Before 1950 the system was referred to as the Carnegie Library, but to commemorate the renovation of the central Carnegie Library the system was renamed the Atlanta Public Library in 1950. It was in this building that 20 gay men were arrested following a police stakeout in September 1953, an event known at the Atlanta Public Library perversion case. In 1977 the Carnegie Library was torn down to make way for the current Central Library. However, the building's architectural bays were preserved, and used to create the Carnegie Education Pavilion, a monument to higher education in Atlanta. ===Expansion of the library system=== The Carnegie Library was so successful that within a year after the opening of the library, Carnegie suggested he would give more money to open branch libraries. In 1906 Carnegie formally offered $30,000 for the construction of two branch libraries, as long as the city provided a site and arranged financial support for the library. The Anne Wallace Library, named in honor of the first Carnegie Library librarian, opened in 1909 on the corner of Luckie Street and Merritts Avenue in Northwest Atlanta. Many new branch libraries followed in the years to come. The Ragsdale branch, located in Oakland City, opened in 1912, and in 1913 the Uncle Remus Branch opened in the West End home of Joel Chandler Harris. Over the next century the library system has expanded from four branches in 1913 to the 34 branches operating today. By 1924 the library system had eight branches throughout the city, and by 1967 the system had 19 branches. ===City\u2013county relationship=== In the first decades of the library system service was maintained for Atlanta residents only, and as a result Fulton County was left without library service. Using Works Progress Administration and city funds, the City of Atlanta and the Fulton County Board of Commissioners signed a contract in 1935 to provide library coverage throughout the county. In 1982, however, Georgia passed a constitutional amendment that allowed the city to transfer control of the system to the county, and in 1983 the system was turned over the county control. To reflect the change in control the system was renamed the Atlanta\u2013Fulton Public Library System. ===Black Atlantans and the public library=== When the Carnegie Library opened in 1902, blacks were excluded from the library. Activist W. E. B. Du Bois led an unsuccessful campaign for black representation and equal use of the library, or at the very least a branch library for blacks, but the library board rebuffed his efforts. Carnegie had offered funds for a black branch library, but the library system did not use the money until 1921 when Tommie Dora Barker, the Director of the Carnegie Library School, opened the Auburn Avenue Branch Library, the first branch library for blacks, in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood. During segregation two other libraries were opened for the use of blacks. In 1959, Irene Dobbs Jackson, the mother of future Atlanta mayor Maynard Jackson requested a library card for the central library. After days of public furor, the library board voted to allow blacks full access to the library on 19 May 1959. Between 1966 and 1973 the library staff was desegregated. ===2008 bond referendum=== In 2008 Fulton County voters approved a $275 million library bond referendum, which provides money for renovation and construction of library facilities in Fulton County. The plan includes money for eight new libraries, a new central library, expansions of two libraries, and renovations of 23 branch libraries. Five libraries will be built in Alpharetta, Milton, Northwest Atlanta, Wolf Creek, and Stewart-Lakewood. The Alpharetta and Stewart-Lakewood libraries will replace existing libraries, the Northwest Atlanta library will replace three small branch libraries, and the Milton and Wolf Creek libraries will be completely new. A new library will be built in Palmetto/Chattahoochee Hill County, and two new libraries will be built in Southeast Atlanta and East Roswell. The Southeast Atlanta library will replace three small branch libraries. In the original Library Facility Master Plan $34 million was allocated to fully restore and upgrade the site. In the final referendum, however, $84 million was provided for the construction of a new central library. Finally, the Auburn Avenue Research Library and the South Fulton branch library will be expanded. ==Central Library== The Central Library The Central Library in Downtown Atlanta serves as the headquarters of the library system.\"Central Library & Library System Headquarters.\" Atlanta\u2013Fulton Public Library System. Retrieved on June 29, 2017. Completed in 1980, it was the last building to be designed by Bauhaus-movement architect Marcel Breuer. The building, designed in the brutalist architectural style, is considered a \"masterpiece\" by architectural experts, such as Barry Bergdoll, the Chief Architectural Curator of the Museum of Modern Art, and is closely related to the Whitney Museum of Art building (currently the Met Breuer museum). Breuer was unable to attend the dedication ceremonies on May 25, 1980, and he died a year later on July 1, 1981 at the age of 81. The concept for the design dates back to 1969, but the contract was not awarded to Breuer until 1976, because of disputes between the library administration and city government over the bond referendum needed to raise the $18.9 million for construction of the library. Construction began in 1977, and when the structure was completed in 1980 it featured a 300-seat theater, six stories of library space, and a restaurant. The building was built for a capacity of 1,000 users and 1 million volumes. The structure consists of a steel frame and concrete slabs, and the exterior is composed of precast concrete panels that were bush-hammered for texture. Concrete was chosen as the material because concrete allowed for the most economical implementation of the special shapes required for the recessed windows and splayed reveals. The second, third, and fourth stories are connected by a monumental concrete staircase. Since 1980, however, the state-of-the-art facilities have deteriorated. The theater was closed during the mid-1990s after water from a leaking concrete planter above the theater collapsed parts of the ceiling, but has since been renovated due to recent interest in the building. Although the restaurant was busy and successful during the early years it was closed during the late 1990s. Furthermore, the brutalist architectural style of the library is not fully appreciated in Atlanta. In an effort to mute the harshness of the style, the system spent $5 million to renovate the building in 2002. The money was spent on a new carpet with colorful highlights and more colorful walls. A full renovation would have cost an estimated $34 million. Nonetheless, it still remains unclear as to what will happen to the Breuer building. However, a multi-year preservation effort led by artist, writer and historian, Max Eternity, ignited a renewed interest in the building, and the library was listed on the 2010 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites. Various news outlets, including National Public Radio (NPR), reported in July 2016 that \"the Fulton County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously...not to tear down the building.\" ==Branches== ==Library systems in neighboring counties== *West Georgia Regional Library to the west. *Cobb County Public Library System to the west. *Sequoyah Regional Library System to the north west. *Forsyth County Public Library to the north east. *Gwinnett County Public Library to the east. *DeKalb County Public Library to the east. *Clayton County Library System to the south east. *Flint River Regional Library System to the south. *Coweta Public Library System to the south. ==References== ==External links== *Atlanta\u2013Fulton Public Library System website *\"One of Finest Libraries in South\", Atlanta Georgian and News, December 24, 1909 from the Atlanta Historic Newspapers Archive in the Digital Library of Georgia.
