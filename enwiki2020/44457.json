    "text": "Green Card is a 1990 romantic comedy film written, produced, and directed by Peter Weir and starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell. The screenplay focuses on an American woman who enters into a marriage of convenience with a Frenchman so he can obtain a green card and remain in the United States. Depardieu won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. The film won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. ==Plot summary== Bront\u00eb Parrish (Andie MacDowell), a horticulturalist and an environmentalist, enters into a Green Card marriage with Georges Faur\u00e9 (Depardieu), an undocumented immigrant from France, so he may stay in the United States. In turn, Bront\u00eb uses her fake marriage credentials to rent the apartment of her dreams. After moving in, to explain her spouse's absence, she tells the doorman and neighbors he is conducting musical research in Africa. Contacted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for an interview to determine if her marriage is legitimate, Bront\u00eb tracks down Georges, who is working as a waiter. Although the two have little time to get their facts straight, the agents who question them appear to be satisfied with their answers. But when one of the agents asks to use the bathroom and Georges directs him to a closet, their suspicions are aroused, and they schedule a full, formal interview to be conducted two days later at their office. Advised by her attorney she could face criminal charges if their deception is uncovered, Bront\u00eb reluctantly invites Georges to move in with her. They try to learn about each other's past and their quirks and habits but quickly find they can barely tolerate each other. Georges is a fiery-tempered selfish slob and smoker who prefers red meat to vegetarian food, while Bront\u00eb is shown as uptight and cold, obsessed with her plants and wrapped up in environmental issues. Bront\u00eb's best friend Lauren Adler's parents plan to leave New York City and may donate their trees and plants to the Green Guerrillas, a group overseeing the development of inner city gardens. Bront\u00eb is invited to a dinner party to discuss the issue and discovers Georges is there, having been asked by Lauren. He so impresses the Adlers with an impressionistic piano piece set to a poem about children and trees that they agree to donate their plants to the Green Guerrillas. When Bront\u00eb's parents later arrive at the apartment for an unannounced visit, Georges pretends to be the handyman. When Bront\u00eb's boyfriend Phil returns from a trip, Georges reveals he is her husband. Bront\u00eb angrily kicks Georges out, but the pair nonetheless appear at the immigration interview the next day. The two are questioned separately, and when Georges is caught out by the interviewer, he confesses the marriage is a sham. He agrees to deportation but insists Bront\u00eb not be charged for her role in the charade. He lets Bront\u00eb believe the interview was a success and the two go their separate ways. A few days later, Georges invites Bront\u00eb to join him at the cafe where they first met. When she notices one of the immigration agents is waiting outside, she realizes Georges is being deported, and finally aware she loves him, tries to stop him from leaving as they finally realize they are in love with each other. Georges promises to write every day asking the same question \"When are you coming, Cherie?\", a line he had also used when describing their fabricated courtship to the INS. Just before he leaves with the immigration agents, Bront\u00eb asks if he still has their wedding rings; he pulls them out of his pocket and they quickly exchange rings again, laughing and kissing, then Georges departs with the immigration agent as Bront\u00eb watches from the sidewalk with a smile, knowing they'll meet again. ==Cast== * G\u00e9rard Depardieu as Georges Faur\u00e9 * Andie MacDowell as Bront\u00eb Parrish * Bebe Neuwirth as Lauren Adler * Gregg Edelman as Phil * Robert Prosky as Bront\u00eb's lawyer * Lois Smith as Bront\u00eb's mother * Ann Dowd as Peggy * Larry Wright as Larry Wright the bucket drummer * Ethan Phillips as Gorsky ==Production== Peter Weir wrote the script, an original, specifically as a vehicle for G\u00e9rard Depardieu to introduce him to a wide English-speaking audience.Katherine Tucker, \"Peter Weir\", Cinema Papers, August 1990 p 6-10 The film was based on The Paper Wedding (French: Les noces de papier), a 1989 made for television Canadian film directed by Michel Brault, screenplay by Jefferson Lewis, which was subsequently entered into the 40th Berlin International Film Festival. This film starred Genvieve Bujold. Partial funding for the film was provided by the Film Finance Corporation Australia and Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Cin\u00e9matographique. Although the film was set in America and did not feature Australian actors, the fact it was written, directed, filmed, designed and edited by an Australian enabled it to receive funding from the Australian government. This was $3.8 million from the FFC.Bob Evans, \"OUR PIECE OF THE ACTION\", The Australian Financial Review, 18 October 1991 p 33 ==Music== ===Original soundtrack=== Green Card: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on January 22, 1991 on Var\u00e8se Sarabande.http://www.hans- zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco&id;=24 Some of the music like \"River\", \"Watermark\", and \"Storms in Africa\" by Enya, \"Holdin' On\" by Soul II Soul, \"Oyin Momo Ado\" by Babatunde Olatunji and \"Surfin' Safari\" by The Beach Boys are heard in the movie, but not included in the soundtrack. ====Track listing==== #\"Street Drums\" (Larry Wright) (1:29) #\"Instinct\" (3:33) #\"Restless Elephant\" (2:55) #\"Cafe Afrika\" (2:59) #\"Greenhouse\" (3:15) #\"Moonlight\" (1:24) #\"9AM Central Park\" (1:48) #\"Clarinet Concerto In A Major: Adagio\" (W.A.

Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it \"as breezily escapist as a film this facile can be\" and added, \"Ms. MacDowell ... has a lovely, demure ease that makes George's appreciative gaze quite understandable. Mr. Depardieu, in the role that gets him into a New York Yankees cap, proves that he is nothing if not a sport ... He comes to life most fully when he lapses into French or is otherwise momentarily freed from the story's constraints.\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times observed the film \"is not blindingly brilliant, and is not an example of the very best work of the director who made The Year of Living Dangerously or the actor who starred in Cyrano de Bergerac. But it is a sound, entertaining work of craftsmanship, a love story between two people whose meet is not as cute as it might have been.\"Chicago Sun-Times review Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film a \"captivating romantic bonbon\" and added, \"Don't look for the originality and grit that distinguished Weir's Australian films Picnic at Hanging Rock and Gallipoli, Green Card has all the heft of a potato chip. But Depardieu's charm recognizes no language barriers, and MacDowell, the revelation of Sex, Lies, and Videotape, proves a fine, sexy foil.\"Rolling Stone review Rita Kempley of the Washington Post said, \"Like Ghost and Pretty Woman, this romance is blissfully dependent on our staying good and starry- eyed, seduced by the charisma of the leads. And we do, despite its lackadaisical pace and disappointing ending.\"Washington Post review Variety said, \"Although a thin premise endangers its credibility at times, Green Card is a genial, nicely played romance.\"Variety review Time Out London stated \"Weir's first romantic comedy boasts a central relationship which is tentative and hopeful, a mood beautifully realised by Depardieu (venturing into new territory with a major English-speaking role). Complemented by the refined MacDowell, his gracious, generous performance is never dominating, and their exchanges offer unexpected pleasures. In terms of the genre's conventions, Weir likens this film to 'a light meal.' It's one to savour.\"Time Out London review Channel 4 said, \"Weir's film has its fair share of cute moments as the opposites slowly begin to attract, but this is largely over rated stuff, which proved curiously popular with critics on its release. Depardieu does his obnoxious-yet-strangely-lovable act with ease; however, the romantic comedy fixture MacDowell is less convincing.\"Channel 4 review ===Box office=== Green Card grossed $10,585,060 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $16,725,817 in 2009 dollars. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
