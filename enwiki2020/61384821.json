    "text": "Llongo (; romanized: L\u00f3ggos) is a village in Gjirokast\u00ebr County, southern Albania. At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality of Dropull. It is inhabited solely by Greeks. == Demographics == The village had 476 inhabitants in 1993, all ethnically Greeks. The village today has a permanent population of roughly 100-200 inhabitants, notably due to migration to Greece or other countries. Despite this, the population doubles in Easter, Summer and Christmas, as most people return to their village to celebrate or have holidays with their families. == References == == External links == *Video and photo compilation of the village Category:Northern Epirus Category:Villages in Gjirokast\u00ebr County Category:Greek communities in Albania ",
