    "text": "Element (formerly Riot and Vector) is a free and open-source software instant messaging client implementing the Matrix protocol. Element supports end-to-end encryption, groups and sharing of files between users. It is available as a web application, as desktop apps for all major operating systems and as a mobile app for Android and iOS. == History == Element was originally known as Vector when it was released out of beta in 2016. The app was renamed to Riot in September of the same year. Logo of Riot from 2019 to 2020. In 2016 the first implementation of the Matrix end-to-end encryption was implemented and rolled out as a beta to users. In May 2020, the developers announced enabling end-to-end encryption by default in Riot for new non-public conversations. In April 2019, a new application was released on the Google Play Store in response to cryptographic keys used to sign the Riot Android app being compromised. In July 2020, Riot was renamed to Element. == Technology == Element is built with the Matrix React SDK, which is a React-based software development kit to ease the development of Matrix clients. Element is mostly built around web technologies and also uses Electron, a software framework to create desktop applications from web applications, to distribute their desktop clients for Windows, MacOS and Linux. The Android and iOS clients are developed and distributed with their respective platform tools. On Android the app is available both in the Google Play Store and the free-software only F-Droid Archives, with minor modifications. For instance the F-Droid version doesn't come with the proprietary Google Cloud Messaging plug-in. == Features == Element is able to bridge other communications into the app via Matrix, such as IRC, Slack, Telegram, Jitsi Meet and others. Also it integrates voice and video peer-to-peer and group chats via WebRTC. Element supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) of both one-to-one and group chats. == Reception == Element being the Matrix client with the most development has been recommended as a starting point for new Matrix users, even by Matrix itself. In the media, Riot was sometimes perceived as an alternative to Slack, WhatsApp or other instant messaging clients. In 2017, German computer magazine Golem.de called Riot (and Matrix server) as \"mature\" and \"feature-rich\", while criticizing its key authentication at the time to be \"anything but user-friendly\" for many communicatees with multiple devices each. A co-founder of the project, Matthew Hodgson, assured the key verification process was a \"placeholder\" solution to work on. In 2020, a cross-signing feature was added to the apps to make the verification process simpler. ==See also== * IRC * Matrix * Rich Communication Services (RCS) * Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) * XMPP ==References== == External links == * Category:Communication software Category:Cross-platform software Category:Free and open-source Android software Category:Free instant messaging clients Category:IOS software Category:Linux software Category:macOS software Category:Windows software ",
