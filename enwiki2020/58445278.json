Accessed September 13, 2018. \"[Q] Where are you from? [A] I am originally from Union, N. J.\" where she attended Union High School.Parkinson, Claire L.; Millar, Pamela S.; and Thaller, Michelle. (editors). Women of Goddard: Careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, July 2011, p. 111. Accessed September 13, 2018. \"Amy Simon-Miller Union High School, Union, New Jersey\" She earned a bachelor's degree in Space Sciences from Florida Institute of Technology in 1993 and was inducted into Sigma Pi Sigma. She completed her doctoral studies in astronomy at the New Mexico State University in 1998. Upon graduation she became a postdoctoral research scientist at Cornell University. == Career == Simon is a Senior Scientist in the Solar System Exploration Division at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, having joined NASA as a civil servant in 2001. She served as the Chief of the Planetary Systems Laboratory from 2008 to 2010 and the Associate Division Director from 2010 to 2013. Her scientific research involves the study of the composition, dynamics, and cloud structure in jovian planet atmospheres, primarily from spacecraft observations, and as of 2018 she has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed publications. == Works == Her contributions include the first detailed study of the changing shape of Jupiter's Great Red Spot, as well as the discoveries of several types of waves in the atmosphere of Jupiter. Her analysis of Voyager 2, Cassini-Huygens, Hubble and New Horizons images led to the discovery of several new classes of Jupiter atmospheric waves. Beyond Jupiter, she has studied atmospheric chemistry and dynamics on Saturn, including the north polar hexagon. She was also part of a team that observed Neptune using the Kepler spacecraft Telescope, detecting solar oscillations in light reflected off a planet for the first time. Simon is involved in multiple robotic NASA planetary missions. She was a co- investigator on the Cassini-Huygens Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) and is the Deputy Instrument Scientist for the OSIRIS-REx Visible and IR Spectrometer (OVIRS), as well as for the Landsat 9 Thermal Infrared Sensor-2 instrument and the Deputy Principal Investigator for the Lucy (spacecraft) L'Ralph instrument. She is Principal Investigator of the Hubble Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program. Her team discovered a new Great Dark Spot on Neptune with Hubble and have published more than 12 manuscripts from OPAL data. Her work with OSIRIS-REX led to the discovery of hydrated minerals on the surface of Bennu and earned a NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal. == Explorations == Simon also plans future planetary exploration missions. She served on the National Academy of Science's Space Studies Board 2013 Planetary Science Decadal Survey. She has co-led several mission studies for NASA including Flagship class missions to Enceladus and to the Ice Giants, Uranus and Neptune. She was Principal investigator for the proposed New Frontiers class Saturn probe mission, SPRITE (spacecraft). Simon is a member of the American Geophysical Union, the American Astronomical Society, and the Division for Planetary Sciences. == Honors and awards == * NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal \u2013 2019 * NASA Silver Achievement Medal (OVIRS Team) \u2013 2017 * NASA Group Achievement Award (OSIRIS-REx Team) \u2013 2017 * Robert H.
