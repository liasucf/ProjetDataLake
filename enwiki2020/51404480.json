The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War. New Jersey\u2019s electoral vote was split, with four of the electors pledged to Lincoln being elected because the alternative, a fusion ticket of electors supporting other candidates, saw the Breckinridge and Bell electors finish behind all other candidates.Dubin, Michael J., United States Presidential Elections, 1788\u20131860: The Official Results by County and State, McFarland & Company, 2002, p. 187 and three Douglas electors being elected. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
