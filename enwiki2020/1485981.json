The company's founder, Harry Crook, had emigrated to the United States with his family several years earlier, and whilst there joined Fuller Brush as a sales representative. He returned to Bristol several years later, and started a business making brushes which were sold door-to- door by salesmen. In 1995, Kleeneze was bought by European Home Retail (EHR). The company was bought by Findel PLC in 2007, after the collapse of EHR. In 2015, Findel sold Kleeneze to CVSL, an American holding company, as part of their MLM portfolio. The company remained at its original Hanham site for almost 80 years. In May 2004, the company relocated its headquarters and distribution centre to Warmley. In 2007, after the acquisition by Findel, it was announced that the company would move to Hyndburn.Kleeneze sweeps in with 200 jobs Lancashire Telegraph - 08 Feb 2007 Kleeneze was a founder member of the UK's Direct Selling Association until 2017. In 2016, funding was obtained from Greater Manchester Combined Authority to set up a warehouse and distribution centre in Rochdale. Kleeneze went into administration under the firm FRP Advisory on 12 April 2018. According to the administrator, a period of rough trading and operational issues following its 2017 move to Heywood had caused the company to seek a buyer to save the company. At the time, the company reported 140 jobs and 5,000 distributors. ==References== == External links == * Category:Retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Multi- level marketing companies Category:Retail companies established in 1923 Category:History of Bristol Category:Companies based in Hyndburn Category:British brands Category:1923 establishments in England Category:Companies that have entered administration in the United Kingdom Category:Marketing companies established in 1923 Category:British companies established in 1923 ",
