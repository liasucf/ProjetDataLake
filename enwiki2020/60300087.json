The stadium has a current capacity of 4,081 spectators. ==History== The old stadium, H\u00f8ddvoll Stadion, did not meet the criteria for First Division stadia, lacking such amenities as under-soil heating, floodlights and the necessary standard for locker rooms. The club is therefore working on plans to build an all-new stadium at the site of the training pitch\u2014the site of the first stadium from 1921. The new venue will feature a main stand on the north long side and artificial turf. The project is estimated to cost NOK 50 million. The main stand will feature 1,950 seated places, the opposite, south stand will feature 875 seated places, and the eastern stand will feature standing places for 1,000 spectators, for a total of 3,825. The west end will be built as part of H\u00f8ddvoll Panorama, which combines commercial estate in the ground floor and eighteen apartments in the upper two stories. The new venue is certified for Eliteserien and UEFA matches. H\u00f8dd will rent the stadium from the municipality for NOK 2.5 million per year. The main stand will be built in conjunction with Ulsteinhallen, and will feature common locker rooms and cafeteria. The indoor arena will feature a hall area for recreational athletics, handball and gymnastics, with Dimna IL as the main tenant. Both Ulsteinhallen and the new stadium will be owned by Ulstein Eigedomsselskap KF, a municipal enterprise owned by Ulstein Municipality. The municipality estimates that the hall will cost between one and a half and two million kroner per year to operate. M\u00f8re og Romsdal County Municipality secured 47.6 percent of the investment costs and 37.6 percent of the operating costs of the new hall, to allow it to be used by Ulstein Upper Secondary School. This will give the school access to of new floor space and daytime access to the athletics hall. Construction commenced in December 2012, with Nord-Berg as the main contractor. The arena's scheduled completion was in 2014, when it would become the third-largest indoor athletics arena in Norway, costing a total of NOK 123 million. The stadium was officially opened on 13 April 2015 with a game H\u00f8dd and Fredrikstad drew 1\u20131. In 2018, the stadium was used by NRK as set for the TV series Heimebane. ==Attendance== The record attendance at H\u00f8ddvoll is 3,003 spectators dates from 20 April 2015, a 2015 1. divisjon game H\u00f8dd won 3\u20130 against Brann. ==See also== *H\u00f8ddvoll Stadion ==References== Category:Football venues in Norway Category:Sports venues in M\u00f8re og Romsdal Category:Ulstein Category:IL H\u00f8dd Category:2014 establishments in Norway Category:Sports venues completed in 2014 ",
