In his sophomore season, Harrison led the Kangaroos to a second-place WAC finish and after averaging 17.5 points and 3.9 assists per game was named first-team all- conference and the WAC Player of the Year. A few weeks later, he was named an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press, making him the first All-American in program history. ===Dismissal=== In mid-November 2016, Harrison was suspended for a domestic assault charge under Title IX. Harrison was suspended indefinitely and was dismissed from the program on December 12, 2016. The charges were later dropped. ==Professional career== On September 4, 2017, Harrison signed with the Glasgow Rocks of the British Basketball League. == References == ==External links== *UMKC bio *Martez Harrison on RealGM Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball players Category:American expatriate basketball people in the United Kingdom Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Missouri Category:Glasgow Rocks players Category:Kansas City Roos men's basketball players Category:Point guards Category:Sportspeople from Kansas City, Missouri ",
