    "text": "The mediumwave transmitter Flevoland (Middengolf Zendstation Flevoland) was a broadcasting facility for medium wave near Zeewolde in the province of Flevoland, Netherlands, situated at 5\u00b025\u2032 E and 52\u00b023\u2032 N. It has been used for broadcasting on 747 kHz (until September 2015) and 1008 kHz with a nominal power of 400 kilowatts. As aerial two guyed steel framework masts with a height of 195 metres are used, which form an anti-fading aerial. These masts are grounded and carry a cage aerial, which is upperward the separation insulator, separating the masts in a height of 95 metres in two parts, connected toward the mast construction. The radiation diagram is directional, with a maximum gain of 4 dB in South-Eastern direction, to compensate for the variation in electrical admittance of terrain in the Netherlands. The station, which came into service in 1980, initially carried the programmes of Hilversum 1 and Hilversum 2. In 1985, following an overhaul of the Dutch public radio service, the frequencies were reassigned to NPO Radio 1 and NPO Radio 5 for 747 kHz and 1008 kHz respectively. In 2003, the 1008 kHz frequency was auctioned by the Dutch Government while NPO Radio 5 remained on 747 kHz. Since then, the 1008 kHz has been used by Radio 10 Gold (from 2004 to 2007) and Groot Nieuws Radio, a Dutch privately owned religious station.radioeins.de, \"Abschaltdatum f\u00fcr Mittelwellen 747 und 1251 kHz\" (German).
