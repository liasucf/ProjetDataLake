Her centerfold was photographed by Dwight Hooker. The image would later become a ubiquitous standard test image in the field of digital image processing, where the image is known as Lenna. == Career == === Modelling === Fors\u00e9n's career began by modelling jewellery and for catalogues in Chicago, Illinois, after moving to the United States from Sweden to be an au pair for a family member.

She was a guest at the 50th annual Conference of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology in 1997, where she gave a presentation about herself.Imaging Experts Meet Lenna in Person. Because of the ubiquity of her Playboy photo scan, she has been called the \"first lady of the internet\". The title was given to her by Jeff Seideman in a press release he issued announcing her appearance at the 50th annual IS&T; Conference. In January 2019 she said that while she wished she had been better compensated, she was \"really proud of that picture\".

It\u2019s time I retired from tech, too.\" === After modelling === In 1997, Fors\u00e9n worked for a government agency supervising handicapped employees, archiving data using computers and scanners. == Personal life == Fors\u00e9n has been married twice, has three children, and multiple grandchildren. == See also == * List of people in Playboy 1970\u20131979 * Standard test image == References == == External links == * Lenna's centerfold in the Playboy Archive, November 1972, pp 138-140 * * A Complete Story of Lenna (with one new picture of her) * The Lenna Story (contains a link to an un-cropped scan of the original Playboy centerfold) * A video artwork inspired by Lenna's story Category:1970s Playboy Playmates Category:1951 births Category:Glamour models Category:Living people Category:Swedish female models Category:People notable for being the subject of a specific photograph ",
