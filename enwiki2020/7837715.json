This criticism, which began in the spring of 2018, has mostly revolved around Jeenbekov's criticism of the government corruption that took place under his rule.

The trial has been largely moved online, given the pandemic, but Atambayev reportedly will not testify. Atambayev's lawyers maintain that the former president is immune from prosecution, given his status as a former president; the Kyrgyz parliament \u2013 in which Atambayev's former party, the Social Democratic Party (SDPK) holds the most seats \u2013 stripped him of that immunity in 2019.\" ===2020 protests=== On 5 October 2020, protests erupted with a crowd of 1,000 people, that grew to at least 5,000 people by evening in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, in protest against results and allegations of vote-buying in the October 2020 parliamentary election.
