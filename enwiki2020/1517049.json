    "text": "In mathematics, a Lidstone series, named after George James Lidstone, is a kind of polynomial expansion that can express certain types of entire functions. Let \u0192(z) be an entire function of exponential type less than (N + 1)\u03c0, as defined below. Then \u0192(z) can be expanded in terms of polynomials An as follows: :f(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left[ A_n(1-z) f^{(2n)}(0) + A_n(z) f^{(2n)}(1) \\right] + \\sum_{k=1}^N C_k \\sin (k\\pi z). Here An(z) is a polynomial in z of degree n, Ck a constant, and \u0192(n)(a) the nth derivative of \u0192 at a. A function is said to be of exponential type of less than t if the function :h(\\theta; f) = \\underset{r\\to\\infty}{\\limsup}\\, \\frac{1}{r} \\log |f(r e^{i\\theta})| is bounded above by t. Thus, the constant N used in the summation above is given by :t= \\sup_{\\theta\\in [0,2\\pi)} h(\\theta; f) with :N\\pi \\leq t < (N+1)\\pi. ==References== * Ralph P. Boas, Jr. and C.
