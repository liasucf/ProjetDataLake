It was of the Gregorian type. Kunitomo's telescope had a magnification of 60, and allowed him to make very detailed studies of sun spots and lunar topography. Four of his telescopes remain to this day. Kunimoto also developed manufacturing methods for guns, and also created an air gun based on rangaku knowledge acquired from the Dutch in Dejima. == Other uses of the name == *6100 Kunitomoikkansai, a main belt asteroid discovered in 1991, is named after Kunitomo Ikkansai.
