Immediately afterwards, he was sent to Hanover to assist Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen in enlarging the horse for her equestrian statue of Christian IX. In 1915, he presented Niobide, a statue of a boy, at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition, earning him a scholarship allowing him to travel widely in Europe. He became interested in classical Greek sculpture which became a constant source of inspiration in his later busts. His bronze masterpiece Josef (1939) was the culmination of several years' work in crafting youthful figures. After visiting Tunis in 1947, he developed a more intuitive approach. Gudmundsen- Holmgreen received many official commissions thanks to his fine eye for facial and psychological expression, although he was less adept in creating clothed figures. One of Gudmundsen-Holmgreen's best known works is the bust of Niels Bohr (1956) which stands on Frue Plads outside the University of Copenhagen. Gudmundsen-Holmgreen's brother Anders was also an artist while his son Pelle is a composer. ==Awards== In 1946, Gudmundsen-Holmgreen was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 1965, the Thorvaldsen Medal. ==References== ==External links== *Illustrated list of artworks by Gudmundsen-Holmgreen in Danish museums Category:1895 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:Recipients of the Thorvaldsen Medal Category:Recipients of the Eckersberg Medal Category:20th-century Danish sculptors Category:20th- century male artists Category:Place of death missing ",
