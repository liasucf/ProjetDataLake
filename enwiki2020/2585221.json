    "text": "Praslin is the second largest island (38.5 km2) of the Inner Seychelles, lying northeast of Mah\u00e9 in the Somali Sea. Praslin has a population of around 7,533 people and comprises two administrative districts: Baie Sainte Anne and Grand' Anse. The main settlements are the Baie Ste Anne, Anse Volbert and Grand' Anse. It was named Isle de Palmes by explorer Lazare Picault in 1744. During that time it was used as a hideaway by pirates and Arab merchants. In 1768 it was renamed Praslin in honor of French diplomat C\u00e9sar Gabriel de Choiseul, duc de Praslin. Praslin is known as a tourist destination with several hotels and resorts, as well as a number of beaches such as Anse Lazio and Anse Georgette. It has substantial tracts of tropical forests with birds such as the endemic Seychelles bulbul and the Seychelles black parrot. The Vall\u00e9e de Mai Nature Preserve, established in 1979,reserve info is known for the unique coco de mer and vanilla orchids. It has been reported that General Charles George Gordon of Khartoum (1833-1885) was convinced that Vall\u00e9e de Mai was the Biblical \"Garden of Eden\". Praslin is home to Praslin Island Airport, while surrounding islands include Curieuse Island, La Digue, Cousin Island, Cousine Island and Aride Island. There are a few near offshore islets including Round Island (0.193 km2) and Chauve Souris (0.007 km2), both of which have hotel accommodations. Twice in two weeks in August 2011 bull sharks entered the so- called 'safe bathing' area inside the coral reef of Anse Lazio and attacked and killed swimmers less than from shore. However, to put this in perspective, these were the first recorded fatal shark attacks in Seychelles for 50 years and none have been recorded after 2011. A large area in the south of the island has been designated as Praslin National Park and surrounding areas Important Bird Area. ==Gallery== File:Traumstrand Anse Georgette, Praslin Seychellen (27839767139).jpg|Beach Anse Georgette, Praslin File:Beach Anse Lazio Praslin Seychelles.DNG (38720879125).jpg|Beach Anse Lazio, Praslin File:Anse Lazio Beach, Seychelles (38720921075).jpg|Beach Anse Lazio File:Coco de Mer (39638784082).jpg|Coco de Mer from Praslin File:Insel Praslin, Seychellen (38908943104).jpg|Praslin, Seychellen File:Strand Petite Anse Kerlan, Praslin Seychellen (38908986064).jpg|Beach Petite Anse Kerlan, Praslin File:Seychelles large map.jpg|Praslin within Seychelles File:Praslin.svg|Map of Praslin File:Shorts360airsey.jpg|Praslin airport File:Seychelles praslin anselazio.jpg|Anse Lazio Beach on Praslin File:Seychelles bulbul.jpg|Seychelles bulbul (Hypsipetes crassirostris) on Praslin File:Valle\u00e9 de mai2.jpg|The Vall\u00e9e de Mai on Praslin Island.
