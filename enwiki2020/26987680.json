    "text": "Monaco was represented by 16-year-old French singer Dominique Dussault, with the song \"Marl\u00e8ne\", at the 1970 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 21 March in Amsterdam. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster TMC. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Dussault performed 10th in the running order, following Spain and preceding Germany. \"Marl\u00e8ne\" was a song in a pastiche style, in which Dussault compared herself unfavourably to her idol Marlene Dietrich. The song included spoken word singing lines in German and English in Dietrich's trademark style, which were passed by the European Broadcasting Union after suggestions from some other national delegations that they may have contravened the language rules in force at the time. Dussault's stage appearance looking dowdy and far older than her years provoked some comment, but it was pointed out that this fitted the lyrical theme of the song and it would have been incongruous for her to have performed looking glamorous and sophisticated. At the close of voting \"Marl\u00e8ne\" had received 5 points (2 from France and 1 each from Belgium, Spain and Switzerland), placing Monaco joint 8th (with Belgium and Italy) of the 12 entries.ESC History - Monaco 1970 ==See also== *Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1970 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970 Category:Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1970 in Monaco Category:Monaco stubs ",
