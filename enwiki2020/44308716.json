    "text": "The Russkaya Conservatoria Chamber Capella (, The Russian Conservatoire) is a Russian vocal and instrumental ensemble, founded in 2008 by Russian born conductor Nikolay Khondzinsky. The group gives regular performances in Moscow, and attends music festivals in Russia and elsewhere. The team have been seen as rediscoverers of forgotten masterpieces of Russian music of the 20th century, as well as of some European baroque music little known in Russia. They have also performed premieres of new music. ==Regular performances== The ensemble gives annual performances under the Terra Barocco project at Moscow concert halls (Moscow International House of Music, Moscow Conservatory, etc.)\u041b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, Georgy Chernyshov, http://www.proza.ru/2011/12/05/171 Strastnoj Bulleward Journal, http://www.strast10.ru/node/1303 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430, http://www.kpravda.ru/article/culture/012730/Music Web international, http://www.musicweb- international.com/classrev/2011/Nov11/Shebalin_TOCC0112.htm/DSCH Journal, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0442 May 2013, http://rm.mosconsv.ru/?p=5718/\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0442 November 2013, http://tribuna.mosconsv.ru/?p=4579 ==Festivals== The Russian Conservatoire has taken part in All-Russian and International festivals, such as: * \u201cSviridov December Evenings\u201d held annually at the composer\u2019s birthplace (2009) * 10th International Organ Festival of the Moscow Conservatory (2010) * International Bach festival \"From Christmas to Christmas\" (2010, 2011) ==Premieres== The work of \"Russkaya Conservatoriya\" includes international and national premieres: * Yuriy Abdokov \u2013 the world premiere of the ballet \"Three Poems\" (Moscow, 2014) * Jan Dismas Zelenka \u2013 the world first performance of Gloria ZWV 30; the first Russian performance of Miserere ZWV 56; the first Russian performance of Miserere ZWV 57; the world first performance of Kyrie, Sanctus and Agnus Dei ZWV 26; the first Russian performance of almost all orchestral compositions; * Georgy Sviridov \u2013 the first performance of the choruses from the cycle \"A hard times song\"; * Yuriy Abdokov \u2013 the first performance of orchestral music: \u2018Autumn Prayers\u2019, \u2018On the Verge of Thawing and Ice\u2019 and others; * Johann Sebastian Bach \u2013 the first Russian performance of a number of sacred cantatas and instrumental works; * Georg Philipp Telemann \u2013 the first Russian performance of cantatas \"Du aber Daniel, gehe hin\", \"Sei getreu bis in den Tod\"; etc. ==Current projects== Among current projects of Khondzinsky and the collective: * The first Russian performance of all Bach's sacred cantatas; * The first performance and recordings of compositions by G.
