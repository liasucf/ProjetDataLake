    "text": "Running Dog is a 1978 novel by Don DeLillo. At its center is a rumored pornographic film of Adolf Hitler, purportedly filmed in his bunker in the climactic days of Berlin's fall. The novel follows a journalist as she tries to penetrate a murky black market of wealthy erotic-art collectors in order to locate the film. The tale grows increasingly wild and violent as she closes in on this bizarre grail. The book derives its title from a fictional \"underground\" once-radical magazine. This publication also featured in Great Jones Street. Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Michael Wood wrote: \"the work itself has an air of weariness, of routine violence and acceptable paranoia, of intrigue without point or profit, which strikes me as a very accurate reflection of a contemporary mood.\"Wood M., Politics and Families, NYT, Nov. 12, 1978 ==See also== *Running dog Category:1978 American novels Category:Novels by Don DeLillo Category:Novels about Nazi Germany Category:Alfred A.
