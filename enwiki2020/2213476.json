    "text": "The Italian Unabomber () was an unknown terrorist that committed a series of bombings in the Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions of Italy from 1994 to 2006. The Italian Unabomber placed small booby-trapped objects in public spaces in Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia which were designed to detonate when handled by a passerby and seriously injure but not kill the victim. The Italian Unabomber was named by the international press in reference to Ted Kaczynski, the American Neo-Luddite terrorist and mail bomber known as the \"Unabomber\", but the Italian bomber made no political or economic demands. Over 20 explosive devices were attributed to the Italian Unabomber and resulted in numerous people receiving injuries including the removal of digits and limbs. On August 28, 2006, Italian police raided the house of Elvo Zornitta, a 49-year-old engineer, who had been under surveillance for a year with assistance from the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation. In January 2009, after years of investigations, the case was dropped after the prosecutors asked for its dismissal, for lack of evidence. Zornitta received \u20ac2,500,000 as compensation for his arrest and trial which included false evidence. ==Timeline of attacks== ===1994=== *August 21, 1994 **The first attack attributed to the bomber occurred during a bird parade attended by 50,000 in Sacile (near Pordenone).Bomb Injures Three at Bird Festival.
