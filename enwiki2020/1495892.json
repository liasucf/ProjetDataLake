    "text": "Mary Lucia (born August 6, 1970 in Newton, Massachusetts) is an on-air radio personality who currently hosts a weekday drive time music show for Minnesota Public Radio station 89.3 The Current in St. Paul, Minnesota. After Disney purchased Rev 105 and changed its name and format, Lucia maintained her dual role as host of a regular dayshift as well as a local music show called \"Popular Creeps\" (named after a song by former Replacements drummer Chris Mars). After Steve Nelson left the morning show that he co-hosted with Brian Oake, Lucia was paired with Oake for morning drive time. When Disney changed the format again to rhythmic oldies, the entire air staff, including Lucia, was fired. Lucia went on to host a program on AM 1500 and to cameo on KLBB before being picked up by Minnesota Public Radio in January 2005. Lucia has also appeared in commercials, live theater productions, freelanced for the Minnesota publication The Rake for 5 years, and appeared in the indie film The Last Word (2003). ==References== ==External links== * Shake-up in Radioland: The Current celebrates its first year * Mary Lucia Bio on Minnesota Public Radio Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:American radio personalities Category:Minnesota Public Radio people Category:People from Newton, Massachusetts Category:People from Minnesota ",
