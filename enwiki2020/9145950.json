    "text": "The Minister of Transport () is a Councillor of State and Chief of the Norwegian Ministry of Transport. The post has been held by Knut Arild Hareide of the Christian Democrats since 2020. The ministry is responsible for policy and public operations within postal services, telecommunications, civil aviation, public roads, rail transport and public transport, including ferry services that are part of national roads and coastal transport infrastructure. The ministry has seven agencies and four limited companies, including the airport operator Avinor, the Norwegian National Rail Administration, the Norwegian State Railways, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and Norway Post. There are also inspectorates and authorities related to accident investigation, civil aviation, and railways. The position was created with the ministry on 22 February 1946, when Nils Langhelle (Labour) was appointed. The ministry and minister position were split out from the Ministry of Labour. Twenty-eight people have held the position, representing six parties. Sixteen people have represented the Labour Party, five the Centre Party, two each the Christian Democratic Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party and one for the Progress Party. The longest-sitting minister is Kjell Opseth (Labour) who sat a week short of six years. Lars Leiro (Centre) sat for only four weeks, giving him the shortest tenure. He both succeeded and preceded Trygve Bratteli, the only person to have held the position twice and the only officeholder to later become Prime Minister. ==Key== The following lists the minister, their party, date of assuming and leaving office, their tenure in years and days, and the cabinet they served in. ==Ministers== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" ! scope=col class=unsortable | Photo ! scope=col | Name ! scope=col | Party ! scope=col | Took office ! scope=col | Left office ! scope=col | Tenure ! scope=col | Cabinet ! scope=col class=unsortable | Ref |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Gerhardsen II Torp || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Torp || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Gerhardsen III || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Gerhardsen III || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AACC99\" | Centre || || || || Lyng || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Gerhardsen IV || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Gerhardsen IV || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AACCFF\" | Conservative || || || || Borten || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Bratteli I || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AACC99\" | Centre || || || || Korvald || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Bratteli II || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Nordli || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Nordli || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Nordli Brundtland I || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AACCFF\" | Conservative || || || || Willoch I || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AACC99\" | Centre || || || || Willoch II || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Brundtland II || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Brundtland II || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFFFAA\" | Christian Democratic || || || || Syse || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Brundtland III || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Jagland || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AEE8A8\" | Liberal || || || || Bondevik I || align=center | |- | align=center | \u2014 ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFFFAA\" | Christian Democratic || || || || Bondevik I || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#FFB6B6\" | Labour || || || || Stoltenberg I || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AEE8A8\" | Liberal || || || || Bondevik II || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AACC99\" | Centre || || || || Stoltenberg II || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AACC99\" | Centre || || || || Stoltenberg II || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#AACC99\" | Centre || || || || Stoltenberg II || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#E1AFF8\" | Progress || || || || Solberg || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | | style=\"background:#E1AFF8\" | Progress || || || || Solberg || align=center | |- | align=center | 100x100px ! scope=row | Knut Arild Hareide | style=\"background:#FFFFAA\" | Christian Democratic || || present || || Solberg || align=center | |- |} ==References== Transport and Communications Norway Norway Category:1946 establishments in Norway Category:Transport organisations based in Norway ",
