He left the economic security he had as an artisan and the reciprocity he had with his family and wandered Palestine depending on charity.Fiensy (2007), p. 122. Many of the people on whom he depended for charity were women.Ryken (2012), p. 30. Because his ministry took place in the vicinity of his disciples' hometowns, it is likely that the group often slept at the homes of the disciples' family members.Becker (1998), p. 26. Of the Four Evangelists, Luke emphasizes Jesus' homelessness the most.Denaux (2010), p. 97. and both record a statement by Jesus in which he describes his homelessness by saying that \"foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head\".Stanton (2013), p. 220. The implication is that the scribe who has just offered to become a follower of Jesus should also expect the same.Matthew Henry's Commentary on Matthew 8, accessed 25 December 2016 Theologian John Gill noted a parallel between this saying and the Jews' expectation of the Messiah: \"if he (the Messiah) should come, 'there's no place in which he can sit down'.Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible on Matthew 8, referring to Talmud - Mas. Sanhedrin 96b, accessed 25 December 2016: \"Send ye a messenger to the ruler of the earth [i.e., Nebuchadnezzar] [that he may come] by way of the rocks [i.e., mountains] to the wilderness, [unto the mount of the daughter of Zion]. He sent back, \u2018If I come, I have no place for encamping\u2019.\" Sophiologists interpreted Jesus' homelessness as the homelessness of Sophia.Theissen (2009), p. 117.
