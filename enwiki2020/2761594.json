    "text": "\"Femme Fatale\" is a song by American rock band the Velvet Underground from their 1967 debut album The Velvet Underground & Nico, with lead vocals by Nico. ==Background== The song was composed in the key of C major. At the request of Andy Warhol, band frontman Lou Reed wrote the song about Warhol superstar Edie Sedgwick. According to Reed, Warhol said when asked what he should write about her: \"Oh, don't you think she's a femme fatale, Lou?\", so Reed wrote \"Femme Fatale\". The song was recorded with vocals by Nico. Guitarist Sterling Morrison said of the song: > \"Femme Fatale\"\u2014she [Nico] always hated that.[nasal voice] Nico, whose native > language is minority French, would say \"The name of this song is 'Fahm > Fatahl'.\" Lou and I would sing it our way. Nico hated that. I said, \"Nico, > hey, it's my title, I'll pronounce it my way\". \"Femme Fatale\" was recorded at the Scepter Studios in New York in April 1966 while the studio was still under construction. It was released as a B-Side to \"Sunday Morning\" in December 1966. The following year it was included in their debut album The Velvet Underground & Nico. A 1969 live recording of the song was included in Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes released in 2001. ==Critical reception== AllMusic critic Mark Deming thought that \"Femme Fatale\" was among the four best songs on the album. American music journalist Stephen Davis called \"Femme Fatale\" a beautiful song that portrays the vivid, conflicted and emotional undercurrents of 1966. ==Personnel== * Nicolead vocals * Lou Reedlead guitar, backing vocals * John Calepiano, bass * Sterling Morrisonlead guitar, backing vocals * Maureen Tuckersnare drum, tambourine ==References== Category:1966 singles Category:1966 songs Category:The Velvet Underground songs Category:Nico songs Category:Songs written by Lou Reed Category:Verve Records singles ",
