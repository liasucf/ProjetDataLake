The Vietnamese v\u0103n (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u6587; French: Sap\u00e8que) as a denomination for Vietnamese cash coins was used from 1868 until 1885 during the reign of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty (but appeared on cash coins until 1945). The inspiration to introduce the v\u0103n may have been to emulate the Chinese w\u00e9n used on contemporary Qing dynasty cash coins which had just become a fiat currency, however unlike the Chinese system where all Chinese cash coins were cast from the same metals the and the w\u00e9n was the primary unit of account, the Vietnamese system used the v\u0103n as a basic number currency symbol indicating how much zinc cash coins a brass cash coin was worth, while it used the m\u1ea1ch (\u964c) and qu\u00e1n (\u8cab) as units of account. It was abolished as a measurement for zinc cash coins when the French Indochinese piastre was introduced,Jean-Pascal Bassino and Hironobu Nakagawa, Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Policies in Vietnam Under French Rule, 1878-1945 after which the term still appeared on Vietnamese cash coins but represented a subdivision of the piastre known in French as sap\u00e8que as the production of zinc coinage was ceased by the Imperial government of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty around the year 1871. The French sap\u00e8que was worth of a piastre (a currency based on the Mexican peso) and represented Vietnamese cash coins in general. The Vietnamese term v\u0103n (\u6587) would appear on the Th\u00e0nh Th\u00e1i Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o (\u6210\u6cf0\u901a\u5bf6), Duy T\u00e2n Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o (\u7dad\u65b0\u901a\u5bf6), and B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o (\u4fdd\u5927\u901a\u5bf6) cash coins produced under French rule, the last of these was officially produced until 1945.French Southeast Asia Coins & Currency by Howard A.

Retrieved: 19 March 2019 == History == A T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o (\u55e3\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6) cash coin with the reverse inscription \"\u516d\u6587\" indicating that it was worth six pieces of zinc cash coins. It first used by official decree in January 1868 during the reign of the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Emperor which decreed that \"the value of the large module copper cash coin passed to 6 (zinc) and the small copper coin to 4 zinc\". In 1872 the first brass T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o (\u55e3\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6) cash coins with the monetary unit v\u0103n were cast in Hanoi, these cash coins has weight of 7 ph\u1ea7n and had the reverse inscription \"L\u1ee5c V\u0103n\" (\u516d\u6587) on them indicating that these coins were worth 6 zinc cash coins. The introduction of this new currency symbol marked the change in the relationship between Vietnamese cash coins made from copper and cash coins of zinc and it de facto increased the value of the Vietnamese brass cash currency. In November 1879 the official value of 6 copper ph\u1ea7n was equal to 6 sap\u00e8ques of zinc. However the foreign cash coinages as well as imitation (counterfeit) Vietnamese cash coins made of inferior alloys that circulated in Vietnam at the time were exchanged for only 3 cash coins of zinc.Art-Hanoi CURRENCY TYPES AND THEIR FACE VALUES DURING THE T\u1ef0 \u0110\u1ee8C ERA.
