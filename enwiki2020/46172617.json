Its form was described by Lucy S. Furman in December 1894 \"The Floatin' Bethel was made this way. There was two stories. The lower one was one long room, like a church, with the pulpit at one end, and benches set in rows all the way back, and big doors openin' out on both sides, so 's the gang-planks could be laid right to 'em for the people to get in easy, and the devil would n't have any room to talk about religious folks holdin' theirselves so up and above others. The top story had a hall down the middle, and sleepin'-rooms on each side. We eat in the hall, and had one of the little rooms for a cook-room. Then there was a real nice little steeple on top.\"The Floating Bethel in The Century Magazine http://www.unz.org/Pub/Century-1894dec-00297 == Destruction == The Floating Bethel burned down before it got out of the Ohio River. It caught fire and was completely destroyed in 1898 or 1899 according to different sources, yet timbers were salvaged from the wreck and were used in the construction of two homes in the Park View section of Moundsville. Both of these homes are in good condition and occupied.http://www.ohiomemory.org/cdm/ref/collection/p267401coll34/id/5091http://www.wvgenweb.org/marshall/trumpet.htm == Partial list of locations where evangelistic work was performed == * Moundsville * Rush Runhttp://replica.palni.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aupublic/id/393http://palni.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/aupublic/id/376 * Martins Ferry * Wellsburg * East Liverpoolhttps://www.newspapers.com/newspage/60799424/ * Steubenville Over forty congregations of the Church of God were started along its route. ==See also== D.S.
