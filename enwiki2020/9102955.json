    "text": "Martin Evan Jay (born 1944) is the Sidney Hellman Ehrman Professor of History Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. He is an intellectual historian whose research interests have connected history with other academic and intellectual activities, such as the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, social theory, cultural criticism, and historiography. He was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019. ==Career== Jay received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Union College in 1965. In 1971, he completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree in history at Harvard University under the tutelage of H. Stuart Hughes. His dissertation was later revised into the book The Dialectical Imagination, which covers the history of the Frankfurt School from 1923 to 1950. While he was conducting research for his dissertation, he established a correspondence and friendship with many of the members of the Frankfurt School. He was closest to Leo L\u00f6wenthal, who had provided him access to personal letters and documents for his research. Jay's work since then has explored Marxism, socialism, historiography, cultural criticism, visual culture, and the place of post-structuralism and post- modernism in European intellectual history. His current research is focused on nominalism and photography. He is a recipient of the 2010/2011 Berlin Prize Fellowship from the American Academy in Berlin. He also has a regular column in the quarterly journal Salmagundi. ==Personal life== Jay was born on May 4, 1944, in New York City. He is Jewish. He married the literary critic Catherine Gallagher circa 1973. ==Published works== *1973 The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923-50 * \u201cThe Concept of Totality in Luk\u00e1cs and Adorno\u201d.
