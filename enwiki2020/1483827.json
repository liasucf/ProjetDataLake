Sofiysk\u043e metro) is the rapid transit network servicing the Bulgarian capital city Sofia. It began operation on 28 January 1998. , the Sofia Metro consists of four interconnected lines, serving 43 stations, with a total route length of being among the top 20 of the most extensive European metro systems, ranking 19th as of 2020. The Metro links the densely populated districts of Lyulin \u2013 Mladost (M1 line \u2013 Red) and Nadezhda \u2013 Lozenets (M2 line \u2013 Blue), and serves the Sofia Airport. ==History== Planned since the 1960s, construction of the Metro was not officially launched until the late 1990s mainly because the city did not experience an urgent need for an underground system in addition to the stalled construction due to lack of sufficient funding. Another factor was the depth at which the construction works had to be carried out: being one of the oldest cities in Europe, Sofia contains many historical layers underneath its central areas. Evidence of antiquity can be clearly seen at the Serdika Station which exhibits a wealth of unearthed Thracian and Roman ruins and modern architecture. During the construction of the enormous complex of the National Palace of Culture two stations forming part of the then future M2 line and their connecting tunnels were built. The construction of the system began from the route that sees the highest volumes of passenger traffic, that can easily reach up to 38,000 at rush hour.Metropolitan Sofia \u2013 General Information ==Lines== Due to an increased population, there are a large number of passengers heading toward the city center during weekday mornings, and away from the city centre in the weekday evenings. The necessity of efficient public transport in the direction of the largest passenger flows, transport, and Sofia's environmental problems precipitated the start of the construction of the Sofia Metro. Following the ratification of a technical and economic report on the metro by the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, and the subsequently approved General City Plan, the general scheme for the development of the lines should consist of three diameters with extensions in the periphery, with a total length of , 63 metro stations, and a 1.1 million daily passenger capacity at the final stage of implementation. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Line !Opened !Current length (km [mi]) !Current stations !U/C length (km [mi]) !U/C stations !Planned length (km [mi]) !Planned stations |- | style=\"background:#e92228;\" |'''''' |1998 | |16 | |\u2013 |'''' |19 |- | style=\"background:#1c75bb;\" |'''''' |2012 | |13 | |\u2013 |'''' |18 |- | style=\"background:#41b24b;\" |'''''' |2020 | |8 | |4 |'''' |18 |- | style=\"background:#fdd304;\" |M4 |2015 | |20 |\u2013 |\u2013 | |20 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total: |'''''' |43 |'''''' |4 |'''''''''' |75 |} ===M1 line (Red)=== The first long section of M1 line consisting of five stations linking Slivnitsa Boulevard through Lyulin and K. Velichkov Boulevard was inaugurated on 28 January 1998. Opalchenska station entered into service on 17 September 1999 and Serdika station situated on St Nedelya Square followed on 31 October 2000, extending the total system length to . The operational section of the line was further extended with a long section, reaching Obelya housing estate in April 2003. The extension of M1 line continued in 2005 with the start of the construction of of tunnels and three stations linking St Nedelya Square and the Interped World Trade Center in Izgrev (station Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie). 2006 saw the start of the construction of another section of the same line (consisting of of tunnels and three stations) linking Izgrev and Mladost I housing estate. The completion of the first three stations was projected for the autumn of 2007, however as a result of various delays it was the second section from the first line (Vasil Levski stadium \u2013 Mladost 1) that first entered into service on 8 May 2009, operating for a brief period of time separately from the north-west portion of the line. The remaining section between Serdika and Vasil Levski stadium station finally entered into service on 7 September 2009 establishing an uninterrupted link between Obelya and Mladost 1 stations. The construction of the stretch from Mladost I to Business Park Sofia station (, three underground stations) began on 25 April 2013, and was completed on 8 May 2015. It cost BGN 85,767,683 (EUR 43,852,320), VAT exclusive, and serves the majority of the second most densely populated area in Sofia.Public Procurement Agency Portal - L1 S.

The section is long and includes 7 stations, two of them transfer to lines 1 and 2. With the announcement of the tender it became clear, that the initial plans for 19 stations had been partly amended and 2 of the stations will be not be built, one at Doyran boulevard and another at Shipka street. The tunnel of the central section shall be excavated by a TBM, while the construction of stations shall be awarded to other companies. The construction of the section shall be completed within 45 months. In January 2015, a tender for 20 trains, that shall serve the central section of the line, was announced. Driverless train operation, with Grade of Automation 3 (GoA 3), and platform screen doors will ensure the safety of the passengers. Unlike lines 1 and 2, where the trains collect power through a third rail, line 3 trains will be equipped with pantographs. CAF and Siemens applied bids in the tender for the trains, with Siemens winning it. In early 2016 construction began on the third metro line of the Sofia Metro using the technology for classic underground metro with high-power support. Under construction are all metro stations in the central section, plus a few in the west and east of downtown Sofia.
