    "text": "Gennaro Scognamiglio (born 24 April 1987) is an Italian footballer who plays for Serie B team Pescara. ==Early career== Born in Gragnano, Campania, he started his career in the youth teams of Treviso and later Salernitana. In 2005, he was signed to play for Serie D side Savoia, but didn't make any appearances for the first team in competitive matches. He moved on to Sangiuseppese, where he made 61 appearances, scoring 1 goal. ==Career== Scognamiglio signed for Crotone in Serie B in 2008. He made a six-month loan to Cosenza but was released by Crotone the day after its expiry and became a free agent. He was soon signed by Juve Stabia, where he remained for three years. In 2013, he moved to Parma but was immediately loaned to Perugia for one year. He left Parma soon after the expiry of the loan, moving to Benevento without making a single appearance for the Emilia-Romagna team. Scognamiglio remained at Benevento for one year, making 34 appearances and scoring 6 goals, establishing himself as a solid player for Juan Landaida's side as they were crowned champions of Lega Pro Group C, and gained promotion to Serie B. In the summer of 2015, Scognamiglio signed for Pisa, but he stayed in Tuscany for less than a month before being signed by Novara, back in Serie B. ===Novara=== Scognamiglio made his Novara debut on 13 August 2016, playing 120 minutes of the 1-0 (AET) win over Latina in the 2016\u201317 Coppa Italia. His league debut came nearly a month later, playing the full game against former club Pisa in a 1\u20130 loss. He scored his first goal for the club in Serie B Match Day 19, netting in the 39th minute of an eventual 3\u20131 win over Cesena. ===Pescara=== On 26 July 2018, he joined Serie B club Pescara. ==References== Category:1987 births Category:People from the Province of Naples Category:Sportspeople from Campania Category:Living people Category:Italian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:A.C.
