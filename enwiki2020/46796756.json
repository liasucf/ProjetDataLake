It is from Kumasi and lies on a hilly area thus the area is always cold. It is bounded on the north by the Ghana Highways Authority, Mampong; on the south by the Mampong Municipal Hospital; on the east by Mampong Babies' Home; and on the west by the Ejura-Mampong Highway. ==History== The school's history is traced to Rt Rev John Orfeur Aglionby, the Anglican Bishop of the Gold Coast whose missionary work birthed the Convent of Our Lady and Saint Monica. In 1926, the bishop invited the sisters of the Order of the Holy Paraclete (England) to set up a school for girl-child education. In 1946, St Monica's Secondary School in Mampong was established as a separate institution from the Teacher Training College. ==Notable alumnae== * Marian Ewurama Addy, biochemist * Yaa Ntiamoah Badu, zoologist; formerly Pro Vice Chancellor of the University of Ghana * Rose Atinga Bio, Director General of Research and Planning of the Ghana Police Service * Elizabeth Ofosu-Agyare, politician; formerly former Minister for Tourism, Culture and Creative Arts ==See also== * Christianity in Ghana * Education in Ghana * List of senior high schools in the Ashanti Region ==References== Category:1946 establishments in Gold Coast (British colony) Category:Anglican schools in Africa Category:Ashanti Region Category:Christian schools in Ghana Category:Girls' schools in Ghana Category:Educational institutions established in 1946 Category:High schools in Ghana Category:Public schools Category:St. Monica's Senior High School alumni ",
