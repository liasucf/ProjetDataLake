The Centre will run as a partnership between the Cross River State Government and Alliance Venue and Facility Management.http://www.conventioncentrecalabar.com/calabar-convention-centre- welcomes-new-management-team/ == Venues == The flexible building design allows for several types of events to take place at the same time.
