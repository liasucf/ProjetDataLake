His actions on arriving in the United States led to a major political and international incident, which was termed the Citizen Gen\u00eat Affair. Because of his actions, President George Washington asked the French government to recall him. The Mountain, having risen to power at the same time, replaced Gen\u00eat and issued a warrant for his arrest. Fearing for his life, Gen\u00eat asked for asylum in America, which was granted by Washington. Gen\u00eat stayed in the United States until his death. Historian Carol Berkin argues that the Gen\u00eat affair bolstered popular respect for the president and strengthened his role in dealing with in foreign affairs.Carol Berkin, A Sovereign People: The Crises of the 1790s and the Birth of American Nationalism (2017) pp 81\u2013150. ==Early life and education== Gen\u00eat was born in Versailles in 1763. He was the ninth and final child of a French civil servant, Edmond Jacques Gen\u00eat (1726\u20131781), who was a head clerk in the ministry of foreign affairs. The elder Gen\u00eat analyzed British naval strength during the Seven Years' War and monitored the progress of the American Revolutionary War. His eldest sister was Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, who became an educator and author. Agla\u00e9-Louise Augui\u00e9 (1782-1854), who was the wife of Marshal Ney of France, was Gen\u00eat's niece. Gen\u00eat was a prodigy who could read French, English, Italian, Latin, Swedish, Greek, and German by the age of 12. ==Career== At 18, Gen\u00eat was appointed court translator, and in 1788 he was sent to the French embassy in Saint Petersburg to serve as ambassador. Over time, Gen\u00eat became disenchanted with the ancien r\u00e9gime, learning to despise not just the French monarchy but all monarchical systems, including Tsarist Russia under Catherine the Great. In 1792, Catherine declared Gen\u00eat persona non grata, calling his presence \"not only superfluous but even intolerable.\" The same year, the Girondins rose to power in France and appointed Gen\u00eat to the post of minister to the United States. ===Citizen Gen\u00eat Affair=== President's House, Philadelphia. Washington confronted Gen\u00eat in the presidential mansion in Philadelphia, then the national capital. The Citizen Gen\u00eat affair began in 1793 when he was dispatched to the United States to promote American support for France's wars with Spain and Britain. Gen\u00eat arrived in Charleston, South Carolina on the French frigate Embuscade on April 8. Instead of traveling to the then-capital of Philadelphia to present himself to U.S. President George Washington for accreditation, Gen\u00eat stayed in South Carolina. There he was greeted with enthusiasm by the people of Charleston, who threw a string of parties in his honor. Gen\u00eat's goals in South Carolina were to recruit and arm American privateers who would join French expeditions against the British. He commissioned four privateering ships in total, including the Republicaine, the Anti-George, the Sans-Culotte, and the Citizen Gen\u00eat. Working with French consul Michel Ange Bernard Mangourit, Gen\u00eat organized American volunteers to fight Britain's Spanish allies in Florida. After raising a militia, Gen\u00eat set sail toward Philadelphia, stopping along the way to marshal support for the French cause and arriving on May 16. He encouraged Democratic-Republican societies, but President Washington denounced them and they quickly withered away. He was also hosted by the Democratic- Republican Tammany Society in 1793. His actions endangered American neutrality in the war between France and Britain, which Washington had pointedly declared in his Neutrality Proclamation of April 22. When Gen\u00eat met with Washington, he asked for what amounted to a suspension of American neutrality to support the cause of France. When turned down by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and informed that his actions were unacceptable, Gen\u00eat protested. Meanwhile, Gen\u00eat's privateers were capturing British ships, and his militia was preparing to move against the Spanish. Gen\u00eat continued to defy the wishes of the United States government, capturing British ships and rearming them as privateers. Washington sent Gen\u00eat an 8,000-word letter of complaint on Jefferson's and Hamilton's advice \u2013 one of the few situations in which the Federalist Alexander Hamilton and the Republican Jefferson agreed. Gen\u00eat replied obstinately. President Washington and his Cabinet then demanded that France recall Gen\u00eat as its Ambassador. The Mountain, having taken power in France by January 1794, issued an arrest warrant for Gen\u00eat. Gen\u00eat, knowing that he would likely be sent to the guillotine, asked Washington for asylum. Hamilton, Gen\u00eat's fiercest opponent in the cabinet, convinced Washington to grant him safe haven in the United States. ===Later life=== Portrait of Gen\u00eat by Ezra Ames, 1809-10 After obtaining asylum in the United States from Washington, Gen\u00eat moved to New York State. On June 26, 1808, Gen\u00eat wrote an article, \"Madison as a 'French Citizen,'\" for the New York Register in an attempt to promote the prospects of his father-in-law, the incumbent Vice President George Clinton, over James Madison in the presidential election of 1808. Noting the honorary French citizenship afforded Madison in 1792, Gen\u00eat reasoned that the Embargo Act of 1807 had been intended by Secretary of State Madison to aid Napoleon in the enforcement of the Berlin Decree, especially seeing that American trade with Britain was more important than that with France. Playing to a northeastern audience, Gen\u00eat continued that, judging by Jefferson's glorification of an agricultural lifestyle in Notes on the State of Virginia, the Embargo was also acting as a covert means to destroy New England's commercial heritage. As such, New Englanders would be forced to turn to agriculture, and Virginia's dominance of American politics would continue.Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Fred L. Israel, and William P. Hansen, eds., History of American Presidential Elections: 1789-1968, vol. 1 (New York: Chelsea House, 1985), 234-35. ==Personal life== Cornelia Clinton Gen\u00eat Gen\u00eat married Cornelia Tappen Clinton (1774\u20131810) in 1794, the daughter of New York Governor George Clinton. Gen\u00eat lived on a farm he called Prospect Hill located in East Greenbush, New York overlooking the Hudson River. Living the life of a gentleman farmer, he wrote a book about inventions. Their children included: * Edmond Charles Genet (1797\u20131802), who died young. * Henry James Genet (1800\u20131872), a member of the State Assembly in 1832 who married Martha Elizabeth Taylor (1809\u20131896). * Maria Louisa Genet (1802\u20131888), who married Cornelius Van Buren Van Rensselaer (1793\u20131868), son of Col.

His wife Cornelia died in 1810, and on July 31, 1814, Gen\u00eat remarried to Martha Brandon Osgood (1787\u20131853), the daughter of Samuel Osgood, the United States' first Postmaster General. Together, they were the parents of: * Henriette Campan Genet (1815\u20131826), who died young. * Edmond Charles Genet (b. 1816), who died young. * Samuel Osgood Genet (1819\u20131824), who died young. * Edme Jacques Genet (1821\u20131891), who married Magdelene Van Rensselaer Witbeck (1813\u20131900).

He was in the midst of his six-month training to become a fighter pilot Edmond Charles Clinton Genet (1896\u20131917), who served with the Lafayette Escadrille and was the first American flier to die in the First World War after the United States declared war against Germany in 1917, was Gen\u00eat's great-grandson. ==Legacy== The elementary school in East Greenbush, New York is named Citizen Genet Elementary School. ==See also== * Franco-U.S. relations ==References== ;Notes ;Sources ==Further reading== * Ammon, Harry.
