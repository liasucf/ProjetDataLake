It is self-dual. Every vertex is shared by 3 triangular edges.Coxeter and Shephard, 1991, p.30 and p.47 Coxeter named it a M\u00f6bius\u2013Kantor polygon for sharing the complex configuration structure as the M\u00f6bius\u2013Kantor configuration, (83).Coxeter and Shephard, 1992 Discovered by G.C. Shephard in 1952, he represented it as 3(24)3, with its symmetry, Coxeter called as 3[3]3, isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group, order 24. == Coordinates== The 8 vertex coordinates of this polygon can be given in \\mathbb{C}^3, as: {| class=wikitable | (\u03c9,\u22121,0)||(0,\u03c9,\u2212\u03c92)||(\u03c92,\u22121,0)||(\u22121,0,1) |- | (\u2212\u03c9,0,1)||(0,\u03c92,\u2212\u03c9)||(\u2212\u03c92,0,1)||(1,\u22121,0) |} where \\omega = \\tfrac{-1+i\\sqrt3}{2} . == As a Configuration== The configuration matrix for 3{3}3 is:Coxeter, Complex Regular polytopes, p.117, 132 \\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}8&3\\\\\\3&8\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ] == Real representation == It has a real representation as the 16-cell, , in 4-dimensional space, sharing the same 8 vertices. The 24 edges in the 16-cell are seen in the M\u00f6bius\u2013Kantor polygon when the 8 triangular edges are drawn as 3-separate edges. The triangles are represented 2 sets of 4 red or blue outlines. The B4 projections are given in two different symmetry orientations between the two color sets. {| class=wikitable |+ orthographic projections |- style=\"text- align:center;\" !Plane !colspan=2|B4 !F4 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" !Graph |120px |120px |120px |- style=\"text-align:center;\" !Symmetry |colspan=2|[8] |[12/3] |} == Related polytopes== {| class=wikitable align=right width=300 |150px This graph shows the two alternated polygons as a compound in red and blue 3{3}3 in dual positions. |150px 3{6}2, or , with 24 vertices in black, and 16 3-edges colored in 2 sets of 3-edges in red and blue.Coxeter, Regular Complex Polytopes, p. 109 |} It can also be seen as an alternation of , represented as . has 16 vertices, and 24 edges. A compound of two, in dual positions, and , can be represented as , contains all 16 vertices of . The truncation , is the same as the regular polygon, 3{6}2, . Its edge-diagram is the cayley diagram for 3[3]3. The regular Hessian polyhedron 3{3}3{3}3, has this polygon as a facet and vertex figure. == Notes== == References== * Shephard, G.C.; Regular complex polytopes, Proc. London math. Soc.
