The participants were the women's national sides of Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Sierra Leone. Matches were recognised as official WT20I games as per ICC's announcement that full WT20I status would apply to all matches played between women's teams of associate members after 1 July 2018. The matches were played at two grounds at the Botswana Cricket Association Oval in Gaborone. Namibia Women won the tournament after winning all of their matches, including a victory over Sierra Leone in the final. Zambia also took part in the tournament but their matches did not have WT20I status due to their squad including a non-eligible player, and their results are not included in the coverage provided by Cricinfo. ==Round-robin stage== ===Points table=== ===Matches=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Playoffs== ===Fifth-place playoff=== ===Third-place playoff=== ===Final=== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:Cricket in Botswana Category:2018 in women's cricket ",
