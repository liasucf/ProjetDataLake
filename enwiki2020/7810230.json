    "text": "Live a Little is an album by Pernice Brothers, released in 2006. ==Track listing== In the booklet for the CD, the song High As A Kite, there are several references to The Clash, \"heavy downbeat of one and the show began/london calling, strike up the contraband/\" and \"we wore pictures of Strummer/fell over ourselves all summer\", more than likely referring to Joe Strummer. On this CD, Joe Pernice's brother Bob plays electric guitar on several songs: they are \"Automaton\", \"Zero Refills\", \"PCH One\", \"Lightheaded\" and \"High As A Kite\". Bob is an occasional fixture in the band, though he does not play with them all the time. Category:Pernice Brothers albums Category:2006 albums ",
