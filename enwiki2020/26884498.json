    "text": "Cryptodontia is a group of dicynodont therapsids that includes the families Geikiidae, Oudenodontidae, and Rhachiocephalidae. It was first named in 1860 by English paleontologist Richard Owen. Owen intended Cryptodontia to be a family, and the name was later changed to \"Cryptodontidae\" to reflect this ranking. The name Cryptodontia was restored in 2009 when it was redefined as a larger clade containing several families of dicynodonts. ==Classification== Below is a cladogram from Kammerer et al. (2011) showing the phylogenetic placement of Cryptodontia: ==References== Category:Dicynodonts Category:Guadalupian first appearances Category:Permian extinctions ",
