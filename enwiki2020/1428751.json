    "text": "\"Have a Cigar\" is the third track on Pink Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were Here. It follows \"Welcome to the Machine\" and on the original LP opened side two. In some markets, the song was issued as a single. The song, written by Waters, is his own critique of the music industry at the time, and the hypocrisy of the band's record label to continue releasing more material. English folk singer Roy Harper provided lead vocals on the song. It was one of only two Pink Floyd recordings with a guest singer on lead vocals, the other being \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" with Clare Torry. ==Composition and recording== The song's music and lyrics were written by Roger Waters in critique of hypocrisy and greed within the music business. Waters has frequently implied it to be a follow-up to \"Money\" with the lyrics representing the demands of a record executive after the runaway success of The Dark Side of the Moon. The song is more straightforwardly rock-oriented than the rest of the album, and is the only one on the album that starts abruptly (the other four either fade in or segue from the previous song). It begins with a churning riff played on electric guitar and bass and is filled out with additional guitar, electric piano and synthesizer parts to create a rock texture. \"Have a Cigar\" concludes with a guitar solo, which is abruptly interrupted by a synthesizer filter-sweep sound effect as the music reduces in volume to tinny, AM radio-like levels. Finally, the song ends with the sound of a radio being dialled off-station; this effect is used as a transition to the title track, \"Wish You Were Here\". The song's lead vocals are performed by Roy Harper. Waters and David Gilmour had each attempted to sing the song on separate takes, as well as on a duet version (available on the 2011 Experience and Immersion editions of Wish You Were Here), but they were unhappy with the results. Harper was recording his album HQ in Studio 2 of Abbey Road at the same time as Pink Floyd were working in Studio 3, and Roy Harper offered to sing the part as Gilmour had already provided some guitar licks for Roy (\"...for a price\"). In his book Pigs Might Fly: The Inside Story of Pink Floyd, author Mark Blake recounts that Gilmour had been unwilling to sing the lead vocal as he didn't share Waters' opinions, as expressed in the lyrics, on the nature of the music industry. Waters has since said he dislikes Harper's version, saying he would have liked it to emerge \"more vulnerable and less cynical\", adding that Harper's version was too parodic while Gilmour loved Harper's vocal delivery and called it the \"perfect version\". ==Live== Harper performed the song with the band on one occasion, the group's 1975 Knebworth Festival appearance, during the period Wish You Were Here was being recorded. The song was also performed on the band's 1975 North American tours sandwiched in between the multi-part \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", with Gilmour and Waters singing lead. It was last performed by the band on the 1977 In the Flesh tour, as part of the Wish You Were Here set with Waters on lead vocals, Gilmour on backing vocals and rhythm guitar and Snowy White playing the guitar solos. Waters has also played the song on his solo tours, except for the 1999\u20132002 In the Flesh tour and the 2017 Us + Them Tour. ==Personnel== * David Gilmour \u2013 electric guitars * Richard Wright \u2013 Wurlitzer electric piano, ARP String Synthesizer, Minimoog, Hohner clavinet D6, piano * Roger Waters \u2013 bass * Nick Mason \u2013 drums with: * Roy Harper \u2013 lead vocals ==Quotes== ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1975) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |US Cash Box Looking Ahead |align=\"center\"|119 |- |US Record World Singles Chart 101\u2013150 |align=\"center\"|126 |} ==Cover versions== * In 1979, Warner Bros. Records released a 12\" single containing a special disco version of \"Have a Cigar\" by Rosebud, a studio group led by composer Gabriel Yared, from their album Discoballs: A Tribute to Pink Floyd. The song peaked at number 4 on Billboard's Disco Top 80 chart in June 1979. The B-side was a disco version of \"Money\". * In 1992, the band Primus recorded a cover of the song and included it as the closing track to their Miscellaneous Debris EP. Their version changed the lyrics slightly: \"The band is just fantastic, of the town you are the talk/Man, but who the hell's this guy they call Bob Cock?\" * Foo Fighters recorded two different cover versions of the song. The first was used as b-side for the \"Learn to Fly\" CD single, while the second one, with Brian May on lead guitar, first appeared on the Mission: Impossible 2 soundtrack, and later as an Amazon.com bonus track on their 2009 Greatest Hits album and in the 2011 limited-edition vinyl only release Medium Rare, released for Record Store Day. Both versions were sung by drummer Taylor Hawkins. * The album Instead, released in 2007 by Onetwo, contains a cover version of \"Have a Cigar\". * The main riff of \"Have a Cigar\" is incorporated into the song \"Peruvian Skies\" by progressive metal band Dream Theater on their 1998 live album Once in a LIVEtime and on the Live DVD 5 Years in a Livetime. Also, from their album Images and Words (1992), using the main riff from \"Have a Cigar\" at the beginning of \"Metropolis: Part I\". * A free CD given with the October 2011 issue of UK music magazine Mojo includes a cover version of \"Have a Cigar\" by John Foxx and The Maths. This version was later announced by Mojo as 'not the finished version' and the correct version was offered as a free download from the website. * Gov't Mule performed the song as part of their Dark Side of the Mule live album from 2008, which consisted of half original material, half Pink Floyd covers. * Fidlar recorded a cover of the song featuring Dr. Dre and AM in 2018 with slightly modified lyrics (\u201cWe\u2019ll buy you a new liver. By the way, which one is FIDLAR/fiddler?\u201d). == References == ==External links== * Category:1975 singles Category:Metasongs Category:Pink Floyd songs Category:Primus (band) songs Category:Protest songs Category:Satirical songs Category:Songs about music Category:Songs written by Roger Waters Category:Song recordings produced by David Gilmour Category:Song recordings produced by Roger Waters Category:Song recordings produced by Richard Wright (musician) Category:Song recordings produced by Nick Mason Category:Roy Harper (singer) songs Category:1975 songs Category:CBS Records singles Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Harvest Records singles ",
