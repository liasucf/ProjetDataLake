Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 20, 2019 == Reception == In his review on Allmusic, Ken Dryden noted \"Since the two had worked together on a number of recording sessions previously, they were very familiar with each other's skills and they mesh very well on all five of the standards on this date. Williams is not a mere accompanist but a musical equal who finds interesting paths when the pianist is in the lead. Barron's inventive approach to these chestnuts is always inventive ... This rewarding date should be considered essential\". On All About Jazz, reviewer C. Michael Bailey stated \"This duet clinic included everything a student of the genre would need to know. The vehicles are a collection of lengthy standards, all well played. Barron and Williams allow one another to stretch out with a great effect\".Bailey, C. M.
