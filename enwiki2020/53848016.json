He attended elementary and secondary madrasa in Novi Pazar, received a bachelor's degree in Bosnian literature and the Bosnian language at the University of Sarajevo (2007), and subsequently received a master's degree (2012) and a Ph.D. (2013) from the International University of Novi Pazar.

In 2010, Serbia organized the first direct elections to the country's national minority councils. Fehratovi\u0107 contested the Bosniac National Council election at the head of an electoral list for the Bosniak Cultural Community, which was aligned with Chief Mufti Muamer Zukorli\u0107. This list won seventeen seats, as against thirteen for the Bosniak List led by Sulejman Ugljanin and five for the Bosniak Renaissance list of Rasim Ljaji\u0107. These results proved to be extremely contentious, and the legitimacy of the Bosniak Cultural Community's victory was contested by both the Serbian government and Ugljanin's party. Fehratovi\u0107 was chosen as president of the Bosniac National Council's executive committee, but his leadership was not recognized by the Serbian government. The council's responsibilities were officially suspended shortly thereafter, although it continued to meet in defiance of the government's decision.Gordana Andric, \"Serbia Reshuffle Fuels Bosniak Council Vote Confusion\", Balkan Insight, 17 March 2011, accessed 21 April 2017. Zukorli\u0107 ran for president of Serbia as an independent candidate in the 2012 presidential election, and Fehratovi\u0107 oversaw his campaign headquarters.JAHJA FEHRATOVI\u0106, Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 21 April 2017. The following year, the pro-Zukorli\u0107 wing of the BDZ held a special convention that deposed Emir Elfi\u0107 as party leader and selected Fehratovi\u0107 in his place. Elfi\u0107 rejected this decision, arguing that the resolutions approved at the convention were unlawful and constituted an act of \"aggression\" on the BDZ.\"Serbian paper looks at rifts in Bosniak party,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 2 April 2013 (Source: Politika website, Belgrade, in Serbian 1 Apr 13). This controversy appears to have resulted in a party split; the supporters of Zukorli\u0107 and Fehratovi\u0107 coalesced as the BDZS later in 2013, with Fehratovi\u0107 recognized as party leader.BDZ Sand\u017eaka \u2013 Sa novom snagom i novim ljudima spremna za izbore, Elektronske Novine Sand\u017eak Press, 25 December 2015, accessed 21 April 2017. This source is strongly aligned with the BDZ-S. A new election was organized for the Bosniac National Council in 2014, and Fehratovi\u0107 contested the election as the leader of a list called \"For Bosniaks, Sandzak and the Mufti.\" This list was defeated, nineteen seats to sixteen, by Ugljanin's \"For Bosniak Unity,\" the only other party to appear on the ballot.\u0418\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0447\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0441\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0448\u045a\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u045a\u0438\u043d\u0435, \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438 26. \u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430 \u0438 2. \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043c\u0431\u0440\u0430 2014. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 (\u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438) , Republika Srbija - Republi\u010dka izborna komisija, accessed 21 April 2017.

Ultimately, however, Fehratovi\u0107 accepted his list's defeat and agreed to serve in opposition; in so doing, he said that Ugljanin would need to break his connections to Adem Zilki\u0107, one of Zukorli\u0107's rivals in the Islamic Community in Serbia, if Ugljanin's group wanted to cooperate with his own.\"Serbia's new ethnic council to resolve disputes among Bosniaks - chairman,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 2 December 2014 (Source: Politika website, Belgrade, in Serbian 27 Nov 14). Fehratovi\u0107 condemned the physical threats against Serbian prime minister Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 at a 2015 commemoration for the victims of the Srebrenica massacre, saying that those who threatened Serbia's prime minister did a disservice to the Bosniak community. He also urged a full and lasting reconciliation between the Serbian and Bosniak communities.Reagovanja na napad na premijera, protestna nota BiH, Radio Television of Serbia, 11 July 2015, accessed 21 April 2017.

The list won two parliamentary mandates, and Zukorli\u0107 and Fehratovi\u0107 were duly declared elected. They initially served as independent members of the assembly, although they were formally recognized as representatives of the Justice and Reconciliation Party in December 2017. The Justice and Reconciliation Party is aligned with Serbia's coalition government led by the Progressive Party.
