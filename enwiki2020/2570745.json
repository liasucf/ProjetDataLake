    "text": "The general structure of an iminium cation An iminium cation in organic chemistry is a functional group with the general structure [R1R2C=NR3R4]+. They are common in synthetic chemistry and biology. ==Structure== Imininium cations adopt alkene-like geometries. The central C=N unit is nearly coplanar with all four substituents. The C=N distances, which are near 129 picometers in length, are shorter than C-N single bonds. Cis/trans isomers are observed. Structure of the cation in the salt [Me2N=C(H)tolyl]+OTf\u2212 illustrating the near planarity of the iminium functional group.. ==Formation== Iminium cations are obtained by protonation and alkylation of imines: :RN=CR'2 \\+ H+ \u2192 [RNH=CR'2]+ :RN=CR'2 \\+ R\"+ \u2192 [RR\"N=CR'2]+ They also are generated by the condensation of secondary amines with ketones or aldehydes: :O=CR'2 \\+ R2NH + H+ [R2N=CR'2]+ \\+ H2O This rapid, reversible reaction is one step in \"iminium catalysis\". More exotic routes to iminium cations are known, e.g. from ring- opening reactions of pyridine. ==Occurrence== Iminium derivatives are common in biology. Pyridoxal phosphate reacts with amino acids to give iminium derivatives. Many iminium salts are encountered in synthetic organic chemistry. \"Eschenmoser's salt\" is a well known example of an iminium salt. ==Reactions== Iminium salts hydrolyse to give the corresponding ketone or aldehyde: :[RR\"N=CR'2]+ \\+ H2O \u2192 [RR\"NH2]+ \\+ O=CR'2 Iminium cations are readily reduced to the amines, e.g. by sodium cyanoborohydride. They are intermediates in the reductive amination of ketones and aldehydes. ===Named reactions involving iminium species=== *Aza-Cope rearrangement *Beckmann rearrangement *Duff reaction *Mannich reaction *Pictet-Spengler reaction *Stephen reaction *Stork enamine alkylation *Vilsmeier-Haack reaction and Vilsmeier reagent ==Iminylium ions== Iminylium ions have the general structure R2C=N+.
