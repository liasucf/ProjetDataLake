Ultimately, this sparked her career as a photographer where she photographed the transgender community for over 20 years. In 1978, Allen was staying in the same hotel with a group of cross- dressers celebrating Mardi Gras and was inspired to be begin photographing the intimate and often secretive lives of cross-dressers and transgender individuals. She grew into photojournalism and advocacy for the emergent transgender rights movement in the 1990s. She aims to photograph misunderstood communities in the \"daylight of everyday life\" and capture humanity with their families, in their careers, at their homes. Allen wrote Transformations: Crossdressers and Those Who Love Them in 1989. This book depicts the lives of heterosexual, married men who cross dress. She includes black and white portrait and interviews of her subjects. In her second book The Gender Frontier (2003), Allen documents the transgender community through political movements and public demonstrations. In 2005, the book was awarded the Lambda Literary Award in the transgender category. Allen has contributed her work to magazines, books, photography exhibitions and documentaries all over the world. Allen's career highlights include being the photographer for Lee Grant's 1984 documentary What Sex Am I?, Southern Comfort (2001), and Rosa von Praunheim's The Transsexual Menace.
