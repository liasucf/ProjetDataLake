    "text": "Lynn Shore Drive is an historic oceanfront parkway in Lynn, Massachusetts. Composed of a two-lane road, parkland, a seaside pedestrian esplanade, and a seawall, Lynn Shore Drive runs for approximately along Lynn's Atlantic Ocean coastline, following the upland boundary of the adjoining Lynn Shore Reservation, and connecting Nahant with Swampscott. Known for its scenic views of the open Atlantic, Nahant Bay, Egg Rock, and Boston Skyline, Lynn Shore Drive is part of the Essex Coastal Scenic Byway and forms the southeasterly edge of the National Register Diamond Historic District. The Lynn Shore Drive seawall is a contributing resource to the National Register District--as are many of the historic homes lining the drive\u2019s inland edge. An early example of a parkway, and distinctive by virtue of its oceanfront setting, Lynn Shore Drive opened to the public in 1907. Prior to the drive\u2019s creation, Lynn\u2019s oceanfront was held largely in private estates and was not accessible to the public. The effort to create Lynn Shore Drive was pioneered in part by George N. Nichols, a Lynn resident who, in 1874\u2014at age 19\u2014petitioned Lynn\u2019s City Council to appropriate for public use the lands along the Diamond District\u2019s oceanfront. Between 1895 and 1903, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u2019 Metropolitan District Commission acquired land parcels encompassing a substantial stretch of Lynn\u2019s coastline, laying the groundwork for the construction of Lynn Shore Drive--and the contemporaneous creation of the adjoining Lynn Shore and Nahant Beach Reservations. Lynn Shore Drive is today managed by the Metropolitan District Commission's successor agency, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. ==References== Category:Parkways in Massachusetts ",
