Its lyrics are in Telugu; the music is set in the Sri Ragam and is in Aadi Talam. It is among the Pancharatna Kritis (\"five gems\") of Tyagaraja. == Legend behind the song == By legend, Endaro Mahanubhavulu, one of Thyagaraja's most famous compositions, was composed after he heard Shadkala Govinda Marar, a famous carnatic musician from Kerala, sing. He was a contemporary of Saint Ty\u0101gar\u0101ja and Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. Marar is said to have used a Tamburu having seven strings. == Ragam == The kriti is set to Sri Ragam, which is a janya of the 22nd melakarta, Kharaharapriya. ===Scale=== *Aarohanam : S R2 M1 P N2 S' *Avarohanam : S' N2 P D2 N2 P M1 R2 G2 R2 S == Lyrics == Pallavi Endar\u014d mah\u0101nubh\u0101vulu andar\u012bki vandanamulu endar\u014d Anupallavi Canduru var\u1e47uni andacandamunu hr\u0325day\u0101ravindamuna j\u016bci brahm\u0101nanda manubhavin\u0304cuv\u0101 Charanam 1 S\u0101mag\u0101nal\u014dla manasija l\u0101va\u1e47ya dhan'yam\u016brdan'yu M\u0101nasavanacara varasan\u0304c\u0101ramu nilipi m\u016brti b\u0101gug\u0101 poga\u1e0dan\u0113v\u0101 Saragusa b\u0101damulaku sv\u0101ntamanu Sar\u014djamunu samarpa\u1e47amu s\u0113yuv\u0101 Patitap\u0101vanu\u1e0dan\u0113 par\u0101tparu gurin\u0304ci Baram\u0101rthamagu nijam\u0101rgamut\u014dnu b\u0101\u1e0ducunu Sall\u0101pamut\u014d svaralay\u0101di r\u0101gamula teliyuv\u0101 Hari gu\u1e47ama\u1e47ulagu saramulu ga\u1e37amuna \u015a\u014dbhillu bhaktak\u014d\u1e6du lilal\u014d telivit\u014d celimit\u014d Garu\u1e47agalgi jagamellanu sudh\u0101dr\u0325\u1e63\u1e6dic\u0113 br\u014dcuv\u0101.
