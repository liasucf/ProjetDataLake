    "text": "Cherry Alive is the second studio album by the alternative rock band Eve's Plum. It was released in 1995 on 550 Records. After the major failure of their debut, Eve's Plum switched producers and wrote more radio-friendly music. The album's first single, \"Jesus Loves You (Not As Much As I Do)\" failed to gain interest from mainstream radio and the album failed to chart when it was released. The second single, \"Wishing The Day Away\", was released to radio without a music video to accompany it and failed to chart as well. The third, and final, single, the album's title track, gained some airplay on college radio, but still failed to chart. After the lack of sales for the album, Sony/550 dropped the band, who split three years later. ==Track listing== All lyrics and music by Eve's Plum. #\"Jesus Loves You (Not As Much As I Do)\" #\"Wishing The Day Away\" #\"Want You Bad\" #\"Loved By You\" #\"Fairy Princess\" #\"Cherry Alive\" #\"Lipstuck\" #\"Sticky And Greasy\" #\"Beautiful\" #\"Serious Stuff\" #\"Dog In My Heart\" #\"Only Anger\" ==Personnel== *Eve's Plum (main performer) **Colleen Fitzpatrick (vocals) **Michael Kotch (guitar) **Ben Kotch (drums) **Theo Mack (bass) *Fred Maher (producer) *Lloyd Puckitt (engineer) *Sara Rotman (art direction) *Sara Rotman (design) *Victoria Clamp (background vocals) *Michael McLaughlin (photography) ==References== Category:1995 albums Category:Eve's Plum albums ",
