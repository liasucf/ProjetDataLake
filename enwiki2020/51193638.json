Others of the kind, namely MPEP & MTEP, are not considered to have translational potential for human use due to off-target effects and short half-lives. Drugs of this kind have been used to offset craving for drugs of abuse such as cocaine in in vivo animal administration models. == See also == * Fenobam * CTEP == References == Category:MGlu5 receptor antagonists ",
