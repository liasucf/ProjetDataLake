    "text": "Aloy is the protagonist in the 2017 video game Horizon Zero Dawn and its upcoming sequel Horizon Forbidden West. Born on April 4th, 3021 and raised by an outcast named Rost in a lush post-apocalyptic world, he trains her to be a skilled warrior in order to win the Proving, a ritual competition held by the Nora tribe, and discover her mother's identity. After narrowly evading an assassination attempt, she embarks on a journey to stop a cult that worships an artificial intelligence bent on the world's destruction, while also hunting machines that have grown hostile to humans. She has been critically praised for her design and characterization. She is voiced by American voice actress Ashly Burch and modeled after Dutch actress Hannah Hoekstra. == History == Aloy is first introduced as an infant who has been entrusted to Rost's care, and mysteriously declared an outcast by the Nora tribe. Six years later, while exploring on her own, she falls into a forbidden bunker that was created by ancient humans. While trying to escape from the destroyed facility, she discovers an augmented reality device known as a Focus before being rescued by Rost. Despite his misgivings, Rost allows her to keep the Focus, which she soon develops an affinity for. The next morning, while learning to hunt with Rost, she uses the Focus to rescue Teb, an injured member of the Nora tribe who has recklessly fallen into the path of machines. Aloy expresses the desire to learn the identity of her mother, and Rost suggests training to compete in the Proving, a coming-of-age ritual that would not only allow her entry into the Nora, but give her the answers she seeks as a boon if she wins. The game skips forwards twelve years to when she has become a skilled warrior and huntress due to her intensive training. She attends the Proving, winning the competition and being declared a Nora. Before she can ask about her parents, the tribe is attacked by a group of cultists led by the fanatical Helis, who seeks to kill Aloy. Most of her fellow warriors are murdered, but Helis hesitates when stabbing Aloy and is attacked by Rost, who then sacrifices himself to protect her from a blast. When she comes to inside All-Mother Mountain, one of the tribe's elders explains that Aloy was actually found in front of another bunker inside the mountain, and their disagreement over whether she was a good or evil omen led to her exile. However, her Focus reveals that Helis was given orders along with a picture of an older woman who looks just like her. Aloy is declared a Seeker and sets out to avenge the attack on the tribe. Eventually, she is contacted by a man named Sylens, who reveals that the older woman is Dr. Elisabet Sobeck. Her genetic profile allows her to access the headquarters of Faro Automated Solutions, where she sees that Elisabet was a skilled scientist who was called in to try to stop a swarm of self-replicating combat robots that went rogue due to the recklessness of the company's CEO, Ted Faro. She then sets out to discover what Project Zero Dawn, which Elisabet created, planned to do. Eventually, Aloy discovers that Zero Dawn was a project that involved allowing humanity to go extinct and reviving them using artificial wombs after the threat of the robots was dealt with and the Earth was \"re-seeded\". However, a mysterious signal attacked Zero Dawn's AI, GAIA, forcing her to self-destruct and unshackling her component processes. With nothing to protect humanity from the rogue AI of HADES, initially created as an emergency \"reset switch\" for the planet, GAIA was forced to order ELEUTHIA, a subsystem tasked with maintaining the artificial wombs, to clone Elisabet using DNA stored for the defunct \"Lightkeeper Protocol\", predicting that her genes would cause her to become the world's savior once again. Aloy was brought outside the facility by a robot, leading the elders to believe she had mysteriously appeared there. While exploring the Zero Dawn facility, Aloy also learns that Dr. Sobeck sacrificed herself to close a malfunctioning vent and save the project from the encroaching all-consuming robots. Upon realizing this, Aloy sets out to find the Master Override that can shut down HADES. With the help of Sylens, she obtains the Override and confronts HADES, shutting it down in the nick of time. In an ending scene, she is seen finding the body of Dr. Sobeck and getting closure in the search for her origins. == Development == Aloy was created as a character who could provide many tactical options in battle. As a \"hunter at heart\", she has little compassion for machines beyond a \"hunter's respect\". She also has a gritty personality, disliking \"comforts or ease\", and tends to be \"very forthright and blunt, sometimes even confrontational\" in how she addresses issues. Guerrilla Games always envisioned the game as starring a strong female character, with game director Mathijs de Jonge citing Sarah Connor from Terminator, Ellen Ripley from Alien, and Ygritte from Game of Thrones as influences. Sony decided to do rigorous market testing, believing that adding a female lead might be a \"risk\", but approved her as the lead role. The developers were aware of the strong female character cliche and tried to make a more human character with a more interesting personality. Aloy's physical likeness was based on the Dutch actress Hannah Hoekstra. == Reception == Peter Tieryas of Kotaku praised the character of Aloy, finding the scene where Aloy talks to her father's grave moving in part due to how \"real\" their relationship felt and how it shows how things have changed for Aloy since her childhood. Malindy Hetfield of Polygon praised Aloy as \"inspiring and captivating\", but also called her \"not particularly relatable\" compared to the game's other female characters due to her \"flawlessness\". Aloy's story about her origins resonated with Sam Loveridge of GamesRadar+ and inspired him to seek out his own birth parents. Lucas Sullivan of the same site called her \"one of gaming's greatest female leads\". She was ranked as one of the best video game characters of the 2010s by Polygon staff by Colin Campbell praising the character by stating that \"She\u2019s pragmatic but compassionate, iron-willed but open-minded. In a 31st-century world with its own norms and taboos, particularly around gender, Aloy refuses to let anyone else tell her how to live.\" Ashly Burch, the voice actress for Aloy, won an award for \"best gaming performance\" at the 35th Golden Joystick Awards. She thanked the developers, saying that playing the character made her a \"braver and stronger woman\", and that she hoped Aloy would be inspiring to other women. Aloy has also appeared in other media outside of Horizon Zero Dawn, such as a playable character in the PlayStation 4 version of Monster Hunter: World. == References == Category:Female characters in video games Category:Video game characters introduced in 2017 Category:Fictional hunters in video games Category:Clone characters in video games Category:Orphan characters in video games Category:Video game protagonists Category:Fictional archers Category:Adoptee characters in video games Category:Fictional women soldiers and warriors ",
