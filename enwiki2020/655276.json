The National Map , accessed August 8, 2011 tributary of Swatara Creek in south-central Pennsylvania in the United States. The original Lenape name for this waterway is Kuwekt\u0259peh\u0259le, which means 'it flows out (kt\u0259peh\u0259le) from the pines (kuwe)'. Quittapahilla Creek rises in eastern Lebanon County, flows west- southwest through Lebanon and Annville, and joins Swatara Creek northeast of Palmyra. By the late 20th century the creek had become polluted from steel mill waste. The decline of industry in the region, as well as federal, state, and local efforts, have led to an improvement in water quality. The stream is stocked annually with trout and it has become a popular destination for recreational fly fishing. ==Tributaries== *Killinger Creek *Bachman Run *Beck Creek *Snitz Creek *Brandywine Creek ==See also== *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== ==External links== *Quittapahilla Watershed Organization *Quittapahilla Watershed Grant *Fly fishing on the Quittie *Lebanon Valley College - Dedication announcement of the Cuewe-Pehelle statue on the LVC campus.
