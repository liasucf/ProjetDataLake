    "text": "The Barnett (originally known as the Barnett National Bank Building) is a skyscraper in the downtown area of Jacksonville, Florida, at the southwest corner of Adams and Laura streets. ==History== The building was erected in 1926 and was Jacksonville's tallest building at the time, surpassing the Heard National Bank Building. It was designed by architecture firm Mowbray & Uffinger for Barnett Bank. It remained Jacksonville's tallest building until the construction of the building now known as the Aetna Building in 1954. By the late 1990s it had fallen to disrepair; plans to restore and redevelop the building were proposed throughout the 2000s, but ultimately fell through.Bull, Roger. \"Open door allows look at lobby of Barnett Bank building\".
