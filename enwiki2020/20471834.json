    "text": "First Lady of Brazil (Portuguese: Primeira-dama do Brasil) is a title that receives the hostess of Alvorada Palace. The position is traditionally filled by the wife of the current president of Brazil, but on a special occasion, the title may apply to women who are not the president's wives when the president is single or widowed. They do not have official functions within the government, but usually attend public ceremonies and organize social actions such as charity events. In addition, a charismatic first lady can help convey a positive image of her spouses to the population. The role of the first lady has changed considerably. It included involvement in political campaigns, social causes, and representation of the president on official and ceremonial occasions. In addition, over the years, first ladies have exerted influence in various sectors, from fashion to public opinion on politics. There were thirty-seven first ladies and thirty-three wives of presidents. This difference exists because presidents Get\u00falio Vargas and Ranieri Mazzilli served two non-consecutive terms being counted chronologically twice each. Another difference comes from President Hermes da Fonseca who, becoming a widower in office, contracted nuptials again. And presidents Rodrigues Alves and Castelo Branco being both widowers, their daughters played such a role. Dilma Rousseff, the first and only female president to date, has been divorced twice, which did not bring with her presidency the figure of the first gentleman. Following the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro on 1 January 2019, his wife Michelle Bolsonaro became the thirty-seventh Brazilian first lady, succeeding Marcela Temer, wife of former president Michel Temer. == Wives who did not become first ladies == * Alice Prestes, Julio Prestes's wife, did not officially become First Lady, as her husband was prevented from taking office, but he must be a former president under the Law. * Mariquita Aleixo, Pedro Aleixo's wife, did not officially become First Lady, as her husband was prevented from taking office, but he must be a former president under the Law. * Risoleta Neves, wife of Tancredo Neves, did not officially become First Lady, as her husband died before taking office, but he must be a former president under the law. == Social works == Ruth Cardoso in event of the Solidarity Community Program. The first ladies occupy a highly visible position in Brazilian society, playing an evolutionary role over the centuries. Assistance in the country under the command of the Brazilian first lady began in the 1940s, ahead of Darcy Vargas, with the creation of the Brazilian Legion of Assistance. Founded on 28 August 1942 to assist the families of soldiers who participated in World War II, but soon became comprehensive, with emphasis on mothers and families living in poverty. With an entirely feminine style, the LBA was governed in each state by the wives of the governors and, consequently, by the wives of the mayors. From then on, all the first ladies of the country assumed the presidency of honor of the Brazilian Legion of Assistance. But it was under Rosane Collor's management that the LBA plunged into scandals over embezzlement for the first lady's family, which resulted in her leaving the organ in 1991. The Brazilian Legion of Assistance was extinguished on 1 January 1995, under the government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Sarah Kubitschek innovated with the Foundation of Social Pioneers. The organization was created when it was still first lady of Minas Gerais, offering support to children, mothers and pregnant women, extending to the poorest families. The Foundation gained independence when her husband assumed the Presidency of the Republic, acquiring larger resources, originating from the Federal Government and some sectors such as: commerce, industry and individuals. Marcela Temer in Global Child Forum. Ruth Cardoso assumed the presidency of the Solidarity Community Program, created in 1995 by the government to combat extreme poverty. The program replaced the extinct bodies of the Brazilian Legion of Assistance and the National Food Security Council. In 2000, she created the non-governmental organization Comunitas, in which she acted until her death, having been the forerunner of one of the largest social programs in the country's history, Bolsa Fam\u00edlia. Ruth was still noted for her intellectuality, having been the first wife of a president to earn a university degree. Shortly after becoming first lady of Brazil, it was announced that Marcela would be the ambassador for the \"Happy Child\" program, and was officially launched on 5 October 2016 with the Happy Child Program, with Marcela Temer as ambassador. Created by the Federal Government for the care of children from 0 to 3 years of age, with the purpose of accompanying visits to families linked to the Bolsa Familia Program, encouraging early childhood development in education, social assistance, health, human rights and culture. Michelle Bolsonaro is committed to advocating for visibility of rare diseases, digital inclusion, awareness of autism, inclusion of LIBRAS (Brazilian Sign Language) in schools and other social projects. == First ladies' style == Among the first thirty-seven ladies, some draw attention for style and elegance. Sarah Kubitschek is considered to this day from eligibility, for fashion dictated at a time when the country is on the rise in the fashion market. Classic in style, elegant and discreet, pieces by various designers, including Zuzu Angel, Dener Pamplona, Guilherme Guimar\u00e3es and Mena Fiala, responsible for almost all of Sarah's wardrobe and the dress in which she owns the division of ownership husband. Considered by People Magazine the most beautiful first lady in the country and one of the 10 most beautiful in the world, Maria Thereza Goulart became an icon of Brazilian fashion in the early 60s, opting for the then nascent Brazilian haute couture, becoming a client. from designer Dener Pamplona de Abreu, who was ultimately responsible for his wardrobe. Glamorous, it attracted the interest of the newspapers and the imagination of Brazilians who were inspired by their most beautiful pieces of clothing. Maria Thereza was the youngest first lady in the country's history, at the age of twenty-one at the time of her inauguration, having been considered by Time magazine as one of the nine Reigning Beauties in the world. It was an icon of Brazilian fashion in the early 60s, with the rise of haute couture in the country, attracting national and international attention, printing several covers of Brazilian magazines such as Manchete, Fatos & Fotos and O Cruzeiro; and world famous such as the French Paris Match and the German Stern. Becoming first lady, Marcela Temer also attracted national attention and became a fashion reference. At the parade on 7 September 2016, she appeared in a simple white dress with a discreet neckline. In less than 24 hours, the dress was already sold out at the online store of Brazilian designer Luisa Farani. With a classic and romantic style, the same dress she wore in her first official act as first lady, repeated in her last official act as first lady, being highly praised and associated with the British Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Michelle Bolsonaro has her style considered classic and elegant. The first lady received most of the attention held by her husband as President of the Republic, using a model considered simple, but that lasted 20 days to be made. The medium-length, shoulder-to-shoulder ros\u00e9 model - inspired by former United States First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and Monaco Princess Grace Kelly - has generated a number of positive comments. In everyday life your look is always casual, basically wearing jeans, knit shirts, showing more your personality. She likes classic, discreet, neckless pieces with a black color as a favorite, a fact that made her choose a dress in the same color with round sleeves for the cocktail party at Itamaraty on the night of inauguration. Her stylist is Paulistana Marie Lafayette, who dresses the first lady at all official events. At an event held by the Planalto Palace in April 2019, Michelle came up with a white tube and pearl necklace, drawing comparisons to Diana, Princess of Wales. == List of first ladies of Brazil == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:Center;\" |- !
