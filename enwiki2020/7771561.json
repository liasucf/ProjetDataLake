(2015). History of the Incas. Lexington, Conflicting factions and the fact that the Spanish chroniclers' accounts stemmed from the winners of the ensuing civil war led to conflicting versions of what actually happened. Thus, although Huayna Capac named the infant Ninan Cuyochi as his first heir, sources differ as to whether the boy died first, was unacceptable because of an unfavorable divination, or even if Huayna simply forgot that he had named him when asked to confirm the nomination. In any event a second choice was requested and again sources vary. He may have named Hu\u00e1scar's half- brother Atahualpa who then refused, or named Hu\u00e1scar himself, or perhaps even the nobles put forward Hu\u00e1scar. Whatever the truth, the result of Hu\u00e1scar's accession and the dispute over it before and after led to civil war between Hu\u00e1scar (made Emperor by a faction based in Cuzco) and Atahualpa (backed by leaders who were based in the north with Huayna). ==References== Category:1490s births Category:1527 deaths Category:Inca Empire people Category:Deaths from smallpox Category:Infectious disease deaths in Peru Category:16th-century monarchs in South America ",
