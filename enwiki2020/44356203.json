Most commonly seen lilac species in China. *Height: Shrub or small tree to 3.5m or 5m. *Stems: May be glabrous, pubescent, or puberulent (with fine, minute hairs). Shoots are glabrous. *Leaves: Ovate- orbicular to reniform, often slightly wider than long, measuring 2.5-10 (occasionally up to 14) cm x 2.5-8 (occasionally 15) cm. Leaves range from glabrous to pubescent, villous, or glabrescent (losing hairs with age). Base is truncate to subcordate or broadly cuneate, with an abruptly acute to long acuminate apex. Leaves colour well in fall, often turning to shades of red in autumn. *Flowers: Panicles are lateral, congested, lax, or erect, and measure 4 - 16 (occasionally as much as 20) cm x 3 - 8 (occasionally 10) cm. Pedicel to 3 mm in length, and may be either pubescent or glabrous. Corolla is about 1.3 cm long and 1.7 cm across, and ranges from purple to lilac, and occasionally white; tube is subcylindric, and measures 0.6 - 1.7 (occasionally up to 2.2) cm in length.

Anthers are yellow, inserted in corolla tube to 4 mm from the mouth. Flowers appear earlier than any other species of Syringa, from April to May and June. *Fruit: Smooth obovate-elliptic to ovate or oblong-lanceolate capsule measures 0.7 - 1.5 (rarely 2) cm. == Habitat == Gravelly mountains, roadsides, stream banks, thickets, valleys, and woods. 100-2600m altitude. == Distribution == China: Gansu, Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Nei Mongol, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, and northwest Sichuan provinces.
