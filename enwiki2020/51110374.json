    "text": "Mathilde Danegger (real name, Mathilde Deutsch: 2 August 1903 \u2013 27 July 1988) was an Austrian stage and movie actress. Sources may also identify her by the pseudonym, Mathilde Leusch; Leusch is apparently a variant of her second husband's surname (Lesch). ==Life== Mathilde Danegger was born and attended school in Vienna. Her father was an Austrian character actor and stage producer (real name, Joseph Deutsch: 1865\u20131933) who later took over as director of the City Theatre in Z\u00fcrich. Her mother, Bertha Danegger (real name Bertha Deutsch; known professionally by her maiden name Bertha M\u00fcller, she was an Austrian actress of stage and silent film. Like her elder brothers, (1889-1948) and Theodor Danegger (1891-1959), she decided on a stage career early in life. She started her performing with children's roles, making her debut in 1912 at Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater in Berlin, with a further youthful appearance there in 1914. She would continue to return to the Berlin stage throughout her career, but by 1919 she was, with her parents, based in Z\u00fcrich. In 1919/1920 she had engagements at the City Theatre in Vienna. From 1921-24, she was working, primarily, at the Popular Theatre in Vienna, and, between 1924-28, at the Theater in der Josefstadt. Danegger's first marriage was to Herbert Waniek (1897\u20131949) whose theatre career during the 1920s was focused on the same Vienna theatres as those of his wife. Waniek had connections with the \"German Theatre\" at Brno (in the former Czechoslovakia), where, until 1933, Mathilde Danegger was making regular guest appearances. There were also frequent guest appearances at theatres in Berlin and Vienna. Around this time she married her second husband, Swiss drama producer Walter Lesch (1898\u20131958). With the German change in government at the start of 1933, Mathilde, a staunch antifascist, fled to Switzerland where she worked at the National Theatre in Z\u00fcrich with Wolfgang Langhoff, like her a political exile from Nazi Germany. She took part in political cabaret, between 1934-38 appearing in the \"Cornichon\" cabaret established by her husband. In 1939, she met with Herbert Cr\u00fcger, who subsequently became her third husband. She was a co-founder in Switzerland of the National Committee for a Free Germany. Two years after the war ended, in 1947, Mathilde Danegger returned to Germany. Sources differ as to whether she settled in the American occupation zone or in East Berlin, which was in the central part of what had been Germany, and was now administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone. In reality, it was several years before the political division of occupied Germany would be matched by physical barriers. Between 1947-51, she was working at the Hessische National Theatre in Wiesbaden. In East Berlin, supported by the dramatist's wife and business manager, Helene Weigel, Danegger was recruited by Bertolt Brecht to work at the Berliner Ensemble where she was employed between 1951-53. During these years she was active in the peace movement. In December 1948 she joined the German Communist Party. Between 1948-51 she also wrote, as Cultural Editor, for Unsere Stimme, a regional communist news magazine based at Villingen-Schwenningen near the border with Switzerland. In 1953, four years after the foundation of two separate German states, and with the border between them becoming less permeable, she formally relocated with her husband to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). There followed a long period as a star of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. Among others, she took part in productions by Wolfgang Langhoff, Wolfgang Heinz, Benno Besson and . In parallel with her theatre work, from 1960 she built up an extensive repertoire of cinema and television roles in productions by the state-owned film studio, DEFA, and Deutscher Fernsehfunk, the state television broadcaster. She had already undertaken a significant amount of acting work in front of the camera during her time in Switzerland. Of particular note was her portrayal of Frau Holle in the 1963 film of the eponymous fairy tale by Gottfried Kolditz and her television role in \"Mutter Jantschowa\" (1968). She remained politically engaged throughout. In 1957 she wrote a letter to the party defending dissident Wolfgang Harich following his arrest. ==Marriages== By her second husband she was the mother of the actress Karin Lesch. Her third husband, the university lecturer and author Herbert Cr\u00fcger, became caught up in the political persecution that was a feature of East Germany in the 1950s. In 1956, he was overheard criticising the arrest of Bernhard Steinberger in the aftermath of the remarkable party conference of the Soviet Communist Party. In March 1958 Cr\u00fcger was himself arrested by the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). At a secret trial in December 1958 he was found guilty of \"high treason\" (\"schweren Staatsverrats\") and sentenced to an eight-year jail term. In the end he was released in 1961 and rehabilitated by the High Court in May 1990. == Filmography (selection) == Cinema films * 1921: Wege des Schreckens \u2013 producer: Mih\u00e1ly Kert\u00e9sz * 1933: ' \u2013 producer: Walter Lesch und Richard Schweizer * 1935: ' \u2013 producer: Walter Lesch und Leopold Lindtberg * 1940: ' \u2013 producer: Leopold Lindtberg * 1942: Der Schuss von der Kanzel * 1944: Marie-Louise \u2013 producer: Leopold Lindtberg * 1947: Madness Rules \u2013 producer: Leopold Lindtberg * 1956: Lissy \u2013 producer: Konrad Wolf * 1959: Ehesache Lorenz \u2013 producer: Joachim Kunert * 1960: ' \u2013 producer: Konrad Wolf * 1962: Das verhexte Fischerdorf * 1962: A Lively Christmas Eve \u2013 producer: G\u00fcnter Reisch * 1963: Die Glatzkopfbande \u2013 producer: Richard Groschopp * 1963: Frau Holle \u2013 producer: Gottfried Kolditz * 1964: Geliebte wei\u00dfe Maus \u2013 producer: Gottfried Kolditz * 1964: Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder - producer: Joachim Herz * 1965: Solange Leben in mir ist * 1965: '''' * 1968: Abschied * 1969: Zeit zu leben \u2013 producer: Horst Seemann * 1969: Seine Hoheit \u2013 Genosse Prinz \u2013 producer: Werner W.
