    "text": "Broad Creek in Prince George's County was the first footprint of European settlement in the immediate counties around what would become the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. The area is part of greater Fort Washington. The area was settled by Europeans in the 1660s and the town was created in 1706 when the colonial Maryland Legislature authorized surveying and laying out the towns of Queen Anne Town, Nottingham, Mill Town, Piscataway, Aire (also known as Broad Creek) and Upper Marlboro (then known as Marlborough Town). In 1747, the legislature tried to improve the quality and the method of marketing tobacco, then the major crop of the area, and established a formal system of tobacco inspection and quality control. The town was home to one of seven state tobacco warehouses built in Prince George's County. The site is located south of the U.S. Capitol building on the Potomac River. Today, this \"first footprint\" of settlement in the capital area is a Prince George's County Historic District, with three 17th century homesites and an 18th-century Episcopal Church structure. The Broad Creek Historic District comprises along the Potomac River, and is remarkable for its environmental resources, as well as its 12,000-year-old Indian archeological discoveries. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 8, 2011. ==References== ==External links== *, including undated photo, at Maryland Historical Trust website * Category:Geography of Prince George's County, Maryland Category:Unincorporated communities in Maryland Category:1706 establishments in Maryland Category:Historic districts in Prince George's County, Maryland Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland Category:Populated places established in 1706 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Prince George's County, Maryland ",
