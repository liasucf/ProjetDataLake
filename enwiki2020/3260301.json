Ferr\u00e9 at a location in the Ponce Historic Zone. The museum moved to its current building location on Avenida Las Am\u00e9ricas in 1965. In 2010, the museum increased its size significantly after a $30M expansion. ==History== Main hall of the museum The project of the museum began in 1956 when Luis A. Ferr\u00e9 traveled to Europe and acquired various European art pieces, including many Pre-Raphaelite works, which encouraged him to start a project for a museum in the city of Ponce, his birthplace. With the advice of two experts \u2013 Julius S. Held, specialist on Rubens and professor of Art History at Barnard College and Columbia University, and Ren\u00e9 Taylor, art and architecture enthusiast and professor at the University of Granada, Yale, and Columbia \u2013 Ferr\u00e9 compiled a collection of works of art based on their value instead of their popularity.Celia Quartermain. King Arthur Comes Home: How a key Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood painting by Edward Burne-Jones Ended up on a Caribbean Island. NewStatesman. 14 April 2008. Retrieved 27 November 2009. Ferr\u00e9 would state in a Forbes interview that \"the scholars and critics all called it kitsch, everyone thought I was crazy to buy them.\" On 3 January 1959, Ferr\u00e9 opened the museum at a house at 70 Cristina Street in Ponce at what is today the Centro Cultural de Ponce, with an exhibit of 72 works of art. Some of these original paintings continue to be on display today. As time passed and the museum gained popularity, additional works of art were added to the collections. In 1962, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation donated 15 paintings to the museum. By 1989, the museum's collection had grown to 500 pieces, with a then estimated value of $50 million, equivalent to $ in present-day terms. Fearing a fire in the Cristina Street building would destroy its collections, Ferr\u00e9 acquired a tract of land on Las Americas Avenue in Ponce to build the current museum, and recruited architect Edward Durell Stone for its design. On 23 April 1964 the first stone was placed and the construction of the museum began. It was finished in 1965 and officially opened on 28 December 1965. One of the main features of the museum is its hexagonal galleries, which allow natural light to enter through its corners bringing an illumination to exhibitions. The museum contained a total of 14 galleries, two gardens, and an amphitheater, and its main entrance with bifurcated ladders. Pinceladas en Vuelo (\"Brushstokes in Flight\"), a 28-foot-high aluminum structure created in 1984 by New York sculptor Roy Lichtenstein sits on the front yard of the museum, which was then considered \"the largest public [display art] work in Latin America and the Caribbean.\" The museum was closed from 2008 to 2010 while undergoing renovations, re-opening in time for the celebration of its 50th anniversary on 13 November 2010, after a $30 million in improvements.In Transit; Art Museum Reopens After Major Expansion.
