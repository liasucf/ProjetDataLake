He traveled the world with his family, who eventually settled down in New Zealand, where his passion for photography took flight. Inspired by the likes of Steichen and Horst, Mariano moved to London in the year 2000 to pursue his career as a fashion photographer. Mariano has since become one of the World's leading editorial photographers, regularly shooting for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Muse Magazine, Dazed & Confused, Vogue Hommes Nippon, Num\u00e9ro, Num\u00e9ro Homme, i-D, DSection Magazine, Hercules, and GQ. Often in black and white, his portraits, nudes, and editorial work (in both men's and womenswear) apply the principles of pure photography; using simply light and shade, Vivanco renders visible the natural spirit of the sitter. These subjects have included actors, athletes, singers and stars Cindy Crawford, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Naomi Campbell, Eva Herzigova, Emma Watson, Ricky Martin, Lionel Messi, Eva Mendes, Miranda Kerr, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Dita von Teese, Donatella Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Sir Paul Smith, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lana Del Rey, Daniel Radcliffe, and Sam Smith (singer), among others.
