At the 1996 Summer Olympics he ran in 1:42.85 and thereby improved the national record of Alberto Juantorena. However, this wasn't enough to secure a medal as he finished in fourth place. A silver medal from the 1997 World Championships was his best result thereafter. ==Major achievements== {| |- ! colspan=\"6\" | Representing |- | rowspan=\"5\" | 1990 | rowspan=\"3\" | Central
