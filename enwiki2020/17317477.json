    "text": "Louis Michael \"Mike\" Caldwell (May 18, 1926 \u2013 August 17, 1995)California Death Index: Louis Michael Caldwell was an accomplished comedy magician. Much of Caldwell's comedy stemmed from his large size. At more than 400 pounds, Caldwell became famous for being able to do a complete backflip from a standing position, and he featured this stunt in a series of television commercials for many advertisers throughout the 1960s and 1970s. ==Information== Caldwell was a contemporary of Harry Blackstone Jr., Jay Marshall, Karrell Fox, Howard Flint, Lance Burton, David Copperfield, Doug Henning, and David Mark. Caldwell was a staple at the famous Abbott's Magic Get-Togethers, usually in the company of Blackstone, Flint, Fox, and Mark. He was known for a comedy routine in which he borrowed a young boy's handkerchief, cut a large hole in it and, after some comic by-play and several failed attempts, restored the handkerchief. One afternoon at home with visiting magician and friend David Mark, during the course of a conversation about effects associated with specific performers, Caldwell realized for the first time he had done the flip for well over 50 years with a long pair of sharp scissors for the handkerchief routine in his inside pocket! After realizing he could have speared himself many times over the years, Caldwell never again performed the flip. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:1995 deaths Category:American male comedians Category:American comedians Category:American magicians ",
