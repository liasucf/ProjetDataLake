Fincke was then transferred to administrative duties. In 1582 he was named as the stadtholder of the Olavinlinna Castle in Savonia. In 1596\u20131597 Fincke took part in suppressing the revolting Finnish peasants in the Cudgel War. In the 1598\u20131599 War against Sigismund, Olavinlinna became the last stronghold of Sigismund's supporters as his brother Sten Fincke fled to the castle. Olavinlinna soon surrendered to the troops of Charles IX without any resistance, Sten was executed in the \u00c5bo bloodbath and G\u00f6dik expelled of his post. Fincke spent his last years in Ulvila, Satakunta, where he died in 1617. Fincke and his spouse Elisabeth Boije are buried to the St. Olaf's Church in Ulvila. == References == Category:1546 births Category:1617 deaths Category:People from Kanta-H\u00e4me Category:Swedish-speaking Finns Category:Finnish nobility Category:Swedish nobility Category:16th-century Swedish people Category:16th-century Finnish people Category:Swedish military personnel Category:People of the Livonian War Category:People of the War against Sigismund ",
