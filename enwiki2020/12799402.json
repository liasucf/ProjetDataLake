    "text": "Ryan McCord (born 21 March 1989) is a Scottish footballer who plays as a midfielder for Brechin. He began his career with Dundee United, making only two first team appearances, and played for Stirling Albion and Airdrie United on loan before joining Alloa Athletic in 2011, and then Raith Rovers in 2015. He joined Arbroath in 2016 where he remained until the summer of 2019. He is a former Scotland under-19 international. ==Club career== McCord was born in Dundee and joined Dundee United as an under-16 player. He first signed a professional contract with his hometown club in April 2006, having previously played with United team-mate David Goodwillie in the Scottish Youth FA team when he was younger, and was part of the United under-16 team that won the Aberdeen International Football Festival in 2005. After featuring in United's under-17 squad, McCord and nine other players were given professional contracts in April 2006, and he turned out regularly for United's youth, under-19 and reserve teams over the next two years. By the end of the 2007\u201308 season, McCord had appeared in the first team squad as an unused substitute on three occasions, and in May was given a one-year contract extension. McCord got his first taste of first team action in July 2008 when he featured as a substitute in two pre-season friendlies, including the glamour friendly match against Barcelona at Tannadice. He made his senior debut in a Scottish League Cup match against Airdrie United in September 2008, appearing as a substitute. In the January transfer window of 2009, McCord was loaned to Scottish Second Division side Stirling Albion for a month, scoring in his second match for the club. After featuring throughout January, McCord's loan was extended until early March. After returning to United, McCord agreed a contract extension until May 2012, making his second appearance in another League Cup match. On 13 June 2011 he, and his younger brother Ross, signed a one-year contract with Alloa Athletic. On 3 June 2015 McCord signed a 1-year contract with Raith Rovers. After just one season with the Rovers, McCord moved to Scottish League Two side Arbroath. McCord helped Arbroath win promotion to Scottish League One in 2017. In May 2018 the club stated that McCord would leave, but later in the close season he reversed this decision. McCord signed for Brechin City on 9 June 2019. ==International career== McCord made his Scotland under-19 debut in October 2007, playing in a 1\u20130 defeat against Ukraine, appearing alongside United team-mate Gordon Pope. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Scottish Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Dundee United |2008\u201309 |rowspan=\"3\"|Scottish Premier League |0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2009\u201310 |0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2010\u201311 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0 |- |Stirling Albion (loan) |2008\u201309 |rowspan=\"2\"|Scottish Second Division |7||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||1 |- |Airdrie United (loan) |2010\u201311 |32||6||3||1||2||1||0||0||37||8 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Alloa Athletic |2011\u201312 |Scottish Third Division |32||11||2||0||1||0||1Appearances in the Scottish Challenge Cup||0||36||11 |- |2012\u201313 |Scottish Second Division |31||11||1||0||1||0||5One appearance in the Scottish Challenge Cup; four appearances and a goal in the First Division play-offs||1||38||12 |- |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"2\"|Scottish Championship |35||6||3||1||2||1||1||0||41||8 |- |2014\u201315 |35||0||3||0||2||0||9Five appearance and two goals in the Scottish Challenge Cup; four appearances in the Championship play-offs||2||49||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !133!!28!!9!!1!!6!!1!!16!!3!!164!!33 |- |Raith Rovers |2015\u201316 |Scottish Championship |19||1||2||1||3||0||2||0||26||2 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Arbroath |2016\u201317 |Scottish League Two |31||13||2||0||3||0||2||0||38||13 |- |2017\u201318 |Scottish League One |19||9||2||1||3||0||2One appearance in the Scottish Challenge Cup; one appearance in the Championship play-offs||0||26||10 |- |2018\u201319 |Scottish League One |18||3||1||0||1||0||3 |Scottish League Two |19||3||2||0||3||0||1||0||25||3 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !278!!64!!21!!4!!23!!2!!26!!3!!348!!73 |} ==Honours== ;Alloa Athletic *Scottish Third Division: 2011\u201312 *Scottish First Division play-offs : 2012\u201313 *Scottish Championship play-offs 2014\u201315 ;Arbroath * Scottish League Two : 2016\u201317 * Scottish League One : 2018-19 ==References== ==External links== * * *Ryan McCord at Soccerway Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Dundee Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland youth international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Dundee United F.C. players Category:Stirling Albion F.C. players Category:Alloa Athletic F.C. players Category:Airdrieonians F.C. players Category:Raith Rovers F.C. players Category:Arbroath F.C. players Category:Brechin City F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players ",
