    "text": "Del Fango Redoubt (), also known as De Vami Redoubt (), was a redoubt in Marsaxlokk, Malta. It was built in 1715\u20131716 by the Order of Saint John as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. An entrenchment was originally located close to the redoubt. Del Fango Redoubt was part of a chain of fortifications that defended Marsaxlokk Bay, which also included three other redoubts, the large Saint Lucian Tower, two smaller De Redin towers, seven batteries and three entrenchments. The nearest fortifications to Del Fango Redoubt were Vend\u00f4me Tower to the southwest and Wil\u0121a Battery to the southeast. Del Fango Redoubt's layout was typical of most other coastal redoubts built in Malta. It consisted of a pentagonal platform with a rectangular blockhouse sealing off the gorge. Today, both the redoubt and the nearby entrenchment have been demolished, and no remains can be seen. ==References== Category:Redoubts in Malta Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Malta Category:Marsaxlokk Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:18th-century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta ",
