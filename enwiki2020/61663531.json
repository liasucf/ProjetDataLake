    "text": "Sarah Anne Robertson is a fellow of both the Australian Academy of Science and Australian Academy for Health and Medical Sciences, and Professor of Reproductive Immunology at University of Adelaide, Australia, and Director of the Robinson Research Institute. She was an NHMRC fellow for more than 15 years. == Career and research interests == Robertson was ranked as one of South Australia's most influential women. Robertson\u2019s career involves research on reproductive health, pregnancy, and immunology, with three main themes. * Signalling of male seminal fluid within the female reproductive tract. * Cytokine and leukocyte control, within conception and pregnancy * Maternal immune regulation, with respect to the implantation of embryos, placental development and outcomes of reproduction. Robertson's work has described a process whereby if male sperm is not of sufficient quality, the female will not invest her reproductive processes in that particular sperm. This may reflect the evolutionary biology of pregnancy, and processes where the female body decides if the body is ready for pregnancy. Her work has included reproductive health and preparing for successful pregnancies by 3\u20136 months by not using birth control to prepare for healthier babies. == Early career == Robertson's career is notable for starting her early life a young parent, and then continuing on to win multiple prizes, and then become a fellow of two of Australia academies. Robertson was also the first RD Wright Fellow to have not had overseas lab experience. Her overseas experience was obtained via visiting fellowships, and making overseas contacts and collaborations through conferences and workshops. == Selected publications == As at August 2019, Robertson had an H Index of 66 and over 13,000 citations.
