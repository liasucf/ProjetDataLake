    "text": "The Sea or the Water is an area of the sky in which many water-related, and few land-related, constellations occur. This may be because the Sun passed through this part of the sky during the rainy season. Most of these constellations are named by Ptolemy: * Aquarius the Water-bearer * Capricornus the Sea-goat * Cetus the Whale * Delphinus the Dolphin * Eridanus the Great River * Hydra the Water serpent * Pisces the Fishes * Piscis Austrinus, the Southern Fish (not named by Ptolemy) Sometimes included are the ship Argo and Crater the Water Cup. Some water-themed constellations are newer, so are not in this region. They include Hydrus, the lesser water snake; Volans, the flying fish; and Dorado, the swordfish. ==See also== *Celestial ocean, a mythological concept, not specific to astronomy *Lunar sea ==References== + ",
