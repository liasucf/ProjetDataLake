Abbensetts was further inspired when he went to England and visited the Royal Court Theatre, Britain's premier theatre of new writing, where he was soon to become resident dramatist. Sweet Talk, Abbensetts' first play, was performed there in 1973, with a cast including Mona Hammond and Don Warrington, directed by Stephen Frears.Stephen Bourne, \"The Black Presence on the London Stage, 1825\u20131965: Some Key Players and a Timeline\". In the same year, The Museum Attendant, his first television play, was broadcast on BBC2. Directed by Stephen Frears, the drama was, Abbensetts said, based on his own early experiences as a security guard at the Tower of London. Black Christmas, also directed by Frears,\"Michael Abbensetts\", Royal Literary Fund. was broadcast by BBC Television in 1977 and featured Carmen Munroe and Norman Beaton. It has been called by Stephen Bourne \"one of the best television dramas of the 1970s\".Stephen Bourne, Black in the British Frame: The Black Experience in British Film and Television, Continuum, 2005, p. 200. During the 1970s and 1980s, a number of Abbensetts' plays were produced for the London theatre, including in the West End. Alterations appeared in 1978, followed by Samba (1980), In The Mood (1981), Outlaw (1983), Eldorado (1983) and The Lion (1993).\"Michael Abbensetts\", National Theatre, Black Plays Archive. Inner City Blues, Crime and Passion, Roadrunner and Fallen Angel were produced on television. Abbensetts' success led to his participation in what came to be considered British television's first Black soap opera, Empire Road (BBC, 1978\u201379), for which he wrote two series. He has said: \"I never really liked it being called a Soap. It was The Daily Mail that called it that. I always thought of it as a drama series, where each episode had a separate story.\" The second series was directed by Horace Ov\u00e9, \"establishing a production unit with a Black director, Black writer and Black actors.\" The cast featured Norman Beaton, Corinne Skinner-Carter, Joseph Marcell, Rudolph Walker and Wayne Laryea. Abbensetts' television work continued with Easy Money (1981) and Big George Is Dead (Channel 4, 1987) starring Norman Beaton, Linzi Drew and Ram John Holder,\"Big George Is Dead\" at IMDb. and the mini-series Little Napoleons (1994, Channel 4).\"Little Napoleons\" at IMDb.
