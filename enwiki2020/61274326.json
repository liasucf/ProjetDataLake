    "text": "\"So Pure\" is a song by British musical group Baby D. It was released in 1996 and is taken from their only album, Deliverance. The song peaked at number 3 in the United Kingdom, number 10 in Finland, number 16 in Scotland and number 18 in Ireland. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"So Pure\" reached number 10 in January 1996. A partially black-and-white music video was made to accompany the song. ==Critical reception== Music & Media described \"So Pure\" as \"a more uptempo track, whose complicated intro might be edited by EHR programmers, but which should otherwise have no trouble following the success of the other singles.\" Ian Harrison from Select called it \"a respectable neighbour of Gloria Gaynor's 'I Will Survive'.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
