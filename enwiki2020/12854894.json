A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of Amitostigma, Neottianthe and Ponerorchis were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. Amitostigma and Neottianthe were subsumed into Ponerorchis, with this species becoming Ponerorchis capitata. == References == Category:Endemic orchids of China capitata Category:Endangered plants Category:Flora of Sichuan Category:Flora of Hubei Category:Plants described in 1936 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
