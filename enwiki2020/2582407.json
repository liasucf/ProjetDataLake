It is served by Welshpool railway station. Welshpool is visually known for its 3 complexes of silo towers. These house storage of feed products for the poultry and agricultural industries. Welshpool is a traditional industrial suburb partly to the fact of its proximity to Perth Airport and short distance to the Perth CBD. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia Category:Economy of Perth, Western Australia * * ",
