As of 2019, the rector of the university is Prof. Dr. Cevdet Erd\u00f6l. ==History== The University of Health Sciences (SB\u00dc) was established as a state university on 27 March 2015. The Haydarpa\u015fa Campus of the Marmara University at Haydarpa\u015fa neighborhood of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y in Istanbul was allocated to the SB\u00dc on 15 April 2015. The Haydarpa\u015fa Campus of the university was named \"Mekteb-i T\u0131bbiyye-i \u015eahane K\u00fclliyesi\" (\"Imperial School of Medicine Campus\") to honor the original name of the building. In August 2016, \"G\u00fclhane Askeri T\u0131p Akademisi\" (\"G\u00fclhane Military Medical Academy\") in Etlik, Ankara was incorporated into the University of Health Sciences by lifting its military status. The university began its education in the 2016\u201317 academic year with 82 students in medicine. ===Hamidiye Campus, Istanbul=== The construction of the Haydarpa\u015fa Campus building was ordered by Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II (reigned 1876\u20131909) in 1894. The building was designed by the architects French-Ottoman Alexander Vallaury (1850\u20131921) and Italian Raimondo D'Aronco (1857\u20131932). The rectangular-plan building covers with an inner courtyard land. The opening of the School of Medicine, named (literally: \"Imperial School of Medicine\"), took place by the sultan on his birthday on 6 November 1903. While the building hosted the Military Medicine School until 1909, it later served for a civilian Medicine School. It had a botanic garden with medicinal plants. It featured faculties of medicine and pharmacy. The school had an underground tunnel connection to the military hospital across it. In 1933, with the reorganization of the higher education in Turkey after the Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms, the Medicine School was closed. The building was allocated to the Haydarpa\u015fa High School. From 1983 on, the building was used by the Marmara University as a campus including also a Faculty of Medicine. All faculties, colleges and institutes situated at the Haydarpa\u015fa Campus were prefixed \"Hamidiye\" by a presidential decree in June 2019 after Abdul Hamid II, the founder of the initial medical school. ===G\u00fclhane Campus, Ankara=== In 1897, a protocol was signed with the German Empire to improve the medicine education in the Ottoman Empire. Prof. Robert Rieder of University of Bonn and Dr. Georg Deycke of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf came to Istanbul in 1898. In addition to their works at the Imperial School of Medicine, they converted the building of the military junior high school inside G\u00fclhane (literally: Rose Garden), the courtyard of Ottoman sultan's Topkap\u0131 Palace, into a modern healthcare facility. It was opened on 30 December 1898 and named \"G\u00fclhane Seririyat Hastanesi\" (\"G\u00fclhane Clinic Hospital\"). G\u00fclhane Hospital's first active presence took place in 1909 when its physicians, who were transferred to the newly established Faculty of Medicine, made out the majority of the academic staff. During World War I, the hospital undertook important duties in the successful delivery of health services to the Ottoman Army, and in the treatment of wounded soldiers brought from the Battle of Gallipoli (1915\u20131916). During the occupation of Istanbul from 1918 to 1923, G\u00fclhane Hospital was transferred to G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fsuyu quarter of Beyo\u011flu, Istanbul, and continued to serve during the Turkish War of Independence (1919\u20131922). Following the end of the occupation of Istanbul, the hospital returned to its previous location. With the beginning of World War II, it was decided to move the hospital to Ankara. In 1941, it started as \"G\u00fclhane Askeri Tababet Okulu ve Hastanesi\" (\"Gulhane Military Medical School and Hospital\") in the buildings of the military hospital at Cebeci quarter of \u00c7ankata district of Ankara. Iy played an important role in the establishment of Ankara University Medical School in 1945. Eleven of the fourteen professors and founding staff members originated from the Gulhane Military Medical School and Hospital. In 1947, it was renamed to \"G\u00fclhane Askeri T\u0131p Akademisi\" (GATA) (\"G\u00fclhane Military Medical Academy\"), and collaborated with the Ankara University's Medical School until 1952. In 1952, the Academy moved from Cebeci to Bah\u00e7elievler, Ankara leaving its buildings to the university's Medical School. As the buildings became insufficient, it was decided in 1963 to build a modern hospital complex in Etlik neighborhood of Ke\u00e7i\u00f6ren, Ankara. In 1971, the Academy moved into its new location. After the 2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt on 15 July, all of the 32 military hospitals, including the GATA, were transferred from the Ministry of National Defense to the Ministry of Health in August the same year. The GATA was renamed \"G\u00fclhane E\u011fitim ve Ara\u015ft\u0131rma Hastanesi\" (\"G\u00fclhane Education and Research Hospital\"), and was incorporated into the SB\u00dc by a presidential decree. ==Academics== ===Hamidiye Campus=== The academic units situated at the Hamidiye Campus in Haydarpa\u015fa, Istanbul are: * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Dentistry * Faculty of Pharmacy * Faculty of Nursing * Faculty of Health Sciences * Faculty of International Medicine * Faculty of Life Sciences * Institute of Health Sciences * Institute of Sports Health and Sports Science. ===G\u00fclhane Campus=== Following academic units serve at the G\u00fclhane Campus in Etlik, Ankara: * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Dentistry * Faculty of Pharmacy * Faculty of Nursing * Faculty of Health Sciences. ==References== Category:2015 establishments in Turkey Health Sciences Health Sciences Category:Universities established in the 2010s Category:Universities and colleges in Istanbul Category:Education in Istanbul Category:Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Category:Universities and colleges in Ankara Category:Education in Ankara Category:Ke\u00e7i\u00f6ren ",
