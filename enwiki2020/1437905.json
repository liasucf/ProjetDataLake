    "text": "Berenice () (275 BC-246 BC), also called Berenice Phernophorus (\"Dowry Bearer\") or Berenice Syra, was the daughter of Ptolemy II Philadelphus of his first wife Arsinoe I of Egypt. Around 252 BC, following the peace agreement of 253 BC between Antiochus and Ptolemy to end the Second Syrian War, she married the Seleucid monarch Antiochus II Theos, who divorced his wife Laodice I and transferred the succession to Berenice's children. In 246 BC, when Ptolemy died, Antiochus II took up again with his first wife, Laodice. Antiochus died shortly thereafter, many suspect from poisoning. Queen Berenice claimed the regency for her infant son Antiochus however, she and her son were both killed by Laodice. Berenice's brother, Ptolemy III Euergetes, succeeded their father and set about to avenge his sister's murder by invading Syria and having Laodice killed. This is also mentioned in the Book of Daniel .John H. Walton, Victor H. Matthews and Mark W. Chavalas.
