    "text": "{| |} PLA AFEU UAVs are Chinese UAVs developed by People's Liberation Army Air Force Engineering University, all of which are experimental aircraft. ==Fixed- wing MAV== PLA AFEU fixed-wing micro air vehicle (MAV) is a MAV developed by a six-member competition team consists of PLA AFEU students. The team participated in the 2015 Future Flight Design competition (FFP 2015) held in Turkey, and won first place. The MAV is in conventional layout with high wing configuration and twin tail. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven tractor engine mounted in the nose. The primary design focus is on increasing reliability and ability to be deployed in adverse weather, which resulted in the deployment sorties nearly ten times than that of the second- place winner of the competition. ==Stroller== PLA AFEU Stroller (Man-Bu-Zhe or Manbuzhe, \u6f2b\u6b65\u8005) experimental UAV is a Chinese UAV developed by the PLA AFEU, and it is an UAV primarily intended for research on cyclogyro. Stroller made its first public debut on September 22, 2011 in Beijing at the first UAV design competition. According to one of the designers, Mr. Yu Hong-Ku (\u4e8e\u5b8f\u5764), it took around four months from when the design first started to the first successful maiden flight on September 16, 2011. The aircraft was rushed into service in order to meet the deadline of the competition, and further refinement is planned based on trials to be conducted after the competition. Stroller UAV is capable of STOL due to its cyclogyro design.Stroller UAV Specification:Stroller *Wingspan (m): 2.6 *Length (m): 1.75 *Weight (kg): 4.5 ==See also== List of unmanned aerial vehicles of China ==References== Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of China ",
