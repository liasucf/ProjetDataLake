    "text": "The 2015\u201316 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, for the 2015\u201316 season. It ran alongside the 2015\u201316 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR). ==Teams== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"70%\" |- !width=\"20%\"|Club !! width=\"24%\"|City !! width=\"22%\"|Stadium !! width=\"9%\" | Capacity |- | Aviron Bayonnais | Bayonne (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques) | Stade Jean Dauger | align=center | 16,900 |- | SC Albi | Albi (Tarn) | Stadium Municipal d'Albi | align=center | 13,000 |- | Stade Aurillacois | Aurillac (Cantal) | Stade Jean Alric | align=center | 9,000 |- | AS B\u00e9ziers H\u00e9rault | B\u00e9ziers (H\u00e9rault) | Stade de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e | align=center | 18,500 |- | Biarritz Olympique | Biarritz (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques) | Parc des Sports Aguil\u00e9ra | align=center | 15,000 |- | CS Bourgoin-Jallieu | Bourgoin-Jallieu (Is\u00e8re) | Stade Pierre Rajon | align=center | 10,000 |- | US Carcassonne | Carcassonne (Aude) | Stade Albert Domec | align=center | 10,000 |- | US Colomiers | Colomiers (Haute-Garonne) | Stade Michel Bendichou | align=center | 11,400 |- | US Dax | Dax (Landes) | Stade Maurice Boyau | align=center | 16,170 |- | Lyon OU | Lyon (Rh\u00f4ne) | Matmut Stadium | align=center | 11,800 |- | US Montauban | Montauban (Tarn-et-Garonne) | Stade Sapiac | align=center | 12,600 |- | Stade Montois | Mont-de-Marsan (Landes) | Stade Guy Boniface | align=center | 22,000 |- | RC Narbonne | Narbonne (Aude) | Parc des Sports Et de l'Amiti\u00e9 | align=center | 12,000 |- | USA Perpignan | Perpignan (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es- Orientales) | Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral | align=center | 16,600 |- | Provence Rugby | Aix-en-Provence (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne) | Stade Maurice David | align=center | 4,000 |- | Tarbes Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Rugby | Tarbes (Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es) | Stade Maurice Tr\u00e9lut | align=center | 16,400 |} Changes in the lineup from 2014\u201315 were: * Pau won the 2014\u201315 Pro D2 title and were thereby automatically promoted to the Top 14. Agen won the promotion playoffs to secure the second promotion place. * The bottom finisher in 2014\u201315, Massy was relegated from Pro D2 to F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1. * The two bottom finishers in the 2014\u201315 Top 14 season, Bayonne and Lyon OU, were relegated to Pro D2. * The F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 champion Provence Rugby earned promotion. ==Competition format== The top team at the end of the regular season (after all the teams played one another twice, once at home, once away), is declared champion and earns a spot in the next Top 14 season. Teams ranked second to fifth compete in promotion playoffs, with the semifinals being played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final is then played on neutral ground, and the winner earns the second ticket to the next Top 14. The LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007\u201308 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons. France's bonus point system operates as follows: * 4 points for a win. * 2 points for a draw. * 1 bonus point for winning while scoring at least 3 more tries than the opponent. This replaces the standard bonus point for scoring 4 tries regardless of the match result. * 1 bonus point for losing by 5 points (or less). This is a change from previous seasons, in which the margin was 7 points or less. ==Table== ==Relegation== Normally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or prevent one of the two finalists in F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 from promotion. This season saw an example of the latter situation. Following the 2015\u201316 season, 15th-place Dax was spared relegation after Pro D2 side Tarbes was relegated due to excessive debt and failed in an appeal of the decision. ==Play\u2013offs== The highest ranked team at the end of the regular season, Lyon OU, earned automatic promotion to the Top 14 as champion de France de PRO D2 2016. ===Semi\u2013finals=== The semi\u2013finals followed a 2 v 5, 3 v 4 system, with the higher ranked team playing at home. \\---- * Under LNR rules, if a playoff match ends level after full-time, the first tiebreaker is try count. Agen advanced with 4 tries to Perpignan's 2. ===Final=== The winners of the semi\u2013finals played off for the second promotion spot to the Top 14. ==See also== *2015\u201316 Top 14 season ==References== ==External links== * Ligue Nationale de Rugby \u2013 Official website * Midi Olympique 2015\u201316 Pro D2 ",
