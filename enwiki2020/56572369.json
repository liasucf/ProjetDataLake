Milne, Richard; Christer Gardell, Cevian Capital founder, on clearing out boards; Financial Times; September 10, 2017; https://www.ft.com/content/1fdd0a6c-92ed-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0 In 2006, Cevian launched Cevian Capital II, the largest dedicated active ownership fund in Europe. The firm invests only in Europe, although 70% of its capital comes from North America. It does not short stocks, use leverage, write open letters, or engage in proxy fights, and it believes in long-term investments. At first its investments were confined to Scandinavia; more recently, according to Zimmerman, the firm's investment focus has been \"on the Nordics, UK, Germany and Switzerland,\" because these countries \"have a combination of clearest governance rules in favor of shareholders, good transparency as well as interesting companies.\" Cevian has not invested in southern or central Europe, Zimmerman has said, \"because we don't know those environments and we don't have relationships there, and we can't be certain that the rules, formal and informal rules, are ones that we'll be comfortable with.\" Gardell has also stated that he and his colleagues need \"to know the people, have networks, have a corporate governance tradition we're comfortable with\" in order to make an investment. In 2012, at Cevian's urging, Cookson, a British engineering firm, spun off its performance materials division, increasing investment value for Cookson shareholders by over 25%. On December 16, 2018, ABB relented to pressure from Cevian and agreed to sell its poorly-performing Power Grids unit.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abb-powergrids- hitachi/abb-relents-to-activist-shareholder-and-unloads-power-grids-unit- idUSKBN1OG06Q ==References== Category:Investment companies of Sweden ",
