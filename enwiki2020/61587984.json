    "text": "\"Rolz'n'Rulz\" is the second single from the album Gentleman by the Belarusian indie rock and power pop band Hair Peace Salon released on September 15, 2010. It consists of one song \u201cRolz'n'Rulz\u201d written by Aleh Vial together with Konstantin Karman. == History == The single \u201cRolz'n'Rulz\u201d was brought into free access on September 15, 2010, the same day as the remix EP \u201cHPS Remixed\u201d was released. the music portal Tuzin.fm urged its readers to download the new single with such words. The eponymous song from the single \u201cRolz'n'Rulz,\u201d where established rules, moral, and assigned public roles are reflected, was written is a collage manner that is distinctive to the early period of the band. The second single from the album itself half-opened its secret further and showed a shift towards richer instrumental and vocal parts in songs. \u201cHearing process should not be easy, the song is going to slightly open gradually, more and more, with every appearance in the player,\u201d members of the band Hair Peace Salon described their work for Experty.by. == Critical reception == Anton Sieranko\u016d, reviewer over at Experty.by, heard more rock and roll motifs than the power pop ones in the single and wrote in his review piece, \u201cThis is a very peppy, contagiously joyful song, with a clear melody and energetic guitars, made as simple as much with sincere enthusiasm. The coolest thing here, of course, is how the vocal parts are organized: formally, the lead vocalist is simply sung along, but it looks as if the musicians so burst with a desire to sing at least something that they push each other from the microphone away all the time.\u201d According to critic \u0179micier Padbiarezski from ej.by, who came to the conclusion that the band had very rethought the concept of rock 'n' roll in the single, \u201cRolz'n'Rulz\u201d is \u201cone of those songs, in which the band with such a complicated name quite convincingly demonstrates its ability to clearly organize musical material, and almost in the first place, vocals and present that properly.\u201d In 2012 as part of the album Gentleman, the song \u201cRolz'n'Rulz\u201d was noticed for the second time, received a good press: \u201cRolz'n'Rulz rulez\u201d (Alieh Klima\u016d, Experty.by), \u201cwonderful Rolz'n'Rulz\u201d (Siarhei Budkin, Experty.by, Budzma Belarusians!, Tuzin.fm), and, according to \u0179micier Padbiarezski from the site Experty.by, became a proof of the diverse repertoire of the album.
