    "text": "John David Brcin (; born Jovan Br\u010din; August 15 1899 - October 31 1983) was an American sculptor and artist. == Background and education == Brcin was born into a Serb family in Gra\u010dac (modern-day Croatia), to parents David and Milica Kesi\u0107 Br\u010din as Jovan Br\u010din. His father died when he was two years old. After his father's death, Brcin was brought up by an uncle who was a carpenter and mason. As a child, Brcin helped him carve simple wooden objects during the winter months. He immigrated to the United States in 1913 to join an older brother who was working at a bank in Gary, Indiana. In 1917, Brcin studied sculpture at Chicago's Art Institute, where he received a fellowship allowing him to pursue his studies for one year in Serbia, France and Italy. He obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts from The Art Institute of Chicago and a Master of Arts from Ohio State University.https://books.google.ca/books?id=sxXSAVBZxK8C&q;=john+david+brcin&dq;=john+david+brcin&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi6qMPVnrrmAhXaU80KHSpOCW44ChDoAQhRMAcBrcin became a member of the National Sculpture Society in 1935. He married Blanche Elizabeth Moore in 1923 and died in 1983 in Boulder, Colorado. == Career == Brcin's style relied on traditional portraiture and streamlined designs, as well as sharply cut geometric details done in bas-relief. He received various public commissions throughout the United States and also taught at several art schools. In 1929, Brcin became the official sculptor during the construction of the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska. He carved the building's pink marble exterior panels, featuring figures of Native Americans and European settlers. He also sculpted the memorial tablet to George Joslyn, various column and pilaster capitals, and the rosette designs of several entrances. According to the Chicago Herald-Examiner, \"Brcin\u2019s carvings are a new thing; they are full of dynamic thrust, a smooth sharp-edged symmetry which admirably interprets the spirit of an age governed by machinery.\"http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11\u222b_new=26441\u222b_modo=2#.WpneKlTwbcc Brcin also designed the museum's \"Sioux Warrior\" statue which was only completed in 2009 using his original plaster prototype. In 1948, Brcin produced the Governor Horner State Memorial, a granite monument located in Chicago, Illinois. The outdoor sculpture illustrates the career of Henry Horner, the 30th governor of Illinois. Originally erected in Grant Park, the memorial can now be found in Horner Park. In addition to commission work, Brcin was hired in 1922 to teach modeling and drawing at the Minneapolis School of Art. From 1923 to 1924, he headed the sculpture department at Milwaukee's Layton School of Art. He later taught modeling at Rockford Collegehttps://www.aaa.si.edu/files/resources/finding-aids/pdf/bullclar.pdf for two years starting in 1934. == Portfolio == * Bust of Nikola Tesla.https://books.google.ca/books?id=La0bllTbTM0C&pg;=PP13&dq;=john+david+brcin&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi01Oz0nLrmAhWaXM0KHdCSBpYQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&q;=john%20david%20brcin&f;=false * Bust of Bishop Nikolaj Velimirovi\u0107.https://www.eserbia.org/sapeople/art/1146-john-david-brcin * Head of Mark Twain (owned by the City of Chicago)http://www.artic.edu/sites/default/files/libraries/pubs/1926/AIC1926JDBrcin_comb.pdf * Bust of Mark Twain for North Central College, Naperville, Illinois * Caroline (owned by Witte Museum in San Antonio) * Portrait bust of Judge Elbert H.
