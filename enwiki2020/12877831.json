    "text": "Ursula Mancusi Ungaro (formerly Ungaro-Benages; born January 29, 1951) is a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. ==Education== Ungaro was born in 1951 in Miami Beach, Florida. She graduated from the University of Miami with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1973 and from the University of Florida College of Law with a Juris Doctor in 1975. ==Career== Ungaro was in private practice in Miami from 1976 to 1987. Ungaro practiced at Frates Floyd Pearson Stewart Richman & Greer from 1976 to 1978, Blackwell Walker Gray Powers Flick & Hoelhl from 1978 to 1980, Finley Kumble Heine Underberg Manley & Casey from 1980 to 1985, and was a shareholder at Sparber Shap & Heilbronner, P.A. from 1985 to 1987. Ungaro was a judge of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida from 1987 to 1992. ==Federal judicial service== President George H. W. Bush nominated Ungaro- Benages to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on November 26, 1991, to the new seat created by 104 Stat. 5089. Confirmed by the Senate on October 8, 1992, she received commission on October 9, 1992. ==Notable cases== On April 26, 2012, Ungaro ruled that an order issued by Florida Governor Rick Scott to randomly drug test 80,000 Florida state workers was unconstitutional. Ungaro found that Scott had not demonstrated that there was a compelling reason for the tests and that, as a result, they were an unreasonable search in violation of the Constitution. On December 19, 2018, Ungaro ruled, in Gubarev v. Buzzfeed, that Buzzfeed had not committed defamation in printing, in full, the Steele dossier. The claim was brought by Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian internet entrepreneur, who claimed to have been defamed by the publishing of the dossier by the media company, Buzzfeed. In part, Ungaro ruled the law of defamation does not equally apply to media institutions and does not require institutions to spend considerable resources to go line by line and determine the veracity of every claim in news reports. Ruling \"Such a line-by-line review would curtail the scope of the privilege and thus restrict the press\u2019s ability to serve its basic function.\" For Buzzfeed, the use of a hyperlink citing a CNN article which contained a two-page synopsis of the report was sufficient to allow Buzzfeed to publish the report. The lawyers for Gubarev vowed to appeal the decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and specifically intend to argue the hyperlink to the original CNN article was insufficient. Buzzfeed's counsel praised the ruling \"We are extremely pleased that Judge Ungaro affirmed our client\u2019s First Amendment rights in this matter. Fighting against restraints on reporting and maintaining public confidence in the constitutionally-mandated right to a free and unfettered press is vitally important, perhaps more so now than ever. The ruling is a strong affirmation of the First Amendment. It\u2019s more important that the public know what is being discussed at the highest levels of government than anything else. If BuzzFeed had not published, citizens would not understand the current conflict between the president and the other branches of government, as well as the conflict between the president and the special counsel.\" On May 9, 2018, Judge Ungaro was assigned an FDA Case (US Vs US Stem Cells). The FDA is attempting to stop stem cell clinics from operating and selling an adipose tissue derived product called Stromal Vascular Fraction. Customers would undergo a minor liposuction to harvest stem cells which would then be used to treat various health issues. US Stem Cells Inc. had a permanent injunction granted against them on June 3 of 2019 to stop performing Stromal Vascular Fraction procedures. With this motion, Judge Ungaro created an order to destroy thousand of banked stem cells within 31 days that were now considered a drug by the State of Florida.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1388319/000118518518000705/usstemcell10k123117.htm Legal experts believe this ruling was illegal because the banked stem cells are considered the property of each individual according to the contract of the banking agreement. In the United States, that means each person who has had their stem cells banked, has a right to due process before the destruction of their biological property if the contracting agreement deems that the cellular product being stored belongs to the customers, and not the banking facility. Judge Ungaro, the FDA, and the State of Florida did not give notice or provide legal proceeding to the individual who banked their stem cells. Nor did these parties give notice that their biological property would be destroyed. Judge Ungaro released a stay order on July 19, 2019 to delay the destruction of the banked cells.https://rickjaffeesq.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/07/staydestructionorder.pdf ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1951 births Category:American women judges Category:Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Category:Living people Category:People from Miami Beach, Florida Category:United States district court judges appointed by George H.
