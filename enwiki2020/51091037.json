In his PhD study, he worked in the Institute for Molecular Virology and Department of Biochemistry where he developed improved visual representations of biological viruses. Spencer served as research assistant on a project researching ways to improve communication about virology on the world wide web. He presented a paper on this topic at the Second International Worldwide Web Conference, where he met some of the team from Netscape and got interested in web development. In 1994, while still in graduate school, Spencer developed his first website. Spencer left his PhD study to pursue a career in Internet marketing. === WritersNet === Spencer founded WritersNet in 1994 while a graduate student. WritersNet was acquired by CrowdGather in June 2011. In January 2008, a lawsuit was filed against Spencer as the founder of WritersNet by literary agent Barbara Bauer, who simultaneously filed suit against the Wikimedia Foundation, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Inc, and over a dozen other parties on the legal claims of defamation, conspiracy, and tortious interference.
