    "text": "Lou Drap\u00e9 (lo drapet in the classical norm of Occitan, lou or lo meaning \u201cthe\u201d) is a legendary folkloric horse from of the town of Aigues-Mortes in the Gard region, in the Petite Camargue marsh area of France. It is said to wander around the walls of the city at night and to take a large number of children on his back to abduct them. These children never return from this journey. Lou Drap\u00e9 could be a version of the drac legend of Occitania, an evil creature that can assume the shape of a horse. The image of this ghastly horse, a symbol of death, is used to scare children, like the bogeyman or the big bad wolf in other regions of France. It is part of an abundant folklore of evil kidnapper horses, which are often linked to water. == Etymology and terminology == According to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, drapet or draquet is the name given to a small drac, a small lutin in the Languedoc region. Furthermore, he explains that in Montpellier (fairly close to Aigues-Mortes) drapet can be used to describe a revenant, potentially a ghost \u201cdraped\u201d in a shroud, which could explain the connection \u2013and confusion\u2013 between the forms drapet-draquet. However, there exists no direct source to explain the name \u201clou Drap\u00e9\u201d. == Legend == Painting by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille representing the queens' gates of Aigues-Mortes as they were in the 19th century, at the time of the legend. Like any piece of folklore, the story of Lou Drap\u00e9 has been transmitted orally for a long time, however the date of its first appearance remains unknown. === Mentions in the 19th century === \u201cLou Drap\u00e9\u201d is mentioned in an 1818 text by Jacques-Albin-Simon Collin de Plancy in his book on demonic creatures, the Dictionnaire infernal: The later editions of the Dictionnaire infernal (1844, 1845 and 1846), which contain revisions compared to the first edition, also mention lou Drap\u00e9 in the same way. In 1856, Jacques-Paul Migne provides some additional information in his Encyclop\u00e9die th\u00e9ologique, a catholic book co- written with Collin de Plancy: === Mentions in the 20th and 21st centuries === Collin de Plancy's written version of the story is copied in 19th century books and magazines specialising in folklore (the Revue des traditions populaires for instance). The Guide de la Provence myst\u00e9rieuse, published in 1965, says that children at the time were still being threatened with the coming of lou Drap\u00e9. In the 1988 esoteric work Les dossiers de l\u2019Histoire myst\u00e9rieuse, lou Drap\u00e9 is described as a ghastly big white horse that wanders at night around the walls of Aigues-Mortes, producing a melodious sound with his hooves. As it proceeds, children wake up and leave their houses without a sound. As it passes, lou Drap\u00e9 gathers the lost children on its back one after the other and takes them away to the marshes of Grau-du-Roi. The destination of the children taken by lou Drap\u00e9 is different depending on the author. Whilst Bernard Sergent talks of dangerous quicksand and swamps where the children drown, others like Catherine Rager and \u00c9douard Brasey make a connection with the famous film White Mane by evoking a \u201cmysterious faraway kingdom\u201d, or an enchanted land where the children subject to the cruelty of Man can live forever with their horse friend. According to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Histoire et d\u2019Arch\u00e9ologie d\u2019Aigues-Mortes, \u201cno-one ever knew where it [lou Drap\u00e9] took them [the children] and, in fact, no-one has ever wanted to know.\u201d The last child to have ridden the horse is said to have freed all the others by screaming \u201cJesus, Mary, great Saint Joseph!!\u201d and jumping to the ground, which would cause lou Drap\u00e9 to disappear. \u00c9douard Brasey adds in La Petite Encyclop\u00e9die du merveilleux that just like the horse Bayard, lou Drap\u00e9 seems to have a back and rump of ordinary size but is able to elongate them. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de mythologie fran\u00e7aise tells of the existence of a popular nursery rhyme sung by the children of Aigues-Mortes: == Origin and symbolism == The drac, assuming the shape of a red donkey, on its way to drown careless children. The particularity of lou Drap\u00e9 is that it only attacks vagabond children, which makes it, as Collin de Plancy notices, a symbol of the prevention of mothers\u2019 negligence. Its relationship to the croque-mitaine and the ogre (with which it shares the role of \u201cterror of children\u201d) has been discussed, notably by anthropologist Nicole Belmont. Furthermore, lou Drap\u00e9 is specific to the folklore of the town of Aigues-Mortes, where \u201cinto marshes flows the terrible Vidourle\u201d, known for its devastating floods. For Jacques de Biez, it could have symbolised the courage of the horse when it comes to work, for it \u201cdoes not care about the work charge. It does its duty.\u201d === A version of the drac === The exact origins of the Drap\u00e9 are not known, but this fantastic horse seems to be one of the many versions of the drac of Occitania, that is to say a demon linked to water and its dangers that often assumes the appearance of a donkey or a horse and evokes the Devil. The Dictionnaire des symboles describes the drac as a \u201cbeautiful white horse that takes travellers away to drown them in the Doubs\u201d, whereas Henri Dontenville speaks of the valley of the Alagnon in the Cantal region, where a river runs \u201cserpentine like a snake\u201d. There, the drac takes up residence, turns into a beautiful white horse and obediently lets children and shepherds ride it before drowning them. === The water and the little people === Japanese folklorists looked at the existing connections between the horse and water creatures to explain the Japanese figure of the kappa. Chiwaki Shinoda underlines how old this association is, which could be explained, according to Kunio Yanagita, by a ritual transformation of the sacrifice of the horse in the liquid element. As early as the Neolithic Age, water genies have been connected to equine beasts. The Dictionnaire des symboles cites a great number of \u201cevil horses, accomplices of swirling waters\u201d, mainly in French-German folklore: blanque jument, Bian cheval, Schimmel Reiter, and the drac. Jean-Michel Doulet notices in his study of changelings that \u201cby the water, the silhouettes of the lutin and the horse tend to get mixed up and merge into one single entity whose role is to lead astray, to scare off and to plunge the ones who ride it into any pond or river\u201d. He cites this Aigues-Mortes legend as one of his examples. According to a study on dwarves in the Middle Ages, the links between lutins and fantastic horses are very close for, in the chansons de geste as well as in the more modern folklore, when the little people take the form of an animal, it most often is that of a horse. Many other horses from French folklore play a similar role in relation to water, as mentioned by elficologist Pierre Dubois in La Grande Encyclop\u00e9die des f\u00e9es. He cites the Guernesey horse, the Albret horse, and the personification of the sea in the shape of a mare in Brittany: most of these \u201cfairy-horses\u201d end up drowning their riders. === The lunar whiteness === The Dictionnaire des symboles lingers on the whiteness of \u201cghastly, pale\u201d horses, \u201cnocturnal, lunar, cold and empty\u201d animals, like a shroud or a ghost, which must not be confused with Uranian animals. Their colour evokes grief, like the white steed of the horseman of the Apocalypse, herald of death. According to later versions of the legend, the \u201clunar\u201d colour white that the Drap\u00e9 shares with other evil horses \u2013such as the Cheval Mallet\u2013 would be the colour of cursed horses. === The lengthening rump === One of the typical characteristics of lou Drap\u00e9 is its rump that can be lengthened to allow a great number of children to ride it. It is found in other fairy-horses like Bayard and the blanque jument of the Pas-de-Calais region. According to Henri Dontenville, this characteristic is serpentine, or at least reptilian. In fact, \u201cone only has to look at a snake unrolling or, more simply, a worm to understand the origins of this myth\u201d. In a collection of tales by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Blad\u00e9, Pierre Lafforgue reports that a steed carrying three riders and possessing the ability to lengthen its rump is a Cheval Mallet, a form of the Devil which can only be fought by making a sign of the cross and refusing to ride it. === Similar legends === Legends very close to that of lou Drap\u00e9 exist. At the trou du Vivi\u00e8s, three kilometres away from Narbonne, a mythical horse with an extensible rump is known to take a great number of children on its back and carry them away forever. There exists a variant with a donkey in Mas-Cabard\u00e8s. It too can elongate its back to accommodate children. One day it crosses a river carrying a dozen of them and, as it reaches the middle, lets them fall in the water before taking up another form and perching on a nearby rock, laughing at the trick it has just played on them. These two legends are also variants of the drac. == See also == * Kelpie == References == Category:French legendary creatures Category:Mythological horses Category:Camargue ",
