    "text": "The 1984\u201385 Biathlon World Cup was a multi-race tournament over a season of biathlon, organised by the UIPMB (Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon). The season started on 10 January 1985 in Minsk, Soviet Union, and ended on 9 March 1985 in Holmenkollen, Norway. It was the eighth season of the Biathlon World Cup. In Oberhof, the skating style of skiing made its introduction to biathlon. It was somewhat of a revolution as the skating style is quite a lot faster than the classic style. Some athletes did not adapt as quickly to the new style, and some nations, including West Germany and Norway, petitioned for a ban of the skating style. There was originally going to be held a relay in Holmenkollen, but the relay had to be cancelled due to fog. ==New scoring system== The World Cup scoring system was changed before this season. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border:1px solid #C0C0C0; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; margin-top:1em; text- align:center\" width=\"100%\" |- bgcolor=\"#E0E0E0\" ! colspan=\"31\" | Points allocation from 1984\u201385 to 1999\u20132000 |- | bgcolor=\"#F8F8F8\" | Place | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |- | bgcolor=\"#F8F8F8\" | Points | 30 | 26 | 24 | 22 | 21 | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |} ==Calendar== Below is the World Cup calendar for the 1984\u201385 season. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !

The Aftenposten source gives a bit different scores and places France 3rd, Norway 4th, Italy 5th and Austria 7th. The Sports Book has been given precedent as that also shows whence the scores came. :2. This was an unofficial version of the Nation Cup that ultimately would be implemented in the 1986\u201387 season, though in this version only the individual races counted. :3. The Lahti Ski Museum has omitted Meloche from the list of results for some reason, but Aftenposten and the Sports Book includes her. ==References== Category:Biathlon World Cup World Cup ",
