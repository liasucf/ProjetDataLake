The shrine was envisioned in 1812 as a secular memorial to famous men of Pistoia. ==Description== The initial design was far grander, but the tumultuous events of the Napoleonic wars interrupted construction, such that it was not complete until the early 1820s in a much reduced scale.Lecture by Laura Dominici on Pistoia celebra gli uomini illustri on 8 April 2008. The design was by Cosimo Rossi Melocchi.Le dimore di Pistoia e della Valdinievole, article by Gabriele Morolli, edited by Emilia Daniele, Associazione dimore storiche italiane. Sezione Toscana, Editrice Alinea, Florence (2004): page 40-41. The architecture has simple tapering Doric columns, that recall Egyptian temple columns, under rusticated temple facade with two angelic figures holding a central wreath around a checkered pattern, symbol of Pistoia. Melocchi would repeat his plans for a Pantheon in Villa Puccini a Scornio.Pistoia e il suo territorio: Pescia e i suoi dintorni: guida del forestiero, by Giuseppe Tigri, Tipografia Cino, Pistoia (1853): page 293. For some years, the site was used as a cafe. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Pistoia Category:Monuments and memorials in Tuscany Category:Neoclassical architecture in Tuscany ",
