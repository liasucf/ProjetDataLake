    "text": "Hodge c. 1893 Clifton Fremont Hodge (16 October 1859-1949) was an American professor of physiology who worked at Clark University. An educator and a keen experimental biologist, he took great interest in natural history, animal behavior, and public understanding of biology taking an active role in debates on vivisection, experimentation on animals, conservation, and evolution. == Life and work == Hodge was born in Janesville, Wisconsin to Mary (Merrill) and Nelson Wellington. He graduated with a BA from Ripon College in 1882, and worked as a civil engineer in Montana and Wyoming before joining Johns Hopkins University in 1886. Receiving a Ph.D. in 1889 he also worked in the university museum as a curator and was a fellow in biology. He worked as a naturalist on the USFC Fish Hawk and then joined Clark University where he worked on neurobiology while also promoting biological education at all levels including sex education in high schools. He demonstrated fatigue in nerve cells by continuous stimulation of sympathetic and spinal ganglia of frogs. He conducted experiments on the effect of alcohol to cats and dogs. He then moved to the University of Wisconsin. From 1913 he served as professor of biology at the University of Oregon. He studied problems related to nuisance insects and worked on efficient traps. His textbook Civic Biology (1919) coauthored with Jean Dawson (who was later his wife) was among the last pro-evolution texts to be published prior to the 1920s anti-Darwinian movement. He became a professor of extension at the University of Florida around 1919, taking an interest in applied biology, including local problems relating to flies and mosquitoes. Undated portrait from the Smithsonian Institution Archives Hodge was a keen naturalist, outdoors educator, and a member of the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU). At the 1909 meeting of the AOU he raised issue with the $100 reward being offered by Colonel Anthony Kuser for fresh specimens of the passenger pigeon and stated that he would not shoot a pigeon for even $1000. Kuser subsequently changed the reward to $300 for evidence of breeding. Hodge was also interested in animal as well as human behavior and introduced the idea of the ball and field test which was developed by his student Lewis M. Terman more formally and used in psychology studies. He examined how animals navigated their habitat and was critical of any suggestions of unknown senses and suggested rigorous experimental approaches. He wrote that \"All animals, from amoeba to man, spend a good share of their time searching for something or other. May there not be a fundamental logic of search as universal as the search itself?. . .What is the path or curve of logical search?\" and experimented on animal and human search strategies. Hodge examined homing pigeons and noted that there was learning involved in their homing. He also attempted to domesticate ruffed grouse and raised bobwhite quails. He influenced the ornithologist Margaret Morse Nice.

He married Jean Dawson (1872-1928) in 1915 and settled in Sebring, Florida where he died. ==References== == External links == * Nature study and life (1902) (1903) * The Bobwhite (1890) * A microscopical study of changes due to functional activity in nerve cells (1892) * Civic Biology.
