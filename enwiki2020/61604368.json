Their home was in an area surrounded by Tory neighbors, and after her older sons went off to fight, Rosanna and her younger children were left unprotected. She was proud though, to have four of her sons fighting for liberty and independence. Back at home, Rosanna and her daughters often had to hide food, and slept with pistols or weapons under their pillows in the chance that they might need them. One night in 1780, the Farrow household was awoken by a voice at their gate that informed them that three of the Farrow sons had been captured by the British and were imprisoned at the Ninety-Six District, South Carolina. Hearing that the British Colonel John Cruger would be willing to release her sons in exchange for British prisoners, Rosanna Waters Farrow sprung into action. She gave her daughters directions to keep the windows and doors closed, and to allow no one except friends into the home. She grabbed a rifle, saddled the one remaining horse on the property, and rode off into the darkness of the night to rescue her sons. She arrived at the patriot camp, and petitioned James Williams (Revolutionary War) to grant her six of the captured British soldiers and a guard to make the exchange. He granted her this request, and she set off towards the British camp. Rosanna was just in time, as the British were preparing to hang her sons at sunrise. It is reported that at the close of the exchange Rosanna Waters Farrow told Colonel John Cruger \"I have given you two for one, Colonel Cruger, but understand that I consider it the best trade I ever made, for rest assured hereafter the 'Farrow boys' will whip you four to one.\", \u201cRosanna Farrow, a South Carolina Revolutionary War Heroine.\u201d Colonial Quills, n.d. https://colonialquills.blogspot.com/2011/10/rosanna-farrow-south- carolina.html. , Waters, Philemon Berry, Herbert M.
