    "text": "Counterspeech is a tactic of countering hate speech or misinformation by presenting an alternate narrative rather than with censorship of the offending speech. It also means responding to hate speech with empathy and challenging the hate narratives, rather than responding with more hate speech directed in the opposite direction. According to advocates, counterspeech is more likely to result in deradicalization and peaceful resolution of conflict. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * Category:Hate speech Category:Freedom of speech ",
