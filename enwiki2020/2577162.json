    "text": "Hall i' th' Wood railway station is the last stop before Bolton on the Northern Trains franchise's Ribble Valley Line into Blackburn and Clitheroe in England. The station opened by British Rail on 29 September 1986. It is located in the middle of a housing estate and forms an unofficial footpath between the two sides. In March 2008 work began on a new car park for the station. It takes its name from the nearby Hall i' th' Wood, now a museum which is within walking distance of the station. ==Facilities== The station is unmanned and has basic amenities - waiting shelters and timetable posters on each platform, plus a telephone and CIS screens for train running information provision. The wooden platforms are staggered, with the southbound one the further north of the two. There is no step-free access to either platform (the ramps from the road that passes beneath the line both have steps).Hall i' th' Wood station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 9 December 2016 ==Services== Latest franchise operator Northern Trains run a much enhanced all day half-hourly service Weekdays and Saturdays in both directions (which started in December 2017), but still hourly on Sundays, rather than merely at morning and evening peak periods as before. The additional services however start/terminate at Blackburn. The timetable has also been affected by weekend engineering work south of Bolton (as part of the heavily delayed Manchester to Preston Line electrification project) for much of 2018. ==References== ==External links== Category:Railway stations in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton Category:Railway stations opened by British Rail Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1986 Category:Northern franchise railway stations ",
