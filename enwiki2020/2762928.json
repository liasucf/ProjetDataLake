    "text": "Smokin' is the fifth studio album by the English group Humble Pie, released in 1972. The album peaked at #6 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart,US Billboard Chart No. 6 and hit the UK Top 30 and number 9 in Australia. ==Background== The album was Humble Pie's first following the departure of guitarist Peter Frampton, which placed singer and co-founder Steve Marriott as the band's de facto leader. Smokin' is the band's best-selling album, due in large part to the success of the single \"30 Days in the Hole\". Smokin' includes dramatically slowed down versions of Eddie Cochran's \"C'mon Everybody\", Junior Walker's \"Road Runner\", and the wah-wah laden slow blues \"I Wonder\". \"You're So Good for Me\", which begins as a delicate acoustic number, ultimately mutates into a full-bore gospel music rave-up, an element that would later influence bands like The Black Crowes. Alexis Korner guests on the track \"Old Time Feelin'\", Marriott's vocals take a back seat as the main vocals are provided by Greg Ridley and Korner who also plays a Martin Tiple, mandolin-type guitar. Its sound is reminiscent of the song \"Alabama '69\" on their first album. Stephen Stills guests on \"Road Runner 'G' Jam\" (the title is a nod to the band's habit of developing songs out of jam sessions), playing Hammond organ, and his backing vocals were over-dubbed on \"Hot 'n' Nasty\" a slow-burning and then dynamic R&B; song, after he strolled in after recording his own sessions next door. Marriott insisted on producing the album himself for the challenge of creating a compact R&B; sound with a high-tech 24-track mixing board. Marriott collapsed with exhaustion in February. New Musical Express (NME) reported at the time: \"Following intense recording sessions with Humble Pie, Steve Marriott collapsed with nervous exhaustion and doctors told him to rest\". With this album the group were seen as leaders of the boogie movement in the early 1970s. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Steve Marriott - lead & backing vocals, guitar, harp, keyboards *Clem Clempson - guitar, keyboards, backing vocals *Greg Ridley - bass, lead & backing vocals *Jerry Shirley - drums, piano on \"You're so good for me\" Guests : *Alexis Korner - vocals, tiple (similar sound to mandolin) on \"Old Time Feelin'\" *Stephen Stills - organ, backing vocals on \"Hot 'n' Nasty\" *Doris Troy - backing vocals \"You're So Good for Me\" *Madeline Bell - backing vocals \"You're So Good for Me\" Production : *Album Cover art designed by Kosh *Engineers : Alan O'Duffy, Keith Harwood *Recorded at Olympic Studios, London, February 1972. *Produced by The Pie ===Other releases=== *1990 CD A&M; *1972 LP A&M; *1990 CS A&M; *2007 CD Universal *1995 CD Universal/A&M; *2007 CD Universal Japan *2017 LP Box Disc 4 A&M; ('The A&M; Vinyl Boxset 1970-1975', released on 16 June 2017) ==Notes== ==External links== *The History of Humble Pie - Domain for sale *The official Steve Marriott website - 404 Error Category:1972 albums Category:Humble Pie (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Steve Marriott Category:A&M; Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Olympic Sound Studios ",
