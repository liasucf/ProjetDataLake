    "text": "== Background of the Theses == The Situationist International's interpretation of the Paris Commune of 1871 was influenced by their collaboration with Henri Lefebvre with whom they had been in contact since the late 1950s.Lefebvre, Henri. Interview by Kristin Ross. \u201cHenri Lefebvre on the Situationist International.\u201d Not Bored, 1983 Lefebvre\u2019s writings on revolutionary romanticism and everyday life were important influences on the early SI. Debord, Guy. \u201cPerspectives for Conscious Changes in Everyday Life\u201d Translated by Ken Knabb, Internationale Situationniste, vol. 6, Aug. 1961. Bureau of Public Secrets In the early 1960s Guy Debord, Attila Kot\u00e1nyi and Raoul Vaneigem agreed to assist Lefebvre in his preparations for a book on the Commune (which he eventually published in 1965 as La Proclamation de la Commune). The results of their brainstorming sessions were written down in 1962 by the SI in their \u201cTheses on the Paris Commune.\u201d After Lefebvre published his respective notes on their collaboration, in a 1962 piece entitled \u201cLa Signification de la Commune,\u201d the two parties had a falling out as the SI ostensibly disagreed with the journal in which he published.\u201cInto the Trashcan of History!\u201d Translated by NOT BORED!, 1963. NOT BORED Both the SI and Lefebvre published extensively on the feud in the following decade.\u201cLefebvre the Historian.\u201d Translated by Reuben Keehan. Internationale Situationniste, vol. 10, March 1966. Situationist International Online == Theses on the Paris Commune == Debord, Kot\u00e1nyi and Vaneigem gave the theses the symbolic date of 18 March; the anniversary of the start of the Commune. The theses remained unpublished in their official journal until its final issue in 1969.Debord, Guy, Attila Kot\u00e1nyi, and Raoul Vaneigem. \u201cTheses on the Paris Commune\u201d Translated by Ken Knabb, Mar. 1962. Bureau of Public Secrets The SI's interpretation of the Commune is informed by their libertarian Marxism. Henri Lefebvre\u2019s influence on the theses is notable in the theses' preoccupation with everyday life, social space, and the Commune as a revolutionary festival.Grindon, Gavin. \u201cRevolutionary Romanticism: Henri Lefebvre\u2019s Revolution-as-Festival.\u201d Third Text, vol. 27, no. 2, 2013, pp. 208-20. Taylor & Francis Online The SI\u2019s interpretation of the Commune is also clearly influenced by their own activist programs in the late 1950s and early 1960s. For instance, in the seventh thesis the authors applaud the Communards\u2019 violence against monuments, as signs of capitalist power, and claim that the Commune \u201crepresents the only implementation of a revolutionary urbanism to date.\u201dDebord, Guy, Attila Kot\u00e1nyi, and Raoul Vaneigem. \u201cTheses on the Paris Commune \u201dTranslated by Ken Knabb, Mar. 1962. Bureau of Public Secrets In their own unitary urbanism program and other writings the SI advocated similar attacks on the signs of capitalism and their practice of constructing situations was very much intertwined with a transformation of social space.Kot\u00e1nyi, Attila, and Raoul Vaneigem. \u201cBasic Program of the Bureau of Unitary Urbanism.\u201d Translated by Ken Knabb.
