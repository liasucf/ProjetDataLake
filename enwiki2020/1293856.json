Esmond was born Harry Esmond Jack in Hampton Court, Middlesex, the son of Richard George Jack, a physician and surgeon and his wife Mary Rynd. He was baptised on 22nd February 1870 at the Church of St Mary, Hampton Court, Middlesex. He began his career as an actor in London in 1889 where he had several successes in comedies. He began writing plays, usually comedies, while in his early twenties. These plays were very popular and were also highly fashionable with their themes of light-hearted romance appealing to the audience of the day. He toured with a number of these plays and co-starred in them with his wife, Eva Moore.Joannou, Maroula. \"Moore, Eva (1868\u20131955)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 30 January 2013 His plays were also well received in the United States where nine of them were produced on Broadway between 1899 and 1907. For the next Broadway production, Eliza Comes to Stay, Esmond travelled to New York to appear alongside his wife and the popular actor Leslie Banks. This proved to be the greatest success of his career. He continued writing, acting and touring until his sudden death in Paris, France caused by pneumonia. He was the father of the actress Jill Esmond. ==References== == External links == * * Category:English male stage actors Category:English dramatists and playwrights Category:1869 births Category:1922 deaths Category:19th-century English male actors Category:20th- century English male actors Category:19th-century English writers Category:20th-century English writers Category:19th-century British dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century British dramatists and playwrights Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Infectious disease deaths in France Category:English male dramatists and playwrights Category:19th-century British male writers Category:20th-century British male writers ",
