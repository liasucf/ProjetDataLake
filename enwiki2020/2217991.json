The Irish Cricket Union, operating under the brand Cricket Ireland is the sport's governing body in Ireland, and organises the international team. Ireland participate in all three major forms of the international game; Test, One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. They are the 11th Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the second Full Member from Europe, having been awarded Test status, along with Afghanistan, on 22 June 2017. Cricket was introduced to Ireland in the 19th century, and the first match played by an Ireland team was in 1855. Ireland toured Canada and the United States in the late 19th century, and occasionally hosted matches against touring sides. Ireland's most significant international rivalry, with the Scotland national cricket team, was established when the teams first played each other in 1888. Ireland's maiden first-class match was played in 1902. Ireland were elected to Associate membership of the ICC in 1993, but played their first full ODI in 2006 against England in the build-up to the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, their first successful qualification. At that tournament, a series of eye-catching results against Full Members, including a draw against Zimbabwe, and wins against Pakistan and Bangladesh confirmed Ireland's ODI status after the competition. Since then, they have gone on to play 157 ODIs, resulting in 67 victories, 79 defeats, 8 no results, and 3 ties. Contracts for players were introduced in 2009, marking the transition to becoming a professional team. Further success in the shortest format meant the Ireland team also qualified for the 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2020 World Twenty20 competitions. Prior to attaining Test status, Ireland also played first-class international cricket in the ICC Intercontinental Cup, which they have won four times between 2005 and 2013. Due to their successes in the first-class ICC Intercontinental Cup competition, and further high profile wins at the World Cups of 2011 (England) and 2015 (West Indies and Zimbabwe), they were labelled the \"leading Associate\" Retrieved 3 November 2008. and stated their intention to become a full member by 2020. This intention was realised in June 2017, when the ICC unanimously decided to award Ireland and Afghanistan Full Member status, which allows them to participate in Test matches. ==History== ===Early history=== Cricket was introduced to Ireland by the English in the towns of Kilkenny and Ballinasloe in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, the game began to spread; many of the clubs which were founded in the following 30 years are still in existence today. Retrieved 3 November 2008. The first Irish national team played in 1855 against The Gentlemen of England in Dublin. In the 1850s, the Englishman Charles Lawrence was responsible for developing the game in Ireland through his coaching. In the 1850s and 1860s, Ireland was visited for the first time by touring professional teams. Ireland's first match against Marylebone Cricket Club (the M.C.C.) was in 1858. The game gained popularity until the early 1880s. The land war in the 1880s resulting from the Irish Land Commission and a ban on playing \"foreign\" games, in practice, British, by the Gaelic Athletic Association set back the spread of cricket. The ban was lifted in 1970, and before then anyone playing foreign games, such as cricket was banned from the Irish games such as hurling and Gaelic football. Irish teams toured Canada and the US in 1879, 1888, 1892, and 1909. On top of this, Ireland defeated a touring South African side in 1904. Their first match with first-class status was played on 19 May 1902 against a London County side including W.G. Grace. The Irish, captained by Sir Tim O'Brien, won convincingly by 238 runs. Retrieved 5 November 2008. ===Before 1993=== After the 1902 tour of England, where four matches yielded one win, two draws and one loss, Ireland did not play first-class cricket again for five years. Retrieved 11 November 2008. Although the team had lost to the South Africans in 1894 \u2013 Ireland's first match against a Test-playing nation \u2013 Ireland defeated South Africa in 1904; it was the team's first victory against a Test side. Retrieved 11 November 2008. In 1909, the first annual first-class match between Ireland and Scotland was held, and an annual match against the MCC was arranged from 1924 onwards. The Irish played yearly first-class matches with the Scots, only interrupted by world wars, until 1999, but all their other cricket depended upon touring international sides finding it convenient to include a visit to Ireland in their schedules. However, Ireland sometimes surprised Test nations on these occasions, beating the West Indies by 60 runs in a three-day match in Dublin in 1928, for example; it was Ireland's first match against the West Indies. In 1969, in a match played at Sion Mills in County Tyrone, the team defeated a West Indian side including Clive Lloyd and Clyde Walcott by nine wickets, after bowling them out for 25. Retrieved 16 November 2008. This was the last time Ireland defeated a touring side until 2003, when they beat Zimbabwe by ten wickets. The Scots and the Irish were mostly competing with Sri Lanka for the title as the best non-Test nation at the time \u2013 indeed, Ireland drew with Sri Lanka in a rain-hit first-class match in 1979, Ireland scoring a total of 341 for 7 in two innings, while Sri Lanka made 288 for 6 in one innings. Ireland, along with Scotland and the Netherlands, has at times played in competitions for English county cricket sides, including the Benson & Hedges Cup and the Friends Provident Trophy (previously the C&G; Trophy). Since there is no nationality restriction in county cricket, non-Irish people were allowed to compete for Ireland in these matches.

Their desire to achieve Test status was in part to stem the tide of Irish players using residency rules to switch to England for the opportunity to play Test cricket. Deutrom outlined the ambition as he unveiled the new strategic plan for Irish cricket to 2015. The plan set out a series of stretching goals including increasing the number of participants in the game to 50,000, setting a target of reaching 8th in the World rankings, establishing a domestic first-class cricket structure, and reinforcing cricket as the fifth most popular team sport in Ireland. Deutrom had already sent a letter to the ICC in 2009 stating his board's intention to apply for Full Membership \u2013 a potential pathway to Test cricket \u2013 and to seek clarification on the process. Former Australian bowler Jason Gillespie said that if Ireland got Test status it \"would be huge news in world cricket, and it would be a massive positive story for the world game\". Following Ireland's victory over the West Indies in the 2015 Cricket World Cup, former fast bowler Michael Holding said that the International Cricket Council should grant Ireland Test status immediately, saying \"they need to be recognised now\". The ICC said in 2015 that Ireland would be granted Test status in 2019 should they win the 2015\u201317 ICC Intercontinental Cup and beat the 10th ranked Test nation in a four-match Test series in 2018. However, on 22 June 2017, after more than a decade of playing top-class international cricket, full ICC membership was granted to Ireland (along with Afghanistan) at an ICC meeting in London, thus making them the eleventh Test cricket team. In October 2017, the ICC announced that Ireland's first Test match would be at home against Pakistan in May 2018. Ireland played their first 'touring' test in India in March 2019 against fellow newcomers Afghanistan, where they lost by 7 wickets. This is to be followed by a four-day Test match against England at Lord's in July 2019. According to the ICC Future Tours Programme for 2019\u201323, Ireland are scheduled to play sixteen Tests, but along with Afghanistan and Zimbabwe, are not included in the first two editions of the ICC World Test Championship. In October 2019, Andrew Balbirnie was appointed Test and ODI captain and one month later, in November he also took over the captaincy of T20I from Gary Wilson, thus becoming all format captain for Ireland. ==International grounds== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !

In common with a number of other Ireland sporting governing bodies, the Union was formed to represent cricket throughout the island of Ireland, rather than just the Republic of Ireland. In common with its counterparts for rugby union, rugby league and field hockey, the Union therefore does not use the Irish tricolor, but instead employs its own flag, which is used by such bodies as the International Cricket Council to represent the team and in ICC tournaments; \"Ireland's Call\" is used as the national anthem.Official Cricket Ireland site showing use of flag International Cricket Council official site In 2007, the ICU announced major changes to bring it into line with the main cricket governing bodies. After the World Cup, Irish cricket had poor results in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy, as many players were unavailable. The Irish cricket team was an amateur side and most of the players had full-time jobs with commitments conflicting with cricket. Warren Deutrom, the chief executive of the ICU, has stated that it wants to \"seek actively to place Irish players into top-level cricket, by developing relationships with [especially] county cricket which will incorporate appropriate player release for Irish international duty, and feeder systems for developing Irish cricketers\". The reorganised ICU sought closer links with the English county teams, to encourage the development of age group cricket, and to introduce a professional element into the Irish game. They also want to take the Ireland cricket team on winter tours more often. In an attempt to prevent the game losing players to counties or other commitments such as jobs, it was suggested that central contracts should be introduced. This was done in June 2009, with the first two going to Trent Johnston and Alex Cusack. The number of full-time contracts was expanded to six in January 2010 with support for a further nine players; the contracts were split into three categories. In January 2012 the number of contracts was increased to 23, and coach Phil Simmons highlighted the process of becoming professional as an important factor in the team's success. ==Team colours== In test matches, Ireland wears cricket whites, with the optional sweater or vest with a green v-neck with the Cricket Ireland logo on the centre. The shirts feature the Cricket Ireland logo on the right breast, the manufacturer logo on the sleeve and the sponsor logo on the left breast. The fielders wear a navy blue cricket cap or a white sunhat with the Cricket Ireland logo. The batsman helmets are coloured similarly. In limited-overs cricket, Ireland wears an emerald green (in ODI) or lawn green (in T20) uniform with navy blue and white accents and feature the Cricket Ireland logo on the right breast, the sponsor logo on the centre and the manufacturer logo on the left breast. The fielders wear a dark blue baseball-style cap or sunhat. In ICC-regulated tournaments, the sponsor logo goes to the non-leading arm sleeve, making space for the inscription \"IRELAND\" written in white, on the centre section of the shirt. The sponsor is Turkish Airlines and the manufacturer is O'Neills. ==Tournament history== ===World Cup=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=9|World Cup record |- ! width=150 |Year ! width=100 |Round ! width=50 |Position ! width=50 |GP ! width=50 |W ! width=50 |L ! width=50 |T ! width=50 |NR |- | 1975||colspan=\"9\" rowspan=\"5\"|Not eligible |- | 1979 |- | 1983 |- | 1987 |- | 1992 |- | 1996||colspan=\"9\" rowspan=\"3\"|Did Not Qualify |- | 1999 |- | 2003 |- style=\"background:#f2f2f2;\" | 2007||Super 8||8/16||10||2||7||1||0 |- | 2011||rowspan=2|Group Stage||11/14||6||2||4||0||0 |- | 2015||9/14||6||3||3||0||0 |- | 2019 || colspan=\"7\" | Did Not Qualify |- | 2023|| colspan='9'|Yet to qualify |- !Total !colspan=\"2\"| !22 !7 !14 !1 !0 |} ===World Twenty20=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width=900px;\" |- !colspan=9|World Twenty20 record |- ! width=150 |Year ! width=100 |Round ! width=50 |Position ! width=50 |GP ! width=50 |W ! width=50 |L ! width=50 |T ! width=50 |NR |- | 2007 || colspan=\"7\" | Did not qualify |- | 2009 || Super 8 || 8/12 || 5 || 1 || 4 || 0 || 0 |- | 2010 || rowspan=4| Group stage || rowspan=2| 9/12 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 |- | 2012 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 |- | 2014 ||13/16 || 3 || 2 || 1 || 0 || 0 |- | 2016 ||15/16 || 3 || 0 || 2 || 0 || 1 |- | 2021|| colspan=\"7\" | Qualified |- | 2022 || colspan=\"7\" | TBD |- !Total !colspan=2|5/8 !15 !3 !9 !0 !3 |} ===Other tournaments=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" !
