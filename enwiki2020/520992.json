The vessel was laid down in 1958 and served as a front line warship with the Japan Maritime Self- Defense Force until 1986, and as an auxiliary until 1993. ==Design and construction== Teruzuki was one of two Akizuki-class destroyers ordered in 1957 by the United States for Japan as part of a military aid package. Although the two destroyers were paid for by the United States, and therefore had hull numbers under the US Navy designation scheme, with Teruzuki having the hull number DD-960, they were built in Japanese shipyards to local designs. The two destroyers were equipped as flotilla leaders, and had the same main gun armament of three American 5-inch (127 mm)/54 caliber guns as used in the previous , with four 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft guns in two twin mounts. Anti-submarine armament consisted of a Weapon Alpha anti-submarine rocket launcher, two Hedgehog anti-submarine projectors and two depth charge launchers. A single quadruple mount for torpedoes was fitted, with a single set of reload torpedoes. Teruzuki was laid down by Mitsubishi at Kobe in Japan on 15 August 1958, launched on 24 June 1959 and commissioned with the pennant number DD 162 on 29 February 1960. ==Operational history== Teruzuki was refitted between 1976 and 1977 to improve anti-submarine capabilities, with the SQS-29 hull sonar replaced by the larger and longer ranged SQS-23 system, while a variable-depth sonar (VDS) was added.Friedman 1997, pp. 629\u2013631. The obsolete Weapon Alpha launcher was replaced by a Bofors anti-submarine launcher, with the Hedgehog launchers replaced by two triple triple mounting for Mark 46 torpedoes.Moore 1985, p. 291. Teruzuki became an auxiliary in 1986, and a training ship on 1 July 1987, with torpedo tubes and the VDS removed. The ship was stricken in September 1993. ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:Akizuki-class destroyers (1959) Category:Ships built in Japan Category:1959 ships ",
