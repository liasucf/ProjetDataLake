The department was singled out for this distinction from a list of over 18,000 police agencies nationwide. ==Organizational Structure== MPD follows a paramilitary organizational structure headed by the Chief of Police. The Deputy Chief of Police reports directly to the Chief and oversees the three major operational divisions of the agency, each of which is led by an Assistant Chief: Field Operations Division, Criminal Investigations Division, and Administration Division. The Internal Affairs Section, Professional Compliance Section, and Public Information Office report directly to the Chief of Police. ==Districts== Miami is divided into three policing districts, which are in turn divided into thirteen neighborhoods: ;North District *Model City *Little Haiti *Upper Eastside ;Central District *Allapattah *Overtown *Wynwood *Edgewater *Downtown ;South District *Flagami *Little Havana *Coral Way *Coconut Grove *Brickell/Roads == Ranks and insignia == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Title !Insignia |- |Chief of Police |108px |- |Deputy Chief |81px |- |Assistant Chief |54px |- |Major |27px |- |Commander | |- |Executive Officer | 30px |- |Senior Sergeant-At-Arms | |- |Sergeant-At-Arms | |- |Captain |25px |- |Lieutenant |10px |- |Sergeant |35px |- |Police Officer | |} Rank insignias for sergeants are worn on the upper sleeves below the shoulder patch while rank insignias for lieutenant through chief are worn on the shirt collar. ==Demographics== The demographics of full-time sworn personnel are:Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics, 2000: Data for Individual State and Local Agencies with 100 or More Officers *Male: 82% *Female: 18% *Hispanic (of any race): 54% *African-American/Black: 27% *non- Hispanic White: 19% ==Officers who died in the line of duty== Since the establishment of the Miami Police Department, 37 officers have died in the line of duty. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Detectives are issued either the Glock Model 23 .40 or the more compact Glock Model 27 .40. Prior to issuing the semi-automatic Glock pistols MPD officers were issued .38 Special Smith and Wesson Model 64 and Smith and Wesson Model 67 while detectives had the Smith & Wesson Model 60 \"Chiefs Special\" revolver also in .38 Special. ==Controversy== ===Civil rights investigations by U.S. Department of Justice=== The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigated the Miami Police Department twice, once beginning in 2002 and once from 2011-2013.Findings Letter re: Investigation of City of Miami Police Department, U.S. Department of Justice (July 9, 2013). The investigation by DOJ's Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida that was completed in 2013 was prompted by a series of incidents over eight months in 2011 in which Miami officers fatally shot seven young black men. The DOJ investigation concluded that the Miami Police Department \"engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.\" The investigation reached many of the same conclusions as the 2002 investigation. It found that MPD officers had intentionally fired upon individuals on 33 occasions between 2008 and 2011, and that the MPD itself found that the shootings were unjustified on three occasions. The DOJ also determined that \"a number of MPD practices, including deficient tactics, improper actions by specialized units, as well as egregious delays and substantive deficiencies in deadly force investigations, contributed to the pattern or practice of excessive force.\" The DOJ found that MPD had failed to \"complete thorough, objective and timely investigations of officer-involved shootings\" and sometimes failed to reach a conclusion \"as to whether or not the officer's firearm discharge was lawful and within policy,\" which the DOJ cited as a factor that \"undermined accountability and exposed MPD officers and the community to unreasonable risks that might have been addressed through prompt corrective action.\" The DOJ also found that \"a small number of officers were involved in a disproportionate number of shootings, while the investigations into their shootings continued to be egregiously delayed.\" To address the issues it identified, the city negotiated a judicially overseen agreement with the DOJ. Former Chief Miguel A. Exposito rejected the DOJ findings, which he called flawed. A comprehensive settlement agreement between the DOJ and the City of Miami was reached in February 2016; under the agreement, the police department was obligated to take specific steps to reduce the number of officer-involved shootings (through enhanced training and supervision) and to \"more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur\" (through improvements to the internal investigation process and tighter rules for when an officer who shoots may return to work). Jane Castor, the former police chief of Tampa, Florida, was appointed as the independent monitor to oversee the city's compliance with the reforms. ===Controversy over shooting an unarmed suspect=== On December 10th, 2013 at approximately 0530 hours, 22 police officers surrounded a suspect from an earlier shooting (police officer shot by suspect) and a second uninvolved person. Police ordered the men to put their hands up and then fired over 50 rounds into the car. Witnesses reported police continued to order the men to raise their hands and when they did fired more rounds into the car. In total 22 police Officer fired more than 377 rounds hitting the car, other cars, adjacent buildings, their fellow police officers. The gunfire from the police was sufficient that some officers suffered ruptured eardrums. Witnesses reported that after killing the two men, some of the police were laughing.https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/05/23-police- officers-fire-377-bullets-at-2-men-with-0-guns/361904/ ===Controversy over speeding=== On October 11, 2011, MPD Officer Fausto Lopez was speeding to a moonlighting job at up to 120 mph when he was caught by a state trooper after a 7-minute chase, with the video going viral on YouTube. The state trooper initially believed that the MPD cruiser had been stolen, so Lopez was arrested at gunpoint and handcuffed. This started a feud between the Florida Highway Patrol and the MPD (who regarded the arrest as an overreaction), involving police blog accusations and insults, posters attacking the state trooper who stopped Lopez, and someone smearing feces on another trooper's patrol car. An investigation by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in February 2012 examined SunPass toll records and found that 800 cops from a dozen South Florida agencies drove their cruisers above 90 mph in 2011, mostly while off duty. As a result of the Sun-Sentinel report, 158 state troopers and officers were disciplined, mostly receiving a reprimand and losing their take-home cars for up to six months. Lopez, who was found to have driven 90 mph on more than 80 occasions, was suspended with pay in early July 2012 and terminated from the Miami Police on September 13, 2012. ===Controversy over shooting unarmed motorist=== On 11 February 2011 Miami Police killed an unarmed motorist during a traffic stop and wounded another person in the car. Prosecutors declined to prosecute as they did not think they could say it was provable beyond a reasonable doubt that Miami Officer Reynaldo Goyos could have thought the driver was reaching for a weapon.https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state-- regional/prosecutors-clear-miami-officer-shooting-unarmed- motorist/f7vnRSnESWLt2Rj5GOVRRO/ ===Controversial detainment of African American COVID-19 doctor=== In April 2020, a Miami Police Sergeant generated controversy by handcuffing and detaining African American doctor Armen Henderson, who was assigned to treat homeless people for COVID-19, outside his home after receiving complaints that people were dumping trash in the area where he was working.https://www.miamiherald.com/news/article241943371.htmlhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/police- chief-orders-probe-handcuffing-black-miami-doctor/story?id=70111116 Allegations soon surfaced that the matter in which Henderson was handcuffed and detained was in fact a case of racial profiling.https://newsone.com/3927778/dr-armen-henderson-coronavirus-racial- profiling-video/ The Miami Police Department eventually agreed to launch an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the handcuffing and detainment of Henderson.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/armen-henderson- arrested-homeless-coronavirus-testing.html ==See also== * List of U.S. state and local law enforcement agencies ==References== ===Sources=== * ==External links== * Miami Police Department (official website) Category:Government of Miami Category:Municipal police departments of Florida Category:1896 establishments in Florida ",
