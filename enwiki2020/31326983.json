ECBACC is an outgrowth of the \u201cBlack Age of Comics\u201d, a movement (ca. 1981\u2013present) and era (ca. 1990\u20131997) dedicated to people of African descent creating a plethora and range of Black (Pan-African/Africentric/Afrocentric/African- centered) characters in the U.S. comic book industry.

The ECBACC STARS Workshop (an acronym for Storytelling That Advances Reading Skills) is an ECBACC initiative designed to use comic book art and imagery as a vehicle to foster creativity and promote literacy, with a secondary focus on introducing participants to the various career options that exist within the comic book industry. ECBACC STARS participants learn what it is like to be comic book creators via the \u201cCreate Your Own Hero\u201d exercises while they put their imaginations to work as they pen their own stories for the characters they create. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, ECBACC now features a costume contest. == History == Originally slated to be called the Pan-African Comic Convention (PAC-Con) or First World Komix Con (1st World Con), and after over a decade of deliberations, networking and consortium-building (from 1990\u20132001), the first convention was held in Temple University's Ritter Hall, in the Walk Auditorium, on May 11, 2002.

A costumer who costumes as a character of Black or African descent is described as an Africozer or and Africosplayer. Side note: Some Black cosplayers have felt they had few options but to dress as White (European-descended) superheroes and science-fiction characters, or even as Asian or Manga-styled characters, although doing so afforded them very little positive feedback, little notoriety, and a great lack of support from cosplayers at-large. ==Similar conventions== Other ongoing conventions with an Afrocentric theme include Onyxcon (Atlanta, GA), Motor City Black Age of Comics (Detroit) and the Schomburg Center's Black Comic Book Festival (New York City). == See also == * Portrayal of black people in comics ==References== ==External links== * Category:Charities based in Pennsylvania Category:Comics conventions in the United States Category:Science fiction conventions in the United States Category:Recurring events established in 2002 Category:Culture of Philadelphia Category:Tourist attractions in Philadelphia Category:2002 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Conventions in Pennsylvania Category:African-American comics ",
