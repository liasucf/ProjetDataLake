As of , it has articles, registered users, files, and ranks 21st in terms of depth among Wikipedias. It is also the 50th largest edition of Wikipedia by article count. == History == Wikipedia started being multilingual in May 2001. , Wikipedia had approximately 9.25 million articles in 253 languages. The Urdu Wikipedia was created on January 27, 2004. At first, Urdu Wikipedia faced technical problems with the Urdu script font, but now this matter is mostly settled; some unsolved areas remain. Urdu is written in Perso-Arabic script, a right-to-left writing system. As a result, users sometimes need to configure their operating systems and web browsers accordingly. Currently Urdu Wikipedia uses \"Urdu Naskh Asiatype\" font, which was introduced and is freely distributed by BBC at BBC Urdu Service website. The font is primarily used for article bodies and headings. Urdu variation of Times New Roman is used for navigation links. Both of these fonts are variations of Naskh style. Some Pakistani variations of complex Nasta'liq script are also supported only as a secondary choice in class definitions of CSS, i.e. if default font is not found on client system, then Nasta'liq script is used. The translation of the Wikipedia interface and project information pages into Urdu is still in progress. Some pages about how to edit have been translated. ==Milestones== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
