    "text": "Albert Ferrer Llopis (; born 6 June 1970) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a right back, and a current coach. Having represented local Barcelona for almost a decade, he went on to appear for England's Chelsea until his retirement. During his spell in his country he was nicknamed Chapi, and appeared in a total of 221 La Liga matches over nine seasons. A Spanish international on more than 30 occasions, Ferrer represented the nation in two World Cups and at the 1992 Olympic Games, winning the latter tournament. He started working as a manager in 2010, with Vitesse. ==Playing career== ===Club=== ====Barcelona==== Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Ferrer was a pacy and tough-tackling defender. He began his senior career with FC Barcelona B, then served a loan with CD Tenerife in the 1989\u201390 season, with whom he made his La Liga debut at the age of 19. Ferrer returned to the first team the following summer and became first-choice right back, remaining as such the following eight years and scoring once in the league. He often partnered another youth graduate, Sergi Barju\u00e1n, in the defensive wings. Ferrer was a key member of the famous Dream Team and, during his time with the Blaugrana, won five leagues, a European Cup, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, two domestic cups, four Supercups and two UEFA Super Cups. As the Dutch dominance at the Camp Nou in terms of players was still an important one (the club was coached by Louis van Gaal), he left in June 1998 amongst other greats as Guillermo Amor. ====Chelsea==== In June 1998, Ferrer signed with Chelsea for \u00a32.2 million. He quickly established himself in the side, helping them qualify for their first ever Champions League in his debut campaign; his new club won the FA Cup the following year (but he missed the final through injury) and reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League; during the run in the latter he played in 14 of 16 games, and scored his only goal in a 2\u20130 win over Hertha BSC. A combination of injuries and manager Gianluca Vialli's squad rotation policy reduced Ferrer's opportunities in 2000\u201301, and he made only 14 league appearances. Chelsea reached another FA Cup final in 2002 \u2013 which he again missed, though this time through not being selected, despite playing in the semi-final against Fulham. Out of favour and facing strong competition from younger teammates he played just seven times in his final two years, and left in May 2003 upon the expiry of his contract, totalling 113 overall matches for the Londoners and retiring shortly after at 33. ===International=== Ferrer was a Spain international on 36 occasions. His debut came on 4 September 1991 in a friendly win with Uruguay in Oviedo, as La Roja eventually did not qualify for UEFA Euro 1992. Subsequently, Ferrer was a regular figure in the national side, appearing as starter at the 1994 FIFA World Cup and playing once in the 1998 edition, the 2\u20133 group stage loss against Nigeria, missing Euro 1996 and 2000 through injury (with Barcelona teammate Sergi on the other flank in all these tournaments). In 1992, Ferrer was first-choice for the Olympic team that won the gold medal at the Summer Olympics, held in his hometown. ==Coaching career== After retiring, Ferrer worked as a color commentator for a number of Spanish broadcasters. In late October 2010, he was announced as new head coach of SBV Vitesse in the Eredivisie, his staff also including compatriot Albert Capellas (formerly youth coach at Barcelona) and former Dutch goalkeeper Stanley Menzo, who left his post at SC Cambuur in order to join the Spaniards. Ferrer led the side to the 15th position, in a narrow escape from relegation. He was subsequently relieved of his duties, being replaced by John van den Brom. On 17 February 2014, Ferrer was appointed at Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club C\u00f3rdoba CF. After finishing the season in the seventh place, they defeated UD Las Palmas in the play-off final to return to the top flight for the first time in 42 years. Ferrer was fired on 20 October 2014, as C\u00f3rdoba ranked dead last with only four points in eight matches. On 20 June of the following year he was named RCD Mallorca manager, signing a one-year deal; after three wins from 15 second level games, he was dismissed on 30 November. On 29 August 2017, Ferrer returned to Barcelona as coach of its legends team. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"8\"|Record |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- |align=left|Vitesse | |align=left|27 October 2010 |align=left|30 June 2011 |- |align=left|C\u00f3rdoba | |align=left|17 February 2014 |align=left|20 October 2014 |- |align=left|Mallorca | |align=left|20 June 2015 |align=left|30 November 2015 |- !colspan=\"4\"|Total |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Barcelona *La Liga: 1990\u201391, 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393, 1993\u201394, 1997\u201398 *Copa del Rey: 1996\u201397, 1997\u201398 *Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996 *European Cup: 1991\u201392 *UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: 1996\u201397 *UEFA Super Cup: 1992, 1997 Chelsea *FA Cup: 1999\u20132000 *FA Community Shield: 2000 *UEFA Super Cup: 1998 ===International=== Spain *Summer Olympic Games: 1992 ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * Spain stats at Eu-Football Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Barcelona Category:Spanish footballers Category:Catalan footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:FC Barcelona C players Category:FC Barcelona B players Category:FC Barcelona players Category:CD Tenerife players Category:Premier League players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Spain under-21 international footballers Category:Spain under-23 international footballers Category:Spain international footballers Category:1994 FIFA World Cup players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:Olympic footballers of Spain Category:Footballers at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Spain Category:Olympic medalists in football Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Catalonia international footballers Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Spanish football managers Category:Eredivisie managers Category:SBV Vitesse managers Category:La Liga managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n managers Category:C\u00f3rdoba CF managers Category:RCD Mallorca managers Category:Spanish expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in the Netherlands Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in the Netherlands ",
