It typically erupts every 6\u201310 minutes. Its usual height is , although it can sometimes erupt up to high. ==Location== Strokkur belongs to the Haukadalur valley area, where various other geothermal feature such as mud pools, fumaroles and other geysers are located around it, such as the famous Geysir geyser, which lies only 160 feet to the north. ==History== Strokkur was first mentioned in 1789, after an earthquake helped to unblock the conduit of the geyser. Its activity fluctuated throughout the 19th century; in 1815 its height was estimated to have been as much as . It continued to erupt until the turn of the 20th century, when another earthquake blocked the conduit again. In 1963, upon the advice of the Geysir Committee, locals cleaned out the blocked conduit through the bottom of the basin, and the geyser has been regularly erupting ever since. ==Tourism== Strokkur and its surrounding areas regularly attract tourists hoping to see the geyser erupt, as it is one of a very few natural geysers to erupt frequently and reliably. ==Evolution of the eruption== Each frame is approximately 1/4 of a second apart, for a total of approximately two seconds: Strokkur, \u00c1rea geot\u00e9rmica de Geysir, Su\u00f0urland, Islandia, 2014-08-16, DD 083.JPG Strokkur, \u00c1rea geot\u00e9rmica de Geysir, Su\u00f0urland, Islandia, 2014-08-16, DD 084.JPG Strokkur, \u00c1rea geot\u00e9rmica de Geysir, Su\u00f0urland, Islandia, 2014-08-16, DD 085.JPG Strokkur, \u00c1rea geot\u00e9rmica de Geysir, Su\u00f0urland, Islandia, 2014-08-16, DD 086.JPG Strokkur, \u00c1rea geot\u00e9rmica de Geysir, Su\u00f0urland, Islandia, 2014-08-16, DD 087.JPG Strokkur, \u00c1rea geot\u00e9rmica de Geysir, Su\u00f0urland, Islandia, 2014-08-16, DD 088.JPG Strokkur, \u00c1rea geot\u00e9rmica de Geysir, Su\u00f0urland, Islandia, 2014-08-16, DD 089.JPG Strokkur, \u00c1rea geot\u00e9rmica de Geysir, Su\u00f0urland, Islandia, 2014-08-16, DD 090.JPG ==See also== * Geography of Iceland * Geology of Iceland * Iceland plume * List of volcanoes in Iceland * Volcanism in Iceland ==References== ==External links== * \u2013 A picture gallery * Information and photos of Strokkur * Movie clip that shows Strokkur erupting * virtual tour of Strokkur * Live webcam of the Geysir by Mila.is Category:Southern Region (Iceland) Category:Geysers of Iceland Category:Articles containing video clips ",
