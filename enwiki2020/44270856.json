    "text": "Marianna City Hall is located in the former Marianna National Guard Armory at 45 West Mississippi Street in Marianna, Arkansas. It is a large two-story brick building, with restrained Art Deco styling. It was designed by Durward F. Kyle, and built in 1929 with funding from the city and the state's Military Department, to house the regimental headquarters of the 206th Coastal Artillery Regiment. Over the following decades it was home to a number of Arkansas National Guard units, which moved to new facilities in 1980. The building was adapted in 1987 for use as city hall, and as a senior center. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Lee County, Arkansas ==References== Category:City and town halls on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Art Deco architecture in Arkansas Category:Government buildings completed in 1929 Category:Buildings and structures in Lee County, Arkansas Category:City halls in Arkansas Category:Armories on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Armories in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lee County, Arkansas ",
