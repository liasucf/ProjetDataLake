Aymanam is the setting for Arundhati Roy's 1997 novel The God of Small Things. ==Demographics== India census, Aimanam had a population of 34,985 with 17,268 males and 17,717 females. ==Etymology== Ay means \"five\" in and Vanam means \"forest\" in Malayalam. Hence, Aymanam means \"five forests\", which, according to tradition, were Vattakkadu, Thuruthikkadu, Vallyakadu, Moolakkadu and Mekkadu. They survive today only as \"snake groves\", where fertility idols, in the form of snakes, were worshiped under the trees. Families depute Brahmin once a year for ritualistic offering. ==Geography== Lake Vembanad lies to the west of the village, near Kumarakom, with the River Meenachil providing its water supply, which often floods from June to August due to regular monsoons. Consequently, two-thirds of the village are paddy fields. The borders of the village are mostly delineated by rivers or canals, and include the villages of Arpookara, Kumara Nallooru, Thiruvarpu and Kumarakom, and the municipality of Kottayam. == Notable residents == * Arundhati Roy - writer * Aymanam John - writer * N.N.
