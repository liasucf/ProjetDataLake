It competes in the Liga MX, the top division of Mexican football. Originally from Jasso, Hidalgo the club moved to Mexico City in 1971. Estadio Azteca, the nation's largest sports venue, served as their home venue until 1996, when they moved to the Estadio Azul. After 22 years the team returned to the Azteca at the conclusion of the 2017-18 Liga MX season. Its headquarters are in La Noria, a suburb within Xochimilco in the southern part of Mexico City.http://stadiumdb.com/news/2017/04/mexico_city_cruz_azul_to_relocate_to_azteca Cruz Azul has been the Primera Divisi\u00f3n champion eight times, trailing Toluca's 10, C.D. Guadalajara's 12, and Club Am\u00e9rica's 13. Cruz Azul's six titles makes it the second-most successful club in the history of the CONCACAF Champions League, the most prestigious international club competition in North American football, trailing intracity rival Club America. Cruz Azul was also the first CONCACAF team to reach the final of the Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious club competition in South American football (which invited top Liga MX clubs from 1998 to 2017), losing on penalties to Argentine football giants Boca Juniors in 2001. In the 1968\u201369 season, Cruz Azul was the first CONCACAF club (and third worldwide) to complete a rare Continental Treble, winning the Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n championship, the Copa M\u00e9xico national tournament, and the CONCACAF Champions League. The International Federation of Football History & Statistics, in its Club World Ranking for year ending December 31, 2014, places Cruz Azul as the 99th-best club in the world and the third-best club in CONCACAF. According to several polls published, Cruz Azul is the third-most popular team in Mexico, behind only C.D. Guadalajara and Club Am\u00e9rica. ==History== ===Foundation=== Winning multiple championships in the 1970s earned the nickname \"The Celeste Machine\", comparing it with a locomotive and referencing the light blue color often worn on the team's uniform. Cruz Azul was founded under the name Club Deportivo Cruz Azul as an amateur team on 22 March 1927. The founders were the workers of cement maker Cemento Cruz Azul; the team played in the town of Jasso (now part of the \"city cooperative\" Ciudad Cooperativa Cruz Azul) in the state of Hidalgo. Cemento Cruz Azul was the only official sponsor until 1997, and remains a primary sponsor today. Guillermo \u00c1lvarez Marcia and Carlos Garc\u00e9s were the main force behind the effort to organize the club, and the quick success of the team led to frequently representing the state of Hidalgo in national amateur tournaments. ===1927\u20131960=== From 1927 to 1960, the amateur team played many times in Mexico City against the reserve squads of established professional teams such as the Am\u00e9rica, the Necaxa, the Atlante F.C., the Asturias F.C. and the Club Deportivo Marte. The Cemento Cruz Azul changed its name to the \"Cooperativa Cruz Azul\", and in 1960 the consistent success of the team caused the new administration of the cement company to build the Estadio 10 de Diciembre in Jasso. The team entered professional competition in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico for the 1960\u201361 season. ===1960s\u20132000=== Hungarian coach Jorge Marik guided the team to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n championship for the 1963\u201364 season, elevating them to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n the following season. That season ended with an eighth-place finish. Four years later, the Cruz Azul won its first Primera Divisi\u00f3n league tournament, under coach Ra\u00fal C\u00e1rdenas. Between 1970\u20131980, the Cruz Azul led the Primera Divisi\u00f3n with six league tournament championships; four under C\u00e1rdenas and the last two under Ignacio Trelles. This powerful version of the team earned the nickname La M\u00e1quina Celeste (The Blue Machine), which continues as one of the unofficial nicknames of the team. The team earned its eighth and most recent championship in 1997 under coach Luis Fernando Tena, beating the Le\u00f3n 2\u20131 on a last minute penalty kick scored by Carlos Hermosillo. This was still the quickest a Primera Divisi\u00f3n club had ever won eight championships, achieving the feat within 33 years of entering the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. ===2000\u20132009=== ====Copa Libertadores 2001==== In 2001, the Cruz Azul was invited to a tournament between select Mexican and Venezuelan teams that would then compete in the Copa Libertadores, a tournament of the best South American teams. The two best teams of this qualifying tournament earned immediate placement on the roster. The Cruz Azul was one of the seeded teams and reached the 2001 Copa Libertadores final match. The Cruz Azul started the tournament in Group 7 along with teams such as the Sao Caetano, the Defensor Sporting, and Olmedo. The Cruz Azul finished as leader of the group with 13 points. In round 16 the Cruz Azul faced the Cerro Porte\u00f1o. The first leg was played in Asunci\u00f3n and the Cruz Azul lost 2\u20131. The second leg was played in Mexico and the Cruz Azul won the game 3\u20131. The aggregate score was 4\u20133 in favor of the Cruz Azul and they moved on to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals the Cruz Azul faced the CA River Plate of Argentina. The first leg of the match was played in Buenos Aires and ended in a 0\u20130 draw. The second leg was played in Mexico and the Cruz Azul won 3\u20130. The Cruz Azul was having a great run and played the Rosario Central in the semifinals. The first leg was played in Mexico and the Cruz Azul won the game 2\u20130. The second leg was played in Rosario in a very exciting match that ended in a 3\u20133 draw in favor of the Cruz Azul due to the 2\u20130 victory in the first leg. In the final match the Cruz Azul played against the Argentinian club the Boca Juniors. The Cruz Azul lost at home the first leg 1\u20130, but came back to win the second leg with the same score at the Boca's La Bombonera stadium with Paco Palencia scoring the goal. Until then, no team had ever won a Copa Libertadores final match there. After overtime the championship was decided by penalty kicks. The Boca Juniors prevailed. Still, the Cruz Azul surprised everybody with the unprecedented feat of reaching the final and defeating established Argentinian teams such as the Rosario Central and the CA River Plate. ====2006\u20132007==== In the 2006 Apertura, the team started off great but in the middle of the season, they had a hard time adding points on the board. The Cruz Azul recovered and finished the regular season as the points leader. They have not won a title since the championship they won against Leon in 1997. For the Apertura 2006, the Cruz Azul made it to the quarterfinals and faced the Chivas in the Estadio Jalisco. In the first leg, the Cruz Azul played a very poor game and lost 2\u20130. On November 25, 2006 the Cruz Azul played the second leg at Estadio Azul and played a brilliant game. The Cruz Azul started off strong and put the Chivas keeper Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez to the test on many occasions. In the middle of the first half, defender Salvador Carmona pushed a Chivas player in the penalty area and cost the Cruz Azul a penalty.Ram\u00f3n Morales had no problem and put the score 1\u20130 in favor of the Chivas in the 39th minute. The Cruz Azul kept creating opportunities and at the end of the first half, C\u00e9sar Delgado made a great play that Richard N\u00fa\u00f1ez finished with a goal to tie the game right before halftime in the 45th minute. In the second half, the Chivas scored thanks to Ram\u00f3n Morales again to put the score 2\u20131 in favor of the Chivas. The Cruz Azul did not give up and Miguel Sabah tied the game 2\u20132 in the 62nd minute. The Cruz Azul played a great game and ended up tying the game 2\u20132 but losing 4\u20132 on aggregate. In the 2007 Clausura the team had a great start, finishing among the first 8 teams in the league that went to playoffs. The team had a great quarterfinal series against the Tecos of the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Guadalajara, thanks to two magnificent goals from striker Richard N\u00fa\u00f1ez and moved to semifinals against the Pachuca FC, the top team in the league. The Pachuca beat the Cruz Azul in the Estadio Azul in the first leg of the series with a strong 3\u20131. The Cruz Azul still had a chance to overcome the adverse score, but on that same evening, the Court of Arbitration for Sport communicated that team captain Salvador Carmona was declared ineligible with immediate and lifetime effect, because of a repeated doping indiscipline that occurred back in January 2006. The sanction was dated May 18, 2007, the very day of the first match against the Pachuca. Arguing that player Salvador Carmona did play on that day for the Cruz Azul, the Mexican Football Federation, aka Federacion Mexicana de Futbol sanctioned the Cruz Azul by suspending the team one game from competition, under the argument of aligning an ineligible player. Many legal arguments have been raised by both the player's lawyer and the Cruz Azul, but the sanction stood and the Cruz Azul lost its opportunity to overcome the 3\u20131 and go to the final series against the America. The Cruz Azul had one of the best seasons of their victory against the Mexiel. ====Clausura 2008==== In the Clausura the team played a great tournament, finishing in second place. The team won 9 games, had 4 draws and lost only 4 times. In quarterfinals they played against the Jaguares losing 1\u20130 in the first leg and winning 2\u20131 in the second leg with goals of Pablo Zeballos and Miguel Sabah. They moved to semifinals against the San Luis, the first leg was played in San Luis and the Cruz Azul won 0\u20131 with a goal of Miguel Sabah. In the second leg, the Cruz Azul and the San Luis played a formidable match that ended 1\u20131 with goals of Eduardo Coudet and Pablo Zeballos. In the final, the Cruz Azul played against the Santos Laguna, second place in the tournament. The first leg ended 1\u20132 with a victory for the Santos, and in the second leg a 1\u20131 make Laguna team champions. ====Apertura 2008==== In the Apertura the team had a good tournament, finishing in 5th place on the Mexican league. The team won 7 games, drew 5 times and lost only 5 times. In the quarterfinals they played against the Pumas UNAM with a 0\u20130 scoreline in the first leg in the \"Estadio Azul\", and won 3\u20131 in the second leg, in the \"Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Universitario 1968\" leaving the Pumas on the way. They moved to semifinals against the Atlante, the first leg was played in Mexico City, and the Cruz Azul won 3\u20131. In the second leg, the Cruz Azul and the Atlante played a regular match in Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo, that ended 1\u20131, resulting in the Cruz Azul reaching the Final for the second consecutive time in 2008. In the final, the Cruz Azul played against the Toluca, both teams tied on winning Mexican titles (at that time with 8 each). The first leg played in Mexico City, and ended with a dramatic 0\u20132 with a victory for visitors, the Toluca, and in the second leg, which was played at \"Estadio Nemesio D\u00edez\". The Cruz Azul won 0\u20132, making the tie on aggregate \"2\u20132\", as the match was tied, they played \"extra time\" and the draw continued until going to the \"Penalty \u2013 Shoot out\", where the Toluca won 7\u20136 over the Cruz Azul, Alejandro Vela was the Cruz Azul \"villain\" because he failed the last \"penalty shoot-out\", another incident before the match went to \"extra time\", was a clear foul suffered by Villaluz on the Goal area, the Toluca player \"Jose Manuel Cruz Alta\" crashed with the Cruz Azul player, making him unconscious, but the referee didn't mark the foul even though the Cruz Azul player was knocked out, he didn't even take a red card on the Toluca player, (unfortunately the Cruz Azul had made his 3 substitutions, so they ended the match playing with only 10 players, an unfair situation, that interfered directly on the final result of the match) this made the Toluca team becoming champions winning their 9th Mexican title, becoming the 3rd most successful of Mexican title winning teams. (1.-America \"12 titles\", 2 . Guadalajara \"11 titles\", 3.-Toluca \"10 titles\", 4.-Cruz Azul \"8 titles\", .- Pumas UNAM \"6 titles\", 6.- Club Le\u00f3n 7 titles, Club Pachuca \"5 titles\"). ====Clausura 2009==== Running the team of the Cruz Azul before the game against the Atlante on 28 February 2009.

The Cruz Azul has a rich variety of nicknames over its history, listed chronologically: * Cementeros (cement workers): As a result of affiliation with the Cruz Azul Cement, the first name refers directly to the employees of the company, as the team originally was formed with them. Over the years, the concept is extended not only to those who worked in the cooperative, but the construction workers in general. * Liebres (hares): When the team was promoted to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n in the mid-1960s, the club played a fast and physical game. These characteristics, coupled with their mostly white uniforms, led fans to compare the players of those years with the hares which abound in the town. The nickname took hold, and an anthropomorphic hare is often used as a mascot and icon to represent the Cruz Azul. While some modern fans believe that the mascot is a rabbit, the club's board has officially declared that it is a hare. * La M\u00e1quina (the machine, the locomotive): This nickname is fed by several sources of inspiration. One is based on a railway that brought the cement from the Cruz Azul plant, in the former village of Jasso (south of Tula de Allende), to Mexico City. After moving to Mexico City, the Cruz Azul was the most dominant club in Mexico during the 1970s, reinforcing the nickname as a comparison to the image of a locomotive sweeping through their opponents. The name may have been borrowed from the similarly nicknamed River Plate club that motored through its opponents in the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n in the 1940s. It has been suggested that reporter Rugama Angel Fernandez was the first to publish an article with the name La M\u00e1quina for the Cruz Azul. The nickname has some variations, including The Celestial Machine, The Blue Machine and The Cement Machine. ==The Cheerleaders (Las Celestes)== The club has its official cheerleading club, which were included as part of the institution since 2004, since then, act as cheerleaders in the proceedings of the club in their home games before and at halftime. From its appearance of \"Las Celestes\" have formed part of the tradition of the club. And the only Mexican team that has as part of their group at their official cheerleaders. ==Popularity and rivalries== ===Popularity=== Since its inception the team was supported mainly by cement workers. After promotion to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n in the 1960s, more people began to follow the team. In the 1970s when the team managed six of their eight titles even more people joined the group of supporters of the team, until now that in this 21st century according to various surveys is the third team with the most supporters in Mexico, behind the Club Guadalajara and the Am\u00e9rica respectively, above the club UNAM.
