In the background, temples, villas, and palaces Olympia is receiving tribute from visiting monarchs and dignitaries in her palace. H\u00e9lios and Lilia, two Christians, are dragged in by a mob demanding they be put to death. The proconsul Nicanor, Olympia's brother, thinks this is a good idea, but Olympia, much struck by H\u00e9lios' good looks, declines to do so and sends everyone else away. Alone with H\u00e9lios, she gives him a magic potion and seduces him. An earthquake shakes the ground and the prophet Magnus appears, warning of a forthcoming catastrophe. ===Act 2=== A remote, uninhabited location in a valley on the outskirts of the city. On the right, a small hill with rocks, broken columns and ruins. A cross is at the top of the hill, which Christians use as a place of worship. The sun is setting Just as Olympia was immediately taken with H\u00e9lios, her brother Nicanor was instantly enamoured of Lilia, and has tracked her down to the Christians' meeting place to try to seduce her. Lilia is not interested however and rejects him. She does not believe him when he claims to have converted to Christianity. Her rejection infuriates Nicanor and he denies that her God exists. He is immediately struck dead by lightning and Lilia swoons away. Satan himself arrives, declaring his enjoyment of inflicting suffering and agony on all humanity. He decides to let Lilia know that her sweetheart H\u00e9lios has been unfaithful to her, and when the girl regains consciousness, shows her a vision of H\u00e9lios and Olympia making love. Satan gathers up Nicanor's cloak and disguises himself as Olympia's brother. ===Act 3=== The gardens of the queen. Behind a hill on the right, a temple dedicated to Hercules.On the left, a view across the bay to the city of Naples. A triumphal arch in the centre H\u00e9lios yields to the blandishments of the Queen. Festivities and dances ensue, but Lilia arrives in the middle of them to claim H\u00e9lios as hers. Olympia tells H\u00e9lios that if he does not marry her and rule with her as her consort, she will have Lilia executed. Satan, in his guise as Nicanor, advises Olympia that it would make Lilia suffer more to live and witness H\u00e9lios' marriage to her. In order to save Lilia's life, H\u00e9lios agrees to wed Olympia, to Satan's delight. ===Act 4=== John Martin The grand hall of Queen Olympia's magnificent palace, richly ornamented with decorations in the Etruscan style Tremors repeatedly shake the ground. Satan summons the slaves of the queen and encourages them to revolt. The earthquake grows more and more intense, storms and lightning appear in the skies and all around buildings start to collapse. The palace terrace, which is supported by Doric columns, on one side a facade with Caryatids, on the other a facade with Corinthian columns. On the left, a road lined with sphinxes leads to a temple dedicated to Isis. In the background, an aqueduct with two levels of arches leads to the slopes of Mount Vesuvius H\u00e9lios appears on the terrace and calls Lilia's name, as all around structures fall to the ground. Lilia comes to him and pardons him for his betrayal of her with Olympia. In the background Mount Vesuvius is erupting. Satan reveals to Olympia that he is not really her brother, but the devil. The volcano explodes, spewing wave after wave of rocks, ashes and lava, destroying all the buildings and annihilating the assembled populace and the entire cast. The Christians are not sorry to die as they are assured of salvation. ==Reception and performance history== The four leading roles were taken at the premiere by stars of the day, and celebrated ballerina Emma Livry appeared in the ballet in act three, earning encomiums from contemporary critics.
