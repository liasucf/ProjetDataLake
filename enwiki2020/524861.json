    "text": "The voiced velar approximant is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `M\\`. The consonant is not present in English, but approximates to the sound of a 'g' with the throat kept open. The voiced velar approximant can in many cases be considered the semivocalic counterpart of the close back unrounded vowel . The two are almost identical featurally. and with the non-syllabic diacritic are used in different transcription systems to represent the same sound. In some languages, such as Spanish, the voiced velar approximant appears as an allophone of \u2013 see below. Some languages have the voiced pre-velar approximant,Instead of \"pre-velar\", it can be called \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\", \"front-velar\", \"palato-velar\", \"post-palatal\", \"retracted palatal\" or \"backed palatal\". which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical voiced velar approximant, though not as front as the prototypical palatal approximant. The symbol for the velar approximant originates from , but with a vertical line. Compare and for the labio-palatal approximant. ==Features== Features of the voiced velar approximant: The most common type of this approximant is glide or semivowel. The term glide emphasizes the characteristic of movement (or 'glide') of from the vowel position to a following vowel position. The term semivowel emphasizes that, although the sound is vocalic in nature, it is not 'syllabic' (it does not form the nucleus of a syllable).

Examples of such languages are Catalan, Galician and Spanish, in which the unspecified for rounding voiced velar approximant consonant (not semivowel) appears as an allophone of . Eugenio Mart\u00ednez Celdr\u00e1n describes the voiced velar approximant consonant as follows: There is a parallel problem with transcribing the palatal approximant. The symbol may also be used when the voiced velar approximant is merely an allophone of the voiced velar fricative as, compared with , it is more similar to the symbol . The X-SAMPA equivalent of is `G_o`. The symbol may not display properly in all browsers. In that case, should be substituted. In broader transcriptions,See e.g. . the lowering diacritic may be omitted altogether, so that the symbol is rendered , i.e. as if it represented the corresponding fricative. ==See also== * Index of phonetics articles ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * . *. * * * * * * ==External links== * Category:Velar consonants Category:Pulmonic consonants Category:Voiced oral consonants Category:Central consonants ",
