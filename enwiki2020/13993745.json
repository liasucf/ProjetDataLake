    "text": "The former Roman Catholic Diocese of Lombez (or Lomb\u00e8s) existed, with see at Lombez in the present department of Gers in Gascony, from 1317 to the Napoleonic reshuffle after the French Revolution. == History == Cathedral Sainte Marie at Lombez. * Tradition holds the region around Ancient Lumbarium was evangelized by Saint Maiano in the sixth-seventh centuries; the chapel built on his tomb would have been the start of modern Lombez. * In the late eight century a Benedictine abbey was established, dedicated to Notre-Dame, which in 1125 was ceded to the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine. * The bishopric was established on 1317.08.16 as Diocese of Lombez / Lomberien(sis) (Latin adjective), receiving its territory from its Metropolitan, the Archdiocese of Toulouse; the last abbot was appointed its first bishop. It bordered the Diocese of Montauban (north), Archdiocese of Toulouse (east), Diocese of Rieux and Diocese of Comminges (both south), Archdiocese of Auch and Diocese of Lectoure (both west). * Its see, Lombez Cathedral, was built from the fourteenth century, when the former abbey church of Saint Mary was remodeled, and consecrated in 1770. In 1771 it comprised 99 parishes. * In 1790 its cathedral was decommissioned, the see was abolished (against canon law) by the revolutionary republican authorities in favor of a short-lived Constitutional bishopric for the department : Diocese of Gers with seat at the capital Auch. * It was formally restored but now canonically suppressed on 29 November 1801 after the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801, by Pope Pius VII's papal bulla Qui Christi Domini, its territory being divided between the diocese of Bayonne and the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Toulouse. * On 29 June 1908, its now-honorary title was united, simultaneously with the titles of the former Diocese of Condom and Diocese of Lectoure, with the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Auch When the Archdiocese of Auch was restored in 1822, it acquired most of Lombez's former territory. == Episcopal Ordinaries == ;Suffragan Bishops of Lombez * Arnaud-Roger de Comminges, Augustinians (O.E.S.A.)
