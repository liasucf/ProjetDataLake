    "text": "Heliotropium foertherianum is a species of flowering plant in the borage family, Boraginaceae. It is native to tropical Asia including southern China, Madagascar, northern Australia, and most of the atolls and high islands of Micronesia and Polynesia. Common names include velvetleaf soldierbush, tree heliotrope, veloutier, and octopus bush. It is a shrub or small tree typical of littoral zones reaching a height of , with a spread of about . ==Taxonomy== Originally published as Tournefortia argentea, it was transferred to Argusia argentea, and remained under that name until recently. It was subsequently restored to Tournefortia before being transferred into Heliotropium under a new name in 2003. ==Uses== thumb Flower Historically in the Maldives the leaves were often used as famine food.Eating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture ===Wood=== The wood of H. foertherianum is commonly used to make handicrafts, tools, and, in Polynesia, frames for swim goggles. Due to its availability, H. foertherianum is used as firewood, and has become rare in some areas as a result. ===Medicinal=== Octopus bush is used in many Pacific islands as a traditional medicine to treat ciguatera fish poisoning, which is caused by powerful ciguatoxins produced by microscopic Gambierdiscus algae. Scientists from the Institute of Research for Development (IRD) and the Louis Malarde Institute in French Polynesia and Pasteur Institute in New Caledonia are researching the plant chemistry and believe that senescent leaves contain rosmarinic acid and derivatives, which are known for its antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. The researchers think that rosmarinic acid removes the ciguatoxins from their sites of action, as well as being an anti- inflammatory agent. ==References== ==External links== * * Plants of Midway Atoll foertherianum Category:Australasian realm flora Category:Indomalayan realm flora Category:Oceanian realm flora Category:Flora of the Western Indian Ocean Category:Flora of Malesia Category:Flora of the Pacific Category:Flora of Vietnam Category:Trees of Australia Category:Flora of India (region) Category:Flora of Ashmore and Cartier Islands Category:Flora of Christmas Island Category:Flora of the Coral Sea Islands Territory Category:Flora of the Maldives Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of the Tubuai Islands Category:Lamiales of Australia Category:Eudicots of Western Australia Category:Least concern plants Category:Least concern flora of Oceania Category:Least concern biota of Asia Category:Least concern flora of Australia Category:Least concern biota of Queensland Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
