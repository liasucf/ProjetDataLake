    "text": "The Anchorage Symphony Orchestra (ASO) is a professional symphony orchestra located in Anchorage, Alaska. Randall Craig Fleischer was the director and conductor, and Linn Weeda is the assistant director and conductor. The Anchorage Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1946, more than a decade before Alaska became a state, by a consortium of like-minded musicians looking for a musical outlet. Their first program collaborated with the Anchorage Little Theatre for a production of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. From their original size of 17, the ASO grew through the 1950s, hiring Peter Britch as conductor, and increasing to 32 members. Anchorage, however, continued to grow with the development of the City of Anchorage as the North Slope oil fields grew and with the continued military presence of Elmendorf Air Force Base, the ASO by the 1980s crossed the threshold as a semi-professional ensemble. Today the organization boasts of an endowment, a board of directors, and 80 audition-entranced musicians in its ranks. In 2001, the symphony garnered the Mayor's Arts Award for an Outstanding Arts Organization and the Governor's Arts Award for an Outstanding Arts Organization. The Anchorage Symphony performs in the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Anchorage. Music educator Lorene Harrison worked with the ASO among other area arts organizations. ==See also== *Anchorage Youth Symphony *Juneau Symphony *Music of Alaska ==References== ==External links== * Category:American orchestras Category:Musical groups established in 1946 Category:Tourist attractions in Anchorage, Alaska Category:1946 establishments in Alaska Category:Orchestras based in Alaska Category:Film scores Category:Video game musicians Category:Native American musical groups Category:Musical groups from Anchorage, Alaska ",
