Dur\u00e1n's first defense of his newly won title was put on hold when it was announced two weeks after his victory that he would be moving up to the middleweight division to challenge Marvin Hagler for Hagler's undisputed middleweight crown.Hagler to Fight Duran, NY Times article, 1983-06-29, Retrieved on 2020-04-23 After losing a close unanimous decision to Hagler in November, Dur\u00e1n would opt to return to the super welterweight. Dur\u00e1n was scheduled to make a mandatory defense against the WBA's number-one ranked contender Mike McCallum with promoter Dan Duva negotiating with both fighters in February 1984.Top-ranked junior middleweight Mike McCallum and lightweight Livingstone Bramble..., UPI article, 1984-02-23, Retrieved on 2020-04-23 However, in a press conference the following month, Dur\u00e1n announced that he would instead face WBC super welterweight titlist Thomas Hearns and that he would vacate his title if the WBA would not grant an extension that would allow him to make his mandatory defense after his fight with Hearns rather than before.Roberto Duran, who battled back from boxing oblivion to..., UPI article, 1984-03-20, Retrieved on 2020-04-23 After the WBA refused an extension, Dur\u00e1n announced in early May that he would indeed vacate the title and move forward with his fight against Hearns.Title Vacated, NY Times article, 1984-05-04, Retrieved on 2020-04-23 The bout was originally scheduled to take place in The Bahamas, but when the site proved incompatible due to both logistical and financial issues, it was instead moved to Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip.Hearns-Duran Shifted, NY Times article, 1984-05-22, Retrieved on 2020-04-25 Caesars Palace had become available when a heavyweight title bout between Larry Holmes and Gerrie Coetzee scheduled for June 8 was cancelled by the site due to breach of contract three weeks before it was to take place.Holmes-Coetzee Fight is Off, NY Times article, 1984-05-16, Retrieved on 2020-04-25 ==The fight== The fight was lopsided in Hearns' favor as he dominated Dur\u00e1n en route to a second-round knockout victory. Hearns had both a 5\u00bd-inch height advantage and 11-inch reach advantage which caused problems for Dur\u00e1n as he struggled to get inside on his larger opponent as Hearns kept him at bey with his left jab. With a minute left Dur\u00e1n tried to attack Hearns with a body shot, but Hearns countered with a left hook that opened a cut above Dur\u00e1n's eye. 30 seconds later Hearns sent Dur\u00e1n down after catching him flush with a hard right hand. After getting back up and taking the referee's standing-eight count Dur\u00e1n was allowed to continue but Hearns swarmed Dur\u00e1n with a series of rights and lefts before knocking him down again with an uppercut to the body with only seconds remaining though Dur\u00e1n would again get back and answer the referee's eight-count as the round came to an end. After the bell rang, a dazed Dur\u00e1n wandered to a neutral corner causing one of his corner-men to grab him and lead him back to his own. In round two, Hearns would back Dur\u00e1n into the ropes and tee off with a series of combinations as Dur\u00e1n desperately tried to fight back. Then with just as the first minute of the round came to an end, Hearns landed a devastating right to Dur\u00e1n's jaw that sent Dur\u00e1n down face-first on the canvas. The referee would stop the fight immediately, giving Hearns a technical knockout victory at 1:07 of the round.There Was No Doubting Thomas, Sports Illustrated article, 1984-06-25, Retrieved on 2020-04-25 ==Fight card== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" |- ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Weight Class ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Weight ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| vs. ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text- align:center;\"| ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Method ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Round ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Notes |- |Super Welterweight |154 lb |Thomas Hearns (c) |def. |Roberto Dur\u00e1n |align=center|TKO |align=center|12/12 | |- |Lightweight |135 lb |Jimmy Paul |def. |Alvin Hayes |align=center|KO |align=center|6/12 |- |Heavyweight |200+ lb |Tony Tucker |def. |Eddie L\u00f3pez |align=center|KO |align=center|9/10 |- |Middleweight |160 lb |Duane Thomas |def. |Tony Harrison |align=center|TKO |align=center|8/10 |- |Super Middleweight |168 lb |Errol Christie |def. |Stan White |align=center|KO |align=center|5/10 |- |Super Lightweight |140 lb |Arturo Frias |def. |Jose Torres |align=center|UD |align=center|10/10 |- |Flyweight |112 lb |Joey Olivo |def. |Oscar Cristerna |align=center|TKO |align=center|6/10 |- |Super Featherweight |130 lb |Louie Espinoza |def. |Dwight Pratchett |align=center|UD |align=center|8/8 |} ==References== Category:1984 in boxing Category:Boxing in Las Vegas Category:Boxing matches Category:Caesars Palace Category:June 1984 sports events in the United States ",
