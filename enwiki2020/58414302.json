    "text": "Aoria is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. Members of the genus are distributed in East and Southeast Asia. Food plants are known for only a few species, all of which were recorded from Vitaceae. Four genera similar to Aoria are known: Aloria, Enneaoria, Osnaparis and Pseudaoria. Osnaparis is regarded as a subgenus of Aoria by some researchers. In a revision of the genus Aoria in 2012, L. N. Medvedev included both Osnaparis and Pseudaoria as subgenera of Aoria, and treated Enneaoria as a synonym of Aloria. ==Species== Subgenus Aoria Baly, 1863 * Aoria annulipes Pic, 1935 * Aoria antennata Chen, 1940 * Aoria atra Pic, 1923 * Aoria bicoloripes Pic, 1935 * Aoria bowringi (Baly, 1860) ** Aoria bowringi bowringi (Baly, 1860) ** Aoria bowringi larvata Gressitt & Kimoto, 1961 * Aoria brancuccii Medvedev, 2012 * Aoria carinata Tan, 1993 * Aoria costata Tan, 1992 * Aoria cuprea Medvedev, 2012 * Aoria cyanea Chen, 1940 * Aoria fulva Medvedev, 2012 * Aoria gracilicornis Chen, 1940 * Aoria heinzi Medvedev, 2012 * Aoria humeralis Medvedev, 2019 * Aoria marginipennis Medvedev, 2012 * Aoria martensi Medvedev, 2012 * Aoria nepalica Medvedev & Sprecher-Uebersax, 1997 * Aoria nigripennis Gressitt & Kimoto, 1961 * Aoria nigripes (Baly, 1860) * Aoria nigromarginata Medvedev, 2012 * Aoria panfilovi Medvedev, 2012 * Aoria rufotestacea Fairmaire, 1889 * Aoria scutellaris Pic, 1923 ** Aoria scutellaris rufipennis Pic, 1923 ** Aoria scutellaris scutellaris Pic, 1923 * Aoria semicostata Jacoby, 1892 * Aoria thibetana Pic, 1928 * Aoria vietnamica Medvedev, 2012 Subgenus Osnaparis Fairmaire, 1889 (sometimes considered a separate genus) * Aoria laosica Medvedev, 2012 * Aoria lushuiensis Tan, 1992 * Aoria montana Tan, 1992 * Aoria nucea (Fairmaire, 1889) * Aoria pallidipennis Pic, 1928 Subgenus Pseudaoria Jacoby, 1908 (sometimes considered a separate genus) * Aoria burmanica (Jacoby, 1908) * Aoria coerulea (Jacoby, 1908) * Aoria floccosa (Tan, 1992) * Aoria irregulare (Tan, 1992) * Aoria petri (Warcha\u0142owski, 2010) * Aoria rufina (Gressitt & Kimoto, 1961) * Aoria yunnana (Tan, 1992) ==References== Category:Eumolpinae Category:Chrysomelidae genera Category:Taxa named by Joseph Sugar Baly Category:Beetles of Asia ",
