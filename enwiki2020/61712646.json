    "text": "Kona is an adventure video game developed by Canadian studio Parabole and published by Ravenscourt. Set in the 1970s, the game centers around Carl Faubert, a private investigator, who arrives at a snowy town in Nord-du- Qu\u00e9bec, only to find the place deserted with something that's lurking around. ==Gameplay== Kona includes survival and supernatural elements with buildings to explore, which contain loot (tools, light) and can serve as shelters. Some of the threats include cold (solved by setting up fire) and wolves (which will turn away in case they get a raw meat). There is a stress level, which increases by seeing upsetting scenes, dealing with tough situations, or getting into accidents. Having a higher stress level will decrease the sprint speed and add a shakier aim, but Carl can calm himself down by smoking cigarettes and drinking beers that are spread around. The navigation of the region is done by Carl\u2019s truck in a first-person viewpoint. While driving, Carl can hold the zoomable map in his right hand in case something needs to be checked. The game has Carl's thoughts being narrated as he goes through clues to find out what has happened to the town, along with puzzles that support the story. ==Development== Kona was developed by Canadian-based company Parabole. Initial funding for the game came through a crowdfunding campaign on the website Kickstarter. The campaign was launched on August 7, 2014 with a goal of CA$40,000; it ended on September 6, 2014 with CA$44,271 raised by 1,304 people. Lead developer Alexandre Fiset later said the funding from Kickstarter would have produced a five-minute game. Later funding for the game came from the Canada Media Fund, which accounted for roughly half. It was released on Steam Early Access in March 2016, later released a year later. ==Reception== On its release, Kona was met with \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics on Metacritic, with an aggregate score of 73% for Microsoft Windows, 71% for PlayStation 4, and 63% for Nintendo Switch. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:2017 video games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Adventure games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games set in Canada Category:Stadia games ",
