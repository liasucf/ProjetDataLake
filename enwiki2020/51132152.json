    "text": "Breeze from the East is a 1963 album by vibraphonist Cal Tjader, arranged by Stan Applebaum. The album features jazzy lounge music with a quasi-Asian sound. ==Reception== Stephen Cook reviewed the album for Allmusic and described the album as combining \"the vibist's [Tjader's] Latin lounge style with kitschy Asian touches\" describing the songs \"Sake and Greens,\" \"Cha,\" and \"Shoji\" as sounding like \"'60s-era James Bond on a wild chase through the heart of Tokyo\". Cook concluded by feeling that \"The ultra-smooth Latin jazz sound Tjader favored has always been more infectious than demanding and Breeze from the East's commercialized mod/eastern elements only end up expanding the pop exotica mix\". == Track listing == # \"Sake and Greens\" (Stan Applebaum) \u2013 2:24 # \"Cha\" (Applebaum) \u2013 3:03 # \"Leyte\" (Cal Tjader, Lonnie Hewitt) \u2013 3:00 # \"Shoji\" (Applebaum) \u2013 2:33 # \"China Nights\" (Nobuyuki Takeoka, Sedores, Yaso Saijo) \u2013 2:28 # \"Fuji\" (Tjader) \u2013 2:23 # \"Black Orchid\" (Tjader) \u2013 3:04 # \"Theme from Burke's Law\" (Herschel Burke Gilbert) \u2013 2:37 # \"Stardust\" (Hoagy Carmichael, Mitchell Parish) \u2013 2:45 # \"Poinciana\" (Buddy Bernier, Nat Simon) \u2013 3:23 # \"East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)\" (Brooks Bowman) \u2013 2:23 == Personnel == *Cal Tjader \u2013 vibraphone *Stan Applebaum \u2013 arranger, celesta *George Duvivier \u2013 double bass *Jerry Dodgion \u2013 flute *Dick Hyman \u2013 electronic organ *Lonnie Hewitt \u2013 piano *Willie Bobo \u2013 percussion *Johnny Rae \u2013 drums ;Production *John Murello \u2013 cover design *Phil Ramone \u2013 engineer *Val Valentin \u2013 director of engineering *Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins, Jack Maher \u2013 liner notes *Creed Taylor \u2013 producer ==References== Category:1963 albums Category:Cal Tjader albums Category:Verve Records albums ",
