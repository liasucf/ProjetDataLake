A cross sea (also referred to as a squared sea or square waves) is a sea state of wind- generated ocean waves that form nonparallel wave systems. Cross seas have a large amount of directional spreading. This may occur when water waves from one weather system continue despite a shift in wind. Waves generated by the new wind run at an angle to the old. Two weather systems that are far from each other may create a cross sea when the waves from the systems meet at a place far from either weather system. Until the older waves have dissipated, they can present a perilous sea hazard. This sea state is fairly common and a large percentage of ship accidents have been found to occur in this state. Vessels fare better against large waves when perpendicular to the waves. In a cross sea, vessels are more likely to be struck in a dangerous way. A cross swell is generated when the wave systems are longer-period swells, rather than short-period wind-generated waves. ==See also== * \u00cele de R\u00e9 * Rip current and rip tide * ==References== Category:Water waves Category:Oceanography ",
