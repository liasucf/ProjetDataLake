Good Morning America reported that the company has made more than 5,000 products, putting them \"in the same league as toy titans Mattel and LEGO.\" ==History== The private company was founded in 1988 when the co-founders left corporate careers to start their own company. Three of their four parents were educators, so they were drawn to doing something involving children. Later on, Melissa and Doug Bernstein made three short films for home video under the \"Lights, Camera, Interaction!\" banner and under the name \"Special Friends\", all of these films starring 12-year-old Brett Ambler: \"You On Kazoo!\" (1989), which promoted a Kazoo toy; \"Let's Sing-Along\" (1990), which promoted a microphone toy; and \"Ring-Along, Sing-Along\" (1991), promoting a bell-ringing toy. The videotapes were marketed directly to small, independent toy stores, but did not sell well. However, these three short films would become famous in the 2010s, when \"You on Kazoo!\" was uploaded to YouTube, and became a viral meme, thanks to the kazoo scenes, as \"The Kazoo Kid\" would later become the official nickname for its star, Brett Ambler. The video was remixed by Mike Diva in February 2016, and sampled by Florian Rehn Olsson in his SoundCloud song \"dootdoot\". The first product that brought them attention was the Fuzzy Farm Puzzle, a wooden puzzle with texture. An extensive line of wooden puzzles followed. In the late 1990s, the company expanded into wooden toys, arts & crafts, pretend play, plush toys, and more. The company was fined $1,386 on November 15, 2012, by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for hiring unlawful employees.Wilton toy company, Melissa & Doug fined for hiring unlawful employees - Thehour.com: News In 2016, Melissa Bernstein told Good Morning America that she thinks that imaginary play helps children explore, create, take risks, and discover who they really are.
