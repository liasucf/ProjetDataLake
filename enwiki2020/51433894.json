    "text": "A Place in the World is the third studio album by Australian rock band The Black Sorrows. The album was released in November 1985. All tracks were written by band members Joe Camilleri and Nick Smith, except \"Let the Four Winds Blow\". ==Review== The Canberra Times Debbie Cameron noted the album was, \"a cocktail of styles \u2014 from a strong piano accordion and calypso sound in \"A Place in the World\", to good dancing in \"Country Girls\", through a rocky but unremarkable \"The Final Touch\" and to a tragic \"Sons of the Sea\"\". Although Cameron preferred Sonola, she found A Place in the World had \"the action, the beat and the melody of Ry Cooder\". == Track listing == ; CD track listing ==Credits== *Accordion \u2013 George Butrumlis *Bass \u2013 Joe Creighton *Cover \u2013 Richard Lewis *Drums, washboard \u2013 Peter Luscombe *Engineer \u2013 Gary Constable *Guitar \u2013 Jeff Burstin, Ross Hannaford, Andrew Pendlebury *Harmony vocals \u2013 Nick Smith, The Blackberries *Illustration \u2013 Jenny Aitken *Lap steel guitar \u2013 Ed Bates *Violin \u2013 Steve McTaggart, Danny Bourke ==References== ==External links== * \"A Place in the World\" at discogs.com Category:1985 albums Category:The Black Sorrows albums Category:Albums produced by Joe Camilleri ",
