In the opening scene of Hitting the Fan, Diane reveals it to Will, and he angrily confronts Alicia about the situation. Hence, Alicia is fired along with all fourth year associates and a frantic pursuit of clients begins. Lockhart/Gardner imposes a restraining order on the new firm, preventing them from lobbying their biggest client, Chum-Hum. Florrick/Agos responds in kind as the two firms battle each other in and out of court, while relationships crumble. Meanwhile, Peter, after hearing of his wife's firing, helps Alicia secure a client and rescinds Diane's Illinois Supreme Court Justice nomination. ==Reception== Hitting the Fan received critical acclaim from critics, with some ranking it among their best episodes, but with a few noting it works best for those who had closely followed the show.
