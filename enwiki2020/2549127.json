    "text": "Professor Johann Georg B\u00fchler (July 19, 1837 \u2013 April 8, 1898) was a scholar of ancient Indian languages and law. ==Early life and education== B\u00fchler was born to Rev. Johann G. B\u00fchler in Borstel, Hanover, attended grammar school in Hanover, where he mastered Greek and Latin, then university as a student of theology and philosophy at G\u00f6ttingen, where he studied classical philology, Sanskrit, Zend, Persian, Armenian, and Arabic. In 1858 he received his doctorate in eastern languages and archaeology; his thesis explored the suffix -t\u00eas in Greek grammar. That same year he went to Paris to study Sanskrit manuscripts, and in 1859 onwards to London, where he remained until October 1862. This time was used mainly for the study of the Vedic manuscripts at the India Office and the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. While in England, B\u00fchler was first a private teacher and later (from May 1861) assistant to the Queen's librarian in Windsor Castle. ==Academic career== In Fall 1862 B\u00fchler was appointed assistant at the G\u00f6ttingen library; he moved there in October. While settling in, he received an invitation via Prof. Max M\u00fcller to join the Benares Sanskrit College in India. Before this could be settled, he also received (again via Prof. M\u00fcller) an offer of Professor of Oriental Languages at the Elphinstone College, Bombay (now Mumbai). B\u00fchler responded immediately and arrived on February 10, 1863 in Bombay. Noted Sanskrit and legal scholar Kashinath Trimbak Telang was then a student at the college. In the next year B\u00fchler became a Fellow of Bombay University and member of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. He was to remain in India until 1880. During this time he collected a remarkable number of texts for the Indian government and the libraries of Berlin, Cambridge University, and Oxford University. In the year 1878 he published his translations of the Paiyalachchhi, the oldest Prakrit dictionary, with glossary and translation. He also took responsibility for the translation of the Apastamba, Dharmasutra etc. in Professor Max M\u00fcller's monumental compilation and translation, the Sacred Books of the East, vols. 2, 14, and 25. On 8 April 1898 B\u00fchler drowned in Lake Constance, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Contemporary accounts mostly attributed it to an accident, but it has been speculated that it was a suicide motivated by B\u00fchler's connections to a scandal involving his former student Alois Anton F\u00fchrer. ==Selected publications== * Prakrit dictionary Paiyalacchinamamala (\"Beitr\u00e4ge zur kunde der indogermanischen sprachen\", G\u00f6ttingen 1878) * Erkl\u00e4rung der Ashokainschriften (\"Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl\u00e4ndischen gesellschaft\", 1883\u20131893) * The roots of the Dhatupatha not found in literature (\"Wiener zeitschrift f\u00fcr die kunde des morgenlandes\", 1894) * On the origin of the Kharosthi alphabet (ibid. 1895) * Digest of Hindu law cases (1867\u20131869; 1883) * Panchatantra with English notes (\"The Bombay sanscrit series\", 1868; 1891) * Apastambiya Dharmasutra (1868\u20131871; 1892\u20131894) * Catalogue of Sanskrit manuscripts from Gujarat (4 vol., 1871\u20131873) * Dachakumaracharita, with English notes (\"Sanscrit series\" no. 10, 1873, 1887; II, with P.
