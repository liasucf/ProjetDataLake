The existence of the TNO was discovered on 16 March 2013 at Cerro Tololo Observatory, La Serena and revealed on 30 August 2016. is the first high semi-major axis, high perihelion extreme trans- Neptunian object that is anti-aligned with the other known extreme trans- Neptunian objects such as Sedna and , i.e. its longitude of perihelion differs by 180\u00b0 from other objects. The orbit of appears stable though simulations showed that it may have some resonant interaction with the known giant planets. Its argument of perihelion is similar to that of another TNO, .
