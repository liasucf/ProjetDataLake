Pedro Carrascalao, who claimed he won the Presidential Race, had not worked at FFTL office since 2007. At 2007 Extraordinary Congress Carrascalao had 13 voting members who elected him as the President of FFTL. Carrascalao alleges that FFTL members were forced to call an Extraordinary Congress in 2007 after the organisation failed to hold a regular Congress \u2013 in which a Presidential vote would have been held \u2013 in the necessary timeframe. He says members were also greatly concerned about potential corruption within the organisation at the time. === General Secretary: Amandio Sarmento Scandal === In February 2017, FIFA terminated and banned General Secretary Amandio Sarmento of FFTL. Sarmento was banned for three years of football activity. Furthermore, Sarmento was guilty of using falsified documents in connection with the fielding of ineligible players by Timor-Leste. ==References== ==External links== * Timor-Leste at the FIFA website. * Timor-Leste at the AFC website Category:Football in East Timor East Timor Football FFTL Category:Sports organizations established in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in East Timor ",
