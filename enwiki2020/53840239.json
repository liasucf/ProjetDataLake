His friends call him 'Sherlock Toms' due to his keen observation skills. Despite some childhood difficulties he grows up to be an IRS officer but has a troubled relationship with his wife Rekha, whom he married accidentally. Tom is affected by the failure of a raid he planned on a \"chit fund company\" and his subsequent suspension. Tom attributes it to his wife's behaviour and has argument with her. She calls the police and alleges Tom hit her. He then faces court cases brought by Rekha and the chit fund company. When it becomes apparent his lawyer is not succeeding in proving his innocence, Tom loudly threatens to commit suicide. The judge orders Tom to undergo psychiatric treatment but during the commotion he flees and accidentally enters the office of the chit company from where he demands the lifting of his suspension and a divorce from Rekha. In the office he discovers cancelled currencies which he shows to the gathered media reporting about him. When the police rescue team captured him, Tom confesses his suicide threat was an act to get the company raided thereby clearing his name. ==Cast== *Biju Menon as P.L.Thomas IRS alias Sherlock Toms Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax/ Deputy Director of Enforcement Directorate *Miya as Shiney Mattummel *Srinda Ashab as Rekha Toms aka Sabdarekha, Toms's wife *Manju Satheesh as P.
