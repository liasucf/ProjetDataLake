    "text": "Haupttruppf\u00fchrer (, \"chief troop leader\") was a Nazi Party paramilitary rank that existed between the years of 1930 and 1945. Haupttruppf\u00fchrer was mainly used as a rank of the Sturmabteilung (SA), but was also used by the Schutzstaffel (SS) in the early days of that group\u2019s existence. As an SA rank, Haupttruppf\u00fchrer was created from the much older Freikorps title of Truppf\u00fchrer. Haupttruppf\u00fchrer was considered a senior most paramilitary enlisted rank, below the first officer position of Sturmf\u00fchrer. A Haupttruppf\u00fchrer typically served as the senior non-commissioned officer of SA regiments, known as Standarten, and the rank was the approximate equivalent to sergeant major. Haupttruppf\u00fchrer translated as \"head troop leader\" and was considered senior to the rank of Obertruppf\u00fchrer. Between 1930 and 1934, Haupttruppf\u00fchrer was also used as a rank of the SS and was held by senior SS non-commissioned officers much the same as the position was used within the SA. In 1934, Haupttruppf\u00fchrer was abolished as an SS rank and renamed as SS- Sturmscharf\u00fchrer. The original insignia for Haupttruppf\u00fchrer consisted of two collar pips and a silver stripe, centered on a collar patch. After 1932, due to an expansion of both the SA and SS rank system, the insignia was modified to display two silver stripes. Some early Nazi records also refer to the rank as Trupphauptf\u00fchrer. ==Insignia== File:NSKK-Haupttruppf\u00fchrer.svg|NSKK Gorget patch File:OT-Haupttruppf\u00fchrer.svg|OT Shoulder patch File:SA- Haupttruppf\u00fchrer.svg|SA Gorget patch ==See also== * Comparative ranks of Nazi Germany {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.5em auto; clear: both;\" |- |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Junior Rank Obertruppf\u00fchrer |width=\"40%\" align=\"center\"|SA rank Haupttruppf\u00fchrer |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Senior Rank Sturmf\u00fchrer |} == Notes == == Bibliography == * * Category:Nazi paramilitary ranks Category:SS ranks ",
