It hosts an annual poetry workshop dedicated to the creation, documentation, and critical analysis of Latinx poetry. ==History== CantoMundo was founded in 2009 in San Antonio, Texas when Norma Elia Cant\u00fa, Celeste Guzman Mendoza, Pablo Miguel Mart\u00ednez, Deborah Paredez, and Carmen Tafolla, inspired by the Cave Canem workshops for African-American poets, organized a workshop for Latino writers. The first workshop was held at the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2010. From 2011 to 2016 the workshops were held at the University of Texas, Austin. From 2017 to 2019 Columbia University, in New York City served as home for the program and workshops.\"Poetry Friday: CantoMundo Retreat in NYC\" by Ysabel Gonzalez, June 30, 2017 Dodge Blog http://blog.grdodge.org/2017/06/30/poetry- friday-cantomundo-retreat-in-nyc/ In August 2019, the University of Arizona Poetry Center formally announced a three-year partnership to host the CantoMundo workshops in Tucson, Arizona beginning in 2020.\"UA Poetry Center Partners with CantoMundo\" by Sarah Gzemski August 20, 2019 https://poetry.arizona.edu/blog/ua-poetry-center-partners-cantomundo CantoMundo is one of over 25 members of the Poetry Coalition, an alliance of nonprofit organizations that aim to promote poetry that is coordinated by the Academy of American Poets.

Mellon Foundation to the Poetry Coalition, some of which went to CantoMundo. ==Writing Conference== During the four day writing conference, fellows are divided into two groups of 12-15 poets that engage in workshops with invited faculty members, attend keynote lectures, and participate in panel discussions. During the weekend, fellows also have the opportunity to share their work in front of an audience at the Friday and Saturday night readings which are free and open to the general public. Readings are sponsored by Columbia University's Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity and the Department of Women\u2019s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Barnard College, and the Office of the Dean of Social Science in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. ==Workshop Faculty== * 2010: Mart\u00edn Espada and Demetria Mart\u00ednez.\"CantoMundo Master Poetry Workshop,\" University of Texas Center for Mexican American Studies, February 8, 2010 https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/cmas/news/article.php?id=2565 Keynote by Toi Derricottehttps://letraslatinasblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/ * 2011: Naomi Ayala and Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz.
