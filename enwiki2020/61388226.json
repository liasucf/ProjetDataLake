    "text": "Omicron Alpha Tau (\u039f\u0391\u03a4) was a historically Jewish Fraternity founded in 1912. It merged with Tau Delta Phi in 1934. ==History== Omicron Alpha Tau was founded at Cornell University in the Spring of 1912. No intention at this time was made to forming a Greek Letter Fraternity which would develop into a national. Founders were Joseph Seidlin, James Castelle, Jack Grossman, Benjamin Brickman, Nat Shiren, Jules Jokel and Abraham Haibloom. The fraternity remained a local fraternity until 1915, when David Browman founded a chapter at the College of Dental and Oral Surgery of New York. Omicron Alpha Tau was particularly known for their houses having adherence to traditional Jewish dietary laws. In 1934, Tau Delta Phi absorbed the chapters at Rutgers, NYU, Marquette and Cornell. The chapter at Syracuse was absorbed by Phi Epsilon Pi and University of Pennsylvania by Phi Beta Delta. ==Magazine== The magazine, as of 1923, was called the OAT digest and distributed Monthly. Later, the magazine's name was changed to \"The Oath\" issued three times a year. ==Conventions== *9th - Milwaukee, Wisconsin - April 28, 1935 ==Chapter list== The Chapters of Omicron Alpha Tau were: *Alpha - Cornell University - 1912 *Beta - College of Dental and Oral Surgery - 1915 (later combined with Gamma) *Gamma - Columbia University - 1916 *Delta - University of Kentucky - 1916 (inactive 1918) *Epsilon - New York University - 1919 *Zeta - Syracuse University - 1921 *Iota - Harvard University - 1921 *Kappa - Connecticut State College - 1922 *Lambda - University of Pennsylvania - 1922 *Nu - Valparaiso University - 1924 *Xi - University of Buffalo - 1925 *Omicron - University of Alabama - 1927 *Pi - University of Illinois - 1927 *Rho - McGill University - 1927 *Sigma - University of Chicago - 1927 *Tau - George Washington University - 1928 *Upsilon - Marquette University - 1928 ==Honorary members== *David SarnoffRadio Personalities 1935 - p142 ==References== Category:Defunct former members of the North American Interfraternity Conference Category:Student organizations established in 1912 Category:Historically Jewish fraternities and sororities in the United States Category:1912 establishments in New York (state) Category:Jewish organizations established in 1912 ",
