LPTV Report, February 1988, page 18 The station went on the air in 1989 shortly before going on the air. It had proclaimed itself as the Knoxville area's first low-powered television station, even though then-FamilyNet affiliate W38AQ in nearby Lenoir City (now Daystar O&O; station WDTT-LD in Knoxville) signed on within two years prior. After the FCC began allowing low-powered stations to use traditional call letters, the station's callsign was changed to WFEM-LP. WFEM-LP identified itself as a full-service independent station, offering a mixture of a few local programs and some syndicated programming not cleared by the full-power outlets, but they also relied on small networks that the station had secondary-basis affiliations to fill some of the program schedule. Secondary affiliations that the station had included those with America One for most of its life, the American Independent Network (AIN) from 2000 to 2001, Urban America Television from 2001 to 2006 sharing that network affiliation with then-UPN affiliate WEEE-LP, and was also a long-time FamilyNet affiliate.\u201dFamilyNet full page ad\u201d.
