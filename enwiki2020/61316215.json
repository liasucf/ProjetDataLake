It takes place in the church of St. Croix, Lyon and meets every Thursday evening. Over 300 young people come each week, with more than 40 000 visitors since its inception up to 2010. After 2010, the Lyon Centre evenings took place once a month in the Sainte Croix de Lyon church and since the end of 2013 at the Sainte-Blandine church, also located in the 2nd arrondissement (district) of Lyon, and host on average 950 visitors each evening. Currently, Glorious hosts mass every Sunday night and run the Worship Academy, a school of praise that allows a group of young people to spend a year of training in music and theology so as to serve in evangelization, on a tour and / or by serving in a parish. The Lyon Centre conference, a weekend devoted to praise with church groups and preaching given by different speakers, has been held once a year since 2015. Ecumenism is very evident during these conferences, as speakers like the Christian Open Door Church, Mulhouse or Hillsong Church are invited. Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, Archbishop of Lyon, is the initiator, along with Glorious, of this project. The Lyon Centre model is spreading all over Europe: Albi in France, Bologna in Italy, Barcelona in Spain. == Members== === Current members=== * Thomas Pouzin \u2013 piano, guitar, vocals * Benjamin Pouzin \u2013 guitar, vocals * Emmanuel Robillard \u2013 bass * David Grail \u2013 drums * David Allevard \u2013 drums * Obed Rajaiah \u2013 keyboard * Pauline Bethuel \u2013 vocals === Former members=== * Julien Sarazin \u2013 bass * Ana\u00ebl Pin \u2013 keyboard * Aur\u00e9lien Pouzin \u2013 guitar * Jean Prat \u2013 drums * Ga\u00ebtan Verrier Bert \u2013 guitar * Marie Cazenave (formerly Marie Le Fichant) \u2013 vocals == Discography== === Studio albums=== === Singles=== * 2005 : Une vie pour une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, single in homage to Pope Jean-Paul II * 2011 : En Cristo, song for the JMJ 2011 * 2012 : Nous dansons * 2014 : \u2020 = \u2665 #DisLeAuMonde * 2015 : Notre P\u00e8re * 2015 : Louez-Le * 2016 : Bienvenue, premier single du nouvel album, 1000 \u00c9chos * 2016 : Plus jamais le m\u00eame * 2016 : Relever le faible * 2016 : Ave Maria with the young singers of Saint-Thomas d'Aquin * 2018 : Le Cantique des Cantiques (Duo with Natasha St-Pier) === Live albums=== == Notes and references== == External links== * * JoyMusic.fr * Page MySpace officielle Glorious * Rejoyce Musique * Glorious, g\u00e9n\u00e9ration louange, a documentary by KTO, 21 June 2019 Category:Musical groups established in 2000 ",
