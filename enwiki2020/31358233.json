    "text": "Moussa Ibrahim Gaddafi ( ; romanized also as Mussa and Musa, born 7 December 1974) is a Libyan political figure who rose to international attention in 2011 as Muammar Gaddafi's Information Minister and official spokesman, serving in this role until the government was toppled in the Libyan Civil War. Ibrahim held frequent press conferences in the course of the war, denouncing rebel forces and the NATO-led military intervention, often in defiant and impassioned tones. His status and whereabouts remained unknown following the Battle of Tripoli in which the Gaddafi government was overthrown, although there were several claims and subsequent refutations of his capture.\"Libya: Confusion at fate of Gaddafi aide Moussa Ibrahim\". BBC News. 21 October 2012. Retrieved 22 April 2013. Eventually, in late 2014, it was discovered he was in Egypt before he was deported and fled to Serbia. On 12 January 2015 Moussa Ibrahim spoke publicly by video link at a political event hosted at the Committee Rooms Houses of Parliament, Westminster, London from an undisclosed location, also the Director of Private Security Company. == Biography == Ibrahim was born on 7 December 1974 into Gaddafi's Qadhadhfa tribe. He studied politics at the University of Exeter in the early 2000s, where he met his future wife Julia Ramelow, a German-born theology student, with whom he has a young son.\"UK-loving true believer sells Gaddafi's message\". The Australian. 11 April 2011. Retrieved 20 September 2013. He worked on a PhD in media arts at Royal Holloway, University of London, completing his final exam in May 2010. One of Ibrahim's lecturers at the University of Exeter, Dr. Larbi Sadiki, described him as an engaging, friendly but serious student \u2014 \"a nice guy but with a short fuse.\" He told Sky News: \"I lived in London for 15 years. I know every street in London. I know how decent the British people are.\" On 19 August 2011, his brother was allegedly killed by an Apache helicopter in Zawiya. During the Battle of Tripoli, he called for a ceasefire and blamed NATO and the West for the situation, saying that the conflicting parties should sit down and negotiate; although he also said that thousands of professional soldiers were ready to defend Tripoli against rebel forces staging an uprising within the capital, as well those advancing towards the city from Zawiya. After the fall of Tripoli, Ibrahim allegedly went on the run with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and was sighted by a senior NTC field commander in Bani Walid. On 5 September 2011, Ibrahim called Reuters by telephone to confirm that Muammar Gaddafi was still in Libya, but declined to say where Gaddafi or himself was. On 26 September 2011, Ibrahim called Reuters by satellite phone to confirm that he was in Sirte the day before when it came under attack by NTC and acknowledged that the situation in Sirte was \"quite bad.\" He confirmed that Gaddafi was still in Libya, but refused to comment on the specific location. He also claimed that he had left Sirte, but vowed to \"go back there.\" It was incorrectly reported by Misrata-based Freedom TV on 29 September 2011 that Ibrahim had been captured near Sirte by NTC fighters while \"dressed as a woman.\" No independent confirmation was forthcoming, and the report was denied by a pro-Gaddafi TV channel. Later that day a spokesman for the Misrata military council, Adel Ibrahim, told AFP \"We cannot confirm he was arrested\", and two days later an NTC commander admitted they had not captured him. On 20 October 2011, on the day Gaddafi was killed in the Battle of Sirte, Reuters reported that Ibrahim had been captured near Sirte, according to a Libyan transitional forces commander; however, this was again proven to be untrue. On 22 October 2011, he was reportedly captured for a third time, along with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, near Bani Walid. This claim was also discredited, as Saif was not captured until 19 November near the town of Ubari. On 20 January 2012, it was reported for the fourth time that Ibrahim had been captured in Asbi'a, Libya. However, the following day these claims were denied by officials in Tripoli. On 22 January 2012, a video was released showing Ibrahim boarding an airplane and claimed he was in \"excellent health.\" On 20 October 2012, Ibrahim was reported captured for the fifth time, in the town of Tarhuna, 40 miles south of Tripoli. For the first time, the reports were backed by the government, who said he was \"being transferred to Tripoli to begin interrogation.\" An audio clip was then released on Facebook, purporting to be Ibrahim's voice denying the reports. On 24 October, government spokesman Nasser Al Manaa apologised for the false reports along with claims that Khamis Gaddafi had been killed. Ibrahim's elder brother Mohamed Ibrahim Mansour, a \"senior finance official\" under Gaddafi, was reportedly arrested in Cairo on 19 March 2013, facing charges of corruption.\"Extradited Qaddafi regime figures flown into Tripoli\". Libya Herald. 26 March 2013. Retrieved 20 September 2013. Several new audio clips purportedly of Ibrahim have been published online, but remain unverified. On 31 October 2014, Egypt, which had become increasingly close to the internationally recognized government of Libya based in Tobruk, agreed to deport Moussa Ibrahim from Cairo. On 12 January 2015, Moussa Ibrahim spoke publicly by video link at an event called \"Libya: NATO's untold story\" hosted by the Tricontinental Anti-Imperialist Platform at the Committee Rooms Houses of Parliament, in Westminster, London. On 27 April 2019, Moussa Ibrahim revealed that Gaddafi loyalists, including military, security, and civil society leaderships, had declared support for Khalifa Haftar, and praised Haftar's Operation Dignity for the release and general amnesty of Gaddafi regime detainees. On 6 October 2019, Moussa Ibrahim gave his first interview to international media since 2011. He claimed NATO's 2011 military intervention in Libya was due to the West's \"lust to continue exploiting Africa\u2019s riches\" in an appearance on RT. On 18 January 2020, Moussa Ibrahim claimed on RT that Green Resistance (Gaddafi loyalists) was using Haftar's army as a \"vehicle for sovereign Libya.\" == See also == *Moussa Koussa, Libyan minister for foreign affairs, March 2009 to March 2011 *Hala Misrati *Baghdad Bob *Green Resistance == References == == External links == * Moussa Ibrahim's YouTube Channel: * Moussa Ibrahim's first public address since Libya war in 2011: Dr Moussa Ibrahim's first public address since Nato's War on Libya in 2011. 12 January 2015.
