They won the 2003 US National Novice title, as well as, the 2005 US National Junior title. After a promising start on the senior international circuit, they announced the ending of their partnership on December 13, 2006, with Pratt deciding to take a break from competitive skating. Gilles teamed up with Jane Summersett in April 2007. Their best result was a bronze medal at the 2008 Nebelhorn Trophy. After Summersett retired from competitive skating in 2010, he worked as a skating coach in Lake Placid. On August 22, 2011, Gilles and Emily Samuelson announced their newly formed partnership. In September, they revealed they would train in Ann Arbor, Michigan, coached by Nechaeva and Chesnichenko with choreography by Tom Dickson and Christopher Dean. In November 2011, they competed in their first event together, the 2011 Cup of China, where they finished 8th. At the time, they had been skating together for approximately two months, and had had their programs choreographed one month earlier.
