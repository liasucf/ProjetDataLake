    "text": "She's the Man is a 2005 American romantic comedy sports film directed by Andy Fickman and starring Amanda Bynes, Channing Tatum, Laura Ramsey. It is inspired by William Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night. The film centers on teenager Viola Hastings, who enters her brother's new boarding school, Illyria Prep, in his place while he tries to break into the music scene in London. Viola pretends to be a boy, in order to play with the boys' soccer team after her team gets cut at her school. ==Plot== Viola Hastings (Amanda Bynes) is a teen girl who plays for Cornwall's soccer team until the team gets cut. Her dream is to play for the North Carolina Tar Heels. Meanwhile, her twin brother, Sebastian (James Kirk), is supposed to enroll in Illyria, an elite boarding school, but he secretly goes to London with his fledgling band instead. Viola agrees to cover for him and decides to pass herself off as Sebastian, in hopes of joining their boys' team and beating Cornwall to prove their coach and her cocky ex-boyfriend, Justin (Robert Hoffman), wrong for suggesting cancellation of the ladies' soccer team. With the help of her stylist friend, Paul (Jonathan Sadowski), she is transformed into \"Sebastian\" and attends Illyria in his place. While moving in, she meets her roommate, Duke Orsino (Channing Tatum), an attractive soccer player and Illyria's team captain. During tryouts, Viola fails to impress Coach Dinklage (Vinnie Jones) and is assigned to second string, much to her dismay. Her teammates, including Duke, initially dislike \"Sebastian\" due to his awkward and strange behavior. However, with help from Paul once again, they begin to accept him into their social circle. \"Sebastian\" then gets the popular and pretty Olivia (Laura Ramsey) as his lab partner, which frustrates Duke, as he has feelings for her. \"Sebastian\" agrees to put in a good word for Duke if he promises to train him to be a better soccer player. Coach Dinklage eventually notices \"Sebastian's\" effort and improvement, thus promoting him to first string. At the Junior League carnival, where her mother has made her volunteer, Viola works a shift at the kissing booth and shares a kiss with Duke. Duke expresses to \"Sebastian\" that he might move on from Olivia as he is starting to like Viola now. Viola is delighted as she secretly feels the same way. Olivia who now has a crush on \"Sebastian\", asks Duke out on a date in hopes that it will make \"Sebastian\" jealous. Viola, who is unaware of Olivia's true intentions, is enraged instead because Duke has now abandoned his interest in Viola. When Viola finds out the truth, she encourages Olivia to tell \"Sebastian\" directly about her feelings. The situation becomes even more complicated when the real Sebastian returns from London a day early, unbeknownst to Viola. As soon as he arrives at Illyria, Olivia confesses her feelings and kisses him. Duke, seeing this, believes his roommate has betrayed him. When \"Sebastian\" returns to their room, the two have an argument and Duke kicks him out. Viola oversleeps and misses the first half of the game, while the real Sebastian is mistaken for \"Sebastian\" and winds up poorly playing his sister's game instead. At half-time, Viola explains the situation to Sebastian and they switch places again. Duke, still furious at \"Sebastian\", refuses to cooperate with him on the field. Determined to makes amends with Duke, \"Sebastian\" explains that he is actually Viola. Illyria wins the game when Viola scores a goal, finally humiliating Justin and the rest of the Cornwall boys. Everyone at Illyria celebrates their victory over Cornwall, except for Duke who is hurt about Viola's deception. Viola introduces Sebastian and Olivia officially, and they begin dating. Viola and Sebastian's divorced parents also make up, exchanging contact information so as to be better parents towards their children. She invites Duke to her debutante ball, with an invitation delivered by Sebastian, now Duke's actual roommate. Still hurt, Duke doesn't respond to Viola's invitation, which devastates her. At the ball, Viola is skeptical that Duke will show up; she distracts herself by assisting Olivia, who is being escorted by Sebastian to the ball, and is touched when Paul asks to be her date. Her mother shows up with a dress that will suit Viola's \"no ruffles\" policy, but Viola decides to go for a walk instead. She runs into Duke outside, who tells her that he has feelings for her, but that he doesn't want there to be any more deception on her part; Viola promises to be honest with him. Later, Monique (Alex Breckenridge) is escorted by Justin, Olivia is escorted by Sebastian, and Viola and Duke enter the stage late, but together, with Viola in her new dress, much to the joy of her mother. Viola and Duke share a kiss before joining the crowd. At the end of the film, Viola and Duke are shown happily playing on Illyria's soccer team together. ==Cast== * Amanda Bynes as Viola Hastings, a talented soccer player underestimated for being a girl, who dresses up as her brother Sebastian to play soccer at Illyria. * Channing Tatum as Duke Orsino, the soccer team captain, who is in love with Olivia and, later, with Viola * Laura Ramsey as Olivia Lennox, a smart girl who falls in love with Sebastian (Viola) * James Snyder as Malcolm Festes, the school nerd and Sebastian's (Viola's) rival * Emily Perkins as Eunice Bates, the nerdy and eccentric classmate with weird sexual fantasies * Alex Breckenridge as Monique Valentine, Sebastian's superficial girlfriend * James Kirk as Sebastian Hastings, Viola's brother, who is in Europe with his band. * Robert Hoffman as Justin Drayton, Viola's ex-boyfriend and Duke's rival * Vinnie Jones as Coach Dinklage * David Cross as Principal Horatio Gold * Julie Hagerty as Daphne Hastings, the mother of Viola and Sebastian * John Pyper-Ferguson as Roger Hastings, the father of Viola and Sebastian * Brandon Jay McLaren as Toby, one of Duke's best friends, who thinks Eunice attractive * Clifton Murray as Andrew, one of Duke's best friends * Jonathan Sadowski as Paul Antonio, Viola's best friend and gay hair stylist * Amanda Crew as Kia, one of Viola's friends * Jessica Lucas as Yvonne, one of Viola's friends * Lynda Boyd as Cheryl, the debutante ball's hostess * Katie Stuart, as Maria, Olivia's friend * Robert Torti as Coach Pistonek * Mark Acheson as Groundskeeper ==Reception== ===Box office=== The film opened at #4 at the North American box office making $10.7 million USD in its opening weekend.
