    "text": "In enzymology, a methylamine-glutamate N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :methylamine + -glutamate \\rightleftharpoons NH3 \\+ N-methyl--glutamate Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are methylamine and -glutamate, whereas its two products are NH3 and N-methyl--glutamate. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methylamine:-glutamate N-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include N-methylglutamate synthase, and methylamine-glutamate methyltransferase. This enzyme participates in methane metabolism. ==References== * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
