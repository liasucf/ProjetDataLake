Her full name is given as Kaho\u02bbohokuokalani-i-kau-i-kaheahea (\"She who sets the stars in heaven and adorns the celestial regions\").Hoohokukalani (Hoohokukalani I, Hoohokukalani-o-Wakea) == Mythology == According to the myth, Ho\u02bbohokukalani is the daughter of the god W\u0101keaAn Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origins and Migrations, and the Ancient History of the Hawaiian People to the Times of Kamehameha I. Written by the judge Abraham Fornander, who mentioned Ho\u02bbohokukalani as the daughter of W\u0101kea: \"I would premise by saying that there exist two versions of the earlier portion of this genealogy, from Wakea to Kii, one descending from Wakea's son Haloa, the other from his daughter Hoohokukalani.\"Peleioholani, Solomon Lehuanui Kalaniomaiheuila (1906), Genealogy of the Robinson family, and ancient legends and chants of Hawaii.

Ka Nupepa Kuokoa (newspaper). who are the deities of male and female creative energy. W\u0101kea and Papah\u0101naumoku (which means \"to adorn the heavens with stars\") created the Hawaiian islands, and then, Ho\u02bbohokukalani was born. When Ho\u02bbohokukalani grew up, W\u0101kea was enchanted by her beauty, and he had a sexual desire for her, although she was his child. However, he could not sleep with his daughter because he was afraid of Papah\u0101naumoku. He then ordered his priest to take away Papah\u0101naumoku. When Papah\u0101naumoku went away with the priest, W\u0101kea and Ho\u02bbohokukalani had sexual relations, and she bore a stillborn son, called Haloa. The son was then buried facing the rising sun in the East. From this spot, taro sprung. The plant, which had heart-shaped leaves and was rather large, was named H\u0101loanakalaukapalili. This plant was very important for the diet of the Hawaiians. Later, W\u0101kea and Ho\u02bbohokukalani produced another, living child, also called Haloa, who was the first of the Native Hawaiian People. This is where the saying \"mamo na H\u0101loa,\" or descendant of H\u0101loa originate from. It is a popular belief throughout the Native Hawaiian people that through their relationship to H\u0101loa, they are related to the kalo (or taro) and are thus related to the rest of the world. == Sources == Category:Hawaiian goddesses ",
