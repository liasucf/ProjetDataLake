    "text": "In algebraic geometry, the \u00e9tale topology is a Grothendieck topology on the category of schemes which has properties similar to the Euclidean topology, but unlike the Euclidean topology, it is also defined in positive characteristic. The \u00e9tale topology was originally introduced by Grothendieck to define \u00e9tale cohomology, and this is still the \u00e9tale topology's most well- known use. ==Definitions== For any scheme X, let \u00c9t(X) be the category of all \u00e9tale morphisms from a scheme to X. This is the analog of the category of open subsets of X (that is, the category whose objects are varieties and whose morphisms are open immersions). Its objects can be informally thought of as \u00e9tale open subsets of X. The intersection of two objects corresponds to their fiber product over X. \u00c9t(X) is a large category, meaning that its objects do not form a set. An \u00e9tale presheaf on X is a contravariant functor from \u00c9t(X) to the category of sets. A presheaf F is called an \u00e9tale sheaf if it satisfies the analog of the usual gluing condition for sheaves on topological spaces. That is, F is an \u00e9tale sheaf if and only if the following condition is true. Suppose that is an object of \u00c9t(X) and that is a jointly surjective family of \u00e9tale morphisms over X. For each i, choose a section xi of F over Ui. The projection map , which is loosely speaking the inclusion of the intersection of Ui and Uj in Ui, induces a restriction map . If for all i and j the restrictions of xi and xj to are equal, then there must exist a unique section x of F over U which restricts to xi for all i. Suppose that X is a Noetherian scheme. An abelian \u00e9tale sheaf F on X is called finite locally constant if it is a representable functor which can be represented by an \u00e9tale cover of X. It is called constructible if X can be covered by a finite family of subschemes on each of which the restriction of F is finite locally constant. It is called torsion if F(U) is a torsion group for all \u00e9tale covers U of X. Finite locally constant sheaves are constructible, and constructible sheaves are torsion. Every torsion sheaf is a filtered inductive limit of constructible sheaves. Grothendieck originally introduced the machinery of Grothendieck topologies and topoi to define the \u00e9tale topology. In this language, the definition of the \u00e9tale topology is succinct but abstract: It is the topology generated by the pretopology whose covering families are jointly surjective families of \u00e9tale morphisms. The small \u00e9tale site of X is the category O(X\u00e9t) whose objects are schemes U with a fixed \u00e9tale morphism U \u2192 X. The morphisms are morphisms of schemes compatible with the fixed maps to X. The big \u00e9tale site of X is the category \u00c9t/X, that is, the category of schemes with a fixed map to X, considered with the \u00e9tale topology. The \u00e9tale topology can be defined using slightly less data. First, notice that the \u00e9tale topology is finer than the Zariski topology. Consequently, to define an \u00e9tale cover of a scheme X, it suffices to first cover X by open affine subschemes, that is, to take a Zariski cover, and then to define an \u00e9tale cover of an affine scheme. An \u00e9tale cover of an affine scheme X can be defined as a surjective family {u\u03b1 : X\u03b1 \u2192 X} such that the set of all \u03b1 is finite, each X\u03b1 is affine, and each u\u03b1 is \u00e9tale. Then an \u00e9tale cover of X is a family {u\u03b1 : X\u03b1 \u2192 X} which becomes an \u00e9tale cover after base changing to any open affine subscheme of X. == Local rings in the \u00e9tale topology == Let X be a scheme with its \u00e9tale topology, and fix a point x of X. In the Zariski topology, the stalk of X at x is computed by taking a direct limit of the sections of the structure sheaf over all the Zariski open neighborhoods of x. In the \u00e9tale topology, there are strictly more open neighborhoods of x, so the correct analog of the local ring at x is formed by taking the limit over a strictly larger family. The correct analog of the local ring at x for the \u00e9tale topology turns out to be the strict henselization of the local ring \\mathcal{O}_{X,x}. It is usually denoted \\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^\\text{sh}. == Examples == *For each \u00e9tale morphism U \\to X, let \\mathbb{G}_m(U) = \\mathcal{O}_U(U)^{\\times}. Then U \\mapsto \\mathbb{G}_m(U) is a presheaf on X; it is a sheaf since it can be represented by the scheme \\operatorname{Spec}_X (\\mathcal{O}_X[t, t^{-1}]). == See also == * \u00c9tale cohomology * Nisnevich topology * Smooth topology * \u2113-adic sheaf == References == * * * * * * *J.
