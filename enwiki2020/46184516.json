With the approval of the government, the board of directors secured the support in launching a project occupying around 7,000 square of land in the midst of the urban area. In 2010, Serene Oasis was set up at 2A Kwun Tong Road in Choi Hung. And up to May 2013, around 850 patients have their mental conditions improved by the therapeutic services.

The sources include revenuesFinancial Run from some of the activities it organizes, sponsorships from the business community, donation from the public, as well as the monetary support from some regular donors. ===Challenges=== Though with the generous support from various parties, Serene Oasis faced several challenges in its operation and future development. First, it has only a limited number of staff to manage the enormous site. Therefore, it is facing a shortage of workers. In light of this, the site and organization organized training programmes to recruit volunteers. The duties of the volunteers include taking care of the growing plants, facilitating the horticultural therapy and teaching some DIY handcraft workshops etc. Serene Oasis requires their volunteers to be keen on farming, helpful, and to be willing to share his/her own knowledge and skills with other community members, so that they can help reduce the burden of the existing staff.
