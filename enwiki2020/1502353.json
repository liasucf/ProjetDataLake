    "text": "Movement in Still Life is the third studio album by American electronica artist BT. Released, in the United Kingdom on October 8, 1999, with a different version for the United States in 2000. The album features a transition towards hip hop and includes the singles \"Godspeed\", \"Dreaming\", and in the US, \"Never Gonna Come Back Down\". The original cover art is a photogram, Invocation, by Adam Fuss.Invocation ==Background== In the United States, Movement in Still Life was entirely revamped for an American audience. This version edits every track by a few minutes and appears in an unmixed format with pauses between songs. The track listing was also re-arranged: original closer \"Satellite\" was moved to the middle of the record and was replaced by hip hop track \"Love on Haight Street\", while the album's opening was also moved to the centre of the record, and was replaced by \"Madskills Mic-Chekka\" and the US single \"Never Gonna Come Back Down\", which featured Mike Doughty of Soul Coughing on vocals. \"Ride\", \"The Hip Hop Phenomenon\", \"Giving Up the Ghost\" and \"Namistai\" were replaced with \"Shame\" and \"Smartbomb\"; the latter of which would be sampled for *NSYNC's international hit \"Pop\", which was also produced by BT. The Australian version of Movement in Still Life uses the UK track listing, but replaces \"The Hip Hop Phenomenon\" with \"Never Gonna Come Back Down\", mixing it into its surrounding tracks with transitions. A song called \"Far From Goodbye (Later My Love)\" was released in a sampler of the album in 1999, but was never released officially. There exists two versions on vinyl: a double-LP version containing a variant of the UK track listing, and a quadruple-LP version featuring eight tracks, with one song per side; this second version wholly features extended mixes. Several of these extended mixes were later added to a Special Edition double-CD set from Hong Kong, which also included other extended mixes. ==Singles== Movement in Still Life ties These Hopeful Machines with the most singles BT ever released from one album, largely due to the differences between the UK and US versions. Tracks like \"Godspeed\" and \"Mercury and Solace\" did well in the UK, but would not fare well on US radio, where \"Never Gonna Come Back Down\" and \"Shame\" performed well on American alternative rock stations. \"Smartbomb\" was used in several films, most notably in 3000 Miles to Graceland, and was used in the video game FreQuency. The Plump DJs remix of \"Smartbomb\" and \"Hip Hop Phenomenon\" were featured in the video game SSX Tricky. The Plump DJs remix also appears in Wipeout Fusion. A remix of \"Never Gonna Come Back Down\" was featured in FIFA Football 2002. \"Ride\" was originally released in 1998 as a single by 2 Phat Cunts, a group comprising BT and Sasha. The track \"Satellite\" contains excerpts from the crew of NASA space shuttle mission STS-51-A during their post-mission press conference. ==Track listing== ===2x vinyl version=== ==Personnel== * BT \u2013 all other vocals, instruments and programming ===Musicians=== * Peanut Butter Wolf \u2013 record scratching on \"Movement in Still Life\" and \"Love on Haight Street\" * Planet Asia \u2013 vocals on \"Madskillz-Mic Chekka\" * Hutchi \u2013 vocals on \"Madskillz-Mic Chekka\" * Rasco \u2013 vocals on \"Madskillz-Mic Chekka\", \"Smartbomb\" and \"Love on Haight Street\" * DJ Davey Dave \u2013 \"cuts\" and \"scratching\" on \"Madskillz-Mic Chekka\" and \"Smartbomb\" * Jan Johnston \u2013 vocals on \"Mercury and Solace\" and \"Sunblind\", backing vocals on \"Dreaming\" * DJ Rap \u2013 vocals on \"Giving Up the Ghost\" * Kirsty Hawkshaw \u2013 vocals on \"Dreaming\" and \"Running Down the Way Up\" * Scott Frassetto \u2013 live drums on \"Satellite\" * Richard Fortus \u2013 guitars on \"Shame\", \"Running Down the Way Up\" and \"Smartbomb\" * Mike Doughty \u2013 vocals on \"Never Gonna Come Back Down\" * Fifty Grand \u2013 vocals on \"Love on Haight Street\" ===Production=== * Sasha \u2013 co-production on \"Ride\" * Adam Freeland \u2013 co-production on \"Madskillz- Mic Chekka\" * Kevin Beber \u2013 co-production on \"Madskillz-Mic Chekka\" * Tsunami One (Adam Freeland & Kevin Beber) \u2013 co-production on \"The Hip Hop Phenomenon\" * Paul van Dyk \u2013 co-production on \"Namast\u00e9\" * Hybrid \u2013 co-production on \"Running Down the Way Up\" and co-credited with \"Godspeed\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Albums Chart (OCC) | 87 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 166 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Heatseekers Albums (Billboard) | 8 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Album Sales (Billboard) | 166 |- |} ==Notes== ==References== Category:1999 albums Category:2000 albums Category:BT (musician) albums Category:Nettwerk Records albums Category:Breakbeat albums ",
