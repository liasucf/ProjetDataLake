Through this dialogue, the youth approaches history through earlier generations and the history is full of rebelliousness. Their efforts to stand in continuity of rich historical tradition expose the nexus of politics, profit and religion. This nexus is depriving people of respectable life and resources of livelihood by advancing its own interests. Here the source of livelihood is Land, also called Mitti. Rabbi, Gaazi, Laali and Tunda has been suspended from the university years ago but they are still staying in Chandigarh, in a bungalow which has been forcibly occupied. They are helping Harmel Singh in his business of politics and liquor. Laali's brother is a peasant leader who wants to familiarize them to the harsh realities of life. They don't have time or patience to listen. He is trying to build the association but they are hell-bent on detachment. With the passage of time and ugly turn of events they realize that their life is worst then beasts. Their struggle for rehabilitation as better human being is an achievement of the film. Tactically unskilled, they realize that the socio-political dynamics is complex and struggle against nefarious nexus is more difficult then they imagined. The story moves, as experience demands patience and precision whereas youthful energy wants to produce immediate results. What an interaction between experience and youthful energy. It can't be always inclusive or antagonistic. In the film the word Mitti keeps expanding in meaning and scope. Through instances it travels from a noun to metaphor, which means history, tradition, culture, values, honesty, responsibility and sense of belonging. === Sikander (2013) === In Panjab University Chandigarh, there are two rival groups of students are fighting for hegemony, one lead by \u2018Harjang\u2019 and other by \u2018Fateh\u2019. Both have been patronized by political leaders. Patronization keeps on shifting with changing political scenario. Politicians use students as muscle power to capture booths, businesses and settle political scores. University has been turned into a minuscule of the bigger political scene. \u2018Sikander\u2019 belongs to a backward village and has come to study in Panjab University Chandigarh. After the Murder of Fateh he takes refuge to cold-blooded violence. Sikander's group corporatizes the illegal businesses under political patronage. They capture cable network, sand mining and real estate. Their rival group is equally violent and competes against them on every front. They negotiate their animosity in student elections. Their public narrative is voluble but they win elections with brutal force of money and muscle. Here the use of money and muscle may not be at the scale of general politics but it sounds that university is a perfect theatre for political rehearsals. Meanwhile, Sikander has a soft corner for his former girlfriend \u2018Beant\u2019. Beant is a confident girl studying in University. She wants to live life on her own terms i.e. equal terms with everyone. Her life- style symbolizes her conviction towards life. She continues to live her way despite being victim of emotional break up and crude gender violence. Beant thinks that main reason of violence is rooted in society, contemporary political culture and insensitive educational institutions. She intends to change the atmosphere which is congenial for violence. In the passage of struggle she realizes that she is not alone as victim or as crusader. Beant and her friends challenge both groups in elections. They respond to their voluble narrative with logic. The small minority comprises diversity of students. For them questioning the political hierarchy is a response to call of history. They are sure that they can avoid this call but morally they are bound to respond. Their response questions the basic nature of educational institutions and role of youth in politics. They link their response to historical events and process which have contributed to make our society humane and compassionate. The film leaves the audience with lots of unanswered questions. Audience all over world can relate to the film as it represents contemporary Punjab in finer details which is not very different from other regions ==== Sarsa v/s Sikander Controversy ==== Jatinder disowned his second film \u2018Sikandar\u2019 which was initially \u2018Sarsa\u2019. He objected to edit which was suggested by producers and upon their disagreement he and the co-writer Daljit Amihttp://archive.indianexpress.com/news/a-river-runs-through-it/1006084/ claimed that they disassociated themselves before the release. And the film was released with the changed title (Sikandar) and with considerable interference with the edit that changed what he wanted to convey. ===Qissa Panjab (2015)=== The film tells the story of youth of Punjab which is deep entrenched in problems like drugs, unemployment etc. The films revolves around the lives of six lead characters which took an ugly when they cross each other. The film received acclaim for its story and depiction of contemporary problems of society. The film traces the story of Deep, a basketball player who along with Arjun (who is son a rich urban landlord), gets into drug trade. On the other side is Kismat, who is a theatre artist and dancer and shares a relationship with Heera, who is a local singer. Speed is a petty thief who falls in love with Sukhjeet, who is raised by her Uncle and Aunt after the death of her father and has a drug addict for brother. The film through the lives of these characters exposes the cruel realities of how lack of meaning opportunities is pushing the youth into the trap of drugs. The film drew critical response and was selected as the opening film at IFFSA/PIFF Toronto, the Official Selection for Ritz International Film Festival Florida and Official Selection for Seattle South Asian Film Festival. == References == ===Sources=== Routledge Handbook of Indian Cinemas by K.
