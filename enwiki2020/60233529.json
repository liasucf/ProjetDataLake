After dropping map one to New York, London grabbed map two to tie the series 1\u20131 going into halftime. The Excelsior took map three, but again, the Spitfire took the next map to force the match into a fifth tiebreaker map.

London lost the first map; on map two Paris, the Spitfire full-held Washington's attack in overtime rounds, but the Justice did the same to tie the map.

London took a 2\u20130 lead heading into halftime with map wins on Lijiang Tower and Hanamura and, subsequently, took map three Blizzard World. Despite losing the final map Havana, London won the series 3\u20131 to maintain their perfect Stage 4 record. The Spitfire's next match was against the Florida Mayhem two days later. Despite being heavy favorites to win the match, strong performances by Florida's Lee \"BQB\" Sang-bum on Mei and Ha \"Sayaplayer\" Jeong-woo on Widowmaker proved to be too much for London to handle, as the team fell 0\u20133. The team took on the Vancouver Titans on 8 August for their first match of week three. While the Spitfire took map one Busan, the Titans came right back with their own win on map two Temple of Anubis to tie up the series.

London fell on the first map Busan, as Atlanta got far more value out of their ultimates and did not allow London to claim a single point. For map two Hanamura, the Spitfire were unable to hold the Reign from completing both points and could not claim a point on their own attack, as they fell 0\u20132 going into halftime. Map three Blizzard World played out similarly to Hanamura, as Atlanta was able to complete the map and London could not cap the first point; with the match already lost, the Spitfire were able to claim two points on the fourth map Havana but still dropped that map as well, getting swept 0\u20134 in the match. == Postseason == === Play-In Tournament === Finishing in seventh place in the regular season standings, the Spitfire qualified for the Play-In Tournament for the chance to qualify for the season playoffs. The team had a first-round bye in the tournament and faced the Shanghai Dragons on 31 August. The Spitfire looked dominant in the first two maps, completely shutting down the Dragons, to jump to an early 2\u20130 lead. However, the Dragon's DPS duo Yang \"DDing\" Jin-hyeok on Pharah and Jin \"YoungJIN\" Yong-jin on Doomfist came alive thereafter, helping Shanghai to claim the third map, Hanamura; with a tie on map six, King's Row, the team eventually tie the series 3\u20133 after seven maps. London sent the match to Ilios for the final map of the series. Both teams managed to take a point in the map, but London's coordination won out in the end, as they won 4\u20133 loss in an Overwatch League record 8-map series to qualify for the season playoffs. === Playoffs === With the win in the Play-In Tournament, the Spitfire qualified as the seventh seed in the season playoffs.

The 1\u20134 loss sent the Spitfire to the lower bracket. For the first round of the lower bracket, London took on the third- seeded San Francisco Shock the following day. Despite London DPS Park \"Profit\" Joon-yeong putting on a stellar performance on Pharah throughout the match, the Shock were able to overcome everything London threw at them.
