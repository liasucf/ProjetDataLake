International positions of abstraction and concept-based art in the areas of painting, sculpture, installations, photography, and video have maintained a continuous presence in the program of the gallery.' http://www.artnet.com/galleries/galerie- schwarzwaelder/ Schwarzw\u00e4lder is interested in more than just presenting artists; she also engages in discussions about current trends in art and how they relate to ancient cultures. ==Biography== Rosemarie Schwarzw\u00e4lder attended the Neue Sprach- und Handelsschule (New College of Language and Commerce) in Basel, Switzerland, where she became fascinated with modern art through the Kunstmuseum Basel. After moving to Zurich, she worked at the Farner PR agency and was part of the team at the Galerie Daniel Keel. In 1970, she moved to Vienna, Austria, where she worked as a journalist for art magazines and the Austrian broadcasting cooperation. In 1978, she became the director of the Galerie n\u00e4chst St. Stephan in Vienna, which was founded by the Catholic priest :de:Otto Mauer, and she became the owner of the gallery in 1987. ==Life and work== ===1978\u20131983=== In the Galerie n\u00e4chst St. Stephan, Rosemarie Schwarzw\u00e4lder initially focused on project-related exhibitions, accompanied by discussions, readings, performances, and concerts (occasionally together with the Wiener Musikgalerie). Artists represented by the gallery included Vito Acconci (1978), Joseph Beuys (1979), Terry Fox (1979) and Mario Merz (1983).\u00dcber Mario Merz, 28.

She also represents many Austrian artists, including :de:Ernst Caramelle and :de:Gerwald Rockenschaub. One of the crucial elements of Rosemarie Schwarzw\u00e4lder\u2019s approach to art education is enabling the comparison of different positions in abstract art.
