Mike Wass, writing for Idolator, expressed that the track was \"a guilty pleasure of the highest order\".

Nevertheless, [the refrain] is after a few plays a catchy tune that you want to hear again and again.\" Music website Pop Shock's Dijei Zasin criticized Yankee's vocal collaboration on the single for \"unnecessary [slowing] down the song\", suggesting that American rapper Pitbull would be an option to feature on a version of \"We Wanna\" destined to the United Kingdom and the United States.
