It is said by Strabo to have been a colony from the Thessalian Pteleum. This town had disappeared in Strabo's time (first century CE); but its uninhabited woody site was still called Pteleasimum or Pteleasion. Its site has not been located. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Elis Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Locations in the Iliad Category:Thessalian colonies Category:Lost ancient cities and towns ",
