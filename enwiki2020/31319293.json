Omani cuisine is influenced by Arab, Iranian, Indian, Asian, Eastern Mediterranean, and African cuisine, reflecting Oman's position as a vast trading empire at the intersection of traditional spice trade routes. Dishes are often based on chicken, fish, and lamb, as well as the staple of rice. Most Omani dishes tend to contain a rich mixture of spices, herbs, and marinades. Pork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Oman, in accordance with Sharia, the Islamic law. ==Characteristics== Although Omani cuisine varies within different regions of Oman, most dishes across the country have a staple of curry, cooked meat, rice, and vegetables. Soups are also common and are usually made from chicken, lamb, and vegetables (e.g., smoked eggplant). The main meal is usually eaten in the middle of the day, while dinner is lighter. ==Dishes== * Harees is wheat mixed with meat or chicken cooked until it forms a thick paste eaten with the fingers or a spoon and served with ghee. * Kahwa is an Omani coffee mixed with cardamom powder, often served as a symbol of hospitality.
