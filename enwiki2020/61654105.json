    "text": "The beginning of the BWV 544 Prelude, in the hand of J.S. Bach. Prelude and Fugue in B minor, BWV 544 is a piece of organ music written by Johann Sebastian Bach sometime between 1727 and 1731, during his tenure in Leipzig.Prelude and Fugue in B minor, BWV 544 at Allmusic Unlike most other organ preludes and fugues of Bach, the autograph fair copy of the score survives.Jones 2013, 58. ==History== Because of the deeply melancholic nature, the B minor affekt, and musical elements of the work, its respective movements are believed by some to have been performed as a prelude and postlude alongside the B minor Cantata La\u00df, F\u00fcrstin, la\u00df noch einen Strahl, BWV 198, which was performed on 17 October 1727 at the University Church in Leipzig as a funeral ode for Christiane Eberhardine, wife of August II the Strong, the Elector of Saxony and King of Poland.Williams 2003, 97. The autograph manuscript, along with that of the Prelude and Fugue in E minor, BWV 548, which is believed to have been written around the same time, share the same watermark and style of handwriting, which points to a composition period of 1727-1731. ==Composition== ===Prelude=== Tightly woven 32nd note scales, suspensions, dramatic octave pedal effects, tension-building through repetition, and appoggiatura harmonies characterize this movement. The opening theme is followed by contrasting fugal episodes. The complex ritornello structure of this prelude makes the work structurally similar to that of other mature organ works, such as the BWV 548 and BWV 546 preludes.Jones 2013, 59. ===Fugue=== The 4/4 fugue is more restrained compared to the 6/8 prelude, containing a relatively straightforward subject that moves in single note steps up and down the B minor scale. ==Arrangements== ===Piano transcriptions=== The piece has been included in Franz Liszt's transcriptions of Bach's six \"Great\" organ Preludes and Fugues, BWV 543 - 548, for solo piano (S. 462). The piece was also transcribed by Ivan Karlovitsch Tscherlitzky.List of Bach-Tscherlitzky piano transcriptions at Bach-Cantatas.com ==References== ==Work Cited== *Williams, Peter (2003), The Organ Music of J.
