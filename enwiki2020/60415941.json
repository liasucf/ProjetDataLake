    "text": "Orchesography is English new wave band Wang Chung's seventh studio album. It consists of the band's greatest hits re-recorded with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. After producing the orchestral albums Orchestral for Visage and Ascension for A Flock of Seagulls, record label August Day decided to continue on the orchestral route by approaching fellow 80s band Wang Chung. Orchesography was released on 31 May 2019 on both CD and digital download formats. On 26 March, a 5-track EP was released for the song \"Dance Hall Days\" which features the band's re-recording with the orchestra, three remixes from other artists, and one \"orcapella\" (an orchestral a cappella). A music video was also recorded. On 10 May, a limited edition box set was released that included four CDs: the main Orchesography album, a vocal and orchestral only CD, a CD containing only the orchestra, and a CD containing non-orchestral remixes of the album tracks. Also included are two CD singles: a 5-track EP of \"Dance Hall Days\" and an 8-track \"Everybody Have Fun Tonight\". == Track listing == == Personnel == ;Musicians * Jack Hues - lead vocals, guitar * Nick Feldman - vocals, bass * Jan Chalupecky - orchestra conductor * Lucie Svehlova - concert master * Allan Ryder - saxophone on \"Dance Hall Days\" * Baby N'Sola, John Bryan - additional vocals ;Technical and additional personnel * John Bryan, Sare Havlicek, Wang Chung - producers * Slava Voroshnin - programming * Sare Havlicek - synth and sampler programming * Sare Havlicek - mixing * Adam Wren - additional engineering * Ray Staff - mastering * Vitek Kral - orchestra recording engineer * James Fitzpatrick - orchestra supervisor * Pete Whitfield, Nick Feldman, Jack Hues, John Bryan, Sare Havlicek - orchestral arrangements * Christy Lee Rogers - cover * Vinny Vero - Wang Chung logo == References == Orchesography Orchesography Category:August Day Recordings albums Category:City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra albums ",
