    "text": "The Anglican Diocese of Bendigo is a diocese of the Anglican Church of Australia. The diocese covers the north-western regions of the state of Victoria, roughly that part of the state north of the Great Dividing Range and west of the Goulburn River. The diocese was separated from the Diocese of Melbourne in 1902, at the same time as the creation of the dioceses of Wangaratta and Gippsland. In 1977, the Diocese of St Arnaud, which had been separated from the Diocese of Ballarat in 1926, was disbanded and merged with Bendigo. The original cathedral church of the diocese was All Saints, Bendigo, but since 1981 the cathedral church has been St Paul's. Since 17 February 2018 the Bishop of Bendigo has been the Right Reverend Matt Brain. The Gannawarra Cluster is an initiative by the diocese in providing a team of locally ordained clergy to offer ministry to three geographically connected parishes, Cohuna, Kerang and Quambatook. ==Deans of Bendigo== * 1902 John Christian MacCullagh (1st Dean of Bendigo) * 1917 W.
