It is on the northern rim of Bangkok Noi canal in the Bangkok Noi District. Royal barges from the Royal Barge Procession are kept at the museum. The museum was formerly a dry dock for barges and warships under the care of the Royal Household and the Royal Thai Navy. The dock and barges sustained severe bombing damage during World War II, but in 1949 they were restored by the Fine Arts Department as part of the Thai cultural heritage. Repairs were completed and the dock became the National Museum of Royal Barges in 1972. ==Exhibition== # Boat and Barge: There are 8 of 52 important royal barges displayed in this museum {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! 1.
