    "text": "The Irish Amateur Open Championship is an amateur golf tournament held annually in Ireland and organised by the Golfing Union of Ireland. The championship has been played as a 72-hole stroke-play event since 1958. Previously it was played as a match-play tournament. The GUI also runs the Irish Amateur Close Championship which is restricted to players born in (or with a parent born in) Ireland or (at the discretion of the GUI) resident in Ireland at least five years. ==History== The championship was founded in 1892 and early winners included John Ball (3 times) and Harold Hilton (4 times). More recent winners are P\u00e1draig Harrington and Louis Oosthuizen. Rory McIlroy was the losing finalist in 2006. The championship was not played during the war years and from 1960 to 1994. On six occasions between 1894 and 1901, the Irish Championship Meeting included a professional tournament as well as the Amateur Championship ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" !Year||Venue||Champion||Country||Runner(s)-up |- |2020 || colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland |- |2019 || County Sligo || James Newton || || Conor Purcell |- |2018 || Royal County Down || Robin Dawson || || John Gough Alex Gleeson |- |2017 || County Down || Peter O'Keeffe || || Christopher Maclean |- |2016 || Royal Dublin || Colm Campbell || || Jack Hume |- |2015 || Royal Dublin || Gavin Moynihan || || Cormac Sharvin |- |2014 || Royal Dublin || Jamie Savage || || Cormac Sharvin |- |2013 || Royal Dublin || Robbie Cannon || || Gavin Moynihan |- |2012 || Royal Dublin || Gavin Moynihan || || Robin Kind |- |2011 || Royal Dublin || Rhys Pugh || || Gordon Stevenson |- |2010 || Royal Dublin || Alan Dunbar || || Kris Nicol |- |2009 || Royal Dublin || Gavin Dear || || Wallace Booth |- |2008 || Royal Dublin || Pedro Figueiredo || || Conor Doran Billy Hemstock Keir McNicoll |- |2007 || Royal Dublin || Lloyd Saltman || || Richard Kilpatrick |- |2006 || Portmarnock || Antti Ahokas || || Rory McIlroy |- |2005 || Carton House (O\u2019Meara course) || Richie Ramsay || || Darren Crowe |- |2004 || Carton House (Montgomerie course) || Craig Smith || || Sean McTernan |- |2003 || Royal Dublin || Noel Fox || || Sean Manley |- |2002 || Royal Dublin || Louis Oosthuizen || || Paul Bradshaw |- |2001 || Royal Dublin || Richard McEvoy || || Michael Hoey |- |2000 || Royal Dublin || Noel Fox || || Michael McDermott |- |1999 || Royal Dublin || Gary Cullen || || Jody Fanagan |- |1998 || Royal Dublin || Michael Hoey || || Gary Cullen |- |1997 || Fota Island || Keith Nolan || || Richie Coughlan |- |1996 || Fota Island || Keith Nolan || || Peter Lawrie |- |1995 || Fota Island || P\u00e1draig Harrington || || Garth McGimpsey |- | colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"|1960\u201394: Not played |- |1959 || Royal County Down || Johnny Duncan || || A.G.
