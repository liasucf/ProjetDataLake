    "text": "City Limits magazine was an alternative weekly event listings and arts magazine for London, founded in 1981 by former staff members of the weekly London listings magazine Time Out, after its owner Tony Elliott abandoned running Time Out on its original co-operative principles. City Limits was edited in its prime by jazz writer John Fordham and former Oz writer Nigel Fountain. The magazine continued to be run as a co-operative for most of its existence, then underwent a chaotic final period of three different owners within two years before it finally ceased publication in 1993. Among other journalists, it launched the careers of Melissa Benn, Kim Newman, and Suzanne Moore. It was also an early site for the writings of the art critic Matthew Collings.Matthew Collings, City Limits, October 1991. ==References== ==External links== * RIP City Limits, London R.I.P. * City Limits, Magazine Forum Category:1981 establishments in England Category:1993 disestablishments in England Category:Alternative magazines Category:Visual arts magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Listings magazines Category:Local interest magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines published in London Category:Magazines established in 1981 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1993 ",
