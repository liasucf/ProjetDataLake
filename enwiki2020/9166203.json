    "text": "The 1954 FA Cup Final was a football match between West Bromwich Albion and Preston North End, played on 1 May 1954 at the original Wembley Stadium in London. It was the final match of the 1953\u201354 staging of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (better known as the FA Cup). The match was the 73rd FA Cup Final and the 26th to be played at Wembley. West Bromwich Albion were appearing in their ninth final, having won the cup on three previous occasions, while Preston had won the competition twice and were playing in the final for the sixth time. The two clubs had met in one final before in 1888, with Albion winning 2\u20131 on that occasion; in this match, Albion won 3\u20132. Ronnie Allen opened the scoring but Preston soon equalised through Angus Morrison. Preston then took the lead through Charlie Wayman although the goal was probably offside. Allen equalised from the penalty spot before a late goal from Frank Griffin secured the cup for Albion for the fourth time. This capped off the club's greatest ever season as they also finished second in the table, agonisingly losing out on 'the double' to Black Country rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers. The last surviving member of the winning team, Ray Barlow, died in March 2012 at the age of 85. As of October 2020, Tommy Docherty is the only surviving player from the match. ==Background== Memorabilia from the final on display at the National Football Museum in Preston. Both clubs were members of the First Division, West Bromwich Albion having finished as runners-up during the 1953\u201354 league season and Preston North End 11th.

Albion had won four of those ties, including the 1886\u201387 semi-final and 1888 final, while Preston were victorious in the semi-finals of 1888\u201389 and 1936\u201337. ==Route to the final== ===West Bromwich Albion=== {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em\" |+ West Bromwich Albion !Round !Opposition !Score |- |3rd||Chelsea (h)|| 1\u20130 |- |4th||Rotherham United (h)||4\u20130 |- |5th||Newcastle United (h)||3\u20132 |- |6th||Tottenham Hotspur (h)||3\u20130 |- |Semi-final||Port Vale (n)||2\u20131 |} As a First Division club, West Bromwich Albion entered the FA Cup at the third round stage.
