    "text": "Certain Iranian Assets (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) is the formal name of a case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The application was lodged by Iran against the United States on 14 June 2016, on grounds of violation of Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights, shortly after Bank Markazi v. Peterson was decided by the United States Supreme Court. The ICJ rejected most of preliminary objections made by the United States and accepted jurisdiction over the case. On 13 February 2019, out of three United States jurisdictional objections, the ICJ dismissed one, upheld another and postponed another to the merits phase. ==Sitting judges== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=2|Name !! rowspan=2|Nationality !! rowspan=2|Position !! colspan=5|Opinions |- !1 !2 !3 !4 !5 |- | Abdulqawi Yusuf || || President || rowspan=15 || || || rowspan=15 || rowspan=15 |- | Xue Hanqin || || Vice President || || |- | Peter Tomka || || Judge || || |- | Ronny Abraham || || Judge || || |- | Mohamed Bennouna || || Judge || || |- | Ant\u00f4nio Augusto Can\u00e7ado Trindade || || Judge || || |- | Giorgio Gaja || || Judge || || |- | Dalveer Bhandari || || Judge || || |- | Patrick Lipton Robinson || || Judge || || |- | James Crawford || || Judge || || |- | Kirill Gevorgian || || Judge || || |- | Nawaf Salam || || Judge || || |- | Yuji Iwasawa || || Judge || || |- | Jamshid Momtaz || || ad hoc Judge || || |- | Charles N.
