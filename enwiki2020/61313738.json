Initially named the Islamic Education Association, (), at a conference of leaders on 22 November 1945, it was decided the organization would enter the political area and oppose Dutch colonialism. The organization was renamed the Islamic Perti Party, the association within the Perti acronym became movement. This change was approved at the party congress in December 1945, which followed the 3 November government decree allowing the formation of political parties. By 1950, the party claimed to have over one million members. ==Party policies== As determined at the fourth party congress, held in Bukitinggi from 20-25 May, the party's main policies were: * to oppose colonialism and to bring about an Indonesia that is independent, sovereign, fair and prosperous * to bring the people happiness and prosperity in line with the precepts of Islam * to strive for all Muslims to properly adhere to Islamic principles and to promote Islamic culture * to endeavor to make Islam the basis of life for the people of Indonesia ==Electoral performance== In the September 1955 legislative election, Perti came tenth nationally, with 1.3 percent of the vote, winning four seats in the 257-seat People's Representative Council, three from Central Sumatra and one from North Sumatra. Party leader Siradjuddin Abbas was elected to the legislature. Three months later, it won a slightly smaller share of the vote in the Constituent Assembly election, resulting in the party obtaining seven of the 514 seats in the Constitutional Assembly, which was tasked with drawing up a permanent constitution.
