    "text": "Theaudience (styled as theaudience) were a Britpop group active in the 1990s. They released one album and saw three singles enter the UK Singles Chart. The band's singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor became a successful solo artist after the band's disbandment. == History == Theaudience were founded by guitarist Billy Reeves, formerly of the indie group Congregation. The group were fronted by Sophie Ellis-Bextor and included drummer/producer \"Patch\" Hannan (ex-The Sundays), keyboard player Nigel Butler (ex-The Bridge), guitarist Dean Mollett (ex-Porcupine) and bass guitarist Kerin Smith. Their one self-titled album received critical acclaim and reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart, with two of four singles released reaching the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. Reeves left the band in December 1998, and although the remaining band members wrote and demoed material for a second album it was rejected by record label Mercury Records, who then dropped the band, which split in 1999. These tracks were leaked onto the internet in 2009 as a fourteen-track album under the fan-made title Quiet Storm. Ellis-Bextor started a solo career in major label dance-pop music following the success of her collaboration with Spiller on \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" in 2000. Smith and Reeves were later involved with London indie pop band Friends of The Bride. == Discography == === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:6em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Album details ! scope=\"col\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| Theaudience | * Released: 17 August 1998 * Formats: CD, CS, LP * Label: Mercury | 22 |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:30em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"I Got the Wherewithal\" | 1997 | 170 |rowspan=\"4\"| theaudience |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"If You Can't Do It When You're Young; When Can You Do It?\" |rowspan=\"3\"| 1998 | 48 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed\" | 27 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"I Know Enough (I Don't Get Enough)\" | 25 |} == References == == External links == * * Theaudience page at Sophie- Online.net * Album review Category:English pop music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1996 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1999 Category:Britpop groups Category:Sophie Ellis-Bextor ",
