    "text": "Magic Goes Wrong is a comedy play by Henry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer, Henry Shields (of Mischief Theatre Company) and Penn & Teller. It follows the series of Mischief's Goes Wrong series of plays following The Play That Goes Wrong and Peter Pan Goes Wrong. It was notable for employing a far greater level of black comedy than previous installments in the series, including many on-stage gory demises for the guest characters. Although, slightly paradoxically, the ending was considerably more upbeat and sentimental than the group's other productions. == Production == The play opened in the Quays Theatre at The Lowry, Salford from 6 to 11 August 2019, prior to its opening in London's West End at the Vaudeville Theatre from 14 December 2019. The play was the third Mischief production running simultaneously in the West End alongside the long- running productions of The Play That Goes Wrong and The Comedy About a Bank Robbery (until its closure in March 2020), and the fourth in London while Peter Pan Goes Wrong played the Christmas 2019 season at the Alexandra Palace. In March 2020, the play temporarily stopped performances due to the COVID-19 pandemic. == Cast and characters == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Characters !Original cast |- !Spitzamus |Bryony Corrigan |- !Eugenia |Roxy Faridany |- !The Blade |Dave Hearn |- !Mind Mangler |Henry Lewis |- !Mickey |Jonathan Sayer |- !Sophisticato |Henry Shields |- !Bear |Nancy Zamit |- ! rowspan=\"5\" |Understudies |Natasha Culley |- |Lauren Ingram |- |Laurence Pears |- |Sydney K Smith |- |Liv Spencer |} == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%;\" ! style=\"width: 5%;\" |Year ! style=\"width: 20%;\" |Award ! style=\"width: 40%;\" |Category ! style=\"width: 10%;\" |Result |- |2020 |Laurence Olivier Awards |Best Entertainment or Comedy Play | |} == References == Category:2019 plays Category:Mischief Theatre Category:West End plays Category:British plays ",
