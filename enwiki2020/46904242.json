    "text": "' is a sub-kilometer asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object of the Aten group. It has only been observed during 5 days in February 1993, and not been detected ever since. The small body measures approximately 20 meters in diameter based on an absolute magnitude of 26.4, and has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of 13.8 lunar distances or . == Orbit == was first observed on 17 February 1993, by the Spacewatch survey at Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, United States. From 1993 to 1998, it was the asteroid with the lowest known aphelion at 1.023 AU, and was thus the closest thing to an Apohele asteroid known at the time. It currently orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8\u20131.0 AU once every 11 months (331 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 12\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. == Description == When was discovered 23 February 1998, it was found to have an aphelion less than , and also less than the Earth's distance to the Sun (0.980 \u00b1 0.05 AU), making it the first detected Apohele asteroid. However, was lost before the orbit could be confirmed, so retained the title of the asteroid with the lowest known aphelion. When was discovered 25 November 1998, it was found to have a slightly smaller aphelion (1.019 AU) than , so took the title. However, lost its smallest aphelion title almost immediately when (aphelion of 1.014 AU) was discovered only a few weeks later on 8 December 1998. The orbit of brings it during the years 1900\u20132200 as close as of the Earth (on 19 February 1993) and as close as of Venus (on 15 October 1933, and 30 September 2077). For comparison, the distance to the Moon is about 0.0026 AU (384,400 km). Because the orbit was determined with only 5 days worth of observations, the orbit of has an uncertainty of 6 on a scale of 0 to 9, with 0 being the most certain, and 9 being the most uncertain. This uncertainty is common for small asteroids that are difficult to observe. == References == == External links == * List Of Aten Minor Planets (by designation), Minor Planet Center * * * # Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) 19930217 ",
