    "text": "Br\u00f8ndby Stadium (, ) is a football stadium in Br\u00f8ndbyvester, Denmark and the home ground of Danish Superliga club Br\u00f8ndby IF. It is the second-largest stadium in Denmark. Built in 1965 and inaugurated on 31 June 1966 where it had no stands, it saw a major redevelopment in 2000 which increased capacity to 31,500 spectators, of which 19,700 were seated. Continuous adjustments to the spectator facilities have since resulted in the stadium having a total capacity of 28,000 spectators, of which 23,400 are seated. Record attendance dates to 18 June 2003, where a crowd of 31,508 were present in a Copenhagen Derby against F.C. Copenhagen. When hosting the UEFA competitions Champions League and Europa League, seats are installed on the South End terraces () in accordance with UEFA regulations, which reduces the total capacity to 26,000. The stadium has also hosted the Denmark national football team in five matches. Their first game at Br\u00f8ndby Stadium was a friendly against Portugal on 1 September 2006 which ended in a 4\u20132 win. == History == === Turning idea into product === The idea of constructing a centrally located, municipal sports facility was presented by erstwhile mayor Jens Christian Jensen in 1945,Barnak 2007, p. 27. but at the time the sports clubs of the municipality could not agree on a common stadium. When a merger of the municipality's three largest sports clubs was considered in the 1950s, much suggests that these plans were fostered on a political as well as executive level. Having only one club in the municipality would enable a more rational use of a future Br\u00f8ndby Stadium. The idea of a merger gained support in Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster Idr\u00e6tsforening, and at the general assembly in 1962 a majority of the board voted their approval of merging Br\u00f8ndbyvester Idr\u00e6tsforening and Br\u00f8ndby Strands Idr\u00e6tsforeninger. The latter, however, immediately disapproved of the idea, while a vote in Br\u00f8ndbyvester ended up with the same result: a 'no' to merging into a municipal superstructure.Barnak 2007, p. 28. Only a few years would pass before plans of merging Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster Idr\u00e6tsforening and Br\u00f8ndbyvester Idr\u00e6tsforening would resurface. Financial benefit was one of the main arguments for uniting the two clubs in order to play at a future municipal stadium, and mayor of Br\u00f8ndby in the period 1966\u20132005, as well as chairman of Br\u00f8ndby IF board in 1971\u201371, Kjeld Rasmussen, has since stated that he and Br\u00f8ndby's mayor at the time had decided to construct a stadium, provided that the two clubs would merge.Barnak 2007, p. 61. On 3 December 1964 in Kirkebjerg Salen in Br\u00f8ndbyvester, the boards of Br\u00f8ndbyvester Idr\u00e6tsforening and Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster Idr\u00e6tsforening adopted an agreement to merge into one club: Br\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening (Br\u00f8ndby IF).Rasmussen 2009, pp. 37\u201338. === Construction and early years === When the stadium reached its completion in 1965, the ground consisted of nothing more than a grass pitch surrounded by an athletics track and a spectator rail circling the field of play, a training complex featuring four grass pitches, and a gravel pitch. Behind one of the goals various athletics facilities were established, as the club shared the stadium with Br\u00f8ndby Atletik. In addition, a changing room with four separate compartments was constructed, featuring showers and toilet facilities. The official inauguration of the pitch was officially planned for late summer 1965, but issues with making the grass grow postponed the launch to 31 July 1966. In the following years, the area around Br\u00f8ndby Stadium continuously developed and expanded; in 1969\u201370 the municipality constructed additional training pitches south of the ground, close to the Holb\u00e6k Motorway,Barnak 2007, p. 33 and even more training complexes were built South of the motorway in 1972\u201374. Conditions around the main playing pitch were also improved; in 1966 two turnstiles were set up at the stadium entrance, and in 1969 a clock was added, courtesy of local watchmaker Bent Henriksen from Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster Torv. In 1973 the municipality allocated DKK 20,000 to set up a modern loudspeaker system consisting of four folded horn loudspeakers suspended on four-metre steel trusses. === Constructing the stands === As Br\u00f8ndby IF moved up the ranks, a need arose for a more contemporary stadium. In 1975, the municipality allowed the club to improve spectator facilities by installing two-step terraces around the running track.Barnak 2007, p. 72 This happened despite the club's wishes to install a covered grandstand. Only in 1977, when the club reached promotion to the third highest football league in Denmark, the Danish 2nd Division, did the municipality decide that a covered grandstand should be erected. The DKK 4 million project broke ground during the summer of 1978, and in early 1979 the grandstand was ready for use.Barnak 2007, p. 73 The stand, which could hold 1,335 seated spectators, and included a speaker booth, media facilities and a TV plateau, was placed facing West towards Gildh\u00f8jskolen. Beneath the stand were constructed four dressing rooms, a kiosk, an office, toilet facilities, a storage room as well as the club room of Br\u00f8ndby Atletik. In the spring of 1980, the municipality installed the first floodlights with a brightness of 4 x 24 kW. With the new stand, spectator capacity increased to 5,000. As Br\u00f8ndby IF had reached promotion to the highest football league in Denmark in the fall of 1981, then known as the 1st Division, mayor Kjeld Rasmussen proclaimed that a covered stand would be constructed.Barnak 2007, p. 80 Prior to the 1982 season - Br\u00f8ndby's first on the highest level - concrete terraces were installed opposite the existing grandstand, consisting of 13 rows of terraces the length of the pitch in open air. This allowed a crowd of 5,000 additional people, bringing the total capacity to 10,000. Br\u00f8ndby Stadium as seen from the South in 2005. After the club had established itself in the top of Danish football during the 1980s, Br\u00f8ndby IF reached a hitherto zenith by reaching the quarter-finals of the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup.Rasmussen 2009, pp. 205\u2013207. At that time, Br\u00f8ndby Stadium did not live up to international standards to host matches at that level. However, this was solved by installing temporary end stands of scaffolding, which allowed the club to receive an approval by the UEFA to organise the home leg against Torpedo Moscow. The changes raised the total capacity to 15,000 spectators, and the club even outdid themselves when they reached the semi-finals by increasing the capacity to 17,000-18,000. In the same period Br\u00f8ndby IF submitted a bid to host the Denmark national football team at a new national stadium; a \"Stadion Danmark\", which would seat 60,000 spectators and border the Holb\u00e6k Motorway. These plans, however, never came to fruition as Parken Stadium won the bid and eventually became the national stadium. As Br\u00f8ndby IF gained domestic and European success, spectator interest had grown to such a degree, that it became necessary to move the biggest matches to K\u00f8benhavns Idr\u00e6tspark. This solution was not deemed satisfactory for neither club, fans nor sponsors, who wanted to remain rooted in the local community. Therefore, the board under leadership of Per Bjerregaard, decided to plan an expansion of Br\u00f8ndby Stadium.Barnak 2007, pp. 139-140 The first step was taken in 1990, when the stand opposite the grandstand was covered and expanded with eight rows, holding 3,500 seated spectators, as well as terracing holding 10,500 standing spectators in total. In the same year the grandstand was expanded with a lounge for sponsors in which a panoramic window allowed for a view of the entire pitch. While Br\u00f8ndby Municipality had financed the new covered stand, Br\u00f8ndby IF funded the construction of the sponsors lounge. Despite improved spectator facilities, the stadium did still not live up to UEFA requirements, and the club wished to erect permanent terracing behind both goals. As this would mean that the running track around the pitch had to be demolished, and that Br\u00f8ndby Atletik would have to be compensated with a new running track elsewhere, the municipality chose to turn down Br\u00f8ndby IF's application to further expand the stadium.Barnak 2007, pp. 139-140 This made the club consider moving to another city where it would be able to host international games, prompting the municipality to offer Br\u00f8ndby IF to acquire the stadium and thus raise money to construct an athletics stadium. The club board, spearheaded by Bjerregaard, was, however, only interested in purchasing the area behind the two goals. Br\u00f8ndby IF had meanwhile offered to pay for construction costs of the end stands themselves, but in order to do so the pitch had to be expanded both in width and length. In 1991, the municipal council decided that Br\u00f8ndby IF should have the sole right to use the stadium.Barnak 2007, pp. 140-141 Thus, a green light was finally given to turn Br\u00f8ndby Stadium into a football-specific stadium. In December 1991, the contractor began removing the running track, and in the spring of 1992, the expanded Br\u00f8ndby Stadium has reached completion: four covered stands with a total capacity of almost 21,000 spectators. This included the infamous terraced \"South Side\"-end () - then known as Faxe Tribunen for sponsorship reasons - which was inaugurated on 29 March 1992. With the 1,335 seats on the main grandstand and another 3,000 new seats on the lower side of the opposite stand, the stadium could hold more than 6,000 seated spectators.Barnak 2007, p. 141 === 1999\u20132000 expansion === Despite several expansions and improvements over the years, Br\u00f8ndby Stadium could still not achieve acceptable capacity for international matches, and the club was therefore forced to rent Parken Stadium in Indre \u00d8sterbro - home of the national team as well as archrivals FC Copenhagen - for major matches under UEFA. This resulted in losses; both on a financial level, but also in terms of prestige, and because of this the board continued to work on plans of further expanding the stadium. The first step was commencing negotiations with Br\u00f8ndby Municipality in order to secure the total acquisition of the stadium, and as a result of the proceedings, Br\u00f8ndby IF A/S purchased Br\u00f8ndby Stadium for DKK 23.5 million in May 1998.Storm & Thomsen 2016, p. 278 From this, DKK 16 million was to be deducted for the two end stands and the sponsors lounge, which the club itself had financed, resulting in a final amount of DKK 7.3 million.Barnak 2007, p. 180 The acquisition officially took place on 1 January 1999, after which the largest expansion of Br\u00f8ndby Stadium could commence; a connected upper stand supported by a total of 32 concrete staircase towers, and a new roof carried by a total of 32 m tall iron structures, each 25 m apart. These would - together with the existing lower stands - ensure that the stadium could bring the total spectator capacity to more than 30,000 for European games and 33,000 to domestic matches. The total costs for the expansion were DKK 270 million, 40 million more than original estimates due to costs spiralling. In addition to the new upper stand section, the main grandstand was expanded with a superstructure. Not least, the sponsor and lounge areas were expanded considerably, and a new three-storey annex providing administrative offices, press facilities, commercial kitchen and lounge areas able to host more than 3,000 was erected facing the parking lot.Barnak 2007, p. 181 On the ground floor additional facilities, including a lobby, a gym for the players and a fanshop, were constructed. Aerial view of Br\u00f8ndby Stadium. The connected upper stands meant that the corners of the stadium became partly enclosed, and toilet stalls as well as food and drink outlets were placed in the spaces between the lower and upper stands. The new upper stands included 13,600 new seats, increasing the total capacity to 31,500 spectators. For international matches, capacity was limited to 26,500 spectators as they demand all-seated crowds. The entire redevelopment progressed while the club still played its home games at the stadium, and the original changing rooms under the main grandstand, originating from 1978, were retained. The stadium officially reopened with a ceremony on 22 October 2000, followed by an exhibition game between the Br\u00f8ndby IF team from 1989 and Skagen IK; a rematch mirroring a 1986\u201387 Danish Cup game, where Skagen from the Danish fifth tier knocked out Br\u00f8ndby after a penalty-shootout, in what has been described as \"the biggest sensation in Danish Cup history\". The first competitive game after the rebuild occurred on 22 October 2000 with a 4-2 league win over Akademisk Boldklub in front of 28,416 spectators. The stadium reached total completion in 2001. The redevelopment also made Br\u00f8ndby Stadium a part of the Nordic countries' bid for hosting the UEFA Euro 2008, which was eventually awarded to Austria\u2013Switzerland. === Additions and improvements === Because the total costs of the 1999\u20132000 expansion exceeded the originally planned budget by DKK 30\u201340 million, some major and minor additions and improvements to audience facilities were postponed and subsequently carried out over time. First of foremost, the club could not afford new turnstiles, and a planned, highly modern entrance system was only installed in 2003, just as the scoreboards initially did not meet the requirements of the Danish Football Union. The original substitutes' benches in the technical area likewise had to be utilised for some years before being permanently replaced by benches below pitch-level in 2005. The new blue seats planned for the lower stands would initially have to wait; firstly, the old, worn-out seats were retained on the two original long-side stands, which in the first years following the rebuild appeared as gray, red, yellow and light blue seats. Secondly, seats were expected to be fitted to the extended section of the old grandstand and the lower section of the northern end stand. However, an extra \"row 34\" was added relatively quickly all the way around the top of the stands, in front of the glass partitions. As new dark blue seats were installed on the aforementioned areas in 2003, a total seating capacity reached 23,400. This increased total stadium capacity to 29,000, while the stadium could hold crowds of 26,144 for international matches. This was due to the fact that for international fixtures, the South Side-end terracing could be converted into approximately 2,600 seats. Despite many delayed improvements to the stadium, the redevelopment in 2000 already had already secured improved facilities for wheelchair users, as a wheelchair lift had been installed at the southern end of the East Stand. In 2006\u20132007, the East Stand (today known as GSV Stand () for sponsorship reasons) was further expanded at the back with a lounge for sponsors, classrooms for Br\u00f8ndby Gymnasium (general upper secondary education), a public gym, a production kitchen and the sports bar \"1964\". In addition, spectator conditions were improved upon with six new multi-stalls and three new staircases beneath the East Stand. Two large LED screens were also installed during this period. The total cost of the project ran up to DKK 90 million. In 2008, major sponsor Jesper \"Kasi-Jesper\" Nielsen of KasiGroup financed a decoration of the Br\u00f8ndby Stadium facade; yellow, illuminated letters with the stadium name affixed between the roof and the top row of seating at three of the stands. In addition, each gable was adorned with four large images that showed Br\u00f8ndby IF players and fans in different situations. During the winter break in of the 2017\u201318 season, the hole on the South Side- end was closed which meant that an additional 75 seats and extra capacity for 150 standing spectators on terracing were added to the stadium. The rebuild was financed by the club's fans, through the official fanclub Br\u00f8ndby Support and various unofficial fan groups, and through a so-called \"fan fund\" which arose as a result of season tickets and merchandise sales, among other things. In total, the renovation costs amounted to DKK 450,000, of which the fan fund accounted for DKK 270,000. In the summer of 2018, new 256 LED floodlights were installed, produced in China. == Structure and facilities == The Br\u00f8ndby Stadium pitch is surrounded by four covered stands, officially known as Sydsiden (South), GSV-tribunen (East), J. Jensen-tribunen (North) and Carlsberg-tribunen (West). Three stands are all-seaters (except the away section on the North End) while the South End is terracing. Each stand has two tiers. Sydsiden, the former \"Faxe Tribunen\" during a 4-0 win over Esbjerg fB in July 2016. === Sydsiden (South End) === Sydsiden, literally \"South Side\" in English, was inaugurated as the new South Stand on 29 March 1992 in a match against Lyngby Boldklub, due to a rise in interest for Br\u00f8ndby IF. The lower part of the stand has a standing capacity of 5,600 spectators. Initially, spectators would sit on the terraces, but younger fans would begin encouraging all fans on Sydsiden to stand up, because they thought that it was easier to sing while standing, which would evolve into the mantra \"sing or piss off\" (). This would mark the beginning of a hard-core fan-culture formation on Sydsiden, which has remained ever since, and it is known as the stand in Denmark with the most dedicated and loudest fans when Br\u00f8ndby plays its home games. Until 6 March 2011, Sydsiden was known by its sponsor name, \"Faxe Tribunen\", a subsidiary of Royal Unibrew. This had to change as there was a conflict of interest as Carlsberg moved in as new sponsors. Sydsiden was chosen by a panel representing a broad section of the active fan base at Br\u00f8ndby Stadium, as fans had called the stand this before. Halfway through the 2017\u201318 season, the hole in the middle of the stand was partly closed, after continuous requests by fans. A permanent fanzone was inaugurated outside Sydsiden in 2018 for spectators and fans before, during and after the games. The fanzone is the first of its kind in Scandinavia, and consists of stands for live concerts, bars, foodstands and toilet facilities. Sydsiden popularised the \"Fenerbah\u00e7e greeting\" in Denmark, imported through the transfer of Brian Steen Nielsen to the Turkish club. A cooperation between goalkeeper Mogens Krogh and Br\u00f8ndby Support effectually made the greeting get foothold in Denmark. === North End === The North Stand, now known as \"J. Jensen-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was originally known as \"OBS!-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1992 as terracing, and has among fans been known as \"P\u00f8lseenden\" () due to its former major sponsor, sausage producer Steff-Houlberg. Fans from the away team are assigned a section on this stand, usually in the eastern part of the North Stand, separated from Br\u00f8ndby's home fans. View over the West Stand during a 4-0 win over Esbjerg fB in July 2016. === West Stand === The West Stand, known as \"Carlsberg-tribunen\", was originally named \"Frisko-tribunen\" and later also \"SAS-tribunen\" and \"Apollo-tribunen\". The original part of the stand was completed in 1979 as the first stand of the stadium, and it has been preserved through the large expansion in 1999\u20132000. It can also accommodate a some fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites, and is the ground's main grandstand. === East Stand === The East Stand, now known as \"GSV-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was formerly called \"LOXAM-tribunen\", \"Codan-tribunen, and \"DNE-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1982 and 1990. The East Stand was originally without a roof, and consisted of terraces. Today, it is the largest stand of Br\u00f8ndby Stadium with a total of 34 rows of seats. In 2006, a larger extension was established behind the stand from the facade, consisting of sponsor facilities, a sports bar and classrooms for Br\u00f8ndby Gymnasium. The classrooms were inaugurated on 8 January 2007. In April 2018, a new family lounge was opened behind the East Stand with both physical and Esports facilities. == Pitch and surroundings == === Pitch 2 === Br\u00f8ndby Stadium - Pitch 2 The east side of the stadium is also the site of Bane 2 (\"Pitch 2\"), which is used as the club's training facility, some exhibition games, youth matches and the home ground of the women's team for matches in Elitedivisionen. === The pitch === After the original pitch was put into service in 1965, it turned out that had not been drained properly and as a result the municipality had to ban all use of the pitch until the summer. Due to insufficient training grounds in the early years of Br\u00f8ndby IF, the grass on the pitch quickly became worn, and in 1971 so many holes had appeared that it needed to be relaid. Br\u00f8ndby Stadium at night-time. When all four stands had been erected in 1992, the pitch could be expanded and reshaped, which happened in 1996. On the same occasion, heat pipes and a new, specialised irrigation system were laid under the new grass playing surface. In addition to the improved pitch, new floodlights were installed on the roof of the west and east stands, in order for the lighting to meet the international requirements. Floodlights at Br\u00f8ndby Stadium. The current pitch measures 105 metres (115 yd) long by 68 metres (74 yd) wide. There has been some controversy on the pitch throughout the years. In 2015, the grass playing surface had not been replaced since 1997, and was four times as old as the four-year-old green turf at Blue Water Arena in Esbjerg, which at that point made it the second oldest pitch in the Danish Superliga. During the fall of 2014, players and coaches began criticising the playing surface at Br\u00f8ndby Stadium for its misarable state, which had meant that Br\u00f8ndby's style of play had to be changed from a focus on technique to a more physical game. The explanation for the pitch's poor condition was allegedly its age and that Br\u00f8ndby Municipality had been responsible for maintaining the pitches in and surrounding Br\u00f8ndby Stadium until the end of 2013. According to Per Rud, however, blame was not to be placed by the municipality, and he stated that there was a difference between operating pitches of regular amateur clubs and professional clubs. At the end of 2014, the club decided to improve the pitch in three phases, where the first phase was to fill the grass playing surface with volcanic ash and setting up carbon dioxide tents to improve growth. The second phase was improving the pitch drainage, in order to guide the water away. The third and final phase was a complete relaying of the pitch. However, the last phase would only happen in 2016, where both the grass surface and the soil under the pitch were changed. In March 2015, it was revealed that the pitch would still be renovated in the summer of 2015, where access to the drainage and heating pipes were dug, in order for the pitch to drain properly in the future. According to then chairman, Jesper J\u00f8rgensen, a grass surface would be installed. On 13 April 2015, Br\u00f8ndby IF announced that the coming home game would be played on a new grass pitch at Br\u00f8ndby Stadium, and not as earlier planned after the 2014\u201315 season. A solution at the cost of DKK 1-2 million with turf from the Netherlands was chosen, which would constitute a temporary pitch before a major renovation was to be completed in October. In 2016, GrassMaster hybrid grass was installed which would become a permanent solution the pitch. The new pitch became popular, and the Superliga-captains voted the pitch as the best of the league on 30 May 2017. ==Transportation== ;Rail S-train line B The stadium is accessible via a number of S-train stations.
