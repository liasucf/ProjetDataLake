Renowned for his military skill and embodiment of chivalry, he was made a marshal of France. ==Biography== He was the son of Jean I Le Maingre, also called Boucicaut and likewise a marshal of France. He became a page at the court of Charles V of France, and at the age of 12 he accompanied Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, in a campaign against Normandy. At age 16 he was knighted by Louis on the eve of the Battle of Roosebeke (27 November 1382). In 1383, he began the first of his journeys that would take up more than twenty years of his life. In 1384, he undertook his first journey to Prussia, in order to assist the Teutonic Order in their war against the pagan Lithuanians, who would convert to Roman Catholicism in 1386. After some campaigns against the Moors in Spain, and against Toulouse in France he again accompanied the duke of Bourbon, this time to Spain, which had become a secondary battlefield of the Hundred Years' War. From there he travelled for two years through the Balkans, the Near East, and the Holy Land, in the company of his friend Renaud of Roye and later with Philip of Artois, Count of Eu. There, he and his companions composed the Livre des Cent Ballades, a poetical defense of the chaste knight the central figure of chivalry, which Johan Huizinga found a startling contrast with the facts of his military career.

The next year he travelled to Prussia for a third time. Because of his great service in the war against the heathens in Livonia and Prussia, he was named Marshal of France on 25 December 1391 by Charles VI at the cathedral of St. Martin in Tours. In 1396, he took part in the joint French-Hungarian crusade against the Ottoman Empire, which suffered a heavy defeat on September 28 at the Battle of Nicopolis. He was taken hostage by the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I, but, unlike many of his companions, escaped execution and was eventually ransomed. In 1399, he founded the Emprise de l'Escu vert \u00e0 la Dame Blanche, a chivalric order inspired by the ideal of courtly love: \"one might have supposed him cured of all chivalrous delusions after the catastrophe of Nicopolis\", remarked Huizinga. In the same year, he was sent with six ships carrying 1,200 men to assist Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaeologus against the Ottomans, who were besieging Constantinople. In 1401, because of his military accomplishments and his knowledge of the east, he was appointed French governor of Genoa, which had fallen to Charles VI in 1396. He successfully repelled an attack from King Janus of Cyprus, who tried to take back the city of Famagusta on Cyprus, which had been captured by Genoa. Later on, Boucicaut wanted to attack Alexandria but he was prevented by adverse winds to land there, he later went to Tripoli, then after a costly attempt to capture it, he went south to Botron which was burned and pillaged, then to Beirut on 10 August 1403, which was also sacked and 500 bundles of spices worth 30,000 ducats were taken from the Venetian warehouses there, he later went to attack Sidon then Latakia, which both showed resistance due to strong garrison, he returned to Famagusta in late August, to eventually settle in Rhodes in September, where he dispatched 500 men with two large ships who tried in vain to take Alexandria. On his return, he was defeated by the Venetians at the Battle of Modon on 7 October 1403. After some struggles in the Mediterranean the Genoese freed themselves from French rule by 1409. Boucicaut returned to France and became involved in the rivalry between Burgundy and Orl\u00e9ans. In the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 he commanded the French vanguard, but was captured by the English and died six years later in Yorkshire. He was buried in the cathedral of Tours, in his family's chapel, with the epitaph \"Grand Constable of the Emperor and of the Empire of Constantinople.\" ==Notes== ==References== * Anonymous, Le Livre des faits du bon messire Jehan le Maingre, dit Boucicaut. mar\u00e9schal de France et gouverneur de Jennes * Ch\u00e2telet, Albert, L' \u00e2ge d'or du manuscrit \u00e0 peintures en France au temps de Charles VI et les heures du Mar\u00e9chal Boucicaut, Dijon 2000. * Lalande, Denis, Jean II le Meingre, dit Boucicaut: (1366\u20131421) - \u00e9tude d'une biographie h\u00e9ro\u00efque, Gen\u00e8ve 1988. * * ==External links== * Category:Marshals of France Category:People of the Hundred Years' War Category:Christians of the Battle of Nicopolis Category:People of the Reconquista Category:People of the Northern Crusades Category:Christians of the Crusades Category:French prisoners of war in the Hundred Years' War Category:1366 births Category:1421 deaths Category:French prisoners of war in the 14th century Category:14th- century French people Category:15th-century French people Category:Medieval French knights ",
