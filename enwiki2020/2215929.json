    "text": "\u0106 in upper and lowercase The grapheme \u0106 (minuscule: \u0107), formed from C with the addition of an acute accent, is used in various languages. It usually denotes , the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate, including in phonetic transcription. Its Unicode codepoints are U+0106 for \u0106 and U+0107 for \u0107. The symbol originated in the Polish alphabet (where, in its modern usage, it appears most often at the ends of words) and was adopted by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj into Serbo-Croatian in the 19th century. It is the fifth letter of the Polish, Sorbian, and the Latin alphabet of Serbo-Croatian language, as well as its slight variant, the Montenegrin Latin alphabet. It is fourth in the Belarusian \u0141acinka alphabet. It is also adopted by Wymysorys a West- Germanic language spoken in Poland. It is also the fifth letter of the Wymysorys alphabet. In Slovenian, it occurs only in loanwords, mainly from Serbo-Croatian (such as the surname Handanovi\u0107), and denotes the same sound as \u010c, i.e. the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet equivalent is \u040b (23rd letter). Macedonian uses \u040c as a partial equivalent (24th letter). Other languages which use the Cyrillic alphabet usually represent this sound by the character combination \u0427\u042c. \u0106 is the same as the Sanskrit \u091a (a palatal sound, although IAST uses the letter c to denote it). The letter is also used in unofficial Belarusian \u0141acinka where it represents the palatalized alveolar affricate . In Ladin it represents [t\u0283] when preceded by [\u0283] (e.g. des\u0107iari\u00e9, [de\u0283t\u0283ari\u02c8e]). == Computing code == ==See also== * Acute accent * \u010c * List of Latin digraphs ==References== Category:Latin letters with diacritics Category:Phonetic transcription symbols Category:Specific Polish letters Category:Serbo-Croatian language ",
