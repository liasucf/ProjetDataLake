He attended elementary school in Pyongyang, and then middle school at the Meiji Academy in Japan. In May 1919 he fled in exile to Shanghai where he was a reporter for the provisional government newspaper, The Independence (Dongnipsinmun). During this time he encountered An Changho and Lee Gwangsu. While in exile in Shanghai he entered Hujiang University to study Chemistry. He graduated from Hogang College in Shanghai in 1925. He was the editor of The Creation, famously the first literary magazine in Korea and was one of the leading figures of the New Poetry movement. In 1979, the South Korean government conferred on him posthumously honors of Rose of Sharon.\"\uae40\ub355\ub828, \ubc1c\uad74/ \uc8fc\uc694 \uce5c\uc77c\uba85\ub2e8 120\uba85 \uc911 34\uba85 \ud574\ubc29\ud6c4 \ud6c8\u00b7\ud3ec\uc7a5\u00b7\ud45c\ucc3d \uc11c\ud6c8 - \uae40\uc131\uc218\ub294 2\ub4f1\uae09, \uc720\uad00\uc21c\uc740 3\ub4f1\uae09\" \u300aOhmynews\u300b (2005.8.31) Additionally, several hymns are composed by him, which contributed development church music of Korea. ==Works== Chu was considered a representative poet of the 1920 and 30's and his work can be roughly divided into those poems composed before his exile in Shanghai and those written afterward. His earlier poems, written during his years in Japan, reflect the influence of modern Western and Japanese poetry. The influence of the French symbolist poet Paul Fort is especially evident in pieces such as \u201cPlaying with Fire\u201d (Bullori): in a limpid, clear style he sensitively registers the minutest of impressions and manages to lend them a sensual immediacy. Yohan\u2019s work as a whole more or less reflects a gradual turning away from styles and forms influenced by Western poetry toward traditional Korean poetry. Like Kim Eok, he was a major figure in Korean Literature who pioneered the move away from Western imitation to his literary roots. He articulates the reasons for this shift of inspiration in his critical piece, \u201cTo the One Who Would Write a Song\u201d (Noraereul jieusillyeoneun iege), in which he places the highest value on the creation of beauty and vitality in the Korean language and move on to develop a complete theory of poetry. After 1930, Yohan concentrated on writing sijo, a traditional Korean poetic form, but continued to produce other verse and edited, with others, the poetry anthology Poetry of Three People (Samin sigajip) and an anthology of sijo, Blind Flower (Bongsa kkot). ==Works in Korean (Partial)== Poems * \u201cPlaying with Fire\u201d (Bullori) * \"Shanghai Story\u201d (Sanghae iyagi) * \u201cChina Girl\u201d (Chaina sonyeo) * \u201cAt the Park\u201d (Gongwoneseo) * \u201cTo the One Who Would Write a Song\u201d (Noraereul jieusillyeoneun iege) ==See also== *List of Korean language poets *Korean poetry ==References== ==External links== * The Song-A Literature Foundation * Category:Korean male poets Category:1900 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Literature of Korea under Japanese rule Category:20th-century Korean poets Category:Members of the National Assembly (South Korea) Category:Government ministers of South Korea Category:Korean journalists Category:People from Pyongyang Category:Sinan Joo clan Category:20th-century male writers Category:20th-century journalists ",
