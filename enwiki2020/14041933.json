    "text": "Ed Pegg, Jr. noted that the length d equals \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{30}(61421-23\\sqrt{5831385})} that is very close to 7 (7.0000000857 ca.) In recreational mathematics, an almost integer (or near- integer) is any number that is not an integer but is very close to one. Almost integers are considered interesting when they arise in some context in which they are unexpected. == Almost integers relating to the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers== Well-known examples of almost integers are high powers of the golden ratio \\phi=\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}\\approx 1.618, for example: : \\begin{align} \\phi^{17} & =\\frac{3571+1597\\sqrt5}{2}\\approx 3571.00028 \\\\\\\\[6pt] \\phi^{18} & =2889+1292\\sqrt5 \\approx 5777.999827 \\\\\\\\[6pt] \\phi^{19} & =\\frac{9349+4181\\sqrt5}{2}\\approx 9349.000107 \\end{align} The fact that these powers approach integers is non-coincidental, because the golden ratio is a Pisot\u2013Vijayaraghavan number. The ratios of Fibonacci or Lucas numbers can also make countless almost integers, for instance: * \\operatorname{Fib}(360)/\\operatorname{Fib}(216) \\approx 1242282009792667284144565908481.999999999999999999999999999999195 * \\operatorname{Lucas}(361)/\\operatorname{Lucas}(216) \\approx 2010054515457065378082322433761.000000000000000000000000000000497 The above examples can be generalized by the following sequences, which generate near- integers approaching Lucas numbers with increasing precision: * a(n) = \\operatorname{Fib}(45\\times2^n)/\\operatorname{Fib}(27\\times2^n) \\approx \\operatorname{Lucas}(18\\times2^n) * a(n) = \\operatorname{Lucas}(45\\times2^n+1)/\\operatorname{Lucas}(27\\times2^n) \\approx \\operatorname{Lucas}(18\\times2^n+1) As n increases, the number of consecutive nines or zeros beginning at the tenth place of a(n) approaches infinity. == Almost integers relating to e and == Other occurrences of non-coincidental near-integers involve the three largest Heegner numbers: * e^{\\pi\\sqrt{43}}\\approx 884736743.999777466 * e^{\\pi\\sqrt{67}}\\approx 147197952743.999998662454 * e^{\\pi\\sqrt{163}}\\approx 262537412640768743.99999999999925007 where the non-coincidence can be better appreciated when expressed in the common simple form:http://groups.google.com.ph/group/sci.math.research/browse_thread/thread/3d24137c9a860893?hl=en# :e^{\\pi\\sqrt{43}}=12^3(9^2-1)^3+744-(2.225\\ldots)\\times 10^{-4} :e^{\\pi\\sqrt{67}}=12^3(21^2-1)^3+744-(1.337\\ldots)\\times 10^{-6} :e^{\\pi\\sqrt{163}}=12^3(231^2-1)^3+744-(7.499\\ldots)\\times 10^{-13} where :21=3\\times7, \\quad 231=3\\times7\\times11, \\quad 744=24\\times 31 and the reason for the squares being due to certain Eisenstein series. The constant e^{\\pi\\sqrt{163}} is sometimes referred to as Ramanujan's constant. Almost integers that involve the mathematical constants and e have often puzzled mathematicians. An example is: e^\\pi-\\pi=19.999099979189\\ldots To date, no explanation has been given for why Gelfond's constant (e^\\pi) is nearly identical to \\pi+20,Eric Weisstein, \"Almost Integer\" at MathWorld which is therefore considered a mathematical coincidence. ==See also== *Schizophrenic number == References == == External links == * J.S.
