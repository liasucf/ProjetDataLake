    "text": "Skin disinfection is a process that involves the application of a disinfectant to reduce levels of microorganisms on the skin. Disinfecting both the skin of the patient and the hands of the healthcare providers are an important part of surgery. Skin disinfection may be accomplished with a number of solutions including providone-iodine, chlorhexidine, alcohol based solutions, and cetrimide. There is tentative evidence that chlorhexidine and denatured alcohol use to clean skin prior to surgery is better than povidone-iodine with alcohol; however, the evidence is not strong enough as of 2015 to determine routine practice. Its importance in health care was determined by Semmelweis in the 1840s. ==References== Category:Skin care ",
