    "text": "This article gives an overview of the maritime cliff communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system. ==Introduction== The maritime cliff communities of the NVC were described in Volume 5 of British Plant Communities, first published in 2000, along with the other maritime communities (those of shingle strand-line and sand-dunes and saltmarshes) and vegetation of open habitats. In total, 12 maritime cliff communities have been identified. The maritime cliff communities consist of three subgroups: * five maritime cliff crevice and ledge communities (MC1, MC2, MC3, MC4 and MC5) * five maritime grassland communities of sea-cliffs (MC8, MC9, MC10, MC11 and MC12) * two communities associated with sea-bird cliffs (MC6 and MC7) ==List of maritime cliff communities== The following is a list of the communities that make up this category: * MC1 Crithmum maritimum - Spergularia rupicola maritime rock-crevice community Crithmo-Spergularietum rupicolae G\u00e9hu 1964 * MC2 Armeria maritima - Ligusticum scoticum maritime rock-crevice community * MC3 Rhodiola rosea - Armeria maritima maritime cliff-ledge community * MC4 Brassica oleracea maritime cliff-ledge community * MC5 Armeria maritima - Cerastium diffusum ssp. diffusum maritime therophyte community * MC6 Atriplex prostrata - Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima sea-bird cliff community Atriplici- Betetum maritimae J.-M. & J. G\u00e9hu 1969 * MC7 Stellaria media - Rumex acetosa sea-bird cliff community * MC8 Festuca rubra - Armeria maritima maritime grassland * MC9 Festuca rubra - Holcus lanatus maritime grassland * MC10 Festuca rubra - Plantago spp. maritime grassland * MC11 Festuca rubra - Daucus carota ssp. gummifer maritime grassland * MC12 Festuca rubra - Hyacinthoides non-scripta maritime bluebell community ",
