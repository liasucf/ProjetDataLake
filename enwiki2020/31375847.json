    "text": "Ni\u015fanc\u0131 was a high post in Ottoman bureaucracy. The Turkish word ni\u015fanc\u0131 literally means \"court calligrapher\" or \"sealer,\" as the original duty of the ni\u015fanc\u0131 was to seal royal precepts. ==History== Although the post of the court calligrapher was established during the reign of Orhan (1324\u20131361), the name ni\u015fanc\u0131 came into use during the reign of Murat II (1421\u20131451). According to the law of Mehmet II (1451\u20131481), the ni\u015fanc\u0131 was a member of the divan (Ottoman government). Beginning in the mid-18th century, the post lost its former importance, and in 1836, it was abolished. == Duties of the ni\u015fanc\u0131 == The ni\u015fanc\u0131 was responsible for sealing the precepts of the sultan and the grand vizier. The ni\u015fanc\u0131 was also responsible in supervising the divan's archives and keeping the records of the timar system (lands granted by the Ottoman sultans to bureaucrats and sipahi soldiers in return for their services). Up until the 17th century, the post of ni\u015fanc\u0131 was also the equivalent of foreign minister. However, during the reign of Mehmet IV (1648\u20131687), reis\u00fclk\u00fcttap (literally \"the chief of clerks\"), a post previously subordinate to that of the ni\u015fanc\u0131, replaced ni\u015fanc\u0131 as the Ottoman Empire's foreign ministry.Gabor Agoston-Bruce Masters: Encyclopaedia of the Ottoman Empire, , pp.50\u201351 ==Grand viziers of Nisanc\u0131 origin== *Karamanl\u0131 Mehmet Pasha (1477\u20131481) *Aya\u015fl\u0131 \u0130smail Pasha (1688\u20131688) *Elmas Mehmet Pasha (1695\u20131697) *Ni\u015fanc\u0131 S\u00fcleyman Pasha (1709-1712) *Ni\u015fanc\u0131 Ahmet Pasha (1740\u20131742) ==References== Category:Government of the Ottoman Empire Category:Ottoman titles Category:Turkish words and phrases ",
