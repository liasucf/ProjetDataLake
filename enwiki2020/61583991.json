    "text": "right Allies is a 1993 role-playing game supplement published by Hero Games for Champions. ==Contents== Allies contains 50 new non-player characters (NPCs) for use in the Champions role-playing game. Forty-two of the characters are members of new teams of super heroes that include Executive Sanction, the Redeemed, the Flashmen, the Posse, the Braverman Foundation and the Zen Team. The remaining eight are solo characters. As noted by reviewer Allen Varney, these can be used by the referee as back-up teams available to the player characters; or, despite the title Allies, as rivals contesting for the same goal; or even as villains. ==Reception== In the December 1994 edition of Dragon (Issue #212), Allen Varney called this a \"long-needed Champions game supplement [that can] flesh out your campaign with 50 super-powered NPC heroes, vigilantes, entrepreurs and wannabes.\" Varney found fault with \"widely varying power levels, no proofreading, and that recurrent annoyance, the meaningless Psychological Limitation (\u201cStrong regard for life\u201d; \u201cNo sense of humor\u201d).\" However, Varney concluded that Allies should be part every referee's \"vital toolkit for any four-colour Champions campaign.\" ==Reviews== *White Wolf #39 (1994) ==References== Category:Champions supplements ",
