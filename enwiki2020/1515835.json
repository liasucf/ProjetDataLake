    "text": "Cinematech was a TV show on G4 and G4techTV that showcases various cutscenes and trailers for video games past, present, and upcoming. Some of the cut scenes are outros, which only people who have played through the game would have been able to see. Some of this footage comes from the interns of X-Play, who had to play through the game for the X-Play review. The show has neither a host nor any narration. A new version of the show, entitled Cinematech: Nocturnal Emissions, was shown during the Midnight Spank block. In addition, some episodes of Cinematech have been devoted to classic games and how much they are worth today. ==Cinematech: Nocturnal Emissions== Cinematech: Nocturnal Emissions is an alternate version of the original Cinematech shown during the Midnight Spank block on G4. It features content that is more violent, sexually suggestive, or offbeat than what is normally shown on Cinematech. It usually focuses on foreign games, and are usually based on anime (examples are Pretty Cure and School Rumble); and it also airs openings for anime series such as Beck. Several of the games' previews shown during this show have not yet been released in the United States, or are Japan- and South Korea-only games. In other episodes, there have been tributes to popular games (such as The Legend of Zelda) which include small amounts of trivia about that game. == References == * * Category:G4 (American TV network) original programming Category:Television shows about video games Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:2007 American television series endings ",
