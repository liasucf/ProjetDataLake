As of 2016, it is the 12th busiest civil airport in China. It is located in the suburban Jiangning District, over south of the city center, and is connected to Nanjing and neighboring towns by expressways. Phase I of the Ninggao Intercity Line and Line S1 of the Nanjing Metro link the airport with Nanjing South railway station. Nanjing is the hub for China Eastern Airlines' Jiangsu Company, and a focus city for Shenzhen Airlines. China Southern Airlines and XiamenAir also operate a considerable number of flights there. Nanjing is the main base for China Postal Airlines, with pure cargo service to all major cities in China, handling express mail and cargo transportation for China Post. In 2017, the airport handled 25,822,936 passengers and 374,214.9 tons of freight. ==History== Construction of Nanjing Lukou International Airport started on 28 February 1995, and was completed two years later. When the airport opened on 1 July 1997, all civilian operations were transferred to it from Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport, and Nanjing Dajiaochang was converted to a Chinese military air base. Although Nanjing Lukou had been designated an international airport since commencing operations, China\u2019s state administrations only approved it for foreign aircraft on 18 November 1997. In 2006, China Post started building its express logistics center at Nanjing Lukou to handle its express mail services. Initial construction was completed by 2009, with additional facilities and functions added continuously. The final project, as planned, would be the largest in Asia and the third-largest in the world of its kind. In 2009, the airport handled 10 million passengers. In 2013, that number surpassed 15 million, which was 3 million above the terminal\u2019s designed operational capacity. In preparation for the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics, hosted by Nanjing, Terminal 2 was completed after more than three years of construction. Also completed were a new parallel runway with taxiways, a new tower, new aircraft parking positions, and new cargo handling facilities. On 12 July 2014, all flights were relocated to Terminal 2, and Terminal 1 was closed for renovation. The new facilities removed the bottleneck caused by the limited capability of the old terminal and runway. In November 2014, with the launching of the Phase 2 expansion and optimization of neighboring air traffic patterns, authorities approved an increase of peak- hour flight volume from 28 flights per hour to 38 flights per hour. With the added capacity, Nanjing Airport has seen rapid increase in both aircraft movement and total passengers. In 2015, the number of total passengers exceeded 19 million (until 28 December), that is 2.87 million on top of 2014, a 17.7% increase compared to the same period of the previous year. The airport continues to see substantial increase into 2016, which saw 29,210 aircraft movements and 3.39 million passengers handled in January and February, a 16.9% and a 21.2% increase respectively, comparing to the same period 2015. ==Composition== The airport consists of two terminals, two 3600-meter runways (paralleled by three taxiways and connected by two taxiways), two control towers, a cargo center, a transportation center, and an apron. Adjacent to, but not belonging to, the airport is the China Post express logistics center and the base for China Postal Airlines.

The Phase 2 expansion includes: *Terminal 2 (263,000m\u00b2 floor space, 35 boarding bridges, annual capacity 18 million passengers) *a new 4F-rating southern runway and two parallel taxiways *two taxiways connecting the northern and southern runways *20 aircraft parking positions *a second control tower (height 107 m) *an 11,000m\u00b2 carpark *a transportation center, which seats a subway station, a coach station, a Pullman Hotel, and shopping and dining facilities The two terminals are also connected by the transportation center structure. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== Waiting hall Interior of NKG T2 ===Cargo=== ==Ground transportation== ===Airport shuttle=== ====City to airport==== * From Nanjing South Railway Station: 6:00\u201321:00, every 20 minutes, duration 40 minutes * From Nanjing Railway Station East Square (with a stop at 221 Middle Longpan Road): 5:40\u201321:00, every 20 minutes, duration 80 minutes ====Airport to city==== * Line 1: 30 minutes after the first landing to the last landing of the day (stops: Yuhua Square, Qinhong Bridge, Xihuamen, Nanjing railway station); max. interval 30 minutes * Line 2: 9:30\u201322:30 (stops: Cuipingshan Hotel, Nanjing South railway station, Zhonghuamen Subway Station), max. interval 30 minutes ===Expressway=== The airport is accessed by Konggang Road, which connects to the Airport Expressway.
