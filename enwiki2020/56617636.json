The film premiered on March 16, 2018 in Mexico. == Plot == The film follows Fernando (Osvaldo Benavides), a young diplomat who has just achieved the most important achievement of his career: returning Montezuma's plume to Mexico. Fernando is also about to marry the woman of his life. On the other hand, his two cousins Mat\u00edas (Alfonso Dosal) \u2014 a former pop star \u2014 and Dante (Martin Altomaro), a man trying to finish an infinite thesis that lives in the closet of his mother's house, are the complete opposite of our protagonist. The papers are reversed when Viviana (Marcela Guirado), Fernando's girlfriend, confesses through Whatsapp that she has cheated on him, a message that arrives at the least opportune moment. Fernando loses the control he has maintained all his life, stealing the plume and throwing himself in an insane revenge, which can cost him the skin, his poor cousins who go behind trying to save him, and in passing, the plume of Moctezuma to a country that has been waiting 500 years for his return. == Cast == * Osvaldo Benavides as Fernando * Marcela Guirado as Viviana * Martin Altomaro as Dante * Alfonso Dosal as Mat\u00edas * Sebasti\u00e1n Zurita as Masiosare * Marianna Burelli as Duva * Paula Serrano as Carmen == References == == External links == * Category:Mexican films Category:Mexican comedy films Category:2018 comedy films ",
