The company is home to K-pop artists Kim Jae-hwan, Natty and IZ*ONE. It also formerly managed I.O.I, Wanna One, and X1. ==History== In June 2018, Stone Music Entertainment established the exclusive label Swing Entertainment for managing Wanna One since the latter ended their contract with YMC Entertainment, with Shin Dong-gil (who is the former manager under YMC Entertainment) as the label head. Starting from June 1, Wanna One would be managed under Swing Entertainment, a new agency exclusively established for the group after their contract with YMC Entertainment expired. This new arrangement would still maintain the partnership with YMC. Following the disbandment of Wanna One, Kim Jae-hwan signed with Swing Entertainment in 2019. It was announced that 3 years after their disbandment, I.O.I was set to return in December 2019, potentially with all 11 original members, and will be co-managed by Swing Entertainment and Studio Blu. However, the comeback has been virtually canceled due to scheduling conflicts between the members and the ongoing Produce investigations. After the finale of the survival program, Produce X 101, the final winners, X1, will be managed by Swing Entertainment and has made their debut on August 27, 2019. However, due to the Mnet vote manipulation investigation, the group disbanded on January 6, 2020. In December 2019, YMC Entertainment founder and ex-CEO Cho Yoo-myung became the new CEO of Swing Entertainment, replacing his colleague Shin who became an executive director. On March 10, 2020, it was announced that Swing would co-manage Iz*One with CJ ENM's Off The Record.https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/article/421/0004514184 On April 6, Natty, a former contestant in Sixteen and Idol School, signed with Swing.
