    "text": "Ailill Finn, son of Art mac Lugdach, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. In the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, he succeeded to the throne when his father was killed by F\u00edachu Tolgrach and his son Dui Ladrach. He ruled for nine years. Two years into his reign, F\u00edachu Tolgrach was killed in battle against Airgetmar, son of S\u00edrl\u00e1m. The men of Munster, led by Ailill's son Eochu and Lugaid, son of Eochu F\u00edadmuine, then drove Airgetmar into exile overseas. After seven years Airgetmar returned to Ireland and killed Ailill with the help of Dui Ladrach and his son F\u00edachu, but was unable to seize the throne, which was taken by Eochu.R. A.

The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises his reign with that of Artaxerxes II of Persia (404\u2013358). The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his reign to 586\u2013577 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 795\u2013786 BC. He is given as an ancestor of the Gamarad of Nephin, County Mayo. ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland Category:Monarchs from County Mayo ",
