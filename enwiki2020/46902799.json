The site collected and sold clothing and accessories from both established and up-and-coming designers. It provided advice from stylists and costumes designers in the entertainment industry. Ullman wrote a monthly column. The web site was launched in November 1999 and co-founded by Stephanie Laing and Jeannine Braden. ==Television series== In 2001, Ullman hosted a spin-off television talk show series for Oxygen Network, Tracey Ullman's Visible Panty Lines. Like Purple Skirt, the show showcased fashion and style advice from industry experts, along with sit-down interviews with celebrities discussing their own personal style. ==References== ==External links== * Press release concerning the launch of Purple Skirt * What's So Funny About a Purple Skirt? * Tracey takes on skirts * Ullman's Clothes Call Category:Online clothing retailers of the United States Category:Internet properties established in 1999 Category:Defunct online companies of the United States Category:Defunct websites Category:1999 establishments in California ",
