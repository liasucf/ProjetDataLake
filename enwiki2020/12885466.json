    "text": "Wonderfest is a nonprofit California corporation dedicated to informal science education. Wonderfest inspires and nurtures a deep sense of wonder about the world. Through provocative public discourse about science, Wonderfest stimulates curiosity, promotes careful reasoning, challenges unexamined beliefs, and encourages lifelong learning. Wonderfest achieves these ends primarily through regular public science gatherings in the San Francisco Bay Area and through online science videos. To date, more than 25,000 people have attended Wonderfest events, and more than 1 million have watched Wonderfest videos. Wonderfest achieved corporate independence in September 2011. During the preceding fourteen years, Wonderfest was an educational project of, first, San Francisco University High School, then, The Branson School. From 1998 to 2010, Wonderfest produced an annual science festival\u2014the first such community- wide event in the United States\u2014that presented a series of expert dialogues on topics of scientific controversy. The topics were varied, covering astronomy, biology, psychology, physics, etc. In 2011, this festival was supplanted by the Bay Area Science Festival, headquartered at the University of California, San Francisco. Wonderfest, subtitled \"The Bay Area Beacon of Science,\" is dedicated to the memory of Carl Sagan. From 2002 through 2010, and again in 2015, Wonderfest awarded the $5000 Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization.
