He then toured East Germany the following year, sponsored by the Corona (soft drink) brand. First racing as a semi professional from 1959, he turned professional in 1967, and retired in 1973. During this period he recorded 30 victories, including the UK national title in 1963 and 1965, as well as two Lincoln Grand Prix victories. In 1963 Hitchen made his one and only appearance in the Tour de France, with a best finish of 41st on stage 1a before withdrawing after stage three. The majority of his cycling career was spent with Viking Cycles, with whom he won two editions of the 275-mile London-Holyhead race, and Falcon Cycles for the final five years. After his retirement from professional cycling, he was appointed the racing team manager of the Falcon Sales Team. ==Railway career== Whilst working his way up towards a professional cycling career, from school Hitchen joined British Railways to work on steam locomotives in Mirfield for 18 months, followed by a further 12 months at Wakefield's shed, and then six months at Bradford Hammerton Street.

After leaving BR, and during his semi-professional cycle racing career, Hitchen spent three years looking after Barclay tanks and fireless locomotives at ICI's Dalton works in Huddersfield. After retiring from professional cycling, Hitchen returned to BR, initially working at MPD. ==Railway preservation== In 1980, Hitchen bought Bulleid West Country Pacific No.34027 \"Taw Valley\" for preservation from Woodham Brothers scrapyard.
