    "text": "Table E 1027 is an adjustable steel and glass table designed by Irish designer Eileen Gray in 1927. Originally created for her E-1027 house, the table has since become one of Gray's most famous designs. The table's adjustable arm and light weight make it flexible in function. It has been suggested that Gray originally designed the table for her sister, who ate breakfast in bed; by holding a dining tray above the bed, rather than directly on the bed, the spill of crumbs could be avoided. Before her death, Eileen Gray sold the design to British furniture manufacturer, Aram. == References == Category:Individual models of furniture Category:Products introduced in 1927 ",
