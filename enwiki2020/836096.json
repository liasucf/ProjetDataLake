    "text": "Vima Takto or Vima Taktu was a Kushan emperor who reigned c. 80\u201390 CE. ==Rule== Vima Takto was long known as \"The nameless King\", since his coins only showed the legend \"The King of Kings, Great Saviour\", until the discovery of the Rabatak inscription helped connect his name with the title on the coins. Vima Takto's empire covered northwestern Gandhara and greater Bactria towards China, where Kushan presence has been asserted in the Tarim Basin. Under his reign, embassies were also sent to the Chinese court. ===Genealogy=== He is mentioned in the Chinese Historical Chronicle of the Hou Hanshu, in relation to his father Kujula Kadphises: \"Qiujiuque (Ch: \u4e18\u5c31\u537b) [Kujula Kadphises] was more than eighty years old when he died. His son, Yangaozhen (Ch:\u95bb\u9ad8\u73cd) [probably Vema Tahk(tu) or, possibly, his brother Sada\u1e63ka\u1e47a], became king in his place. He defeated Tianzhu [North-western India] and installed Generals to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang [Kushan] king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi.\"Hill (2009), p. 29; also note 13.16, p. 351, and Appendix O, p. 608. The connection of Vima Takto with other Kushan rulers is described in the Rabatak inscription, which was written by Kanishka. Kanishka makes the list of the kings who ruled up to his time: Kujula Kadphises as his great-grandfather, Vima Takto as his grandfather, Vima Kadphises as his father, and himself Kanishka: > \"... for King Kujula Kadphises (his) great grandfather, and for King Vima > Taktu (his) grandfather, and for King Vima Kadphises (his) father, and *also > for himself, King Kanishka\" (Cribb and Sims-Williams 1995/6: 80) A later inscription found at Vima's sanctuary at Mat, also records that he was the grandfather of Huvishka.
