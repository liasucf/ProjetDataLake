The base set includes standard posed photos of players and managers, photos of players and managers in action during games, and league leader cards with three players per card. ===Parallel Sets=== Since 1965, the Canadian candy company O-Pee-Chee produced virtually identical, but smaller, sets identical to the Topps issue of the same year. The Canadian printed cards tended to be printed on lighter grey cardstock and often included traded lines on the front of the cards. In 1972, due to Canadian law, the cards were modified to include both French and English text in which case T.C.G was replaced by O.P.C. in the copyright line. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Set !Description !Cards in Set !Size |- |O-Pee-Chee | |525 |2.5 x 3.5 inches |- |} ==Football== In 1972, Topps issued two Football sets featuring the National Football League. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Set !Description !Cards in Set !Size |- |Base set | |351 |2.5 x 3.5 inches |- |Bazooka Official Signals | |12 |6.25 x 2.875 inches |- |} ==Hockey== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Set !Description !Cards in Set !Size |- |Base set | |176 |2.5 x 3.5 inches |- |} ==Basketball== Topps issued one set featuring the two professional basketball leagues, the National Basketball Association and the American Basketball Association, playing during the 1972-1973 season. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |- !Set !Description !Cards in Set !Size |- |Base set | |264 |2.5 x 3.5 inches |- |} ==References== * Beckett, Dr. James et al.
