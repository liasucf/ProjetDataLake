Downie, nicknamed Downie David, (born 1958 in San Francisco) is a multilingual Paris-based American non-fiction author, crime novelist and journalist who writes most often about culture, food and travel. ==Biography== A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Downie took a master's degree in Italian from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he was a Kenyon Scholar and University Fellow. After working in the early 1980s as a translator, interpreter and press officer in Milan, he moved to Paris. His writing reflects an abiding interest in French and Italian culture, politics, food and language. His articles have appeared in about 50 publications, print and online, including The Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Bon App\u00e9tit, Gourmet, Gastronomica, The Art of Eating, Australian Financial Review, Salon.com, Epicurious.com and Concierge.com. He has acted as Paris correspondent, contributing editor or European editor for a number of publications, including Appellation, Art & Antiques and Departures. His writing has also appeared in anthologies, among them The Collected Traveler volumes on Paris, Southwest France and Central Italy. In 1997, Downie's crime novel La tour de l'immonde, about violence and murder in central Paris and its banlieue, was published in Paris within the fiction novel collection Le Poulpe. His first non-fiction book in English, Enchanted Liguria also appeared in 1997. It was translated the following year in Italy under the title La Liguria incantata. His illustrated book on the contemporary cooking of Rome, Cooking the Roman Way, was listed among the top ten cookbooks of 2002 by The Chicago Tribune, Boston Globe and San Francisco Chronicle. Cooking the Roman Way is full of anecdotes about the names, hidden meanings and origins of Italian foods; useful notes explain the difference between farro and spelt and the existence and uses of the quinto quarto (\"fifth quarter\") of butchered animals. Downie's book Paris, Paris (first edition 2005) explores the sites of Paris, from the Ile Saint-Louis to Les Halles and the parks of Montsouris and Buttes Chaumont. Paris, Paris includes insights on Georges Pompidou, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Coco Chanel. The book was reissued in April 2011 as part of the Armchair Traveler series at Broadway Books (Random House). European pilgrimage routes are another field of interest for Downie. Together with his wife, the photographer Alison Harris, he walked 1,100 kilometers across France following sections of the Way of Saint James. A website documenting this journey is under construction, and Downie has written a book about it titled Paris to the Pyrenees: A Skeptic Pilgrim Walks the Way of Saint James. The updated 2011 edition of Paris, Paris includes a new chapter (titled \"Hit the Road Jacques\") on the Way of Saint James in Paris. Among Downie's food- and wine-related books are three volumes in the Terroir Guides series, published by The Little Bookroom, and dedicated to the food and wine of the Italian Riviera (and Genoa), Rome and Burgundy. In 2011, another book by Downie about Rome was published: Quiet Corners of Rome. Paris, Paris was also reissued in 2011 and was reprinted six times in the first nine months. Downie's second crime novel, Paris City of Night, a Hitchcock-style thriller involving a putative terrorist plot to destroy parts of Paris, was released in 2009. Downie is a tour guide and co-owner of Paris Paris Tours. ==Works== *1995: Un'altra Parigi, nove passeggiate insolite nella Ville Lumi\u00e8re (with Ulderico Munzi) *1995: The Irreverent Guide to Amsterdam *1997: Enchanted Liguria: A Celebration of the Culture, Lifestyle and Food of the Italian Riviera (Rizzoli International) **Italian translation, 1998: La Liguria incantata: Cultura, stile di vita, cucina della Riviera ligure.
