    "text": "Guillaume de Chartres (Guillielmus de Carnoto, Willemus de Carnoto), (c. 1178 \u2013 1219) was a grand master of the Knights Templar from 1210 \u2013 26 August 1218. He was the son of Milo IV, the Count of Bar-sur-Seine. In 1210, Guillaume de Chartres assisted at the coronation of Jean de Brienne as King of Jerusalem. In 1211, he arbitrated between Leo I of Armenia and the Templars, regarding the castle of Bagras. During his rule, the order flourished in Spain, achieving important victories against the Moors. He had contact with the Mongols under Genghis Khan and was accused of treason as a result. Guillaume died in 1219 of pestilence, (possibly endemic typhus), as a consequence of being wounded during the siege of Damietta, in Seborga in the Holy Land. == References == === Sources === * * Category:1218 deaths Category:Grand Masters of the Knights Templar Category:Christians of the Fifth Crusade Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People from Aube Category:13th-century French people ",
