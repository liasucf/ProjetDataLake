However he is one of the stronger brassmen in jazz of the 1990s and plays quite well on this set ... The music is straightahead but occasionally as unpredictable as the repertoire\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Antoine Roney except where noted # \"Melchizedek\" \u2212 7:30 # \"A Breath of Seth Air\" \u2212 6:58 # \"Black People Suffering\" \u2212 6:35 # \"28, Rue Pigalle\" \u2212 5:47 # \"Lost\" (Jacky Terrasson) \u2212 3:48 # \"People\" (Jule Styne, Bob Merrill) \u2212 8:26 # \"Gone\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, DuBose Heyward) \u2212 6:28 # \"Wives and Lovers\" (Burt Bacharach, Hal David) \u2212 6:47 == Personnel == *Wallace Roney \u2212 trumpet *Antoine Roney \u2212 tenor saxophone *Jacky Terrasson \u2212 piano *Peter Washington \u2212 bass *Eric Allen \u2212 drums == References == Category:1991 albums Category:Wallace Roney albums Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio Category:Muse Records albums ",
