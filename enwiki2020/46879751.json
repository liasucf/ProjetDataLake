    "text": "This is a list of former high school athletic conferences in the Southwest Region of Ohio, as designated by the OHSAA. If a conference had members that span multiple regions, the conference is placed in the article of the region most of its former members hail from. Because the names of localities and their corresponding high schools do not always match and because there is often a possibility of ambiguity with respect to either the name of a locality or the name of a high school, the following table gives both in every case, with the locality name first, in plain type, and the high school name second in boldface type. The school's team nickname is given last. ==Brown County League== The BCL was one of the local small-school county leagues in Southwest Ohio. Consolidation reduced the number of teams to five by 1967, and in 1970 these five joined with the Adams and Highland county leagues to form the Southern Hills Athletic League. * Aberdeen Pirates (1930s\u201353, consolidated into Ripley-Union-Lewis-Huntington) * Decatur Buldogs (1930s\u201362, consolidated into Eastern Brown) * Fayetteville-Perry Rockets (1930s\u201370, to Southern Hills) * Georgetown G-Men (1930s\u201370, to Southern Hills) * Hamersville Hornets (1930s\u201367, consolidated into Western Brown) * Higginsport Wildcats (1930s\u201353, consolidated into Ripley-Union-Lewis-Huntington) * Mount Orab Mounties (1930s\u201367, consolidated into Western Brown) * Ripley-Union-Lewis-Huntington Bluejays (1930s\u201370, Ripley before 1953, to Southern Hills) * Russellville Ramblers (1930s\u201362, consolidated into Eastern Brown) * Sardinia Zephyrs (1930s\u201362, consolidated into Eastern Brown) * Sardinia Eastern Brown Warriors (1962\u201370, to Southern Hills) * Mount Orab Western Brown Broncos (1967\u201370, to Southern Hills) ==Butler County League== * Fairfield Indians (<1925-53, to Mid-Miami League)1 * Darrtown Hanover Eagles (<1925-56, consolidated into Talawanda) * Monroe Lemon-Monroe Hornets (<1925-51, to Little 6 League and Mid-Miami League)2 * Wetherington Liberty Lions (<1925-59, consolidated into Liberty-Union) * Oxford McGuffey Green Wave (<1925-56, consolidated into Talawanda) * Okeana Morgan Township Mustangs (<1925-53, Okeana before 1942, consolidated into Ross) * Reily Bluebirds (<1925-65, to Southwestern Ohio) * Ross Rams (<1925-65, to SWOL)3, 4 * 'Seven Mile Panthers (<1925-65, to SWOL)3, 4 * Shandon Spartans (<1925-42, consolidated into Morgan Township) * Somerville Eagles (<1925-44, consolidated into Stewart) * Oxford Stewart Tigers (<1925-56, consolidated into Talawanda) * Trenton Trojans (<1925-65, to SWOL) * West Chester Liberty-Union Thunderbirds (<1925-59, Union before 1959, to SWOL) * Jacksonburg Wayne Warriors (<1925-58, consolidated into Seven Mile) * New Miami Vikings (1954-65, to SWOL)5 * Oxford Talawanda Braves (1956-59, to SWOL)3 # Concurrent with MML 1951-53. # Concurrent with Little 6 League 1939-51. # Concurrent with Little Southwestern League 1956-59. # Concurrent with SWOL 1959-65. # Concurrent with SWOL 1960-65. ==Cincinnati Public League/Interscholastic Athletic Association of Cincinnati== The Interscholastic Athletic Association was founded March 23, 1896, and continued for several years with both public and private high schools until 1931, when it rebranded itself as the Public High School League. Now encompassing solely the public high schools in Cincinnati, the league lasted until 1985, when reshuffling of city and suburban Cincinnati high schools took place, which led to the formation of the Cincinnati Hills League, Eastern Metro Conference, Metro County Conference, and Western Metro Conference. * Cincinnati Courter Tech Cavaliers (1896\u20131973, was Cincinnati Tech until 1923, then Central Tech until 1960, school closed) * Cincinnati Franklin Preparatory Falcons (1896\u20131926, school burned down and closed) * Cincinnati Hughes Big Red (1896\u20131985, to Western Metro) * Cincinnati Walnut Hills Eagles (1896\u20131985, to Metro County) * Cincinnati Woodward Bulldogs (1896\u201385, to Western Metro) * Covington (KY) Central Bulldogs (1898\u20131911, dropped Ohio competition) * Cincinnati Ohio Military Cadets (1898\u20131910, to Independents, school closed 1951) * Cincinnati St. Xavier Conquistadors (1898\u20131931, to Greater Catholic) * Cincinnati Withrow Tigers (1919\u201385, to Eastern Metro) * Cincinnati East Tech Engineers (1923\u201353, school closed) * Cincinnati Western Hills Mustangs (1928\u201385, to Metro County) * Cincinnati Aiken Falcons (1962\u201385, to Metro County) * Cincinnati Taft Senators (1965\u201385, to Metro County) * Cincinnati Academy of Physical Education (CAPE) Crusaders (1980\u201385, to Cincinnati Hills) ==Clinton County League== This small-school county league is another that hosted members from outside their borders. In this case, Harveysburg from Warren County joined a few years before the conference ended, as the school would merge with three Clinton County schools to become Clinton-Massie. The school would actually be based in Harveysburg until a new school was built near Clarksville, in Clinton County. Blanchester was not included in the 1959\u201360 standings, due to growing to a AA-sized school by annexing Jefferson, but were allowed back into league play the following season. Blanchester and Clinton-Massie would concurrently play in the CCL and Fort Ancient Valley Conference for the 1964\u201365 school year, after which the other two CCL schools consolidated into East Clinton, who would join the FAVC nine years later. * Ogden Adams Eagles (pre\u20131933\u201363, consolidated into Clinton Massie) * Blanchester Wildcats (pre\u20131931\u201365, to Fort Ancient Valley Conference) * Clarksville Indians (pre\u20131931\u201363, consolidated into Clinton-Massie) * Midland Jefferson Blue Jays (pre\u20131931\u201359, consolidated into Blanchester) * Kingman Bulldogs (pre\u20131931\u201363, consolidated into Clinton-Massie) * Martinsville Rockets (pre\u20131931\u201363, consolidated into Wilmington) * New Vienna Tigers (pre\u20131931\u201363, consolidated into New Kenton) * Port William Bulldogs (pre\u20131931\u201363, consolidated into Wilmington) * Sabina Golden Eagles (pre\u20131931\u201365, consolidated into East Clinton) * Lees Creek Simon Kenton Tigers (was Wayne before 1953, pre\u20131931\u201363, consolidated into New Kenton) * Harveysburg Tigers (from Warren County, 1960\u201363, consolidated into Clinton- Massie) * Harveysburg/Clarksville Clinton-Massie Falcons (1963\u201365, to Fort Ancient Valley Conference) * New Vienna New Kenton Tigers (1963\u201365, consolidated into East Clinton) ==Cross County League== One of the short-lived conferences resulting from realignment in the Cincinnati area, the league merged into the Queen City Conference superconference in 1989. * Batavia Amelia Barons (1985\u201389, to Queen City) * Forest Park Chargers (1985\u201389, to Queen City) * Cincinnati McNicholas Rockets (1985\u201389, to Queen City) * Norwood Indians (1985\u201389, to Queen City) * Cincinnati Northwest Indians (1985\u201389, to Queen City) * Cincinnati Walnut Hills Eagles (1985\u201389, to Queen City) ==Darby Valley League== The DVL was formed in 1956, as the Madison County League was reduced through consolidation from nine schools to four over a two year period, forcing the schools to seek other schools to compete with. Growing from its five initial schools, the conference grew to 11 schools by 1963, but never achieved any sense of stability, as schools joined and left for other conferences throughout its existence. The conference folded in 1977, as five of its members left for other leagues at the same time. * Ashville-Harrison Broncos1 (1956\u201362, consolidated into Teays Valley) * Jamestown Greeneview Rams2 (1956\u201377, to Kenton Trace Conference) * Newport Madison-South Lions3 (1956\u201373, consolidated into Madison-Plains) * North Lewisburg Triad Cardinals4 (1956\u201374, to West Central Ohio League) * West Jefferson Roughriders3 (1956\u201363, to Franklin County League) * Plain City Jonathan Alder Pioneers6 (1957\u201377, to Central Buckeye League) * Mount Sterling The Plains Blue Devils (1957\u201373, consolidated into Madison-Plains) * Cedarville Indians (1961\u201377, to Kenton Trace Conference) * West Liberty-Salem Tigers (1961\u201367, to Logan County League) * Yellow Springs Bulldogs (1961\u201377) * Ashville Teays Valley Vikings (1962\u201364, to South Suburban League) * Mechanicsburg Indians (1963\u201374, to West Central Ohio League) * South Charleston Southeastern Trojans (1963\u201377, to Kenton Trace Conference) * Xenia Woodrow Wilson Cadets (1972\u201377) * London Madison-Plains Golden Eagles5 (1974\u201377, to South Central Ohio League) * Dayton Jefferson Broncos (1975\u201377) # Concurrent with Pickaway County League 1956\u201361. # Concurrent with Greene County League 1956\u201361. # Concurrent with Madison County League 1956\u201357. # Concurrent with Champaign County League 1956\u201361. # Concurrent with South Central Ohio League 1974\u201375. # Concurrent with Central Buckeye League 1976\u201377) ==Eastern Hills League== This conference began as Milford and New Richmond, kicked out of the Clermont County League after becoming exempt schools, joined with neighbors from far eastern Hamilton County. The league ended in 1985, as major realignment took place in the Cincinnati area. * Indian Hill Braves (1957\u201385, to Cincinnati Hills League) * Loveland Tigers (1957\u201385, to Cincinnati Hills League) * Madeira Mustangs (1957\u201385, to Cincinnati Hills League) * Mariemont Warriors (1957\u201385, to Cincinnati Hills League) * Milford Eagles (1957\u201385, to Eastern Metro Conference) * New Richmond Lions (1957\u201369, to Clermont County League) * Deer Park Wildcats (1963\u201385, to Cincinnati Hills League) * Montgomery Sycamore Aviators (1965\u201385, to Eastern Metro Conference) * Glen Este Trojans (1967\u201385, to Eastern Metro Conference) ==Eastern Metro Conference== One of the short- lived conferences resulting from realignment in the Cincinnati area, the league merged into the Queen City Conference superconference in 1989. * Cincinnati Anderson Redskins (1985\u201389, to Queen City) * Cincinnati Glen Este Trojans (1985\u201389, to Queen City) * Milford Eagles (1985\u201389, to Greater Miami) * Cincinnati Sycamore Aviators (1985\u201389, to Greater Miami) * Cincinnati Turpin Spartans (1985\u201389, to Queen City) * Cincinnati Withrow Tigers (1985\u201389, to Queen City) ==Fort Ancient Valley Conference== The FAVC started in 1964, as schools from the dwindling Clinton County League joined with the Warren County League, by 1999 the league became a superconference in the Southwest Region, as a large chunk of the Queen City Conference joined to help form two divisions. A later expansion took place in 2006, as the Mid-Miami League folded. However, this aggressive expansion also led to the conference's demise, as the schools decided to split into the Eastern Cincinnati Conference and Southwest Ohio Conference in 2012. * Blanchester Wildcats (1964\u20131992, to Southern Buckeye Conference) * Clarksville Clinton-Massie Falcons (1964\u20131977, to Kenton Trace Conference) * Kings Mill Kings Knights (1964\u20132012, to Eastern Cincinnati Conference) * Morrow Little Miami Panthers (1964\u20132012, to Southwest Ohio Conference) * Mason Comets (1964\u20132007, to Greater Miami Conference) * Springboro Panthers (1964\u20131998, to Mid-Miami League) * Waynesville Spartans (1964\u20131977, to Kenton Trace Conference) * Lees Creek East Clinton Astros (1974\u20131977, to Kenton Trace Conference) * Lockland Panthers (1977\u20131980, to Hamilton County League) * Hamilton Ross Rams (1977\u20132012, to Southwest Ohio Conference) * Middletown Madison Mohawks (1979\u20131984, to Southwestern Buckeye Conference) * Goshen Warriors (1986\u20132004, to Southern Buckeye Conference) * Norwood Indians (1993\u20132012, to Southern Buckeye Conference) * Wilmington Hurricanes (1992\u20132012, to South Central Ohio League) * Lebanon Warriors (1997\u20132003, to Mid-Miami League) * Loveland Tigers (1997\u20132012, Eastern Cincinnati Conference) * Batavia Amelia Barons (1999\u20132010, to Southern Buckeye Conference) * Cincinnati Anderson Redskins (1999\u20132012, to Eastern Cincinnati Conference) * Cincinnati Glen Este Trojans (1999\u20132012, to Eastern Cincinnati Conference) * Harrison Wildcats (1999\u20132012, to Southwest Ohio Conference) * Cincinnati Northwest Knights (1999\u20132012, to Southwest Ohio Conference) * Cincinnati Turpin Spartans (1999\u20132012, to Eastern Cincinnati Conference) * Cincinnati Walnut Hills Eagles (2003\u20132012, to Eastern Cincinnati Conference) * Cincinnati Winton Woods Warriors (1999\u20132012) * Trenton Edgewood Cougars (2006\u20132012, to Southwest Ohio Conference) * Cincinnati Mount Healthy Fighting Owls (2006\u20132012, to Southwest Ohio Conference) * Oxford Talawanda Braves (2006\u20132012, to Southwest Ohio Conference) * Milford Eagles (2007\u20132012, to Eastern Cincinnati Conference) ===Football divisions=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ |- style=\"background:#ccf;\" ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Fort Ancient Valley Conference Divisions (1999\u20132012) |- ! ! ! |- | Amelia (1999\u20132006) | Amelia (2006\u20132010) | Edgewood (2006\u20132012) |- | Anderson | Goshen (1999\u20132005) | Mount Healthy (2006\u20132012) |- | Glen Este | Kings | Northwest (2006\u20132012) |- | Harrison | Lebanon (1999\u20132001) | Norwood (2006\u20132012) |- | Mason (1999\u20132007) | Little Miami | Ross (2006\u20132012) |- | Northwest (1999\u20132003) | Loveland (1999\u20132003) | Talawanda (2006\u20132012) |- | Turpin (1999\u20132003) | Northwest (2003\u20132006) | |- | Winton Woods | Norwood (1999\u20132006) | |- | Loveland (2003\u20132012) | Ross (1999\u20132006) | |- | Walnut Hills (2003\u20132006) | Turpin (2003\u20132012) | |- | Milford (2007\u20132012) | Walnut Hills (2006\u20132012) | |- | | Wilmington | |} ==Girls Greater Catholic League== Conference Website: http://ggcl.gclsports.com/ The Girls' Greater Catholic League merged with the Greater Catholic League under one banner in 2013. * Cincinnati Marian Roadrunners (1969\u20131981, merged with Purcell and Regina High Schools) * Cincinnati McAuley Mohawks (1969\u20132013) * Cincinnati Mother of Mercy Bobcats (1969\u20132013) * Cincinnati Mount Notre Dame Cougars (formerly Mountaineers) (1969\u20132013) * Cincinnati Our Lady of Angels Angels (1969\u20131984, merged with Roger Bacon High School) * Cincinnati Regina (1969\u20131978) * Cincinnati Academy of the Sacred Heart (1969\u20131970) * Cincinnati Seton Saints (1969\u20132013) * Evendale St. Rita Lions (1969\u2013?) * Cincinnati St. Ursula Bulldogs (1969\u20132013) * Cincinnati Summit Country Day Silver Knights (1969\u20131978) * Cincinnati Ursuline Academy Lions (formerly Hornets) (1969\u20132013) ==Greater Miami Valley Conference== The Greater Miami Valley Conference began operation during the 1982\u201383 school year but folded at the conclusion of the 2000\u201301 school year when the league merged with the Western Ohio League, forming the Greater Western Ohio Conference.

They were joined by Greenville from the Southwestern Buckeye League and Troy, which withdrew from the Western Ohio League. Tecumseh left the league at the conclusion of the 1989\u201390 school year and was replaced with West Carrollton from the Mid-Miami League.
