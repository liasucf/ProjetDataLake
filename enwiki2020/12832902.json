Gerardo wears an open leather jacket, revealing his muscular torso. The backup dancers wear white T-shirts under their oversized suit jackets. The video's intro consists of the singer and two back-up dancers squatting in front of a skyscraper with their backs to the camera. Near the end of the video, Gerardo takes his jacket off. The bilingual version of the video also details Gerardo's encounter with his date's parents, who appear less than thrilled with Gerardo. The video was nominated for two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Male Video and Best New Artist. Gerardo's real-life father played his girlfriend's father in the video. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !Chart (1991)[ Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - Gerardo] !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia (ARIA Charts) |align=\"center\"|87 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|7 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot Rap Tracks |align=\"center\"|2 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Year- end chart (1991) !Position |- |US Top Pop Singles (Billboard) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|89 |} ==Parodies== \"Weird Al\" Yankovic recorded a parody entitled \"Taco Grande\" about a man who visits a Mexican restaurant, featuring Cheech Marin speaking rapid Spanish in the bridge. (Ironically, Marin, who is not fluent in Spanish, needed help from a Spanish-speaking record company secretary to record his part.) It was released on his 1992 album Off the Deep End. This parody uses the English language more than Spanish. Saturday Night Live featured a skit showing \"one-hit wonder\" artists of the past. Among them was Gerardo (portrayed by Horatio Sanz) who addressed himself as \"Rico Suave\" as if it were his real name. A Pinky and the Brain episode featured a plotline in which the Brain created a new alter-ego for Pinky, \"Pinky Suavo\" to hypnotize the world. Sonic references the song in a promotional comic for the Sonic the Hedgehog game. ==References== Category:1990 debut singles Category:1991 singles Category:Spanglish songs Category:1990 songs ",
