In order to get the patent, however, the inventor must submit a declaration supported by evidence that he or she conceived of the invention before the third-party publication. The inventor must also provide evidence that he or she was diligent in either reducing the invention to practice or in filing the patent application. After claiming is not available in applications examined under the Leahy\u2013Smith America Invents Act, with narrow exceptions relating to disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor or by someone who had obtained the subject matter from the inventor or a joint inventor.35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 as amended by the Leahy\u2013Smith America Invents Act ==Example== On December 28, 1995, a patent application by Synteni (now Incyte Genomics) WO/95/35505 was published describing a microarray invention.
