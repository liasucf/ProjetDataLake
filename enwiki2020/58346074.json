They are primarily found mostly on the graves of Lor, Bakhtiari and Qa\u0161q\u0101\u02bei nomads in the southwestern region of Iran. ==The lion in Bakhtiari beliefs== The lion (shir) is often presented in Bakhtiari oral and folklore legends as a real and wild animal. The Iranian lion (Panthera Leo Persica) was the size of the Iranian panther. This breed of lion is extinct. However, this lion lived in the regions such as the Arjan Plain (\u062f\u0634\u062a \u0627\u0631\u0698\u0646) (located about 60 kilometers to the west of Shiraz), in the mountain of Zagros and in the region of Khuzestan. ==Characteristics== In fact, the lion stones are statues that were made by stonemasons and placed at the graves of people from the Bakhtiari tribe in the past. The great difference in the number of these stone lions in various cemeteries could be an indication of the wealth of the individuals whose graves they mark and the sanctity of a particular burial ground. ==Today's Effects== Today Stone lions have an important and enduring significance. In the absence of a written history, they are one way in which the Ba\u1e35ti\u0101ris are able to celebrate their past. Songs and traditions, such as traditional lamentations (g\u0101geriva). ==Footnotes== ==References== *Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, Lion Tombstones. Originally Published: April 7, 2008 *Khosronejad, P.
