In 1857 he took over the family business, and opened a new branch at Wickham, also merging with a Clyde-based firm. He retired from the business in 1884. On 25 March 1859 he married Jemima Fergus Douglas, with whom he had four children. After her death he remarried Clara Henderson, her sister, and had a further seven children.
