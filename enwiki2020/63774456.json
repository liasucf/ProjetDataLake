It is named after engineer and businessman Edmund B. Hayes whose bequest funded the remodeling of the facility for university use. ==History== Edmund B. Hayes Hall was first built in 1874 to house the Insane Department of the Erie County Almshouse. In 1893, the building was converted into a county hospital that contained 400 beds. The land that the hall is on would be acquired by the University of Buffalo in 1909. By 1927, the University was renovating the building to convert it into a building suitable to hold classes. On February 22, 1928 the building would be dedicated by the University. At the dedication, University at Buffalo chancellor Samuel Capen stated he hoped the building would become a central image to the university saying \"from its nature and its central position this building is destined to be the focus of the life of the University for many years, perhaps for many generations. It will be preeminently the visual symbol of the University both to the members of the institution and to the community at large.\" The building underwent $45 million in renovations between 2011 and 2016. It was listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 2016. Edmund B. Hayes Hall now serves as the School of Architecture and Planning at the University. ==Gallery== Hayes Hall By Night - 20191222.jpg|Clock tower at night, 2019 UBsouth campus wide shot.jpg|Crosby Hall with Hayes Hall in the background, 2012 File:Hayes hall on UB south campus.jpg|Hayes Hall, 2012 ==References== Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1874 Category:Buildings and structures in Buffalo, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Buffalo, New York Category:1874 establishments in New York (state) ",
