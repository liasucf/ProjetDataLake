While studying in Rome after the Second World War, Velikonja learned his father had been murdered after a show trial in Slovenia. Velikonja met his future wife, Matilde (Tilly) Rus, a few years later in Trieste, where she was working as an English teacher. They married in Rome in 1950. He emigrated to the United States in 1955, where he briefly worked as a manual laborer before continuing his academic career. Later in his life, after retirement and extensive travels, he returned to Slovenia. His brother Tine Velikonja (1929\u20132010) was a surgeon and president of the New Slovene Covenant () non-Partisan veterans' organization for many years.Tine Velikonja (1929\u20132010). 2010.

However, he instead studied geography in Rome from 1941 to 1942, then in Ljubljana from 1942 to 1944, and then again in Rome from 1945 to 1948, where he received his doctorate in 1948 with a dissertation on the Vipava Valley. He taught at the Slovene normal school and classical high school in Trieste from 1947 to 1955, where he wrote and published several Slovene textbooks. He also edited a number of geographical works during this period. After emigrating to the United States in 1955, Velikonja worked for the Cleveland Twist Drill Company. He then continued his studies in Chicago, and taught geography at the University of Chicago in 1958 (while also working for the Chicago Department of City Planning), at Elmhurst College (1958\u20131959), at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (1959\u20131964), and then at the University of Washington from 1964 onwards,Zbornik Svobodne Slovenija. 1968.

His research took him to Canada and Europe several times, and he presented his work at various academic congresses from 1961 onward. His professional membership included the Society for Slovene Studies and the Italian Geographical Society, and he won a number of awards for his research. He retired in 1993. Velikonja's fields of research were political and social geography. He especially studied Slovene immigration to the United States, and he promoted cooperation between researchers in Slovenia and the United States as well as faculty and researcher exchanges. The Joseph Velikonja Undergraduate Prize for works on Slovene studies is named after him.Society for Slovene Studies: Joseph Velikonja Undergraduate Prize The University of Washington issued the award for the best undergraduate paper on Slovene studies in 2013.
