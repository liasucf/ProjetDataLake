He was a son-in-law of Francisco Ribalta, whose painting style was similar; as was that of his brother-in-law, Juan Ribalta, leading to a misattribution of many of his paintings. He was virtually forgotten until these errors were corrected. == Biography == His father, Salvador, was a painter from Arag\u00f3n who came to Valencia just before Vicente's birth. His mother, Jer\u00f3nima Comes, was the daughter of Jer\u00f3nimo Comes, also a painter. It is likely that his father worked, at least temporarily, for Francisco Ribalta. In 1616, he was inscribed on the list of the College of Painters. After 1620, he worked in Segorbe, together with Juan Ribalta and Abd\u00f3n Casta\u00f1eda. The three also created an altarpiece in Andilla, completed in 1626, and painted two images (now lost) for the chapel of the Communion at the Segorbe Cathedral. The Apotheosis of San Bruno at the (now at the ), was originally attributed to Francisco Ribalta; although it now appears to have been done by Castell\u00f3.Benito Domenech (1987) He is also credited with completing the Virgin of Porta-Coeli at the Porta Coeli Charterhouse (now at the Museo de Bellas Artes de Valencia), which was begun by the elder Ribalta in 1625. Both of the Ribaltas died in 1628, and Castell\u00f3 took over the family workshop. In 1630, he was back in Segorbe, where he engaged in a challenge, from Pedro Garc\u00eda Ferrer, to create a painting on the theme Story of the Innocents, entirely of their own invention; nothing copied from other sources. The loser would forfeit fifty Libras (Pounds).Kowal, David The last reference to Castell\u00f3 is in 1635, from the papers of the Bishop of Segorbe, , regarding a commission for a painting of The Last Supper. Castell\u00f3's works may be distinguished by exaggerated foreshortenings with longer figures. His brushstrokes also lacked the precision of the Ribaltas' and he used darker colors for backgrounds.Cinco siglos de pintura valencianaP\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez These features have helped to separate his works from theirs as well as some works formerly attributed to Pedro de Orrente. ==References== ==Sources == * Benito Dom\u00e9nech, Fernando (1987), Los Ribalta y la pintura valenciana de su tiempo, cat\u00e1logo de la exposici\u00f3n, Valencia-Madrid, * Cinco siglos de pintura valenciana.
