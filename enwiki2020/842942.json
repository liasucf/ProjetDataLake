    "text": "Margaret of Burgundy (; 1290 \u2013 30 April 1315) was Queen of France and Navarre as the first wife of Louis X of France (and Louis I of Navarre) . ==Life== Margaret was a member of the ducal House of Burgundy, a branch of the Capetian dynasty. She was the eldest daughter of Robert II, Duke of Burgundy (1248\u20131306) and Agnes of France (1260\u20131327), the youngest daughter of Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence.Anne Echols and Marty Williams, An Annotated Index of Medieval Women, (Markus Weiner Publishing Inc., 1992), 300. In 1305, Margaret married her first cousin once removed, Louis I, King of Navarre, who in November 1314 ascended to the French throne as Louis X of France.Anne Echols, 300. They had one daughter, Joan (born 1312, died 1349). Early in 1314, Margaret was allegedly caught in an act of adultery in the Tour de Nesle Affair. Her sister-in-law Isabella of France was a witness against her, and Margaret was imprisoned for the last two years of her life, along with her sister-in-law Blanche of Burgundy. Margaret was confined at Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard and after poor treatment caught a cold and died.Jim Bradbury, The Capetians: Kings of France, 987-1328, (Continuum Books, 2007), 277. ==Legacy== Margaret's daughter, Joan, later became queen regnant of Navarre as Joan II (1311\u20131349). Her paternity was under doubt because of her mother's alleged adultery. In 1361, Margaret's succession rights became important in the premature death of Philip I, Duke of Burgundy (her grandnephew), since the closest Burgundian heirs were descendants of Margaret and of her sister, Joan the Lame. Margaret's grandson and heir Charles II of Navarre claimed the duchy on the basis of primogeniture, but Joan the Lame's son John II of France on the basis of proximity, being one generation closer to the Burgundian dukes. As king, John ruled in his own favor, and became Duke of Burgundy, later bestowing the Duchy upon his son, Philip the Bold. ==In fiction== Margaret is portrayed in Le Roi de Fer and La Reine \u00c9trangl\u00e9e, two 1955 novels in Maurice Druon's Les Rois Maudits (The Accursed Kings) series of historical novels. She was played by in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Filli\u00e8res in the 2005 adaptation. Margaret appears as a pivotal character in the second season of the historical drama series Knightfall. She is portrayed by Clementine Nicholson. ==References== Category:1290 births Category:1315 deaths Category:French queens consort Category:Navarrese royal consorts Category:Countesses of Champagne Category:House of Burgundy Category:House of Capet Category:Murdered royalty Category:13th-century French people Category:13th-century French women Category:14th-century French people Category:14th-century French women Category:People convicted of adultery ",
