    "text": "Chaika Automotive Sport Complex (), also known as Autodrome Chaika (), is a motorsport racetrack in Ukraine, situated in Chaiky village, near the capital city Kyiv. The circuit was built in 1975., when the country was a part of Soviet Union, since the foundation of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Automobile de l'Ukraine (FAU) in 1993, it hosts various regional racing series, such as Ukrainian Touring Championship and Superbike Ukraine. == History == === Soviet era === The development of the circuit began in 60's by Soviet DOSAAF, a society for cooperation with army, aviation and navy, which also built an airport next to the track, carrying the same name. The configuration was based on various similar autodromes of that time, the project was finished in 1971. The construction began in 1973, and when it was finished, it became the best circuit in USSR. Chaika was very popular due to very fast sectors of the 'big ring' and corners 2-4, that were known as so-called 'ears'. The track was pretty difficult and dangerous, there was no runoffs, very close Armco barriers, poor quality asphalt and bad landscaping. June 27, 1975 circuit saw its first races in different classes, which were touring car racing and Soviet Formula One, after that the dirt speedway was added to complex as a second construction phase.https://www.racingcircuits.info/europe/chayka.html In late seventies the track started hosting the prestigious series, called Socialist Nations Friendship Cup, but after Polish driver Christian Grokhovsky's fatal crash it was decided being unsafe and the series moved to Bi\u0137ernieki Complex Sports Base in Riga. Without the famous championship racing organization quality fell, there were a rare races with usually small amount of spectators. There were several attempts to change the bad asphalt, but they've made the situation even worse. === Independent Ukraine === After the dissolution of the USSR Defense Assistance Society of Ukraine became the circuit's owner. They've had no money to take a good care of it and started to sell all the equipment to private owners. The safety standarts of the track were very low, so in 1998 it was decided no longer to use the big loop configuration of the track, the start/finish lane was moved and the circuit was left without pitlane. Ukrainian racer Leonid Protasov was chosen as a new head of the circuit. He didn't want a complete circuit redesign, saying \"FIA launches the new safety standarts for racing circuits every year, but the tracks aren't rebuilding each year! Therefore Chaika doesen't need rebuilding as well.\". He just wanted to add a runoff areas and to change asphalt area, but it haven't been done yet. In 2000's the new pitlane was added, as well as the final corner with an entrance to it, also the bleachers for spectators, cafe and hotel were built there. Chaika became an epicenter of the Ukrainian motorsport with its own racing school and to this day hosts national championships. == References == == External links == * kievring.com Category:Sports venues in Kiev Oblast Category:Motorsport in Ukraine Category:Motorsport venues ",
