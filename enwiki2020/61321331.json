The historical reserve consists of two parcels of land located on opposite sides of the Stuart Highway and its road reserve. The parcel on the west side of the highway contains the remains of Ryan Well, a well excavated in the 19th century to provide water to livestock moving along the Overland Telegraph Line, and a car park while the parcel on the east side of the highway contains the remains of a building known as the Glen Maggie Homestead. It first acquired protected area status as a \"a place of historic interest\" declared under section 103 of the Crown Lands Ordinance 1931-1971 on 30 April 1974 by the Australian government in respect to the western parcel of land and was given the name Reserve No. 1343. On 3 May 1974, the eastern parcel of land was added to the reserve. On 30 June 1978, it was declared as Reserve No 1343 (Ryan Well Historical Reserve) under the Territory Parks and Wildlife Act and on 10 September 1979, it was renamed as Ryan Well Historical Reserve.
