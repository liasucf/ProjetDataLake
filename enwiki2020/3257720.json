Virtually every level of football, from amateur and high school to college and the NFL (including the CFL on Canadian Thanksgiving), plays football on Thanksgiving Day (Thursday) or the immediately following holiday weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). ==Early days== Thanksgiving Day football games in the United States are nearly as old as the game\u2014and the organized holiday\u2014themselves. The first Thanksgiving Day football game took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Thanksgiving Day of 1869, less than two weeks after Rutgers defeated Princeton in New Brunswick, New Jersey in what is widely recognized as the first intercollegiate football game in the United States, and only six years after Abraham Lincoln declared the first fixed national Thanksgiving holiday in 1863. On November 17, 1869, the Evening Telegraph newspaper of Philadelphia published the following announcement: \"Foot Ball: A foot-ball match between twenty-two players of the Young America Cricket Club and the Germantown Cricket Club will take place on Thanksgiving Day at 12 1/2 o'clock, on the grounds of the Germantown Club.\" The proximity of Philadelphia to both Rutgers and Princeton invites speculation that this game may have been played under similar rules and perhaps involved some of the same participants, or at least people familiar with the game played at Rutgers, and a second match at Princeton, earlier that month. Princeton played Yale in the New York City area on Thanksgiving Day from 1876 through 1881. The Thanksgiving Day football game became an institutionalized fixture of organized football in 1882, when the Intercollegiate Football Association determined to hold an annual collegiate championship game in New York City on Thanksgiving Day between the two leading teams in the association. Previously, the 'Champion' was to be determined by a team's records over the entire season against all members of the association. For at least the three previous years, the championship had been a matter of dispute as a result of Yale and Princeton playing to scoreless ties on three Thanksgiving Day games in a row. On November 25, 1897, American students of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and the Acad\u00e9mie Julian played a game in Paris, France. This is considered the first American football game ever played in Europe. The introduction of Thanksgiving football is credited with encouraging the Southern United States, which had historically rejected the celebration of Thanksgiving, to embrace the holiday. Robert Tracy McKenzie, a history professor at Wheaton College, remarked: \"I joke\u2014but also sort of mean it seriously\u2014that one of the things that ultimately reconciles Southerners to Thanksgiving is the development of football (...) and well before 1900, the tradition of having football games on Thanksgiving Day is sweeping across the country. And Southerners find out that the holiday isn\u2019t that bad after all.\" The tradition of playing football games on Thanksgiving continues to this day. At the high school level, the tradition is declining rapidly as schools drop their Thanksgiving games and shorten their regular season in favor of playoff tournaments and allowing players to focus on winter sports such as basketball. ==High school football== High school football games played on Thanksgiving are often called a Turkey Day Game or a Turkey Bowl (not to be confused with Turkey bowling), as Americans typically eat turkeys on Thanksgiving, although the title varies with each game. Most commonly these games are between high school football rivalries although in many cases, when poor weather requires a shorter season, the game can be the culmination of league play among a high- school league, in which the winners of this game will be the league champions for the year. (Statewide playoffs were generally rare until the 1970s and 1980s, which allowed for longer regular seasons.) The custom dates back more than 100 years and is particularly prevalent in the Northeast. In most cases, games are contested with kickoff times as early as 9 a.m., allowing the participants to have the rest of the holiday off. This list is sorted alphabetically, first by state, and then by school, with team leading the series listed first wherever possible. State and regional championship tournaments are listed ahead of rivalries. If the rivalry involves two states, the rivalry is listed under the school whose state comes first alphabetically (e.g. a New Jersey-Pennsylvania rivalry is listed under New Jersey). ===California=== ;San Jose Big Bone Game: The only Thanksgiving high school rivalry game to be played west of the state of Missouri, this game dates to 1943 and is played in San Jose, California each Thanksgiving at 11 am. The game pits Abraham Lincoln High School against San Jose High School. The \"Big Bone\" in question is the femur of a cow that was retrieved from a butcher shop. Lincoln leads the series 38\u201324. The game is preceded the week prior with the \"Little Bone Game\", played between the two junior varsity teams. The game has been lopsided in recent years, with Lincoln on an active 22-game winning streak through 2019. ;San Francisco Turkey Bowl: Also in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Turkey Bowl in San Francisco dates back to 1924 and currently is played at Kezar Stadium each Thanksgiving at 11 am. The Turkey Bowl is the city's public high school championship game. Galileo High School has the most overall wins in the game (16) after breaking Lincoln High School's record four-game winning streak in 2009.Drumwright, Steve (November 27, 2008).

Recently, New Canaan went undefeated for 11 straight years from 2002 to 2011, but Darien won 5 straight from 2012 to 2016. The 2017 matchup, marred by the arrests of three Darien starters the day before (all three did not play), was won by New Canaan 27-0. Due to the large crowds that attend the game (up to 10,000 people), it is usually played either in New Canaan's Dunning Stadium (which needs to be temporarily expanded in order to fit the crowds) or Stamford's Boyle Stadium, which can hold 10,000 spectators. ;Guilford vs. Daniel Hand (Madison): Madison split out of what was East Guilford and since these two teams have begun playing annually Guilford has only won 7 of the match-ups, Guilford tends to be a below .500 team whereas Hand is typically a near perfect team.

In the early 1900s the game was played on Thanksgiving Day and when Memorial Stadium was built in 1954 the game was played there until the stadium was demolished in 2000. The games played at Memorial stadium during the 1960s drew an average of 25,000 fans. In 1965, 27,500 fans saw quarterback Kurt Schmoke and team captain Curt Anderson lead City to a 52\u20136 win over Poly. The Thanksgiving tradition ended in 1993 when both City and Poly joined the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association which held its playoffs during the Thanksgiving week, requiring both schools to move their rivalry to a date three weeks earlier. The game is now played at M&T; Bank Stadium, in downtown Baltimore the first week of November. Anderson (City) and Baltimore attorney Warren Brown (Poly) have kept the Turkey Day tradition alive between the two schools by sponsoring a flag football game at 9 am every Thanksgiving morning at Baltimore's Herring Run Park. For the past 30 years any former Poly student, football player or not, faces off against a team made up of former City students. Brown and Anderson no longer play, but their sons do. ===Massachusetts=== In Massachusetts, where high school football is not nearly the draw it is in other parts of the country, the Thanksgiving Day game is a long-standing tradition that brings out thousands of alumni and other fans.

When Xavier has the advantage, the game is played at the Aviator Sports and Events Center on the grounds of Floyd Bennett Field, part of the Gateway National Recreation Area in Brooklyn. ;White Plains Turkey Bowl (abolished): This game between the Catholic high school Archbishop Stepinac High School and public school White Plains High School was played continuously from 1971 to 2012; White Plains High School had played other teams from around the United States as an invitational contest from 1932 to 1970. The game was traditionally played at a \"neutral\" field in White Plains, Parker Stadium; the last five contests were held at Loucks Field on the campus of White Plains High School. White Plains, being a public school, forfeits any regional consolation playoff appearance it may have earned, due to a limit of 10 games for high school football teams in the NYSPHSAA, but does not have to forfeit its appearance in the state championship tournament.Devaney, Kevin Jr. (October 27, 2008). Turkey Bowl: White Plains vs. Stepinac . The Journal News. Retrieved October 5, 2010. The game nonetheless had to be canceled if Stepinac advanced to their respective state championship game or White Plains won a section champions; this did not happen until 2013, when White Plains won a Section 1 title, and it happened again in 2014 and 2015 when Stepinac advanced to the Catholic State Championship both years;Thomson, Josh (November 18, 2014).

Daily Press. Retrieved April 21, 2014. Woodberry Forest vs. Episcopal The longest-running high school football rivalry in the South takes place each year between Woodberry Forest and Episcopal High School of Alexandria, Virginia. The schools first played against each other in 1901 and have competed in over a hundred consecutive games. \"The Game\", as it is known, draws back many alumni and is considered the homecoming game for both schools. The 100th contest, which Woodberry won, took place in 2000, drew nearly 15,000 spectators, and was featured on ESPN. ==\"Turkey Bowl\" games== An informal \"Turkey Bowl\" game in Redmond, Washington Unorganized groups have also been known to partake in American football on Thanksgiving. These informal matches are usually known as a Turkey Bowl (not to be confused with some high school football games that also use the name \"Turkey Bowl\", see above, and with Turkey Bowling). These games are usually unofficiated with a flag football, street football, or touch football format. While the games themselves are not generally nationally known, Turkey Bowls hold importance for those who participate and it is not uncommon for rivalries to last for decades. Turkey Bowls are played by a variety of people including extended families, college fraternities, volunteer fire departments, and local churches across the country which use the day and the game to have fun, exercise and renew old acquaintances. ==College football== Thanksgiving weekend historically marks the end of the college football regular season, before conference championships and bowl games begin play in December (the Army\u2013Navy Game is the lone exception). Today, this is only true for the top- level NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, where it has become a tradition to play a fierce rival on the last week of the regular season. At levels below the Bowl Subdivision, the NCAA begins its championship tournaments either on Thanksgiving weekend (for the Division I FCS championship) or the week before (in the cases of Divisions II and III; the NAIA, a separate body, also begins its tournament at that time). Other college football sanctioning bodies end their seasons well before Thanksgiving. The University of Kansas and University of Missouri played the first of nineteen consecutive Thanksgiving Day football games in Kansas City, Missouri in 1892. After new conference rules that required all games to be played on college campuses, the Thanksgiving Day tradition was temporarily suspended in 1911, but then reinstituted in spurts starting in 1916 and continuing through the 1940s. The University of Michigan made it a tradition to play annual Thanksgiving games, holding 19 such games from 1885 to 1905. The Thanksgiving Day games between Michigan and the Chicago Maroons in the 1890s have been erroneously cited as \"The Beginning of Thanksgiving Day Football.\" Since the Maroons no longer play at the Division I level, the Wolverines now play their modern-day archrivals, the Ohio State Buckeyes, during Thanksgiving weekend. Yale and Princeton began an annual tradition of playing against each other on Thanksgiving Day starting in 1876. From 1945 to 1956, the Burley Bowl pitted two small colleges against each other in an unofficial bowl game. From 1894 to 1953, Case Tech Rough Riders and Western Reserve University Red Cats played each other on Thanksgiving, playing at Cleveland Stadium. The two schools merged in 1970. The Turkey Day Classic, a college football game between Alabama State University and Tuskegee University, has been played on Thanksgiving Day annually from 1924 to 2012 and again since 2016; as such, it has historically been known as the \"Turkey Day Classic.\" It is also the oldest black college football classic, since the two colleges first played each other in 1901. Tuskegee University pulled out of the contest after 2012 (they were replaced by Stillman College in the 2013 contest), and Alabama State did the same from 2013 to 2015, deciding to move its homecoming to the Saturday before Thanksgiving; in both cases, the NCAA football tournaments prompted the schools to move the end of their seasons to before Thanksgiving so that they would be able to compete for the national championship should they qualify. The establishment of the Celebration Bowl for historically black schools allowed the Turkey Day Classic to resume; it was held against conference rivals Mississippi Valley State and Prairie View A&M; in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Another popular black college football classic played on Thanksgiving weekend is the Bayou Classic between Grambling State University and Southern University, which is held the Saturday after Thanksgiving; for the 2017 season only, because of a hurricane earlier in the season, the Labor Day Classic between Texas Southern and Prairie View A&M; was played on Thanksgiving weekend, and the two teams voluntarily agreed to hold that Classic on the same weekend in 2018. Alabama State, Mississippi Valley State, Prairie View A&M;, Texas Southern, Southern and Grambling are all members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. Other prominent college football rivalries that take place over Thanksgiving weekend include: *Auburn Tigers vs. Alabama Crimson Tide (the Iron Bowl) *Ole Miss Rebels vs. Mississippi State Bulldogs (the Battle of the Golden Egg, played on Thanksgiving night from 1998 to 2003 and 2017 to 2019) *LSU Tigers vs. Arkansas Razorbacks (the Battle for the Golden Boot), through 2013 **Arkansas has played Missouri on Thanksgiving weekend since 2014. *Georgia Bulldogs vs. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate) * BYU Cougars vs. Utah Utes (the Holy War, to 2010, again in 2018) *Colorado Buffaloes vs. Nebraska Cornhuskers (Colorado\u2013Nebraska rivalry, through 2010) **Colorado Buffaloes vs. Utah Utes (Rumble in the Rockies, since 2011) **Nebraska Cornhuskers vs. Iowa Hawkeyes (Heroes Game, since 2011) * Oklahoma Sooners vs. Oklahoma State Cowboys (the Bedlam Series through 2016) ** This game was played earlier in the season in 2017 and 2018 *Texas Longhorns vs. Texas A&M; Aggies (the Lone Star Showdown, played on Thanksgiving from 2008 until its end in 2011, also played on Thanksgiving many other times prior to 2008) **Until 2015, Texas hosted a game on Thanksgiving night every year; after the end of the Lone Star Showdown, Texas played against TCU (for the Chancellor's Spurs) in even-numbered years and against Texas Tech in odd-numbered years. **Texas A&M; plays LSU during Thanksgiving week beginning in 2014, with the game being played on Thanksgiving night in 2014 and 2016. (see also: LSU\u2013Texas A&M; football rivalry) *Florida Gators vs. Florida State Seminoles (the Sunshine Showdown) *Notre Dame Fighting Irish vs. USC Trojans (the Jeweled Shillelagh); rivalry is played every year but only scheduled for Thanksgiving weekend when Southern Cal hosts; Southern Cal has hosted on Thanksgiving in even-numbered years since the 1960s. In odd-numbered years, USC typically plays UCLA, while Notre Dame typically plays Stanford. *Clemson Tigers vs. South Carolina Gamecocks (the Palmetto Bowl) *Virginia Tech Hokies vs. Virginia Cavaliers (the Commonwealth Cup, erratically scheduled) *Kentucky Wildcats vs. Tennessee Volunteers (historically the Battle for the Bourbon Barrel; played annually but no longer on Thanksgiving weekend) *Kentucky Wildcats vs. Louisville Cardinals (the Governor's Cup, moved to Thanksgiving weekend starting in 2014) *University of South Florida vs. University of Central Florida (the War on I-4) *Michigan Wolverines vs. Ohio State Buckeyes (The Game), played the Saturday after Thanksgiving. *Arizona vs. Arizona State (Duel in the Desert), played the Friday or Saturday after Thanksgiving. *Minnesota Golden Gophers vs. Wisconsin Badgers (Paul Bunyan's Axe) *North Carolina Tar Heels vs. NC State Wolfpack (North Carolina\u2013NC State football rivalry) *West Point Cadets vs. Naval Academy Midshipmen (the Army\u2013Navy Game; by 2006, it had moved one week, then eventually two weeks after Thanksgiving weekend beginning in 2009, to maintain its status as the last game of the college football regular season) The frequent changing of conferences stemming from the early-2010s realignment of NCAA teams and conferences complicated the numerous rivalries that traditionally play Thanksgiving weekend. While collegiate games have been played on Thanksgiving Day itself (with perhaps the most notable being the Nebraska-Oklahoma game of 1971), the majority of the current traditional Thanksgiving weekend college football games listed above are played on the Friday or Saturday after the holiday, in part to avoid conflicts with the NFL. Texas, as previously mentioned, has had more or less of a permanent spot on the night of the holiday itself since at least 2008.\"College Football Thanksgiving Day and Weekend Schedule for 2010\" Midwest Sports Fans from November 8, 2010 ==Professional football== Professional football teams and leagues have played on Thanksgiving from the start, with pro leagues and teams having played on Thanksgiving since the 1890s. It carried over when Buffalo and Rochester, two members of the New York Pro Football League which had held its championship on Thanksgiving 1919, and the Ohio League, which traditionally held its marquee matchups on Thanksgiving, combined into the NFL upon its founding in 1920, and as such, the NFL has played on Thanksgiving ever since. The Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys have played home games on Thanksgiving since 1934 and 1966, respectively, in a traditional series of NFL games. Beginning in 2006, the NFL added a third game on Thanksgiving night with a rotating host team.Thanksgiving games official page at NFL.com. Retrieved July 21, 2011. The rival American Football League also played on Thanksgiving in the 1960s, as did the All-America Football Conference in the 1940s and the original AFL in 1926. In the Canadian Football League, where games are played on Canadian Thanksgiving, the CFL hosts two games in the Thanksgiving Day Classic; it is one of only two weeks each year in which the CFL plays on a Monday, the other being the Labour Day Classic. The difference between the Thanksgiving and Labour Day games is that the Thanksgiving Day games do not have the same matchups each year; however, like its American counterpart, one of the games has a regular host (in the CFL's case, the Montreal Alouettes). Coincidentally, both the Grey Cup, the CFL's championship game, and the Vanier Cup, the championship of Canadian college football, are both traditionally played on the fourth weekend in November, which amounts to the week before or the week after American Thanksgiving. The World Football League originally planned to hold its 1974 championship game, World Bowl 1, the day after Thanksgiving in 1974; the business failures of the 1974 season led to the league reorganizing the playoff structure and pushing the World Bowl one week back (although the WFL regularly played on Thursdays during the regular season, it instead split its semifinals between the day before Thanksgiving and the day after). Had the United States Football League completed its move to autumn for the 1986 season, it would have played one of its games on Thanksgiving (a game featuring the Tampa Bay Bandits at the Memphis Showboats was scheduled for that night), but the league suspended operations prior to the season and, even if it had survived, the Bandits went bankrupt before the season would have been played. Similarly, the United Football League, which began play in 2009, held its first two UFL Championship Games over Thanksgiving weekend; both the truncated 2011 UFL season and the 2012 UFL season were cut short well before the Thanksgiving holiday due to financial shortfalls. The Fall Experimental Football League had scheduled its championship for the day before Thanksgiving Day 2014, in Brooklyn, but the game was cancelled after the season was shortened. ==References== ==External links== *Webster Groves \u2013 Kirkwood Turkey Day Game Info *Annual Grand Junction Pizza Turkey Day Game - Since 1980 - Dallas, Texas *The Turkey Bowl \u2013 Cleveland, Ohio *Rancho Romero Turkey Bowl \u2013 Alamo, California *\"Beyond Friday Night Lights\" \u2013 SportsShooter.com *\"Rivalry on Thanksgiving menu in Maine\" \u2013 ESPNrise.com Category:History of American football Category:NFL on Thanksgiving Day Category:Thanksgiving (United States) ",
