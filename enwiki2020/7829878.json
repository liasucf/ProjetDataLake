    "text": "Evaldo dos Santos Fabiano (born 18 March 1982), known simply as Evaldo, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Portuguese club S.C.U. Torreense as a left back. ==Club career== Evaldo was born in Rio Piracicaba, Minas Gerais. Having started out professionally with Clube Atl\u00e9tico Paranaense and Democrata Futebol Clube, he moved to Europe in 2003, as he was purchased by FC Porto in Portugal; he spent most of his only season with their reserves. In summer 2004, Evaldo was involved in a transfer that brought compatriot Pepe from C.S. Mar\u00edtimo as he, Antonieliton Ferreira and Tonel all went to Madeira. After a shaky start, he would be an undisputed starter in the following years. Evaldo joined S.C. Braga in the 2008 off-season, after four years in Madeira. With no competition in his position, he only missed one Primeira Liga match in his first year, as the Minho side qualified once again for the UEFA Cup. After helping Braga to its best-ever league finish in the 2009\u201310 campaign (second), Evaldo joined Sporting CP in June 2010, signing a four-year contract worth \u20ac3 million. He made his official debut on 14 August in a 0\u20131 away loss against F.C. Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira; on the 26th, he scored a rare goal \u2013 and through a header \u2013 as the Lions defeated Br\u00f8ndby IF 3\u20130 after losing 0\u20132 at home, thus qualifying for the Europa League's group stage. On 14 July 2012, Evaldo moved to La Liga club Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a in a season-long loan. His first competitive appearance for the Galicians took place on 20 August, as he played the full 90 minutes in a 2\u20130 home win over CA Osasuna, and played 16 overall games during his spell as the campaign went on to end in relegation. In July 2014, after one year with Sporting where he was limited to training, Evaldo agreed terms with Gil Vicente FC. The following year, after suffering top- flight relegation, he joined fellow league team Moreirense F.C. on a one-year deal. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Club Athletico Paranaense players Category:Democrata Futebol Clube players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:FC Porto B players Category:FC Porto players Category:C.S.
