    "text": "The conserved Scala cinema of Siam Square Cinemas in Thailand are popular venues for entertainment. Especially in Bangkok, the movie theaters tend to be multiplex facilities offering many other forms of entertainment besides movies, such as bowling or karaoke, along with restaurants and small shops. The films playing in Thai cinemas are usually first-run Hollywood features, which tend to dominate the box-office scene. There is a burgeoning Thai film industry that is making dozens of films each year that are increasingly popular with local audiences. Films from other Asian countries, such as Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, are popular as well. The movie-theater business in Thailand is led by the Major Cineplex Group, which owns the Major Cineplex chain as well as the EGV chain and operates the Paragon Cineplex at Siam Paragon as well as Thailand's IMAX theaters. Behind the combined Major Cineplex-EGV, which has a 50 percent market share, the SF Group is the No. 2 operator, with a 35 percent share. Smaller chains include Apex in Bangkok's Siam Square, Thana Cineplex, Major Hollywood and UMG. In Chiang Mai, there is the Vista cinema. In Southern Thailand, there is the Coliseum chain. , there were 570 screens in Thailand, with 300 in the Bangkok metropolitan area. Nationwide, the person-to-screen ratio is 170 people per screen, with a 30:1 ratio in Bangkok. ==Ticketing, seating and customs== An assortment of ticket stubs from Bangkok cinemas, circa 2006. Ticket prices range from around 70 baht to 160 baht, depending on the time of day, the day of the week, the location of the theater and the movie being screened. In Bangkok cinemas, the price for new-release films will generally be 140 to 160 baht. Seating is assigned; audience members make their choice of seating on a computer screen at the box office. Online ticketing is available on theater-chain websites. Automated phone booking is available as well. Before the film, the audience must stand for the \"Royal Anthem\", which is accompanied by a montage of images of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Most theaters in Thailand keep the air conditioning very cold; patrons often bring a light sweater or jacket. The EGV chain has \"Gold Class\" cinemas, which have smaller screening rooms fitted with reclining seats, blankets and pillows. Prices for a Gold Class show range from 300 baht to 500 baht. The Major Cineplex chain offers comparable \"Emperor\" class seating, while SF Cinema has \"First Class\" and \"VIP\" screenings and Major Hollywood has \"Star\" seats. Paragon Cineplex has \"Ultra Screen\" theaters. Some cinemas, including Major Cineplex, EGV and Major Hollywood, have sofa-style seating at the back of the auditoriums, intended for couples. Customers who purchase these types of seats may sit in a lounge before the show and may be provided with free drinks or popcorn. Food and drinks may also be ordered and will be served by theater staff as the movie is playing.Holland, Michael. Thai Culture: Movies (retrieved August 19, 2006) ==Language and subtitling== In central Bangkok and cities with many tourists and foreign residents, such as Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Phuket, foreign films (including Hollywood releases) will have the original soundtrack (called \"soundtrack\") with Thai subtitles. Outside of tourism centers and in some suburban Bangkok cinemas, all the foreign films, including Hollywood films, will generally be dubbed into Thai language. Films from other Asian countries, including China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea, often play in Thailand theaters, but the soundtracks will usually be dubbed into Thai. Exceptions to this will be found at the Apex chain theaters in Siam Square and at House cinema on Royal City Avenue. Often, films from Hollywood, such as The Da Vinci Code, as well as films from European countries that feature languages other than English, will have only Thai subtitles. For Thai films, most cinemas in tourism centers will have English subtitles. Exceptions for regional language (like Isan) in Thai film, such as Yam Yasothon (Thai: \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e22\u0e21 \u0e22\u0e42\u0e2a\u0e18\u0e23) and Panya Raenu (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0d\u0e32 \u0e40\u0e23\u0e13\u0e39), which have only Thai-subtitles. ==Film ratings== A motion picture rating system to replace the 1930 Film Code was passed by the National Legislative Assembly in 2007 and was implemented in 2010. Under the 1930 Film Code, the Board of Censors reviewed all films to be shown in Thailand and made cuts or altered scenes that were deemed inappropriate. The board was made up of members of the Royal Thai Police and Ministry of Culture officials. Members of various interest groups, such as Buddhist monks, physicians or teachers, are sometimes consulted about whether certain films would offend them. Traditionally, depictions of sex and nudity are dealt with most heavy-handedly, with scenes being cut, pixelated or obscured by petroleum jelly. Profanity and violence are generally left intact. ===Apex=== The Apex Group of cinemas comprise the Lido, Scala and Siam theaters in Siam Square in Bangkok. The company is owned by the Tansacha family and is headed by Nanta Tansacha.Amnatcharoenrit, Bamrung (June 3, 2003), \"Old-style glamour still sells\", Bangkok Post via Siamfuture.com. The theaters were built in the late 1960s and have changed little since, making possible a retro movie-going experience that can't be found at the shopping-mall multiplexes. The theaters tend to not be as crowded as the other cinemas in central Bangkok, and it's usually possible to obtain the most-desired seating just minutes before showtime. The Apex cinemas not only show first-run Hollywood films, but also many art films, which is unique in Thailand, other than the House theater on Royal City Avenue. Among the events exclusive to the Apex is the annual Little Big Film Project, in which a series of foreign independent films are shown over the course of several weeks. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% !width=\"15%\"| Cinema !width=\"7%\"| Screens !width=\"7%\"| Seats !width=\"15%\"|Location !width=\"56%\"|Remarks |- |Lido||3||675||Siam Square, Pathum Wan, opposite Siam Center||The Lido cinemas are an older multiplex dating back to the late 1960s.

Also in the lobby are hand-painted movie advertisements, which were commonplace in Thailand until the 1990s, when large-scale screen printing became available. First-run Hollywood features are usually featured at the Scala, with the films moving to the Lido cinemas in subsequent weeks. The Scala is occasionally booked for live shows and private functions. Tickets are 140 baht for normal seats (Row H-CC) and 160 baht for stadium-style seating at the rear of the auditorium (Row A-G). Scala switched their main projector from film to digital on February 27th, 2013, with the film projector still available for special screenings of films in 35mm movie film. |- |Siam||1||832||Siam Square, Pathum Wan, opposite Siam Paragon|| Siam Theatre was burnt down during the political unrest in Bangkok on 19 May 2010. |- |} ===Coliseum Multiplex=== Coliseum Multiplex is a chain of movie theaters in Southern Thailand. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% !width=\"16%\"| Cinema !width=\"7%\"| Screens !width=\"7%\"| Seats !width=\"35%\"|Location !width=\"35%\"|Remarks |- Closed, Now operate as SF Cinemacity |Coliseum Multiplex||3|| ||Lee Garden, Hat Yai|| |- |Coliseum Multiplex||6|| ||Paradise Shopping Plaza, Phuket City|| |- |Coliseum Multiplex||1|| ||Trang Rama Trang Province|| |- |Coliseum Multiplex||3|| ||Phatthalung|| |} ===Major Cineplex Group=== Major Cineplex, combined with the EGV chain, is the largest operator of cinemas in Thailand.
