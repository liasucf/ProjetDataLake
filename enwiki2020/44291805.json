    "text": "The 1929 College Football All-Southern Team consists of American football players selected to the College Football All-Southern Teams selected by various organizations for the 1929 Southern Conference football season. Tulane won the SoCon championship. ==Composite eleven== The All-Southern eleven compiled by the Associated Press included: *Dick Abernathy, tackle for Vanderbilt. *Bill Banker, halfback for Tulane, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1977. He was known as the \"Blonde Blizzard\" due to his blonde hair and playing without a helmet. During the 1929 game with Georgia Tech, Banker wore a helmet onto the field because coach Bernie Bierman threatened to yank him out of the game. But the helmet slipped over his eyes as the Yellow Jackets were preparing to kickoff, so Banker tossed it to the sideline, and was never taken out, calling Bierman's bluff. He was featured as part of the All-American football team in the 1930 Warner Bros. feature movie Maybe It's Love. *Bull Brown, guard for Vanderbilt. Dan McGugin called him one of his six greatest players. *Bobby Dodd, quarterback for Tennessee, later coached Georgia Tech to a national title. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1993. *Ray Farris, guard and captain for North Carolina, third-team All-America. The 1929 team scored a school record 346 points. The season was seen as a great turnaround for the UNC football team, led by the \"hell-for-leather guard\" Farris. *Tony Holm, fullback for Alabama, unanimous selection, first-team AP All-America. *Gene McEver, halfback for Tennessee, received the most selections, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954. In December 2008, Sports Illustrated undertook to identify the individuals who would have been awarded the Heisman Trophy in college football's early years, before the trophy was established. McEver was selected as the would-be Heisman winner for the 1929 season. *Loyd Roberts, center for Tulane, anchored the line for the undefeated SoCon champion. *Fred Sington, tackle for Alabama.
