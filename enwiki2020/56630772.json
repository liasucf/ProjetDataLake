The Rance series follows the titular character, Rance, as he saves a number of kingdoms, defeats demon invaders, and causes mischief in the in-game world, \"The Continent.\" He has appeared in most of the main series games as the playable character, accompanied by his loyal slave, Sill Plain. The main series has ten full games, with two Rance IV followups, while the Kichikuou Rance (Brutal King Rance) is an alternative-universe spin-off. In addition, the first three games, Rance \u2013 Hikari Quest \u2013, Rance II \u2013 Rebellious Maidens \u2013and Rance III \u2013 Fall of Leazas \u2013 have been retro-actively superseded by their later-released versions, Rance 01 \u2013 Hikari Quest \u2013, Rance 02 \u2013 Rebellious Maidens \u2013 and Rance 03 \u2013 Fall of Leazas \u2013. ==Games== ===Rance \u2013 Hikari Quest \u2013=== Rance is given the task of finding and protecting the daughter of a rich family by Keith Gold, the owner of a local guild to which Rance is attached; he appears in almost all of the Rance series games. Rance investigates the city, while Sill investigates at Paris Academy, where the kidnapping victim attended school. The first game made by AliceSoft, it was released on the PC-8800 and PC-9800 series of computers, as well as the Sharp X68000, the MSX 2 and 2+, the FM TOWNS, and the PC88VA. A Windows 95\u201303 version of the game was released in the late 1990s, about eight years after the first game was released. ====Rance 01 \u2013 Hikari Quest \u2013==== Rance 01 \u2013 Hikari Quest \u2013, released for Windows in 2013, has the same setting as Rance \u2013 Hikari Quest \u2013, and replaces the latter in the main canon. The game featured an improved gameplay system, and features more new content from Rance \u2013 Hikari Quest \u2013 comparatively to Rance 02 \u2013 Rebellious Maidens \u2013, the re-release of Rance II \u2013 Rebellious Maidens \u2013. ===Rance II \u2013 Rebellious Maidens \u2013=== The city of Kathtom, a member of the Free Cities Alliance, is suddenly entombed under-ground by the Four Mages who were tasked to guard the town by Ragishss Cryhausen, the city's former guardian. Rance sets out with Sill to defeat them, but soon learns that their minds were corrupted by the power of the rings that they wield. Rance sets out to prevent them from receiving the magic power the rings grant. It was released on the same computer systems as the first Rance game was. ====Rance 02 \u2013 Rebellious Maidens \u2013==== A graphical re- make of Rance II \u2013 Rebellious Maidens \u2013, released for Windows in 2009. It was the genesis for the other early Rance series game re-releases. It did not contain as much new content as the next re-release, Rance 01 \u2013 Hikari Quest \u2013. ===Rance III \u2013 Fall of Leazas \u2013=== Leazas, a kingdom ruled by Queen Lia, who marries Rance in the Brutal King Rance time-line, is invaded by the warring empire of Helman, to the west. Demons are believed to be the cause of the attack, and to solve that problem, Rance sets out to find the \"Chaos\" sword, which contains the soul of an incredible thief from about one and one-half millennia ago. It was released on the PC-9800 series of computers, along with Sharp X68000 and the FM TOWNS; an early Windows release, similar to those that the first two Rance games received, was also released. ====Rance 03 \u2013 Fall of Leazas \u2013==== A complete re-creation of Rance III \u2013 Fall of Leazas \u2013, released for Windows in 2015. The graphics are renewed, while the story is changed to better fit into the main canon. It is the most advanced of the early Rance re- releases. ===Rance IV \u2013 Legacy of the Sect \u2013=== This game directly follows the events of its predecessor. Rance, having defeated the demons of Helman and saved Leazas, is teleported to Ylapu, a giant floating island above Leazas. There, Rance must find a way to escape from the island, but is hindered by agents of Leazas and Helman who come to retrieve him to The Continent. The legacy alluded to by the game's title is a powerful magical artifact left by the Holy Magic Sect. It was released for the PC-9800 series and the FM TOWNS. ====Rance 4.1 ~ Saving Pharmaceutical ~==== Rance accepts a quest to stop a horde of under-ground monsters from attacking the Happiness Pharmaceutical building, where the Seirogan, a healing medicine, is produced. They discover that the perpetrators are the Angel Army; one of their commanders escapes, which begins the next game, Rance 4.2 ~ Angel Army ~. ====Rance 4.2 ~ Angel Army ~==== In a continuance of the previous game, Rance 4.1 ~ Saving Pharmaceutical ~, Rance chases down the remainder of the Angel Army, while himself being chased after by an assassination group and three \"Rare Gal- Monsters,\" a class of unique enemies that he offended in Rance IV \u2013 Legacy of the Sect \u2013. The two games were released for the PC-9800 series, with a separate on-disc version. ===Brutal King Rance=== The game was assumed to be the final in the Rance series, and one of the final AliceSoft games; however, its great popularity allowed the company to continue its production of games. Rance, bored of his normal life, gathers a group of outlaw bandits and takes over some towns in southern Helman. The imperial army quickly puts down Rance's rebellion and take Sill captive; however, he escapes to Leazas, where he marries the country's queen to become a tyrant \"brutal king,\" commanding his own army to seek his revenge on Helman. Large opposition forces arise tried to remove the tyrant ruler from power; yet, Rance continues his trials to re-assert his power as the King of Leazas, retrieve Sill from Helman control, and take over the world. Rance, in fulfilling his general r\u00f4le as an epic hero, saves The Continent from destruction by a greater evil. It is the first territory acquisition-based Rance game, and was the genesis for other similarly-designed games. It was also the first AliceSoft game released for Windows, instead of any number of Japanese computer systems. All other Rance games to-date have been released for Windows. ===Rance 5D \u2013 Lonely Girl \u2013=== The temporary stop in the production of Rance games, including the release of \"Daiakuji\" a year prior, led to the largest time-gap in-between the release of two Rance games. Rance 5D \u2013 Lonely Girl \u2013 is based on a unique roulette system, where the role-playing elements are determined by randomisation. In the game, Rance is travelling through The Continent, trying to recover the always-lacking money, when Rance and Sill accidentally enter Genbu Castle, a separate dimension. Rance et al. must then escape the dimension, with a newly- found woman, Rizna Lanfbitt of Zeth. ===Rance VI \u2013 Collapse of Zeth \u2013=== Rance, continuing his trials from Rance 5D \u2013 Lonely Girl \u2013, travels to Zeth, a kingdom to the south-west of Leazas. He offends Radon, a high governmental official, and is sent to the slave camp; Sill, who he bought from the Zeth slave camp, is treated very kindly. Whilst within the Zeth slave camp, Rance joins the resistance group \"Ice Flame,\" which seeks to change the un-equal governing system of Zeth, which is biased against non-magic users. Rance VI \u2013 Collapse of Zeth \u2013 is considered to be one of the best games in the Rance series, which is helped by the continuance of the game from the Brutal King Rance time-line. ===Warring-States Rance=== Rance sets out for JAPAN, an island archipelago to the east of The Continent, which is modeled after the Warring-States Period of Japanese history. The original English translation of this game, that of Yandere Translations, gave the Rance series, and AliceSoft in general, a noticeable presence in the western world. Warring-States Rance, also known by its title in Japanese, Sengoku Rance, was one of AliceSoft's best-selling titles of all time. In the game, Rance, having taken control of one of the feudal states, seeks to take over JAPAN through his control of the state, and save it from destruction. ===Rance Quest \u2013 Rance Quest \u2013=== A continuation of the previous game, Warring-States Rance, wherein Rance returns to The Continent to seek a cure for the curse placed on Sill. While attempting to convince the Queen of Pencilcow, a kingdom to the west of Leazas, to cure Sill, he offends her, and she places a curse on him that he must become much stronger to overcome. He then journeys around The Continent, seeking a cure for himself and Sill. The game is based more upon the cessation of the stories of individual characters rather than a more continuous story-line. ====Rance Quest Magnum==== An expansion of Rance Quest \u2013 Rance Quest \u2013, this game follows Rance as he quests around The Continent to break the curse incurred upon himself in the previous game. The game focuses on the addition of sundry quests, through which Rance can adventure, ostensibly to cure his curse, although primarily in practice to assuage the effects of the curse. ===Rance IX \u2013 Helman Revolution \u2013=== The government of Helman has fallen into the hands of Stessel Ignon, who corrupts the country and plans to take over the entirety of The Continent. A revolutionary force gathers, seeking to replace the former emperor to the throne, and they solicit the aid of Rance, who agrees, hoping to remove Sill's curse. The Prime Minister, Stessel, has been planning this, and his actions have been seen earlier in the Rance series; he pushed for the war between Helman and Leazas in the events of Rance III \u2013 Fall of Leazas \u2013. ===Rance X \u2013 Decisive Battle \u2013=== The last game in the Rance series, it was released on 23 February 2018. The war amongst the demon lords of the Monster Realm has ended, and they now invade the human realm, to their east. Rance leads the combined forces of all humanity to battle the attacking demons.Green, S. (2017). After Almost 30 Years \"Rance\" Game Series Prepares For Final Battle.
