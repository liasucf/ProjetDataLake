    "text": "The Hanson Site includes two separate areas of Paleoindiian acheological sites in the northern Bighorn Basin of Wyoming. The southern Hanson I site was investigated first in 1973, finding evidence of tool working and stone flakes at a campsite. The northern Hanson II site is larger and includes the sites of lodges. Activity in these areas dates to 10,700 +/- 670 years ago to 10,080 +/- 300 years ago. The Hanson site is also of interest in paleontology, with animal fossil remains at deeper levels. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 1978. ==References== ==External links== * Hanson Site at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office Category:National Register of Historic Places in Big Horn County, Wyoming Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming ",
