It lies at the mouth of Chaihu\u00edn River that flows from the Valdivian Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean. Silt from the river combined with the prevailing coastal current have formed a barrier-bar across the cove creating an estuary. The administration and main entrance to the Valdivian Coastal Reserve lies in Chaihu\u00edn. ==History== The indigenous inhabitants of the area are Huilliche people. During the early 1970s Chaihu\u00edn was considered a hot-bed of the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), but with limited actual anti-government activity. In 2010 a new ferry service from the town of Corral was inaugurated. ==Demographics== The rural district of Chaihu\u00edn encompasses a larger area than the hamlet itself. Its population has grown from 206 in 1920 to over 800. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align=\"center\" width=60% |- bgcolor=\"#ececec\" ! Census year!!
