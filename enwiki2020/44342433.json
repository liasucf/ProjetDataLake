    "text": "The Island Federal Credit Union Arena, commonly known as Island Federal Arena, formerly known as the Stony Brook University Arena, is a 4,000-seat multi- purpose arena in Stony Brook, New York. It is the home of the Stony Brook Seawolves men's and women's basketball teams. Originally built in 1990, it underwent a $21.1 million renovation in 2012\u201314. Naming rights were sold to a regional credit union, Island Federal Credit Union. The Island Federal Arena has hosted the America East Conference Men's Basketball Tournament finals in 2012 and 2016, as well as the NBA G League Finals in 2019. It contains four scoreboards and two video boards, plus four luxury suites with 16 seats each. It is also used for concerts, trade shows, conventions, graduations and other special events. ==History== The Stony Brook University Arena opened in 1990 at a construction cost of $17 million. It served as the West Wing for the Stony Brook Indoor Sports Complex. In April 2008, Stony Brook announced plans to renovate its arena. A $21.1 million renovation of the Stony Brook University Arena was announced with $20 million provided by the State of New York and an additional $1 million provided by private donations. It included a seating capacity for 4,008 spectators, four luxury boxes and a VIP lounge area at the loge level with premium courtside seating. During the renovations, both basketball teams played at Pritchard Gymnasium, which like the Island Federal Credit Union Arena, is part of the Stony Brook Sports Complex. During the arena's renovation, the basketball court was rotated 90 degrees from its original angle, and the seating bowl was built around it. The old arena contained gaps in the seating bowl, and the renovation faced challenges due to the physical limitations of the original structure. Island Federal Arena during the 2019 G League Finals The renovation of the arena was completed in 2014. On October 3, 2014, the arena officially reopened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The first official general public event to take place at the newly- renovated arena was a Harlem Globetrotters game. The arena hosted its first home basketball game on November 14, 2014, and Stony Brook defeated Columbia 57\u201356 on a game-winning layup.http://www.newsday.com/sports/college/stony- brook/stony-brook-to-begin-21-1m-arena-renovation-1.3728108 On October 28, 2014, it was announced that Stony Brook had reached a deal with Island Federal Credit Union to purchase naming rights to the arena for $7 million. Island Federal Arena served as the home court for the Long Island Nets during the 2019 NBA G League Finals due to conflicts with the Nets' home arena, the Nassau Coliseum. During the summer of 2019, Island Federal Arena renovated its court, which previously featured the interlocking \"SB\" logo at mid-court. The new court contains the Seawolves' logo at mid-court, with a silhouette of Long Island that spans the entire length of the floor. ==Gallery== File:IslandFederalArena UMBC.jpg|Island Federal Arena in 2020 File:Island Federal Arena UMBC.jpg|Island Federal Arena in 2020 File:Seawolves fans.jpg|Stony Brook fans at Island Federal Arena File:Warney Retired Number.jpg|Jameel Warney's retired number in the rafters File:SBU NCAA banner.jpeg|Banner commemorating Stony Brook's first NCAA Tournament berth ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I basketball arenas ==References== ==External links== *Island Federal Credit Union Arena at stonybrookathletics.com Category:Stony Brook University Category:Basketball venues in New York (state) Category:Sports venues in Suffolk County, New York Category:Stony Brook Seawolves men's basketball Category:1990 establishments in New York (state) Category:Sports venues completed in 1990 Category:College basketball venues in the United States ",
