    "text": "Ernest P\u00e9rochon (1885\u20131942) was a French writer who won the Prix Goncourt in 1920 for his novel N\u00eane. Initially a teacher, he left his career in education in 1921 to pursue writing. He wrote poems, novels (ranging from realism to science fiction), as well as children\u2019s literature. ==Childhood and adolescence== P\u00e9rochon was born 24 February 1885 in Courlay, Deux-S\u00e8vres at Tyran Farm. He was raised as a Protestant in a region with an unusual religious make-up, living alongside both Royalist Catholic \"chouans\" from the Vend\u00e9e and dissidents from \"the little church\" which had refused the authority of the 1801 Concordat signed by Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. P\u00e9rochon was very attached to his home region and to family values. He described in his stories his love for the common people, \"les cherche-pain\" (bread seekers) in his home region of the G\u00e2tine at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1897, P\u00e9rochon became a student at l\u2019Ecole Primaire Sup\u00e9rieure in Bressuire, eleven kilometers north of Courlay. ==Adulthood== In 1900, P\u00e9rochon enrolled at l\u2019Ecole Normale in Parthenay (35 kilometers southeast of Courlay), and he later became an assistant primary teacher at Courlay before becoming a teacher at l\u2019Ecole Primaire Sup\u00e9rieure in Parthenay. He served in the military in 1905 under the 114th Infantry Regiment in Saint-Maixent. In 1907, P\u00e9rochon married Vanda Houmeau, who was also a teacher. He then moved to Saint-Paul-en-G\u00e2tine where his only daughter, Simone, was born in 1908. In 1908, his first work was published by Clouzot in Niort. In 1909, he was published for a second time and his first novel, Les creux de maisons, in which he evoked the image of \"les cherche-pain,\" was also serialized in the newspaper l\u2019Humanit\u00e9 in this year. In 2012, P\u00e9rochon's 1925 science fiction novel Les Hommes Fr\u00e9n\u00e9tiques was translated by Brian Stableford as The Frenetic People. ==Death== In 1914, P\u00e9rochon returned to teaching in Vouill\u00e9. After being called up to the army, he suffered a heart attack on the front lines. In 1920, his novel N\u00eane, published by Clouzot, earned him the Prix Goncourt. The following year, he retired from teaching for good and moved to Niort. In 1940, P\u00e9rochon refused to collaborate with the Vichy press and two of his novels were banned. He was threatened by the Vichy Prefect, and the Gestapo watched him closely. He concealed his anxiety from his family. He died February 10, 1942 from another heart attack at age 57. ==Anecdote== In 1935, P\u00e9rochon's daughter, Simone, married Delphin Debenest, who was also involved in the Resistance during World War II. A soldier in 1940, this intelligence agent in the Franco-Belgian Resistance was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Buchenwald and then to Kommando in Holzen from which he succeeded in escaping. During the Nuremberg Trials, this extraordinary man acted as deputy prosecutor. He was also a magistrate in Niort and Poitiers and won numerous French and Belgian military decorations. == Novels (selected) == Les Creux-De-Maisons (1912) Les hommes fr\u00e9n\u00e9tiques (1925) (translated in 2012 by Brian Stableford as \"The Frenetic People\") N\u00eane (1920) - Prix Goncourt (translated in 1922) Le Chemin de plaine (1920) La Parcelle 32 (1922) (translated in 1923 by Frances C. Fay) Les Ombres (1923) Les Gardiennes (1924) (made into a film of the same name in 2017) ==Homage / Tributes== On March 31, 1985, the public school of Tour Nivelle (in Courlay) held a commemoration ceremony for the 100th birthday of P\u00e9rochon which was well-attended by the public, and many key figures were there. Under the High Patronage of the Minister of National Education and Culture, numerous speeches were given, including one by Mr. Leblond-Zola, grandson of \u00c9mile Zola. For this occasion, a classroom from the time when P\u00e9rochon was a student (and later a teacher) at Tour Nivelle was reconstructed. People have visited this place from then on, and it can still be visited today. This marked the beginning of the year of P\u00e9rochon which was celebrated with many cultural events in the Deux-S\u00e8vres as well as with shows and displays relating to the works of P\u00e9rochon such as \"l\u2019homme fr\u00e9n\u00e9tique\" (The Frenzied Man), \"les creux de maisons,\" and \"les gardiennes\" (The Caretakers). The high school in Parthenay, a group of schools in Niort and in Cerizay, the municipal library in Echir\u00e9 and many streets in the department of the Deux-S\u00e8vres are named in memory of this French writer. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Deux-S\u00e8vres Category:French Protestants Category:Prix Goncourt winners Category:French male writers ",
