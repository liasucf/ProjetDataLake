In 1812, when he was ten years old, he had to move, by order of the French authorities, to the military college of La Fl\u00e8che in France, despite the family's attempts to exempt him from this duty. When he was almost thirty years old, he was eventually able to return to his hometown and he took charge of the family with the help of his mother. Ettore never married and had no children, making him the last male direct descendant of the family. Vincenzo Ciccotti, Camillo Borgia (1773-1817). Soldato ed archeologo (Quaderni della Biblioteca comunale - 8), Velletri, Citt\u00e0 di Velletri, 1999 Despite his father's revolutionary past and exile, Ettore was able to hold the position of Gonfaloniere di Velletri several times between 1840 and 1849. In addition, in 1847 he was given command of the City Guard Battalion with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. But in 1849 he supported the Roman Republic and was even placed on the head of the Marittima Province, south of Rome. Luca Maggiore, L'ordine pubblico nello Stato pontificio. Velletri dal 1814 al 1870, Tivoli, Tored edizioni, 2016 In 1867, after the invasion of the Papal State and the arrival in Velletri by Giovanni Nicotera and his volunteer army, Ettore was appointed as member of the municipal administration for his role in the 1849 uprising. However, after Garibaldi's defeat in Mentana, he had to flee the city and follow Nicotera during his retreat. In 1870, following the annexation of the Papal State to Italy, Ettore was rewarded for his patriotic actions over the years and was therefore appointed president of the (Provisory) Provincial Council of Rome. After the dissolution of this governmental body a few months later and due to his old age, he left active politics and became president of the nursery school of Velletri, which he helped to finance through various initiatives.
