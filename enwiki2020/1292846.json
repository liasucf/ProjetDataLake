    "text": "Stranger in Town is the tenth studio album by American rock singer Bob Seger and his second with the Silver Bullet Band, released by Capitol Records in May 1978 (see 1978 in music). Like its predecessor, the Silver Bullet Band backed Seger on about half of the songs and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section backed Seger on the other half. The album became an instant success in the United States, being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America less than a month after the album's release, and, like its predecessor Night Moves, it would later go 6\u00d7 Platinum. It was also his first album to chart in the UK, where limited editions were released on silver vinyl and in picture disc format as well as standard black vinyl. ==Track listing== *Side one, track 3 written by George Jackson and Thomas Earl Jones III *Side two, track 1 written by Frankie Miller *All other tracks written by Bob Seger Notes The Silver Bullet Band plays on side one tracks 1, 2, & 5 and on side two track 3 The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section plays on side one tracks 3 & 4 and on side two tracks 1, 2, & 4 ==Personnel== The Silver Bullet Band *Bob Seger \u2013 guitar, vocals *Drew Abbott \u2013 guitar *Robyn Robbins \u2013 keyboards *Alto Reed \u2013 tenor saxophone and alto saxophone *Chris Campbell \u2013 bass *David Teegarden \u2013 percussion, drums Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section *Barry Beckett \u2013 keyboards *Pete Carr \u2013 guitar *Jimmy Johnson \u2013 guitar *David Hood \u2013 bass *Roger Hawkins \u2013 drums, percussion Additional Musicians *Glenn Frey \u2013 guitar solo on \"Till It Shines\" *Don Felder \u2013 guitar solo on \"Ain't Got No Money\" *Bill Payne \u2013 organ, piano, on \"Hollywood Nights\" *Doug Riley \u2013 piano on \"Feel Like a Number\" and \"Brave Strangers\" *Howie McDonald - guitar solo on \"Old Time Rock & Roll\" Background singers :\"We've Got Tonite\" and \"Still the Same\" *Venetta Fields \u2013 vocals, background vocals *Clydie King \u2013 vocals, background vocals *Sherlie Matthews \u2013 vocals, background vocals :\"Hollywood Nights\" *Julia Waters \u2013 background vocals *Luther Waters \u2013 vocals, background vocals *Maxine Waters \u2013 background vocals *Oren Waters \u2013 vocals, background vocals :\"Still the Same\" and \"Brave Strangers\" *Brandye \u2013 vocals, background vocals :\"Old Time Rock\" *James Lavell Easley \u2013 background vocals *Stanley Carter \u2013 background vocals *George Jackson \u2013 vocals, background vocals *Jim Ed Norman \u2013 strings arranged and conducted by ===Production=== *Producers: Punch Andrews, Bob Seger *Engineers: John Arrias, Mark Calice, David Cole, Hugh Davies, Gregg Hamm, Steve Melton, George Tutko *Mixing: Punch Andrews, John Arrias, Bob Seger *Mastering: Wally Traugott *Remastering: Punch Andrews, 1999 *Remastering: Robert Vosgien *String arrangements: Jim Ed Norman *Art direction: Roy Kohara *Design: Ken Anderson *Photography: Terrence Bert, Bob Siedemann ==Charts== ===Album=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"|Chart (1978) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |French Top Albums Search for \"Bob SEGER & The SILVER BULLET Band\" on the drop-down menu to see results. |style=\"text-align:center;\"|14 |- |German Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 |- |Swedish Top 60 Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|45 |- |UK Albums Chart |style=\"text- align:center;\"|31 |- |US Billboard 200 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |} {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1979) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |New Zealand Top 40 Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- |1978 |\"Still the Same\" |Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|4 |- |1978 |\"Hollywood Nights\" |Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|12 |- |1978 |\"We've Got Tonite\" |Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|13 |- |1979 |\"Old Time Rock and Roll\" |Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|28 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:1978 albums Category:Bob Seger albums Category:Albums produced by Punch Andrews Category:Albums recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio Category:Capitol Records albums ",
