Companion to an Untold Story, about a man\u2019s premeditated suicide and a friend\u2019s struggle to come to terms with his act, was selected by Susan Orlean for the 2011 AWP Award in Nonfiction and published by the University of Georgia Press in 2012. Orlean said, \"Exquisitely sad but painstaking in its clarity, Companion to an Untold Story is an effort to understand a friend\u2019s decision to commit suicide. The author lays out the facts and emotions using the structure of an abecedary, as if the simplicity of a child\u2019s alphabet book could bring logic to the terrible puzzle of loss. There is no suspense in the outcome, but reading the book draws you in so intimately that you, too, feel an urgent need to understand why an intelligent, likeable man would choose, with great deliberateness, to kill himself. This is a difficult subject, written extraordinarily well: a winner.\" Aldrich has just completed a collection of her essays The Art of Being Born and is at work on Haze, a narrative of marriage and divorce during her college years. ==Selected works== \u201cThe Art of Being Born,\u201d originally published in Hotel Amerika.
