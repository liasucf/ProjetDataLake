    "text": "The Millennium Philcon was the 59th World Science Fiction Convention, held from August 30 to September 3, 2001 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center & Philadelphia Marriott Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Most commentators mentioned the titanic size of the convention center. Darrell Schweitzer said of it, \"Imagine a convention held in a zeppelin hangar -- designed for multiple zeppelins -- and you will begin to get the idea ... [There was] enough airspace to fly a small plane indoors.\"Science Fiction Chronicle, Issue 219, December 2001, p. 58 ==Guests of Honor== * Greg Bear (author) * Stephen Youll (Artist) * Gardner Dozois (Editor) * George Scithers (Fan) * Esther Friesner (Toastmaster) ==Other program participants== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" |----- | valign=\"top\" | *Forrest J.

Of those, 933 were supporting memberships and 6 were kids-in-tow. Actual on-site attendance was 4,592. ==About the convention== The pocket program for the 2001 World Science Fiction Convention Many commentators spoke of the outsize the Philadelphia Convention Center. Despite the convention being sizable, \"attendees seemed to rattle around the oversize room.\"Charles N. Brown, Locus, Issue 490, November 2001, p. 10 115 individual dealers sold goods at 258 tables in the dealers' room. Dealers reported good sales, but there was some confusion about tax laws and last-minute license charges which upset some dealers.'Charles N. Brown, Locus, Issue 490, November 2001, p. 40 ===Programming=== 440 people participated in 530 panel discussions, dialogues, slide shows, autograph session, and readings. The panel on \"The State of Science Fiction Publishing Today\" took a troubling look at the publishing industry as a whole. There was much concern about mass market paperbacks, the catastrophic reduction in the number of book distributors from about 300 to three, and the high percentage of books returned unsold. On the panel \"The Science Fiction Short Story Today\" it was noted that even famous short story magazines are seeing declining circulation.Jennifer A. Hall, Locus, Issue 490, November 2001, pp. 52, 80 ===Guests of honor=== Greg Bear talked about how common many of the tropes of science fiction have become, and how this is an encouraging sign of the mainstream acceptance of science fiction. He also spoke of his father-in-law, the late Poul Anderson. Gardner Dozois said the science fiction field had endured many boom and bust cycles before, and pointed out that historically, science fiction of today was freed from many of the unfortunate prejudices and restraints that it has had in the past.Mark R. Kelly, Locus, Issue 490, November 2001, p. 48 ===Art show=== The art show had a great variety of science fiction and fantasy oriented art. Free docent tours were led by professional artists. The Art Show Award for Best in Show was awarded to Bob Eggleton's \"Quimeartha's Dream 1 & 2\". ===Masquerade=== The Masquerade was held Saturday evening. There were 31 competitors. Several very large dragons impressed the audience. The winning entry for Best In Show was \"Fridays at Ten,\" a skit of several Twilight Zone episodes done in black, white, and grey costumes. \"The H-Mercs\" won Best Workmanship for their spectacular mechanical dragon. Intermission entertainment was supplied by Harmonytryx, a female a cappella group. Naturally, there were many \"hall costumes\" as well worn throughout the con, including Centauri, Klingons, and a young Princess Ozma. ===Fan memorabilia=== A large exhibit of historical Worldcon artifacts was spread across the exhibit hall. There were photographs and clippings from Nycon I, held in New York in 1939, as well as Hugo Awards, mugs, medallions, program books, t-shirts and the like from more recent conventions. ===Weirdness, fun and otherwise=== A nearby Christian convention, \"For His Glory\", was held simultaneously. Several attendees of that convention were disturbed by fans dressed up as demons and the like. They disrupted several panels and convention registration by singing hymns until Security was called to escort them away.Charles N. Brown, Locus, Issue 490, November 2001, p. 41 Philadelphia's Chinatown is immediately outside the convention center, and many a budget-conscious attendee ate delicious Chinese food and dim sum rather than expensive hotel fare that weekend.Edward Bryant, Locus, Issue 490, November 2001, p. 47 On Saturday \"The Junkyard Wars\" were held in some of the spare space in the exhibit hall. Ten teams of six people tried to build mechanisms from whatever they could find to propel a raw egg over a barrier as far as they could without it breaking. The winning team received \"a rosette and a trophy made from junk found in the hotel basement that morning.\" ==Awards== ===Hugo Awards=== * Best Novel: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by J. K.
