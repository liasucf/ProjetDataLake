    "text": "Gaius Catellius Celer (also known as Lucius Pompeius Vopiscus Catellius Celer) was a Roman senator who flourished during the Flavian dynasty. He served as suffect consul with Marcus Arruntius Aquila in late AD 77.Paul Gallivan, \"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 202, 214 At times Celer also included the nomen \"Arruntius\" in his name, indicating either that his mother belonged to that family, or he received a legacy from someone of that family in return for adopting that person's name, a practice referred to by scholars as \"testamentary adoption\". Further, no later than AD 80 Celer adopted the longer version of his name -- Lucius Pompeius Vopiscus Catellius Celer -- suggesting he accepted another testamentary adoption around that time, in this case from one Lucius Pompeius Vopiscus.Ronald Syme, Some Arval Brethren, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), pp. 18f This Pompeius Vopiscus might be the suffect consul of 69.Olli Salomies, Adoptive and Polyonymous Nomenclature in the Roman Empire (Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1992), p. 118 Details of Celer's life are lacking before 20 May 75, when he first appears in the records of the Arval Brethren as a member of that college.Syme, Arval Brethren, p. 12 Ronald Syme argues that between that date and October 77, when he is mentioned again, he was away from Rome, serving as governor of Lusitania.Syme, Arval Brethren, p. 26 He returned to Rome to serve as suffect consul in 77, and attended all the known ceremonies of the Arval Brethren until 86, and does not appear again until 27 May 90. Syme explains his absence by dating Celer's term as juridicus of Tarraconensis to these years.Syme, Arval Brethren, p. 29 Prior to serving as juridicus, Celer is known to have served as curator operum publicorum, succeeding Marcus Hirrius Fronto Neratius Pansa.Syme, Arval Brethren, pp. 30f In AD 91, when he was eligible to participate in the sortition for the proconsulate of either Africa or Asia, he failed to obtain either one.Syme, Arval Brethren, p. 36 Some authorities raise the possibility that Pompeia Celerina, the mother of Pliny the Younger's second wife, was Celer's daughter. In his monograph on Imperial Roman nomenclature, Olli Salomies points out that if this were the case, she had to be born after Celer accepted the testamentary adoption -- after 80 -- but \"a lady born at the earliest in c. 80 cannot have been the mother of Pliny's second wife.\"Salomies, Adoptive and Polyonymous Nomenclature, p. 119 == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:Senators of the Roman Empire Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Lusitania Vopiscus Gaius Arruntius Catellius Celer ",
