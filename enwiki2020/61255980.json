    "text": "Weather is the tenth studio album by American rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released on February 14, 2020, by New Hulex under license to BMG Rights Management. The album consists of songs recorded before Lewis' 2018 hearing loss from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Seven tracks had been completed before work on the album was indefinitely halted, and the band eventually decided to release the record as is. ==Development and release== Huey Lewis and the News had not released an album in nearly ten years and had not recorded an album of new material since 2001's Plan B. Plans for a new album had been circulating since 2012 when Lewis announced a new song they wrote called \"While We're Young\". \"But now we need nine more\", Lewis explained. While touring in the mid-2010s, the addition of a song titled \"Her Love Is Killing Me\" had been included in the band's setlist. By the end of 2017, Huey Lewis and the News had recorded a handful of songs for a new album, and it was anticipated that it would be released sometime in 2018. However, in January 2018, when Huey Lewis was diagnosed with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, the band cancelled all future shows and placed the album on hold. A year later, it was announced the band had signed with BMG to release the new album. \"Her Love Is Killin' Me\" was released as the first single in September 2019. In December 2019, \"While We're Young\" was made available to download and stream along with the announcement of the album's title and release date of February 14, 2020. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== The News * Huey Lewis \u2013 lead vocals, harmonica * Johnnie Bamont \u2013 baritone saxophone * Stef Burns \u2013 guitar, vocals * Johnny Colla \u2013 guitar, saxophone, sequencing, vocals * Bill Gibson \u2013 drums, vocals * James Harrah \u2013 guitar, vocals * Sean Hopper \u2013 keyboards, vocals * Marvin McFadden \u2013 trumpet * John Pierce \u2013 bass * Rob Sudduth \u2013 tenor saxophone Additional musicians * Jeffrey Babko \u2013 piano (\"I Am There for You\") * Chris Barnes \u2013 trumpet (\"Remind Me Why I Love You Again\") * Bryan Dyer \u2013 backing vocals (\"Hurry Back Baby\") * Niko Ellison \u2013 backing vocals (\"I Am There for You\", \"Hurry Back Baby\", \"Remind Me Why I Love You Again\", \"Pretty Girls Everywhere\") * John McFee \u2013 steel guitar (\"One of the Boys\") * Karl Perazzo \u2013 percussion (\"Remind Me Why I Love You Again\") * Lorin Rowan \u2013 backing vocals (\"Pretty Girls Everywhere\") * Ric Wilson \u2013 guitar (\"I Am There for You\") ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Chart performance for Weather |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2020 albums Category:Huey Lewis and the News albums Category:BMG Rights Management albums ",
