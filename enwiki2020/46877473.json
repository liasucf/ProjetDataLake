    "text": "Motul Municipality (in the Yucatec Maya language: \u201cPlace of no overflowing\u201d) is one of the 106 municipalities in the Mexican state of Yucat\u00e1n containing (297.63 km2) of land and located roughly 45 km east of the city of M\u00e9rida. ==History== The founder of Motul was a Maya priest named Zac Mutul. An exact date is unknown, but the city dates from the eleventh century. Before the conquest, it was part of the province of Ceh Pech and afterwards, became part of the encomienda system. In 1581, the encomendero was Francisco de Bracamonte. In 1821, Yucat\u00e1n was declared independent of the Spanish Crown. In 1825 the area was part of the Coastal region, with its headquarters in Izamal. During the Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n in 1847, the state government ordered that suspects who appeared to be part of the conspiracy to revolt against the white settlers be whipped. Some 200 Indians were punished and the headman of Motul, Baselio May along with two of his fellow leaders Jos\u00e9 Miguel Pech and Nicol\u00e1s Kuk were beaten and condemned to die, though their participation in the revolt was dubious. On 10 March 1852 the town was elevated to the category of Villa and made head of the municipality and on 22 February 1872, it was decreed a city. From 29 to 31 March 31, 1918, the first Socialist Congress convened in Motul to examine worker's issues. That same year,on 8 July, the Kopt\u00e9 Rancho, which was part of the municipality, was elevated to the status of a town. On 30 September 1924, the name of the recently assassinated governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto was appended to the name of the city, but was later repealed. On 2 October 1933, it was appended again and the official name of the head of the municipality became Motul de Carrillo Puerto. ==Governance== The municipal president is elected for a term of three years. The president appoints nine Councilpersons to serve on the board for three year terms, as the Secretary and councilors of sports, special events, public works, commissaries, public services, nomenclature, cemeteries, ecology, public lighting. The Municipal Council administers the business of the municipality. It is responsible for budgeting and expenditures and producing all required reports for all branches of the municipal administration. Annually it determines educational standards for schools. The Police Commissioners ensure public order and safety. They are tasked with enforcing regulations, distributing materials and administering rulings of general compliance issued by the council. ==Communities== The main town in the municipality is the eponymous Motul, Yucat\u00e1n.
