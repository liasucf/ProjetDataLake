    "text": "The Other Side of Me is the thirty-fifth studio album by American pop singer Andy Williams, released in the summer of 1975 by Columbia Records and including the 1973 recording of \"Solitaire\" from his album of the same name alongside 10 original recordings, four of which were also by \"Solitaire\" composer Neil Sedaka. After unsuccessful attempts to leave behind the formulaic album genre of easy listening covers of pop hits, The Other Side of Me offered a compromise by filling half of the sides with material that was popularized by other artists and the other half with either new or obscure selections. Although The Other Side of Me did not make it onto Billboard magazine's Top LP's & Tapes chart in the US, it did spend one week on the UK album chart in October 1975 at number 60. The UK version of the album included one additional track, \"Love Said Goodbye\" which had entered Billboard's list of the 40 most popular Easy Listening songs of the week in the US in the issue dated January 11, 1975, and reached number 24 over the course of seven weeks.. The first song released from the US version of the album was \"Sad Eyes\", which entered the Easy Listening chart in the October 11, 1975, issue and stayed there for seven weeks, peaking at number 11, and the title track from the album entered the UK singles chart on March 6, 1976, for a three-week stay that took the song to number 42. The North American version of The Other Side of Me was released on compact disc for the first time as one of two albums on one CD by Collectables Records on February 19, 2002, the other album being Williams's Columbia release from the fall of 1974, You Lay So Easy on My Mind. Collectables included this CD in a box set entitled Classic Album Collection, Vol. 2, which contains 15 of his studio albums and two compilations and was released on November 29, 2002. ==Track listing== ===Side one=== # \"The Other Side of Me\" (Howard Greenfield, Neil Sedaka) \u2013 3:20 # \"Quits\" (Danny O'Keefe) \u2013 2:54 # \"Love Will Keep Us Together\" (Greenfield, Sedaka) \u2013 3:31 # \"My Eyes Adored You\" (Bob Crewe, Kenny Nolan) \u2013 2:57 # \"The Hungry Years\" (Greenfield, Sedaka) \u2013 4:10 # \"Solitaire\" (Phil Cody, Sedaka) \u2013 4:21 ===Side two=== # \"Sad Eyes\" (Cody, Sedaka) \u2013 3:21 # \"Feelings\" (Morris Albert) \u2013 2:56 # \"In My Eyes\" (Crewe, Nolan) \u2013 3:46 # \"Mandy\" (Scott English, Richard Kerr) \u2013 3:07 # \"What Happens to You\" (Stevie Wonder) \u2013 4:18 Along with the addition of \"Love Said Goodbye\", the UK version replaced \"Solitaire\" with \"Pieces of April\" from Alone Again (Naturally), Williams's 1972 album that was re-titled The First Time Ever (I Saw Your Face) for its UK release. ==Recording dates== ===North American release=== From the liner notes for the 2002 CD: * May 19\u201328, 1975 \u2013 all tracks except as noted * April 12, 1973 \u2013 \"Solitaire\" * March 24, 1975 \u2013 \"Quits\" ===UK release (additional tracks)=== * July 18, 1972 \u2013 \"Pieces of April\"(2002) Album notes for Alone Again (Naturally)/Solitaire by Andy Williams, [CD booklet].
