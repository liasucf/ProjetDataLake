    "text": "The Newfoundland ten cent coins exist as a bronze pattern with the adopted obverse from the New Brunswick coin (the words Newfoundland substitute New Brunswick). This design adoption is similar to that used for Newfoundland five cent coins. The obverse, featuring Queen Victoria, has three different varieties. The first variety is found on coins dated 1865, 1870, and 1873. There are two leaves at the top of the laurel crown. Another key way to distinguish this is the use of two dots before and after Newfoundland on the obverse.Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins, p. 43, W.K. Cross, 60th Edition, 2006 The second variety features three leaves at the top of the laurel crown and a dot can be found before but not after Newfoundland on the obverse. This variety is featured on coins dated 1870, 1872H, 1873, 1876H, 1880, 1885 and 1894. The final variety is similar to the first variety with the two leaves at the top of the laurel crown. The difference is that the leaf barely touches the legend band of the obverse and is found on coins dated 1882H, 1885, 1888, 1890, 1894 and 1896. ==1871 Mint Mule== A rare variety exists because an 1871H Dominion of Canada reverse die was muled with an H Newfoundland obverse die.Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins, p. 44, W.K.

The mintage figures for 1946 and 1947 are considered unofficial. The same issue occurred with the Newfoundland five cents coins of the era. Published official mint reports do not indicate any mintage of the denomination during 1946, although there appears to be 1946 coins created in 1947.Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins, p. 41, W.K.
