    "text": "Colin Lingwood Mallows (born 10 September 1930, Great Sampford, Essex) is an English statistician, who has worked in the United States since 1960. He is known for Mallows's Cp, a regression model diagnostic procedure, widely used in regression analysis. He received in 1951 his bachelor's degree and in 1953 his Ph.D. from University College London (UCL) under Florence Nightingale David and Norman Lloyd Johnson with thesis Some problems connected with distribution problems. Mallows joined the UCL faculty and taught there from 1955 to 1959 with a sabbatical year at Princeton University in the academic year 1957\u20131958. He worked for Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey from 1960 to 1995 and then for AT&T; Labs in Florham Park, New Jersey from 1995 to 2000, when he retired. Since 2000 he has been a consultant for Avaya Labs. He is the author or coauthor of about 140 research publications. He was awarded the R. A. Fisher Lectureship in 1997, the Deming Lectureship in 2004, and the Wilks Memorial Award in 2007. Mallows and George Box are the only two statisticians to have received all three of those honours. Mallows solved a $10,000 mathematical problem posed by John Horton Conway, but declined the prize money on the grounds that the problem was too easy.
