He was previously Guinea's Ambassador to France from 1978 to 1984 and was Secretary-General of the Unity and Progress Party (PUP) from 1995 to 2002. ==Political career until 2002== Sompar\u00e9 was born in Dakonta, located in Bok\u00e9 Prefecture. He was the Regional Director of Education in Lab\u00e9 from August 1970 to September 1973, Director-General of Secondary Education at the Ministry of Pre-University Education from September 1973 to December 1976, and Director- General of the Information Services from December 1976 to February 1978. Subsequently, he was posted to Paris as Guinea's Ambassador to France from February 1978 to September 1984; after his return from Paris, he was an advisor at the Ministry of Administrative Reform and the Civil Service from November 1984 to July 1986. He was then Administrator of the Palace of Nations (the presidential palace) in Conakry from July 1986 to May 1987 and Rector of the University of Conakry from May 1987 to May 1989. From August 1989 to October 1990, Sompar\u00e9 was the National Coordinator of the Adjustment Programme for the Education Sector; he was then Secretary-General of the Ministry of the Interior and Decentralization from October 1990 to March 1992. Later, he was elected to the National Assembly in the June 1995 parliamentary election, and at that time he became Secretary-General of the PUP as well as President of the PUP/PCN Parliamentary Group. He remained in those positions until 2002. ==President of the National Assembly== After Sompar\u00e9 was re-elected to the National Assembly in the June 2002 parliamentary election,\"Aboubacar Sompar\u00e9 \u00e9lu pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e lors d\u2019une s\u00e9ance boycott\u00e9e par les ambassadeurs du G7\" , Afrique Express, number 256, 2 October 2002 . he was chosen by President Lansana Cont\u00e9 to become President of the National Assembly. Cont\u00e9 had some difficulty obtaining the necessary support for Sompar\u00e9 among parliamentary deputies, and for that reason he delayed the opening of the National Assembly.Abou Bakr and Rukmini Callimachi, \"Guinea coup leader parades through capital\", Associated Press, 25 December 2008. Ultimately he was elected as President of the National Assembly at a special session\"Aboubacar Sompar\u00e9 \u00e9lu pr\u00e9sident de l'Assembl\u00e9e guin\u00e9enne\", Panapress, 24 September 2002 . on 23 September 2002, receiving the support of 87 of the 106 deputies who voted. Although Sompar\u00e9 held a key post as President of the National Assembly, it was believed that the ailing President Cont\u00e9 disliked him;Paul Melly, \"Guinea: Early Warning Analysis\", Writenet, August 2003, page 3. he was also reportedly unpopular with the army and much of the PUP leadership.\"Guinea in Transition\", Crisis Group Africa Briefing, number 37, 11 April 2006, page 5. During that time, Sompar\u00e9 was apparently engaged in a rivalry with PUP Secretary-General S\u00e9kou Konat\u00e9. Sompar\u00e9's position as Cont\u00e9's constitutional successor concerned some, who believed he would be unwilling to surrender power if he ever obtained it. On the other hand, it was noted that Sompar\u00e9 enjoyed little popularity with any group and therefore might lack the political base to perpetuate himself in power. In early 2006, when Cont\u00e9 left Guinea to receive medical treatment in Switzerland, Sompar\u00e9 reportedly met with military officers to discuss the presidential succession; Cont\u00e9 was said to be infuriated by that move. Speaking to Jeune Afrique in 2008, Sompar\u00e9 said that he thought Cont\u00e9, who was known to be in extremely poor health, would not be a candidate for re-election in the planned 2010 presidential election. He also addressed the failure to hold a parliamentary election on schedule (as the parliamentary term began in 2002, it would normally have expired in 2007), saying that an election should only be held if it would \"contribute to strengthen the social fabric and democracy\" and not if it would \"contribute to disorder\".Djibril S. Diakite, \"A long way to go\" , The Africa Report, 2008. ==Events of December 2008== In the early hours of 23 December 2008, Sompar\u00e9 announced on television that President Cont\u00e9 had died \"after a long illness\" on the previous day. According to the constitution, the President of the National Assembly was to assume the Presidency of the Republic in the event of a vacancy, and a new presidential election was to be held within 60 days.\"Guinea's long-time military leader Conte dies\", AFP, 23 December 2008. Sompar\u00e9 requested that the President of the Supreme Court, Lamine Sidim\u00e9, declare a vacancy in the Presidency and apply the constitution.\"Economie et Politique : Sompar\u00e9 demande au pr\u00e9sident de la Cour supr\u00eame de faire constater la vacance du pouvoir\" , Guin\u00e9enews, 22 December 2008 .

Sompar\u00e9 later said in an interview that Sidim\u00e9 initially could not be reached after Cont\u00e9's death, and that when Sidim\u00e9 subsequently arrived at the People's Palace to discuss the situation, he delayed taking the necessary legal steps on the \"pretext\" that he could not arrange a ceremony until the next day.C\u00e9cile Sow, \"Aboubacar Sompar\u00e9\", Jeune Afrique, 22 March 2010 . Six hours after Sompar\u00e9 announced Cont\u00e9's death,\"Military-led group announces coup in Guinea\", Associated Press, 23 December 2008. a statement was read on television announcing a military coup d'\u00e9tat.

Sompar\u00e9 went into hiding and told the press that the newly established junta was trying to find him; he also urged the international community to \"mobilise to prevent the military from interrupting the democratic process\".Peter Walker, \"Guinea coup leaders promise poll within two years\", The Guardian, 24 December 2008. After a few days in hiding, he emerged on 27 December to attend a meeting of political and social representatives that was called by the junta and held at the Alpha Yaya Diallo military camp.\"Economie et Politique : Premi\u00e8re apparition publique de Sompar\u00e9 depuis le d\u00e9but des \u00e9v\u00e9nements avec les acteurs au Camp Alpha Diallo\" , Guineenews, 27 December 2008 . ==Political career (2009\u20132017)== With the PUP out of power for the first time in its history, in late January 2009 a \"refoundation\" movement was reportedly established within the PUP that intended to remove supporters of Sompar\u00e9 and his old rival, S\u00e9kou Konat\u00e9, from the party leadership.Moussa Diop, \"Revue de la presse nationale du 2 au 9 f\u00e9vrier 2009\", Aminata.com, 7 February 2009 .

Sompar\u00e9 was largely silent in public in the year that followed the coup. Unlike many other Cont\u00e9 officials, he was left alone by the CNDD junta. At a PUP meeting on 6 March 2010, Sompar\u00e9 criticized the opposition parties that chose to embrace the coup; he argued that their initial acceptance of the coup demonstrated that they were \"not sincere\" in their claimed commitment to democracy and constitutional governance.Mamadou Saliou Diallo, \"Aboubacar Sompar\u00e9 refait surface et pour combien de temps ?\", Aminata.com, 8 March 2010 .
