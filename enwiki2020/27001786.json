    "text": "Eugen Rehfisch (1862-1937) Eugen Rehfisch (6 March 1862 - 7 October 1937) was a German physician of Jewish descent born in Kempen (today- K\u0119pno, Poland). He studied medicine at the Universities of Berlin and W\u00fcrzburg, earning his doctorate in 1887. Soon afterwards he worked as a physician in Berlin, where he was a colleague of urologist Leopold Casper (1859-1959). From 1896 to 1900 he performed important urodynamic research at the university's institute of physiology. Later, he was awarded the title of professor. Rehfisch is remembered for his investigations on the physiology of micturition and bladder innervation, and is credited as being the first to gauge the phenomena of bladder pressure and urinary flow simultaneously in a human being.ISHN 2001 Annual Meeting -- Abstracts Remarks on the development of neuro-urology From these experiments, he helped lay a foundation for the advancement of modern urodynamics. The \"Eugen-Rehfisch-Preis\" is an award issued by the Forum Urodynamicum in recognition for achievements in the field of neuro-urology. From 1901 onwards, Rehfisch's scientific focus was largely in the disciplines of cardiology and psychiatry. He was the father of the playwright Hans Rehfisch. == Selected publications == * Ueber acute Spermatocystitis.
