    "text": "The Socialist Caucus of the Chicago City Council is a bloc of aldermen in the Chicago City Council that was formed in 2019. It currently has six members, out of the 50 aldermen that comprise the Council. Members of the caucus identify as democratic socialists. == History == The caucus was formed following the 2019 Chicago aldermanic election, when five of its six initial members were elected for the first time. All six initial members are members of the Chicago chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. All member of the caucus are also members of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus. All members of the Socialist Caucus are also members of the larger Progressive Reform Caucus. The two caucuses pursue similar policy goals, but the Socialist Caucus' stated goal is to push a wider and more aggressive range of left-wing policies. When asked about the distinction between the two caucuses in a July 2019 interview, caucus chair Carlos Ramirez-Rosa provided the example of a municipal takeover of the electric utility company ComEd as one distinctive policy that the Socialist Caucus would pursue. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Illinois, members of the caucus called for a wide-ranging recovery package including an paid emergency leave, emergency housing, an end to ICE check-ins, and weekly payments to workers and families. During the George Floyd protests, the caucus called for cutting funding to the Chicago Police Department and increasing funding for programs such as substance-abuse treatment, mental health care and after-school programs. == Membership == The following table lists current aldermen who are affiliated with the Socialist Caucus. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Member !Party !Ward !Main Community areas !Joined !First elected |- |Daniel La Spata |Democratic | Democratic |1 |West Town, Logan Square |2019 |2019 |- |Jeanette Taylor |Democratic | Democratic |20 |New City, Woodlawn, Englewood |2019 |2019 |- |Byron Sigcho-Lopez |Democratic | Democratic |25 |Lower West Side, Near West Side |2019 |2019 |- |Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez |Independent |Independent |33 |Irving Park, Avondale, Albany Park |2019 |2019 |- |Carlos Ramirez-Rosa |Democratic | Democratic |35 |Logan Square, Avondale |2019 |2015 |- |Andre Vasquez |Democratic | Democratic |40 |Lincoln Square, West Ridge |2019 |2019 |} == See also == * List of Democratic Socialists of America who have held office in the United States ==Notes== == References == Category:Democratic socialist organizations in the United States Category:Issue-based groups of legislators Category:Caucuses of the Chicago City Council ",
