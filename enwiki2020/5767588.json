They continued to operate under their individual names until April 2015, when the stores were rebranded Lunds & Byerlys. In 2006, they launched its online grocery shopping service. Shoppers have the option of either picking up their groceries at certain stores or having it delivered to their home. Russell Lund Jr., the son of Russell Lund Sr and the heir to the Lunds grocery empire, murdered his estranged wife and her lover. After turning himself in for the crime, he committed suicide. Lunds was founded as Hove's in the early twentieth century at the corner of Lake Street and Hennepin Avenue in the Uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis. Russell Lund, Sr., an employee, took an equity stake in the cheese and cracker department in 1922 and after founding a popcorn business, a larger stake in 1939. The chain took the Lunds name in 1964. ==History of Lunds store openings== * 1939 Minneapolis (Hennepin & Lake) * 1942 Edina (50th & France) * 1967 Richfield (Penn Avenue) * 1969 Minnetonka * 1983 St. Paul (Ford Parkway) * 1984 Wayzata * 1994 Bloomington (Normandale) * 2001 Plymouth * 2006 Orono (Navarre) * 2006 Minneapolis (Central & University) * 2012 Minneapolis (12th & Hennepin) * 2013 Prior Lake * 2014 Wayzata (Town Center) (Lunds & Byerlys Kitchen) Closed * 2014 St. Paul (downtown in the Penfield) ==Byerly's== Byerly's Golden Valley, MN Location The company was founded in 1968 by Don Byerly, who opened the first store in Golden Valley, Minnesota. Byerly's opened fourteen other stores in the metro area. Byerly's stores, which range in size from 50,000 to , were previously open 24 hours a day. Store hours changed in February 2008 and are now open 6am to 12am. Byerly's locations also offer in-store United States Post Offices, full-service banks, pharmacies, coffee shops, floral departments, wines & spirits shops, and formerly in-store Byerly's restaurants. All Byerly's branded restaurants have now closed, but a restaurant named \"Minnesota Grill\" still operates out of the Roseville store location offering limited Lund's and Byerly's food items. The store is known for its \"great customer service\" and its deli and bakery. Byerly's is commonly viewed as high-end grocery shopping, and prices are therefore relatively similar to other retail stores selling the same brands. Product quality however is the core focus of Lunds & Byerlys and the prices reflect higher quality products. In April 1997, the company was purchased by Lund Food Holdings, Inc., parent company of Edina-based Lunds. ==History of Byerly's store openings== * 1968 Golden Valley * 1971 St. Paul (East Side) (closed) * 1973 Edina (France Ave/Southdale) (Rebuilt as new structure in 2014https://www.andersoncompanies.us/byerlys-edina/) * 1977 St. Cloud * 1980 St. Louis Park * 1982 Minnetonka * 1986 Bloomington (Lyndale) (closed) * 1987 Roseville * 1988 Burnsville * 1994 Chanhassen * 1996 Eagan * 1999 Maple Grove * 2006 Minneapolis * 2014 Woodbury * 2014 Eden Prairie. ==History of Lunds & Byerlys store openings== * 2015 Minnetonka (Glen Lake) * 2018 White Bear Lake ==References== ==External links== * Lunds & Byerlys website Category:Companies based in Edina, Minnesota Category:Supermarkets of the United States Category:Retail companies established in 1939 Category:Privately held companies based in Minnesota Category:1939 establishments in Minnesota ",
