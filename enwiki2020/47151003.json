L\u00e9ger is best known for the acclaimed novel God Loves Haiti (2015), which the New York Times praised as \"a powerful portrait of a nation in peril and the citizens who inhabit it.\" His writing has appeared in many magazines and newspapers. Since 2010, he has worked as a communications advisor at the United Nations around the world, including in Haiti, Switzerland, and Mali. ==Biography== Dimitry Elias L\u00e9ger was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Sept. 27, 1971. His childhood life alternated between New York City and Port-au-Prince until the age of 14, when he permanently moved to Brooklyn. He became a journalist in 1993 and worked as deputy editor of The Source magazine and a staff writer at Fortune magazine, The Miami Herald and MTV News. His writing has also appeared in The New York Times op-ed page, The Washington Post \"Book World\", The New York Observer and the now defunct The Face magazine in the UK. He became an advisor to the United Nations following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. ==Reception== L\u00e9ger\u2019s publication of the novel God Loves Haiti with HarperCollins on January 6, 2015 led Time Out New York to declare the book \u201cone of the year\u2019s most powerful debut novels. The New York Observer hailed L\u00e9ger as an \u201cimportant new voice.\u201d The newspaper noted the book\u2019s \u201cpeppery Port-au-Prince slang and untranslated French phrases\u201d in a \u201cmelodic and unpredictable debut.\u201d The New Yorker magazine noted \u201cL\u00e9ger writes with fabulist exuberance and an eye for the absurd.\u201d In the New York Times Book Review, critic Regina Marler offered a similar assessment of the novel\u2019s \u201cuneasy tone\u201d that is \"satirical-romantic, tragicomic, cynical-sentimental.\" Dante scholars praised the connection between God Loves Haiti and the Divine Comedy, the 700-year-old poem by the Italian writer Dante Alighieri. A review in the website Dante Today said, \" If you are looking for The Divine Comedy in God Loves Haiti, imagine what Dante\u2019s three-story structure might look like after an earthquake. In L\u00e9ger\u2019s narrative landscape, Inferno, Purgatario, Paradiso are collapsed onto each other in a heap of dust and rubble. There\u2019s room to regret past choices; there\u2019s no clear route to paradise. Yet in the hellish expanses of destruction L\u00e9ger manages to uncover shards of redemptive beauty and even a medieval plot twist: his eventual solution to the love triangle is far more Beatrice than Beyonc\u00e9.\" ==Awards and honors== * 2016 PEN/Open Book Award finalist for God Loves Haiti ==Education== L\u00e9ger holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from St. John's University. He studied international development in the mid-career masters in public administration program at Harvard Kennedy School of Government. In 2005, he was awarded a global leadership fellowship from the World Economic Forum, the Geneva, Switzerland-based foundation famous for organizing the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of world leaders and CEOs in Davos, Switzerland. ==References== ==External links== *Review of God Loves Haiti in the New York Times *Essay by L\u00e9ger about migration problems facing Haitians *Essay by L\u00e9ger about life in the shadow of the Duvallier dictatorship *Article by L\u00e9ger about The Source magazine Category:Living people Category:21st-century American novelists Category:1971 births Category:Writers from New York City Category:Writers from Brooklyn Category:American expatriates in France Category:Haitian emigrants to the United States Category:21st-century Haitian novelists Category:Haitian male novelists Category:John F.
