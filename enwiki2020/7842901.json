Formed by the confluence of two of its tributaries, the Francis Branch and the Cushman Branch, Slate Run flows generally southeast to join Pine Creek at the community of Slate Run. The first or so of the main stem are in the Tioga State Forest in Tioga County, and the rest passes through the Tiadaghton State Forest in Lycoming County. Named tributaries include Morris Run and Red Run, which enter from the left, and Manor Fork, which enters from the right. The relevant map quadrangles for the entire stream from mouth to source are Slate Run and Lee Fire Tower. Slate Run, a popular fishery, supports wild brook and brown trout. Fishing is allowed year-round, but anglers are limited to fly fishing with barbless hooks and must return all caught trout to the stream. Other fish in the creek include eastern blacknose dace, longnose dace, slimy sculpins, and white suckers. ==See also== *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of Pine Creek (Pennsylvania) Category:Rivers of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Tioga County, Pennsylvania ",
