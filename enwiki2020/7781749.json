    "text": "The Governor's Award () is a prestigious annual award given to Albanian students worldwide that have developed the best diploma theses at the completion of their undergraduate studies. ==History== The undergraduate dissertations should be of high scientific standards and should concern crucial issues related to the Bank of Albania (the sole monetary authority in the country) as well as issues related to the macroeconomic and financial frames of the state. The ceremony is held every year during the conference proceedings of the Bank of Albania. The first ceremony was held on October 31, 2006. A scientific committee of Albanian and foreign representatives evaluated more than thirty dissertations submitted by Albanian students from all over the world and three prizes were awarded to the following students: the First Prize (Gold Medal) to Gizelda Emini, a Finance graduate of the University of Tirana, the Second Prize (Silver Medal) to Arber Borici, a Computer Science and Economics graduate of the University of New York, Tirana, and the Third Prize (Bronze Medal) to Lorena Gega, a Finance graduate of the University of Tirana. The current Governor of the Bank of Albania, Mr. Ardian Fullani, emphasized that this award will encourage prospective students to develop advanced dissertations along with undergraduate research in public and private universities in Albania. ==External links== * Bank of Albania (Official Site) == See also == * List of general science and technology awards * List of economics awards *Civil awards and decorations of Albania *University of New York, Tirana *University of Tirana ==References== Governor's Award for Albania Category:Albanian awards Category:Awards established in 2006 ",
