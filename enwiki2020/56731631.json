    "text": "Alexandra Bell (born 1983) is an American multidisciplinary artist. She is best known for her series Counternarratives, large scale paste-ups of New York Times articles edited to challenge the presumption of \"objectivity\" in news media. Using marginalia, annotation, redaction, and revisions to layout and images, Bell exposes what she perceives as the pervasive racial and gender biases embedded in print news media. == Life and education == Bell was born and raised in Chicago. She cites visual artists such as Glenn Ligon, Jenny Holzer, and Chilean artist Alfredo Jaar as inspirations. Bell holds a Bachelor of Arts in interdisciplinary studies from the University of Chicago. She also received her Masters from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 2013. == Work and critical reception == Bell's work has appeared in major group and solo exhibitions across the United States, including the 2019 Whitney Biennial, which featured a newly commissioned series of prints titled No Humans Involved: After Sylvia Wynter, which looks at the New York Daily News\u2019 reporting of the Central Park Five case. Among other accolades, Bell received the 2018 International Center of Photography Infinity Award in the applied category and was a 2018 Open Society Soros Equality Fellow. == Exhibitions and installations== === Solo === *Atlanta Contemporary, Atlanta, Georgia, August 26 \u2013 December 17, 2017 *Bennington College, Bennington, Vermont, October 10 \u2013 December 15, 2017 *MoMA PS1, Long Island City, New York, November 9 \u2013 December 11, 2017 *Pomona College Museum of Art, Claremont, California, March 2 \u2013 May 13, 2018 *Spencer Museum of Art University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, March 5 \u2013 April 8, 2018 *Allen Memorial Art Museum and Oberlin College Libraries, Oberlin, Ohio, October 30 \u2013 December 21, 2018 === Group === *An unassailable and monumental dignity, CONTACT Gallery, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, September 21 \u2013 November 18, 2017 *Lack of Location Is My Location, Koenig & Clinton Gallery, Brooklyn, New York, November 3, 2017 \u2013 January 14, 2018, 2017 *Hold These Truths, The Nathan Cummings Foundation New York City, November 13, 2017 \u2013 March 14, 2018 *Original Language, Cue Foundation, New York City, September 6 \u2013 October 11, 2018 *Punch (curated by Nina Chanel Abney), Jeffrey Deitch, New York, September 15 \u2013 October 27, 2018 *The Legacy of Lynching: Confronting Racial Terror In America (organized with the Brooklyn Museum, Equal Justice Initiative, and Google), Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery at Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania, October 26, 2018 \u2013 December 16, 2018 *2019 Whitney Biennial (curated by Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta), Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, May 17 \u2013 September 22, 2019 *Direct Message: Art, Language, and Power, MCA Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, October 26, 2019 \u2013 January 26, 2020 == References== ==External links== * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Brooklyn Category:21st-century American artists Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism alumni Category:African-American contemporary artists Category:American women artists ",
