    "text": "Parahita is a system of astronomy prevalent in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, India. It was introduced by the Kerala astronomer Haridatta, (c. 683 AD). Nilakanthan Somayaji (1444\u20131544), in his DrkkaraNa, relates how Parahita was created based on the combined observations of a group of scholars who had gathered for a festival at Tirun\u0101v\u0101y on the banks of the Bh\u0101ratappuzha River. The Sanskrit etymology literally means \"for the benefit of the common man\", and the intention was to simplify astronomical computations so that everyone could do it. Parahita is a significant step in the simplification of the siddhantic tradition. Of the two texts of the system, Grahac\u0101ranibandhana and Mah\u0101m\u0101rganibandhana, only the former is known. The system simplified the computational cycle of the Aryabhatiya by introducing a sub-aeon of 576 years and introduced a zero correction called vV\u0101gbh\u0101va based on which the system worked accurately around the time of Haridatta. p. 1059-60 Also Haridatta simplified the representation of numerals from the cumbersome notation of Aryabhata to the katapayadi system which gained wide currency in later Kerala mathematics. In the katapayadi system, numerals may be represented by various letters so that the large numerical tables required for astronomical computations could be represented as verses and memorized. The work Grahac\u0101ranibandhana-sangraha (932 AD) gives further details of the parahita technique. The methods were retained but some of the constants downgraded by Parameshvara in his DrggaNita (1483), and also by Achyuta Pisharati in his rAsigolasphuTanIti (1600). ==See also== *Drigganita ==References== Category:Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics Category:Hindu astronomy Category:History of Kerala ",
