    "text": "The air battle over Ni\u0161 occurred on 7 November 1944 over Ni\u0161, in Serbia, between the Air Forces of the United States and the Soviet Union in World War II due to both countries mistaking the other for Germans. After the successful joint offensive in October 1944 and the expulsion of German forces to the north, the military units of the Red Army had been ordered to follow in their steps. On 7 November, a long column of vehicles belonging to 6th Guards Rifle Corps of the Red Army was moving from Ni\u0161 towards Belgrade, with orders to reinforce the southern wing of the Hungarian front. Suddenly, at about 10 AM, from southeast over the Jastrebac mountain, three groups of American P-38 Lightning fighter planes arrived and the first group immediately started to strafe the leading vehicles, destroying several, with 31 killed and 37 wounded. The commander of the corps, Lieutenant General Grigory Petrovich Kotov, was also killed in this attack. While the second group of US P-38 planes were starting their attack, the commander of the 17th Air Army, General Sudec, who was at the Ni\u0161 airbase at the time, issued an order for immediate takeoff to the pilots on duty flying Yakovlev Yak-3 fighters from 659th Regiment of 288th Air Division based at Ni\u0161, believing they were being attacked by German Focke-Wulf Fw 189 fighters. The American planes shifted their fire to the Soviet fighters which were taking off in spite of clearly visible large red star markings on their wings. One of the Yak-3s was destroyed right away. The P-38s then climbed to about 500 m and formed a defensive circle above the city of Ni\u0161 itself, waiting to see how this uncertain situation would be resolved. According to aeronautical engineer Dragoslav Dimi\u0107, who as a child was among the gathered inhabitants of Ni\u0161, the remaining Soviet fighters flew over the old city fortress at an altitude of only 20 m and attacked the Lightnings from below in a steep climb. One Lightning burst into flames and fell to the ground near the airstrip of the Ni\u0161 airbase. The Yaks flew through the circling Lightnings and attacked them again, this time from above. One of the Yaks was hit by American fire and fell to the ground. Soon the battle was joined by a second group of Yaks led by a famous Soviet fighter ace Captain Koldunov, who took off from another airbase near Ni\u0161. The 'tangle of death' that formed in the air moved westward across the city with the sound of machine gun and cannon fire. 9 Soviet Yak-3 and an unidentified number of US P-38 fighters participated in the battle, which lasted for about another 15 minutes. According to American author Glenn Bows, 4 Yaks and 2 Lightnings were lost, while Russian sources state that 3 Yaks and 4 P-38s had been destroyed. Joko Drecun, a partisan officer who was based at Ni\u0161 airport at the time, wrote in his diary that the Americans lost 7 planes and the Soviets lost 3 planes. The United States apologized to the Soviet Union, stating that the attack was the result of a grave error by American pilots sent to attack German forces on the road from Skopje to Pristina. On 14 December, American ambassador to the Soviet Union W. Averell Harriman apologized on behalf of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George C. Marshall and offered to send liaison officers to the 3rd Ukrainian Front to prevent further incidents; Stalin rejected it, because a line of demarcation had been drawn indicating the boundaries of Allied air actions. ==See also== *Belgrade Offensive ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:Balkans campaign (World War II) Category:1944 in Yugoslavia Category:Soviet Union\u2013United States relations Category:Air-to-air combat operations and battles Category:November 1944 events ",
