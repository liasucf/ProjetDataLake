    "text": "Ali Mahmood Awad Irsan (; born December 27, 1957\"Irsan, Ali Awas Mahmoud.\" Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Retrieved on September 9, 2018.) is a Jordanian-American convicted murderer held on Texas death row. He was sentenced for the murders of Iranian-American activist Gelareh Bagherzadeh (), a friend of one of his daughters; and his son-in-law, Coty Beavers, in Greater Houston. Multiple media reports described the crimes as honor killings. ==Background== ===Ali Irsan and his family=== Ali Irsan was born to a father in the Jordanian Army. Irsan, using a student visa, came to the United States in 1979, and became a naturalized United States citizen. He lived on a property in a rural area, in unincorporated eastern Montgomery County, Texas, near Conroe. \\- The address quoted in the article shows that the house was in an unincorporated area. Craig Malisow of the Houston Press stated that Irsan \"considered himself to be a devout Muslim.\" Irsan studied in a \"medical laboratory\" program at Kirkwood Community College. He stated in court filings that he studied in a medical program at a tertiary institution in Jordan, and he also stated that he had a Houston Community College \"diploma of auto -mechanic\". Irsan, then 22, married his first wife when she was 17. He and Robin Dahl first met in 1979 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa while he studied in community college and she worked on her GED. They married circa 1980, and moved to the Houston area by 1984. The couple had four children, with their first being born in 1981. In 1994 Irsan divorced his first wife. When Irsan was 35, he traveled to Jordan and entered into an arranged marriage with a girl, Shmou Ali Alrawabdeh (), who was approximately 15 or 16. His first wife left the house shortly after he married his second wife. Alrawabdeh, a Jordanian national,\"Coordinated Effort Results In Multiple Charges Against Jordanian National And Family Members.\" U.S. Department of Justice. May 23, 2014. Retrieved on September 9, 2018. arrived in the U.S. circa 1995. In federal court, Irsan stated that he married her in Jordan but that he did not legally marry her in the United States. Alrawabdeh had eight children with him while they lived in the United States; including those from his other wife, the total number of children fathered by Irsan is 12. She naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2001. In 1999 Irsan killed Amjad Hussein Alidam (), the husband of Nasemah Rachelle Irsan (), Irsan's eldest daughter, at Irsan's residence. Alidam was an Iraqi immigrant to the U.S. and a Shia Muslim. Irsan stated that he did the killing in self-defense. Irsan never received criminal charges in that case, as area law enforcement believed him to be innocent. A Montgomery County grand jury did not indict Irsan for his murder. Nasemah was sent back to Jordan. ===Nesreen Irsan Beavers, Nadia Irsan, Gelareh Bagherzadeh, and Cory Beavers=== Two of Irsan's daughters, Nadia (), and Nesreen (), were children of the previous wife. Nadia is a U.S. citizen, and the family previously educated them through homeschooling. After Irsan suffered a heart attack and was diagnosed with a heart condition, Nesreen and Nadia were able to convince their father to allow her and her sister to go to medical school to become doctors to ensure their father\u2019s health would be properly maintained. To their surprise, Irsan allowed Nadia and Nesreen to enroll in a tertiary institution, a biology program at Lone Star College- Montgomery. Candace Strang, a professor at Lone Star who taught the women stated that, as paraphrased by Malislow in a Houston Press article, Nadia and Nesreen \"fought hard to convince their father to let them enroll\". While there, Nesreen and her older sister, Nadia, met Coty Beavers and his twin brother, Cory, there. Beavers was a Christian while the girls were Muslims; at the time both girls wore hijab. Within a few months, the girls began taking off their hijabs and wearing makeup at school. Nesreen very quickly fell in love with Coty Beavers, and the two began secretly dating. While Nesreen initially had the help and support of her big sister, Nadia, after Nadia\u2019s romantic feelings for Coty\u2019s twin brother, Cory, were not returned, Nadia quickly became jealous of her sister\u2019s new relationship and quickly retreated back into the role of dutiful daughter to Irsan. The two women and Cory Beavers were admitted to the molecular genetics program at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in the Texas Medical Center; at MD Anderson Nesreen met Bagherzadeh, an Iranian. Bagherzadeh, a medical student and medical researcher, had molecular genetics as her area of study. She was born in France and was from Tehran. She studied biology in Tehran and later attended university in Budapest, Hungary, before moving to Houston in 2007 to join her parents, who bought a house near Uptown Houston (the area around the Houston Galleria) so she could live there; this residence was within the Woodway Point townhomes, and an area street would become the site of her death. Nesreen introduced Coty Beavers\u2019 twin brother, Cory, to Bagherzadeh. Bagherzadeh publicly protested in favor of women's rights on numerous occasions and criticized the Iranian government. She participated in the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests that were held in Houston and also protested against the Al-Hadi Mosque, which she accused of being connected to the Iranian government. Lomi Kriel of the Houston Chronicle wrote that \"she was outspokenly critical of Islam, even becoming embroiled in an argument with her father's bosses about their faith.\" She was a member of Second Baptist Church, as she had converted to Christianity in 2011. When Nesreen chose to leave Islam and become a Christian, Bagherzadeh gave her support, and Bagherzadeh also suggested that Nesreen marry her love, Coty Beavers. Nesreen and Coty Beavers became romantically involved in secret after meeting in 2011 while enrolled at Lone Star-Montgomery. Brian Rogers of the Houston Chronicle stated that Nadia felt jealousy over her sister Nesreen\u2019s relationship with Coty Beavers, especially after Nadia\u2019s feelings for Coty\u2019s twin brother, Cory, were not reciprocated; Irsan told his daughters that they were not allowed to date. According to court testimony, Irsan threatened the girls with death if they engaged in romantic relationships, and also stated he would kill their boyfriends if that were ever the case. (the apartment complex was the place where Beavers died) According to Texas prosecutors, Nadia wished to be in a relationship with Cory Beavers, but he declined. The relationship between Nesreen and Nadia deteriorated. Nesreen later found employment at MD Anderson. ===Kidnapping, escape, harassment, and marriage=== Irsan learned about Nesreen's relationship to Beavers while he was in Jordan. In June 2011 Alrawabdeh held her against her will at Irsan's residence; Nesreen accused Nadia of also holding her against her will. The persons/people holding her captive had discovered e-mails, text messages, and voice mails sent to and from Coty Beavers on Nesreen's communication device. She escaped through a window and went to be with Beavers at his residence, then his mother's house in Spring. In November 2011 Cory Beavers and Bagherzadeh became romantically involved. Nesreen stated she was afraid that her father would harm her. Her father and other members of the family looked for her and sent messages to Bagherzadeh, who refused to divulge the information. He remained unaware of the location of her residence. Beginning around fall 2011, Irsan harassed Nesreen, Coty Beavers, and Bagherzadeh, and the group experienced acts of vandalism against their property. Nesreen, who was 23 at the time, got a protective order that banned her father from contacting her, but he continued to look for her. For those reasons she chose not to attend the graduation ceremony for her class. Circa July 2012, Nesreen married Coty Beavers, taking the name Nesreen Irsan Beavers, and only holding a civil ceremony to avoid getting unwanted attention, doing so at the Harris County Courthouse. The two moved to a new residence a significant distance away from their previous one; they were at the Legacy Park Apartments in unincorporated northwest Harris County, which would become the site of Beavers' death. (the address is shown to give a precise location of the crime scene) Nesreen and Beavers chose a gated apartment complex specifically for their protection, and they rented a third-floor unit to minimize their possibility of being attacked. Whenever Nesreen left the apartment to travel to and from work, Beavers escorted her to protect her. He also had an assault rifle in case he needed to use self- defense. In an interview with the Houston Chronicle, Nesreen stated that historically law enforcement in the Houston area had difficulty with honor crimes because they did not understand the culture and the ramifications for violating honor codes. ===Federal fraud convictions=== Nesreen told authorities that Irsan had committed fraud related to Social Security. The family received money from the Social Security Administration (SSA), called Supplemental Security Income (SSI), for people who are unable to work and do not have resources, but Irsan and his family concealed their resources even though he told the government that beginning in 1990 he was unable to find work. Irsan held his money in multiple bank accounts, with some under the names of his children while having de facto control over them, while also claiming benefits and hiding the true amount of money he controlled. He also possessed multiple false credit cards, some under false names and some in the names of family members. The criminal schemes began in 1995. Agencies investigating included multiple agencies in the federal, state, and local levels, among them the FBI, SSA, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Homeland Security Investigations, and the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. A group of police, with the FBI leading, arrested Irsan, Alrawabdeh, and Nadia on May 22, 2014, accusing them of offenses related to fraud perpetrated against the social security system. Irsan was held in the Joe Corley Detention Facility/Joe Corley Processing Center, a private correctional facility in Conroe, Texas, operated by the GEO Group which, in addition to housing immigration prisoners, acts as a detention center for the U.S. Marshals Service. All three suspects were also held at Federal Detention Center, Houston in Downtown Houston. Federal authorities did not allow him to post bond; Alrawabdeh and Nadia were also held. Six of Irsan's children who were still minors were put in the custody of child protective services (CPS). The prosecuting federal attorneys were Jim McAlister and Mark McIntyre. Lawyer John Floyd represented Irsan in regard to his federal prosecution. The FBI raided the house another time on June 5, 2014. Irsan was initially charged with conspiracy to benefits fraud in a continuing scheme, defraud the United States, and theft of public money over $1,000. On April 3, 2015, Irsan pleaded guilty,\"Conroe Family Handed Federal Prison Sentences.\" U.S. Department of Justice. July 6, 2015. Retrieved on September 9, 2018. to \"conspiracy to defraud the United States\", while Alrawabdeh and Nadia were convicted of \"making false statements\".\"Conroe Family Guilty Of Disability Fraud.\" U.S. Department of Justice. April 3, 2015. Retrieved on September 9, 2018. All were sentenced to serve time in the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Irsan received a federal sentence of 45 months and a fine of $290,651 from Judge Lynn Hughes. Alrawabdeh and Nadia each received 24 months. The arrests and prosecutions were not covered in the Jordanian news media. ==Murders== ===Bagherzadeh's murder=== Bagherzadeh was murdered while in her father's car, outside of her parents' residence on January 15, 2012. Bagherzadeh was 30 at the time of her death. The triggerperson, using a .38 caliber handgun, shot Bagherzadeh through Alrawabdeh's passenger side window, hitting Bagherzadeh in the head with one bullet that went through the passenger side window of the car she drove. Alrawabdeh stated that Nasim Irsan (), Irsan's son, was the triggerperson. Bagherzadeh was driving from the residence of her boyfriend Cory Beavers to her parents' residence, (the street names and numbers establish the precise locations of the crimes: the second occurred in an unincorporated area; Bagherzadeh's parents have since moved away) while talking on the telephone with a former boyfriend. Up to three other bullets were fired at her car. Her car hit a townhouse's garage, and police found her body around 12:30 AM; a shooting had been first reported around 11:45 PM.\"Investigation into Fatal Shooting at 894 Augusta Drive.\" Houston Police Department. January 17, 2012. Retrieved on September 11, 2018. Prosecutors stated that Irsan; Alrawabdeh; and Nasim Irsan were together in a car. At 12:30 A.M. a Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) officer stopped the car going 79 miles per hour, above the speed limit, on Interstate 45, while it was going back to Montgomery County. Irsan was given a warning and allowed to leave after he stated he was trying to get a drink to deal with a diabetic condition. Initially no leads were announced, and Crime Stoppers stated that there was a $250,000 reward for information that could solve the case. Craig Malisow of the Houston Press described the award as \"record-high\". This became the highest reward in U.S. Crimestoppers history. Shortly after the killings, Bagherzadeh's allies and friends believed that the Iranian government had Bagherzadeh assassinated. Authorities had questioned Ali Irsan, as Nesreen had stated he was a culprit, but authorities did not keep him in custody as they had not obtained proof. ===Beavers's murder=== Coty Beavers was murdered at his residence at the Legacy Park apartments, on November 12, 2012. According to Alrawabdeh, Irsan personally shot Beavers. He had entered the apartment while it was unlocked and stayed inside while Beavers was with Nesreen; Beavers went with her to her car, before she drove away to her workplace, around 5:45 A.M. Irsan shot him after Beavers re-entered the house. Irsan was in hiding inside a bedroom before he killed his victim, 28 at the time of his death, with five or more bullets. Alwarabdeh was also present at Beavers's murder. According to court testimony, Irsan had anticipated that Nesreen would be with him and intended to kill her too. Nesreen found Beavers's body, at about 4:30 P.M. Two days prior to the killing, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office (HCSO), a suspect asked people in Legacy Park for the whereabouts of Beavers. Cory Beavers stated to the news channel KPRC that his brother \"said basically if I'm ever killed or murdered it was Ali Irsan. I mean he was that specific about it.\" Beavers's mother, Shirley McCormick, stated in Irsan's state trial that \"We knew who was responsible, but we didn\u2019t know who all had helped him. I told [the police officers] it was Ali Irsan, and he also had to be the one who killed Gelareh.\" ===Motive=== Prosecutors of the Harris County government stated that Nesreen's conversion and marrying a Christian man motivated the father to commit the murders. In her court testimony, Alrawabdeh stated that Irsan planned to also kill Nesreen, Cory Beavers, and the Beavers twins' mother. She stated \"If a girl ran away from home, it would bring disgrace to the family.\" Stating that the difference in religion and the element of premarital sex would reflect poorly on Irsan, Alrawabdeh stated, \"I\u2019m from an Arabic country and I\u2019m aware of the culture. The family would kill her to clean their honor.\" According to prosecutors, Irsan wished to kill Nesreen's loved ones first to inflict emotional distress on her, before killing her at a later date. Devon Anderson, the Harris County district attorney in 2015, stated that Irsan \"believed that [Nesreen] and others, including the two victims, had violated his honor as a Muslim.\" ==Prosecution== ===Investigation, arrest, and pre-trial detention=== Officers of the Harris County Sheriff's Office (HCSO) searched Irsan's residence nine days after Beavers's death. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted surveillance on the suspects. On the day Irsan was arrested for federal fraud charges, May 22, 2014, Harris County prosecutors announced that Irsan was also being charged for Bagherzadeh's murder. By March 2015 those charges were dismissed, but the Harris County authorities stated they would file additional charges. Harris County district attorney Anderson did not say why the initial charges were dropped with newer ones later filed; Michael Barajas of the Houston Press stated \"It appears that decision was purely strategic\". After prosecutors established the connection between the two killings, new capital murder charges against Irsan were filed on April 22, 2015, charging him for the murders of both Bagherzadeh and Beavers. According to Texas state law, capital murder can be filed if two killings are connected as part of the same scheme. Irsan's lawyers stated that he had no connection to either murder and the circumstances of the murders were not known. They also stated that the murders of Bagherzadeh and Beavers were not connected. The federal government continued to hold Irsan, Alrawabdeh, and Nadia while Harris County prosecutors announced new criminal charges in 2015. Nadia Irsan received charges accusing her of stalking her sister, a felony to the third degree; the maximum possible sentence, if convicted, would be 10 years. Prosecutors can file murder charges against her if they find that she had helped plan any murders, due to the rule of parties statutes. Nasim, charged with Bagherzadeh's murder, was arrested on April 22, 2015 and subsequently moved to the Harris County jail; he was 21 at the time. His bail was set at $500,000. Alwarabdeh also was charged with Bagherzadeh's murder, as she had allowed the triggerperson to use her window to kill Bagherzadeh. By May 1, 2015, Nadia remained in federal incarceration while her father and stepmother were moved to the Harris County jail. In the courtroom, Irsan asked for the state to not notify the Jordanian government, citing that he was a citizen of the United States. Later in 2015 Nadia was moved to the Harris County Jail, and she was given house arrest in January 2017 with a $250,000 bail. Texas State District Judge Jan Krocker scheduled Nadia's stalking trial for July 2017. In the meantime Krocker chose house arrest since Nadia had only been accused of stalking. After state criminal charges had been announced, an anonymous person claiming to be one of Irsan's children created a petition stating that \"racial prejudice and discrimination\" had victimized the family. While Montgomery County authorities stated they were re-investigating the 1999 death of Alidam, they would only file charges on the matter if new evidence was presented. ===Murder trial and sentencing=== The Bob Casey Federal Courthouse in Downtown Houston, the site of the capital murder trial of Ali Irsan, prosecuted by the State of Texas Allan B. Polunsky Unit near Livingston, Texas houses the State of Texas death row for men. Irsan's capital murder trial began on June 25, 2018. It was held at the Bob Casey Federal Courthouse in Downtown Houston. The normal venue for state felony cases, the Harris County Criminal Courthouse in Downtown, had sustained damage from Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and the post-storm restoration was not yet complete. The prosecutors sought the death penalty against Irsan, making it the first death penalty prosecution in Houston in 2018, and also the first death penalty case during the tenure of Kim Ogg, the Harris County district attorney since January 1, 2017. Anna Emmons, Marie Primm, and Jon Stephenson were appointed special prosecutors, since Ogg's first assistant, prior to the beginning of the murder trial, represented a suspected co-conspirator in another case; Ogg recused. Allen Tanner and Rudy Duarte were attorneys appointed by the judge to represent Irsan, while Katherine Scardino was the attorney appointed for Alrawabdeh. Jan Krocker served as the state district judge. Nesreen testified against her father, as did Cory Beavers, who lost his twin brother and girlfriend, and McCormick, who lost her son. Alrawabdeh entered into a plea deal that gave her a conviction of kidnapping instead of murder, and as part of the plea deal she testified against Irsan. Alrawabdeh was to be released with time served after the end of the trial. In 2019 prosecutors stated that her case is still open so long as she has additional testimony to give. In addition Dahl testified against her first husband, and first daughter Nesemah testified against her father. Two younger sisters of Irsan flew from Jordan to the U.S. to testify in his favor. Other relatives resident in Jordan used Skype to communicate with the court. Arabic translators translated testimony from people who lacked English fluency. Two sons of Irsan also testified in favor of their father. Even though his lawyers asked him not to, Irsan testified in his own trial. Irsan was declared guilty on July 26, 2018. The jurors came to this conclusion after 35 minutes of deliberation. In the punishment phase, which lasted two weeks, the jury deliberated between two possible outcomes for a capital murder conviction under Texas law: life without parole or the death penalty. Prosecutors presented a witness who accused Irsan of boasting about murdering Alidam without consequence in 1999. Nesreen testified that Irsan used severe corporal punishment, and that he praised the September 11, 2001 attacks and suicide bombings while living in the United States. On Tuesday, August 14, 2018, Irsan received a death sentence. The jury held a deliberation for nine hours before reaching the sentence. Irsan went into the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) on August 20 of that year. His head and beard were shaved due to TDCJ policy. Men sentenced to death under Texas law are normally held at the Polunsky Unit near Livingston, Texas.\"Death Row Facts.\" Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Retrieved on September 9, 2018. ===Subsequent developments=== In August 2019 Nasim Irsan, already in correctional custody for more than four years, reached a plea deal: he pleaded guilty to murder instead of capital murder and received a 40-year sentence, with time off for time already served. He may apply for parole around 2039. Alwarabdeh refused to testify against Nasim, and prosecutors stated this complicated their case against him. In November 2019 prosecutors filed a charge of conspiracy to commit murder against Nadia, with the potential sentencing range, if convicted, from 15 years to life imprisonment. She refused a potential plea deal which involved the stalking charge being dropped. Marie Primm, who served as the prosecutor pro tem, stated that this filing was not due to the addition of new facts, but rather due to where \"the evidence took us.\" ==Aftermath and analysis== Governor of Texas Greg Abbott wrote on Twitter that people who commit honor killings in Texas would be sentenced to death. Brian Rogers of the Houston Chronicle stated that experts considered the case to be unusual because usually only the offending woman is killed in an honor killing, and that the Irsan affair increased attention given to honor killings in the United States. Michael Creed, another brother of Coty Beavers, said \"You don\u2019t have to be Muslim to be a victim of an honor crime. These are not infrequent events that happen in some random part of the world. They\u2019re happening in America and they\u2019re on the rise.\" Beavers's father, Dennis Beavers, also stated \"If we in this country are not careful, a tragedy like ours could happen to your family.\" Relatives of Coty Beavers and Bagherzadeh stated that they became more fearful after the murders, with Cory and another brother of Beavers having guns for protection. On January 23, 2012 Bagherzadeh's funeral was held at Second Baptist Church. Her parents sold their Houston house and moved to Maryland, where their eldest son lived. Ebrahim Bagherzadeh, Bagherzadeh's father, stated that being in Houston reminds them of their daughter and makes them feel sad. The Houston Crimestoppers Memorial in Midtown Houston has a memorial to Bagherzadeh. Nesreen suggested that law enforcement allow potential victims of honor killings to change their identities to avoid being tracked down by vengeful family members. ==In media== The case was covered in the episode \"Deadly Dishonor\" in season two of the television program A Wedding and a Murder. Dateline NBC also had a two- hour episode airing in November 2019. ==See also== * Honor killing in the United States * Capital punishment in Texas * Crime in Houston * Islam in Houston * Christianity in Houston * Yaser Abdel Said ==References== ==Further reading== ; Media * \"Deliberate Evil - NBC Dateline - TV subscription service info needed to view content * * * * * * ==External links== * \"Investigation into Fatal Shooting at 894 Augusta Drive.\" Houston Police Department.
