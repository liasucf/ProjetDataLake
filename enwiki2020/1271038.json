    "text": "Zuni (also formerly Zu\u00f1i, endonym Shiwi\u02bcma) is a language of the Zuni people, indigenous to western New Mexico and eastern Arizona in the United States. It is spoken by around 9,500 people in total, especially in the vicinity of Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, and much smaller numbers in parts of Arizona. Unlike most indigenous languages in the US, Zuni is still spoken by a significant number of children and, thus, is comparatively less threatened with language endangerment. Edmund Ladd reported in 1994 that Zuni is still the main language of communication in the pueblo and is used in the home (Newman 1996).From \u201cPueblo of Zuni Head Start Program FY 2018 Annual Report\u201d available on the Zuni Pueblo web site: The Zuni Language and Culture Through the years, the Zuni Head Start Program has seen a decline of the native language spoken by children and their parents The parents of our children are young and speak mostly the English language. The lack of the native language spoken in the home is the primary reason our children do not speak their native language. Most parents are able to understand the native language but unable to speak the language fluently. Families who live with elders such as grandparents, aunts or uncles speak more of their native language and are fluent speakers. The percentage of children speaking their native language has declined over the last 29 years; therefore the Zuni Head Start Program has taken an active stance to incorporate the daily use of the Zuni language in the classrooms, which include the teaching of the Zuni culture. There is a lot of encouragement for everyone in the center to speak the Zuni language in social conversations so that our children will hear the language and become to be [sic] comfortable to speak [sic] their language. Language use of the children enrolled in Head Start: 137 Children spoke English as their primary language 15 Children spoke Zuni as their primary language. This indicates only 16 percent of the Zuni children are able to understand and speak their native language. The Zuni name for their own language, ' (shiwi \"Zuni\" + -\u02bcma \"vernacular\"; pronounced ) can be translated as \"Zuni way\", whereas its speakers are collectively known as \u02bcA\ua789shiwi (\u02bca\ua789(w)- \"plural\" + shiwi \"Zuni\"). ==Classification== Zuni is considered a language isolate. Zuni may have become a distinct language at least 7,000 years ago. The Zuni have, however, borrowed a number of words from Keresan, Hopi, and Pima pertaining to religion and religious observances.Hill, Jane H. \"Zunian as a Language Isolate.\" American Southwest Vol. 22, No. 2, Spring 2008, p. 3 A number of possible relationships of Zuni to other languages have been proposed by various researchers, although none of these has gained general acceptance. The main hypothetical proposals have been connections with Penutian (and Penutioid and Macro-Penutian), Tanoan, and Hokan phyla, and also the Keresan languages. The most clearly articulated hypothesis is Newman's (1964) connection to Penutian, but even this was considered by Newman (according to Michael Silverstein) to be a tongue-in-cheek work due to the inherently problematic nature of the methodology used in Penutian studies (Goddard 1996). Newman's cognate sets suffered from common problems in comparative linguistics, such as comparing commonly borrowed forms (e.g. \"tobacco\"), forms with large semantic differences (e.g. \"bad\" and \"garbage\", \"horse\" and \"hoof\"), nursery forms, and onomatopoetic forms (Campbell 1997). Zuni was also included under Morris Swadesh's Penutioid proposal and Joseph Greenberg's very inclusive Penutian sub-grouping \u2013 both without convincing arguments (Campbell 1997). Zuni was included as being part of the Aztec-Tanoan language family within Edward Sapir's heuristic 1929 classification (without supporting evidence). Later discussions of the Aztec-Tanoan hypothesis usually excluded Zuni (Foster 1996). Karl-Heinz Gursky published problematic unconvincing evidence for a Keresan-Zuni grouping. J. P. Harrington wrote one unpublished paper with the title \"Zu\u00f1i Discovered to be Hokan\" (Campbell 1997). ==Language contact== Zuni man As Zuni is a language in the Pueblo linguistic area, it shares a number of features with Hopi, Keresan, and Tanoan (and to a lesser extent Navajo) that are probably due to language contact. The development of ejective consonants in Zuni may be due to contact with Keresan and Tanoan languages which have complete series of ejectives. Likewise, aspirated consonants may have diffused into Zuni. Other shared traits include: final devoicing of vowels and sonorant consonants, dual number, ceremonial vocabulary, and the presence of a labialized velar (Campbell 1997). ==Phonology== The 16 consonants of Zuni (with IPA phonetic symbol when different from the orthography) are the following: :{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | ! rowspan=\"2\" | Bilabial ! colspan=\"2\" | Dental/Alveolar ! rowspan=\"2\" | Post- alveolar ! rowspan=\"2\" | Palatal ! colspan=\"2\" | Velar ! rowspan=\"2\" | Glottal |-class=small ! ! central ! lateral ! plain ! labial |- ! Plosive | p || t || || || || k, ky || kw || \u02bc |- ! Affricate | || ts || || ch || || || || |- ! Fricative | || s || \u0142 || sh || || || || h |- ! | Nasal | m || n || || || || || || |- ! Approximant | || || l || || y || || w || |} The vowels are the following: :{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" ! ! Front ! back |- ! High | i | u |- ! Mid | e | o |- ! Low | colspan=\"2\" | a |} Zuni syllables have the following specification: : C(C)V(\u02d0)(C)(C) ==Morphology== Word order in Zuni is fairly free with a tendency toward SOV. There is no case-marking on nouns. Verbs are complex, compared to nouns, with loose incorporation. Like other languages in the Southwest, Zuni employs switch- reference. Newman (1965, 1996) classifies Zuni words according to their structural morphological properties (namely the presence and type of inflectional suffixes), not according to their associated syntactic frames. His terms, noun and substantive, are therefore not synonymous. === Pronouns === Zuni uses overt pronouns for first and second persons. There are no third person pronouns. The pronouns distinguish three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and three cases (subject, object and possessive). In addition, some subject and possessive pronouns have different forms depending on whether they appear utterance-medially or utterance-finally (object pronouns do not occur utterance-medially). All pronoun forms are shown in the following table: {| class=wikitable !rowspan=2|Person and number !colspan=2|Subject !rowspan=2|Object !colspan=2|Possessive |-style=\"font-size:88%\" ! Medial !! Final !! Medial !! Final |--- |1st singular || ho\u02bc || ho\ua789\u02bco || hom || hom || homma |- |2nd singular || to\u02bc || to\ua789\u02bco || tom || tom || tomma |- |1st dual || hon || ho\u02bcno || ho\u02bcna\u02bc || ho\u02bcna\u02bc || ho\u02bcna\u02bc |- |2nd dual || ton || to\u02bcno || to\u02bcna\u02bc || to\u02bcna\u02bc || to\u02bcna\u02bc |- |1st plural || hon || ho\u02bcno || ho\u02bcna\u02bc || ho\u02bcn\u02bca\ua789wan || ho\u02bcn\u02bca\ua789wan |- |2nd plural || ton || to\u02bcno || to\u02bcna\u02bc || to\u02bcn\u02bca\ua789wan || to\u02bcn\u02bca\ua789wan |- |} There is syncretism between dual and plural non-possessive forms in the first and second persons. Utterances with these pronouns are typically disambiguated by the fact that plural pronouns agree with plural-marked verb forms. ==Sociolinguistics== * storytelling (telapnaawe) \u2013 Tedlock (1972) * ceremonial speech \u2013 Newman (1955) * slang \u2013 Newman (1955) ===Names=== Zuni adults are often known after the relationship between that adult and a child. For example, a person might be called \"father of so-and-so\", etc. The circumlocution is used to avoid using adult names, which have religious meanings and are very personal.Kroeber, Albert L. (1917). Zu\u00f1i kin and clan. Anthropological papers of the American Museum of Natural History (Vol. 18, Pt. 2). New York: The Trustees. (Online: digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/97). ==Orthography== There are twenty letters in the Zuni alphabet. A , B, CH, D, E , H, I , K, L, \u0141, M, N, O , P, S, T, U , W, Y, \u02bc * Double consonants indicate geminate (long) sounds, for instance the in shiwayanne \"car\", is pronounced [n\u02d0]. * Long vowels are indicated with a colon \ua789 following the vowel as the [a\u02d0] in wewa\ua789me \"animals\". * c is not part of the alphabet, although the digraph ch is. There are also other two letter combination sounds (like sh). * c, r, g, v, z, x, q, f, and j are not used to write Zuni, except for the occasional borrowed word. * it includes \u0141, \u0142 indicates IPA (a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative, pronounced like h and l together) * \u02bc indicates IPA (a glottal stop) \u2013 it is written medially and finally but not word-initially This orthography was largely worked out by Curtis Cook. ===Old orthographies=== Linguists and anthropologists have created and used their own writing system for Zuni before the alphabet was standardized. One was developed for Zuni by linguist Stanley Newman (Newman 1954). This practical orthography essentially followed Americanist phonetic notation with the substitution of some uncommon letters with other letters or digraphs (two letter combinations). A further revised orthography is used in Dennis Tedlock's transcriptions of oral narratives. A comparison of the systems is in the table below. ::{| class=\"wikitable\" ! Tedlock || Newman || Americanist || Current orthography || IPA |- | \u02bc || / || \u0294 || \u02bc || |- | \u02bc\u02bc || // || \u0294\u0294 || \u02bc\u02bc || |- | a || a || a || a || |- | aa || a\ua789 || a\u02d1 || a\ua789 || |- | ch || ch || \u010d || ch || |- | cch || chch || \u010d\u010d || chh || |- | e || e || e || e || |- | ee || e\ua789 || e\u02d1 || e\ua789 || |- | i || i || i || i || |- | ii || i\ua789 || i\u02d1 || i\ua789 || |- | h || j || h || h || |- | hh || jj || hh || hh || |- | k || k || k || k || |- | kk || kk || kk || kk || |- | kw || q || k\u02b7 || kw || |- | kkw || qq || k\u02b7k\u02b7 || kkw || |- | l || l || l || l || |- | ll || ll || ll || ll || |- | lh || lh || \u0142 || \u0142 || |- | llh || lhlh || \u0142\u0142 || \u0142\u0142 || |- | m || m || m || m || |} {| class=\"wikitable\" !

Tedlock's orthography uses \u02bc instead of Newman's / except at the beginning of words where it is not written. Additionally, in Tedlock's system, long vowels are written doubled instead with a length mark \ua789 as in Newman's system (e.g. aa instead of a\ua789) and h and kw are used instead of j and q. Finally, Tedlock writes the following long consonants \u2013 cch, llh, ssh, tts \u2013 with a doubled initial letter instead of Newman's doubling of the digraphs \u2013 chch, lhlh, shsh \u2013 and kkw and tts are used instead of Newman's qq and zz. ==Notes== ==References== *Bunzel, Ruth L.
