    "text": "Vladislav Anatolievich Horohorin, (), alias BadB, is a former hacker and international credit card trafficker who was convicted of wire fraud and served a seven-year prison sentence. == Early life == Horohorin was born on September 29, 1982, and grew up in Donetsk, Ukraine, emigrating in 1999 to Israel with his mother, where he served in the Israeli Defence Forces. == Investigation == According to the undercover investigation led by the United States Secret Service, Horohorin was one of the founders of CarderPlanet, one of several websites taken down in 2004, as part of the Secret Service's Operation Firewall investigation. The web sites were operated by cyber criminal organizations to traffic counterfeit credit cards, and false identification information and documents. These websites not only shared information on how to commit fraud, but also provided a forum through which to purchase fraud-related information and tools. \"The network created by the founders of CarderPlanet, including Vladislav Horohorin, remains one of the most sophisticated organizations of online financial criminals in the world,\" said Michael Merritt, Assistant Director for Investigations. \"This network has been repeatedly linked to nearly every major intrusion of financial information reported to the international law enforcement community. This arrest illustrates the significance of the Secret Service's commitment to traversing the globe in pursuit of online criminals.\" Horohorin promoted his illegal activities by creating video cartoons ridiculing American card holders. Separately, in 2013, Horohorin was named co-conspirator in an indictment, but was not subsequently charged, in a criminal case in District of New Jersey 09-626 (JBS), in which other Russian individuals were charged with successfully hacking Nasdaq, 7-Eleven, Carefour, JCPenney, Heartland Payment Systems, Dow Jones, Jetblue and 23 more corporations.http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/drinkman072513.pdfhttps://www.justice.gov/usao- nj/pr/five-indicted-new-jersey-largest-known-data-breach-conspiracy This breach was called the \"Largest known data breach conspiracy ever prosecuted\" by the U.S. Justice Department. As of April 2017, none of Horohorin's co- conspirators had been sentenced. == Arrest, extradition, guilty plea, and sentencing == Horohorin was identified as \"BadB\" in November 2009 in a sealed indictment from the United States attorney's office. He was arrested on August 7, 2010, in Nice, France, while attempting to board an air plane to Warsaw, Poland. However, due to the complexity of the international legal battle that followed his arrest, he was not extradited to the United States until June 6, 2012. During the proceedings in France, Horohorin was incarcerated in the Maison D'Arret D'Aix-Luynes near Aix-en-Provence, France. Horohorin was arraigned on June 7, 2012, and was detained pending trial. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs handled Horohorin's extradition from France. The case was prosecuted by attorneys Ethan Arenson (who later also prosecuted another notorious cyber criminal, Roman Seleznev), Carol Sipperly, and Corbin Weiss of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). The District of Columbia case was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service. Assistance was provided by the French Police Nationale Aux Frontiers and the Netherlands Police Agency's National Crime Squad High Tech Crime Unit. The FBI Atlanta Field Office provided information helpful to the investigation. The Northern District of Georgia case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nick Oldham and Lawrence R. Sommerfeld of the Northern District of Georgia, and trial attorney Sipperly of CCIPS. The Atlanta case was investigated by the FBI. Horohorin was represented by Arkady L. Bukh during proceedings in the U.S. On October 25, 2012, Horohorin pleaded guilty to two counts of access device fraud as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud. On April 5, 2013, Horohorin was sentenced to serve 88 months in prison for his role in the theft of more than $9 million from RBS Worldpay, (an Atlanta-based credit card processor), and trafficking in millions of stolen credit and debit cards. In February 2017, Horohorin was released and was deported from the United States.https://pp.userapi.com/c638131/v638131888/3bed1/3zunifG6wdU.jpg Horohorin works as private consultant and security auditor for cybersec.org. == References == == External links == *https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/08/BadB-Indictment-in- DC.pdf *https://lawfare.s3-us- west-2.amazonaws.com/staging/2017/GroupIndict2nd.pdf Second RBS Worldpay Indictment Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli computer criminals Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government Category:Russian computer criminals Category:Carding (fraud) Category:Hacking (computer security) Category:Hacking in the 2010s Category:Hacker culture Category:Fraudsters Category:People extradited from France Category:Extradition Category:People extradited to the United States Category:Israeli fraudsters Category:Russian fraudsters Category:Hacker groups Category:Hacking in the 2000s Category:People convicted of cybercrime ",
