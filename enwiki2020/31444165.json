    "text": "Sam Brenegan (born Olaf Selmar Brenegan) was a Major League Baseball catcher. He was a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1914. During his one and only game, Brenegan was hit in the hand while catching, which allowed a baserunner to move from second to third. For some time afterwards, any catcher who was hit hard in the hand by the ball was said to have \"pulled a brenegan\". ==References== Category:People from Galesville, Wisconsin Category:Baseball players from Wisconsin Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:1890 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Petersburg Goobers players Category:Portland Beavers players Category:Spokane Indians players Category:Rockford Wakes players Category:Hannibal Mules players Category:Dayton Veterans players Category:Muskegon Muskies players Category:St. Joseph Saints players ",
