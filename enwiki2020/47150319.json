    "text": "Mihajlo Bu\u010di\u0107 was a 16th-century Catholic priest who converted to Protestantism and became its propagandist. == Career == The date and place of Bu\u010di\u0107's birth and death are unknown. Bu\u010di\u0107 was a vicar in Belica and in Me\u0111imurje. Until 1565 he was a vicar in Stenjevac but had to move to estate of Juraj IV Zrinski in Nedeli\u0161\u0107e because of the conflict with Franjo Tahi. In 1574 Juraj Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, the bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb, strictly followed recommendations of the Council of Trent and expelled Bu\u010di\u0107 from Catholic church under accusations that his book was heretic propaganda of Protestantism. Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 also ordered burning of Bu\u010di\u0107s books and publishing of new books to dispute writings of Bu\u010di\u0107. It is possible that Postilla authored by Antun Vramec is published in 1586 in Vara\u017edin to follow the orders of Dra\u0161kovi\u0107. Bu\u010di\u0107 significantly contributed to spreading of Protentantism in the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia. Because Bu\u010di\u0107 enjoyed protection of the lord of Me\u0111imurje, Juraj IV Zrinski, thanks to whom (and later to his sons) this area was the only significant stronghold of Protestantism in Croatia for 50 years. == Bibliography == Bu\u010di\u0107 was the forerunner of the Vara\u017edin literary circle and one of the first writers on Kajkavian dialect. Two books he wrote were banned and burned during period of the counter reformation movement so there is no evidence about the language or script he used in them. Still, it is assumed that he wrote his works on Kajkavian dialect and also on Latin language. According to some sources Bu\u010di\u0107 published three of his works in Nedeli\u0161\u0107e. There are disputes if he wrote only on Latin language, or probably on Kajkavian or even \u010cakavian dialect.BIBL. M. K.: 133 varijacije na razne teme, Republika, 1959, 7-8; Illyricum sacrum, Kolo, 1963, 7. The Latin language title of his book he published probably between 6 February 1573 and 6 March 1574 was Contra realem praesentiam Corporis et Sanguinis Christi in sacramento Eucharistiae. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * Vjekoslav Klai\u0107, \"Mihajlo Bu\u010di\u0107 i Franjo Tahi\", Nastavni vjesnik, 1922 Category:History of the Serbo-Croatian language Category:16th- century Croatian people Category:16th-century deaths ",
