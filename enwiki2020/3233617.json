He finished grammar and high school in Zagreb, and enrolled onto the Faculty of Theology at the University of Zagreb. During the First World War, he was drafted into Austro-Hungarian Army where he took part in the fighting against Serbian forces on the Drina River. Later he was sent to the Eastern Front where he used the opportunity to defect to the Russians. From there he joined the Yugoslav volunteers fighting within the Serbian army on the Salonica Front. After the war, \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 gained his law degree at University of Zagreb, Faculty of Law, and after that, he opened a law office in Vrbovsko. There he met Vladko Ma\u010dek and joined the Croatian Peasant Party. In 1938, he was elected to the Yugoslav National Assembly. ==Political career== With King Peter II in Italy after meeting Tito. ===Ban of Croatia=== In August 1939, Ma\u010dek and Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107 reached the deal about the constitutional reconstruction of Yugoslavia and restoration of Croatian statehood in the form of Banovina of Croatia\u2014an autonomous entity which, together with Croatia proper, included large sections of today's Bosnia-Herzegovina and some sections of today's Vojvodina, which contained an ethnic Croat majority. \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 was appointed as the first ban, or titular head of this entity, in charge of its government. The Banovina came to an end together with Kingdom of Yugoslavia, following the invasion by Axis powers in April 1941. \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 joined Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107 and his Yugoslav government-in-exile. ===Government-in-exile=== In emigration, \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 first represented the Yugoslav royal government in the United States. Gradually, the widening gap between the royalist government and Yugoslav major resistance movement embodied in Tito and his Communist-dominated Partisans forced Winston Churchill to mediate. \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107, a non-Communist Croat, was appointed as the new prime ministerJournal of Croatian Studies, XXIV, 1983 \u2013 Annual Review of the Croatian Academy of America, Inc.

After publicly rejecting Mihailovi\u0107, \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 met with Tito on the island of Vis and signed the Tito\u2013\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement, which recognised the Partisans as the legitimate armed forces of Yugoslavia in exchange for Partisans formally recognising and taking part in the new government. \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 kept his post until 7 March 1945, when Tito formally became the prime minister of Yugoslavia. \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 was foreign minister in his cabinet until October, when he resigned, disagreeing with Communist policies of new government. ==Later life and death== \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 spent the remainder of his life away from the spotlight, dying 1955 in Zagreb.
