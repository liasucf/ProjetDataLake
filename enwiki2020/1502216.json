Decorated epinetra were placed on the graves of unmarried girls, or dedicated at temples of female deities. Because of the strong association between wool-working and the ideal woman and wife \u2014 as in the case of Penelope weaving in the Odyssey \u2014 it is a shape associated with the wedding.Compare the loutrophoros, which also had a strong connection to the wedding. Its decoration was not exclusively related to its own use, though it often was. Often the top surface was incised to make it rough in order to rub the wool fibers. There was often a female head placed at the closed end where the knee was covered. Epinetra were often decorated, sometimes depicting black figure amazon women, as in the case of an epinetron painted by Sappho between 500-490 BCE. ==References== ==External links== Category:Ancient Greek pot shapes ",
