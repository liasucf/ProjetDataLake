    "text": "The family Cisticolidae is a group of about 160 warblers, small passerine birds found mainly in warmer southern regions of the Old World. They were formerly included within the Old World warbler family Sylviidae. This family probably originated in Africa, which has the majority of species, but there are representatives of the family across tropical Asia into Australasia, and one species, the zitting cisticola, even breeds in Europe. These are generally very small birds of drab brown or grey appearance found in open country such as grassland or scrub. They are often difficult to see and many species are similar in appearance, so the song is often the best identification guide. These are insectivorous birds which nest low in vegetation. ==Taxonomy== The family was introduced (as Cisticolinae) by the Swedish zoologist Carl Jakob Sundevall in 1872. Many taxonomists place the red-winged prinia and the red- fronted prinia in the genus Prinia rather than in their own monotypic genera. Support for their placement in Prinia is provided by a molecular phylogentic study of the Cisticolidae published in 2013 that found that both species were closely related to the prinias. ==List of genera== The family contains 160 species divided into 26 genera: For more detail, see List of Cisticolidae species. * Neomixis, jeries (3 species) (genus is basal to all other Cisticolidae) * Cisticola, cisticolas (51 species) * Incana \u2013 monotypic, Socotra warbler (Incana incanus) * Prinia, prinias (27 species) * Schistolais, (2 species) * Phragmacia \u2013 monotypic, Namaqua warbler (Phragmacia substriata) * Oreophilais \u2013 monotypic, Roberts's warbler (Oreophilais robertsi) Rufous- eared warbler, Malcorus pectoralis * Micromacronus (2 species) * Urolais \u2013 monotypic, green longtail (Urolais epichlora) * Oreolais, (2 species) \u2013 moved here from Apalis * Drymocichla \u2013 monotypic, red-winged grey warbler (Drymocichla incana) * Spiloptila \u2013 monotypic, cricket warbler (Spiloptila clamans) * Phyllolais \u2013 monotypic, buff-bellied warbler (Phyllolais pulchella) * Apalis, apalises (24 species) * Malcorus \u2013 monotypic, rufous-eared warbler (Malcorus pectoralis) * Hypergerus \u2013 monotypic, oriole warbler (Hypergerus atriceps) * Eminia \u2013 monotypic, grey-capped warbler (Eminia lepida) * Camaroptera, (5 species) * Calamonastes, (4 species) * Euryptila \u2013 monotypic, cinnamon-breasted warbler (Euryptila subcinnamomea) * Bathmocercus, rufous warblers (2 species) * Scepomycter (2 species) - sometimes merged into Bathmocercus * Orthotomus, tailorbirds (13 species) * Artisornis, (2 species) * Poliolais \u2013 monotypic, white-tailed warbler (Poliolais lopezi) * Eremomela, (11 species) ==References== ==Further reading== * *Cibois, A., Slikas, B., Schulenberg, T.
