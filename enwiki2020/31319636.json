Hahn first started working on the opera during the First World War, imagining it as a 'Mozartian' work, with the role of Portia written specifically with the soprano Mary Garden in mind. The opera was first performed at the Paris Op\u00e9ra, on 25 March 1935.Patrick O'Connor in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera gives the date as 25 March 1935. It was revived at the Op\u00e9ra on 18 November 1949 and again on 19 February 1950, and in 1979 at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique under Manuel Rosenthal. The United States premiere was by the Portland Opera on 4 November 1996 under French conductor Marc Trautmann.
