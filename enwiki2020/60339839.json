Entertainment Weekly, May 19, 2020. The challenge is a parody of the game show Match Game (known as Blankety Blanks in Australia and Blankety Blank in the UK), except in seasons four and five of All Stars, when the format was changed to parody the game show The Dating Game under the name Snatch Game of Love. The challenge tests the contestants' skills at celebrity impersonation and improvisational comedy. It is normally staged approximately halfway through the season, although the number of contestants still in the race at the time of a Snatch Game challenge may vary from season to season. Snatch Game is commonly perceived as one of the most important and memorable challenges of the show and, in RuPaul's own words, the challenge separates \"the basic bitches from the fierce-ass queens.\"\"'RuPaul's Drag Race' episode 6 recap: Which queen won Snatch Game?\" . Mic, April 28, 2017. It is rare, although not unprecedented, for a queen to win the entire season without having placed at least high in the Snatch Game challenge: across 19 iterations of the game to date, only three contestants have ever won the season after not receiving any critiques (i.e. being safe) in the Snatch Game episode, and only three contestants have ever won a season after being placed in the bottom for their Snatch Game performance. Due to the show's format, impersonated celebrities are usually female, although there have been several instances of contestants choosing male celebrities whose public images were sufficiently flamboyant to fit in with a drag aesthetic;\"The 10 Tightest Snatch Game Characters on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" .

Gus Kenworthy and Keiynan Lonsdale played as bachelors looking for love, and each interviewed four celebrity contestants (who were actually the queens doing celebrity impersonations).

Kevin O'Keeffe from Into discusses that the challenge isn't only about the celebrity impersonation and RuPaul looks for accuracy, humor and the idea of the character. He also states that the challenge tests a lot of different skills, such as the queens' ability to put on a different look from their signature one, and also their ability to be \"funny on a dime\". RuPaul states each year, as the challenge is introduced, that the cardinal rule of the challenge is to make him laugh. Writing for Vulture, Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers state that \"Snatch Game\" is \"the mother of all comedy challenges on a reality show\" despite the varied results over the years. On a more critical reception of the challenge, Josh Lee, for PopBuzz, argues that while the annual challenge has given viewers some of the best moments from RuPaul's Drag Race, it is starting to feel stale overall. He comments that recent celebrity impersonations in the challenge have been lackluster and the show should adapt and retire \"Snatch Game\" in future seasons of the series. ==References== Category:RuPaul's Drag Race ",
