The Sailor's Song was commissioned shortly after, for the celebrations of the fortieth anniversary to the German Revolution.Se\u00e1n Allan, John Sandford. DEFA: East German cinema, 1946\u20131992. . Page 80. The script writers Paul Wiens and Karl Georg Egel were instructed to present the 1918 Revolution in accordance with the official Soviet interpretation of history; Walter Ulbricht told that it failed due to the \"opportunistic\" Social Democrats and to the lack of a Marxist\u2013Leninist party that would have led the workers \"in the smashing of the capitalistic economical apparatus.\" The plot places emphasis on the Spartacus League, and culminated in the founding of the Communist Party of Germany.A Der Spiegel article about the filming, 10 September 1958. Principal photography commenced on June 3, 1958. Directors Kurt Maetzig and G\u00fcnter Reisch worked separately; the first's crew was responsible for the scenes involving the officers and the admirals, while the latter filmed those with the sailors and the crowds.The Sailor's Song on PROGRESS' website. The Sailor's Song was the greatest project undertaken by DEFA up to that time, and was larger in scale even than Ernst Th\u00e4lmann. 15,000 workers, soldiers and People's policemen were used as extras during the filming. Since Kiel, the city in which the revolution took place, was located in West Germany, the directors used sets that were constructed in Goerlitz, Warnem\u00fcnde and Rostock. ==Reception== In 1959, Maetzig won East Germany's National Prize, 2nd degree, for his work on the film, as well as a special Peace Prize at the 1st Moscow International Film Festival.The Sailor's Song on film-zeit.de. DEFA Studio's director Albert Wilkening wrote that no picture, except Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, ever touched the people of East Germany as deeply as The Sailor's Song. The SED considered it as one of the country's greatest cinematic achievements, and this view was upheld until the German Reunification.Dagmar Schittly. Zwischen Regie und Regime. Die Filmpolitik der SED im Spiegel der DEFA-Produktionen. . Page 95. Critics Miera and Antonin Liehm claimed that it was a \"made for order\" film that was \"clumsy and heavy- handed\".Miera Liehm, Antonin J. Liehm .
