    "text": "==Route== NCR 9 is a planned cycle route that will eventually connect Belfast to Dublin. The route is currently signposted between the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge in Belfast and Slieve Gullion, just south of Newry.Route 9 | Sustrans ===Belfast to Newry=== Belfast | Lisburn | Portadown | Newry The route begins at the west side of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, where it connects with National cycle routes 93 and 99. It runs south along the River Lagan to the Island Arts Centre in Lisburn. After leaving Lisburn it runs west, roughly following the M1 motorway to Portadown. In Portadown NCR 9 links with National Cycle Route 94. At Portadown the route heads south down the Newry Canal Towpath. Approximately 4.5 km (2.8 miles) down the towpath the route links with National Cycle Route 91 and Regional Route 10. At Scarva station there is a second link with another branch of National Cycle Route 91. From Newry it passes through Camlough to the base of Slieve Gullion. The Belfast to Lisburn section is a slow and winding route along a path that is not suitable for road bikes as the surface is of varying quality made of tarmac or gravel. It does make an ideal cycle for young and old, and since bicycles can be taken on trains running on the adjacent railway line, you can choose the length of your route easily. The easiest route if taking your bicycle by train is going to Newry railway station then cycling to Portadown railway station, therefore avoiding going up a steep hill from Newry city centre to Newry railway station. ===Newry to Dublin=== Newry | Dublin Proposed route only. ==References== ==External links== * Lagan and Lough Cycle Way * Sustrans Lagan and Lough Cycle Way Category:National Cycle Routes Category:Cycleways in Northern Ireland ",
