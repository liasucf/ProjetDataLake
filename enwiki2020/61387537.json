    "text": "On 27 July 2019 a squad of Boko Haram terrorists opened fire on a group of people walking from a funeral in Nganzai District of Borno State, Nigeria. At least 65 people were killed in the attack and 10 injured people were hospitalized. The attack occurred as part of the Boko Haram insurgency. ==Attack== Around 10:30 GMT several Boko Haram extremists riding in motorbikes and vans opened fire on a large group of people returning to the village of Badu Kuluwu from a funeral in Goni Abachari. Angry mourners retaliated against the assault by attempting to chase after the terrorists, but were fired upon by the attacking convoy as it fled. In the aftermath of the attack 65 people were dead: 23 people were killed when the terrorists initially opened fire on the group and another 42 perished from gunfire while attempting to chase the gunmen. ==Response== Nigerian President Muhammad Buhari directed Nigeria's air and army forces to scour the area for the attackers after the attack. Nganzai local government chairman Muhammad Bulama confirmed a death toll of 65 people and 10 injuries in a statement to the media the next day. Bulimia labeled the terrorist attack as a reprisal attack, occurring in response to a civilian self-defense group killing 11 Boko Haram extremists while countering an ambush a week earlier. == References == Category:2019 murders in Nigeria Category:2019 mass shootings in Africa Category:2019 murders in Africa Category:2010s in Borno State Category:2010s massacres in Nigeria Category:Massacres perpetrated by Boko Haram Category:Islamic terrorism in Nigeria Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2019 Category:July 2019 crimes in Africa Category:Mass murder in 2019 Category:Mass murder in Borno State Category:Mass shootings in Nigeria Category:Terrorist incidents in Borno State Category:Terrorist incidents in Nigeria in 2019 ",
