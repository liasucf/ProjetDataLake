    "text": "The National League North, formerly Conference North (named the Vanarama National League North for sponsorship reasons), is a division of the National League in England, taking its place immediately below the top division National League. Along with the National League South, it is at Step 2 of the National League System and the sixth overall tier of the English football league system. It consists of teams located in Northern England, Norfolk and the English Midlands. Since the start of the 2015\u201316 season, the league has been known as the National League North. As part of a sponsorship deal with Vanarama, the National League North was renamed the Vanarama National League North. ==History== The Conference North was introduced in 2004 as part of a major restructuring of English non-League football. The champions are automatically promoted to the National League. A second promotion place goes to the winners of play-offs involving the teams finishing in second to seventh place (expanded from four to six teams in the 2017\u201318 season). The three bottom clubs are relegated to Step 3 leagues. Teams from this division, as well as from the National League South, enter the FA Cup at the Second Qualifying Round. For sponsorship reasons, the division was known as the Nationwide North from its formation in 2004 until 2007, when it was renamed the Blue Square North. In 2010 it was renamed the Blue Square Bet North. When the Blue Square sponsorship ended in 2013, it was renamed the Skrill North until the 2014\u201315 season, when it was renamed the Vanarama North. A further name change followed in 2015, when the division was renamed the Vanarama National League North. The National League North will expand to 24 teams in 2021, when the bottom two clubs will be relegated and four promoted from Step 3 after the 2020\u201321 season. Four will be relegated starting in 2022. ==Member clubs for 2019\u201320== The member clubs for the 2019\u201320 season are as follows: The area covered by National League North is coloured in red.
