During his career, he made twelve appearances in The Football League during spells with Cardiff City and Newport County. ==Career== Ashton began his career with Wrexham following the return of The Football League at the end of World War II. However, he failed to break into the first team and was released in 1948 without making an appearance. He joined Cardiff City in April 1948 and, after impressing for their reserve side, he was handed his professional debut on the final day of the 1947\u201348 season. Replacing Danny Canning in goal, he played in a 2\u20131 defeat to Barnsley. The following season, he remained as backup to Canning's replacement Phil Joslin but struggled to make an impression and was released. He joined non-league side Bath City soon after but returned to the Football League with Newport County in December 1949. He made ten league appearances for Newport before joining Merthyr Tydfil. He briefly returned to Newport the following season, making a single appearance before dropping out of professional football. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Welsh footballers Category:Wrexham A.F.C. players Category:Cardiff City F.C. players Category:Bath City F.C. players Category:Newport County A.F.C. players Category:Merthyr Tydfil F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:People from Llanidloes ",
