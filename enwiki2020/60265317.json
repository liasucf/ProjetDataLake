In the Quarterfinals, teams played a two-game series where the first team to reach 3 points was declared a winner (2 points for winning a game, 1 point each for tying). If both teams ended up with 2 points after the first two games a 20-minute mini- game was played to determine a winner. Mini-game scores are in italics. All other rounds were Single-game elimination. The teams were seeded according to geographic proximity for the eastern quarterfinals so the visiting team would have the shortest feasible distance to travel. for the western quarterfinal, the top-ranked team awaited the winner of a play-in game between the lower- ranked teams. The third place game ceased to be held with this tournament. ==Tournament Bracket== Note: * denotes overtime period(s) Note: Mini-games in italics ==Record by conference== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Conference !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|# of Bids !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Record !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Win % !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Frozen Four !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Championship Game !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Champions |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| NCHA | 2 | 4\u20131\u20132 | | 1 | 1 | 1 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| ECAC East | 2 | 3\u20133\u20130 | | 1 | 1 | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| NESCAC | 1 | 2\u20131\u20130 | | 1 | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| ECAC West | 1 | 0\u20130\u20132 | | - | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| SUNYAC | 1 | 0\u20131\u20132 | | 1 | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| ECAC Northeast | 1 | 0\u20132\u20130 | | - | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| MIAC | 1 | 0\u20131\u20130 | | - | - | - |} ==References== * ==External links== *Division III Men's Ice Hockey Record Book Category:NCAA Division III ice hockey ",
