    "text": "\"Two of Us\" is a 1969 song written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon\u2013McCartney partnership. The song was recorded by the Beatles on 31 January 1969. \"Two of Us\" was originally released as the opening track on Let It Be (1970) and a remix of that recording was later included on Let It Be... Naked (2003). An outtake of the song, recorded on 24 January 1969, was released on Anthology 3 (1996). The song's title was used for the 2000 TV movie Two of Us, which depicts a fictionalized version of a 1976 reunion between McCartney and Lennon. ==History== The song was originally titled \"On Our Way Home\". Ian MacDonald claimed the lyrics (e.g.: \"you and I have memories/longer than the road that stretches out ahead\" or \"you and me chasing paper/getting nowhere\") sounded like McCartney was probably addressing Lennon and contractual troubles. \"You Never Give Me Your Money\", a different composition by McCartney from the previously released album, but recorded after Let It Be, Abbey Road, also refers to The Beatles' contract with Allen Klein as \"funny paper\". An early performance of the song, in a guitar-driven rock style, can be seen in the Let It Be film. Unsatisfied with this style, which McCartney described as \"chunky\", the band reworked the song around acoustic guitars. The Beatles performed a finished version of the song live at Apple Studios on 31 January 1969; this performance was included in both the Let It Be film and album. The clip was also broadcast on The Ed Sullivan Show on 1 March 1970 as the final appearance by the Beatles on the program. In between several takes of the song on 24 January 1969, the band spontaneously started playing a hammed-up version of traditional Liverpudlian song \"Maggie Mae\". The 38-second song would also end up on the Let It Be album, but is omitted in Let It Be... Naked. A version of Two of Us on the same day is released on Anthology 3. In May 1969, McCartney produced a recording of the song using this title by the group Mortimer, a New York City trio that briefly recorded for Apple, but this recording was never released. On the Let It Be album, producer Phil Spector added, as a spoken introduction to the song, a snippet of unrelated studio humour by Lennon, who says: \"'I Dig A Pygmy' by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf-Aids! Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats!\" This intro, with its passing mention of the British comic actor, was removed in the Let It Be... Naked version. ==Personnel== * Paul McCartney \u2013 lead vocal, lead acoustic guitar (Martin D-28) * John Lennon \u2013 co-lead vocal, whistling, rhythm acoustic guitar (Martin D-28) * George Harrison \u2013 bassline on electric guitar (Fender Telecaster) * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums ==Covers== * Boney M. covered the song on their 1979 album Oceans of Fantasy. * Aimee Mann and Michael Penn covered \"Two of Us\" as part of the soundtrack for the 2001 film, I Am Sam.
