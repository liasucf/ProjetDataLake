    "text": "Delacroix Island or Delacroix is an unincorporated community in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, United States. ==History== In the 1780s, Spanish Canary Islanders, or Isle\u00f1os, settled in the area after being given land grants from Spain. After selling their land grants to the planters, the Isle\u00f1os frequently worked on the plantations they helped to create. Some began to resettle in the easternmost reaches of St. Bernard parish around the 1820s resulting in the firm establishment of Delacroix Island fishing community before the Civil War. By the 1900s, Yscloskey, Louisiana and Shell Beach, Louisiana near Lake Borgne were thriving communities. Seafood harvested by these fishermen in the 1800s and 1900s supplied New Orleans restaurants with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of shrimp, fish, crabs, and oysters.www.losislenos.org \"St. Bernard Isle\u00f1os LOUISIANA'S SPANISH TREASURE\" Previously connected to the outside world by boat, in the 1930s a road was constructed to \"the island\" (in reality an inland area surrounded by marsh and bayous). Since the 20th century, Delacroix has been regionally famous for fishing and trapping. Like much of the region, Delacroix was devastated by Hurricane Katrina and its storm surge in 2005. The entire area was flooded, and the majority of buildings completely destroyed. By 2010, much of this fishing town had been reconstructed, with most new construction elevated high on piers. ==Musical references== The community is referred to in the Bob Dylan song \"Tangled Up in Blue\".
