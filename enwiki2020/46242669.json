With an arcady touch, the game's strength is its content and its ease of use, while more experienced players will head over to Codemasters' Dirt Rally\". GameStar agreed, stating that it was a \"challenging rally simulation with Loeb bonus, but inferior to Dirt Rally in all aspects.\" The game reached number 19 in the UK sales charts. ==References== Category:2016 video games Category:Milestone srl games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Rally racing video games Category:Video games developed in Italy Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games set in Finland Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Italy Category:Video games set in Mexico Category:Video games set in Monaco Category:Video games set in Sweden Category:Video games set in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ",
