She currently serves as a federal deputy of the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress representing the XXXIV Federal Electoral District of the State of Mexico. ==Early life and education== Gonz\u00e1lez Calder\u00f3n received her law degree from the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de M\u00e9xico in 1987 and immediately became the Director of Social Promotion in Toluca; after two years, she transitioned into a citizen attention position in Toluca's second district. In 1990, she became an alternate local deputy to the LI Legislature of the Congress of the State of Mexico, while she served as a women's leader and municipal councilor in the local PRI and pursued her master's degree in Political Sociology from the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris. Two years after graduating with her master's in 1993, she received her doctorate degree in the same discipline from the Paris Dauphine University. She went on to teach French and political analysis. ==Career== ===Return to Mexico=== In the late 1990s, Gonz\u00e1lez Calder\u00f3n's Mexican political career resumed. She became a deputy attorney for the Toluca Valley in 1999 and left that position to spend a year as the environmental secretary of the State of Mexico, between 2001 and 2002. A year later, voters sent her to the LV Legislature of the Congress of the State of Mexico, where she presided over the Political Coordination Board and the Commission for the Prosecution and Administration of Justice. During this time, from 2004 to 2007, she served on the board of the State of Mexico Institute of Public Administration, A.C. After her three-year term as a state deputy, Gonz\u00e1lez went to the federal Chamber of Deputies for the LX Legislature of the Mexican Congress, being vice president of its Board of Directors and serving on commissions including Metropolitan Development, National Defense, Environment and Natural Resources, Special on Femicides, and Special on Non-Discrimination. With her first term in San L\u00e1zaro over, Gonz\u00e1lez Calder\u00f3n briefly returned to the state government with a brief stint as the secretary of tourism, a position she left after just one year in order to become the PRI's secretary general in the State of Mexico. In 2012, she was tapped as president of the PRI in Toluca. ===Municipal presidency=== In 2012, voters elected Gonz\u00e1lez Calder\u00f3n from a coalition including the PRI, PVEM and Nueva Alianza to become the new municipal president of Toluca beginning on 1 January 2013; she received just over half the vote. During her tenure, Toluca was awarded by the Mexican Competitiveness Institute for leading the nation in budget transparency in 2014. Social media users criticized her in 2013 for allegedly ordering a culling of stray dogs in the city. ===Back to San L\u00e1zaro=== In January 2015, Gonz\u00e1lez Calder\u00f3n asked for approval to permanently step aside as mayor of Toluca in order to run for federal deputy. She won the seat for the 34th district, one of several including Toluca, and sits on the Competitiveness, Public Education and Educational Services, and Government Commissions. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from the State of Mexico Category:Women members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Mexican lawyers Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Institutional Revolutionary Party politicians Category:Mexican women lawyers Category:Members of the Congress of the State of Mexico Category:Paris Dauphine University alumni Category:21st-century Mexican politicians Category:21st-century Mexican women politicians ",
