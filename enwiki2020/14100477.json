Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y. ==Observations== The floor of Juventae Chasma is partly covered by sand dunes. There is also a 2.5 km high mountain inside Juventae, 59 km long and 23 km wide, that was confirmed by Mars Express to be composed of sulfate deposits.Sulphate deposits in Juventae Chasma MRO discovered sulfates, hydrated sulfates, and iron oxides in Juventae Chasma.Murchie, S. et al. 2009. A synthesis of Martian aqueous mineralogy after 1 Mars year of observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Journal of Geophysical Research: 114. Juventae Chasma has four bright mounds or light-toned interior layered deposits (IlD's), as they are often called. Researchers have found that monohydrated sulfates were first deposited on the floor. And then polyhydrated sulfates were laid down. Kieserite, a magnesium sulfate, was also found in Juventae Chasma.Noel, A., J. Bishop, M. Al-Samir, C. Gross, J. Flahaut, P. McGuire, C. Weitz, F. Seelos, S. Murchie. 2015. Mineralogy, morphology and stratigraphy of the light-toned interior layered deposits at Juventae Chasma. Icarus: 251, 315\u2013331 Studies from satellites orbiting Mars have found channels on the eastern, western, and southern walls of Juventae Chasma. They seem to have different origins. Some may have started from melting snow, others from groundwater sapping, and still others from precipitation. Inverted channels are also present.Singh et al. (2016) Lunar Planet. Sci. XLIV Abstract#1766.Singh, P., et al. 2017. The Diverse Channel Networks of Juventae Chasma, Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017). 2603.pdf. Inverted relief that are visible in Juventae Chasma are also visible in other parts of Mars. This occurs when sediments are deposited on the floor of a stream and then become resistant to erosion, perhaps by cementation. Later the area may be buried. Eventually, erosion removes the covering layer and the former streams become visible since they are resistant to erosion. Mars Global Surveyor found several examples of this process.
