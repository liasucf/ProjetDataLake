Lu lived in the house from 1933 to his death in 1936. ==History== Lu settled in Shanghai in October 1927. Lu first lived in a house at 23 Jingyunli (), on Donghengbin Road, Hongkou District. He then moved to Room 2093 of the Beichuan Apartments (, formerly known as the Ramous Apartments) on North Sichuan Road. He moved the rented house at 9 Continental Terrace on April 11, 1933. In Shanghai, he published a nine essay collection and a short stories collection called Old Tales Retold (), and co-founded the League of Left-Wing Writers in 1930 at the Chinese Arts University on nearby Duolun Road. He translated and edited foreign works as well. Lu died in his bed on October 19, 1936, aged 55. The house was opened as a museum to the public in January 1950. It has been listed as a Protected Historical and Cultural Site of Shanghai () since 1977. ==Layout and nearby== The three-story building was constructed using red brick and tiles. It covers an area of 78 m2 and has a floor space of 222.72 m2. The first floor is divided into a reception room and a dining room, with the front door facing south. Lu's bedroom and study are located on the second floor. Most of his furniture is still placed as in his day. On a bedroom table is a clock that reads 5.25 am, the exact time of his death; his son occupied the third floor. In proximity to the house are numerous other attractions dedicated to Lu Xun. These include a monument, a Memorial Hall, a park renamed in his honor, as well as his tomb. ==See also== * Beijing Lu Xun Museum * Duolun Road ==References== * Category:Museums in Shanghai Category:Historic house museums in China Category:Biographical museums in China Category:Hongkou District Category:Houses completed in 1931 Category:1931 establishments in China Category:Lu Xun ",
