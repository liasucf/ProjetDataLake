Her mother was Maria Brower Ahgeak and her father was Joseph A. Ahgeak, who was a hunter. She grew up bilingual in I\u00f1upiaq and English. Growing up in Barrow, she attended Barrow Day School, where she said a third grade teacher would \"physically throw children across the room\" for speaking their I\u00f1upiaq language.Crozier-Hogle, Lois, Wilson, Daryl Babe, & Jensen, Ferne.
