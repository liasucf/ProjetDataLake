CKX-FM operates at 96.1 FM, broadcasting an adult hits format under the brand name 96.1 Bob FM. ==History== The station started operation in 1963 as a sister station to CKX AM. The station, with a power of 29,000 watts, was the first stereo FM station in Manitoba. In 1983, the station adopted the \"KX 96\" and mainstream rock format, making 2008 their 25th year on air. As a mainstream rock radio station, KX96 focused most of its airtime on classic rock or familiar music and features a somewhat limited collection of current rock tracks. In 1991, Western Manitoba Broadcasters, who formerly owned CKX-FM, CKX AM and CKX-TV, changed its name to Craig Broadcast Systems Inc. Craig's radio operations in Brandon were sold to Standard Radio in 2002, along with two other Craig Media properties. Ownership changed hands once again when on October 29, 2007, Astral Media took over all stations operating under Standard Broadcasting. It is now owned by Bell Media after Astral merged with the company in 2013. On August 30, 2013, CKX-FM switched its format to adult hits and re-branded as 96.1 Bob FM. ==External links== * * * KX KX KX Category:Bob FM stations Category:Radio stations established in 1963 Category:1963 establishments in Manitoba ",
