According to the Egyptian army spokesperson Tamer el-Rifa'i, the army besieged groups of terrorists and foiled attacks that targeted a number of other checkpoints in the Rafah area in North Sinai. The ambush got encircled by 13 armed vehicles carrying 100 takfiris (terrorists who claim others are unbelievers). The outcome of the battle that lasted for hours was the killing of 40 takfiris and the destruction of six vehicles. Yet, 13 officers and soldiers at the ambush martyred, including Colonel Mansi. == Life == He was born in 1978 in Minya al- Qamh district in al-Sharqiyya governorate. He joined the Sa'ka Forces in the Nineties, immediately after his graduation from the Egyptian Military Academy in 1998. He had served for a long time in the Special Forces Task Force Unit 999, which is the most powerful unit in Egypt's Thunderbolt Forces. In 2001, he joined the first expeditionary special forces SEAL team and then traveled to the United States of America for training in 2006. Mansi obtained a master's degree in military science from the Command and Staff College, and he took over as commander of the 103rd Sa'ka (Thunderbolt) Forces Battalion in Sinai after the martyrdom of the battalion's former commander, Colonel Rami Hasanein, in October 2016. In 2016, he was awarded by the battalion during the month of Ramadan for his excellent performance and his military discipline. == TV series == Actor Amir Karara played the biography of Colonel Ahmed el-Mansy in TV series titled \"The Choice\", which premiered in Ramadan 2020. The series has been a success in the Egyptian and Arab street, since its introduction at the beginning of the month of Ramadan 2020, and its events revolve around the martyrdom of the hero of the Egyptian armed forces, Colonel Ahmed al-Mansi. The events also cover the life of the terrorist Hesham Ashmawy, an infamous former fellow officer who masterminded several terror attacks in Egypt before and after his escape to Libya, where he was eventually captured, returned to Egypt and sentenced to death. == Death and funeral == Actor Mohamed Ramadan attended his funeral, he said that it was a funeral of a hero who knows the real meaning of being an Egyptian. He said that he met Colonel Mansy twice during his enlistment in the Egyptian armed forces. == Honour == President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi inaugurated a floating bridge called \"Martyr Ahmed el- Mansi\" connecting the Eastern and Western shores of the Suez Canal in Zone 6 in the Ismailia Governorate, achieving integration with ferries and undersea tunnels. el-Sisi also drew a comparison between Colonel Ahmed el-Mansy and Hesham Ashmawi, and said there is a huge difference between Mansy and Ashmawy, stressing that both were officers of the same Army Special Forces unit, but one of them chose to betray the country, while the other remained loyal. == See also == * Rafah terror attack * Sinai terror attacks * Hesham Ashmawy * 2017 Sinai mosque attack * Comprehensive Operation \u2013 Sinai 2018 * Refuting ISIS * Defeating ISIS == References == == External links == * Remembering 103 battalion\u2019s brave battle against IS in Sinai \u2014 Daily News Egypt * The last words of Ahmed Al-Mansi recorded in a WhatsApp message \u2014 Al Arabiya * El-Sisi opens martyr Ahmed Elmansy floating bridge * Al-Sisi first comment on Hesham Ashmawy\u2019s arrest Category:Egyptian colonels Category:Egyptian military leaders Category:Egyptian military officers Category:Egyptian Military Academy alumni Category:Egyptian Sunni Muslims Category:People from Sharqia Governorate Category:People in counter-terrorism Category:1978 births Category:2017 deaths ",
