    "text": "Berkatlah Yang DiPertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan is the state anthem of Negeri Sembilan. It was composed by Andrew Caldecott (1884-1951) with lyrics by Tunku Zakaria Mambang, and it was used by Tuanku Muhammad, who was the ruler at that time. The anthem was subject to the fine-tuning efforts of the second son of the current Yang DiPertuan Besar, Tunku Zain Al-'Abidin ibni Tuanku Muhriz. The rearranged composition, recorded with the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra and choir groups from several schools across the state, was first presented to the public on the installation ceremonies of Tuanku Muhriz and his wife Tuanku Aishah Rohani in early 2009, and it was officially launched on 27 October 2010. The line \"Musuhnya habis binasa\" from the anthem serves as motto for the state's football team, Negeri Sembilan FA. ==Lyrics== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Berkatlah Yang Di-Pertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan |- !Malay !English |- | :Berkatlah Yang Di-Pertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan, Kurniai sihat dan makmur, Kasihi rakyat, lanjutkan umur!
