    "text": "Beware the Heavens is the first album by the power metal band Sinergy, released in 1999. The album features two instrumental tracks \"Born Unto Fire and Passion\" and \"Pulsation\", and a track inspired by the series Xena: The Warrior Princess, entitled \"The Warrior Princess\". Some melodies that can be heard in the song \"Beware the Heavens\" were sampled from a song called \"Translucent image\" by IneartheD (now known as Children of Bodom); the song is featured on IneartheD's 1995 demo Ubiquitous Absence Of Remission. This is the only album where Jesper Str\u00f6mblad (In Flames guitarist) plays guitar alongside Alexi Laiho; his position was filled in by Roope Latvala on all subsequent albums. ==Track listing== # \"Venomous Vixens\" \u2013 3:15 # \"The Fourth World\" \u2013 4:23 # \"Born Unto Fire and Passion\" \u2013 1:46 # \"The Warrior Princess\" \u2013 4:51 # \"Beware the Heavens\" \u2013 3:54 # \"Razorblade Salvation\" \u2013 4:57 # \"Swarmed\" \u2013 5:25 # \"Pulsation\" \u2013 1:45 # \"Virtual Future\" \u2013 4:08 # \"Beware the Heavens\" Demo Version (Japan bonus track) \u2013 3:51 ===Bonus tracks on Deluxe Edition=== # \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" (Scorpions cover) # \"The Number of the Beast\" (Iron Maiden cover) # \"Gimme Gimme Gimme\" (ABBA cover) ==Credits== ===Sinergy=== *Kimberly Goss \u2013 vocals, keyboards *Alexi Laiho \u2013 guitar, additional vocals (Track 2) *Jesper Str\u00f6mblad \u2013 guitar *Sharlee D'Angelo \u2013 bass guitar *Ronny Milianowicz \u2013 drums ===Other personnel=== *Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m \u2013 Production, Engineering, Mixing *G\u00f6ran Finnberg \u2013 Mastering ==References== Category:1999 debut albums Category:Sinergy albums Category:Nuclear Blast albums Category:Albums produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m ",
