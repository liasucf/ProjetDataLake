It was given its current name following the ethnic cleansing of Armenians from the region during the Armenian Genocide. The village still contains the ruins of the church of St Anania as well as many khatchkars; carved memorial stones. The village is notable for the good condition of its many khatchkar stones, which have been remarked on by the Telegraph, and appeared in the documentary 100 Years Later. They have been described as \"the most important collection of Armenian khatchkars now surviving in Turkey.\" The church of St Anania dates from the 6th or 7th century and is used by the current population of the village as a barn. Half a mile east of the village are the remains of the monastery of Sourp Hovannes. This monastery is on private property and has suffered extensive damage by treasure hunters inspired by stories of buried gold. As of 2018, the population of the village is 1062. ==References== Category:Armenian buildings in Turkey Category:Armenian Genocide Category:Western Armenia Category:Bitlis Province ",
