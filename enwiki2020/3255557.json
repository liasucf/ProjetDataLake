It is in the southwest part of the city, on a large block south of Wood Street and east of Morris Avenue. The park features a pavilion, an artificial lake, a zoo, softball fields, two war memorials, and a preserved steam locomotive, its tender (rail) and a caboose from the Nickel Plate Road which formerly served the area. The park also includes a mini golf course, sand volleyball courts and a playground. During the warm weather of summer an outdoor theater provides productions for local people. On July 4 the park hosts a fireworks display which is launched over the lake. ==Monkey Island== Miller Park was also once home to what the locals called \"Monkey Island\" during the 1960s. In the middle of man-made Miller Park Lake, there stood a platform with the metal dome that once belonged to McLean County Courthouse, on which they had a live monkey exhibit, designed by Grover Kathoffer. Though the exhibit has long been gone, many of the local residents remember the \"Monkey Island\" that once was. ==See also== * List of historical sites related to the Illinois labor movement#Railroad Workers' Monument -- description of the railroad monument and train ==References== ==External links== *Zoo website *Voters backed establishment of Miller Park in 1887 - Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois newspaper) * Miller Park Collection, McLean County Museum of History Category:Bloomington, Illinois Category:Parks in Illinois Category:Protected areas of McLean County, Illinois Category:Tourist attractions in Bloomington\u2013Normal ",
