    "text": "The Art of War is the fourth album by Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton. The album is based on the ancient Chinese military treatise, The Art of War written by General Sun Tzu in the 6th Century BC. It consists of 13 chapters, each of which describe a different aspect of warfare, and is considered the definitive work on military tactics and strategies of its time. The tracks on the album correspond to each chapter of treatise. The lyrics of the songs are about famous battles or war, mostly based on the battles of the First and Second World Wars where Sun Tzu's tactics were applied. ==Production== The Swedish national anthem from Sweden Rock '09 (found on the Re-Armed edition) was the only song on which bassist P\u00e4r Sundstr\u00f6m has contributed vocals until 2012, when the line-up change required Sundstr\u00f6m to step up to the microphone on a more permanent basis. Spoken quotes from Sun Tzu's The Art of War can be heard in songs such as \"Sun Tzu Says\", \"The Art of War\", \"Unbreakable\", \"The Nature of Warfare\", \"Cliffs of Gallipoli\", \"Union (Slopes of St. Benedict)\", \"The Price of a Mile\", \"Firestorm\" and \"A Secret\". These quotes are taken from LibriVox's audiobook version of the book, which follows the Lionel Giles translation. ==Track listing== ==Different versions== The Art of War was released in three different versions, a standard edition containing only the CD, a vinyl version and a Limited Edition. The limited contains the full- length CD and the book The Art of War by Sun Tzu. The limited edition comes in a DVD case with alternate artwork. All preorders from the official Sabaton homepage also included the single, Cliffs of Gallipoli. == Personnel == * Joakim Brod\u00e9n \u2013 vocals * Rickard Sund\u00e9n \u2013 guitars * Oskar Montelius \u2013 guitars * P\u00e4r Sundstr\u00f6m \u2013 bass * Daniel Mullback \u2013 drums * Daniel M\u00ffhr \u2013 keyboards == In popular culture== \"40:1\" became a hit in Poland and Sabaton was asked to perform it on the Polish Independence Day celebration in Gda\u0144sk in 2008. \"40:1\" is also used as an entrance song by Polish mixed martial artist Damian Grabowski. The title track was featured in the Sabaton Soundtrack DLC for the grand strategy game Europa Universalis IV. ==References== Category:2008 albums Category:Sabaton (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Peter T\u00e4gtgren ",
