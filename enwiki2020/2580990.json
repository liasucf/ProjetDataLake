It is located 26 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. ==Location== Oyster Bay is a natural feature on the southern bank of the Georges River. Green Point and Caravan Head are localities within the suburb of Oyster Bay. Green Point is home to the Green Point Observatory, home of the Sutherland Astronomical Society. Coronation Bay is also located on the Georges River between Green Point and Caravan Head. At Coronation Bay there is a large mangrove area that creates a diverse and dynamic eco-system, which supports a variety of bird-life. Carina Bay is located on the western boundary of the suburb.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 195 ==History== Oyster Bay takes its name from the abundance of oysters that were found in the bay. The name had appeared on maps prepared by Surveyor Wells in 1840. Oyster Bay was part of the Thomas Holt Estate of 12,000 acres purchased in 1861 by Thomas Holt (1811-1888), pastoralist and at one time, Colonial Treasurer of New South Wales. His estate covered most of present-day Sutherland Shire. Parish maps dating from 1880 show Scylla and Carina Roads clearly dissecting the area known as Oyster Bay. These were boundary lines between the individual Holt acreages. The Parish Map of 1913 shows a subdivision, called \u201cBy the Water Estate\u201d, with an early alignment of Caravan Head, Como and Oyster Bay Roads. The first house, situated at 19 Como Road was built in 1910. It belonged to Samuel and Eliza Hall. A general store was opened in 1925. The 1925 Parish Map has \u201cThe Village of Oyster Bay\u201d written on it. The suburb's name was officially recognised in 1933. Oyster Bay Public School was opened in 1945. Oyster Bay developed after this with post World War II migration creating a need for the release of land for housing. A feature of Oyster Bay is that steps and pathways, which were built during the 1930s, provide pedestrian access from the highest part of the suburb to the shops beside the bay. Steps and a pathway also lead from Green Point to Como, giving access to the old Como railway station and to Como Public School (est. 1921). ==Commercial area== A small group of shops is located at the intersection of Como Road and Oyster Bay Road, almost at sea level. It includes a post office, chemist, a liquor-stop, a corner store, a coffee store/restaurant, a newsagency and a bakery.

There is also a Community Hall. ==School== Oyster Bay Public School holds it annual Arts and Craft festival every year in the last weekend of May. The year 2010 was the 40th anniversary of the festival and takes place annually. Oyster Bay Public School is split between two locations on Phillip Street: primary students (Years 3-6) and the infants department (K-2), 300 metres up the road. There are two pre-schools in Oyster Bay.
