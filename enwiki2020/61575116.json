    "text": "Punk is the upcoming second studio album by American rapper Young Thug. It is scheduled to be released in 2020. It is the follow-up to his debut studio album, So Much Fun, which was released in August 2019. ==Release== In an interview about recording his debut album So Much Fun, Young Thug told The Fader that he wanted to release a follow-up album in the \"upcoming weeks\". In contrast to his debut which he described as a \"lighthearted work\", Punk would be more personal and introspective. He said that, in context of the album, he wants to \"open up\" and let people know he is not just a rapper but a human being. He implied the new album as \"touching\" and interpreted the meaning of Punk as \"brave, not self centered, conscious, very, very neglected, very misunderstood, very patient, very authentic\". The album is said to reflect \"real rap\". ==References== Category:2020 albums Category:Young Thug albums Category:Upcoming albums ",
