The state of its flattened skull led some researchers to hypothesize that during the day it roosts in small, constricted spaces. ==Range and habitat== It was first documented in Myanmar in 2004, but its range was quickly expanded to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand after documentation in 2006. ==Conservation== It is currently assessed as least concern by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority. It meets the criteria for this assessment because it has a large range, no major threats to this species have been identified, and it is not likely to be declining quickly. ==References== ==External links== *An image of this species Category:Mammals described in 2004 Category:Bats of Southeast Asia Category:Kerivoulinae ",
