    "text": "The Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Shiwandashan was a counter-guerrilla / counterinsurgency campaign the communists fought against the Kuomintang guerrilla left behind after the nationalist regime withdrew from mainland China. The campaign was fought during the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era in the region of Shiwandashan (\u5341\u4e07\u5927\u5c71, literally meaning Ten Thousand Great Mountains) in Guangxi at the China-Vietnam border and resulted in communist victory. This campaign is part of Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Guangxi, which in turn, was part of Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Central and Southern China. ==Order of battle== Nationalist: *Anticommunist National Salvation Army at the Border Region of Guangdong and Guangxi Communist: *A regiment of the Longzhou Military Sub-District *129th Division *134th Division ==Battles== After the nationalist retreat, the nationalist troops left behind joined the local bandits in the region of Shiwandashan (\u5341\u4e07\u5927\u5c71) under order to continue the fight against their common communist enemy in the form of guerrilla / insurgency warfare. In early December 1950, communist force consisted of a regiment of the communist Longzhou Military Sub-District, the communist 129th Division and the communist 134th Division were tasked to eradicate the nationalists in the region. The original communist plan of attacking on December 20, 1950 was forced to be carried out early on December 13, 1950 when the intelligence revealed that the nationalists planned to withdrew to Vietnam. After three days of travel, the communists succeeded in besieging the nationalist within the Chinese border. The nationalists attempt a futile breakout by sending out a small force to sneak out of the encirclement and cross the border, but the entire 80 member strong force was annihilated by the communist regiment of the Longzhou Military Sub-District in the region to the north of Jiute (\u4e5d\u7279). The remaining nationalists attempted to flee eastward, but they were annihilated by the enemy at the Taiping (\u592a\u5e73) Mountain region. The battles afterward became eradication operations on small scales. By February 1951, the communist victory was complete. ==Conclusion== By February 1951, the campaign concluded with communist victory, with nationalist commanders either killed or captured, including Wei Xiuying (\u97e6\u79c0\u82f1), the commander-in-chief of the nationalist Anticommunist National Salvation Army at the Border Region of Guangdong and Guangxi, and Wei Yuzhuang (\u97e6\u96e8\u5e84), the director of the nationalist Anticommunist National Salvation Committee. The 31,000 strong nationalist guerrilla in Shiwandashan (\u5341\u4e07\u5927\u5c71) was completely annihilated. In addition, the communists also captured 58 pieces of artillery, 33 machine guns, 39,844 firearms, and 3 radio sets. ==See also== *List of battles of the Chinese Civil War *National Revolutionary Army *History of the People's Liberation Army *Chinese Civil War ==References== *Zhu, Zongzhen and Wang, Chaoguang, Liberation War History, 1st Edition, Social Scientific Literary Publishing House in Beijing, 2000, (set) *Zhang, Ping, History of the Liberation War, 1st Edition, Chinese Youth Publishing House in Beijing, 1987, (pbk.) *Jie, Lifu, Records of the Libration War: The Decisive Battle of Two Kinds of Fates, 1st Edition, Hebei People's Publishing House in Shijiazhuang, 1990, (set) *Literary and Historical Research Committee of the Anhui Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Liberation War, 1st Edition, Anhui People's Publishing House in Hefei, 1987, *Li, Zuomin, Heroic Division and Iron Horse: Records of the Liberation War, 1st Edition, Chinese Communist Party History Publishing House in Beijing, 2004, *Wang, Xingsheng, and Zhang, Jingshan, Chinese Liberation War, 1st Edition, People's Liberation Army Literature and Art Publishing House in Beijing, 2001, (set) *Huang, Youlan, History of the Chinese People's Liberation War, 1st Edition, Archives Publishing House in Beijing, 1992, *Liu Wusheng, From Yan'an to Beijing: A Collection of Military Records and Research Publications of Important Campaigns in the Liberation War, 1st Edition, Central Literary Publishing House in Beijing, 1993, *Tang, Yilu and Bi, Jianzhong, History of Chinese People's Liberation Army in Chinese Liberation War, 1st Edition, Military Scientific Publishing House in Beijing, 1993 - 1997, (Volum 1), 7800219615 (Volum 2), 7800219631 (Volum 3), 7801370937 (Volum 4), and 7801370953 (Volum 5) Category:Conflicts in 1950 Category:Conflicts in 1951 Shiwandashan Category:1950 in China Category:1951 in China Category:History of Fujian ",
