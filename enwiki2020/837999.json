    "text": "Felt were an English indie pop band, formed in 1979 in Water Orton, Warwickshire, and led by the mononymous Lawrence. They were active for ten years through the 1980s, releasing ten singles and ten albums. The band's name was inspired by Tom Verlaine's emphasis of the word \"felt\" in the Television song \"Venus\". Felt have been cited as an influence by Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch and Tim Burgess of The Charlatans, as well as by alternative rock bands Manic Street Preachers, Girls, and The Tyde. == Formation == Lawrence founded the band in 1979 with the release of the single \"Index\", a self-published solo recording. A noisy effort unlike Felt's subsequent records, it was later awarded single of the week by Dave McCullough in music newspaper Sounds. With Lawrence initially on vocals and guitar, they formed properly in 1980 with the addition of schoolfriend Nick Gilbert on drums and local guitarist Maurice Deebank. Becoming co-writer with Lawrence, Deebank's jangly, classical-influenced style of playing would provide the band's signature sound in its early years. The band performed as a trio before deciding that bass guitar was needed. Gilbert switched to bass and drummer Tony Race was added. He was replaced soon after by Gary Ainge who would remain the only constant member besides Lawrence throughout the rest of Felt's existence, as well as the only member to play on all ten of their albums. ==Signing== Felt signed to Cherry Red Records and their first single as a band, \"Something Sends Me to Sleep\", was released in 1981. Their first album, Crumbling the Antiseptic Beauty, followed the next year. Gilbert left and was replaced on bass by Mick Lloyd. The band's lineup would then remain unchanged through their next two albums, The Splendour of Fear and The Strange Idols Pattern and Other Short Stories. In 1982, the Felt song \"My Face Is on Fire\" appeared on the bestselling Pillows & Prayers compilation. In 1985, for the recording of their fourth album, keyboard player Martin Duffy was added and Marco Thomas became bassist. Ignite the Seven Cannons was produced by Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins and featured Elizabeth Fraser on the single \"Primitive Painters\". The song reached the top of the UK independent singles chart. Deebank departed soon after, prompting a shift in Felt's sound with Duffy's keyboards becoming more central. The lead guitar position would subsequently be filled by an ever-changing succession of players. The band moved to Creation Records in 1986 and released Let the Snakes Crinkle Their Heads to Death, the first of two instrumental albums they would record. Their next album, Forever Breathes the Lonely Word, was a conventional collection of songs that gained the band praise and would become regarded by many as their best. ==Break up and later== In 1989, Lawrence declared it had been his intention all along to release ten singles and ten albums in ten years and, having done so, announced the end of Felt. After releasing their last album, Me and a Monkey on the Moon, and undertaking a short tour, the band split up. Lawrence went on to form Denim and later, Go Kart Mozart. Duffy joined Primal Scream. Ainge would later play with Vic Godard. Mick Lloyd died in 2016. Subsequent bass player Mick Bund died in 2017. In 2018, Cherry Red reissued all ten Felt albums on CD and vinyl, with new mixes of songs plus revised tracklistings and packaging. ==Members== *Lawrence - vocals and guitar (1979\u20131989) *Maurice Deebank - guitar (1980\u20131985) *Nick Gilbert - bass and drums (1980\u20131981) *Tony Race - drums (1980\u20131981) *Gary Ainge - drums and percussion (1981\u20131989) *Martin Duffy - keyboards (1985\u20131989) *Mick Lloyd - bass (1982\u20131984; died 2016) *Marco Thomas - guitar and bass (1985\u20131987) *Mick Bund - bass (1988; died 2017) ;Timeline ImageSize = width:990 height:300 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1979 till:12/31/1989 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:RGuitar value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitar id:LGuitar value:teal legend:Lead_guitar id:Keyboards value:purple legend:Keyboards id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:bar value:black legend:Studio_albums Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:1 start:01/01/1979 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/1979 LineData = at:02/01/1982 color:black layer:back at:02/01/1984 at:10/26/1984 at:09/20/1985 at:06/01/1986 at:09/01/1986 at:06/01/1987 at:03/01/1988 at:07/01/1988 at:11/13/1989 BarData = bar:Lawrence text:\"Lawrence\" bar:Deebank text:\"Maurice Deebank\" bar:Lloyd text:\"Mick Lloyd\" bar:Thomas text:\"Marco Thomas\" bar:Bund text:\"Mick Bund\" bar:Gilbert text:\"Nick Gilbert\" bar:Race text:\"Tony Race\" bar:Ainge text:\"Gary Ainge\" bar:Duffy text:\"Martin Duffy\" PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Lawrence from:start till:01/01/1986 color:RGuitar bar:Lawrence from:01/01/1986 till:06/01/1987 color:LGuitar bar:Lawrence from:06/01/1987 till:end color:RGuitar bar:Lawrence from:start till:end color:Vocals width:3 bar:Deebank from:01/01/1980 till:01/01/1986 color:LGuitar bar:Gilbert from:01/01/1980 till:08/01/1980 color:Drums bar:Gilbert from:08/01/1980 till:01/01/1982 color:Bass bar:Race from:08/01/1980 till:01/01/1981 color:Drums bar:Ainge from:01/01/1981 till:end color:Drums bar:Lloyd from:01/01/1982 till:01/01/1985 color:bass bar:Thomas from:01/01/1985 till:06/01/1987 color:bass bar:Thomas from:06/01/1987 till:03/01/1988 color:LGuitar bar:Bund from:06/01/1987 till:03/01/1988 color:bass bar:Duffy from:01/01/1985 till:end color:Keyboards ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Crumbling the Antiseptic Beauty (1982), Cherry Red *The Splendour of Fear (1984), Cherry Red *The Strange Idols Pattern and Other Short Stories (1984), Cherry Red *Ignite the Seven Cannons (1985), Cherry Red *Let the Snakes Crinkle Their Heads to Death (1986), Creation \u2013 retitled The Seventeenth Century for the 2018 reissue *Forever Breathes the Lonely Word (1986), Creation *Poem of the River (1987), Creation *The Pictorial Jackson Review (1988), Creation *Train Above the City (1988), Creation *Me and a Monkey on the Moon (1989), \u00e9l ===Compilations=== *Gold Mine Trash (1987), Cherry Red *Bubblegum Perfume (1990), Creation *Absolute Classic Masterpieces (1992), Cherry Red *Absolute Classic Masterpieces Volume II (1993), Creation *Stains on a Decade (2003), Cherry Red ===Singles=== *\"Index\" (September 1979), Shanghai Records \u2013 independent release by Lawrence under the Felt name *\"Something Sends Me to Sleep\" (July 1981), Cherry Red *\"My Face Is on Fire\" (September 1982), Cherry Red *\"Penelope Tree\" (June 1983), Cherry Red *\"Mexican Bandits\" (March 1984), Cherry Red *\"Sunlight Bathed the Golden Glow\" (July 1984), Cherry Red *\"Primitive Painters\" (August 1985), Cherry Red *\"Ballad of the Band\" (May 1986), Creation *\"Rain of Crystal Spires\" (September 1986), Creation *\"The Final Resting of the Ark\" (September 1987), Creation *\"Space Blues\" (August 1988), Creation ===Videos=== *A Declaration (DVD, 2003), Cherry Red \u2013 live in concert, ULU, February 1987 ==References== == Further reading == * * * ==External links== *\"Felt\" - article at Perfect Sound Forever *\"Felt Biography\" at TweeNet *Felt Discography *Felt Discography - featuring detailed pictures *Felt Reviews Category:Cherry Red Records artists Category:Creation Records artists Category:English alternative rock groups Category:English new wave musical groups Category:Music in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:British indie pop groups Category:English post-punk music groups Category:Dream pop musical groups Category:Musical groups from Birmingham, West Midlands ",
