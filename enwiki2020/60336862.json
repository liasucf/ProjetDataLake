    "text": "Bryan J. Traynor is a neurologist and a senior investigator at the National Institute on Aging, and an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Traynor studies the genetics of human neurological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). He led the international consortium that identified pathogenic repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene as a common cause of ALS and FTD. Dr. Traynor also led efforts that identified other Mendelian genes responsible for familial ALS and dementia, including VCP, MATR3, and KIF5A. Dr. Traynor is co-recipient of the 2016 Potamkin Prize for Research in Pick's, Alzheimer's, and Related Diseases for the discovery of the C9orf72 repeat expansions, and the 2013 Sheila Essay Award for his contributions to our understanding of ALS. He also received the NIH Director\u2019s Award in 2012. Dr. Traynor has published more than 200 papers in the field of neurology and genetics, and he is an inventor on three patents. == Education == Dr. Traynor received his medical degree (MB, BCh, BAO, 1993), his Medical Doctorate (MD, 2000), and his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD, 2012) from University College Dublin. He also received his Master of Medical Science (MMSc) from Harvard-MIT HST in 2004. He completed his neurology residency and fellowship at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. == Awards, prizes, and honors == * 2011 National Institute on Aging Director's Award * 2012 Derek Denny-Brown Award * 2012 Elected fellow of the American Neurological Association * 2012 National Institutes of Health Director's Award * 2013 Diamond Award * 2013 Sheila Essey Award * 2016 Potamkin Prize * 2020 Elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland == Notable professional service == * National Institutes of Health Genetics of Health and Disease Study Section * Chairman, Congressionally Mandated Department of Defense ALS Research Program * Editorial board member, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry; Neurobiology of Aging; JAMA Neurology == References == Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Harvard Medical School alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty Category:National Institutes of Health ",
