    "text": "1984 (stylized as MCMLXXXIV) is the sixth studio album by American hard rock band Van Halen, released on January 9, 1984. It was the last Van Halen album until A Different Kind of Truth (2012) to feature lead singer David Lee Roth, who left in 1985 following creative differences. This is the final full-length album to feature all four original members (Van Halen brothers, Roth, and Michael Anthony). Roth would return in 2007, but Eddie's son Wolfgang would replace Anthony in 2006. 1984 and Van Halen's debut are Van Halen's bestselling albums, each having sold more than 10 million copies. 1984 was well received by music critics. Rolling Stone ranked the album number 81 on its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s. It reached number two on the Billboard 200 album chart and remained there for five weeks, behind Michael Jackson's Thriller, on which guitarist Eddie Van Halen made a guest performance. 1984 produced four singles, including \"Jump\", Van Halen's only number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100; the top-20 hits \"Panama\" and \"I'll Wait\"; and the MTV favorite \"Hot for Teacher\". The album was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1999, signifying ten million shipped copies. ==Recording== Following the group's 1982 album, Diver Down, guitarist Eddie Van Halen was dissatisfied by the concessions he had made to Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth and producer Ted Templeman. Both discouraged Eddie from making keyboards a prominent instrument in the band's music. By 1983, Eddie was in the process of building his own studio, naming it 5150 after the California law code for the temporary, involuntary psychiatric commitment of individuals (who present a danger to themselves or others due to signs of mental illness,) with Donn Landee, the band's longtime engineer (and later, producer on the 5150 and OU812 recordings). While boards and tape machines were being installed, Eddie began working on synthesizers to pass the time. \"There were no presets,\" said Templeman. \"He would just twist off until it sounded right.\" There, he composed Van Halen's follow-up to Diver Down without as much perceived \"interference\" from Roth or Templeman. The result was a compromise between the two creative factions in the band: a mixture of keyboard-heavy songs, and the intense rock for which the band was known. In Rolling Stone's retrospective review of 1984 in its '100 Best Albums of the Eighties' list, producer Ted Templeman said, \"It's real obvious to me [why 1984 won Van Halen a broader and larger audience]. Eddie Van Halen discovered the synthesizer.\" ==Songwriting credits== The album's original release credits all songs to Edward Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, Michael Anthony, and David Lee Roth. The UK single release for \"I'll Wait\"Catalog #W9213 credited Michael McDonald as a co-writer, but he was not credited on the US version.Catalog #7-29307 The ASCAP entry for \"I'll Wait\" lists Michael McDonald as co-writer with Roth and the Van Halens. Like many bands starting out on their career, Van Halen shared songwriting credit equally between all members (including guitar instrumentals), but subsequent claims would lend credibility to the view that all songs were entirely or predominantly written by Eddie Van Halen and David Lee Roth, with little input from Van Halen's rhythm section. After the release of Best Of \u2013 Volume I (1996), Van Halen renegotiated their royalties with their label Warner Bros. In 2004, Roth discovered that the rest of the band had renegotiated a royalty rate five times greater than his for releases made during his time as lead singer.Halbert, James. \"The Gripes of Roth \". Classic Rock. April 13, 2004. This was later rectified. Songs from 1984 that appear on compilations after the royalty renegotiation and Roth's lawsuit were credited to Edward Van Halen, Alex Van Halen and David Lee Roth, with Michael Anthony's name removed from the credits, as evident in the end song credits of the 2007 film Superbad. ==Artwork== The cover art was created by graphic artist Margo Nahas. It was not specifically commissioned; Nahas had been asked to create a cover that featured four chrome women dancing, but declined due to the creative difficulties. Her husband brought her portfolio to the band anyway, and from that material they chose the painting of a putto stealing cigarettes that was used. The model was Carter Helm, who was the child of one of Nahas' best friends, whom she photographed holding a candy cigarette. The front cover was censored in the UK at the time of the album's release. It featured a sticker that obscured the cigarette in the putto's hand and the pack of cigarettes. The back cover features all four band members individually with 1984 in a green futuristic font. ==Songs== The album's first two singles, \"Jump\" and \"I'll Wait\", feature prominent synthesizers, as does the album's intro track, \"1984\", a one-minute instrumental. Eddie Van Halen played an Oberheim OB-Xa synthesizer on the album. 1984 saw the release of the album's third single \"Panama\", which features a heavy guitar riff reminiscent of Van Halen's earlier work. The engine noise was from Eddie revving up his Lamborghini, with microphones used near the tailpipes. Later, a video of \"Hot for Teacher\" was released and played regularly on MTV, giving the band a fourth hit which sustained sales of the album. Other songs on 1984 included \"Girl Gone Bad\", parts of which previously had been played during the 1982 Tour amidst performances of \"Somebody Get Me a Doctor\" (most famously at the US Festival show), the hard rock \"Drop Dead Legs\" and \"Top Jimmy\", a tribute to James Paul Koncek of the band Top Jimmy & The Rhythm Pigs. The album concludes with \"House of Pain\", a fiery, heavy metal song that dates back to the band's early club days of the mid-1970s. Eddie told an interviewer that \"Girl Gone Bad\" was written in a hotel room that he and then-wife Valerie Bertinelli had rented. Valerie was asleep, and Eddie woke up during the night with an idea he had to put on tape. Not wanting to wake Valerie, Eddie grabbed a cassette recorder and recorded himself playing guitar in the closet. Eddie Van Halen stated he wrote the arrangement for \"Jump\" several years before 1984 was recorded. In a 1995 cover story in Rolling Stone, the guitarist said Roth had rejected the synth riff for \"Jump\" for at least two years before agreeing to write lyrics to it. In his memoir Crazy From The Heat, Roth confirms Eddie's account, admitting a preference for Van Halen's guitar work; however, he says he now enjoys the song. Additionally in his memoir, Roth writes that he wrote the lyrics to \"Jump\" after watching a man waffle as to whether to commit suicide by jumping off of a skyscraper. ==Release== 1984 peaked at number 2 on the Billboard album charts, (behind Michael Jackson's Thriller, which featured an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo on \"Beat It\",) and remained there for 5 straight weeks. It contained the anthems \"Jump\", \"Panama\", \"I'll Wait\" and \"Hot for Teacher\". \"Jump\" reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. 1984 is the second of two Van Halen albums to have achieved RIAA Diamond status, selling over ten million copies in the United States. Their debut Van Halen was the first. \"Jump\" went on to be certified Gold in April 1984, only months after the album's release. The album's follow-up singles \u2013 the synth- driven \"I'll Wait\", and \"Panama\", each peaked at Billboard number 13 on the Pop charts, respectively, in March and June. \"Hot for Teacher\", was a moderate Billboard Hot 100 success, reaching number 56; the MTV video for \"Hot for Teacher\" became even more popular. The \"Hot for Teacher\" video, which was directed by Roth, stars preteen lookalikes of the four Van Halen band members; a stereotypical nerd named \"Waldo\"; David Lee Roth as Waldo's bus driver; and numerous teachers stripping. To promote the album, the band ran a contest on MTV.Hay, Carla. \"Billboard Salutes Twenty Years of MTV\". International Index to Music Periodicals Full Text [ProQuest]. Billboard- The International Newsweekly of Music, Video, and Home Entertainment, July 28, 2001 The contest was called, \"Lost Weekend\" with Van Halen. Fans mailed over 1 million postcards to MTV in hopes of winning the contest. In the promo for MTV, David Lee Roth said, \"You won't know where you are, you won't know what's going to happen, and when you come back, you're not gonna have any memory of it.\" Kurt Jeffries won the contest and was flown to Detroit to join the band. Jeffries was allowed to bring along his best friend. He was given a Lost Weekend T-shirt and a hat. He was also brought on stage and had a large sheet cake smashed in his face which was followed by about a dozen people pouring champagne on him. ==Critical reception== Reviews for 1984 were generally favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+. He explained that \"Side one is pure 'up', and not only that, it sticks to the ears\" and that \"Van Halen's pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy, and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops.\" He also called side two \"consolation for their loyal fans\u2014a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'.\" J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 four out of five stars. He called it \"the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus.\" He stated that \"\"Jump\" is not exactly the kind of song you'd expect from Van Halen\", but that \"once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start sounding a little more familiar\". Although he mentioned \"Jump\" as having \"suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia\", he went on to state that \"Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined.\" He concluded that \"what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end\u2014driving the melody home\u2014rather than as an end in itself\" and that \"despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock & roll. Believe me, that's no newspeak.\" In a 1984 review, Billboard states the album is \"funnier and more versatile than most of their metal brethren\", calling the production \"typically strong\". A retrospective review by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was extremely positive. He noted that the album caused \"a hoopla that was a bit of a red herring since the band had been layering in synths since their third album, Women and Children First\". He further stated that \"Jump\"'s \"synths played a circular riff that wouldn't have sounded as overpowering on guitar\", but that \"the band didn't dispense with their signature monolithic, pulsating rock.\" He also stated that \"where [previous] albums placed an emphasis on the band's attack, this places an emphasis on the songs, and they're uniformly terrific, the best set of original tunes Van Halen ever had.\" He concluded that \"it's the best showcase of Van Halen's instrumental prowess as a band, the best showcase for Diamond Dave's glorious shtick, the best showcase for their songwriting, just their flat-out best album overall. [...] [T]here's no way Van Halen could have bettered this album with Dave around (and they didn't better it once Sammy [Hagar] joined, either).\" Guitar Player magazine writer Matt Blackett praises the \"deeper cuts\" of the album, \"Drop Dead Legs\", \"House of Pain\", and \"Girl Gone Bad\", calling the guitar work \"fresh and vital\", noting Eddie's \"dark, complex sense of harmony and melody\". Len Comaratta from Consequence of Sound felt Van Halen reached the pinnacle of its commercial and critical success. At the end of the 1980s, Rolling Stone, which had previously been critical of Van Halen, ranked 1984 at number 81 on its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Guitar World magazine placed the album on their list of \"New Sensations: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1984\".https://web.archive.org/web/20140720062416/http://www.guitarworld.com/new- sensations-50-iconic-albums-defined-1984#slide-2 ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Van Halen=== *David Lee Roth \u2013 vocals *Eddie Van Halen \u2013 guitars, keyboards, background vocals *Michael Anthony \u2013 bass guitar, synth bass on \"I'll Wait\", background vocals *Alex Van Halen \u2013 drums ===Production=== *Pete Angelus \u2013 art direction *Chris Bellman \u2013 mastering *Ken Deane \u2013 engineering *Gregg Geller \u2013 mastering *Donn Landee \u2013 engineering *Jo Motta \u2013 project coordination *Margo Nahas \u2013 cover art *Joan Parker \u2013 production coordination *Richard Seireeni \u2013 art direction *Ted Templeman \u2013 production ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+1984 weekly sales chart performance for 1984 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1984) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (Kent Music Report) | 11 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 2 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+2016 weekly sales chart performance for 1984 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+2020 weekly sales chart performance for 1984 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Sales chart performance for singles from 1984 |- !
