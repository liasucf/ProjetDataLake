    "text": "Mawlid or Mawlid al-Nabi al-Sharif (, sometimes simply called in colloquial Arabic , , among other vernacular pronunciations; sometimes , ) is the observance of the birthday of Islamic prophet Muhammad which is commemorated in Rabi' al-awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar. 12th Rabi' al- awwal is the accepted date among most of the Sunni scholars, while Shi'a scholars regard 17th Rabi' al-awwal as the accepted date. The history of this celebration goes back to the early days of Islam when some of the Tabi\u2018un began to hold sessions in which poetry and songs composed to honour Muhammad were recited and sung to the crowds. It has been said that the first Muslim ruler to officially celebrate the birth of the Prophet Muhammad in an impressive ceremony was Muzaffar al-Din G\u00f6kb\u00f6ri (d. 630/1233). The Ottomans declared it an official holiday in 1588, known as Mevlid Kandil.Manuel Franzmann, Christel G\u00e4rtner, Nicole K\u00f6ck Religiosit\u00e4t in der s\u00e4kularisierten Welt: Theoretische und empirische Beitr\u00e4ge zur S\u00e4kularisierungsdebatte in der Religionssoziologie Springer-Verlag 2009 page 351 The term Mawlid is also used in some parts of the world, such as Egypt, as a generic term for the birthday celebrations of other historical religious figures such as Sufi saints. Most denominations of Islam approve of the commemoration of Muhammad's birthday; however, with the emergence of Wahhabism/Salafism and the Ahmadiyya,Observing Islam in Spain: Contemporary Politics and Social Dynamics BRILL, 09.05.2018 p. 101 many Muslims began to disapprove its commemoration, considering it an illicit religious innovation (bid'ah or bidat).http://islamqa.info/en/249 Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid.A Guide to Shariah Law and Islamist Ideology in Western Europe 2007\u20132009, Centre for Islamic Pluralism (2009), p.84 Mawlid is recognized as a national holiday in most of the Muslim-majority countries of the world with the exception of Saudi Arabia and Qatar which are officially Wahhabi/Salafi. Some non-Muslim majority countries with large Muslim populations such as India also recognise it as a public holiday.https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/india/milad-un-nabi ==Etymology== Mawlid is derived from the Arabic root word (), meaning to give birth, bear a child, descendant. \u2013 Moungued Dictionary (paper), or online: Webster's Arabic English Dictionary In contemporary usage, Mawlid refers to the observance of the birthday of Muhammad.Mawlid. Reference.com Along with being referred to as the celebration of the birth of Muhammad, the term Mawlid refers to the 'text especially composed for and recited at Muhammad's nativity celebration' or \"a text recited or sung on that day\". ==Date== According to the majority of Sunni Muslims and some Shi'as, Muhammad was born on the 12th of Rabi' al-awwal. Many Twelver Shia Muslims on the other hand assert that Muhammad was born on the 17th of Rabi' al-awwal. It stands as a matter of ikhtilaf or disagreement since some Shiite scholars such as Kulayni, Saduq, and al-Thani have affirmed the date of the 12th of Rabi' al-Awal. Nonetheless, others contend that the date of Muhammad's birth is unknown and is not definitively recorded in the Islamic traditions. The issue of the correct date of the Mawlid is recorded by Ibn Khallikan as constituting the first proven disagreement concerning the celebration. ==History== Mawlid an-Nabi procession at Boulac Avenue in 1904 at Cairo, Egypt. The Garebeg festival celebrating Mawlid in Yogyakarta, Java Island, Indonesia. In early days of Islam, observation of Muhammad's birth as a holy day was usually arranged privately and later was an increased number of visitors to the Mawlid house that was open for the whole day specifically for this celebration. This celebration was introduced into the city Sabta by Abu 'l'Abbas al-Azafi as a way of strengthening the Muslim community and to counteract Christian festivals. The early celebrations, included elements of Sufic influence, with animal sacrifices and torchlight processions along with public sermons and a feast. The celebrations occurred during the day, in contrast to modern day observances, with the ruler playing a key role in the ceremonies. Emphasis was given to the Ahl al-Bayt with presentation of sermons and recitations of the Qur'an. The exact origins of the Mawlid is difficult to trace. According to Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God, the significance of the event was established when Muhammad fasted on Monday, citing the reason for this was his birth on that day, and when Umar took into consideration Muhammad's birth as a possible starting time for the Islamic calendar. According to Festivals in World Religions, the Mawlid was first introduced by the Abbasids in Baghdad. It has been suggested that the Mawlid was first formalized by Al-Khayzuran of the Abbasids. Ibn Jubayr, in 1183, writes that Muhammad's birthday was celebrated every Monday of Rabi' al-awwal at his birthplace, which had been converted into a place of devotion under the Abbasids. According to the hypothesis of Nico Kaptein of Leiden University, a form of celebrating the birth of Muhammad was practiced by the Fatimids. Annemarie Schimmel also says that the tendency to celebrate the memory of the Prophet's birthday on a larger and more festive scale was done in Egypt during the Fatimids. The Egyptian historian Maqrizi (d. 1442) describes one such celebration held in 1122 as an occasion in which mainly scholars and religious establishment participated. They listened to sermons, distributed sweets, particularly honey, the Prophet's favourite and the poor received alms. This Shia origin is frequently noted by those Sunnis who oppose Mawlid. According to Encyclop\u00e6dia Brittanica, however, what the Fatimid's did was simply a court-procession of court-officials which did not involve the public but was restricted to the court of the Fatimid caliph. Therefore, it has been concluded that the first Mawlid celebration which was a public festival was started by Sunnis in 1207 by Mu\u1e93affar al-D\u012bn G\u00f6kburi. ===Start of a Public Holiday=== In 1207, Mu\u1e93affar al-D\u012bn G\u00f6kburi started the first annual public festival of the Mawlid in Erbil (modern day Iraq). G\u00f6kb\u00f6ri was the brother-in-law of Saladin and soon the festival began to spread across the Muslim world. Since Saladin and Gokburi were both Sufis the festival became increasingly popular among Sufi devotees which remains so till this day. == Observances == Sekaten fair in Indonesia, a week-long celebration of Mawlid. International Mawlid Conference, Minar-e-Pakistan, Lahore, Pakistan. Mawlid is celebrated in almost all Islamic countries, and in other countries that have a significant Muslim population, such as Ethiopia, India, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, France, Germany, Italy, Iraq, Iran, Maldives, Morocco, Jordan, Libya, Russia and Canada. The only exceptions are Qatar and Saudi Arabia where it is not an official public holiday and is forbidden. However, In the last decades of the late 20th century there has been a trend to \"forbid or discredit\" Mawlid in the Sunni Muslim world. In Turkey, Mawlid (Turkish: Mevlud Kandili or \"the candle feast for the Prophet's birthday\" ) is celebrated as a public holiday and traditional poems regarding Muhammad's life are recited both in public mosques and at home on the evening.Kenan Aksu Turkey: A Regional Power in the Making Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 18.07.2014 p. 231 Often organized in some countries by the Sufi orders, Mawlid is celebrated in a carnival manner, large street processions are held and homes or mosques are decorated. Charity and food is distributed, and stories about the life of Muhammad are narrated with recitation of poetry by children.Pakistan Celebrate Eid Milad-un-Nabi with Religious Zeal, Fervor . Pakistan Times. 2 April 2007. Scholars and poets celebrate by reciting Qa\u1e63\u012bda al-Burda Sharif, the famous poem by 13th-century Arabic Sufi Busiri. A general Mawlid appears as \"a chaotic, incoherent spectacle, where numerous events happen simultaneously, all held together only by the common festive time and space\". These celebrations are often considered an expression of the Sufi concept of the pre-existence of Muhammad. However, the main significance of these festivities is expression of love for Muhammad. During Pakistan's Mawlid, the day starts with a 31-gun salute in federal capital and a 21-gun salute at the provincial capitals and religious hymns are sung during the day.Pakistan with Muslims world-over celebrate Eid Milad-un-Nabi tomorrow In many parts of Indonesia, the celebration of the Mawlid al-nabi \"seems to surpass in importance, liveliness, and splendour\" the two official Islamic holidays of Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.Herman Beck, Islamic purity at odds with Javanese identity: the Muhammadiyah and the celebration of Garebeg Maulud ritual in Yogyakarta, Pluralism and Identity: Studies in Ritual Behaviour, eds Jan Platvoet and K. van der Toorn, BRILL, 1995, pg 262 In Qayrawan, Tunisia, Muslims sing and chant hymns of praise to Muhammad, welcoming him in honor of his birth.

Such poems have been written in many languages, including Arabic, Kurdish and Turkish.Kenan Aksu Turkey: A Regional Power in the Making Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 18.07.2014 p. 231 These texts contain stories of the life of Muhammad, or at least some of the following chapters from his life, briefly summarized below: # The Ancestors of Muhammad # The Conception of Muhammad # The Birth of Muhammad # Introduction of Halima # Life of Young Muhammad in Bedouins # Muhammad's orphanhood # Abu Talib's nephew's first caravan trip # Arrangement of Marriage between Muhammad and Khadija # Al-Isra' # Al-Mi'radj, or the Ascension to heaven # Al-Hira, first revelation # The first converts to Islam # The Hijra # Muhammad's death These text are only part of the ceremonies. There are many different ways that people celebrate Mawlid, depending on where they are from. There appears to be a cultural influence upon what kind of festivities are a part of the Mawlid celebration. In Indonesia, it is common the congregation recite Simthud Durar, especially among Arab Indonesians. ==Permissibility== A banner with Maulid greetings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Among Muslim scholars, the legality of Mawlid \"has been the subject of intense debate\" and has been described as \"perhaps one of the most polemical discussions in Islamic law\". Traditionally, most Sunni and nearly all of the Shia scholars have approved of the celebration of Mawlid, while Salafi and Ahmadiyya scholars oppose the celebration.\"True Commemoration of the blessed life of the Holy Prophet (pbuh)\", Al Islam Online ===Support=== Examples of historic Sunni scholars who permitted the Mawlid include the Shafi'i scholar Al-Suyuti (d 911 A.H.) who stated that: > My answer is that the legal status of the observance of the Mawlid \u2013 as long > as it just consists of a meeting together by the people, a recitation of > apposite parts of the Qur'an, the recounting of transmitted accounts of the > beginning of (the biography of) the Prophet \u2013 may God bless him and grant > him peace \u2013 and the wonders that took place during his birth, all of which > is then followed by a banquet that is served to them and from which they > eat-is a good innovation (bid'a hasana), for which one is rewarded because > of the esteem shown for the position of the Prophet \u2013 may God bless him and > grant him peace \u2013 that is implicit in it, and because of the expression of > joy and happiness on his \u2013 may God bless him and grant him peace \u2013 noble > birth. The Shafi'i scholar Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d 852 A.H.) too approved of the Mawlid and states that: > As for what is performed on the day of the Mawlid, one should limit oneself > to what expresses thanks to God, such as the things that have already been > mentioned: [Qur'anic] recitation, serving food, alms-giving, and recitation > of praise [poems] about the Prophet \u2013 may God bless him and grant him peace > \u2013 and asceticism which motivate people to perform good deeds and act in view > of the next world. The Damascene Shafi'i scholar Abu Shama (died 1268) (who was a teacher of Imam al-Nawawi (d 676 A.H.)) also supports the celebration of the Mawlid as does the Maliki scholar Ibn al-Hajj (d 737 A.H.) who spoke positively of the observance of the Mawlid in his book al-Madhkal. Likewise, the Shafi'i Egyptian scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami (d. 974 A.H.) was an avid supporter of the Mawlid and wrote a text in praise of it. This was supported and commented on by the Egyptian scholar and former head of Al-Azhar University Ibrahim al- Bajuri and by the Hanafi Syrian Mufti Ibn Abidin. Another Hanafi Mufti Ali al- Qari (d. 1014 A.H.) too supported the celebration of the Mawlid and wrote a text on the subject as did the Moroccan Maliki scholar Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ja\u02bffar al- Katt\u0101n\u012b (d. 1345 A.H.). Ibn al-Jazari (d. 833 A.H.), a Syrian Shafi'i scholar considers the celebration of the Mawlid to be a means of gaining Paradise. In the Muslim world, the majority of Sunni Islamic scholars are in favor of the Mawlid.: \"In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the celebration of the Prophet's (s) birthday and the recitation of mawlid texts were ubiquitous practices endorsed by the majority of mainstream Sunni scholars... by the modern period the celebration of the Mawlid was overwhelmingly accepted and practiced at all levels of religious education and authority. Prominent elite scholars continued to contribute to the development of the tradition.\" Examples include the former Grand Mufi of Al-Azhar University Ali Gomaa, Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki of Saudi Arabia, Yusuf al-Qaradawi,Shaykh Qardawi Approves of Celebrating Mawlid. Yusuf Al-Qardawi. the primary scholar of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, Habib Ali al-Jifri, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, Muhammad bin Yahya al-Ninowy of Syria, Muhammad Ibn Ahmad al-Khazraji, president of the Heritage and History Committee of the United Arab Emirates and Zaid Shakir, all of whom subscribe to Sunni Islam, have given their approval for the observance of Mawlid. ===Opposition=== Ibn Taymiyya's position on the Mawlid has been described as \"paradoxical\" and \"complex\" by some academics. He ruled that it was a reprehensible (makr\u016bh) devotional innovation and criticised those who celebrated the Mawlid out of a desire to imitate the Christian celebration of Jesus's birthday. At the same time, he recognised that some observe Muhammad's birthday out of a desire to show their love and reverence of him and thus deserve a great reward for their good intentions. The Salafi writer Hamid al-Fiqi (d. 1959) criticised Ibn Taymiyya for holding this view and stating that \"How can they receive a reward for this when they are opposing the guidance of God's Messenger (pbuh)?\". The Mawlid was not accepted by Wahhabi and Salafi. Taj al-Din al-Fakihani (d. 1331), an Egyptian Maliki, considered Mawlid to be a blameworthy innovation that was either makruh or haram. This view was shared by fellow Egyptian Maliki Ibn al- Haj al-Abdari, who added that the celebration was never practiced by the Salaf. However Ibn al-Haj affirms the auspicious qualities of the month of the Mawlid in the most effusive terms and considers Muhammad's date of birth as a particularly blessed time of the year. The Maliki scholar Al-Shatibi considered Mawlid an illegitimate innovation. The Andalusian jurist Abu 'Abd Allah al-Haffar (d. 1408) opposed Mawlid, noting that had the Sahaba celebrated it then its exact date would not be a matter of uncertainty. The former Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz, along with Hammud ibn 'Abd Allah al-Tuwayjiri (d. 1992), another Saudi scholar, in their opposition also argued that there were many worthy occasions in Muhammad's life which he never commemorated, such as the revelation of the first verses of the Qur'an, the Night Journey and the hijra. In 1934, the minister of education in Egypt criticized the \"useless stories\" which filled Mawlid poetry, as he believed these were incompatible with a modern and scientific viewpoint that represented Muhammad on a more sober level. Similar criticism arose in 1982 when a chairman of the Mecca-based Orthodox Muslim Organization Rabita declared celebrations of Mawlid an \"evil innovation.\" While the Ahmadiyya deem the perpetual commemoration of Muhammad's life as highly desirable and consider the remembrance of him as a source of blessings, they condemn the common, traditional practices associated with the Mawlid as blameworthy innovations,\"Does \u201cMilad\u201d Have Any Validity Whatsoever in the Holy Qur\u2019an?\" Ahmadiyya Anjuman Isha'at-e-Islam Gatherings limited to the recounting of Muhammad's life and character and the recitation of poetry eulogising him, whether held on a specific date of Rabi' al-awwal or in any other month, are deemed permissible.\"Rab\u012b\u02bf al-Awwal (I): The Blessed month of the Blessed Prophet (saw)\", MuslimSunrise Formal gatherings called Jalsa Seerat-un-Nabi commemorating Muhammad's life and legacy, rather than specifically his birth, are frequently held by Ahmadis and are often oriented towards both Muslim and non-Muslim audiences. These gatherings could be held in the month of the Mawlid but are promoted often throughout the year.https://www.alislam.org/v/k-Seerat-un-Nabi.html?page=1 Seerat-un-Nabi ==Other uses== In some countries, such as Egypt and Sudan, Mawlid is used as a generic term for the celebration of birthdays of local Sufi saints and not only restricted to the observance of the birth of Muhammad. Around 3,000 Mawlid celebrations are held each year. These festivals attract an international audience, with the largest one in Egypt attracting up to three million people honouring Ahmad al-Badawi, a local 13th-century Sufi saint. ==Gallery== File:Mawlid an-Nabawi SallAllaho Alaihi wa Sallam Celebrations in Cairo in 1878.jpg|Mawlid an-Nabawi celebrations in Cairo in 1878 File:Mawlid Celebrations in Ottoman Benghazi.jpg|The Ottoman flag is raised during Mawlid an-Nabi celebration of Mohammad's birthday in 1896 in the field of municipal Libyan city of Benghazi File:\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0434 \u0432 \u041a\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0435 (\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f). 25 \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f 2007.jpg|Mawlid under the supervision of Shaykh Sufi Riaz Ahmed Naqshbandi Aslami, 2007 ==See also== *Durood *Hamd *Ha\u1e0dra *Madih nabawi *Mehfil *Na'at *Mawlid al-Barzanj\u012b *Islamic poetry *Mid-Sha'ban *Ya Muhammad ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * * ==Further reading== * Hagen, Gottfried (2014), \"Mawlid (Ottoman)\", in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God (2 vols.), Edited by C.
