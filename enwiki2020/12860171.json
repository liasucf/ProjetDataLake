    "text": "And Then There Were None is a 1943 play by crime writer Agatha Christie. The play, like the 1939 book on which it is based, was originally titled and performed in the UK as \"Ten Little Niggers\". It was also performed under the name Ten Little Indians. ==Background== Christie had been pleased with the book, stating in her autobiography \"I wrote the book after a tremendous amount of planning, and I was pleased with what I made of it.\"Christie, Agatha. An Autobiography (Page 471). Collins, 1977. The book was very well received upon publication and Christie received a request from Reginald Simpson to be allowed to dramatise it. Christie refused, because she relished the challenge herselfMorgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (Page 227) Collins, 1984 although it would take her two years to carry out the task. She knew the ending would have to be changed because all of the characters die in the book and therefore \"I must make two of the characters innocent, to be reunited at the end and come safe out of the ordeal.\"An Autobiography. (Pages 471\u20132). The original nursery rhyme that inspired the title had an alternative ending: :\"He got married and then there were none\" This allowed Christie to portray a different conclusion on stage.Morgan. (Pages 238\u2013242) After the play had been written, most people she discussed it with considered it impossible to produce. She received some encouragement from Charles Cochrane but he was unable to find financial backers. Finally, Bertie Mayer, who had produced the 1928 play Alibi, agreed to stage it.An Autobiography. (Page 472). After a try- out at the Wimbledon Theatre starting on 20 September 1943, the play opened in the West End at the St James's Theatre on 17 November. It gained good reviews and ran for 260 performances until 24 February 1944 when the theatre was bombed. It then transferred to the Cambridge Theatre opening on 29 February and running at that venue until 6 May. It then transferred back to the restored St James' on 9 May and finally closed on 1 July. Although she did not feel it to be her best play, Christie did declare it was her best piece of \"craftsmanship\". She also considered it to be the play which formally started her career as a playwright, despite the success of Black Coffee in 1930. == Scenes == The scene of the play is the living-room of the house on Indian Island (Note: Nigger Island in the 1943 UK production), off the coast of Devon.

Like Hotspur, who could kill six dozen Scots at breakfast, complain of his quiet life, and then ask for work, she is not one to be concerned about a mere singleton corpse. But she can add quality to quantity in her domestic morgue. In Ten Little Niggers she shows an intense ingenuity in adapting that very lethal rhyme (so oddly deemed a nursery matter) to modern conditions.\" Mr. Brown concluded that Henrietta Watson's portrayal of Emily Brent was, \"the most authentic member of a house party with 'no future in it. played the airmen say. That gently lugubrious phrase certainly does not hold of the play.\"The Observer 21 November 1943 (Page 2) ===Credits of London production=== Director: Irene Hentschel Decor by: Clifford Pember ====Cast==== William Murray \u2013 Rogers Reginald Barlow \u2013 Narracott Hilda Bruce-Potter \u2013 Mrs Rogers Linden Travers \u2013 Vera Claythorne Terence De Marney \u2013 Philip Lombard Michael Blake \u2013 Anthony Marston Percy Walsh \u2013 William Blore Eric Cowley \u2013 General MacKenzie Henrietta Watson \u2013 Emily Brent Allan Jeayes \u2013 Sir Lawrence Wargarve Gwyn Nicholls \u2013 Dr ArmstrongChristie, Agatha.

It was first published in hardback in The Mousetrap and Other Plays by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1978 () and in the UK by Harper Collins in 1993 (). At some point after the end of the Second World War, a survivor of Buchenwald concentration camp contacted Christie and told her that the inmates had staged their own production there, undoubtedly writing their own script as they would not have had access to the Christie version. Christie was told that they found that it had \"sustained them\".Morgan. (Page 266) In November 2007, Lakota East High School in West Chester, OH, was set to perform the play but plans were cancelled after the NAACP protested about the production because of the original title of the novel. Lakota East High School officials subsequently revised their plans and decided to perform the play on 29 November under the title \"And Then There Were None\". ===2005 production=== On 14 October 2005 a new version of play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London. For this version, Elyot returned to the book version of the story and restored the original ending where both Vera and Lombard die and Wargrave commits suicide. The version of the rhyme and island name used was \"Ten Little Soldiers\" and \"Soldier Island\" as per current printings of the novel. Despite some positive reviews, the play closed on 14 January 2006. ==References== ==External links== Category:Plays by Agatha Christie Category:1943 plays ",
