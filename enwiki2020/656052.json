    "text": "The Nordic Folkboat is a small sailboat, rigged as a sloop. The design of this boat was the result of a competition held by the Scandinavian Yacht Racing Union in 1942, who were hoping to create an easily sailed and low-cost boat. The competition produced no outright \"winner \" but, taking the best features of a number of the entries received, the organisers commissioned professional designer Tord Sund\u00e9n to create a craft that met the goals of the design competition. The resulting boat went on to become an international favorite of sailors and still endures more than 70 years after its design. The first Nordic Folkboat was built in Gothenburg in Sweden, and as of 2007, more than 4000 Nordic Folkboats are still sailing around the world. ==Design== Wooden Nordic Folkboat in 2007 The Nordic Folkboat was designed to be constructed of wood with a clinker or lap-strake hull. Oak framing and fir planking were specified, though different builders used many different species of wood. The boat has an open cockpit and a low coachroof covering a small trunk cabin usually consisting of two bunks and minimal lockerage. The boat is rigged as a simple fractional sloop, with minimal standing rigging, consisting only of two lower shrouds, two jumper shrouds, a headstay, and a backstay. Despite the simplicity of the rigging, the mast is highly tunable, enabling the Folkboat to sail well in light and heavy air well beyond initial expectations. The boat\u2019s iron ballast keel represents more than half of this displacement, it extremely stiff and seaworthy. It is one of the smallest craft to have made regular ocean crossings and circumnavigations. ==Evolution== A fibreglass and timber Folkboat lay side by side. The cabin top and cockpit on the right differ from the original design. In 1966 Tord Sund\u00e9n introduced the carvel- planked \u201cInternational Folkboat\u201d with a self-bailing cockpit. This design corresponded largely to the original, but offered more comfort below deck and safety above. However, the term \u201cInternational Folkboat\u201d was too misleading and was forbidden. Today, the class is simply called \u201cIF-boat.\u201d The IF-boat was manufactured at Marieholms Bruk in Sm\u00e5land (Sweden) until 1984. In 1968 the Folkboat began to be manufactured in modern molded glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) \u201cfiberglass\u201d. In 1975, Erik Andreasen, a Dane, introduced a GRP replica of the original design, since known as the \u201c Nordic Folkboat\u201d, using a mold taken from his own Gold Cup winning boat. Weights and measurements were carefully preserved to ensure level competition with wooden boats, and only an outboard engine was provided. Today wooden and GRP boats race together. The class rules are administrated by the Folkboat International Association. The largest international regattas are: Gold Cup (an unofficial world championship), Sessan Cup (a team race), Kieler Woche and San Francisco Cup. There are active fleets in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland, USA, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium and Estonia. ==Long distance sailing== In the 1950s, the Folkboat began to attract the attention of long- distance voyagers for its modest cost and seaworthiness. * Ann Gash from Australia made a single-handed circumnavigation in Ilimo between 1975 and 1977. * 1962/1963 Adrian Hayter sailed single handed from the U.K. to New Zealand in 'Valkyr' by the Westward/Panama route. * Lt. Col. H.G. \"Blondie\" Hasler sailed a greatly modified folkboat Jester to second place in the first Observer Singlehanded Trans Atlantic Race in 1960. * Mike Richie sailed Jester in several Singlehanded Trans Atlantic Races until it was damaged and lost at sea. Richie survived and competed for many years in a replica. * Rozelle Raines sailed Martha McGilda singlehanded to Russia in the 1960s, the first British Woman to do so. * Sharon Sites Adams was the first woman to single- hand from California to Hawaii, in 1965. ==Fleets== Folkboats in San Francisco According to Nordic Folkboat International Association by 2007, the largest Folkboat fleet is in Sweden (1300 registered boats) followed by Denmark (1125), Germany (900), Finland (400), UK (100), U.S.A. (100) and The Netherlands (48). * In the United Kingdom, a large fleet has developed on the south coast, and the class is continuing to expand. The 2018 Nordic Folkboat Nationals were hosted by the Royal Lymington Yacht Club. * In the United States, an active group of Folkboats in the San Francisco Bay Area is organized as the San Francisco Bay Folkboat Association, which schedules various racing and social events such as the bi-annual San Francisco Cup Regatta. The San Francisco Bay fleet has been supported over the years by the Alameda, California boatbuilder Sven Svendsen, who was the first US builder of Fiberglass Nordic Folkboats. * In Canada, a racing fleet existed on Lake Ontario from the early 1950s till the 1970s. Approximately 24 Danish built Folkboats were imported, the earlier ones being the first Folkboats in North America. There were three builders of Folkboats in operation at various times, one is still in operation but has not built a boat of that class for some time. Many of the original Danish built Folkboats and most of the more numerous Canadian built boats are still sailing, particularly on the Great Lakes where they are a common sight in most harbours. * In Estonia, a recent revival of Folkboat class has occurred. During the Soviet occupation, many Folkboats were built at Tallinn Experimental Shipyard of Sport Vessels. Due to varying quality, most of these boats have not survived. Nevertheless, a group of enthusiasts has restored few old folkboats (or \"folkars\", as they are called in Estonian sailing slang) and brought in additional boats mostly from Sweden. In 2012, as many as 11 Nordic Folkboats have been registered for annual Offshore Championship of Estonia. Currently, 25 Folkboats are registered in the database of Estonian Yachting Union. The Folkboat is also a popular cruising yacht especially in the Baltic Sea area, despite its small interior size and lack of \"heads\". ==Design considerations == At the time of the Folkboat\u2019s design many Scandinavian sailors lacked the money to purchase and maintain a large yacht, or even pay for the design of a custom small yacht. Many members needed to store their boats on land. Many also wanted to build their own boats. Combining resources to get an excellent design was economical. The folkboat was therefore designed for regional Scandinavian conditions. Sailing in the Baltic is mostly pleasant island-hopping. Most trips are in shallow water, on the continental shelf, in rivers and canals, often with low bridges, but there are ventures into deep ocean. The Baltic is also windy, with dangerous equinoctial storms. These original considerations remain true for Folkboat owners today. ==Rig== The Folkboat is a fractionally rigged sloop, with the forestay attached 7/8s the way to the masthead. This Puts less pressure on the mast, and makes the boat less top-heavy than a masthead rigged sloop. It also makes the boat easier to sail into the wind. The standard suit of sails a mainsail and jib, both with reefing ties. The Association also defines a spinnaker, and Finland's folkboat association permits one for racing. The design includes an optional hinged mast tabernacle (a hinge for the mast to fold), allowing the boat to sail under low bridges, as commonly found on canals. The trade-off of a 7/8ths rig is that it reduces the area of the jib substantially. In the Baltic, and the stormy areas where the folkboat is most popular, the problem is often one of too much wind, Making this an advantage where the boat is sailed most frequently. In the tropics, where most of the time the wind is lighter, a folkboat is often under-powered with the standard rig. Some owners choose to rerig for a larger jib. A tropical conversion favored by several cruisers is to add a short removable (\"studding\") bowsprit and light removable top-stay. This lets a folkboat fly a very light full genoa jib (a drifter) outboard of the cut of its standard jib. In heavy weather, the bowsprit and light stay have little windage and weight, and can be left up. In higher latitudes or racing, both can be dismounted, allowing a return of the boat to its classic traits. A more radical innovation was placed on the famous series of three single-handed transatlantic racing Jesters, which were rigged with a single flat elliptical sail. This Chinese junk-like sail is so simple that it could be completely managed from inside the boat. ===Weight and balance=== The folkboat's most extreme feature is a 1000 kg cast-iron keel, representing just more than half of the boat's weight (compared to a typical sailboat\u2018s keel of 1/3 or less). The heavy keel slows the boat more than a fin keel, by both forcing the hull deeper in the water and causing more area to be wetted. However, it lets a Folkboat sail in only 1.2 meters of water, yet remain safe in very strong winds. The iron keel is also very sturdy, resisting damage common for week-end sailors in shallow water, such as running aground. ===Hull form=== The Folkboat hull is a classic shallow-water sailing form, with a semi-elliptical low-drag full-length keel and an integrated rudder whose bottom is physically protected by the keel. The long elliptical keel resists side-ways forces, minimizing leeway. To keep the boat simple, reliable, inexpensive and strong, it has no centerboard and only a simple rudder. ===History of innovation=== The hullform is designed for bent wood, laid with overlapping ends (clinker- built), easy for amateur builders with low budgets. However, the association has been reasonably flexible. In 1949, they approved carvel-built boats (ends of the hull planking butt, rather than overlap). In 1976, an inexpensive (gun- shot flock) fiberglass hull was approved. In 1999, after persistent reasonable argument by a certain Swedish aerospace engineer, the association accepted a design for an aluminum mast, whisker and spinnaker poles. ==Builders== ===Current=== * Folkboat Central Hamburg (ex Kerteminde) * Bootbau in Switzerland * Brandt-M\u00f8ller Boatyard in Denmark * Parnu Shipyard in Estonia ===Former=== * Varne ==Related designs== The Folkboat's classic design has spawned countless related designs inspired by its timeless grace and elegant seaworthy hull form.contessa-26.pdf, copy of article from Practical Boat Owner at cowescharters.com Retrieved 16 February 2017See 'Peter Poland\u2019s \u2018Folkboat Family Tree\u2019, mentioned here: 'first used folkboat show', pbo.co.uk Retrieved 16 February 2017 Among these have been: * British Folkboat, in various derivatives, most with carvel, rather than clinker, construction, and greater living space below, achieved through longer and/or wider coachroof designs, or increasing freeboard through an extra plank.Description of British Folkboat sold through seattle.boatshed.com Retrieved 16 February 2017 * Folkdancer (Frederick Parker, 1967, Hurley Marine & Russel Marine)Folkdancer mentioned at solentmarinesurveys.com Retrieved 16 February 2017Folkdancer description at yachtingmonthly.com Retrieved 16 February 2017 * IF-boat * Stella * Walton 25 (Canada) * Warsash One Design * Whitby 25 (Canada) And, based on a website for the Contessa 26,article 'folkboat designs their derivatives' at co26.com Retrieved 16 February 2017 * Folksong 25 * Contessa 26 * Marieholm IF (see 'IF-boat' above) * Bowman 26 * Marieholm 26 * Invicta 26 (Van de Stadt) * Hurley 27 * Halcyon 27 * Dockrell 27 * Alberg 30 (Canada) a one-design developed at the request of the Canadian Folkboat Association ==External links== * Nordic Folkboat International Association *Danish Folkboat Association * Estonian Folkboat Flotilla *Finnish Folkboat Association *German Folkboat Association *San Francisco Bay Folkboat Association *Swedish Folkboat Association *UK Folkboat Association *Folkboats Australia *International Folkboat links *An online diary of a folkboat in Wales, UK *Folkboat Erasmus, US 118.
