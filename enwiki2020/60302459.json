Oller, a student at Ohio State University in Columbus when the murder occurred, began investigating the case in 2013. He had just finished writing American Queen, and stumbled into the cold case on a website for amateur unsolved-homicide sleuths as he was looking for a new writing project. In 2015 the Columbus police department credited Oller with tracking down the information that solved the case; after a renewed investigation, the police concluded that Mullins was murdered by Henry Newell Jr., who had died of cancer in September 2013, at age 63.' ===Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew (1997)=== Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew is a biography of American actress Jean Arthur. ==References== ==External links== * John Oller, author website Category:20th-century American biographers ",
