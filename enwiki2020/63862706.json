    "text": "Kielmeyera variabilis (malva-do-campo or pau santo) is tree growing to a height of 3\u20136 meters, found in savannah regions of eastern and central Brazil (the Cerrado). K. variabilis is traditionally used in folk medicine to treat tropical diseases including schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, as well as fungal and bacterial infections.Alves TMA, Silva AF, Brand\u00e3o M, Grandi TSM, Sm\u00e2nia EF, Sm\u00e2nia Jr A, Zani CL 2000. Biological screening of Brazilian medicinal plants. Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz 95: 367-373. K. variabilis has been shown to contain three flavonols and a biflavone known to show antioxidant activity: quercitrin, quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-galactoside; and podocarpusflavone A (the biflavone). In 2019 a new acylphoroglucinol isolated from the branches of the tree showed activity against Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Kielmeyera Category:Endemic flora of Brazil Category:Trees of Brazil Category:Flora of the Cerrado Category:Medicinal plants of South America Category:Taxa named by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius Category:Plants described in 1825 ",
