The Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman - the Afzalipour Campus has a modernist style of architecture inspired by the vernacular architecture of the region. The architecture of this university is very distinct in that almost all of the colleges are connected. All of the colleges have a similar style of architecture. Afzalipour assigned Bonyan Consulting Company to prepare a campus master plan and design the buildings of the university Master plan and design concepts were developed to tackle the problem of uncertainty. It was set as a primary goal to have a flexible design both inside the buildings and in their inter-connections. In each stage of development, the campus was to be a complete and coherent whole, still allowing for future expansion without hindering the functioning departments. The master plan was inspired by the organic urban grid of Kerman city centre that has historically evolved in response to climatic conditions of a desert town. The height of the main building blocks are restricted to 3, optimizing seismological, climatic, economic and circulation considerations. Interconnection of the blocks on the upper stories integrates educational and research spaces, thus enhancing flexibility. These also provide shadow and shelter for open pathways under-passing below. Careful distancing of blocks, along with articulate projections of the buildings, allow natural and controlled lighting for inner spaces while creating ample shadow for the inner courtyards. This general arrangement, permits one to cross the whole campus through courtyards and archways with minimal detours, under protection from direct sunlight or rain if needed, or to access other departments from within the buildings and through connecting corridors and internal patios. Currently, two new colleges are being built, an extension to the college of Agriculture, which connects the Saba Faculty of Art and Architecture to the rest of colleges at the campus and also the new college of Management and Economics, which is connected to the rest of colleges via the newly built College of Geology. The Campus of Technology and Engineering has also a unique style of architecture but very different from the style of the Afzalipour Campus. == International study and exchange == The Office of International Exchange Programs was established to provide students and faculty with exchange opportunities, including sending and hosting visiting scholars, aiding faculty members in arranging international study tours, developing exchange agreements with universities around the world. == Student organisations == There are several student organizations active throughout the university. Most of these organizations are only concentrated on academic activities with some also interested and active in political issues. == Notable alumni == * Eshaq Jahangiri, first vice president of Hassan Rouhani's government * Majid Namjoo, Iranian Minister of Energy * Omid Tabibzadeh, Iranian linguist * Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi, former Iranian Minister of Science, Research and Technology * Hessam Yazdani, professor of civil engineering, Howard University, Washington, D.C., USA * Reza Mirzaeifar, professor of mechanical engineering, Virginia Tech, Virginia, USA == See also == * Education in Iran * Higher education in Iran * Alireza Afzalipour * Fakhereh Saba * National Library of Iran * List of Iranian Research Centers * List of Iranian scientists from the pre-modern era * Modern Iranian scientists and engineers ==References== == External links == * *Official website of Research Deputy *Official website of Studies Deputy *Official website of Developments Deputy *Official website of Students affairs Deputy *Portal for the students of College of Literature and Social Sciences *Official website of Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman at the Ministry of Higher Education - Center for Cultural Affairs Category:Universities in Iran Category:Educational institutions established in 1972 Category:Education in Kerman Province Category:Buildings and structures in Kerman Province ",
