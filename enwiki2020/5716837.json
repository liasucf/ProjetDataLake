    "text": "Claudio Andr\u00e9s del Tr\u00e1nsito Maldonado Rivera (born 3 January 1980) is a former Chilean footballer who played as a defensive midfielder for clubs as Colo- Colo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Cruzeiro, Santos, Fenerbah\u00e7e, Flamengo and Corinthians. He currently works as Red Bull Bragantino assistant manager. ==Club career== ===S\u00e3o Paulo=== He spent three seasons with S\u00e3o Paulo making 36 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A appearances with the team. ===Cruzeiro=== In May 2003, Vanderlei Luxemburgo, then coach of Cruzeiro, bought the services of Maldonado. At the time of the purchase, Maldonado's then girlfriend was Luxemburgo's daughter. Nevertheless, while with Cruzeiro, Maldonado experienced the most success of his career. In 2003, he played for the first team in the history of Brazilian football to win the triple crown. ===Santos=== For the 2006 season, Maldonado was reunited with former Cruzeiro's coach Luxemburgo at Santos However at the end of the Brazilian season was scheduled to have ankle surgery which caused him to miss up to two months. After recuperating Maldonado continued playing for Santos reaching the semi-finals of the 2007 Copa Libertadores. Currently Santos has completed the 2007 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A in second place and are eligible to compete in the upcoming Copa Libertadores 2008. He was being tracked by Fenerbah\u00e7e, Milan, Real Madrid and Ajax but no firm offers better than Fenerbah\u00e7e have been made. At 28 he was at the peak of his potential and European teams wanted to capitalise on this, but they were probably put off by the 8 red cards that he had received in the previous 3 years at club level. ===Fenerbah\u00e7e=== On the beginning of 2008 Maldonado signed with Fenerbah\u00e7e in 1\u00bd year contract, at that time managed by Zico.
