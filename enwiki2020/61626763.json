    "text": "\"Bezerk\" is a single by American rapper Big Sean featuring American rapper ASAP Ferg and American record producer Hit-Boy. It was released on August 26, 2019 as a standalone single. The song was produced by Hit-Boy, with additional production by DJ Corbett and G-Dav. == Background and composition == Hours after the song was released, it was premiered by Big Sean and ASAP Ferg at the MTV Video Music Awards. A snippet of the music video was also teased on Twitter by Sean on the same day. On a \"bouncy, 808-heavy\" beat produced by Hit-Boy, the rappers bring great energy and rap about a variety of topics, including designer clothing, relationships with women and God-given abilities; Ferg talks about \"moving product\" in his youth. The two also \"trade bars\" about their haters. == Music video == The music video for the song was directed by Mike Carson and the two rappers, and premiered on September 26, 2019. It starts off with the rappers buying snacks at a liquor store. Big Sean buys an Arizona ice tea, which ASAP Ferg warns will lower sperm count. As they debate, a young girl approaches them and throws a grenade at them, seemingly transporting Sean and Ferg to an alternate universe, where they run though a neighborhood and are chased by children. They even become airborne for a while and hang from the top of the Big Ben, now bedazzled in diamonds as a resemblance to Rolex. == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 26 |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== == References == Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Big Sean songs Category:Songs written by Big Sean Category:Songs written by ASAP Ferg Category:Songs written by Hit-Boy Category:GOOD Music singles Category:Def Jam Recordings singles Category:Trap music songs ",
