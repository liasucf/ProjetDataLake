    "text": "The Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad (LELCA) ( (LELB\u0100L); ) is a Lutheran denomination with a presence in Latvia, Australia, Sweden, United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. It is a member of the Lutheran World Federation, which it joined in 1947. It is also a member of the World Council of Churches and the Conference of European Churches and part of the Porvoo Communion. The church was originally established in 1922. During the Second World War, when Latvia was occupied and incorporated into the Soviet Union, the archbishop and half of the clergy went to exile. In 2014 it was announced that Lauma Lagzdi\u0146\u0161 Zu\u0161evics, an American, was the first woman elected Archbishop of the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad. In 2016, the church established itself within Latvia, and Archbishop Zu\u0161evics stated that it would have to change its name accordingly. Later that year the Evangelical Cross Congregation of Liep\u0101ja left the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia (LELB/ELCL) and joined the LELBA/LELCA instead due to its support for the ordination of women which the LELB/ELCL had banned the previous week. The split between the two churches thus became less geographic and more theological. ==References== == External links == * *World Council of Churches listing *Lutheran World Federation listing Category:Lutheran denominations Category:Latvia stubs Category:Stub-Class Lutheranism articles Category:Lutheran World Federation members ",
