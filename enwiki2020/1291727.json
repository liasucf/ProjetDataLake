    "text": "Booty Call is a 1997 American comedy film, written by J. Stanford Parker (credited as Bootsie) and Takashi Bufford, and directed by Jeff Pollack. The film stars Jamie Foxx, Tommy Davidson, Vivica A. Fox, and Tamala Jones. ==Plot== Booty Call is about a tender-hearted, upwardly-mobile man named Rushon who has been dating his girlfriend Nikki for seven weeks. They really like each other, but their relationship has not yet been consummated; Nikki is not so sure if their relationship is ready for the next stage. Rushon asks Nikki out to dinner, but Nikki wants it to be a double date. She brings her opinionated friend Lysterine \"Lysti\", and Rushon comes with his \"bad boy\" buddy Bunz. Lysti and Bunz hit it off very quickly, and to Rushon's surprise, Nikki decides it is time for their relationship to move to the next level. However, they have one small problem: this is the 1990s, and everyone wants to practice \"safe sex.\" Therefore, Rushon and Bunz must go on wild adventures trying to find \"protection\" before the evening's mood evaporates. ==Cast== *Jamie Foxx \u2013 Bunz *Tommy Davidson \u2013 Rushon Askins *Vivica A. Fox \u2013 Lysterine *Tamala Jones \u2013 Nikki *Amy Monique Waddell \u2013 Arguing Woman *Art Malik \u2013 Akmed *Bernie Mac \u2013 Judge Peabody *David Hemblen \u2013 Dr. Blade *Amanda Tapping \u2013 Dr. Moore *Gedde Watanabe \u2013 Chan *Karen Robinson \u2013 Admitting Nurse *Ric Young \u2013 Mr. Chiu *Scott LaRose \u2013 Singh ==Production== The original script was heavily rewritten by director Jeff Pollack and Tommy Davidson. Prior to the film's release, it was noted that there were similarities with its condom plot to another film in development, Trojan War, which featured an all-white cast and which would also be released in 1997. Booty Call however was written without knowledge of Trojan War's existence. ==Soundtrack== ==Reception== It currently holds a 25% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 professional reviews, and a 5.4 user rating on IMDb. Siskel and Ebert gave the film two thumbs up. They praised the vulgar humor, comparing it to Beavis and Butt-head. Ebert in particular said the scenes involving Nikki's pet Jack Russell Terrier were \"very, very funny.\" In their review, The New York Times claimed \"This contemporary sex farce, directed by Jeff Pollack, has the attention span of a hyperactive child.\" In a 1997 interview with Charlie Rose, black actor and filmmaker Charles S. Dutton criticized young African-Americans who went to see Booty Call rather than the historical drama Rosewood, which was released around the same time.https://charlierose.com/guests/4620 ==References== ==External links== * * * *Booty Call (soundtrack) at Discogs Category:1997 films Category:1997 romantic comedy films Category:1990s sex comedy films Category:African-American comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American sex comedy films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:African-American films Category:Films scored by Robert Folk Category:1997 comedy films ",
