Since opening in 1971, North Regional Library at 1315 Lowry Ave. N. in Minneapolis serves a diverse metropolitan community, Near North, Minneapolis. ==Previous Northside Libraries, 1893\u20131977== The first stand alone library branch built by Minneapolis Public Library was Minneapolis Public Library, North Branch. It served the community from 1893-1977. Along with Minneapolis Public Library, North Branch, other neighborhood libraries housed in schools such as Jordan, were closed after North Regional Library opened. ==North Regional Library's beginnings== First proposed as an addition to the City of Minneapolis Library system in 1964, the Library Board decided it was time to build a library in North Minneapolis, which at that time included some of the poorest households in the city. After selecting the block on Lowry Avenue between Fremont and Girard Avenues, Minneapolis architectural firm Miller Dunwiddie was engaged to draw up the plans.Foster Dunwiddie Papers, Finding Aid, Northwest Architectural Archives, University of Minnesota, http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/naa142.xml In anticipation of the grand opening on October 24, 1971, 25,000 leaflets were sent out to the residents in the neighborhood, inviting them to visit their new library. Minneapolis Public Library director Ernest Gaines envisioned a citywide system of regional libraries like North Regional, a south regional library was planned but no others were built.

The Emerson Room housed the New England literature collection of 500 books donated by J. Harold Kittleson. It was decorated like the interior of a New England home of the 19th century. These include first editions by authors including Emily Dickinson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Robert Lowell, Henry David Thoreau, and John Greenleaf Whittier. The 19th Century Collection is now at Minneapolis Central, Special Collections.

With a pressing need to make the building fully accessible and more welcoming, update technology access and make it more economical to manage, the city put out bids for much-needed updates.Ryan, Amy; Biddle, Nina; Wakal, Alex; and Nelson, Pam, \u201cOutlook Twenty Ten: An Update,\u201d Fall 2003, Minneapolis Public Library, Community Libraries Capital Projects, http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/www/groups/public/@council/documents/webcontent/convert_283689.pdf Considerable thought went into assessing and understanding patrons needs: for over a year, the library leaders met with the neighborhood\u2019s advisory committee to agree on what the new space should look like and how it should function. Considerations included the height of the shelving and the interior lighting.Lighting Matters, \u201cNorth Regional Library,\u201d http://www.lighting- matters.com/PortLib1XL.html Renovations of the 32,600 square foot space were designed by KKE Architects and totaled $4,567,083, with $2.583 million sourced from voter referendum funding, $1.6 million from the City of Minneapolis\u2019 Capital Improvement Program.Quist, Susan, \u201cNew North Library Shines, February 1, 2007, Camden Community News, http://www.camdenews.org/news/info.nsf/get+CCN+Article+All/News_New+North+Library+shines Additional dollars were provided by the State of Minnesota Department of Education (for an accessibility grant) and from the surrounding Cleveland, Jordan and McKinley neighborhoods, which contributed $32,500.
