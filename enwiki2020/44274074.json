    "text": "Nicosia skyline just after sunset This list ranks all buildings in Cyprus standing at least tall. Cyprus is going through a major construction boom phase, that first began in late 2013, when legislation was passed encouraging construction. Ever since, hundreds of new housing units and mushrooming businesses, are introduced to the Cypriot community each year. Currently, they are 29 buildings under construction, that will stand taller than 50m upon completion, including 'One' high-rise residential building, where once completed, it will be Cyprus' tallest tower and Europe's tallest seafront residential building. == Tallest buildings == This list of tallest buildings in Cyprus ranks buildings in Cyprus by height. {| class=\"wikitable\" | align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#87CEFA\" |bold* | Denotes building that is or was the tallest at the time |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- style=\"text-align: center; color: navy;\" !Rank !
