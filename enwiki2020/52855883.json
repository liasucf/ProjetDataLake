    "text": "Ritual is an album by Argentine pianist, vocalist and composer Fernando Otero, recorded in 2015 and released on the RYCY Productions label. Ritual brings a collection of new compositions for Orchestra, Voices Chamber Ensembles and Solo Piano. The composer appeared to be working more towards the production of formal classical works which display a significant grounding in the Argentine lyricism\u2013usually associated with Tango\u2013plus elements of classical music and piano improvisation. This work features vocal and violin lines, full orchestra textures and Otero\u2019s pianism. The album emphasizes melodic and slow tempos and the bandoneon is present in two of the pieces, driving the listener into an Argentine atmosphere, both timbrical and melodic. ==Reception== Otero received two Latin Grammy nominations for Ritual, as \"Best Classical Album\" and \"Best Contemporary Classical Composition\", for his composition entitled Conexion. ==Track listing== All compositions by Fernando Otero # Overture # Ceremonia # Siderata # Fortuna # Gardenia # Cielo Del Suburbio # Conexion # Memoire # Primeras Luces # Epilogo ==Personnel== *aMBe (Maria Brodskaya) - vocals * Nick Danielson - violin *Adam Fisher - violincello *Patricio Villarejo - violincello * Brian Forbes - classical guitar *Ivan Barenboim - soprano, bass, contra-alto clarinet * Pablo Aslan - double bass *Bandoneon: Hector Del Curto - bandoneon *Fernando Otero - Piano *The New York State Symphony Orchestra *Brian Forbes - mixing, engineer (at The Gallery Recording Studio) *Max Ross - engineer (at Systems Two Studio) *Manuel Valdivia - engineer (at La Casa Post) *Jim Brick - mastering (at Absolute Audio) *Gonzalo Pujal Laplagne - cover design *Luciano Antinori - cover artwork (from the \u201cHumus Cantropus\u201d series) ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Classical albums by Argentine artists Category:Argentine music ",
