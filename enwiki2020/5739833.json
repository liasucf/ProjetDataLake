    "text": "Addison Byron Owen Randall (May 12, 1906 \u2013 July 16, 1945) was an American film actor, chiefly in Westerns. He often used a pseudonym for his film work, chiefly Jack Randall, though he played roles as Allen Byron and Byron Vance too. ==Early life== The reference book Who's Who in Hollywood gives Randall's place of birth as Quincy, Illinois. ==Film career== Randall began his career as a supporting actor and foil at RKO, but he left when Monogram Pictures promised him the chance to star in films. They were true to their word, and he appeared in a series of Western films through the 1930s and 1940s. (In 1935, he actually played a star of Westerns in RKO's Another Face, released in 1935.) Many of Randall's early B-movies with Monogram feature him as a singing cowboy, but his later roles were generally straight Western stories, and all were hampered by the low budgets typical of that studio. Many of his cowboy characters were named \"Jack\". Randall adopted his new \"Allen Byron\" identity in the 1940s in an effort to boost his fading professional fortunes, but the roles he received with new studio Producers Releasing Corporation were not up to the task. He died unexpectedly in 1945 while filming a serial called The Royal Mounted Rides Again for Universal Studios, after a fall from a horse at Canoga Park, California, in which he struck a tree.Associated Press, \"Cowboy Actor - Husband Of Barbara Bennett Killed\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Tuesday 17 July 1945, Volume 51, page 1. Some sources attribute his death to injuries sustained during the fall, which in those versions resulted from an attempt to recover a hat he had dropped, while others state that he suffered a fatal heart attack before falling.\"Addison Randall\", Allmovie reprinted in the New York Times online, accessed June 27, 2006. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, in the Garden of Memory, near his older brother, Robert Livingston.b-westerns.comCelebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries ==Personal life== Addison Randall was born May 12, 1906, in San Fernando, California, and attended Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri. His older brother Robert Livingston (born Robert Edward Randall) was also an actor in Western films of the time. Addison Randall twice married and divorced actress Louise Stanley, and carried on a notorious affair with silent film actress Louise Brooks. At the time of his death he was married to a second wife, actress Barbara Bennett, the lesser-known sister of actresses Constance Bennett and Joan Bennett, as well as the daughter of actor Richard Bennett and actress Adrienne Morrison. ==Partial filmography== * His Family Tree (1935) as Mike Donovan * Another Face (1935) as Tex Williams * Two in the Dark (1936) as Duke Reed * Love on a Bet (1936) as Jackson * Mariners of the Sky (1936) aka Navy Born as Lt.
