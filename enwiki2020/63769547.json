    "text": "Edmund Tudor, Duke of Somerset (21 February 1499 \u2013 19 June 1500) was an English prince, and the sixth child of King Henry VII of England and his wife, Elizabeth of York. He was styled from birth Duke of Somerset, but never formally created a peer. == Early life == Edmund Tudor was born on 21 February 1499, at Greenwich Palace, Kent. He was baptised in the Church of the Observant Friars on 24 February 1499.Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy (London, U.K.: The Bodley Head, 1999), page 152 The festivities for the christening were considered very splendid.Elizabeth of York: A Tudor Queen and Her World, Alison Weir, (New York: Balentine Books, 2013), p. 361. The child was named Edmund after his paternal grandfather, Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, father of King Henry VII.Stephen, Leslie. Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 36 pp. 397\u2013400 MacMillan: London, 1893 His godparents were his paternal grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Richard Foxe. Lady Margaret Beaufort gave the child a gift of \u00a3100 and rewarded the midwife and nurses.The Life and Death of Edmund Tudor, Duke of Somerset, The Freelance History Writer, Retrieved 25/04 2020 Edmund spent some time in the royal nursery of Eltham Palace with his elder sisters Margaret and Mary and his brother the Duke of York (afterwards King Henry VIII). The eldest sibling, Arthur, did not reside in the nursery with his siblings, as he had his own household. Edmund was present with his elder siblings Margaret, Mary and Henry when Erasmus and Thomas More visited the royal nursery at Eltham Palace in September 1499. The seven-month-old Edmund was held in the arms of his nurse during the visit.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh (editor). Burke's Guide to the Royal Family, Burke's Peerage, London, 1973, p. 204. == Duke of Somerset == Edmund is said to have been created Duke of Somerset, but no enrolment of a patent of such creation is to be found. It seems likely that, although he may have been styled Duke of Somerset, he died before he was so created. His elder brother Henry, afterwards King Henry VIII of England, was not created Duke of York until he was above 3 years of age.G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, editors, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed., 13 volumes in 14 (1910-1959; reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000), volume XII, page 58 == Death == Edmund died on 19 June 1500, at the Old Palace, Hatfield, Herts, at aged 15 months. The cause of Edmund's death is unknown, and he could have died of a number of childhood diseases, however it is known that at the time of his death the plague was rampant. King Henry and Queen Elizabeth had travelled to Calais and stayed for 40 days. The royal children were removed from Eltham Palace to the more remote Hatfield House in Hertfordshire for isolation. On 16 June, as the plague abated, Henry and Elizabeth sailed to Dover. It was either during their return or upon their arrival that they received the news of Edmund's death at Hatfield. == Funeral == Edmund was given a state funeral, and records indicate that the king gave over \u00a3242 for the burial of Edmund.Blood Sisters: The Women Behind the Wars of the Roses, Sarah Gristwood, (New York: Basic Books, 2013), 242. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 22 June 1500. He is buried near his sisters, Elizabeth and, six years later, Katherine Tudor, who also both died young. == References == Category:Dukes of Somerset Category:House of Tudor Category:15th-century English nobility Category:16th-century English nobility Category:1499 births Category:1500 deaths Category:Burials at Westminster Abbey ",
