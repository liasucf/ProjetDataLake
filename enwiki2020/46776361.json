    "text": "All Saints Episcopal Church is a parish of the Episcopal Church located in Moline, Illinois. The parish was initially founded as a parish of the Diocese of Quincy and became part of the Diocese of Chicago following the reunification of the two dioceses. When a large portion of the Quincy diocese decided to leave the Episcopal Church, both Trinity Parish in Rock Island and Christ Church in Moline agreed. In February 2009 members of those two parishes who desired to remain part of the Episcopal Church and wanted to worship on the Illinois side of the Quad Cities formed All Saints. The parish was initially serviced by retired rectors from both parishes and a former deacon of Christ Church. The congregation currently meets at a rental space at Riverside Life Center which was once the Aldersgate Methodist Church. ==See also== * Official website ==References== Category:Episcopal church buildings in Illinois Category:Christian organizations established in 2009 Category:2009 establishments in Illinois ",
