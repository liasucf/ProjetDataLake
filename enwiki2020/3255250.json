    "text": "Colwyn Bay railway station () is on the Crewe to Holyhead North Wales Coast Line. ==History== The station platforms in June 1986 Colwyn Bay station was opened by the Chester and Holyhead Railway in October 1849; originally named Colwyn, it was renamed Colwyn Bay in 1876. The station is in an unusual location straddling a curved section of track. As a result, the track bed is cambered so that trains come to rest at the station platform at a significant tilt. In recent years enforcement action was taken by the Environment Agency when fuel oil spilled from the over-filled tanks of a diesel engine and percolated through the track bed and flowed onto the nearby beach, polluting it. The current station consists of the platform faces that served the former fast lines (the section from here to Llandudno Junction was quadruple track until the 1960s). The platform faces to the slow lines were taken out of service and that on the \"down\" (westbound) side has been obliterated as a result of the construction of the A55 Images of diversion of North Wales Coast Railway at Colwyn Bay to accommodate A55 dual carriageway (along with the old station goods yard). The main station building stands on what was the down island platform. ==Facilities== Ticket barriers are in operation at this station, as are special blue lights in the toilets to stop people abusing intravenous drugs. The station has a footbridge and sheltered seating, along with digital information screens and automatic train announcements on both platforms. Lifts provide full step-free access to each side. The ticket office is staffed all week, from 06:15 until 19:15 on weekdays and from 11:15 to 18:15 on Sundays.Colwyn Bay station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 11 January 2017 ==Services== Mondays to Saturdays: * Transport for Wales operates an alternate hourly service between Holyhead and Birmingham International or Cardiff Central via Wrexham General.
