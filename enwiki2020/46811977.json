Henry Francis Greville (10 August 1760 \u2013 13 January 1816) was a British impresario. ==Early life== He was the son of the Member of Parliament Fulke Greville and the poet Frances Greville. He served in the army from 1777 to 1793 in the Royal Irish Regiment of Dragoon Guards. ==Theatrical career== While in the army he became interested in theatricals, and after leaving the army tried to organize professional theatre shows. His first \"theatrical f\u00eate\" was in 1801, and included supper for his friends, intended to mean a picnic, which he intended as a potluck. Based on the success of this venture, he decided to form a Pic-Nic Society the next year, which lasted only one year, although an unsuccessful attempt was made to revive it the following year.

In January 1803, he began a weekly newspaper, the Pic-Nic, to report theatrical affairs, which he handed over to William Combe in February.\"The Argyll Rooms, Little Argyll Street\" in the Survey of London: Volumes 31 and 32, originally published by London County Council, London, 1963. Online through British History Online. In 1803, he purchased the lease on a mansion on Little Argyll Street from Hylton Jolliffe for \u00a370. After making alterations and adding to it, in 1806 he gave two balls, the first of which was on 2 June and was attended by the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and the Duchess of York. He then borrowed \u00a32000 from the banker Thomas Coutts and purchased the freehold on the house in July. At first he styled the house \"The Fashionable Institution,\" but later changed the name to the Argyll Rooms. In 1807, the Lord Chamberlain granted Greville an annual license to host music, dancing, burlettas, and dramatic performances at the Argyll Rooms. The license was renewed the next year, but afterwards, the license was confined to music and dancing. William Taylor, the manager of the King's Theatre in Haymarket, described the first two seasons as: \"There was no Stage, beyond a small elevation for the Singers to stand upon, and \u2026 no more than four of these were employed in petit pices [sic] of one short Act merely introductory to assemblies and Balls, and \u2026 no Dancers were ever seen, confined alone to subscribers for only 12 nights the first year and but 8 the second and last experiment there, and \u2026 no money was even taken at the doors.\" By 1811, Greville was ill and in deep debt. He tried to sell the Argyll Rooms in 1811.Leanne Langley, \"A Place for Music: John Nash, Regent Street and the Philharmonic Society of London,\" Electronic British Library Journal (2013), 14. He went abroad in 1812, possibly as a condition of his family helping with his debts. He sold the Argyll Rooms to Stephen Slade. He died on 13 January 1816 in Port Louis, Mauritius. ==Personal life== He married Catherine Graham, daughter of Sir Bellingham Graham, in 1793, who died in 1803. He then married Sophia Lambert, the daughter of James Francis Xavier Whyte, in 1805. Among his children was the admiral Henry Francis Greville.William Richard O'Byrne, \"Greville, Henry Francis\" in A Naval Biographical Dictionary, 1849. ==References== Category:English theatre managers and producers Category:English army officers Category:1760 births Category:1816 deaths ",
