He earned a B.A. in English from Grinnell College and an M.A. in Creative Writing from San Francisco State University. He lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife, the writer Heather Mackey, and their two children.http://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/GrinMagFall13.web_.pdf#page=33 In 2011, Faulkner and Lynn Mundell co-founded 100 Word Story, an online literary journal that publishes stories that are exactly 100 words long. Stories published in 100 Word Story have been included on Wigleaf\u2019s Top (Very) Short Fictions list and anthologized in the annual Best Small Fictions series and W.W Norton's New Micro: Exceptionally Short Fiction.http://queensferrypress.com/blog/tag/the-best-small-fictions/ In 2012, he became Executive Director of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), taking over from founder Chris Baty. With more than 500,000 writers signing up to take part in NaNoWriMo\u2019s programs annually, it\u2019s the largest writing event in the world. NaNoWriMo emphasizes that everyone has a story to tell, and that everyone\u2019s story matters. \u201cHumans are naturally wired to tell stories because that\u2019s how we make meaning of the world,\u201d Faulkner said. \u201cSo everyone has a story\u2014or many stories\u2014to tell. Everyone is a creative type by definition.\u201d In 2014, Faulkner co-founded the Flash Fiction Collective, a reading series in San Francisco, with writers Jane Ciabattari and Meg Pokrass. In 2018, Faulkner launched the podcast \"Write-minded: Weekly Inspiration for Writers\" with co- host Brooke Warner of SheWrites.com. == Literary work == Faulkner\u2019s stories and essays have appeared in dozens of publications, including The New York Times, Poets & Writers, Writer\u2019s Digest, The Southwest Review, The Gettysburg Review, Five Points, Green Mountains Review, and Puerto del Sol. His stories have also been anthologized in W.W. Norton\u2019s New Micro: Especially Short Fiction and Best Small Fictions 2016. In 2015, Faulkner released Fissures, a collection of one hundred 100-word stories, published by Press 53. One reviewer wrote, \u201cIn Grant Faulkner\u2019s collection of very short fiction, Fissures [One Hundred 100-Word Stories], Faulkner manages to elevate his language, presenting each word here with the rhetorical weight of a novel and with a poetic aptitude that is anything but self-indulgent. Faulkner has, instead, carefully crafted these stories, and each word comes at the reader as high currency.\u201d The 100-word story form is often likened to prose poetry, which is one thing that drew Faulkner to the form. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked forms that blur,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say that a piece of writing is a prose poem versus a story is just a matter of an author\u2019s intention, an author\u2019s definition.\u201dhttp://blog.superstitionreview.asu.edu/2015/06/06/an-interview- with-grant-faulkner/ In 2018, he co-edited a collection of the best stories published in 100 Word Story, Nothing Short of 100: Selected Tales from 100 Word Story with Lynn Mundell and Beret Olsen.
