    "text": "Luis Eduardo Garz\u00f3n (nicknamed \"Lucho\") (born February 11, 1951 in Bogot\u00e1) is the former Mayor of Bogot\u00e1 (2004\u20132007), a left-wing Colombian political activist and a former union leader. He is a former member of the Alternative Democratic Pole (PDA). In 2009 Garz\u00f3n joined forces with former Mayors Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa and Antanas Mockus to re-found the Green Party, an eco-oriented political movement. ==Political career== ===Presidential Candidate=== Considered by some analysts as an idiosyncratic and charismatic speaker, \"Lucho\" Garz\u00f3n has been one of the most visible critics of President \u00c1lvaro Uribe's government, running against him on a shoe-string budget in the 2002 presidential race and finally making third place with 680,245 votes (6.16% of the voter turnout). Garz\u00f3n has expressed his interest in running once again for the Colombian presidential office in the future, after his first failed attempt. A run in the 2006 elections was ruled out as Garz\u00f3n would have had to resign his post early in 2005 to be considered eligible and at the time of this writing, Antonio Navarro had already been chosen as the Independent Democratic Pole's (PDI) official pre-candidate but Carlos Gaviria became the PDA official candidate. ===Mayor of Bogot\u00e1=== Garz\u00f3n defeated Juan Lozano, the candidate favored by president Uribe and also by influential media groups as El Tiempo in Bogot\u00e1, in the mayoral elections in October 2003. Garz\u00f3n's low budget campaign received a major boost when his candidacy was endorsed by the more leftwing sectors of the Liberal party, in particular those close to then senator Piedad C\u00f3rdoba. During his tenure as mayor, Garz\u00f3n was popular amongst the people of Bogot\u00e1 as reflected in polls, in spite of confronting such difficult issues as the use of public space, the teething problems faced by the TransMilenio mass-transport system, and how to deal with ex-combatants from Colombia's armed conflict who had been settled in Bogot\u00e1 as part of a central government rehabilitation program (eventually, Garz\u00f3n and Uribe jointly decided to change some aspects of the program, after a bomb exploded near one of the shelters for former irregular fighters). In the meantime, despite several disagreements, Garz\u00f3n has managed to achieve a degree of cohabitation with the central government, cooperating on several local issues without compromising his own principles. For supporters and opponents alike, one of the most striking feature of Lucho's administration so far has been its emphasis on social programs such as Bogot\u00e1 sin hambre (\"Bogot\u00e1 without hunger\") and Bogot\u00e1 sin indiferencia (\"Bogot\u00e1 without indifference\"), and in general his general efforts to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants of Bogot\u00e1's most deprived areas, as well as increasing their involvement in decision making at the level of local government. Towards the end of 2005, Garz\u00f3n has had a recent conflict with his own party, the PDA, in Bogot\u00e1's city council due to his support for a proposed increase in the city's \"valorization tax\", in order to finance existing and future infrastructure and development projects. Most PDA and Radical Change councilmen oppose this measure as contrary to Garz\u00f3n's \"no new taxes\" campaign pledge, while Garz\u00f3n himself and councilmen affiliated with former mayor Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa consider it necessary. The tax was approved during a September 29 city council vote, by a margin of four votes (24 against 20). ==External links== *Rumbo a las elecciones Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Bogot\u00e1 Category:Free University of Colombia alumni Category:Green Alliance (Colombia) politicians Category:Independent Democratic Pole politicians Category:Politicians from Bogot\u00e1 ",
