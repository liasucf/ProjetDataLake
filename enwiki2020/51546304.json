It is located in the far northwestern corner of the county, in Adair Township, just south of the Lake of the Ozarks.Plat Book of Camden County, Missouri (1930)Missouri. Bureau of Labor Statistics Surplus Products of Missouri Counties, p. 316 (1909) (Sagrada included on list of \"cities, towns and villages\" in Camden County) ==History== A post office called Sagrada was established in 1886, and remained in operation until 1933.Missouri State Gazetteer and Business Directory for 1893-1894, p. 836-37 (1893) The source of the name Sagrada is obscure. Before completion of the Lake of the Ozarks in 1931, an Osage River crossing north of the post office was known as Sagrada Bridge, a swinging bridge built around 1908. On the north shore of the lake today (in Benton County) is a lake development known as Sagrada Beach.Sagrada Bridge, Bridgehunter.com, Retrieved 28 September 2020 One perhaps over- extensive list of communities flooded by the building of the lake (such as Linn Creek) includes Sagrada. However, while land along the river was inundated and the bridge had to be removed, the rural community was not flooded out of existence.Gillespie, Michael (1 November 2011).
