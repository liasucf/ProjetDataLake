General Samovar's daughter Nadine is engaged to Nikolas Kromeski but is actually in love with Jacques Baccarel, an artist the General hates because of Jacques's avant-garde notions about painting. The General is unaware that Baccarel had once painted his wife Nichette and called the picture \"The Beauty Spot\". Samovar is also unaware that his nephew Nikolas Kromeski, a Dutch coffee planter, has returned from Borneo and has brought his wife Pomare, a native girl from Borneo, with him. Baccarel and Kromeski swap disguises, and the disguised Baccarel masquerading as Kromeski persuades Samovar to buy \"The Beauty Spot\" after some more clothing has been painted on the model. In the end Samovar is reconciled to Baccarel and his daughter Nadine marrying.The Beauty Spot - The Guide to Musical Theatre The critic from The New York Times wrote: > \"It is one of those aimless combinations of hurrah and hosiery that usually > sprout with the Spring and continue to tra la when the days grow longer and > hotter.

The only problem is that the guide book is a fraud; Bramble has never visited Baluchistan and the book was actually written by a dead friend. Bramble's wife Josephine persuades him to write a book of his own. Bramble confides his secret to the journalist Paul Prince, and asks him to be a ghostwriter for his new book. However, the son of the dead friend arrives on the scene disguised as Schamyl from Baluchistan together with his lady-friend, Kadouja. Schamyl sees an opportunity for blackmail but before he can put his scheme into action falls in love with Bramble's daughter, Leonie, much to the annoyance of her fianc\u00e9, Benjy Cardigan. Cardigan suspects that Schamyl is a fraud and arranges a pageant of wild folkdancers from Baluchistan which exposes the fraudsters. ===Cast=== *Arthur Whitby - Napoleon Bramble *Maisie Gay - Josephine Bramble *Tom Walls - Paul Prince *Claude Cameron - Schamyl *Regine Flory - Kadouja *Moya Mannering - Leonie Bramble *Douglas McLaren - Benjy Cardigan *Jan Oyra - The Spirit of Hashish *Peggy Kurton, Jean Cadell, Evelyn Laye ===Songs=== *Give Me the Frocks *I Wish I was a Dog *The Flower That Never Dies *The Kiss You're Going to Get *Season *(Interpolated: Poor Butterfly) ==References== Category:1907 compositions Category:1909 musicals Category:Original musicals Category:American musicals Category:Broadway musicals Category:1917 musicals Category:1917 compositions Category:British musicals ",
