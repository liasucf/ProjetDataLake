She was the host of Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez from 1982 to 1988. ==Career== Mayra Cristina G\u00f3mez Mart\u00ednez Kemp Febles was born the 14th of February, 1948 in Havana, Cuba. She is the daughter of two famous Cuban artists, Ramiro G\u00f3mez Kemp and Velia Mart\u00ednez. She has an older sister named Georgina, who is an accountant in Miami. On the first of February, 1960, her family moved to Puerto Rico, later moving to Venezuela and finally settling in Miami. In 1967, as a college student she appeared in the B-movie The Death Curse of Tartu, under the stage name Mayra Christine. In the 1970s, Mayra went to Spain to perform in the Spanish theatrical production of The Rocky Horror Show. On stage, she worked alongside Argentine actor Alberto Berco who played the role of the narrator, who in time became her husband. In 1976, when the successful Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola game show Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez returned to television to be broadcast in color for the first time, Mayra auditioned for the role of one of the secretaries on the program. Although she wasn't selected as a secretary, she was hired to perform small roles as a comic actress on the show and Mayra's appearances made her famous by the time she left the show in 1977. That year, Mayra teamed with two of the show's former secretaries, Mar\u00eda Dur\u00e1n and Beatriz Escudero, to form the pop vocal band Tr\u00edo Acuario (Aquarius Trio because that was the zodiac sign of all three women). With Mayra as lead vocalist, they enjoyed a brief but intense popularity thanks to their vocal skills and their charmingly sexy image, scoring a summer hit with Rema, Rema, Marinero (\"Row, Row, Sailor\"). Mayra left the group in 1978 to pursue a solo career, recording the album Una Dama (One Lady), which included her cover of Julio Ramos's anti-abortion pop hit \"No Te Dejan Nacer\" (\"They Won't Let You Be Born\"). She began her career as a television presenter on Television Espa\u00f1ola programs such as 625 Lineas (her debut as presenter and first TP de Oro out of four as best presenter) and Ding Dong. Mayra also returned to film in 1978 with Donde Hay Patr\u00f3n..., starring alongside Manolo Escobar. After becoming a Spanish citizen, Mayra turned to radio as one of the original announcers on the new station Antena 3 (now defunct). Along with other presenters she appeared on the children's show Sabadabada, later titled Dabadabada. She left Dabadabada in 1982 when she was chosen by Chicho Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Serrador as a substitute for Kiko Ledgard, the famous host of Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez, who had suffered a near-fatal accident. Mayra won the audience over and remained with the program for six years, longer than any other host, earning three more TP awards for best host. After leaving the show in 1988, she continued working on radio and hosted the chat show Tres mas Una on regional station Canal Sur. With the launch of commercial television in Spain in 1989, Mayra returned to television and hosted La Ruleta de la Fortuna, Spain's version of Wheel of Fortune on Antena 3 TV, until 1991. On the same channel, she fronted the talk show Simplemente Mayra. After La Ruleta de la Fortuna, she hosted the regional show Luna de miel in 1992. Since then, Mayra's television appearances slowed, appearing on the occasional regional show. In 1996, she hosted the medical program El ritmo de la vida on Madrid-based Canal 7. She last hosted a show in 1999 for the cookery-based game show Tomates y Pimientos (Antena 3 TV). She has appeared sporadically as a talk show guest on various programs, and has given numerous interviews. She has made contributions to Menta y Chocolate (Antena 3 TV), Salsa Rosa, Dolce Vita, A Tu Lado and TNT (Telecinco). At the end of 2006, she appeared on the second season of the stand-up contest show El Club de Flo (LaSexta), winning second place. In 2007, she briefly appeared on the show A 3 Bandas (Antena 3 TV). In 2008 she appeared regularly as a guest on the morning talk-show Sin ir m\u00e1s lejos (Arag\u00f3n TV). In October 2009, she revealed that in January of the same year she had been diagnosed with tongue cancer, for which she had surgery. While not resulting in any threat to her life, it affected her speech, making it initially impossible for her to talk. Over the course of a year, with the help of speech therapists and specialists, she completely regained her ability to speak, albeit with a slightly affected pronunciation as an aftereffect of the operation. In 2010, she began making appearances on shows on Telecinco such as S\u00e1lvame Deluxe to talk about her successful recovery from her illness. However, on February 11, 2012, she revealed on La noria that the cancer had returned, this time in her throat. On July 13, she officially announced on S\u00e1lvame Deluxe that she was cancer-free. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Title !
