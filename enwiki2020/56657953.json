In 1987, she moved to Great Ormond Street Hospital's Institute of Child Health due to the expertise of its staff in growth analysis. A summary of the study's findings published in 1999. Her work provided the foundation of contemporary medical understanding of abnormal chromosomes. ==Personal life== Ratcliffe and her husband had two children; she and her husband divorced in 1974.
