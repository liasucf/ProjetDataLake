It is located approximately 8 km SSW of the town of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pesqueira. Although small in size (the area of the parish is 21.55 km\u00b2 and there were 540 inhabitants in 2011), the village possesses a church with some notable frescoes,Trev\u00f5es - Hist\u00f3ria e Patrim\u00f3nio, available from Parish website and two museums, one devoted to artefacts of the village and surrounding countryside, and the other to religious art; there are also many ancient houses in its historic centre. The philosopher Jos\u00e9 Maria da Cunha Seixas was born in the village. The village had its own town council from 1159 to the middle of the 19th century, and by the end of that time many of the parishes that now fall into the municipality of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pesqueira were governed from Trev\u00f5es. The GR 14 long-distance footpath passes through the village. ==References== ==External links== *Parish website: Category:Parishes of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pesqueira Category:Villages in Portugal ",
