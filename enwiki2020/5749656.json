    "text": "\"The Queen of Hearts\" is a song by Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog, released as a single in 1998 to promote the compilation album That's Me. The song was not a brand new recording (Agnetha withdrew from public view in 1988) but a demo that was recorded in 1981. The single peaked at #53 in the Swedish Singles Chart. The original version of this song was in Swedish and was called \"N\u00e4r du tar mig i din famn\" (When You Take Me in Your Arms), which Agnetha recorded in 1979 for inclusion on the compilation album Tio \u00e5r med Agnetha, the album that wrapped up her solo career with what was then CBS Cupol. \"The Queen of Hearts\" was therefore licensed from Sony Music Entertainment Sweden, which had since acquired Cupol, for the 1998 single release by Polar Music. The promo single release included only the single track. One commercial release also included the song \"Eyes of a Woman\" from the 1985 album of the same name, and another single release included those two tracks as well as the songs \"One Way Love\" and \"I Won't Let You Go,\" also from the album Eyes of a Woman. Getty Kaspers, former lead vocalist of the Dutch band and fellow Eurovision winners Teach-In, recorded a version of the song in Dutch, titled \"De Eerste Liefde Is Een Feest\" (The first love is a feast). ==References== Category:1998 singles Category:Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog songs Category:Songs written by Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog Category:Songs with lyrics by Ingela Forsman Category:1979 songs Category:Polar Music singles ",
