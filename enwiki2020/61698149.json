S. Saravanan, who had worked with various directors including Kothanda Ramaiah and Vikraman, made his directorial debut with Don Chera under the banner of Sivasankaralaya. Ranjith was selected to play the title role while Sujibala was chosen to play his love interest. Sivamanoharan took in charge of cinematography while newcomer Prince G. who worked with Harris Jayaraj as his keyboard player had taken care of the music and editing was done by R. T. Annadurai. Speaking about the film, the director said, \"It is a movie certainly different from other films on gangsters. Not just the story and the script, but the making itself would be totally different from other films. The whole cast and crew have given their best\". ==Soundtrack== The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Prince G.. The soundtrack features 5 tracks. ==Release== Initially, the film had its release date fixed on 26 May 2006, but it was postponed to 2 June 2006 to avoid a clash with Selvaraghavan's gangster film Pudhupettai (2006). Balaji Balasubramaniam of bbthots.com called it a \"weak remake of Sanjay Dutt's Vaastav\" and wrote, \"Ranjith overacts almost throughout [..] Susi Bala is introduced pretty late but is adequate in the few scenes where she is required to emote. Ilavarasu plays a villain for a change and manages to utter a few comments in his trademark style without letting his character lose its evil nature\". Indiaglitz said, \"From start to finish, this gangster movie has ripped off some scene from every other gangster movie. So there is little novelty ore novelty. The director's other major failing, it would seem, is in not wresting compelling performances from his cast. Leading with Ranjith, everyone hams outrageously and the film is left adrift for lack of feel\". Another reviewer praised Ranjith's acting and gave the film a mixed review. ==References== Category:2006 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Films set in Chennai Category:Films shot in Chennai Category:Films about organised crime in India Category:Indian gangster films Category:Indian crime action films Category:Indian crime drama films Category:Films featuring an item number Category:2006 directorial debut films Category:2000s crime action films Category:2006 crime drama films ",
