She was one of the original members and honorary secretary of the Dublin Verse-Speaking Society, founded in December 1939 by Austin Clarke and Robert Farren. Boylan gave poetry recitals at the Abbey and Peacock theatres, as well as appearing on the Monday night poetry show, Poetry Anthology, on Radio \u00c9ireann for 25 years. She met Henry Boylan in Radio \u00c9ireann in 1941, and they married on 18 September 1941 in Dublin. They had two daughters, Anna and Catherine, and two sons, Hugo and Peter. She worked as an editorial assistant for Woman's Life, ghost writing an agony aunt column and managing beauty pageants. Boylan was a regular contributor on talk shows and Radio \u00c9ireann productions from the 1940s onwards. She wrote as \"Darina\" for The Irish Press social column, contributed to The Hibernia Magazine, was the editor of Creation, and wrote for The Irish Times, the Irish Press, the Irish Arts Review and Books Ireland.
