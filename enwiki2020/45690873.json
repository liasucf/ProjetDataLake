    "text": "The class MH was a class of diesel-hydraulic locomotives of the Danish State Railways (DSB), built by Danish manufacturer Frichs. A total of 120 units, numbered 301\u2013420, were delivered between 1960 and 1965. They were primarily used for shunting and light freight traffic. Their design was strongly based on that of the slightly earlier MH 201\u2013203 built by Henschel, using the same MAN diesel engine and Voith hydraulic transmission. Apart from a few units damaged in accidents, the locomotives were mostly retired between the late 1980s and 2000. == Notes == == Bibliography == * * * * * == External links == * DSB Litra MH at jernbanen.dk MH Category:Frichs locomotives Category:C locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1960 Category:Diesel locomotives of Denmark Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Denmark ",
