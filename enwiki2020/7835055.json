    "text": "Gastaldi's world map (1548), showing North America and Asia as one continent. Giacomo Gastaldi (c. 1500 in Villafranca Piemonte - October 1566 in Venice) was an Italian cartographer, astronomer and engineer of the 16th century. Gastaldi (sometimes referred to as JacopoTooley, R.V, and Charles Bricker, Landmarks of Mapmaking, (Elsevier-Sequoia, Amsterdam, 1968). or IacoboNordenski\u00f6ld, Adolf Erik, Facsimile-Atlas to the Early History of Cartography, (Dover Publications, New York, Reprint 1973), p. 40.) began his career as an engineer, serving the Venetian Republic in that capacity until the fourth decade of the sixteenth century. From about 1544 he turned his attention entirely to mapmaking, and his work represents several important turning points in cartographic development.Moreland, Carl & David Bannister, Antique Maps - A Collector's Guide, (Phaidon-Christie's, Oxford, 1983), p. 66. Gastaldi's map of New Spain (1548) Gastaldi's map of Moscovia (1550) According to the author Philip Burden, Gastaldi\u2019s 1548 edition of Ptolemy's Geography, \"was the most comprehensive atlas produced between Martin Waldseem\u00fcller's Geographia of 1513, and the Abraham Ortelius Theatrum of 1570,\u201d because it included regional maps of the Americas.Burden, Philip D, The Mapping of North America: A list of printed maps 1511-1670, (Raleigh, England, 1996), p. 16. See also: Nordenski\u00f6ld, Adolf Erik, Facsimile-Atlas to the Early History of Cartography, (Dover Publications, New York, Reprint 1973), p. 28. Yet Gastaldi\u2019s detailed attention to the new world was not his only contribution to the development of map production. The Ptolemy edition of 1548 was also an innovation in that Gastaldi and his publisher reduced the size of the volume, thereby making the first \u2018pocket\u2019 atlas. Finally, Gastaldi\u2019s work also indicated a shift in cartographical technique via its use of the copper engraving. Prior to this period, most maps had been printed from woodcuts; by using a copper plate rather than a woodblock to print, the engraver could render a much higher level of finesse and detail.Burden, Philip D. The Mapping of North America: A list of printed maps 1511-1670, (Raleigh, England, 1996), p. 16. See also Moreland, Carl & David Bannister, Antique Maps - A Collector's Guide, (Phaidon-Christie's, Oxford, 1983), p. 66. Gastaldi was described by one contemporary as the \u2018most excellent Piedmontese cosmographer.' As a cartographer, Gastaldi worked for various publishers, such as Nicolo Bascarini and Giovanbattista Pedrezano.Tooley, R.V, and Charles Bricker, Landmarks of Mapmaking, (Elsevier-Sequoia, Amsterdam, 1968); Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld, Facsimile-Atlas to the Early History of Cartography, (Dover Publications, New York, Reprint 1973), p. 40. But he also occasionally accepted private commissions, for example that from Venice\u2019s Council of Ten, who invited him to fresco maps of Asia and Africa on the walls of a room in the Doge's Palace. Among his other works is the Asiae Nova Descriptio, engraved in copper in 1574. == References == ==External links== * 1564 Map of Africa by Gastaldi at the World Digital Library * Maps by Gastaldi at the Eran Laor Cartographic Collection, the National Library of Israel Category:1500 births Category:1566 deaths Category:Italian cartographers Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:16th-century cartographers Category:16th-century Italian people ",
