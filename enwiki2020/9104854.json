Some Linux- distributions like PCLinuxOS include a graphical frontend for easier script usage. ==Used by== * AmaroK Live CD * Dreamlinux * Mandriva Linux * Ruby on Rails Live CD * Unity Linux Live CD == See also == * Live CD * Software remastering * Remastersys, a similar tool (for Debian/Ubuntu) * List of remastering software ==External links== * mklivecd source code * mklivecd project page (obsolete) Category:Operating system distributions bootable from read-only media Category:Debian-based distributions ",
