In Nolan's Chart, it is possible to identify it as opposed to authoritarianism, resembling the leftist ideology for supporting civil liberties, adopting thoughts such as those of Ayn Rand, Murray Rothbard, and Robert Nozick, but distinguishes itself in what concerns the interference of State in the economy. Likewise, it supports free-market policies, that is, its ideological focus lies in the thoughts of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Ludwig von Mises. As far as economic thinking is concerned, the party has great identification with the Austrian School. The himself Instituto Ludwig von Mises Brasil has articles where he recognizes in the libertarian ideology his ideal. In an interview with Instituto Pais Melhor, Bernardo Santoro, former president of LIBER, defines libertarianism as \"a political philosophy based on the principles of individual sovereignty, non-initiation of aggression and self-ownership. For libertarianism, therefore, man is owner of his body and the result of the mixing of his work with nature, which results in the creation of a legal system strongly based on private property and an economic system based on free market and free interaction between Individuals\". == Registration process == Currently, the party is in the process of collecting signatures that will be delivered to the Superior Electoral Court to reach a minimum of 500,000 signatures.
