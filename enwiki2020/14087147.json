According to a Poets & Writers feature on small presses, Tarpaulin Sky editors are \"intrigued by work that doesn\u2019t announce its genre,\" and they \"enjoy found items, lists, odd constraints and mathematical constructs.\" They are \"happy to read texts that are distinctly un-poetic . . . indices, email, job descriptions, instruction manuals, etc.\"; but, as a caveat, they also offer this: \"We\u2019re looking for work in which experimentation with language and form is a means to an end, rather than an end unto itself; innovation alone doesn\u2019t do much for us.\"\"From Big Game to Tarpaulin Sky: Eight Great and New Literary Start-Ups Looking for You,\" Poets & Writers Volume 35, Issue 5, September/October 2007. The press's books have been described as \"fresh, daring, creepy, and significant.... The opposite of boring....an ominous conflagration devouring the bland terrain of conventional realism, the kind of work that tickles your inner ear, gives you the shivers, and tricks your left brain into thinking that your right brain has staged a coup d'\u00e9tat.\"Review of Nylund, the Sarcographer in Bookslut In November 2007, after thirteen online issues, Tarpaulin Sky Press published the first paper edition of its literary journal, Tarpaulin Sky (established as an online journal in 2002).
