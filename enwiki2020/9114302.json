This office tower had the company name in large letters along the side, lit in blue at the top of the structure. The words Beneficial Life could be seen from quite a distance as the tower had an entirely unimpeded view of the Salt Lake Valley along the main artery known as State Street. During the mid-1980s the Beneficial Life tower achieved notoriety when a rare breeding pair of peregrine falcons decided to take residence on the company letters on the north side of the building. Around 2006, Beneficial moved to the former Kennecott building on an opposite corner of the same block. Both buildings remained while almost the entirety of the block was torn down, along with neighboring blocks of downtown Salt Lake City, and turned into a new development called the City Creek Center. == References == Category:Deseret Management Corporation Category:Life insurance companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 1905 Category:Financial services companies established in 1905 Category:Financial services companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Salt Lake City Category:1905 establishments in Utah ",
