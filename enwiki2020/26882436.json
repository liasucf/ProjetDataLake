On 4 February 1904 he married an actress In\u00e9 de la Garde Cameron, whom he divorced a few years later. In 1905 he founded his own company, touring with The Merchant of Venice.

He maintained a varied program: his company knew most of the Bard's plays and no production was played on consecutive nights. For instance, they performed thirteen plays at His Majesty's Theatre, Perth from April to May 1926. A remarkable feature of their schedule was an annual Christmas season at the Theatre Royal, Hobart at a time when Tasmania was almost universally bypassed by touring companies. A serious setback occurred in June 1926, when the Geelong, Victoria Mechanics' Institutehttp://www.liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/allanwilkie2.html burned down with all his wardrobes and what few props and scenery they carried.

Hector Bolitho was editor for a short time. He was appointed a CBE in May 1925, at the beginning of their season at the Theatre Royal, Brisbane. The honour was in recognition of his services to the theatre and, especially, education.http://www.adelaide.edu.au/library/special/theatre/theatre_bib.html The publicity resulted in an extended season of two months. (Wilkie was adept at extracting benefit for his Company from patronage of the wealthy and famous.) Another lucrative venue was The Majestic, Newtown, where they ran extended seasons in 1928 and 1929. He disbanded his troupe in October 1930Sydney Morning Herald 4 October 1930 at the onset of the Great Depression, (though competition from the \"talkies\" would have contributed, as would the increasing percentage of his audiences who paid the greatly reduced students' admission.

They travelled to New Zealand, Canada and the United States with a low-budget two- hander \"scenes from Shakespeare\" then retired to Scotland. Frediswyde died in 1951 after suffering chronic illness, and he remarried at age 87 and died at 91. He was often criticised for his declamatory style of acting, notably by The Triad which compared him unfavourably to his contemporary Gregan McMahon, but no-one ever doubted his sincerity and energy. \"He travelled further and laboured harder to bring classic theatre to Australian audiences ... Without Wilkie, Australian theatre during World War I and after would have been the poorer.\" (John West, op cit.) ==Legacy== Among Wilkie players who went on to achieve later success were Frank Clewlow, Lorna Forbes, Marie Ney, Augustus Neville, Leslie Manners, John CairnsThe Argus 29 October 1928 and Ellis Irving. The renowned writer Ngaio Marsh acted with his troupe for a time, and remained a friend and correspondent. The actor/manager John Alden has been described as \"a latter-day Wilkie\". The Allan Wilkie \u2013 Frediswyde Hunter-Watts Theatre Collection in the Barr Smith Library of the University of Adelaide (donated by Angel Symon) is named for them. Though much younger, Angel was a longtime friend and correspondent, and spent some years as his advance publicity agent. His third wife, Kate, donated his extensive personal archives to the same library. Allan and Frediswyde's son Douglas was a noted print journalist and commentator. ==Bibliography== The National Library of Australia carries an unpublished manuscript All the world my stage : a biography of the actor \u2013 manager, Allan Wilkie, C.B.E., whose exploits made him a legend in Australia for broadcast, as told to John Marlborough East with a foreword by Ngaio Marsh. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1970 deaths Category:English male stage actors Category:Australian male stage actors Category:Australian theatre directors Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ",
