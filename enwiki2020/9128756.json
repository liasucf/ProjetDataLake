Buses from Kumbakonam, Nannilam, Kodavasal pass through Paruthiyur Village. ==Local legend== Due to the poisonous flames of Raghu, Surya, the Sun God had once lost His facial beauty. It occurred on a solar eclipse day. The Sun God prayed to Lord Siva from this place and regained His charm and brightness. 'Sun' in Tamil is called Parithi. As Parithi Worshipped here, this place came to be called Paruthiyur. In colloquial usage it has become Paruthiyur. Category:Villages in Tiruvarur district ",
