    "text": "The physical constant (pronounced as \"epsilon nought\" or \"epsilon zero\"), commonly called the vacuum permittivity, permittivity of free space or electric constant or the distributed capacitance of the vacuum, is an ideal, (baseline) physical constant, which is the value of the absolute dielectric permittivity of classical vacuum. Its CODATA value is : (farads per metre), with a relative uncertainty of {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" |- ! Value of \u03b50!! Unit |- | || F\u22c5m\u22121 |- | || e2\u22c5GeV\u22121\u22c5fm\u22121 |} It is the capability of an electric field to permeate a vacuum. This constant relates the units for electric charge to mechanical quantities such as length and force. . For example, the force between two separated electric charges with spherical symmetry (in the vacuum of classical electromagnetism) is given by Coulomb's law: :\\ F_\\text{C} = \\frac{1} {4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q_1 q_2} {r^2} The value of the constant fraction, 1/4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0, is approximately 9 \u00d7 109 N\u22c5m2\u22c5C\u22122, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between their centres. Likewise, \u03b50 appears in Maxwell's equations, which describe the properties of electric and magnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation, and relate them to their sources. ==Value== The value of \u03b50 is defined by the formula The approximate numerical value is found at: This formula determining the exact value of \u03b50 is found in Table 1, p. 637 of : \\varepsilon_0 =\\frac {1}{\\mu_0 c^2} where c is the defined value for the speed of light in classical vacuum in SI units, Quote from NIST: \"The symbol c is the conventional symbol for the speed of light in vacuum. \" See NIST Special Publication 330, p. 18 and \u03bc0 is the parameter that international Standards Organizations call the \"magnetic constant\" (commonly called vacuum permeability or the permeability of free space). Since \u03bc0 has an approximate value 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u22127 H/m,See the last sentence of the NIST definition of ampere. and c has the defined value m\u22c5s\u22121,See the last sentence of the NIST definition of meter. it follows that \u03b50 can be expressed numerically as :\\varepsilon_0 = \\frac{1}{(4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\textrm{N/A}^{2}) (299792458 \\, \\textrm{m/s})^2} = \\frac{625000}{22468879468420441 \\pi} \\, \\textrm{ F/m} \\approx 8.85418781762039 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\textrm{F}{\\cdot}\\textrm{m}^{-1} (or A2\u22c5s4\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5m\u22123 in SI base units, or C2\u22c5N\u22121\u22c5m\u22122 or C\u22c5V\u22121\u22c5m\u22121 using other SI coherent units)..A summary of the definitions of c, \u03bc0 and \u03b50 is provided in the 2006 CODATA Report: CODATA report, pp. 6\u20137 The historical origins of the electric constant \u03b50, and its value, are explained in more detail below. ===Redefinition of the SI units=== The ampere was redefined by defining the elementary charge as an exact number of coulombs as from 20 May 2019, with the effect that the vacuum electric permittivity no longer has an exactly determined value in SI units. The value of the electron charge became a numerically defined quantity, not measured, making \u03bc0 a measured quantity. Consequently, \u03b50 is not exact. As before, it is defined by the equation , and is thus determined by the value of \u03bc0, the magnetic vacuum permeability which in turn is determined by the experimentally determined dimensionless fine-structure constant \u03b1: : \\varepsilon_0 = \\frac {1}{\\mu_0 c^2} = \\frac {e^2}{2\\alpha h c}\\ , with e being the elementary charge, h being the Planck constant, and c being the speed of light in vacuum, each with exactly defined values. The relative uncertainty in the value of \u03b50 is therefore the same as that for the dimensionless fine-structure constant, namely ==Terminology== Historically, the parameter \u03b50 has been known by many different names. The terms \"vacuum permittivity\" or its variants, such as \"permittivity in/of vacuum\", \"permittivity of empty space\", or \"permittivity of free space\"B. E. A. Saleh and M. C. Teich, Fundamentals of Photonics (Wiley, 1991) are widespread. Standards Organizations worldwide now use \"electric constant\" as a uniform term for this quantity, and official standards documents have adopted the term (although they continue to list the older terms as synonyms). In the new SI system, the permittivity of vacuum will not be a constant anymore, but a measured quantity, related to the (measured) dimensionless fine structure constant. Another historical synonym was \"dielectric constant of vacuum\", as \"dielectric constant\" was sometimes used in the past for the absolute permittivity. However, in modern usage \"dielectric constant\" typically refers exclusively to a relative permittivity \u03b5/\u03b50 and even this usage is considered \"obsolete\" by some standards bodies in favor of relative static permittivity. Hence, the term \"dielectric constant of vacuum\" for the electric constant \u03b50 is considered obsolete by most modern authors, although occasional examples of continuing usage can be found. As for notation, the constant can be denoted by either \\varepsilon_0\\, or \\epsilon_0\\,, using either of the common glyphs for the letter epsilon. ==Historical origin of the parameter \u03b50== As indicated above, the parameter \u03b50 is a measurement-system constant. Its presence in the equations now used to define electromagnetic quantities is the result of the so-called \"rationalization\" process described below. But the method of allocating a value to it is a consequence of the result that Maxwell's equations predict that, in free space, electromagnetic waves move with the speed of light. Understanding why \u03b50 has the value it does requires a brief understanding of the history. ===Rationalization of units=== The experiments of Coulomb and others showed that the force F between two equal point-like \"amounts\" of electricity, situated a distance r apart in free space, should be given by a formula that has the form : F = k_{\\text{e}} \\frac{Q^2}{r^2}, where Q is a quantity that represents the amount of electricity present at each of the two points, and ke is the Coulomb constant. If one is starting with no constraints, then the value of ke may be chosen arbitrarily.For an introduction to the subject of choices for independent units, see For each different choice of ke there is a different \"interpretation\" of Q: to avoid confusion, each different \"interpretation\" has to be allocated a distinctive name and symbol. In one of the systems of equations and units agreed in the late 19th century, called the \"centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second electrostatic system of units\" (the cgs esu system), the constant ke was taken equal to 1, and a quantity now called \"gaussian electric charge\" qs was defined by the resulting equation : F = \\frac{{q_{\\text{s}}}^2}{r^2}. The unit of gaussian charge, the statcoulomb, is such that two units, a distance of 1 centimetre apart, repel each other with a force equal to the cgs unit of force, the dyne. Thus the unit of gaussian charge can also be written 1 dyne1/2 cm. \"Gaussian electric charge\" is not the same mathematical quantity as modern (MKS and subsequently the SI) electric charge and is not measured in coulombs. The idea subsequently developed that it would be better, in situations of spherical geometry, to include a factor 4\u03c0 in equations like Coulomb's law, and write it in the form: : F = k'_{\\text{e}} \\frac{{q'_{\\text{s}}}^2}{4 \\pi r^2}. This idea is called \"rationalization\". The quantities qs\u2032 and ke\u2032 are not the same as those in the older convention. Putting generates a unit of electricity of different size, but it still has the same dimensions as the cgs esu system. The next step was to treat the quantity representing \"amount of electricity\" as a fundamental quantity in its own right, denoted by the symbol q, and to write Coulomb's Law in its modern form: :\\ F = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q^2}{r^2}. The system of equations thus generated is known as the rationalized metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second (rmks) equation system, or \"metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second\u2013ampere (mksa)\" equation system. This is the system used to define the SI units. The new quantity q is given the name \"rmks electric charge\", or (nowadays) just \"electric charge\". Clearly, the quantity qs used in the old cgs esu system is related to the new quantity q by :\\ q_{\\text{s}} = \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0}}. ===Determination of a value for \u03b50=== One now adds the requirement that one wants force to be measured in newtons, distance in metres, and charge to be measured in the engineers' practical unit, the coulomb, which is defined as the charge accumulated when a current of 1 ampere flows for one second. This shows that the parameter \u03b50 should be allocated the unit C2\u22c5N\u22121\u22c5m\u22122 (or equivalent units \u2013 in practice \"farads per metre\"). In order to establish the numerical value of \u03b50, one makes use of the fact that if one uses the rationalized forms of Coulomb's law and Amp\u00e8re's force law (and other ideas) to develop Maxwell's equations, then the relationship stated above is found to exist between \u03b50, \u03bc0 and c0. In principle, one has a choice of deciding whether to make the coulomb or the ampere the fundamental unit of electricity and magnetism. The decision was taken internationally to use the ampere. This means that the value of \u03b50 is determined by the values of c0 and \u03bc0, as stated above. For a brief explanation of how the value of \u03bc0 is decided, see the article about \u03bc0. ==Permittivity of real media== By convention, the electric constant \u03b50 appears in the relationship that defines the electric displacement field D in terms of the electric field E and classical electrical polarization density P of the medium. In general, this relationship has the form: : \\mathbf{D} = \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P}. For a linear dielectric, P is assumed to be proportional to E, but a delayed response is permitted and a spatially non-local response, so one has: : \\mathbf D (\\mathbf r , \\ t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^t dt' \\int d^3\\mathbf r' \\ \\varepsilon (\\mathbf r, \\ t ; \\mathbf r' ,\\ t') \\mathbf E(\\mathbf r', \\ t'). In the event that nonlocality and delay of response are not important, the result is: :\\mathbf{D} = \\varepsilon \\mathbf{E} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{r}} \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} where \u03b5 is the permittivity and \u03b5r the relative static permittivity. In the vacuum of classical electromagnetism, the polarization , so and . ==See also== *Casimir effect *Relative permittivity *Coulomb's law *Electromagnetic wave equation *ISO 31-5 *Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field *Sinusoidal plane-wave solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation *Wave impedance ==Notes== Category:Electromagnetism Category:Fundamental constants ",
