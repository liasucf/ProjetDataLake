Biodemography and Social Biology was established in 1916 as Eugenical News. It was published under that title until 1953, during which time it was \"the primary source of eugenic-related events and news in the United States\". It was renamed Eugenics Quarterly in 1954, when it was launched by the American Eugenics Society as a scholarly journal focused on eugenics and related subjects. It was renamed Social Biology in 1969, as a result of the term \"eugenics\" falling out of fashion. It was renamed again to its current title in 2008. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Publications established in 1916 Category:Human biology journals Category:Demography journals Category:Sociobiology Category:Biannual journals Category:Routledge academic journals Category:English-language journals ",
