    "text": "Sujebi (, in S. Korea), tt\u016dd\u014f-guk (, in N. Korea), or hand-pulled dough soup, or Korean-Style Pasta Soup, is a Korean traditional soup consisting of dough flakes roughly torn by hand, with various vegetables. The flavor and recipe resemble kalguksu, except that the latter is made with noodles rather than wheat flakes. It is commonly considered a dish to consume on rainy days, along with bindaetteok. The broth for sujebi is usually made with dried anchovies, shellfish, and kelp. In order to obtain a rich, umami flavor, the ingredients should be simmered for many hours. Added to this broth are soft noodles and various vegetables or kimchi, most often zucchini and potatoes. ==Origin== Korean people began to eat sujebi and guksu (\uad6d\uc218 noodles), both dishes made of wheat flour, from the early Goryeo period (935~1392), but the name sujebi (earlier sujeop-eo) dates from the mid Joseon period. Sujeop-eo is a combined hanja word comprising the terms su (hanja: \u624b; hangul: \uc218; literally \"hand\") and jeop (hanja: \u647a; hangul: \uc811\uc5b4 or \uc811\ub2e4; literally \"folded\" or \"folding\"). From the Joseon period, people started making various types of sujeobi according to various purposes. Sujebi is today considered a typical commoner's food, but in the past, it was relatively rare and used for special occasions especially janchi (\uc794\uce58; feast, banquet) such as dol janchi (the celebration of a baby's first birthday). In North Korea, sujebi is called milgaru ddeudeo guk (\ubc00\uac00\ub8e8\ub728\ub354\uad6d), which is the words comprising three words: milgaru (\ubc00\uac00\ub8e8; literally \"wheat flour\") + ddeudeo (\ub72f\uc5b4; literally \"tearing\" or \"torn\") guk (\uad6d; literally \"soup\"). The names of sujebi vary according to regions in Korea. \uc218\uc81c\ube44\uc758 \uc0ac\ud22c\ub9ac, \ub2e4\ubd80\ub801\uc8fd\uacfc \ub5a0\ub10c\uc8fd \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubc99\uc73c\ub798\uae30 from Ohmynews.com {|class=\"wikitable\" !Region or cities !Name !Korean name |- |North Korea |milgaru ddeudeo guk |\ubc00\uac00\ub8e8\ub728\ub354\uad6d \uc721\uc218\uac00 \uac1c\uc6b4\ud55c \uc218\uc81c\ube44 |- |Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do |ddeudegi or ddedeokguk |\ub728\ub370\uae30 or \ub728\ub355\uad6d |- |Jeollanam-do |ddeoneonjuk or ddiyeonjuk |\ub5a0\ub10c\uc8fd or \ub760\uc5f0\uc8fd |- |Gyeongsangnam-do |sujibi, miljebi, or milkkarijang guk |\uc218\uc9c0\ube44, \ubc00\uc81c\ube44, or \ubc00\uae4c\ub9ac\uc7a5\uad6d |- |Yeocheon and Bongwha |dabureong juk or beongeuraegi |\ub2e4\ubd80\ub801\uc8fd or \ubc99\uc73c\ub798\uae30 |} == Gallery == File:Gamja-ongsimi.jpg|Gamja-ongsimi File:Jaecheop-sujebi.jpg|Jaecheop-sujebi File:Kimchi-sujebi.jpg|Kimchi-sujebi ==See also== *Kalguksu *Bindaetteok *Korean noodles ==References== ==External links== *Brief information and recipe of Spinach and Carrot Sujebi * The Korean people's food, Sujebi from Chosunilbo *Information about \u201cSamcheongdong Sujebi\u201d from Korea Tourism Organization Category:Korean cuisine Category:Anchovy dishes ",
