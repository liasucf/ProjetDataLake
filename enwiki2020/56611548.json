The series included England's first Test match in Saint Lucia, when they played at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground. It was also England's first tour to the West Indies to play all three formats of international cricket since they visited in 2009. The ODI fixtures were part of both teams' preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. The West Indies won the first two Test matches, taking an unassailable lead in the series, and therefore winning the Wisden Trophy. It was their first Test series win against England since 2009. However, the West Indies captain Jason Holder was suspended for the third and final Test of the series, after the team's slow over-rate in the second Test. Kraigg Brathwaite was named as the West Indies' captain for the third Test in Holder's place. The West Indies won the series 2\u20131, after England won the third Test by 232 runs. During the ODI series, multiple individual and team records were broken by both sides. England's captain Eoin Morgan became the first batsman for the England team to score 6,000 runs in ODIs. Chris Gayle became the second batsman for the West Indies, after Brian Lara, to score 10,000 runs in ODIs. The ODI series was drawn 2\u20132, after the third match was washed out, finishing as a no result. For the T20I series, the West Indies retained players that were selected for the ODI matches, with Jason Holder named as the T20I captain in place of their regular T20I captain Carlos Brathwaite. During the second match, the West Indies were bowled out for 45, which was the second-lowest total in T20Is and the lowest by a Full Member nation. England won the T20I series 3\u20130. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=2|Tests !colspan=2|ODIs !colspan=2|T20Is |- ! ! ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Jason Holder (c) * Kraigg Brathwaite * Darren Bravo * Shamarh Brooks * John Campbell * Roston Chase * Shane Dowrich (wk) * Shannon Gabriel * Shimron Hetmyer * Shai Hope (wk) * Alzarri Joseph * Keemo Paul * Kemar Roach * Oshane Thomas * Jomel Warrican | * Joe Root (c) * Jos Buttler (vc) * Moeen Ali * James Anderson * Jonny Bairstow (wk) * Stuart Broad * Rory Burns * Sam Curran * Joe Denly * Ben Foakes (wk) * Keaton Jennings * Jack Leach * Adil Rashid * Ben Stokes * ~~Olly Stone~~ * Chris Woakes * Mark Wood | * Jason Holder (c) * Fabian Allen * Devendra Bishoo * Carlos Brathwaite * Darren Bravo * John Campbell * Sheldon Cottrell * Shannon Gabriel * Chris Gayle * Shimron Hetmyer * Shai Hope * Evin Lewis * Ashley Nurse * Keemo Paul * Nicholas Pooran * Rovman Powell * ~~Kemar Roach~~ * Andre Russell * Oshane Thomas | * Eoin Morgan (c) * Jos Buttler (vc, wk) * Moeen Ali * Jonny Bairstow * Tom Curran * Joe Denly * Alex Hales * Liam Plunkett * Adil Rashid * Joe Root * Jason Roy * Ben Stokes * David Willey * Chris Woakes * Mark Wood | * Jason Holder (c) * Fabian Allen * Devendra Bishoo * Carlos Brathwaite * Darren Bravo * John Campbell * Sheldon Cottrell * Chris Gayle * Shimron Hetmyer * Shai Hope * Obed McCoy * Ashley Nurse * Nicholas Pooran * Oshane Thomas | * Eoin Morgan (c) * ~~Moeen Ali~~ * Jonny Bairstow (wk) * Sam Billings * Sam Curran * Tom Curran * Joe Denly * Alex Hales * Chris Jordan * Dawid Malan * Liam Plunkett * Adil Rashid * Joe Root * David Willey * Mark Wood |} Olly Stone was ruled out of England's Test squad with a back injury, and was replaced in the squad by Mark Wood. Ahead of the second Test, England's Adil Rashid flew home to attend the birth of his second child. Keemo Paul was added to the West Indies' squad for the third Test, after Jason Holder was suspended. Shannon Gabriel was not originally named in the West Indies' ODI squad, but was added to the team after injuries to Rovman Powell and Keemo Paul. However, during the third Test, Gabriel was heard saying a homophobic remark towards England's captain Joe Root. As a result, the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Gabriel for four ODI matches. John Campbell, Carlos Brathwaite and Sheldon Cottrell were added to the West Indies' ODI squad, following injuries to Evin Lewis, Rovman Powell and Keemo Paul, and Shannon Gabriel's suspension. Kemar Roach was ruled out of the West Indies' ODI squad due to injury, and was replaced by Andre Russell for the fourth and fifth ODIs. Sam Curran was added to England's T20I squad, after Moeen Ali announced he would fly home after the last ODI match to rest ahead of the 2019 Indian Premier League. Obed McCoy was added to the West Indies' T20I squad, after Andre Russell was forced to pull out of the side due to injury. ==Tour matches== ===Two-day match: West Indies President's XI vs England=== ===Two-day match: West Indies President's XI vs England=== ===50-over match: UWI Vice Chancellor's XI vs England=== ==Test series== ===1st Test=== ===2nd Test=== ===3rd Test=== ==ODI series== ===1st ODI=== ===2nd ODI=== ===3rd ODI=== ===4th ODI=== ===5th ODI=== ==T20I series== ===1st T20I=== ===2nd T20I=== ===3rd T20I=== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:2019 in English cricket Category:2019 in West Indian cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2018\u201319 Category:English cricket tours of the West Indies ",
