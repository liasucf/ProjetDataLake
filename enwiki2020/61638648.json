Additional tracks from these sessions were released as More Real Folk Blues: The Missing Album in 1991. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Stephen Cook stated: \"Listeners wanting to find a comprehensive collection of Hooker's work may not find it here, but they certainly won't be disappointed once the needle hits the grooves on this solid 1966 Chess release by the blues master.
