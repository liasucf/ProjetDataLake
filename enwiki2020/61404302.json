Cook was the first European navigator to circumnavigate and chart the archipelago. He chose names from dull to droll to descriptive, from metaphorical to a narrative of events, or to honour people and to record the existing Maori language names of places. The list below is in the order described in Cook's journals of his first and second voyages to the Pacific. == First voyage == Young Nicks Head / Te Kuri o P\u0101oa Whakaari - White Island Volcano Mount Taranaki Kapiti Island Cape Koamaru The first voyage was in New Zealand waters during late 1769 and early 1770. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !Name (and today's name) !Date !Reason for naming !Coords !Notes |- |Poverty Bay (T\u016branganui-a-Kiwa / Poverty Bay) |11 October |\u201cbecause it afforded us no one thing we wanted\u201d | | |- |Young Nicks Head / Te Kuri o P\u0101oa |11 October |After the 11-year-old boy who won a gallon of rum for being the first to sight land | | |- |Table Cape (Table Cape / Kahutara Point) |12 October |Shape and flat top | | |- |Isle of Portland (Portland Island) |12 October |\"on account of its very great resemblance to Portland in the English Channel\" | | |- |Cape Kidnapper (Cape Kidnappers / Te Kauwae-a-M\u0101ui) |15 October |For the attempt to kidnap Tupaia's young acolyte, Taiata | | |- |Hawkes Bay |15 October |Sir Edward Hawke | | |- |Cape Turnagain |17 October |Cook sailed Endeavour south to this point, where upon meeting adverse conditions he turned and headed north again | | |- |Gable End Foreland Head |20 October |\"on account of the very great resemblance the white cliff at the very point hath to the Gable end of a House\" | | |- |Tegadoo (Anaura Bay) |22 October |\"hath nothing to recommend it I shall give no discription of it\" | | |- |Tolaga Bay |23 October |The crew mistook the local name for this bay as Tolaga.
