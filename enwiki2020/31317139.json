On 21 October 2011, he signed a three-month loan deal with Hemel Hempstead Town. ===Eastbourne Borough (loan)=== Scowen joined Eastbourne Borough on a six-month loan deal in August 2012, reuniting him with former Hemel Hempstead manager Tommy Widdrington. ===Return to Wycombe=== Scowen was immediately recalled by Wycombe following their appointment of Gareth Ainsworth as new manager.
