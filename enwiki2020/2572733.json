    "text": "You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown is the 14th prime-time animated television special based on the comic strip Peanuts by Charles M. Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on October 28, 1975. In this special, Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peppermint Patty participate in a motocross race. == Plot == The story begins with Snoopy playing tennis against Woodstock while Linus and Sally are unable to play because of the courts being occupied. Sally tries to intimidate those playing by stating \"her boyfriend\" was going to clobber them, causing Linus to flee. After failing to beat Woodstock, Snoopy destroys his racket in frustration. Peppermint Patty arrives on a small motorcycle and alerts the kids about an upcoming motocross race, and suggests that Charlie Brown and Snoopy enter. Linus volunteers to be the pit crew and the two pool their limited financial resources to purchase a shabby old bike. Snoopy enters the race under the pseudonym of The Masked Marvel and Marcie is on hand as the announcer. Charlie Brown and Snoopy crash within minutes of the start of the race, and an ambulance shuttles them off for immediate medical care. In the confusion, Snoopy is admitted to a regular hospital while Charlie Brown ends up at the vet. After regaining consciousness, Charlie Brown escapes from the vet and retrieves Snoopy from the hospital. Upon return, Linus informs Charlie Brown that motocross rules dictate that you must be fitted with a helmet, which was lost in the crash. Linus proceeds to outfit Charlie Brown with a hollowed-out pumpkin as a helmet and Charlie Brown, demoralized with such ridiculous headgear, returns to the race. As the race continues, every other competitor falls victim to various mishaps (particularly assorted mud-traps) leaving Charlie Brown as the only contender left to cross the finish line (his old bike proves to have amazing durability, despite its poor speed). Then he discovers that those who sanctioned the race couldn't obtain the intended grand prize of Pro Bowl tickets. As a consolation prize, Charlie Brown is given a kiss from Loretta and a certificate for five free haircuts which are useless to him since (1) his dad is a barber and (2) Charlie has very little hair to be cut. Linus consoles Charlie Brown by telling him that the fact that he won against overwhelming odds is more important than receiving a prize. In the final scene, a confident Charlie Brown is ready to pitch another baseball game, saying to the team that in spite of his 980 straight defeats, has come to understand what winning is, and is certain that he will win this game. Instead, a line drive plows past him, causing his clothes to go flying in all directions and Charlie Brown looks at us before the film ends. ==Voice cast== *Duncan Watson as Charlie Brown ** Peter Robbins \u2013 Charlie Brown's screaming voice (archived) *Liam Martin as Linus van Pelt *Gail Davis as Sally Brown *Melanie Kohn as Lucy van Pelt/Loretta *Stuart Brotman as Peppermint Patty *Jimmy Ahrens as Marcie *Bill Melendez as Snoopy/Woodstock ==Credits== * Written and Created by: Charles M.

Liner notes for A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2017); Kritzerland, Inc. Retrieved 18 June 2020 The music score for ' was something of a departure from Guaraldi's other scores as the music fused his jazz style with the funk, disco and pop music of the 1970s that was popular at the time coupled with the use of the ARP String Ensemble synthesizer that was used on many pop songs of the era. All music cues were composed by Guaraldi and recorded by the Vince Guaraldi Trio on September 12 and 24, 1975, at Wally Heider Studios, featuring Seward McCain (bass) and Mark Rosengarden (drums). The program's theme song, \"Motocross\" is performed in nine different variations. As the variations are difficult to distinguish, scene descriptions in which they appear are added to help differentiate. #\"Motocross\" (version 1; cold open) #\"Peppermint Patty\" (Linus and Sally tennis) #\"Centercourt\" #\"Fanfare\" #\"Bass Blues\" (alternate rendition of \"Woodstock's Dream\") #\"Football\" (slow version of \"Linus and Lucy\") #\"Motocross\" (version 2; Charlie Brown and Linus purchase motorbike) #\"Motocross\" (version 3; Marcie interviews contestants, Charlie Brown and Snoopy wipe out; aka Cue 9) #\"Great Pumpkin Waltz\" #\"Motocross\" (version 4; Charlie Brown and Snoopy re-enter competition) #\"Lemonade Break\" #\"Motocross\" (version 5; three contestants left) #\"Motocross\" (version 6; Snoopy converts tennis ball launcher into motorbike) #\"Lunch Theme\" #\"Motocross\" (version 7; final lap) #\"Motocross\" (version 8; Charlie Brown's new beginning) #\"Motocross\" (version 9; end credits) No official soundtrack for ' was released. However, recording session master tapes for seven 1970s-era Peanuts television specials scored by Guaraldi were discovered by his son, David Guaraldi, in the mid-2000s. The songs \"Motocross\" (version 3; aka \"Cue 9\") and \"Centercourt\" were released on the compilation album, Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials (2007). A live version of \"Centercourt\" (retitled \"\") appeared on the compilation album Oaxaca in 2004. ==Awards== You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown won Schulz his third Emmy Award for Outstanding Children Special. He previously earned the award for A Charlie Brown Christmas and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. ==References== == External links == * Category:Animated television specials Category:CBS television specials Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Television programs directed by Phil Roman Category:CBS original programming Category:1970s American television specials Category:1975 television specials Category:1975 in American television Category:Motorcycle racing films Category:Sports animation ",
