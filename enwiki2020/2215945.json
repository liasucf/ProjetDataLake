    "text": "75px \u0143 (minuscule: \u0144) is a letter formed by putting an acute accent over the letter N. In the Belarusian \u0141acinka alphabet; the alphabets of Polish, Kashubian, Wymysorys and the Sorbian languages; and the romanization of Khmer, it represents , which is the same as Czech and Slovak \u0148, Serbo-Croatian and Albanian nj, Spanish and Galician \u00f1, Italian and French gn, Hungarian and Catalan ny, and Portuguese nh. In Yoruba, it is used to connect a pronoun to a verb. For example, when using the pronoun I and the verb to eat, it would be, mo \u0144 jeun. It is pronounced with a distinct un sound. In Lule Sami it represents /\u014b/. It is used in the Yale romanisation of Cantonese when the nasal syllable /\u014b\u0329/ has a rising tone. In Kazakh, it was proposed in 2018 to replace the Cyrillic \u04a2 by this Latin alphabet and represents /\u014b/. The replace suggestion has modified to \u014a in the later 2019. ==In Polish== In Polish, it appears directly after n in the alphabet, but no Polish word begins with this letter, because it may not appear before a vowel (the letter may appear only before a consonant or in the word-final position). In the former case, a digraph ni is used to indicate a palatal (or rather alveolo-palatal) n. If the vowel following is i, only one i appears. ===Examples=== * (April) * ha\u0144ba (disgrace) * niebo (sky, heaven) * jedzenie (food) * d\u0142o\u0144 (hand) * S\u0142o\u0144ce (sun) * \u2022ni is the same as \u0144 in Polish == Computer use == HTML characters and Unicode code point numbers: * \u0143: &#323; or &#x143; - U+0143 * \u0144: &#324; or &#x144; - U+0144 In Unicode, \u0143 and \u0144 are located the \"Latin Extended-A\" block. == See also == * Polish alphabet * Polish phonology * Sorbian alphabet * Acute accent ==References== Category:Polish language Category:Latin letters with diacritics Category:Specific Polish letters ",
