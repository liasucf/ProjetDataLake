    "text": "Cerro Tuzgle is a dormant stratovolcano in the Susques Department of Jujuy Province in Argentina. Tuzgle is a prominent volcano of the back-arc of the Andes and lies about east of the main volcanic arc. Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, it is high above sea level and was constructed during different stages over a caldera and lava domes. Some major lava flows emanate from the summit crater, and one confirmed and one possible flank collapse unit as well as an ignimbrite sheet are associated with this volcano. The first volcanic activity of Tuzgle occurred 650,000 years ago and formed the Tuzgle Ignimbrite. Subsequently, lava domes were erupted and three lava flow units were named San Antonio, Azufre, and Tuzgle. The latest lava flows are dated at 17.5 and 1.5 Ma and volcanic activity may have continued into the Holocene. Several thermal springs are associated with the volcano, and some have been investigated for possible geothermal energy production. Sulfur was formerly mined on the mountain. Argentina's National Route 40 runs along the foot of the volcano. == Geology and geography == === Regional setting === Volcanic activity as well as general tectonism in the Central Andes is caused by the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate at a horizontal pace of or forming the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) between latitude 16 and 28\u00b0 south. Starting with activity in the Coastal Cordillera during the Jurassic (La Negra formation), this has caused spatially complex patterns of volcanic activity as well as the formation of the Altiplano-Puna highland with dimensions of . Maximum deformation occurred during the late Miocene, with the formation of tectonic highs and lows. Small andesitic- basaltic volcanic centres of Quaternary age are associated with faulting. Seismic activity is still ongoing at the edge of the Puna, indicating thrusting. The crust beneath the CVZ is thick. A steepening of the subduction zone during the Late Miocene has been linked to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but it is unlikely that the pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24\u00b0 latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna. Several major fault zones run across the Puna in the area, the most important being the Toro lineament to the south of Tuzgle. On this lineament, which has been subject to left-lateral displacement, are aligned several Pleistocene volcanoes, including Cordon Puntas Negras, Rincon, Tul Tul-Del Medio-Pocitos, Quevar, and Tastil (from north to south) (as well as the Negra Muerta volcanic complex). A segment named the Chorrillos fault is located directly south of Tuzgle. The segment of the Toro fault closest to Tuzgle has been active recently. Based on displacements along two monogenetic volcanoes, slip rates of have been estimated. The shoshonitic San Geronimo and Negro de Chorillos scoria cones and lava flows, as well as Antuco hot springs and travertine deposits (), are also linked to the Toro fault zone and thermal waters flowing along it. Volcanic activity in the area occurred during two separate phases, the first one between 17.15 mya and 5.3 mya that generated a large number of volcanic centres, with a much more limited phase of activity since 1.5 mya associated with the Diaguita phase of Andean deformation. === Local setting === Southeast face of Cerro Tuzgle with a conspicuous black latitic lava flow Tuzgle is a dormant stratovolcano in the Susques Department of Jujuy Province in Argentina. It is a prominent back-arc volcanic centre in the Andes located about east of the main volcanic arc. Cerro Tuzgle lies within a geological depression in the Puna bordered by normal faults. The depression dates back to the Ordovician and slopes northward from altitude on the southern side to altitude on the northern side. A low gravity field anomaly is also found in the area. The basement consists of fractured rocks of Precambrian-Ordovician age, known as the Puncoviscana Formation and Faja Eruptiva, respectively, overlain with an impermeable Cretaceous unit named the Pirgua Formation. Volcanism in the area has existed since the Miocene, involving lava domes, ignimbrite eruptions (the 0.6mya Tuzgle ignimbrite) and monogenetic volcanism. Volcanoes located south of Tuzgle are Aguas Calientes, Negro de Chorrillos and San Jeronimo. This region belongs to the back-arc region of the Andes, and the formation of melts is dependent on the melting of a heated mantle, whereas melt generation under the arc proper is dependent on the interaction between fluids and mantle rocks, leading to a reduction in their melting point. There is tomographic evidence that lithospheric delamination is currently underway beneath Tuzgle. The highest unit of the Cerro Tuzgle volcano is the \"Platform\" unit, which covers a surface area of and is capped off by a well-preserved summit crater. It consists of well-preserved blocky lava flows with maximum thicknesses of . These are the youngest stages of Tuzgle volcanism and are well preserved. Radiating away from the central summit of the volcano, another lava flow unit forms the so-called Azufre synthem; these lava flows reach maximum thicknesses of and are gray to brownish-red with some evidence of hydrothermal alteration. On the northwestern and southern flanks, lava emission from one emission area down steep slopes form the San Antonio synthem (unconformity bounded unit), with lava flows up to thick. These San Antonio stage lavas have been cut by a long fault scarp trending NNE-SSW that may have been formed by a mass failure of the Tuzgle edifice, which was then rebuilt by the Azufre stage lavas. On the northern flank is found a volcaniclastic fan with a surface area of , a volume of and thicknesses of , presumably, considering its geochemical composition, formed by a mass failure of the San Antonio stage edifice. The scarp was probably formed by the same event but was not accompanied by explosive activity or a pyroclastic flow. This flank collapse may have been triggered by magma injection. A structure on the southern side of the volcano may also be a collapse scar, but no deposit is identifiable. A weakness zone running east-west cuts across the Tuzgle edifice, and some volcanic features are aligned along this weakness. A wide feeder dyke has been modelled and is associated with this weakness zone. The youngest- and best-exposed lava flow of Cerro Tuzgle originated in a group of three depressions bordered by scoria ridges. These depressions, presumably eruption fissures, are arranged in en echelon order. This youngest lava flow has a structure between block lava and aa lava. In non-volcanic terms patterned ground is found resulting from pre-glacial processes. Tuzgle from National Route 40 Tuzgle is underpinned by a plateau formed by mostly unwelded ignimbrites, while the so-called \"Pre-platform\", \"Platform\", \"Post-platform\" and \"Young Flow\" units make up the central volcano. The moderately crystal- rich ignimbrite has a volume of and is thick, and was presumably emitted from a caldera now buried by the Cerro Tuzgle edifice. Circular lava domes ( thick at a maximum) are found in the southeastern, eastern and northern sector of the volcano and may have formed along ring dykes associated with the caldera. A high electrical conductivity zone beneath Tuzgle may constitute a magma chamber embedded within porous material containing saline fluids with the bottom at a depth of at least and the top at a depth of . Crustal silicic magmas gave rise to ignimbrites from depths of . The magma chamber appears to be placed next to a crustal decollement at . Thermobarometric data also indicate a magma origin depth of . Beneath Tuzgle, a high seismic attenuation plume rises from an earthquake cluster at depth up to the volcano and is probably linked to asthenospheric upwelling. In the ground beneath Tuzgle, seismic tomography has found a thick layer of low velocity, probably linked to a lower density of the rock, at a depth of . Magnetotelluric analysis has found several deep () conductive layers and one shallow one, possibly formed by the aquifers in the area. Another high conductivity body southeast of Tuzgle is associated with the Toro lineament and the Queva volcano and may also be hydrothermal in origin. === Composition and origin === The Tuzgle volcano proper is constructed from an older rhyodacite-mafic series and a more recent series constructed from andesites alone. These and neighbouring shoshonitic centres are formed from magmas with crustal contamination. Isotope analysis of magmatic rocks have shown La/Nb ratios of 1.31.6 and Ba/Ta ratios of 160260, lower than in the main volcanic front. The overall chemical composition is potassium-rich calc-alkaline. Thermobarometry indicates that the older magmas crystallized at pressures of while younger ones crystallized at and temperatures of about . These magma compositions indicate that the magmas are the result of complex mixing processes and also involve the transitional nature of the mantle beneath Tuzgle, where the more northern steep slab encounters the shallower southern subducting slab. Crystal fractionation and melting of upper crustal rocks further complicate the pattern. The lava domes which were erupted from the ground after the Tuzgle ignimbrite have volumes of , while the Platform and subsequent units have volumes of . The lava domes and San Antonio lava flows have porphyritic surfaces. San Antonio lavas contain large plagioclase xenocrystals and xenoliths. The ignimbrite contains Ordovician lithic fragments and 1020% pumice. Its eruption was presumably linked to high mantle melt rates; the resulting mafic magmas induced the generation of large amounts of silicic melts. Lower mantle melt rates would form mafic melts that incorporate silicic melts before erupting. === Activity === The oldest activity is an ignimbrite erupted 0.65 \u00b1 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle ignimbrite. On the rim of the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 \u00b1 (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is compressing the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well- preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages. === Geothermal area and sulfur === The area around Cerro Tuzgle has a high geothermal gradient of , and geothermal studies indicate temperatures of over at depth. Hot springs (with temperatures around ) are also found in the area. The Miocene ignimbritic Trinchera formation may be a geothermal reservoir and the later MiocenePliocene sedimentary Pastos Chicos Formation a seal above it. This geothermal reservoir is deep beneath the earth and thick. A deeper reservoir is also presumed to exist at a depth of . Selected hot springs include TuzgleAgua Caliente (, ), Las Minas () Pompeya (), Mina Betty () and Tocomar (). The water enters the geothermal system in ridges above altitude which are not covered by impermeable layers. Two maars have been found in the Tocomar area. Further, the Antuco travertine and hot springs may be associated with heat flow from the Tuzgle volcanic system. Ancient sulfur mine on Tuzgle The Tuzgle area has been identified as a possible site for geothermal energy production in Argentina with an energy potential of <. These were explored in the 1980s and 1990s, yielding evidence of temperatures . In 2015 a company named Geotermina Andina had six concessions in the area for geothermal drilling. The location of a main power line between Chile and Argentina close to Tuzgle may assist in power generation, and some hot springs could be exploited for tourism. Sulfur deposits generated from hydrothermal alteration are found on Cerro Tuzgle. They are mostly associated with the Azufre synthem and were previously mined on the southern, eastern and western flanks of the volcano. The mines are now abandoned. Arsenic is also found in the groundwater and presumably comes from Tuzgle. == Climate and vegetation == The climate of the Puna is arid, with most precipitation originating in the Amazon basin. During the Last Glacial Maximum, a humid period occurred (possibly directed by orbital changes and monsoon activity), whereas preceding glacial periods were associated with dry phases in travertine deposits at Antuco. Temperatures are usually less than in the Puna with extremes of . Winds usually blow from the west in the dry winter season, with wetter easterly winds arriving during summer. Precipitation in San Antonio de los Cobres () southeast of Tuzgle amounts to . Vegetation is largely missing from the Puna plateau in the area of Tuzgle, which has facilitated the mapping of lava flows from Cerro Tuzgle. A steppe-like vegetation dominated by herbs grows on the slopes of Tuzgle, containing taxa like Festuca, Poa and Stipa as elsewhere on the Puna. ==See also== * List of volcanoes in Argentina ==References== Category:Mountains of Argentina Category:Polygenetic volcanoes Category:Stratovolcanoes of Argentina Category:Subduction volcanoes ",
