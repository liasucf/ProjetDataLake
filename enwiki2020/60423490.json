    "text": "Sandy Rodriguez was born in 1975 in National City, California. She currently lives in the Mar Vista suburb of Los Angeles. She grew up in different cities, including Tijuana, San Diego, and the most influential city to her work: Los Angeles. Her contribution to the art field has been apparent in museums including Los Angeles at Art+Practice, Self Help Graphics, and at The Museum of Contemporary Art. Her work focuses mainly on culture and history. Her artwork portrays the cultural, political, and social change that communities undergo through different periods of time, specifically in the Los Angeles areas. Rodriguez's inspiration was sparked when she took a family trip to Oaxaca, a southern Mexican Region. Whilst she was there, looking through stores she found a red pigment called cochineal, coming from the pre-Columbian era. Prior to this, Sandy Rodriguez had experience with making colors using natural resources such as plants, insects, and oxides. Rodriguez did not know how to use this newfound pigment that was similar to her handmade pigments. She had heard about the uprisings in Ayotzinapa Mexico, with thousands of people protesting and setting the presidential place on fire, where the president Enrique Pena Nieto resided. These uprisings and revolts happened because 43 students from Ayotzinapa were killed by police and gang members. She then decided to compare this historical moment along with the fires in California Hills in her artwork using her bottle of Cochineal. All of her artwork escalated from thereon, pinpointing Latin history, politics and culture. One of her many occupations as an artist include teaching in constituencies and programs to inspire a new generation of artist and to continue pushing the boundaries of art. == Education == With an intention of pursuing art, Sandy Rodriguez attended the California Institute of Arts,1993. She participated in a feminist art program where she became a performance artist. Later on, she went on to receive her Bachelor in Fine Arts from CalArts and has actively overlooked various art programs. == Artworks == *Codex Rodriguez-Mondragon: Her most recent doings are Codex Rodriguez- Mondrag\u00f3n, which are numerous maps and paintings dealing with the issues of politics, culture and location, all interconnecting with one another. This project is a reflection of her political stance and culture perspective in both Mexico and Southern California. The themes include resistance, culture and genocide. Sandy Rodriguez has intersected significant time periods in her Codex Rodriguez-Mandragon project, including the Spanish invasion and the current ICE and immigration deportations. More specifically she included a visual comparison of the invading Spanish vessels and the recent weaponry used by the U.S. border control enforcement. This work was inspired from Book 12 and the Florentine Codex and from her 2017 experiments with Mexican and Pre- Columbian resources.
