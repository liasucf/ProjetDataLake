    "text": "In enzymology, a methanol-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :methanol + 5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide \\rightleftharpoons Co-methyl- Co-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcob(I)amide + H2O Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are methanol and 5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide, whereas its two products are Co-methyl-Co-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcob(I)amide and H2O. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include methanol cobalamin methyltransferase, methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferase, and MT 1. ==Structural studies== As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code . == References == == Further reading == * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of known structure ",
