She grew up in Brooklyn, New York and holds a PhD in marine biology from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. She is the founder and president of Ocean Collectiv, a consulting firm that helps find ocean \"conservation solutions grounded in social justice,\" and the founder of Urban Ocean Lab, a think tank for climate change and ocean conservation policy in coastal cities. She is a former adjunct professor at New York University in the Department of Environmental Studies and previously worked for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Johnson was a national co-director of partnerships for the inaugural March For Science in 2017.

In 2011, she earned a PhD in marine biology from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Her PhD research focused on understanding multi- disciplinary sustainable management approaches for coral reef resources, and her dissertation was entitled \"Fish, fishing, diving and the management of coral reefs.\" For her research, Johnson was awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship, an NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) Fellowship, a Switzer Environmental Fellowship, and was a 2010-11 American Association of University Women fellow. In 2012, the fish trap she invented to reduce bycatch won the first Rare/National Geographic Solutions Search contest. == Career == Johnson's research interests focus on urban ocean conservation, sustainable fishing, ocean zoning, climate change, and social justice. Johnson has conducted research on the bycatch impacts in Caribbean coral reef trap fisheries Johnson AE (2010) Reducing bycatch in coral reef trap fisheries: escape gaps as a step towards sustainability. Mar Ecol Prog Ser 415:201-209. https://doi.org/10.3354/meps08762 and has also collaborated on research related to international collaboration for reducing the impacts of climate change on small island states.

Prior to graduate school, Johnson worked for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. After completing her PhD, Johnson worked for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and then went on to work as the Director of Science and Solutions at the Waitt Foundation in Washington, D.C. to fund ocean conservation projects. In 2013, she became executive director of the Waitt Institute and co-founded the Blue Halo Initiative to partner with governments and local communities in Barbuda, Montserrat, and Cura\u00e7ao to enact more sustainable plans for ocean use and conservation. With the Blue Halo Initiative, Johnson led the Caribbean's first successful ocean zoning project, providing maps, communications, policy support, and scientific assistance to the island Barbuda as it began to regulate and protect its coastal waters. With the Blue Halo Initiative, Johnson led the Caribbean's first successful ocean zoning project. Currently, Johnson works as a consultant for ocean conservation and climate policy issues. She is the founder and president of Ocean Collectiv, a consulting firm designed to advance ocean sustainability and conservation solutions that are grounded in social justice, and the founder of Urban Ocean Lab, an ocean policy think tank.
