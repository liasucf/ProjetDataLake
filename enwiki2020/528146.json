The text was drafted by the 1993 Constitutional Conference, which was attended by over 800 participants. Sergei Alexeyev, Sergey Shakhray, and sometimes Anatoly Sobchak are considered as the primary co-authors of the constitution. The text was inspired by Mikhail Speransky's constitutional project and the current French constitution. The draft text was then put to a constitutional referendum held in Russia on 12 December 1993. Of all registered voters, 54.8% (or 58,187,755 people) participated in the referendum. Of those, 32,937,630 (54.5%) voted for adoption of the Constitution.Constitution of Russia: nature, evolution, modernity 1.4.2 National character. It replaced the previous Soviet-era Constitution of , of Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (which had already been amended in April 1992 to reflect the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the sovereignty of the Russian Federation), following the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. ==History== ===Constitution of Russia after USSR=== ==Structure== The constitution is divided into two sections. ===Section One=== #Fundamentals of the Constitutional System #Rights and Liberties of Man and Citizen #Federative system #President of the Russian Federation #Federal Assembly #Government of the Russian Federation #Judiciary #Local Self-Government #Constitutional Amendments and Revisions ===Section Two=== #Concluding and Transitional Provisions ==Provisions== Especially on human rights and fundamental freedoms, the Constitution provides for human rights and freedoms of citizens according to the universally recognised principles and norms of international law as well as to their listing in the Constitution.Article 17 (It affirms that the listing in the Constitution of the Russian Federation of the fundamental rights and freedoms shall not be interpreted as a rejection and derogation of other universally recognised human rights and freedoms.)Article 55. 1 ===Presidency=== Dmitry Medvedev takes the presidential oath with his right hand resting on the Constitution, 7 May 2008. The Constitution of the Russian Federation specifies that the President is the Russian head of state, setting domestic and foreign policy and representing Russia both within the country and internationally [Article 80].Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. While the original constitution stipulated a four-year term and a maximum of two terms in succession, the current constitution decrees a six-year term. The four-year term was in effect while Vladimir Putin served his first and second terms; with the two-term limit, he was barred from the presidency in 2008. Instead, he served as Prime Minister while Dmitry Medvedev served as president for four years. Putin was re-elected to his third term in 2012; with the six-year term, he was elected to his fourth term in 2018. Article 81 specifies the method of election, including a secret ballot; Articles 82\u201393 detail powers, responsibilities, and limitations of the presidency. The constitution provides for a \"strong presidency\"; not only is the president the \"Supreme Commander- in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation\", the president also has the power to dissolve the State Duma. ===Executive branch=== ===Legislative branch=== The legislature is the Federal Assembly of Russia, which consists of two chambers: the State Duma (the lower house) and the Federation Council (the upper house). The two chambers possess different powers and responsibilities: the State Duma is of more significance, as it carries the main responsibility for passing federal laws. Although a bill may originate in either legislative chamber (or be submitted by the President, government, local legislatures, Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, or High Arbitration Court), it must be first considered by the State Duma and be adopted by a majority vote before being turned over to the Federation Council, which has 14 days to take a vote on it. If the bill is adopted by the Federation Council, it must be signed by the President to become law. If rejected by the Federation Council, the bill will be returned to the State Duma, which can then override the council's rejection by passing it again with a two-thirds vote in the same form. The President has a final veto, but the State Duma and Federation Council also have an overriding power by passing with a two-thirds vote. ===Judiciary=== While the Russian Federation Constitution enumerates a strong and independent judicial branch, the reality is a question of debate. The constitution provides for judicial immunity, lifetime appointments/\"irremovable\" justices, the supremacy of the courts to administer justice, and affirms that judges need only submit to the constitution and the federal law. Additionally, Article 123 provides for open and fair trials, as well as equal application of the law. Three courts are delineated: Constitution Court of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, and the Higher Arbitration Court; each court is \"appointed by the Council of the Federation upon the proposals by the President.\" The Constitution requires 19 judges for the Constitution Court, but does not specify the number of justices for the other courts. As of 2002, the Supreme Court has 115 members;Judiciary_of_Russia#Supreme_Court due to the expansion of duties in 2014, the number of seats was increased to 170. In September 2014, the Institute of Modern Russia reported that the Russian Federation's Supreme Arbitration Court had been dissolved and that judicial matters previously under its authority had been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. ==Amending the Constitution== The procedure for amending the Constitution is outlined in Chapter Nine. Proposals on amendments to and revision of the provisions of the Constitution of the Russian Federation may be submitted by the President of the Russian Federation, the Council of Federation, the State Duma, the Government of the Russian Federation, legislative (representative) bodies of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, and by groups consisting of not less than one fifth of the members of the Council of Federation or of the deputies of the State Duma. __Article 137 covers updating the provisions of Article 65 of the Constitution of Russia.
