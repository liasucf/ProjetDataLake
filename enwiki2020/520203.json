All Along was named into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2019. ==Background== A granddaughter of Round Table, she was owned by Daniel Wildenstein (1917\u20132001), the French art dealer. All Along was trained in France, first by Maurice Zilber (1981) and for the remainder of her career by Patrick-Louis Biancone. ==Racing career== ===1981: Two-year-old season=== As a two-year-old, the filly raced only one time and won. ===1982: Three-year-old season=== The following year, she competed on turf courses in France, England, and in Japan, winning numerous prestigious races. ===1983: Four-year-old season=== In 1983 All Along finished third to Zalataia in the Grand Prix de Chantilly but then finished seventh of the nine runners when favourite for the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. After a summer break she returned for the Prix Foy at Longchamp Racecourse. Biancone decided to change the tactics used on the filly and instructed her jockey to hold up the filly for a late run. She made up a great deal of ground in the closing stages to finish second, a length behind the British-trained filly Time Charter. Ridden by jockey Walter Swinburn, All Along started at odds of 17.3/1 France's most famous race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She was held up until the straight when she was produced with a strong run along the rail, catching the leader Sun Princess in the last 100 metres and winning by a length. Luth Enchantee beat Time Charter in a photograph for third, meaning that fillies filled the first four places.

Two weeks later, she won the Turf Classic at Aqueduct Racetrack in Jamaica, New York by 8\u00be lengths, then won the Washington, D.C. International Stakes at Laurel, Maryland. Four consecutive wins against the best horses in the world all occurred within 41 days. She was the first horse to win the three prestigious North American races in a row, netting a million-dollar bonus for her owners and Horse of the Year honors in both France and the United States. She was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Female Turf Horse and became the first filly to win the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year since the voting system had been implemented in the 1970s. ===1984: Five-year-old season=== In 1984, she competed in only four races, including a close second in the inaugural Breeders' Cup Turf. ==Stud record== All Along retired as a broodmare to the Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, Kentucky.
