    "text": "U.S. Route 7 (US 7) is a north\u2013south U.S. Highway extending from southern Connecticut to the northernmost part of Vermont. In Massachusetts, the route extends for through western Berkshire County. ==Route description== US 7 enters Massachusetts in the town of Sheffield and remains a two-lane road until Lenox. There, a four-lane bypass of Lenox was built in two pieces, and the old US 7 is now Route 7A. US 7 continues on as a four-lane road to Pittsfield, where it is then a three-lane road, narrowing to two lanes for a short time, then widening to four lanes in downtown Pittsfield. US 7 leaves downtown Pittsfield as a two-lane surface arterial, and continues as a rural highway with occasional three-lane stretches for climbing the grades along the Berkshires. It passes west of Mount Greylock before passing through Williamstown, connecting the Taconic Trail with the Mohawk Trail. The road passes Williams College before entering Vermont.' Like Connecticut, Massachusetts planned an interstate-grade freeway (proposed I-89) in the US-7 corridor. The only portions of this plan to be completed were the short \"Super-2\" freeway section from the Connecticut border to Sheffield, and the 4-lane section south of Lenox, although land takings for additional freeway sections occurred. The highway was ultimately canceled due to environmental and community opposition. In Massachusetts, US 7 passes through the towns of Sheffield, Great Barrington, Stockbridge, Lee, Lenox, Pittsfield, Lanesborough, New Ashford, and Williamstown, before crossing into Pownal, Vermont. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== Massachusetts 07 Category:Transportation in Berkshire County, Massachusetts ",
