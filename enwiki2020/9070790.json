    "text": "Ole Bjur (born 13 September 1968) is a Danish former professional footballer who played 384 matches for Br\u00f8ndby IF, with whom he won three Danish Superliga championships. He played as an attacking midfielder or right midfielder, with a good technique and dribbling ability. He represented the Denmark national team on three occasions, scoring one goal. He is the younger brother of Danish footballer Jan Bjur, and father of Peter Bjur. ==Club career== Born in R\u00f8dovre, Bjur started playing football with Vanl\u00f8se IF in the second-tier Danish 2nd Division. When the structure of Danish football was altered in 1991, Vanl\u00f8se was placed in the second-tier Danish 1st Division. At Vanl\u00f8se, Bjur showed himself as a forward with good finishing and eye for the game, and was named 1991 Danish 1st Division Player of the Year.\"\u00c5rets spiller vil snart til udlandet\", Berlingske Tidende, 18 June 1991 This attracted the attention of defending Danish champions Br\u00f8ndby IF, and Bjur moved to the top-flight Danish Superliga club in July 1991. Under Br\u00f8ndby manager Morten Olsen, Bjur saw a lot of playing time, but had a hard time scoring goals. When Br\u00f8ndby hired new manager Ebbe Skovdahl in 1992, he went on to deploy Bjur in a right wingback position, where Bjur was immediately praised for his performance.Vagn Nielsen, \"Sk\u00e5l for os\", Ekstra Bladet, 22 March 1993 From his wingback position, he would both engage in elegant, dribbling runs as well as hit precise crosses.Kurt Thybo, \"Charme Chok Champagne gok\", Ekstra Bladet, 14 June 1993 In the opening of the 1993\u201394 Superliga season, Bjur saw a slump in form. He got his only red card while at Br\u00f8ndby in September 1993,http://www.danskfodbold.com/kamp.php?ID=421 and was eventually left out of the Br\u00f8ndby first team and played a number of games in the reserve team. He returned to form in October 1993,Jan L\u00f8fberg, \"Verdens bedste publikum\", Berlingske Tidende, 24 October 1993 and became one of Br\u00f8ndby's leading men for set pieces. With Skovdahls change of tactics, to a 3\u20134\u20133 formation in March 1994, Bjur was moved up to a forward position, behind the lone striker Mark Strudal, where he reproduced the attacking play of his Vanl\u00f8se days.Niels Abildtrup, \"Bjur bedre bedst\", Ekstra Bladet, 28 March 1994 For the 1994\u201395 Superliga season, Skovdahl changed the formation to a 4\u20134\u20132 system, and Bjur settled into the right-sided midfielder spot. He found a good understanding with right back S\u00f8ren Colding,S\u00f8ren Olsen, \"De unge i hovedrollerne\", Politiken, 15 September 1994 and the two formed a dangerous pairing on Br\u00f8ndby's right flank.Steen Ankerdal & Peter Br\u00fcchmann, \"Bjur bare bedst\", Ekstra Bladet, 28 November 1994 Bjur was a part of the Br\u00f8ndby which won the 1994 Danish Cup,http://www.haslund.info/danmark/pt/199394/fina.asp his first trophy in his Br\u00f8ndby career, and was named 1994 Br\u00f8ndby IF Player of the Year. In the 1995\u201396 Superliga season, Bjur played all 32 games as Br\u00f8ndby won their first Danish championship in five years. He also scored the winning goal in the 2\u20131 defeat of A.S. Roma in the 1995\u201396 UEFA Cup tournament, though Br\u00f8ndby were eventually eliminated on the away goals rule. With Br\u00f8ndby, Bjur went on to win the 1996\u201397 Superliga and 1997\u201398 Superliga championships, as well as the 1998 Danish Cup trophy. He was a part of Br\u00f8ndby's campaign in the 1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League tournament, and played a total of 54 games for Br\u00f8ndby in the European competitions. After more and more games of not feeling satisfied with his own performances, he decided to end his career in November 2000, 32 years old.Andreas H. Kraul, \"Farvel: Sidespringet blev en lang aff\u00e6re\", Aktuelt, 27 November 2000 He went on to concentrate on his studies at the University of Copenhagen. ==International career== Following his Br\u00f8ndby breakthrough in the 1992\u201393 Superliga season, Bjur was touted as a coming man for the Danish national team. However, after his slump in form for Br\u00f8ndby in fall 1993, he was not chosen for the Danish national team by national manager Richard M\u00f8ller Nielsen.S\u00f8ren Olsen, \"Genvalg til alle\", Politiken, 27 August 1993 He was eventually included in the national team squad of newly appointed national manager Bo Johansson in the summer 1996. Bjur was called up for Johansson's first game in August 1996. He scored the winning goal in their debut match, as Denmark beat Sweden 1\u20130 in a friendly match. Bjur started the next national team match, but after 22 minutes, he suffered a minor concussion from a swung elbow, and had to be substituted off. Bjur was then displaced by midfielder Peter Nielsen for the next national team games, before playing his last international game in August 1997. ==Honours== Br\u00f8ndby IF * Danish Superliga: 1995\u201396, 1996\u201397, 1997\u201398 * Danish Cup: 1993\u201394, 1997\u201398 Individual *1991 Danish 1st Division Player of the Year *1994 Br\u00f8ndby IF Player of the Year ==References== ==External links== *Danish national team profile * Br\u00f8ndby IF partial statistics *Danish Superliga statistics Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Danish footballers Category:Br\u00f8ndby IF players Category:Danish Superliga players Category:Denmark international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:People from R\u00f8dovre ",
