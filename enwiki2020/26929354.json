    "text": "Agust\u00edn Ross Park () is a park located in the Agust\u00edn Ross Avenue, in front of the old Ross Casino, in Pichilemu. It is a National Monument of Chile. The original park contains 100-year-old native Canary Island Date palms (Phoenix canariensis) and many green spaces. Both the park and the former casino were named National Monuments on February 25, 1988, and the majority of the houses situated in the park are private homes. It has become an attractive walking destination, following its restoration. The Park was severely damaged after the 2010 Pichilemu earthquake, with all of the balustrades surrounding the park being destroyed. == References == Category:National Monuments of Chile in Pichilemu Category:Buildings and structures in Pichilemu Category:Parks in Chile Category:Tourist attractions in O'Higgins Region Category:National Monuments of Chile es:Pichilemu#Casino y Parque Ross ",
