While in Wilmington she married Dr. J. Bacon Stubbs, a fellow Howard alumnus. In addition to her work as a teacher, Blanche was active in her community; she assisted in founding the Garrett Settlement House (a black orphanage and community center), campaigned for women's suffrage in Delaware, and supported the overturning of the State of Delaware's segregation laws.
