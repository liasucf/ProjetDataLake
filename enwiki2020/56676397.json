A portrayal of August Willich's system of \"advance firing\" utilized by the brigade at Liberty Gap and Chickamauga The brigade was known by the following designations: Johnson's Brigade, McCook's Command, to November 1861. 6th Brigade, Army of the Ohio, to December 1861. 6th Brigade, 2nd Division, Army of the Ohio, to September 1862. 6th Brigade, 2nd Division, I Corps, Army of the Ohio, to November 1862. 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Right Wing, XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to January 1863. 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, XX Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to October 1863. 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, IV Corps, to August 1865. The brigade was further distinguished by a tactic invented by August Willich known as \u201cadvance firing,\u201d in which the regiments were organized into four ranks (rather than two), with one rank moving forward, firing, and reloading as it was replaced with the rank farthest to the rear. This tactic was used by the 49th Ohio to great effect at the Battle of Liberty Gap during the Tullahoma Campaign and again by the brigade at the Battle of Chickamauga.O.R., Volume XXIII(1) O.R., Volume XXX(1) At the Battle of Missionary Ridge, the brigade led the charge against the Confederate lines against orders and was among the first to reach the top of the ridge.O.R., Volume XXXI(2) == Commanders == * Richard W.
