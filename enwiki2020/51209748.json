The tournaments will only award the Ivy League automatic bids for the NCAA Division I Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments; the official conference championships will continue to be awarded based solely on regular-season results. The Ivy League playoff will take place March 11 and 12 at the Palestra in Philadelphia. There will be two semifinal games on the first day with the No. 1 seed playing the No. 4 seed and the No. 2 seed playing the No. 3 seed. The final will be played the next day for the NCAA bid. ==Roster== ==Schedule== 2016\u201317 Dartmouth Big Green women's basketball schedule |- !colspan=9 style=\"background:#00693E; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Non-conference regular season |- !colspan=9 style=\"background:#00693E; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Ivy League regular season ==See also== * 2016\u201317 Dartmouth Big Green men's basketball team ==References== Category:Dartmouth Big Green women's basketball seasons Dartmouth Dartmouth Big Green women's Dart ",
