It administers one village, Vi\u0219eu de Mijloc (K\u00f6z\u00e9pvis\u00f3). It has an area of 443 km2 and a population of 15,037. It is best known for the \" Moc\u0103ni\u021b\u0103\". ==Forestry railway== Vi\u0219eu de Sus is the terminus of a forestry railway system that extends deep into the Vaser river valley approaching the Ukrainian border. Timber is cut on the hillsides at the head of the valley and brought down by rail for cutting in the sawmill at Vi\u0219eu. The waste wood is burned in the locomotive boilers. The nearest national railway (CFR standard gauge) passenger station is at Vi\u0219eu de Jos, 4 km away, on the line 409 from Salva to Sighetu Marma\u021biei. The passenger branch to Bor\u0219a (via Vi\u0219eu de Sus itself), although closed to passengers in 2009, remains mostly intact (as of 2014) for freight. The railway serves also for public transport between Vi\u0219eu de Sus and Paltin (terminus station for public). Trains go every day during spring and summer (from 20 June to 18 September), the departure is at 9 AM. The stations on the way from Vi\u0219eu de Sus are: Novat, Novat Delta, Glimboaca, Cozia and Paltin. Trains may be delayed or cancelled without prior warning due to bad weather or Mountain Rescue advice. == History == The town of Viseu de Sus, according to most authors of monographs, is documented from February 2, 1365 (Ketwyssou). This first mention of Vi\u0219eu de Sus as a settlement appears in the diploma of the king Louis I of Hungary.According to other authors, the settlement was documented since the year 1549, under the name of \"Vi\u0219eul Nou\" (The New Vi\u0219eu) or \"\u00centre R\u00e2uri\" (Between Rivers), being situated at the confluence of the two rivers \u2013 name met until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1373, the border of Vi\u0219eu de Sus and Bor\u0219a is marked, and in 1385 appears the inferior Vi\u0219eu (Vi\u0219eu de Jos). The year 1453 is the one in which Iancu de Hunedoara, the Voivode of Transylvania and the governor of Hungary, gives Vi\u0219eu de Sus to the 3 knezes \u0218tefan, Petru M\u00e2ndru and Nan (Na\u0219cu) and their brothers. The evolution of the town itself starts after the year 1770, when there is established forestry centers with workers in Vi\u015feu and Bor\u0219a \u2013 \"\u021bip\u021beri\" colonits \u2013 from Spi\u0161, brought to Vi\u0219eu by order of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1743, in Vi\u0219eu de Sus there are settled miners from Saxony and establishes exploitation of ores. In 1773, in Vi\u0219eu there is established a logging exploitation center, colonized with \"sa\u0219i\" from Spi\u0161. In 1775, in Vi\u0219eu there are settled German families from Austria (Salzburg and Tyrol). Between 1776 and 1794, the first colonists from Salzkammergut come. In 1778, other 25 families from Gmunden, mostly with many children, come. In 1780 there are being made the first constructions by the newcomers, such as: First mill in the east side of the city; the construction of the dam above M\u0103c\u00e2rl\u0103u begins, construction which would end in 1784, year when other families from Bavaria settle in Vi\u0219eu de Sus. In 1788, the elementary school of the treasury in Vi\u0219eu de Sus is established, and in 1790 the dam at F\u01ceina is built, as well as the first Roman Catholic parish in Vi\u0219eu. In 1798, the first general school is open. The work of the \"\u021bip\u021beri\" is materialized also with the first timber factory (built in 1809), the state store (deposit) built in 1817. Between 1809 and 1810, the new neighborhood \"\u021aip\u021berai\" is formed and populated. The population of German and Austrian origin rose drastically and permanently, based on documents. In the 1930 census of Romania there were registered 2.753 Germans, making up 24,84% of the total population. At the census of 1977, there are 3.430 Germans in Vi\u0219eu de Sus, making up 16,97% of the total population. The \"\u021aip\u021beri\" were brought to Vi\u0219eu firstly as forestry workers. At 14, boys started their work in the forest. At Valea Vaserului, \"\u021bip\u021berii\" planted spruce. They took care of nurseries, deforested forests, sent rafts on the water to Sighet, Vi\u0219eu and Bor\u0219a, they built rafts, roads and wooden bridges. At easier works, women would help too. The hardest and dirtiest job was cutting down the forest and clearing the spruce trunks, and the most tempting for men was rafting. Considering the long time the workers had to spend in the forest, an establishment in Valea Vaserului was a need. The settlement on Vaser represents the closest connection with the history and tradition of today's \"\u021bip\u021beri\". In this area originates several stories of the \"\u021bip\u021beri\": fata p\u01cedurii (forest's girl), omul alb (white human), piticul p\u01cedurii (forest's dwarf); The stories of this ethnic group and the memories of the elders, as well as the documents, bear witness to a hard, primitive life of these people in the past. After 1868, the forced magyarization affected many \"\u021bip\u021beri\", some having to change their name at the time with others of magyar resonance. With the romanians, \"\u021bip\u021berii\" had lived with understanding and unity, mostly also because of the poverty and low standard of living and persecution of foreign domination. In Vi\u0219eu de Sus, the exploitation of wood has an antiquity that is confused with the antiquity of the city. Even the legend says that more than a thousand years ago, a father and his son went to cut wood from the forest. Unhappiness caused a stick to hit his son dead. In memory of his son, the father built a church on this site. Houses were later built around the church and thus a human settlement took shape, which was called, at first, \"\u00centre R\u00e2uri\" (\"Between Rivers\"), because it stretched between the river Vi\u0219eu and Vaser, and then it was called Vi\u0219eu de Sus. With the arrival of German settlers, the exploitation of forests intensified. These occupations, which brought a certain income and a different social status to the residents, in addition to their occupations as animal breeders, are becoming more and more attractive. The wood was cut from above with axes, on gutters with water downstream, gathered in dams at M\u0103c\u00e2rl\u0103u and F\u0103ina, and from here, formed into rafts, going on the Vaser and further to Tisza. Many of the \"\u021bip\u021bieri\" colonists practices were followed by romanians. At the forest, they worked all week long, except on Saturdays when they went down the valley, and sometimes for those who lived further away, the work period was extended to 2\u20133 months. The \"Butinars\" (forestry workers) slept in cottages called \"finnish\", they had the fire in the middle, and the beds were arranged radially so that they could warm up more easily and dry their clothes in the winter. Today, in Valea Vaserului, the wood is transported by narrow gauge railway. == Geography == Vi\u0219eu de Sus is located at the confluence of the rivers Vi\u0219eu and Vaser, at an altitude of 427m above sea level, having the characteristics of a mountain city. It neighbors the communes of Moisei to the SE, Vi\u0219eu de Jos to the W and Poienile de sub Munte to the NW. It also borders Maramure\u0219 Mountains Natural Park to the north, and Rodna Mountains National Park to the south-east. The city administers (ha) 44,306, making it the second largest town by area in Romania. === Relief === The relief is mountainous, made of a plateau surrounded by hills, with the altitude differing from 400m to 1042m (v\u00e2rful lui Dan - English: Dan's peak). The relief has a major impact on the tourism in the zone, due to its views. Vaser is the most attractive tourist route in the Maramure\u0219 Mountains, a defile, separating on the left a few crystalline shales: Prislopa\u0219ul (1201 m), Grebeni (1594 m), Novicioru (1452 m). It shares its border with Ukraine at 1500-1700m. === Hydrography and climate === Vi\u0219eu river rises under Prislop pass, at an altitude of 1.414m and flows in the river Tisza near the commune of Bistra at an altitude of around 330m. The river is 80 km long, and has an inclination of 2-50m/km. It's river basin is developed, mostly, in the mountain zone (67%), which ensures a high density of the hydrographic network and a specific drainage of the highest in the country. Vaser river rises from the Maramure\u0219 Mountains, forming from the springs \"Boului\" and \"Munceii Albi\". It is 62 km long, and it is Vi\u0219eu's most important tributary with a flow higher than itself. === Mineral waters === The special value of these natural riches is given by the great qualitative and quantitative diversity of mineralizations, as well as by the therapeutic (curative) qualities. Mineral waters, due to their complex chemical composition, are natural healing factors with a special therapeutic importance. Waters containing mineral substances and carbon dioxide are waters with a high therapeutic level. The mineral springs in the area resulted from an intense circulation of hydrothermal solutions in the eruptive rocks and in the mass of crystalline rocks and Eocene sedimentary rocks. In the Maramure\u0219 Mountains Natural Park, there had been identified 20. Other mineral waters can be found in Vi\u0219eu de Sus and Valea Vinului. Mineral springs in Valea Vinului, especially the spring known as 'Gulaci', have a mineralization of 12,7 g/l and a concentration of 2,26 g/l CO2. === Fauna and flora === Vegetation is an important element of the natural environment, as well as a factor of tourist attraction. The variety of the relief and the climate are elements that have determined a rich and varied background in the Maramure\u0219 Mountains. The flora and vegetation represent a great importance and interest in several points of view. In an economic point of view, we mention the importance of fodder, melliferous flowers, medicine, food, decoration, etc. Among the alimentary and culinary species, we find: Strawberries, Blackberries, Raspberries, Elderflower, Cherries, Edible mushrooms. Among the medicinal plants, we find: Betula pendula, Crataegus monogyna, Betonica officinalis, Pinus mugo. Some are used for their flavored content, such as: Carum carvi, Funingirus communis, Mentha s.p., Oxalis acetosella. ==== Fauna of alpine hollows ==== Mammals are represented by the most characteristic species of alpine hollows - the black goat (Rupicapra rupicapra). Although it's specific to the alpine floor, it descends mainly in winter and enters the spruce in search of food. There are only a few specimens of black goats and mountain marmots in the Maramure\u0219 Mountains Natural Park, being repopulated since 1965. Birds in the alpine zone are represented by Golden eagles, Water pipits, Accentors and Northern pintails. There are reptiles too, most notable being: Common European Vipers and Viviparous lizards, being present in zones with calcareous rocks. At meadows, there are Common frogs. There once lived other birds, such as Bearded vultures, Cinereous vultures and Griffon vultures. ==== Fauna of forest zones ==== Is rich and varied, comprising a large number of species of hunting interest. The fauna of the softwood forest is represented by: Bears, Wolfs, and Wild boars. Talking about birds, there are: Black grouses, Western capercaillies, Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, Red crossbills, Coal tits, Ring ouzels, etc. - which are characteristic species for coniferous forests. ==== Fauna of deciduous forests ==== Is incredibly rich. The forest is the favorite shelter of wild mammals of hunting interest, therefore finding: Red deers, Foxes, several Marten species, Squirrels, Stoats, Least weasels, etc. Birds in the forests are greatly represented by Wood Owls, Eurasian jays, Stock doves, etc. Here we also find most of the birds of prey: Eurasian sparrowhawks, Northern goshawks, Common buzzards, Lesser spotted eagles. There can also be found: Grey partridges, Common pheasants and Common quails. ==Demographics== Its population is 15,037. The town is in a hilly area, and most of the people live in the valleys: * \u021aip\u021berai and Valea Poieni\u021bei * Valea Vinului (1000 inhabitants) * Valea Vaserului (800 inhabitants) * Valea Pe\u0219tilor (500 inhabitants) * Valea Scradei (700 inhabitants) * Vi\u0219eu de Mijloc (1900 inhabitants) * Valea Botoaia, Ar\u015fi\u0163a (500 inhabitants) * R\u0103deasa (900 inhabitants) == Sister cities == * F\u00fcrstenfeld, Austria * Zug, Switzerland * Verkhovyna, Ukraine * Staunton, Virginia, United States == Image gallery == File:Mocanita - Valea Vaserului.JPG File:Vi\u015feu de Sus, t\u0159\u00edda.jpg File:Viseu de Mijloc 01.JPG (outdated) ==References== == External links == * Forestry railway official site Category:Towns in Romania Category:Populated places in Maramure\u0219 County Category:Localities in Romanian Maramure\u0219 ",
