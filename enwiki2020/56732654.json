    "text": "Clayton Custer (born June 28, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for \u015al\u0105sk Wroclaw of the Polish Basketball League. He played college basketball for Loyola University Chicago. A point guard, Custer is the 2018 Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year. ==High school career== Custer played high school basketball at Blue Valley Northwest High School in Overland Park, Kansas, where he and future Loyola teammate Ben Richardson led the team to back-to-back state championships. Custer ultimately committed early to play for coach Fred Hoiberg at Iowa State. He also received offers from Oklahoma State and Kansas State, and Kansas coach Bill Self told him he was good enough to play for the Jayhawks but they had too many guards at that moment. ==College career== As a freshman in the 2014\u201315 season, Custer played sparingly behind the Cyclones' Mont\u00e9 Morris, one of the top point guards in the Big 12 Conference. He chose to transfer following the season, after scoring 13 points in 12 games. Custer ultimately chose to re-join Richardson under coach Porter Moser at Loyola after Moser took him to lunch and met with his parents. After sitting out the 2015\u201316 season per National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) transfer rules, Custer immediately joined the Ramblers' starting lineup, allowing star Milton Doyle to play off the ball. He averaged 11.6 points and 3.1 assists per game as a sophomore. As a redshirt junior, Custer led the Ramblers to the Missouri Valley Conference regular- season title, despite missing five games to an ankle injury. Custer was named the MVC Player of the Year. Following a run through the 2018 MVC Tournament, Custer and the Ramblers entered the 2018 NCAA Tournament as an 11 seed. After a first-round win over the Miami Hurricanes, Custer led the team to a 63\u201362 second-round win over Tennessee. Custer hit the game-winner with 3.7 seconds left to advance the Ramblers to the Sweet 16. He ended up leading the Ramblers to the Final Four while averaging 13.2 points and 4.2 assists per game. At the close of the 2017-18 season, Custer was awarded the Lou Henson Award for top mid-major player in the country. ==Professional career== After going undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft, Custer signed his first professional contract with \u015al\u0105sk Wroclaw of the Polish Basketball League. ==References== ==External links== *Loyola Ramblers bio *Iowa State Cyclones bio *College stats @ sports- reference.com Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Poland Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players at the 2018 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from Kansas Category:Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball players Category:Loyola Ramblers men's basketball players Category:People from Overland Park, Kansas Category:Point guards Category:\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Kansas City, Kansas ",
