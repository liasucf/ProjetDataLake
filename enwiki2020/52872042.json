    "text": "John Babikian aka \"Wolf of Montreal\" (born August 5, 1988 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian penny stock promoter. In 2013, at the age of 25 years old, he became the subject of international media attention after his $100 million divorce in the province of Quebec was made public. The case files of the divorce revealed a considerable amount of assets which were being dissimulated around the world. According to data compiled by the Bloomberg Agency, Mr. Babikian is alleged to have caused as much as $3 billion in losses for investors in North America and around the world through the website Awesome Penny Stocks. The manipulation may have involved as many as 38 companies. The level of sophistication and success earned him the nickname \"Wolf of Montreal\" after Jordan Belfort who is called \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" with the famous eponymous movie. The companies being manipulated were often obscure OTC companies that had shares priced at just pennies. The e-mails which touted those companies helped inflate the price of the shares and brought high liquidity to otherwise illiquid stocks.In 2012, for example, Babikian touted the shares of a pharmaceutical company. The company's market value grew by $700 million in two months. After the emails stopped, the price of the shares collapsed. == The investigation == Babikian's blatant manipulations drew attention of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). On March 13, 2014 the SEC brought civil charges against him alleging that he pumped the shares of a small company, America West Resources and sold $1.9 million of shares to unsuspecting investors in under 90 minutes. FINRA brought separate charges against an alleged partner of Babikian, stockbroker Thomas Belesis, for selling ahead of his clients on the same company and was eventually disbarred. The SEC and Revenue Quebec ordered a freeze on some of his assets which included * $50 million Global 5000 private plane * $2.5 million Bugatti Veyron * $1.5 million Pagani Huayra * Bentley * Lamborghini * BMW X6M * $10 million house in Hollywood Hills * $2.3 million house in Beverly Hills * A dozen apartments in the Atlantis Bahamas hotel * $5 million house in Montreal, Canada * $10 million house vineyard in Oregon * 300+ bottle of rare wines valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars According to the SEC, in 2012, Babikian left Canada with a tax burden in excess of $4 million and never came back and is currently believed to be living in Russia. Letters sent to five addresses linked to Babikian went unanswered and his attorney, Stanley Morris, based out of Santa Monica, California, refused to comment. John Babikian's former partner Eric Van Nguyen faced similar charges in the United States. John Babikian has yet to face any charges in his native province of Qu\u00e9bec. == Big cars and frozen wealth == According to Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al, before the events occurred, Babikian was planning to build a 17,000-square-foot house in Laval, QC, with estimated construction costs of around $13 million. The house was to be built on a plot of approximately 61,000 square meters and would have contained six bathrooms, five bedrooms, three kitchens, a cigar lounge, a private gym, a massage salon, outdoor spill board, library, bar and garage big enough for nine cars. == References == Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian stock traders Category:People from Montreal ",
