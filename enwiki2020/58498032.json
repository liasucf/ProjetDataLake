    "text": "Lost & Found is a compilation album by Australian country music artist Troy Cassar-Daley. The album was released digitally in March 2018. Upon release Cassar-Daley said \u201cLost & Found is a collection of songs that have only been B-sides on singles or never been commercially available anywhere.\u201d He added \u201cI opened up an old suitcase in the corner of my studio that I've had since my teens and found tapes, old lyrics and CDs of tunes I'd forgotten I'd written. So I set up my tape deck, DAT player and CD player to listen and the first thing that came to mind was these need to be shared not stored and forgotten by time.\u201c The album includes Cassar-Daley's debut single \"Proud Young Man\", only ever available before on 7\" vinyl. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Digital Albums (ARIA) | 45 |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 28 March 2018 | digital download, streaming | Liberation Records | 9341004057951 |- |} ==References== Category:2018 compilation albums Category:Troy Cassar-Daley albums Category:Liberation Records albums Category:Compilation albums by Australian artists ",
