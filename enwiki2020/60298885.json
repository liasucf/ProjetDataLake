Members of the Big Sky Conference, the Wildcats were led by fifth-year head coach Neil McCarthy and played their home games on campus at Dee Events Center in Ogden, Utah. They were overall in the regular season and in conference play, won the regular season title (by four games), and the conference tournament. The sole conference loss was at Idaho, the league runner-up, which broke an winning streak and dropped Weber's poll ranking (AP, UPI) from 15 to 17. The Wildcats appeared in the first five finals of the conference tournament and this was the third consecutive title. Ranked seventeenth in both major polls, Weber State received an automatic bid to the expanded 48-team NCAA Tournament. They were seeded seventh in the West region and hosted the subregional, but were upset by Lamar. ==Postseason results== |- !colspan=6 style=| Big Sky Tournament |- !colspan=6 style=| NCAA Tournament ==References== ==External links== *Sports Reference \u2013 Weber State Wildcats: 1979\u201380 basketball season Category:Weber State Wildcats men's basketball seasons Weber State Weber State ",
