It is native to Java, Indonesia. ==Description== Feroniella lucida is a small to medium-sized tree armed with numerous long, slender, sharp thorns. It grows from 10 \u2013 15 metres tall with a straight bole 20 \u2013 30 cm in diameter. The fruit has a tough green rind with a white and pink pulp containing many yellow crunchy seeds. F. lucida was previously classified as a member of the genus Feronia, but was removed to its own genus by Swingle, who also named a Feroniella oblata now considered the same species as Feroniella lucida. Tanaka would name another genus member, Feroniella pubescens, but this is now known to be Harrisonia perforata, leaving F. lucida as the only member of Feroniella. However, based on recent phylogenetic analysis that surprisingly grouped F. lucida among the citrus, Mabberley suggested it be renamed Citrus lucida. ==Uses== In Cambodia and Java occasionally cultivated as fruit tree. The pulp of the raw fruits is eaten as vegetable. The pericarp is used medicinally.http://mansfeld.ipk- gatersleben.de/apex/f?p=185:46:16768851750631::NO::module,mf_use,source,akzanz,rehm,akzname,taxid:mf,,botnam,0,,Feroniella%20lucida,7732 ' Mansfeld's World Database of Agricultural and Horticultural Crops The pulp is used as a sour ingredient in Cambodian and Thai cooking.
