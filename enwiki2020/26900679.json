    "text": "It's Never Too Late is a 1956 British comedy film directed by Michael McCarthy and starring Phyllis Calvert, Patrick Barr, Susan Stephen and Guy Rolfe. It was based on a 1952 play of the same name by Felicity Douglas. ==Plot== Feeling her combative family has long taken her for granted, genteel British housewife Laura Hammond somehow finds time to write a film script amidst the chaos of her home life. Her work catches the attention of a Hollywood producer, and Laura unexpectedly finds herself the author of a hit film. She also finds she can only write when she's surrounded by her dysfunctional family. Eventually, Laura must choose between being a highly paid writer and celebrity or a housewife. ==Cast== * Phyllis Calvert as Laura Hammond * Patrick Barr as Charles Hammond * Susan Stephen as Tessa Hammond * Guy Rolfe as Stephen Hodgson * Jean Taylor Smith as Grannie * Sarah Lawson as Anne Hammond * Delphi Lawrence as Mrs Madge Dixon * Peter Hammond as Tony * Richard Leech as John Hammond * Robert Ayres as Leroy Crane * Peter Illing as Guggenheimer * Irene Handl as Neighbour * Sam Kydd Uncredited ==Critical reception== TV Guide noted, \"some clever moments, but the film suffers from a staginess that makes it a mildly amusing comedy at best\" ; while the Radio Times found it \"an amiable comedy...This is very much of its time, with its West End origins masked by skilful art direction, but the period cast is a British film fan's delight: Guy Rolfe, Patrick Barr, Susan Stephen, Irene Handl, and even a young Shirley Anne Field. Director Michael McCarthy whips up a fair old storm in this particular teacup, and, although nothing really happens, there's a great deal of pleasure to be had from watching Calvert attempt to rule over her unruly household.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1956 films Category:British films Category:1956 comedy films Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Michael McCarthy Category:British comedy films Category:Films with screenplays by Edward Dryhurst Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films about writers Category:British films based on plays ",
