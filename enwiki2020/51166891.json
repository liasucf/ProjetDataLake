It provides structural design & assessment, consultancy, retrofitting design, and project management services for all aspects of the built environment either existing or new, including infrastructure works design. == General Information == The company was founded in 2002 by prof. Traian Popp, a preeminent Romanian senior structural engineer, along with fellow engineering professionals Drago\u0219 Marcu and M\u0103d\u0103lin Coman. Popp & Asocia\u021bii had its breakthrough projects in 2004, with the structural design of the Charles de Gaulle Plaza office tower and the seismic structural retrofitting of the 110 year old Bucharest Palace of Justice. The Charles de Gaulle Plaza tower site conditions imposed a top-down infrastructure approach for the building's 5 underground levels, the first of its kind in Romania. Equivalent ground- breaking techniques had to be used for the Palace of Justice retrofitting and strengthening as the palace was listed in the 1980s to be demolished in 1990 due to irreparable seismic damage following the 1977 earthquake. The company has continuously evolved thereafter, progressively broadening its expertise and range of services. The Popp & Asocia\u021bii Group now provides geotechnical engineering services, along with building and site monitoring, on site and laboratory material testing services, research and development and structural design consultancy services. The Popp & Asocia\u021bii portfolio spans over a large range of projects, including high-rise office and residential buildings, large-scale commercial centres, deep excavations and historical monuments of national and international importance. Further business includes international consulting contracts for the evaluation of existing buildings to seismic actions, along with research activities for the development of design codes and guides. == Notable Projects == === New Structures === File:2019 Charles de Gaulle Plaza, Bucharest (2).jpg|Charles de Gaulle Plaza Bucharest 2004 File:Porsche Bucuresti.png|Porsche Rom\u00e2nia head offices Bucharest 2004 File:Otopeni-henri-coanda-airport-march-2013.jpg|Henri Coand\u0103 Airport Finger Terminal Bucharest 2010 File:City Gate Towers Bucharest.jpg|City Gate Towers Bucharest 2011 File:Cathedralplazabucharest.jpg|Cathedral Plaza Bucharest 2011 === Existing Structures Rehabilitation === File:PalaceJustice1Buc.JPG|Palace of Justice, Bucharest structural rehabilitation 2004 File:Grand Hotel du Boulevard 08.jpg|Grand Hotel Boulevard structural rehabilitation, Bucharest 2012 File:Biserica Evanghelica din Sibiu-fatada principala.JPG|Lutheran C.A.
