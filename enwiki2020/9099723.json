    "text": "\"I Hate Everything About You\" is the debut single by Canadian rock band Three Days Grace, from their debut self-titled album. The song peaked at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number two on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It was the 111th best performing song of the decade on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, and the 130th best performing song of the decade on the Rock Songs charts. Despite not being one of their number one hits on any of the two charts, it's the band's longest running song on the Modern Rock chart at 45 weeks, and it also stayed 46 weeks on the Mainstream Rock chart. \"I Hate Everything About You\" is one of the band's most successful and most popular songs and is the band's most viewed music video on YouTube with over 265 million views as of July 10, 2020. == Music video == The music video starts zoomed in towards several things, such as a TV producing static, a picture frame, and an ash tray, and then transitions towards Adam Gontier who starts singing. Soon, the video shows three teenagers going through a disastrous moment in their lives. One shows a young boy who finds his girlfriend cheating on him in the alleyway, kissing another guy. He is spying on them in his car. The second teenager is a young girl, who just broke up with her boyfriend, and the last is a boy who is being abused by his alcoholic father. Towards the end they are all seen smashing items relating to their hard times into a hill. The young boy spying on his cheating girlfriend whips a portrait of a picture of them, smashing it to pieces. The second teenager is seen smashing her notebook of love notes and miscellaneous love items with her ex-boyfriend into the hill. The last boy, who is suffering child abuse, throws his drunken father's alcohol into the hill. In the video, the word \"hit\" in \"after every hit we take\" is censored, due to \"hit\" being slang for taking drugs. The video was photographed by cinematographer Steve Gainer, and directed by Scott Winig. == Track listing == ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (2003\u20132005) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region !Date !Format !Version !Label |- ! scope=\"row\" | United States | July 14, 2003 | Mainstream radio | Main | Jive |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada | rowspan=\"5\"| September 22, 2003 | rowspan=\"8\"| Digital download | rowspan=\"5\"| Acoustic | rowspan=\"8\"| Zomba |- ! scope=\"row\" | United States |- ! scope=\"row\" | Australia |- ! scope=\"row\" | Germany |- ! scope=\"row\" | Great Britain |- ! scope=\"row\" | Australia | rowspan=\"3\"| March 19, 2004 | rowspan=\"3\"| Main |- ! scope=\"row\" | Great Britain |- ! scope=\"row\" | Germany |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | March 22, 2004 | CD single | Main | Jive |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | rowspan=\"3\"| January 17, 2005 | rowspan=\"3\"| Digital download | rowspan=\"3\"| Main | rowspan=\"3\"| Zomba |- ! scope=\"row\" | Germany |- ! scope=\"row\" | Great Britain |} ==Accolades== {|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !
