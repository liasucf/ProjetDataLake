    "text": "The Steane code is a tool in quantum error correction introduced by Andrew Steane in 1996. It is a perfect CSS code (Calderbank-Shor-Steane), using the classical binary [7,4,3] Hamming code to correct for qubit flip errors (X errors) and the dual of the Hamming code, the [7,3,4] code, to correct for phase flip errors (Z errors). The Steane code is able to correct arbitrary single qubit errors. In the stabilizer formalism, the Steane code has 6 generators, and the check matrix in standard form is : \\begin{bmatrix} H & 0 \\\\\\ 0 & H \\end{bmatrix} where H is the parity-check matrix of the Hamming code and is given by : H = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}. The 7,1,3 Steane code is the first in the family of quantum Hamming codes, codes with parameters 2^r-1, 2^r-1-2r, 3 for integers r \\geq 3. It is also a quantum color code. ==References== * Category:Quantum information science ",
