It was directed by Mani Kaul and starred Pankaj Sudhir Mishra, Anu Joseph and Om Prakash Dwivedi. The film was released on 30 September 1999 in Netherlands. ==Storyline== Santu, a young low level clerk in a small town government office, lives with his wife in a small rented house. He is often the object of ridicule at the office. One day, at the officer's bungalow, a run-away servant's left-behind shirt is found to fit him. He is forced into the position of doing errands around the house before going to work at the office. The film depicts his efforts to resist the efforts of his boss, landlord and landlord's wife to make him into a servant while trying to maintain his social standing. His wife, on the other hand, within the space of her home is more in control of herself. But even she called upon to do the bidding of the doctor's wife on one or the other pretext. The circle of exploitation perpetuates itself. But at the end, Santu comes home to tell his wife, \"From tomorrow I shall not go the Sahib's bungalow. And you, you will not go to the doctor's house.\" ==Cast== * Pankaj Sudhir Mishra * Anu Joseph * Om Prakash Dwivedi == References == == External links == * Category:1999 films Category:Indian films Category:Films directed by Mani Kaul Category:1990s Hindi-language films ",
