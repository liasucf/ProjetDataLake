    "text": "Blepharidium is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. The genus contains only one species, viz. Blepharidium guatemalense, which is native to Guatemala, Honduras and southern Mexico (Chiapas, Campeche, Tabasco). Older works might mention two species (viz. B. guatemalense and B. mexicanum). == Systematics == Blepharidium was named by Paul Standley in 1918. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words blepharitis or blepharidos, meaning \"on an eyelid\". The similar term, blepharis means \"an eyelash\". A cladistic analysis of morphological characters found Blepharidium to be closely related to Cosmibuena, Balmea, and Hillia, but a molecular phylogenetic study placed it closer to Rondeletia. == References == == External links == * Blepharidium in the World Checklist of Rubiaceae * Blepharidium At:Index Nominum Genericorum At: References At: NMNH Department of Botany At: Research and Collections At: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History * Blepharidium At: Plant Names At: IPNI * Blepharidium In: volume 8 Of: Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences At: Titles At: Biodiversity Heritage Library * CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names: A-C At: Botany & Plant Science At: Life Science At: CRC Press Category:Flora of Guatemala Category:Flora of Honduras Category:Flora of Chiapas Category:Flora of Campeche Category:Flora of Tabasco Category:Monotypic Rubiaceae genera Category:Endangered biota of Mexico Category:Endangered plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
