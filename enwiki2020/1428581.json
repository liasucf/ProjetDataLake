    "text": "The British Military Mission to Poland was an effort by Britain to aid the nascent Second Polish Republic after it achieved its independence in November, 1918, at the end of the First World War. It worked in parallel with the larger and much more significant French Military Mission to Poland. It was commanded by British General Adrian Carton De Wiart (who succeeded General Louis Botha). General Carton De Wiart also headed the British Military Mission to Poland in 1939. It should not be confused with the Interallied Mission to Poland, an improvised effort launched by Lloyd George on July 21, 1920, at the height of the crisis before the Battle of Warsaw. ==See also== * British Expeditionary Force Category:20th-century military history of the United Kingdom Category:Polish\u2013Soviet War Category:Poland\u2013United Kingdom military relations Category:1918 in Poland Category:1918 in military history ",
