    "text": "Fotios \"Freddy\" Geas (born April 4, 1967) is a Greek-American mobster involved with the Genovese crime family, based in New York City. He is a former Mafia hitman operating out of Springfield, Massachusetts and often worked with his brother Ty. In October 2018, Geas, who was serving a life sentence, was accused of the killing of notorious Boston gangster Whitey Bulger. ==Criminal career== Geas was born into a Greek family; therefore, he could not be a made member of the Italian Mafia. Geas and his brother Ty were well known enforcers feared within their community. The Geas brothers worked with Anthony Arillotta, another mobster. In 2003, Arillotta was formally inducted into the Genovese crime family. Arillotta had requested that the Geas brothers kill his brother-in-law, Gary Westerman. Acting boss Arthur Nigro also organized a hit on aging gangster, Adolfo Bruno. Both hits were carried out in 2003. In 2009, Geas was charged with the murder of Gary Westerman and Adolfo Bruno. He was also indicted as the get away driver in the failed assassination attempt on Bronx cement union boss, Frank Dabado, after Dabado was involved in an argument with Nigro over Tony Bennett concert tickets. During the 2011 trial, Geas was shocked to see his former associate, Arillotta testify against him. Geas was known for his strict code. He despised snitches and men who abused women. Geas refused to cooperate with law enforcement and was sentenced to life in prison. ===Murder of Whitey Bulger=== On October 29, 2018, infamous Boston gangster Whitey Bulger was transferred from the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City to United States Penitentiary, Hazelton, in West Virginia. At 8:20 a.m. on October 30, the 89-year-old Bulger was found unresponsive in the prison. Bulger was in a wheelchair and had been beaten to death by multiple inmates armed with a sock-wrapped padlock and a shiv. His eyes had nearly been gouged out and his tongue almost cut off.Prison drops visits after Whitey Bulger slaying , Boston Herald, Laurel J. Sweet, November 2, 2018. Retrieved November 6, 2018. This was the third homicide at the prison in a 40-day span. Correctional officers had warned Congress just days before the most recent Hazelton death that facilities were being dangerously understaffed. Geas was the primary suspect in orchestrating the killing of Bulger. It is believed Geas's hatred of informants and men who abused women led to the murder of Bulger who was known for both. ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Genovese crime family Category:People from Springfield, Massachusetts Category:American mobsters of Greek descent Category:Criminals from Massachusetts Category:Living people ",
