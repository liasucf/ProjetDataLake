During the 1997\u201398 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Atelkin was noticed by the Lecce's scouts during the second round match between Shakhtar and Vicenza. After that he signed a three-year contract with the Italian club that just got promotion to the Serie A. In 1998 Atelkin got injured and lost his sports form, while U.S. Lecce got relegated.

Next year, Atelkin was able to sign a new contract with his former club Shakhtar Donetsk, for which he only played 14 games in two seasons. In 2002 Atelkin signed with Metalurh Donetsk, but only played one game. He returned to Shakhtar Donetsk in 2003. ==Achievements== He was also notable for joining Oleh Matveyev as one of the better forward partnership in the 1990s in the Ukrainian Premier League.
