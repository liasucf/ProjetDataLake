    "text": "Shapes of Things is a double LP compilation album of songs by English rock group the Yardbirds. It was released by Charly Records on 12 September 1977, the first of many Yardbirds compilations on the label. It features selections produced by Giorgio Gomelsky that were recorded between 1964 and 1966. The album marks the first UK release of the group's influential \"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\" and the first album appearance of the instrumental \"Steeled Blues\". Demos for four songs later recorded for the group's post-Gomelsky album, Yardbirds (also known as Over Under Sideways Down and Roger the Engineer), are also included. Shapes of Things is also the title of a comprehensive seven-LP collection of Gomelsky-produced material released in 1984, also by Charly Records. == Track listing == ==References== Category:The Yardbirds compilation albums Category:Albums produced by Giorgio Gomelsky Category:1977 compilation albums Category:Charly Records compilation albums ",
