    "text": "Southern Hemisphere Proving Grounds (SHPG) is an international vehicle testing facility in New Zealand's Cardrona Valley. It is the only one of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, alongside its second operation undergoing development in southern Patagonia, Argentina. It covers 400ha of private land and usually operates during southern winter months. Global car manufacturers seek to test new models during the Northern Hemisphere summer. SHPG was established in the early 1990s, after Japanese car companies like Toyota and Sumitomo began inquiring for a suitable site for testing new engines and tyres in the southern snow. The facility operates under strict discretion for other clients and employ efforts to keep out of the public eye. Alongside car testing, SHPG owns and borders the Snow Farm, a cross-country ski course. In 2013, SHPG bought neighbouring snowsports terrain park Snow Park NZ, which had been struggling after several years of earning under profit. == References == == External links== *https://www.shpg.co.nz/ ",
