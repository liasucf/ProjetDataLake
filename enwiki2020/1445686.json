    "text": "Flip Your Wig is the fourth album by American band H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, released in September 1985. It was the band's first self-produced album. It was the best- selling album to that point for the band's label SST Records, and the last album they made for that label. The band spent months in the studio to achieve higher-quality production for the album's melodic power pop songs. ==Production== By 1985 H\u00fcsker D\u00fc was the best-selling band on SST Records. The band had wanted to produce their previous album New Day Rising, but SST insisted on sending long-time label producer Spot. With Flip Your Wig the band was finally allowed to self-produce. Recording took place over several sessions in the band's hometown of Minneapolis from March to June 1985, by far the longest the band had spent in the studio. The cleaner production complemented the more melodic songs, still performed with heavily distorted guitars in a high-powered manner. ==Songs== Guitarist Bob Mould and drummer Grant Hart each wrote roughly half the songs, which continued the band's trend toward power pop and away from the fast, noisy hardcore punk of their earliest material. \"Makes No Sense at All\" was released as a single, with \"Love Is All Around\" (the theme song of the Mary Tyler Moore Show) on the b-side. The \"Makes No Sense at All\" video was the band's first. \"Makes No Sense at All\" was the band's first song to achieve significant airplay on album-oriented rock radio. ==Release and reception== Flip Your Wig appeared via SST in September 1985. It d\u00e9buted at No. 5 on the CMJ album charts and received more radio airplay and mainstream press attention than the band's earlier releases, including stories in Creem, Spin, Rolling Stone. Robert Christgau declared in The Village Voice that with the album's production the band had \"never sounded so good\", and the album placed in the top ten of the magazine's critics' poll for 1985 along with New Day Rising. Flip Your Wig became SST's best-selling album at the time of its release, moving 50,000 copies in its first four months. By the time the album was released H\u00fcsker D\u00fc had signed a record deal with the major-label Warner Music Group, who were keen to release the album themselves. However, out of loyalty, and because of SST's appointment of new promotions manager Ray Farrell, the album was given to SST. Decades later, Bob Mould saw Flip Your Wig as \"the best album H\u00fcsker D\u00fc ever did\". Ira Robbins and John Leland at Trouser Press describe the album as \"Positively brilliant \u2014 fourteen unforgettable pop tunes played like armageddon were nigh\" and rate \"Makes No Sense at All\" as \"one of 1985's best 45s\". AllMusic's review says \"Flip Your Wig would be a remarkable record on its own terms, but the fact that it followed New Day Rising by a matter of months and Zen Arcade by just over a year is simply astonishing.\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/flip-your- wig-mw0000190362 ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Liner notes adapted from at the album sleeve. * Bob Mould \u2013 producer, guitar, bass, piano, lead and background vocals, percussion * Greg Norton \u2013 bass * Grant Hart \u2013 producer, drums, lead and background vocals, vibraphone, slide whistle, percussion, * Steve Fjelstad \u2013 engineer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- |+ Chart rankings |- ! scope=\"col\" | Chart (1985) ! scope=\"col\" | Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\" | UK Indie Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1 |} ==References== ===Works cited=== * * * * * * * * Category:H\u00fcsker D\u00fc albums Category:1985 albums Category:SST Records albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Mould ",
