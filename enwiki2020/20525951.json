    "text": "Superpoke! and SuperPoke! Pets were virtual goods apps for Facebook and MySpace originally created by Nikil Gandhy, Will Liu, and Jonathan Hsu. They launched less than one month after the creation of the Facebook Platform. Max Levchin's Slide acquired the application and its creators in 2007, with the application growing to become one of Facebook's most popular applications in terms of monthly active users. The application mimicked Facebook's own \"poke\" feature, adding new actions like smiles, winks, slaps, and \u201csmacking\u201d Facebook friends. At one point SuperPoke! allowed users to virtually \u201cstab\u201d friends; Facebook later asked Slide to remove this option. SuperPoke! differentiated itself from other applications by introducing characters such as a sheep, chicken and penguin. These characters were originally designed by Nikil Gandhy. Superpoke! was shut down on September 27, 2011 and SuperPoke! Pets closed March 7, 2012 == Shutdown of SuperPoke! Pets and subsequent lawsuit for loss of purchased virtual goods == In August 2010, Slide was acquired by Google, and almost a year later SuperPoke! Pets announced significant changes including removal of gold buying and quests. In September 2011, it was announced that SuperPoke! Pets would be shut down permanently beginning March 6, 2012. In 2012, the SuperPoke! Pets user community sued Google/Slide for shutting down SuperPoke! Pets after its players had invested an estimated $650 million of money in virtual goods that, with the shutdown of the app, would now expire worthless. The plaintiff's legal team wrote that Google's offer of a limited, \"SuperPoke! Pets Lite\" that eliminated access to virtual goods and interaction with pets was inadequate because it \u201centirely stripped the value from customers' original purchases,\u201d rendering their virtual items as \u201ceffectively valueless\u201d as users could no longer interact with each other on the secondary market or play with their virtual pets. Characterizing the virtual items they had purchased as \u201cproperty,\u201d they claimed that as a result of Slide/Google's actions, individual players lost access to an inventory of goods that had cost \u201chundreds or even thousands of dollars.\u201d In 2013, the case was voluntarily dismissed by Abreu. ==References== Category:Facebook applications Category:Computer-related introductions in 2007 ",
