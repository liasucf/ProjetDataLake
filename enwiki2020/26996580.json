    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1818 and 1819 were elections for the United States Senate that had the Democratic-Republican Party gain two seats. The Federalists had only three seats being contested, of which they lost two and the third was left vacant due to a failure to elect. As these elections were prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, Senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Results summary == Senate Party Division, 16th Congress (1819\u20131821) * Majority Party: Democratic-Republican (30\u201337) * Minority Party: Federalist (9) * Vacant: 3\u20130 * Total Seats: 42\u201346 == Change in composition == === Before the elections === After the admission of Illinois. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=800px |- | colspan=9 | | | DR |- | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | colspan=9 style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | DR |- | | F | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F |- | colspan=9 | | | F |} === Result of the general elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" width=800px |- | colspan=9 | | | DR |- | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | colspan=9 style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | DR |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | | V | | V | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F |- | colspan=9 | | | F |} === Results of the 1819 special elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=800px |- | colspan=8 | | | DR | | DR |- | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | colspan=9 style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | DR |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | V | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F |- | colspan=8 | | | F | | F |} {| |- valign=top !
