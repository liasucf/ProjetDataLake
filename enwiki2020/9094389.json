    "text": "Superbus is a five-piece French pop/rock band formed in 1999 Interview with Superbus on EVENE.fr with Jenn Ayache on lead vocals. The band's name is from the Latin word superbus, meaning proud, which Ayache stumbled upon while browsing through a Latin dictionary. The band has released five studio albums to date and a compilation album. ==Beginnings== After a trip to the United States to perfect her English in 1999, Jennifer Ayache looked for musicians to form a group. She met Michel Giovannetti, a guitarist, and Fran\u00e7ois Even, a bass guitarist, who already knew each other from another group, and formed a new band, initially as a three-piece before two other members joined. Those two were later replaced by Guillaume Rous\u00e9 on drums and Patrice Focone on guitar. Rous\u00e9 left the band in 2005 and was replaced by Greg Jacks. ==History== In 2002, Superbus released its first album, A\u00e9romusical. The band's second album, Pop'n'gum, released in 2004, was produced by David Salsedo from Silmarils. In 2006, Superbus won the Best French Act award at the MTV Europe Music Awards and, in 2008, the NRJ Music Award of the Best French Music Band. After three months of touring during summer 2010, the band announced a short break, during which each member would work on solo projects. In August 2011, the band's lead guitarist, Patrice Focone, announced they would begin work on new material together in early September. In April 2012, Jenn announced the band is finalizing the mixing of their new album and will go on tour later in 2012. They premiered a new single in June entitled \"All Alone\" and released a music video for it shortly after with a follow-up single entitled \"A la chaine\". Yet a third single \"Whisper\" featured Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi. A music video for the single was released on Halloween 2012. In early November, 2012, the band began to embark on their Sunset Tour from late 2012 to summer 2013 to promote their album Sunset. In October 2015, Superbus released a non-single song called \"Un Autre Monde\" for an album featuring various artists called the T\u00e9l\u00e9phone Tribute. In 2016, Superbus started teasing for a new album on their Facebook page. This album was that revealed to be Sixtape, the band's 6th album, and it was released in 2016 June 3. The first single off the album is called \"Strong and Beautiful,\" which Superbus released a lyrics video for on March 4, 2016. The second single off the album is called \"On the river\", and Superbus released a lyrics video for it on September 12, 2016. The singles also have an acoustic, piano-driven version included on the Limited edition CDs, these also have shorter lyrics than the original versions. On June 15, 2019 the band revealed the poster for a new tour that signifies the band's 20th anniversary celebration. Later on, it was also revealed that the band will likely have a new album coming in early 2020. The band's latest EP, named XX was released on March 13, 2020. ==Members== *Jennifer Ayache, a.k.a.
