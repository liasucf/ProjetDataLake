    "text": "Baron Chandos is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England. ==History== A Robert de Chandos went to Ireland with King John in 1185. His son Roger in 1221 received licence to hold a fair at Fownhope in 1221. The son of this Roger, Robert de Chandos (d. 1302) participated in the Welsh expedition of Edward I. The son of Robert, Roger de Chandos, served in the Scottish wars of Edward II and received a knighthood. In 1321, he was sheriff of Herefordshire. He was succeeded by Thomas de Chandos.Wilhelmina Powlett, Duchess of Cleveland, The Battle Abbey Roll vol. 1 (1889), s.v. \"Chaundos\". Thomas was succeeded by his brother Roger de Chandos (Rogerus de Chaundos). Roger was made knight banneret by Edward III. It was this Roger who was summoned to parliament, and who was cited as Baron de Chandos between 1337 (11th year of Edward III) and 1355, counting as the first creation of the title.Thomas Christopher Banks, Baronia Anglica Concentrata (1844), p. 151. Roger was succeeded by his son Thomas, who was in turn succeeded by his son John. Neither of these were summoned to parliament, and are thus not named Baron Chandos explicitly, but counted as de jure 2nd and 3rd Barons Chandos, respectively. John, who defended Hereford Castle against Owen Glendwr in 1403, died without issue in 1428. The Chandos estates in Herefordshire passed to the surviving daughter of John's sister Elizabeth, wife of Nicholas Mattesden, and eventually to his great nephew Giles Brugge, de jure 4th Baron Chandos and father of Thomas Brugge, 5th Baron Chandos (d. 1493). Thomas' son, Giles Brugge, 6th Baron Chandos (d. 1511) held the office of High Sheriff of Gloucestershire for 1499.

In 1554, he was given Sudeley Castle and created \"Baron Chandos, of Sudeley in the county of Gloucester\" by Queen Mary, in the second creation of the title. The three succeeding barons were all Members of Parliament and persons of some importance \u2014 see particularly Grey, 5th Baron, and his elder son George, 6th Baron. George had six daughters but no sons, and after the death of his brother William in 1676 the barony came to a kinsman, Sir James Brydges, Bart., who was English ambassador to Istanbul from 1680 to 1685. The eighth baron's eldest son, James Brydges (1674\u20131744), succeeded his father as ninth Baron Chandos in 1714. In the same year, he was created Earl of Carnarvon (second creation) and Duke of Chandos in 1719. Subsidiary titles included Marquess of Carnarvon (1719) and Viscount Wilton (1714). All of these titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. The 1st Duke built an exceptionally grand country house called Cannons that, though it was parodied in his lifetime, was a seat of great learning and culture: Handel was the resident composer from 1717 until 1719. Brydges' Cannons was demolished after his death, to pay the debts he incurred in the South Sea Bubble disaster, and by his son. It was replaced by a modest villa built by William Hallett, and Cannons is now occupied by North London Collegiate School whose Archives contain some information on the Duke, his second wife Cassandra Willoughby, and subsequent owners of Cannons. Jane Austen was descended from his sister Mary. With the death of the third duke in 1789, the titles became extinct, and the barony became dormant. An attempt was made by Samuel Egerton Brydges to claim the barony, initially on behalf of his older brother Edward Tymewell Brydges and then on his own behalf. Litigation lasted from 1790 to 1803 before the claims were rejected, but Egerton Brydges continued to style himself per legem terrae Baron Chandos of Sudeley. It seems likely that not only was the claim groundless but that the evidence was forged. ==List of title holders== ===Barons Chandos, first creation (1337)=== The title is spelt 'Chaundos' in the Complete Peerage.2nd edition, volume 3, P147 *Roger de Chandos, 1st Baron Chandos (d. 1353) was probably 1st Lord Chandos. *Thomas Chandos, 2nd Baron Chandos (c.1333 - 1375)(claimant) *John Chandos, 3rd Baron Chandos (c. 1349 - 1428) (claimant) (peerage abeyant 1428) *Giles Brugge, 4th Baron Chandos (1396-1467) (abeyance terminated 1458, on the death of his cousin) *Thomas Brugge, 5th Baron Chandos de jure (1427 \u2013 30 January 1493) *Giles Brugge, 6th Baron Chandos (c. 1462 \u2013 1 December 1511) Most sources read that the title became extinct upon the death of the 1st Lord, although others, such as the Complete Peerage, include the further holders listed above.
