    "text": "Rani Rashmoni, is from Mahishya family, founder of the Dakshineswar Kali Temple in Calcutta Mahishya, also spelled Mahisya, is a Bengali Hindu agrarian caste. The Mahishyas do not enjoy any reservation benefits and are thus considered as General caste in West Bengal. Historically considered a lower caste, along with many other agricultural castes, the Mahishyas today are regarded as middle-castes groups in parts of Bengal. They are traditionally found in the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Odisha. Mahishyas are one of the predominant castes in West Bengal, especially in the southern districts of Howrah, Paschim Medinipur, Purba Medinipur, Hooghly and South 24 Parganas. Some members are now employed in the business and service sectors as well. ==Mythology== According to ancient texts like Manusmriti, the term Mahishya refers to one born to a Kshatriya father and a Vaishya mother, supposed to be engaged in the profession of astronomy or agriculture. ==History== The group now known as Mahishyas were originally considered Kaibarttas. In the latter half of the 19th century, many upwardly mobile Kaibarttas, the caste generally being associated with the lowly occupation of fishing, asserted themselves as Chasi Kaibartta and later, as Mahishyas; transforming themselves into a regionally dominant agrarian caste especially in districts like Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly. Although many are still involved in traditional work in rural areas, within a generation Mahishyas gave up agriculture in large numbers in favour of engineering and skilled labour in the urbanised areas of Howrah and Kolkata. In Howrah, the Mahishyas are the most numerous and successful businesspeople. At the turn of the 20th century, much of the land and factories were owned by Kayasthas; but by 1967, the Mahisya community owned 67 percent of the engineering businesses in the district. ==Social stigma== Although the financial, social, and political success of Mahishyas is notable, they have often been stigmatised due to their agrarian roots. Mahishyas have not been averse to manual labour (often considered demeaning by higher castes); for example, Birendranath Sasmal was refused the post of Chief Executive of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation by Chittaranjan Das on the grounds that his appointment would offend the Kayasthas of the city. The job ultimately went to Subhas Chandra Bose. ==See also== * Jalia Kaibarta ==References== Category:Bengali Hindu castes Category:Indian castes Category:Demographic history of India Category:Social groups of West Bengal ",
