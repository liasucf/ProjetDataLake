    "text": "The Daffodil Festival is an annual celebration in Gloucester County, Virginia. The festival takes place in early April to celebrate the heritage and community of the county of Gloucester, as well as its heritage of daffodils. Gloucester's historic production of daffodils led it to become named the \"Daffodil Capital of America\". It offers many aspects including scholarships, contests for Daffodil Queen and a parade. Approximately 8,000 people attend the festival every year. From 1937 to 1941, a Daffodil Festival attracted tourists to the area to see the vast acres of yellow blossoms. In March 1942 the organizing committee suspended the festivities due to the war. It resumed 45 years later. ==History== In 1651 Gloucester County was formed from part of York County. This flower began to grow around the county soon after. Gloucester County earned the title of \"Daffodil Capital of America\" in the 1930s and 1940s. Daffodil farms sprouted with bulbs imported from other countries. Gloucester was featured in the National Geographictwice with pictures of townsfolk and daffodils. After World War II, a decline in growth occurred followed by a resurgence of daffodil production. This frenzy led to over-production and the eventual decline of daffodil production.Ray, 1991 ==Scholarships== The Daffodil Festival offers one four-year, renewable scholarship worth $100. The scholarship is awarded to a graduating senior from Gloucester High School. Past winners include Trip Vaughn, Sam Markwith and Kasey Koulhurst.
