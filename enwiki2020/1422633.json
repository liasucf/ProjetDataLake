    "text": "Century III Mall was an enclosed shopping mall located in the southern Pittsburgh suburb of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. The mall was built on a former slag dump in 1979. The Century III Mall planning began in 1976, opened in 1979, and closed in 2019. It was once the third largest shopping mall in the world when it opened in 1979. The mall was originally developed and owned by Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation. From 1996-2011, Century III was owned and operated by Simon Property Group. The vacant mall site is currently owned by Las Vegas-based Moonbeam Capital Investments LLC. == History == Century III Mall was originally built in 1979. The three-level mall contained of retail space and over 200 shops and restaurants. The Phase I segment of seventy-five stores was dedicated on October 24, 1979. This included three anchors; a 2-level 121,300 square foot, Pittsburgh-based Kaufmann's, and 2-level 173,200 square foot JCPenney. The Kaufmann's unit was the chain's fourth shopping mall store and the first in the Pittsburgh region to anchor a mall-type center. Phase II, with the 2-level 168,100 square foot Montgomery Ward and forty-six stores debuted March 12, 1980. Phase II of Century III Mall added the third, fourth and fifth anchors to the complex, including a 2-level 126,000 square foot Gimbels-Pittsburgh, which began business in July 1980 and a 2-level 231,000 square foot Sears, which opened in October 1980. The Montgomery Ward location at Century III Mall was the first such location for the Chicago-based chain in Allegheny County. The Wards location only lasted a few years, however, and ultimately closed in 1986. The location then became a unit of The Joseph Horne Company, owned by the New York City-based Associated Dry Goods Corporation, which then closed its nearby Brentwood store. In 1994, the location changed names again when the Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores purchased Horne's and converted the chain's locations into its own Lazarus regional nameplate. In 1999, after operating a few years as Lazarus, Federated closed several locations, including the Century III store. The location then became a unit of Kaufmann's, which opened a furniture showroom in that location. Kaufmann's was a division of the St. Louis-based May Department Stores Company. === Anchors === JCPenney, the last remaining store open, closing around August 14, 2020 *Gimbels - opened 1980, closed in 1988 due to the chain filing for bankruptcy. In 1994, the lower and upper levels were filled with Marshalls (upper level) and TJ Maxx (lower level). Marshalls closed in 1996, and in 1997, Wickes Furniture opened in its place. In 1998, TJ Maxx became TJ Maxx 'n More. In 2003, TJ Maxx 'n More closed, and Steve & Barry's moved in its place. In 2004, Wickes closed and Dick's Sporting Goods moved in. Steve & Barry's closed in 2009 due to the chain filing for bankruptcy. On March 24, 2019, a bankruptcy judge granted approval to reject the lease of Dick's Sporting Goods. They announced their closure and closed on March 30, 2019. *Kaufmann's - became Macy's in September 2006, closed in March 2016. *Montgomery Ward - opened 1980, closed in 1986, and Horne's moved into its place. In 1994, it became Lazarus. Lazarus closed in 1999 due to underperforming sales and became Kaufmann's Furniture Gallery, then in 2006, it became Macy's Furniture Gallery, which closed in 2009. *Sears - opened 1980, closed December 7, 2014. *JCPenney - opened in 1979 with Phase I. The last remaining store open on the property, closing October 26, 2020. === Decline === Entry E at the Mall Former Dick's Sporting Goods location At its peak throughout the 1980s, Century III Mall boasted over 200 stores, services and eateries, which at the time, was the largest enclosed shopping center in the Pittsburgh area by store count. In 1997, the mall received an $8 million face-lift, which included the addition of skylights in the mall's common areas. Several contributing factors beginning in the late 1990s would result in the eventual decline of the mall. The biggest of these factors was the development of the Waterfront, which opened in nearby Homestead in 1999. The development had significantly expanded over the years, pulling shoppers away from Century III. South Hills Village, a smaller mall located only five miles to the west in Bethel Park, also underwent a major renovation, incorporating a large food court among its amenities. Adding to the mall's woes, it lost its first anchor tenant in 1999 when Federated Department Stores closed the Lazarus store due to underperforming sales. Other major retailers, such as TJ Maxx 'n More and Wickes Furniture, also closed in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The former Wickes Furniture location was replaced by Dick's Sporting Goods, and TJ Maxx 'n More was filled with Steve and Barry's. As early as 2003, Century III Mall was about 20% vacant. By the late 2000s, several key retailers with locations at Century III Mall filed for bankruptcy, resulting in additional vacancies. On July 18, 2005, Federated Department Stores purchased the May Department Stores Company. That purchase brought the Kaufmann's nameplate under Federated ownership. On September 9, 2006, Federated converted all former May Company regional department store nameplates, including Kaufmann's, into Macy's as part of a nationwide re- branding program, resulting in the Kaufmann's Furniture Gallery location to be returned once again to Federated Department Stores ownership and subsequently renamed as Macy's Furniture Gallery. Macy's Furniture only occupied the lower level. The mall went up for sale in 2006 as Simon Property Group refocused on its top-performing properties, including South Hills Village and Ross Park Mall in Pittsburgh's northern suburbs. As the mall continued to languish, it affected the mall's assessment value, which stood at $66 million in April 2009, a 40 percent decrease from the previous $112 million in recent years. Prior to that, the mall was valued at $128 million. In June 2009, it decreased further to $58 million. The struggling mall was noted as being one of America's most endangered malls in a published report by U.S. News & World Report. In April 2009, Macy's Furniture closed its Century III Mall location as a cost-cutting measure. Just prior to the closing, the fountain near the food court was drained and filled with mulch. In 2010, La Hacienda opened in the former Ruby Tuesday space, but it closed and was eventually replaced with Old Mexico Restaurant in 2015. Also during this time, certain sections of mall parking were permanently barricaded and blocked off to the general public, particularly in the parking deck. Simon Property Group defaulted on its $78 million loan for Century III Mall in August 2011, ultimately transferring ownership to its lenders. From September 2011 to May 2013, the mall was managed by Jones Lang LaSalle. On May 13, 2013, Century III Mall was purchased by Las Vegas-based Moonbeam Capital Investments LLC, a real estate investment trust which operates other shopping centers across the United States. In July 2014, a new double-decker carousel opened in the center court. Sears closed on December 7, 2014. By 2015, the mall had become 60% vacant. On January 6, 2016, Macy's announced it would close its Century III store as part of a larger round of closings across the country. Macy's departure resulted in a mass exodus of retailers to leave the moribund mall. Its occupancy rate fell from 40 percent in January 2016 to 10 percent by December 2017. The once-sprawling food court, previously home to over 20 eateries, was now completely vacant after the last remaining food court tenant, Italian Village Pizza, closed on July 1, 2017. The fast-fading mall continued to see more departures in 2018. Old Mexico, the last restaurant in the mall, closed in April 2018, leaving the mall with no food tenant. In addition, the double-deck carousel was shut down and dismantled around the same time to be sent to an undisclosed location in Austin, Texas. In April 2018, filming took place in the old Macy's Furniture Gallery wing for the Netflix original series Mindhunter. On June 1, 2018, a walk-through was held for former mall workers and patrons who wanted to tour the mall one last time due to a sheriff's sale. Over 200 people participated in the event. On September 4, 2018, a sheriff's sale of the mall was postponed after Moonbeam Capital Investments filed for bankruptcy for the mall at the last minute. On January 1, 2019, Life Uniform, the last of the mall's chain tenants, departed from the Century III Mall. Century III Mall notice uninhabitable On February 6, 2019, West Mifflin fire code deemed Century III Mall to be \"unsafe, unhabitable\" due to numerous code violations, such as a non-functional sprinkler system, and no heat. On February 15, 2019, after 15 years, New Dimension Comics said that they were moving to The Waterfront beside Best Buy and Michael's. On February 12, 2019, Moonbeam's website said the mall was sold shortly after they took the sold banner off of their website. On February 16, 2019, the remaining mall tenants were issued eviction notices. JCPenney and Dick's Sporting Goods were the only remaining stores open at the time. On March 24, 2019, Dick's Sporting Goods announced that they were closing and that their last day would be March 30, 2019. This left 1 remaining and original anchor, JCPenney. On April 17, 2019, it was announced that a redevelopment plan was coming to the mall. On June 5, 2019, it was reported that the mall was boarded up and the future of the mall remains unclear; despite the closure, JCPenney remains in operation. On June 21, 2019, owners indicated that the largely vacant mall would be torn down in March 2020 with the exception of JCPenney, which would remain open. In place, a mixed-use development would be constructed on the site. The plan includes incorporating retail, dining and entertainment attractions as well as a hotel, office space and residential units. It is expected to open in 2024. Further information in the bankruptcy dockets reveal a timeline with various dates. The demolition of the mall could begin as early as March 2020 and last 6\u201312 months. Site remediation, which would include removing existing foundations as well as performing major excavation and bringing in massive amounts of fill to level the entirety of the mall site, would follow shortly after and take 18 months to complete. the first buildings would be built in May 2022. On August 7, 2019, according to information obtained from Inforuptcy, a \"motion to reject lease or executory contract of JCPenney Properties, Inc.\" was filed out by Debtor Century III Mall PA LLC, which is part of Moonbeam. On August 31, 2019, Moonbeam's website said that the mall was sold. On August 5, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney would close in October 2020 as part of a plan to close 151 stores nationwide, leaving the mall entirely vacant. == References == == External links == *Century III Mall Memories Facebook Page *Century III Mall at Abandoned *Century III Mall at DeadMalls.com *Tour of the abandoned Macy's Furniture wing.
