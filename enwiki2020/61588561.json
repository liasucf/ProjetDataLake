    "text": "The Sustainable New Zealand Party, also called Sustainable NZ, is a political party in New Zealand. An environmentalist party, it has a focus on water, native species, and sustainable economic growth. It contrasts itself with the larger Green Party by claiming to not be aligned with either side of the political aisle and being prepared to work with either the National Party or the Labour Party. Waitemat\u0101 Local Board member Vernon Tava conceptualised the idea of Sustainable NZ in early 2019 and the party was launched in November 2019. Mainstream media have characterised the party as a \"teal\" or \"blue- green\" group, labelling rejected by Tava, who insists on seeing Sustainable NZ as a \"green-green party\". == Creation == New Zealand's largest and longest- lasting environmentalist party, the left-wing Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, was founded in 1990 and first entered Parliament in 1996 as part of the Alliance, and later on its own in 1999. The Party throughout its existence has been positioned on the left of New Zealand politics. After the 2017 general election, National suggested the idea of a National\u2013Green Party coalition government that would have averted the possibility of New Zealand First in government; the idea was immediately dismissed by Greens leader James Shaw. Consequently, figures within the party such as Vernon Tava departed from the Party in an effort to establish an environmental party that could work with either major party and potentially always be in government. == Registration accusations and resignations == The party applied for registration with the Electoral Commission on 15 November 2019 and was accepted on 4 December. In February 2020, the former secretary to the party, Helen Cartwright, declared that she was asked to falsify membership records to get the party registered. Cartwright claimed she had audited the membership fees and found they were 35 short of the 500 required, but that Tava suggested the party edit the party's financial documents to cover the discrepancy. Tava said that the party had acted in full compliance with the Electoral Act. Cartwright says that the party has retained its registration because it does now have enough members. By February 2020, four months after founding, a number of members had left the party, including party secretary Helen Cartwright and the party treasurer. Cartwright subsequently formed the Integrity Party Of Aotearoa New Zealand. The party received a broadcasting allocation of $51,821 for the 2020 election. The party won 1,469 party votes in the 2020 election, or 0.1% of the total. == Polling == As of May 2020, the party had not registered in any public polling. By the end of September 2020, it had registered in only one of Colmar-Brunton's polls, receiving 0.1% of support in its mid-September poll. ==Election results== ===House of Representatives=== {| class=wikitable ! rowspan=2| Election ! colspan=2| Candidates nominated ! rowspan=2| Seats won ! rowspan=2| Votes ! rowspan=2| Vote share % ! rowspan=2| Position ! rowspan=2| MPs in parliament |- align=\"center\" !
