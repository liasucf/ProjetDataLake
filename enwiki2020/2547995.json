    "text": "The United Provinces of Central Italy, also known as Confederation of Central Italy or General Government of Central Italy, was a short-lived military government established by the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. It was formed by a union of the former Grand Duchy of Tuscany, Duchy of Parma, Duchy of Modena, and the Papal Legations, after their monarchs were ousted by popular revolutions. Since August 1859, the pro-Piedmontese regimes of Tuscany, Parma, Modena and the Papal Legations agreed to several military treaties. On 7 November 1859, they elected Eugenio Emanuele di Savoia-Carignano as their regent. However, King Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, who was allied to France which claimed a counterpart, refused to endorse the election, and sent Carlo Bon Compagni instead as the Governor General of Italy Central, who was responsible for the diplomatic and military affairs of the states. On 8 December 1859, Parma, Modena and the Papal Legations were incorporated into the Provinces Royal of Emilia. After plebiscites were held during March 1860, and France was granted Nice and Savoy, the territory was annexed formally to Piedmont-Sardinia. ==See also== *Italian Unification *Grand Duchy of Tuscany *Duchy of Parma *Duchy of Modena and Reggio *Victor Emmanuel II, King of Sardinia *List of historical states of Italy *Former countries in Europe after 1815 ==References== *States and Regents of the World Category:States and territories disestablished in 1860 Category:Italian unification Category:States and territories established in 1859 Category:Former countries on the Italian Peninsula Category:1859 establishments in Italy Category:1860 in Italy ",
