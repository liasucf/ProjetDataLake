In Uralungal, Kozhikode district, where few people are living without jobs and wages, few villagers reached the temple complex at Puthalath in Mahi to hear the discourse of Vagbhatananda Guru. Impressed by the Guru's talk, who shared the Renaissance ideas, they invited Vagbhadananda to their homeland. In 1917, Palery formed a spiritual school under the leadership of a guru who arrived in Karakkad region of Uralungal. No one in the country was given a job. The young men approached the Guru with sarcasm. The Guru said that this should not hinder the progress of the proceedings and suggested a simple solution. Start a co-operative group by organizing young people who are willing to work. Thus, on 13 February 1925, the Unemployed Mutual Assistance Group of Mercantile Workers registered a co- operative group called Umballa. This is the story behind the birth of the Uralunkal Labor Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS), which has transformed the face of Kerala by building major over bridges, highways and flyovers. The name of the village of Uralungal, a village in North Malabar, which no one knows about, was signed by Vagbhatanandan, one of the lamps of the Kerala Renaissance. The work undertaken by the Uralungal Society, in the beginning, was the construction of a fence, a small wall, and a well. The Guru had already strictly stated that the aim was not to make a profit. The ULCC says that these workers are the beneficiaries of today's upliftment, ensuring quality, free of corruption and discipline. Says Chairman Palleri Ramesan. It was a time when the railways were stranded on 12 of Malabar's national highways. Until then, the ULCCSS had been confined to the Vadakara taluk and adjoining areas, taking only minor road contracts. The contract for the road to the Chorodu overbridge on the Vadakara-Thalassery highway was taken. At the time, the firm did not have the necessary equipment and equipment to perform the big contract work. The undertaking of a six crore construction project in 1999 was a turning point in the growth of the company. This public company, which did not even have its engineer, completed its work in due time and good standing. All began to know the name of Uralungal. The movement did not have to seek contract work again. A large number of government and private sector construction workers came to Uralungal. To ensure quality and punctuality, the job has become a hiring process. Uralungal was also responsible for acquiring some private companies and completing ten-fifteen years' worth of work that was halfway completed. == UN recognition == The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has selected Uralungal as the model co-operative group for implementation. Uralungal's achievements are shown around the world in the UN documentary. Uralungal has been honoured by the International Co-operative Alliance. The Uralungal Labor Contract Co-operative Society is the only Indian co-operative society to be a member of this international organization. ==References== Category:Worker cooperatives Category:1925 establishments in India ",
