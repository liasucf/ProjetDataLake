In 2014 Bochenek became Director of the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), the research and development arm of the Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy. NETL is a national laboratory focusing on efficient and sustainable use of fossil fuels, including carbon capture. She cited the security aspects of energy when discussing her move from Defense to Energy, and encouraged students to specialize in engineering and sciences. She advocated for greater collaboration between the laboratory and outside companies, saying that energy is more subject to market forces than defense. She was named the acting United States Secretary of Energy on January 20, 2017, following the resignation of Ernest Moniz at the conclusion of the Obama Administration.
