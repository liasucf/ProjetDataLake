Akinmusire composed all but three tracks, including jazz standard \"Stablemates\" by saxophonist Benny Golson. The album is dedicated to Akinmusire's mother, Cora. ==Reception== John Barron of All About Jazz stated, \"On Prelude: to Cora, trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire offers a wide-open musical perspective, inviting a wealth of influences to shape a personalized approach to improvisation and composition. Akinmusire seems content with allowing the music to fall where it may; eschewing trends and any pre-conceived notions about what is expected from a debut recording.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Ambrose Akinmusire \u2013 trumpet *Walter Smith III \u2013 tenor saxophone *Aaron Parks \u2013 piano *Chris Dingman \u2013 vibraphone *Joe Sanders \u2013 bass *Justin Brown \u2013 drums Guests *Junko Watanabe \u2013 vocals (tracks: 1 5 7) *Logan Richardson \u2013 alto sax (tracks: 5 9) Production *Andy Taub \u2013 engineer *Dave Darlington \u2013 mastering, mixing *Alicia Vergel De Dios \u2013 artwork, design *Jordi Pujol \u2013 executive producer ==References== ==External links== * Category:2008 debut albums Category:Ambrose Akinmusire albums ",
