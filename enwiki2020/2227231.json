A medium-sized town, Nagua's economy relies on the production of agricultural products, principally rice, coconuts, and cocoa bean. Located on the north of the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula, Nagua lies on the highway leading from Puerto Plata to the city of Saman\u00e1. Most of the town lies below sea level, which some believe makes Nagua susceptible to flooding that could destroy a substantial part of the town. In fact, during the reign of Rafael Trujillo (1930\u20131961), the neighboring town of Matanza, also below sea level, was destroyed by flooding caused by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake, in 1946. Many residents of Matanza chose to resettle in the area that is now Nagua. Matanza is now a small town called Matancita, just south of the city limits of Nagua. ==Climate== ==Notables== *Baltimore Orioles pitcher Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez was born in Nagua. *Oakland Athletics pitcher Jordan Norberto was born in Nagua. *St. Louis Cardinals utilityman Yairo Mu\u00f1oz was born in Nagua. *Cieguito de Nagua Bartolo Alvarado was a musician known for playing merengue and bachata. *Nolito de Nagua Chap was a musician known for playing Haitian music. *Tatico Henriquez which some consider to be the godfather of merengue tipico. == References == Category:Populated places in Mar\u00eda Trinidad S\u00e1nchez Province Category:Municipalities of the Dominican Republic ",
