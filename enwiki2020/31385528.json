In the 2013\u201314 season they gained promotion into the National League 3 South West which is level five of the English rugby union system although they are currently in South West 1 East. The Director of Rugby is Stuart Wells and the Head Coach is Pete Davies. ==History== The club was formed in 1996 following the merger of Oxford Marathons and Oxford Old Boys rugby clubs. Oxford Harlequins are now the leading club in the City of Oxford taking over from Oxford R.F.C. who now play in the Berks, Bucks and Oxon Championship. ==Current situation== In 2015 a possible merger between Oxford RFC and Oxford Harlequins failed to materialise and the Harlequins moved their matches to Marston Ferry Road. In 2018 Oxford Harlequins moved from Marston Ferry Road to Horspath Sports Ground following the grant of a 30-year lease on the ground from Oxford City Council and the decision by the RFU to invest over \u00a3750,000 to build a new floodlit artificial turf rugby pitch at the new site. The 1st XV currently plays in the South West Division. Training is on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and matches are played on Saturdays throughout the season.
