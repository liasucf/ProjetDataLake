    "text": "Pontia is a genus of pierid butterflies. They are found in the Holarctic, but are rare in Europe and central to eastern North America, and a few species range into the Afrotropics. Several East Asian species once placed here are now more often split off in Sinopieris. Like the closely related genus Pieris, they are commonly called whites. ==Species== Listed alphabetically:Pontia funet.fi * Pontia beckerii (Edwards, 1871) \u2013 Becker's white, Great Basin white, or sagebrush white * Pontia callidice (H\u00fcbner, 1799-1800) \u2013 peak white * Pontia chloridice (H\u00fcbner, 1808-1813) \u2013 small Bath white * Pontia daplidice (Linnaeus, 1758) \u2013 Bath white * Pontia distorta (Butler, 1886) \u2013 small meadow white * Pontia edusa (Fabricius, 1777) \\- eastern Bath white * Pontia glauconome (Klug, 1829) \u2013 desert (Bath) white * Pontia helice (Linnaeus, 1764) \u2013 meadow white * Pontia occidentalis (Reakirt, 1866) \u2013 western white * Pontia protodice (Boisduval & Le Conte, 1830) \u2013 checkered white * Pontia sisymbrii (Boisduval, 1852) \u2013 spring white, California white, or Colorado white Some other species are occasionally placed here, but alternatively in other genera.
