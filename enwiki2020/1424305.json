    "text": "The 1907 British Columbia general election was the eleventh general election for the Province of British Columbia, Canada. It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. The election called on December 24, 1906, and held on February 2, 1907. The new legislature met for the first time on March 7, 1907. The governing Conservative party won a second term in government, with almost half the popular vote, and a majority of the seats in the legislature, increasing its number of seats by 4 to 26. The Liberal Party lost 4 seats in the legislature, despite winning about the same share of the popular vote that it had in the 1903 election. The Socialist Party won one additional seat to bring its total to three. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1903 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change |Conservative 1 |align=\"center\"|Richard McBride |align=\"right\"|42 |align=\"right\"|22 |align=\"right\"|26 |align=\"right\"|+18.2% |align=\"right\"|30,781 |align=\"right\"| 48.70% |align=\"right\"|+2.27% |Liberal |align=\"center\"|James Alexander MacDonald |align=\"right\"|40 |align=\"right\"|17 |align=\"right\"|13 |align=\"right\"| -23.5% |align=\"right\"|23,481 |align=\"right\"| 37.15% |align=\"right\"| -0.63% |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|20 |align=\"right\"|2 |align=\"right\"|3 |align=\"right\"| +50.0% |align=\"right\"|5,603 |align=\"right\"| 8.87% |align=\"right\"| +0.91% |Canadian Labour 2 |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|6 |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|-100% |align=\"right\"|2,495 |align=\"right\"| 3.95% |align=\"right\"| -3.41% | colspan=\"2\"|Independent Labour3 |align=\"right\"|2 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|487 |align=\"right\"| 0.77% |align=\"right\"| - | colspan=\"2\"|Independent Socialist |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|211 |align=\"right\"|0.33% |align=\"right\"| * | colspan=\"2\"|Independent |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|147 |align=\"right\"| 0.23% |align=\"right\"| * |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"|112 !align=\"right\"|42 !align=\"right\"|42 !align=\"right\"| - !align=\"right\"|63,205 !align=\"right\"|100% | |- | align=\"center\" colspan=\"10\"|Sources: Elections BC |- |} Notes: * Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election. 1 One Conservative candidate, R. McBride, who contested and was elected in both Dewdney and Victoria City, is counted twice. 2 Organized in 1906. Not the same as the Canadian Labour Party of B.C. which contested the 1924 election. Sometimes referred to as \"Independent Labour Party\" by the newspapers which creates some confusion with the situation in Nanaimo City and Newcastle. 3 Although the candidates in Nanaimo City and Newcastle called themselves \"Independent Labour\" candidates, the Conservative press described them as \"Liberal-Labour\" candidates. They did have Liberal support in both cases and no Liberals were nominated for either District. They were also repudiated by the Victoria branch of the Canadian Labour Party of BC. ==Results by riding== |- || |align=\"center\" |Henry Esson Young |align=\"center\" |Atlin Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Alberni Liberal |align=\"center\"|Harlan Carey Brewster || |- || |align=\"center\"|Robert Grant |align=\"center\" |Comox Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Cariboo Liberal |align=\"center\"|Harry Jones || |- || |align=\"center\"|Richard McBride 1 Premier |align=\"center\" |Dewdney Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Cariboo Liberal |align=\"center\"|John MacKay Yorston || |- || |align=\"center\"|Henry George Parson |align=\"center\" |Columbia Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Chilliwhack Liberal |align=\"center\"|Charles William Munro || |- || |align=\"center\"|William Henry Hayward |align=\"center\" |Cowichan Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Esquimalt Liberal |align=\"center\"|John Jardine || |- || |align=\"center\"|William Roderick Ross |align=\"center\" |Fernie Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Lillooet Liberal |align=\"center\"|Mark Robert Eagleson || |- || |align=\"center\"|Albert Edward McPhillips |align=\"center\" |The Islands Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Nelson City Liberal |align=\"center\"|George Arthur Benjamin Hall || |- || |align=\"center\"|Frederick John Fulton |align=\"center\" |Kamloops Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Cranbrook Liberal |align=\"center\"|James Horace King || |- || |align=\"center\"|Neil Franklin MacKay |align=\"center\" |Kaslo Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Delta Liberal |align=\"center\"|John Oliver || |- || |align=\"center\"|Thomas Gifford |align=\"center\" |New Westminster City Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Greenwood Liberal |align=\"center\"|George Ratcliffe Naden || |- || |align=\"center\"|Price Ellison |align=\"center\" |Okanagan Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |The Islands Liberal |align=\"center\"|Thomas Wilson Paterson || |- || |align=\"center\"|Thomas Taylor |align=\"center\" |Revelstoke Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Skeena Liberal |align=\"center\"|William Thomas Kergin || |- || |align=\"center\"|Francis Lovett Carter-Cotton |align=\"center\" |Richmond Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Yale Liberal |align=\"center\"|Stuart Alexander Henderson || |- || |align=\"center\"|David McEwen Eberts |align=\"center\" |Saanich Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Grand Forks Socialist |align=\"center\"|John McInnis || |- || |align=\"center\"|Lytton Wilmot Shatford |align=\"center\" |Similkameen Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Nanaimo City Socialist |align=\"center\"|James Hurst Hawthornthwaite || |- || |align=\"center\"|William Hunter |align=\"center\" |Slocan Conservative || || |align=\"center\" |Newcastle Socialist |align=\"center\"|Parker Williams || |- || |align=\"center\"|Charles William John Bowser |align=\"center\" rowspan=5 |Vancouver City Conservative || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|James Ford Garden || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|Alexander Henry Boswell MacGowan || |- || |align=\"center\"|George Albert McGuire || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|Robert Garnett Tatlow || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|Henry Frederick William Behnsen |align=\"center\" rowspan=4 |Victoria City Conservative || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|Frederick Davey || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|Richard McBride 1 Premier || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|Henry Broughton Thomson || |- |- || |align=\"center\"|James Hargrave Schofield |align=\"center\" |Ymir Conservative || |- | |align-left\"|1 Elected simultaneously in Dewdney and Victoria City. | | | |- | align=\"center\" colspan=\"10\"|Source: Elections BC |- |} ==See also== *List of British Columbia political parties *Richard McBride ==Further reading & references== *In the Sea of Sterile Mountains: The Chinese in British Columbia, Joseph Morton, J.J.
