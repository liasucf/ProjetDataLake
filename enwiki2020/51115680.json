    "text": "The 2017 World Men's Curling Championship (branded as Ford World Men's Curling Championship 2017 for sponsorship reasons) was a curling event that was held from April 1 to 9 at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton, Alberta. Canada won the title for the 36th time overall and the second consecutive year. Like Rachel Homan's team at the women's tournament, Brad Gushue and his teammates finished with a perfect 13\u20130 record, which included defeating eventual runner-up Niklas Edin of Sweden three times. Switzerland won the bronze medal. With the win, Gushue became the first skip in the history of the sport to win the world junior title, the Olympic gold medal, and the world men's title, and Canada became the first country ever to be in simultaneous possession of Olympic and World championships in both men's and women's curling. ==Qualification== The following nations qualified to participate in the 2017 World Men's Curling Championship: * (host country) *One team from the Americas zone ** (winner of the 2017 Americas Challenge) *Eight teams from the 2016 European Curling Championships ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** (winner of the World Challenge Games) *Two teams from the 2016 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships ** ** ==Teams== {| class=wikitable |- !width=200| !width=200| !width=200| |- |Bally Haly G&CC; & St. John's CC, St. John's Skip: Brad Gushue Third: Mark Nichols Second: Brett Gallant Lead: Geoff Walker Alternate: Thomas Sallows |Harbin CC, Harbin Skip: Liu Rui Third: Xu Xiaoming Second: Ba Dexin Lead: Zang Jialiang Alternate: Zou Qiang |Baden Hills G&CC;, Rheinm\u00fcnster Skip: Alexander Baumann Third: Manuel Walter Second: Daniel Herberg Lead: Ryan Sherrard Alternate: Sebastian Schweizer |- !width=200| !width=200| !width=200| |- |A.S.D.
