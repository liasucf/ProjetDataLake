    "text": "The Germany national basketball team ( or Die Mannschaft) represents Germany in international basketball competition. They are organized by the German Basketball Federation (Deutscher Basketball Bund), the governing body for basketball in Germany. Currently, Germany is ranked 18th in the FIBA World Rankings.FIBA.com \u2013 FIBA World Ranking for men Germany's biggest achievements to date have been competing in 24 appearances at the EuroBasket winning the gold in 1993 (on home soil), and silver in 2005 respectively. Germany has also made six appearances at the World Cup, with their best finish coming in 2002, when the national team won bronze. ==History== The team is the successor of the West Germany national basketball team, that represented West Germany in international competition. Between 1955 and 1973, Germany temporarily competed with an East German national basketball team as well. ===EuroBasket 1951=== The first German presence in the European Basketball Championship was at EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. West Germany finished the preliminary round with a 1\u20132 record, finishing in third place in their group. They were again 1\u20132 in the first classification round, but this combined with a three-way tie-breaker put them second in that group. They then lost the classification 9th\u201312th place game and the 11th/12th game to finish in 12th place in the then 18 team tournament ===EuroBasket 1953=== West Germany competed again at the EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow. Their 1\u20132 record in preliminary pool play put them third in their four-team group, relegating them to the classification rounds. In the first round, they again finished in 3rd place with a 1\u20132 record. They then beat Lebanon 58\u201356 in the 13th\u201316th place semifinals to advance to the 13th/14th place game, in which they were defeated by Romania. ===EuroBasket 1955=== At the EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest, West Germany again was 1\u20132 in the preliminary round, taking third place in the four-team group to be relegated to the classification tournament. They won one game in the first classification round, losing 3 to take fifth place of the five-team group despite having scored exactly as many points as their opponents over the course of the four games. Their final game was a match-up against Denmark for 17th place, which West Germany won 51\u201349. ===EuroBasket 1957=== West Germany competed in Sofia for the EuroBasket 1957. They had no success in the preliminary round, losing all three decisions. They were relegated to the classification round, in which they were able to gather a few victories. They finished the round in the fifth position at 3\u20134, taking 13th place overall. ===A \"new\" competitor=== At the EuroBasket 1959, East Germany's national basketball team entered the tournament when their counterpart from West Germany did not qualify. Altogether, East Germany's team only qualified for the EuroBasket five times. ===After German reunification === Until the German reunification in 1990, the team played as the West Germany national basketball team. In decades of competitive basketball, West Germany only had moderate success with a few strong showings in the 1980s. This was because in that time, the NBA made it near-impossible for German internationals to play on both their NBA teams and the national team. For this reason, important players like Detlef Schrempf, Uwe Blab or Christian Welp often were unavailable in big tournaments. ===An unexpected title=== The win of the 1993 edition of the European Basketball Championship at home in Germany, thanks to superb clutch play of tournament MVP Welp (who had returned from the USA),\"Germany hero Welp dies at 51\", fiba.com, 2 March 2015, Retrieved 16 Feb 2016. came totally unexpected. The team won the election to \"Team of the Year\" by the German press. There was a huge wave of enthusiasm, but arguably due to lack of infrastructure and professionalism, tangible results were rare. German basketball stayed in the shadows, the next generation of youth shunning the native league while being glued to the NBA with Michael Jordan. For the next three EuroBaskets, the national team did not come close to repeating the success. Dirk Nowitzki helped Germany to compete among the world elite. ===The Nowitzki era=== But then, German basketball got a lucky break when a lanky youth named Dirk Nowitzki tried his luck with the Dallas Mavericks and became a superstar. He created new enthusiasm for basketball in Germany, and in his slipstream, the national team had a renaissance.Sneed, Earl K., \"Dirk Nowitzki chooses to play for German national team in EuroBasket 2015\", Mavs.com, 4 June 2015. Retrieved 23 Nov 2015. In 2001, Germany played Turkey and was one second away from the final, when Turkey nailed a buzzer beater to send the game into overtime.\"GAME REPORT - TURKEY GERMANY\", fibaeurope.com, Retrieved 10 Dec 2015. Turkey won, and demoralized Germany lost the third-place match and ended fourth. However, success at last came in 2002, when Nowitzki inspired Germany to win the bronze medal at the 2002 World Cup. Nowitzki was also named MVP of the tournament One year later, however, the team suffered its worst setback in years. In the EuroBasket 2003, which was also the qualifier for the 2004 Olympic Games, the talented, but inexperienced team blundered through a tournament, blowing late-game leads with appalling anti-clutch play. Germany was eliminated early and failed to qualify for the Olympics. Before the EuroBasket 2005, expectations were not too high. The German roster was depleted by injury, and remembering the disaster of two years ago, nobody dared to dream of a medal. However, an inspired Dirk Nowitzki powered the team into the finals, eliminating favorites like Spain and Slovenia on its way. In the finals, the team was blown out by Greece, but Nowitzki was named MVP again, and the team won the election to \"Team of the Year\" by the German press again. At the 2006 World Cup in Saitama, Germany won most of its first-round matches, only losing to Spain. In the knock-out phase, Germany fought a tough match versus underdogs Nigeria, ending in a 78\u201377 win when Nigerian star Ime Udoka missed a last-second layup. In the quarter-finals, Germany played top favorite USA, and managed to play an excellent first half, trailing only 39\u201341. However, led by Carmelo Anthony, the USA outplayed Germany 20\u20138 in the third quarter and won 65\u201385. In the consolation round, Germany lost 73\u201375 against France, losing a lead in the last 18 seconds with two turnovers. Germany qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing by taking the final spot with the third place in the qualification tournament in Athens, Greece. ===Nowitzki's later years and retirement=== Two years later, Germany qualified for the 2010 World Cup as a wild card. They were eliminated from the competition following an overtime game with Angola, and would finish with a 2\u20133 record, beating Serbia and Jordan. At the EuroBasket 2011, Germany qualified for the second round with wins over Israel, Italy and Latvia, but in the second round they only managed a win over Turkey, losing to Spain and Lithuania, and failed to reach the knockout stage. Nowitzki competed in both these tournaments and announced his retirement from the team following the 2011 EuroBasket. In 2015, Dennis Schr\u00f6der became Germany's leading player. Following an unbeaten qualifying campaign, Germany participated in EuroBasket 2013. Drawn in Group A, they kicked off the tournament with a surprise win over France (who would later go on to win the tournament), but then suffered losses to Ukraine, Belgium and Great Britain, the latter two eliminating them from contention. They won their final game over Israel 80-76 but it was not enough, France, Ukraine and Belgium qualified from the group. ===Nowitzki's return=== Germany then qualified for the next edition of the EuroBasket in 2015, despite a turbulent qualification which saw two defeats to Poland. In September, following qualification, Germany was announced as one of the four new hosts of the tournament following the relocation from Ukraine. In the same month, Dirk Nowitzki announced that he would come out of retirement to play for the team in this tournament. The team was drawn into the Group B, seen by many as the \"Group of Death\", with Spain, Italy, Turkey, Serbia and Iceland. In the end the team put up an competitive effort in defeat. Ending the tournament with a 1\u20134 record, with all their loses by single digits. ===EuroBasket 2017=== EuroBasket 2017 was the first tournament after Dirk Nowitzki went back into retirement from international play. The national team surprised many with their best performance at the EuroBasket since 2005. Led by rising star Dennis Schr\u00f6der, they finished second in their preliminary round group with victories against Ukraine, Georgia, and Italy. Their 3\u20132 record was enough to move on to the knockout stage. There, they pulled an upset against France in a hard-fought tussle 84\u201381. The next game the team came up short, falling to the eventual bronze medalist Spain 84\u201372. While the team didn't finish the way they wanted, the stellar efforts of Schr\u00f6der stood out. Who finished the tournament second in scoring for the second consecutive EuroBasket, this time at (23.7 ppg). ===EuroBasket 2021=== Germany will co- host the EuroBasket 2021, and they have automatically qualified for the 2021 tournament. It will make it the twenty-fifth successive time that Germany has qualified for the event overall. Berlin will host a few group phase matches and will host the final phase matches, while Cologne will host several group phase matches as well. ==Competitive record== ===FIBA World Cup=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|World Cup !rowspan=22| !colspan=3|Qualification |- !Year !Position !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- | 1950||colspan=4 rowspan=9|Did not qualify |- | 1954 |- | 1959 |- | 1963 |- | 1967 |- | 1970 |- | 1974 |- | 1978 |- | 1982 |- | 1986||13th||5||3||2 |6||4||2 |- | 1990||colspan=4|Did not qualify |colspan=3 rowspan=7| |- | 1994||12th||8||5||3 |- | 1998||colspan=4|Did not qualify |- | 2002||bgcolor=#cc9966|||bgcolor=#cc9966|9||bgcolor=#cc9966|6||bgcolor=#cc9966|3 |- | 2006||8th||9||5||4 |- | 2010||17th||5||2||3 |- | 2014||colspan=4|Did not qualify |- | 2019||18th||5||3||2 |12||9||3 |- | 2023||colspan=4|To be determined |colspan=3|To be determined |- !Total!!6/18!!41!!24!!17!!18!!13!!5 |} ===Olympic Games=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font- size:90%;\" !colspan=5|Olympic Games !rowspan=23| !colspan=3|Qualifying |- !Year !Position !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 1936 |15th||4||1||3 |colspan=4 rowspan=4| |- | 1948||colspan=4 rowspan=6|Did not qualify |- | 1952 |- | 1956 |- | 1960 |5||3||2 |- | 1964 |colspan=3| |- | 1968 |7||1||6 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 1972||12th||9||3||6 |colspan=4 rowspan=2| |- | 1976||colspan=4 rowspan=2|Did not qualify |- | 1980 |9||4||5 |- | 1984||8th||8||2||6 |9||5||4 |- | 1988||colspan=4|Did not qualify |10||4||6 |- | 1992||7th||8||3||5 |11||7||4 |- | 1996||colspan=4 rowspan=3|Did not qualify |colspan=3 rowspan=3| |- | 2000 |- | 2004 |- | 2008||10th||5||1||4 |5||4||1 |- | 2012||colspan=4 rowspan=2|Did not qualify |- | 2016 |- | 2020||colspan=4|To be determined || || || |- !Total!!5/19!!34!!10!!24!!56!!28!!28 |} ===EuroBasket=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|EuroBasket !rowspan=44| !colspan=3|Qualification |- !Year !Position !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- | 1935||colspan=4 rowspan=6|Did not enter |colspan=3 rowspan=12| |- | 1937 |- | 1939 |- | 1946 |- | 1947 |- | 1949 |- | 1951||12th||8||3||5 |- | 1953||14th||8||3||5 |- | 1955||17th||8||3||5 |- | 1957||13th||10||3||7 |- | 1959||colspan=4|Did not enter |- | 1961||16th ||6||1||5 |- | 1963||colspan=4|Did not qualify |4||1||3 |- | 1965||14th ||9||2||7 |3||2||1 |- | 1967||colspan=4 rowspan=2|Did not qualify |3||1||2 |- | 1969 |4||1||3 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 1971||9th ||7||3||4 |colspan=3| |- | 1973||colspan=4 rowspan=4|Did not qualify |10||6||4 |- | 1975 |5||3||2 |- | 1977 |5||2||3 |- | 1979 |5||2||3 |- | 1981||10th||8||2||6 |8||6||2 |- | 1983||8th ||7||3||4 |9||6||3 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 1985||5th||8||5||3 |colspan=3 rowspan=2| |- | 1987||6th||8||4||4 |- | 1989||colspan=4 rowspan=2|Did not qualify |6||1||5 |- | 1991 |10||4||6 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 1993||bgcolor=gold|||bgcolor=gold|9||bgcolor=gold|6||bgcolor=gold|3 |colspan=3 rowspan=2| |- | 1995||10th||6||1||5 |- | 1997||12th||8||1||7 |10||7||3 |- | 1999||7th||9||4||5 |10||7||3 |- | 2001||4th||7||4||3 |colspan=3| |- | 2003||9th ||4||2||2 |10||9||1 |- | 2005||bgcolor=silver|||bgcolor=silver|7||bgcolor=silver|5||bgcolor=silver|2 |6||6||0 |- | 2007||9th||9||5||4 |colspan=3 rowspan=3| |- | 2009||11th||6||1||5 |- | 2011||9th||8||4||4 |- | 2013||17th||5||2||3 |8||8||0 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 2015||18th||5||1||4 |colspan=3| |- | 2017||6th||7||4||3 |6||4||2 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 2021 |colspan=4|Qualified as co-host |colspan=3|Qualified as co-host |- !Total!!24/40!!177!!72!!105!!122 !!76 !!46 |} ==Results and fixtures== ===EuroBasket 2021 Qualifiers=== ====Group G==== ==Team== ===Current roster=== Roster for the EuroBasket 2021 Qualifiers matches played on 21 and 24 February 2020 against France and Great Britain. ====Depth chart==== ===International influence=== In Germany, professional basketball is known for developing players whose parents or grandparents are immigrants. The national team routinely uses many players who have family roots in Africa, Eastern Europe, United States or others, but have grown up in Germany, speak fluent German and are native Germans by law. The last point is especially important, as the new FIBA rules prevent the use of more than one \"naturalized\" citizen per country. Famous examples of these allochthonous players are: *African-German: Stephen Arigbabu, Misan Nikagbatse, Ademola Okulaja, Dennis Schr\u00f6der, Marvin Willoughby, Maodo L\u00f4 *American-German: Shawn Bradley, Robert Garrett, Stefano Garris, Demond Greene, Elias Harris, Frank Hudson, Chris Kaman, Patrick King, Mike Kn\u00f6rr, James Marsh, Christopher McNaughton, Jens-Uwe Gordon *Brazilian- German: Dominik Bahiense de Mello *Canadian-German: Michael Jackel *Croatian- German: Stipo Papi\u0107, Dra\u017ean Tomi\u0107 *Polish-German: Konrad Wysocki *Serbian- German: Vladimir Bogojevi\u0107, Marko Pe\u0161i\u0107 *Turkish-German: Teoman \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, Mithat Demirel While most German players develop through the club system, several players over the years have played U.S. college basketball. Past and present national team players who have done so include: * Uwe Blab \u2013 Indiana * Shawn Bradley \u2013 BYU (born in Germany, was raised in Utah, making a college basketball career a natural progression) * Patrick Femerling \u2013 Washington * Niels Giffey \u2013 UConn * Hansi Gnad \u2013 Alaska-Anchorage (Division II Program) * Elias Harris \u2013 Gonzaga * Johannes Herber \u2013 West Virginia * Frank Hudson \u2013 Glassboro State/NAIA (born in Germany) * Jan-Hendrik Jagla \u2013 Penn State * Patrick King \u2013 Bucknell * Moritz Kleine-Brockhoff \u2013 UH M\u0101noa * Mike Kn\u00f6rr \u2013 East TEXAS STATE * Alexander K\u00fchl \u2013 UNC Charlotte * Jens Kujawa \u2013 Illinois * J\u00fcrgen Malbeck \u2013 Hawai\u02bbi Pacific/NAIA * James Marsh \u2013 Davidson * Rolf Mayr \u2013 Duquesne * Christopher McNaughton \u2013 Bucknell * Sven Meyer \u2013 Oregon * Mathis M\u00f6nninghoff \u2013 Gonzaga * Detlef Musch \u2013 Davidson * Arnd Neuhaus \u2013 Duquesne * Kai N\u00fcrnberger \u2013 Southern Illinois * Ademola Okulaja \u2013 North Carolina * Michael Pappert \u2013 Redlands (Division III) * Ulrich Peters a.k.a.
