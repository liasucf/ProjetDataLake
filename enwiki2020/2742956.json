    "text": "La Chienne (The Bitch) is a 1931 French film by director Jean Renoir. It is the second sound film by the director and the twelfth film of his career. The literal English translation of the film's title is \"The Bitch\", although the movie was never released under this title. It is often referred to in English as Isn't Life a Bitch? The film was remade by Fritz Lang in the United States as Scarlet Street (1945). La Chienne was released by The Criterion Collection on both Blu-ray and DVD, newly restored in 4K, on 14 June 2016. ==Plot== Maurice Legrand (Michel Simon), a meek cashier and aspirant painter, is miserably married to Ad\u00e8le, an abusive woman who mistreats him. After a celebration in the company where he works, Maurice stumbles upon a man called Andr\u00e9 \"D\u00e9d\u00e9\" Jauguin (Georges Flamant) hitting a young woman called Lucienne \"Lulu\" Pelletier (Janie Mar\u00e8se) on the street. Maurice protects Lulu and brings her home. Lulu, who is a prostitute, tells the naive Maurice that D\u00e9d\u00e9 is her brother, but D\u00e9d\u00e9 is actually her pimp. Maurice rents an apartment for Lulu and she becomes his mistress. Soon he brings his paintings to the apartment, since his wife Ad\u00e8le intends to throw them away. But D\u00e9d\u00e9 sells the paintings to an art dealer for a large amount, telling the dealer that Lulu had painted them using the alias Clara Wood. When Maurice stumbles upon Ad\u00e8le's former husband who was supposedly killed in the War, he plots a scheme to get rid of Ad\u00e8le. He succeeds in his intent, only to discover Lulu and D\u00e9d\u00e9 in bed during the night. Shocked, he leaves, but returns in the morning to talk to Lulu. She confesses that she loves D\u00e9d\u00e9 and humiliates Maurice, saying that the only reason she stayed with him was his money. Maurice attacks her with a knife and leaves the apartment with no witnesses. D\u00e9d\u00e9 arrives moments later and discovers Lulu's body. D\u00e9d\u00e9 is blamed for Lulu's death owing to his reputation, and he is executed. Maurice becomes a vagrant. ==Cast (in credits order)== *Michel Simon as Maurice Legrand *Janie Mar\u00e8se as Lucienne 'Lulu' Pelletier *Georges Flamant as Andr\u00e9 'D\u00e9d\u00e9' Jauguin *Magdeleine B\u00e9rubet as Ad\u00e8le Legrand *Roger Gaillard as Sergeant Alexis Godard *Jean Gehret as Dugodet *Alexandre Rignault as Langelarde *Lucien Mancini as Wallstein *Marcel Courmes as Colonel *Max Dalban as Bernard *Henri Guisol as Am\u00e9d\u00e9e *Romain Bouquet as Henriot *Pierre Desty as Gustave *Jane Pierson as the Concierge *Christian Argentin as Examining judge *Sylvain Itkine as D\u00e9d\u00e9's lawyer *Colette Borelli as Lily *Marthe Doryans as Yvonne ==Production and aftermath== In the film Michel Simon falls in love with Janie Mar\u00e8se, and he did off-screen as well, while Mar\u00e8se fell for Georges Flamant, who plays the pimp. Renoir and producer Pierre Braunberger had encouraged the relationship between Flamant and Mar\u00e8se in order to get the fullest conviction into their performances (La Chienne was Flamant's first acting experience). After the film had been completed Flamant, who could barely drive, took Mar\u00e8se for a drive, crashed the car and she was killed. At the funeral Michel Simon fainted and had to be supported as he walked past the grave. He threatened Renoir with a gun, saying that the death of Mar\u00e8se was all his fault. \"Kill me if you like\", responded Renoir, \"but I have made the film\".Richard Boston Boudu Saved from Drowning, 1994, London: BFI (FIlm Classics series), p.37-38 ==Home media== On 23 October 2003 La Chienne was released on DVD in France by Opening Distribution, along with Renoir's On purge b\u00e9b\u00e9 (1931), Tire-au-flanc (1928), and Catherine (1924), as part of a box set.
