    "text": "Drama is the ninth studio album by the British female vocal duo Bananarama. It features eleven newly recorded tracks, along with a remix of their 1986 smash hit \"Venus\" (done by Soft Cell's Marc Almond) and a 2005 remix of their 1982 hit \"Really Saying Something\", an underground bootleg club hit produced by Solasso. Drama is a comeback of sorts for Bananarama members Keren Woodward and Sara Dallin and is their first album to be released in their native UK since 1993. The album's first single \"Move in My Direction\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at Number 14, also becoming their first UK Top 40 hit since 1993. The second single, \"Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)\", also hit the UK Top 40, and climbed to Number 2 on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart as an import, becoming Bananarama's biggest US dancefloor hit since \"Venus\" two decades earlier. The album mostly incorporates pop and eurodance musical styles, with some synthpop elements. Drama charted at a number 169 in the UK. It was later released in the United States (both in retail stores and as digital downloads) in 2006. While the album performed well on Billboard's Top Electronic Albums chart, peaking at number 21, it did not chart on the Billboard 200, the US Pop Albums chart. ==Track listing== Original Edition # \"Move in My Direction\" \u2013 3:20 (S.
