The championship was held at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. West Virginia, with a team score of 6,166, won their first team title, finishing 18 points ahead of three-time defending champion Tennessee Tech. The Mountaineers were coached by Olympian Edward Etzel. The individual champions were, for the smallbore rifle, David Johnson (West Virginia) and, for the air rifle, Ray Slonena (Tennessee Tech). ==Qualification== Since there is only one national collegiate championship for rifle shooting, all NCAA rifle programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible.
