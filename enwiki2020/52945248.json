    "text": "Necrobarista is a 2020 visual novel game developed by Australian development studio Route 59. The player follows a cast of characters around a Melbourne back-alley coffeehouse staffed by necromancers, named the 'Terminal'. In the Terminal, the souls of the recently departed are given a final 24 hours to reside in the world alongside the living. The game was released on July 17, 2020 for macOS and iOS via Apple Arcade, and July 22, 2020 for Microsoft Windows. Necrobarista has upcoming ports for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch scheduled to release in 2021. ==Overview== Necrobarista is a visual novel set in a Melbourne coffee shop that serves both the living and dead, and is visited by gangsters, hipsters, and necromancers. Unlike the 2D art typical to the genre, it is presented through cinematic 3D sequences. ==Development and release== The game is developed by the Australian studio Route 59, using the Unity game engine. The visual style of the 3D cinematics was influenced by anime. The game was announced for release in October 2017 for Microsoft Windows and MacOS, but was delayed to July 22, 2020, with a Nintendo Switch version also planned for later release.http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/09/08/pax-west-2017-necrobarista- gives-the-visual-novel-a-caffeinated-kick/271076/ The composer for the project is Kevin Penkin. ==Reception== ===Pre-release=== In pre-release coverage, multiple critics praised the game's presentation. Nathan Grayson at Kotaku and Kyle LeClair at Hardcore Gamer both compared it to the Japanese developer Atlus's titles, with Grayson describing it as stylish and like Persona in a coffee shop, and LeClair saying that the anime-like aesthetics, the music and the atmosphere \"wouldn't seem out of place in a top-level Atlus game\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun Kate Gray said that the game looks \"so good you just want to eat [it]\", praising the sunset-like color palette used and comparing it to the visual style of the game Firewatch. Joel Couture of Siliconera called the art style \"striking\", with its use of 3D art rather than the traditional animation and static 2D images common to the visual novel genre. Gray, while noting that it was difficult to pinpoint the exact tone intended from just the trailer, also said that she liked the concept of a coffee shop visited by both the dead and the living, and LeClair said that the environment interaction and investigation shown in the trailer felt like they were setting up an interesting mystery. ==References== ==External links== * * Gameplay Trailer Category:2020 video games Category:MacOS games Category:Melbourne in fiction Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:Visual novels Category:Windows games Category:Apple Arcade games ",
