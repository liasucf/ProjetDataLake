The specific epithet, leucoclada, derives from two Greek words: leucos (white) and clados (shoot/sprout) which were combined to give leucocladus, - a, -um, describing the plant as having white shoots. ==Distribution== The range of A. leucoclada extends from south-eastern Queensland to the north coast, tablelands region, the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, the central coast, Hunter River valley and Pilliga scrub regions of New South Wales. It is mostly found as far south as Wagga and is often part of sclerophyll woodland communities growing in a variety of different habitats and soil types. ==See also== List of Acacia species ==References== leucoclada Category:Fabales of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Taxa named by Mary Tindale Category:Plants described in 1966 ",
