Most of the township became the city of Warren. ==History== The survey township forming the basis of the civil township, Township 1 North, Range 13 East, was initially part of Clinton Township (which was originally known as \"Huron Township\"). By an act of the Michigan Legislature on March 11, 1835, the townships of Hickory and Orange were set off from Clinton. Hickory then consisted survey township 1N13E, with the exception of the eastern row of sections, which were made part of Orange Township (later named Erin Township and that later became the cities of East Detroit, Roseville, Fraser, and St. Clair Shores. On April 2, 1838, the township name was changed from Hickory to \"Aba\" (sometimes misspelled \"Alba\") and was increased by the additions of sections 1 and 12. On March 26, 1839, the name was changed to \"Warren\".

Romig, s.v. \"Warren\". p. 582 The community that later became the Village of Warren, began to be settled about 1830, before the formation of Warren Township. It was at first known as \"Beebe's Corners\" after John L. Beebe, who operated the toll gate on the plank road that led to Detroit. Village of Warren, Michigan Historical Markers, accessed 2007-11-11 A Guide to Warren's History, City of Warren Historic District Commission, accessed 2007-11-11 However, Romig (s.v. \"Richmond\", p. 475) locates Beebe's Corners in the city of Richmond, Michigan, named after Erastus Beebe. The first landowner known to actually settle in the area is Charles Groesbeck in about 1830. He was soon joined by his brother Louis (the father of Michigan Governor Alex Groesbeck) and Charles Rivard. History of Warren, Warren Historical & Genealogical Society, accessed 2007-11-11 A strap iron railroad, one of the first of its kind in Michigan, connected the settlement with Utica to the north and with Detroit to the south. The settlement was situated on the line between sections 4 and 5, at the junction of what are now known as Chicago Road and Mound Road. Stewart, Map of Warren Township, circa 1875, p. 16 Geo. A.

Another settlement grew a few miles to the south of the village of Warren. This settlement incorporated as the village of Center Line in 1925. Center Line became a city in 1936 and was no longer part of Warren Township. On October 27, 1956, Governor G.
