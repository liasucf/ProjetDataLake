    "text": "\"The Last Thing on My Mind\" is a song written by American musician and singer- songwriter Tom Paxton in the early 1960s and recorded first by Paxton in 1964. It is based on the traditional lament song \"The Leaving of Liverpool\". The song was released on Paxton's 1964 album Ramblin' Boy, which was his first album released on Elektra Records. The song remains one of Paxton's best-known compositions. ==Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton version== \"The Last Thing on My Mind\" was covered by Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton and released as their debut duet single on October 30, 1967, by RCA Victor. Their version peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, the first of an almost uninterrupted string of top ten singles they would release over the next several years. ===Critical reception=== The single was well received by critics upon release. Billboard gave a positive review of the single, which said that Wagoner and Parton's \"initial outing should be a giant.\" They concluded by saying that \"the folk-oriented ballad...has much pop potential.\" In another positive review, Cashbox called the single \"a very effective updating of the contemporary folk ditty,\" with \"an appealing blending of voices\" which \"makes this a good bet for big chart honors.\" ===Commercial performance=== \"The Last Thing on My Mind\" debuted at number 70 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. It would eventually peak at number seven and spend a total of 17 weeks on the chart. The single's B-side, \"Love Is Worth Living\", was successful in Canada, peaking at number four on the RPM Country Singles chart. ===Track listing=== *7\" single (RCA Victor 47-9369) #\"The Last Thing on My Mind\" \u2013 2:34 #\"Love Is Worth Living\" \u2013 2:32 ===Personnel=== Adapted from RCA recording session records. *Jerry Carrigan \u2013 drums *Anita Carter \u2013 background vocals *Pete Drake \u2013 steel *Dolores Edgin \u2013 background vocals *Bob Ferguson \u2013 producer *Roy M.
