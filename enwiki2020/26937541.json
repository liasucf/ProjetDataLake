    "text": "\"I Beg Your Pardon\" (also titled as \"I Beg Your Pardon [I Never Promised You a Rose Garden]\") is the debut single by Canadian synthpop duo Kon Kan, from their 1988 debut album Move to Move. It was written by Kon Kan member Barry Harris, and American musician Joe South, who is credited due to the song's heavy sampling of \"Rose Garden\", which he wrote. As well as Lynn Anderson's 1970 hit \"Rose Garden\", \"I Beg Your Pardon\" also contains samples of other songs, including GQ's \"Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)\", Silver Convention's \"Get Up and Boogie\", and National Lampoon's \"Disco Hotline\" sketch from their That's Not Funny, That's Sick album. Recreated samples of Spagna's \"Call Me\" and the opening bars of the theme from the film The Magnificent Seven are also present in the song.https://www.whosampled.com/Kon-Kan/I-Beg-Your-Pardon/samples/ The song was a hit, reaching the top twenty in a number of countries including the UK and U.S., where it peaked at numbers 5 and 15, respectively. Barry Harris said that the song was \"the question to Lynn Anderson's 'Rose Garden' answer.\" It was Harris' first studio project, and was initially released on an unknown independent record label in Toronto. ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1988\u201389) !Peak position |- |Australian Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|100 |- |Canada Top Singles (RPM)RPM Top Singles - March 27, 1989, p.6 RPM Magazine | style=\"text- align:center;\"|19 |- |Dutch Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |German Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 |- |New Zealand Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |- |UK Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|5 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|15 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play |align=\"center\"|3 |} ==References== Category:1988 debut singles Category:Kon Kan songs Category:Songs written by Joe South Category:1988 songs Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Juno Award for Dance Recording of the Year recordings ",
