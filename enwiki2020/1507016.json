It is found in open lowland and wooded areas with moist soils along the Pacific coast from southwestern British Columbia to northwestern California. This animal's total range in Canada is estimated to be 20 km\u00b2 (). Townsend's mole is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN; however, in Canada it is considered an endangered species. This animal has velvety black fur, a pointed snout and a short, thick, a tail with barely any hair. It is about in length including a tail, and weighs about . Its front paws are broad and spade-shaped, specialized for digging; the rear paws are smaller. It has 44 teeth. Its ears are not visible and it has small eyes. It is similar in appearance to the smaller coast mole. This mole spends most of its time underground, foraging in shallow burrows for earthworms, small invertebrates and plant material. It is active year-round. This animal is mainly solitary except during mating in late winter. The female has a litter of two to four young in a deep burrow. This animal was named after the American naturalist John Kirk Townsend. The name was selected at the request of Thomas Nuttall as a patronym to honor Townsend's contribution. ==References== Footnotes: Sources: * * Category:Talpidae Category:Mammals of North America Category:Mammals described in 1839 Category:Taxa named by John Bachman ",
