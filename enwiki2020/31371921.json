It is the summit of the island's inactive central shield volcano, Mount Waialeale. Other peaks on Kauai include: Waialeale (5,148 feet), Namolokama Mountain (4,421 feet), Kalalau Lookout (4,120 feet), Keanapuka Mountain (4,120 feet), Haupu (2,297 feet) and Nounou (1,241 feet). == Description == A rain gauge placed on the nearby Waialeale lake records daily rainfallhttp://waterdata.usgs.gov/hi/nwis/uv?dd_cd=01\u2146_cd=01&format;=gif.=31&site;_no=220427159300201 and regularly lands Kauai's peaks on the National Climatic Data Center's list of places averaging the highest annual rainfall.http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html#highpre This high rainfall makes reaching the summit difficult on most days. The rain is not the only barrier to reaching Kawaikini. The Alakai Wilderness Preserve is located to the west and its miles of dense, swampy forest limit access to the summit. To the north, east, and south, Kawaikini is protected by steep, wet cliffs.Nelson, D., et al. (2006). The Conquest of Kauai - Five Days to Kawaikini. (www.cohp.org/hi/Kauai_2.pdf) == Etymology == Ka wai kini literally translates to \"the multitudinous water\" in the Hawaiian language, referring to the island's high rainfall. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of the United States **List of volcanoes of the United States ***List of mountain peaks of Hawaii *List of Ultras of Oceania *List of Ultras of the United States *Hawaii hotspot *Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes *Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain ==References== ==External links== * \"Kawaikini, Hawaii\" on Peakbagger Category:Mountains of Hawaii Category:Landforms of Kauai ",
