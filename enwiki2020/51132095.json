    "text": "Peter Genyn (born 24 December 1976) is a Paralympian sportsman from Belgium. Initially Genyn competed as a wheelchair rugby player before switching to track and field athletics in 2014 where he competes in category T51 sprint events. In 2016 he became the world record holder in the T51 men's 400 metres sprint. ==Personal history== Genyn was born in Brasschaat, Belgium in 1976. In 1990 he jumped into a shallow pond, breaking his neck which resulted in tetraplegia. He has a degree in computer science. ==Rugby== Genyn took up wheelchair rugby shortly after his accident in 1993, and was classified as a 1.5 player. He represented Belgium at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens where the team ended sixth overall. As well as his Paralympic appearance Genyn was also part of the Belgium team at two IWRF World Championships, at Christchurch in 2006 (finishing 8th) and Vancouver in 2010 (7th). His highlight as a Wheelchair rugby player came in 2009 when he was part of the Belgium team that beat Sweden in the final of the 2009 IWRF European Championship. Genyn followed this with a second Paralympic appearance when Belgium qualified for London 2012 after finishing third in the 2011 European Championship. Genyn's wheelchair rugby career came to an end in November 2013 after he broke his leg. ==Athletics== After the end of his wheelchair rugby career Genyn switched to track and field athletics. Genyn switched to sprinting as he always saw himself as the fastest member of the Belgian rugby team. After being classified as a T51 athlete, Genyn appeared at his first major international competition when he represented Belgium at the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships in Swansea. He took part in two events, the 100 and 400 metres sprints. Genyn won two silver medals, beaten in both by Finland's Toni Piispanen, another ex-wheelchair rugby player. The following year Genyn met Piispanen again at the 2015 World Championships in Doha. This time the tables were reversed with Genyn pushing Pispanen into the lower medal places as he took gold in both the 100 metre and 400 metre races, setting championship records in both. In the build up to the Rio Paralympics, Genyn entered the 2016 European Championships in Grosseto. He won gold in both the 100 and 400 metres sprints setting a new world record time of 1:18.09 in the 400m event. During the 2016 Summer Paralympics, Genyn managed to win the gold medal both in the 100m as well as in the 400m T51 event. One year later he successfully defended his titles at the 100 and 400 metres events at the 2017 World Championships in London. ==Awards== Belgian Paralympic Athlete of the Year (2017 & 2018)https://nl.metrotime.be/2017/12/16/news/sportgala-2017-peter-genyn-is-de- paralympisch-atleet-van-het-jaar/https://www.paralympic.be/nl/nieuws/peter- genyn-paralympi%C3%ABr-van-2018 == References == ==External links== * * Video of Genyn winning gold at the Men's 400m T51 final - 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships Doha * Peter Genyn - C\u0153ur Handisport Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:People from Brasschaat Category:Belgian male sprinters Category:Disabled track and field athletes Category:Paralympic athletes of Belgium Category:Wheelchair rugby players at the 2004 Summer Paralympics Category:Wheelchair rugby players at the 2012 Summer Paralympics Category:World record holders in Paralympic athletics Category:Medalists at the 2016 Summer Paralympics Category:World Para Athletics Championships winners Category:Paralympic medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Paralympic gold medalists for Belgium ",
