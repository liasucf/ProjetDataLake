The competition of submitted works was won by Nachum Gutman. His project contained characteristic motifs of the city and emphasized the connection with Theodor Herzel. ==Description== Seven stars refer to Herzel's plan to establish a 7-hour working day. The lighthouse in the center of the logo refers to the old port of Tel Aviv, which for many years served as a gateway to the country for thousands of immigrants. Flag of Tel Aviv The inscription in the coat of arms comes from the Book of Jeremiah 31:4. In 1959, on the occasion of Tel Aviv's 50th anniversary, the appearance of the coat of arms was revised. A canopy in the shape of residential buildings was added, which suggests a huge expansion of the city. ==Flag== The municipal flag of Tel Aviv-Yafo is based on the flag of Israel. It features two horizontal blue stripes reminiscent of the tallit (the Jewish prayer shawl). In the center is Tel Aviv-Yafo's municipal emblem. A vertical variant is sometimes used during ceremonial functions. ==References== ==External links== * The official Tel Aviv municipality website Category:1950 establishments in Israel Tel Aviv Tel Aviv Tel Aviv Tel Aviv Tel Aviv Category:Tel Aviv ",
