    "text": "Intern is a 2000 comedy satire film directed by Michael Lange about the shallow world of fashion magazines. It stars Dominique Swain, Joan Rivers, Peggy Lipton, Paulina Porizkova and Kathy Griffin. The film features multiple cameo appearances including Tommy Hilfiger, Kenneth Cole, Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg, Kevyn Aucoin, Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, Samia Shoaib, and Gwyneth Paltrow. ==Plot== Jocelyn Bennett (Swain), is an intern at the fictional New York City magazine, Skirt. Horribly mistreated, overworked, and underpaid, Jocelyn lives for Skirt, especially the photo spreads. A spy begins to hand over Skirts spreads and story ideas to its rival glossy, Vogue. Skirt magazine finds itself in a bind and some people begin speculating who the infiltrator (everyone refers to the spy as a yuri) might be. After some fingers begin to point at Jocelyn, she seeks to apprehend the spy and clear her name. Along the way, she meets Paul Rochester (Ben Pullen), the British deputy art director at Skirt, with whom she has much in common. When she finds herself falling in love, one thing stands in her way: Paul's supermodel girlfriend, Resin (Leilani Bishop). Jocelyn continues to search for the spy but several obstacles stand in her way including Art Director Sebastian Niedarfarb (Billy Porter) who believes she is the spy and consistently puts Jocelyn down. However, as she begins to climb the ranks, she begins to stand out to the editors who realize her potential, though they quickly forget it. To make Paul jealous, she starts dating a photo shoot tech named Alex, though the relationship doesn't last. Jocelyn later learns that Resin is only dating Paul because he is related to Prince Charles. Soon after, the spy is apprehended. For her work, Jocelyn is made an assistant, on staff, and finally gets better treatment from her colleagues. During a party thrown by Skirt, Resin dumps Paul for another model, and Paul and Jocelyn get engaged. Two years later, the happy couple are shown on a PBS tour done by the newest intern at Skirt. Jocelyn has been made the senior photo editor at the magazine and Paul accomplished his dream of becoming a famous artist. They are set to be married in a few months. ==Cast== * Dominique Swain as Jocelyn Bennett * Ben Pullen as Paul Rochester * Leilani Bishop as Resin * Peggy Lipton as Roxanne Rochet * Paulina Porizkova as Chi Chi Chemise * Billy Porter as Sebastian Niederfarb * Kathy Griffin as Cornelia Crisp * Anna Levine as Antoinette De la Paix * Joan Rivers as Dolly Bellows ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 38% based on reviews from 8 critics. While some have praised the dialogue and writing of the film, other's have criticized the film's execution. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said, \"The biggest mystery about Intern is how a film about people who are obsessed with appearances could wind up looking so hopelessly drab and tacky.\" Others have found the film lacking in some aspects but had redeeming qualities. Stephen MacMillan Moser of the Austin Chronicle said, \"Intern isn't a particularly deep movie, but, to paraphrase Karl Lagerfeld, fashion is not the same thing as feeding the hungry and curing the ill.\" Emanuel Levy of Variety said, \"The fashion world is ripe with possibilities for a biting satire, but Lange's Sundance Festival entry is pedestrian, offering a disappointingly flat look at the glamour industry.\" == See also == * The Devil Wears Prada (2006) ==References== ==External links== * * Intern DVD on Amazon.com Category:2000 films Category:Films about fashion Category:American satirical films Category:American films Category:2000 in fashion Category:2000 comedy films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Works about fashion magazine publishing ",
