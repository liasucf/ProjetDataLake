    "text": "K-convex functions, first introduced by Scarf, are a special weakening of the concept of convex function which is crucial in the proof of the optimality of the (s,S) policy in inventory control theory. The policy is characterized by two numbers and , S \\geq s, such that when the inventory level falls below level , an order is issued for a quantity that brings the inventory up to level , and nothing is ordered otherwise. Gallego and Sethi Gallego, G. and Sethi, S. P. (2005). K-convexity in \u211cn. _Journal of Optimization Theory & Applications,_ 127(1):71-88. have generalized the concept of K-convexity to higher dimensional Euclidean spaces. == Definition == Two equivalent definitions are as follows: === Definition 1 (The original definition) === A function g: \\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is K-convex if :g(u)+z\\left[\\frac{g(u)-g(u-b)}{b}\\right] \\leq g(u+z) + K for any u, z\\geq 0, and b>0. === Definition 2 (Definition with geometric interpretation) === A function g: \\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is K-convex if :g(\\lambda x+\\bar{\\lambda} y) \\leq \\lambda g(x) + \\bar{\\lambda} [g(y)+K] for all x\\leq y, \\lambda \\in [0,1], where \\bar{\\lambda}=1-\\lambda. This definition admits a simple geometric interpretation related to the concept of visibility. Let a \\geq 0. A point (x,f(x)) is said to be visible from (y,f(y)+a) if all intermediate points (\\lambda x+\\bar{\\lambda} y, f(\\lambda x+\\bar{\\lambda} y)), 0\\leq \\lambda \\leq 1 lie below the line segment joining these two points. Then the geometric characterization of K-convexity can be obtain as: :A function g is K-convex if and only if (x,g(x)) is visible from (y,g(y)+K) for all y\\geq x. === Proof of Equivalence === It is sufficient to prove that the above definitions can be transformed to each other. This can be seen by using the transformation : \\lambda = z/(b+z),\\quad x=u-b,\\quad y=u+z. == Properties == Sethi S P, Cheng F. Optimality of (s, S) Policies in Inventory Models with Markovian Demand. INFORMS, 1997. === Property 1 === If g: \\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is K-convex, then it is L-convex for any L\\geq K. In particular, if g is convex, then it is also K-convex for any K\\geq 0. === Property 2 === If g_1 is K-convex and g_2 is L-convex, then for \\alpha \\geq 0, \\beta \\geq 0,\\; g=\\alpha g_1 +\\beta g_2 is (\\alpha K+\\beta L)-convex. === Property 3 === If g is K-convex and \\xi is a random variable such that E|g(x-\\xi)|<\\infty for all x, then Eg(x-\\xi) is also K-convex. === Property 4 === If g: \\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is K-convex, restriction of g on any convex set \\mathbb{D}\\subset\\mathbb{R} is K-convex. === Property 5 === If g: \\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is a continuous K-convex function and g(y)\\rightarrow \\infty as |y|\\rightarrow \\infty, then there exit scalars s and S with s\\leq S such that * g(S)\\leq g(y), for all y\\in \\mathbb{R}; * g(S)+K=g(s), for all y; * g(y) is a decreasing function on (-\\infty, s); * g(y)\\leq g(z)+K for all y, z with s\\leq y\\leq z. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Types of functions Category:Convex analysis ",
