    "text": "The Latin Bishop of Gibraltar is the ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gibraltar, covering the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, which is exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province, nor is it part of any (Spanish or British) episcopal conference. The Diocese's episcopal seat (cathedra) is located in the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned. The diocese also has a National Shrine of Our Lady of Europe. The incumbent, the Right Reverend Carmelo Zammit, who was appointed Bishop of Gibraltar on 24 June 2016 and received episcopal ordination on 8 September 2016, was installed there on 24 September 2016. Lacking independence, the tiny territory (governed as British overseas territory, but claimed by Spain) had no diplomatic relations, so no papal diplomatic representation. == History == * Established on 25 January 1816 as Apostolic Vicariate of Gibraltar (Gibilterra in Curiate Italian, Latin adjective Gibraltarien(sis)), on territory split off from the Spanish Diocese of C\u00e1diz * Promoted to the Diocese of Gibraltar on 19 November 1910. == Statistics == As per 2014 it pastorally served 23,495 Catholics (79.8% of 29,431 total) on 6 km\u00b2 in 5 parishes with 8 priests (7 diocesan, 1 religious) and 2 lay religious (1 brother, 1 sister). == Episcopal Catholic Ordinaries == === Apostolic Vicars of Gibraltar === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"; border=\"1\" ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\"|Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicars of Gibraltar |- valign=center ! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"9%\"|From ! style=\"background- color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"9%\"|Until ! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"30%\"|Incumbent ! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"47%\"|Notes |- valign=top bgcolor=\"white\" | align=\"center\" | 1816 | align=\"center\" | 1839 | John Baptist Nosardy Zino | Appointed vicar apostolic on 25 January 1816.
