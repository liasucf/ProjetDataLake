    "text": "Cleistanthus collinus is a plant species first described by Roxburgh, with its current name after Bentham and Hooker; it is included in the family Phyllanthaceae. The IUCN categorizes this species as vulnerable. No subspecies are listed in the Catalogue of Life. ==Properties== Cleistanthus collinus (Karra) contains a plant poison also called oduvan (Tamil), kadise (Kannada), Vadisaku (Telugu), Oduku (Malayalam) and Gaja Madara (Sinhala) . Ingestion of its leaves or a decoction of its leaves causes hypokalemia (kaliuresis and cardiac arrhythmias), metabolic acidosis, hypotension and hypoxia probably due to distal renal tubular acidosis, ARDS and toxin induced vasodilatation respectively.Benjamin SPE, M Edwin Fernando, JJ Jayanth, Preetha B; Cleistanthus collinus poisoning. J Assoc Physicians India 2006 Sep; 54:742-44 Hypokalemia and acidosis probably also induces rhabdomyolysis resulting in myoglobinuric kidney failure and neuromuscular weakness. Its effects are probably mediated by injury to the distal renal tubules, pulmonary epithelium and peripheral blood vessels due to glutathione depletion (animal studies have shown benefit with N-acetylcysteine). Cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B are phytoconstituents of C. collinus. Cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B are arylnaphthalide lignans. They have been reported to be toxic substances responsible for poisoning. Cleistanthin A is also present in Phyllanthus taxodiifolius. ==Gallery== Medicinal Plant Cleistanthus collinus.jpg|Karra at fruiting Cleistanthus collinus (Garari) in Narsapur forest, AP W IMG 0166.jpg Cleistanthus collinus (Garari) in Narsapur forest, AP W IMG 0168.jpg Cleistanthus collinus (Garari) in Narsapur forest, AP W IMG 0169.jpg ==References== Benth. ex Hook.f., 1887 In: Fl.
