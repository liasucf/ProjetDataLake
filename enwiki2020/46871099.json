    "text": "Cortinarius pseudocupreorufus is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium). It was originally described as new to science in 1944 by American mycologist Alexander H. Smith as a variety of Cortinarius orichalceus. Molecular and morphological data suggests that it is sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a distinct species, and it was renamed in 2014. The specific epithet pseudocupreorufus refers to its resemblance to Cortinarius cupreorufus. ==See also== *List of Cortinarius species ==References== ==External links== * pseudocupreorufus Category:Fungi described in 1944 Category:Fungi of the United States ",
