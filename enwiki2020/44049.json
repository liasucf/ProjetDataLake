    "text": "Chiricahua ( ) is one of the socio-culturally related Native American tribes in the Southwestern United States, which include the Tsokanende (Chiricahua), Ndendahe (Mogollon, Carrizale\u00f1o), Tchihende (Mimbre\u00f1o), Sehende (Mescalero), Lipan, Salinero, Plains and Western Apache. Native Americans, based in the Southern Plains and Southwest United States. Culturally related to other Apache peoples, Chiricahua historically shared a common area, language, customs, and intertwined family relations. At the time of European contact, they had a territory of 15 million acres (61,000 km2) in Southwestern New Mexico and Southeastern Arizona in the United States and in Northern Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico. Today Chiricahua are enrolled in two federally recognized tribes in the United States: the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, located near Apache, Oklahoma with a small reservation outside Deming, New Mexico, and the Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation near Ruidoso, New Mexico. The San Carlos Apache Tribe, Arizona does have Chiricahua Apache people there also. ==Name== The Chiricahua Apache, also written as Chiricagui, Apaches de Chiricahui, Chiricahues, Chilicague, Chilecagez, and Chiricagua, were given that name by the Spanish. The White Mountain Coyotero Apache, including the Cibecue and Bylas groups of the Western Apache, referred to the Chiricahua by the name Ha'i\u2019\u0105\u0301h\u00e1, while the San Carlos Apache called them H\u00e1k'\u0105\u0301y\u00e9 which means \u2033Eastern Sunrise\u2033, or \u2033People in the East\u2033. Sometimes they adapted this appelation and referred to themselves also as Ha\u2019ishu Na gukande ('Sunrise People'). The Mescalero Apache called the Western Apache and Chiricahua bands to their west Sh\u00e1'i'\u00e1\u00f5de (\"Western Apache People\", \"The People of the Sunset\", \"The People of the West\"), when referring only to Chiricahuas they used Ch'\u00fak'\u00e2n\u00e9\u00f5de (\"People of a ridge or mountainside [made of loose rocks]\") or sometimes T\u00e3'aa'ji k'ee'd\u00e9\u00f5kaa'\u00f5de (\"The Ones who are Covered [with breech cloths]\"). Navajo refer to the Chiricahua as Ch\u00edsh\u00ed (\"Southern People\"). The Chiricahua autonym, or name by which they refer to themselves, is simply (depending on dialect) Nde, Ne, N\u00e9nd\u00e9, H\u00e9nd\u00e9, Hen-de or \u00f5ne (\"The People, Men\", \"the People of\"); they never called themselves \u2033Apaches\". The Chiricahua referred to outsiders, such as Americans, Mexicans or other Indians, as Enee, \u207fd\u00e1a or Indah / N'daa. This word has two possible meanings, the first being \"strange people, non-Apache people\" or \"enemy\", but another being \"eye\". Sometimes it is said that all Apaches referred to the Americans and European settlers (with exception of the Mexicans) as Bi'ndah- Li'ghi' / Bi'nda-li'ghi'o'yi (\"White Eyes\"), but this seems a name from Mescalero and Lipan Apache bands, as the Chiricahua bands called them Daadatlijende, meaning \"Blue/green eye people\" or Indaa\u026big\u00e1\u00ed / Indaa\u026big\u00e1nde meaning \"White skinned or pale colored people\" or literally \"Strange, non- Apache people, which are white-skinned\"). \u0141ig\u00e1\u00ed means \"it is white\" or it can be translate as \"it is pale colored\". The \u00ed on the end usually translates as \"the one that is\", but in the context of human beings, can mean \"the group who are\". ==Culture and organization== Several loosely affiliated bands of Apache came improperly to be usually known as the Chiricahuas. These included the Chokonen (recte: Tsokanende), the Chihenne (recte: Tchihende), the Nednai (Nednhi) and Bedonkohe (recte, both of them together: Ndendahe). Today, all are commonly referred to as Chiricahua, but they were not historically a single band nor the same Apache division, being more correctly identified, all together, as \"Central Apaches\". Many other bands and groups of Apachean language-speakers ranged over eastern Arizona and the American Southwest. The bands that are grouped under the Chiricahua term today had much history together: they intermarried and lived alongside each other, and they also occasionally fought with each other. They formed short-term as well as longer alliances that have caused scholars to classify them as one people.Debo, pp. 9\u201313. The Apachean groups and the Navajo peoples were part of the Athabaskan migration into the North American continent from Asia, across the Bering Strait from Siberia. As the people moved south and east into North America, groups splintered off and became differentiated by language and culture over time. Some anthropologists believe that the Lipan Apache and the Navajo were pushed south and west into what is now New Mexico and Arizona by pressure from other Great Plains Indians, such as the Comanche and Kiowa. Among the last of such splits were those that resulted in the formation of the different Apachean bands whom the later Europeans encountered: the southwestern Apache groups and the Navajo. Although both speaking forms of Southern Athabaskan, the Navajo and Apache have become culturally distinct. The \"Chihenne (Tchihende)\", \"Nednai/Nednhi (Ndendahe)\" and \"Bedonkohe\" intermarried sometimes with Mescalero Bands of New Mexico and Chihuahua and formed alliances with them; therefore their Mescalero kin did know the names of Chiricahua bands and local groups: Ch\u00edh\u00e9\u00f5de (\"The People of Red Ceremonial Paint\", \"The Red Ceremonial Paint People\"), Nd\u00e9'ndaa'\u00f5de / Nd\u00e9'ndaa\u00f5de (\"The Apache People (who live among) Enemies\") and Bid\u00e1\u00f5'ka\u00f5de / Bid\u00e1\u00f5'kah\u00e9\u00f5de (\"The People whom We Met\", \"The People whom We Came Upon\"), The Mescalero use the term -\u00f5de, -\u00e9\u00f5de, -n\u00e9\u00f5de, or -h\u00e9\u00f5de (\"the people of\") instead of the Chiricahua Nde, Ne, N\u00e9nd\u00e9, H\u00e9nd\u00e9, Hen-de or \u00f5ne (\"the people of\"). ==History== Ba-keitz-ogie (Yellow Coyote), U.S. Army Scout The Tsokanende (Chiricahua) Apache division was once led, from the beginning of the 18th century, by chiefs such as Pisago Cabez\u00f3n, Relles, Posito Moraga, Yrigollen, Tapil\u00e1, Teboca, V\u00edvora, Miguel Narbona, Esquinaline, and finally Cochise (whose name was derived from the Apache word Cheis, meaning \"having the quality of oak\") and, after his death, his sons Tahzay and, later, Naiche, under the guardianship of Cochise's war chief and brother-in-law Nahilzay, and the independent chiefs Chihuahua, Ulzana, Skinya and Pionsenay; Tchihende (Mimbre\u00f1o) people was led, during the same period, by chiefs as Juan Jos\u00e9 Compa, Fuerte also known as Soldado Fiero, Mangas Coloradas, Cuchillo Negro, Delgadito, Ponce, Nana, Victorio, Loco, Mangus; Ndendahe (Mogoll\u00f3n and Carrizale\u00f1o / Janero) Apache people, in the meanwhile, was led by Mahko and, after him, Mano Mocha, Coleto Amarillo, Luis, Laceres, Felipe, Natiza, and finally Juh and Goyaa\u0142\u00e9 (known to the Americans as Geronimo). After Victorio's death, Nana, Ger\u00f3nimo, Mangus (youngest Mangas Coloradas' son) and youngest Cochise's son Naiche were the last leaders of the Central Apaches, and their mixed Apache group was the last to continue to resist U.S. government control of the American Southwest.Thrapp, p.366. ===European-Apache relations=== From the beginning of EuropeanAmerican/Apache relations, there was conflict between them, as they competed for land and other resources, and had very different cultures. Their encounters were preceded by more than 100 years of Spanish colonial and Mexican incursions and settlement on the Apache lands.Thrapp p.6-8 The United States settlers were newcomers to the competition for land and resources in the Southwest, but they inherited its complex history, and brought their own attitudes with them about American Indians and how to use the land. By the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, the US took on the responsibility to prevent and punish cross-border incursions by Apache who were raiding in Mexico.Thrapp p. 7 The Apache viewed the United States colonists with ambivalence, and in some cases enlisted them as allies in the early years against the Mexicans. In 1852, the US and some of the Chiricahua signed a treaty, but it had little lasting effect.Thrapp p.19 During the 1850s, American miners and settlers began moving into Chiricahua territory, beginning encroachment that had been renewed in the migration to the Southwest of the previous two decades. This forced the Apachean people to change their lives as nomads, free on the land. The US Army defeated them and forced them into the confinement of reservation life, on lands ill-suited for subsistence farming, which the US proffered as the model of civilization. Today, the Chiricahua are preserving their culture as much as possible, while forging new relationships with the peoples around them. The Chiricahua are a living and vibrant culture, a part of the greater American whole and yet distinct based on their history and culture. ===Hostilities=== Although they had lived peaceably with most Americans in the New Mexico Territory up to about 1860,Debo p.42. the Chiricahua became increasingly hostile to American encroachment in the Southwest after a number of provocations had occurred between them. In 1835, Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps which further inflamed the situation. In 1837 Warm Springs Mimbre\u00f1os' head chief and famed raider, Soldado Fiero also known as Fuerte was killed by Mexican soldiers of the garrison at Janos (only two days' travel from Santa Rita del Cobre), and his son Cuchillo Negro succeeded him as head chief and went to war against Chihuahua for revenge. In the same 1837, the American John (also known as James) Johnson invited the Coppermine Mimbre\u00f1os in the Pinos Altos area to trade with his party (near the mines at Santa Rita del Cobre, New Mexico and, when they gathered around a blanket on which pinole (a ground corn flour) had been placed for them, Johnson and his men opened fire on the Chihenne with rifles and a concealed cannon loaded with scrap iron, glass, and a length of chain. They killed about 20 Apache, including the chief Juan Jos\u00e9 Comp\u00e1.Roberts: p.36. Mangas Coloradas is said to have witnessed this attack, which inflamed his and other Apache warriors' desires for vengeance for many years; he led the survivors to safety and subsequently, together with Cuchillo Negro, took Mimbre\u00f1o revenge. The historian Rex W. Strickland argued that the Apache had come to the meeting with their own intentions of attacking Johnson's party, but were taken by surprise.Strickland, Rex W. (Autumn 1976) \"The Birth and Death of a Legend: The Johnson Massacre of 1837\"], Arizona and the West, Vol. 18, No. 3. p.257-86. In 1839 scalp-hunter James Kirker was employed by Robert McKnight to re-open the road to Santa Rita del Cobre. After the conclusion of the US/Mexican War (1848) and the Gadsden Purchase (1853), Americans began to enter the territory in greater numbers. This increased the opportunities for incidents and misunderstandings. Anyway, the Apaches, including Mangas Coloradas and Cuchillo Negro, were not at first hostile to the Americans, considering them enemies of their own Mexican enemies. Cuchillo Negro, with Ponce, Delgadito, Victorio and other Mimbre\u00f1o chiefs, signed a treaty at Fort Webster in April 1853, but, during the spring of 1857 the U.S. Army set out on a campaign, led by Col. Benjamin L.E. deBonneville, Col. Dixon S. Miles (3\u00b0 Cavalry from Fort Thorn) and Col. William W. Loring (commanding a Mounted Rifles Regiment from Albuquerque), against Mogollon and Coyotero Apaches: Loring's Pueblo Indian scouts found out and attacked an Apache rancheria in the Canyon de Los Muertos Carneros (May 25, 1857), where Cuchillo Negro and some Mimbre\u00f1o Apache were resting after a raid against the Navahos. Some Apaches, including Cuchillo Negro himself, were killed. In December 1860, after several bad incidents provoked by the miners led by James H. Tevis in the Pinos Altos area, Mangas Coloradas went to Pinos Altos, New Mexico to try to convince the miners to move away from the area he loved and to go to the Sierra Madre and seek gold there, but they tied him to a tree and whipped him badly.Roberts p.37 His Mimbre\u00f1o and Ndendahe followers and related Chiricahua bands were incensed by the treatment of their respected chief. Mangas had been just as great a chief in his prime (during the 1830s and 1840s), along with Cuchillo Negro, as Cochise was then becoming.Roberts p. 35 In 1861, the US Army seized and killed some of Cochise's relatives near Apache Pass, in what became known as the Bascom Affair. Remembering how Cochise had escaped, the Chiricahua called the incident \"cut the tent.\"Roberts p.21-29 In 1863, Gen. James H. Carleton set out leading a new campaign against the Mescalero Apache, and Capt. Edmund Shirland (10\u00b0 California Cavalry) invited Mangas Coloradas for a \"parley\" but, after he entered the U.S. camp to negotiate a peace, the great Mimbre\u00f1o chief was arrested and convicted in Fort McLane, where, probably on Gen. Joseph R. West's orders, Mangas Coloradas was killed by American soldiers (Jan. 18, 1863). His body was mutilated by the soldiers, and his people were enraged by his murder. The Chiricahuas began to consider the Americans as \"enemies we go against them.\" From that time, they waged almost constant war against US settlers and the Army for the next 23 years. Cochise, his brother-in-law Nahilzay (war chief of Cochise's people), Chihuahua, Skinya, Pionsenay, Ulzana and other warring chiefs became a nightmare to settlers and military garrisons and patrols. In the meantime, the great Victorio, Delgadito (soon killed in 1864), Nana, Loco, young Mangus (last son of Mangas Coloradas) and other minor chiefs led on the warpath the Mimbre\u00f1os, Chiricahuas' cousins and allies, and Juh led the Ndendahe (Nednhi and Bedonkohe together). In 1872, General Oliver O. Howard, with the help of Thomas Jeffords, succeeded in negotiating a peace with Cochise. The US established a Chiricahua Apache Reservation with Jeffords as US Agent, near Fort Bowie, Arizona Territory. It remained open for about 4 years, during which the chief Cochise died (from natural causes).Thrapp p.168 In 1876, about two years after Cochise's death, the US moved the Chiricahua and some other Apache bands to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, still in Arizona. This was in response to public outcry after the killings of Orizoba Spence and Nicholas Rogers at Sulpher Springs. The mountain people hated the desert environment of San Carlos, and some frequently began to leave the reservation and sometimes raided neighboring settlers. They surrendered to General Nelson Miles in 1886. The best-known warrior leader of the \"renegades\", although he was not considered a 'chief', was the forceful and influential Geronimo. He and Naiche (the son of Cochise and hereditary leader after Tahzay's death) together led many of the resisters during those last few years of freedom. Chiricahua National Monument entrance roadway They made a stronghold in the Chiricahua Mountains, part of which is now inside Chiricahua National Monument, and across the intervening Willcox Playa to the northeast, in the Dragoon Mountains (all in southeastern Arizona). In late frontier times, the Chiricahua ranged from San Carlos and the White Mountains of Arizona, to the adjacent mountains of southwestern New Mexico around what is now Silver City, and down into the mountain sanctuaries of the Sierra Madre (of northern Mexico). There they often joined with their Nednai Apache kin. General George Crook, then General Miles' troops, aided by Apache scouts from other groups, pursued the exiles until they gave up. Mexico and the United States had negotiated an agreement allowing their troops in pursuit of the Apache to continue into each other's territories.Roberts p.223-4. This prevented the Chiricahua groups from using the border as an escape route, and as they could gain little time to rest and consider their next move, the fatigue, attrition and demoralization of the constant hunt led to their surrender. The final 34 hold-outs, including Geronimo and Naiche, surrendered to units of General Miles' forces in September 1886. From Bowie Station, Arizona, they were entrained, along with most of the other remaining Chiricahua (as well as the Army's Apache scouts), and exiled to Fort Marion, Florida. At least two Apache warriors, Massai and Gray Lizard, escaped from their prison car and made their way back to San Carlos Arizona in a journey to their ancestral lands. After a number of Chiricahua deaths at the Fort Marion prison near St. Augustine, Florida, the survivors were moved, first to Alabama, and later to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Geronimo's surrender ended the Indian Wars in the United States.Thrapp p.366-7. However, another group of Chiricahua (also known as the Nameless Ones or Bronco Apache) were not captured by U.S. forces and refused to surrender. They escaped over the border to Mexico, and settled in the remote Sierra Madre mountains. There they built hidden camps, raided homes for cattle and other food supplies, and engaged in periodic firefights with units of the Mexican Army and police. Most were eventually captured or killed by soldiers or by private ranchers armed and deputized by the Mexican government.Salopek, Paul, Mexicans Recall Last Apaches Living in Sierra Madre, Chicago Tribune, 7 September 1997 Eventually, the surviving Chiricahua prisoners were moved to the Fort Sill military reservation in Oklahoma. In August 1912, by an act of the U.S. Congress, they were released from their prisoner of war status as they were thought to be no further threat. Although promised land at Fort Sill, they met resistance from local non-Apache. They were given the choice to remain at Fort Sill or to relocate to the Mescalero reservation near Ruidoso, New Mexico. Two-thirds of the group, 183 people, elected to go to New Mexico, while 78 remained in Oklahoma.Debo p.447-8 Their descendants still reside in these places. At the time, they were not permitted to return to Arizona because of hostility from the long wars. in 1912 many different Apache bands returned to San Carlos Apache lands after their release from Fort Sill Apache Reservation. ==Bands== Chiricahua Apaches as they arrived at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania Goyaa\u0142\u00e9 (Geronimo), in native garb , Head Chief, Warm Springs Apaches Loco, Warm Springs Apache chief Bonito, Chiricahua chief Viola and Agnes Chihuahua, Chiricahuas, photographed at the Mescalero Apache Reservation in 1916. Hattie Tom, Chiricahua Apache, photographed by Frank Rinehart In the Chiricahua culture, the \"band\" as a unit was much more important than the American or European concept of \"tribe\". The Chiricahua had no name for themselves (autonym) as a people. The name Chiricahua is most likely the Spanish rendering of the Opata word Chihuicahui or Chiguicagui ('mountain of the wild turkey') for the Chiricahua Mountains, later corrupted into Chiricahui/Chiricahua. The Chiricahua tribal territory encompassed today's SE Arizona, SW New Mexico, NE Sonora and NW Chihuahua. The Chiricahua range extended to the east as far as the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and to the west as far as the San Pedro River Valley in Arizona, north of Magdalena just below present day Hwy I-40 corridor in New Mexico and with the town Ciudad Madera (276 km northwest of the state capital, Chihuahua, and 536 km southwest of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (formerly known as Paso del Norte) on the Mexico\u2013United States border), as their southernmost range. According to Morris E. Opler (1941), the Chiricahuas consisted of three bands: * Ch\u00edh\u00e9ne or Ch\u00ed\u00edh\u00e9nee\u2019 'Red Paint People' (also known as Eastern Chiricahua, Warm Springs Apache, Gile\u00f1os, Ojo Caliente Apache, Coppermine Apache, Copper Mine, Mimbre\u00f1os, Mimbres, Mogollones, Tcihende), * Ch'\u00fak'\u00e1n\u00e9\u0144 or Ch'uuk'an\u00e9n \u2018Ridge of the Mountainside People\u2019 (also known as Central Chiricahua, Ch'\u00f3k'\u00e1n\u00e9\u0144, Cochise Apache, Chiricahua proper, Chiricaguis, Tcokanene), or the Sunrise People; * Nd\u00e9'indaa\u00ed or N\u00e9dnaa'\u00ed 'Enemy People' or 'The Apache People (who live among) Enemies' known as the Southern Chiricahua, Pinery Apache, Bronco Apache, Ne'na'i), or \"those ahead at the end\". Schroeder (1947) lists five bands: * Mogollon * Copper Mine * Mimbres * Warm Spring * Chiricahua proper The Chiricahua-Warm Springs Fort Sill Apache tribe in Oklahoma say they have four bands in Fort Sill: (some of the Arizona Apaches did not return to San Carlos or Fort Apache, White Mountain Apache warrior Eyelash is buried in Fort Sill cememtry, Southern Tonto Apache Chief/Scout Hosay is buried in Fort Apache cememtery, Hosay has family in Fort Sill and San Carlos today) * Ch\u00edh\u00e9ne (recte Tchi-he-nde, more correctly known as the Warm Springs and Coppermine Mimbre\u00f1o bands, Chinde), * Chukunen (recte Tsoka-ne-nde, also known as the Chiricahua band, Chokonende), * Bid\u00e1nku (recte Bedonkohe Ndendahe, also known as Bidanku, Bronco), * Nd\u00e9ndai (recte Nednhi Ndendahe, also known as Nd\u00e9nai, Nednai). Today they use the word Chidik\u00e1\u00e1gu (derived from the Spanish word Chiricahua) to refer to the Chiricahua in general, and the word Ind\u00e9, to refer to the Apache in general. Other sources list these and additional bands (only the Chokonen and Chihuicahui local groups of the Chokonen band were considered by Chiricahua tribal members to be the real Chiricahua people): *Chokonen, Chukunende or Tsokanendethree variants of Chiricahua band names are listed: First: i.e. Chokonen is now the common / usual form, Second: Chukunende is used by Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, Third: Tsokanende is another transcription (also known as Ch\u2019\u00f3k\u2019\u00e1n\u00e9\u0144, Tsoka-ne-nde, Tcokanene, Chu- ku-nde, Chukunen, Ch\u2019\u00fak\u2019\u00e1n\u00e9\u0144, Ch\u2019uuk\u2019an\u00e9n, Chuukonende or Ch'\u00fak'\u00e2n\u00e9\u00f5ne \u2013 \u2018Ridge of the Mountainside People\u2019, proper or Central Chiricahua)Edwin R.

Griffen: Apaches at War and Peace: The Janos Presidio 1750\u20131858, University of Oklahoma Press 1998, ** Nednhi / Ndendahe Apache (they were subdivided in three local groups) ***Janeros local group (also known as real Nednhi, lived in NW Chihuahua and NE Sonora, south into the Sierra San Luis, Sierra del Tigre, Sierra de Carcay, Sierra de Boca Grande, west beyond the Aros River to Bavispe, east along the Janos River and Casas Grandes River toward the Lake Guzm\u00e1n in the northern part of the Guzm\u00e1n Basin, because they traded at the presidio of Janos they were called Janeros Apache, because they preferred living in the nearly inaccessible Sierra Madre Occidental, their autonym for themselves was Dzilthdaklizh\u00e9nde or Dzi\u0142 Dklishende \u2013 \u2032Blue Mountain People, i.e. People of the Sierra Madre\u2032, northern local group \u2013 headed by Juh) ***Tu-ntsa-nde local group (\u2032Big Water People, i.e. People along the Aros River\u2032, their stronghold called Guaynopa was in the bend of the Papigochic River (Aros River) east of the border of Sonora in the vicinity of a mountain, which called the Apache Dzil-da-na-tal \u2013 \u2032Mountain Holding Head Up And Peering Out\u2032, smallest local group) ***Haiahende local group (\u2032People of the Rising Sun, i.e. People of the East\u2032, lived in the Peloncillo Mountains, Animas Mountains and Florida Mountains in SE Arizona and in New Mexico Bootheel and south into the deserts and mountains of NE of Sonora and the Mexican Plateau in NW Chihuahua, eastern local group) *** Hakaye local group (were part of Sierra Madre Mountains of Sonora Mexico) **Carrizale\u00f1os local group (known by other Chiricahua as Gol-ga-he-ne \u2013 \u2032Open Place People\u2032 or Gul-ga-ki \u2013 \u2032Prairie Dog People\u2032, lived exclusively in Chihuahua, between the presidios of Janos in the west and Carrizal and Lake Santa Maria in the east, south toward Corralitos, Casas Grandes and Agua Nuevas north of Chihuahua, controlled the southern part of the Guzm\u00e1n Basin, and the mountains along the Casas Grandes, Santa Maria and Carmen River, likely called Tsebekin\u00e9nd\u00e9\u2014'Stone House People' or 'Rock House People', southeastern group) **Pinale\u00f1os / Pinery local group (lived south of Bavispe, between the Bavispe River and Aros River in NE Sonora and NW Chihuahua, controlled the Sierra Huachinera, Sierra de los Alisos and Sierra Nacori Chico, the mountains had a large stock of Apache Pine forest\u2014hence they were called Pinale\u00f1os / Pinery Apaches, southwestern local group). The Chokonen, Chihenne, Nednhi, and Bedonkohe had probably up to three other groups, named respectively after their leaders or homelands. By the end of the 19th century, surviving Apache no longer identified these groups. They may have been wiped out (like the Pinale\u00f1o-Nednhi) or had joined more powerful groups. For instance, the remnant of the Carrizale\u00f1o-Nedhni camped together with their northern kin, the Janero-Nednhi. The Carrizale\u0148o-Nednhi shared overlapping territory in the surroundings of Casas Grandes and Aguas Nuevas with the Tsebekin\u00e9nd\u00e9, a southern Mescalero band (which was often called Aguas Nuevas by the Spanish). The Spanish referred to the Apache band by the same name of Tsebekin\u00e9nd\u00e9. These two different Apache bands were often confused with each other. (Similar confusion arose over distinguishing the Janeros-Nednhi of the Chiricahua (Dzilthdaklizh\u00e9nd\u00e9) and the Dzithinahnd\u00e9 of the Mescalero. ==Notable Chiricahua Apache people== *Geronimo, (1829\u20131909), warrior, medicine man of the Bedonkohe Ndendahe band *Mildred Cleghorn, served as first tribal chairperson of the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, elected in 1976. *Chato, 1854 \u2013 13 August 1934) *Chihuahua (also known as Chewawa, by the Apache also known as Kla-esh or T\u0142\u00e1\u2019\u00ed\u2019ez, (ca. 1825\u20131901) *Cochise, chief of the Chihuicahui local group of the Tsokanende people *Cuchillo Negro, war chief of the southern Warm Springs local group of the Tchihende people *Dahteste (Tahdeste), was the sister of Ilth-goz-ay, the wife of Chihuahua, woman warrior and companion of the famous woman warrior Lozen *Delgadito, (ca. 1810\u20131864), principal chief of the Copper Mine local group of the Tchihende people *Gouyen, ca. 1857\u20131903), woman from the Warm Springs group of Tchihende people *Bob Haozous, sculptor *Juh, (ca. 1825\u20131883), medicine man and chief of the Janero local group of Nednhi band *Lozen, (\"Dextrous Horse Thief\", ca. 1840\u20131890), woman warrior and prophet of the Tchihende people *Mangas Coloradas, war chief of the Copper Mines local group of the Tchihende people and principal chief after Juan Jos\u00e9 Comp\u00e0's death *Massai, (in Apache: Mah\u2013sii, ca. 1847\u20131906/1911), warrior of the Mimbres Tchihende band *Naiche (ca. 1857\u20131919), second son of Cochise, was the final hereditary chief of the Chihuicahui local group of the Tsokanende people *Nana, ca. 1800/1810? \u2013 May 19, 1896), war chief of the Warm Springs Tchihende people *Robert Roche (activist) *Taza ca. 1843\u20131876, son of Cochise and his successor as chief of the Chihuicahui local group of Tsokanende people *Tso-ay (in Apache also known as: Panayotishn or Pe-nel-tishn, nicknamed \"Peaches\") Scout for General Crook *Ulzana (ca. 1821\u20131909), war chief Chihuahua of the Chokonen local group of Tsokanende people *Victorio, (Bidu-ya, Beduiat, \"he who checks his horse\", ca. 1825\u20131880), chief of the Warm Springs Tchihende (Mimbre\u00f1o) people === In popular culture === * The Missing (2003 film). Tommy Lee Jones and other cast members learned to speak Chiricahua for the film. A dialect of the Apache language, with only about 300 speakers worldwide. The movie was screened for Apaches living in the Mescalero reservation, who understood every word onscreen; it had a warm reception and inspired many students to take pride in learning their native language. == See also == * Mescalero-Chiricahua language * Southern Athabaskan languages ==References== ==Cited works== *Debo, Angie.
