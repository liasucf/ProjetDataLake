    "text": "Space Ghost (Thaddeus Bach) is a fictional character created by Hanna-Barbera Productions and designed by Alex Toth for CBS in the 1960s. In his original incarnation, he was a superhero who, with his teen sidekicks, Jan and Jace, and Blip the monkey, fought supervillains in outer space. In the 1990s, Space Ghost was brought back as a host for his own fictional late-night talk show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, on Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. In the 2000s, he was revamped as a serious superhero once again in a mini-series by DC Comics. ==Television series== ===Space Ghost and Dino Boy=== The original series debuted in September 1966. In the original series, Space Ghost was an intergalactic crime fighter from the Ghost Planet. He had the ability to be invisible (via his belt), fly, and shoot various rays from the powerbands on his wrists. Space Ghost would fight such recurring supervillains as Moltar, Zorak, Black Widow, Metallus, Brak and Creature King with the help of his sidekicks: Jan, Jayce, and their pet monkey, Blip. The original series shared time with an unrelated segment called Dino Boy in the Lost Valley. During its original run, there were a total of 42 Space Ghost episodes and 18 Dino Boy episodes. The series ended in 1968, but remained in syndication during the 1970s. Space Ghost was voiced by Gary Owens, who is best known for being the announcer for Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. ===Space Stars=== Twenty-two new Space Ghost segments appeared on Space Stars on NBC in 1981. The episodes introduced a new assortment of villains including an evil version of Space Ghost named Space Spectre who came from an alternate universe. As in the original series, Space Ghost often came to the aid of The Herculoids and vice versa. The Phantom Cruiser was given a more modern redesign as well. They also frequently crossed paths with the Teen Force and it appeared that Jan and Teen Force member Kid Comet were dating as well. Gary Owens reprised his role as Space Ghost, while Steve J. Spears played the role of Jace and Alexandra Stoddart played Jan. ===Space Ghost Coast to Coast=== The character Space Ghost hosted a talk show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, which began broadcasting in 1994 on Cartoon Network. The show spoofed late-night talk shows, with one- time villains Zorak and Moltar serving as Space Ghost's sidekicks (with occasional guest appearances from other Space Ghost villains, particularly Brak). In this version, Space Ghost is voiced by George Lowe, and his real name is Tad Ghostal. The show reused animation cels from the Hanna-Barbera archives. The show ran from 1994 to 1999, and returned with two new episodes in 2001, moving to the Adult Swim programming block later that year; the series ended its Adult Swim run in 2004. The characters of Jan, Jace, and Blip (Space Ghost's old sidekicks) appeared twice on the show. After approximately eight seasons, the show went into hiatus. New episodes of Space Ghost Coast to Coast appeared on the \"Animation\" channel of the GameTap service, beginning on May 30, 2006. On May 31, 2008, the show ended when the TV section of GameTap shut down. ===Cartoon Planet=== Following the popularity of Coast to Coast, the show provided a spin-off series, Cartoon Planet; the show ran from 1995 to 1998. Cartoon Planet was an hour-long cartoon block hosted by Space Ghost with his imprisoned sidekicks Zorak and Brak; the segments in-between the cartoons usually consisted of skits and original songs. Due to the popularity of the series' songs, two albums were released: Space Ghost's Surf & Turf and Space Ghost's Musical Bar-B-Que. Lowe provided the voice for Space Ghost on both records. The voice on these recordings is totally computer generated, using a custom software program that Lowe had written. ===Other appearances=== * Space Ghost also appeared in some of the Adult Swim projects: ** In the Robot Chicken episode \"Suck It,\" he was seen as a member of the Adult Swim Council alongside Peter Griffin from Family Guy and Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. ** In an episode of Perfect Hair Forever, he is attacked by a bear and is friends with a shark. ** Space Ghost appeared in four episodes of The Brak Show. ** Space Ghost and Zorak make cameos in Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters, where he is killed by a missile that Meatwad launches. ** In a scene of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode \"Multiple Meat\", when an older version of Frylock returns home, Space Ghost can be seen in a dumpster outside the Aqua Teens' home. * Space Ghost along with Birdman appeared in the background in multiple scenes of the Season 4 episode of The Powerpuff Girls titled \"Members Only\".
