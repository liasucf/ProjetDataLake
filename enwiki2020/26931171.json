    "text": "Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne (Godefroy Charles Henri; 26 January 1728, Paris - 3 December 1792) was a member of the House of La Tour d'Auvergne, the Sovereign Dukes of Bouillon. He was subsequently the penultimate Duke of Bouillon succeeding his father in 1771. ==Biography== The younger of two children, he was born to the Duke and Duchess of Bouillon in 1728. He had an older sister, Marie Louise (1725\u20131793) who later married the Prince of Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9. Styled the Prince of Turenne as the heir apparent to Bouillon, he married Princess Louise Henriette Gabrielle de Lorraine on 27 November 1743. She was a member of the house of Lorraine and a great grand daughter of Henri, Count of Harcourt. The couple had four children in all before Louise Henriette Gabrielle died in 1788; three children pre-deceased them. The widower Duke married again in 1789 to Marie Fran\u00e7oise Henriette de Banastre (1775\u20131816), a girl who was some forty-seven years younger than he. No children were produced from the marriage. He served with distinction in the Seven Years' War. In 1748 he was made a mar\u00e9chal de camp. He was elected to the Royal Academy of Sculpture and Painting in 1777. In just three months, he squandered almost a million livres on his mistress, an opera singer, thus bringing his family to the verge of ruin. He died at the Ch\u00e2teau de Navarre on the eve of Revolution and was succeeded by his eldest son Jacques, who was an invalid. Jacques was the last Duke of Bouillon, the title being abolished during the French Revolution. The Princes of Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9 today claim the Duchy of Bouillon as their own due to the marriage of Marie Louise (his only sibling) and Jules de Rohan, Prince of Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9. He has no known descendants. ==Gallery== File:Tombstone of Karolina Sobieska de Bouillon.JPG|Tombstone of his mother, Charlotte at the Saint Kazimierz Church in Warsaw Image:Louise de Lorraine, princesse de Turenne par Nattier.jpg|Louise de Lorraine, princesse de Turenne by Jean-Marc Nattier (1746) Versailles, Mus\u00e9e national du Ch\u00e2teau et des Trianons Image:Drouais, Fran\u00e7ois- Hubert - The Children of the Duc de Bouillon - 1756.jpg|The Children of the Duke of Bouillon dressed as MontagnardsJacques Leopold Charles Godefroy, prince de Bouillon, is shown playing a hurdy-gurdy, whilst his younger brother, Charles Louis Godefroy, prince d'Auvergne, is shown playing with a marmot on a ribbon. by Fran\u00e7ois-Hubert Drouais (1756) Private collection ==Titles and styles== *26 January 1728 - 24 October 1771: His Highness the Prince of Turenne *24 October 1771 - 3 December 1792: His Highness the Duke of Bouillon ==Issue== *Jacques Leopold Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne (15 January 1746 - 7 February 1802) married Hedwig of Hesse-Rotenburg, grand daughter of Ernest Leopold of Hesse-Rotenburg and Eleonore of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort; no issue; *Charles Louis Godefroi de La Tour d'Auvergne, Prince of Auvergne (22 September 1749 - 23 October 1767) never married; *Louis Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Albret (20 February 1753 - 7 March 1753) died in infancy; *X de La Tour d'Auvergne (3 April 1756) stillborn daughter. ==Ancestry== ==References and notes== Category:1728 births Category:1792 deaths Category:People from Paris Godefroy Category:French Roman Catholics Category:18th-century French people Category:Dukes of Bouillon Category:Grand Chamberlains of France Category:People of Byzantine descent Category:18th-century peers of France ",
