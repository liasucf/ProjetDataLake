    "text": "Danger & Eggs is an American animated series that premiered on Amazon Video on June 30, 2017. The show's last episode is a reference to families constructed by LGBTQ people in an effort to gain support that their legal or biological family can't provide. On July 27, 2020, Petosky described the show as about a \"gender-free female lesbian child and her giant large-gamete friend,\" referring to D.D. Danger and her friend, Phillip. Petosky also said that her favorite episodes were \"Trading Post\" and \"Broccoli\" and stated that she, and the show's cast wanted to be overt rather than having \"metaphors and hidden symbology.\" ==Plot== D. D. Danger, an imaginative thrill seeker, and her best friend, a lawful good, safety-first anthropomorphic egg named Phillip, experience a series of enjoyably chaotic adventures as \"they do stuff\".
