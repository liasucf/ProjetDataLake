While it is a live- action film, The Four Poster features animation by the studio United Productions of America (UPA). The animation was directed by John Hubley, and was his last project before leaving UPA and founding his independent studio Storyboard, Inc. In Yugoslavia, The Four Posters animation became one of the key influences on the foundation of the Zagreb School of Animated Films. Director Du\u0161an Vukoti\u0107 had come across an article about UPA's films in Graphis at an English bookstore in Zagreb. Around the same time, The Four Poster arrived in the country in \"a batch of American feature films sent for possible sale to Yugoslavia\", according to researcher Ronald Holloway. Vukoti\u0107 and others studied the film's animation, which also gave them a greater understanding of the still images in Graphis. As a result, the team began to explore design-focused limited animation at Zagreb Film. ==Cast== * Rex Harrison as John Edwards * Lilli Palmer as Abby Edwards ==References== Notes Bibliography * Bock, Hans-Michael & Bergfelder, Tim.
