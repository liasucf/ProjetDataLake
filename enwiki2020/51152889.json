The wheel had been planned for three years by the company Great City Attractions. They submitted a planning application which explained that it would increase tourism in Liverpool. A smaller observation wheel had been operational in the city, which was located at the Liverpool One leisure complex. This was dismantled because of the plans to open the Wheel of Liverpool. Construction was completed on 11 February 2010 at a cost of \u00a36 million. The wheel was closed for a short time following Great City Attractions going into administration. Freij Entertainment International purchased the attraction and it is currently operated by their subsidiary Wheels Entertainments Ltd.

While a temporary predecessor had already existed in Liverpool, located on the Liverpool One shopping centre complex. This was closed on 31 January 2010. That wheel had always been acknowledged as a temporary structure because of the city council's aspirations for the Wheel of Liverpool. The attraction had the backing of the Albert Dock Tenants\u2019 Business Association because of the overall waterfront visitor experience it would provide. The application was successful and granted permission to operate for an initial twelve months, later extended to two years.
