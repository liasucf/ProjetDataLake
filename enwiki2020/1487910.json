    "text": "In mathematics, the Schwarz\u2013Ahlfors\u2013Pick theorem is an extension of the Schwarz lemma for hyperbolic geometry, such as the Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model. The Schwarz\u2013Pick lemma states that every holomorphic function from the unit disk U to itself, or from the upper half-plane H to itself, will not increase the Poincar\u00e9 distance between points. The unit disk U with the Poincar\u00e9 metric has negative Gaussian curvature \u22121. In 1938, Lars Ahlfors generalised the lemma to maps from the unit disk to other negatively curved surfaces: Theorem (Schwarz\u2013Ahlfors\u2013Pick). Let U be the unit disk with Poincar\u00e9 metric \\rho; let S be a Riemann surface endowed with a Hermitian metric \\sigma whose Gaussian curvature is \u2264 \u22121; let f:U\\rightarrow S be a holomorphic function. Then :\\sigma(f(z_1),f(z_2)) \\leq \\rho(z_1,z_2) for all z_1,z_2 \\in U. A generalization of this theorem was proved by Shing-Tung Yau in 1973. ==References== Category:Hyperbolic geometry Category:Riemann surfaces Category:Theorems in complex analysis Category:Theorems in differential geometry ",
