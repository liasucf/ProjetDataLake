Meron is an Arab-Israeli. Meron said in 2012 that he was certain that Israeli Olympic representation, which has seen few Arabs, is determined only according to criteria: \"There\u2019s a minimum you have to meet, and if Arab athletes didn\u2019t meet the minimum, that means that they weren\u2019t good enough.\" ==Weightlifting career== Meron competed for Israel at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, in Weightlifting--Men's Bantamweight. He came in 18th, after lifting a total of 270 kg in his best lifts in military press, snatch, and clean & jerk.
