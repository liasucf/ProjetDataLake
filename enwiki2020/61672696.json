    "text": "Daniela Calvetti is an Italian-American applied mathematician whose work concerns scientific computing, and connects Bayesian statistics to numerical analysis. She is the James Wood Williamson Professor of Mathematics at Case Western Reserve University. ==Education and career== Calvetti earned a laurea in mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1980. She went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for graduate study in mathematics, earning a master's degree there in 1985 and completing her Ph.D. in 1989. Her dissertation, A Stochastic Round Off Error Analysis for the Fast Fourier Transform, was supervised by John Tolle. After taking faculty positions at North Carolina State University, Colorado State University\u2013Pueblo, and the Stevens Institute of Technology, she moved to Case Western Reserve University in 1997. She was given the James Wood Williamson Professorship in 2013. ==Books== With Erkki Somersalo, Calvetti is the co-author of two books, Introduction to Bayesian Scientific Computing: Ten Lectures on Subjective Computing (Springer, 2007) and Computational Mathematical Modeling: An Integrated Approach Across Scales (SIAM, 2013). ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:20th-century Italian mathematicians Category:Italian women mathematicians Category:University of Bologna alumni Category:University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alumni Category:North Carolina State University faculty Category:Colorado State University\u2013Pueblo faculty Category:Stevens Institute of Technology faculty Category:Case Western Reserve University faculty Category:21st-century Italian mathematicians Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
