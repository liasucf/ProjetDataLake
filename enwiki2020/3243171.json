    "text": "Lafayette Central Catholic Jr/Sr High School is a Roman Catholic secondary school serving grades 7\u201312 in Lafayette, Indiana. == History == Central Catholic was founded in 1956. In 1959, Senator John F. Kennedy brought his presidential campaign to Central Catholic. He spoke before thousands at a fund-raising dinner in McHale Gymnasium. In 1990, citing a lack of support, money, and enrollment, CC threatened to close its doors. Former bishop, William Higi, announced in the spring of 1990 that CC's doors would close at the end of the school year. The announcement resulted in a strong showing of support from the principal at that time, Dave Worland, which eventually led to the reversal of the decision to close the school's doors. ==Demographics== The demographic breakdown of the 440 students enrolled for the 2017\u201318 school year was: * American Indian/Alaska Native - 0% * Asian - 0.7% * Black - 2.0% * Hispanic - 6.4% * White - 90.9% * Native Hawaiian/Pacific islander - 0% * Two or more races - 0% == Athletics == Central Catholic is currently a member of the Hoosier Athletic Conference.
