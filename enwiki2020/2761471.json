It is the only high school in the Kannapolis City Schools district as well as the city of Kannapolis. A.L. Brown was recognized by DPI as a \"School of Distinction\" under the state's ABC standards for public education for the 2003\u20132010 school years. ==History== During the expansion of the Cannon Mills Corporation during the 1920s, James William Cannon donated a piece of land just east of the town for a school. Central High School would be built in 1924, about the same time, a new Concord High School opened. Later in 1930, Central High School was renamed J. W. Cannon High School, in honor of James William Cannon. In 1933, the school burned down, and was rebuilt in 1934. In 1951, the school was renamed A. L. Brown High School, and the school moved to a new building southeast of the old facility. The former building was converted into a junior high school, under the name Cannon Junior High School.Cannon High School students, early 1940s. Independent Tribune. Retrieved July 14, 2020. In 1967, George Washington Carver High School, Kannapolis' former high school for African Americans, merged with the then all-white A. L. Brown High School, as a result of school integration.George Washington Carver High School Faculty, 1953. Independent Tribune. Retrieved July 14, 2020. Over the course of the schools history, many additions have been built on to A. L. Brown, such as a separate vocational building, as well as a free-standing gymnasium. During the 2006\u201407 school year, a newer gymnasium facility opened on campus. These free-standing buildings give A. L. Brown its unique character. Instead of a traditional single building like most high schools, Brown has a small, college-like atmosphere with numerous buildings around a central courtyard. All buildings on the campus are built in the Colonial Williamsburg style of architecture. They also are brick with white trim, modeled after most of Kannapolis. A. L. Brown High School in February, 2006 On September 25, 2011, the STEM Academy, designed to resemble the nearby North Carolina Research Campus Core Lab, held its grand opening. The top two floors offer modern science labs, while the second floor will house communication classes. The basement has a health center and an international welcome center. In March 2012, the Stroup Arts Center opened. This replaced the previous Vocational Building or V-Building. This center also provides an Exceptional Children's Department, Dance Studio, Art Studio, Drafting, Culinary Arts, Foods 1 & 2, Theatre, & ROTC to the students of A. L. Brown High School. ==Timeline== *1924 \u2013 Central High School Opens *1930 \u2013 Renamed J. W. Cannon High School *1933 \u2013 J. W.
