At the age of ten, he and his family moved to Crete, Illinois, a small community south of Chicago. Growing up, he was more studious than rambunctious, preferring to spend Friday nights alone building model airplanes. His dream was to follow his father's footsteps as a physician, but became interested in acting watching his older sister Kerry perform. Shy in his adolescent years, he credits his prep football coach, Dave Mattio, with helping gain a positive self-esteem. After Egglesfield graduated from Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights, he attended Illinois Wesleyan University and played for the football team. He transferred to the University of Iowa, where he was in the pre-med program. After he received his BS from Iowa he backpacked throughout Europe. To earn money for medical school, Egglesfield turned to modeling. He won a contest after entering at the urging of a friend, and left medicine behind for a modeling career. He is signed with Beatrice Model agency in Milan, Italy, and DNA Model Management in New York City. He modeled for Versace, Calvin Klein, and Armani, among others before he started acting. In the late 1990s, he was featured on the covers of Vogue Italia (shot by Steven Meisel) and L'Uomo Vogue (twice, photographed by Bruce Weber and Ellen Von Unwerth respectively). ==Career== After taking drama classes, Egglesfield found himself guest starring on television series such as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, The $treet, Gilmore Girls, Charmed, and Nip/Tuck.
