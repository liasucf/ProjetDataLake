The project was financed by Louis XIV's personal chaplain, Fran\u00e7ois de la Chaise, \"and his grateful nephew, the original owner, named the chateau for his munificent uncle.\" The architect was Jules Hardouin-Mansart, and Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre designed the gardens. It has been listed as an official historical monument since April 27, 1972. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1675 Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in Rh\u00f4ne (department) Category:Monuments historiques of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Category:1675 establishments in France ",
