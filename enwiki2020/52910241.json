There were four conventional watermills on the brook, Upper Mill at Monxton, Upper Mill at Abbots Ann, Abbots Ann Mill and Sarsons Mill at Amport. ==Water quality== The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail. Water quality of the Pillhill Brook in 2016: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Section !! Ecological Status !! Chemical Status !! Overall Status !! Length !!
