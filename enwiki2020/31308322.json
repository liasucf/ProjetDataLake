    "text": "The Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS) is a towed 155 mm/52 calibre howitzer that is being developed for the Indian Army by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured by Bharat Forge. ATAGS has greater than 95% indigenous content. During user trials in September 2020 the gun suffered a barrel burst injuring four personnel. The malfunction is expected to setback the program with DRDO going back to the drawing board. ==Development== The Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS) project was started in 2013 by DRDO to replace older guns in service in the Indian Army with a modern 155mm artillery gun. DRDO laboratory Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) partnered with private players Bharat Forge Limited, Mahindra Defence Naval System, Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division and public sector unit Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) for this purpose. The development of the gun took about 4 years and is expected to be complete by March 2017. The delay in completion of the project was attributed to realization of ordnance and recoil system and supply issue with manufacturing of sub-systems. The gun is expected to start user trials in 2017 and production is expected to start in 2019. It was first publicly showcased at 68th Republic Day parade on 26 January 2017. == Design == The gun consists of a barrel, breech mechanism, muzzle brake and recoil mechanism to fire 155 mm calibre ammunition with a firing range of 48 km. It has an all electric drive to ensure reliability and minimum maintenance over a long period of time. It has advanced features like high mobility, quick deployability, auxiliary power mode, advanced communication system, automatic command and control system with night capability in direct fire mode. The gun is two ton lighter than guns in the same category and is designed to provide better accuracy and range and is capable of firing five successive rounds in short duration. It is compatible with C3I systems like Artillery Combat Command and Control System (ACCCS) called Shakti for technical fire control, fire planning, deployment management, operational logistics management of the Indian Army. ==Trials== *DRDO conducted the proof firing of armament for the 155/52 calibre Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System on 14 July 2016. The test was successful. *Fully integrated, 155-millimeter artillery gun fired its first rounds of live ammunition at the Proof and Experimental Establishment (PXE) in Balasore, Odisha on 14 December 2016. *During trials in 2017, ATAGS broke the world record for 155 mm gun by firing the round to a distance of 47.2 kilometres. It again registered a maximum distance of 48.074 kilometres with high explosive\u2013base bleed (HE\u2013BB) ammunition, surpassing the maximum ranges fired by any artillery gun system in this category. *The gun successfully completed trials and the manufacturing of first lot of 40 guns is to start soon. *The gun underwent user trials in September 2020 and suffered a major setback with a barrel burst. ==Users== * Indian Army - In August 2018, Defence Acquisition Council approved the procurement of 150 ATAGS with an estimated cost of . ==See also== * List of equipment of the Indian Army * Dhanush howitzer ==References== Category:Field artillery Category:Artillery of India Category:155 mm artillery ",
