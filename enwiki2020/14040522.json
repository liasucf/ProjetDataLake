    "text": "{| |} The Mettawee-class gasoline tanker was a class of small gasoline tankers based on the Maritime Commission standard T1-M-A2 hull that served in World War II. The ships were completed between 1943 and 1945. Despite being charged with the dangerous task of carrying a highly volatile cargo into battle, none of the Mettawee-class tankers were destroyed, but the USS Sheepscot capsized near Iwo Jima on 6 June 1945. ==Ships in class== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==References== * * Category:Auxiliary ship classes of the United States Navy Mettawee class gasoline tanker Mettawee class gasoline tanker Category:Auxiliary transport ship classes ",
