It was released on May 12, 2017. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $6 million. ==Plot== Danny is a talented but troubled graffiti artist. His mother is dead, and his father, Miguel, would rather have Danny working in the family auto shop, helping to make the coveted lowriders that are so important in their East L.A. Latino culture. Their relationship is further strained when Danny is arrested for tagging a bridge and must be bailed out. Danny's older brother Francisco, nicknamed \"Ghost\", is released from a long prison stint. His relationship with his father is also strained, due to Miguel's past drinking problem, the way he treated their mother and the fact that he didn't go visit him while he was in prison. Danny enters into a relationship with a young photographer, Lorelei, that exposes him to a different avenue to share his graffiti skills. Ghost and Danny decide to enter their own car in the big Elysian Park lowrider competition, against their father's legendary \"Green Poison.\" When Miguel's car wins, Ghost sends his crew to destroy the car and in the ensuing confrontation Miguel gets shot. He survives and Danny visits his father at the hospital where he encounters his crying stepmother who informs him that his father needs to see him. Danny dedicates his time in fixing another lowrider which he names \"Marisol\", as his mother, and showing at the El Chele exclusive invitation only car show. The trials and tribulations everyone faces leads Danny to decide his life's true direction, Miguel to come to terms with the consequences of all his life's actions and a family to unite within the confines of a lowrider culture that is unique, special and little understood. == Cast == == Production == === Casting === On May 21, 2015, Melissa Benoist joined the cast, replacing Lily Collins and Nicola Peltz.

Huffington Post contributor Dwight Brown wrote: \"They\u2019ve created a compelling story with deeply drawn characters and heart-felt drama, which is perfectly dispensed and measured throughout the film. Andr\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez\u2019s camera makes the colors of the retro, lowrider autos saturated and vibrant. Interior scenes in East LA jump off the screen because of Melanie Jones\u2019 production design and Karuna Karmarkar\u2019s set decoration. The art direction, by Hunter Brown and Eve McCarney, keeps the palette in the earth tones or bright primary colors that symbolize the culture and the locale. Mirren Gordon-Crozier takes great pains to make the clothes look real, like they belong to the characters and not the wardrobe department. Editors Billy Fox (Straight Outta Compton) and Kiran Pallegadda (American Heist) put their foot on the gas pedal and don\u2019t let up until the final credits come after 98 judiciously chosen minutes of footage. Overall, the film\u2019s consistent feel and tone is the product of director Ricardo de Montreuil, who uses his background in film TV, advertising and print to make each set visually appealing. Every scene is racked with emotion and every performance is as resolved as possible. Montreuil gives audiences an intimate look at a car culture and a Latino/American experience that had become the lifeblood of Southern California.\" https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lowriders_b_590f85ffe4b046ea176aec9f == See also == * List of hood films == References == == External links == * * Category:2016 films Category:American films Category:Films produced by Jason Blum Category:Films produced by Brian Grazer Category:Films directed by Ricardo de Montreuil Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films about automobiles Category:American drama films Category:2016 drama films Category:Blumhouse Productions films Category:Imagine Entertainment films ",
