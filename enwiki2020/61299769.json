    "text": "Casterton railway station Casterton railway station was a railway station on the Casterton railway line in Victoria, Australia. The station was built by A. C. Findley, and opened in 1886. A mixed Passenger\u2013goods train continued to operate on the Casterton Line until 1949 when the passenger service was withdrawn. On 15 March 1954, a rail\u2013car service between Branxholme and Casterton was started on a basis of seeing whether it would be profitable or not. This service was cancelled on 31 July 1954.http://www.swvic.org/casterton/railway_station.htm However, the station was never demolished, and following a period of restoration, now operates as a tourist attraction. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Victoria (Australia) ",
