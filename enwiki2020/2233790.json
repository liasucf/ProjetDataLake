    "text": "It Dreams is the debut album by Jakalope, released on October 26, 2004. The music videos made for the album are known for the clone and hybrid theme connected to the band. Videos featuring Dave Ogilvie as a Dr. Evar and Katie B presented a sort of story for fans to follow, bolstered by a site contest which allowed fans insight into the so-called 'Jakalope world', and hinted at the back story of Dr. Evar and Katie's characters. A large part of the plot was left to the interpretation of fans in the end, especially concerning the Katie B character. As a CD, this album is only available as an import from Canada and Japan. However, the album is available as a download from iTunes in both the United States and Canada. Samples of the music, along with videos, can be found at Jakalope's web site. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from Discogs. *Jim McGrath \u2013 additional arrangements *Vincent Marcone \u2013 art direction *Rosemary Ogilvie \u2013 artwork *Trent Reznor \u2013 co-producer *Jamey Koch \u2013 co-producer, mixing *I Braineater \u2013 logo design *Aubrey Winfield \u2013 executive producer *Tom Baker \u2013 mastering *Phil Western \u2013 additional mixing *Daryn Barry, John Nazario \u2013 mixing assistants (Orange Lounge) *Mike Cashin, Pete MacLaggan \u2013 mixing assistants (Warehouse) *Dave Ogilvie \u2013 recording, production, mixing, songwriter *Anthony Valcic \u2013 recording, production, mixing *Bryan Gallant \u2013 assistant recording *Kirk McNally \u2013 assistant recording ==References== Category:2004 debut albums Category:Jakalope albums ",
