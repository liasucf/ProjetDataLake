    "text": "Ester H. Segal is an Israeli nanotechnology researcher and professor in the Department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, where she heads the Laboratory for Multifunctional Nanomaterials. She is also affiliated with the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. Segal is best known for her research of porous silicon nanomaterials, as well as nanocomposite materials for active packaging technologies to extend the shelf life of food. In 2019, Lady Globes named her one of Israel's top 50 most influential women. Segal is part of the Editorial Advisory Board for the journal ACS Sensors, international advisory board for the Porous Semiconductors Science and Technology biannual conference, and organizing committee member for Israel Society for Biotechnology and Engineering. == Education == Segal received her bachelor of science degree cum laude in chemical engineering from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in 1997. She earned her master of science degree and PhD from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in polymer science. == Research and career == Segal competed her graduate research with Moshe Narkis at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, where she developed electrically conductive polymer systems and their application as sensors for volatile organic compounds. After completing her PhD in 2004, Segal was awarded the Rothschild Postdoctoral Fellowship and joined the group of Michael J. Sailor at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego from 2004 to 2007. There, she developed porous silicon nanomaterials for drug delivery and optical biosensing purposes. In 2007, Segal returned to Israel and joined the Department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology to begin her own research lab. She was promoted to the rank of full professor in 2020. Her research lab focuses on coupling materials science with chemistry and biotechnology to address problems in food technology and medicine. Specific areas of in which Segal's research has contributed include optical biosensing, silicon-based therapeutics, silicon-polymer hybrids, and food packaging technologies. === Optical biosensors === Fabry-Perot interferometers Using electrochemical etched mesoporous silicon, Segal's research group has developed label-free, optical sensors by means of Fabry-Perot interferometry. These sensors, containing pores between 10 and 100 nm have been engineered to detect analytes such as proteins, DNA, whole bacteria cells, amphipathic molecules on lipid bilayers, organophosphorus compounds, heavy metal ions, and proteolytic products from enzymatic activity. Some of Segal's sensors have been integrated with isotachophoresis and/or engineered with specific surface functionalizations (e.g. attached proteins, enzymes, aptamers, and antimicrobial peptides) to enhance the limits of detection for certain analytes. Segal has helped engineer hybrid porous silicon materials for sensing purposes, including carbon dot-infused silicon transducers, hydrogel- confined silicon substrates, and polymer-silicon hybrids. Diffraction gratings Segal's research group engineered microstructured silicon optical sensors for the detection and monitoring of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, in both clinical samples and food. The microstructured substrates serve as reflective diffraction gratings for label-free measurements of refractive index. By tracking bacterial growth in response to antibiotics, Segal's group (in collaboration with the Department of Urology at the Bnai Zion hospital and Ha'Emek Medical Center) developed a means of rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing for clinical samples. === Porous silicon therapeutics === Segal and her research team engineered porous silicon carriers containing nerve growth factor for delivery to the brain in Alzheimer's models, in addition to carriers of anti-cancer drugs to diseased tissue and bone morphogenetic protein 2. She also demonstrated the delivery of anti-cancer drugs captured in silicon microparticles with a pneumatic capillary gene gun. She has studied the kinetics and degradation of porous silicon therapeutics in disease models, finding that porous silicon materials tend to degrade at faster rates in diseased tissue environments compared to healthy tissue. === Food packaging technologies === In contrast to the research on silicon nanomaterials, a large part of Segal's research focuses on the development of new technologies for active packaging of food usually through the incorporation of polymers, nanomaterials, and essential oils. These materials have antimicrobial properties, allowing them to preserve food for longer times, and in turn, reducing food waste. == Awards == * 2019 ACS Advances in Measurement Science Lectureship Award for her work on photonic crystal sensing. *2019 Lady Globes named her one of Israel's top 50 most influential women *2017 Discovery Award for Team Prismatix (part of UK Longitude Prize Contest) antimicrobial resistance testing technology *2016 Hershel Rich Innovation Award *2016 Daniel Shiran Memorial Research Prize for outstanding research in biomedicine *2015 Yanai Prize for Excellence in Academic Education *2014 Henry Taub Award for Academic Excellence *2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 Technion Excellence in Teaching Award == Entrepreneurship == Segal serves as the CTO to BactuSense Technologies Ltd and was the project coordinator of Nanopak, an EU-funded project that developed food packaging products in order to extend the shelf life of food. == Personal life == Segal is a cancer survivor, married, and has two children. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology alumni Category:Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology faculty Category:Nanotechnologists Category:Israeli women engineers Category:Israeli chemical engineers Category:Polymer scientists and engineers Category:Women engineers Category:Israeli women scientists ",
