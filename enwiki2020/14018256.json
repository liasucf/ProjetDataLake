    "text": "Fernando Francisco Reges Mouta (born 25 July 1987), known simply as Fernando (), is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Spanish club Sevilla as a defensive midfielder. He spent most of his career with Porto with whom he signed in 2007, going on to appear in 236 competitive matches and win 12 major titles, including four Primeira Liga championships and the 2011 Europa League. He also played professionally in England, Turkey and Spain, winning the domestic league twice with Galatasaray and the 2016 League Cup with Manchester City. ==Club career== Fernando in 2010 ===Porto=== Fernando was born in Alto Para\u00edso de Goi\u00e1s. In June 2007 he signed a five-year contract with FC Porto directly from the S\u00e9rie C, having started his career at Vila Nova Futebol Clube. However, he spent his first year in Portugal loaned to C.F. Estrela da Amadora, where he was first-choice. In the 2008\u201309 season, having returned to Porto, Fernando was an ever-present midfield fixture alongside established Lucho Gonz\u00e1lez and Raul Meireles, as the northerners achieved a fourth consecutive Primeira Liga title. He continued to be a starter when healthy, appearing in 41 competitive games during the 2010\u201311 campaign (including two goals in nearly 3,000 minutes of action) as his team won the treble. On 9 February 2014, following an extensive negotiation that inclusively saw the player being suspended, Fernando renewed his contract with Porto until 2017. ===Manchester City=== On 25 June 2014, Fernando completed a move to Manchester City for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of \u00a312 million. Upon arriving, he said: \"I will give my all every time I play and I'm looking forward to many happy years in Manchester\". He made his competitive debut on 10 August in the 2014 FA Community Shield, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0\u20133 loss against Arsenal at Wembley Stadium; he first appeared in the Premier League a week later, in a 2\u20130 win away to Newcastle United. Fernando scored his first goal for City on 26 December 2014, contributing to a 3\u20131 away win over West Bromwich Albion. He featured 90 minutes in the final of the League Cup on 28 February 2016, helping defeat Liverpool on penalties. On 4 May, he scored an own goal after 20 minutes of the UEFA Champions League semi-final fixture against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium \u2013 the first time the club coached by Manuel Pellegrini had reached that stage\u2013 in an eventual 0\u20131 loss (also on aggregate). During his three-year spell at the City of Manchester Stadium, Fernando played 102 official matches and scored four times. ===Galatasaray=== On 4 August 2017, Fernando signed with Galatasaray SK on a three-year contract for an initial fee of \u20ac5.25 million. In a note published on the Turkish club's official website, it was confirmed that the payment would ascend based on the accomplishment of certain performance variables during his spell. He made his S\u00fcper Lig debut in the first fixture, playing 82 minutes in a 4\u20131 home win against Kayserispor; he made 26 official appearances during the season, scoring on 9 December in a 4\u20132 home victory over against Akhisar Belediyespor and repeating the feat the following 29 April to help defeat reigning champions Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K. 2\u20130 at home, a result which proved decisive for achieving the league title. ===Sevilla=== On 12 July 2019, aged 32, Fernando joined Sevilla FC of the Spanish La Liga for a fee of \u20ac4.5 million, agreeing to a deal until 30 June 2022. ==International career== Fernando was in the Brazil under-20 squad at the 2007 South American Youth Championship, where he was sent off in the second round against Chile for assaulting referee Albert Duarte, as the nation went on to win the tournament in Paraguay. Subsequently, he received a one-year ban from CONMEBOL competitions for his actions and was not included for the following tournament in the category, the 2007 FIFA World Cup. In January 2013, Fernando declared: \"Even if someone asked me to naturalize, I would refuse. My dream is to play for Brazil. I'm sure one day I will wear the amarelinha\". In December, however, he became a Portuguese citizen, applying to FIFA in March 2014 to change his international allegiance to Portugal; under article 8.1 of the governing body's statutes, however, he was only eligible to represent Brazil internationally as he previously played for that country at under-20 level and at that time he did not hold Portuguese nationality. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Estrela Amadora |2007\u201308 |Primeira Liga |26||1||3||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||1 |- |rowspan=\"7\"|Porto |2008\u201309 |Primeira Liga |25||0||4||0||2||0||10||0||0||0||41||0 |- |2009\u201310 |Primeira Liga |25||0||6||0||1||0||6||0||1||0||39||0 |- |2010\u201311 |Primeira Liga |21||0||4||0||1||1||14||1||1||0||41||2 |- |2011\u201312 |Primeira Liga |22||1||1||0||2||0||8||0||1||0||34||1 |- |2012\u201313 |Primeira Liga |24||1||1||0||5||1||6||0||1||0||37||2 |- |2013\u201314 |Primeira Liga |25||0||4||1||4||0||11||0||1||0||45||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !142!!2!!20!!1!!15!!2!!55!!1!!5!!0!!237!!6 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Manchester City |2014\u201315 |Premier League |25||2||2||0||0||0||5||0||1||0||33||2 |- |2015\u201316 |Premier League |24||2||3||0||5||0||10||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||42||2 |- |2016\u201317 |Premier League |15||0||4||0||2||0||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !64!!4!!9!!0!!7!!0!!21!!0!!1!!0!!102!!4 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Galatasaray |2017\u201318 |S\u00fcper Lig |25||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||26||2 |- |2018\u201319 |S\u00fcper Lig |22||2||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0||1||0||32||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !47!!4!!5!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!5!!0!!1!!0!!58!!4 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Sevilla |2019\u201320 |La Liga |34||2||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||42||3 |- |2020\u201321 |La Liga |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !34!!2!!1!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!7!!0!!1!!0!!43!!3 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career Total !306!!12!!34!!2!!24!!2!!87!!1!!8!!0!!459!!17 |} ==Honours== Vila Nova *Campeonato Goiano: 2005 Porto *Primeira Liga: 2008\u201309, 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312, 2012\u201313 *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 2008\u201309, 2009\u201310, 2010\u201311 *Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira: 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 *UEFA Europa League: 2010\u201311 Manchester City *Football League Cup: 2015\u201316 Galatasaray *S\u00fcper Lig: 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319 *Turkish Cup: 2018\u201319 Sevilla * UEFA Europa League: 2019\u201320 Brazil U20 *South American Youth Championship: 2007 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Goi\u00e1s Category:Portuguese people of Brazilian descent Category:Naturalised citizens of Portugal Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C players Category:Vila Nova Futebol Clube players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:FC Porto players Category:C.F.
