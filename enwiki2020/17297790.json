After the war, he became a member of the Breton nationalist political movement Breiz Atao. He was one of the founders in 1923 of the artistic movement Seiz Breur, along with Jeanne Malivel and Ren\u00e9-Yves Creston. His aim was to revitalise Breton sacred art: crosses, votive objects and traditional crafts. He also designed and supported pottery, ceramics, embroidery and cabinetmaking. Between 1924 and 1935, he was an architect in Perros-Guirec, where he developed a successful practice building holiday villas. In 1929 he joined with Xavier de Langlais to found An Droellen, a workshop of Breton Christian art. The duo worked closely together on a number of projects, including the college chapel of St. Joseph in Lannion. The workshop included among its members Mlle M\u00e9nard (glazier), Madame Planiol (restoration of priestly vestments) and Jules-Charles Le Bozec (sculptor). In the late 1930s Bouill\u00e9 created the Chapel of Koat-Keo in Scrignac (Finist\u00e8re), built at the initiative of his friend Abbot Jean-Marie Perrot, founder of the Breton Catholic youth organization Bleun-Brug, which promoted traditional Breton culture. The chapel is seen as a significant attempt to create a distinctive modern Breton sacred architecture.Ministry of Culture, Merim\u00e9e. Monuments historiques: Chapelle de Koat-Keo During the World War II, Perrot and Breun-Blug were suspected of collaborationist activity. In 1941, Bouill\u00e9 was made director of Bleun-Brug and sat on the Advisory Committee of Brittany, as its representative. The Committee was seen by resistance activists as part of the collaborationist r\u00e9gime. At this time he advocated a radical plan to build a new Breton capital city to be called \"Brittia\", which would be a \"Celtic Brasilia\" on the shores of Lake Guerl\u00e9dan.Herv\u00e9 Le Boterf, La Bretagne dans la guerre, Volume 3, p. 320 Due to his association with Perrot and the committee, he was interned after the Liberation of France. He died in 1945, as a result of his internment. In Brittany, at least nine streets bear his name.Les Noms qui ont fait l'histoire de Bretagne, Coop Breizh et Institut culturel de Bretagne, 1997 ==Major buildings== *1933: holiday home, known as Kelenn, 18 chemin de Quo-Vadis, subdivision of Tourony-plage at T\u00e9gastel *1936-1937: Chapelle de l'Institution Saint-Joseph (in fact Saint-Joseph college) in Lannion *1937: Chapel Koat-Keo at Scrignac, created for the Abbot Perrot, with sculptures by Jules-Charles Le Bozec.
