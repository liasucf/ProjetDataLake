    "text": "3 Field Engineer Regiment / Ihawu Field Engineer Regiment is a regiment of the South African Army Engineer Formation. The unit is based in Cape Town, Western Cape. The role of the Engineers is to maintain mobility and serviceability of own forces and counter mobility of enemy forces. Tasks include bridging, water purification, obstacles, demolition, infrastructure repair and development. As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit. ==History== ===Origin=== 3 Field Engineer Regiment was formed in 1926 as three engineer companies. ===World War II=== In 1940, 3 Field was mobilized for World War 2 and saw service in North Africa, where it participated in the desert campaign and the Battle of El Alamein. 3rd Field Company was attached to 1st S.A. Division and played an important part in the Division's first operation - the raid to capture El Wak - by ensuring water supplies. The Company served with distinction throughout the campaign in Ethiopia and Abyssinia. In one of the strangest of combined operations, No 1 Section was required to set bangalore torpedoes to blow up the outer and inner barbed wire entanglements protecting Fort Todenyang on the shore of Lake Rudolf. By 1946 the unit was designated as 3 Field Squadron and along with 1 Field Squadron from Durban, 2 Field Squadron from Port Elizabeth and 8 Field Park Squadron from Cape Town, formed 2 Field Engineer Regiment.http://www.warinangola.com/Default.aspx?tabid=1239&ParameterString;=South%20African%20Army&ParameterString2;=Engineers ===Border War=== By 1975, 3 Field was mobilised for service in South West Africa for Operation Savanah, and was in service until withdrawal in 1988. ===Post 1994=== Since 1994 the regiment maintained a small footprint due to financial restrictions. 3 Field still participates in Exercise Bailey each year. 3 Field celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2006. ====Name Change==== In August 2019 52 units of the Reserve Force had their names to reflect the diversity of the current SANDF. https://www.defenceweb.co.za/featured/new- reserve-force-unit-names/ This unit had its name changed to Ihawu Field Engineer Regiment. ==Insignia== ===Previous Insignia=== SADF era 3 Field Engineer Regiment insignia == Leadership == == References == == External links == Category:Engineer regiments of South Africa Category:Military units and formations established in 1926 ",
