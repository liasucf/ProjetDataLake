    "text": "Gerald R. Weeks is an American author and lecturer. He has published 25 books on psychotherapy, which have been translated into multiple languages. He has published in the fields of individual, and family therapy, although he is best known for his work in sex and couple\u2019s therapy. Weeks is the founder of the Systems Approach to Sex Therapy as well as the founder of the Intersystem Approach to therapy which has been called one of the most ambitious efforts to develop an integrative approach to psychotherapy. He was a professor in the Marriage and Family Therapy Program at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas from 1999-2017. In 2017, he became Professor Emeritus as he retired from UNLV. == Biography == Weeks is a native of North Carolina but has lived throughout the US working as a professor in major universities. He was born in Morehead, NC and currently resides in the Seattle area with his wife, Nancy. He earned a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in both Clinical Psychology and Family Studies in 1979 from Georgia State University. At Georgia State University, he studied with Luciano L'Abate who is the founder of the field of family psychology and one of the most published psychologists in the world. == Professional career == Since 1979, Weeks has served in a number of professional positions including: Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of North Carolina, Program Director at Council for Relationships, and later Clinical Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He also served as President of the American Board of Family Psychology in 1988 and 1989. He was Professor and Chair for the Marriage and Family Therapy Program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas from 1999-2013. In 2013, he became a professor in the program. His development of the Intersystem Approach to therapy (see Weeks & Hof, 1994) has been one of his major achievements. It is a theoretical framework which combines individual, couple, and intergenerational factors in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals, couples, and families. Several books have been published demonstrating its application in couples and sex therapy. This theory is designed to fit the therapy to clients rather than forcing clients conform to the therapist's theoretical framework. The Intersystem Approach is an integrative and dialectical framework, that explores how individuals, couples, family systems and communities function in their relationships. it includes two constructs: (1) the attachment theory construct, and (2) the interactional construct. Gerald R. Weeks. Klaus F. Riegel asserted that development proceeds in for dimensions simultaneously: 1) inner-biological, 2) individual- psychological, 3) cultural-sociological, and 4) outer-physical. The approach uses genograms (a graphic representation of an intergenerational family tree that displays the interactions of families through multiple generations). Within genograms, clinicians can develop maps and timelines for each of the four domains, and Internal Models Map (IMM). Early in his career he was influential in the development of strategic therapy. His book on paradoxical psychotherapy was one of the top selling professional books in the field of psychotherapy. In addition to being a professor and author of many advanced professional books, he has lectured and trained clinicians throughout the world. He began providing training to clinicians in Turkey in 2011 and today there are 2,000 therapists in the country who are practicing his approach to couple and sex therapy. == Clinical background and experience == Weeks received his doctorate in psychology with specializations in both Clinical Psychology and Family Psychology (couple and family therapy). In fact, he was the second psychologist in the U.S. to receive a doctorate with a specialization in Family Psychology. His clinical mentor was Luciano L\u2019Abate who is the founder of the field of Family Psychology. Further, Dr. Weeks holds every advanced certification and board certification one can obtain the fields of couple and sex therapy - Clinical Fellow; Certified Sex Therapist and Supervisor; Diplomate (Board Certified), American Board of Sexology, American Board of Couple and Family Psychology. His areas of specialization have been individual and couple relational issues as well as sex therapy for the past 35 years. He has written numerous professional texts and has provided over 30,000 hours of couple/sex therapy. In 1985, be became the youngest director of training at the Marriage Council of Philadelphia (currently called Council for Relationships)/Division of Family Studies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Marriage Council was the birthplace of couple therapy and has been in continuous operation since 1932. As the director of a post-master\u2019s program, he was responsible for training over 300 clinicians in advanced principles of couple therapy. He also founded the Institute for Sex Therapy during his tenure at PENN. Weeks is the founder of the systemic approach to sex therapy and the Intersystem Approach to Therapy. Both approaches propose that problems must be conceptualized within the context in which they occur from the broadest possible perspective. He focuses on factors that contribute to problems which include medical/drug induced effects, individual/psychological issues, couple dysfunction, and the effect of the family-of-origin. A systematically organized integrative plan of treatment is then developed. In addition, he believes that therapy should be about more than just solving the immediate problem, but strive to produce optimal functioning. == Recognition == He received the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy \"Outstanding Contribution to the Field of Marriage and Family Therapy\" award in 2009 and \"The 2010 Family psychologist of the year\" award from the Society for Family Psychology, which is part of the American Psychological Association. == Publications == Besides his books,[ WorldCat author listing] Weeks has published scientific journal articles and book chapters.
