(original 1705), New Edition, corrected by the Author (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1821) . One of the foremost teachers of his age, and the first Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Cambridge, he played a great part in the revival of Greek learning in England.See an extensive study in Paul S. Needham, 'Sir John Cheke at Cambridge and Court', 2 vols., Ph.D. Dissertation, Harvard University (1971). He was tutor to Prince Edward, the future King Edward VI, and also sometimes to Princess Elizabeth.

He went into voluntary exile abroad, at first under royal licence (which he overstayed). He was captured and imprisoned in 1556, and under threat or apprehension of execution by the fire made a forced public recantation and affiliated himself to the Church of Rome. He died not long afterwards, filled with remorse for having forsworn his true belief from the infirmity of fear. His character, teaching and reputation were, however, admiringly and honourably upheld.T. Cooper, 'Cheke, Sir John (1514\u20131557)', Dictionary of National Biography (1885\u20131900), Vol. X.A.

At the time of John's birth, the family seat had been, for more than a century, at Mottistone in the Isle of Wight.'Cheeke', in W.C.

(the son of Robert Cheke of Mottistone), was Esquire Bedell of the University of Cambridge from 1509 until his death in 1529. John's mother was Agnes Duffield, daughter of Andrew Duffield of Cambridge: John was born in that city in 1514, and had five sisters, Ann, Alice, Elizabeth, Magdalen, and Mary. His grammatical education was begun by John Morgan, M.A.C.H. Cooper & T. Cooper, Athenae Cantabrigienses, I: 1500\u20131585 (Deighton, Bell & Co/Macmillan & Co, Cambridge 1858), pp. 166-170. He was educated at St John's College, where he proceeded to receive a B.A. in 1529, and obtained a Fellowship. He commenced with an M.A. in 1533.J. Venn and J.A. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses I.i (Cambridge University Press, 1922), p. 328. His tutor was George Day, who became an opponent of the Edwardian Reformation.Johnson, 'Cheke, Sir John', History of Parliament online. In the University Cheke, and his friend Thomas Smith (a student of Civil Law at Queens' College), were thought so outstanding that each was granted an exhibition by King Henry to support them in their studies. Both were largely impressed by the classical learning of John Redman, who had studied in Paris, and sought to emulate him. Both Queens' College (where the influence of Erasmus remained) and St John's fostered Reformist principles which Cheke and Smith embraced.J. Strype, The Life of the Learned Sir Thomas Smith, Kt., D.C.L., New Edition with corrections and additions by the author (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1820), pp. 8-9. During the early 1530s Cheke and Smith studied together privately to restore proper definition to the pronunciation of ancient Greek diphthongs, which by custom had become obscured. The language itself, its cadences and inflexions of meaning, thereby gained new life and the works of the ancient scholars and orators were freshly received and understood. Smith, giving Greek lectures from 1533, around 1535 began to make public trial of these effects, and soon gained a following. Smith's student John Poynet, succeeding his tutor, maintained the new pronunciation in his lectures: both Cheke and Smith began to coach students in their method, and the Plutus of Aristophanes was acted at St. John's in the new manner.Strype, The Life of the learned Sir Thomas Smith, pp. 8-14. After Poynet as Greek Reader came Roger Ascham,For Ascham's letters to Cheke, see J.A. Giles, The Whole Works of Roger Ascham, Vol. I Part I: Life, &c.;, and Letters (John Russell Smith, London 1865), passim. Cheke's student, who read Isocrates, at first disputing but afterwards coming round fully to the innovations, which also won the approval of John Redman. The broadening and reinvigorating of classical antique literacy and scholarship, preserved through the mediaeval philosophical schools, opened also the biblical and patristic uses of ancient Greek language to fresh interpretations through the exercise of private thought and study, and to new perspectives of Athens, Rome and Byzantium. === Academic manoeuvres === John Cheke inscribed the names on a famous series of portraits by Hans Holbein the Younger. Through the mediation of Matthew Parker, Cheke obtained the support of Anne Boleyn for his student William Bill to continue his studies.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 8-9. After a year as Master of St John's, and as University Vice- Chancellor, George Day was appointed by King Henry to be Provost of King's College in 1538, Smith having become University Orator in 1537 in succession to him.'Day, George', in Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, I.ii (Cambridge University Press, 1922) p. 22. In 1540, at the King's creation of the Regius Professorships, Smith was made Professor of Law, Cheke Professor of Greek, and John Blythe (of King's College)Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, I.i, p. 171. Professor of Physick.Strype, Life of the learned Sir Thomas Smith, pp. 10-14. Blythe married Alice, one of Cheke's sisters, before 1536, and in 1541 William Cecil (afterwards Lord Burleigh), Cheke's distinguished student, married Mary Cheke, another.Metcalfe, Visitations of Essex; Rylands, Visitation of Hampshire. (Mary Cecil died two years later, leaving Cecil with a son, Thomas Cecil.) In 1542 one \"Mistress Cheke\" was still resident in the Cheke home at Market Hill, Cambridge.Will of William Sabyn, Sergeant at the arms of Ipswich, Suffolk (PCC 1543, Spert quire). In June 1542 Bishop Gardiner, a discerning and intransigent man, as Chancellor of the University issued his Edict to all who recognized his authority that the sounds customarily used for the pronunciation of Greek or Latin should not be changed by anyone, and gave a list of them with phonetic explanations. He pronounced severe and potentially exclusionist penalties at all levels of the academic hierarchy for those who contravened this ruling, and further wrote to the Vice-Chancellor requiring that his edict be observed.J. Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials: Relating Chiefly to Religion and the Reformation of it, 3 Vols (John Wyat, London 1721), I, Appendix of records and originals, No. CXVI, pp. 326-27. Cheke, as one of the principal targets of Gardiner's disapproval, entered into a correspondence of seven letters with him,De Pronuntiatione Graecae potissimum linguae disputationes cum Stephano Vuintoniensi episcopo, septem contrariis epistolis comprehensae (N. Episcopium iuniorem, Basel 1555). Reprint ed. R.C. Alston, Collection of facsimile reprints, No. 2, Scholar Press (1968). but the Bishop remained inflexible.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 15-19. However the seeds of his method had been sown, and took root. At that time the letters remained unpublished. In that year Cheke was incorporated M.A. at the University of Oxford, being made a canon of King Henry VIII's College.Cooper, Athenae Cantabrigienses, pp. 166-170. In 1544 he succeeded Smith as Public Orator in the University of Cambridge.Alumni Cantabrigienses, I.i, p. 328. Day, consecrated Bishop of Chichester in 1543, remained Provost of King's.Alumni Cantabrigienses, I.ii, p. 22. At this time Cheke prepared his Latin translation (dedicated to the King) of the De Apparatu Bellico of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI, often sharing and talking over his work with Roger Ascham.R. Ascham, 'Toxophilus, the Schole of Shootinge contayned in two bookes' (orig. In aedibus Edouardi Whytchurch, London 1545), in W.A. Wright (ed.), Roger Ascham: English Works (Cambridge University Press 1904), pp. vii- xx, 1-119, at pp. 45-46. Thomas Hoby was then one of his pupils.E. Powell (ed.), The Travels and Life of Sir Thomas Hoby, Kt., of Bisham Abbey, written by himself. 1547\u20131564 (Royal Historical Society, London 1902), pp. x-xi. Cheke's reading and thought in the Greek Histories, and his use of them to extract examples of policy and conduct, can be studied in his annotations to print copies (from the Aldine Press) of Herodotus and Thucydides.St. Johns's College, Cambridge, shelfmark Aa.4.48, see J. Harmer, 'Sir John Cheke's Greek Books', Centre for Material Texts (Cambridge, June 2010), website. In 1543 and 1545 his Latin versions of the homilies of St John Chrysostom were published, opening with a letter of dedication to his patron the King. On 10 June 1544Cheke told Girolamo Cardano he was selected on 10 June (see below), but he commenced in July: J.G. Nichols, 'Biographical Memoir of King Edward the Sixth', in Literary Remains of King Edward the Sixth, Roxburghe Club (J.B. Nichols and Son, London 1857), I, p. xxxix. Cheke was appointed tutor to the future King Edward VI of England, as a supplement to his tutor Dr Richard Cox, to teach him \"of toungues, of the scripture, of philosophie and all liberal sciences\" (as the Prince wrote in his JournalBritish Library, Cotton MS Nero C.X, fol. 11r.), and commenced his duties at Hampton Court soon afterwards. At the Prince's invitation, the young Henry Hastings shared in his studies.C. Cross, The Puritan Earl. The Life of Henry Hastings, Third Earl of Huntingdon, 1536\u20131595 (Macmillan, London 1966), pp. 9-10. Roger Ascham felt strongly Cheke's absence from the University, where his example was so inspirational.Ascham (ed. Wright), Toxophilus, pp. 45-46. Special interest has been found in Cheke's lengthy preface to his Latin translation of Plutarch's De Superstitione,University College, Oxford, MS 171 (in Bodleian Library). prepared as a New Year's gift for the King in 1545 or 1546.J.A. McDiarmid, 'John Cheke's Preface to \"De Superstitione\",' Journal of Ecclesiastical History Vol. 48 Issue 1, January 1997 (Cambridge University Press), pp. 100-120 (Cambridge Core). Edward's tutor in French, the Huguenot Jean Belmain, was Cheke's nephew by marriage.D. MacCulloch, Tudor Church Militant: Edward VI and the Protestant Reformation (Penguin UK, 2017), at note 35 (Google). Ascham's pupil William Grindal was, at his recommendation to Cheke, chosen to read Greek to Princess Elizabeth, until his untimely death in 1548.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, p. 9. By that time William Bill was Master of St John's,'Bill, William', Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses I.i, p. 151. and John Redman Master of the newly-founded Trinity College (1546), in which Bill succeeded him in 1551.T.

Cheke married Mary, daughter of Richard Hill (formerly Sergeant of the Wine-cellar to Henry VIII) and now stepdaughter of Sir John Mason. Cheke's religious and scholarly purpose bore fruit in the highest quarters. Gerard Langbaine the elder expressed it thus: > \"under God M. Cheek was a speciall instrument of the propagation of the > Gospell, & that Religion which we now professe in this Kingdome. For he not > only sowed the seeds of that Doctrine in the heart of Prince EDWARD, which > afterwards grew up into a generall Reformation when he came to be King, but > by his meanes the same saveing truth was gently instilled into the Lady > ELIZABETH, by those who by his procurement were admitted to be the Guides of > her younger Studies.\"G.

Cheke developed a system of phonetic spelling of English which was never much used except by himself. == Edwardian statesman == === Status and compromise === King Edward VI by William Scrots. Royal Collection, Windsor. Upon the accession of Edward to the throne Cheke, now Schoolmaster to the King,Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, p. 32 ff. was made a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, being allowed an annuity of \u00a3100 from the Augmentations in August. On 1 October he was returned to Parliament as a member for Bletchingley, Sussex, probably under the patronage of Sir Thomas Cawarden. He was very soon placed in a compromise by Thomas Seymour (brother of the Duke of Somerset), who had drafted a letter as from the King to the Lords of the Parliament House seeking their approval to separate the offices of Lord Protector and Lord Regent, and to appoint Thomas Seymour himself as Protector. He urged Cheke to pass the letter to the King and to induce him to sign it, which Cheke refused to do, stating that Lord Paget had prohibited any such dealings. At Christmas, Seymour followed this up with a gift of \u00a340 to Cheke, half for himself and half for the King. Seymour approached the King himself without success: Edward took Cheke's advice, and refused to sign it.See Cheke's 'Confession', in P.F. Tytler, England under Edward VI and Mary, 2 vols (Richard Bentley, London 1839), I, pp. 154-55. Thomas Seymour On 1 April 1548 Cheke was chosen by special mandate of the King, overriding university statutes, to replace his former tutor George Day as Provost of King's College. He received by purchase a large grant of lands in London and elsewhere, including the site of the former College of St John the Baptist at Stoke-by- Clare in Suffolk, in October 1548.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, I: 1547\u20131548 (London, HMSO 1924), pp. 284-85. Matthew Parker, its dean, had established a school there, and after its superstitious constitution had been dissolved he advised Cheke on its condition and maintenance.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 37-38. The Seymour affair came to a head in January 1548/9, when Thomas Seymour was formally charged with using improper means to influence King Edward, and Cheke became implicated as his likely accomplice. On 11 January Cheke came near to losing his office as schoolmaster to the King. Seymour confessed the gift, but on 20 February Cheke exonerated himself by an honest declaration of his dealings in the matter.Cheke's 'Confession', in England under Edward VI and Mary, I, pp. 154-55. Unfortunately Mistress Cheke offended the Duchess of Somerset in the course of these proceedings, and an apology had to be made.J.G. Nichols, 'Some Additions to the biographies of Sir John Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith', Archaeologia XXXVIII, Part 1 (1860), pp. 98-127, at p. 100 (Hathi Trust). Nichols amends Strype's chronology. Following Seymour's execution in March Cheke retreated to Cambridge for a time, tending his library and readjusting his circumstances, aware that he had come near to losing his position (as his letter to Peter Osborne indicates).Nichols, 'Some Additions to the biographies of Sir John Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith', p. 101. Other royal preceptors, Sir Anthony Cooke or Dr. Cox, maintained the young King's instruction.Nichols, Memoir of the Life of King Edward the Sixth, pp. xlix-xl.Caelius Curio in his 1555 Epistola Nuncupatoria to Cheke's De Pronuntiatione Graecae, addressing Sir Anthony Cooke, wrote: \"Vobis enim duobus Regis Eduardi pueritia, literis, moribus, religione instituenda tradita et commissa erat. Vos communibus votis, consilijs, industria, summae ac planae divinae spei Regem formabatis.\" (at sect. a 4). In the Epistle to his Arte of Logique (published 1551), Thomas Wilson speaks of Cheke and Cooke as \"your Maiesties teachers and Scholemaisters in all good litterature\".'Epistle... To the most excellent Prince', etc., The Rule of Reason, conteinyng the Arte of Logique, set forth in Englishe, by Thomas VVilson (Imprinted at London: By Richard Grafton, printer to the Kynges Maiestie, An.

The antiquary Francis Blomefield dates to 1550 Cheke's receipt of a 21-year lease of the manor and rectory of Rushworth, Norfolk (a former collegiate estate established by the Gonville family'Colleges: Rushworth', in W. Page (ed.), A History of the County of Norfolk, Vol. 2 (V.C.H., London 1906), pp. 458-60 (British History online, accessed 3 July 2017).), which he re-leased to his brother-in-law George Alyngton of Stoke-by-Clare.F. Blomefield, 'Hundred of Giltcross: Rushworth', in An Essay Towards A Topographical History of the County of Norfolk, Vol. 1 (London, 1805), pp. 284-293, at pp. 289-90. === Religious reform: friends and rewards === Part of King's College as it appeared in 1690. In discharge of their Commission, in May\u2013July 1549 the Bishops Goodrich of Ely and Ridley of Rochester, Sir William Paget and Sir Thomas Smith, John Cheke and two others conducted the King's Visitation of the University of Cambridge to investigate and amend statutes tending towards ignorance and Romish superstition.Strype, Life of the learned Sir Thomas Smith, p. 37. William Bill was now Master of St John's and Vice-Chancellor. On 6 May Cheke delivered the King's statute before the University Senate. Colleges were visited, complaints were heard, investigated and acted upon; two disputations (20 and 25 June) were held in the Philosophy Schools upon the question of the Real Presence in the Sacrament. Their business concluded, the congress broke up on 8 July.J. Lamb, A Collection of Letters, Statutes and Other Documents Illustrative of the History of the University of Cambridge (John W. Parker, London 1838), pp. 109-20. In that year Cheke published his lasting work The Hurt of Sedition, in the aftermath of the suppression of Kett's rebellion.John Cheke, The hurt of sedicion howe greueous it is to a commune welth, (London: Iohn Daye and Wylliam Seres, 1549, ESTC S107791. This made plain his full commitment to the Edwardian reform and its authority. He was chosen one of 8 divines, among 32 Commissioners, to draw up a reform of laws for the governance of the Church. The Latin form of their report, which Cheke prepared with Walter Haddon, remained long unpublished. He returned to London, giving evidence at the examination of Bishop Bonner in September 1549,Strype, Life of the learned Sir Thomas Smith, pp. 37-41. and sitting in the Parliamentary third session, towards the close of which he was granted property in Lincolnshire and Suffolk worth \u00a3118 a year for his care in the King's instruction.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, III: 1549\u20131551 (HMSO 1925), p. 113. In April 1550, following Somerset's fall, Cheke was given licence to keep 50 retainers.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, III: 1549\u20131551 (HMSO 1925), p. 327. In May he acquired the manor and town of Dunton Wayletts in Essex, and the manors of Preston and Hoo in Sussex, from John Poynet.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, III: 1549\u20131551 (HMSO 1925), p. 187. He obtained for Roger Ascham the role of Secretary to Sir Richard Morison's Embassy to Emperor Charles V.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 48-53. Archbishop Cranmer Archbishop Cranmer reputedly told Cheke that he might be glad all the days of his life to have such a scholar as the Prince, \"for he hathe more divinitie in his litle fynger, then all we have in al our bodies.\"John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments online, 1563 edition, Book IV, p. 941. Cheke meanwhile prepared a Latin version of the first Book of Common Prayer, the form in which Peter Martyr read it when consulted over its review by Cranmer. Peter Martyr doubted if the bishops would approve it, but Cheke foreknew the King's determination to implement it. In October 1550 his friend Martin Bucer, Cambridge Regius Professor of Divinity (who was indebted to Cheke for some favour offered by the King towards his countryman Johann Sleidan), presented him with the draft manuscript of his De Regno Christi (which remained unpublished until 1557).Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 54-56.M. Bucer, De Regno Christi Iesu Seruatoris Nostri, libri II. Ad Eduardum VI Angliae Regem, annis abhinc sex scripti (per Ioannem Oporinum, Basileae 1557). With Sir Thomas Smith, William Cecil, Sir Anthony Wingfield, Sir Thomas Wroth and Sir Ralph Sadler, Cheke gave evidence at the interrogation and deprivation of Stephen Gardiner in January 1551.John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments online, 1563 edition, Book IV, at pp. 863-64. At that time he was appointed to a weighty Commission to inquire into, amend and punish heresies, renewed in the following year.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, III: 1549\u20131551 (HMSO 1925), p. 347; IV: 1550\u20131553 (HMSO 1926), p. 355. Martin Bucer died in February. In May 1551 Cheke's annuity was cancelled, and in its place he received an enhanced grant of Stoke-by-Clare with its former lands and dependencies in Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Huntingdon, etc, with other properties, worth \u00a3192 per annum, for his industry in teaching the King.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, IV: 1550\u20131553 (HMSO 1926), pp. 182-83. He was serving as Commissioner for relief in Cambridgeshire,Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, V: 1547\u20131553 (HMSO 1926), p. 351. and, having conducted a Visitation of Eton in September, he and his brother-in-law Cecil (now a Secretary of State and chancellor of the Order of the Garter) on 11 October received knighthoods,Nichols (ed.), The Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 10 & note p. 322. the day upon which the Earl of Warwick was created Duke of Northumberland, and others of the nobility were advanced. Martin Bucer Shortly thereafter Cheke took part in two important private disputations upon the Real Presence, one at Cecil's house and the second at Sir Richard Morison's, held as a preparation for the review of the Prayer Book to be conducted in 1552. Among the auditors were Sir Thomas Wroth, Sir Anthony Cooke, Lord Russell and Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and the debate lay between Cheke, Cecil, Edmund Grindal and others, against the presence, and John Feckenham, Dr Yong and others upholding it. The matter of the debates was printed by John Strype.Strype, The Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 69-86. The Commission for examination of ecclesiastical laws, as required by Act of Parliament, was issued on 12 February.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, IV: 1550\u20131553 (HMSO 1926), p. 354. At this time Cheke, who had the books and papers of Martin Bucer, was attempting to build up the royal Library, and at the death of his friend and admirerSee Leland's appreciation of Cheke in his Encomia Illustrium Virorum, in T. Hearne (ed.), Joannis Lelandi Antiquarii De Rebus Britannicis Collectanea (Editio altera) 6 vols. (Gul et Jo. Richardson, London 1770), V, p. 148. John Leland the antiquary in April 1552 acquired his materials for the same purpose. Girolamo Cardano Having suffered a severe inflammation of the lungs in May 1552, he held a further disputation in Cambridge upon the doctrine of the Harrowing of Hell, with Christopher Carlile, before joining a royal progress. In July 1552 he was granted a special licence to shoot at certain fowl and deer with crossbow or hand- gun;Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, IV: 1550\u20131553 (HMSO 1926), pp. 260-61. in August he was created Chamberlain of the Receipt of the King's Exchequer, in the place of Anthony Wingfield, deceased, with a lifetime authority to appoint its officers (he entered office on 12 September 1552), and was also awarded the wardship and marriage of the heir of Sir Thomas Barnardiston.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, IV: 1550\u20131553 (HMSO 1926), pp. 266, 404. In mid-September he received from Archbishop Cranmer the Forty- two Articles prepared for the revision of the Prayer-Book with the instruction to discuss them with Cecil and to set them in order. Being approved by the Convocation they were published in 1553: in the same period Cheke had apparently prepared the Latin translation of Cranmer's Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of 1550, and this too was published in 1553. During 1552 he was visited in London by Girolamo Cardano, who lodged with him.Cardano was returning from Edinburgh where he had attended John Hamilton, see H. Morley, Jerome Cardan. The Life of Girolamo Cardano, of Milan, physician, 2 vols (Chapman and Hall, London 1854), II, pp. 132-34 (Internet Archive). Cheke was, like others of his time, somewhat given to judicial astrology. John Dee claimed that Cheke had declared his 'good liking' of him to William Cecil.'The Compendious Rehearsall of John Dee His Dutifull Declaracion', Chapter III, in J. Crossley (ed.), Autobiographical Tracts of Dr Dee Chetham Miscellanies (Chetham Society, 1851), p. 9. (Internet archive) At least two horoscopes of Cheke's birth exist, one by Sir Thomas White and one by Cardano. Cardano's observations on Cheke were published in his De Genituris Liber.Hieronymi Cardani In Ptolemaei Pelusiensis IIII De Astrorum Iudiciis libros commentaria: cum eiusdem De Genituris libro (Henrich Petri, Lugduni 1555). See Cardano's horoscope and commentary upon Cheke in the 1554 edition, pp. 420-22, and in the 1578 edition, pp. 619-22 of these works from the HenricPetrini printshop. (In Latin) Cheke gave him some exact dates concerning events in his life, and Cardano described him as a slender, manly figure with fine skin of good colour, well-set and sharp eyes, of noble bearing, handsome and hirsute.Nichols, 'Some Additions to the biographies of Sir John Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith', pp. 104-05. He told Cheke that in his last days he would have power, but severe dangers and anxieties: he foresaw for him both priestly and legislative powers; many short but fruitful journeys; he would be in all things professional, grave, liberal, wise and humane, a glory of the English people. === Apotheosis === Lady Jane Grey (the Streatham Portrait) Cheke was returned again for the Parliament of March 1553, and was at about that time a Clerk of the Privy Council. In May 1553 he was further rewarded for his services to the King's education both in childhood and in youth,\"servicii... tam in pubertate nostra bonis literis erudiend' et instruend', quam ab incunabilis nobis multipliciter diligenterque prestit' et impens'.\" by the grant of the manor of Clare, Suffolk and the fees of various possessions of the Honour of Clare in Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, worth \u00a3100 per annum.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, V: 1547\u20131553 (HMSO 1926), pp. 92-93. As the King's health declined and the question of succession became imminent, on 2 June 1553 Cheke was sworn as one of the principal Secretaries of State and took his place in the Privy Council. If that had been in anticipation of the resignation of Sir William Petre or Sir William Cecil, in the event neither resigned and there were for that time three Secretaries, all of whom signed the Engagement of the Council written out by Petre to certify the King's appointment of the succession,MS Petyt 47, Fols. 316, 317: J.G. Nichols (ed.), The Chronicle of Queen Jane, and of Two Years of Queen Mary, Camden Society Vol. XLVIII (1850), pp. 89-91. and the Duke of Northumberland's Letters Patent to that effect, dated 21 June 1553.Chronicle of Queen Jane, pp. 91-100. Mary I In Edward's last weeks Sir Thomas Wroth enfeoffed Cheke, and members of his own family, with his estates to the uses of his Wroth descendants, probably anticipating the danger of dispossession.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, V: 1550\u20131553 (HMSO 1926), pp. 267-68. Roger Ascham wrote from Brussels to congratulate Cheke on future hopes for the King's reign, but too late. The King died on 6 July and Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed Queen on the 10th. Cheke remained as her Secretary of State and was loyal to her to the last. The Council received a letter from Mary dated 9 July, from Kenninghall in Norfolk, stating her claim to the throne and demanding their loyalty. Sir John Cheke composed the reply of the same date, signed by the Lords of the Council, informing her of Jane's rightful succession, of the witnessed and sealed deeds declaring the late King's will, and of their duty to her.John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments online, 1570 edition, Book X, pp. 1605-06. He was present at the proclamation of Queen Mary on 19 July,British Library MS.

He bowed to the inevitable. Among the numerous arrests which followed, Sir John Cheke and the Duke of Suffolk (Queen Jane's father) were taken on 27 or 28 July 1553 and imprisoned in the Tower,Nichols (ed.), The Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 38. articles of indictment being drawn up against him two weeks later. Cranmer, also imprisoned, wrote to Cecil for news of Cheke's welfare.Strype's Memorials of Archbishop Cranmer, III, Appendix, No. CIX, pp. 700-01. Following the executions of the Duke of Northumberland and Sir John Gates on 22 August, Mary's initial response was one of clemency. Cheke was released from the Tower on 13 September 1553.Nichols (ed.), The Chronicle of Queen Jane, p. 27. He ceased to be Provost of King's College, Cambridge. His office in the Exchequer was granted to Robert Strelley in November 1553 and to Henry, Lord Stafford in February 1554.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Philip & Mary, I:1553-1554 (HMSO, London 1937), pp. 4, 193. Cheke's property was seized, but in the spring of 1554 he was granted licence to go abroad. By the time his pardon for offences before 1 October 1553 was granted, on 28 April 1554,Calendar of Patent Rolls, Philip & Mary, I:1553-1554 (HMSO, London 1937), p. 435. he had already left England. == Marian exile == The Italian humanist Caelius Secundus Curio Travelling under licence in early spring 1554, Cheke took with him Sir Thomas Wroth and Sir Anthony Cooke (who were not), going first in April to Strasbourg and thence to Basel.C.H. Garrett, The Marian Exiles: A Study in the Origins of Elizabethan Puritanism (Cambridge University Press, 1938 reprinted 2010), pp. 344-46. There he met Caelius Secundus Curio, a distinguished Italian humanist, who had sent books and a greeting to Cheke in 1547.A. Overell, Italian reform and English Reformations, c. 1535-c.1585 (Ashgate Publishing, 2008), pp. 58-9. Cheke explained to him his system of Greek pronunciation and entrusted to him the correspondence between himself and Stephen Gardiner on that subject.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 95-96. By July 1554 they were in Italy, where at Padua he gave lectures upon Demosthenes in Greek to English students, met with Sir Thomas Wylson and many others, and entertained Sir Philip Hoby.Travels and Life of Sir Thomas Hoby, pp. 116-117. Wroth, Cheke and Cooke, with their companies, joined with the Hoby party on an excursion to Mantua and Ferrara, returning to Padua in late November.Travels and Life of Sir Thomas Hoby, pp. 117-19. The following August, the Hobys' company having proceeded to Caldero beside Verona, Wroth and Cheke joined them there from Padua, avoiding a fresh outbreak of the plague, and they progressed north together through Rovereto, Innsbruck and Munich to Augsburg, where they arrived on 28 August 1555. After this the Hobys went on to Frankfurt, but Wroth and Cheke diverted to Strasbourg, and remained there,Travels and Life of Sir Thomas Hoby, pp. 120-23. Cheke being chosen public Professor of the Greek tongue.Langbaine, 'The Life of Sir Iohn Cheeke'. During 1555 his correspondence with Bishop Gardiner on the Greek pronunciation was published at Basel by Curio without his knowledge;De Pronuntiatione Graecae. but not without provocation to Bishop Gardiner, now Lord Chancellor, and to his doctrine. Cheke remained in correspondence with Sir William Cecil at this time.Strype, Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, pp. 97-98. Cheke may also have been in Emden to supervise the publication of his Latin edition of Thomas Cranmer's Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of ChristT. Cranmer, trans J. Cheke, Defensio Ver\u00e6 et Catholic\u00e6 Doctrin\u00e6 de Sacramento corporis & sanguinis Christi Seruatoris nostri, & quorundam in hac causa errorum confutatio, (Apud Gellium Ctematium, Embd\u00e6, 1557). and other Reformist publications.Johnson, 'Cheke, John', History of Parliament online. In the spring of 1556 he visited Brussels to make a rendezvous with his wife, and, under promise of safe conduct, to meet with Lord Paget and Sir John Mason, his wife's stepfather. In the return journey, between Brussels and Antwerp, he and Sir Peter Carew were seized on 15 May 1556, by order of Philip II of Spain, and returned unceremoniously to England, where they were imprisoned in the Tower. In Cheke's words, he was \"taken as it were in a whirlwind from the place he was in, and brought over sea, and never knew whither he went till he found himself in the Tower of London.\"Quoted from John Cheke's recantation, in J.P. Bernard, T. Birch, J. Lockman et al., 'Cheke (Sir John)', in A General Dictionary, Historical and Critical. A New and Accurate Translation of that of the Celebrated Mr Bayle New edition with corrections and additions (J. Bettenham, London 1736), Vol. IV, pp. 299-305, at pp. 302-03. John Poynet considered that Paget and Mason had treacherously arranged the arrest, causing them to be \"taken by the Provost Marshall, spoiled of their horses, and clapt into a cart, their legs, arms, and bodies tyed with halters to the body of the cart, and so carried to the sea-side, and from thence into the Tower of London.\"John Ponet, A shorte treatise of politike pouuer: and of the true obedience which subiectes owe to kynges and other ciuile gouernours, with an exhortacion to all true naturall Englishe men, compyled by.

Ponet's account is repeated in Holland's Her\u03c9ologia Anglica (1620), p. 54, and in Langbaine's 'The Life of Sir Iohn Cheeke'. == Imprisonment, recantation and death == Cheke, whose wife was allowed to attend him, was visited by two priests and by Dr John Feckenham, Dean of St Paul's, with whom he had formerly disputed. Cheke wrote to the Queen expressing his willingness to obey her laws.H. Ellis, Original Letters of Eminent Literary Men of the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, Camden Society XXIII (John Bowyer Nichols & Son, London 1843), p. 19 (Google). Feckenham attempted to intercede for him, but nothing less than a full recantation, in prescribed terms, was acceptable to Mary. The fates of so many, of John Bradford, Rowland Taylor, Ridley, Latimer and Cranmer stood newly before him. In early September 1556 he wrote a submission to the Queen which Her Majesty approved, though he was made to write it out again for having failed to mention King Philip: Feckenham sent him some notes on the real presence.Third Report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts (By Command, Eyre & Spottiswoode, London 1872), Appendix: Papers of Sir Henry Bedingfield, p. 239 (head and foot of 1st col.). He agreed to be received into the Church of Rome by Cardinal Pole, and, following a public oration by John Feckenham, made his public recantation on 4 October 1556.Cooper, Athenae Cantabrigienses. John Foxe continues: > \"Then after his recantation, hee was thorough the craftie handlyng of the > catholikes, allured first to dine and company with them, at length drawen > unwares to sit in place, where the pore Martyrs were brought before Boner > and other Bishops to bee condemned, the remorse whereof so mightely wrought > in his hart, that not longe after he lefte this mortal life.

In the wake of his recantation the confiscated freehold properties in the eastern counties granted to him by King Edward VI were restored to him but immediately exchanged for other freehold lands in Suffolk, Devon and Somerset providing for an annual return of almost \u00a3250. He surrendered ownership of the Manor of Barnardiston to Queen Mary on 31 May 1557.W.A. Copinger and H.B. Copinger, The manors of Suffolk; notes on their history and devolution (T.F. Unwin, London 1905) Vol. V, p. 191 (Hathi Trust), citing British Library Harley MS 606. In July 1557, living at Peter Osborne's house in Wood Street (Cheapside), he wrote to Sir Thomas Hoby thanking him for inviting his editorial comments on Hoby's translation of The Courtier (Il Cortegiano) of Baldassare Castiglione,T.

An advocate of English linguistic purism, he remarked \"our own tung shold be written cleane and pure, vnmixt and vnmangeled with borowing of other tunges...

The Joseph Nutting engraving published in Strype's Life of 1705 apparently derives from the same source as a later engraving by James Fittler, A.R.A., after a drawing by William Skelton, itself said to be based on an original picture at Ombersley Court, Worcestershire, formerly in possession of the Dowager Marchioness of Devonshire.Cooper, Athenae Cantabrigienses. The coloured version of this image showing Cheke with a long red beard is a production of Sarah, Countess of Essex of early 19th century date. == Children == * Henry Cheke (c. 1548\u20131586) married first Frances Radclyffe (sister of Edward Radclyffe), by whom he had three sons and two daughters, and second Frances daughter of Marmaduke Constable of York.
