Today, with hundreds of games rotated regularly throughout its game rooms, Star Worlds can be found in DeKalb, Illinois, having moved in 2004 when owner and manager Patrick O'Malley and partner Glenn Thomas needed more space and more customers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfpilpdE06Y Although it is predominantly a video game arcade with a couple of rooms dedicated solely to the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, it is also a small museum exhibiting a wide variety of collectibles associated with arcade game iconography, home video game consoles and 1980s pop culture in general.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALYKWhwpTw Star Worlds was inducted into the Twin Galaxies International Registry of Historic Video Game Arcades by gaming celebrity Walter Day for being one of the last remaining neighborhood arcades still in operation since the 1980s.http://www.daily- chronicle.com/2017/01/16/dekalb-video-arcade-celebrates-32-years-in- business/akm2jsm/ ==Original arcade game collection== Patrick O'Malley started the arcade as a personal collection of games in his parents' garage when he was still a teenager in Maple Park. But then he moved the games into a commercial retail space across town when he acquired the recently defunct Star Worlds chain of arcades (formerly located in Geneva, Illinois and West Chicago, Illinois) from Tom Sofranski of Gerault Amusements.http://www.daily- chronicle.com/2015/04/13/star-worlds-arcade-celebrates-30-years/apvwxsj/ These first 18 games included: *Q*bert *Space Invaders *Hangly-Man *Asteroids *Rapid Fire (video game) *Wizard of Wor *Sky Raiders *Depth Charge *Frogger *Space Encounters *Kangaroo *Donkey Kong *Stargate *Pengo *Le Mans *Scramble *Make Trax *Pac-Manhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnDUg6TdM9Y Star Worlds Arcade and its owners are featured in a number of documentary films, including Star Worlds: A Pocket Full of Tokens and I'm Heading to the Arcade, Man vs Snake and Go Big.http://rossispizzamonona.com/ ==References== ==External links== *Star Worlds Arcade website *Star Worlds Directions - Google Maps Category:Video arcades Category:DeKalb, Illinois Category:Museums in DeKalb County, Illinois Category:Amusement museums in the United States Category:Video game museums Category:1985 establishments in Illinois ",
