    "text": "Blood Youth are a British hardcore punk band formed in Harrogate in 2014 by ex-Climates members Sam Bowden, Matt Powels, Chris Pritchard and Max Dawson, before recruiting ex-Book of Job lead vocalist Kaya Tarsus. After releasing their debut EP, Inside My Head, in 2015 and embarking on a short, headlining tour of their native UK to support it, drummer Matt Powels departed in late 2015 to become the drum tech for Neck Deep, he was followed by Bowden, who is now playing lead guitar in Neck Deep. In March 2016, the band released their second EP, Closure, accompanied by a music video for the title track. Later that year, they announced they had begun recording their debut album, which would be titled Beyond Repair, then being released on Rude Records on 7 April 2017. ==Musical style and influence== Blood Youth performing at Download Festival 2017. Blood Youth's style has been described as melodic hardcore, hardcore punk, post-hardcore, and punk metal and compared to the likes of Stick To Your Guns, Beartooth and Every Time I Die. Blood Youth's lyrics focus on many different topics based on everyday (namely Tarsus') life, with songs off of the band's debut EP invoking themes of homelessness, breakups and financial turmoil. Their sophomore EP \"Closure\" focused on such themes as Tarsus' struggle to help his family, emotional claustrophobic towards those new in life and reflecting on the past, while their debut full-length \"Beyond Repair\" followed that of numbing oneself via alcohol abuse, the struggle of being an underground musician in a small town, becoming a different person while under the influence of alcohol, one's naivety while young and simply being angry. Furthermore, on multiple tracks such as \"What I'm Running From\" and \"Big Smoke\" Tarsus focuses on his relocation to Barcelona just-prior to the formation of the band, the reasons why he departed from England and what he was feeling during this transition. Guitarist, Chris Pritchard, is inspired by nu metal acts such as Korn and Slipknot, namely their first and second albums; even saying that he fell in love with songs such as Wait and Bleed; whereas vocalist Kaya Tarsus is more-so inspired by hardcore bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge and Every Time I Die. In full contrast, drummer Sam Hallett's favorite band is The 1975, as well as being a huge fan of R&B; together with Funeral For a Friend. ==Discography== Blood Youth performing an acoustic set at Crash Records, Leeds, England in 2017.
