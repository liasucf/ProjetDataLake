Most of the government offices and embassies are located here. It was formerly called the \"French Quarter\" (Khu ph\u1ed1 Ph\u00e1p) because of a high concentration of French-styled villas and government buildings built when Hanoi was the capital of French Indochina. This name is still used in travel literature.\"French Quarter in Hanoi to be preserved\", VietnamPlus, 18 Nov. 2010. Downs, Tom, Hanoi & Halong Bay encounter (2007), p. 66. \" \"Much of the appeal of Hanoi's French Quarter is in its colonial architecture\". The wreckage of a B-52 bomber shot down during the Vietnam War can be seen in H\u1eefu Ti\u1ec7p Lake in the Ng\u1ecdc H\u00e0 neighborhood. The southern half of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm district is also called the \"French Quarter\", also because of numerous French-styled buildings, most of which are now used as foreign embassies. == History == One of the oldest remaining structure in the neighborhood is the Temple of Literature, a Confucian sanctuary that was originally dedicated in 1070 under the L\u00fd dynasty. In 1901, the Presidential Palace was built. On September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh read the Declaration of Independence at Ba Dinh Square to approximately 500,000 people. Following his death in 1949, the preserved body of Ho Chi Minh was put on display in the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Mausoleum, located in Ba Dinh Square, in 1975. == Location == Approximation of Hanoi's Old Quarter and French Quarters It's surrounded to the north by T\u00e2y H\u1ed3, to the east by the Red River, to the south by \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a, to the southeast by Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm and to the west by C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y. == Administrative divisions == The district contains 14 wards (ph\u01b0\u1eddng) {| |valign=\"top\"| *C\u1ed1ng V\u1ecb *\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean *\u0110\u1ed9i C\u1ea5n *Gi\u1ea3ng V\u00f5 *Kim M\u00e3 *Li\u1ec5u Giai *Ng\u1ecdc H\u00e0 |width=\"50\"| |valign=\"top\"| *Ng\u1ecdc Kh\u00e1nh *Nguy\u1ec5n Trung Tr\u1ef1c *Ph\u00fac X\u00e1 *Qu\u00e1n Th\u00e1nh *Th\u00e0nh C\u00f4ng *Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch *V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac |} Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Square ==Education== International schools: * Hanoi International School * Singapore International School in the V\u1ea1n Ph\u00fac Diplomatic Compoundhttp://vanphuc.sis.edu.vn/contact-us/ ==Notable buildings== File: Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, Hanoi (4016818067).jpg|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Mausoleum File:C\u1ed5ng B\u1eafc ho\u00e0ng th\u00e0nh Th\u0103ng Long.JPG|Th\u0103ng Long Citadel File:Nha-quoc-hoi.jpg|Parliament House File:MoFA_Vietnam_0334.JPG|Ministry of Foreign Affairs building File:Lotte_Center_Hanoi_2.jpg|Lotte Center Hanoi in C\u1ed1ng V\u1ecb ward, western Ba \u0110\u00ecnh ==References== Category:Districts of Hanoi Category:Quarters ",
