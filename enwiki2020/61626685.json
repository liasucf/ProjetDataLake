    "text": "Pride Canterbury is the annual LGBTQ pride event and parade held each June in Canterbury, Kent in the United Kingdom. The next event is 13th June 2020. It was first held in 2016. It is organised by a committee led by a board of directors. == History == === 2016\u20132018 === Pride Canterbury took a similar format for the first four years. First launched on 11 June 2016, Pride Canterbury saw over 2,000 people attend. This increased when the second event took place in June 2017. The third annual event, on 9 June 2018, saw over 16,000 people attend. From 2016 to 2019, the parade started at The Marlowe Theatre, led by the Lord Mayor of Canterbury and then proceeded through the high street up to the Dane John Gardens for the Pride festival. Some events have a theme, such as the 1990s theme in 2018. Events have included: speeches from Rosie Duffield in 2017; acts included S Club, and The Vixen both in 2018, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race queens Courtney Act, and Willam In 2017. In 2018 a political row broke out over Pride Canterbury when Conservative councillor Simon Cook, leader of Canterbury City Council, said his party had \"allowed Labour to hijack the event\" in the past. In a statement, chairman Edd Withers said: \"Pride Canterbury is for everyone in the LGBTQ community, no matter who they vote for.\" === 2019 === In 2019 over 20,000 people attended Pride Canterbury held on 15 June 2019. Acts included Gok Wan, and Nadine Coyle, among others; followed by an official after-party at Glitterbomb, a local nightclub event. ==References== Category:Pride parades in England Category:Summer events in England Category:LGBT organisations in England ",
