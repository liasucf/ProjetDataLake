    "text": "Livingston (, ) is the largest town in West Lothian, Scotland. Designated in 1962, it is the fourth post-war new town to be built in Scotland. Taking its name from the village of Livingston in West Lothian, it was originally developed in the then-counties of Midlothian and West Lothian. It is situated approximately fifteen miles (25 km) west of Edinburgh and thirty miles (48 km) east of Glasgow, and is close to the towns of Broxburn to the north-east and Bathgate to the north-west. It was built around a collection of small villages, Livingston Village, Bellsquarry and Livingston Station (now part of Deans). It has a number of residential precincts or areas. These include Craigshill, Howden, Ladywell, Knightsridge, Deans, Dedridge, Murieston, Almondvale, Eliburn, Kirkton and Adambrae. There are industrial estates in Livingston, mainly Houston industrial estate, Brucefield, and Kirkton Campus. The locality of Livingston as defined by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) includes Uphall Station and Pumpherston. The wider urban settlement, also as defined by the GROS, also includes Mid Calder and East Calder. Other neighbouring villages include: Kirknewton, Polbeth and West Calder. The 2001 UK Census reported that the town had population of 50,826. The 2011 UK Census showed the population of Livingston had increased to 56,269. Livingston is the second-largest settlement in the Lothians after Edinburgh. Until 1963, the area surrounding the ancient village of Livingston was open farmland, and the ancient village is now called Livingston Village. ==History== ===Before 1962=== The area around Livingston was previously an important shale oil area, the world's first oil boom occurred in West Lothian. This was based on oil extracted from shale, and by 1870 over 3 million tons of shale were being mined each year in the area around Livingston. Output declined with the discovery of liquid oil reserves around the world in the early 1900s, but shale mining only finally ceased in 1962. The \"bings\" that characterise oil shale mining in West Lothian have largely been flattened. Two shale bings nearby are scheduled monuments - Five Sisters and Greendykes, Broxburn In 1898 Livingston had several houses, a Church of Scotland church, a United Free church and a school. Around 1 mile north of Livingston there was a railway station in a settlement called Livingston Station which is now part of Deans. The old part of Livingston is now called Livingston Village. ===New Town=== New Town architecture in Deans Livingston was built as part of the New Towns Act of 1946, in part to ease overcrowding in Glasgow. Livingston was the fourth new town of five. The others were East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld and Irvine. Livingston was designated as a New Town on 16 April 1962. The first people moved into Livingston in April 1966. Three villages (Livingston Village and Livingston Station in the old parish of Livingston and Bellsquarry in the parish of Mid Calder) and numerous farmsteads remain islands of old buildings within the new developments. In 1984 Livingston gained its first railway station on the Shotts Line called Livingston South which was followed by Livingston North on the Edinburgh to Bathgate Line in 1986. These stations replaced the former Livingston and Newpark stations which had closed before the construction of the town. In 1995 Livingston gained its professional football team, Livingston F.C. which was essentially the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle F.C. from Edinburgh. ===Livingston Development Corporation=== Logo of Livingston Development Corporation In order to build, manage and promote Livingston a quango organisation was formed, the Livingston Development Corporation. Sir David Lowe a local large scale farmer and businessman was appointed chairman. The first tenants to be housed by 1964. The corporation guided Livingston until its mandate expired on 22 March 1997 and the town was transferred to West Lothian Council. The last major construction operation carried out by the LDC was the Almondvale Stadium. Construction in Livingston has continued under the management of West Lothian Council. == Geography == Livingston is the 8th largest settlement and the 3rd largest town in Scotland, it is also the 171st largest settlement in the United Kingdom. It lies 30 miles away from Glasgow and 15 miles from Edinburgh. It has the River Almond flowing through the town centre which is what the old Almondvale Centre was named after. == Districts == The districts which make up Livingston include: Eliburn Reservoir *Craigshill *Howden *Ladywell *Knightsridge *Deans *Dedridge *Murieston *Almondvale *Eliburn *Kirkton (including Livingston Village) *Adambrae *Bellsquarry == Employment == Tesco's Distribution Centre for Scotland and Northern Ireland between Livingston and Bathgate The area where Livingston now sits was historically dominated by oil shale mining, which is evident from the bings which still exist on much of the surrounding landscape. The designation of Livingston in the 1960s attracted new light industries to the area, with high technology and pharmaceutical companies moving into the town. Livingston formed a major hub in Scotland's Silicon Glen. Like most other areas this went into a slow decline with the closures of companies including Motorola and NEC. Several multi-national companies still have factories in the town. Sky UK is the largest private sector employer in West Lothian with a range of offices and contact centres. Other large employers include those in the retail sector and in the health care sector the National Health Service, Q Squared Solutions and Quintiles IMS.

It is bounded by a ring road and has been purposely planned, distinguishing it from West Lothian's other town centres. Howden Park is located immediately north of the town centre. Livingston is the sub-regional centre serving West Lothian. It features one of the largest indoor shopping and leisure complexes in Scotland, The centre (formerly Almondvale Shopping Centre) and the Livingston Designer Outlet (formerly McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Centre). The centre was completed in its current guise on 16 October 2008. The total development has around 155 shops and eating establishments. The centre has a winter garden, an outdoor restaurant area, and several famous shopping names. The designer outlet mall, Livingston Designer Outlet, contains a VUE multiplex cinema, a food court with many chain fast-food outlets, bars, restaurants and caf\u00e9s, as well as around 100 popular outlet stores. Livingston town centre has an abundance of car parking. The south western edge of the town centre is dominated by retail parks. These contain a number of well-known retailers such as Pets at Home, PC World & Currys as well as fast-food outlets including: KFC and Frankie & Benny's. Until 2016, there was also a large B&Q; in the south- west of the town centre, as well as a large Morrisons supermarket; which remains open. The Homebase store closed in July 2010 and Argos moved to premises across the road. The former Homebase and Argos stores were converted into a large Sainsbury's supermarket that opened in December 2010. Also in the town centre, are discount supermarkets such as Aldi, and a Lidl which is located beside the Almondvale Stadium. Livingston's town centre also contains a large number of offices. Private sector offices are also concentrated at the eastern and western edges of the centre and along the Almondvale Boulevard. Other facilities in the centre include: hotels, a swimming pool and local authority gym, restaurants, pubs and a club called EQHQ (formerly Club Earth). Almondvale Football Stadium and West Lothian College are located at the north western edge of the town centre.. The Livingston Civic Centre was completed in June 2009 and officially opened by then-First Minister Alex Salmond on 25 November 2009. The Civic Centre is located just north of The centre on the bank of the River Almond. It was home to the divisional headquarters of Lothian and Borders Police until the creation of Police Scotland in 2013, as well as the sheriff and justice of the peace, West Lothian Council, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration, Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Service and the West Lothian Community Health and Care Partnership. Sculpture, Livingston Square Neighbourhood Shopping Centres are located at strategic points around the town. The first of these to be built was The Mall at Craigshill. This was followed by the Carmondean Centre in Deans and groupings of shops in Ladywell and Murieston.. There was formerly a bus station located just outside the designer outlet centre, but was shut down some years ago due to being in a run-down state. == Shopping centres == Livingston has three major shopping centres, and another three medium large retail parks and a cluster of small local stores located throughout the different areas. The first phase of the Livingston's shopping centres was completed in 1976 to facilitate the needs of the local residents and workers at The centre; known as the \"Livingston Centre\" at that point. The first major refurbishment was completed in 1988 by Land Securities. The centre was extended by in 1996, creating phase 2 of the already very successful development, bringing the size of the centre to over . It was then renamed \"The Almondvale Centre\" In early 1999, construction started on phase 3 of the development with the construction of McArthur Glen Designer Outlet Centre, (now renamed to Livingston Designer Outlet in 2007) and was opened in October 2000, with other work continuing into 2001. This development opened up over eighty new shops, twenty bars and restaurants, a fitness suite, 4,000 new car parking spaces and an eight-screen Vue Cinemas cinema complex. In early 2007, another fifteen shops were constructed within the centre replacing the \"At home\" area. Many businesses within this unit never re-opened in a new single unit. During this time, Asda constructed a new supercentre at the other end of the shopping centre in place of the old Woolco store (which had also been used as a Gateway hypermarket before Asda acquired the firm in late-1989). This Asda supercentre is one of the largest Asda stores in Scotland, along with the Edinburgh and Bridge of Dee, Aberdeen supercentres. Phase 4 of the development started in March 2007 which saw the old Safeway, (which had ceased trading since Morrisons built their new store in October 2005) demolished along with its car park. The car park between Almondvale Shopping Centre and the Designer Outlet was also removed. In its place, the new development was constructed until it opened in October 2008. Phase 4 was originally intended to be called 'The Elements', however Land Securities changed the name of it and the older centre to 'the centre' in time for the new centre being completed in October 2008. The centre contains 35 shop units, with Marks & Spencer and Debenhams as anchor stores. Within this development, there will be social areas, bars, restaurants and a Winter Garden, bringing the Almondvale Centre Development to over a million sq. ft. The old Safeway car park has been developed into a three-storey car park providing another free 1,500 spaces, with a state-of-the-art security system. == Shops == Livingston now has over 250 different retail units within Almondvale, including Debenhams, Next, Marks & Spencer, H&M;, River Island, Waterstones, Asda Supercentre, Chiquito, Wetherspoons, ASK, Wagamama, McDonald's, Game, HMV, Argos, Wilkos, Yankee Candle, Poundland, Burger King, Subway, Greggs, B&M;, Icelandand Pizza Hut.

Livingston is also home to; two competitive swimming clubs, the Livingston & District Dolphins and the Aquanauts of Livingston; Livingston and West Lothian Hockey Club, which has several men's and women's teams and provides junior coaching; West Lothian Wolves Basketball Club, with men and women's teams at all age groups and two track and field athletics clubs Livingston & District AAC, and Lothian RC.

They have some notable former players: Scott Arfield, Chris Innes, Derek Fleming and Gary Wales. ====Livingston FC==== Livingston F.C., known to locals as \"Livi\" or \"The Lions\", are the most notable football team in the town. They were formed in 1995 on the relocation of Edinburgh-based side Meadowbank Thistle. The stadium opened in November 1995, but the Livingston name had already been adopted some months earlier when the club was still playing at its former home Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh. Although they were playing in the Scottish Third Division in their first season in Livingston, six years later the club was promoted to the Scottish Premier League, finished third in their first season and qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Almondvale Stadium's East Stand - right section. Relegation to the Scottish First Division in 2006 came after the club entered administration in 2004 as well as other financial problems. In 2009 they narrowly avoided going out of business and as a result were placed back in the Third Division. The Lions managed to gain promotion to the Scottish Second Division the following year, and returned to the First Division after back to back league championships, on 6 August 2011. They currently compete in the top tier of Scottish Football (Ladbrokes Premiership) ====Livingston Cricket Club==== Livingston also has a cricket club known as the Kingfishers which fields teams for juniors and seniors and has fielded professional paid players. The club plays in the East of Scotland Cricket Association and is based in Murieston. Livingston Cricket Club was founded in 1981 by Dr Salem Patel and Doug Druce, playing its first match in August of that year in Armadale. The club joined the East League for the 1982 season, winning Grade D and promotion. In 1983 the club came second to Kirkcaldy's 2nd XI in Grade C which was enough to win election to Division 4 following league reconstruction. Home games that season were played at Bankton Mains in Murieston. The changing facilities were a wooden Wimpey hut which was eventually flame-grilled by Burger King at the second attempt. With no changing facilities for 1984 all matches had to be played away from home while renovations took place at Bangour Hospital sports field to enable cricket to be played there for the first time since the 1950s. The club remained at Bangour from 1985 to the end of the 1998 season. By 1985 the increasing number of players enabled the club to start a 2nd XI which joined Grade D of the East League. The 1st XI remained in Division 4 until winning the league in 1992. In 1994 sponsorship by the Livingston Development Corporation enabled the club to successfully negotiate the big step up to Division 2 where half of the clubs employed paid professional players. West Indian Mark Harper became the club's first paid player and regularly set new batting records throughout the season. The creation of the National leagues in 1996 and the subsequent re- organisation of feeder leagues saw Livingston become a Division 1 club due to reconstruction of the East League. In 1999 we finished third, our highest league position to date. This coincided with a move back into Livingston to a large new ground in the Murieston area. Temporary pavilion facilities and the recent run of wet summers added to the fact that the ground is over 500 ft above sea level mean that Dresselrigg has yet to realise its full potential. Being almost in the foothills of the Pentlands, rainfall is heavier and the growing season considerably shorter than most of the other grounds in the Central Belt which causes major problems in getting the ground ready for play in April. From May 2002 to August 2004 a concerted effort was made to source funding and construct a permanent pavilion. The Gerry Toms Pavilion was officially opened on 22 August 2004. ==Religion== ===Christianity=== Uniquely in Scotland, Livingston was from its formation designated an \"Ecumenical Parish\" in a joint initiative by the Church of Scotland, Scottish Episcopal Church, Methodist Church in Great Britain and the Congregational Union of Scotland (which subsequently united with the United Reformed Church). The Ecumenical Parish has six places of worship. Apart from the Ecumenical Parish, Livingston Old Parish is a congregation solely within the Church of Scotland. There are also churches of other denominations, notably the Catholic Church, the Baptist Church (who have two congregations in Dedridge and Ladywell), Jehovah's Witnesses (who have two congregations: Livingston Deans and Livingston Dedridge) and the Free Church. The Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints has a branch in Deans. In Livingston there are three Catholic Churches. Saint Peters, in Carmondean, Saint Andrews in Craigshill, and St Philips in Dedridge. ===Other religions=== There is a mosque in the Craigshill area of the town called Livingston Mosque and Community Centre and also another within the Deans area. In recent years Jehovah Witnesses have built a Kingdom Hall in Eliburn. ==Notable people from Livingston== *Nina Nesbitt, singer songwriter. *Scott Arfield, football player for Rangers F.C. *Craig Benson Olympic swimmer and World junior men's breaststroke champion, born and educated in Livingston. *Mark Burchill footballer, Educated in Livingston. *Elise Christie short track skater, competed at 2010 Winter Olympics and 2014 Winter Olympics. *David Cicero singer/keyboardist and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Pet Shop Boys moved to Livingston as a child. *Ian Colquhoun author, born and educated in Livingston. *Robin Cook former MP for Livingston, died in 2005. *Paul Dickov former Arsenal player, former manager Doncaster Rovers from 2013\u201315. *James Penrice, professional footballer for Partick Thistle. *Paul di Resta DTM driver and Formula One Driver from 2010 to 2013. *David Robertson footballer, St Johnstone F.C. *Jimmy Scoular former Portsmouth FC and Newcastle Utd football player and Cardiff City manager. *Gary Wales former Hearts player, and Kilmarnock. *Tommy Walker former Hearts and Chelsea player and the most successful Hearts manager. *Keith Watson footballer, previously of Dundee United, Hibs and St Mirren, currently plays for Hartlepool United *Danny Wilson footballer, recently played for Rangers, Liverpool and a former Hearts captain *Peter Wright World Darts Champion 2020 ==Town twinnings== Livingston is twinned with: * Hochsauerlandkreis, Germany. * Grapevine, Texas, USA. == References == === Primary sources === *Wills, E (1996) Livingston: the Making of a Scottish New Town *Cowling, D (1997) An Essay for Today: the Scottish New Towns 1947-1997 https://web.archive.org/web/20130605203544/http://www.westlothian.gov.uk/media/downloaddoc/1799479/Applying_for_a_House/Housingapplication2011 == External links == * *West Lothian Business Portal *Livingstoni Community site for Livingston *West Lothian Archaeological Trust Category:Retailing in Scotland Category:Towns in West Lothian Category:New towns in Scotland Category:1960s establishments in Scotland Category:Large burghs Category:New towns started in the 1960s ",
