    "text": "Torvalla Virgin Forest Nature Reserve () is a nature reserve in J\u00e4mtland County in Sweden. The nature reserve serves to protect an old-growth forest and a rich fen. The ancient forest is dominated by spruce and Scots pine, with birch, rowan and aspen growing in glades. The great amount of coarse woody debris creates good habitats for many species of fungi, such as Phellinidium ferrugineofuscum, Phlebia mellea and Fomitopsis rosea. The nature reserve also serves as a refuge for birds like black woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. In the rich fen, orchids like fragrant orchid, Dactylorhiza maculata ssp. fuchsii and Listera cordata grow. ==References== Category:Nature reserves in Sweden Category:Tourist attractions in J\u00e4mtland County Category:Geography of J\u00e4mtland County Category:Protected areas established in 1971 Category:1971 establishments in Sweden Category:Old-growth forests ",
