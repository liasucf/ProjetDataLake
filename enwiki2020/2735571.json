In April 2019, the campus was sold to The Independent Institute of Education (The IIE), a leader in the higher education sphere, and is no longer called or affiliated with Monash University. The IIE is internationally recognised by the British Accreditation Council. IIE MSA, formerly Monash South Africa, was founded in 2001 by Monash University. Monash South Africa (MSA) was a branch campus of the Australian Monash University. It was founded in 2001 and was located on a 100 hectare site in Ruimsig, north-west of Johannesburg, in the province of Gauteng. At its height, Monash South Africa had over 4000 students with a mix from 50 African countries. As Monash South Africa was sold to The Independent Institute of Education a subsidiary of ADvTECH Group. It is now called the IIE MSA and is still offering degrees and diplomas, and is even adding more qualifications to their range. == History == Beginning in the 1990s, Monash University in Melbourne, Australia began an extensive internationalisation program. Vice-Chancellor at the time, David Robinson, aspired for Monash to have campuses on every continent.[2] The University's Malaysia Campus was the first of these, with plans for an African offering developing in the late 1990s. In 2001, it became the first international university to gain registration to operate in South Africa.[3] The plan was initially opposed by some of the staff at Monash's Australian campuses, who were concerned that millions of dollars was being poured into overseas ventures, while staff were being made redundant in Australia.[2] The campus expanded rapidly since its establishment in 2001. In its first intake, Monash South Africa (MSA) took on just over 100 students. By 2008, there were over 2,200 students, and the operations are expanded to keep up with a demand for places which is increasing by 35% per year. A new library and learning commons were opened in 2007. By 2012 a fully modernised sports precinct was built, which played host to the eventual Gauteng state champion Monash South Africa female basketball team, coached by Tomas Sanchez and Matthew Falvey. Financial issues were unresolved and in August 2013, Monash South Africa was effectively 'sold' to Laureate International Universities who purchased its freehold land and buildings and took over running the university. Monash in Australia has come under pressure from the Auditor-general in the state of Victoria (in which Monash is located) to reduce its spending on overseas operations.[4]. A AU$150 million grant from the International Finance Corporation was part of the deal, awarded to strengthen higher education in Africa[5]. Monash in Australia continues to assure academic standards, but Laureate Education has now become the majority partner. The institution has developed some research capacity, with research nodes in water, injury prevention and global movements. Its research output (various projects and scholarly publications) is increasing, with the ambition of becoming one of the most research- intensive sites in Africa.[6] In April 2019, ADvTECH acquired Monash South Africa from Monash and Laureate. Monash South Africa is now known as IIE MSA, and a leading brand of The Independent Institute of Education (The IIE), the higher education subsidiary of ADvTECH. The IIE is South Africa's largest and the most accredited private higher education institution which operates across 21 sites and is internationally recognised by the British Accreditation Council. == Faculties and Courses == ===Schools=== Monash South Africa no longer accepts students into degrees and diplomas the IIE MSA which bought Monash SA continued the offering which falls in the following : ==== Faculty of Business, Engineering and Technology ==== The faculty offers a range of exciting undergraduate programmes, Honours programmes, postgraduate diplomas and master's degrees.
