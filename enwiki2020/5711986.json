It lies from the neighboring city of Kosi Kalan and from Tahashil Chhata. == History == Brahma Vimohan Leela took place during Krishna's time. Bewildered by the simplicity of Krishna as a child, Brahma stole Krishna's calves and cowherds. Realizing this, Krishna expanded into the same number of calves and cowherds and life remained undisturbed in Braj. Brahma realized his mistake and did penance at the Brahma Jhaadi (Chaumuha) and apologized to Krishna there. He did so after bathing in the nearby Chandra Sarovar (which was partly restored by the Braj Foundation). Because of this pastime the village was named Chaumuha, indicating four heads of Brahma. Only two temples of Brahma Ji exist; one in Pushkar (Ajmer) and the other in Chaumuha. ==Demographics== As of the 2012 Indian census, the town had a population of 9,881 of which 54% were male and 46% female. Literacy is higher than the national average at close to 95% for men and 70% for women, and 45% per cent of the population is under age six. ==Religion== === Facilities === * Brahma Ji Mandir dedicated to Lord Brahma and mela organizes every year on the first day of Shradd.

Lord Brahma was amazed at the act especially since Krishna was known to be an incarnation of Vishnu and drinking from a mortal's used cup was unacceptable behavior from a God. Lord Brahma then grew suspicious and to test him he made all cows and cowherd friends of Krishna disappear. Krishna at once understood this divine game and extended himself to take the form of all his missing cows and cowherd friends to replace them so that their absence would go unnoticed. Brahma realized his mistake and asked forgiveness through penance that he did at the site that became Chandrasarovar. Lord Brahma brought the Moon God (Chandra) with him who built Chandrasarovar. In its clean and pure waters Brahma bathed before beginning his penance. ==Administrative regions== Chaumuhan is divided into blocks known as thok (Blocks or wards) *Mani: The largest block and the location of Gopal ji mandir and Gram Block Chaumuhan. *Thamu: Bihari Ji Mandir, Thamu is the second largest block. *Jujhar: *Daud: *Marruf: *Brahm Nagar Calony: * Bajar: ==Resources== Although Chaumuhan has little industrial development, it is becoming a higher education hub as private institutes open there. === Higher education === *G.L.A.
