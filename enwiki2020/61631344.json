Speaking about her reaction to the popularization of \"Death Bed\", Beabadoobee said, \"I'm not going to lie, it was overwhelming\u2026 I kinda hated it. I hated more people knowing about the first song I'd ever written and not my others. I was so stubborn but I grew into it and accepted that's just how life works. I was extremely grateful for its existence and it's only given me more opportunities.\" Beabadoobee announced her debut studio album, Fake It Flowers, and released its lead single \"Care\" on 14 July 2020. In early August 2020, she released the album's second single, \"Sorry\", and revealed the album's track listing, cover art and official release date (16 October 2020).
