    "text": "Labor of Love is an American dating game show that premiered on Fox on May 21, 2020. The show is hosted by Sex and the City actress Kristin Davis and stars former The Bachelor season 11 contestant Kristy Katzmann. Over eight episodes, 15 men will participate in challenges and dates that test their parenting and personal skills. Those whom Katzmann finds satisfactory will advance to the following episode, and at the end of the series, she will decide with the help of Davis whether to choose one of the men to start a family with or not. The show began production in mid-2017. The show has sparked some backlash online and has been described by some critics as \"bizarre\" and \"dangerous in gamifying and making a competition out of the creation of life.\" ==Contestants== The cast consists of 15 eligible men. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; \" |- ! rowspan=2 | Contestant ! rowspan=2 | Age ! rowspan=2 | Hometown ! rowspan=2 | Occupation ! colspan=\"9\" | Episodes |- ! textalign=centre | 1 !2 !3 !4 !5 !6 !7 !8 |- !
