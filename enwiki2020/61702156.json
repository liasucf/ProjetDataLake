Retrieved on 05 September 2019. ==Biography== Geir was the son of J\u00f3n J\u00f3nsson a priest in Lauf\u00e1s, and Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir. He graduated from the University of Copenhagen in 1789 and became a cathedral priest in Reykjav\u00edk and lived in Lambasta\u00f0ir at Seltjarnarnes. He was elected Bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt after the death of Hannes Finnsson in 1796. He was consecrated by the Bishop of H\u00f3lar Sigur\u00f0ur Stef\u00e1nsson on July 30, 1797. He did, however, remain at Lambasta\u00f0ir, planning to relocate the diocese to Reykjav\u00edk. After the death of Stef\u00e1nsson, no new successor was appointed to H\u00f3lar and the two Icelandic dioceses were amalgamated into the united Diocese of Reykjavik in November 1801, with Geir V\u00eddal\u00edn as the first bishop. Geir's wife was Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Halld\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir who died in 1846. ==References== Category:Lutheran bishops of Iceland Category:1761 births Category:1823 deaths Category:19th-century Lutheran bishops ",
