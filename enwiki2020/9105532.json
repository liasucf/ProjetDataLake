The wine produced here was classified as one of eighteen Cinqui\u00e8mes Crus (Fifth Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855.Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible Workman Publishing 2001 p. 885 Ch\u00e2teau Clerc Milon is located in the northern part of the Pauillac appellation, with its vinery building in the village of Mousset, and faces Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild on the other side of the D2 road. ==History== The name of the estate is derived from its former owner Jean-Baptiste Clerc, who owned it at the time of the 1855 classification, and the village of Milon, which also has lent its name to Ch\u00e2teau Duhart-Milon.The Wine Doctor: Ch\u00e2teau Clerc-Milon, accessed 2012-09-09 One Jacques Mondon had come into possession of some vineyards that had previously been part of the Clerc-Milon estate, and after Clerc's death in 1863, he mounted a successful legal challenge to be allowed to use the Clerc- Milon name for his vineyards, which became the origin of the current-day Ch\u00e2teau Clerc Milon. Mondon subsequently adopted the name Clerc-Milon-Mondon for his estate. In 1970, Ch\u00e2teau Clerc-Milon-Mondon was purchased by Philippe de Rothschild, the owner of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild, for a sum of 1 million francs.BPDR: Ch\u00e2teau Clerc Milon: History , accessed 2012-09-06 At this time, the property was in poor shape and consisted of of vineyards.
