The mall is owned by Macerich and was developed by Westcor a former subsidiary of Macerich. The current anchors are Dillard's, Macy's and Harkins Theatres. The mall is located on Chandler Boulevard at the northwest corner of Price Road and Loop 202 (the SanTan Freeway). Sales at Chandler Fashion Center are more than $600 per square foot, which is well above the national average of $392 per square foot. ==Layout== Chandler Fashion Center is unique among most indoor shopping centers in its design. The mall layout is designed like the letter \"A\" with the food court as the top point. All of the indoor mall shops radiate out into 3 wings from the food court. The mall features stone columns, marble floors and large skylights all incorporated in a modern, yet contemporary design. The mall is also a showcase of Arizona scenery courtesy of Arizona Highways. Large photographic murals of the Grand Canyon, Sedona and Arizona's Sonoran Desert are displayed on walls at the ends of each wing as well as certain outdoor entrances to the mall. Adjacent to the food court entrance of the mall is an outdoor entertainment and dining plaza called The Village. The entertainment and dining options at The Village include the Harkins Theatres, Escape the Room, The Old Spaghetti Factory, Buffalo Wild Wings, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, California Pizza Kitchen, PLAYlive Nation, and a Starbucks. A popular attraction of the outdoor plaza used to be the Dancing Waters fountain featuring a display of water, lights and music. The fountains were later demolished in the Summer of 2014 and renovated into a picnic area that featured patio seating, lawn areas, and a children's splash pad. Surrounding the mall there are many large retail centers including Chandler Festival, Chandler Gateway, Chandler Village Center and the Boulevard Shops. == History == Nordstrom WingThe mall opened on October 19, 2001 with 229 stores and five anchors (Arizona's second Nordstrom, Sears, Dillard's, Robinsons-May and Harkins Theatres).
