He was five years old when he started playing the piano and studied jazz in Budapest at the B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k Musical Training College from 1976 to 1979. ==Later life and career== From the early 1980s Binder led quartets and quintets that appeared at festivals in Europe. He performed and recorded with the free-jazz musician Gy\u00f6rgy Szabados in the middle of that decade and near its end played in duos with Theo J\u00f6rgensmann, Laszlo S\u0171le and others.

He is the head of the jazz department at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music in Budapest. ==Style== \"Binder's style of world music mingles elements of Japanese, lamaist, gamelan, Indian, and African music with the diatonic harmonies of classical music and the improvisational freedom of jazz.\" ==Selected discography== * (1981) K\u00e1roly Binder Quartet Live at B\u00e1tok Terem with Mih\u00e1ly Dresch, R\u00f3bert Benk\u0151 * (1982) Binder Quintet featuring John Tchicai * (1985) K\u00e1roly Binder \" In Illo Tempore \" * (1991) K\u00e1roly Binder and Ramesh Shotham Dance Music * (1993) K\u00e1roly Binder featuring Theo J\u00f6rgensmann Live at Music Academy Budapest ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Hungarian jazz pianists Category:Hungarian composers Category:Hungarian male composers Category:Living people Category:1956 births Category:Male pianists Category:21st-century pianists Category:21st-century male musicians Category:Male jazz musicians ",
