    "text": "Zamora () is a city in Castile and Le\u00f3n, Spain, the capital of the province of Zamora. It lies on a rocky hill in the northwest, near the frontier with Portugal and crossed by the Duero river, which is some downstream as it reaches the Portuguese border. With its 24 characteristic Romanesque style churches of the 12th and 13th centuries it has been called a \"museum of Romanesque art\". Zamora is the city with the most Romanesque churches in all of Europe. The most important celebration in Zamora is the Holy Week. ==History== Cathedral Castle at night Ace\u00f1as de Olivares (mills on the river Duero) Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena Church Sagasta square (modernist buildings) After the Roman victory over the Lusitanian hero Viriathus the settlement was named by the Romans Occelum Durii or Ocellodurum (literally, \"Eye of the Duero\"). During Roman rule it was in the hands of the Vaccaei, and was incorporated into the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis. It was on the road from Emerita (modern M\u00e9rida) to Asturica Augusta (modern Astorga). (Ant. Itin. pp. 434, 439). Two coins from the reign of the Visigothic king Sisebuto, show that it was known at the time as \"Semure\". During the period of Moorish rule the settlement became known by the names of \"Semurah\" or \"Azemur\". After the establishment of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias, the settlement became a strategic frontier post and was the scene of many fierce military engagements between the Muslims and Christians. Control of the town shifted between the two sides a number of times from the early 8th century to the late 10th century. During this period it became heavily fortified. Old city hall, Plaza Mayor alt= San Vicente Church The most notable historic episode in Zamora was the assassination outside the city walls of the king Sancho II of Castile in 1072. Some decades before, king Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n had divided his kingdoms between his three sons. To his daughter, Do\u00f1a Urraca, he had bequeathed the \"well fortified city of Zamora\" (or \"la bien cercada\" in Spanish). All three sons warred among themselves, till the ultimate winner, Sancho, was left victorious. Zamora, under his sister who was allied with Leonese nobles, resisted. Sancho II of Castile, assisted by El Cid, laid siege to Zamora. King Sancho II was murdered by a duplicitous noble of Zamora, Bellido Dolfos, who tricked the king into a private meeting. After the death of Sancho, Castile reverted to his deposed brother Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n. The event was commemorated by the Portillo de la Traici\u00f3n (Treason Gate). Zamora was also the scene of fierce fighting in the 15th century, during the conflict between the supporters of Isabella the Catholic and Juana la Beltraneja. The Spanish proverb, No se gan\u00f3 Zamora en una hora, literally, Zamora wasn't won in an hour, is a reference to these battles. It is the Spanish equivalent of the English proverb \"Rome wasn't built in a day.\" During the 12th century, the city was extraordinarily important for its strategic position in the wars between the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n and the Almoravids and Almohads. As a result, the city preserves many churches and buildings from that time. In the 1140s and 1150s it was ruled by Prince Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera, who has a street named after him in the city today. In the next centuries, the city lost its political and economic relevance and suffered emigration, especially to South America (where many other cities called Zamora were founded). Henry IV granted Zamora the epithet of \"most noble and most loyal city\". During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Zamora was from the start of the military rebellion a nationalist held city. The savagery of the repression against leftists and liberals is captured in Ram\u00f3n Sender Baray\u00f3n's 'A Death in Zamora', which tells of the extrajudicial murder of his mother, Amparo Barayon, the wife of the famous novelist Ramon Sender. ==Main sights== Main sights of Zamora include: Torre del Salvador San Juan de Puerta Nueva Church San Isidoro Church The Transit of the Virgin Church Episcopal PalaceThe Pe\u00f1as de Santa Marta, a rocky plateau at the side of the alt= *Cathedral, in Romanesque style, dating to the 12th century, taking only 23 years to build. * Medieval Castle of Zamora. *Palacio de los Condes de Alba y Aliste, built in 1459 by the first Count of Alva y Aliste.
