The musician Pony's return strips away illusions and excuse to reveal the meaningless dead-end existences of everyone. ==Productions== The play was originally produced at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater of the Lincoln Center Theater from April 27 through August 28, 1994, featuring Martha Plimpton (Sooze), Josh Hamilton (Jeff), Firdous Bamji (Norman), Tim Guinee (Tim), Wendy Hoopes (Bee-Bee), Zak Orth (Pony), Babette Renee Props (Erica), Samia Shoaib (Pakeesa) and Steve Zahn (Buff).
