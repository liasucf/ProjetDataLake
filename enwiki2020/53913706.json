    "text": "The first government of Adolfo Su\u00e1rez was formed on 8 July 1976 following the latter's appointment as Prime Minister of Spain by King Juan Carlos I on 3 July and his swearing-in on 5 July, as a result of Carlos Arias Navarro's resignation from the post on 1 July 1976. It succeeded the second Arias Navarro government and was the Government of Spain from 8 July 1976 to 5 July 1977, a total of days, or . Su\u00e1rez's first cabinet comprised members from the National Movement (with the notable absences of FET y de las JONS and the Opus Dei), but also by members of the reformist 'T\u00e1cito' group, a number of political associations that could not yet be legalized as parties\u2014such as the Spanish People's Union (UDPE) and the Spanish Democratic Union (UDE)\u2014and the Federation of Independent Studies (FEDISA) political society. Following the death of dictator Francisco Franco, the regulations of the Cortes Espa\u00f1olas had been amended to allow legislators to group into parliamentary factions, one of whom\u2014the Independent Parliamentary Group (GPI), which would later become the Independent Social Federation (FSI) party\u2014being represented in the Council of Ministers through Rodolfo Mart\u00edn Villa. On 7 April 1977, the National Movement and the FET y de las JONS party were officially disbanded, and many cabinet members\u2014who had gone their own separate ways to a number of political parties ahead of the 1977 general election\u2014joined into the nascent Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) electoral alliance under Su\u00e1rez's leadership upon its formation in May 1977. ==Cabinet changes== *On 23 September 1976, Fernando de Santiago was replaced as First Deputy Prime Minister by Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez Mellado. *Minister of the Navy Gabriel Pita da Veiga announced his resignation on 12 April 1977 over personal disagreements with the government's decision to legalize the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) on 9 April; he was replaced by Admiral Pascual Pery on 15 April. *On 23 April 1977, Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo resigned as Minister of Public Works in order to organize the newly-formed Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) ahead of the 1977 Spanish general election. Carlos P\u00e9rez de Bricio took on the ordinary duties of the affairs of the ministry until Calvo-Sotelo's successor, Luis Ortiz Gonz\u00e1lez, could take office on 11 May 1977. ==Council of Ministers== The Council of Ministers was structured into the offices for the prime minister, the two deputy prime ministers and 19 ministries, including one minister without portfolio. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\" |- | colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"#F2F2F2\" align=\"center\"| \u2190 Su\u00e1rez I Government \u2192 (8 July 1976 \u2013 5 July 1977) |- !
