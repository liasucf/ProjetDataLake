It is the centre of the Hlu\u010d\u00edn Region. ==Administrative parts== The villages Bobrovn\u00edky (German: Bobrownik, since 1939: Biberswald) and Darkovi\u010dky (German: Kleindarkowitz) belong to the town of Hlu\u010d\u00edn. ==History== Hlu\u010d\u00edn was part of the Duchy of Opava before the latter was partitioned along the Opava River between Habsburg Austria and the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742 by the Treaty of Berlin after the First Silesian War. The town was administered within the Prussian Province of Silesia until 1920, when it was made part of Czechoslovakia following World War I. The transferral of the Hlu\u010d\u00edn Region sparked controversy between Germans, Czechs and Poles. By a biased interpretation of the law, the new Czechoslovak authorities banned schooling in German even though German- speakers constituted a majority in the town. After the Munich Agreement in 1938, Hlu\u010d\u00edn was annexed by Nazi Germany and again made part of Prussian Silesia, with its German name Hultschin restored to use. Hlu\u010d\u00edn was restored to Czechoslovakia in 1945 and German-speakers were expelled. However, different from most of the area of former Sudetenland, Hlu\u010d\u00edn's German- speakers were spared an expulsion en bloc. Today, a sizable fraction of the residents are bi-nationals having also a German citizenship.
