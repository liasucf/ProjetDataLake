Later in the early 1970s, he worked as a purchasing agent and salesman in Hong Kong and Dallas. ==Career== ===Men's Wearhouse=== Robert Elkin Zimmer started his own manufacturing company Royalad Apparel which he later expanded into Zimco Industries. In 1973, Robert Elkin Zimmer and his son, George Zimmer, co- founded The Mens Wearhouse in Houston, Texas. George Zimmer and his college roommates opened the first Men's Wearhouse store in 1973 in Houston.

On June 19, 2013, The Men's Wearhouse board dismissed Zimmer for unspecified reasons and declined to offer any explanation in its press release. The press release stated that terms of Zimmer's severance were still to be discussed with him. Though the brief press release did not cite reasons for Zimmer's termination, Zimmer himself did shed a little light on the issue to CNBC. \"Over the last 40 years, I have built MW into a multibillion-dollar company with amazing employees and loyal customers who value the products and service they receive at MW. Over the past several months I have expressed my concerns to the board about the direction the company is currently heading. Instead of fostering the kind of dialogue in the boardroom that has in part contributed to our success, the board has inappropriately chosen to silence my concerns through termination as an executive officer.\" On June 25, 2013, the company, responding to public pressure for more information following its terse original statement, released a detailed explanation of its actions. The statement asserts that Zimmer insisted on full-control of the public company. \"Neither the board nor management desired a total breakdown of the relationship between Mr. Zimmer and the company. In our discussions with Mr. Zimmer, we made considerable efforts to find a solution that would have allowed him to continue to have a significant involvement with Men's Wearhouse. Unfortunately, Mr. Zimmer wouldn't accept anything other than full control of the company and the board was left with no choice but to terminate him as Executive chairman.\" ===zTailors=== Citing the need to \"bring the age- old tradition of tailoring into the modern day,\" Zimmer founded zTailors, \"an on-demand personal tailoring service that gives everyone an opportunity to look their best with just a tap of their smartphone,\" launching publicly in June 2015.Gelles, David. \"George Zimmer Starts an 'Uber' for Tailors\" (May 31, 2015) New York Times Zimmer is the chairman and CEO of zTailors. ===Generation Tux=== Stating a belief that \"every aspect of this hallmark experience can be drastically improved,\" Zimmer founded Generation Tux, \"the ultimate high tech, high touch clothing rental experience for the next generation,\" launching publicly in September 2015.Segran, Elizabeth. \"George Zimmer Launches Online Tux-Rental Service Generation Tux\" (September 14, 2015) Fast Company Zimmer is the chairman and CEO of Generation Tux. ==Personal life== Zimmer is married to Lorri, they have four children, and live in Oakland, California. Zimmer's style of corporate management (for example, the company's June 2004 nomination of spiritual guru Deepak Chopra to its board) is peculiar in the view of some, while others perceive his style as cutting-edge.
