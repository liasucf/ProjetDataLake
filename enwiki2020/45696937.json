    "text": "Harriet Anena is a Ugandan writer and performer. Her award-winning writing include poetry, nonfiction and fiction. She is the author of a collection of poems, A Nation In Labour, published in 2015. Anena's poetry has been described as \"highly evocative and visual\". The Economist described her poetry performance as \"an arresting evocation of love and war\". In 2019, Short Story Day Africa Prize Founder Rachel Zadok said: [Anena] has an unexpected onstage persona that is only given away by the twinkle of mischief in the eye of the quiet woman one meets off-stage. A twinkle one soon learns the meaning of when she performs her work. It means humour, it means power. Anena is a feminine force of nature that takes no prisoners. Feminist. Scathing. Sensitive. Sharp. She has no blurred edges. Her prose is not like a knife, it is the blade that cuts into the patriarchy and incises its scars from the female body.\" ==Early life and education== Anena was born to Acholi parents and raised in the Gulu District of Uganda. She grew up during the two-decade war led by the Lord's Resistance Army rebels, an episode that birthed and influenced her early writing. Anena attended Gulu Public Primary School, Sacred Heart Secondary School, and Gulu Central High School. She graduated with a Bachelor of Mass Communication degree from Makerere University in 2010 and completed a Master of Arts degree in human rights from the same institution in 2018. She is pursuing the MFA Writing program at Columbia University in New York. == Journalistic work == Anena worked with the Daily Monitor newspaper as a reporter, sub-editor, and deputy chief sub-editor from 2009 to September 2014. She joined the African Centre for Media Excellence in 2014 and worked as a journalism trainer, media researcher, program coordinator and online content producer until 2019. In August 2019, Anena joined Columbia Journal as its Online Copy Editor. Her journalistic articles have been published in the Daily Monitor, New Vision, The Observer, Columbia Journal, The Atlantic and Popula. She has also taught Specialized Writing to journalism students at Islamic University in Uganda. ==Writing== Anena wrote her first poem, \"The plight of the Acholi child\", in 2003. It won a writing competition organised by the Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative and helped secure her a bursary for A-Level education. She attended the 2013 Caine Prize workshop held in Uganda, and her story \"Watchdog Games\" was published in the anthology A Memory This Size and Other Stories: The Caine Prize for African Writing, 2013. In 2013, she was shortlisted for the \"Ghana Poetry prize\" for her poem \"We Arise\". A Nation In Labour, published in 2015, is her debut book, a \"socially conscious\" collection of poems. The New Vision wrote that \"Anena and her buffet of poetry will keep you hooked.\"Caroline Ariba (27 June 2016), \"Book review: A nation is in labour\", New Vision. As described by Tomiwa Ilori, \"A Nation in Labour is a four-part treatise that uses elevated language to tell of horror. Anena\u2019s collection of poetry warns society about its warped value system through a disciplined use of satiric responses that resonate. Each part of the treatise soaks our desiccated humanity in fluid cadences.\"Tomiwa Ilori, \"Rhetoric of Pain and Other Resources\", Wawa Book Review, 27 October 2015. In November 2018, A Nation In Labour was shortlisted for the biennial Wole Soyinka Prize for Literature in Africa, alongside collections by Tanure Ojaide and Servio Gbadamosi.\"Nine African poets shortlisted for 2018 Wole Soyinka Prize for Literature\", P.M.
