    "text": "A cyberneticist or a cybernetician is a person who practices cybernetics. Heinz von Foerster once told Stuart Umpleby that Norbert Wiener preferred the term \"cybernetician\" rather than \"cyberneticist\", perhaps because Wiener was a mathematician rather than a physicist. The word \"cyberneticist\" was used by Nicolas Rashevsky who began as a theoretical physicist. Robert Rosen, who began his career as a mathematician, regarded neurocybernetics\u2014and more generally biocybernetics\u2014as fields closely allied to mathematical biology and mathematical biophysics in which control theory and dynamical system theories also play significant roles. Today \"cybernetician\" is preferred by members of the American Society for Cybernetics.CybSoc == See also == * Cybernetics * New Cybernetics * Mathematical and theoretical biology * Neurocybernetics * Biocybernetics * Systems science * Systems biology * Systems engineering ==References== == External links == * Noted contributors to cybernetics and systems theory Website by the American Society for Cybernetics. * Cybernetics and Systems Thinkers overview by the Principia Cybernetica Web.
