Model of the fl\u00e8che of Notre-Dame de Paris made for Eugene Viollet- le-Duc (1859) (Museum of Historic Monuments, Paris) A fl\u00e8che () is the name given to spires in Gothic architecture: in French the word is applied to any spire, but in English it has the technical meaning of a spirelet or spike on the rooftop of a building. In particular, the spirelets often built atop the crossings of major churches in mediaeval French Gothic architecture are called fl\u00e8ches. On the ridge of the roof on top of the crossing (the intersection of the nave and the transepts) of a church, fl\u00e8ches were typically light, delicate, timber-framed constructions with a metallic sheath of lead or copper. They are often richly decorated with architectural and sculptural embellishments: tracery, crockets, and miniature buttresses serve to adorn the fl\u00e8che. Fl\u00e8ches are often very tall: the Gothic Revival spire of Notre-Dame de Paris (18582019) by Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc was about before its destruction in the Notre-Dame de Paris fire, while the 16th century fl\u00e8che of Amiens Cathedral is high. The highest fl\u00e8che in the world was built at the end of the 19th century for Rouen Cathedral, high in total. A short spire or fl\u00e8che surrounded by a parapet is common on churches in Hertfordshire; as a result this type of fl\u00e8che is called a Hertfordshire spike. ==See also== * Fl\u00e8che fa\u00eeti\u00e8re * Ridge turret ==Notes== Category:Architectural elements Category:Church architecture ",
