    "text": "This is a list of tennis violations that have occurred by professional tennis players in tournaments. When a player violates a rule or does not follow the tennis code of conduct, the umpire or tournament official can issue one of the following: * Warnings * Losing a point * Losing a game * Disqualification ==Code of Conduct== According to the 1987 Tennis Code of Conduct, if a player assesses $7,500 in fines in a 12-month period, they will automatically be fined an additional $10,000. The third penalty would carry a fine and a four- month suspension. A sixth-month suspension would follow after that. ==Selected period violation summary== The New York Times compiled a list of fines received by gender between 1998-2018 at the four major tennis grand slam tournaments. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
