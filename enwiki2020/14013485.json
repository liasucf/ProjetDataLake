    "text": "The South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball team represents the University of South Carolina and competes in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Gamecocks won Southern Conference titles in 1927, 1933, 1934, and 1945, and then they gained national attention under hall of fame coach Frank McGuire, posting a 205\u201365 record from 1967\u20131976, which included the 1970 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship, the 1971 ACC Tournament title, and four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances from 1971\u20131974. The program also won the 1997 SEC championship, National Invitation Tournament (NIT) titles in 2005 and 2006, and a share of the 2009 SEC Eastern division title. Most recently, the Gamecocks won the 2017 NCAA East Regional Championship, reaching the Final Four for the first time in school history. Frank Martin is the current head coach, and the team plays at the 18,000-seat Colonial Life Arena. ==History== ===Southern Conference years=== South Carolina achieved a measure of regional prominence during its tenure in the Southern Conference, winning regular season championships in 1927, 1933, 1934, and 1945. The program also won the conference's tournament championship in 1933. During World War II, the basketball team's success was partially attributed to being assigned outstanding athletes by the U.S. Navy as part of the V-12 program. However, the Navy leaders kept the teams focus towards the war effort, and USC declined an invitation to the Southern Conference Tournament in 1944. ===Frank McGuire era (1965\u20131980)=== Alex English, a 1975 All-American at South Carolina, would go on to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. The hiring of Frank McGuire before the 1964\u201365 season propelled South Carolina to its most successful period to date. McGuire's 16-year tenure was highlighted by an undefeated ACC regular season in 1970, an ACC Tournament championship in 1971, and three consecutive Sweet 16 appearances from 1971 to 1973. USC also posted a 69\u201316 overall record from 1968 to 1971, and John Roche won consecutive ACC Player of the Year Awards (1969\u20131970). In November 1968, the Gamecocks began playing at the 12,401 seat Carolina Coliseum, which became known as the \"House that Frank Built.\" The success South Carolina achieved on the court brought resentment and anger from fellow ACC schools, especially those on \"Tobacco Road,\" as the conference members of the state of North Carolina were known. The hostility of the road crowds, the unfriendly behavior of coaches and athletic directors in the conference, and the discrepancies in eligibility standards led McGuire to support South Carolina becoming an Independent before the 1971\u201372 season. As an Independent, the program gradually declined, and the University sought entrance into an athletic conference. This proved problematic because most conferences required schools to have a single athletic director, and South Carolina had multiple directors at the time. McGuire served as Athletic Director for the basketball program, and he would not relinquish his position. The University made several attempts to obtain McGuire's resignation, but ultimately honored his contract through 1980. McGuire finished with a 283\u2013142 overall record at South Carolina and continues to be held in high regard by Gamecock fans. His six consecutive 20-win seasons from 1969 to 1974, which produced a 137\u201333 record, remain the benchmark for USC Basketball. ===Metro Conference and SEC=== In 1983, the University became affiliated with the Metro Conference. The basketball program was placed on probation by the NCAA in the spring of 1987 for two years because of recruiting violations and the sale of complimentary player tickets. From 1987 to 1991, George Felton led the Gamecocks to an 87\u201362 overall record, which included a 1989 NCAA Tournament appearance and a 1991 NIT berth. For three of Felton's five seasons (1987\u20131989), Tubby Smith served as an assistant coach before leaving to join Rick Pitino's staff at Kentucky. South Carolina joined the SEC before the 1992 season and initially struggled, posting a combined 20\u201335 record in 1992 and 1993. ===Eddie Fogler era (1994\u20132001)=== Eddie Fogler was hired away from Vanderbilt before the 1994 season and within a few years returned the Gamecocks to respectability. Under Fogler, South Carolina posted an impressive 66\u201328 record (34\u201314 SEC) during the 1996\u20131998 stretch, which included the school's first SEC championship in 1997. The 1997 Gamecocks posted a 15\u20131 record in SEC play and defeated league rival Kentucky twice, but lost in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament. Fogler stepped down after the 2001 campaign, going 123\u2013117 in eight seasons as the Gamecocks' head coach. His tenure included two NCAA Tournament appearances (1997, 1998) and two NIT appearances (1996, 2001). Fogler retired as one of the most successful head coaches in SEC Basketball history, having won regular season conference championships at both Vanderbilt and South Carolina. ===Dave Odom era (2002\u20132008)=== Subsequent coach Dave Odom posted four 20-win seasons during his tenure at South Carolina. He led the Gamecocks to an appearance in the 2004 NCAA Tournament and consecutive NIT championships in 2005 and 2006. Odom's tenure also saw USC begin play at the 18,000 seat Colonial Life Arena during the 2002\u20132003 season. Following the 2007\u20132008 campaign, Odom resigned with a 128\u2013104 overall record at USC. ===Darrin Horn era (2009\u20132012)=== On April 1, 2008, Darrin Horn was named the new head basketball coach at USC.Darrin Horn Named Men's Basketball Coach In his first season, Horn led the Gamecocks to a 21\u201310 record (10\u20136 SEC), two victories over Kentucky, and a share of the 2009 SEC Eastern Division title. After a 10\u201321 campaign in 2011\u201312, his third straight losing season, Horn was fired on March 13, 2012, finishing his tenure at Carolina with a 60\u201363 overall record and a 23\u201345 mark in the SEC. ===Frank Martin era (2012\u2013present)=== Frank Martin came to USC from Kansas State, where he had enjoyed five winning seasons and four NCAA Tournament appearances, including an Elite Eight appearance with the Wildcats in 2010. After losing records in his first two seasons with the Gamecocks, he achieved a winning season in 2015, then reached the NIT in 2016, and then broke through into the 2017 NCAA Tournament, the program's first appearance in the event since 2004. On March 17, 2017, USC achieved its first NCAA Tournament victory since 1973 with a 20-point win over the Marquette Golden Eagles. Two nights later, the Gamecocks upset the #2 seed Duke Blue Devils to advance to their fourth Sweet 16. South Carolina then beat #3 seed Baylor Bears to advance to their first-ever Elite 8, two days later they upset Florida to advance to their first ever Final Four. ==Year-by-Year results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Season ! rowspan=\"2\" | Coach ! colspan=\"2\" | Record ! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | style=\"width:70px; \"| Overall || style=\"width:40px; text-align:center;\"| Conference |- style=\"background:#ffd;\" | colspan=\"5\" | Independent |- | 1908\u20131909 | J.H.
