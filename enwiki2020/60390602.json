The championship also contributed to increase the popularity of the sport in the country. Nevertheless, President of Brazil, Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa, banned black players from the national team so Friedenreich could not attend the 1920 and 1921 editions in Chile and Argentina respectively.

Brazil could win its second South American title in 1922 although Friedenreich can only play two matches before being injured.El presidente racista que no aceptaba negros en su equipo, Infobae, 4 July 2011 ==References== Category:1919 South American Championship Category:Brazil national football team matches Category:Uruguay national football team matches Category:Copa Am\u00e9rica finals Category:International sports competitions in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Brazil\u2013Uruguay football rivalry Category:May 1919 sports events ",
