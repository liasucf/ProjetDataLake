    "text": "Romulus Dianu (born Romulus Dima; March 22, 1905-August 25, 1975) was a Romanian prose writer, journalist and translator. == Biography == Born in Bucharest, his parents were C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne worker Gheorghe Dima, a relative of composer Gheorghe Dima; and his wife Virgilia (n\u00e9e Maiorescu), descended from the family of Petru Maior. After attending primary school in Murfatlar and B\u00e2rlad, he enrolled in the classics section of his native city's Saint Sava National College, thanks to the help of his uncle, poet George Tutoveanu. In 1925, he entered the literature and philosophy faculty of the University of Bucharest. He made his published debut in Rampa in 1926, with opinion pieces. His first book appeared in 1929; co-written with Sergiu Dan, it was a fictionalized biography titled Via\u021ba minunat\u0103 a lui Anton Pann. Dan was his best friend, and he was also very close to Ion Vinea and Pamfil \u0218eicaru. He wrote the novels Adorata (1930) and Nop\u021bi la Ada-Kaleh (1931) in the prevailing serialized style of the day. Dianu then entered the diplomatic field, working as Nicolae Titulescu's secretary for a decade and receiving accreditation from the League of Nations. During World War II, he wrote regularly for the official press. Following the war and the onset of a Romanian Communist Party-led government, he was sent to prison for his journalistic activity. After being released, he worked as a day laborer, woodcutter and book peddler. Found by Ion Caraion selling books in a passageway, he was able to retire and secure a pension from the Romanian Writers' Union upon the latter's proposal. He wrote three novels during the last five years of his life.

I, p. 487. Pite\u0219ti: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. == Literary activity == The literature written by Romulus Dianu is highlighted by epic verve and a fast notation, \"made from the flight of the pen\". The writer presents a conventional, slightly cosmopolitan and exotic environment, showing an intellectual curiosity about the mystery of the eternal feminine.Ov. S.
