    "text": "Walddeutsche (lit. \"Forest Germans\" or Taubdeutsche - \"Deaf Germans\"; - \"deaf- mutes\") is the name for a group of people of mostly German origin, who settled between the 14th and 17th century on the territory of present-day Sanockie Pits, in southeastern Poland. The Walddeutsche peopled migrated to the Pit region which was previously only sparsely inhabited because the land was difficult to farm. == Nomenclature == The term Walddeutsche \u2013 coined by the Polish historians Marcin Bielski, 1531, Szymon Starowolski 1632, Bishop Ignacy Krasicki and Wincenty Pol \u2013 also sometimes refers to Germans living between Wis\u0142oka and the San River part of the West Carpathian Plateau and the Central Beskidian Piedmont in Poland. The Polish term G\u0142uchoniemcy is a sort of pun; it means \"deaf-mutes\", but sounds like \"forest Germans\": Niemcy, Polish for \"Germans\", is derived from niemy (\"mute\", unable to talk comprehensibly, i.e. in the Polish language), and g\u0142uchy (\"deaf\", i.e. \"unable to communicate\") sounds similar to g\u0142usz meaning \"wood\". == History == Hacz\u00f3w, one of the oldest wooden Gothic churches in Europe, 14th century, UNESCO World Heritage Site In the 14th century a German settlement called Hanshof existed in the area. The Church of the Assumption of Holy Mary and St. Michael's Archangel in Hacz\u00f3w (Poland), the oldest wooden Gothic temple in Europe, was erected in the 14th century and was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 2003. Germans settled in the territory of the Kingdom of Poland (territory of present-day Subcarpathian Voivodeship and eastern part of Lesser Poland) from the 14th to 16th centuries (see Ostsiedlung), mostly after the region returned to Polish sphere of influence in 1340, when Casimir III of Poland took the Czerwie\u0144 towns. Marcin Bielski states that Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry settled some Germans in the region to defend the borders against Hungary and Kievan Rus' but the arrivals were ill-suited to their task and turned to farming. Maciej Stryjkowski mentions German peasants near Przeworsk, Przemy\u015bl, Sanok, and Jaros\u0142aw, describing them as good farmers. Some Germans were attracted by kings seeking specialists in various trades, such as craftsmen and miners. They usually settled in newer market and mining settlements. The main settlement areas were in the vicinity of Krosno and some language islands in the Pits and the Rzesz\u00f3w regions. The settlers in the Pits region were known as Uplander Sachsen. Until approximately the 15th century, the ruling classes of most cities in present-day Beskidian Piedmont consisted almost exclusively of Germans. The village of Markowa. The typical Umgebindehaus \u2013 houses, about 150\u2013200 km southeast of Krak\u00f3w, around 18/19th century, built in the style of ancient mountain Walddeutsche atmosphere. Subcarpathian (Ma\u0142opolska) Germans in the 15th century. The Beskidian Germans underwent Polonization in the latter half of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century. According to Wac\u0142aw Maciejowski, writing in 1858, the people did not understand German but called themselves G\u0142uchoniemcy. Wincenty Pol wrote in 1869 that their attire was similar to that of the Hungarian and Transylvanian Germans and that their main occupations were farming and weaving. He stated that in some areas the people were of Swedish origin, however, they all spoke flawlessly in a Lesser Poland dialect of Polish. In 1885, J\u00f3zef Szujski wrote that the Gluchoniemcy spoke only Polish, but there were traces of a variety of original languages which showed that, when they arrived, the term Niemiec was applied to \"everyone\". In the modern Polish language, Niemiec refers to Germans, however, in earlier centuries, it was sometimes also used in reference to Hungarians, possibly due to similarity with the word niemy or plural niemi for \"mute\" or \"dumb\". ==Settlement== Important cities of this region include Pilzno, Brzostek, Biecz, Gorlice, Ropczyce, Wielopole Skrzy\u0144skie, Frysztak, Jas\u0142o, Krosno, Czudec, Rzesz\u00f3w, \u0141a\u0144cut, Tyczyn, Brzoz\u00f3w, Ja\u0107mierz, Ryman\u00f3w, Przeworsk, Jaros\u0142aw, Ka\u0144czuga, Przemy\u015bl, Dyn\u00f3w, Brzoz\u00f3w, and Sanok. ==See also== *Carpathian Germans *German minority in Poland *Pog\u00f3rzanie ==References== *J\u00f3zef Szujski.
