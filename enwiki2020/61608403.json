Bruss and Roger Blondel, was a French science fiction and fantasy writer, and a civil servant under the Nazi collaborationist Vichy regime (1940\u201344). == Biography == === Vichy collaborationist (1940\u20131944) === Bonnefoy was the editor-in-chief of the Moniteur du Puy-de-D\u00f4me, a newspaper bought by Pierre Laval in 1927. In liaison with Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, Bonnefoy expelled Jewish teachers from universities and created a chair on the history of Judaism at the Sorbonne University, entrusted to Henri Labroue. After Pierre Laval dismissed the team of Je Suis Partout from Radio-Vichy in September 1940 due to their extremism, he entrusted the direction of information to Bonnefoy, who became responsible for developing the themes of the R\u00e9volution Nationale over the radio. Upon the return of Laval to power in April 1942, Bonnefoy replaced Paul Marion\u2014then in charge of Information for the Vichy government\u2014as the head of press control. === Novelist (1946\u20131980) === Due to his past as a Vichy collaborationist, he had to use a pseudonym in order to publish his first novel Et la plan\u00e8te sauta... in 1946. Ten years later, he released the novel Le Mouton Enrag\u00e9 under the pen name Roger Blondel, adapted to the cinema in 1974 as Love at the Top and featuring Jean- Louis Trintignant and Jane Birkin. His other well known novels include Bradfer et l'\u00e9ternel (1964), Un endroit nomm\u00e9 la vie (1973) and Graffiti (1975). In 1978, he declared to the magazine Nouvelles litt\u00e9raires: \"I took the non- serious as center of gravity. The central subject of all my fables is the definition of the primordial sputtering. The one which is spontaneous, banal, overabundant, the one we hear in the street, at the coffee shops, in the subway, all these sonorous graffiti that show us daily that our world is empty...\" He was the father of literary critic Claude Bonnefoy. == Works == === Science fiction === * Et la Pan\u00e8te Sauta...
