Primary crops include Pima cotton, alfalfa hay, tomatoes, onions, and wheat, all cultivated on some mostly in Kings County, California. Boswell migrated to Pasadena, California as a regional cotton broker from Greene County, Georgia. He established his company in Corcoran, California in 1921. With the help of his brother, William Whittier Boswell, J. G. Boswell began growing and ginning cotton, as well as marketing it. From 1952 to 1984, the company was headed by J. G.'s nephew and William Boswell's son, James G. Boswell II (1923\u20132009). He is credited with the company's massive growth during the last half of the twentieth century. In the early 21st century, the J. G. Boswell Company is led by the son of J. G. Boswell II, James W. Boswell.Fresno Bee, April 5, 2009 ==Biography== Born in Penfield, Georgia in 1882, J. G.

Learning about development in California, he migrated there and settled in Pasadena. He bought property in Corcoran, located on Tulare Lake, which used to be the largest body of fresh water in the state. He worked to drain the wetlands around the lake, using dykes, ditches, canals, and dams in order to farm its fertile bed.

They managed the processing of the cotton and its marketing, and gradually acquired more property. Tulare Lake is still home to some of the world's biggest cotton farmers. ==See also== *James G.
