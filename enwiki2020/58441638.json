    "text": "Carlos Ramos (born 1971) is a Portuguese tennis umpire. Ramos, a gold badge chair umpire certified by the International Tennis Federation, is one of only two persons to have chair umpired a singles finals match in all four of the Grand Slam tournaments, the other being Alison Hughes. Ramos is also notable for umpiring many other high-profile matches and for penalizing several high- profile players during his decades-long career. == Career == Ramos' Wimbledon finals debut as chair umpire came at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's singles final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. In 2008 he chair umpired the match in which Venus Williams defeated her sister Serena Williams at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles. In 2012 he chair umpired the London Olympics final between Andy Murray and Roger Federer, making Ramos the only umpire to have chair umpired a singles final at all four Grand Slam tournaments and the Olympics. He has also officiated a number of matches in the Davis cup. A highly experienced umpire, Ramos developed a reputation for strict adherence to rules, to the point of being described as a \"stickler\". According to tennis experts, Ramos is one of the few umpires who isn't afraid to call a rules violation against elite players. ===Grand Slam Finals=== Ramos has been in the chair of a number of Grand Slam finals during his career which include: * 2005 Australian Open \u2013 Men's Singles * 2005 French Open - Women's Singles * 2007 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles * 2008 Australian Open \u2013 Men's Singles * 2008 French Open \u2013 Men's Singles * 2008 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles * 2011 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles * 2014 Australian Open \u2013 Men's Singles * 2016 Australian Open \u2013 Men's Singles * 2018 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles == Controversies == Ramos has issued violations to several high-profile tennis players who then objected to Ramos' penalties. === 2016 French Open === During the 2016 French Open, Ramos issued a code violation to Nick Kyrgios after the latter shouted at a ball boy about a towel during a match. Kyrgios continued to clash with Ramos after the violation was issued, stating later that Ramos was operating on a double standard since Kyrgios claimed his opponent (Marco Cecchinato) was also committing violation- worthy offenses. === 2016 Summer Olympics === At the 2016 Summer Olympics Ramos issued a code violation to Andy Murray after Murray criticized Ramos' \"stupid umpiring\". === 2017 French Open === During the 2017 French Open, Andy Murray received two time violations from Ramos, the second of which was a loss of first serve. Murray noted that he indeed had been in violation of the controversial time rule and described Ramos as a \"very good umpire\", but he criticized the penalty. Ramos also gave Novak Djokovic a loss of first serve after Djokovic committed multiple time violations. Djokovic then yelled to himself in Serbian and flipped a tennis ball at a ball boy behind him, leading to Ramos penalizing him for unsportsmanlike conduct. === 2018 US Open === At the 2018 US Open women's singles final between Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, Ramos gave Williams three code violations. Williams' first code violation was a warning for receiving coaching during the match (Williams' coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, later admitted to coaching using hand signals, though he noted the rule against such signals was not always enforced). Williams contested this, stating her coach had only given her a thumbs-up and reassuring Ramos that she never gets coaching or cheats. Later in the match, Williams intentionally broke her racket against the ground, incurring a second code violation from Ramos, which was a point penalty. Williams continued to argue with Ramos between games, first asking and then demanding he apologize for implying she was cheating by getting coaching, and then telling him, \"You stole a point from me\". Willams then told Ramos: \"You will never, ever, ever be on another [tennis] court of mine as long as you live ... You owe me an apology. Say it. Say you\u2019re sorry . . . How dare you insinuate that I was cheating. You stole a point from me. You're a thief, too.\". This exchange resulted in Ramos issuing Williams a third code violation for verbally abusing the umpire, which awarded a game to Osaka. Play was then stopped, and Williams called the tournament referee and supervisor onto the court, but the two officials upheld Ramos' violations. Williams went on to lose the match to Osaka 6\u20132 6\u20134. Williams was fined $17,000 for the violations. After the match Williams accused Ramos of sexism by claiming that men were not penalized in the same manner for the same conduct she was accused of. While Williams' claim was backed by the WTA and Billie Jean King, Williams' behavior was criticized by the US Open (which issued the $17,000 fine), and the ITF. Martina Navratilova provided a complex analysis of the incident, largely critical of Williams' outburst, but not dismissive of the possibility of a general double standard in tennis. Some observers noted that Williams as a player should have been experienced enough not to lose control of her emotions as she was well aware of the potential for a third violation, and there was also criticism that Williams was acting like a diva \"bigger than her sport\". The International Tennis Federation (ITF) supported Ramos, stating his \"decisions were in accordance\" with the Grand Slam Rulebook Code of Conduct which players agree to adhere to\u2014specifically Article III: Rule P of the Grand Slam Rulebook which forbids players from making a verbal remark towards an official that \"implies dishonesty\", such as \"liar\" and \"thief\". == References == Category:Tennis umpires Category:1971 births Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Portuguese sportspeople Category:Sportspeople from Lisbon ",
