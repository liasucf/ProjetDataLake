Jenkins and Block were both members of the band White Denim. The three founders had been accumulating equipment for some time, with the intention of creating a studio, when they met soul singer Leon Bridges, then working as a dish washer. After seeing Bridges perform, Jenkins, Block and Vivion used the studio to record Bridge's debut album Coming Home. Niles City Sound was credited with producing, mixing and co-writing the album, which was released by Columbia Records The album was recorded using only vintage machines https://www.npr.org/2015/02/02/383236124/leon-bridges-coming-home The studio prefers to use analog equipment, some of which dates between 1948 and 1962, and includes multitrack tape recorders. They believe this approach creates a human sound. Vogue wrote this of the recording process: \"They cut the tracks live, start to finish, for the most part no overdubs, with dozens of people dropping by to play along or simply sit in.\" http://www.vogue.com/13275356/leon-bridges-profile-coming-home-record-release/ Paste Magazine has credited the studio's production with having a \"classic, lo-fi feel\" https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/12/the-20-best-new- bands-of-2015.html?p=2 Nicole Atkins recorded at the studio in 2016. ==References== Category:Recording studios in the United States Category:Companies based in Fort Worth, Texas ",
