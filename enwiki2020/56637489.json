In 1967, Hsu was first elected to the Taoyuan County Council. He was reelected twice thereafter as a county council member. Hsu became county magistrate in 1981, due to the support of Hokkien-speaking voters in Taoyuan supportive of the Kuomintang. Upon the end of his second term, Hsu was succeeded by Liu Pang-yu, who took office backed by Hakka voters affiliated with the Kuomintang. Hsu died of lung cancer at the age of 81 on 28 January 2018. ==References== Category:1937 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Taiwan Category:Kuomintang politicians in Taiwan Category:Magistrates of Taoyuan County Category:Soochow University (Taiwan) alumni Category:Taiwanese schoolteachers ",
