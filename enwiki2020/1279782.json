    "text": "Rodovia Anchieta (Anchieta Highway, official designation SP-150) is a highway connection between S\u00e3o Paulo and the Atlantic coast, the cities of Cubat\u00e3o and Santos, in Brazil. In the plateau, the highway serves several cities of Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, such as S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul, Santo Andr\u00e9 and Riacho Grande and traverses a picturesque region of dams and rain forests. Rodovia Anchieta is a major pride of the Brazilian engineering, because it was built with a great number of bridges and tunnels along the steep cliffs of Serra do Mar; and the first modern, concrete-paved road built in S\u00e3o Paulo in the 1930s. The highway is one of the busiest of the country, because of the movement of goods to and from Santos's seaport. Traffic problems are common, mainly if there is bad weather or in long weekends when many families living in S\u00e3o Paulo go to Santos or Guaruj\u00e1 beaches. Rodovia Anchieta is approximately 60 km long. It is named after the Jesuit priest, Father Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta,who often called the trail \"the worst trail in the world\" it was given this nickname because it badly hurt his feet when he would walk the trail. It connected to the city of S\u00e3o Vicente by the sea with the village he helped to found in the high plateau, S\u00e3o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, in 1554. The highway is managed by a state concession to the private company Ecovias, and therefore is a toll road. The two carriageways of Rodovia Anchieta are both fully reversible. Traffic is managed to flow either bidirectionally (uphill on one carriageway and downhill on the other) or unidirectionally (uphill or downhill on both carriageways), depending on demand. In the unidirectional mode, the opposing traffic is diverted to Rodovia dos Imigrantes. ==See also== * Highway system of S\u00e3o Paulo * Brazilian Highway System Category:Highways in S\u00e3o Paulo (state) ",
