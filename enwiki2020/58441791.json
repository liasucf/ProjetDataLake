The Supreme Council of Flanders (Consejo Supremo de Flandes y Borgo\u00f1a, or simply Consejo de Flandes) was a governing institution in the Spanish Empire responsible for advising the king of Spain on the exercise of his prerogatives in the Spanish Netherlands, particularly regarding ecclesiastical nominations, the appointment of high officials, royal pardons, and awards of honours such as knighthoods and noble titles.Quint\u00edn Aldea Vaquero, Los miembros de todos los consejos de Espa\u00f1a en la decada de 1630 a 1640, Anuario de historia del derecho espa\u00f1ol, 50 (1980), p. 198. ==History== The Supreme Council of Flanders was first founded in 1588, under Philip II of Spain, but was disbanded at his death, when the sovereignty of the Spanish Netherlands passed to Albert VII of Austria, ruling on behalf of his wife, the Infanta Isabella. The council was re-established in 1627 under Philip IV of Spain. It was finally abolished in 1702. The institution's archives are in the Archivo General de Simancas. ==Membership== When reinstituted in 1627, the council was intended to consist of six members assisted by two secretaries. Three of the members were to be jurists and three members of the high nobility, with at least one member to be a native of the Low Countries and one of the noblemen acting as president. The council was very seldom effectively at full strength. ===President=== * Diego Felipez de Guzm\u00e1n, 1st Marquis of Legan\u00e9s, 1628-1653 * Filippo Spinola, 2nd Marquis of the Balbases, 1653-1659 * Antonio Sancho D\u00e1vila de Toledo y Colonna, 1660-1666 ===Secretary=== * Gabriel de Roy, knight, 1627-1645 * Jean Hernart, 1627-1631 * Juan Osvaldo de Brito, 1628-1637 * Jacques Brecht, 1638-1660 * Jean Vecquer, or Weckert, 1660-1673 ===Councillor=== * Jean de Cro\u00ff, Count of Solre, 1627-1640 * Pierre Roose, 1630-1632 * Jean de Gaverelles, 1633-1645 * Robert van Asseliers, 1639/40\u20141652 * Antoon De Vulder, 1639/40-1644 * Antoine Brun, 1642-1654 * Michel de Coxie, knight, 1652-1660 * Boudewijn Van der Piet, 1652-1658 * Aurele Augustin Van Male, 1660-1662 * Charles de Watteville, 1660-1670 * Koenraad Van der Brughen, 1661-1662 * Jean-Antoine Locquet, 1663-1669 * Jean-Baptiste de Brouchoven, Count of Bergeyck, 1663-1681 * Simon de Fierlant, 1663-1668 * Esteban de Gamarra y Contreras, 1663-1671 ==References== Category:1588 establishments in Europe Category:1627 establishments in Europe Category:1598 disestablishments in Europe Category:1702 disestablishments in Europe Category:Spanish Empire in Europe ",
