The line is one of several true funiculars in the city, including the Sant'Anna funicular and the Quezzi funicular, although the Principe\u2013Granarolo rack railway is also sometimes erroneously described as a funicular. == History == The line was originally built as a two-section funicular, with passengers transferring between the two sections at the station of San Nicola. The upper section opened in 1895 and was constructed in the open, with three intermediate stations at Madonnetta, Via Preve and San Simone, as well as the section terminals at San Nicola and Righi. The lower section opened in 1897 and was entirely in tunnel, except for its terminals and the single intermediate station at Carbonara. Between 1963 and 1965, the line was completely rebuilt as a single section funicular, with a passing loop at San Nicola and retaining all the existing stations. In 1990, the line was again rebuilt, with longer trains and platforms, and an increased haulage speed. The line closed on 31 March 2015 for an overhaul, which is expected to last 3 months. == Operation == The line is currently managed by AMT Genova, and has the following parameters: {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse; font-size:95%; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px;\" |- |Number of cars |2 trains of 2 cars each |- |Number of stops |7 (2 terminal, 5 intermediate) |- |Configuration |Single track with passing loop |- |Track length | |- |Track gauge | |- |Rise | |- |Gradient |19.91% (average); 35% (maximum) |- |Capacity |156 passengers per train |- |Frequency |Every 15 minutes |- |Maximum speed | |- |} == See also == * List of funicular railways == References == == External links == * * Page at www.amt.genova.it, the metropolitan transport website Category:Funicular railways in Italy Category:Railway lines in Liguria Category:Transport in Genoa ",
