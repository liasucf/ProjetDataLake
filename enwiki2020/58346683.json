Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. ==Background== The event was the eighth of the 2018 season and marked the start of the playoffs. Philipe Lins was expected to face Valdrin Istrefi in a playoff bout at this event, however, Istrefi was removed due to injury and replaced by the highest ranked alternate on the undercard, Caio Alencar. As a result, Alencar's original opponent of Mike Kyle was paired with Mo De'Reese in a bout to determine a new alternate. Timur Valiev was expected to face Alexandre de Almeida in a playoff bout at this event, however, Valiev was removed due to injury and replaced by the highest ranked alternate on the undercard, Jumabieke Tuerxun. As a result, Tuerxun's original opponent of Marcos Galv\u00e3o was set to face Jeremy Kennedy in a bout to determine a new alternate. However, on the day of the event Kennedy dropped out due to undisclosed reasons, and so Galvao was automatically pushed forward as the new alternate instead. ==Fight card== ==2018 PFL Heavyweight playoffs== * Valdrin Istrefi was originally scheduled to face Philipe Lins but was forced to pull out of the bout.
