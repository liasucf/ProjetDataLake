I wouldn't class them > as singers. like I would Whitney Houston or someone, but they have the > ability to do that because it's in their range and I knew it was in my > ability because I can sing along with them, but I can't sing. I always had > in my head, 'I'm gonna make a record where there are no rap verses.' And > that's what '6 Words' is. It's not like everyday rap and I'd say that Gary > Barlow and Chris Martin inspired it because, in the studio, all I was > thinking was that I needed to write a better song than what they would > write.\" ==Music video== A music video to accompany the release of \"6 Words\" was first released onto YouTube on 14 October 2014.
