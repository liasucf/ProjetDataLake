    "text": "alt= Clearnet is a term typically referring to the publicly accessible Internet, the opposite of the term darknet which typically describes the services built on Tor or other anonymity networks, the connection to which is encrypted and anonymized. The World Wide Web is one of the most popular distributed services on the Internet, and the surface web is composed of the web pages and databases that are indexed by traditional search engines. The opposite of the surface web is the deep web, which is not indexed, but most of which is publicly accessible. It includes web portals to databases that require text searches, and interactive web sites that require more user input than simply clicking hyperlinks. Because the darknet is not publicly accessible, it is part of the deep web. Sometimes \"clearnet\" is used as a synonym for \"surface web\"\u2014excluding both the darknet and the deep web. ==Characteristics== Without the use of anonymity services like Tor, browsing the Clearnet is typically not anonymous; most websites routinely identify users by their IP address as well as other data transmitted by the client. == References == Category:Internet terminology Category:World Wide Web Category:Dark web ",
