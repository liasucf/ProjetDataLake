Chavos is best remembered for his four-and-a-half year spell with PAOK. During the later stages of his career, he played with several clubs in the lower divisions. As a manager, he has coached several clubs in Greece and Cyprus. ==Playing career== ===Club=== After playing as an amateur for Achilleas Triandria, Chavos transferred to Olympiacos in 1987.

He then transferred to A.O Trikala and enjoyed a fairly successful season, appearing in 28 games and scoring 2 goals. He then transferred to Panserraikos for the next 3 years, appearing in a total of 82 games and scoring 8 goals. This earned him a move to PAOK in 1992 where he spent the next four and a half seasons with the Thessaloniki-based club. Whilst playing for PAOK, he received his one and only cap with the Greek national team, appearing in a friendly against Cyprus on September 2, 1992. ===International=== His sole cap for the Greek national team came in a friendly game against Cyprus on the 2nd of September, 1992, at the Kaftanzoglio Stadium.
