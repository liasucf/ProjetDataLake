    "text": "The \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m distribution is a Linux distribution for a variety of embedded devices. The distribution is the result of work by developers from the OpenZaurus, OpenEmbedded, and OpenSIMpad projects. The graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available are OPIE and GPE among other options. The \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m distribution is in \"competition\" with Poky Linux. \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m is based on the OpenEmbedded project, specifically the OpenEmbedded-Core (OE-Core) layer. While both \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m and Poky Linux are based on OE-Core, mostly utilize the same toolchain and are both officially \"Yocto compatible\", only Poky Linux is officially part of the Yocto Project. \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m primarily differs from Poky Linux in being a binary distribution (like e.g. the Debian, Fedora, OpenSuse or Ubuntu Linux distributions), using opkg for package management. Hence an essential part of \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m builds is a binary package feed, allowing to simply install software distributed as opkg packages, without having to compile them first (just as one might install a binary package with aptitude or dpkg). == Target platforms == According to the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m wiki, \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m is being developed for at least the following devices: * Sharp Zaurus: ** SL-5500 (Collie) ** SL-5600 (Poodle) ** SL-6000 (Tosa) ** SL-C7x0 (Corgi, Husky, Shepherd) ** SL-C860 (Boxer) ** SL-C1000 (Akita) ** SL-C3xxx (Spitz, Borzoi, Terrier) * Hewlett Packard iPAQ PDA ** h2200 ** h4000 ** hx4700 ** h5000 * Nokia 770 Internet Tablet * HTC Universal/iMate JasJar * Motorola A780 * Psion Teklogix NetBook Pro * Gumstix and Kouchuk-Bars * Hawkboard * BeagleBoard * BeagleBone and BeagleBone Black * PandaBoard * OpenPandora * OMAPEVM * Base for Openmoko distribution * Archos 5 * Archos 7 * Archos 5 Internet Tablet * Archos 101 * Archos 32 * Archos 28 * Minnowboard * Polyvision Roomwizard * piA-AM335x == See also == * Familiar Linux * OPIE * Openmoko * OpenPandora * OpenZaurus * WebOS * Pocket PC * Windows Mobile == References == == External links == * * \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m Manual Category:ARM Linux distributions Category:Debian- based distributions Category:Embedded Linux distributions Category:Operating systems using GPE Category:Personal digital assistant software ",
