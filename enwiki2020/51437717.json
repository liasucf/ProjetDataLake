The 72 series included the main production batch of 490 vehicles as well as 667 former 63 series cars converted into 72 series between 1953 and 1955. The last remaining trains were withdrawn in 1985, although some cars which were converted into mail coaches and experimental vehicles continued to remain in service until 1996. Most 72 series trains were converted to four-car 72-970 series trains, with the body based on the 103 series with the raised cab. The 72-970 series remained in service until 1985 when they were converted to 103-3000 series for the Kawagoe Line. ==Variants== * 72 series - introduced in 1954, produced from 1952 to 1958 * 72-970 series - later converted to 103-3000 series * Kumoha 73 - cab car (about 330 vehicles built) File:JNR kuha79 syanai.jpg|Interior view of Kuha 79446 File:103-3000 52 Haijima 20010801.jpg|Kawagoe Line 103-3000 series set 52 stabled at Haijima Station File:JNR kumoha73061 hiroshima.jpg|Kumoha 73061 ==Operations== 72 series trains were in service on the Ome Line from 1961 until 1978, and on the Kabe Line from 1976 until 1984. trains were in service on the Ome Line, Nambu Line, Yokohama Line, and Tsurumi Line. ==Preserved examples== * KuMoHa 73383: Privately preserved in Saeki, Hiroshima.
