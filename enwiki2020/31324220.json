    "text": "In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, the barrier cone is a cone associated to any non-empty subset of a Banach space. It is closely related to the notions of support functions and polar sets. ==Definition== Let X be a Banach space and let K be a non-empty subset of X. The barrier cone of K is the subset b(K) of X\u2217, the continuous dual space of X, defined by :b(K) := \\left\\\\{ \\ell \\in X^{\\ast} \\,\\left|\\, \\sup_{x \\in K} \\langle \\ell, x \\rangle < \\+ \\infty \\right. \\right\\\\}. ==Related notions== The function :\\sigma_{K} \\colon \\ell \\mapsto \\sup_{x \\in K} \\langle \\ell, x \\rangle, defined for each continuous linear functional \u2113 on X, is known as the support function of the set K; thus, the barrier cone of K is precisely the set of continuous linear functionals \u2113 for which \u03c3K(\u2113) is finite. The set of continuous linear functionals \u2113 for which \u03c3K(\u2113) \u2264 1 is known as the polar set of K. The set of continuous linear functionals \u2113 for which \u03c3K(\u2113) \u2264 0 is known as the (negative) polar cone of K. Clearly, both the polar set and the negative polar cone are subsets of the barrier cone. ==References== * Category:Functional analysis ",
