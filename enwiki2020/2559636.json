    "text": "Hariclea Darcl\u00e9e (n\u00e9e Haricli; later Hartulari; 10 June 1860 \u2013 12 January 1939) was a celebrated Romanian operatic soprano who had a three-decade-long career. Darcl\u00e9e's repertoire ranged from coloratura soprano roles to heavier Verdi roles, including many in the Franco-Italian lyric repertory. Throughout her career she participated in several world premieres, creating the title roles in Puccini's Tosca, Mascagni's Iris, and Catalani's La Wally. Puccini reportedly considered her to have been \"the most beautiful and exquisite Manon\". Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo, regarded as the most comprehensive international performing arts encyclopedia, named Darcl\u00e9e \"world's greatest singer for 25 years\". Darcl\u00e9e was considered the equivalent, in the opera world, of Sarah Bernhardt. ==Early years== Darcl\u00e9e was born Hariclea Haricli in Br\u0103ila to a family with Greek roots. Her father, Ion Haricli, was a landlord in the Teleorman district. Her mother, Maria Aslan, was a relative of the noble Mavrocordatos family. The family lived for a while in the town of Turnu M\u0103gurele in southern Romania. She began her studies at Conservatoire of music in Ia\u015fi, making her professional appearances as a concert performer in 1884. ==Career== Costume design for her role in the premi\u00e8re production of La Wally Hariclea Darcl\u00e9e as Manon in 1896, Saint Charles Royal Theatre, Lisbon She continued her studies in Paris under Jean-Baptiste Faure. She married a young officer, Iorgu Hartulari, and became known for a while as Hariclea Hartulari-Darcl\u00e9e, Darcl\u00e9e being the nom de th\u00e9\u00e2tre she adopted when she made her debut at the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1888 as Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust. In 1889, she replaced Adelina Patti as Juliette in Gounod's Rom\u00e9o et Juliette, to increasing acclaim. In 1890, Darcl\u00e9e scored a great success in her La Scala debut as Chim\u00e8ne in Jules Massenet\u2019s Le Cid, and was immediately engaged by all the leading Italian theatres. Highlights of her later career in Italy from 1890 on included the world-premi\u00e8res of the part of Odalea in Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes' Condor at La Scala in Milan in 1891, the title-role in Alfredo Catalani's La Wally at the same theater in 1892, Luisa in Pietro Mascagni's I Rantzau at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence in 1892, and the title roles in Pietro Mascagni's Iris and Giacomo Puccini's Tosca, both at Teatro Costanzi in Rome in 1899 and 1900, respectively. Between 1893 and 1910 she appeared frequently in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Lisbon, Barcelona, Madrid, and Buenos Aires. She was very popular in Spain and South America, where she participated in many local premi\u00e8res of new operas by Puccini, Mascagni, and Massenet. Among the many roles she portrayed are Gilda in Rigoletto, Oph\u00e9lie in Hamlet, Valentine in Les Huguenots, Violetta in La traviata, Desdemona in Otello, Mim\u00ec in La boh\u00e8me, Santuzza in Cavalleria Rusticana, and the title roles in Manon, Manon Lescaut, Aida, and Carmen. The last performance of her career was as Juliette in Rom\u00e9o et Juliette at the Teatro Lirico in Milan in 1918. ==Personal life== Darcl\u00e9e's son was composer Ion Hartulari Darcl\u00e9e (1886\u20131969), who was known particularly as a writer of operettas. Both she and her son are interred in Bucharest's Bellu cemetery. ==Legacy== Started in 1995, the Hariclea Darcl\u00e9e Festival and International Voice Competition is held every two years in Br\u0103ila. ==Repertory== Hariclea Darcl\u00e9e sang 58 roles on 56 operas (32 operas of tradition, 12 in absolute premi\u00e8re and 16 operas in important premi\u00e8res) by 31 composers (12 composers of the tradition and 19 young composers with new operas interpreted in absolute premi\u00e8re);
