The season ended with the Los Angeles Lakers winning their second straight championship, beating the Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 1 in the 2001 NBA Finals. ==Notable occurrences== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right\" |+Coaching changes ! colspan=\"3\"|Offseason |- !

The East won 111\u2013110, with Philadelphia's Allen Iverson being named the game's Most Valuable Player. The game is noted for the Eastern Conference's 21-point comeback in the fourth quarter. * The Grizzlies play their final season in Vancouver, British Columbia before relocating to Memphis, Tennessee for the following season leaving the Toronto Raptors being the only Canadian team left in the NBA. * Rick Pitino resigned as head coach and president of the Boston Celtics, ending a three-plus-year tenure filled with turmoil, disappointment and three consecutive below .500, non-playoff seasons. * The Dallas Mavericks played their final season at Reunion Arena. They also made the playoffs for the first time since the 1989\u201390 season. They also made it past the first round for the first time since the 1987\u201388 season. * The Los Angeles Lakers win their second straight title by going 15\u20131 in the playoffs, then the best playoff winning percentage in NBA history (later surpassed by the 2017 Golden State Warriors). * The Toronto Raptors made the second round of the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, winning over New York 3\u20132. They lost in the second round to Philadelphia 4\u20133. * Prior to the season, Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning announced that he suffered a kidney disorder and missed the first five months of the season. Mourning would receive a kidney transplant two years later. *To date, this was the last time a team with the best regular season record did not win 60 or more games in a full 82-game season. Though the 2011\u201312 Chicago Bulls and the 2011\u201312 San Antonio Spurs each won 50 games and the top conference seeds, they did so during a 66-game lockout-shortened regular season. * Effective of this season, the league now permitted players to wear knee-length shorts by default, although players like John Stockton opted to continue wearing short shorts during the season. This would be the case for other players in the future as players like Chris Douglas-Roberts in the 2014\u201315 season and LeBron James for some of the 2015\u201316 season would opt to wear short shorts. *Three teams in the Western Conference who missed the playoffs won 40 or more games. The ninth- placed Houston Rockets finished the season with a 45\u201337 record, the tenth- placed Seattle SuperSonics finished with a 44\u201338 record, and the eleventh- placed Denver Nuggets ended the season with a 40\u201342 record. ==2000\u201301 NBA changes== * The Los Angeles Clippers changed their uniforms. * The New Jersey Nets slightly changed their alternate uniforms. * The Orlando Magic changed their logo. * The Philadelphia 76ers slightly changed their uniforms. * The Phoenix Suns changed their logo and uniforms, adding gray to their color scheme. * The Vancouver Grizzlies changed their home uniforms, while the alternate uniforms became their primary road jersey. ==Standings== ===By division=== ;Eastern Conference ;Western Conference ===By conference=== Notes *z \u2013 Clinched home court advantage for the entire playoffs *c \u2013 Clinched home court advantage for the conference playoffs *y \u2013 Clinched division title *x \u2013 Clinched playoff spot ==Playoffs== Teams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Home- court advantage does not necessarily belong to the higher-seeded team, but instead the team with the better regular season record; teams enjoying the home advantage are shown in italics. ==Statistics leaders== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ |- | Category || Player || Team || Stat |- | Points per game || Allen Iverson || Philadelphia 76ers || 31.1 |- | Rebounds per game || Dikembe Mutombo || Atlanta Hawks Philadelphia 76ers || 13.5 |- | Assists per game || Jason Kidd || Phoenix Suns || 9.8 |- | Steals per game || Allen Iverson || Philadelphia 76ers || 2.51 |- | Blocks per game || Theo Ratliff || Philadelphia 76ers || 3.74 |- | FG% || Shaquille O'Neal || Los Angeles Lakers || .572 |- | FT% || Reggie Miller || Indiana Pacers || .928 |- | 3FG% || Brent Barry || Seattle SuperSonics || .472 |- |} ==Awards== ===Yearly awards=== *Most Valuable Player: Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers *Rookie of the Year: Mike Miller, Orlando Magic *Defensive Player of the Year: Dikembe Mutombo, Philadelphia 76ers/Atlanta Hawks *Sixth Man of the Year: Aaron McKie, Philadelphia 76ers *Most Improved Player: Tracy McGrady, Orlando Magic *Coach of the Year: Larry Brown, Philadelphia 76ers *Executive of the Year: Geoff Petrie, Sacramento Kings *Sportsmanship Award: David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs *All-NBA First Team: **F \u2013 Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs **F \u2013 Chris Webber, Sacramento Kings **C \u2013 Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers **G \u2013 Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers **G \u2013 Jason Kidd, Phoenix Suns *All-NBA Second Team: **F \u2013 Kevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves **F \u2013 Vince Carter, Toronto Raptors **C \u2013 Dikembe Mutombo, Atlanta Hawks **G \u2013 Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers **G \u2013 Tracy McGrady, Orlando Magic *All-NBA Third Team: **F \u2013 Karl Malone, Utah Jazz **F \u2013 Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks **C \u2013 David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs **G \u2013 Gary Payton, Seattle SuperSonics **G \u2013 Ray Allen, Milwaukee Bucks *NBA All-Defensive First Team: **Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs **Kevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves **Dikembe Mutombo, Atlanta Hawks **Gary Payton, Seattle SuperSonics **Jason Kidd, Phoenix Suns *All-Defensive Second Team: **Bruce Bowen, Miami Heat **P.
