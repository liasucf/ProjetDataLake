He lives in Saransk, the capital city of the Republic of Mordovia, Russia. He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of several minor planets during 2009\u20132010, all in collaboration with Russian astronomer and college Artyom Novichonok at Tzec Maun Observatory in Mayhill, New Mexico. According to the Comet Observation database (COBS), which is maintained by the Slovenian \u010crni Vrh Observatory, Dmitry Chestnov has submitted dozens of observations of comets under his user code \"CHE09\". Several cometary observations, including those of the hyperbolic comet C/2009 O4 (HILL) he took at Tzec Maun's southern station in Pingelly, Western Australia. He also participated in the recovery of periodic comet 246P/NEAT at the Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station of Pulkovo Observatory in November 2011 (). He has published a large number of secular lightcurves of comets on his Comet Light Curve Refinement Program (LiCuRG) website. His Apollo and Amor near-Earth object observations, published in MPC's Minor Planet Electronic Circulars during 2009\u20132011, include (), (), (), (), (), and (). == List of discovered minor planets == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin- right: 1em; height: 224px; |- | 228165 Mezentsev || 26 September 2009 || |- | 231649 Korotkiy || 17 November 2009 || |- | || 17 November 2009 || |- | || 25 November 2009 || |- | 274981 Petrsu || 12 October 2009 || |- | || 17 December 2009 || |- | || 17 October 2009 || |- | || 17 November 2009 || |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin- right: 1em; height: 224px; |- | || 17 October 2009 || |- | || 17 November 2009 || |- | || 18 November 2009 || |- | || 9 November 2009 || |- | || 18 October 2009 || |- | || 20 November 2009 || |- | || 21 November 2009 || |- | || 9 January 2010 || |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin-right: 1em; |- | || 9 November 2009 || |- | || 11 January 2010 || |- ! colspan=3 style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left; padding: 4px 12px;\" |Co-discovery made with: A.
