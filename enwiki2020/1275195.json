Locals call the town Little Baguio of Laguna because of its high elevation and cool climate like the City of Baguio. ==History== During the 17th century, there was an area of land in Laguna known as Terreno de Nasonog (Lupa\u00edn ng Nasonog in Tagalog). In 1678, Terreno de Nas\u00fanog was divided into three parts: Nas\u00fanog de Lucban, Nasonog de Cavinti, and Nas\u00fanog de Majayjay. Nasonog de Majayjay later became the town of Luisiana. It was only on April 3, 1854 that ecclesiastical independence was granted to Nasonog by the Governor-General (the Marqu\u00e9s de Novaliches) with the corresponding approval from the Archbishop of Manila, having Don Marcos Bartolom\u00e9 as its first interim parish priest. Because of the role of Don Luis Bern\u00e1rdo, which was then regarded as the Father of Luisiana, and his wife Do\u00f1a Ana, the town was named 'Luis y Ana', later changed to 'Luisiana'. In 1948, Visita de Luisiana gained civil independence from Majayjay. In 1903, the towns of Cavinti and Luisiana were combined, Pedro Villanueva of Cavinti was elected mayor and it was during his term that the Aglipay Church was founded in April, 1904. The Romana family funded the construction of a couple of Protestant churches. However, on November 12, 1907 under the leadership of Don Blas Oraci\u00f3n, through the Civil Commission, Cavinti and Luisiana became independent towns. ==Geography== away from Manila and away from the provincial capital, Santa Cr\u00faz, the town of Luisiana is bounded on the north by Pags\u00e1njan and Cavinti, on the west by Magdalena and Majayjay, on the south by Lucban, Quezon, and Sampaloc in the east. Luisiana occupies on a plateau atop the Sierra Madre mountains. ==Barangays== Luisiana is politically subdivided into 23 barangays. * De La Paz * Barangay Zone I (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone II (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone III (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone IV (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone V (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone VI (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone VII (Poblacion) * Barangay Zone VIII (Poblacion) * San Antonio * San Buenaventura * San Diego * San Isidro * San Jos\u00e9 * San Juan * San Luis * San Pablo * San Pedro * San Rafa\u00e9l * San Roque * San Salvador * Santo Domingo * Santo Tom\u00e1s ===Climate=== The climate is cold, humid, and tropical. The average yearly temperature is around 26 \u00b0C (78.8 \u00b0F). ==Demographics== In the , the population of Luisiana, Laguna, was people, with a density of . ==Economy== Luisiana is basically an agricultural town. At the poblaci\u00f3n, there are only a few commercial establishments which cater to the basic services of the people. Most of them still go to Santa Cr\u00faz to do their shopping or marketing and to avail themselves of other services not available in their town. Sources of income of the people of Luisiana are mainly focused on agriculture such as copra, pandan, palay, bamboo and bunliw, with light industry base and service- sector economy. Piggery and poultry farming are also an additional income. ==Transportation== Going to Luisiana by private transportation from Manila, you will pass by the South Superhighway and enter the province via the Calamba exit. Another way is through the Manila East Road(Route 601, Route 602, Route 603 and Route 605)\u2013 Pags\u00e1njan route or coming from Quezon, the Lucb\u00e1n, Tayabas City, Lucena City and Pagbilao, Quezon Route Even from Bicol Region. Luisiana is also accessible by public transportation taking the same routes as mentioned above. However, whichever route you take, a trip to Luisiana will still be long since it is one of the inner towns in Laguna. From Manila via Calamb\u00e2, a bus will take you to Santa Cruz, Laguna. In Santa Cruz, jeepneys going to Luisiana can be found at the jeepney terminal. Just ask a tricycle driver to take you to the terminal of jeepneys going to Luisiana. Via Santa Cr\u00faz, you will pass by the town of Pagsanj\u00e1n before reaching Luisiana. You will easily know it when you have reached the town because the roads become zigzagged with many sharp twists and turns. This is one of the reasons why Luisiana is called the 'little Baguio of Laguna.' ==Sites and events== A candidate in Miss Luisiana beauty pageant wearing pandan costume At the centre of the town, some of the sites are the Roman Catholic Church, the monument of Don Luis Bern\u00e1rdo (town\u2019s founder) and a monument of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Protacio Rizal. But one interesting site in town is the \"guard dogs\" at the stairs in front of the municipal building. Instead of lions which are common sites or designs in stairs of other buildings, the municipal building of Luisiana has two dogs, which look like Dalmatians, one in each side of the building. However, no one can tell why they are there or what is the story behind the presence of the dogs in the building. Some of them believe that the dogs might have been a part of the town\u2019s history which is yet to be discovered. Aside from the man- made attractions, Luisiana is also home to natural attractions like falls (such as Hulugan,Hulugan Waterfalls Bumb\u00f3ngan, Malaog, Maapon, Limbun-limb\u00f3n, Aliw,Aliw Waterfalls Lagasl\u00e1s and Botoc\u00e1n-Tiklingan) and caves (such as the caves of Simbahang Bato and But\u00e1s Kabag). Although most of these attractions are not yet fully developed commercially, they are open for the public to see in their natural state. Town feast is celebrated on October 9 for the feast of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary. Another celebration in town is held every 3 April, which is in commemoration of the town\u2019s establishment as a separate entity from Maj\u00e1yjay. Luisiana also celebrates the Pand\u00e1n Festival during this month and also the annual Miss Luisiana beauty pageant to select representative for Miss Laguna beauty pageant.
