    "text": "Kano\u00ea or Kapishana is a nearly extinct language isolate of Rond\u00f4nia, Brazil. The Kapishana people now speak Portuguese or other indigenous languages from intermarriage. The language names are also spelled Kapixana, Kapixan\u00e3, and Cano\u00e9, the last shared with Awa-Canoeiro. The Kano\u00ea people, although disperse in the southeastern part of the state of Rond\u00f4nia, live mainly along the Guarop\u00e9 River. The language is nearly extinct, with only 5 speakers in a population of about 319 Kano\u00ea people. ==Classification== Although Kano\u00ea is generally considered to be a language isolate, there have been various proposals linking it with other languages and language families. Van der Voort (2005) observes similarities among Kano\u00ea, Kwaza, and Aikan\u00e3, but believes the evidence is not strong enough to definitively link the three languages together as part of a single language family.Van der Voort, Hein. 2005. Kwaza in a comparative perspective. International Journal of American Linguistics 71: 365\u2013412. Price (1978) proposes a relationship with the Nambikwaran languages,Price, David P. 1978. The Nambiquara linguistic family. Anthropological Linguistics 20 (1): 14\u201337. while Kaufman (1994, 2007) suggests that Kunza is related.Kaufman, Terrence. 1994. The native languages of South America. In: Christopher Moseley and R. E. Asher (eds.), Atlas of the World\u2019s Languages, 59\u201393. London: Routledge.Kaufman, Terrence. 2007. South America. In: R. E. Asher and Christopher Moseley (eds.), Atlas of the World\u2019s Languages (2nd edition), 59\u201394. London: Routledge. ==Language contact== Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with Kwaza, Aikan\u00e3, and the Nambikwaran languages due to contact. ==History== The first contact of the Kano\u00e9 people with the \"white man\" brought a lot of death through sickness. Many of the people died of pertussis, measles, and stomach problems since they did not have the medicine needed to fight the diseases that were available to the \"white man\". There was also a lot of death due to conflicts with the farmers in the area. The Kano\u00ea people can be found in two main areas, the banks of the Guapor\u00e9 River and the Omor\u00ea River. The main population, living by Guapor\u00e9 River, share the land with other indigenous people and a long history of cohabitation with the \"white man\". Most of them are inserted into the Brazilian society and married to people belonging to other indigenous groups. Only three of them still speak the Kano\u00ea language today. By the Omer\u00ea River, a single family of Kano\u00ea can be found, with much less influence from the Brazilian society. Having fled into a forest reserve, this group is considered isolated indigenous people, only allowing outside contact in 1995 after many years of attempts by the Ethno Environmental Protection Front. As of 2003, only four people remained of this Kano\u00ea family, with two of them being monolingual Kano\u00ea speakers. The area by the Omer\u00ea River is believed to be the original territory of the Kano\u00ea people by Victor Dequech (1942) and Etta Becker-Donner (1955). ==Current status== For a long time Kano\u00ea was too poorly attested to classify. Various proposals were advanced on little evidence; Price (1978) for example thought Kano\u00ea might be one of the Nambikwaran languages. When it was finally described in some detail, by Bacelar (2004), it turned out to be a language isolate. It is believed to have been a naturally developed language, adapted to the needs of the Kano\u00ea people. The first written study of the Kano\u00ea language available today, dates back to 1943 when Stanislav Zach published a vocabulary of the Kano\u00ea tribe, which was later updated in 1963 by Cestm\u00edr Loukotka. A preliminary report of the phonological features of the Kano\u00ea language was published by La\u00e9rcio Bacelar in 1992, with a second report and an analysis of the phonology published in 1994. Bacelar and Cleiton Pereira wrote a paper on the morphosyntax of the language in 1996. And in 1998 a paper on the negation and litotes of the language was published by Bacelar and Augusto Silva J\u00fanior. Since then, La\u00e9rcio Bacelar has been the main linguist investigating the language and working alongside the Kano\u00ea people. In 2004 he published a detailed description of its phonology, grammar and syntax. A project called Etnografia e Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o da Lingua Kano\u00e9 is underway with a lexicographic and ethnographic approach to record auditory and written data of the Kano\u00ea language. The project is currently coordinated by La\u00e9rcio Nora Bacelar, a Brazilian linguist, and is funded by FUNAI - Museu do \u00cdndio and by UNESCO. The project also has the support of the entire Kano\u00ea community from both the Guarop\u00e9 and the Omor\u00ea rivers. ==Phonology== ===Consonants=== {|class=\"IPA wikitable\" ! !Bilabial !Alveolar !Palatal !Velar |- !Stop ||||| || |- !Affricate | |||| || |- !Fricative ||| || || |- !Nasal ||||||| |- !Approximant | || |||| |- !Flap | |||| || |} is limited to a few verb forms, \u203fwhere it occurs before . is highly variable, , with the affricates being the more common, rare, and most common before . is between vowels, after and occasionally initially. varies as . is before , a pattern which occurs during metathesis. is very rarely realized as . are nasalized after nasal vowels. ===Vowels=== {|class=\"IPA wikitable\" |i||\u0129||\u0268||\u0268\u0303||u||\u0169 |- |e||\u1ebd|| || ||o||\u00f5 |- |\u00e6||\u00e6\u0303||a||\u028c\u0303|| || |} Vowel qualities are , all oral and nasal; the nasal vowels have slightly different or variable pronunciations: . Oral vowels are optionally nasalized next to nasal stops, with the variation of phonemically nasal vowels. varies as after and next to an approximant. varies as after voiceless consonants. varies as after . Vowels may have a voiceless offglide (effectively ) when not followed by a voiced sound. Vowels are long when they constitute a morpheme of their own. Stress is on the last syllable of a word. Maximally complex syllable is CGVG, where G is a glide , or, due to epenthesis in certain morphological situations or to elision, the final consonant may be . One of the more syllabically complex words is 'to shave'. Vowel sequences occur, as in 'chief'. ==Morphology== Kano\u00ea is a polysynthetic language, where the more complex words are the verbs (Payne 1997). It is also primarily an agglutinative language, and many words are formed by simple roots, juxtaposition and suffixation. The gender can be expressed by suffixation or by a hyperonym, and while Kano\u00ea does not make a distinction of number, it does make a distinction between uncountable and countable nouns, where the suffix {-te} is added . The syntax order of Kano\u00ea follows SOV = subject + object + verb. In the Kano\u00ea language, the process of morphological reduplication is used to form frequentative verbs. For example, manamana 'kneading', or ma\u00f1uma\u00f1u 'chewing'. Although some names show reduplication, it can have an onomatopoeic motivation instead of a morphologic one - most names with reduplication are names for animals and birds, in which the phonetic sequence of the reduplication do seem to imitate the sounds characteristic of said animals, for example kurakura 'chicken' or ts\u00f5jts\u00f5j 'colibri bird'. ===Pronouns=== ====Personal Pronouns==== Personal pronouns in the Kano\u00ea language follow a monomorphic free form in the singular and bimorphic in the plural. These pronouns can occur in the subject or object position. The formation of the plural pronouns follow the formula PRO.PL \u2192 PRO.SG + COL, where PRO is the singular form of the pronoun and -COL is the plural morpheme {-te}. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Person ! colspan=\"1\" |Singular ! colspan=\"1\" |Plural |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |Personal pronouns | 1st person | ai || aite |- | 2nd person | mi || mite |- | 3rd person | oj || ojte |- |} For example: {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||aj||ore \u00f5-ry|| e-re |- | ||1SG||tire-1-REFL||DECL-AUX |} :\"I am tired.\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||ajte||ore \u00f5-ry|| e-re |- | ||1PL||tire-1-REFL||DECL-AUX |} :\"We are tired.\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||aj||mi||vara-\u00f5-ro-pe-to||\u00f5-ke-re |- | ||1SG||2SG||speak-1-CLV-2-TRA||1-NEG-DECL-AUX |} :\"I don't speak with you.\" ====Possessive Pronouns==== The form for possessive pronouns are monomorphic in the POSS1SG \u00f1a and POSS2SG pjs but bimorphic for POSS3SG oho which is formed by 3SG oj plus the possessive {-o}. The plural form for the possessive pronouns are formed by adding the suffix {-to} which in itself is the result of the suffixes {-te} plus {-o}. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Person ! colspan=\"2\" |Singular ! colspan=\"2\" |Plural |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |Possessive pronouns | 1st person |\u00f1a || mine||jato||ours |- | 2nd person |pja || yours||pjato||yours |- | 3rd person |ojo || his/hers||ojoto||theirs |- |} For example: {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | ||\u00f1a||i-k\u0268\u0303j||vaj-\u00f5-k\u0268\u0303j|| e-re |- | ||POSS1SG||RN- eye||sting-1-eye||DECL-AUX |} :\"My eye stings.\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||pjato ||kan- te||iriri-\u00f8-ro|| n-e-re |- | ||POSS2PL||child-COL||run-2-CLV ||3-DECL-AUX |} :\"Your children are running.\" ====Demonstrative Pronouns==== There are only two demonstrative pronouns in the Kano\u00ea language, j\u0169, \"this\" for objects in close proximity and \u0169ko, \"that\" for objects at a distance. The demonstrative pronouns do not make a distinction between number or gender. For example: {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||j\u0169||\u00e6vo||ere\u00e3 || k-e-re |- | ||DEM.prox||man||big||NEG-DECL-AUX |} :\"This man is short (lit. This man is not tall).\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||mi||\u0169ko||itev\u00e6 ||pi- paten\u0169-\u00f8-to||k-e-re |- | ||2SG||DEM.dist||people||2-know-3-TRA||NEG-DECL-AUX |} :\"You don't know that man.\" ====Indefinite Pronouns==== There are a total of four indefinite pronouns, which are used based on the object. The nuvi and tsyke pronouns can be used with the gender suffix {-k\u0268\u0303j} for masculine and {-nake} for feminine. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! colspan=\"2\" |For humans ! colspan=\"2\" |For non-humans |- |nuvi || who/someone||naj||something |- |tsyke || someone else||tsake||something else |- |} For Example: {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | ||tsyke -k\u0268\u0303j ||t\u0169-o||e-re |- | ||Someone else-M||die-INTR||DECL-AUX |} :\"Someone else died.\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||oj ||naj||topi-e||u-ro||e-re |- | ||3SG||something||rotten-NZL||eat-CLV||DECL-AUX |} :\"He ate something bad.\" ==Syntax== The Kano\u00ea language is a nominative- accusative language, given that the subjects of both transitive and intransitive verbal actions are marked the same way, while the object is marked differently. For subjects of either intransitive or transitive verbal actions, the suffix {-ro} 'CLV' is added to the verb, and for direct objects of transitive sentences, the suffix {-to} 'TRZ' is added to the verb. For example: {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | a.||kani ||iriri-\u00f8-ro||e-re |- | ||child||run-3-CLV||DECL-AUX |} :\"The child ran.\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | b.||pja ||e||\u00f1a||kani||vara-\u00f8-ro-\u00f8-to||n-e-re |- | ||POSS2SG||woman||POSS1SG||child||speak-3-CLV-3-TRZ||3-DECL-AUX |} :\"Your woman is speaking with my child.\" In example a. it can be seen that the intransitive verb {iriri-} \"run\" takes one subject kani \"child\", and the morpheme {-ro} which attaches the subject as the agent of the verbal action. In example b. the transitive verb {vara-} \"speak\" takes a subject, pja e \"your woman\", which the morpheme {-ro} attaches as the subject of the verbal action; and an object, \u00f1a kani \"my child\", which the morpheme {-to} attaches as the object of the verbal action. Examples a. and b. show that the morphemes for subjects of transitive or intransitive verbal actions are the same. {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | c.||jato ||atiti||ep\u00e6-ro||n-e-re |- | ||POSS1PL||corn||born-3-CLV||3-DECL-AUX |} :lit.\"Our corn is being born.\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | d.||\u00e6vo ||atiti||paj-\u00f8-ro||e-re |- | ||man||corn||break-3-TRZ||DECL-AUX |} :\"The man harvested the corn.\" (lit. \"The man broke the corn\") Comparing examples c. and d. it can be seen that the morpheme {-ro} is used when atiti \"corn\" is the subject of the verbal action, and {-to} is used when atiti \"corn\" is the object of the verbal action. It shows that morphemes for subjects and objects of verbal actions are different. ==Semantics== A field study by Bacelar (2004), shows that there are no inflections for number in the language. even though the Kano\u00ea language uses the pluralizer {-te} to interpret nouns as a collective derived by the suffixation. Mass nouns cannot be pluralized. {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | ||kani || ||kani-te |- | ||child|| ||children |} {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | ||kwini || ||kwini-te |- | ||fish|| ||school of fish |} ===Quantifier=== The most used method to express quantity in the Kano\u00ea language is the anteposition of the quantifier arakere \"many\". It is presumed that the quantifier arakere is formed by a litotes mechanism and that its internal structure follows {ara-} \"few\" + {-k} 'NEG' + {-e} 'DECL' + {-re} 'AUX'. {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | ||kani || ||arakere kani |- | ||child|| ||many children |} {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | ||mapi || ||arakere mapi |- | ||arrow|| ||many arrows |} {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | ||aj ||ara k-e-re||kani||\u00f5-tsi||mo-e-re |- | ||1SG||few-NEG-DECL-AUX||child||1-have||APL-DECL-AUX |} :\"I have many children.\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | ||oj ||tu-kw\u00e6\u0303||ara-t\u0169-kw\u00e6\u0303||k-e-re |- | ||3PL||brother-MASC||few-brother-MASC||NEG-DECL-AUX |} :\"He has many brothers.\" (lit. \"He has not few brothers\") The quantifier arakere can also be used together with numerals to change its meaning to \"few\": {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||mini||aj||[mow-mow||ara k-e||mapi]||\u00f5-tsi||mo-e-re |- | ||today||1SG||two- two||few-NEG-NMZ||arrow||1-have||APL-DECL-AUX |} :\"Today I have only four arrows.\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse\" |- | ||aj||re||\u00f5-e-re||[pja||ara k-e||uromu] |- | ||1SG||kill||1-DECL-AUX||one||few-NEG-NMZ||alligator |} :\"I killed only one alligator.\" The Kano\u00ea language also has an interrogative quantifier n\u1ebdtoe \"how many\" which is used at the beginning of the sentence: {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||n\u1ebdtoe||kani||tuvo||ni-tsi |- | ||how many||child||sick||3-INT |} :\"How many children are sick?\" {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- | ||n\u1ebdtoe||kani||mi||pe-tsi||mi-tsi |- | ||how many||child||2SG||2-have||2-INT |} :\"How many children do you have?\" ==See also== *Macro-Paesan languages ==References== Category:Language isolates of South America Category:Indigenous languages of Western Amazonia Category:Endangered language isolates Category:Endangered indigenous languages of the Americas ",
