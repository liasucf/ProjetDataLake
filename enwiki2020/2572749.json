    "text": "It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown is the 15th prime-time animated television special based on Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts. The subject of the special is Arbor Day, a secular holiday devoted to planting trees. It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown premiered on the CBS network on March 16, 1976, which is near the dates in which most U.S. states observe Arbor Day. This is the first special to feature the character Rerun van Pelt (younger brother to Linus and Lucy), who had debuted in the Peanuts comic strip in March 1973. The musical score features the final compositions and recorded performances of Vince Guaraldi, a jazz pianist whose many contributions to Peanuts include the theme \"Linus and Lucy\". Guaraldi died on February 6, 1976\u2014less than two months before the special's premiere. It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown was distributed as a bonus feature on Paramount Home Video's 2003 DVD-Video release of It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown (1974). A remastered version was published on DVD by Warner Home Video in 2008, and in the DVD box set Peanuts 1970's Collection, Vol. 2 in 2010. ==Plot== Linus repairs his Mother's bike with Charlie Brown watching. Linus's Mother leaves with Rerun on the back seat. Rerun goes through all the places they are set to visit, including the Arbor Day meeting. After Sally Brown is humiliated in class for misunderstanding the purpose of Arbor Day, she is told that she has to write a full report on Arbor day, and Linus goes with her to the library to help her with the report. Linus leaves the library after Sally's repeated attempts to make him fall in love with her. The scene cuts to Charlie Brown and Peppermint Patty talking under a tree. Patty asks Charlie Brown to explain love to her, before she cuts him out several times. She switches the topic to baseball, going over the time her team plays his team, confident that she will win over him every time. Sally, Linus, Lucy, Snoopy and Woodstock decides to plant a lush garden\u2014in Charlie Brown's baseball field, despite Linus's protests. Lucy then calls in the whole team to help with the planting. Charlie Brown is unaware on what is actually going on, and stays at home to work on his team's strategy. The gang informs Charlie Brown that they will name the field Charlie Brown Field, to his happiness. He is shocked to find what has happened to the field when they show him. Charlie Brown tries to make the best of the situation by placing baseball gloves and caps on the trees. The trees catch so many fly outs, Peppermint Patty's team is unable to score, giving Charlie Brown's team the advantage. Schroeder tells Lucy that he will kiss her if she hits a home run. To Schroeder's surprise and Charlie Brown's delight, Lucy hits the home run and scores the first run of the game. Moments later, Charlie Brown's joy turns to anguish as the game is rained out in a huge storm ruining the chance of his team winning their first game. At school the next day, Sally gives a successful report on the true meaning of Arbor Day. Meanwhile, Peppermint Patty speaks kindly to a discouraged Charlie Brown, she compliments the garden in Charlie Brown Field and wishes him \"Happy Arbor Day\", cheering him up. ==Cast== (Marcie, Franklin, Violet, and Patty appear in the film, but have no lines.) ==Credits== * Written and Created by: Charles M.

The special recycles animated sequences from Snoopy, Come Home (1972), There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown (1973), A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving (1973), and You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown (1975). ==Music score== It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown was the last Peanuts special to feature original music composed by Vince Guaraldi (except where noted), who was best known for the Peanuts' signature tune, \"Linus and Lucy.\" 47-year-old Guaraldi died suddenly several hours after completing the soundtrack for this special. The end credits include a dedication: \"For Vince!!!\" With the untimely death of Guaraldi, later Peanuts animated specials lack the same jazzy musical score as previous entries. As such, It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown is seen by some fans as the swan song of the \"golden era\" of Peanuts animation. In addition, it was the first Peanuts special since Charlie Brown's All Stars! (1966) that was not conducted and arranged by John Scott Trotter, who had died on October 29, 1975. Guaraldi recorded most of the music score in January 1976 at Wally Heider Studios, working as a trio with bassist Seward McCain and drummer Jim Zimmerman. Several cues contained elements of previously used songs \"Baseball Theme,\" \"Rain, Rain Go Away\" and \"Joe Cool\". The special's main theme \u2014 a gentle waltz that incorporates elements of \"Christmas Time Is Here\" \u2014 is heard repeatedly throughout, going by several different titles as they pertain to a specific scene. All music cues were composed by Guaraldi and performed by the Vince Guaraldi Trio. #\"Rerun's Lament\" #\"Eighty-Nine Bottles of Beer\" (vocal) (Traditional) #\"Rerun's Lament\" #\"Ships Sail into Arbor\" #\"Laughter in the Library\" (variation of \"Christmas Time Is Here\") #\"Flatten Platten\" (variation of \"Baseball Theme\") #\"Young Man's Fancy\" #\"Jay Sterling Morton Jazz\" (variation of \"Christmas Time Is Here\") #\"We're the Visiting Team\" (variation of \"Christmas Time Is Here\") #\"Seeds for Thought\" (variation of \"Joe Cool\") #\"Don't Forget the Shovel\" (variation of \"Christmas Time Is Here\") #\"Sprinkle Your Bird\" (variation of \"Baseball Theme\") #\"Flatten Platten\" (version 2) #\"Snoopy at Bat\" #\"Lucy's Home Run\" #\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" (vocal) (Jack Norworth, Albert Von Tilzer) #\"Lucy's Home Run\" #\"Rain, Gentle Rain\" (variation of \"Rain, Rain, Go Away\") #\"Happy Arbor Day, Charlie Brown\" #\"Lucy's Home Run\" (reprise, end credits) No official soundtrack for It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown was commercially released. However, New Age pianist George Winston covered \"Young Man's Fancy\" and the opening portion of \"Sprinkle Your Bird\" (mistitled \"Seeds for Thought\") on his Guaraldi tribute albums, Linus and Lucy: The Music of Vince Guaraldi (1996) and Love Will Come: The Music of Vince Guaraldi, Volume 2 (2010), respectively. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Animated television specials Category:CBS television specials Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Television programs directed by Phil Roman Category:1970s American television specials Category:1976 television specials Category:1976 in American television Category:Baseball animation Category:American baseball films Category:Holiday fiction ",
