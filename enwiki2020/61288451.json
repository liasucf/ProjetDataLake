    "text": "Noam (, lit., Pleasantness) is an Orthodox Jewish, Religious Zionist, right- wing political party in Israel, established in July 2019 by a very conservative faction in the Religious Zionist community inspired by Rabbi Zvi Thau and his Har Hamor Yeshiva. The party's main goal is to advance policies against LGBT rights, and against what its backers call \"the destruction of the family\". ==History== The party's basis is in Rabbi Zvi Thau and his Har Hamor Yeshiva. Rabbi Thau and his followers believe that HaBayit HaYehudi, led by Rabbi Rafi Peretz, and Tkuma, led by Bezalel Smotrich, have not sufficiently advanced Jewish values \u2013 particularly in the realm of opposition to LGBT rights, protection of the Shabbat as a day of rest, and the protection of the Orthodox conversion process. Following Rabbi Thau's disappointment with the parties of the Union of the Right-Wing Parties, he and his followers decided to form the Noam party. While Rabbi Thau is the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Dror Aryeh is the political leader of the party. Another student of Thau that is involved in the creation of the party is Rabbi Shlomo Aviner. He said that: \"The party will fight against the destruction of the family, against the destruction of conversion, against the destruction of Shabbat, against the destruction of the Western Wall, and against the use of deviant content in the IDF and the Education Ministry.\" The Noam party was reported to be in talks with the Otzma Yehudit party, which split recently from the United Right, for a possible joint run. In 2015, Otzma Yehudit allied itself with the Yachad party of former Shas chief Eli Yishai, running on a joint ticket for the 2015 Israeli legislative election. Rabbi Thau endorsed the joint ticket, marking the first time the Har Hamor dean had explicitly endorsed a political party. On 28 July, Noam and Otzma Yehudit agreed to run on a joint list for the September 2019 Israeli legislative election. The agreement between Noam and Otzma Yehudit was dissolved on 1 August because Noam disagreed with Otzma having secular Jewish candidates. Noam filed its list independently of any other party, though it withdrew from the race on 15 September. ==Controversy== The party released a homophobic video under the comment: \"An entire country is going through conversion therapy. The time has come to stop it.\" In the video, a mother, father, and son go to vote on election day in September, and the family is \"bombarded\" with LGBT and Reform imagery. Once they reach the voting booth, the mother writes on her voting slip, \"Let my son marry a woman\", while the father writes, \"Let my grandson be Jewish\". The video was removed by YouTube for violating its terms of use. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Political parties in Israel Category:Religious Zionist political parties in Israel Category:Orthodox Jewish political parties Category:Chardal Category:Conservative parties in Israel Category:Social conservative parties Category:Far-right political parties in Israel Category:2019 establishments in Israel Category:Political parties established in 2019 Category:Organizations that oppose LGBT rights ",
