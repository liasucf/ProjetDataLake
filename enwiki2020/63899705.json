    "text": "Interurbano Line (), is a commuter railway line in Costa Rica, operated by the national public railway operator Incofer. The line connects the provinces of Alajuela, Heredia, San Jos\u00e9 and Cartago. == History == Costa Rica had two main lines for freight and passenger transportation, the Pacific line (between San Jos\u00e9 and Puntarenas) and the Atlantic line (between Alajuela, through Heredia and San Jos\u00e9 to Lim\u00f3n), both of which converge in the San Jos\u00e9 canton, with the eponymous terminus station of each line a mere 2 kilometer apart, which are connected by rail. Between 1993 and 1995 a brief passenger service made use of the tracks, but it was not enough to keep Incofer working, as the institution have been running in a deficit for a long time, for which it was technically closed in 1995. Incofer then recreated the Interurbano as a commuter single line making use of this available infrastructure. The initial trail line was between Pavas and Montes de Oca, in 2005. In 2008 the announcement of extending the line to Heredia started works on cleaning up the old line, trial runs were executed with derails being common, the initial service of the current rebooted Interurbano was between the Atl\u00e1ntico station and Heredia station, which started on 2009. New rolling stock from Spain, the Apolo 2400 units, were imported in 2009. === Future === There are plans to reconstruct the whole passenger line with an electric railroad, including elevated segments to improve the vehicular road flow, with forty six stations (five would be elevated, the remaining thirty seven on ground level), and service every three to five minutes, under the (Fast Passenger Transportation System) project. ====Stage Zero of Electrification==== New plans to electrify the passenger lines are in place, beginning with a \"Stage Zero\" which means to start with new more efficient diesel powered rolling stock. These eight new units were ordered to the company CRRC Qingdao Sifang from China, they will have more space and the seats are arranged along the walls of the units, a first in the country. With the new units it will be possible to extend and provide the service to Para\u00edso, Cartago and San Rafael, Alajuela. A projected start date for a bidirectional electric railway line is set for around the year 2025, with bidding offers starting in 2022. == Line data == The line is operated at street level, which makes it difficult to achieve an optimum speed due to frequent encounters with busy streets, at average the speed is at about . From its reopening the train crossings at street level didn't have barriers, bells or any other security measure, accidents between the train and cars are common, as well as accidents with pedestrians, in 2018 security measures were installed at 45 crossings, with plans to grow to 136, but vandalism and accidents against the barriers are common. == Services == There are three services running on the Interurbano line, all of them use the same rolling stock interchangeably, and the range of a service might include part of another. There is no express services, all stops are served. ===Cartago=== Making use of the old railroad line to the Atlantic, but finishing in Los \u00c1ngeles neighborhood, Cartago, as of October 2019, with plans to continue towards Para\u00edso. Shaded stops are only served at rush hour. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Name !! Distance !! Station Type !! Other services !!
