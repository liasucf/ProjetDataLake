    "text": "In Greek mythology, the Sons of Aegyptus were the fifty progeny of the king of Egypt, Aegyptus. They married their cousins, the fifty daughters of Danaus, twin brother of Aegyptus. In the most common version of the myth, they were all killed except one, Lynceus, who was saved by his wife Hypermnestra on their wedding night. == Apollodorus == The list in the BibliothecaPseudo- Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, Book 2.1.5 preserves not only the names of brides and grooms, but also those of their mothers. A lot was cast among the sons of Aegyptus to decide which of the Danaids each should marry except for those daughters born to Memphis who were joined by their namesakes, the sons of Tyria. According to Hippostratus, Aegyptus had these progeny by a single woman called Eurryroe, daughter of Nilus.John Tzetzes.
