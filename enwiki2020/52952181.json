    "text": "Patrick Brian Murphy (born June 10, 1995) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is ranked 21st on MLB's 2020 Top 30 Blue Jays prospects list. ==Career== Murphy attended Hamilton High School in his hometown of Chandler, Arizona. In 2012, he underwent Tommy John surgery, and missed the entire 2013 season as a result. He had committed to attend the University of Oregon before being selected in the third round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. He signed with the Blue Jays for a $500,000 bonus, and reported to Dunedin, Florida for rehab. Murphy made his professional debut with the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League Blue Jays in 2014. After pitching four innings, he was shut down with hand and arm numbness. It was later determined that one of his ribs was pinching a nerve, and underwent surgery to remove the rib shortly afterward. The numbness persisted, which led doctors to remove a nerve in his pitching elbow, which caused him to miss the entire 2015 season. Fully healthy for 2016, Murphy split time between the Short Season-A Vancouver Canadians and the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts. He made 21 appearances during the 2016 season, 15 of which were starts, and posted a 4\u20136 win\u2013loss record, 3.18 earned run average (ERA), and 68 strikeouts in 90 innings pitched. Murphy made most of his appearances in 2017 for Lansing, and also played in the GCL and for the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays. In total he went 5\u20134 with a 3.04 ERA and 77 strikeouts in 106 innings. The Blue Jays added Murphy to their 40-man roster after the 2018 season. On September 18, 2020, the Blue Jays promoted Murphy to the major leagues for the first time, and he made his debut against the Philadelphia Phillies. With the 2020 Toronto Blue Jays, Murphy appeared in 4 games, compiling a 0-0 record with 1.50 ERA and 5 strikeouts in 6.0 innings pitched.https://www.mlb.com/player/patrick-murphy-641907 ==References== ==External links== Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Chandler, Arizona Category:Baseball players from Arizona Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:Gulf Coast Blue Jays players Category:Vancouver Canadians players Category:Lansing Lugnuts players Category:Dunedin Blue Jays players Category:New Hampshire Fisher Cats players ",
