War Horse, a theatrical production seen by nearly eight million people, features horse puppets designed and created by Handspring Puppet Company. == History == Jones and Kohler met at the Michaelis School of Fine Art in Cape Town. At first, they designed puppets for children- targeted productions, which Jones initially disliked. Kohler \"introduced him [Jones] to the West African tradition of puppetry for adults,\" working with Malcolm Purkey and Barney Simon, among others. == Productions == Some notable productions include: === Episodes of an Easter Rising === Esther van Ryswyk directed Episodes of an Easter Rising (1985), based on David Lytton's radio special of the same name. It told the story of how two white lesbian women became part of South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle. It premiered at the Baxter Theatre in Cape Town and toured to the National Arts Festival in Makhanda (formerly Grahamstown), WITS University Theatre in Johannesburg and to the 7th World Festival of Puppet Theatre in Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, France. === Ubu and the Truth Commission === In 1997, they worked with William Kentridge (director) and Jane Taylor (scriptwriter) on Ubu and the Truth Commission. The play draws extensively on Alfred Jarry's absurdist production Ubu Roi (1896). It fuses the chaos of the Ubu legend with original testimony from witnesses at the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). It highlights Kentridge's work in the evolution of truth through a combination of fictional narratives and facts.The world premiere of Ubu and the Truth Commission followed on 17 June 1997, at the Kunsfest in Weimar. The production premiered in Weimer Germany on 17 June 1997. Over the next two years, it toured to 38 theatres in South Africa, Europe and the USA. === Tall Horse === Tall Horse was a collaboration between the Sogolon Puppet Troupe of Mali and Handspring Puppet Company. The production has its roots in history \u2013 in 1827 the Pasha of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, sent a giraffe as a gift to King Charles X of France. The play dramatised the giraffe's journey across the Mediterranean Sea and the politics underlying it. With initial funding from the John F. Kennedy Centre in Washington, D.C, Tall Horse was further funded by Anglo Gold Ashanti, a mining company with interests in both Mali and South Africa.\"Tall Horse\" . Handsrping Puppet Company === War Horse === The maquette for Joey from the National Theatre production. The puppets were made by the Handspring Puppet Company. This scale model was a gift to writer Sir Michael Morpurgo, author of War Horse. The Handspring Puppet Company achieved critical acclaim when War Horse premiered at the Royal National Theatre in South Bank, London, on 17 October 2007.\"War Horse\" ltdb.co.uk, accessed 20 January 2010. Kohler and Jones worked with directors Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris and choreographer Toby Sedgwick to design and construct life-sized horse puppets, controlled by three actors. Two actors operate the legs and a third controls the head and neck, with all three actors providing a variety of sound effects. The company won an Olivier Award, Evening Standard Theatre Award and London Critics' Circle Theatre Award.\"Hairspray Wins Four 2008 Laurence Olivier Awards Including Best Musical\" playbill.com\"Evening Standard nominations \u2013 2007\" holidayextras.co.uk The show transferred to the West End on 28 March 2009,\"'War Horse' Opens In The West End 3/28/09\" broadwayworld.com, 8 December 2008 and on 15 March 2011, it premiered on Broadway at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.
