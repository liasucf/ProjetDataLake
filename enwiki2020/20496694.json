    "text": "Wu Hsing-kuo () is a Taiwanese actor of the silver screen and theater, known for both his performance of complex movie roles as much as for his innovative adaptations of Western classics into traditional Peking Opera. Wu was trained in classical Peking Opera since the age of 11 in Taiwan's state-run Fu-Hsing Chinese Opera School, specializing in wu sheng (male martial) roles. He was admitted with honors into the Theatre Department of Chinese Culture University in Taipei, trained under master Chou Cheng-jung (Zhou Zheng-rong) and became the leading dancer of Lin Hwai-min's Cloud Gate Dance Theater. However, his teacher Chou Cheng-jung (Zhou Zheng-rong) considered him as a pretentious student who didn't focus on study and finally abandoned him in 1989. Since then, Chou Cheng-jung (died in 2000) never met him anymore. In addition, most of the traditional Chinese opera audiences do not recognize him as a qualified actor. In 1986, he and a group of enthusiastic friends founded the in Taipei, seeking to revitalize traditional Chinese theatre by adapting Western classical plays to the style and techniques of Peking Opera. He was the leading actor and director of four Shakespeare adaptations, including the critically acclaimed Kingdom of Desire (\u617e\u671b\u57ce\u570b), an adaptation of Macbeth, and King Lear (\u674e\u723e\u5728\u6b64), in which Wu plays all the parts. In 1992, Wu was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study in New York with Richard Schechner. That year, he also won the Hong Kong Film Award for best new actor. Wu is currently artistic director of the Contemporary Legend Theatre, and continues to take on challenging roles in both the modern theatre and Chinese Opera. He crosses the fields of traditional opera, dance, modern theatre, cinema, and television. ==Filmography== ===Films=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Year !English title !Original title !Role !class=\"unsortable\"|Notes |- |rowspan=3|1993||colspan=2|18||Weirdo|| |- |Temptation of a Monk||\u8a98\u50e7||Shi Yansheng|| |- |Green Snake||\u9752\u86c7||Xu Xian|| |- |rowspan=6|1994||The Great Conqueror's Concubine||\u897f\u695a\u9738\u738b||Yu Ziqi|| |- |Rock N'Roll Cop||\u7701\u6e2f\u4e00\u865f\u901a\u7ddd\u72af||Wong Kun|| |- |Right Here Waiting...||\u7b49\u611b\u7684\u5973\u4eba||Dickson Koo|| |- |God of Gamblers Return||\u8ced\u795e\uff12||Chao Siu-chi||| |- |What Price Survival||\u7368\u81c2\u5200\u4e4b\u60c5||Wang Ning|| |- |Red Rose White Rose||\u7d05\u73ab\u7470\u767d\u73ab\u7470|||| |- |1996||Shanghai Grand||\u65b0\u4e0a\u6d77\u7058||Fung King- yiu|| |- |1997||The Soong Sisters||\u5b8b\u5bb6\u7687\u671d||Chiang Kai-shek|| |- |2000||Comeuppance||\u5929\u6709\u773c|||| |- |2001||The Accidental Spy||\u7279\u52d9\u8ff7\u57ce||Lee Sang-zen|| |- |2009||Who Rules Over the Destiny of China||\u8ab0\u4e3b\u6c89\u6d6e||Chiang Kai-shek|| |- |2011||Four Hands||\u9eb5\u5f15\u5b50||Sun Hou-cheng|| |- |2012||Love on Gallery Bridge||\u7231\u5728\u5eca\u6865||Lin Changtian|| |} ===TV series=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Year !English title !Original title !Role !class=\"unsortable\"|Notes |- |rowspan=2|1996||Love, Sword, Mountain & River||\u60c5\u528d\u5c71\u6cb3||Zhao Kuangyin|| |- |The Story of the President||\u7e3d\u7d71\u7684\u6545\u4e8b||Lee Teng-hui|| |- |1997||China at War||\u70fd\u706b\u4e2d\u570b|||| |- |rowspan=2|1999||Holiday||\u5047\u671f||Chu Chen-hsiang|| |- |Dangerous Games||\u5371\u9669\u6e38\u620f||Guan Luochuan|| |- |2000||Tiger's Tenderness||\u8001\u864e\u7684\u6eab\u67d4||Huang Ho- chun|| |- |2001||Master Swordsman Lu Xiaofeng||\u9678\u5c0f\u9cf3\u4e4b\u6c7a\u6230\u524d\u5f8c||Ye Gucheng|| |- |2003||Flaming Romance||\u5929\u547d\u56e0\u7de3||Su Jifei|| |- |2005||Lovelorn High Heels||\u5931\u6200\u9ad8\u8ddf\u978b||Ma Ta-cheng|| |- |2006||To Live to Love||\u957f\u6068\u6b4c||Li Puzhi|| |} ==Awards== * Awarded Best New Performer at the Hong Kong Film Awards in (1992). * Nominated for Best Actor at the 13th Hong Kong Film Awards (1994) for his role in Temptation of a Monk ==External links== * * * HK cinemagic entry Category:Taiwanese male film actors Category:Living people Category:1953 births Category:Male actors from Kaohsiung Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:Taiwanese male television actors Category:Taiwanese male Peking opera actors Category:21st-century Taiwanese male actors Category:20th-century Taiwanese male actors Category:Chinese Culture University alumni Category:21st-century male singers Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century Taiwanese singers Category:20th-century Taiwanese singers ",
