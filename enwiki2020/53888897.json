Some sources stated his nationality was a Portuguese Guinean (now Bissau Guinean or Guinea-Bissauan) He was influenced with one of the earliest recorded writers of colonial Cape Verde especially poets including Eug\u00e9nio Tavares and others including Jos\u00e9 Lopes da Silva of S\u00e3o Nicolau. He later moved to the colonial (now national) capital Praia where he wrote several books and poems especially of the classical-romantic related themes. In 1933, he published a work related to Cape Verdean folklore titled Folclore Caboverdiano which included traditional stories and music. His works would later be influenced in other works including poetry and short stories, these also appeared in the magazine-review Claridade published from 1936 to 1960. He died in the colonial capital Praia in 1942 at the age of 53, the cause was unknown but was probably cancer. ==Legacy== His poem \"Nha Cod\u00ea\" was made into song by the music group Simentera in the album Raiz (1992) ==Selected works== *Folclore Caboverdiano [Cape Verdean Folklore] (1933) *Selected works in O Manduco *\"Nha Cod\u00ea\" *Claridade - selected works in the magazine ==See also== *List of Cape Verdeans: writers section ==Notes== ==References== *The first version of the article is translated and is based from the article at the French Wikipedia (Main Page) ==Further reading== * Manuel Veiga, Insularit\u00e9 et litt\u00e9rature aux \u00eeles du Cap-Vert, Karthala, Paris, 1997, p. 116, * Eug\u00e9nio Tavares, Litt\u00e9ratures lusophones des archipels atlantiques : A\u00e7ores, Mad\u00e8re, Cap-Vert, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe [Lusophony Literature in the Atlantic Archipelagoes: Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe], L'Harmattan, 2009, p. 294 ==External links== *Pedro Monteiro Cardoso at Manduco - Ilha do Fogo: Cultura, Gentes e Vivencias Category:1890 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Cape Verdean poets Category:Cape Verdean writers Category:People from Fogo, Cape Verde Category:20th-century poets ",
