The Kingdom is split politically into two different states due to the creation of Nigerian states. The town of Ofiniama (corrupted to Ofunama) is the first settlement from where all others took off from. The Egbema have a strong Ijaw cultural identity, despite their location on the western fringe of Ijawland. The Kingdom traces its origins to several migrations from the Mein, Iduwini, and Ekeremor tribes centuries ago. Egbema tribe is under the overlordship of the Agadagba of Egbema Kingdom, Pere Gold O.E. Tiemo (JP) The Kingdom is made up of nine major towns (clans) better known as the \"Egbema Isenabiri\".
