He grew through the ferment of Roman avant-garde theatre, both as an actor and backstage, developing \u2013 at the same time \u2013 a strong interest in animation and special/optical effects for film making. Since 1980 he thus experimented filmmaking riding the transition from traditional to digital imaging, producing several works mixing analogical and numerical techniques in film and multivision. In the same years he started applying elements of technical and industrial design to the field of arts, focusing on the relation between art and science and collaborating on several projects of kinetic and scientific art. As film director he directed several documentaries and three short movies before making his first feature film Sembra morto ma... \u00e8 solo svenuto in 1986, written with Gianni Di Gregorio and Sergio Castellitto, who is also the protagonist.
