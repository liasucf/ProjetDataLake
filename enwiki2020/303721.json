    "text": "Carolina Evelyn Kl\u00fcft (; born 2 February 1983) is a retired Swedish track and field athlete who competed in the heptathlon, triple jump, long jump, and pentathlon. She was an Olympic Champion, having won the heptathlon title in 2004. She was also a three-time World and two-time European heptathlon champion. She is the only athlete ever to win three consecutive world titles in the heptathlon (2003, 2005, 2007), and was unbeaten in 22 heptathlon and pentathlon competitions from 2002 to 2007, winning nine consecutive gold medals in major championships. Kl\u00fcft first rose to prominence by winning the heptathlon at the 2002 European Championships and setting a new world junior record of 6,542 points. She then won the 2003 World Championships, becoming the third athlete ever to score over 7,000 points. She is the European record holder for heptathlon with a personal best of 7,032 points. This score ranks her second on the all-time heptathlon points score list, behind Jackie Joyner- Kersee who set the world record of 7,291 points. Besides having been a world class heptathlete, Kl\u00fcft also had international success in the long jump event. She won the bronze medal at the 2004 World Indoor Championships in Budapest and finished fourth at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu. On 2 September 2012 at the Finland-Sweden Athletics International, Kl\u00fcft officially ended her career and retired from sports. ==Personal life and profile== Born in Sandhult, V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, Kl\u00fcft grew up in V\u00e4xj\u00f6, where her father, mother and three sisters still live. She currently lives in Norrk\u00f6ping together with her husband Patrik Kl\u00fcft, who is a former pole vaulter. They were married in September 2007 at Crichton Parish Church in Midlothian, Scotland. Kl\u00fcft comes from a family with sporting traditions: her father Johnny played professional football in the Swedish Allsvenskan and her mother was an international long jumper. She started out playing football herself but took up athletics at the age of twelve. She has described being subjected to bullying at school after moving to V\u00e4xj\u00f6 and subsequently using her athletic prowess to gain respect. Kl\u00fcft took up the heptathlon in 2000 after coach Agne Bergvall suggested she had a future in it. Bergvall has been her main coach ever since. Kl\u00fcft is 1.78 m (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 65 kg (140 lb / 10.2 stone). Her physique is well-suited to multi-events: she is tall and lean for the running and jumping events but also powerful enough to perform well in the shot put and javelin. She has shown more natural ability in the jumping events, sprinting and hurdles, and has steadily improved in the throwing events and 800 m and has now been described as having no weaknesses across the seven events. This is demonstrated by her finishing in the top six in all disciplines of the 2007 World Championship heptathlon.2007 World Championship results She is also a member of the Swedish 4 \u00d7 100 m relay team at international competitions, and was part of the team that set the national record. She is particularly friendly with British rival Kelly Sotherton, and the two can often be seen chatting during competitions. Kl\u00fcft regularly leads the other heptathletes on a lap of honor after a major competition. She is often referred to by the nickname 'Carro' by people who know her. When not training or competing, Kl\u00fcft is a student at the Linnaeus University, studying Peace and Development. She visited areas of Sri Lanka hit by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake to make a film for Swedish TVPlan Sri Lanka and also sponsors children in Africa. She is part of Reebok's \"I am what I am\" advertising campaign along with several other sports stars.Carolina Kluft, I am what I am She has been the focus of poster photography for Reebok, taken by celebrity photographer Jason Bell.Extraordinary performances in an ordinary world Kl\u00fcft was nominated for four consecutive Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year awards from 2005\u20132008.Carolina Kluft: Laureus profile She has a mascot, a small stuffed toy representing Eeyore, that she takes everywhere. Kl\u00fcft claims that this is not for luck, but to remind her of her philosophy that sport is for fun. She is one of very few athletes to at some time hold all five available international titles: Olympic, World Outdoor, Regional (Europe in her case) Outdoor, World Indoor and Regional Indoor. ==Career== ===2002=== Kl\u00fcft was an exceptional junior athlete. During the 2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics, at the age of 19, she set a world junior record by scoring 6,470 points. She captured her first major championship title at the 2002 European Championships in Munich with a score of 6,542 points, improving the world junior record in the process. ===2003=== A score of 4933 points secured the pentathlon title at the 2003 World Indoor Championships. Kl\u00fcft followed this with personal bests and victories in the heptathlons in G\u00f6tzis and Tallinn. She won her first major outdoor title, the heptathlon at the 2003 World Championships in Paris with a score of 7,001 points, ahead of Eunice Barber, who had 6,755 points. Kl\u00fcft thus became the third woman ever to break the 7,000-point barrier in the heptathlon. She set six personal bests in the seven disciplines including a 1.94 m high jump and a 200 m run of 22.98 s. At one stage she was on the brink of elimination from the competition after overstepping on the first two of her three long jump attempts but ended up recording the best jump of the competition with 6.68 m. She was later awarded the Waterford Crystal European Athlete of the Year Trophy 2003. That same year, Kl\u00fcft also received the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal. ===2004=== Kl\u00fcft competed in the long jump at the 2004 World Indoor Championships, winning a bronze medal with a national record of 6.92 m.

She also entered the long jump, qualifying for the final but finishing 11th. ===2005=== She began 2005 by winning the pentathlon at the European Indoor Championships with a new personal best of 4948 points. A third consecutive victory at G\u00f6tzis and another in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 set Kl\u00fcft up for the defense of her heptathlon world title. The day before the 2005 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki, Kl\u00fcft injured her foot. The injury affected her performance, particularly in the high jump which was a clearance of only 1.82 m. Kl\u00fcft fell well behind Eunice Barber but made a comeback with a personal best shot put of 15.02 m and then took the lead after the 200 m. She then stretched her lead with a long jump effort of 6.87 m, and held on to an advantage of only 18 points after the javelin. She overtook Barber at the end of the 800 m to retain the title. Kl\u00fcft totaled 6,887 points, finishing ahead of Barber who took the silver medal with 6,824 points. ===2006=== Kl\u00fcft chose not to compete at the 2006 World Indoor Championships in order to prepare for the European Championships, to be staged on home soil in Sweden. Kl\u00fcft won again in G\u00f6tzis and in Arles. She defended her title at the 2006 European Athletics Championships with a score of 6,740 points, despite having been hampered by injuries throughout her preparation.

Still recovering from her fitness problems of the previous year, she did only one heptathlon before the World Championships, a fifth victory in G\u00f6tzis. At the World Championships in Osaka, Kl\u00fcft had the opportunity to become the only woman to win three world titles in the heptathlon. However, she faced strong competition from Lyudmila Blonska of Ukraine, who had, earlier in the year, set the world best heptathlon score of 2007. Kl\u00fcft started the first day by equaling her personal best of 13.15s in the 100 m Hurdles and a new personal best of 1.95 m in the high jump. Solid performances of 14.81 in the shot put and 23.38 in the 200 m followed, for Kl\u00fcft to hold the lead from Blonska after day one, with 4162 points. On the second day, Kl\u00fcft recorded a long jump of 6.85 m, threw 47.98 m in the javelin and ran 2:12.56 in the 800 metres to claim her third World Championship gold.

Kl\u00fcft narrowly won the competition after setting an indoor personal best of 52.98 in the 400 m. Kelly Sotherton finished just 18 points behind Kl\u00fcft, beating the Swede in both the hurdles and 400 m. On 22 February, Kl\u00fcft announced that she had ruptured her hamstring and that, as a result, she would not compete at the World Indoor Championships on 7 March.European Athletics \u2013 Injured Kl\u00fcft will not compete in Valencia Kl\u00fcft announced on 19 March 2008 that she would not contest any heptathlons in 2008, including defending her title at the Olympics, stating that she was no longer motivated to train for and compete in heptathlons. Instead she decided to concentrate upon long jump and also train seriously for triple jump. Although Kl\u00fcft was inexperienced in triple jump, she had worked with Yannick Tregaro (coach of Olympic champion Christian Olsson), who predicted that she could jump over 14.50 m.European Athletics \u2013 Kl\u00fcft to take on Triple Jump in Beijing She entered both the long jump and triple jump at the 2008 Olympics. Her best effort of 13.90 m did not qualify her for the triple jump final. She ended ninth in the long jump with a result of 6.49 m. Although Kl\u00fcft did not defend her heptathlon title at the Beijing Olympics, she stated that she might yet contest another heptathlon, after the 2008 season. ===2009=== Kl\u00fcft missed the 2009 World Championships in Berlin as well as the rest of the season after suffering a hamstring injury she picked up in July in Sweden. She had surgery in the middle of July, after which she needed around six months rehabilitation. ===2010=== Kl\u00fcft competed in the 2010 European Championships in Barcelona, reaching the long jump final but ultimately finishing 11th out of the twelve athletes that reached the final. She jumped 6.33 metres but was almost 60 centimetres behind gold medalist Ineta Rad\u0113vi\u010da of Latvia. Kl\u00fcft said she \"didn't have any power in my legs\" and \"my legs felt heavy today\" after qualifying for the final. She also stated that reaching the final had satisfied her. ===2011=== The long jump at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu would be Kl\u00fcft's last major championship start. After a qualifying 6.60 m jump, Kl\u00fcft only managed 6.56 m in the final. The result was still enough to secure fourth place, but Kl\u00fcft was 18 cm behind Belarusian Nastassia Mironchyk-Ivanova who claimed the bronze medal. ==Timeline of multi-event championship performances== *2000 Junior World Champion Heptathlon *2001 Junior European Champion Heptathlon *2002 European Indoor Bronze Medalist Pentathlon (last event she's lost to date) *2002 Junior World Champion Heptathlon (defending), World Junior Record *2002 European Champion Heptathlon, current World Junior Record *2003 World Indoor Champion Pentathlon *2003 World Champion Heptathlon, 3rd female past 7,000 points *2004 Olympic Champion Heptathlon *2005 European Indoor Champion Pentathlon *2005 World Champion Heptathlon (defending) *2006 European Champion Heptathlon (defending), championship record *2007 European Indoor Champion Pentathlon (defending) *2007 World Champion Heptathlon (defending), European record ==International medals== ===Heptathlon=== *Olympic Games **2004 \u2013 6,952 p \u2013 Gold *World Championships **2003 \u2013 7,001 p \u2013 Gold **2005 \u2013 6,887 p \u2013 Gold **2007 \u2013 7,032 p \u2013 Gold *European Championships **2002 \u2013 6,542 p \u2013 Gold **2006 \u2013 6,740 p \u2013 Gold *World Junior Championships **2000 \u2013 6,056 p \u2013 Gold **2002 \u2013 6,470 p \u2013 Gold *European Junior Championships **2001 \u2013 6,022 p \u2013 Gold ===Long jump=== *World Indoor Championships **2004 \u2013 6.92 m \u2013 Bronze *European U23 Championships **2003 \u2013 6.86 m \u2013 Gold **2005 \u2013 6.79 m \u2013 Gold ===Pentathlon=== *World Indoor Championships **2003 \u2013 4,933 p \u2013 Gold *European Indoor Championships **2002 \u2013 4,535 p \u2013 Bronze **2005 \u2013 4,948 p \u2013 Gold **2007 \u2013 4,944 p \u2013 Gold ==International awards== *Waterford Crystal European Athlete of the Year Trophy 2003 and 2006 ==Personal bests== {| class=wikitable style=\"width:400px;\" |- !Event !!Indoor !!Outdoor |- |4 \u00d7 100 metres relay||||43.61 s (NR) |- |4 \u00d7 400 metres relay||||3:31.28 min |- |60 metres||7.40 s|| |- |60 metres hurdles||8.19 s|| |- |100 metres||||11.48 s |- |100 metres hurdles||||13.15 s |- |200 metres||24.12 s||22.98 s |- |400 metres||52.98 s||53.17 s |- |800 metres||2:13:04 min||2:08.89 min |- |Heptathlon||||7,032 p (European record) |- |High jump||1.93 m||1.95 m |- |Javelin throw||||50.96 m |- |Long jump||6.92 m (NR)||6.97 m |- |Pentathlon||4,948 p (NR) |- |Shot put||14.48 m||15.05 m |- |Triple jump||||14.29 m (NR) |} ==References== ==External links== *SPIKES Hero profile on www.spikesmag.com * * * * *Carolina Kl\u00fcft in European Athletics Championships Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bor\u00e5s Municipality Category:Swedish heptathletes Category:Swedish female long jumpers Category:Swedish female triple jumpers Category:Olympic athletes of Sweden Category:Olympic gold medalists for Sweden Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:European Athlete of the Year winners Category:World Athletics Indoor Championships winners Category:World Athletics Championships winners ",
