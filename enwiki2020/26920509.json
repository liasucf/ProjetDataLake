A cross-generational family story barely longer than a novella, it possesses the light tug of menace and almost invisible haze of tension that characterise Hill's ghost stories, yet there is nothing supernatural about this tale of a farming family grounded in the seasons. The slippery nature of memory is what casts an atmosphere of unease over the novel\".Real and imagined terrors: Invented family traumas add menace to Susan Hill's near-perfect novel Joanna Briscoe, The Guardian, Saturday 18 October 2008 *Laura Thompson in The Telegraph writes \"this short book is richly satisfying. Hill's craftsmanship is masterly. We are always aware of the farming backdrop: the book begins with a superb evocation of rural hardship, whose inexorable rhythms read like pared-down Thomas Hardy.\" and goes on to describe it as \"a little masterpiece\".Laura Thompson reviews a magnificent novella about the riddles wrapped up in two enigmas, The Telegraph, 23 Oct 2008. *The Times said it was \"a moving, evocative and rewarding novel\".The Beacon: Amazon.co.uk: Susan Hill: Books Retrieved 2012-06-04. ==Radio Dramatisation== The novel was dramatised for BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour Drama, broadcast in five 15-minute episodes from March 22\u201326, 2010.Dramatisation of the novel by Susan Hill examining the effect of the publication of a 'misery memoir' on the family who are its subject Retrieved 2010-04-11. ==Publication history== *2008, UK, Chatto & Windus, , Pub date 02 Oct 2008, Hardback *2009, UK, Vintage Books, , Pub date 01 Oct 2009, Paperback www.fantasticfiction.co.uk Retrieved 2012-11-19. ==References== ==External links== *Author webpage *Truth, lies and misery lit review by Katy Guest in The Independent *Terrors of the imagination review by Paul Binding in The Spectator *A twisted tale of malice aforethought, review by Nicholas Lezard in The Guardian *Vintage books webpage Category:Novels by Susan Hill Category:Family saga novels Category:2008 British novels Category:Chatto & Windus books ",
