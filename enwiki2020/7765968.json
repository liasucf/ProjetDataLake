    "text": "River Arney near BellanaleckThe Arney River is a small river in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, feeding from Lower Lough MacNean and into Upper Lough Erne. It meanders through a wide, flat Glacial Trough between the uplands of Fermanagh, Belmore Mountain and the Cuilcagh Mountains. The valley is characterised by wide flat lowlands enclosed by low hills. The Cladagh River drains into the Arney River. There are six bridging points on the Arney River, five of these are suitable for motorised vehicles, while one is located on private land near to the source of the river. ==Angling== The river is often used by amateur anglers who are fishing for salmon and trout, however, the river is mainly populated by perch. ==Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits== In February 1594, an English army took and garrisoned Enniskillen. The fort was promptly besieged by Hugh Maguire, Red Hugh O\u2019Donnell and Cormac McBarron O\u2019Neill (Hugh O\u2019Neill\u2019s brother). In August 1594 an English relief army led by Sir Henry Duke was ambushed on the Arney River and routed by Maguire in the Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits: a title commemorating the sight of English rations floating down the Arney.O'Neill, James and Logue, Paul.

Alternatively the local brick making industry may also have given rise to this name as the river was lined with brick fields during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. ==See also== * Rivers of Ireland * List of rivers of Northern Ireland ==References== ==External links== * Geograph - River Arney Photograph * 2014 BBC News story on new evidence regarding the Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits: \"Bullet discovery set to rewrite history books\" * \u2014 \"Maguire, MacBaron and Henry Duke\u2019s crackers: the Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits\", 7 August 1594 Category:Rivers of County Fermanagh ",
