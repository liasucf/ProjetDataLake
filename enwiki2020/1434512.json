    "text": "Alphonso Johnson (born 2 February 1951) is an American jazz bassist active since the early 1970s. Johnson was a member of the influential jazz fusion group Weather Report from 1973 to 1975, and has performed and recorded with numerous high-profile rock and jazz acts including Santana, Phil Collins, members of the Grateful Dead, and Chet Baker. ==Biography== Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Johnson started off as an upright bass player, but switched to the electric bass in his late teens. Beginning his career in the early 1970s, Johnson showed innovation and fluidity on the electric bass. He sessioned with a few jazz musicians before landing a job with Weather Report, taking over for co-founding member Miroslav Vitous. Johnson debuted with Weather Report on the album Mysterious Traveller. He appeared on two more Weather Report albums: Tale Spinnin' (1975) and Black Market (1976) before he left the band to work with drummer Billy Cobham. During 1976-77 he recorded three solo albums as a band leader, for the Epic label, in a fusion-funk vein. Johnson was one of the first musicians to introduce the Chapman Stick to the public. In 1977 his knowledge of the instrument offered him a rehearsal with Genesis, who were looking for a replacement for guitarist Steve Hackett. Being more of a bassist than a guitarist, Johnson instead recommended his friend ex- Sweetbottom guitarist and fellow session musician Daryl Stuermer, who would go on to remain a member of Genesis's touring band until the 2007 reunion tour. Johnson was one of two bass players on Phil Collins's first solo album, Face Value, in 1981. In early 1982, Johnson joined Grateful Dead member Bob Weir's side project Bobby and the Midnites. He would reunite with Weir in 2000, playing bass in place of Phil Lesh on tour with The Other Ones. He has also performed fusion versions of Grateful Dead songs alongside Billy Cobham in the band Jazz Is Dead. In 1996, Johnson played bass on tracks Dance on a Volcano and Fountain of Salmacis on Steve Hackett's Genesis Revisited album. Later in 1996, Johnson toured Europe and Japan with composer and saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist James Beard, drummer Rodney Holmes, and guitarist David Gilmore. In the fall of 2011 he began working toward a music education degree at the Department of Music at California State University, Northridge. He has an extensive experience as a bass teacher and has conducted bass seminars and clinics in Germany, England, France, Scotland, Ireland, Japan, Switzerland, Australia, Brazil and Argentina. Johnson serves as an adjunct instructor at the University of Southern California and the California Institute of the Arts. ==Equipment== === Electric basses=== * Lobue Custom * Warwick Alphonso Johnson Custom Shop Bass Guitar * Warwick Infinity * Vigier Arpege 5 fretless * Modulus Quantum 5 String Fretted and Fretless Bass ===Acoustic basses=== * Washburn AB45 ==Discography== ===As leader=== * Moonshadows (1976) * Yesterday's Dreams (1976) * Spellbound (1977) ===As sideman=== With Hermeto Pascoal * Slave Mass (1977) With Abraxas Pool * Abraxas Pool (1997) ;With Chet Baker *You Can't Go Home Again (1977) With Dee Dee Bridgewater *Just Family (1977) With George Cables *Shared Secrets (MuseFX, 2001) With Phil Collins * Face Value (1981) With Steve Hackett * Genesis Revisited (1996) With Eddie Henderson * Sunburst (1975) With Flora Purim * Open Your Eyes You Can Fly (1976) With Santana * Beyond Appearances (1985) * Freedom (1987) * Spirits Dancing in the Flesh (1990) With Weather Report * Mysterious Traveller (1974) * Tale Spinnin' (1975) * Black Market (1976) With Bob Weir * Bobby and the Midnites (1981) * Where the Beat Meets the Street (1984) ==References== == External links == * Category:1951 births Category:American jazz bass guitarists Category:American session musicians Category:Chapman Stick players Category:Epic Records artists Category:Living people Category:Weather Report members Category:20th-century American bass guitarists Category:21st-century American bass guitarists Category:Guitarists from Philadelphia Category:American male bass guitarists Category:The Other Ones members Category:Bobby and the Midnites members Category:Jazz musicians from Pennsylvania Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st- century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians Category:Jazz Is Dead members Category:Catalyst (band) members ",
