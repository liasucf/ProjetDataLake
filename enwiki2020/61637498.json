Origin received $38 million in early funding, including a $3 million seed round in 2017 that was led by Pantera Capital, a $6.6 million CoinList sale, and $26.4 million in additional funding. As of 2018, Origin had been used by 45 organizations to create independent sharing economy applications. ==Protocol== In 2018, Origin launched on the Ethereum Mainnet, as a decentralized marketplace protocol to connect users and providers directly without requiring trusted intermediaries. Users can create marketplaces for their products or services, without the use of a third-party app or company, as Origin claims to facilitate the creation of peer-to-peer marketplaces. These are created through Origin\u2019s database of offerings and customers distributed to potential users, who can create a marketplace based upon that information without having to interact with a private company. ==References== Category:2017 establishments in California Category:Companies based in San Francisco ",
