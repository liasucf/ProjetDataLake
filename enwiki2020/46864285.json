She received her masters in zoology from Mount Holyoke College, Massachchusetts, in 1964. From 1964 to 1968, she studied entomology, ecology and animal behaviour at Harvard University under E. O. Wilson. While studying at Harvard, she was required to spend two years abroad. At the end of 1972, together with her American husband, Michael W. Dix, she decided to go to Guatemala where there was an opportunity to found a biology department at the University of the Valley. In 1977, she was appointed director of the department, a post she maintained until 2002. She is still associated with biological and environmental research at the university and continues to be active in the field. Dix is a recognized taxonomist, especially in the area of Guatemalan orchids.
