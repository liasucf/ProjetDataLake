    "text": "The Bahamas, officially the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. The nation's participation at these Games marked its seventeenth appearance as an independent nation. The Bahamas Olympic Committee sent a total of 28 athletes, 19 men and 9 women, to the Games, participating only in athletics, swimming, and rowing. Eleven of them had previously competed in London 2012, with Chris Brown leading the men's 4 \u00d7 400 m relay squad for the nation's title defense at his fifth consecutive Olympics. Other notable athletes from the Bahamian team featured triple jumper and Beijing 2008 bronze medalist Leevan Sands, swimmer Arianna Vanderpool-Wallace, who rounded out the top eight from London in the women's 50 m freestyle, and sprinter Shaunae Miller, who eventually served as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Bahamas left Rio de Janeiro with two medals awarded to the nation's track and field athletes. Among the medalists were the men's 4 \u00d7 400 m relay squad, highlighted by Brown and his fellow sprinters Michael Mathieu and Demetrius Pinder, and Miller, who sprang an upset over American top sprinter Allyson Felix with a head-first dive to earn an individual gold for the first time, since Tonique Williams- Darling topped the podium in 2004. ==Medalists== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" |- !
