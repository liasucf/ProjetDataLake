He was said to be the school's \"first running back hero\" who would \"carry whole teams on his back.\" He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869-1919 era team. At Alabama he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. ===1905=== Burks was captain of the 1905 team, selected All-Southern the same year. Burks starred in the opening win of 17 to 0 over Maryville. A number of Alabama turnovers kept the game scoreless through halftime. T. S. Sims scored the first touchdown and Burks added a 95-yard return for a touchdown. \"The overworked Burks, who appeared to bear the entire brunt of Alabama's offense,\" collapsed on the field during the second half of a 12 to 5 loss to Georgia Tech. Burks scored in the 30 to 0 victory over Auburn in what was then the largest crowd ever to see a game in Birmingham (4,000). ===1906=== In the Iron Bowl of 1906 he scored all of Alabama's points in a 10 to 0 victory. ==High school football== In 1908 he coached the Barton Academy high school football team. ==Physician== Burks was the college physician of Rollins College for 12 years. When Rollins opened a 7-bed infirmary in 1933, he and one Dr. Ruth Hart cared for students, assisted by a staff of nurses. He died of a throat malady on February 24, 1938. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1883 births Category:1938 deaths Category:All-Southern college football players Category:American football running backs Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football players Category:Sportspeople from Tuscaloosa, Alabama Category:Players of American football from Alabama Category:Physicians from Alabama Category:People from Winter Park, Florida ",
