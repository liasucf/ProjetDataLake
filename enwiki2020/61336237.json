    "text": "Ender Ero\u011flu (born 25 March 1985), better known by his stage name Norm Ender, is a Turkish rapper, songwriter and musician. == Career == At the age of ten, Ender started rapping after being influenced by the German-Turkish rap group Cartel. After dropping out of school, he started rapping in 2001 and then attended the music contest Akademi T\u00fcrkiye broadcast by atv television channel. Initially asked to sing pop music in the Akademi Turkiye contest, Ender refused to comply with the competition's request. Eventually, the Akademi introduced a rap course into its programme. Ender began a group with Erman Alt\u0131no\u011flu, known as Ender & Erman or Erman & Ender. After completing his military service, in 2010 Ender made a solo rap album called Inside Patlar. In 2012, he announced that he would release a new album. He gave concerts in \u0130zmir, Diyarbak\u0131r and Ankara to promote this album and started using the stage name Norm Ender for his solo releases. Ender became known on social media for his song \"Eksik Etek\". This song received about 40 million plays on YouTube in one month, making him the 17th most listened to Turkish artist of 2006. After a 5-year break from music, in 2016 Ender announced a new album under the EMI- Universal Music Turkey label. In July 2019, Ender returned with the track \"Mekan\u0131n Sahibi\" (Owner of the Venue), which satirised the Turkish rap scene and specifically took aim at rappers like Ezhel and Ben Fero, calling them 'babies', and featuring a chorus that aimed to establish Ender's dominance over newer and younger rappers: \"The owner of the venue is back, let's take the babies off the track\". In November 2019, the song was taken down by Spotify due to alleged copyright violations. The song was again restored on Spotify in the same month. == Discography == === Albums === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Album !Details |- |2010 |Enderground |His first underground album, which he produced and released himself between 2002 and 2009. |- |2010 |\u0130\u00e7inde Patlar |A video for \"\u0130\u00e7inde Patlar\" was released in 2010.
